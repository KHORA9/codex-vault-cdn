The first chapter appeared\r\noriginally in \"The Field.\" The Chapters VI, XX, XXI, and XXII were\r\npublished in the \"Illustrated London News,\" under the title \"About a\r\nNumber of Things.\" The rest are some of the articles which, as \"Science\r\nfrom an Easy Chair,\" I contributed, during seven years, to the \"Daily\r\nTelegraph.\" That, to me very happy, conjunction was, like so many other\r\nhappy things, necessarily interrupted by the Great War.\r\n\r\nOne result of that terrible cataclysm is that not a few thoughtful\r\nwriters have been led to deny the existence of what they call\r\n\"Progress,\" meaning by that word the development of mankind from a\r\nless to a more complete attainment of moral and physical well-being.\r\nThe question raised is obscured by the arbitrary use of the word\r\n\"progress,\" since by it any movement from point to point–whether\r\nadvantageous and desirable or the reverse–is described, as, for\r\ninstance, in the familiar titles given by Bunyan to his book \"The\r\nPilgrim's Progress\" and by Hogarth to his pictures \"The Rake's\r\nProgress.\" Those who to-day despair of man's future limit their\r\noutlook on the past to the conventional history of some three or four\r\nthousand years. The only solid ground upon which we can base the\r\nsupposition that mankind has moved from a less to a more complete\r\nattainment of moral and physical well-being and will continue to do so,\r\nexists in the ascertained facts of the past history of living things\r\non this Earth, and of man since his earliest emergence from among the\r\nman-like apes made known to us by his stone-implements and fossilized\r\nbones. That there has been a development from lower, simpler structure\r\nto higher, more complex, more efficient structure is demonstrable,\r\nand so is the proposition that there has been in the human race a\r\ncontinuous development in the direction of increased adaptation to the\r\nconditions of social life and an increased control by man of those\r\nnatural agencies which he can either favour when conducive to his\r\nprosperity, or on the other hand can arrest when inimical to it. \"The\r\ncontinuous weakening of selfishness and the continuous strengthening\r\nof sympathy\" (to adopt the words of the American philosopher, Fiske)\r\nare, in spite of numerous lapses and outbursts of savagery, patent\r\nfeatures of the long history of mankind. We have no reason to doubt\r\ntheir continuation, whilst at the same time we must be prepared for\r\nand accept, without desponding, the ups and the downs, the disasters\r\nas well as the triumphs, which inevitably characterize the natural\r\nprocess of evolution. One thing, above all others, we as conscious,\r\nreasoning beings can do which must tend to the further development and\r\nsecurity of human well-being: we can ascertain ever more and more of\r\nthe truth, or in other words, \"that which is.\" We can discover the\r\nactual conditions of natural law, under which we exist and promote the\r\nknowledge of that truth among our fellows. To do that which is right,\r\nwe must know that which is true. To act rightly, we must know truly.\r\n\r\nWe possess, a vast heritage of knowledge handed on to us in tradition\r\nand in writings from our father-man in the past. But there are yet\r\nimmense fields of knowledge to be explored and yet a greater task to\r\nbe accomplished in spreading the knowledge which we possess, and in\r\npersuading all men that it is their right and their duty to acquire it\r\nand to enjoy the power and the pleasure which it gives. All must also\r\nhelp, directly or indirectly, in the making of new knowledge. Whilst\r\nmankind is still so backward in knowledge and the worship of wisdom, it\r\nis idle to indulge in despair of the future. A chief way to increased\r\nwelfare is still open and untrodden.\r\n\r\nThese are big speculations and problems with which to preface a small\r\nbook. But I am content to offer the small book as a contribution,\r\nhowever restricted, to the spread of a desire for further knowledge of\r\nthe things about which it tells–a possible incitement to serious study\r\nof some one or other among them.\r\n\r\n                                        E.

Gilmore of the United\r\nStates National Museum, by whose kind permission it is here reproduced\r\nfrom the Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum, vol. 56, 1919. It is\r\nbased upon the study of a very fine skeleton and some hundred bones of\r\nallied species, collected by Mr. Sternberg from \"the Permian formation\"\r\nexposed in the vicinity of Seymour, Texas, U.S.A. It is selected for\r\nillustration here because its most striking feature–the high dorsal\r\nfin-like crest along the middle of the back formed by the elongation\r\nof the neural spines of the vertebræ–is a puzzle to the conscientious\r\nDarwinian. Professor Case says of it: \"The elongate spines were\r\nuseless, so far as I can imagine, and I have been puzzling over them\r\nfor several years. It is impossible to conceive of them as useful\r\neither for defence or concealment, or in any other way than as a great\r\nburden to the creatures (terrestrial non-aquatic animals) that bore\r\nthem. They must have been a nuisance in getting through the vegetation,\r\nand a great drain upon the creature's vitality, both to develop them\r\nand keep them in repair.\" The reader is referred to pp. 127, 128,\r\nwhere a brief discussion of such exuberant growths will be found. The\r\nexcessive growth of the median fins in the fish Pteraclis allied to the\r\nDolphin which displays changing floods of surface colour as it dies–and\r\nin the Australian Blenny called Patæcus–both figured on p. 130–should\r\nbe compared with that of the strange crest of the grotesque Dimetrodon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n  DIMETRODON                                             _Frontispiece_\r\n\r\n  FIGS.

On it are carved\r\nby in-sunk lines certain representations of animals. It was found in\r\nthe cavern of Lortet, near Lourdes, in the department of the Hautes\r\nPyrénées, in the south of France, together with many other remains of\r\nprehistoric man. This cavern was excavated and all its contents of\r\nhuman origin carefully preserved by M. Edouard Piette in 1873 and the\r\nfollowing years. Drawings of this and other remarkable carved pieces\r\nof bone and antler, many in the form of harpoon heads, and of small\r\nchipped flint implements, all found in this cave, were published by\r\nhim.[1] He excavated also several other caverns with great care, and\r\nhis collections were bequeathed by him on his death to the great Museum\r\nof National Archæology at St. Germain, near Paris, where I have had the\r\nadvantage of studying them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.\r\n\r\nFIG. 2.\r\n\r\nFIGS. 1 AND 2.–Engraved cylinder of red-deer's antler, from the Azilian\r\n(Elapho-Tarandian) horizon of the cavern of Lortet. Drawn of a little\r\nmore than half the actual size of the specimen.]\r\n\r\nThe age assigned to this carving is that called by Piette\r\n\"Elapho-Tarandian.\" At this period the reindeer (Tarandus), which\r\npreviously abounded, is giving place to the red deer (Elaphus). The\r\nlayer in which this carving was found belongs to the latest of the\r\nPalæolithic cave deposits, and was followed by a warmer period, in\r\nwhich the red deer and the modern fauna entirely replaced the old\r\nfauna of the Glacial period. The deposits in Pyrenean caves of the\r\nElapho-Tarandian age are characterized by an abundance of large flat\r\nharpoons serrated on both sides. In this latest horizon of the Reindeer\r\nperiod the art of engraving in outline on bone and stone had attained\r\nthe highest pitch of excellence which it reached in the prehistoric\r\nrace of South-West Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.–_A._ Perforated harpoon of the Azilian or\r\nRed-Deer period, made from antler of red deer, found in quantity in the\r\nupper layers of deposit in the cavern of the Mas d'Azil (Arriège). _B_\r\nand _C_.

Here is Mr. Kipling's vision\r\nof primitive man:\r\n\r\n    Once on a glittering icefield, ages and ages ago,\r\n    Ung, a maker of pictures, fashioned an image of snow.\r\n    Later he pictured an aurochs, later he pictured a bear–\r\n    Pictured the sabre-tooth tiger dragging a man to his lair–\r\n    Pictured the mountainous mammoth, hairy, abhorrent, alone–\r\n    Out of the love that he bore them, scribing them clearly on bone,\r\n    Straight on the glittering icefield, by the caves of the lost Dordogne,\r\n    Ung, a maker of pictures, fell to his scribing on bone.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that several prehistoric races have succeeded one another\r\nin Western Europe during the immensely long period–amounting to\r\nhundreds of thousands of years–during which man existed before the dawn\r\nof history. The \"lost\" or \"prehistoric Dordogne\" was like the present\r\nhistoric Dordogne in regard to the fact that many races and dynasties\r\nsuccessively held possession of it and left their work in its soil and\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\nPassing back through the historic age of iron and the sub-historic\r\nage of bronze, we come to a time, about four thousand years ago, when\r\nthere were no men in the west of Europe who made use of metals at all,\r\nalthough, for a thousand or two years earlier, men were using bronze\r\nand copper in the East. European races immediately before the first\r\nuse of metals made beautiful implements of stone (chiefly flint), and\r\nfinished them by grinding and polishing them. These men are spoken of\r\nas Neolithic men, or men of the Neolithic period. They had herds and\r\ncultivated crops, and they built after a fashion rough houses in wood\r\nand tombs and temples with great slabs of stone. They made pottery\r\nand woven cloth. The animals and plants of Europe were the same in\r\nthose late prehistoric times as they are to-day. The Lake dwellings\r\nof Switzerland belong to this epoch and yield us their remains\r\nas evidence. The men had very nearly the same set of domesticated\r\nanimals as we have to-day, but they had no skill in carving outlines\r\nof animals. Their only decorative work consisted of parallel lines,\r\nstraight or in zigzags or in circles, graven on the great stone slabs\r\nwhich they erected.\r\n\r\nWe can trace them back to some seven thousand years B.C. and then comes\r\na huge gap–we do not know how many thousand years–in our evidence as\r\nto what was going on in this part of the world. We find convincing\r\nproof that before this interval the climate was much colder than it is\r\nto-day, and that the land surface of Europe was in many respects very\r\ndifferent from what it became later. Britain was continuous with the\r\nContinent. There were in that remote period human tribes spread over\r\nthe less frigid valleys of Europe. They had no fields, no herds; they\r\nfed on the roasted flesh of the animals they chased and on the fish\r\nthey speared, and on wild fruits and roots. They dwelt chiefly, if not\r\nwholly, in caves, probably also in skin tents, but they did not build\r\neither in wood or in stone. The age which we thus reach is called the\r\nPalæolithic, or \"ancient\" Stone age, because men made use of stone,\r\nwhich they chipped into shape, but, unlike the Neolithic people, never\r\npolished it. We find enormous numbers of these rough or Palæolithic\r\nstone implements both in caves and in the gravels deposited in the\r\nancient beds of rivers. They are so abundant as to prove the existence\r\nof a very considerable human population in the remote ages when they\r\nwere fashioned and used. The changes which have taken place and the\r\ntime involved since some of these Palæolithic implements were made and\r\nused may be guessed at (but cannot be definitely calculated) from the\r\nfact that the beds of the rivers which formed the gravel terraces in\r\nwhich they are found in England were, in many cases, from one to six\r\nhundred feet above the level of the present rivers. The land surface\r\nhas risen and the rivers have simultaneously excavated deep and wide\r\nvalleys leaving terraces of gravel high up on their sides. These show\r\nwhere the rivers once flowed. The vastness of the excavation of the\r\nvalley from the level of the old river bed 600 ft. up on the sloping\r\nhill-side to its present low-lying bed in the floor of the valley–gives\r\nus some measure of the time which has elapsed in the process.\r\n\r\nNo one can tell, at present, the limit in the past of Palæolithic man.\r\nThe period of time over which his existence extended, as indicated\r\nby the trimmed flints undoubtedly made by human workmanship, is a\r\nmatter of hundreds of thousands of years. In Western Europe races came\r\nand went, succeeded one another and disappeared, either migrating or\r\nabsorbed or more rarely destroyed by the later invaders. Naturally\r\nenough, in the later deposits of rivers and in the higher layers of\r\nearth and limestone cake which fill many caves to the depth of 30 or 40\r\nft. we find the remains of man's workmanship more abundantly than in\r\nthe older deposits.\r\n\r\nWe can broadly distinguish in the Palæolithic epoch three (perhaps\r\nfour) periods, separated by the occurrence of great extensions of the\r\nnorthern or arctic ice cap of such a volume as to cover North Europe\r\nand North America, and the simultaneous extension of the glaciers of\r\nthe mountains of Europe. This period of the alternating extension\r\nand retreat of the great northern glaciers is known as the Glacial\r\nperiod, or Ice Age. The _latest_ Palæolithic men are subsequent to\r\nit–that is, post-Glacial. We can distinguish several successive ages\r\nof these post-Glacial Palæolithic men, altogether distinct from and\r\nanterior to the Neolithic men. In the earlier of these ages many of\r\nthe great animals of the Glacial period–now extinct or withdrawn to\r\nother regions–still survived in Europe. The mammoth survived, but\r\nwas fast dying out in the south and centre of France, and we find\r\nits outline scratched on ivory and on bone by the early post-Glacial\r\nmen. The lion still survived in Europe, also the hyena, the bear and\r\nthe rhinoceros. The reindeer seems to have been especially abundant,\r\nand to have been associated with the men of this period. The horse\r\nwas very abundant, and was largely eaten by the earlier post-Glacial\r\npeople. From the first these men show extraordinary artistic skill, and\r\nhave left in their caves many carvings on ivory, bone and stone. In\r\nthe oldest deposits of the post-Glacial age the carvings are complete\r\nall-round sculptures of small size or carvings in low relief, all\r\nof rough primitive workmanship. Larger life-size sculptures in rock\r\nare also found. In later deposits we find better sculpture and also\r\nengraving on flat pieces of bone and ivory, and also on stone. This\r\nart persisted, and attained its greatest perfection in the latest\r\ndeposits of all in which the work of Palæolithic man is found. The\r\nreindeer persisted through this post-Glacial period (hence often called\r\n\"the reindeer period\") until the gradual increase of temperature and\r\nchange of herbage and forest led to its migration northwards and to the\r\nrelative abundance of the red deer. It is to this latest period–the\r\nElapho-Tarandian of Piette–that the engraved antler figured here (Figs.\r\n1 and 2) belongs.\r\n\r\nAt an earlier stage of the post-Glacial period men hunted the bison and\r\nother large game in the north of Spain and made coloured drawings of\r\nthem on the roofs and walls of their caves, drawings which have been\r\ncopied and preserved: whilst the mammoth, the rhinoceros, the cave\r\nlion and bear still inhabited south central France and are pictured on\r\nthe walls of caves in that region–as described in Chapter II. Later we\r\nlose all trace of Palæolithic man and his wonderful artistic skill. He\r\nseems either to have migrated or to have been absorbed in the immigrant\r\nNeolithic race–a race singularly devoid of any tendency to artistic\r\nsculpture or engraving.\r\n\r\nThe skeletons and skulls of the men of the Reindeer period, or\r\npost-Glacial Palæolithic men, have been discovered here and there.\r\nThey indicate a fine, tall people with well-shaped skulls and jaws,\r\ncomparable to the nobler modern races. It is convenient to call them\r\nCromagnards, since good skulls of the race have been described from\r\nCromagnon, in France. There is evidence (from skulls) that another\r\nrace (the negroid so called \"Aurignacians\") preceded and coexisted to\r\nsome extent in Western Europe with them, but we have, at present, no\r\nevidence as to whence or how the Neolithic race or the Cromagnard race\r\nor any of their predecessors came upon the scene!\r\n\r\nWhen we go farther back and reach the actual Glacial period we find\r\na very different state of things. The men who then existed in the\r\ncaverns are called the Neander men. They were a short, bandy-legged,\r\nlong-armed, low-browed people, great workers of flints. They had\r\nthe use of fire, and contended with hyenas and bears and lions for\r\nthe occupation of their caverns. In their day–the day of European\r\nglaciation–the mammoth was in full occupation of the pine forests on\r\nthe edge of the glaciers. But the Neander men made no sculptures, or\r\ncarving, or engravings. The gap between them and the Cromagnon men\r\nis much greater than that between an Australian black fellow and an\r\naverage Englishman; indeed, the difference is properly expressed by\r\nregarding the Neander man as a distinct species–Homo neanderthalensis.\r\n\r\nPassing again farther back over an immense period of time, we find\r\nEurope warm again; the glaciers have (for a time) gone or retreated\r\nfar up the mountains but are found in extension again at a still\r\nearlier date. An inter-Glacial set of animals is now found living in a\r\ncomparatively warm climate in Western Europe. Another elephant (Elephas\r\nantiquus) is there (not the mammoth), and another rhinoceros (not\r\nthe woolly rhinoceros of the later Glacial period); the hippopotamus\r\nflourished then in Europe and swam in the Thames and Severn, and there\r\ntoo, at last is the sabre-toothed tiger, which did not exist at all at\r\na later period! Now was the time when a man, if he could, might have\r\n\"scribed\" the image of a sabre-toothed tiger on a piece of bone, but,\r\nso far as we know, he did not and could not. This was ages before other\r\nsucceeding men walked \"on glittering ice fields,\" and they, in turn,\r\nwere ages earlier than the artistic Cromagnards of the Reindeer period.\r\n\r\nThe presence of men in the warm inter-Glacial times in Europe is proved\r\nby the association of rough but undisputed flint implements with the\r\ninter-Glacial animals and by the discovery of a most interesting human\r\njaw (chinless, like that of the Neander men) in what is held to be a\r\npræ-Glacial deposit at Heidelberg. We have very little knowledge of\r\nGlacial and præ-Glacial man except well characterized flint implements\r\nand two skeletons, some detached limb bones, four or five jaws, and\r\nas many skulls.[2] But of post-Glacial Palæolithic man we know the\r\nskeletons of the Cromagnard race, their sepulture, their decorative\r\nnecklaces, and their bone and ivory carvings and engravings, and\r\nthe coloured rock paintings and other work of earlier races (the\r\nAurignacians, and others) belonging to successive epochs or eras,\r\nwhich have been discovered in caves in France, Spain, Belgium, and\r\nAustria. It was long after them that the Neolithic people appeared.\r\n\r\nThe preceding remarks will have made it clear that the engraved antler\r\nhere figured was carved by a man who was not really at all primitive,\r\nalthough he lived probably between twenty and fifty thousand years ago.\r\nIt will also have been made clear that hundreds of such engravings,\r\nmore or less fragmentary, are known. Some are very skilful works\r\nof art, others of a much inferior quality. Many, however, show an\r\nastonishing familiarity with the animal drawn and a sureness of drawing\r\nwhich is not surpassed by the work of modern artists (see Chapter III).\r\nThe interest of the particular engraved antler which I am describing\r\nis that it is the only carving of its age as yet discovered which is\r\nmore than a drawing or sculpture of a single animal. It is a \"picture\"\r\nin the sense of being a composition. It is not, it is true, painted–it\r\nis engraved; but being a composition it is entitled to be called \"the\r\nearliest picture in the world.\" Let me describe it a little more fully\r\nwith the help of the illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe engraving has been made on a long cylindrical piece of the red\r\ndeer's antler. It can hardly be considered as decorative, since the\r\nfigures of the animals do not show as such on the cylindrical surface\r\n(Figs. 1 and 2). Pieces of antler, bone, and ivory carved with\r\nspiral scrolls and circles which are really decorative and effective\r\nas decoration are found in these caves (Fig. 29). But often such\r\npieces as the present are met with. It has been discovered by French\r\narchæologists that the true intent of such engravings may be rendered\r\nevident by rolling the cylinder on a plastic substance (soft wax or\r\nsimilar material), when the drawing is \"printed off\" or \"developed\"\r\nas it is termed. A great number of such line engravings have been\r\nthus printed off or developed, and plaster casts made from the flat\r\nimpressions are preserved in the museum of St. Germain, the engraved\r\nlines being rendered obvious by letting them fill with printing ink.\r\nThey often give us in this way a \"printed\" drawing of remarkable\r\naccuracy and artistic quality. The rolled-off print of our specimen is\r\nshown in Fig. 4. The cylinder has been damaged by time, but the print\r\nshows, more or less completely, a vigorous outline drawing of three red\r\ndeer, with six salmon-like fish placed in a decorative way above them\r\nand between their legs. Two lozenge-shaped outlines (above the larger\r\nstag) are held by good authorities to be the signature of the artist.\r\nThe group of deer is represented in movement. The largest stag is on\r\nthe right; his hindquarters are broken away by injury to the cylinder.\r\nHe is commencing to advance, and turns his head backwards to see what\r\nis the thing which has alarmed him and his companions; at the same time\r\nhis mouth is open, and he is \"blowing.\" The second stag is a younger\r\nand smaller animal, and is retreating more rapidly. The cylinder is\r\ndamaged so that, although all the four legs of this second stag are\r\npreserved, the head and neck are gone, though the points of the antlers\r\nare preserved. The same damage has removed all but the hind legs of the\r\nstill younger animal who heads the group. The beauty of the drawing of\r\nthese hind legs and the extraordinary impression of graceful, rapid\r\nmovement given by their hanging pose, side by side, is not surpassed,\r\neven if it be equalled, by the work of any modern draughtsman. It is\r\nclear that the youngest and smallest member of the group is, as is\r\nnatural, the most timid, and that he has sprung off with a sudden bound\r\non the occurrence of the alarm from the rear, which is setting the\r\nwhole group into motion with increasing velocity as we pass from right\r\nto left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.–Rolled impression or \"development\" of the\r\nengraving on the Lortet antler.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.–Restoration (or completion) of the engraving on\r\nthe Lortet antler, as now (1919) suggested by the writer (E. R. L.).]\r\n\r\nThe \"printed-off,\" or \"unrolled,\" or \"developed\" picture given in Fig.\r\n3 is an exact reproduction of a copy of the cast made and preserved\r\nin the Museum of National Antiquities at St. Germain, for which\r\nI am indebted to my friend M. Salomon Reinach, the distinguished\r\narchæologist who is the director of that museum. It is reproduced\r\nhere, a little larger than half the size of the original, as are the\r\nrepresentations of the carved cylinder itself (Figs. 1 and 2). In Fig.\r\n4 we have my attempt to restore the damaged portions of the design and\r\nto present it as it was when the Palæolithic man completed it some\r\n20,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nI will return to the question of the correctness of this restoration,\r\nbut before doing so I wish to mention some extremely interesting\r\npoints as to the probable use of the cylinder of stag's antler and\r\nthe purpose of the carving around its axis. In the first place, this\r\nand a few other of the pieces of carving of the post-Glacial period\r\nwere certainly the work of highly gifted and practised artists. It is\r\nobvious that this work is far superior both in conception and execution\r\nto the more or less clever, often grotesque, carvings and paintings\r\nmade by modern savages or simple pastoral folk. There is no reason to\r\nsuppose that the Cromagnards, or men of the post-Glacial or Reindeer\r\nperiod of West Europe, differed from modern races in being universally\r\ngifted with artistic capacity. This engraving of three stags is almost\r\ncertainly the work of a man who belonged to a family or guild of\r\npicture-makers who had cultivated such work for centuries and handed\r\nit on from master to apprentice. This design is probably one which\r\nhad been perfected by many succeeding observers and draughtsmen. Its\r\nsureness of line and vivacity of movement are not the outcome of the\r\nsudden inspiration of an untutored savage, but are the result of the\r\ngrowth, cultivation, and development of artistic perception and the\r\npower of artistic execution in successive generations.\r\n\r\nIt seems in the highest degree improbable, if not impossible, that so\r\nexcellent a drawing as this should have been cut on the cylindrical\r\npiece of antler by an engraver who never saw the flat or rolled-off\r\nimpress of his design. One is driven to the conclusion that he must,\r\nas he worked on the bone, have taken an impress of the growing picture\r\nfrom time to time, using probably animal fat and charcoal as an \"ink\"\r\nand printing on to a piece of prepared skin or on to a birch-bark\r\ncloth. How otherwise could he have made his engraving so truly that\r\nwhen, ages afterwards, we print it off the cylinder, we are astonished\r\nand delighted by its perfection of design and execution? If this be\r\nonce admitted–namely, that the artist tested and checked his work by\r\nprinting it off as he proceeded with it–we gain what appears to me\r\nto be the probable solution of the question which has been largely\r\ndebated, \"For what were these carved cylinders or rods used?\" Those\r\nwhich are simple cylindrical rods, such as the present one, must be\r\ndistinguished from others which have one or more circular holes bored\r\nin them and others which are curiously bent at an angle. Such specimens\r\nare often carved with small unimportant ornament, not requiring\r\ndevelopment or printing. They as well as the present class have been\r\nspoken of as \"wands of authority\" and \"sceptres\"; some are considered\r\nto be arrow straighteners; others have been supposed to be \"divining\r\nrods\" or \"rods of witchcraft\"; whilst one of those discovered by M.\r\nPiette (others similar to it are known) has been regarded as a \"lance\r\nthrower\" or \"propulsor\" (such as modern primitive races use), having\r\na notch at one end upon which the lance to be thrown is made to rest.\r\nThe latest suggestion as to these notch-and-hook-bearing rods, is that\r\nthey are large crochet hooks used in making nets. It has also been\r\nsuggested that some of these carved rods were used as \"fasteners\" of\r\nthe skins used as clothing.\r\n\r\nI venture to suggest that the elaborately carved cylinder which we are\r\nconsidering and others bearing similar carvings, which only show up\r\nwhen a printing of them is taken, were used by the men who made them\r\nfor this very same \"printing\" as an end in itself. The picture could be\r\nthus impressed on skins, birch bark, and other material. This race was\r\nthoroughly familiar with the use of paint formed by mixing grease with\r\ncharcoal (to produce black), red ochre (to produce red), yellow ochre\r\n(to produce yellow), and some preparation of limestone or chalk (to\r\nproduce white). Coloured pictures representing animals of the chase,\r\ncoloured with red, yellow, white, and black and outlined by engraving,\r\nhave been discovered on the rock walls of the caves used by them. Such\r\npictures are found of relatively early as well as of late date within\r\nthe post-Glacial Palæolithic period (see Chapter III). The rock picture\r\nof a single animal is usually from two to five feet long. People who\r\ncould make those coloured designs and who could draw and compose so\r\nadmirably as the author of the \"Three Red Deer\" would have desired to\r\n\"roll off\" and to possess printings of their favourite representations\r\nof animal life, whilst we must admit that their skill and ingenuity was\r\nassuredly equal to the task of so printing them. If this carving of the\r\n\"Three Red Deer\" were never printed it could not have been executed in\r\nthe first place, nor seen and admired when completed. If even only half\r\na dozen or a dozen impressions were taken from it for ornamenting the\r\nskins or other material used by a chief, or a wizard, or a woman, its\r\nproduction becomes intelligible. It is true that there is nothing known\r\nas to the use of such printing from a cylinder among existing primitive\r\npeople, but it is known in very early times (4500 B.C.), since\r\ncylindrical seals were used by the Babylonians. Elaborately grooved\r\nblocks used for printing on cloth are known from Fiji and Samoa, and\r\nthe mere practice of printing on to a flat surface is common enough\r\namong savage races in regard to the human hand, impressions or prints\r\nof which obtained by the use of a greasy pigment are found upon rocks\r\nor stones. Sometimes prints of the hand or fingers are taken in clay.\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, forget that the primary purpose of savage and\r\nprimitive mankind in making images or engravings of animals is that\r\nof influencing the animals by witchcraft or magic, as has been urged\r\nby Reinach. From such magic-working drawings the art of savages has\r\ngradually developed just as religious figures and designs have been the\r\ninitial motive of historic European art.\r\n\r\nIt seems in any case fairly certain that the artist who engraved our\r\npicture of the three deer on to the stag's antler must have worked from\r\nand copied a completed flat drawing, and probably printed it in some\r\nway on to the prepared antler before engraving its lines thereon and\r\nalso checked the work, as he proceeded, by successive trial printings\r\nor \"proofs\" on to a flat surface. It is possible though it does not\r\nseem very probable, that the drawing was thus committed to perpetual\r\ninvisibility on a cylindrical rod–for the purpose of exercising \"magic\"\r\nwith that rod. It seems to me that the Cromagnard owner of the rod\r\nwould have wished to see \"what the picture really looked like,\" and so\r\nwould have on some occasion and more than once have \"printed it off\" or\r\nas we say \"unrolled it.\"\r\n\r\nLeaving that question aside I have a few words to say as to the present\r\nattempted \"completion\" of the picture. My difficulty has been in\r\nrealizing the suggestion of a free, graceful \"bounding\" action given\r\nby the pair of small hind legs which form all that remains of the\r\nsmallest of the three deer. I have tried various poses of the calf\r\nindicated by these legs–bucking and jumping, and with fore legs closely\r\nbent to the horizontal or in a more open position. The fact is there is\r\nvery little in existing drawings or photographs which can help us to a\r\ndecision of the problem, \"How did the prehistoric artist complete that\r\nexquisite little pair of hanging legs?\" The problem is more obscure\r\neven than that of the pose of the arms of the Venus of Melos. One feels\r\nsure that the man who made this carving was an artist who must keep a\r\ncertain rhythm and flow in the action and form of the three successive\r\nanimals, and it is clear that he was a wonderful observer of the phases\r\nof the limbs in movement. It is, perhaps, a presumptuous thing to\r\nattempt on such a basis to recall the thought of a man who died twenty\r\nthousand years ago, but I set out to do so with the belief that there\r\nis a necessary figure determined by those hind legs.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, as a step towards a solution of the problem, I\r\npublished a \"restoration\" or \"completion\" of this picture in the\r\n\"Field\" (May 13th, 1911), and asked for criticisms and suggestions from\r\nthe readers of that journal. I had no difficulty as to the completion\r\nof the biggest stag by drawing in his haunches and hind-legs, but\r\nthe completion of the head and antlers of the smaller stag–and still\r\nmore the calling into being of the entire calf as an inference from\r\nhis or her suspended hind-feet and hoofs alone–were not easy tasks.\r\nI consulted many authorities and some instantaneous photographs, but\r\nI was not satisfied with the pose I finally suggested for the calf\r\nnor with the \"points\" assigned by my draughtsman to the antlers of\r\nthe smaller stag. Some interesting suggestions were made in reply\r\nto my appeal by readers of the \"Field.\" Those which seemed to me of\r\nconclusive weight and value were offered by Mr. Walter Winans, who\r\ncombines the qualifications of a great observer of big game with those\r\nof a great artist. In the restoration now given in Fig. 5 I have\r\nprofited by Mr. Walter Winans' criticism and have been especially\r\nglad to make use of the spirited sketch made by him for my benefit,\r\nand published in the \"Field\" of 1911, of a red-deer calf when hopping\r\nalong with all the feet together, a movement known as \"buck-jumping.\"\r\n\"Of course,\" writes Mr. Winans, \"this is quite different to the\r\nbronco-pony's action when trying to get rid of a rider. In the case\r\nof this kind she does not come down with a jar–but as she lands\r\nbends her knees and hocks simultaneously and then straightens them,\r\nalso simultaneously, bounding in the air with bent back, tail curled\r\ntight on back, head thrown back, and ears forward; she never puts\r\nher fore-legs, either knee or fetlock, beyond her shoulder in this\r\naction.\" These words of Mr. Winans and his outline sketch of the\r\nbuck-jumping calf precisely realize what the little hanging legs of\r\nthe rubbed-out calf had been, as it were, urging my tired brain to\r\nrecall and visualize. I am convinced that Mr. Winans' sketch gives the\r\ncompletion of the picture as drawn by the artist of the Lortet cavern,\r\nand satisfies the demand made by the gracefully suspended limbs shown\r\nin the incompletely preserved original. And so I have used it in my\r\nfinal restoration here given in Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nThe following letter by Mr. Winans, giving valuable comments on the\r\nLortet picture, was published in the \"Field,\" and will assist others\r\nin appreciating its significance: it enabled me to get the middle\r\nstag's antlers correctly drawn. I have omitted a few lines referring to\r\ndefects in the original restoration–now corrected.\r\n\r\n     \"SIR,–As Sir Ray Lankester asks for criticism of this wonderful\r\n     drawing of three deer, perhaps the following may be of interest.\r\n     I have known deer all my life, and lived amongst them the last\r\n     twelve years. I agree that the picture is wonderful–better than\r\n     anything Landseer or Rosa Bonheur drew, because these latter were\r\n     only artists: one can see by their pictures (full of faults as\r\n     to attitudes and actions) that they knew nothing of deer. For\r\n     instance, Landseer's stags were much too big in the body and\r\n     their heads too small, and even the shape of their horns was\r\n     conventional....\r\n\r\n     \"The Lorthet drawings enable one to know all details about the\r\n     three deer (looking at the original mutilated 'development').\r\n     First, the deer have 'got the wind' of an enemy, have come a long\r\n     way, and are moving leisurely, the big stag, as usual, bringing up\r\n     the rear and taking a last look round before the herd goes out of\r\n     sight. The second is the younger stag who generally accompanies\r\n     the big stag and acts as his sentinel when he is sleeping, a stag\r\n     too small to give the big stag any jealousy as to his hinds. The\r\n     third is undoubtedly a calf (Red deer are 'stags,' 'hinds,' and\r\n     'calves,' not 'does' and 'fawns'; the latter terms apply to Fallow\r\n     deer and Roe-deer).\r\n\r\n     \"The deer are typical Red deer, not Wapiti, except that the only\r\n     tail showing (that of the middle deer) is the short Wapiti tail,\r\n     not the longer tail of the Red deer, and the ears are shorter than\r\n     those of any existing species of deer.\r\n\r\n     \"The horns of the big stag are those of typical park Red deer,\r\n     exactly like the Warnham Park big stag: brow, bay, and tray, with\r\n     a bunch on top, and the horns are short and straight for their\r\n     thickness.\r\n\r\n     \"Now as to the short tail. I am trying, by crossing the Wapiti,\r\n     Red deer, and Altai to get back to the original deer before the\r\n     various species got separated, and my 'three-cross' deer show\r\n     these very characteristics, as follows: Red deer or Warnham\r\n     horns, short Wapiti tail, and the rather Roman nose which this\r\n     'development' print shows. The only difference is the short ears.\r\n     Is it not possible that, as the artist is able to draw the horns\r\n     in perspective and show the anatomy and proportions so well, that\r\n     the ears are meant to be drawn fore-shortened?\r\n\r\n     \"The stag's mouth is open because he is big and fat and is blowing\r\n     (not roaring or bellowing). If it was the rutting season, when\r\n     stags roar, the stag would be tucked up in the belly and have a\r\n     tuft of hair hanging under the middle of it. He and the stag in\r\n     front are moving in the real action (not the conventional action\r\n     Rosa Bonheur and Landseer drew, but what the ancient Egyptians\r\n     drew sometimes) of a slow, easy canter.... Now as to the middle\r\n     stag's horns. I should give him, bearing in mind he is the small\r\n     sentry stag, brow, tray, and three on top–a ten-pointer, the thin\r\n     points showing in the original drawing indicating that he had thin\r\n     horns–in fact, a three-year old.\r\n\r\n     \"In a Scotch forest a ten-pointer is a comparatively old stag, but\r\n     at Warnham and my place, where the feeding is good (and in my case\r\n     there is hand feeding all the year round), a spike stag gets six\r\n     points and can almost be a royal the next year.\r\n\r\n     \"All this shows that the deer at the time this drawing was made\r\n     must have had very good feeding and come to maturity quickly,\r\n     like modern park deer. The big stag would never have allowed a\r\n     ten-pointer in his herd if the latter had been an old stag.\r\n\r\n     \"As to the action of the leading hind. I think she is a hind-calf\r\n     by her legs, and is jumping with all four legs together, the\r\n     way young deer do when playing, and, being young, is paying no\r\n     attention to the danger behind, but is full of life, like a horse\r\n     playing about when he is fresh. One often sees the calves of a\r\n     herd playing like this if the herd is moving along steadily....\r\n\r\n     \"From the position of the hind legs of the little calf I judge\r\n     that she is jumping with all four legs together (the jump from\r\n     which the expression 'buck jumping' comes); her tail would be\r\n     curled up tight over her back like a pug dog carries it, only\r\n     without the curl, and her ears pricked forward. The piece of horn\r\n     broken off would show the rest of the hinds and calves, led by an\r\n     old 'yeld' (_i.e._, barren) hind, who would be leading the herd\r\n     up wind with her nose and ears forward to 'get the wind' of any\r\n     danger ahead.\r\n\r\n     \"The day is a hot one in the middle of August, shown by the big\r\n     stag blowing and his being with the hinds, instead of with other\r\n     stags by themselves, and by his not having 'run' yet, though his\r\n     horns are clear of velvet. He is most likely the stag on whose\r\n     horn this is engraved. The length of the deer's feet shows that\r\n     they live on ground which is soft and not many stones about to\r\n     wear down their toes.\r\n\r\n     \"Maybe the fish indicate that the deer are crossing a shallow\r\n     ford, and the salmon are getting frightened and jumping. The\r\n     right-hand-most fish is just in the attitude of a hooked salmon\r\n     trying to leap clear of the fly....\r\n\r\n     \"The picture was most likely first drawn on some flat flexible\r\n     surface, skin or bark, in a sticky medium, and then transferred to\r\n     the horn by rolling it round the horn and then rubbing it. This\r\n     would give a transfer, which would guide the subsequent engraving,\r\n     otherwise it would be very difficult to engrave direct on the\r\n     horn, and mistakes could not easily be corrected.\r\n\r\n                                        \"WALTER WINANS\r\n\r\n    \"SURRENDEN PARK, PLUCKLEY, KENT\"\r\n\r\nWith regard to the six fishes in the picture of \"The Three Red Deer,\" I\r\nthink that there can be little doubt that they are put in in the same\r\nspirit of exuberance which induced early Italian masters to introduce\r\na cherub wherever a space for him could be found. The fish represented\r\nare the same in each case, and are undeniably salmonids. Presumably\r\nthey are drawn on a larger scale than the deer. Their markings and the\r\nform of the head are deserving of some criticism and comment by those\r\nwho are familiar with fish as seen by the fisherman. Probably the\r\nartist's friends at Lourdes captured fish in those days by spearing\r\nthem with serrated bone-headed fish spears or harpoons (Fig. 3). No\r\nfish hooks of bone have been found in the cave of Lortet or in others\r\nof like age, although needles and whistles of bone and other useful\r\nlittle instruments, as well as serrated spear heads and harpoons have\r\nbeen obtained in several of them.\r\n\r\nThe tool used by the prehistoric man in engraving the cylinder of\r\nstag's antler was undoubtedly a suitable chipped-out piece of flint–a\r\nflint graving tool, in fact a \"burin,\" such as are abundant in these\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.–Fragment of a roughly-painted vase of the\r\nDipylon age (_circa_ 800 B.C.) from Tiryns, figured by Schliemann and\r\ncited by Hörnes in his \"History of Pictorial Art in Europe.\" Compare\r\nthe fish between the horse's legs with the fish in the Lortet picture\r\nof the Three Deer; also note the lozenge-shaped designs (similar to the\r\npair above the big stag in the Lortet picture) near the fish and near\r\nthe man's head (_d_); and, further, the swastika (_s_).]\r\n\r\nAttention has been drawn by Hörnes in his \"History of Pictorial Art\r\nin Europe\" to the resemblance of the Lortet picture to a fragment of\r\na roughly painted vase of the Dipylon age (_circa_ 800 B.C.) found at\r\nTiryns and figured by Schliemann in his account of excavations made at\r\nthat ancient Mykenæan fortress of the Peloponese. The fragment (Fig.\r\n6) shows very roughly drawn figures of a man and of a horse. Between\r\nthe fore and hind legs of the horse a large elaborately ornate fish\r\nis represented, reminding us of the fishes between the deer's legs in\r\nthe Lortet picture. Two other similar fragments of pottery, showing\r\na fish in this position, are recorded by Schliemann. The drawing is\r\nconventional and careless. It is of a debased decorative character, and\r\nis very far removed from the careful nature-true work of the Lortet\r\ncave-man. It is not possible to trace by any known line of transmission\r\na connection between the engraving executed 20,000 years ago in the\r\ncaves of the Pyrénées and the figures rapidly knocked off in black\r\npaint on the Tiryns vase some 17,000 years later by the local dealers\r\nin cheap pottery. Yet we cannot avoid the suggestion that there is\r\nsome connection between the two designs. For the Tiryns painting shows\r\nnot only the curious upright fish between the horse's legs, but also\r\ndiamond-shaped figures–one marked _d_ in Fig. 6, another near the\r\nfish's tail, and another between the man's feet–closely resembling\r\nthe pair of diamond-shaped figures engraved above the neck of the big\r\nstag in the Lortet picture (see Figs. 4 and 5). As we do not know what\r\nthese diamond-shaped figures or \"lozenges\" are intended to signify\r\nin either case, we do not get, at present, beyond the bald fact of\r\ntheir coincidence. The Tiryns painting also shows (at _s_ in Fig. 6)\r\na \"swastika\" (see Chapter XVII), and below the man's arm a carelessly\r\ndrawn bit of the ancient wave-fret or key-pattern. It is, of course,\r\npossible that the tradition of an ancient design–even dating so far\r\nback in origin as many thousands of years–may be preserved in the\r\nuse made in the Tiryns decoration of the fish and the diamond-shaped\r\nlozenges, though associated with the swastika and the bit of wave-fret\r\nwhich are probably of later origin and are not known in the decorative\r\nwork of the cave-men. The Mykenæan decorative assimilation of geese to\r\nthe ship's barnacle exercised its influence over three thousand years\r\nand led to the mediæval belief in the hatching of young geese from\r\nbarnacles attached to floating timber, and even from the buds of trees\r\n(see my \"Diversions of a Naturalist\": Methuen, 1915). Nevertheless it\r\nmust not be supposed that the connection of the Lortet engraving and\r\nthe vase-painting of Tiryns is probable or more than a very remote\r\npossibility. The gap in time is too vast, and our present ignorance\r\nof what took place in that interval too complete, to warrant us in\r\nregarding the resemblance as more than a coincidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] \"L'Age du Renne,\" a posthumous work, with one hundred coloured\r\nquarto plates of objects in the Piette collection, is published by\r\nMasson, of Paris, and gives the complete list of Piette's numerous\r\nearlier papers, issued as his excavations proceeded.\r\n\r\n[2] Seven years ago the ape-like lower jaw and thick walled brain-case\r\ncalled \"Eoanthropus\" were discovered in a sparse gravel near Lewes in\r\nSussex. It is probably of older date than either the Neander men or\r\nthe Heidelberg men. See on this subject the chapters on \"The Missing\r\nLink\" in my \"Diversions of a Naturalist\" (1915) and those on \"The Most\r\nAncient Men\" and \"The Cave-men's Skulls\" in \"Science from an Easy\r\nChair. First Series\" (1910).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPORTRAITS OF MAMMOTHS BY MEN WHO SAW THEM\r\n\r\n\r\nSome fifty-five years ago pieces of reindeer's antler were discovered\r\nin the cave known as \"La Madeleine\" in the Dordogne (a department of\r\nFrance some eighty miles east of Bordeaux), upon which were engraved\r\nthe outlines of various animals such as reindeer and horses. They and\r\nthe bone spear-heads and needles, and the flint knives found with\r\nthem, were the first revelation to later man of the existence of the\r\nprehistoric cave-men. Among the carvings was a piece of ivory which\r\nexcited the profoundest interest. Partly hidden by a confused mass\r\nof scratches it showed the well-drawn outline of the great extinct\r\nelephant, thus scratched or \"engraved\" on a bit of its own tusk (Fig.\r\n7). The engraving was barely 5 in. long, and has been reproduced in\r\nmany books. The specimen is now in Paris, and was for long the only\r\nknown representation of the Mammoth by the ancient men who lived with\r\nit in Western Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.–Engraving of a mammoth drawn upon a piece of\r\nmammoth's ivory, found in the cave of La Madeleine in the Dordogne,\r\nin 1864. The specimen is in the Museum of Natural History, Paris. The\r\nengraving is here represented of the actual size.]\r\n\r\nDuring the last fifteen years, however, our knowledge of the works of\r\nart executed by these ancient men has increased to an extraordinary\r\nextent, chiefly owing to the energy and skill of the French explorers\r\nof the caverns in the south central region of that country. As long\r\nago as 1879 a little girl, the daughter of Señor Sautuolo–a proud\r\nwoman she should be if alive to-day–when visiting the cavern of\r\nAltamira, near Santander, in the north of Spain, with her father,\r\ndrew his attention to a number of \"pictures of animals,\" painted on\r\nthe rocky vault or roof of the cave. At first no one believed that\r\nthese pictures were more than a few hundred years old, whilst some held\r\nthem to be modern and made with fraudulent purpose. In 1887 Piette,\r\nthe distinguished French investigator of the remains of human work in\r\nthe caverns of the French Pyrénées (whose great illustrated book of\r\ncarved and engraved portions of reindeer antler, ivory, and stones\r\ndiscovered by his excavations, is a classic), declared that in his\r\nopinion the pictures of the Altamira cave were of the same age as the\r\nbone and ivory carvings of the Madeleine cave–that is to say, dated\r\nfrom what \"prehistorians\" call the later Palæolithic age, an age when\r\nthe mammoth, the bison, the cave lion, and the reindeer still existed\r\nin Western Europe, and when the British Isles were not yet separated by\r\nsea from the Continent. The age indicated is probably from 25,000 to\r\n50,000 years ago. Still, the opinion prevailed that the \"wall-drawings\"\r\nand \"roof-drawing\" of the Altamira cave were either mediæval or modern\r\nuntil the French explorers discovered wall-paintings in some of the\r\ncaves of the Dordogne. Then they proceeded to a careful investigation\r\nof the Altamira cave, and discovered conclusive evidence of the great\r\nage of the paintings by the removal of some of the undisturbed deposit\r\nin the cave, in which were found flint implements and small engravings\r\non bone, proving the deposit to be of the late Palæolithic age. When\r\nthis deposit was removed, pictures of animals, partly engraved and\r\npartly completed in colour (black, red, yellow, and white), were\r\nfound on the wall of the cave previously covered up by the deposit.\r\nM. Cartailhac, who had been a leading opponent of the view that the\r\nAltamira wall-pictures were very ancient, now renounced his former\r\nposition and became an enthusiastic investigator and exponent of these\r\npictures. M. Breuil, who had discovered wall-pictures, including those\r\nof the mammoth, in French caves, and had been met by disbelief and\r\neven suspicion, now received due recognition, and joined Cartailhac\r\nin preparing a complete account of the wall and roof pictures of the\r\nAltamira cave. The Prince of Monaco, who had carried out, with the\r\naid of French experts, an investigation of the caves on his property\r\nat Mentone, on the Mediterranean \"Riviera,\" undertook the expense\r\nof producing a splendid volume, giving coloured reproductions of\r\nthe Altamira pictures. To him the world is indebted, not only for\r\nmost important discoveries of human skeletons and objects of human\r\nworkmanship in the caves of Mentone (there are no wall-pictures\r\nthere), but for the publication in illustrated form of the Mentone\r\ndiscoveries and of those obtained in the Altamira cave. He has not\r\nrested at this stage of accomplishment, but has produced at his own\r\nexpense large volumes by MM. Breuil, Capitan, and Peyrony, illustrating\r\nand describing the discoveries made by them of wall-paintings and\r\nengravings of animals in the cave known as the \"Font de Gaume,\" in\r\nthe Dordogne. The Prince has also published a volume, by MM. Breuil,\r\nde Rio, and Sierra, reproducing the drawings found in a whole series\r\nof caves and rock-shelters in various parts of the Spanish peninsula,\r\nwhere the rock-painting race seems to have persisted to a somewhat\r\nlater period and to have painted, more frequently, pictures of human\r\nbeings as well as of animals. These, whilst less artistic and truthful\r\nthan those of the North Spanish and South French area, yet have\r\nsurpassing interest, since they have special similarity to ancient\r\nrock-paintings found in North Africa and to the rock-paintings of the\r\nBushmen of South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Monaco has finally established the great study in which\r\nhe has played so valuable a part by founding in Paris an \"Institute of\r\nHuman Palæontology\"; that is, \"of the study of prehistoric man,\" which\r\nhe has endowed with a magnificent building, comprising laboratories\r\nand residences for professors, together with funds to pay for its\r\nmaintenance and the proper publication of results. This he has done in\r\naddition to founding entirely at his own expense a similarly complete\r\nInstitute for the study of \"oceanography\"–the study of the living\r\ncontents and history of the great seas.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations in this chapter are (with the exception of Fig. 7)\r\ncopies, greatly reduced in size, of faithful representations of the\r\ngreat hairy elephant or mammoth which still survived in southern France\r\nin the days when the caves were occupied and decorated by men. I am\r\nindebted to the valuable little book \"Repertoire de l'Art Quatermaire,\"\r\nby M. Salomon Reinach, for these outlines carefully drawn by him from\r\nvarious large illustrations by the use of a tracing and reducing\r\ninstrument. In the next chapter I have given examples from the same\r\nsource of similar drawings of other animals.\r\n\r\nThere are five kinds of artistic work of Palæolithic age found in the\r\ncaverns of France and Spain; namely (1) small solid carvings (complete\r\nall round) in bone, ivory, or stone; (2) small engravings in sunk\r\noutline on similar material, rarely with relief of the outlined figure;\r\n(3) large stone statues, 2 ft. to 6 ft. across, in high relief, with\r\ncomplete modelling of the visible surface; (4) rock engravings and\r\npaintings on the walls and roofs of caverns or rock shelters, often\r\npartly outlined by engraving and scraping of the surface, and then\r\ncompleted in black or red paint or in several colours (black, red,\r\nyellow, white); they are of large size, from 2 to 5 ft. in cross\r\nmeasurement; (5) models in clay, one side only shown, the other resting\r\non rock; a few incomplete clay models of this nature representing the\r\nbison of about 2 ft. in length, have recently been discovered in one\r\nof the French caverns, and are the only examples of modelling in clay\r\nby the Palæolithic men yet discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.–Outline engravings of mammoths on the wall of\r\nthe cavern known as the \"Font de Gaume,\" near Eyzies (Dordogne). Each\r\nfigure is about 2 ft. long.]\r\n\r\nOur figures of the mammoth are (excepting Fig. 7) all of the\r\nfourth class–namely, rock-paintings in one colour (black or red)\r\npartly engraved and scraped. The originals are from 1½ ft. to 2½\r\nft. long. The mammoths given in Fig. 8 are carefully copied from\r\nengravings discovered, reproduced, and described by M. Breuil and his\r\nfellow-workers. They are on the walls of the cavern known as the \"Font\r\nde Gaume,\" in the commune of Tayac in the Dordogne. Those copied in\r\nFig. 9 and Fig. 10, A, were discovered on the walls of the cave of Les\r\nCombarelles in the same district.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.–Similar engravings from the neighbouring cave of\r\nCombarelles. The lower figure is an enlargement of the smaller of the\r\ntwo above it.]\r\n\r\nFig. 10, B, is from a cave at Bernifal, near les Eyzies, in the\r\nDordogne, and shows a mammoth enclosed in a triangular design, which is\r\nbelieved to represent a trap, or else a cage. Such triangular figures\r\nwith upright and also bent supports are found in various degrees of\r\nelaboration on both small and large engravings of this period, and are\r\ngenerally accepted as representing huts or enclosures supported by\r\nwooden poles. They are called \"tectiforms\" by the French explorers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.–_A_, similar engraving from the cave of\r\nCombarelles. _B_, Mammoth enclosed by plank-like structure–supposed to\r\nbe either a cage or a trap. (Called tectiform structures, and often\r\nseen in these wall engravings.) From the cave of Bernifal, five miles\r\nfrom Eyzies.]\r\n\r\nThe bones and teeth of the mammoth are very common in the river\r\ngravels and clays of Western Europe and England, and a complete skull,\r\nwith its tusks, dug up at Ilford, in the east of London, is in the\r\nNatural History Museum. Frozen carcasses of this animal are found in\r\nNorthern Siberia, and two showing much of the skin and hair are in\r\nthe museum of Petrograd. There is no tradition or knowledge of the\r\nmammoth among living races of men. The natives of Siberia, who have\r\nfrom time immemorial done a large trade in the ivory, regard the tusks\r\nas \"horns,\" and have stories about the ghosts of the mammoth, but no\r\ntradition of it as a living beast. The mammoth was closer to the Indian\r\nelephant of to-day than to the African one. It had, as these drawings\r\nshow, a pelt of long hair. Indian elephants from upland regions often\r\nhave a good deal of hair all over the body: and the newborn young of\r\nboth the Indian and African elephant has a complete coat of hair. The\r\ndrawings here reproduced are not only of thrilling interest because\r\nthey are the work of remotely ancient men who lived with and observed\r\nmammoths in the south of France, but also because they show an\r\nextraordinary skill in \"sketching\"–in giving the essential lines of the\r\ncreature portrayed and in reproducing the artist's \"impression.\" These\r\nartists were \"impressionists\"–the earliest and most sincere–without\r\nself-consciousness or other purpose than that of making line and colour\r\ntruly register and indicate their vivid impressions. It is interesting\r\nto note that (as in other works of art showing true artistic gift)\r\nactual error in drawing (for instance, in the size and shape of\r\nthe eye and the placing of the two tusks on the same side of the\r\ntrunk–possibly due to the unfinished state of the drawing) sometimes\r\naccompanies the most penetrating observation and skilful delineation of\r\nthe characteristic form and pose of the animal. Probably mammoths were\r\ngetting rare in the south of France when these drawings were made, and\r\nwere not so familiar in all their details to the artist as were bison,\r\nhorse, and deer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF PREHISTORIC MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe works of art produced by the cave-men are, as we have already\r\nseen, of five kinds or classes–(1) All-round small statuettes, or\r\n\"high-relief\" carvings, in ivory, bone, or stone (examples of which are\r\nshown in Figs. 14, 25, 26, 27, 28 of the present chapter); (2) small\r\nengravings on bits of ivory, deer's antler, bone, or stone (examples\r\nare shown in Figs. 15, 16, 20, and 24); (3) large statues, hewn in\r\nrock, and left in place; (4) drawings of large size–two to five feet in\r\ndiameter (partly engraved and partly coloured) on the rocky walls and\r\nvaults of limestone caverns (shown in Figs. 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 19, 23,\r\nas well as in the figures of mammoths in the last chapter); (5) models\r\n(high relief) worked in clay. I give reproductions in the present\r\nchapter of several samples of this art, showing how skilfully these men\r\nof 50,000 years ago could portray a variety of animals.\r\n\r\nWho were these men, and why did they make these remarkable carvings\r\nand drawings? First, as to their age. We now know of a long succession\r\nof human inhabitants of this part of the world, namely, Western\r\nEurope. The earliest reach back to an antiquity never dreamed of fifty\r\nyears ago. We cannot fix with any certainty the number of thousands,\r\nor hundreds of thousands, of years which is represented by this\r\nsuccession, but we can place the different periods in order, one later\r\nthan the other, each distinguished chiefly by the character of the\r\nworkmanship belonging to it, though in a few instances we have also\r\nthe actual limb-bones, skulls, and jaw-bones of the men themselves,\r\nwhich differ in different periods. It is practically certain that these\r\nprehistoric successive periods of humanity do not represent the steps\r\nof growth and change of one single race belonging to this part of the\r\nworld, but that successive races have arrived on the scene of Western\r\nEurope from other parts, and it is usually very difficult even to guess\r\nwhere they came from and where they went to!\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to divide the human epoch, the time which has elapsed\r\nsince man definitely took shape as man–characterized by his large\r\nbrain, small teeth, upright carriage, and large opposable thumb and\r\nstill larger and more peculiar non-opposable great toe–into the\r\nhistoric and the prehistoric sections. In this part of the world\r\n(Europe) the first use of metals (first of all copper, then bronze,\r\nand then iron), as the material for the fabrication of implements and\r\ntools of all kinds, occurs just on the line between the historic and\r\nthe prehistoric sections; that is to say, between those times of which\r\nwe know something by tradition and writing, and those earlier times\r\nof which we have no record and no tradition, but concerning which we\r\nhave to make out what we can by searching the refuse heaps and ruins\r\nof man's dwelling-places and carefully collecting such of his \"works\"\r\nas have not utterly perished, whilst noting which lie deeper in the\r\nground, which above and which below the others.\r\n\r\nPractically the men of the prehistoric ages in Europe had not the use\r\nof metals (though our quasi-historical records go back to a less remote\r\ntime in many parts of Europe than they do in Greece, Assyria, and\r\nEgypt). The prehistoric peoples are spoken of as the men of the Stone\r\nAge, because they used stone, chiefly flint, as many savage races do\r\nto-day, as the material from which they fabricated by means of deftly\r\nstruck blows all sorts of implements. Undoubtedly they also, by aid of\r\nstone knives, saws and planes, made weapons and other implements of\r\nwood and of the horns, bones, and teeth of animals. But these latter\r\nsubstances are perishable, and have only been preserved from decay\r\nunder special circumstances, such as their inclusion in the deposits on\r\nthe floors of caverns.\r\n\r\nThe Stone Age is itself readily and obviously divisible into two\r\nperiods. The latter is a comparatively very short and recent period,\r\nwhen great skill in chipping flints and other stones was attained,\r\nand the implements so shaped were often rubbed on large stones of\r\nvery hard material (siliceous grit), so as to polish their surfaces.\r\nThis is the \"Neolithic,\" or later Stone, period, and extends back\r\nin Europe certainly to 7000 B.C., and probably a few thousand years\r\nfurther. Passing further back than this, we leave what are called\r\n\"recent\" deposits, and come to those associated with great changes\r\nof the earth's surface. We enter upon \"geological\" time, and vastly\r\nchanged climatic and geographical conditions. We are in the older Stone\r\nperiod, called the \"Palæolithic period.\" It is not really comparable\r\nto the \"Neolithic,\" since it comprises many successive ages of man,\r\nand, although called the \"Palæolithic\" or \"ancient Stone\" period, has\r\nno unity, but, whilst readily divisible into several sub-periods or\r\nepochs of comparatively late date, stretches back into immense geologic\r\nantiquity indicated by flint implements of special and diverse types,\r\nwhich are found in definitely ascertained geologic horizons.\r\n\r\nThe Pleistocene strata–the latest of the geologists' list–are the\r\nriver gravels of existing river valleys, the deposits in many caves,\r\nand the sands and clays piled up by ice action during the repeated\r\nglacial extensions or epochs of glaciation which alternated with milder\r\nclimate for many thousands of years over north and middle Europe. It\r\nis identical with the Palæolithic period, which, however, probably\r\nextends beyond it into the Pliocene and even further back. In the\r\nlater deposits of the Pleistocene, which necessarily have been less\r\nfrequently disturbed and re-deposited than the older ones, we find\r\nmore numerous remains of man's handwork, and in less disturbed order\r\nof succession, than in the older deposits. Lately we have obtained in\r\nEast Anglia beautifully-worked flint implements–the rostro-carinate, or\r\neagle's beaks–from below shelly marine deposits–the Red Crag of Suffolk\r\nand the Norwich Crag–the oldest beds of the Pleistocene. They were made\r\nby men who _lived_ in the Pliocene period, and carry the ancient Stone\r\nperiod of man back to a much earlier period than was admitted nine\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nThe Pleistocene series or \"system\" of strata–also called the\r\n\"Quaternary\" to mark its distinction from the underlying long series\r\nof \"Tertiary\" strata–does not comprise the actual surface-deposits\r\nin which the remains of Neolithic man are found. It is usual, though\r\nperhaps not altogether logical, to separate these as \"Recent\" and\r\nto begin the long enumeration of \"geologic\" strata after a certain\r\ninterval when the relative levels of land and sea and the depth of\r\nriver-valleys were not precisely what they are to-day, and the human\r\ninhabitants of Western Europe were hunters using rough unpolished flint\r\nimplements–in fact, when the \"Palæolithic\" period of human culture had\r\nnot given place to the \"Neolithic,\" which was after some ten thousand\r\nyears itself to be superseded by the age of metals. \"Prehistorians,\"\r\nthe students of prehistoric man–divide the Pleistocene series of\r\ndeposits with a view to a systematic conception of the successive\r\nchanges of man and his surroundings during the period occupied by\r\ntheir deposition, into an upper, a middle and a lower group–and\r\nfurther have distinguished certain successive \"horizons\" in these\r\ngroups–characterized by the remains of man and animals which they\r\ncontain. They are exhibited in the tabular statement here given in\r\nthe ascertained order of their succession, and are represented in the\r\nsouthern part of Britain as well as in France.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORIZONS OR EPOCHS OF THE PLEISTOCENE OR QUATERNARY SYSTEM\r\n\r\n     _A._ UPPER PLEISTOCENE (post-glacial; also called epoch of the\r\n     Reindeer).\r\n\r\n     1. _The Azilian:_ (Elapho-Tarandian of Piette) nearest to\r\n           the Neolithic section of the Recent Period and more or less\r\n           transitional to that period; named after the cavern of the\r\n           Mas d'Azil in the department of the Ariège. The Reindeer had\r\n           largely given place to the great Red Deer (Cervus elephus).\r\n\r\n     2. _The Magdelenian:_ named after the cave of La Madeleine in the\r\n           Dordogne.\r\n\r\n     3. _The Solutrian:_ after Solutré near Macon.\r\n\r\n     4. _The Aurignacian:_ after the grotto of Aurignac in the Haute\r\n           Garonne.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _B._ MIDDLE PLEISTOCENE (period of the last great extension of\r\n     glaciers).\r\n\r\n     1. _The Moustierian:_ so named after the cave of Le Moustier in\r\n           Dordogne; the epoch of the Neander men. Also called the\r\n           \"epoch of the Mammoth,\" whilst the upper Pleistocene is\r\n           called the epoch of the Reindeer, though the Mammoth still\r\n           survived then in reduced numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _C._ LOWER PLEISTOCENE (inter-glacial and early glacial, also\r\n           called period of the Hippopotamus and of Elephas antiquus\r\n           and Rhinoceros Merckii).\r\n\r\n     1. _The Chellian:_ named after Chelles on the upper Seine, river\r\n           gravels and sands earlier than the Moustierian. Large\r\n           tongue-shaped flint implements, flaked on both surfaces–the\r\n           later and better-finished classed as \"Acheulæan,\" after St.\r\n           Acheul, near Amiens.\r\n\r\n     2, 3, 4 ... various fluviatile and lacustrine gravels, sands and\r\n           clays divisible into separate successive horizons, as well\r\n           as marine deposits, some of glacial origin–including the\r\n           mid-glacial gravel, the boulder clays and shelly Red Crag\r\n           and Norwich Crag (but _not_ the underlying \"Coralline\" Crag,\r\n           which must be classed with the Pliocene). The relations of\r\n           the marine deposits to the older river-gravels and\r\n           fresh-water deposits, and to the earlier periods of glacial\r\n           extension indicated by the glacial moraines of central\r\n           Europe, have not been, as yet, satisfactorily determined.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the sedimentary deposits of the earth's crust belonging\r\nto the Pleistocene or Quaternary Period–about 250 feet in thickness–is\r\nexceedingly small, and represents a surprisingly short space of time\r\nas compared with that indicated by the vast thickness of underlying\r\ndeposits. It has nevertheless been possible to study and classify\r\nthe \"horizons\" of this latest very short period minutely because the\r\ndeposits are easily excavated, and having been more recently \"laid\r\ndown\" have not suffered so much subsequent breaking up and destruction\r\nas have the older strata; and further, because they embed at certain\r\nlevels and in favourable situations an abundance of well-preserved\r\nbones and teeth of animals and the implements and carvings in stone and\r\nbone made by man. It is worth while to look at this matter a little\r\nmore exactly.\r\n\r\nThe total thickness of sedimentary deposits–that is, deposit laid down\r\nby the action of water on the earth's surface, and now estimated by\r\nthe measurement of strata lying one over the other in various parts of\r\nthe globe–tilted and exposed to view so that we can trace out their\r\norder of super-position–is about 130,000 feet. The lower half of this\r\nhuge deposit contains no fossilized remains of the living things\r\nwhich were present in the waters which laid it down; they were soft,\r\nprobably shell-less and boneless, and so no fossilized trace of them\r\nis preserved. Thus we divide the sedimentary crust into 65,000 feet of\r\n\"archaic\" non-fossiliferous deposit, and an overlying 65,000 feet of\r\nfossil-containing deposits.\r\n\r\nThe earliest remains of living things known are not very different\r\nfrom marine creatures of to-day; they are the strange shrimp-like\r\nTrilobites and the Lingula-shells found in the lower Cambrian rocks of\r\nWales. Over them lie 65,000 feet of sedimentary deposit teaming with\r\nfossils–the petrified remains of animals and plants. The Trilobites\r\nand the Lingulas must have had a long series of ancestors leading up to\r\nthem from the simplest beginnings of life–for they are highly organized\r\ncreatures. But no trace of those ancestors is preserved in the 65,000\r\nfeet of sedimentary rock underlying the earliest fossils.\r\n\r\nThis great basal mass of non-fossiliferous deposit is called \"the\r\nArchæan series.\" The 65,000 feet of deposit _above_ it are divided by\r\ngeologists into three very unequal series. The first and lowest is the\r\nPrimary or Palæozoic series, occupying the enormous thickness of 52,000\r\nfeet; above these we have the Secondary or Mesozoic series of 10,000\r\nfeet, and lastly, bringing us to recent time, we have the Tertiary or\r\nCainozoic of only 3000 feet. These three series amount in all to 65,000\r\nfeet. The Palæozoic series is more than five times as thick as the\r\nMesozoic, and these two taken together are twenty times the thickness\r\nof the Tertiary. Each series is divided by geologists into a series\r\nof systems, distinguished by the fossils they contain, which, on the\r\nwhole, indicate animals of a higher degree of evolution as we ascend\r\nthe series.\r\n\r\nThe Palæozoic series include the vast thicknesses of the Cambrian, the\r\nOrdovician, the Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian systems.\r\nThe first \"trilobite\" is found in the lowest Cambrian rocks, and the\r\nlast or most recent existed in the Permian period–after 50,000 feet\r\nof rock had been deposited. None are known of later age. The first\r\nfossil remains of a vertebrate are found in the uppermost beds of\r\nthe Silurian–in \"beds\" (that is to say, stratified rocks) which are\r\njust _half-way_ in position so far as the measurable thickness of the\r\ndeposits are concerned, between the earliest Cambrian fossils and the\r\nsediments of the present day. To put it another way, 34,000 feet of\r\nfossiliferous rock precede the stratum (upper Silurian) in which the\r\nearliest remains of vertebrates are found. These first vertebrates to\r\nappear (others soft and destructible preceded them) are fishes–a group\r\nwhich, apart from this fact, are shown by their structure to present\r\nthe ancestral form of all the vertebrate classes. In later Palæozoic\r\nbeds we find the remains of four-legged creatures like our living newts\r\nand salamanders. The Secondary or Mesozoic series is divided into the\r\nTriassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous systems. It ends with the familiar\r\nchalk deposit of this part of the world, and is often called the age\r\nof Reptiles, because large reptiles abounded in this period. The\r\nTertiary or Cainozoic series are divided into the Eocene, Oligocene,\r\nMiocene, Pliocene and Pleistocene systems. The huge reptiles disappear\r\nand their place is taken by an endless variety of warm-blooded, hairy\r\nanimals–the Mammals–small at first, but in later beds often of great\r\nsize. As we pass upwards from the Eocene we can trace the ancestry of\r\nour living Mammals such as the horse, rhinoceros, pig and elephant in\r\nsuccessive forms. Complete skeletons are preserved in the rocks and\r\nshow a gradual transition from the more primitive Eocene kinds–through\r\nMiocene and Pliocene modifications–until in the Pleistocene strata\r\nmany of the species now inhabiting the earth's surface are found. A\r\nnumber of horizons, characterized by the special mammalian and other\r\nanimal remains preserved in them, are distinguished by geologists in\r\neach of the \"systems\" of sands, clays and harder beds known as Eocene,\r\nOligocene, Miocene and Pliocene. At last we arrive at the latest\r\nor most recent 250 feet of deposit, consisting of sand, clay and\r\ngravel. This is called \"Pleistocene.\" It is only a very small fraction\r\n(¹/₂₆₀th) of the thickness of the whole fossil-bearing sedimentary\r\ncrust of the earth–about the proportion of the thickness of a common\r\npaving-stone to the whole height of Shakespeare's cliff at Dover. This\r\nPleistocene or post-glacial Tertiary–often now called Quaternary–has\r\nbeen so carefully examined that we divide it as shown on page 39 into\r\nupper, middle and lower, and each of these divisions into successive\r\nhorizons (only a few feet thick) characterized by the remains of\r\ndifferent species of animals and often by the differing implements and\r\ncarvings as well as the bones of successive races of men.\r\n\r\nWhen we are concerned with written history, ancient Egypt seems to\r\nbe of vast and almost appalling antiquity; on the other hand, if we\r\nstudy the cave-men, ancient Egypt becomes relatively modern, and the\r\nfirst cold period and extension of glaciers, which 500,000 years ago\r\nmarked the passage from Pliocene to Pleistocene, becomes our familiar\r\nexample of something belonging to the remote past–beyond or below\r\nwhich we rarely let our thoughts wander. That is a natural result of\r\nconcentration on a special study. But it has had the curious result,\r\nin many cases, of making students of ancient man unwilling to admit\r\nthe discovery of evidences of the existence of man at an earlier date\r\nthan that which belongs to the deposits and remains to which their\r\nlife-long studies have been confined and upon which their thought is\r\nconcentrated. The last 500,000 years of the earth's vicissitudes, which\r\nresulted in the 250 feet of \"Pleistocene\" deposit and the marvellous\r\ntreasures of early humanity embedded in them, form but a trivial\r\npostscript to the great geological record which precedes it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.–Horse (wall engraving), cave of Marsoulas,\r\nHaute Garonne. The drawing suggests the Southern less heavy breed as\r\ncompared with Figs. 12 and 13.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.–Horse (wall engraving) outlined in black, cave\r\nof Niaux (Ariège).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.–Horses: _A_, wall engraving (cave of Hornos de\r\nla Péna). _B_, wall engraving from cavern of Combarelles. _C_, engraved\r\non reindeer antler (Mas d'Azil). Note the halter in _A_ and in _C_;\r\nalso note the heavy head and face of _B_ like that of Prejalvski's\r\nhorse.]\r\n\r\nNo estimate can be made of the time represented by the 65,000 feet\r\nof fossiliferous strata known to us and the same thickness of\r\nnon-fossiliferous deposit which precedes them. There are no facts known\r\nupon which a calculation of the related lapse of time can be based.\r\nBut most geologists would agree that whilst we have good ground for\r\nassigning half a million years to the formation of the Pleistocene\r\nstrata, it is not an unreasonable supposition that the period required\r\nfor the formation of the fossiliferous rocks which precede them in\r\ntime, is not less and probably more than five hundred million years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.–Drawing (of the actual size of the original)\r\nof a flat carving in shoulder-bone of a horse's head, showing twisted\r\nrope-bridle and trappings. _a_ appears to represent a flat ornamented\r\nband of wood or skin connecting the muzzling rope _b_ with other pieces\r\n_c_ and _d_. This specimen is from the cave of St. Michel d'Arudy, and\r\nis of the Reindeer period. This, and others like it are in the same\r\nmuseum of St. Germain.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.–Drawing (of the actual size of the original) of\r\na fully rounded carving in reindeer's antler of the head of a neighing\r\nhorse. The head resembles that of the Mongolian horse. This is one of\r\nthe most artistic of the cave-men's carvings yet discovered. It is of\r\nthe Palæolithic age (early Reindeer period), probably not less than\r\n50,000 years old. It was found in the cavern of Mas d'Azil, Ariège,\r\nFrance, and is now in the museum of St. Germain.]\r\n\r\nThe pictures and carvings with which we are for the moment concerned\r\nall belong to the _later_ Pleistocene or Reindeer epoch. None have been\r\nfound in the middle and earlier Pleistocene, though finely-chipped\r\nflints of several successive types are found in those earlier beds.\r\nSo that it is clear that many successive ages of man had elapsed\r\nin Western Europe before these pictures–immensely ancient as they\r\nare–were executed. The men who made these works of art had ages of\r\nhumanity, tradition, and culture (of a kind) behind them. Yet they\r\nwere themselves tens of thousands of years earlier than the ancient\r\nEgyptians!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.–Reindeer engraving on schist, small size\r\n(cavern of Laugerie basse).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.–Rhinoceros in red outline (2½ feet long),\r\ndrawn on the wall of the cavern of Font de Gaume.]\r\n\r\nOur illustrations show a variety of drawings and carvings. It appears\r\nprobable that the primitive intention of ancient man in depicting\r\nanimals was \"to work magic\" on those which he hunted. This is the case\r\nat the present day among many \"savage\" races. The drawings of bisons\r\nin Fig. 19 are from the walls of the cavern of Font de Gaume, in the\r\nDordogne, and are about 5 ft. long, partly engraved and scraped, partly\r\noutlined in black, and coloured. The body is often coloured in red,\r\nwhite and black, so as to give a true representation of the masses\r\nof hair and surface contours. A specially well preserved painting of\r\nthis kind–from the cavern of Altamira–is shown in Fig. 18, where the\r\ncolours of the original–black, red, and brown, and white are indicated\r\nby the varied shading. These drawings, like those of the mammoths\r\nfigured in the last chapter, are found in the recesses of caverns where\r\nno daylight reaches them, and must have been executed and viewed by\r\naid of torch or lamp-light. They probably were exhibited as part of a\r\nceremony connected with witchcraft and magic. These, like the mammoths\r\nand all the specimens figured here, were executed in the Reindeer,\r\nor later Pleistocene period. The exact \"horizon\" of each is, as a\r\nrule, well ascertained, but there is uncertainty as to whether some\r\nspecimens should be attributed to the Aurignacian or to the Magdalenian\r\nhorizon–and as to whether work by men of the Magdalenian race is not\r\nin some cases associated in the cave deposits with that by the earlier\r\nnegroid Aurignacians.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.–Bison from the roof of the cavern of Altamira:\r\nengraved, and also painted in three colours (5 feet long).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.–Bison: wall engravings (5 feet long) filled in\r\nwith colour (Font de Gaume).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.–Bear: engraved on stalagmite, from the cave of\r\nTeyjat near Eyzies.

Fig. 12 is drawn in black on\r\nthe wall of a cave at Niaux (Ariège), and Fig. 11 is a similar drawing\r\nfrom a cave in the Haute Garonne. Both are remarkable for the exact\r\nrepresentation of natural poses of the horse. Figs. 13, A and B, are\r\nalso from the walls of caves. The latter is remarkable for the large\r\nhead, short mane, and thick muzzle, which closely correspond with the\r\nsame parts in the existing wild horse of the Gobi desert in Tartary (to\r\nbe seen alive in the Zoological Gardens in London). The horse drawn in\r\nFig. 11 seems to belong to a distinct race, suggesting the Southern\r\n\"Arab\" horse rather than the heavier and more clumsy horse of the Gobi\r\ndesert. Fig. 13, C, is engraved of the size here given, on a piece of\r\nreindeer's antler. It is remarkable for the halter-like ring around the\r\nmuzzle. A similar cord or rope is seen in Fig. 12 and in Fig. 13, A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.–Goose: small engraving on reindeer antler\r\n(Gourdan).]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable horses' heads obtained are those drawn (of the\r\nactual size of the carvings) in Figs. 14 and 15. Fig. 14 is from the\r\ncave of St. Michael d'Arudy, engraved on a flat piece of shoulder-bone.\r\nIt shows what can only be interpreted as some kind of \"halter,\" made\r\napparently of twisted rope (_b_, _c_, _d_), disposed about the animal's\r\nhead, whilst a broad, flat piece ornamented with angular marks is\r\nattached at the regions marked \"_a_.\" This and other drawings similar\r\nto Fig. 13, C (of which there are many), go far to prove that these\r\nearly men had mastered the horse and put a kind of bridle on his head.\r\nFig. 15 is a solid all-round carving in reindeer's antler from the\r\ncave of Mas d'Azil, Ariège (France). The original is of this size, and\r\nis supposed to be one of the oldest and yet is the most artistic yet\r\ndiscovered, and worthy to compare with the horses of the Parthenon.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 20 we have a wonderful outline of a bear engraved on a piece\r\nof stone, from the cave of Teyjat, in the Dordogne; Fig. 22, the head\r\nof a wolf on the wall of the cave of Combarelles, Dordogne; Fig.\r\n23, lion (mane-less), engraved on the wall of the same cave; Fig.\r\n21, small bear, engraved on a pebble; Fig. 24, a duck engraved on a\r\npiece of reindeer's antler (Gourdan, Haute Garonne); Fig. 17, the\r\nsquare-mouthed, two-horned rhinoceros, drawn in red (ochre) outline on\r\nthe wall of the cavern of the Font de Gaume. This drawing is 2½ ft.\r\nlong. In successful characterization the bear (Fig. 20), the wolf (Fig.\r\n22), and the feline (Fig. 23) far surpass any of the attempts at animal\r\ndrawing made by modern savages, such as the Bushmen of South Africa,\r\nCalifornian Indians, and Australian black fellows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.–Female figure carved in oolitic limestone from\r\nWillendorf near Krems, Lower Austria (1908). Half the size (linear) of\r\nthe original.]\r\n\r\nFig. 27 is an outline sketch of a rock-carved statue, 18 in. high,\r\nproved by the kind of flint implements found with it to be of\r\nAurignacian age. It was discovered on a rubble-covered face of a\r\nrock-cliff at Laussel, in the Dordogne, by M. Lalanne. The woman\r\nholds a bovine horn in her right hand. The face is obliterated by\r\n\"weathering.\" Four other human statues were found in the same place,\r\none a male, much broken, but obviously standing in the position taken\r\nby (Fig. 28) a man throwing a spear or drawing a bow.[3] Near these\r\nwere found a frieze of life-sized horses carved in high relief on the\r\nrock. These are the only statues of any size, executed by the Reindeer\r\nmen, yet discovered.\r\n\r\nThe representations of men are rare among these earliest works of art,\r\nand less successfully carried out than those of animals. But several\r\nsmall statuettes of women in bone, ivory, and stone of the early\r\nAurignacian horizon are known. They suggest, by their form of body,\r\naffinity with the Bushmen race of to-day (Fig. 25). The all-round\r\ncarving of a female head (Fig. 26) also suggests Ethiopian affinities\r\nin the dressing of the hair. Some regard this hair-like head-dress as\r\na cap. Here and there badly executed outline engravings of men, some\r\napparently wearing masks, have been discovered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.–Drawing (of the actual size of the original)\r\nof an ivory carving (fully rounded) of a female head. The specimen\r\nwas found in the cavern of Brassempouy, in the Landes. It is of the\r\nearliest Reindeer period, and the arrangement of the hair or cap is\r\nremarkable.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the \"Reindeer men\" were skilful in devising decorative\r\ndesign–not representing actual natural objects–is shown by the carving\r\ndrawn in Fig. 29 and in many others like it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.–Seated figure of a woman holding a bovine horn\r\nin the right hand; high relief carved on a limestone rock; about 18\r\ninches high.

Lalanne with that drawn in Fig. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe later horizons of the Reindeer period or Upper Pleistocene yield\r\nsome beautiful outline engravings of red deer and reindeer (Fig. 16)\r\non antler-bone, as well as of other animals. One celebrated carving I\r\nhave described in the first chapter of this book. It is now regarded\r\nas probable that whilst the art of the Aurignacians persisted and\r\ndeveloped in the South of France and North-West of Spain until and\r\nduring the time of the Magdalenian horizon, yet a distinct race,\r\nwith a different style of art, spread through South-East Spain\r\nand also from Italy into that region, and affected injuriously the\r\n\"naturalistic\" Aurignacian art, and superseded it in Azilian and\r\nNeolithic times. We find late drawings (Azilian age?) in some of the\r\neast Spanish caves of a very much simplified character, small human\r\nfigures armed with bow and arrow, and others reduced to geometric or\r\nmere symbolic lines derived from human and animal form (see Fig. 52, p.\r\n206). The latest studies of Breuil on this subject tend to throw light\r\nby aid of these simplified inartistic and symbolic drawings on the\r\nmigrations of very early races in the south and south-east of Europe,\r\nand to connect them perhaps with North African contemporary races. The\r\nsubject is as difficult as it is fascinating.

Reinach relates (\"Repertoire de l'Art Quatermaire\") that two of\r\nthese statues were in 1912 deliberately stolen by the German Verworn\r\nprofessor of Physiology in Bonn, who repaid the hospitality of M.\r\nLalanne by bribing his workman and secretly carrying off these valuable\r\nspecimens to Germany, where (it is stated) they were sold to the museum\r\nof Berlin for a large sum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nVESUVIUS IN ERUPTION\r\n\r\n\r\nAt intervals of ten to twenty years the best-known volcano in the\r\nworld–Vesuvius, on the Bay of Naples–has in the last two centuries\r\nburst into eruption, and the probability of the recurrence of this\r\nviolent state of activity, at no distant date, render some account of\r\nmy own acquaintance with that great and wonderful thing seasonable.\r\nWe inhabitants of the West of Europe have little personal experience\r\nof earthquakes, and still less of volcanoes, for there is not in the\r\nBritish Islands even an \"extinct\" volcanic cone to remind us of the\r\nterrible forces held down beneath our feet by the crust of the earth.\r\nIn regions as near as the Auvergne of Central France and the Eiffel,\r\nclose to the junction of the Moselle with the Rhine, there are complete\r\nvolcanic craters whose fiery origin is recognized even by the local\r\npeasantry. They are, however, regarded by these optimist folk as the\r\nproducts of ancient fires long since burnt out. The natives have as\r\nlittle apprehension of a renewed activity of their volcanoes as we have\r\nof the outburst of molten lava and devastating clouds of ashes and\r\npoisonous vapour from the top of Primrose Hill. Nevertheless, the hot\r\nsprings and gas issuing from fissures in the Auvergne show that the\r\nsubterranean fires are not yet closed down, and may at any day burst\r\nagain into violent activity.\r\n\r\nSuch also was the happy indifference with which from time immemorial\r\nthe Greek colonists and other earlier and later inhabitants of the\r\nrich and beautiful shores of the Neapolitan bay before the fateful year\r\nA.D. 79, had regarded the low crater-topped mountain called Vesuvius\r\nor Vesbius, as well as the great circular forest-grown or lake-holding\r\ncups near Cumæ and the Cape Misenum, at the northern end of the\r\nbay–known to-day as the Solfatara, Astroni, Monti Grillo, Barbaro, and\r\nCigliano–and the lakes Lucrino, Averno, and Agnano. These together with\r\nthe Monte Nuovo–which suddenly rose from the sea near Baiæ in 1538 and\r\nas suddenly disappeared–constitute \"the Phlegræan fields.\" Vesuvius was\r\nloftier than any one of the Phlegræan craters, and the gentle slope\r\nby which it rose from the sea level to a height of nearly 3700 ft.\r\nhad, as now, a circumference of ten miles. It did not terminate in a\r\n\"cone,\" as in later ages, but in a depressed, circular, forest-covered\r\narea measuring a mile across, which was the ancient crater. A drawing\r\nshowing the shape of the mountain at this period is the work of the\r\nlate Prof. Phillips of Oxford (Fig. 30). The soil formed around and\r\nupon the ancient lava-streams of Vesuvius appears to have been always\r\nespecially fertile, so that flourishing towns and villages occupied\r\nits slopes, and the ports of Herculaneum, Pompeii, and Stabiæ were\r\nthe seats of a busy and long-established population. The existence of\r\nactive volcanoes at no great distance from Vesuvius was, however, well\r\nknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The great Sicilian mountain,\r\nEtna–more than 10,000 ft. in height, rising from a base of ninety\r\nmiles in circumference–and the Lipari Islands, such as Stromboli and\r\nVolcano, were for many centuries in intermittent activity before the\r\nfirst recorded eruption of Vesuvius–that of A.D. 79–and great eruptions\r\nare recorded as having occurred in the mountain mass of the island of\r\nIschia, close to the Bay of Naples, in the fifth, third, and first\r\ncenturies B.C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.–Vesuvius as it appeared before the eruption of\r\nAugust 24, A.D. 79. From a sketch by Prof. Phillips, F.R.S.]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the outburst of Vesuvius in A.D. 79 and its re-entrance\r\ninto a state of activity came upon the unfortunate population around it\r\nas an absolutely unexpected thing. At least a thousand years–probably\r\nseveral thousand years–had passed since Vesuvius had become \"extinct.\"\r\nAll tradition of its prehistoric activity had disappeared, though\r\nthe learned Greek traveller Strabo had pointed out the indications\r\nit presented of having been once a seat of consuming fire. From\r\nA.D. 63 there were during sixteen years frequent earthquakes in its\r\nneighbourhood, which, as we know by records and inscriptions, caused\r\nserious damage to the towns around it, and then suddenly, on the night\r\nof Aug. 24, A.D. 79, vast explosions burst from its summit. A huge\r\nblack cloud of fine dust and cinders, lasting for three days, spread\r\nfrom it for twenty miles around, streams of boiling mud poured down\r\nits sides, and in a few hours covered the city of Herculaneum, whilst\r\na dense shower of hot volcanic dust completely buried the gay little\r\nseaside resort known as Pompeii. Many thousand persons perished,\r\nchoked by the vapours or overwhelmed by the hot cinders or engulfed in\r\nthe boiling mud.\r\n\r\nThe great naturalist Pliny was in command of the fleet at Cape Misenum,\r\nand went by ship across the bay to render assistance to the inhabitants\r\nof the towns at the foot of Vesuvius. Pliny's nephew wrote two letters\r\nto the historian Tacitus, giving an account of these events and of\r\nthe remarkable courage and coolness of his uncle, who, after sleeping\r\nthe night at Stabiæ, was suffocated by the sulphurous vapours as he\r\nadvanced into the open country near the volcano. The friends who were\r\nwith him left him to his fate and made their escape. The younger Pliny\r\nhad prudently remained, out of danger, with his mother at Misenum.\r\n\r\nThe alternating periods of activity and of rest exhibited by volcanoes\r\nseem to us capricious, and even at the present day are not sufficiently\r\nwell understood to enable us to discern any order or regularity in\r\ntheir succession. Vesuvius is a thousand centuries old, and we have\r\nonly known it for thirty. We cannot expect to get the time-table of its\r\nactivities on so brief an acquaintance. Strangely enough, Vesuvius,\r\nhaving, after immemorial silence, spasmodically burst into eruption\r\nand spread devastation around it, resumed its slumber for many years.\r\nThere is no mention of its activity for 130 years after A.D. 79. Then\r\nit growled and sent forth steam and cinder-dust to an extent sufficient\r\nto attract attention again; its efforts were thereafter recorded once\r\nor so in a century, though little, if any, harm was done by it. In A.D.\r\n1139 there was a great throwing-up of dust and stones, with steam,\r\nwhich reflected the light of molten lava within the crater, and looked\r\nlike flames. And then for close on 500 years there was little, if any,\r\nsign of activity. The \"eruptions\" between that of A.D. 79 and that of\r\nA.D. 1139 had been ejections of steam and cinders, unaccompanied by\r\nany flow or stream of lava. Then suddenly the whole business shut up\r\nfor 500 years, and after that–also quite suddenly–in 1631, a really big\r\neruption took place, exceeding in volume the catastrophe of Pliny's\r\ndate. Not only were columns of dust and vapour ejected to a height of\r\nmany miles, but several streams of white-hot lava overflowed the edge\r\nof the crater and reached the seacoast, destroying towns and villages\r\non the way. Some of these lava-streams were five miles broad, and can\r\nbe studied at the present day. As many as 18,000 persons were killed.\r\n\r\nThere were three more eruptions in the seventeenth century, and from\r\nthat date there set in a period of far more frequent outbursts, which\r\nhave continued to our own times. In the eighteenth century there were\r\ntwenty-three distinct eruptions, lasting each from a few hours to two\r\nor three days, and of varying degrees of violence–a vast steam-jet\r\nforcing up cinders and stones from the crater into the air, usually\r\naccompanied by the outflow of lava, from cracks in sides of the crater,\r\nin greater or less quantity. In the nineteenth century there were\r\ntwenty-five distinct eruptions, the most formidable of which were those\r\nof 1822, 1834, and 1872. All of the eruptions of Vesuvius in the last\r\n280 years have been carefully described, and most of them recorded\r\nin coloured pictures (a favourite industry of the Neapolitans),\r\nshowing the appearance of the active volcano both by day and night and\r\nits change of shape in successive years. Sir William Hamilton, the\r\nBritish Ambassador at the Court of Naples at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury (of whose great folio volumes I am the fortunate possessor),\r\nlargely occupied himself in the study and description of Vesuvius,\r\nand published illustrations of the kind mentioned above, showing the\r\nappearance of the mountain at various epochs. Since his day there has\r\nbeen no lack of descriptions of every succeeding eruption, and now we\r\nhave the records of photography.\r\n\r\nThe crater or basin formed by a volcano starts with the opening\r\nof a fissure in the earth's surface communicating by a pipe-like\r\npassage with very deeply-seated molten matter and steam. Whether the\r\nmolten matter thus naturally \"tapped\" is only a local, though vast,\r\naccumulation, or is universally distributed at a given depth below the\r\nearth's crust, and at how many miles from the surface, is not known.\r\nIt seems to be certain that the great pressure of the crust of the\r\nearth (from five to twenty-five miles thick) must prevent the heated\r\nmatter below it from becoming either liquid or gaseous, whether the\r\nheat of that mass be due to the cracking of the earth's crust and the\r\nfriction of the moving surfaces as the crust cools and shrinks, or is\r\nto be accounted for by the original high temperature of the entire mass\r\nof the terrestrial globe. It is only when the gigantic pressure is\r\nrelieved by the cracking or fissuring of the closed case called \"the\r\ncrust of the earth\" that the enclosed deep-lying matter of immensely\r\nhigh temperature liquefies, or even vaporizes, and rushes into the\r\nup-leading fissure. Steam and gas thus \"set free\" drive everything\r\nbefore them, carrying solid masses along with them, tearing, rending,\r\nshaking \"the foundations of the hills,\" and issuing in terrific\r\njets from the earth's surface, as through a safety valve, into the\r\nastonished world above. Often in a few hours they choke their own path\r\nby the destruction they produce and the falling in of the walls of\r\ntheir briefly-opened channels. Then there is a lull of hours, days,\r\nor even centuries, and after that again, a movement of the crust, a\r\n\"giving\" of the blockage of the deep, vertical pipe, and a renewed rush\r\nand jet of expanding gas and liquefying rock.\r\n\r\nThe general scheme of this process and its relations to the structure\r\nand properties of the outer crust and inner mass of the globe is\r\nstill a matter of discussion, theory and verification; but whatever\r\nconclusions geologists may reach on these matters, the main fact of\r\nimportance is that steam and gases issue from these fissures with\r\nenormous velocity and pressure, and that \"a vent\" of this kind,\r\nonce established, continues, as a rule, to serve intermittently for\r\ncenturies, and, indeed, for vast periods to which we can assign no\r\ndefinite limits. The solid matter ejected becomes piled up around\r\nthe vent as a mound, its outline taking the graceful catenary curves\r\nof rest and adjustment to which are due the great beauty of volcanic\r\ncones. The apex of the cone is blown away at intervals by the violent\r\nblasts issuing from the vent, and thus we have formed the \"crater,\"\r\nvarying in the area enclosed by its margin and in the depth and\r\nappearance of the cup so produced. At a rate depending on the amount\r\nof solid matter ejected by the crater, the mound will grow in the\r\ncourse of time to be a mountain, and often secondary craters or\r\ntemporary openings, connected at some depth with the main passage\r\nleading to the central vent, will form on the sides of the mound or\r\nmountain. Sometimes the old crater will cease to grow in consequence\r\nof the blocking of its central vent and the formation of one or more\r\nsubsidiary vents, the activity of which may blast away or smother the\r\ncup-like edge of the first crater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.–Five successive stages in the change of form\r\nof Vesuvius (after Phillips' \"Vesuvius,\" Oxford, 1869). In the oldest\r\n(lowest figure) we see the mountain with its still earlier outline\r\ncompleted by the cone drawn in dotted line. Within the period of\r\nhistoric record that cone had not been seen. The mountain had, so far\r\nas men knew, always been truncated as shown here and in Fig. 30. The\r\nnext figure above shows the further lowering of the mountain by the\r\nfirst eruption on record–that which destroyed Pompeii in A.D. 79. The\r\ncommencing formation of a new ash-cone is indicated by a dotted line.\r\nIn the three upper figures we trace the gradual growth of the new cone\r\nfrom 1631 to 1868. In 1872 the top of the new ash-cone was blown away,\r\nand the mountain reverted to the shape of 1822. Now (1920) the cone has\r\naccumulated once more and is higher than it was in 1868.]\r\n\r\nSuch a history has been that of Vesuvius shown in outline in Fig. 31.\r\nIn geologic ages–perhaps some thousands of centuries ago–Vesuvius was\r\nprobably a perfect cone (its outline is shown at the bottom of p. 62)\r\nsome 7000 ft. high, rising by a characteristically accelerated upgrowth\r\nfrom a circle of ten miles or more in diameter to its delicate central\r\npeak, hollowed out at the summit by a small crater a couple of hundred\r\nyards across. Its eruptions at that time were neither excessive nor\r\nviolent. Then came a period of greatly increased energy–the steam-jet\r\nblew with such violence that it shattered and dispersed the cone,\r\nlowering the mountain to 3700 ft. in height, truncating it and leaving\r\na proportionately widened crater of a mile and a half in diameter.\r\nAnd then the mountain reposed for long centuries. We do not know how\r\nlong this period of extinction was, for we do not know when it began,\r\nbut we know that this was the state of the mountain when in A.D. 79\r\nit once more burst into life. In recent years–that is, since the\r\nseventeenth century A.D., a curious change took place in the mountain:\r\nthe vent or orifice of the conducting channel by which eruptive\r\nmatters were brought to the surface ceased to be in the centre of the\r\nwide broken-down crater of Pliny's time, and a vent was formed a few\r\nhundred yards to the south of the centre of the old crater, nearer to\r\nthe south side of the old crater's wall. From this ashes or cinders\r\nissued, and were piled up to form a new cone, which soon added 600 ft.\r\nto the height of the mountain and covered in the southern half of the\r\nold crater's lip, whilst leaving the northern half or semicircle free.\r\nThis latter uncovered part was called by the Italians \"Monte Somma,\"\r\nand the new cone low down in the southern side of which the rest of\r\nthe old crater-lip could be traced, was henceforth spoken of as \"the\r\nash-cone\" and sometimes misleadingly as \"the true\" Vesuvius. Clearly\r\nit was not \"the true Vesuvius\" since it was a new growth. The original\r\nold Vesuvius was crowned by a crater formed by the cliffs of Monte\r\nSomma and their continuation round to the south side, now more or less\r\ncompletely concealed by the new ash-cone.\r\n\r\nIn the course of various eruptions during the last two centuries the\r\nnew ash-cone thus formed was blown away more or less completely, and\r\ngradually grew up again. During the nineteenth century it was a\r\npermanent feature of the mountain, though a good deal cut down in 1822,\r\nand later grew so high as to give a total elevation from the sea-level\r\nof 4300 ft. The crater at the top of the ash-cone has varied during\r\nthe past century in width and depth, according to its building up or\r\nblowing away by the central steam jet. In 1822 it is reported to have\r\nbeen funnel-like and 2000 ft. deep, tapering downwards to the narrow\r\nfissures which are the actual vent. At other times it has been largely\r\nfilled by débris, and only 200 ft. deep. Molten lava has often issued\r\nfrom fissures in the sides of the ash-cone, and even lower down on the\r\nsides of the mountain, and a very small secondary crater has sometimes\r\nappeared on the side of the ash-cone 100 ft. or 200 ft. from the\r\nterminal crater which \"finishes off\" the cone.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of the mountain when I first saw it in the\r\nautumn of 1871. Six months later I witnessed the most violent eruption\r\nof the nineteenth century. Vesuvius kept up a continuous roar like that\r\nof a railway engine letting off steam when at rest in a covered station\r\nonly a thousandfold bigger. Its vibrations shook with a deep musical\r\nnote, for twenty-four hours, the house nine miles distant in Naples in\r\nwhich I was staying. My windows commanded a view of the mountain, and\r\nwhen the noise ceased and the huge steam-cloud cleared away, I saw a\r\ndifferent Vesuvius, the higher part of the ash-cone was gone, and a\r\nhuge gap in it had been formed by the blowing away of its northern side.\r\n\r\nIn October 1871, when I joined my friend Anton Dohrn at Naples in order\r\nto study the marine creatures of the beautiful bay, Vesuvius was in the\r\nproud possession of a splendid cone, completing its graceful outline.\r\nA little steam-cloud hung about one side of the cone during the day,\r\nand as night came on Vesuvius used, as we said, to \"light his cigar.\"\r\nIn fact, a very small quantity of molten lava was at that time flowing\r\nfrom the side of the ash-cone, about 100 ft. from its summit, and this\r\ngave a most picturesque effect as we watched it from our balcony high\r\nup on Pausilippo, when the sun set. It was a friendly sort of beacon,\r\nfar away on the commanding mountain's top, which was answered by the\r\nlighting up of a thousand lamps along the coast, and by innumerable\r\nflaming faggots in the fishermen's boats moving across the bay, drawing\r\nto their light strange fishes, to be impaled by the long tridents of\r\nthe skilful spearmen. That little beacon light on Vesuvius increased\r\nin volume in the course of three weeks, and was supplemented by other\r\nflaming streams and by showers of red-hot stones from the crater. This\r\nsmall \"eruption\" was the precursor by six months of the great eruption\r\nof the end of April 1872, and I spent a night on Vesuvius during its\r\nprogress, and looked into the crater from which the glowing masses of\r\nrock were being belched forth.\r\n\r\nNot long before I went, in 1871, to Naples I had spent some weeks in\r\nvisiting the extinct volcanoes of the Auvergne and of the Eiffel, and\r\nI was eager to examine the still living Vesuvius. In the first week\r\nof October I made an excursion to the crater of Vesuvius in company\r\nwith the son of a Russian admiral, whose name, \"Popoff,\" was under the\r\ncircumstances unpleasantly suggestive. We examined some black slaglike\r\nmasses of old lava-streams, and struggled up the loose sandy ash-cone\r\n(there was no \"funicular\" in those days), and prodded with our sticks\r\nthe few yards of molten lava which emerged from the side of the cone\r\nabout 100 ft. from the summit. On Nov. 1 my friend Anton Dohrn (who was\r\nthen negotiating with the Naples Municipality for a site in the Villa\r\nNazionale on which to erect the great Zoological Station and Aquarium,\r\nnow so well known) was with me and some Neapolitan acquaintances\r\nlooking at Vesuvius across the bay from Pausilippo, where we had\r\nestablished ourselves, when we noticed that a long line of steam was\r\nrising from the lower part of the ash-cone and that puffs of steam were\r\nissuing at intervals from the crater. \"Dio mio! Dio di Dio!\" cried the\r\nNeapolitans in terror, and expressed their intention of leaving Naples\r\nwithout an hour's delay. As night fell a new glowing line of fire\r\nappeared far down near the base of the ash-cone, whilst what looked\r\nin the distance like sparks from a furnace, but were really red-hot\r\nstones–each as big as a Gladstone bag–were thrown every two or three\r\nminutes from the crater.\r\n\r\nWe hired a carriage, drove to Resina (built above buried Herculaneum),\r\nand walked up towards the Observatory in order to spend the night\r\non the burning mountain. We found that two white-hot streams, each\r\nabout twenty yards broad at the free end, were issuing from the base\r\nof the cone. The glowing stones thrown up by the crater were now\r\nseparately visible; a loud roar accompanied each spasmodic ejection.\r\nThe night was very clear, and a white firmly-cut cloud, due to the\r\nsteam ejected by the crater, hung above it. At intervals we heard a\r\nmilder detonation–that of thunder which accompanied the lightning which\r\nplayed in the cloud, giving it a greenish illumination by contrast with\r\nthe red flame colour reflected on to it by red-hot material within\r\nthe crater. The flames attributed to volcanoes are generally of this\r\nnature, but actual flames do sometimes occur in volcanic eruptions by\r\nthe ignition of combustible gases. The puffs of steam from the crater\r\nwere separated by intervals of about three minutes. When an eruption\r\nbecomes violent they succeed one another at the rate of many in a\r\nsecond, and the force of the steam jet is gigantic, driving a column\r\nof transparent super-heated steam with such vigour that as it cools\r\ninto the condition of \"cloud\" an appearance like that of a gigantic\r\npine-tree seven miles high (in the case of Vesuvius) is produced.\r\n\r\nWe made our way to the advancing end of one of the lava-streams (like\r\nthe \"snout\" of a glacier), which was 20 ft. high, and moved forwards\r\nbut slowly, in successive jerks. Two hundred yards farther up, where it\r\nissued from the sandy ashes, the lava was white-hot and running like\r\nwater, but it was not in very great quantity and rapidly cooled on the\r\nsurface and became \"sticky.\" A cooled skin of slag was formed in this\r\nway, which arrested the advancing stream of lava. At intervals of a\r\nfew minutes this cooled crust was broken into innumerable clinkers by\r\nthe pressure of the stream, and there was a noise like the smashing\r\nof a gigantic store of crockery ware as the pieces or \"clinkers\" fell\r\nover one another down the nearly vertical \"snout\" of the lava-stream,\r\nwhilst the red-hot molten material burst forward for a few feet, but\r\nimmediately became again \"crusted over\" and stopped in its progress.\r\nWe watched the coming together and fusion of the two streams and the\r\noverwhelming and burning up of several trees by the steadily, though\r\nslowly, advancing river of fire. Then we climbed up the ash-cone,\r\ngetting nearer and nearer to the rim of the crater, from which showers\r\nof glowing stones were being shot. The deep roar of the mountain at\r\neach effort was echoed from the cliffs of the ancient mother-crater,\r\nMonte Somma, and the ground shook under our feet as does a ship at\r\nsea when struck by a wave. The night was very still in the intervals.\r\nThe moon was shining, and a weird melancholy \"ritornelle\" sung by\r\npeasants far off in some village below us came to our ears with strange\r\ndistinctness. It might have been the chorus of the imprisoned giants of\r\nVulcan's forge as they blew the sparks with their bellows and shook the\r\nmountains with the heavy blows of their hammers.\r\n\r\nAs we ascended the upper part of the cone the red-hot stones were\r\nfalling to our left, and we determined to risk a rapid climb to the\r\nedge of the crater on the right or southern side, and to look into it.\r\nWe did so, and as we peered into the great steaming pit a terrific\r\nroar, accompanied by a shuddering of the whole mountain, burst from it.\r\nHundreds of red-hot stones rose in the air to a height of 400 ft., and\r\nfell, happily in accordance with our expectation, to our left. We ran\r\nquickly down the sandy side of the cone to a safe position, about 300\r\nft. below the crater's lip, and having lit our pipes from one of the\r\nred-hot \"bombs,\" rested for a while at a safe distance and waited for\r\nthe sunrise. A vast horizontal layer of cloud had now formed below us,\r\nand Vesuvius and the hills around Naples appeared as islands emerging\r\nfrom a sea. The brilliant sunlight was reassuring after this night\r\nof strange experiences. The fields and lanes were deserted in the\r\nearly morning as we descended to the sea-level. On our way we met a\r\nprocession of weird figures clad in long white robes, enveloping the\r\nhead closely but leaving apertures for the eyes. They were a party of\r\nthe lay-brothers of the Misericordia carrying a dead man to his grave.\r\nThen we found our carriage, and drove quickly back to Naples and sleep!\r\n\r\nIn the following March I acted as guide to my friend Professor Huxley\r\nin expeditions up Vesuvius, now quiescent, and to the Solfatara. Then\r\nsuddenly, in April, the great eruption of 1872 burst upon us. On the\r\nfirst day of the outbreak some imprudent visitors were killed by steam\r\nand gas ejected by the lava-stream. By the next day the violence of\r\nthe eruption was too great for any one to venture near it. The crater\r\nsent forth no intermittent \"puffs\" as in the preceding November, but\r\na continuously throbbing jet which produced a cloud five miles high,\r\nlike an enormous cauliflower in shape, suspended above the mountain\r\nand making it look by comparison like a mole-hill. Showers of fine\r\nashes, as in the days of Pompeii, fell thickly around, accumulating to\r\nthe depth of an inch in a few hours even at my house in Pausilippo,\r\nnine miles distant across the bay. I was recovering at the time from an\r\nattack of typhoid fever, and lay in bed, listening to the deep humming\r\nsound and wondering at the darkness until my doctor came and told me\r\nof the eruption. I was able to get up and see from the window the\r\ngreat cauliflower-like cloud and the vacant place where the ash-cone\r\nwas, but whence it had how been scattered into the sky. (It has been\r\ngradually re-formed by later eruptions, of which the last of any size\r\nwas in 1906.) I could also see steam rising like smoke from a long line\r\nreaching six miles down the mountain into the flat country below. It\r\nwas the great lava-stream which had destroyed two prosperous villages\r\nin its course.\r\n\r\nAfter ten days I was able to get about, and drove over to one of these\r\nvillages and along its main street, which was closely blocked at the\r\nend by what looked like a railway embankment some 40 ft. high. This\r\nwas the side of the great lava-stream now cooled and hardened on the\r\nsurface. It had sharply cut the houses, on each side of the street,\r\nin half without setting them on fire, so that the various rooms were\r\nexposed in section–pictures hanging on the walls, and even chairs and\r\nother furniture remaining in place on the unbroken portion of the\r\nfloor. The villagers had provided ladders by which I ascended the steep\r\nside of the embankment-like mass at the end of the street, and there a\r\nwonderful sight revealed itself. One looked out on a great river seven\r\nmiles long, narrow where it started from the broken-down crater, but\r\nwidening to three miles where I stood, and wider still farther on as\r\nit descended. This river, with all its waves and ripples, was turned\r\nto stone, and greatly resembled a Swiss glacier in appearance. A foot\r\nbelow the surface it was still red-hot, and a stick pushed into a\r\ncrevice caught fire. It was not safe to venture far on to the pie-crust\r\nsurface. A couple of miles away the campanile of the church of a\r\nvillage called Massa di Somma stood out, leaning like that of Pisa,\r\nfrom the petrified mass, whilst the rest of the village was overwhelmed\r\nand covered in by the great stream.\r\n\r\nThe curious resemblance of the lava-stream to a glacier arose from\r\nthe fact that it was almost completely covered by a white snow-like\r\npowder. This snow-like powder, which often appears on freshly-run\r\nlava, is salt–common sea salt and other mineral salts dissolved in\r\nthe water ejected as steam mixed with the lava. The steam condenses,\r\nas the lava cools, into water and evaporates slowly, leaving the salt\r\nas crystals. Often these are not white, but contain iron salt, mixed\r\nwith the white sodium, potassium, and ammonium chlorides, which gives\r\nthem a yellow or orange colour. Salts coloured in this way have the\r\nappearance of sulphur, and are often mistaken for it. The whole of the\r\ninterior of the crater of Vesuvius when I revisited it in 1875 was thus\r\ncoloured yellow, and I have a water-colour sketch of the scene made\r\nby a friend who came with me for the purpose. As a matter of fact,\r\nthough small quantities of the choking gas called \"sulphurous acid\"\r\nare among the vapours given off by Vesuvius, there is no deposit of\r\nsulphur there. Some large volcanoes (in Mexico and Japan) have made\r\ndeposits of sulphur, which are dug for commercial purposes; but the\r\nsulphur of Sicily is not, and has not been, thrown out or volatilized\r\nby Etna. It occurs in rough masses and in splendid crystals in a\r\ntertiary calcareous marine deposit, and its deposition was probably due\r\nto a chemical decomposition of constituents of the sea water brought\r\nabout by minute plants, known as \"sulphur bacteria.\" Whether the\r\nneighbouring great volcano had any share in the process seems to be\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that sea-water makes its way in large quantity\r\nthrough fissures connected with volcanic channels, and is one of the\r\nagents of the explosions caused by the subterranean molten matter.\r\nGaseous water, hydrochloric acid, carbonic acid, hydrofluoric acid, and\r\neven pure hydrogen and oxygen and argon are among the gases ejected by\r\nvolcanoes.\r\n\r\nThe molten matter forced up from the bowels of the earth and poured\r\nout by volcanoes is made up of various chemical substances, differing\r\nin different localities, and even in different eruptions of the same\r\nvolcano. It consists largely of silicates of iron, lime, magnesium,\r\naluminium, and the alkali metals, with possible admixture of nearly\r\nevery other element. Some volcanoes eject \"pitch\" or \"bitumen.\" When\r\nthe molten matter cools, interesting crystals of various \"species\"\r\n(_i.e._, of various chemical composition) usually form in the deeper\r\npart of the mass. The lavas of Vesuvius frequently contain beautiful\r\nopaque-white twelve-sided crystals of a siliceous mineral called\r\n\"leucite.\" I have collected in the lava of Niedermendig, on the Rhine,\r\nspecimens embedding bright blue transparent crystals (a mineral called\r\nHaüynite) scattered in the grey porous rock. The lava-streams, and\r\neven the \"roots,\" of extinct volcanoes which are of great geologic\r\nage, sometimes become exposed by the change of the earth's surface,\r\nand extensive sheets of volcanic rock of various kinds are thus laid\r\nbare. Basalt is one of these rocks, and it not unfrequently presents\r\nitself as a mass of perpendicular six-sided columns, each column 10\r\nft. or more high, and often a foot or more in diameter. The \"Giant's\r\nCauseway,\" in the North of Ireland, and the \"Pavée des Géants,\" in\r\nthe Ardêche of Southern France, are examples both of which I have\r\nvisited. It is not easy to explain how the molten basalt has come to\r\ntake this columnar structure on cooling. It has nothing to do with\r\n\"crystallization,\" but is similar to the columnar formation shown by\r\ncommercial \"starch\" and occasionally by \"tabular flint\". A theoretical\r\nexplanation of its formation has been given by Prof. J. Thompson,\r\nbrother of the late Lord Kelvin.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of volcanoes and their products make up a long story–too\r\nlong to be told here. There are from 300 to 400 active craters in\r\nExistence to-day–mostly not isolated, but grouped along certain great\r\nlines, as, for instance, along the Andean chain, or in more irregular\r\ntracks. If we add to the list craters no longer active, but still\r\nrecognizable, we must multiply it by ten. Vesuvius is the only active\r\nvolcano on the mainland of Europe–Hecla, Etna, Stromboli, Volcano,\r\nand the volcanoes of the Santorin group are on islands. The biggest\r\nvolcanoes are in South America, Mexico, Java, and Japan. Volcanoes and\r\nthe related \"earthquakes\" have been most carefully studied with a view\r\nto the safety of the population in Japan. The graceful and well-beloved\r\nvolcano, Fujiyama, is more than 12,000 ft. high, but, unlike others in\r\nthose islands, it has been quiescent now for just 200 years. The most\r\nviolent volcanic eruptions of recent times, with the largest \"output\"\r\nof solid matter, are those of the Soufrière of St. Vincent in 1812,\r\nof the Mont Pelée of Martinique in 1902, and of Krakatoa in 1883. A\r\nsingle moderate eruption of the great volcano Mauna Loa, in Hawaii,\r\nnearly 14,000 feet high, throws out a greater quantity of solid matter\r\nthan Vesuvius has ejected in all the years which have elapsed since the\r\ndestruction of Pompeii. Many hundred millions of tons of solid matter\r\nwere ejected by Mont Pelée in 1902, when also a peculiar heavy cloud\r\ndescended from the mountain, hot and acrid, charged with incandescent\r\nsand, and rolling along like a liquid rather than a vapour. It burnt\r\nup the town of St. Pierre and its inhabitants and the shipping in the\r\nharbour. In the eruption of the volcano of St. Vincent in 1812 three\r\nmillion tons of ashes were projected on to the Bahamas Islands, 100\r\nmiles distant, besides a larger quantity which fell elsewhere. The\r\ngreat explosion at Krakatoa, lasting two days, blew an island of 1400\r\nft. high, into the air. A good deal of it was projected as excessively\r\nfine needlelike particles of pumice with such force as to carry it up\r\nthirty miles into the upper regions of the atmosphere, where it was\r\ncarried by air currents all over the world, causing the \"red sunsets\"\r\nof the following year. The sky over Batavia, 100 miles distant, was\r\ndarkened at midday so completely that lamps had to be used–as I heard\r\nfrom my brother who was there at the time. The explosions were heard\r\nin Mauritius, 3000 miles away. A sea wave 50 ft. high was set going by\r\nthe submarine disturbance, and reaching Java and neighbouring islands\r\ninundated the land and destroyed 36,000 persons. This wave travelled\r\nin reduced size over a vast tract of the ocean, and was observed and\r\nrecorded at Cape Horn, 7800 miles distant from its seat of origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nBLUE WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people know and admire the splendid expanse of blue colour offered\r\nby the clear sea water on many parts of our coasts, and by that of\r\nlakes at home and abroad. I find that there is still a sort of a fixed\r\ndetermination not to believe that this colour is due (as it is) to the\r\nactual blue colour of pure water. Pure, transparent water is blue.\r\nThose who think they know better will point to a glass of pure water,\r\nhold it up to the light, and affirm that it is colourless. But this\r\napparent colourlessness is due to the small breadth of water in the\r\nglass through which the light passes. It is definitely ascertained that\r\nif water as pure and as free from either dissolved or suspended matter\r\nas it is possible to make it (by distillation and the use of vessels\r\nnot acted upon by water) be made to fill an opaque tube 15 ft. long,\r\nclosed at each end by a transparent plate, and then a beam of light be\r\nmade to traverse the length of the tube, so that the eye receives the\r\nlight after it has passed through this length of 15 ft. of water, the\r\ncolour of the light is a strong blue. Water is blue in virtue of its\r\nown molecular character, just as sulphate of copper is. Liquid oxygen,\r\nprepared by the use of intense cold, is also transparent blue, and the\r\npeculiar condensed form of oxygen known as \"ozone\" is, when liquefied,\r\nof a darker or stronger blue than oxygen.\r\n\r\nAt one time (some thirty years ago) there was still some doubt as to\r\nwhether water was self-coloured blue, or whether its blue colour was\r\ndue to the action on light of excessively minute solid white particles\r\nof chalk suspended in the water. Such fine suspended particles in some\r\ncases act on the light which falls on to them so as to reflect the\r\nblue rays. This occurs in certain natural objects which have a blue\r\ncolour. But these can be distinguished from transparent self-coloured\r\nblue substances by the fact that whilst the light reflected from their\r\nsurface is blue, the light which is made to traverse them (when they\r\nare held up to the light so that they come between one's eye and the\r\nsun's rays) is brown. This is the case with very hot smoke, and can be\r\nwell seen when a cigar is smoked in the sunlight. The smoke which comes\r\noff from the lighted end of the cigar is very hot, and its particles\r\nare more minute than those of cooler smoke. The hot smoke shows a\r\nbright blue colour when the sunlight falls on it and is reflected,\r\nbut when you look through the smoke-cloud at a surface reflecting the\r\nsunlight, the cloud has a reddish-brown tint. As the smoke cools its\r\nparticles adhere to one another and form larger particles, and the\r\nlight reflected from the cloud is no longer blue but grey, and even\r\nwhite. Thus the smoke which the smoker keeps for half a minute in his\r\nmouth is cooled and condensed, and reflects white light–is, in fact, a\r\nwhite cloud–when he puffs it out, and contrasts strongly with the blue\r\ncloud coming off from the burning tobacco at the lighted end of the\r\ncigar. The blue colour of the sky is held by many physicists (though\r\nother views have been of late advanced) to be due to the same action\r\non the part of the very finest particles of watery vapour, which are\r\ndiffused through vast regions of our atmosphere above the condensed\r\nwhite-looking clouds consisting of larger floating particles of water.\r\n\r\nVapours are given off by many liquids, and even by some solids, varying\r\nin their production according to the heat applied in different cases.\r\nThey are gases, and quite transparent and invisible at the proper\r\ntemperature, like the atmospheric air. Thus water is always giving\r\noff \"water-vapour,\" which is quite invisible. When water is heated to\r\nthe boiling point it is rapidly converted into transparent invisible\r\nvapour. Steam, as this vapour is called, is invisible, and we all\r\nhabitually make a misleading use of the word \"steam\" when we apply it\r\nboth to this and to the slightly cooled and condensed cloud which we\r\ncan see issuing from the spout of a kettle or from a railway engine.\r\nIt seems that the fault lies with the scientific writers, who have\r\napplied the word \"steam\" to the invisible water vapour or gas before it\r\nhas condensed to form a cloud. The old English word \"steam\" certainly\r\nmeans a visible cloudy emanation, and not a transparent invisible\r\ngas. A cloud is not a vapour, but is produced by the coming together\r\nor condensation of the minute invisible particles of a vapour to form\r\nlarger particles, which float and hang together, and reflect the light,\r\nand thus are visible.\r\n\r\nBy the examination of other vapours or gases than that which is gaseous\r\nwater, namely, the vapours of bodies like chloroform and ether, it has\r\nbeen shown that \"cloud\" forms in a vapour not merely in consequence of\r\nthe cooling of the vapour, but in consequence of the presence in the\r\nair (or in the tube in which the vapour is enclosed for observation) of\r\nvery fine floating dust particles. They act as centres of attraction\r\nand condensation for the vapour particles. When there are no dust\r\nparticles present clouds do not form readily in cooling vapours, or\r\nonly at lower temperatures, and in larger mass. Tyndall made some\r\nbeautiful experiments on this subject, obtaining clouds of great\r\ntenuity in vapours enclosed in tubes, which reflected the most vivid\r\nblue tints when illuminated by the electric arc-lamp. Later Aitken,\r\nof Edinburgh, showed that the \"fog\" which forms in smoke-ridden towns\r\nis due to the condensation of previously invisible watery vapour as\r\n\"cloud\" around the solid floating particles of carbon of the smoke.\r\nAitken further used this property of solid floating particles, namely,\r\nthat they cause the formation of fog and cloud in vapours–to test the\r\nquestion as to whether the excessively minute odoriferous particles\r\nwhich affect our noses as \"smell\" are distinct solid floating particles\r\nas often supposed, or are of the nature of gas and vapour. He admitted\r\nstrong perfumes such as musk into tubes containing watery vapour, at\r\nsuch a temperature that the vapour was in a \"critical\" state–just ready\r\nto condense and precipitate as \"cloud.\" If he had admitted fine solid\r\nparticles such as a minute whiff of smoke, or some \"dusty\" air–the\r\ncloud would have formed. But the admission of the perfume had no such\r\neffect Therefore, he concluded that the odoriferous emanations used by\r\nhim are not distinct particles like those of smoke or dust, but are\r\ngaseous.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful blue tint of the semi-transparent \"white\" of a boiled\r\nplover's egg is due to a fine-particled cloud dispersed in the clear\r\nalbumen. London milk used to be \"sky-blue\" for a similar reason,\r\nbefore the recent legislation against the adulteration of food. The\r\nblue eyes of our fair-haired race and of young foxes are not due to\r\nany \"pigment\"–that is to say, a separable self-coloured substance–but\r\nto a fine cloud floating in a transparent medium which reflects blue\r\nrays of light as blue smoke does. The iris of the eye can and often\r\ndoes develop a pigment, but it is a brown one. When present in small\r\nquantity it produces a green-coloured iris, the pale yellow-brown\r\nbeing added to the blue cloud-caused colouring. When present in larger\r\nquantity the same pigment gives us brown and so-called \"black\"\r\neyes. The blue colours in birds' feathers and insects' wings are\r\nproduced without blue pigment by special effects of reflection, and\r\nwhere green is the colour it is often due to the addition of a small\r\nquantity of yellow pigment to what would otherwise look blue: though\r\nsome caterpillars and grasshoppers have a real green pigment in their\r\nskin. Flowers, on the other hand, have true soluble blue \"pigments,\"\r\nand green ones too, notably that called leaf-green or chlorophyll.\r\nThe little green tree frog has no blue or green pigment in its skin;\r\nonly a yellow pigment. Sometimes rare specimens are found in which\r\nthe yellow pigment is absent altogether, and then the little frog is\r\nturquoise-blue in colour. But there is no blue pigment in the skin;\r\nonly a finely-clouded translucent film overlying a dead-black deep\r\nlayer of the skin, and the result is that the frog is of a wonderful\r\npure blue. Sometimes the commoner large edible frog is found with a\r\nsimilar absence of yellow pigment (I found some in a garden near Geneva\r\nsix years ago), and then all the parts of its skin which usually are\r\ngreen show as brilliant blue.\r\n\r\nIt is at first difficult to believe that such fine, smoothly-spread\r\nturquoise blue as that of the blue frog is due merely to a \"reflection\r\neffect,\" and that there is no blue pigment present which would show\r\nas blue if light were transmitted through it, or could be separated\r\nand dissolved in some medium. Yet this is undoubtedly the case. The\r\nnearest experimental production of such a blue surface without blue\r\npigment is obtained by first varnishing a black board, and when the\r\nvarnish is nearly dry passing a sponge wetted with water over it.\r\nSome of the varnish is precipitated from its solution in the spirit\r\n(or it may be turpentine) as a fine cloud, and until the water has\r\nevaporated it looks like blue paint, as the poet Goethe found when\r\ncleaning a picture. It would be interesting to know more precisely the\r\nprecautions to be taken in order to get the blue colour in this way in\r\nfullest degree.\r\n\r\nIt appears that when light is reflected from a cloud of fine colourless\r\nparticles so as to give a predominant blue colour, the light so\r\nreflected is affected in that special way which physicists describe\r\nas being \"polarized.\" It is possible by the use of certain apparatus\r\n(the polariscope) to distinguish polarized from non-polarized light,\r\nso that it should be possible to decide (or at any rate to gain\r\nevidence) whether blue water–a sheet of blue water–owes its colour to\r\nfine particles suspended in it or to the self-colour of the water. An\r\nadmirable case for making this simple experiment is presented by the\r\ngreat tanks–some 20 ft. cube–which are used by the water companies\r\nwhich draw their water supply from the chalk, for the purpose of\r\nprecipitating the dissolved chalk–\"Clarking\" the water, as it is\r\ncalled, after the inventor of the process–and so getting rid of its\r\nexcessive \"hardness.\" Such tanks are to be seen by the side of the\r\nrailway near Caterham. The water in these tanks is of such a brilliant\r\nturquoise blue that many people suppose that copper has been added\r\nto the water to free it from microbes! Such, at any rate, was the\r\nconviction expressed by a friend in conversation with me only a few\r\nweeks ago. The water in these tanks, when seen from the railway, looks\r\nlike a magnificent blue dye, and a very important point for those (not\r\na few) who believe that the blue colour of seas and lakes is due to the\r\nreflection of the blue colour of the sky overhead is that the water\r\nin the tanks looks just as blue when the sky is overcast with cloud\r\nas when there is blue sky. The blue colour of water has, as a rule,\r\nnothing to do with the reflection of the sky, though it is the fact\r\nthat a shallow film of water may at a certain angle reflect the sky to\r\nour eyes, just as a mirror may. The effect is quite unlike that due to\r\nlight passing through deep water when reflected from below it. If we\r\nexamine the tanks in question we find that they have been filled with\r\nwater pumped from the chalk, and that then lime has been added to the\r\nwater in order to combine with the carbonic acid dissolved in it and\r\nform chalk or carbonate of lime–which is insoluble in pure water and\r\nfalls as an excessively fine white powder to the bottom of the tank.\r\nBut the important fact is that water having carbonic acid dissolved\r\nin it can dissolve carbonate of lime or chalk to a certain amount:\r\nand this water pumped from the chalk, having carbonic acid naturally\r\ndissolved in it, has consequently also dissolved a quantity of chalk.\r\nIt is this which gives the chalk-spring water the objectionable\r\nquality of \"hardness.\" When lime is added to the chalk-spring water\r\nas pumped into the tanks, the carbonic acid in it is taken up by the\r\nlime, and the chalk previously dissolved by the carbonic-acid-holding\r\nwater is, so to speak, \"undissolved,\" and thrown down as a very fine\r\nwhite powder, together with the chalk newly formed by the union of the\r\nlime and the carbonic acid. These large tanks are used to allow the\r\nfine powder of chalk to settle down and leave the water clear. The\r\nbrilliantly white chalk sediment accumulates not only on the floor\r\nof the tank, but on its sides. Any light which falls on the tank is\r\nrefracted and reflected from side to floor and from floor to side, and\r\neventually emerges from the tank, a great deal of it having traversed\r\nthe 20 ft. breadth and depth many times. Most of its red, yellow, and\r\ngreen rays are quenched by the many feet of blue water through which\r\nit has passed, and it issues as predominantly blue. This is largely\r\ndue to the fine reflecting surface furnished by the \"white-washed\"\r\nor chalk-coated floor and sides and the great purity of the white\r\nreflecting material–no yellow or brown matter being present to give a\r\ngreenish tinge to the result I remember being taken to see \"Clark's\r\nprocess\" in use, and the splendid blue colour of the water in the\r\n\"softening\" tanks at Plumstead, when the process was first used by the\r\nNorth Kent Water Company, sixty-four years ago.\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, still a possible question as to whether the fine\r\nfloating particles of precipitating chalk act in any way as a\r\n\"cloud\"–in short, as the blue clouds of smoke, egg-white, milk, and\r\nvarnish. There is no evidence that they do, but no one, so far as I\r\nknow, has ever taken the trouble to settle the question. It could be\r\ndone by examining the blue light from the tanks with a polariscope,\r\nand also by sinking a black tarpaulin into the tank to cover the white\r\nfloor and hanging others at the sides. Then if the blue colour were due\r\nto light reflected from the white floor and sides traversing repeatedly\r\nthe clear self-coloured blue water, the blue colour should no longer\r\nbe visible, for the reflecting surfaces would be covered by the black\r\ntarpaulin and little light sent up through the water. But if it were\r\ndue to a cloud of greatest delicacy in the water–like fine smoke\r\nreflecting the blue light rather than the other rays–then the colour\r\nshould be as intense or more intense when the black background is\r\nintroduced. I am surprised that some inquirer, younger and more active\r\nthan I am, does not put the matter to the test of experiment.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, practically all the facts which we know about \"blue\r\nwater\" are consistent with the blue self-colour of water, and not with\r\nthat of a \"blue cloud\" in the water. Now that we have porcelain baths\r\nof the purest white and of large size, one may often see the strong\r\nblue colour of water of great purity in the bath, especially where\r\nwaves or ripples send to our eyes those rays of light which have taken\r\na more or less horizontal course from side to side of the bath, and\r\nhave thus been through a large thickness of the pale-coloured fluid.\r\nGreat masses of clear ice, such as one may study in glaciers, are\r\nblue; the \"crevasses\" which transmit light which has passed through\r\na considerable thickness of ice (as, for instance, in an ice cave),\r\nare deep blue; there is no question of a reflection from suspended\r\nparticles. The green colour which some glaciers show at a little\r\ndistance is due to the yellow rust–iron oxide–blown on to the surface\r\nof the ice and dissolved. Many glaciers or parts of glaciers are quite\r\nfree from it, and of a splendid indigo blue in their deeper fissures.\r\nSo, too, as to the sea and lakes. The Blue Grotto or Cavern of the\r\nisland of Capri, near Naples, is a case in point. All the light which\r\nenters it comes through the sea-water and is blue. I was taken to it\r\nin a boat rowed by two men. As the boat enters the low mouth of the\r\ncavern you have to bend down to avoid knocking your head against the\r\nrock. Then you find yourself floating in a vast and lofty chamber the\r\nwhite rocky floor of which is some twenty feet below the surface of the\r\nclear water. No light enters the cavern by the low part of the entrance\r\nabove water. Below the surface it widens and the strong Southern sun\r\nshines through the clear water and its light is reflected up into the\r\ncave from the bottom. It is blue, and everything in the cave above as\r\nwell as below the water is suffused with a blue glow–a truly wonderful\r\nand fascinating spectacle. In order to get the best effect you must\r\nchoose an hour when the sun is in a favourable position. Where there\r\nis a white bottom at a depth of fifty or a hundred feet, the sea has\r\na fine ultra-marine colour, so long as it is clear. It is often made\r\ngreen by yellow-coloured impurities, either fine iron-stained sediment\r\nor by minute living things in the water. The colour of the water of\r\neither sea or lakes, when it is clear and overlying great depths (200\r\nfathoms and more), tends to be dark indigo owing to the deficiency of\r\nreflected light. But there are enough white particles as a rule to send\r\nsome of the light, which penetrates the water, upwards again. Even the\r\ngreat ocean has a dark purplish-blue colour, but never the bright blue\r\nof clear water in shallow seas with light-coloured or white bottom.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful exhibitions of the colour of clear water in\r\nvarious thicknesses which I know, is at the entrance of the Rhone into\r\nthe Lake of Geneva. The thick pale-coloured brownish-white sediment\r\nof the river shoots out for a quarter of a mile or more into the dark\r\nblue waters of the deep lake, and on a bright sunny day as it subsides\r\nreflects the light upwards from different depths through the clear\r\nwater. Where it has sunk but little the colour is green, owing to the\r\ninfluence of the yellow mud. Farther on it is ultra-marine blue, and\r\nthen, where it has sunk deeper, we get full indigo tints. The movement\r\nof the water and its churning up by the steamers' paddles add to the\r\nvariety of effects, since the foam of air-bubbles submerged throws\r\nup the light through the water. It is not possible to doubt as one\r\nwatches the admixture of the river and the lake, and the eddies and\r\nhanging walls of sediment, that one is floating over a vast depth\r\nof magnificent blue self-coloured fluid which is traversed by the\r\nsunlight in ways and degrees varying according to its depth and the\r\nvolume of the pale mud of the in-rushing Rhone and the abundance of\r\nfine air-bubbles \"churned\" into the water by the paddle-wheels of the\r\nsteamer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE BIGGEST BEAST\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a prevalent notion, encouraged by the fanciful exaggerations\r\nof newspaper gossips, that the animals of past ages, whose bones are\r\nfrom time to time dug out of rocks and sand quarries, were many of\r\nthem much bigger than any at present existing, and that we are living\r\nin an age of degeneracy. It is true that the mammoth and the mastodon\r\nwere enormous creatures, but they were _not_ bigger than their living\r\nrepresentatives, the great elephants of Africa and India. The African\r\nelephant often stands 11 ft. high at the shoulder, and occasionally\r\nattains 12 ft.\r\n\r\nSome eighty years ago Dr. Gideon Mantell became celebrated by his\r\ndiscovery of the bones of huge reptiles–far bigger than any existing\r\ncrocodile or lizard–nearly as big as elephants, in the Wealden rocks of\r\nTilgate Forest in Sussex. He and Sir Richard Owen distinguished several\r\nkinds–the Iguanodon, the Megalosaurus, the Hylæosaurus, and others.\r\nModels of these creatures as they appeared when clothed in flesh and\r\nhide were carefully made, and placed picturesquely among the ponds and\r\nislands of the gardens of the Crystal Palace at Sydenham when it was\r\nfirst opened to an enchanted public in the fifties. As a small boy I,\r\nat that time, fell under their spell.\r\n\r\nThe passing years have brought to us more complete knowledge of these\r\nstrange beasts–now classed as the \"Dinosauria\"–and new kinds and\r\ncomplete skeletons of those already known have been discovered in the\r\nUnited States and in Belgium. The leg bones and vertebræ of one of\r\nthe biggest were found near Oxford, and are in the Oxford Museum; it\r\nreceived the name Cetiosaurus. Only a few years ago a very complete\r\nskeleton of a creature closely allied to Cetiosaurus was with great\r\nlabour and skill dug out of the Jurassic rocks of Wyoming, U.S.A., by\r\nDr. Holland, at the charges of Mr. Andrew Carnegie. It was known as\r\nDiplodocus (referring to certain bones in its tail), and a wonderful\r\ncast of the completely reconstructed skeleton was presented to the\r\nNatural History Museum in London, when I was Director, by Mr. Carnegie.\r\nThe skeleton is 84 ft. long; but we must not be mis-led as to the\r\nanimal's actual bulk by this measurement, for the tail is 46 ft. long\r\nand whip-like, whilst the neck is 23 ft. long and carries a small head\r\nnot bigger than that of a cart-horse. The jaws were provided with\r\nsmall peg-like teeth, showing that the beast fed on soft vegetable\r\nmatter. The body, apart from neck and tail, was really only a little\r\nbigger than that of a large elephant, and the limb-bones longer in\r\nthe proportion of about six to five. Another reptile very similar to\r\nthese and also found in the mesozoic rocks of the U.S. America is\r\nBrontosaurus.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that, if we wish to make an intelligent comparison of\r\nthe sizes of different animals, we have carefully to ascertain not\r\nmerely the length measurements, but the _proportions_ of the various\r\nparts, and the actual bulk and probable weight of the beasts under\r\nconsideration. Also (and this is a very important and decisive matter)\r\nwe must know whether the beasts were terrestrial in habit, walking with\r\ntheir bodies raised high on their legs, or whether they were aquatic\r\nand swam in the lakes or seas, their bodies buoyed up and supported by\r\nthe water. By far the biggest animals of which we have any knowledge\r\nare the various kinds of whales still flourishing in the sea. A\r\nmechanical limit is set to the size of land-walking animals, and that\r\nlimit has been reached by the elephant \"Flesh and blood,\" and we may\r\nadd \"bone,\" cannot carry on dry land a greater bulk than his. He is\r\nalways in danger of sinking by his own weight into soft earth and bog.\r\nHis legs have to be much thicker in proportion than those of smaller\r\nanimals–made of the same material–or they would bend and snap. His feet\r\nhave to be padded with huge discs of fat and fibre to ease the local\r\npressure, and his legs are kept straight not bent at the joints, when\r\nhe stands (a fact to which Shakespeare makes Ulysses refer), so that\r\nthe vast weight of his body shall be supported by the stiff column\r\nformed by the upper and lower half of the limb-bones kept upright in\r\none straight line. A well-grown elephant weighs five tons. Compare his\r\nweight and shape with that of a big whale-bone whale! No extinct animal\r\nknown approaches the existing whale in bulk and weight. He is 80 to\r\n90 ft. long, and has no neck nor any length of tail. His outline is\r\negg-like, narrower at the hinder end. He weighs 200 tons–forty times as\r\nmuch as a big elephant–and is perfectly supported without any strain on\r\nhis structure by the water in which he floats. There is no such limit\r\nto his possible size as there is in the case of land-walking animals.\r\nBut it seems probable that he too is limited in size by mechanical\r\nconditions of another kind. Probably he cannot exceed some 90 ft. in\r\nlength and 200 tons of bulk on account of the relatively great increase\r\nof proportionate size and power in the heart required in order to\r\npropel the blood through such a vast mass of living tissue and keep\r\nhim \"going\" as a warm-blooded mammal. The original pattern–the small\r\ndog-like ancestor of the whale–cannot be indefinitely expanded as an\r\nefficient working machine, though its limit of growth is not determined\r\nby the same mechanical causes as those which limit the bulk of the\r\nterrestrial quadruped.\r\n\r\nThese considerations make it clear that we should compare as to\r\n\"bigness\" terrestrial animals with other terrestrial animals, and\r\naquatic animals with aquatic ones. It seems probable that Diplodocus\r\nwas an aquatic reptile, and never raised himself on to his four legs\r\non dry land as the Carnegie skeleton at the Natural History Museum is\r\ndoing. His legs and feet are quite unfitted to support his weight on a\r\nland surface; on land he would have rested on his belly, as a crocodile\r\ndoes, with much bent legs on each side. But submerged in 20 ft.\r\ndepth of water, he could have trotted along, half-floating, with his\r\nfeet touching the bottom and his head raised on its long neck to the\r\nsurface, slowly sucking the floating vegetation into his moderate-sized\r\nmouth. (See drawing on p. 91.)\r\n\r\nDiplodocus and Cetiosaurus have huge thigh-bones and upper-arm\r\nbones–respectively 5 ft. 9 in. and 3 ft. 2 in. in length–until lately\r\nthe biggest known _limb_-bones, although the lower jaw-bone of a Right\r\nWhale grows to be 18 ft. in length. But a thigh-bone (femur) of a\r\nreptile similar to Diplodocus has been found in Wyoming, 6 ft. 2 in.\r\nin length. This reptile was named Atlantosaurus, and a cast of the\r\nhuge bone–the biggest known when it was placed there–stands in our\r\nmuseum gallery. However, its glory has departed, for we now know \"than\r\nthis biggest bone, a bigger still.\" The bones of several individuals\r\nof a huge reptile similar to Diplodocus, but actually twice as big in\r\nlinear dimensions, were found by Dr. Fraas at Tendagoroo, fifty miles\r\nfrom the coast in German East Africa, and brought safely to Berlin in\r\n1912, though they have not yet been mounted as a complete specimen.\r\nThey were lying in a sandy deposit of the same geologic age as our\r\nSussex Wealden. A special expedition of 500 negroes was sent–not by\r\nthe Government, but by the Berlin \"Society of the Friends of Natural\r\nHistory\" (we need such a society in England), at a cost of £10,000,\r\nto fetch the bones. They were of many individuals, and had to be\r\nskilfully dug out and packed. Dr. Fraas calls this biggest of all\r\nquadrupeds \"Gigantosaurus.\" A cast of the humerus, or upper-arm bone,\r\nis now exhibited in the Natural History Museum. It is over 7 ft. in\r\nlength. The femur, or thigh-bone, was still bigger–it was over 10 ft.\r\nin length. Alas for the glory of Atlantosaurus! This enormous creature\r\nwas, of course, like Diplodocus, aquatic. Its bulk was much less than\r\nthat of a big whale, but extinct aquatic reptiles may yet be found of\r\ngreater size. Ichthyosaurus, the extinct whale-like reptile, does not\r\nexceed 30 ft. in length. Our engraving (Fig. 32) shows the relative\r\nsize of the humerus of man, the elephant,[4] and the Gigantosaurus. How\r\npuny is that human arm-bone! And yet...!\r\n\r\nWhen stretched on the shore, resting on the belly, the body of the\r\ngreat lizard of Tendagoroo bulked like a breakwater 12 ft. high, and\r\nhis tail like a huge serpent extended 80 ft. beyond it; whilst his head\r\nand neck reached 40 ft. along the mud in front.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.–The upper-arm bone or humerus of the great\r\nreptile (Gigantosaurus) of Tendagoroo–compared with that of man and of\r\nan Indian elephant.]\r\n\r\nAn important limitation to great size in an animal is, it must be\r\nremembered, often imposed by the nature of the animal's food. Ten\r\nindividuals each weighing a hundredweight will more easily pick up\r\nand swallow the amount of food required to nourish ten hundredweight\r\nof the species than will one individual responsible for the whole\r\nbulk, provided that the food is scattered and not ready to the mouth\r\nin unlimited quantity. A creature which has unlimited forest or grass\r\nor seaweed as its food will be at no disadvantage owing to its size.\r\nBut a carnivor or a fish-eater or one depending on special fruits and\r\nroots not offered to him by nature in mass has to search for, and\r\nsometimes to hunt, or at any rate to compete with others, for the\r\nscattered and elusive \"bits\" of food. So it is that we find that the\r\nfruit-eating apes are not very big, and that terrestrial carnivors are\r\nsmall, though powerful and swift, as compared with cattle, deer, and\r\nvegetarian beasts. Ten carnivors weighing each ten stone will with\r\ntheir ten mouths \"pick up\" more prey than one carnivor weighing a\r\nhundred stone and having only one mouth. Even the carnivorous Dinosaurs\r\nsuch as Megalosaurus and Tyrannosaurus were much smaller than the\r\nvegetarian Iguanodon, Diplodocus, Brontosaurus and Triceratops on\r\nwhich (or on the like of which) they preyed–just as a tiger is smaller\r\nthan a buffalo, and a wolf smaller than a horse. It is owing to causes\r\nof this nature that the life of some animals, and consequently their\r\ngrowth, is limited in duration. Occasionally the common lobster lives\r\nto a great age, and grows to be more than 2 ft. long. But he is doomed\r\nby his size; the smaller lobsters \"go quickly around\" and get all\r\nthe food (carrion of the sea), and the big fellow has to starve. The\r\nwhale-bone whales, it is true, take animal food; but it occurs in the\r\nform of minute sea-slugs and shrimps, which fill the surface waters in\r\ncountless millions over hundreds of miles of ocean. Hence the whales of\r\nthis kind have only to swim along with their mouths open through an\r\nunlimited supply of luscious food. The size of terrestrial animals is\r\nalso, it appears, definitely related to the natural water-supply. There\r\nare very few small quadrupeds in the interior of Africa. On account of\r\nfrequent \"drought,\" the mammals have often to run a hundred miles or\r\nmore in search of water. Only animals as big as the larger antelopes\r\nand the zebra can cover the ground. The smaller kinds die (and have, in\r\nfact, died out in past ages) in these regions of sudden drought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The gigantic reptile Diplodocus on land.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[4] The elephant, the thigh-bone of which, measuring nearly 3 ft. in\r\nlength, is drawn in Fig. 32, is a large Indian one. This species is\r\nexceeded in size by the African. See \"Science from an Easy Chair,\"\r\nSecond series, p. 123.–The largest elephant the bones of which are\r\nknown is the Elephas antiquus of the Pleistocene, bigger than either of\r\nthe living species and bigger than the mammoth, Elephas primigenius.\r\nThe arm-bone (humerus) of one of this species (Elephas antiquus) lately\r\ndug up near Chatham and now in the Natural History Museum, is 4 ft. 3\r\nin. in length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWHAT IS MEANT BY \"A SPECIES\"?\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who take an interest in natural history must find it necessary\r\nto know what the naturalist means by \"a species\" of animal or plant.\r\nWhat does he mean when he says: \"This is not the same species as\r\nthat,\" or \"This is a species closely allied to this other species,\"\r\nor \"This is a new species\"? What are the \"species\" concerning the\r\norigin of which Darwin propounded his great theory? There is really no\r\nEnglish word which can be exactly used in place of the word \"species.\"\r\nI often have to use the word when writing about plants or animals,\r\nand should like once for all to say what is meant by it. One might\r\nsuppose that a \"kind\" is the same thing as a species. And so it often\r\nis; but, on the other hand, by the word \"kind\" we often mean a group\r\nincluding several species. For instance, we say the \"cat-kind\" or\r\nthe \"daisy-kind,\" meaning the \"cat-like\" animals or the \"daisy-like\"\r\nplants. The expression \"the cat-kind\" includes the common cat and the\r\nwild cat, and even leopards, lions, and tigers, each of which is a\r\nspecies of cat. And by the \"daisy-kind\" we understand a group including\r\nseveral species of daisies, such as the common daisy, the ox-eye daisy,\r\nthe camomile daisy, the michaelmas daisy, and others. Hence we cannot\r\ntranslate species simply by the word \"kind.\" \"Kind\" is the same word\r\nas \"kin\"–\"a little more than kin and less than kind,\" runs Hamlet's\r\nbitter pun. \"Kind\" means a group held together by kinship, and it may\r\nbe a larger or a smaller group held together by a close kinship or\r\nby a more distant one. \"Sort,\" again, will not serve our purpose as\r\nan English translation of \"species.\" For, although \"a sort\" implies\r\na certain selection and similarity of the things included in the\r\n\"sort,\" the amount of similarity implied may be very great or it may be\r\nindefinitely vague and remote. Hence naturalists have to stick to the\r\nword \"species,\" and to use it with a clear definition of what they mean\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nSuppose we get together a large unsorted collection–many hundred\r\n\"specimens\" or individuals–of the common butterflies of England. Then,\r\nif we look them over, we shall find that we can pick out and arrange\r\nthe specimens into definite groups, according to their colour-pattern.\r\nWe find that the kinds which we readily distinguish are called in\r\nEnglish the swallow-tails, the whites, the sulphurs, the clouded\r\nyellows, the tortoise-shells, the peacocks, the red admirals, the\r\npainted ladies, the gatekeepers, the meadow browns, the heaths, the\r\ncoppers, and the blues. There might be others in such a collection, but\r\nthat is enough for our purpose. On examining the specimens closely, we\r\nfind that the colour-markings and \"venation\" or network by which the\r\nwings are marked and the shape of the wings, body, and legs of all the\r\nspecimens of the swallow-tails are almost exactly alike, and unlike\r\nthose of any of the others. We shall find if we have a dozen or two\r\nspecimens that there is a slight difference in the pattern, size, and\r\ncolour of wing of some of the swallow-tails, dividing them into two\r\ngroups, which we soon ascertain to be the males and females; but this\r\nis so small a difference that we may ignore it. The swallow-tail is\r\nobviously and at once distinguished from any of the other butterflies\r\nin the collection by its colour-pattern and shape. So also with the\r\nothers, there will be many specimens in each case agreeing in colour\r\nand pattern, and recognizable and distinguishable from the rest by\r\nthe colour-pattern and by the \"venation\" or \"nervures\" of the wings.\r\nIf we collect butterflies again in other years and in other parts of\r\nthe country, we find the same set of shapes and patterns exactly,\r\ncorresponding to what we have learnt to call swallow-tails, whites,\r\nsulphurs, clouded yellows, tortoise-shells, etc. There are, we thus\r\nlearn, several distinct, unchanging kinds of butterfly, which are\r\ncommon in this country, and appear every year. Similarly we may go into\r\na meadow in spring, and gather a number of flowers, and a naturalist\r\nwill roughly arrange our bouquet into \"kinds\"; there will be the\r\nbuttercups, the daisies, the clovers, the dead nettles, the poppies,\r\nthe roses, the orchids, etc.\r\n\r\nIf, now, we look more carefully at our collection of butterflies,\r\nsorted out roughly into kinds or species, we shall find that the\r\n\"whites,\" although holding together by a close similarity in\r\nhaving merely white wings edged and spotted with black, yet differ\r\namongst themselves, so that we distinguish a larger kind, the large\r\ngarden-white, and a smaller, commoner kind, the smaller garden-white,\r\nand we distinguish also the green-veined white, and possibly the\r\nrare Bath white, each of them differing a little in their spots as\r\nwell as their size. These different sorts of \"whites\" can, once our\r\nattention is drawn to the matter, be readily distinguished from one\r\nanother, and constantly are found in our collections. We thus arrive\r\nat the conclusion that, though the whites are much alike, and are a\r\nkind distinct from the other kinds of butterflies, yet the \"whites\"\r\nthemselves can be divided into and arranged as several kinds distinct\r\nfrom one another. In fact, we discover (and an illustrated book on\r\nbutterflies confirms us in the conclusion) that there are several\r\nultimate kinds of whites which cannot be further separated into\r\ngroups. These are what are called \"species.\" The whites are therefore\r\nnot a single species, as are our British swallow-tails, but a group of\r\nspecies, closely related to one another. We find the same thing to be\r\ntrue with regard to the blues. Though they are much alike, agreeing in\r\na variety of details of spotting and colour, yet we can distinguish the\r\nchalk-hill blue, the common blue, the azure-blue, the Adonis blue, and\r\nothers, as distinct \"species\" of blues. Then, again, when we carefully\r\nexamine our English specimens of tortoise-shells, we find that there\r\nare two distinct \"species\"–the greater and the smaller–differing not\r\nonly in size, but in pattern; and when we compare with these the\r\npainted lady and the peacock and the red admiral, we find that there\r\nis a certain agreement of wing-pattern (venation and outline) and\r\ndetails of shape among them all, although their tints and the shape of\r\nthe spots and bands of colour differ. These different species \"hold\r\ntogether\" just as the whites do and just as the blues do. Naturalists\r\nhave met the need for expressing this similarity of a number of\r\ndistinct species to one another by introducing the term \"genus\" for\r\nsuch a group. In fact we arrange several species into a \"genus.\"\r\nThe \"genus\" is a \"kind,\" but a more comprehensive \"kind,\" than is a\r\nspecies. The species is an assemblage of _individuals_ closely alike to\r\none another; the genus is a group of _species_ which are more like to\r\none another than any of them are to other species.\r\n\r\nNaturalists give to every genus a name, and also a name to each species\r\nin the genus. Since we naturalists want to know what butterflies or\r\nother species of animals and plants are found in other countries, and\r\nto be sure that we all (whatever our native language may be) mean the\r\nsame thing by a name, Latin names are given to the genera and the\r\nspecies, and are necessarily used when one wishes to be sure that\r\none is understood. The greatest trouble is taken to make certain\r\nthat the name used is applied only to the original species and the\r\noriginal genus to which it was applied, for only so can one be sure\r\nthat a writer in America or one in Italy or France means the same\r\nthing by a name as we do here in England. This is rendered possible\r\nand is actually brought about by the preparation of catalogues in\r\nwhich the species are described and figured, especially with regard to\r\nobvious points of detail which are constant, and are called \"specific\r\ncharacters.\" These are chosen for special description, not haphazard,\r\nbut with a view to their being recognized with certainty by those\r\nwho study other specimens. Another extremely important proceeding\r\nin connection with this purpose of uniform naming, which involves\r\nvast labour and expense, is the maintenance of great collections of\r\npreserved animals and plants by the State in all civilized countries.\r\nIn these collections either the original specimens to which names were\r\ngiven by recognized describers (called \"type-specimens\" or \"the type\")\r\nare preserved, or else specimens which have been compared with those\r\noriginal described specimens, and authoritatively ascertained to be the\r\nsame as the \"type.\" The maintenance of accuracy and agreement in regard\r\nto the names of all the \"species\" of plants and animals is a big task.\r\nIt is now carried out by international councils, in which the skilled\r\nnaturalists of the world are represented. Certain principles have been\r\nagreed upon as to the method of determining the priority of one name\r\nover others which have been employed for one and the same species\r\nby naturalists of different countries and at different times, and a\r\ngeneral agreement as to what names are to be used has been arrived\r\nat. It is a matter which has involved a great deal of uncertainty\r\nand dispute, and still causes difficulty. By the exercise of good\r\nsense, and in consequence of the existence of an urgent desire really\r\nto understand one another, there is now every year an increasing\r\nuniformity and agreement among naturalists about the exact name to be\r\napplied to every species of living thing.\r\n\r\nReturning to our collections of butterflies and meadow flowers, we\r\nmay take the names of some of the species and genera as an example\r\nof the system of naming in use by scientific naturalists. The common\r\nswallow-tail is assigned to the genus Papilio. Its \"specific name\" is\r\n\"Machaon,\" given to it by Linnæus, hence it is spoken of as Papilio\r\nMachaon. It is found in various parts of Europe as well as in England.\r\nBut in Central Europe (often seen in Switzerland) there is also\r\nanother species of swallow-tail, which only occurs as a rare accident\r\nin England. This is the pale swallow-tail, differing, not only by its\r\npaler colour but by definite spots and markings of the wings, from the\r\nEnglish species. Its species name, or \"specific name,\" is \"Podalirius,\"\r\nand so it is known as Papilio Podalirius. Species of Papilio are found\r\nall over the world; more than 500 are known. Our two commonest whites\r\nbelong to the genus Pieris–they are called respectively Pieris brassicæ\r\n(the larger) and Pieris rapæ (the smaller). The green-veined white is\r\nPieris napi. Each of these three is called after the plant, cabbage,\r\nrape, or turnip, on which its caterpillar feeds. The rare Bath white is\r\nPieris daplidice. Its caterpillar feeds on mignonette. There are dozens\r\nof species in other parts of the world allied to our \"whites,\" which\r\nnaturalists have carefully distinguished and characterized by their\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\nSeveral of our most beautiful species of English butterflies which are\r\nmuch alike have been enrolled in one genus–the genus Vanessa. This\r\ngenus includes the great tortoise-shell, called Vanessa polychloros;\r\nthe smaller tortoise-shell, Vanessa urticæ; the peacock, Vanessa Io;\r\nthe painted lady, Vanessa cardui; the red admiral, Vanessa Atalanta;\r\nand the comma butterfly, Vanessa C-album. There are other European,\r\nAsiatic, and American species of Vanessa.\r\n\r\nIn the same way we find with our meadow plants that what we at\r\nfirst thought was a single kind, \"_the_\" buttercup really bears a\r\nname applicable to a genus in which are several common species. The\r\ngenus is called Ranunculus, and there are several common English\r\nspecies with yellow flowers, but distinguished from one another by\r\ndefinite characters. They are Ranunculus acris, Ranunculus flammula,\r\nRanunculus bulbosus, Ranunculus arvensis, Ranunculus ficaria (the\r\nlesser celandine). And then there is the white-flowered Ranunculus\r\naquatilis–a common pond plant. Clover, again, is by no means the name\r\nfor a single species. The clovers form the genus Trifolium, and in any\r\nEnglish meadow we may come across the white clover, Trifolium repens;\r\nthe red clover, Trifolium pratense; the hop clover, Trifolium agrarium:\r\nthe strawberry clover, Trifolium fragiferum; the haresfoot clover,\r\nTrifolium arvense. So it is with the plants which at first sight we\r\ndistinguish merely as \"daisies.\" There are several distinct genera of\r\ndaisies–Aster, Bellis, Chrysanthemum (ox-eye), Anthemis (camomile), and\r\nothers, with several distinct species in each genus.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show the reader that the mere notion of \"kinds\"\r\ndoes not carry the same meaning as \"species,\" but that there are a\r\nnumber of regularly occurring definite forms of both animals and plants\r\nwhich can be arranged in groups consisting only of individuals which\r\nare very nearly identical with one another. A group of living things of\r\nthis degree of likeness is called \"a species,\" and receives a name. A\r\nless degree of likeness holds together a number of species to form what\r\nwe call a genus, and the name of the genus is cited together with the\r\nname of the species when we wish to speak of the species with clearness\r\nand certainty. This system of double names we owe to the great Swedish\r\nnaturalist of the eighteenth century, Linnæus. He proposed also that\r\nthe relationships of living things to one another should be further\r\nexpressed by grouping like genera into \"families,\" then like families\r\ninto \"orders,\" and like orders into \"classes.\" And since his day we go\r\nfurther and group classes into \"phyla\" or great stems of the animal\r\npedigree. In this way a complete hierarchy or system of less and more\r\ncomprehensive groups has been established, and is the means by which\r\nwe indicate the natural groups of the family-trees of plants and of\r\nanimals, what, in fact, is called the \"classification\" of each of these\r\ngreat series of living things. Linnæus compared his system of groups to\r\nthe subdivisions of two armies. Thus, the one army represents the whole\r\nanimal series, the other the whole vegetable series. An army is divided\r\ninto (1) \"legions,\" these into (2) \"divisions,\" \"divisions\" into (3)\r\n\"regiments,\" regiments into (4) battalions, and battalions consist of\r\n(5) companies, consisting of individual soldiers. According to Linnæus,\r\nwe may compare the legions to classes, which are divided into orders,\r\ncomparable to divisions; these into families, comparable to regiments;\r\nthese into genera, comparable to battalions; and these into species,\r\ncomparable to companies, or ultimate groups of individual units or\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nJust as the legions, divisions, regiments, battalions and companies\r\nof an army have each their own name or at any rate a distinctive\r\nnumeral assigned to them in order that they may be cited and\r\ndirected, so are names given to each class, order, family, genus and\r\nspecies of the classification or enumeration of the kinds of animals\r\nand plants. Here, for instance, are the names of the greater and\r\nsmaller groups in which our common \"white\" finds itself enrolled.\r\n_Class_–Insects. _Order_–Lepidoptera. _Family_–Pieridæ. _Genus_–Pieris.\r\n_Species_–brassicæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT SPECIES\r\n\r\n\r\nI wrote in the last chapter of the recognition of that degree of\r\n\"likeness\" or kinship in animals and plants which we point to by the\r\nword \"species,\" and of the grouping of several similar species to\r\nform a \"genus,\" and of several genera to form a family, of families\r\nto form orders, and of orders to form classes–and of the giving of\r\nnames to all these groups. Whilst the making of this or that lot of\r\nspecies into a distinct _genus_, and giving it a new name is a mere\r\nmatter of convenience for the indication of more or less important\r\nagreements and divergences, and is to a large extent arbitrary or an\r\nexpression of opinion–it has always been recognized among naturalists\r\nthat the group called \"a species\" is not a mere convention, but has\r\na real natural limitation. It is true that the actual things which\r\nwe see in studying natural history are so many units or individuals.\r\nBut the possibility of arranging these by pattern, colour and shape\r\ninto ultimate companies of which all the units are alike and differ\r\nfrom all the units of another company, has been regarded as a natural\r\nfact of primary importance and not a mere convention or convenience.\r\nThe conception of the \"naturalness\" of a species depends really upon\r\na further qualification of great importance as to what we naturalists\r\nunderstand by it.\r\n\r\nWe find by rearing plants from seed and by causing animals to breed\r\nunder actual observation that the individuals of a species pair\r\nwith one another, and not with individuals of other species, and\r\nfurther, that the young which they produce are like the parents–show\r\nthemselves, in fact, to be of the same \"species.\" The species\r\ncontinually year after year reproduces itself with little variation,\r\nthough some variation does occur. The faculty of pairing only within\r\nthe group, of never naturally breeding with members of other groups,\r\nhas accordingly been adopted as a test of species. Hybrids between\r\ntwo species do not occur, except in very rare cases, in the state of\r\nnature. It is not always the case that the members of two species\r\ncannot possibly pair together, but it is the fact that they do not do\r\nso. Man sometimes brings about such crossing or hybridization, and\r\nit is a curious fact that the hybrids are often infertile or give\r\nrise only to weakly offspring, which could not survive in the natural\r\nstruggle for existence. Sometimes, however, when the two hybridized\r\nspecies happen to come from regions of the world remote from one\r\nanother, the resulting hybrids establish a vigorous race. There are\r\nreal obstacles (of which I will say more below) in natural conditions\r\nto hybrid-breeding between any two species which occur naturally in\r\nthe same territory. Thus the idea of a species is expanded so as to\r\nbe not merely \"a group of individuals of constant likeness in form\r\nand characteristics,\" but we add to that definition a living or\r\nconstitutional quality expressed by the words, \"which produce fertile\r\noffspring by pairing with one another, but do not pair with the members\r\nof other species.\"\r\n\r\nThis enables us to distinguish the conception of a \"species\" from that\r\nof a \"variety\" or a \"race.\" We find occasionally peculiarly-marked\r\nexamples of a species of plant or animal, or even local races of\r\npeculiar form; but we do not regard them as \"distinct species\" if\r\nwe find that they breed as a rule with the ordinary members of the\r\nspecies. The decisive test is the breeding. If the variety is found\r\nnot to breed with the regular species, but to keep apart and breed\r\nonly with other individuals like itself, then we say, \"This is no mere\r\nvariety! It is a distinct species!\" Unfortunately we have vast series\r\nof animals, insects, and others, from all parts of the world, collected\r\nand preserved in our museums, of which we know only the dead preserved\r\nspecimens. So that we cannot be sure in doubtful cases whether a series\r\nof forms differing a little from the ordinary members of a species\r\nindicate distinct species, as defined and tested by breeding. We have\r\nin such a case to note the difference, and record it either as a\r\nvariety or as a species by a guess at the probabilities one way or the\r\nother. Naturalists really _intend_ by the word \"species\" to designate\r\na form represented by numerous like individuals, which, in the\r\npresent natural conditions of the region they inhabit, have attained\r\na certain \"stability\" of distinctive form and character (not without\r\nsome variability within definite limits) and constitute a more or less\r\nwidely distributed population, the members of which inter-breed but do\r\nnot produce offspring with other allied species.\r\n\r\nA good case by which to exhibit further our conception of a species is\r\nthat afforded by the species which are united in the genus Equus–the\r\nhorse-genus. There are living at the present day several wild kinds\r\nof Equus–namely, the wild horse, or Tarpan, of the Gobi desert of\r\nMongolia, called after the Russian explorer Przewalski; two kinds of\r\nAsiatic wild ass, called the Kiang and the Onegar; the African wild\r\nass, and two or three kinds of zebra. There are, besides, many kinds\r\nof domesticated horses, ranging from the Shetland pony to the Flemish\r\ndray horse, and from the Shire horse to the Arab. Then there are many\r\nkinds of fossil extinct horses known, some of which clearly must be\r\nplaced in the genus Equus with the living kinds; others which have to\r\nbe separated into special genera (Hippidium, Onohippidium, etc.). Now,\r\nas to the living forms or form-kinds of the genus Equus–which are we\r\nto regard as true species, and which are only varieties and races of\r\nlower significance than species? The answer is clear enough in regard\r\nto several of them. The wild Mongolian horse and all the domesticated\r\nhorses are varieties, races, or breeds of one species, judged not only\r\nby such marks as the possession of callosities on both the hind and\r\nthe fore legs, but also by the test of breeding. They breed together\r\nand produce persisting races. But the asses and the zebras, though\r\nthey will form mules with the horse, do not in a state of nature\r\nfreely breed with it. When an ass or zebra is mated by man with the\r\nhorse it will produce hybrids, called \"Mules,\" but will not in \"a\r\nstate of nature\" _establish_ a hybrid race. The asses and the zebras\r\nare distinct from the horse, not only in markings and certain details\r\nof shape and hair, but in the fact that they cannot be fused into one\r\nrace with him. There are no sufficient experiments on the aloofness\r\nof zebras and asses from one another in regard to breeding, although\r\nit seems that they cannot establish a mixed race, and are, therefore,\r\ndistinct species judged by that test as well as by their form and\r\nmarking. It is not known whether the so-called species of wild ass–the\r\nAsiatic and the African–would prove to produce fertile or infertile\r\nmules if intercrossed, nor has the test been applied to the very\r\ndifferently-marked local races of the African zebras–Grevy's zebra,\r\nBurchell's zebra, and the mountain zebra. It is likely enough that the\r\nthree or more \"species\" distinguished among zebras on account of their\r\nbeing differently striped, and existing in different localities, would\r\nbe found to breed freely together, and prove themselves thus to be\r\nentitled to be regarded as local \"varieties\" or \"races,\" but not as\r\nfully-separated true species.\r\n\r\nThus one sees how difficult it is to have knowledge of the breeding\r\ntest, even in regard to large animals. It is obvious that the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining it in regard to the thousands of kinds of\r\nminute creatures is much greater. Yet when they say, \"This is a\r\ndistinct species,\" naturalists do mean that it is not only marked\r\noff from other animals or plants most like to it by a certain shape,\r\ncolour, or other quality or qualities, but that it breeds apart with\r\nits own kind and does not naturally hybridize with those other forms\r\nmost like to it.\r\n\r\nAlthough the kind of naturalist called a \"systematist\" who makes\r\nit his business to accurately describe and record and distinguish\r\nfrom one another all the existing species of some one group–say, of\r\nantelopes, of mice, of flowering plants, of fishes, or of fleas–has\r\nonly a knowledge in a few instances of the breeding of the organisms\r\nwhich he describes as \"distinct species,\" he yet does know, in regard\r\nto some one or more of his species in most groups, the facts of pairing\r\nand reproduction, and what are the limits of variation in the markings\r\nand other characteristics of at least one or two species definitely\r\nsubmitted to the \"breeding test,\" that is to say, ascertained to be\r\n\"true physiological species,\" kept apart by deep-seated chemical\r\ndifferences in their blood and tissues. Hence it is legitimate for\r\nhim, by careful balancing and consideration of all the facts, to\r\ndetermine–not absolutely, but by analogy–the value to be assigned\r\n(whether as indicating true species or merely varieties capable\r\nof pairing with the main stock) to points of difference among the\r\nspecimens of a dead collection brought from some distant land or from\r\nsome position in which it would be impossible to make observations\r\nwith regard to \"pairing\" and \"breeding true.\"\r\n\r\nSome 400 species of fleas have been described, and we are certain as\r\nto the value of the characters relied on to distinguish those species,\r\nowing to what we know of the breeding of some common species of fleas.\r\nThe flea of the domestic fowl, that of the domestic pigeon, that from\r\nthe house-martin, and that from the sand-martin–used to be considered\r\nas one species until they were carefully examined twenty years ago. In\r\nreality each of them has its own peculiar \"marks,\" and they do not mix\r\nwith one another. The nests of the sand-martin yield only one species\r\nof flea, namely that peculiar to the sand-martin. The hen-house,\r\nthe dove-cote, and the nests of the house-martin yield each their\r\nflea maggots, which can be reared and become in each case a distinct\r\nspecies with definite recognizable \"characters.\" On the other hand,\r\nthe flea of the rabbit gives an opportunity of studying the limits of\r\nvariation in a \"good\" species. Rabbit warrens swarm with the rabbit\r\nflea, and often a great number are found on one rabbit, the individual\r\nfleas \"varying\"–\"differing\" from one another to a slight extent. The\r\n\"systematist\" thus gets to know what organs are variable within the\r\nlimits of an undoubted physiological species of flea, and what are\r\ncomparatively constant–so that he can form a reasonable opinion about\r\nthe claim of other specimens which he may receive without full history\r\nof their habits, to be regarded as true distinct species.\r\n\r\nThe fact that most important chemical differences of the blood and\r\ndigestive juices often accompany the small external differences\r\nwhich enable us to distinguish one species of animal or plant from\r\nanother, makes it obvious that the knowledge of species is a very\r\nvaluable and necessary thing. One species of flea, the Pulex Cheopis,\r\nhabitually carries the plague bacillus from animals to man, and is\r\na cause of death; other species, extremely like it in appearance,\r\nbut distinguishable by a trained observer, do not carry the plague\r\nbacillus, but if they swallow it, destroy it by digestion. One species\r\nof gnat, the common grey gnat, digests and destroys malaria germs when\r\nit sucks them up with blood; in an allied species, the spot-winged gnat\r\nor Anopheles, the chemical juices of the gut allow the germ to live in\r\nit and multiply, and so to be carried to men by the gnat's bite. So\r\nwith many other flies and parasites the recognition of the dangerous\r\nspecies is of vital importance, and that recognition often depends on\r\nminute features of form and colour not at once obvious to an ordinary\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nBut this recognition of distinct species is, from the point of view of\r\nthe study of Nature, only a preliminary to the question, \"How did these\r\nspecies come about? How is it that there are so many species, some very\r\nlike one another, forming genera, and these genera grouped into related\r\nfamilies, these into larger groups, and so on, like the branches of\r\na family tree?\" The answer to these questions given by Linnæus was:\r\n\"There are just so many species as the Infinite Being created at the\r\nbeginning of things, and they have continued to propagate themselves\r\nunchanged ever since.\" The answer which we give to-day is that the\r\nappearance of a huge family tree which our classification of animals\r\ntakes is due to the simple fact that it really is neither more nor less\r\nthan a family tree or pedigree–the \"tree of life,\" of which the green\r\nleaves and buds are the existing species. Further, we hold that the\r\nexisting species of a genus have \"come into existence\" by natural birth\r\nfrom one ancestral species, its offspring having slightly varied (we\r\nare all familiar with this individual variation in our own species, in\r\ndogs, cats, trees, and shrubs), and that the varieties have wandered\r\napart and become continuously emphasized and selected for survival by\r\ntheir fitness or suitability to the changed conditions around each of\r\nthem. Meanwhile a natural destruction, or failure of intermediate forms\r\nto survive, has gone on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSPECIES IN THE MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\nA series of important conceptions are implied in the word \"species,\" as\r\nused by naturalists. Some of these we have noted in the last chapter.\r\nThere is first, as a starting-point, the conception that a species\r\nis a number or company of individuals, all closely and clearly alike\r\n(though presenting some minor individual variations), and capable of\r\nsharp separation by certain \"characters\" from other similar groups or\r\ncompanies. Then follows the addition (2) that the species is constant\r\nif the conditions of life are not changed, or but little changed, and\r\nthat year after year it reproduces itself without change. It has a\r\ncertain stability (but not permanent immutability) greater in some\r\nspecies than in others. Next we find (3) that the species constitutes\r\na group of individuals which have descended by natural breeding from\r\ncommon parents, not differing greatly from the present individuals.\r\nThey are, in fact, one \"stock.\" Then (4) that the species is a group,\r\nthe individuals of which pair with one another in breeding, but do not\r\npair with the individuals of another species, and that this is due to\r\nvarious peculiar and inherent chemical, physiological and (in higher\r\nanimals) psychological characteristics of the species.\r\n\r\nWe have now further to note that species have their special\r\ngeographical _centres of origin_ from which most spread only a small\r\ndistance, whilst others have a wonderful power of dispersal, and\r\nhave become cosmopolitan. Moreover, we find that some species are\r\nnumerically very abundant, others very rare; that rare and abundant\r\nspecies have often invaded each other's territory, and exist side by\r\nside.\r\n\r\nWhilst we often find a number of species, fifty or more, so much alike\r\nthat we unite them in a single genus (as, for instance, in the case\r\nof the cats, lions, tigers, leopards, which form the genus \"Felis,\"\r\nand the hundred or more species of the hedge brambles or blackberries,\r\nwhich form the genus \"Rubus\"), there are many species which to-day\r\nhave, as it were, lost all their relatives and stand alone, the\r\nsolitary species in a well-marked genus, or have perhaps only one\r\nother living co-species. And sometimes (curiously enough) that one\r\nco-species is an inhabitant of a region very remote from that inhabited\r\nby the other. Thus the two living mammals called tapirs (genus Tapirus)\r\ninhabit, the one the Malay region, and the other Central America. This\r\nis explained by the fact that tapirs formerly existed all over the\r\nland-surfaces of North Europe, North Asia, and North America, which\r\nconnect these widely-separate spots. We find the bones and teeth of\r\nthe extinct tapirs embedded in the Tertiary deposits of the connecting\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nOnce we have gained the fundamental conceptions as to what is meant by\r\na \"species,\" we are able intelligently to consider innumerable facts\r\nof the most diverse kind as to their peculiar structure and colours,\r\ntheir number, localities, their interaction and dependence on other\r\nliving things, their modifications for special modes of life, their\r\nisolation or their ubiquity. We can discuss their genetic relations\r\nto one another, and to extinct fossil species, which have all been to\r\na very large extent \"accounted for\" or \"explained\" by Mr. Darwin's\r\ntheory of the origin of species by the natural selection of favoured\r\nraces in the struggle for existence. But there is always more to be\r\nmade out–difficulties to be removed, new instances to be studied. The\r\nclassification of the genera of plants and animals, with their included\r\nspecies into larger groups, helps us to state and to remember their\r\nactual build and structure, and to survey, as it were, the living\r\nworld, from the animalcule to the man, or from the microbe to the\r\nmagnolia tree. Every one interested in natural history should carry\r\nin his mind as complete a scheme of the classification of animals and\r\nplants as possible.\r\n\r\nThe older naturalists held that species were suddenly \"created\" as\r\nthey exist, and have propagated their like ever since. Darwin has\r\ntaught us that the present \"species\" have developed by a slow process\r\nof transformation from preceding species, and these from other\r\npredecessors, and so on to the remotest geologic ages and the dawn\r\nof life. The agents at work have been \"variation\"–that is to say,\r\nthe response to the never-ceasing variation of the surrounding world\r\nor environment–and the survival in the struggle for existence of the\r\nfittest varieties so produced.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing surprising or extraordinary in the existence of\r\nvariation. The conditions of life and growth are never absolutely\r\nidentical in two individuals, and the wonder is not that species vary,\r\nbut that they vary so little. The living substance of animals and\r\nplants is an extremely complex chemical substance, ever decomposing and\r\never being renewed. It is the most \"labile\" as it is by far the most\r\nelaborately built-up chemical body which chemists have ever ventured to\r\nimagine. It differs, chemically, not only in every species but in every\r\nindividual and is incessantly acted upon–influenced as we may say–by\r\nthe ever-changing physical and chemical conditions around it. At the\r\nsame time it has, subject to the permanence of essential conditions,\r\na definite stability and limitation to its change or variation in\r\nresponse to variations of its environment. That part of the living\r\nsubstance which in all but the lowest plants and animals is set aside\r\nduring growth to form the eggs and sperms by which they multiply or\r\n\"reproduce\" themselves, is called the \"germ-plasm,\" and is peculiarly\r\nsensitive to variations in (that is a _change_ in) the environment of\r\nthe plant or animal.\r\n\r\nNew conditions of life (locality and climate)–unusual food or\r\nreproductive activity–act often in a powerful way upon the germ-plasm\r\nand cause it to vary–that is to say, they alter some of its qualities,\r\nthough not necessarily disturbing in any way the general living\r\nsubstance of the organism so far as to produce any important change\r\nperceptible to the human eye. In consequence, the young produced after\r\nsuch disturbance of the germ-plasm are found to differ more from their\r\nparents than in cases where no such disturbance has been set up by the\r\nnatural never-ceasing variation of the surrounding world. This fact\r\nis well known to horticulturists and breeders, and is made use of by\r\nthem. When a gardener wishes to obtain variations of a plant from which\r\nto select and establish a new breed, he deliberately sets to work to\r\ndisturb–to shake up, to act upon in a tentative, experimental way–the\r\ngerm-plasm of one or more parent plants by change of soil, climate,\r\nfood and often by cross-fertilizing them with another breed or variety.\r\nIn this way he to some extent \"breaks\" the constitutional stability of\r\nthe germ-plasm of the plant and obtains abundant \"variations\" in the\r\noffspring. These are not precisely foreseen, and show themselves in all\r\nparts of the new generation. But some of them are what the gardener\r\nwants, and are \"selected\" by him for retention, rearing and breeding.\r\n\r\nThe response of the germ-plasm of organisms to the stimulus of new\r\nenvironmental conditions has been compared to that of the well-known\r\npattern-producing toy–the kaleidoscope. The bits of glass, beads and\r\nsilk which you see in a kaleidoscope, forming by reflection in its\r\nmirrors a beautiful and definite pattern, are changed by a simple\r\nvibration caused by tapping the instrument into a very different\r\npattern, the coloured fragments being displaced and rearranged. The\r\napparent change or variation is very great though produced by slight\r\nmechanical disturbance, and the new pattern is altogether without any\r\nspecial significance–the fortuitous outcome of a small displacement\r\nof the constituent coloured fragments. We can imagine that similarly\r\nslight disturbances of the organic molecules of the germ-plasm may\r\nproduce considerable and important variations in it and the new growth\r\nto which it gives rise: and, further, that these variations may prove\r\nto be either (1) injurious, or (2) of life-saving value, or often\r\nenough (3) of no consequence whatever although bulking largely in our\r\nhuman eyes and thereby misleading our judgment of them.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt that the same sequence of events occurs\r\nin nature apart from man's interference. Changes occur in the earth's\r\nsurface, or the organism is transported by currents of water or\r\nair into new conditions. The germ-plasm is \"disturbed,\" \"shaken\"\r\nor \"shocked\" by those new conditions, and a variation, in several\r\nstructures and qualities of the offspring subsequently produced,\r\nfollows. Then also follows the selection of one of the new varieties by\r\nsurvival of the fitter to the new conditions into which the organism\r\nhas been transported or have developed in the region where it was\r\npreviously established.\r\n\r\nThis process of germ-variation is obviously as necessary and constant\r\na feature of the living organism as is the variation in the contour\r\nof land and sea and in the extent of the polar ice-cap–a necessary\r\nfeature of the physical conditions of the terrestrial globe. But it\r\nis the fashion with a certain school of writers nowadays to declare\r\nthat \"variation\" in organisms is a \"mystery\" unsolved. Another very\r\ncommon and almost universal error is to overlook the fact that\r\nvariation is constitutional and affects whole systems of organs and\r\ntheir deeply related parts, and is _not_, as it is so frequently and\r\nerroneously assumed to be, a mere local affair of patches and scraps\r\nvisible on this or that part of the surface of an animal or plant.\r\nThese superficial \"marks,\" readily seen and noted by the collector,\r\nare rarely of any life-saving importance: they are but the outward and\r\nvisible signs of deep-lying physiological or constitutional change or\r\nvariation. The varying organism has, like Hamlet, \"that within which\r\npasseth show\" and the superficial variations (like his \"inky cloak\"\r\nand other customary features of mourning) are but \"the trappings and\r\nthe suits\" of a deep-lying change. Variation is not an inexplicable\r\nmystery, nor, on the other hand, are \"varieties\" sufficiently dealt\r\nwith and their nature appreciated when one or two surface peculiarities\r\nare enumerated by which the collector can recognize them. A deeper\r\nstudy of the varying organism is both possible and needed.\r\n\r\nIf the gradual formation of new species from ancestral species is a\r\ntrue account of the matter, we must expect to find, at any rate here\r\nand there, if not frequently, traces of the process–for instance,\r\ngradations, or series of intermediate forms, connecting new,\r\nwell-established species with the ancestral form or with one another.\r\nWe do find such gradations–sometimes more, sometimes less, completely\r\npersisting over a wide tract of country, or discoverable in the\r\nfossiliferous deposits containing the remains of extinct animals.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when we look at the butterflies of a much larger region\r\nthan our little island–namely, at those of a great continent like\r\nAfrica or South America–we find that there are species which show\r\ngradations. Thus at a series of points, A, B, C, D, separated by some\r\nhundreds of miles from each other, we find a corresponding series of\r\nbutterflies which are apparently closely similar species of one genus,\r\ndiffering by a few spots of colour, or darker and lighter tint, much\r\nas our Large White, Garden White, and Green-veined White differ. But\r\nwhen the butterflies are caught which occur at points intermediate\r\nbetween A and B, B and C, C and D, we find intermediate varieties, and,\r\nin fact, if we get a very large number from intermediate regions, we\r\ncan, in some instances, arrange them in line so that they constitute\r\na graduated series of forms, each being scarcely distinguishable from\r\nthe one before or the one behind it, yet differing clearly from one a\r\ndozen places away. In such cases there is often evidence to show that\r\nthe variety found at A breeds with that found at B, that of B with that\r\nof C, of C with D, so that they form an inter-breeding group, though\r\nperhaps the varieties at D will not pair with those at A, or even\r\nwith those at B. Then sometimes we find in such a series, otherwise\r\ncomplete, a gap. Let us suppose it is between the butterflies of B and\r\nC. We find the series of gradations nearly complete, but some natural\r\ncondition–such as the encroachment of the sea, or the slow elevation\r\nof a mountain range, or the climatic destruction of the necessary\r\nfood-plant–has \"wiped out\" a few forms somewhere between those of B\r\nand C. They no longer exist. The series is no longer connected by\r\ninter-breeding forms; those occurring from A to B and some distance\r\nbeyond are one \"species\" varying in the direction of the series C\r\nto D, but abruptly broken off from the latter. The series C to D is\r\nalso a \"species\" with graduated varieties, but distinct; it is cut\r\noff from the lot once in continuity with it by the destruction of\r\nthe intermediate forms inhabiting an intermediate area. Thus the one\r\nspecies becomes two, and these may again break up, and, having become\r\nthus disconnected and stabilized, they may spread over one another's\r\nterritory–fly side by side and yet remain distinct forms which do not\r\npair together–although originally they were varieties spreading from a\r\ncommon centre, where the ancestral species lived and multiplied.\r\n\r\nOther similar gradational series of an interesting character have\r\nbeen noticed in the case of fresh-water fossil snail-shells. In the\r\nlayers of clay and marl exposed by digging a railway cutting or a\r\npit we may find that the successive layers represent a continuous\r\ndeposit of 100,000 years or more, and we find sometimes that a form of\r\nsnail-shell (not a species living to-day) occurs in the lowest stratum\r\nvery different from that occurring in the highest stratum–the lowest\r\nbeing short and spherical, the highest elongated and of differing\r\ntexture. In the intermediate layers, each 6 or 12 ins. thick and\r\noccupying perhaps altogether 30 ft. of vertical thickness, we find a\r\ngraduated series of snail-shells leading almost imperceptibly from\r\nthe oldest lowest form to the latest uppermost form. Such cases are\r\nknown. But it is an exceptional thing to find these graduated series\r\neither spread over an area of the earth's surface, or following one\r\nanother in successive strata. When they came into existence they were\r\nrapidly superseded and destroyed as a rule, and have left only one\r\nor two widely-separated examples of the intermediate forms. This we\r\nshould naturally expect by analogy from what we know of the successive\r\ntraces of human manufactures in the deposits on the site of some of the\r\ngreat cities of the ancient world which have been carefully excavated\r\nlayer by layer. But still we have the important fact that here and\r\nthere such gradational series have been found, and we are justified\r\nin considering a few isolated intermediate forms (which often occur\r\nconnecting two greatly-differing species) as survivors of a former\r\ncomplete graduated series of intermediate forms, which came into\r\nexistence by slow modification of an ancestral stock, and may, when\r\nthe stock was widely spread over a continental area, not merely have\r\nsucceeded one another in time, but actually coexisted in neighbouring\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nThere are many remarkable facts bearing upon the origin of \"species,\"\r\nthe description of which fills volumes written by such men as Darwin,\r\nWallace, Poulton, and others, and become interesting to every one who\r\nhas gained a correct notion of what naturalists mean by a \"species.\" I\r\nwill cite one in order to illustrate this. The bird which we call the\r\nred grouse, or nowadays simply \"grouse\" (the old Scotch name for it\r\nwas \"muir-fowl\"), is one of twenty-four birds (among the 400 species\r\nof birds which live in the British Islands), including several kinds\r\nof titmouse, the goldfinch, bullfinch, song-thrush, stonechat, jay,\r\ndipper, and others which are very closely similar to species of birds\r\nliving in Continental Europe, yet show some definite and constant\r\nmarks, such as small differences in the colour of a group of feathers,\r\nenabling us to distinguish the British from the Continental forms. Are\r\nthese twenty-four British forms to be regarded as distinct species?\r\n\r\nThe red grouse is placed in a genus called \"Lagopus,\" of which there\r\nare several species in the northern hemisphere. In Scotland the red\r\ngrouse, which is distinguished as Lagopus Scoticus, is accompanied by\r\na rarer species of Lagopus, which lives in high, bare regions. This is\r\nthe bird called by the Celtic name \"ptarmigan\"; it differs in several\r\npoints from the red grouse, and acquires white plumage in the winter,\r\nwhich the latter bird does not; it is called Lagopus mutus. Now in\r\nNorway we find also two species of grouse or Lagopus, called \"rypé\"\r\n(pronounced \"reeper\") by the Norwegians. One is the same bird in every\r\nrespect as the Scotch ptarmigan, and is known as \"the mountain rypé.\"\r\nThe other is very close to our red grouse, and is called \"the common\r\nor bush rypé,\" and by English naturalists the \"willow grouse,\" and\r\nby ornithologists \"Lagopus salicetus.\" It agrees in habits, voice,\r\neggs, and anatomical detail with our red grouse, but the back of the\r\ncock-bird of the red grouse and the whole plumage of the hen-bird\r\nhave a darker colour. Moreover, the willow grouse, like the ptarmigan\r\nor mountain rypé, turns white–acquires a white plumage–in the winter\r\nwhich the red grouse does not. Are the red grouse and the willow grouse\r\nto be regarded as distinct species? Our British red grouse lives on\r\nheather-grown moors; the willow grouse prefers the shrubby growths of\r\nberry-bearing plants interspersed with willows, whence its name. Their\r\nfood differs accordingly. Formerly the red grouse lived on the moors\r\nof the South of England, and when in Pleistocene times England was a\r\npart of the Continent of Europe the willow grouse and the red grouse\r\nwere one undivided species inhabiting all the north-west of Europe. It\r\nis probable, though the experiment would be almost impossible to carry\r\nout, that were the eggs of a number of willow grouse now brought to\r\nScotland and hatched on the moors, they would tend to keep apart from\r\nthe native red grouse, and not inter-breed with them, in which case we\r\nshould say that the Scotch form is a \"species on the make,\" or, even,\r\na completed and distinct species. On the other hand, it is possible\r\nthat the two forms would freely pair with another, and that the colour\r\nand winter coat of the one (probably that of the Scotch form if the\r\nexperiment were tried in Scotland) would predominate, and after some\r\ngenerations no trace of the other strain would be observable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSOME SPECIFIC CHARACTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting case, showing that qualities which are life-preserving\r\nunder certain severe conditions exist in some varieties of a species\r\nand not in others, was recorded some eight years ago. After a very\r\nsevere \"blizzard\" 136 common sparrows were found benumbed on the ground\r\nby Professor Bumpus at Providence, United States. They were brought\r\ninto a warm room and laid on the floor. After a short time seventy-two\r\nrevived and sixty-four perished. They were compared to see if the\r\nsurvivors were distinguished by any measurable character from those\r\nwhich died. It was found that the survivors were smaller birds (the\r\nsexes and young birds being separately compared) than those which died,\r\nand were lighter in weight by one-twenty-fifth than the latter. Also,\r\nthe birds which survived had a decidedly longer breastbone than those\r\nwhich died.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the late Professor Weldon found that in the young of the\r\ncommon shore-crab, taken in certain parts of Plymouth harbour, those\r\nwith a little peculiarity in the shape of the front of the shell\r\nsurvived when those without this peculiarity died. Many thousands were\r\ncollected and measured in this experiment. It is not necessary to\r\nsuppose that the distinguishing mark of the survivors in such cases\r\nis \"the cause\" of their survival. Such marks as the breadth of the\r\nfront part of the crab's shell and the length of a bird's breastbone\r\nvery probably are but \"the outward and visible signs of an inward and\r\n(physiological) grace.\"\r\n\r\nThe marks, little peculiarities of colour and proportionate size,\r\nor some peculiar knob or horn, by which the student of species\r\ndistinguishes one constant form from another, can rarely, if ever, be\r\nshown to have in themselves an active value in aiding or saving the\r\nlife of the species of plant or animal. The mark or \"character\" is an\r\naccompaniment of a chemical, nutritional, physiological condition,\r\nand is in itself of no account. It is what is called \"a correlated\r\ncharacter.\" Such, for instance, is the black colour of the skin\r\nof pigs which in Virginia, U.S., are found, as stated by Darwin,\r\nnot to be poisoned by a marsh plant (\"the paint-root,\" Lachnanthes\r\ntinctoria), whilst all other coloured and colourless pigs are. The pigs\r\nwhich are not black develop a disease of their hoofs which rot and\r\nfall off, causing their death when they eat this special plant \"the\r\npaint-root.\" The colour does not save the pig–it cannot correctly be\r\ncalled the _cause_ of the pig's survival–but is an accompaniment of the\r\nphysiological quality which enables the pig to resist the poisonous\r\nherb. So, too, with white-spotted animals. They are known to breeders\r\nas being liable to diseases from which others are free. Fantail pigeons\r\nhave extra vertebræ in their tails, and pouter pigeons have their\r\nvertebræ increased in number and size. But the vertebræ were never\r\nthought of and \"selected\" by the breeders. They only wanted a fanlike\r\nset of tail feathers in the one case, and a longer body in the other.\r\nSome varieties of feathering maintained by pigeon breeders lead to the\r\ngrowth of abundant feathers on the legs (as in Cochin-China fowls), and\r\nit is found that these feather-legged pigeons always have the two outer\r\ntoes connected by a web of skin. If it were a stabilized wild form we\r\nshould separate it as a species on account of its webbed toes, yet the\r\nreal selection and survival in the hands of the breeder had nothing to\r\ndo with the toes or their web, but was simply \"caused\" by these pigeons\r\nhaving feathers of \"survival or selection value\" in his judgment. Male\r\nwhite cats with blue eyes are deaf. If deafness were ever an advantage\r\n(a difficult thing to imagine), you would get a species of cat with\r\nwhite hair and blue eyes, and be led to distinguish the species by\r\nthose characters, not by the real cause of survival, namely, deafness.\r\nNot enough is yet known of this curious and very important subject\r\nof correlation, but its bearing on the significance of \"specific\r\ncharacters\" is sufficiently indicated by what I have said.\r\n\r\nAn interesting group of species, three of which are to be purchased\r\nalive through London fishmongers, are the European crayfishes, not to\r\nbe confused with the rock-lobster or Langouste (Palinurus), sometimes\r\ncalled \"crawfish\" in London, nor with the Dublin prawn (Nephrops).\r\nThe little river crayfishes are like small lobsters, and were placed\r\nby older naturalists in one genus with the lobsters. Now we keep the\r\nEuropean species of crayfishes as the genus Astacus, and the common\r\nlobster and the American lobster have been put (by H. Milne-Edwards)\r\ninto a separate genus (Homarus). You can buy in London the \"écrevisses\r\nà pattes rouges\" of French and German rivers, which is called Astacus\r\nfluviatilis, and differs from that of the Thames and other English and\r\nEuropean rivers (which you can also buy) called A. pallipes (\"pattes\r\nblanches\" of the French), by the bright orange-red tips of its legs,\r\nand by having the side teeth of the horn or beak at the front of the\r\nhead larger and more distinct. The English crayfish grows to be nearly\r\nas large as the \"pattes rouges\" in the Avon at Salisbury, though it has\r\nnearly disappeared about Oxford. You can also sometimes buy in London\r\nthe big, long-clawed Astacus leptodactylus of East Europe. There are\r\ntwo or three other species, named and distinguished, which do not come\r\ninto the London market.\r\n\r\nCrayfishes, lobsters and the like have groups of plume-like gills\r\n(corresponding in the most ancient forms to the number of the legs\r\nand jaw-legs) overhung and hidden by the sides of the great shield or\r\n\"head\" of the animal. The common lobsters and crayfishes retain most\r\nof these in full size and activity, but have lost in the course of\r\ngeologic ages the original complete number. These plume-like gills–each\r\nhalf an inch or so in length–are attached, some to the bases of the\r\nlegs and some to the sides of the body above the legs. In the ancestral\r\nform there were thirty-two plumes on each side, twenty-four attached\r\nto the bases of the legs, and eight placed each at some distance above\r\nthe connection of one of the eight legs with the side of the body. It\r\nis those on the side of the body which have suffered most diminution\r\nin the course of the development of modern crayfishes (and lobsters)\r\nfrom the ancestral form provided with the full equipment of thirty-two\r\ngill-plumes on each side. In fact, only one _well-grown_ gill-plume,\r\nout of the eight which should exist on each side of the body-wall,\r\nis to be found–and that is the one placed above the insertion of the\r\nhindermost or eighth of the eight legs (eight when we reckon the\r\nthree jaw-legs as \"legs\" as well as the five walking-legs). In front\r\nof this the side or wall of the body is bare of gill-plumes though\r\nthey are present in full size on the basal part of most of the legs.\r\nNevertheless, when one examines carefully with a lens the bare side\r\nof the body overhung by the head-shield or \"carapace,\" one finds in a\r\nspecimen of the common English \"pale-footed crayfish\" a very minute\r\ngill-plume high above the articulation of the seventh leg and another\r\nabove the articulation of the sixth leg. They are small dwindled\r\nthings, as though on the way to extinction, and are the mere vestiges\r\nof what were once well-grown gill-plumes, and still are so in the rock\r\nlobster and some prawns. In the red-footed crayfish of the Continent\r\n(Astacus fluviatilis) yet another minute vestige of a gill-plume is\r\nfound, farther in front, on the body-wall above the fifth leg on\r\neach side of the animal. This furnishes a definite mark or character\r\nby which we can distinguish the red-footed crayfish from the common\r\nEnglish pale-footed one. But these three rudimentary gill-plumes in the\r\nred-foot species, and two in the pale-foot species are all that until\r\nlately were recorded. The region of the body-wall above the fourth,\r\nthird, second, and first of the legs was declared to be devoid even of\r\na vestige of the branchial plumes which were there in ancestral forms,\r\nand have been retained more or less in some exceptional prawn-like\r\ncreatures allied to the crayfish.\r\n\r\nZoologists take a special interest in the crayfish because it is found\r\nto be a most convenient type for the purpose of teaching the principles\r\nof zoology to young students, and with that end in view was made the\r\nsubject of a very beautiful little book by the great teacher Huxley.\r\nThe conclusions above stated in regard to the gills are set forth in\r\nthat book with admirable illustrative drawings, and the striking fact\r\nof the dwindling and suppression of the various gill-plumes is clearly\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.–The rudimentary gill-plume of a crayfish\r\nfrom that part of the body-wall to which the first pair of jaw-legs\r\n(maxillipedes) is articulated. Found in the red-footed crayfish\r\n(Astacus fluviatilis) but in no other species of Astacus. It is\r\none-fifteenth of an inch long. Drawn by Miss Margery Moseley in 1904.\r\n(\"Quart. Journal of Microscopical Science,\" vol. 26 (1904-5).)]\r\n\r\nAnd now we come to an interesting discovery in this matter of the\r\ngill-plumes of crayfishes. Some fifteen years ago the daughter of my\r\nfriend and colleague–Professor Moseley–was a member of the class of\r\nElementary Biology at Oxford. She had to examine and identify these\r\nand other points in the structure of the crayfish. The class was\r\nsupplied with specimens of the French red-footed crayfish \"Astacus\r\nfluviatilis,\" as it is more readily obtained from fishmongers than\r\nour own \"pale-foot\" or \"Astacus pallipes.\" She found in her specimen\r\nfar forward on each side of the \"head\" a very minute gill far away\r\nfrom the others and previously unknown. The demonstrator in charge of\r\nthe class refused even to look at her discovery. So she confirmed it\r\nby examining three other specimens–made drawings of the tiny branched\r\ngill (as shown in Fig. 33) and their position, and sent them to me\r\nin London. It was at once clear that she had discovered in this much\r\nstudied little animal a very interesting pair of gills (right and\r\nleft)–unknown to Huxley and the rest of the zoological world. She\r\nproceeded to examine specimens of A. fluviatilis from various rivers of\r\nGermany and France and always found the new gill-plume. She also showed\r\n(I supplied her with specimens at the Natural History Museum) that it\r\nwas, on the other hand, absent from A. leptodactylus, A. pallipes,\r\nand all the foreign species (some from Asia) which are known, and she\r\npublished an illustrated account of it in the \"Quarterly Journal of\r\nMicroscopical Science.\" This tiny gill-plume is placed very far forward\r\non each side of the body, the farthest point forward at which any\r\ngill-plume is found in any kind of prawn, shrimp or lobster, namely\r\nin the region where the first pair of jaw-legs is attached, so that\r\nthere are three empty spaces between it and the rudimentary gill over\r\nthe fifth pair of legs, already known in the red-footed crayfish. It\r\nis only two millimetres long–about one-fifteenth of an inch! But its\r\npresence serves very distinctly to separate the red-footed crayfish,\r\nAstacus fluviatilis of French and German rivers, thus discovered\r\nto have four pairs of rudimentary gill-plumes, from the Astacus\r\nleptodactylus of the Danube basin and East Europe, which has only three\r\npairs, and still more to emphasize the difference between it and our\r\nBritish species, the \"white-foot\" or Astacus pallipes, which has only\r\ntwo!\r\n\r\nThis little history is noteworthy, firstly, because it shows that a\r\nyoung student may, to use an appropriate term, \"wipe the eye\" of an\r\nexpert observer and rightly venerated teacher (who would have delighted\r\nin the little discovery had he been alive), as well as the eyes of\r\ntens of thousands of students and teachers (including myself) who have\r\nstudied the red-foot crayfish year after year, and missed the little\r\ngill. It is also interesting as showing us a good sample of a specific\r\nmark or character which has no survival value; that is, could not\r\nadvantage the crayfish in the struggle for life. The fact is, that this\r\none particular very minute forward pair of gill-plumes is like the\r\nother rudimentary gills–a survival in a reduced condition of a pair of\r\ngill-plumes which were well-grown, useful plumes aerating the blood,\r\nin the prawn-like ancestors of all crayfishes, lobsters, shrimps, and\r\nprawns, and is, owing to circumstances of nutrition and growth which we\r\nknow nothing about but can vaguely imagine, retained by the red-foot\r\nspecies of crayfish, but lost by all other crayfishes, lobsters,\r\ncommon prawns and shrimps, and, in fact, only retained besides by a\r\nvery few out-of-the-way kinds of marine prawns. That is the sort of\r\nthing which frequently has to serve as \"a specific character\" or mark,\r\ndistinguishing one \"species\" from another.\r\n\r\nA more ample discussion of the origin of species is not within the\r\nscope of this book. But I may say that until recently the conception\r\nthat _every_ organ, part and feature of a plant and animal _must_\r\nbe explained, and can _only_ be explained, as being of life-saving\r\nvalue to its possessor, and accordingly \"selected\" and preserved in\r\nthe struggle for existence, was held by many \"Darwinians\" in too\r\nuncompromising a spirit. This conception was, really from the first,\r\nqualified by the admission that the life-saving value and consequent\r\npreservation of a structure must undoubtedly in some cases have been\r\nin operation in ancestors of the existing species, and is no longer\r\noperative in their descendants although they inherit the structure\r\nwhich has now become useless. Moreover, the operation of those subtle\r\nlaws of nutrition and of form which are spoken of as the \"correlation\r\nof parts in growth and in variation\" (mentioned on p. 119) was pointed\r\nout by Darwin himself as probably accounting for many remarkable\r\ngrowths, structures and colour-marks which we cannot imagine to be\r\nnow, or ever to have been in past ancestry, of a life-saving value.\r\nNevertheless, the old \"teleology,\" according to which, in pre-Darwinian\r\ndays, it was held that every part and feature of an animal or plant has\r\nbeen specially created to fulfil a definite pre-ordained function or\r\nuseful purpose, still influenced the minds of many naturalists. Natural\r\nselection and survival of the fittest were reconciled with the old\r\nteleological scheme, and it was held that we must as good Darwinians\r\naccount for every structure and distinctive feature in every animal and\r\nplant as due to its life-saving value. Herbert Spencer's term, \"the\r\nsurvival of the _fittest_,\" conduced to the diffusion of this extreme\r\nview: Darwin's equivalent term, \"the preservation of _favoured_ races,\"\r\ndid not raise the question of greater or less fitness.\r\n\r\nThe extreme view is now, however, giving place to the recognition\r\nof the fact that the actual tendencies to variation–accumulated in\r\nthe living substance of the various stocks or lines of descent and\r\nhanded on during an immense succession of ages of change by hereditary\r\ntransmission–counts for more in the production of new species and\r\nstrange, divergent, even grotesque forms of both animals and plants\r\nthan had been supposed.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly selection or survival of the fittest mainly accounts for\r\nthe colouring and adaptive shaping of living things, and so for those\r\nseveral great types of modelling which arrest the eye and have excited\r\nthe interest of inquisitive man. But there seems to be no justification\r\nfor the assumption that in all cases a variation–that is to say, an\r\nincrease or a diminution of the volume of some existing structure in\r\nproportion to other coexisting structures in the body of a living plant\r\nor animal–must be _either_ favourable, that is, conducive to survival,\r\n_or_ injurious, that is, tending to the defeat and destruction of its\r\npossessors or their race. On the contrary, it is the fact that there\r\nare vast areas and conditions related to countless myriads of living\r\ncreatures in which variations of those creatures of large and imposing\r\nkind and degree are neither advantageous nor disadvantageous, but\r\nmatters of _absolute indifference_, that is to say, without any effect\r\nupon the preservation or survival of their race or stock. Nature is\r\nfar more tolerant than some of us were inclined to assume. In certain\r\nrestricted conditions of competition and in regard to some special\r\nstructures and components which are often so minute and obscure as\r\nto be not yet detected by that recent arrival, the investigating\r\nbiologist–though sometimes, fortunately for him, large enough to\r\njump to his eyes–it is undeniable that there must be a \"survival\" or\r\n\"favouring\" of individuals presenting a variation in increase, or it\r\nmay be decreased, of this or that special feature of its \"make-up\" or\r\nstructural components. But it is a more correct statement of the case\r\nto say that natural selection or survival preserves _not the fittest_,\r\nbut _the least fit possible_ under the circumstances–namely, all those\r\nwhich, however great their divagations and eccentricities of variation\r\nin other respects, yet at the same time attain to a minimum standard\r\nof qualification in those structures (or inner chemical qualities)\r\nessential for success in the competition for safety, food and mating\r\ndetermined by the particular conditions in which the competition is\r\ntaking place. Consequently forms which are meaningless so far as\r\nstandards of utility or \"life-saving\" are concerned, and are rightly\r\ndescribed as grotesque, monstrous, gigantic or dwarfed–excessive (as\r\ncompared with more familiar kinds) in hypertrophy or atrophy of their\r\ncolouring and clothing, or of out-growths such as leaves of plants and\r\nlimbs, jaws or other regions of the body of animals–are found existing\r\nin various degrees of eccentricity in every class of both plants and\r\nanimals. Among animals such tolerated \"exuberances of non-significant\r\ngrowth\" are more striking than in plants. The group of fishes seems\r\nto be especially privileged in this way. They are freely variable in\r\nthe position of the fins, the suppression or exaggeration of them, as\r\nwell as of the scales on the surface of the body (_e.g._ leather carp\r\nand mirror carp). Take, for example, the mackerel and the salmon as\r\nstandards of utilitarian adaptation of the body to an active life in\r\nsea or river, and then compare with theirs the astounding proportions\r\nof the sun-fish (Orthagoriscus) like a cherub \"all head and no body,\"\r\nor the almost incredible Pteraclis–with its little body framed\r\nimmovably between a huge dorsal and a huge ventral fin (see figures\r\non p. 130). The fin-like crest of enormous size on the back of the\r\ngreat extinct lizard Dimetrodon of the Permian age supported by long\r\nbony spines is a similarly excessive and useless outgrowth. (This\r\nastonishing creature is shown in our Frontispiece.) Such exuberant\r\nproducts may be ascribed to an unrestrained \"momentum\" of growth\r\nwhich once set going by fortuitous variation has been _tolerated_\r\nbut not _favoured_ by natural selection. Or (as supposed by some)\r\ntheir excessive development may be due to the _persistence_ of some\r\nnutritional condition which at first resulted in a moderate growth of\r\nthe fin-like crests in question as a serviceable structure, but has\r\npersisted and increased long after the fin or crest has attained a\r\nsufficient size–simply because its increase though of no life-saving\r\nvalue–yet was not harmful and so did not bring its owner under the\r\nguillotine of natural selection. Such disproportionate exuberance of\r\ngrowth due to innate variability, tolerated but not specially favoured\r\nby natural selection, will account for many strange and grotesque forms\r\nof living things. From time to time in the long process of change, such\r\nexuberances may suddenly become of service and be, so to speak, taken\r\nin hand by natural selection, or they may become dangerous and lead\r\nto the extermination of the stock in which they have been previously\r\ntolerated.\r\n\r\nBefore my reader turns–as I hope he or she will do–to some handbook of\r\nzoology in which the genealogical tree or classification of the species\r\nof animals and of plants is treated at length, I will endeavour to\r\ngive some estimate of the immense numbers of \"species\" which exist. As\r\nto mere individuals, it is impossible to form any estimate, but when\r\nwe reckon up the teaming population of a meadow or forest in England,\r\nthe hundreds of thousands of plants, including the smallest mosses and\r\ngrasses, as well as the larger flowers, shrubs, and trees, the still\r\ngreater number of insects, spiders, snails, and larger animals and\r\nbirds, feeding on and hiding among them, and when we remember that in\r\nthe ever-warm tropical regions of the earth life is ten or twenty\r\ntimes more exuberant than with us,–then the immensity of the living\r\npopulation of the land and water of the globe becomes as difficult to\r\nrealize as are the figures in which the astronomer tells of the number\r\nand distances of the stars. On the other hand, some idea of the number\r\nof distinct species of animals and plants which have up to this date\r\nbeen recognized and described by naturalists as at present existing,\r\nmay be formed by a statement of those which have been described in\r\nsome of the more familiar groups. About 10,000 species of mammals have\r\nbeen described; about 14,000 of birds; 7000 of reptiles; 15,000 of\r\nfishes; 500,000 of six-legged insects; 14,000 of crustacea (shrimps,\r\nlobsters, crabs); 62,000 of molluscs (snails, mussels, etc.); 15,000\r\nof star-fishes and sea-urchins; 5000 of corals and polyps; 3000 of\r\nsponges; and 6000 of microscopic protozoa. In all about 800,000 species\r\nof animals have been recorded, and probably as many more remain yet to\r\nbe recognized and described.\r\n\r\nThe total number of described species of plants has never been\r\nestimated, but some idea of it may be formed from the fact that 1860\r\nspecies of flowering plants alone have been distinguished in Britain,\r\n17,000 in British India, and 22,000 in Brazil, not to mention those of\r\nAfrica and Australia! These figures do not include the vast numbers of\r\nflowerless plants, the ferns, mosses, sea-weeds, mushrooms, moulds,\r\nlichens, and microscopic plants.\r\n\r\nAnd then we have to add to these enumerations of living species the\r\nextinct species of successive geological ages, the remains of which are\r\nsufficiently well preserved to admit of identification. Those which are\r\nknown are only a few thousands in number, and a mere fragment of the\r\nvast series of species which _have_ existed in successive past ages of\r\nthe earth. They are a few samples of the predecessors of the existing\r\nspecies, and some of them were the actual ancestors of those existing\r\nto-day. The larger number of them have left no direct issue, but\r\nrepresent side branches of the \"tree of life\" which have died out ages\r\nago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRANGELY-SHAPED FISHES.–1. The Coffer-fish (Ostracion);\r\n2. Pteraclis, an oceanic fish allied to the so-called Dolphins; 3. The\r\nSun-fish (Orthagoriscus); 4. An Australian Blenny Patæcus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHYBRIDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject treated in this and the next chapter is one of the most\r\ninteresting to mankind, and is surrounded by extraordinary prejudice,\r\nsentiment, and ignorance. It is one upon which really trustworthy\r\ninformation is to a very large extent absent–and difficult to obtain.\r\nI cannot profess to supply this deficiency, but I can put the matter\r\nbefore the reader.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-established fact that the various \"kinds\" of animals and\r\nof plants do not breed promiscuously with one another. The individuals\r\nof a \"species\" only breed with other individuals of that \"species.\"\r\nThey do not even, as a habit, breed with the individuals of an allied\r\nspecies. So nearly universal is this rule that it was for a long time\r\nheld by naturalists to be an absolute definition of \"a species,\" that\r\nit is a group of individuals capable of producing fertile young by\r\nbreeding with one another and incapable of producing fertile young by\r\nmating with individuals of another such group, which were, therefore,\r\nheld to constitute a distinct species. The practical importance of this\r\ndefinition was that it could, in a large number of instances among\r\nanimals, and still more amongst plants, be made use of as a test and\r\ndecided by experiment.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that popular belief amongst country-folk and\r\nthose who have opportunities of coming to a conclusion on so simple\r\nand direct a question has never accepted this law of the limitation\r\nof species in breeding as more than a general rule to which it has\r\nalways been supposed that frequent exceptions occur. I mention this\r\nnot in order to add that \"there is always some basis of truth in\r\nthese popular beliefs,\" but on the contrary to point out that popular\r\nbeliefs on such matters are very frequently altogether erroneous, and\r\nthough their origin can sometimes be explained, it is rare to find\r\nthat they are due, in however small a degree, to true observation and\r\ninference. Where the subject under consideration has the obscurity\r\nand strong fascination for the natural man which all that relates to\r\nthe processes of life, growth, and reproduction possess, we find that\r\ntraditional fancies of the most unwarrantable kind are current, and\r\nhold their ground with tenacity even at the present day. Some 250 years\r\nago, and earlier–in fact, before the commencement of that definite\r\nepoch of \"the New Philosophy\" marked by the foundation of the Royal\r\nSociety of London–any queer-looking animal brought from remote lands,\r\nand any misshapen monstrosity born of cattle, sheep, dogs, or men, was\r\n\"explained,\" and confidently regarded as a \"hybrid,\" the result of a\r\n\"cross\" or irregular coupling of two distinct species of animals to\r\nwhich the \"monster\" presented some fanciful resemblance. Whole books\r\nwere devoted to the description and picturing of such supposed examples\r\nof mis-begotten progeny.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the existence of such extraordinary hybrids is still\r\ncommon among so-called \"well-educated\" people. I have with difficulty\r\navoided causing annoyance and offence to a friend, a celebrated\r\npainter, by refusing to admit that a deformed cat, of which he gave me\r\nan account, was a hybrid between a cat and a rabbit. A very eminent\r\nperson whom I was conducting some years ago round the galleries of the\r\nNatural History Museum, declared, as we stood in front of the specimen\r\nof the Okapi of the Congo Forest, that it was clearly a hybrid between\r\nthe giraffe and the zebra. He insisted that it was obvious that such\r\nwas its explanation, and pointed to its striped haunches and legs, and\r\nits cloven hoofs and giraffe-like head. I failed to change his opinion.\r\n\r\nIt is the fact–ascertained by careful observation of natural\r\noccurrences and by experiment–that, in spite of the almost absolute\r\nlaw or general truth to the effect that the members of a species\r\n(whether of plant or animal) only produce fertile offspring by mating\r\nwith members of that same species, yet there are rare instances\r\nknown in which individuals of two distinct but allied species have\r\nmated and produced fertile offspring. The cases in which such unions\r\nhave resulted in the production of offspring, but in which the\r\noffspring so produced prove to be infertile–that is, incapable of\r\nproducing offspring in their turn–are much more numerous. An important\r\ndistinction has also to be made between cases of either fertile or\r\ninfertile hybrid-production which occur spontaneously in nature, and\r\nthose in which man by separating the parent animals or plants from\r\ntheir natural conditions of life, or by bringing about impregnation (as\r\nin \"pollinating\" one flower with the pollen-dust of another) succeeds\r\nin obtaining a \"cross\" or \"hybrid,\" whether fertile or infertile, not\r\nknown to occur in \"wild\" (that is, not humanly controlled) nature.\r\nThe rarest case would be that of the production of fertile hybrids\r\nin uncontrolled natural conditions. Such possibly occur in the case\r\nof some fishes in which the fertilization of the eggs takes place in\r\nwater, the fertilizing microscopic sperms passing from the males like\r\ndust into the water and thus reaching the eggs laid by the females.\r\nOccasionally hybrids are thus produced between some common fresh-water\r\nfishes–species of the same genus–and between species of flat-fish,\r\nsuch as the turbot and the brill, though it is difficult to be sure\r\nthat the rare hybrids so produced are fertile even if they attain\r\nto maturity. The same is true as to certain small flowering plants\r\nhaving distinct regions of natural distribution and occurrence.\r\nAt the confines of the regions proper to two such allied species,\r\ninsects passing from one to the other do sometimes effect a reciprocal\r\nfertilization of the two species, and a natural hybrid is the result.\r\nHere, again, it is difficult to follow the subsequent history of the\r\nhybrids, but it is believed that in some instances they are fertile,\r\nand that the hybrid race is only gradually merged by subsequent\r\ncrossing into one or other of the parent species. Not a single instance\r\nis on record of the production of a \"natural\" hybrid (that is to say,\r\none produced in natural conditions without man's interference), whether\r\nfertile or infertile, between two species of the larger animals (such\r\nas between horse and ass or zebra and ass, or between lion and tiger\r\nor any of the species of cats, or between species of bears) or birds\r\n(such as pheasants of various species, including the jungle cock, the\r\nwild original of our domestic fowl, or between various species of\r\nducks, various species of geese, or between various species of the\r\ngrouse-birds).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in conditions brought about by man–that is to say,\r\nconfinement in cages or paddocks, or at any rate removal from their\r\nnative climate and home–all the groups of species just cited commonly\r\nand frequently produce hybrids _inter se_, that is, one or more species\r\nof the horse group thus inter-breed with one another, so will certain\r\nspecies of cats, certain species of bears, many species of pheasants,\r\nalso of ducks, of geese, and of grouse. In nearly every case the\r\nhybrids so produced are infertile; they will not mate with a similar\r\nhybrid, and even when mated with one of the parent species rarely\r\nproduce offspring, though they sometimes do so. The best cases of the\r\nproduction of fertile hybrids are between species of flowering plants\r\nbrought to this country from widely separated regions. The surprising\r\nand instructive result has been obtained that a cross between two\r\nallied species (that is, of one and the same \"genus\") which will fail\r\naltogether or \"come to nothing\" as infertile hybrids–if the two species\r\ncrossed are from the same or contiguous regions–yet will yield readily\r\nvigorous fertile hybrid offspring when the two species (always, of\r\ncourse, of one and the same genus) have their native homes in widely\r\nseparate parts of the world–as, for instance, the Indian Himalaya range\r\nand the South American Andean range.\r\n\r\nThis has been found in crossing species of rhododendrons, of orchids,\r\nand of many other plants with which horticulturists occupy themselves\r\nfor commercial purposes. It is in some ways the reverse of what one\r\nmight expect. It would be reasonable to suppose that allied species\r\nfrom the same climate and geographical region would have more affinity\r\nand be more readily hybridized than species from widely remote and\r\nphysically differing regions. But the reverse is the case, many\r\nthriving hybrid stocks which duly fertilize and set their seed are now\r\nin cultivation, having been produced by the union of parent species\r\nfrom \"the opposite ends of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe consideration of this case throws some light on the significance\r\nof the non-occurrence of natural hybrids and of the very remarkable\r\nand curious fact that hybrids are so usually sterile. When we come\r\nto think of it, the natural preliminary assumption should be (as is\r\nthat of unsophisticated humanity) that any animal or plant might, so\r\nfar as possibilities go, breed with any other; and the questions to\r\nbe answered are: (1) What advantage to a species is it not to be able\r\nto hybridize with other species, and (2) how–that is to say, by what\r\nstructure or by what subtle chemical differences or other features in\r\ntheir make-up and habit–are they prevented from so hybridizing? Then we\r\ncome on further to the question, Why should a hybrid, once produced,\r\nfail to bear healthy eggs or sperms according to its sex, although it\r\ngrows up to full size and is to all appearances mature? And why should\r\nhybrids between parents of origin locally remote from one another not\r\nshow this failure, but behave like ordinary healthy organisms?\r\n\r\nIn the full solution of these inquiries we should get very near to some\r\nof the most important secrets of the living body which have still to\r\nbe searched out. But a reply to these questions which is probably in\r\nlarge measure true, and serves to help us in the further collection\r\nand examination of facts, is as follows: First, the production and\r\nmaintenance of \"species\" of plants and of animals by survival of\r\nfavourable variations in the struggle for existence (Darwin and\r\nWallace's theory of the origin of species) requires the maintenance of\r\nthe purity of the favourable stock which survives in the struggle. If\r\nit were continually liable to hybridization by other species it would\r\nnever establish its own distinctive features. It would deteriorate\r\nby departing from those characteristics which have been \"naturally\r\nselected\" and have rendered it a successful \"species.\" Thus the\r\nbreeder, when he has selected a stock for propagation which approaches\r\nthe standard at which he is aiming, keeps it apart, and does not allow\r\nit to be \"crossed\" by other stock. One of the qualities \"naturally\r\nselected\" in \"the wild\" is the power of resistance to fertilization by\r\nneighbouring species.\r\n\r\nThis power of resistance or immunity to fertilization by other species\r\nmay be attained by several different methods. Amongst these are (1)\r\na difference in the season of breeding or sexual ripening; (2) the\r\nproduction of secretions (whether by plant or by animal) which poison\r\nor paralyse the fertilizing sperms of allied and locally associated\r\nspecies, but are harmless to those of the secreting species; (3) the\r\nmechanical differences of size, etc., which prevent the fertilizing\r\nmaterial of a strange species from gaining access to the egg-cells;\r\n(4) psychical activities (antipathies) in the case of animals or mere\r\nattraction and repulsion by odoriferous substances, which serve to\r\nrepel a strange species, but are attractive to individuals of the same\r\nspecies; (5) finally, a chemical and physiological incompatibility\r\nbetween the sperms of one species and the germs of another (as distinct\r\nfrom the attraction or repulsion of the entire living individual),\r\nwhich, even when all other difficulties are absent or have been\r\novercome, may be, and frequently is, present, so that the spermatozoon\r\ncannot penetrate the egg-cell even when resting upon it, but may be\r\nparalysed or repelled, and in any case is not guided and drawn into the\r\naperture of the egg-covering, called the micropyle, or \"little entry,\"\r\nso as to fuse with and fertilize the egg.\r\n\r\nThe operation of these hindrances to hybrid fertilization and breeding\r\nhave been ascertained in several different instances. It is not always\r\npossible, and certainly not easy to ascertain, which is at work in\r\nany and every case. But we can well conceive that one or other of\r\nthese agencies have been developed and accentuated by survival of\r\nthe fittest, so as to protect a species against fertilization by a\r\nneighbouring species, and thus to enable it to maintain its own \"bundle\r\nof characteristics\" free from the swamping effects of \"mixture\" (that\r\nis, \"hybridization\") with another species. It is also thus intelligible\r\nthat an allied species from a distant land against which our native\r\nspecies and its closer ancestry–struggling for purity of race–have had\r\nno occasion or opportunity to develop a repelling protection–will have\r\nno such difficulty in effecting the fertilization of the native species\r\nas have those adjacent species against whose intrusions the latter is\r\nspecifically moulded and selected by long generations of severe natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nThe failure of hybrids generally to ripen their ova and sperm so as to\r\nreproduce themselves is a subject upon which, considering its enormous\r\nimportance and significance, singularly little has been done in the\r\nway of investigation. Fifty years ago it was usually taught that the\r\nmule, between the horse and the ass, so largely produced under human\r\nsuperintendence for transport service, was unable to breed owing to\r\nsome deformity in the reproductive passages. Even now no adequate study\r\nof the subject has been made, but it appears that whilst a female mule\r\ncan be, and sometimes is, successfully mated to a horse or an ass,\r\ngiving birth to a foal, the male mule does not produce fully-formed\r\nspermatozoa. What precisely is the nature of this failure, what the\r\nultimate microscopic condition of the sperm cells in infertile male\r\nmules, or in any other infertile male hybrids, has not yet been\r\nproperly worked out by modern cytological methods. It would be a matter\r\nof vast interest to determine what is the difference in the structure\r\nof the sperm-cells of a fertile and of an infertile male hybrid. At\r\npresent, so far as I know, this has not been done.\r\n\r\nSo far what I have written applies to hybridization–the inter-breeding\r\nof distinct species. A similar but by no means identical subject is\r\nthat of the inter-breeding of distinct races or varieties of one\r\nspecies, and the production of \"mongrels.\" \"Mongrels\" are to races what\r\n\"hybrids\" are to species. To this branch of the subject belongs the\r\nstudy of the effects of intermarriage between distinct races of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE CROSS-BREEDING OF RACES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that there is no simple rule as to the \"mating\" of\r\nindividuals of a species with individuals of another closely allied\r\nbut distinct species. Such mating very rarely comes about in natural\r\nconditions, but man by his interference sometimes succeeds in procuring\r\n\"hybrids\" between allied species. Hybrids between species belonging to\r\ngroups so different as to be distinguished by zoologists as distinct\r\n\"families\" or \"orders\" are quite unknown under any circumstances.\r\nSuch remoteness of natural character and structure as is indicated by\r\nthe two great divisions of hoofed mammals–the even-toed (including\r\nsheep, cattle, deer, antelopes, giraffes, pigs and camels), and the\r\nodd-toed (including tapirs, rhinoceroses, horses, asses and zebras)\r\nis an absolute bar to inter-breeding. So, too, the carnivora (cats,\r\ndogs, bears and seals, and smaller kinds) are so remote in their nature\r\nfrom the rabbits, hares and rats–called \"the rodents\"–that no mating\r\nbetween members of the one and the other of these groups has ever been\r\nobserved, either in nature or under artificial conditions.\r\n\r\nEven when individuals of closely allied species mate with one another\r\nit is a very rare occurrence that the hybrids so produced ripen their\r\nova and sperms so as to be capable of carrying on the hybrid race,\r\nthough sometimes they do ripen them and breed. The great naturalist\r\nAlfred Wallace, in his most valuable and readable book called\r\n\"Darwinism,\" expressed the opinion that the apparent failure of hybrid\r\nraces to perpetuate themselves by breeding was to a large extent due\r\nto the small number of individuals used in experiments on this matter,\r\nand the in-and-in breeding which was the consequence. One of the great\r\ngeneralizations established by Darwin is that in-and-in breeding is,\r\nas a rule, resisted in all animals and plants, and leads when it\r\noccurs to a dying-out of the inbred race by resulting feebleness and\r\ninfertility. A large part of Darwin's work consisted in demonstrating\r\nthe devices existing in the natural structure and qualities of plants\r\nand animals for securing cross-fertilization among individuals of the\r\nsame species but of different stock. Both extremes seem to be barred\r\nin nature–namely, the inter-breeding of stocks so diverse in structure\r\nand quality as to be what we call \"distinct species,\" and again the\r\ninter-breeding of individuals of the same immediate parentage or near\r\ncousinship. What seems to be favoured by the natural structure and\r\nqualities of the plant or the animal is that it shall only breed within\r\na certain group–the species–and shall within that group avoid constant\r\nself-fertilization or fertilization by near cousins. Thus we find\r\nnumerous cases in which, though the same flower has both pollen and\r\novules, and might fertilize itself, the visits of insects (specially\r\nmade use of by mechanisms in the flower) carry the pollen of one flower\r\nto the ovules of another and to flowers on separate plants growing\r\nat a distance. It is necessary to note that there are, nevertheless,\r\nself-fertilizing flowers, and also self-fertilizing lower animals,\r\nthe special conditions of which require and have received careful\r\nexamination and consideration, upon which I cannot now enter.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the question of the possibility of establishing hybrids\r\nbetween various species experimentally, I must (before going on to the\r\ncognate question of \"mongrels\") tell of an interesting suggestion made\r\nto me by my friend Professor Alphonse Milne-Edwards not long before he\r\ndied, and never published by him. He was director of the Jardin des\r\nPlantes in Paris, where there is a menagerie of living beasts as well\r\nas a botanic garden and great museum collections and laboratories.\r\nHe held it to be probable, as many physiologists would agree, that\r\nthe fertilization of the egg of one species by the sperm of another,\r\neven a remotely related one, is ultimately prevented by a chemical\r\nincompatibility–chemical in the sense that the highly complex molecular\r\nconstitution of such bodies as the anti-toxins and serums with which\r\nphysiologists are beginning to deal is \"chemical\"–and that all the\r\nother and secondary obstacles to fertilization can be overcome or\r\nevaded in the course of experiment. He proposed to inject one species\r\nby \"serums\" extracted from the other, in such a way as seemed most\r\nlikely to bring the chemical state of their reproductive elements into\r\nharmony, that is to say, into a condition in which they should not\r\nbe actively antagonistic but admit of fusion and union. He proposed,\r\nby the exchange of living or highly organized fluids (by means of\r\ninjection or transfusion) between a male and female of separate\r\nspecies, to assimilate the chemical constitution of one to that of the\r\nother, and thus possibly so to affect their reproductive elements that\r\nthe one could tolerate and fertilize the other. The suggestion is not\r\nunreasonable, but would require a long series of experiments in which\r\nthe possibility of producing such \"assimilation,\" even to a small\r\nextent and in respect of less complex processes than those ultimately\r\naimed at, would have to be, first of all, established. My friend did\r\nnot live to commence this investigation, but it is possible that some\r\nday we may see the obstacle to the union of ovum and sperm of species,\r\nwhich are to some extent allied, removed in this way by transfusion or\r\ninjection of important fluids from the one into the other.\r\n\r\nWe must not lose sight of the fact, in the midst of these various\r\nand diverging observations about the fertilization of the ova of one\r\nspecies by sperms of another species, that there is such a thing as\r\n\"parthenogenesis,\" or virgin-birth. In some of the insects and lower\r\nforms of animals the egg-cell habitually and regularly develops and\r\ngives rise to a new individual without being fertilized at all. And in\r\nother cases by special treatment, such as rubbing with a brush, or in\r\nthe case of marine animals by addition of certain salts to the water\r\nin which the eggs are floating–or, again, in the case of the eggs of\r\nthe common frog by gently scratching them with a needle–the eggs which\r\nusually and regularly require to be penetrated by and fused with a\r\nspermatozoon or sperm-filament before they will develop, proceed to\r\ndevelop into complete new individuals without the action upon them\r\nof any spermatozoon. In such marine animals as the sea-urchins or\r\nsea-eggs it has been found that the eggs deposited in pure sea-water,\r\nthough they would die and decompose if left there alone, can be made to\r\ndevelop and proceed on their growth by the addition to the sea-water of\r\nthe sperm filaments of a star-fish (the feather star or comatula). The\r\nspermatozoa or sperm-filaments do not, however, in this case fuse with\r\nthe egg-cells. They mechanically pierce the egg-coat, but contribute no\r\nsubstance to the embryo into which the egg develops. They have merely\r\nserved, like the scratch of a needle on the frog's egg and the brushing\r\nof insects' eggs, to start the egg on its growth, to \"stimulate\" it and\r\nset changes going. It appears thus that the fertilizing sperm-filaments\r\nof organisms generally have two separate and very important influences\r\nupon the egg-cells with which they fuse. The one is to stimulate\r\nthe egg and start the changes of embryonic growth; the other is\r\nto contribute some living material from the male parent to the new\r\nindividual arising from the growth and shaping of the egg-cell. The\r\nfirst influence can be exercised without the second, as is seen in\r\nthe case of the eggs of some sea-urchins stimulated to growth by the\r\nspermatozoa of some star-fishes. It happens that these marine animals\r\nare convenient for study and experiment because their eggs are small\r\nand transparent and that they and the spermatozoa are freely passed\r\ninto the sea-water at the breeding season, in which the fertilization\r\nof the eggs takes place.\r\n\r\nWhen these facts are considered we have to admit that in the mating\r\nof two species which will not regularly and naturally breed together,\r\nthere may be a limited action of the spermatic element which may\r\nstimulate the egg to development without contributing by fusion in\r\nthe regular way to the actual substance of the young so produced,\r\nor only contributing an amount insufficient to produce a full and\r\nnormal development of the hybrid young. Such cases not improbably\r\nsometimes occur in higher animals, though they have not been, as yet,\r\nshown to exist except in the experiments with sea-urchins' eggs and\r\nfeather-star's sperm.\r\n\r\nIn all animals and plants, but especially in domesticated and\r\ncultivated stocks or strains, varieties arise which, by natural or\r\nartificial separation, breed apart, and give rise to what are called\r\n\"races.\" Such races in natural conditions may become species. Species\r\nare races or groups of individuals, which, by long estrangement (not\r\nnecessarily local isolation) from the parent stock and by adaptation\r\nto special conditions of life, have become more or less \"stable\"–that\r\nis, permanent and unchanging in the conditions to which they have\r\nbecome adapted. They acquire by one device or another the habit of\r\nnot breeding with the stock from which they originally diverged–a\r\nrepugnance which may be overcome by human contrivance or by natural\r\naccident, but is, nevertheless, an effective and real quality.\r\nDistinct forms, which have not arrived at the stability and separation\r\ncharacteristic of species, are spoken of as \"races,\" or \"varieties.\"\r\nIt is very generally the case that the \"races\" of one species can\r\ninter-breed freely with one another, and with the original stock, when\r\nit still exists. Comparatively little is known as to the behaviour\r\nof wild or naturally-produced \"races.\" Practically all our views on\r\nthe subject of \"races\" and their inter-breeding are derived from our\r\nobservation of the immense number and range of \"races\" and \"breeds\"\r\nproduced by man–as farmer, fancier, and horticulturist. It has been\r\ngenerally received as a rule, that the various races produced in the\r\nfarm or garden by breeding from a species, will inter-breed freely, and\r\nproduce offspring which are fertile. A special and important series of\r\nraces, in which human purpose and voluntary selection necessarily have\r\na leading part, are the races of man.\r\n\r\nThe offspring of parents of two different races is called a mongrel,\r\nwhilst the term \"hybrid\" has been of late limited, for the sake of\r\nconvenience, to the offspring of parents of two different species.\r\nMongrels, it has been generally held, are fertile–often more fertile\r\nthan pure-bred individuals whose parents are both of the same race,\r\nwhilst \"hybrids\" are contrasted with them, in being infertile. We have\r\nseen that infertility is not an absolute rule in the case of hybrids,\r\nand it appears that there is also a source of error in the observations\r\nwhich lead to the notion that \"mongrels\" are always fertile. The fact\r\nis that observations on this matter have nearly always been made with\r\ndomesticated animals and plants which are, of course, selected and\r\nbred by man on account of their fertility, and thus are exceptionally\r\ncharacterized by fertility, which is transmitted in an exceptional\r\ndegree to the races or varieties which are experimentally inter-bred,\r\nand, consequently, may be expected to produce fertile mongrels. Alfred\r\nRussel Wallace insisted upon this fact, and pointed out that in a few\r\ncases colour varieties of a given species of plant have been found to\r\nbe incapable of inter-breeding, or only produce very few \"mongrels.\"\r\nThis has been established in the case of two dissimilarly-coloured\r\nvarieties of mullein. Also the red and the blue pimpernel (the poor\r\nman's weather-glass, Anagallis), which are classed by botanists as two\r\nvarieties of one species, have been found after repeated trials to\r\nbe definitely incapable of inter-breeding. Wallace insists in regard\r\nto crossing, that some degree of difference favours fertility, but a\r\nlittle more tends to infertility. We must remember that the fertility\r\nof both plants and animals is very easily upset. Changed conditions of\r\nlife–such as domestication–may lead (we do not know why) to complete\r\nor nearly complete infertility; and, again, \"change of air,\" or of\r\nlocality, has an extraordinary and not-as-yet-explained effect on\r\nfertility.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, the little more and how much it is!\r\n    And the little less, and what worlds away!\"\r\n\r\nInfertile horses sent from their native home to a different climate\r\n(as, for instance, from Scotland to Newmarket) become fertile. A\r\njudicious crossing of varieties or races threatened with infertility\r\nwill often lead to increased vigour and fertility in the new\r\ngeneration, just as change of locality will produce such a result.\r\nPhysiological processes which are not obvious and cannot be exactly\r\nestimated or measured are then, we must conclude, largely connected\r\nwith the question of sterility and fertility. Mr. Darwin has collected\r\nfacts which go far to prove that colour (as in the case of the black\r\npigs of Virginia, which I cited in Chapter X.), instead of being\r\na trifling and unimportant character, as was supposed by the older\r\nnaturalists, is really one of great significance, often correlated\r\nwith important constitutional differences. It is pointed out by Alfred\r\nWallace that in all the recorded cases in which a decided infertility\r\noccurs between varieties (or races) of the same species of plants (such\r\nas those just cited), those varieties are distinguished by a difference\r\nof colour. He gives reasons for thinking that the correlation of colour\r\nwith infertility which has been detected in several cases in plants may\r\nalso extend to animals in a state of nature. The constant preference\r\nof animals–even mere varieties of dog, sheep, horses, and pigeons–for\r\ntheir like, has been well established by observation. Colour is one of\r\nthe readiest appeals to the eye in guiding animals in such selection\r\nand association, and is connected with deep-seated constitutional\r\nqualities. \"Birds of a feather flock together\" is a popular statement\r\nconfirmed by the careful observation of naturalists. Thus we arrive at\r\nsome indication of features which may determine the inter-breeding, or\r\nthe abstention from inter-breeding, of diverse races sprung from one\r\noriginal stock. The \"colour bar\" is not merely the invention of human\r\nprejudice, but already exists in wild plants and animals.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the questions, the assertions, the beliefs, and the acts\r\nconcerning the inter-breeding of human races, to the consideration of\r\nwhich I have been preparing the way. The dog-fancier has generally a\r\ngreat contempt for \"mongrels.\" Breeders generally dislike accidental\r\ncrosses, because they interfere with the purpose which the breeder\r\nhas in view of producing animals or plants of a quality, form, and\r\ncharacter which he has determined on before-hand. This interference\r\nwith his purpose seems to be the explanation of beliefs and statements,\r\nto the prejudice of \"mongrels.\" Really, as is well known to great\r\nbreeders and horticulturists, a determined and selective crossing of\r\nbreeds is the very foundation of the breeder's art, and there is no\r\nreason to suppose that a \"mongrel\" is necessarily, or even probably,\r\ninferior in vigour or in qualities which are advantageous in the\r\nstruggle for life in \"natural\"–that is to say, \"larger\"–conditions\r\nof an animal's or plant's life; not those limited conditions for\r\nwhich the breeder intends his products. Indeed, the very opposite\r\nis the case. In nature, as Mr. Darwin showed, there are innumerable\r\ncontrivances to ensure the cross-breeding of allied but distinct\r\nstrains. Dog-owners who are not exclusively bent upon possessing a\r\ndog which shows in a perfect way the \"points\" of a breed favoured by\r\nthe fashion of the moment, or fitting it for some special employment,\r\nknow very well that a \"mongrel\" may often exhibit finer qualities\r\nof intelligence, or endurance, than those exhibited by a dog of\r\npure-bred \"race.\" And the very \"races\" which are spoken of to-day as\r\n\"pure-bred,\" or \"thoroughbred,\" have (as is well known) been produced\r\nas \"mongrels\"–that is to say, by crossing or mating individuals of\r\npreviously-existing distinct and pure breeds. The history of many such\r\n\"mongrel breeds,\" now spoken of as \"thoroughbred,\" is well known.\r\nThe English racehorse was gradually produced by the \"mongrelizing,\"\r\nor cross-breeding, of several breeds or races–the English warhorse,\r\nthe Arab, the Barb. A very fine mongrel stock having at last been\r\nobtained, it was found, or, at any rate, was considered to be\r\ndemonstrated, that no further improvement (for the purposes aimed\r\nat, namely, flat-racing) could be effected by introducing the blood\r\nof other stock. The offspring of the \"mongrels\" Herod, Matchem, and\r\nEclipse accordingly became established as \"the\" English racehorse, and\r\nthenceforward was mated only within its own race or stock, and was kept\r\npure or \"thoroughbred.\" Another well-known mongrel breed which is now\r\nkept pure, or nearly so, is that of the St. Bernard's dog, a blend of\r\nNewfoundland, Bloodhound, and English Mastiff.\r\n\r\nOften the word \"mongrel\" is limited in its use to signify an\r\nundesired or undesirable result of the cross-breeding of individuals\r\nof established races. But this is not quite fair to mongrels in\r\ngeneral, since, as we have seen, the name really refers only to the\r\nfact they are crosses between two breeds. When they happen to suit\r\nsome artificial and arbitrary requirement they are favoured, and made\r\nthe starting-point of a new breed, and kept pure in their own line;\r\nbut when they do not fit some capricious demand of the breeder they\r\nare sneered at and condemned, although they may be fine and capable\r\nanimals. No doubt some mongrels between races differing greatly from\r\none another, or having some peculiar mixture of incompatible qualities\r\nthe exact nature of which we have not ascertained, are wanting in\r\nvigour, and cannot be readily established as a new breed. In nature\r\nthe success of the mongrel depends on whether or not its mixture of\r\nqualities makes it fitter than others to the actual conditions of its\r\nlife, and able to survive in the competition for food and place. In\r\nman's breeding operations with varieties of domesticated animals and\r\n\"cultivated\" plants, the survival of the mongrel depends upon its\r\nfitting some arbitrary standard applied by man, who destroys those\r\nwhich do not suit his fancy, and selects for survival and continued\r\nbreeding those which do.\r\n\r\nWhat is called \"miscegenation,\" or the inter-breeding of human races,\r\nmust be looked at from both these points of view. We require to know\r\nhow far, if at all, the mixed or mongrel offspring of a human race A\r\nwith a human race B is really inferior to either of the original stocks\r\nA and B, judged by general capacity and life-preserving qualities in\r\nthe varied conditions of the great area of the habitable globe. And\r\nhow far an arbitrary or fanciful standard is set up by human races,\r\nsimilar to that set up by the \"fancier\" or cultivator of breeds of\r\ndomestic animals. The matter is complicated by the fact that what we\r\nloosely speak of as \"races\" of man are of very various degrees of\r\nconsanguinity or nearness to one another in blood, that is, in stock or\r\nin ultimate ancestry. It is also complicated by the fact that we cannot\r\nplace any reliance upon the antipathies or preferences shown by the\r\ngeneral sentiment of a race in this (or other matters) as necessarily\r\nindicating what is beneficial for humanity in general or for the\r\nimmediate future of any section of it. Nor have we any assurance that\r\nwhat is called \"sexual selection\"–the preference or taste in the matter\r\nof choosing a mate–is among human beings necessarily anything of\r\ngreater importance–so far as the prosperity of a race or of humanity in\r\ngeneral is concerned–than a mere caprice or a meaningless persistence\r\nof the human mind in favouring a choice which is habitual and\r\ntraditional. I have referred to this point again in the last paragraph\r\nof this chapter.\r\n\r\nIn regard to marriage between individuals of different European\r\nnationalities, a certain amount of unwillingness exists on the part of\r\nboth men and women which cannot be ascribed to any deep-seated inborn\r\nantipathy, but is due to a mistrust of the unknown \"foreigner,\" which\r\nvery readily disappears on acquaintance, or may arise from dislike\r\nof the laws and customs of a foreign people. English, French, Dutch,\r\nScandinavians, Germans, Russians, Greeks, Italians and Spaniards have\r\nno deep-rooted prejudices on the subject, and readily intermarry when\r\ncircumstances bring them into association. Though the Jews by their\r\npresent traditional practice are opposed to marriage with those not\r\nof their faith, there is no effective aversion of a racial kind to\r\nsuch unions, and in early times they have been very frequent. During\r\nthe \"captivity\" in Babylon and again after the \"dispersal\" by the\r\nRomans, the original Jewish race was practically swamped by mixture\r\nwith cognate Oriental races who adopted the Jewish faith. So far from\r\nthere being inborn prejudice against intermarriage of the peoples above\r\ncited, it is very generally admitted that such \"miscegenation\" leads\r\nfrequently to the foundation of families of fine quality. The blend is\r\nsuccessful, as may be seen in the number of prominent Englishmen who\r\nhave Huguenot, German, Dutch, or Jewish blood in their veins.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to the intermarriage of members of the white race of\r\nEurope with members of either the negroid (black) race or of the yellow\r\nand red mongoloid race, a much greater and more deeply-rooted aversion\r\nis found, and this is extended even to members of the Caucasian race\r\nwho, possibly by prehistoric mixture with negro-like races, are very\r\ndark-skinned, as is the case with the Aryan population in India and\r\nPolynesia. It is a very difficult matter; in fact, it seems to me not\r\npossible in our present knowledge of the facts, to decide whether\r\nthere is a natural inborn or congenital disinclination to the marriage\r\nof the white race, especially of the Anglo-Saxon branch of it, with\r\n\"coloured\" people, or whether the whole attitude (as I am inclined to\r\nthink) is one of \"pride of race,\" an attitude which can be defended\r\non the highest grounds, though it may lead to erroneous beliefs as to\r\nthe immediate evil results of such unions, and to an unreasonable and\r\ncruel treatment both of the individuals so intermarrying and of their\r\noffspring. There is little or no evidence of objection to mixed unions\r\non the part of the coloured people with whites, no evidence of physical\r\ndislike to the white man or white woman, but, on the contrary, ready\r\nacquiescence.\r\n\r\nA curious aversion to marriages with whites on the part both of North\r\nAmerican Indians and of negroes is, however, recorded from time to\r\ntime in the official reports of the United States Government.\r\n\r\nTwo beliefs about such unions are more or less prevalent among white\r\nmen in the regions where they not infrequently occur. Neither of these\r\nbeliefs is supported by anything like conclusive evidence. The one\r\nis that such unions lead to the production of relatively infertile\r\noffspring; the mixed breed or stock is said to die out after a few\r\n(some seven or eight) generations. It is, however, the fact that the\r\ncircumstances under which this occurs suggest that it is not due to\r\na natural and necessary infertility. The other assertion is that the\r\noffspring of parents–one of white race and the other of black, yellow\r\nor brown–tend by some strange fatality to inherit the bad qualities of\r\nboth races and the good qualities of neither. This is a case to which\r\nmust be applied the saying, \"Give a dog a bad name and hang him.\"\r\nThe white man in North America, in India, and in New Zealand desires\r\nthe increase and prosperity of his own race. Like the fancier set on\r\nthe production of certain breeds of domesticated animals, he has no\r\ntoleration for a \"mongrel.\" In so far as it is true that miscegenation\r\n(marriage of white and coloured race) produces a stock which rapidly\r\ndies out–this is due to the adverse conditions, the opposition and\r\nhostility to which the mixed race is exposed by the attitude of the\r\ndominant white race. To the same cause is due the development of\r\nignoble and possibly dangerous characteristics in the unfortunate\r\noffspring of these marriages more frequently than in those who find\r\ntheir natural place and healthy up-bringing either in the white or\r\nthe coloured sections of the community. The \"half-breed\" is in some\r\ncountries inexorably rejected by the race of his or her white parent\r\nand forced to take up an equivocal association with the coloured race.\r\n\r\nThat some, at any rate, of the evils attributed to \"miscegenation\" are\r\ndue to the baneful influence of \"pride of race\" is evident from the\r\nfact that the Portuguese (with the exception of a small aristocratic\r\nclass) have not since the early days of the fourteenth century,\r\nperhaps in consequence of established association with the Moorish\r\nand other North African races, shown that pride of race and aversion\r\nto mixture with dark-skinned races which is so strong a feature in\r\nthe Anglo-Saxons, their successors and rivals as colonists. The\r\nlong-standing admixture of black blood in the Portuguese population\r\nbefore the colonization of South America, has led to a toleration on\r\nthe part of the Portuguese colonists of \"miscegenation,\" both with\r\nIndians and the liberated descendants of imported negro slaves. The\r\nconsequence is that in Brazil there is no condemnation of black blood;\r\nchildren of mixed parentage and of coloured race attend the same\r\nschools as those of European blood, and freely associate with them.\r\nThere is no notion that that portion of the population which is of\r\nmixed negro, Indian, and white blood is less vigorous or fertile than\r\nthe unmixed, nor that vice and feebleness are the characteristics of\r\nthe former, whilst virtue and capacity belong to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe determined hostility of the Anglo-Saxon race in North America and\r\nin British India to \"miscegenation\" is in the case of the United States\r\nto be explained by the peculiar relation of a large slave population\r\nin the Southern States to a pure white slave-owning race: whilst in\r\nIndia we have a handful of white men temporarily stationed as rulers\r\nof millions of \"natives,\" but never accepting India as their home. The\r\nattitude of the Anglo-Saxon race to the North American Indians, and\r\nalso to the Maoris of New Zealand, has never been so extreme in the\r\nmatter of miscegenation as it has been to negroid people and to the\r\nvery different though dark-skinned people of the East. In support of\r\nthat opinion may be cited the fact that some of \"the first families of\r\nVirginia\" are proud of their descent from Pocahontes, the Algonkian\r\n\"Princess\" who married the Englishman Rolfe. In New Zealand there are\r\nmany families of mixed Anglo-Saxon and Maori blood. Though they are not\r\nostracized, as are the half-breeds of negro blood in the United States,\r\nthere is a firm tendency to relegate the half-breeds in New Zealand\r\nto the Maori section of the population, which it must be remembered\r\nincludes some of the richest and most prosperous landowners in the\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nIt may be questioned whether there is in this matter a greater \"pride\r\nof race\" among Anglo-Saxons than among other Northern European peoples.\r\nNeither the French nor the Germans have established great colonies\r\nlike the English, nor undertaken the administration of a huge Eastern\r\nEmpire, and have, therefore, not shown what attitude they would adopt\r\nunder such circumstances. The tolerance and easy-going humanitarianism\r\nof the French in relation to \"miscegenation\" in their dependencies in\r\npast times has never had the significance or practical importance which\r\nit would have possessed in the English Colonies and in the great Indian\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nThere is, on account of the sporadic and exceptional occurrence of\r\nmodern instances, no information of any value as to the results of\r\nmixture of other races of man. In early times and among more primitive\r\nor less civilized peoples there appears to have been, when immigration\r\nor conquest gave the opportunity, no obstacle to a free intermixture of\r\nan incoming race with the natives of an invaded territory. The \"pride\r\nof race\" has, nevertheless, throughout historic time been a frequent\r\nfactor in the adjustment of populations of diverse races, and though\r\n\"colour\" has been a frequent \"test\" or symbol of the superior and\r\nexclusive race, it has not been the only characteristic exalted to such\r\nimportance. Such \"pride of race\" has frequently excluded the members of\r\na closely allied but conquered racial group from intermarriage with the\r\nconquerors, and has only disappeared after centuries of persistence.\r\nThe term \"blue blood\" is interesting in this connection. It is the\r\n\"saing d'azure\" of the Gothic invaders, the conquerors of the Iberian\r\nand Moorish people of Spain. It refers not to any \"blueness\" of the\r\nblood itself, such as distinguishes veinous from arterial blood, but\r\nto the blue colour of the veins as seen through the colourless skin of\r\na northern race (the Goths), as compared with the invisibility of the\r\nveins when the skin is rendered more or less opaque by a brown pigment,\r\nas in the Moors and the swarthy Iberians.\r\n\r\nAmong the people of Western Europe marriage has assumed more and more\r\na character which is almost unknown in the rest of the world. Whatever\r\nthe future may be in regard to this matter, there is no doubt possible\r\nthat the place given to women in Western Europe by the ideals of\r\nchivalry and the practice of the northern race (which has so largely\r\ndisplaced the traditions of the Roman Empire) has established a\r\nrelation of the sexes in which marriage and consequent parentage have\r\nceased to be regarded as a mere regularization of animal desire and\r\nappetite. The accepted, but not always consciously recognized, view\r\nof marriage in Western Europe is that the union so sanctioned and the\r\nfamilies thereby produced should be the result not of the mere physical\r\nnecessity of irresponsible victims of an impulse common to all animals,\r\nbut the outcome of the deliberate choice of man and woman attracted to\r\none another by sympathy, understanding and reciprocal admiration, based\r\nupon knowledge of character, mental gifts and aspirations, as well as\r\nupon bodily charm. A rarely-expressed but none the less deeply-seated\r\nconviction exists that from such unions children of the finest nature,\r\nnurtured in circumstances most likely to make them worthy members of\r\nthe community, will be born and reared. It is this conviction which\r\nleads to, or at any rate endorses, the exclusiveness which is described\r\nas \"pride of race.\" The Anglo-Saxon man and equally the Anglo-Saxon\r\nwoman (as well as the allied races of neighbouring nationalities)\r\nrecognize a responsibility, a race duty, resulting from accumulated\r\ntradition, the heirloom of long ages of family life, which causes the\r\nman to be ashamed of, and the woman to shrink with instinctive horror\r\nfrom, union with an individual of a remote race with whom there can be\r\nno real sympathy, no intimate understanding. That seems to me to be the\r\nexplanation and the justification of the \"colour bar.\"\r\n\r\nIn relation to the probable effectiveness of sexual selection among\r\nuncivilized peoples in favouring and maintaining a particular type or\r\nform of features, hair, etc., characteristic of the race, independently\r\nof the life-preserving value of such qualities, I may mention, before\r\nquitting this difficult but strangely fascinating subject, a fact\r\nobserved by a traveller in Africa, and related to me by him. Other\r\nsimilar facts are on record. Among the negroes employed as \"porters\"\r\nby my friend, some thirty in number, was one who had a narrow aquiline\r\nnose and thin lips. He was as black and as woolly-haired as any of\r\nthem, but would if of fair complexion have been regarded by Europeans\r\nas a very handsome, fine-featured man. Such cases are not uncommon\r\nin parts of Africa, where probably an unrecognized mixture with Arab\r\nor Hamite blood has occurred. My friend expected this man to be a\r\nfavourite, on account of what to him appeared to be \"good looks,\" with\r\nthe girls of the villages at which he camped during a three months'\r\njourney. At every such village, as they journeyed on, the travellers\r\nwere received with joy and good nature. The negro porters were fêted\r\nand made much of by the young women. But one alone was unpopular and\r\nregarded with ridicule and dislike. This was the handsome negro with\r\nthe fine, well-modelled nose and beautiful European lips. The black\r\nbeauties turned their backs on him, in spite of his amiable character\r\nand kindly overtures. They invariably and by open confession preferred\r\nthe men with the thickest lips, the broadest noses, and the most\r\nthoroughly (as we should say) degraded prognathous appearance and\r\ndisgusting expression. Hence no doubt the young negresses were likely\r\nto perpetuate in their offspring the features which are characteristic\r\nof their race, and hence it is probable that mere capricious sexual\r\nselection of individuals most completely conforming to a preferred\r\ntype–irrespective of the value of the features preferred–may have great\r\neffect in both the selection and the maintenance of the peculiarities\r\nof the type. Dark skin may thus have been selected, until it became\r\nactually black; a slight curling of the hair, until it became woolly;\r\nthickish lips and broadish nose, until they became excessive in\r\nthickness and breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nWHEEL ANIMALCULES\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years ago the Dutch naturalist Leuwenhoek, who made\r\nmany discoveries with the highly magnifying lenses which he himself\r\nground and mounted, wrote to the Royal Society of London that he had\r\n\"discovered several animalcula that protrude two wheels out of the\r\nforepart of their body as they swim, or go on the sides of the glass\r\njar in which they are living.\" He says that \"the two wheels are thick\r\nset with teeth as the wheel of a watch,\" and he sent to the society\r\nfor publication drawings of these wonderful little creatures. This\r\nwas the first account of the Wheel Animalcules. Since then they have\r\nbeen studied by many microscopists, especially by Ehrenberg, who\r\nfigured many in his great book on animalcules in 1838. Fourteen years\r\nlater the delightful English naturalist, P. H. Gosse, who studied\r\nand illustrated the \"sea-anemones\" so ably–and, by his example and\r\ncharming descriptions, made the keeping of these beautiful things in\r\nmarine aquaria a favourite occupation among people of leisure, blessed\r\nwith a \"curiosity concerning the things of nature\"–published some\r\nmicroscopical studies on Wheel Animalcules, and continued throughout\r\nhis life to make them a special subject of his investigation.\r\n\r\nThe microscope was greatly improved–in fact, reached its present\r\nstate of perfection–during Mr. Gosse's lifetime, and a wonderful\r\namount was added to our knowledge not only as to the various kinds\r\nof wheel animalcules (which now number not less than 900 species),\r\nbut also with regard to the minutest details of their structure,\r\ntheir growth from the egg, and their habits. Another English lover\r\nof these minute creatures, Dr. C. T. Hudson, of Clifton (Bristol),\r\nbegan his observations a few years later, and also discovered many\r\nwonderful kinds. It was my good fortune to bring these two devotees of\r\nthe Rotifera, or Wheel Animalcules, together, and to induce them to\r\nwrite a conjoint work on their favourites–after, as they say in their\r\npreface, they had each continued their studies almost daily for thirty\r\nyears, and had made innumerable drawings from living specimens, which\r\nare reproduced in the many hundred (mostly coloured) figures engraved\r\nin the thirty-four quarto plates of their monumental book. This was\r\npublished in 1889, a year after Mr. Gosse's death at the age of 78. My\r\nfriend, Mr. Edmund Gosse, the distinguished man of letters, is the son\r\nof the naturalist; the microscope, the aquarium, and the rock-pools of\r\nthe seashore were the familiar delights of his boyhood, as of mine.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 34 I have sketched the common Rotifer or wheel animalcule. It\r\nis about the one-fortieth of an inch long. The two specimens drawn\r\nin Figs. 34, A and B, are seen to be clinging by the forked tail-end\r\nof the body to a piece of weed (drawn in dotted lines). The body is\r\nstretched in these specimens to its full length. It can be shortened by\r\na \"telescoping\" or pulling in of either end, so as to make the animal\r\na mere oval particle. The four narrower joints or segments at the\r\ntail-end can be pulled in like the segments of a telescope, whilst the\r\ntwo wheels and adjacent parts can be drawn down into the body as shown\r\nin Fig. 34, C, where the two wheels (W) are seen showing through the\r\nskin by transparency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.–Diagram of _Rotifer vulgaris_–the common\r\nwheel animalcule–one hundred and twenty times as long as the creature\r\nitself. _A_, front view. _B_, side view. _C_, head showing eyes _S_,\r\nand retracted wheel apparatus _W_. The letters in _A_ and _B_ have the\r\nfollowing signification: _M_, mouth. _W_, wheel or ciliated disc. _S_,\r\neye spots on head. _T_, spur or tentacle. _G_, gizzard. _St_, stomach.\r\n_Int_, intestines. _V_, vent: aperture of intestine.]\r\n\r\nThe common rotifer can walk like a looping caterpillar or a\r\nleech–fixing itself by its tail, then stretching out the head and\r\nfixing that, whilst letting go the tail and bringing it up by\r\n\"telescoping\" it, near to the head region. The tail is forked, and in\r\nthe side view (Fig. 34, B) it is seen to have a soft branched process,\r\nwhich helps it to cling. The letter V in Fig. 34, A, points to the vent\r\nor opening of the gut at the fork of the tail. The mouth, marked M, is\r\nseen between the two \"wheels.\" The two \"wheels\" are really two discs,\r\nthe edges of which are beset by coarse \"cilia,\" or vibrating hairs of\r\nprotoplasm.[5] These cilia \"lash\" and straighten again one after the\r\nother, so that the optical illusion is produced of the toothed edge of\r\nthe disc being in movement like a wheel. They may be \"focused\" with the\r\nmicroscope so that the groups or \"bunches\" of them look like stiff,\r\nmotionless \"teeth,\" although they are really, all the time, lashing and\r\nbeating in regular rhythm. When the animal is fixed by its tail, the\r\nlashing of the cilia on the wheels causes currents in the water which\r\nset with great strength to the mouth and bring floating food particles\r\nto it. It is thus that the Rotifer feeds. When the tail is not\r\ngrasping a support, the movement of the cilia on the wheels causes the\r\nanimal to swim forward through the water, so that it has two modes of\r\nlocomotion–the leech-like crawling method and the free swimming method.\r\n\r\nThe various internal organs of a Rotifer are readily seen through its\r\ntransparent skin (Fig. 34, A). It has a nervous system, many bands of\r\ncontractile muscles and a pair of little tubular kidneys or nephridia,\r\nbesides reproductive germs (the eggs). I have here sketched only the\r\ndigestive canal. The mouth leads through a gullet to a very curious\r\norgan called the \"gizzard,\" marked G. All the wheel animalcules have\r\nthis gizzard, but its teeth, shown as two oval bodies in the drawing,\r\ndiffer a great deal in shape and complexity in the different kinds.\r\nWhilst the Rotifer is feeding by bringing currents of water to its\r\nmouth, the two halves of the gizzard are kept in rapid movement by\r\nmuscles, causing them to rub against one another and to grind up the\r\nfood particles which reach them through the gullet. The gizzard (G)\r\nis followed by the digestive stomach (St), and that by the intestine\r\n(Int), which opens at the vent (V). The side (or three-quarter profile)\r\nview of a similar specimen (Fig. 34, B) shows only the surface of\r\nthe little animal, and is intended to show especially the snout-like\r\nhead-lobe (S), with its two eye-spots, which are red in colour.\r\nStanding out backwards from this is a finger-like process (T), which is\r\ncalled the spur, or tentacle. It has hairs at its tip, and is a sensory\r\norgan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.–The Rotifer _Pedalion mirum_–seen from the\r\nright side, magnified 180 diameters. _w.a._, wheel apparatus or\r\n\"ciliated\" margin of the cephalic disc. _r.e._, right side eye-spot.\r\n_m._, mouth. _p._, tactile process. _d.l._, median dorsal limb (as it\r\nis seen in profile, only three of the fringed hairs at its extremity\r\nare seen). _v.l._, the great ventral limb (only five of its fan of\r\neight fringed hairs are seen). _l.l._^1, dorso-lateral, and _l.l._^2,\r\nventro-lateral limbs of the right side: they show the complete fans of\r\neight fringed hairs. _x._, the pair of posterior processes tipped with\r\nvibratile cilia, better seen in Fig. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.–The Rotifer _Pedalion mirum_–seen from the\r\nventral surface. Letters as in Fig. 35. The complete fan of eight\r\nfringed hairs terminating the great ventral limb are seen, and the\r\nthree spine-like processes on each side of it. The fringed hairs of the\r\ntwo ventro-lateral limbs, _l.l._^2, are omitted; they are fully shown\r\nin Fig. 35, and are the same in number and disposition as those forming\r\nthe \"fan\" of the great ventral limb. Compare these hairs with those of\r\nthe \"Nauplius\" Crustacean larva drawn as a tail-piece to Chapter XIII.]\r\n\r\nIn some wheel animalcules there is a pair of these spurs, and the very\r\nremarkable wheel animalcule drawn in Figs. 35 and 36 has six large\r\nprocesses which, though much bigger, appear to be of the same nature.\r\nOf these four are seen in Fig. 35, namely, _d.l._, the dorsal limb,\r\n_v.l._, the great ventral limb, and _l.l._^1 and _l.l._^2, the two\r\nlateral limbs of the right side, all of them carrying fanlike groups\r\nof fringed hairs. They are moved by very powerful muscles, and strike\r\nthe water with energetic strokes, so as to cause the little owner to\r\ndart through it. This jumping or darting wheel animalcule is called\r\n\"Pedalion,\" and was discovered and described by Dr. Hudson. It is so\r\nastonishing and wonderful a little beast, that when Dr. Hudson sent me\r\nsome alive in a tube by post in 1872, soon after he had discovered\r\nit, I could not believe my eyes, and thought I must be dreaming. It\r\nis very like the young form of Crustaceans known as a \"Nauplius\" (see\r\ntail-piece to the present chapter) in having (what no other wheel\r\nanimalcule has) great hollow paired limbs moved by _striated_ muscular\r\nfibre, carrying fringed hairs only known before in Crustaceans (crabs,\r\nshrimps and water fleas), and striking the water violently just as do\r\nthose of the Nauplius. And yet all the while it has on its head a pair\r\nof large ciliated wheels which serve it just as do those of the common\r\nRotifer. No Crustacean, young or old, has this \"wheel-apparatus\" nor\r\nany vibratile \"cilia\" on the surface of its body. Pedalion possesses an\r\nastounding \"blend\" of characters. Fig. 35 shows, besides the \"paddles\"\r\nor \"legs\" (of which two on the other side of the animal are not seen),\r\nthe broad and large wheel-apparatus W (within which the right eye-spot\r\n_r.e._ is seen), and a little lobe (_p_) called the \"chin\" lying just\r\nbelow the mouth (_m_). The big leg (_v.l._) and the pair on each side\r\n(_l.l._^1 and _l.l._^2), of which that on the right side only is seen,\r\nend in beautiful fringed hairs, which are only seen elsewhere in the\r\nCrustacea (water-fleas and others). Those on the lateral limbs and the\r\ngreat ventral limb (Fig. 36) are set in two groups of four on each side\r\nof the free end of the limb, whilst those on the dorsal leg (_d.l._)\r\nare apparently not so numerous. I have corrected the drawings, Figs.\r\n35 and 36, by reference to actual specimens kindly given to me by Mr.\r\nRousselet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.–The Rotifer _Noteus quadricornis_–to show its\r\ncurious four-horned carapace–from which the wheel apparatus, _wa_,\r\nemerges in front, and the tail, _t_, behind; somewhat as the head and\r\ntail of a tortoise emerge from its protective \"box\" or carapace. The\r\nridges on the horney covering of the Rotifer recall the horney plates\r\nof the tortoises and turtles.]\r\n\r\nThe 500 different species of Wheel Animalcules or Rotifera differ from\r\none another in the exact shape of the wheel-apparatus, in the jointing\r\nof the body and its general shape, and in the development, in some,\r\nof a hard skin or shell like a turtle's or tortoise's shell (Fig. 37)\r\nover that broadest region of the body in which in our Fig. 34, A,\r\nthe stomach marked \"St\" is placed. They differ also in the shape of\r\nthe gizzard's teeth, in the presence of paddles or legs (in Pedalion\r\nalone), and in the presence in some of longer or shorter projecting\r\nmovable rods or bristles in pairs or in bunches. Many build for\r\nthemselves tubular habitations of jelly or of hard cemented particles.\r\nThey are all minute (from the ¹/₁₂ to the ¹/₅₀₀ in. in length). They\r\nare divided into five principal groups, which are (1) the crawlers,\r\nlike the common Rotifer (Fig. 34), which can crawl like a leech and\r\nalso swim freely by aid of their wheel-apparatus; (2) the naked free\r\nswimmers, which do not crawl, but move only by swimming; (3) the\r\nturtle-shelled free swimmers (Fig. 37) like the last, but provided with\r\nstrong, often faceted, angular, and spike-bearing shells or \"bucklers,\"\r\nfrom which head and wheel-apparatus project in front and narrow tail\r\nbehind; (4) the rooted or fixed forms (Figs. 37 _bis_); these never\r\nswim when full grown, but each forms and inhabits a protective tube or\r\ncase; (5) the skipping or darting forms. Of these there is only the\r\nPedalion mirum (Figs. 35 and 36), which is quite unlike all the other\r\nwheel animalcules in having limbs like those of the minute water-fleas\r\n(Nauplius, Cyclops) which strike the water and are fringed with\r\nfeather-like hairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The larval or young form of Crustacea known as \"the\r\nNauplius.\" This is the \"Nauplius\" of a kind of Prawn. The three pairs\r\nof branched limbs are well seen. Much magnified.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[5] For some account of \"cilia,\" see \"Science from an Easy Chair,\"\r\nFigs. 29, 33, 40 and the accompanying text.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT WHEEL ANIMALCULES\r\n\r\n\r\nMicroscopic as the wheel animalcules are they yet have been watched\r\nand examined by their admirers to as great a point of intimacy as that\r\nreached by the devotees of insects or of birds. A remarkable fact\r\nabout them is that in about 130 different species (out of the 500\r\nknown) it has been found that the males are diminutive creatures, about\r\none-tenth the size of the females, and devoid of digestive canal; in\r\nfact, little more than minute swimming sacs full of spermatozoa. In\r\none group, that of the crawling Rotifers, to which the common wheel\r\nanimalcule, figured in the last chapter, belongs, no male at all has\r\never been discovered. They are all females. They are precisely those\r\nwheel animalcules which are known to microscopists for their power of\r\nsurviving (like the little water-bears or tardigrades and some other\r\nminute animalcules) the desiccation, or \"drying-up\" of the water in\r\nwhich they were living, swimming, and crawling (see Chapters XV. and\r\nXVI.). And it is quite probable that this power of resistance to the\r\nadverse conditions of changing seasons has, in the crawling Rotifers,\r\ntaken the place of the production of eggs fertilized by a male. For,\r\nas in the case of the crustacean water-fleas (and of the terrestrial\r\nplant-lice, or aphides and gall-flies), it is found that the female\r\nRotifers or wheel animalcules, which hatch from fertilized eggs, are\r\nthemselves \"parthenogenetic,\" and lay eggs which develop without\r\nfertilization by males–that is to say, are \"impaternate.\" In the case\r\nof the water-fleas these are called \"summer eggs,\" and after one or\r\nmore generations of such fatherless females a proportion of males are\r\nproduced which fertilize the females hatched at the same period. The\r\neggs so fertilized acquire a thick shell and are called \"winter eggs.\"\r\nThey remain dormant for some months and resist the injurious influences\r\nof winter cold, or, it may be, of drying up and conversion of the\r\npond-mud into dust, but hatch out when warmer and wetter conditions\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is just what the adult crawling kind of Rotifer can do\r\nin the full-grown state by drawing up her body into the shape of a ball\r\nand exuding a jelly-like or horny coat. So that she has no need of\r\n\"winter eggs,\" and the whole process of forming them and of males to\r\nimpregnate them has \"dropped out\" of the life-history of this special\r\nkind of resistant Rotifers. The minute insignificant males and the\r\neventual disappearance of males altogether in some races is a subject\r\nwhich may well occupy the attention of our human \"suffragettes.\" That\r\nthe males are minute creatures, less than the thousandth part of\r\nthe size of the females, is a fact also ascertained in the case of\r\nsome curious marine worms (called Bonellia and Hamingia). The only\r\nother instance of such degradation of the male sex is in some of the\r\nbarnacles (discovered by Darwin), in which the big individuals are\r\nof double sex (hermaphrodite). Adhering to the shells of these are\r\nfound minute dot-like \"supplemental males.\" It is to be observed that\r\nthese are instances where the inferiority of the male is an obvious\r\nmeasurable fact. In the mammals, the group of vertebrate animals to\r\nwhich man belongs, the male possesses measurably greater activity and\r\nsize than does the female, and is provided with more powerful natural\r\nweapons, such as teeth and horns. He entirely dominates and controls\r\nthe female, or a whole company of females, and in no case is there\r\nequality of the sexes, or any approach to it, still less inferiority of\r\nthe male. It is, perhaps, a question whether \"by taking thought\" this\r\nnatural inferiority of the mammalian female can be changed.\r\n\r\nThe survival of Rotifers, especially of a pink-coloured species\r\n(called Philodina roseola), after long drying or \"desiccation,\" has\r\nbeen experimentally studied. It is found that if the water in which\r\nsome are swimming is placed in a watch-glass and allowed to dry up\r\nrapidly the Rotifers are killed, none reappear when after a few hours\r\nfresh water is poured into the watch-glass. But if a few grains of\r\nsand or particles of moss are present from the first in the water the\r\nfinal drying up takes place more slowly and the Rotifers find their\r\nway between the sheltering fragments, where the water remains long\r\nenough to give them time to form a little gelatinous case, each for\r\nitself. When thus encased they survive, motionless, for months. The\r\nexperiment has often been made, and is not in doubt. According to\r\ntrustworthy statements, Philodina can thus survive even for so long as\r\nfive years. The processes of life are arrested, but the drying has not\r\nproceeded to the extent which is called chemical drying or dehydration.\r\nThe tiny Rotifers are still of soft consistence: the protoplasm is\r\nnot chemically destroyed. When one is watched with the microscope as\r\nwater is allowed to flow round it after several months of dust-like\r\naridity, it is seen to emerge from its protective case and at once\r\nto commence swimming and searching for food by means of the currents\r\ndirected towards its mouth by its so-called \"wheel-apparatus.\" I may\r\njust say that in the case of the slime-mould called \"flowers of tan\"\r\nthe protoplasm dries to the consistency of hard wax, and I have kept\r\nit for years in that state and then revived it by moisture into full\r\nactivity and growth. I used also at one time to keep in my laboratory\r\na supply of the dried yellow lichen from apple-trees, in which one\r\ncould always rely upon finding the animalcules called \"Macrobiotus\" or\r\n\"water-bears\" ready to be revived from a desiccated condition, after\r\nthree or four years passed in that condition.\r\n\r\nMany of the Rotifers carry their eggs when ripe extruded from the\r\nbody in two bunches or clusters, as is the habit also of the little\r\nmicroscopic shrimps known as Cyclops. There is a whole group of\r\nRotifers which fix themselves by the tail, when full grown, to some\r\nsolid support. Each then forms a protective tube or case around\r\nitself, from the mouth of which it puts forth its wheel-apparatus\r\nand into which it can retire for protection. Some of the largest and\r\nmost beautiful of the wheel animalcules belong to this group of fixed\r\nor sedentary Rotifers. The crown animalcule (Stephanoceros) is one\r\nof these, having what are discs edged with vibrating hairs in the\r\ncommon Rotifer–here drawn out into a circlet of tapering lobes like\r\nthe points of a coronet (Fig. 37 (_bis_), B). Another is the floscule\r\n(Floscularia), in which the wheel-apparatus has the form of five knobs\r\narranged on a pentagonal disc around the mouth (A in same figure). Each\r\nknob has a bundle of excessively fine, long, stiff, motionless hairs\r\nspreading out from it ready to entangle food particles which may drift\r\ninto contact with them. I used to find the stems of the fresh-water\r\npolyp (Cordylophora) of Victoria Dock a sure source of supply of these\r\nfine little creatures. When seen under the microscope as brightly\r\nilluminated glassy florets on a black ground (by what is called \"dark\r\nground illumination\") their strange delicacy and beauty cannot be\r\nsurpassed. A rare species of floscule (which I have never seen) has\r\nextra-long and fine filaments, each of which shows a fine streaming\r\ncurrent in its substance, and is, in fact, a naked filament of living\r\nprotoplasm like one of the ray-like filaments of the sun-animalcules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37 (_bis_).–Three tube-building wheel animalcules.\r\n_A_, Floscularia campanulata. _B_, Stephanoceros Eichhornii. _C_,\r\nMelicerta ringens.]\r\n\r\nThe most curious of the tube-building Rotifers are those which form\r\ntheir tubes of little, equal-sized pellets of solid matter–as it were,\r\n\"bricks\"–which they first form by compacting fine particles in a\r\nspecial pit on the head and then build them up and cement them together\r\nin rows to form the tube, adding row after row as the animal itself\r\nincreases in length (Fig. 37 (_bis_), C). These are known as Melicerta;\r\nand, though some kinds use any minute particles to make their bricks,\r\none kind is frequent which uses its own excrement for this purpose.\r\nBy feeding the little creatures first with food coloured with carmine\r\nand then with blue-stained material, one can obtain alternate rows of\r\npink and blue pellets, carefully manufactured and laid in position\r\nto build up the growing length of tube. Melicerta has certainly an\r\nextraordinary and economical way of disposing of that refuse which we\r\nlarger creatures carefully remove from our habitations and should be\r\nvery unwilling to employ as building material. The individuals of one\r\nrare and interesting kind of the tube-builders, after swimming freely\r\nin the youngest stage, settle down together and form their gelatinous\r\ntransparent tubes side by side, to the number of fifty or more, in\r\nsuch a way as to produce a perfect sphere, a twentieth of an inch or\r\nmore in diameter, built up of fused jelly-like tubes radiating from a\r\ncommon centre. The inhabitant of each tube is quite separate from and\r\nindependent of his neighbours, but they all protrude their vibrating\r\nwheel-apparatus simultaneously, and cause the glass-like ball to rotate\r\nand travel through the water. Many years ago I found this beautiful\r\nlittle thing in a small moss-pool (not more than 3 ft. wide), high up\r\nthe sloping-side of the north-west section of Hampstead heath, above\r\nthe \"Leg of Mutton Pond.\" The well-meant care of the public guardians\r\nof the heath has now drained this region, and my little moss-pools and\r\nthe \"bog,\" in which grew the Drosera, or Sun-dew, and the Bog-bean and\r\nsuch plants, have gone for ever. But we must console ourselves with the\r\nfact that the same progressive expansion of the great city has given\r\nus electric railways, tubes, and tramways by which we can go farther\r\nafield than Hampstead in a few minutes, and still find moss-pools and\r\nthe undisturbed glories of ancient swamps and bog-land.\r\n\r\nMany of the Rotifers have a pair of ruby-red eyes, and in some of them\r\nthere is a minute crystalline lens overlying the red sensitive spot,\r\nwhich receives the fibres of the optic nerve coming from the brain–one\r\non each side. It is almost incredible that so minute a creature–often\r\nonly the one-fiftieth of an inch long when full grown–should have a\r\nnervous system and special organs of touch (sensory hairs) as well as\r\neyes, and on the other hand muscles running from one attachment to\r\nanother and called into activity by nerves connected with this same\r\ncentral brain. The pair of branched tubes, which end internally in\r\nflickering \"flame-cells\" and open externally far back at the vent, are\r\nkidneys. Similar tubes called \"nephridia\" or little kidneys are found\r\nin many of the smaller animals; the earthworm has a pair in each ring\r\nof its body.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the wheel animalcules are related in\r\npedigree to the primitive ancestors of the marine segmented or annulate\r\nworms, which also gave rise to the ringed leg-bearing jaw-footed\r\ncreatures with hard skin, called Crustacea, Arachnids and Insects (the\r\nArthropods). The wheel-apparatus or cilia-fringed discs of the Rotifer\r\nis seen in the young stages of many marine worms, and also in the\r\nyoung of marine snails, known as the \"veliger\"–\"velum\" or \"sail\" being\r\nthe name given to the wheel-apparatus of the young snails (see the\r\ndrawing on p. 181). There are very minute marine annulate or segmented\r\nworms (Dinophilus and others), which come near to the Rotifers in many\r\nfeatures, whilst the ringed or segmented character of the body is\r\nobvious in the common wheel animalcule.\r\n\r\nThe Rotifers are so small that they are built up of very few \"cells\"\r\nor nucleated units of protoplasm. Many of them are of smaller size\r\nthan some of the big infusorian animalcules, which consist of a single\r\ncell. The Rotifers are probably a dwindled pygmy race descended from\r\nancestors of ten or a hundred times their linear measurement. It\r\nis an important fact that in the possession of a toothed gizzard,\r\nin the hard body-case or cuirass of some kinds, and in Pedalion's\r\nrapidly-moving legs or paddles, fringed with plumose hairs and moved\r\nby that peculiar variety of muscular tissue which is called \"striped\r\nmuscular tissue,\" the wheel animalcules give evidence of relationship\r\nto the Crustacea–that is to say, it appears to be probable that they\r\nwere derived from the common ancestor of marine worms and Crustacea\r\nbefore those two lines of descent had diverged.\r\n\r\nRotifera or wheel animalcules are found all over the world, in the\r\ntropics, the temperate zones, the Arctic and Antarctic, and many\r\nspecies have a world-wide distribution. They occur in fresh waters\r\nand in the sea, in great lakes, in gutters which dry up, in pools in\r\nthe polar regions and on high mountains which are solid ice for the\r\ngreater part of the year. A few are parasitic, some living on the legs\r\nof minute Crustacea. One which I discovered in 1868 in the Channel\r\nIslands lives in crowds on the skin of a remarkable sea-worm (Synapta),\r\nwhich burrows in the sand, exposed at low tide. It holds on (as I found\r\nand figured) by a true sucker, which replaces the forked tail of other\r\ncommoner Rotifers. It was named \"Discopus\" by Zelinka, who searched for\r\nit in consequence of my description, and gave a very detailed account\r\nof it. Others are parasitic inside earthworms, and one is found inside\r\nthe globe animalcule Volvox! Another causes the growth of warts or\r\n\"galls\" in a curious kind of Alga called Vaucheria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nSUSPENDED ANIMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOur leading newspapers, with rare exceptions, never report the\r\ndiscoveries announced at our scientific societies. But they often\r\nseek to astonish their readers with silly stories of monsters said to\r\nhave been seen in tropical forests, ghostly \"manifestations\" and such\r\nrubbish transmitted to them at a high price by crafty \"newsmongers,\"\r\nand do much harm to themselves and to the public thereby. On the other\r\nhand, foreign newspapers do occasionally report the proceedings of\r\ntheir local Academies–and then \"our own correspondent\" telegraphs to\r\nLondon with a flourish, a confused report of what he has read and\r\nignorantly imagines to be \"a startling discovery\" because he knows\r\nnothing whatever of the subject. Thus shortly before the recent\r\nwar–the confirmation by a French experimenter of the fact, long since\r\ndemonstrated, that the seeds of plants can survive exposure to very low\r\ntemperature, was announced with ridiculous emphasis by one of these\r\n\"fat boys\" of journalism _pour épater le bourgeois_.\r\n\r\nA temperature very near to that of the total absence of that molecular\r\nmovement or vibration which we call \"heat,\" can now be attained by the\r\nuse of liquid hydrogen, which enables us, by its evaporation, to come\r\nwithin a few degrees (actually three!) of that condition known as the\r\n\"absolute zero.\" We divide into one hundred equal steps or degrees the\r\ncolumn of liquid (mercury, spirit, or other liquid) of a thermometer\r\nas it expands from the shrunken bulk which it occupies when placed in\r\nfreezing water to the full length which it attains when the water is\r\nheated to boiling point. This is called the centigrade scale, or scale\r\nof a hundred degrees. But, as we know by the records of travellers in\r\nthe Arctic regions and by the experiments made in laboratories, there\r\nare \"degrees\" of coldness or diminution of heat which are much below\r\nthat of freezing water, and can be measured by the further shrinking of\r\nthe column of liquid in the thermometer, so that we record \"degrees\r\nbelow zero centigrade,\" each of the same length as those above it and\r\ncorresponding to the same \"quantum\" of decrease or increment of heat.\r\nAs we pass from the temperature at which water is solid to that much\r\nlower or diminished state of hotness at which mercury becomes solid,\r\nthe shrinking column of the thermometer (in which a liquid is used not\r\nrendered solid by this amount of cooling) falls through 39 degrees of\r\nthe centigrade size, so that we say that mercury freezes at minus 39 or\r\nat 39 degrees below zero of the centigrade scale. The conclusion has\r\nnow been reached that the absolute zero or cessation of all heat in a\r\nbody is represented by a fall of no less than 273 degrees below zero\r\non the centigrade scale. Hydrogen gas becomes a liquid at 252 degrees\r\nbelow zero centigrade, and a solid at 264 degrees. If we start our\r\ncounting of those degrees or increments of heat, of which there are\r\n100 between the freezing and boiling points of water, at the absolute\r\nzero or condition of total absence of heat, we must say that hydrogen\r\n\"melts\"–that is, passes from the solid to the liquid state–at 11\r\ndegrees (absolute), and boils at about 20 degrees (absolute), whilst\r\nwater does not melt until 273 degrees (absolute) of temperature are\r\nreached, and boils at 373 degrees above the absolute zero.\r\n\r\nIt is the fact that, from the year 1860 onward, numerous observers have\r\nexperimented on the influence of very low temperatures upon seeds, and\r\nhave uniformly shown that the power of germination and healthy growth\r\nof the seeds is not destroyed by exposure to very low temperatures. The\r\ncelebrated Swiss botanist, De Candolle, published the first careful\r\nobservations on this subject in conjunction with Raoul Pictet, who had\r\ndevised an apparatus for producing exceedingly low temperatures. Pictet\r\nin 1893 exposed various bacteria and also seeds to a temperature of\r\nnearly 200 degrees below zero centigrade without injury to them. They\r\n\"resumed\" their life when gradually restored to the normal temperature.\r\nPictet concluded that since all chemical action of the kind which goes\r\non in living things requires a certain degree of temperature for its\r\noccurrence, and that this is demonstrably considerably higher than\r\nminus 100 degrees centigrade, we must suppose that all chemical action\r\nin living things (as in nearly all other bodies) is annihilated at 100\r\ndegrees below zero centigrade. Accordingly he maintained that what we\r\ncall \"life,\" or \"living,\" is a manifestation of chemical forces similar\r\nto those shown in other natural bodies, and liable to interruption and\r\nresumption by the operation of unfavourable or favourable conditions\r\nas are other chemical processes. In 1897, Mr. Horace Brown and Mr. F.\r\nEscombe published, in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London,\r\nan account of experiments in which they exposed seeds of twelve plants\r\nbelonging to widely different natural orders to a temperature varying\r\nfrom 183 degrees to 192 degrees below zero centigrade for a period\r\nof 110 consecutive hours (about four days and a half). As a result\r\nthe germinative powers of the seeds showed no appreciable difference\r\nfrom that of seed not subjected to cold, and they produced healthy\r\nplants. The low temperature was obtained by the use of liquid air\r\nin a vacuum-jacketed flask (like the well-known \"thermos\" flasks),\r\ninto which the seeds were introduced in thin glass tubes. Professor\r\nM'Kendrick had previously shown that the putrescence of meat, blood\r\nand milk by bacteria infesting them was temporarily arrested, but\r\nnot permanently so, by exposing those substances for one hour to a\r\ntemperature of 182 degrees below zero centigrade. It appeared that the\r\nputrefactive bacteria present in those substances were not destroyed\r\nby that degree of cold, but returned to a state of activity when the\r\nnormal temperature was restored. Professor M'Kendrick also showed that\r\nseeds would germinate after exposure to like treatment.\r\n\r\nAll this is ancient history, twenty years and more in the past. The\r\nexperiments of a French observer, mentioned at the beginning of this\r\nchapter as foolishly trumpeted in a London paper, were of service as\r\nconfirming the extensive and careful work of his predecessors. It is\r\nonly when our old well-bottled discoveries have, however tardily, been\r\nbrought before the Paris Academy of Sciences and sent back to us by\r\nthe Paris correspondents of news agencies as \"startling novelties\" and\r\n\"amazing discoveries\" (twenty years old), that any attempt is made to\r\nmention them in the London daily Press. And then they are announced\r\nwithout any reference to their true history. This habit of culling\r\nstale morsels of information from the proceedings of foreign academies\r\npoints to the fact that there is incompetence both in the purveyor and\r\npublisher of such scraps. If our newspaper editors must publish scraps\r\nabout scientific novelties, they should employ educated assistants\r\nto see that they do not make themselves ridiculous. The scraps which\r\ncome round to our newspapers from Paris are usually plagiarized from a\r\nFrench newspaper by some one who has a very imperfect knowledge of the\r\nsubject to which they refer, and adds his own blunders to those of the\r\noriginal reporter.\r\n\r\nThe action of extreme cold in arresting life in such minute organisms\r\nas plant seeds and bacteria without destroying the possibility of\r\nthe resumption of those chemical and physical changes when warmth is\r\nrestored, is dependent on the fact that those chemical changes can\r\nonly proceed in and by the aid of liquid water. When thoroughly frozen\r\nthe chemical constituents of minute organisms and seeds–which until\r\nfrozen were living and undergoing continuous, though perhaps slow,\r\nchange–become solid, and can no longer act on one another or be acted\r\non by surrounding chemical bodies equally reduced in temperature.\r\nThey may be compared to the solid dry constituents of a Seidlitz\r\npowder–one an acid, the other a carbonate. So long as they are dry\r\nthey remain–when mixed and shaken together–inert, without action\r\non one another. Even if one is dissolved in water and then frozen\r\nsolid and mixed in a powdered state with the other at an equally low\r\ntemperature the mixture remains dry and inert. Nothing happens so long\r\nas the low temperature is maintained. But if we raise the temperature\r\nabove the freezing-point–so as to liquefy the solution–chemical action\r\nwill immediately ensue. With much fizzing and escape of gas the two\r\nchemicals will unite. The effect of cold on living matter is of this\r\nnature. It is a real \"suspension\" of the changes which were–however\r\nslowly and quietly–going on before complete solidification of the\r\nprotoplasm by freezing. A frozen seed and frozen bacteria are in a\r\nstate of \"suspended animation.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not the fact that absolutely all chemical union and change\r\nwhatsoever is prevented–that is to say, arrested or suspended–by\r\nextreme cold, although the union with oxygen and other such changes of\r\nthe essential material of living things, which we call \"protoplasm,\"\r\nand most other chemical changes are thus arrested or suspended. The\r\nmost striking exception is that of the most active of all elements,\r\nthe gas fluorine, which becomes a liquid at 210 degrees below zero\r\ncentigrade, and in that condition attacks turpentine if brought into\r\ncontact with it at the same low temperature with explosive force. Even\r\nsolid fluorine combines with liquid hydrogen with violent explosion.\r\nIt seems certain, however, that elements or chemical compounds brought\r\ninto the solid (not merely liquid) condition by extreme cold cannot act\r\nchemically upon other bodies in the same solid condition, even when\r\nthey would at normal temperatures so act with the greatest readiness,\r\nbecause they are then either liquid or gaseous.\r\n\r\nThe conception of an arrest of the changes in organisms, which we call\r\nlife, followed by their resumption after a greater or less interval of\r\nsuspense, was long ago suggested and discussed before we had knowledge\r\nof the action of low temperatures. The winter-sleep of some animals\r\nand the \"comatose\" condition sometimes exhibited by human beings\r\nhad led to the notion of \"suspended animation.\" But a careful study\r\nof hybernating animals and of human instances of prolonged \"coma\"\r\nsatisfied physiologists nearly 100 years ago that the processes of\r\nlife–the beating of the heart and the respiration–were not actually\r\nand absolutely suspended in these cases, but reduced to a minimum. The\r\nchemical processes connected with life were still very slowly carried\r\non.\r\n\r\nAgain, a great deal of interest and discussion was excited in the last\r\ncentury by the drying up of delicate yet complex aquatic animalcules,\r\nsuch as the Rotifers (the wheel animalcules described in our last\r\nchapter) and Tardigrades (bear animalcules), and the fact that after\r\ntheir preservation as mere dust for many months dried on a glass-slip\r\nthey could be revived and made to return to life by wetting them with a\r\nminute drop of water, whilst the whole process of revival was watched\r\nunder the microscope. Letters were published in the \"Times\" in the\r\n\"fifties\" by the Rev. Lord Sydney Godolphin Osborn, describing his\r\nobservations and experiments on these animalcules.\r\n\r\nThe yellow slime-fungus called \"flowers of tan,\" after creeping as\r\na naked network of protoplasm over the \"spent tan,\" thrown out from\r\ntan-pits, will in dry weather gather itself into little knobs, each\r\nof which is as hard and brittle as a piece of sealing-wax. Yet (as I\r\nhave repeatedly experienced in using material given to me by the great\r\nbotanist, de Bary) a fragment of one of these hard pieces, if carefully\r\nguarded in a dry pill-box for two or three years, will when placed on\r\na film of water at summer-heat gradually absorb moisture and expand\r\nitself into threads of creeping, flowing protoplasm, nourish itself,\r\nand grow and reproduce. It was formerly suggested in regard to these\r\ncases of resuscitation after drying, as also in the case of seeds which\r\ngerminate after being kept in a dry condition for many years, that\r\nreally they were not thoroughly dried, but were sufficiently moist to\r\nallow of very slow oxidation and gas exchange, which it was said was\r\nso small in amount as to escape observation. There was a plausible\r\ncomparison of the condition of these dried organisms to that of\r\nhybernating mammals, desiccated snails, and comatose men. It was held\r\nthat here, too, the life-processes were not absolutely arrested, but\r\nreduced to an imperceptible minimum.\r\n\r\nThis view of the matter was connected, no doubt, with a traditional\r\nassumption that life was an entity–an \"anima animans\"–which entered a\r\nliving body, kept it continually \"going\" or \"living,\" and if driven\r\nout from it could not return. Curiously enough, Mr. Herbert Spencer\r\nseems to have been (perhaps unconsciously) affected by this traditional\r\nview, since he defined life as \"the continuous\"–that is the important\r\nword–\"adaptation of internal to external relations.\" This definition\r\nprejudiced the view of some distinguished physiologists on the question\r\nof \"suspended animation,\" and I remember a very warm dinner-table\r\ndiscussion with Michael Foster and other friends, some twenty-five\r\nyears ago, when I put forward the view that so long as the intimate\r\nstructure–in fact, the chemical structure–of the protoplasm of a living\r\nthing is not destroyed, it does not \"die\" though all chemical change in\r\nit may be arrested. I compared the dried seed and dried animalcule–as\r\nI would now compare the frozen seed and the frozen bacteria–to a well\r\nwound watch which is stopped by the intrusion of a needle between the\r\nspokes of its balance wheel, or, better, by the cooling on the wheel of\r\na tiny drop of soft wax so as to clog it. The works of the watch are\r\nrendered absolutely motionless, but it is not \"dead.\" As soon as the\r\nneedle is removed or the tiny speck of wax melted by a gentle warmth\r\nit resumes its movement. It is, as we say, \"alive again.\" So, too,\r\nthe frozen or dried organism is absolutely motionless. No chemical\r\nmovements can go on in it. They are stopped by the solidity set up by\r\nfreezing, or in the case of simple \"desiccation,\" by the absence of the\r\nmoisture necessary for bringing the chemical molecules into contact.\r\nIf protected from destructive agents, the mechanism remains perfect\r\nfor just so many years or centuries as that protection lasts. Whenever\r\nthe frozen organism thaws or the dried organism becomes wet, the\r\nlife-processes are resumed, the seed germinates, the bacteria grow and\r\nmultiply.\r\n\r\nThus we see what are some of the points of interest and importance\r\nraised by the old experiments of Pictet, M'Kendrick, and Horace Brown,\r\nthe results of which were the same as those announced as Parisian\r\nnovelties. I have yet to say a few words as to the reason why we cannot\r\nproduce \"suspended animation\" in higher organisms or in man by the\r\napplication to them of extreme cold. Further, the influence of extreme\r\ncold on the possible passage, through space, of living germs from\r\nother worlds to this earth–a possibility suggested by the late Lord\r\nKelvin–requires some consideration in connection with the striking\r\nexperiments with phosphorescent bacteria described ten years ago by Sir\r\nJames Dewar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Young stages of growth or Veliger larvæ of marine\r\nsnails, showing the ciliated band or velum which is identical with the\r\nwheel apparatus of the Rotifers or Wheel animalcules.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT SUSPENDED ANIMATION\r\n\r\n\r\nI gave some account in the last chapter of the experiments made within\r\nthe last twenty years, which have shown that, in certain very simple\r\norganisms and in seeds, all chemical change can be stopped by the\r\napplication to them of methods of freezing. The continuous changes\r\nwhich go on in these living things under ordinary circumstances are\r\narrested by the solidification of what was more or less \"moist\"\r\nmaterial. Water in the liquid state, though it may be in extremely\r\nminute quantity, is necessary for the chemical combinations and\r\ndecompositions which go on in living things. Hence not only the\r\nsolidification of all moisture, in or having access to the living\r\nbodies experimented on, arrests those chemical combinations and\r\ndecompositions, but very thorough drying also has this result. Yet\r\neither on thawing the frozen liquid or supplying moisture to the \"dried\r\nup\" organism, the previously continuous chemical and physical changes\r\nare resumed as though no arrest or suspension of them had occurred. No\r\nlimit is known to the length of time during which this arrest may be\r\ncontinued, and yet a resumption of living changes occur when the cause\r\nof arrest–namely, either solidification by cold or else dryness–is\r\nremoved. The apparatus–the exact structure and the exact chemical\r\nmaterials–of the seeds or the bacteria remains uninjured and unchanged\r\nby either freezing or drying carefully applied. It is, of course,\r\nimpossible to guarantee that no accident, no unforeseen change in the\r\nsurroundings, shall take place and destroy in one way or another the\r\nexperiment. But the arrest of all change, such as goes on in life, has\r\nbeen, in many experiments, maintained under careful supervision and\r\nprotection for several months, and yet life has been resumed when the\r\ncause arresting chemical change has been removed. The presumption,\r\nthen, is in favour of the possibility of the arrest being maintained\r\nfor an unlimited period, and yet at any time being resumed when the\r\narresting cause (cold or dryness) is removed.\r\n\r\nBefore what we may call \"the suspensory action\" of very low\r\ntemperatures had become generally known, the question occurred as to\r\nwhether seeds kept in a dry condition for several months, or even\r\nyears, and yet capable of germination when placed in moist earth,\r\nare during their dry condition undergoing any chemical changes. The\r\nmatter presented itself in this way. The dry seeds can germinate when\r\nsown, therefore they are not dead, but living. According to various\r\nphysiologists and philosophers (_e.g._, Herbert Spencer), life is\r\na continuous adjustment of internal to external relations. Burdon\r\nSanderson, the Oxford professor of Physiology, declared that \"life is\r\na state of ceaseless change.\" If this is a correct conception, and if\r\nby \"living\" we mean, as the great Oxford English Dictionary tells us,\r\n\"manifesting the property called life,\" then the seeds which, though\r\ndry, are still \"living\" or \"alive\" or \"endowed with life,\" should yield\r\nsome evidence of the \"ceaseless change\" (by which is meant chemical\r\nchange) of which, as things not dead but living, they are supposed\r\nto be the seat. The late Dr. George Romanes published in 1893 some\r\nexperiments on this matter. We know that free oxygen is very generally\r\n(though not universally) necessary for the continual chemical changes\r\nwhich the minutest as well as the largest plants and animals carry on.\r\nRomanes enclosed a quantity of dry seeds in glass tubes, from which he\r\npumped out all gas as completely as possible–that is to say, all except\r\none-millionth of the original volume. He also expelled all oxygen by\r\nreplacing it by other gases. As a result of this treatment, continued\r\nfor as much as fifteen months, he found that neither a high vacuum nor\r\nsubsequent exposure for twelve months in separate instances to oxygen\r\nor to hydrogen, or nitrogen, or carbon monoxide, or carbon dioxide,\r\nor hydrogen sulphide, or the vapour of ether or of chloroform, had\r\nany effect on the subsequent germinative power of the seeds employed.\r\nThese experiments proved that anything like respiration by ordinary\r\ngaseous exchange with the atmosphere was _not_ going on in the seeds,\r\nand that if they are the seat of \"ceaseless change\" because not dead,\r\nthe changes must be chemical interactions of some kind or other within\r\ntheir protoplasm.\r\n\r\nThe keeping of seeds and also of bacteria for days and even months–at\r\ntemperatures as low as 100 degrees below zero centigrade–and their\r\nsubsequent resumption of life, has removed the possibility (not\r\nexcluded by Romanes) of the occurrence of chemical interactions within\r\nthe substance of these organisms preserved during long periods of\r\ntime, and yet not ceasing to be what is ordinarily called \"alive,\"\r\nor endowed with \"life.\" It is time that we should definitely abandon\r\nHerbert Spencer's and Burdon Sanderson's definitions or verbal\r\ncharacterizations of \"life.\" The word \"life\" is commonly and properly\r\nused to designate the condition of a \"living thing\" or a thing which\r\nis \"alive.\" A thing which has lost life–that is, which was living, but\r\nis so no more, and cannot be \"restored to life\" or resuscitated–is, in\r\ncorrect English, said to have \"died,\" or to be \"dead.\" The motionless,\r\nunchanging frozen seed or bacterium, which resumes its living\r\nactivities when carefully thawed, has _not_ \"died.\" The mere fact that\r\nit can be resuscitated justifies the application to it, according to\r\ncorrect English usage, of the word \"alive\"–it is still \"alive.\" It is\r\nnot possible to alter the significance of the words \"life,\" \"living\"\r\nand \"alive,\" so as to retain the definitions of Herbert Spencer and\r\nBurdon Sanderson as correct. They are incorrect. Life is not continuous\r\nor ceaseless change. It is a property of the more active substance of\r\nplants and animals which has special structure and definite chemical\r\nconstituents. The property is, no doubt, usually manifested under\r\nnormal conditions of temperature, light, moisture, pressure, chemical\r\nand electrical surroundings in a continuous series of changes, both\r\nchemical and physical. But at exceptionally low temperature, and in\r\nother arresting circumstances these changes can, in a few exceptional\r\norganisms, be absolutely stopped, though the organism in which the\r\nchanges cease is uninjured as a mechanism. It still possesses \"the\r\nproperty of life\"–is still \"alive\" although motionless and unchanging.\r\nIts life is in suspense, as is that of a clock with arrested pendulum.\r\n\r\nThe unjustified conception of \"life,\" or \"living,\" or being \"alive,\"\r\nand not dead, as necessarily a state of incessant chemical and\r\nother change, is bound up with the old fancy that life is not to be\r\nconsidered as a state or motion of a special and complex structure\r\ncalled protoplasm, but is a thing, a spirit or an essence, which takes\r\npossession of organic bodies and makes them \"live.\" According to Sir\r\nOliver Lodge, if chemists could build up the chemical materials which\r\nconstitute protoplasm, the protoplasm so made by them would not live.\r\nIt would (he stated at the meeting of the British Association in\r\nBirmingham in 1912) have to receive a charge or infusion, as it were,\r\nof this thing suggested by the word \"life.\" It cannot live itself\r\n(according to the suppositions of Sir Oliver), but serves as the\r\nvehicle, the receptacle, for this supposed intangible entity \"life.\" In\r\nthe same imaginative vein, our grandfathers used to say that heat was\r\ndue to the entity or \"fairy\" \"caloric\" which could be enticed into or\r\ndriven from material bodies, making them \"hot\" by its presence and cold\r\nby its greater or less exclusion. The suspended animation of frozen\r\ngerms and their return to life when warmed could thus be represented\r\nas an affection or affinity between the fairy \"Vitalis\" and the fairy\r\n\"Caloric,\" the former fleeing from the body and waiting near when the\r\nlatter deserts his place, but returning to happy union with \"Caloric\"\r\nwhen he again, however feebly, pervades once more the vehicle provided\r\nfor \"Vitalis.\" Such imaginary essences are not of any assistance to\r\nus in arriving at a knowledge of the facts, and so far from helping\r\nus to a comprehension of the ultimate nature of things (which we\r\nhave no reason to suppose that it is possible for us to attain)\r\ntheir introduction tends to the substitution of imaginary causes and\r\nunverified assumptions for the carefully-tested and demonstrated\r\nconclusions of science.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 Lord Kelvin, when president of the British Association,\r\nsuggested that the origin of life as we know it may have been\r\nextra-terrestrial, and due to the \"moss-grown fragments from the\r\nruins of another world,\" which reached the earth as meteorites. It\r\nwas objected to this that the extreme cold–very near to the absolute\r\nzero–which prevails in interstellar space would be fatal to all germs\r\nof life carried by such meteoric stones. But twenty years later Sir\r\nJames Dewar showed that this objection did not hold, since at any\r\nrate some forms of life–certain bacteria–could survive an exposure of\r\nseveral days to a temperature approaching the absolute zero. Later Sir\r\nJames made some very striking experiments by exposing cultivations of\r\nphosphorescent bacteria to the temperature of liquid hydrogen (252\r\ndegrees below zero centigrade). These bacteria may be obtained by\r\nselective cultivation from sea-water taken on the coast, in which a few\r\nare always scattered. A rich growth of these bacteria in gelatine broth\r\ngives off a brilliant greenish light when shaken with atmospheric air\r\nor otherwise exposed to oxygen. The light is so intense that a glass\r\nflask holding a pint of the cultivation gives off sufficient light to\r\nenable one to read in an otherwise dark room. The emission of light\r\nis dependent on the chemical activity of the living bacteria in the\r\npresence of oxygen. In the absence of free oxygen they cease to be\r\nluminous. As soon as they are killed the light ceases. When they are\r\nfrozen solid the light ceases, even in the presence of free oxygen\r\ngas. When a film consisting of such a culture is frozen solid it will\r\nremain inactive if the low temperature be maintained for months, though\r\nexposed to free oxygen gas, and then, as soon as it is liquefied by\r\na gentle rise in temperature, the active changes recommence, and the\r\nphosphorescent light beams forth. Sir James Dewar exposed such films\r\nto the low temperature of liquid hydrogen for (so far as I remember)\r\nsix months, and obtained from them at once the evidence of their living\r\nchemical activity, namely, their \"phosphorescence,\" as soon as they\r\nwere thawed. In the frozen state, at a temperature of minus 250 degrees\r\ncentigrade, nothing, it appeared, could injure these phosphorescent\r\nbacteria. No chemical can \"get at them\" at that temperature, the most\r\nbiting acid, the most caustic alkali cannot touch them when, like them,\r\nit is in a hard, solid condition. Powdering the film by mechanical\r\npressure has no effect on the bacteria. They are too small to be\r\ncrushed by any mill. Such germs would, it seemed, surely be able to\r\ntravel through interstellar space, as suggested by Kelvin.\r\n\r\nThen it occurred to Sir James that light–the strangely active\r\nultra-violet rays of light–might be able to disintegrate and destroy\r\nthe bacteria, even when frozen solid at the lowest temperature. He\r\nexposed his frozen cultures to strong light, excluding any heat-giving\r\nrays, and found that the bacteria no longer recovered when subsequently\r\nthe culture was thawed. Light, certain rays of light, can, it thus\r\nappears, penetrate and cause destructive vibrations in chemical bodies\r\nprotected from all other disintegrating agencies by the solidity\r\nconferred by extreme cold. I am not able to say, at the moment, how\r\nfar this important matter has been pursued by further experiment, nor\r\nwhether what are called the \"chemically active\" rays of light and\r\nother rays such as the Röntgen rays can effect chemical change in\r\nother bodies (besides living germs), upon which they act at normal\r\ntemperatures, but in regard to which they might be expected to be\r\ninoperative when the bodies in question are brought into the peculiar\r\nstate of inactivity produced by extreme cold. Since light is far more\r\nintense outside our atmosphere than within it, it seemed, at first,\r\nthat the demonstration of its destructive action on frozen germs puts\r\nan end to Kelvin's theory of a meteoric origin of life. It must,\r\nhowever, be remembered that minute living germs could conceivably be\r\nprotected from the access of light by being embedded in even very\r\nsmall opaque particles of meteoric clay. So Lord Kelvin's suggestion\r\nas to the travelling of life on meteoric dust cannot be set aside as\r\ninvolving the supposition of the persistence of life in conditions\r\nknown to be destructive of it.\r\n\r\nThe great interest in former times in relation to \"suspended\r\nanimation\" has naturally been in relation to the occurrence of this\r\ncondition in man and the possibility of producing it in man by this\r\nor that treatment. There is no doubt whatever, at the present day,\r\nthat \"death-like\" trances, whether occurring naturally or after the\r\nadministration of drugs, in the case of man and of higher animals,\r\nare not due to that complete suspension of living changes which we can\r\nproduce, as I have here related, in certain lower forms of life. These\r\ndeath-like trances are merely cases of reduction of the living changes\r\nto a very low degree.[6]\r\n\r\nThe bodies of all but the simplest animals and plants are too large and\r\ntoo complex to survive the bursting and disruptive action of extreme\r\ncold, due to the unequal distribution of water within them and its\r\nirresistible expansion when frozen. Their living mechanism is broken,\r\nmechanically destroyed by this expansion. We cannot hope to apply\r\ncold to man so as to produce \"suspended animation.\" It is true that\r\nexperiments are on record in which fish and even frogs have survived\r\nenclosure within a solid mass of ice by the freezing of the water in\r\nwhich they were living. But careful experiments are wanting which\r\nwould demonstrate that these animals were actually frozen through and\r\nthrough, and that either fish or other cold-blooded animals can survive\r\na thorough solidification by freezing of their entire substance. Such\r\nsurvival cannot be pronounced to be impossible, but it has not been\r\ndemonstrated in any cold-blooded animal–even shell-fish or worm or\r\npolyp–let alone a warm-blooded mammal. It appears that, apart from\r\ndisruptive effects, the protoplasm of even very minute and simple\r\norganisms, such as the Protozoa, does not in all kinds, even if in any,\r\nsurvive exposure to great cold. The toleration of great cold and return\r\nto living activity after thorough freezing is, it appears, a special\r\nquality attained by the living material of vegetable seeds and by many\r\nkinds of bacteria. A similar special toleration of high temperatures,\r\na good deal short of the boiling point, but high enough to kill most\r\nplants and animals, is known to characterize certain bacteria and\r\nallied Schizophyta found in hot springs. It is a matter of common\r\nknowledge that many animals and plants are killed by a temperature\r\n(whether too high or too low for them) which allows others to flourish\r\nand may be necessary for their life. Minute organisms (flagellate\r\nmonads) have been cultivated experimentally in a nourishing liquid, the\r\ntemperature of which was raised daily by one or two degrees until the\r\nliquid was so hot that the same species of organism was at once killed\r\nby it when abruptly transferred to it from liquid at ordinary summer\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe true \"suspended animation\" of many vegetable seeds and of many\r\nkinds of bacteria under the influence of cold is not an exhibition of\r\na general property of living things, but is due to a special quality\r\nof resistance gradually attained by natural selection of variations a\r\nlittle more tolerant of cold or of drought than are the majority. It is\r\nof life-saving value and a cause of survival to the species of plants\r\nand bacteria concerned. No doubt there is need of further experiment on\r\nthe subject of the \"killing\" or destructive effect exerted by different\r\ndegrees of diminution of temperature upon the protoplasm of all kinds\r\nof organisms, and with the knowledge so obtained we shall be able to\r\nframe a conception of the actual mechanical and chemical peculiarities\r\nof the protoplasm of those bacteria and of those vegetable seeds\r\nwhich can be exposed to the extreme of cold for many months or for an\r\nindefinite period and yet subsequently recover or live again. Probably\r\nin order to survive freezing, protoplasm must be, not absolutely dry,\r\nbut free from all but a minimum of moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[6] See the chapter on \"Sleep,\" in my \"Science from an Easy Chair,\"\r\nMethuen, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE SWASTIKA\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.–The swastika in its simplest rectangular form.\r\nIt may turn to the right, as here, or to the left, a less usual thing,\r\nbut without significance.]\r\n\r\nA good many people have never heard of the Swastika. It is an emblem\r\nor device such as is the Cross or the Crescent. Here it is (Fig. 38)\r\nin its most simple and most common form. In India it is in common use\r\nat the present day, and has been so for ages. It is the emblem of good\r\nluck. The name \"Swastika,\" by which it is widely known, is a Sanskrit\r\nword meaning \"good luck.\" The word is composed of Su, the equivalent\r\nof the Greek _eu_, signifying \"well\" or \"good,\" and asti (like the\r\nGreek _esto_), signifying \"being,\" whilst ka is a suffix completing\r\nthe word as a substantive. The sign or emblem called Swastika must\r\nhave existed and been largely used in decoration of temples, images,\r\nswords, banners, utensils, and personal trinkets of all sorts long\r\nbefore this name was given to it. It has a name in many widely separate\r\nlanguages. It is often referred to by English writers as the fylfot,\r\nthe gammadion, and the \"crux ansata,\" also as the \"croix gammée.\" It is\r\noften found more roughly drawn (on pottery or cloth) as shown in Fig.\r\n39. Often the arms of the cross are bent rigidly at right angles as\r\nin Fig. 38, but they are often only curved as seen in Fig. 39, C, or\r\ncurled spirally as in B, when it is called an \"ogee.\" The arms of the\r\nSwastika are sometimes bent to the right as in Fig. 38, and sometimes\r\nto the left as in Fig. 39. This difference does not appear to have any\r\nsymbolic significance, but to depend on the fancy of the artist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.–Three simple varieties of the swastika.\r\n_A_, the normal rectangular. _B_, the ogee variety (with spiral\r\nextremities). _C_, the curvilinear or \"current\" variety.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.–Footprint of the Buddha, from an ancient Indian\r\ncarving, showing several swastikas. (Fergusson and Schliemann.)]\r\n\r\nIn Figs. 40 to 45 a few examples are shown of the Swastika from various\r\nplaces and ages. It was in use in Japan in ancient times, and is\r\nstill common there and in Korea. In China, where it is called \"wan,\"\r\nit was at one time used, when enclosed in a circle, as a character\r\nor pictograph to signify the sun. It has been employed in China from\r\ntime immemorial to mark sacred or specially honoured works of art,\r\nbuildings, porcelain, pictures, robes, and is sometimes tattooed on\r\nthe hands, arms, or breast. In India it is widely used in decoration\r\nby both Buddhists and Brahmins; children have it painted on their\r\nshaven heads, and it is introduced in various ceremonies. The gigantic\r\ncarved footprints of Buddha from an Indian temple drawn in Fig. 40 show\r\nseveral Swastikas on the soles of the feet and on the toes. In the\r\nNear East and in Europe the Swastika is no longer in use: it is not,\r\nin fact, popularly known. But in ancient and very remote times it was\r\nin constant use in these regions, especially by the Mykenæan people\r\nand those who came under their influence, and also by the people of\r\nthe Bronze Age–before the use of iron in Europe. Fig. 41 shows a vase\r\nof Mykenæan age (about 1200 years B.C.) from Cyprus ornamented with\r\nSwastikas. Hundreds of terra-cotta \"spindle-whorls\" like Fig. 42 were\r\nfound by Schliemann in excavating Hissarlik and the site of ancient\r\nTroy, and some of them date from 3000 B.C. in layers of different ages.\r\nThe vase on which is painted the ornament shown in Fig. 43 is from\r\nBœotia, and belongs to the same early period–the \"Mykenæan\" or \"Ægæan\"\r\nbefore that of the Hellenes. It still survives in the pottery of the\r\nDipylon period (_circa_ 800 B.C.), as is seen in the fragment drawn\r\nin Fig. 6, Chapter I. The later Greeks of the great classical period\r\n(Hellenes) did not use the Swastika. Nor has it been found on the works\r\nof art of the ancient Egyptians, nor in the remains of Babylonia,\r\nAssyria or Persia. It, in fact, seems to have belonged especially to\r\nthat ancient \"Minoan\" civilization, the remains of which are found\r\nin Crete and the other Greek islands. The same culture and the same\r\nrace is revealed to us by the discoveries of Schliemann at Mykenæ and\r\nother spots in Greece, and at Hissarlik, the seat of ancient Troy. The\r\nMykenæan art seems not to have been transmitted to the post-Homeric\r\nGreeks, nor to Egypt, nor to Babylonia and Assyria. The Swastika seems,\r\nlike the \"flying gallop\" of Mykenæan art, to have travelled in very\r\nancient times by a north-eastern route to the Far East. I have given\r\nsome account of the latter, with illustrations, in \"Science from an\r\nEasy Chair,\" Second series. Like the representation of the galloping\r\nhorse, with both fore and hind legs stretched and the hoofs of the hind\r\nlegs turned upwards, the Swastika is found in the remarkable metal work\r\n(Fig. 43 _bis_) discovered in the necropolis of Koban, in the Caucasus,\r\ndating from 500 B.C. The Swastika and the \"flying gallop\" probably\r\ntravelled together across Asia to China and the Far East, and so\r\neventually to India on the one hand and Japan on the other–the Swastika\r\nthus escaping altogether, as does the pose of the \"flying gallop,\" the\r\nNear East and later Greece. This is a very remarkable and interesting\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.–Vase from Cyprus (Mykenæan Age, _circa_ 1200\r\nB.C.); painted with lotus, bird and four swastikas (Metropolitan\r\nMuseum, New York City).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.–Terra-cotta spindle-whorl marked with\r\nswastikas. Troy, 4th city (Schliemann).]\r\n\r\nThe Mykenæans and their island relatives obtained the Swastika either\r\nfrom the ancient Bronze-age people of Europe or else gave it to them,\r\nsince it is very nearly as common as a decoration or symbol on the\r\nbronze swords, spear-heads, shields, and other metal work of these\r\nprehistoric people of the middle and north of Europe (also occurring\r\nin the pottery of the Swiss Lake dwellings), as it is in the islands\r\nand adjacent lands of the Eastern Mediterranean. The Swastika is also\r\nfound abundantly on the early work of the Etruscans, but disappeared\r\nfrom general use in Italy, as it did from the rest of Europe, before\r\nhistoric times, although occasionally used (as in the decoration of\r\nthe walls of a house at Pompeii). All over Germany, Scandinavia,\r\nFrance, and Britain it is found (Fig. 44) on objects of the Bronze\r\nperiod–sometimes on stone as well as on bronze utensils, ornaments,\r\nand weapons. A few objects of Anglo-Saxon age are ornamented with\r\nit–especially remarkable is a piece of pottery of that age from Norfolk\r\n(Fig. 45).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.–Ornament from an archaic (pre-Hellenic) Bœotian\r\nvase, showing several swastikas, Greek crosses and two serpents (from\r\nGoodyear).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43. (_bis_).–Swastika in bronze repoussé, from the\r\nnecropolis of Koban, Caucasus (after Chantre \"Le Caucase\"), about 500\r\nB.C.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.–Silver-plated bronze horse-gear from\r\nScandinavia, showing two swastikas, and below a complex elaboration of\r\na swastika. (Bronze Age, about 1500 B.C.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.–Anglo-Saxon urn from Shropham, Norfolk,\r\nornamented by twenty small hand-made swastikas stamped into the clay.\r\n(British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThe history of the \"Swastika\" would be remarkable enough if it ended\r\nhere with the disappearance of its use in Europe in prehistoric times\r\nand its continued use in the Far East and India. But the most curious\r\nfact about it is that we find it as a very common and favourite\r\ndecoration and device among the native tribes in North America and\r\nMexico, and exceptionally in Brazil. It is found in use among the\r\nIndians of Kansas and other tribes–as a device in pottery, in bead-work\r\n(Fig. 46), patch-work, quill-embroidery, and other decorative fabrics.\r\nThe Indians called Sacs, Kickapoos, and Pottawottamies, who worship\r\nthe sun (which is associated with the Swastika in China), call it by\r\na native name signifying \"the luck.\" It is also found as a decorative\r\ndesign in the most ancient remains of man in America, dating (so far as\r\ncan be guessed) from a thousand years or more before Columbus (Fig. 47).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.–Piece of a ceremonial bead-worked garter,\r\nshowing star and two swastikas made by the Sac Indians, Cook County,\r\nKansas. (Modern.)]\r\n\r\nIt is generally held that the Swastika must have been introduced into\r\nAmerica in prehistoric times by early redskin immigrants from Asia. The\r\nquestion has been raised as to whether this introduction was before or\r\nafter the worship of Buddha in Asia. It is only amongst Buddhists that\r\nthe Swastika has a religious or sacred character. Elsewhere it seems to\r\nhave been a mark or sign carrying \"good luck.\" A representation of a\r\nsitting human figure incised on shell has been found in a prehistoric\r\nburial-mound in Tennessee, which has remarkable resemblance to the\r\nAsiatic statues of the Buddha. Shell ornaments have also been found\r\nhere decorated with sharply-cut Swastikas, and in a mound in Ohio thin\r\nplates of copper were found cut into simple Swastika shapes like that\r\nof Fig. 38, four inches across. Modern Mexican Indians make brooches of\r\ngold and turquoise in the form of the Swastika, and it is a favourite\r\ndevice among the Indians of neighbouring territory. Swastikas occur as\r\ndecorations or lucky marks on the small terra-cotta \"fig-leaf,\" which\r\nwas worn by the women of some of the aboriginal tribes of Brazil, and\r\nhave also been found on native pottery from the Paraguay River.\r\n\r\nSome students of this subject have held the opinion that the \"Swastika\"\r\nhas been invented independently at different times in different\r\nparts of the world. It is a fairly simple device, it is true; but\r\nthe view which is accepted at present is that it has spread from\r\none centre–probably European in the late Stone period–through the\r\nMykenæans, across Asia, and so with early immigrants across the Pacific\r\ninto the American continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.–A stone slab from the ancient city of Mayapan\r\n(Yucatan, Central America), on which (right side) a curvilinear\r\nswastika is carved. (From the American Antiquarian Society, 1881.)]\r\n\r\nApart from this problem, there is an interesting question as to how\r\nthe device probably took its origin. The \"Swastika\" is sometimes\r\ncalled the \"gammadion,\" because it may be regarded as four individuals\r\nof the Greek letter gamma (which has this shape [Greek: G]) joined\r\nat right angles to one another. The old English name for it, dating\r\nfrom Anglo-Saxon times, was fylfot–an old Norse word of doubtful\r\nmeaning, which has no currency at the present day.\r\n\r\nA method of making the Swastika by piling up sand or grain on a flat\r\nsurface, actually in use at the present time in India, is shown in Fig.\r\n48. The artist makes first of all a circle with a cross drawn within it\r\n(A). Then the circle is rubbed out or cut away at four corresponding\r\npoints where the arms of the cross touch the circle, and so we get\r\nB. Then by the straightening of the curved pieces we get the correct\r\nrectangular Swastika, C. It is not probable that this is the way in\r\nwhich the Swastika was originally devised, though it is not possible to\r\narrive at any certainty on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn these matters concerning the origin of simple ornamental patterns,\r\ndesigns, and symbols, we always have to deal with certain natural\r\nopposing tendencies on the part of the artist-draughtsman or designer,\r\none or other of which may be variously called into prominence by the\r\nsoftness or hardness or other quality of the material he has to use,\r\nor by the individual fancy for elaboration or for simplification which\r\nexists in him. I will call four of these tendencies which concern us\r\nin regard to the Swastika: 1, the rectilinear as opposed to 2, the\r\ncurvilinear, and 3, the grammatizing as opposed to 4, the naturalizing\r\ntendency, and will show what bearing they may have on the origin of the\r\ndevice known as the Swastika.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.–Diagram to show the derivation of the swastika\r\nfrom a Greek cross enclosed by a circle. In India the swastika is\r\nactually modelled in this way–in native ceremonies with rice-grain\r\nspread on the ground. The successive figures drawn above are produced\r\nby moving the rice with the hand.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE SWASTIKA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Swastika is, we have seen, a very early device or symbol in\r\nuse among ancient races in Europe, Asia and America. Though it has\r\nbeen found on an ingot of metal in Ashanti it was of late foreign\r\nintroduction there, and is not known in Africa, nor in Polynesia and\r\nAustralia, nor among the Eskimos. How did it as a mere matter of\r\nshape and pattern come into existence? One might suppose that such\r\ncombinations of lines as the simple cross and this modified cross,\r\nwith the arms bent each half-way along its length to form a right\r\nangle, would be very natural things for a primitive man–or a child–to\r\nmake when trying to produce some ornamental effect by tracing simple\r\nrectilinear and symmetrical figures. No doubt such a \"playing with\r\nlines\" is a common phase or stage of the human search for decorative\r\ndesign. It leads by gradual steps to very complex line-decoration in\r\nearly pottery and woven work, which is sometimes called \"geometrical\r\ndesign.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the fact, and a very interesting one, that the\r\ntendency to make geometrical design is not so pronounced in the very\r\nearliest examples of human drawing and ornament known to us, as is\r\nthe tendency to copy natural objects. And this would appear to be\r\nespecially the case where the drawing is to be a symbol or significant\r\nbadge. In the earliest art-work known to us–that of the cave-men of\r\nthe late Pleistocene period in Western Europe (see Chaps. I., II.\r\nand III.)–the artists were busy with attempts (often wonderfully\r\nsuccessful ones) to present the outlines of familiar animals (and\r\nsometimes plants) by incised carving on bone or painting on the rock\r\nwalls of caves–preceded, it is true, by a period in which \"all-round\"\r\nsculpture in bone or stone or modelling in clay was the method\r\nemployed. The extensive use of lines–concentric or parallel, like\r\nthose on the finger-tips–as decoration of stone work is not known\r\nuntil the later or Neolithic period.[7] On one at least of the incised\r\nbone drawings of the Palæolithic cave-men two little diamond-shaped\r\nlozenges are engraved. They are seen in the cave-men's drawing of a\r\nstag figured on pp. 12, 13 of this book. These lozenges are supposed to\r\nbe the \"signature\" of the artist, and, if so, are not only the first\r\nexamples of a geometrical rectilinear figure as ornament, but the\r\nearliest examples known of the use of a badge or symbol as a means of\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the simpler decorative designs made use of by the\r\nless cultivated races of men, we find that there are certain distinct\r\nand opposed tendencies the predominance of which is of importance\r\nin helping us to explain the origin of the design. The tendency to\r\nmake straight lines and rectilinear angles, which we may call the\r\n\"rectilinear habit,\" is found in work executed on hard stone by a\r\ngraving tool, and in work where square-cut stones are set together or\r\nflat pieces of wood or straw are interlaced, and in coarser kinds of\r\nweaving, bead-work, and basketwork. The opposite tendency is found in\r\nwork executed with a brush and fluid paint on pottery or cloth, or even\r\nwith a graver on soft clay or bone.\r\n\r\nThe contrast is well shown in the two renderings of one and the same\r\n\"pattern,\" shown in A and B of Fig. 49. A is the rectilinear angular\r\ndecorative design which is known as the \"Greek key pattern,\" whilst the\r\nscroll below it is the \"curvilinear\" treatment of the same subject.\r\nThe first takes its rectilinear character from a structure built up of\r\nhard blocklike pieces; the other is the flowing, easily moving line of\r\na brush laying on paint, or of a style moving over clay or soft wax.\r\nThe contrast is the same as that of the capital letters of the Roman\r\nalphabet, as used in print, with their equivalents in \"copper-plate,\"\r\ncursive handwriting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.–The Greek Key pattern in _A_ rectangular, and\r\n_B_ curvilinear or \"current\" form.]\r\n\r\nAnother pair of tendencies opposed to each other which have much\r\nsignificance in the explanation of decorative design is the tendency\r\nto convert the simple lines of an original design into a drawing\r\nrepresenting some animal or plant shape. At the end of the last chapter\r\nI distinguished this as the \"naturalizing\" tendency, contrasting it\r\nwith the grammatizing or simplifying tendency. A good example of it\r\nis seen in Fig. 50. In A of that figure we see a circle divided into\r\nthree cones by curved lines; this is a known design. It is called a\r\n\"triskelion\" (meaning a three-legged figure), or is more correctly\r\ntermed \"a three-branched scroll.\" The curves are converted into angles\r\nand straight lines in B, and then the stiff rectilinear \"triskelion\"\r\nis subsequently developed into three human legs, as shown in C, Fig.\r\n50. It is naturalized. Were the change to proceed in the other way from\r\nthe three human legs to the simple lines, we should have an example of\r\nthe opposed tendency, namely, that of converting drawings of natural\r\nobjects–by a degenerative or reducing process–to the simplest lines\r\nrepresentative of them. This tendency, which we call \"grammatizing\"\r\n(from gramma, the Greek for a line), is far commoner in early art than\r\nthe naturalizing tendency which sets in when the artist is exuberant,\r\nself-confident, and imaginative. We see a \"naturalizing\" tendency\r\nin the flamboyant and arabesque decorative work of the renascence,\r\nbut it is also found among the happy Minoan, or Ægæan, island folk\r\nwho decorated great pots and basins in Cyprus and Crete with forms\r\nsuggested by birds, sea-creatures, and climbing plants, and worshipped\r\nthe great mother Nature as Aphrodite, the sea-born goddess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.–Diagrams of the \"triskelion\" or figure formed\r\nby the division of a circle into three equal bent cones as in _A_. _B_\r\nis the rectangular form derived from it. _C_ is a \"naturalized\" form\r\nderived from it, namely, the three conjoined legs used as the badge of\r\nSicily and of the Isle of Man.]\r\n\r\nThe triangular island of Sicily (called also Trinacria) had in ancient\r\ntimes (even as far back as 300 B.C.) the conjoined three legs (shown\r\nin Fig. 50, C) as its badge or armorial emblem. An ancient Greek vase\r\nfound at Girgenti has this badge painted on it. Ancient Lycia had a\r\ntriskelion formed by three conjoined cocks' heads stamped on its coins.\r\nThough it has no direct connection with the Swastika, the introduction\r\nof the \"three legs\" as the armorial emblem of the Isle of Man is worth\r\nrelating, as it is not known to most of those who are familiar with\r\nthe device, with its motto, \"Quocunque jeceris stabit\" on the copper\r\npence minted for that island up to as late a date as 1864, and current\r\nin Great Britain. King Alexander III of Scotland expelled the Norse\r\nVikings from the Isle of Man in A.D. 1266, and substituted for their\r\narmorial emblem in the island, which was a ship under full sail, the\r\nthree legs of Sicily. Frederick II, King of Sicily, married Isabella,\r\nthe daughter of Henry III of England. Alexander III of Scotland married\r\nMargaret, another daughter of Henry, and Henry's son, Edmund the\r\nHunchback, became King of Sicily, in succession to his brother-in-law\r\nFrederick. Alexander of Scotland was thus brother-in-law both of\r\nFrederick II and of Edmund, successive kings of Sicily. It was in this\r\nway that he was led, when he added the Isle of Man to his kingdom, to\r\nreplace the former Norse emblem of the island by the picturesque and\r\nstriking device of that other island–Sicily–with which he had so close\r\na family connection.\r\n\r\nThe tendency for drawings of men and animals when used as decorative\r\ndesigns to degenerate, in the course of time and repetition, into\r\nmore and more simple lines, to become more and more \"grammatized\"\r\nand simplified, till at last their origin is hardly recognizable,\r\nis both a very remarkable and a very usual thing. The process of\r\ndegeneration, step by step, can often be traced, and curious remnants\r\nof important parts of the original drawing are found surviving in the\r\nfinal simplified design. The paddles and other carvings of some of the\r\nSouth Sea Islanders show very curious \"degenerations\" of this kind.\r\nA carved human head with open mouth becomes by repeated copying and\r\nsimplification a mere crescent or hook, which is the vastly enlarged\r\nmouth of the original face. It alone survives, and is of enormous\r\nsize, when all other features and detail have been abandoned. In some\r\ncarvings of a face the tongue is shown projecting as an indication of\r\ndefiance. In course of simplification in successive reproductions the\r\nface becomes a mere curved surface with a large pointed piece standing\r\nout from it; it is the tongue. That one significant thing–suggesting\r\ndefiance–alone persists. The study of this process in human art\r\ncovers a very wide field, including all races and all times. An\r\nexcellent example is that given in Fig. 51. It shows the step by step\r\n\"grammatizing\" of a favourite decorative drawing–that of an alligator,\r\nas painted by the Chiriqui Indians of Panama on pottery. We start in\r\nFig. 51, A, with an alligator, already considerably \"schematized\"\r\nor conventionalized. The Indians could do better than that, but it\r\nserved for pottery decoration. The figures B, C, D show three stages\r\nof further \"grammatizing\" of the design (from different parts of\r\nthe surface of a pot) till, in D, we get the alligator reduced to a\r\nyoke-like line and a dot!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.–Four stages in the simplification of a\r\ndecorative design–the Alligator–as painted on pottery by the Chiriqui\r\nIndians. (Holmes.)]\r\n\r\nFamiliar modern examples of this reduction of an animal figure to one\r\nor two lines, with mysterious-looking branches (representing limbs or\r\nhorns), are seen in the scattered devices on the Turkey carpets so\r\nlargely used at the present day. A comparison of various examples of\r\nsuch carpets of different age and locality reveals the true nature of\r\nthese queer-looking patterns as representations of animals! Another\r\nfamiliar instance of the grammatizing of an animal form is that\r\nshown in Fig. 52, D, which is the common symbol in modern European\r\nart for a flying bird. Fig. 52 shows, however, some more important\r\nsimplifications of animal form. The series marked E are a few examples\r\nfrom hundreds painted on the walls of caves in Cantabria (Spain) by\r\nprehistoric men. They start with a clearly recognizable figure of\r\na man–many such, an inch or two high, occur on some parts of the\r\ncave-walls–and then we have all sorts of simplifications and deviations\r\nfrom the more naturalistic initial design, as shown by the rest of the\r\nseries, ending in a T–a primitive symbol often arrived at by savage\r\ndecorative artists in various parts of the world by reducing and\r\ngrammatizing the human figure. The letters of many alphabets have been\r\nsimplified in this way from original picture-like signs or pictographs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.–Simplification (grammatizing) of decorative\r\ndesign. _A_, a stork walking. _B_, a stag. _C_, a stork with wings\r\nspread for flying–resulting when fully \"grammatized\" in a curvilinear\r\nswastika. _A_, _B_, and _C_, from spindle-whorls found at Hissarlik.\r\n_D_, conventional representation of three flying birds. _E_,\r\ngrammatized human figure from the walls of caverns in Cantabria.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.–Spindle-whorl from Troy (fourth city), with\r\nthree swastikas–two resembling \"stylized\" storks (see Fig. 52, C).\r\n(Schliemann.)]\r\n\r\nThe drawings lettered A, B and C in Fig. 52 represent accurately\r\nfigures scratched on the clay \"spindle-whorls\" (before baking), so\r\nabundant in the remains of the ancient cities on the hill of Hissarlik\r\n(Troy), found by Schliemann (see Figs. 42 and 53). These heavy,\r\nbun-like spindle-whorls have retained their use and shape since\r\nNeolithic times (they are found in the Swiss lake-dwellings) to the\r\npresent day. Similar whorls were made of modern porcelain, variously\r\ndecorated, in France in the last century and sold to the peasants for\r\ngiving weight and rotatory stability to the spindle used in spinning,\r\nand are still used wherever the spindle survives, as among the Indians\r\nof Central America. A \"grammatized\" profile representation of a stork\r\n(Fig. 52, A) is one of the designs on these Hissarlik spindle-whorls,\r\nand so is the linear representation of a stag (Fig. 52, B). And now we\r\ncome back to the Swastika. The four figures in a row, marked C in Fig.\r\n52, are a few of the representations of \"flying\" storks on these same\r\nspindle-whorls; one so marked is drawn in Fig. 53. They are of various\r\ndegrees of simplification, and the last but one on the right hand side\r\nis identical with a Swastika! It must be carefully remembered that\r\nthese clay spindle-whorls from Hissarlik are very commonly inscribed\r\nwith undoubted well-shaped Swastikas, as shown in Fig. 42. The Swastika\r\nis quite a common and usual decorative lucky badge in the household art\r\nof that locality and age. Hence it is not surprising that M. Solomon\r\nReinach, of Paris, has suggested that the Swastika may have originated\r\nthus–by the \"stylizing\" or \"grammatizing\" of a favourite and sacred\r\nbird–the stork. Once thus suggested and drawn in the simple Swastika\r\nshape the emblem (it would be supposed) became fixed, and made as\r\nrectilinear and simple as possible. Thenceforward it was accepted as an\r\nemblem of good luck, which has been transmitted throughout the ancient\r\nworld of Europe, Asia and America. This theory has a plausible aspect,\r\nbut I understand from M. Reinach that he no longer attaches importance\r\nto it. I do not know what theory, if any, of the origin of the Swastika\r\nnow commends itself to him, nor whether he thinks it has originated\r\nindependently in several times and places, or holds that it has one\r\ncommon origin. I am inclined to favour the theory that the Swastika\r\nhas been started by the copying of the form of a natural object on the\r\npart of a primitive race of men, and that this form has lent itself to\r\nthe invention of other badges and symbols besides that known as the\r\nSwastika. I will explain this in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[7] But spiral and leaf-like decorative designs engraved on bone (see\r\nFig. 29, p. 54) are found in caves associated with other carvings made\r\nby cave-men of the Reindeer or late Palæolithic period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE TOMOYE AND THE SWASTIKA\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.–The \"Tomoye\"–the Japanese badge of triumph.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.–Symbols of the history of the universe used by\r\nthe ancient Chinese philosopher Chu-Hsi. _A_, The original \"void.\" _B_,\r\nThe great monad. _C_, The monad divides into two, male and female. _D_,\r\nThe halves in rotatory movement, suggested by the S-like bending of the\r\ndividing line or diameter of the circle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.–Diagrams to show the possible derivation of the\r\nswastika from the inscription of two S-like lines (or \"ogees\") within a\r\ncircle so as to divide the circle into four bent cones. _B_ and _C_ are\r\nogee and rectangular swastikas easily produced by modification of the\r\nencircled figure.]\r\n\r\nFig. 54 represents a remarkable design which is a sort of national\r\nemblem, a universally accepted badge of triumph and honour in Japan,\r\nand is called \"Tomoye\"–meaning \"triumph.\" The black and white portions\r\nare in that country painted respectively red and yellow. It is simply\r\na circle divided into two equal cone-like figures by the inscription\r\nwithin it of a doubly-curved line like the letter S. Where and how did\r\nthe Japanese get this badge? Who invented it, or from what natural\r\nobject is it copied? A modified Tomoye with the cones dislocated is\r\nused as the national flag of Korea. A single one of these curious,\r\ntapering, one-sided cones is closely similar to the cone-like figures\r\nsometimes called \"pines\" which one sees on Indian shawls. The origin\r\nof these is sometimes said to be a copying of some fruit or vegetable\r\ngrowth, but is really not ascertained–and is possibly half of a Tomoye!\r\nA great circular altar-stone has been found in Central America, 5 ft.\r\nacross, divided by a deep S-shaped groove into two equal one-sided\r\ncones (Fig. 59) like the Tomoye. The figure formed by an S within a\r\ncircle is found in the writings of the ancient Chinese philosopher\r\nChu-Hsi. He gives a series of symbols representing (according to\r\nhim) the history of the universe. They are shown in Fig. 55, and are\r\nexplained as follows. The empty circle A represents the original\r\n\"void\"–the boundary line is conventional. After untold æons the great\r\nmonad appeared. It is represented by B. Then we get the division of\r\nthe great monad (now called \"Tai-I\") into two, shown in C of our\r\nFig. 55–singularly recalling the division of the nucleated cell or\r\nprotoplasmic unit of animal and vegetable structure. The two halves,\r\nhowever, in this case represent the feminine called \"Yin\" and the\r\nmasculine called \"Yang.\" The last drawing, D of Fig. 55, shows the\r\nYin and the Yang in rotatory motion. This is indicated by the S-like\r\nbending of the diameter, and the consequent formation of a figure like\r\nthe Tomoye. By this motion the visible universe is supposed–by the\r\nphilosopher Chu-Hsi–to be produced. The figure marked D is described\r\nas a \"cosmological symbol.\" It does not help us to the origin of the\r\nfigure showing the division of the circle as in the Tomoye, for it\r\ndates only from about the twelfth century of our era.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose the circle divided, as in the Tomoye, to be a very\r\nancient badge or device, dating from prehistoric man, then it is\r\nprobably derived from a natural object. And this object was probably\r\na ground-down transverse section across a whelk-shell, for if one\r\nmakes such a section just above the mouth of the shell at right angles\r\nto its length, one gets two adjacent chambers of the spirally-coiled\r\nshell separated by an S-like partition, the resulting figure given\r\nby the slice across the shell being that of the \"tomoye,\" with its\r\npaired, one-sided, cone-like constituents. Shells are amongst the\r\nchief ornaments used by prehistoric and modern savage man. Large\r\nones are ground down to make armlets. The perception of the spiral\r\nas a decorative line is almost certainly due to the handling and\r\ngrinding-down of snail shells, and, indeed, we find spirals and\r\nreversed spiral scrolls engraved on bone by the Pleistocene cave-men\r\n(see Fig. 29).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.–Terra-cotta cone with a seven-armed sun-like\r\nfigure engraving on it. Troy. (Schliemann.)]\r\n\r\nThe Ægæan people of the Greek islands (of whom the Mykenæans are\r\na part) copied a variety of forms of marine animals in their\r\ndecorations of pottery, and, in fact, natural shapes were the basis\r\nof their decorative art. They simplified and \"grammatized\" their more\r\nnature-true designs into badges and symbols.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.–Scalloped Shell Disk, from a mound near\r\nNashville, Tennessee, showing in the centre a tetraskelion with four\r\ncurved arms, about four inches in diameter, made of polished shell.\r\n(Peabody Museum.)]\r\n\r\nWe find in early work discovered in the ancient mounds of North America\r\ndecorative circles (Fig. 58) in which two S-like lines at right angles\r\nto one another are inscribed as shown in Fig. 56, and we find also\r\nthat these curved rays may be prolonged as a marvellous enveloping\r\nspiral coil or helix–especially in the painting of pottery. When the\r\ncurved rays are many in number, as in Fig. 57, the design has been\r\ninterpreted by some archæologists as symbolizing the sun, and it is\r\nimportant to remember that the Swastika itself was used in China as\r\nthe pictograph of the sun. A single curved S-like line has been found\r\ncut on a great circular slab, an ancient altar-stone (Fig. 59) in\r\nHonduras (Copan)–so as to divide the circle as is done in the Japanese\r\nTomoye. It is obvious that the exact geometric character of the S-like\r\ndivision is of great significance in these designs and requires careful\r\nstudy and explanation. I have briefly discussed this matter at the\r\nend of the chapter. In the common \"ogee Swastika,\" Fig. 56, B, the\r\nmore or less elaborately helicoid arms are merely careless flourishes\r\nof the painter's brush. The simple four-rayed figure, shown in Fig.\r\n56, A, is often spoken of as a \"tetraskelion,\" or four-legged scroll,\r\nand is associated with the three-legged figure or triskelion which I\r\nwrote of in the last chapter. If the curvilinear \"tetraskelion\" be\r\nangularized–that is to say, rectangles substituted for semicircles,\r\nwe get the correct fully developed Swastika, Fig. 56, C. And if,\r\nabandoning the circle, the draughtsman rapidly drew with a brush or on\r\nsoft clay lines like an S crossing one another at right angles, he\r\nproduced what is common enough wherever the more formal rectangular\r\nSwastika is found, namely, the curvilinear or \"ogee Swastika,\" Fig. 56,\r\nB.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible with our present knowledge to penetrate into\r\nthe remote past and really ascertain the origin of the shape or\r\ndevice called a Swastika. But it is, I think, quite likely that in\r\nmanipulating the \"tomoye\" symbol (whether copied from a section of\r\nshell or originating by more independent invention and \"trying\"\r\nof lines and curves and circles), very early man duplicated the\r\nsymmetrical S by which he had divided a circle and produced the\r\ntetraskelion seen in Fig. 56, A. The conversion of this into the\r\nrectangular Swastika and into varieties of the ogee and menander (which\r\nI have not found space to describe) would be an easy and natural\r\nsequence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.–An altar-stone of prehistoric age. The circular\r\nsurface is cut into by a trough of S-shape, which divides it so as to\r\nresemble the Japanese \"Tomoye.\" From Copan, Honduras.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I have no conviction that this is the real origin of\r\nthe Swastika, and await further evidence. The \"flying-stork theory,\"\r\nwhich was put forward by Reinach, is very attractive. Birds as badges\r\nand \"totems\" are frequent among primitive mankind, and certain species\r\nare often regarded as sacred and bringing good luck. The stork is one\r\nof these. If the artists who marked the very ancient clay-pottery of\r\nHissarlik with the Swastika and also with outlines of the flying stork,\r\nstrongly resembling a Swastika, did not derive the Swastika from the\r\nstork, but had received it from some independent source, then it is\r\nprobable that they purposely drew the flying stork, so as to make it\r\nresemble as much as possible a Swastika.\r\n\r\nWhen we take account of the apparently arbitrary passage of human\r\ndecorative design from the naturalistic to the linear, and from the\r\nlinear to the naturalistic; from the curvilinear to the rectilinear,\r\nand from rectilinear to curvilinear; when we also reflect that some\r\nraces and populations of men have been prone to seek for the forms\r\nof their decoration in the natural forms of plants and animals,\r\nwhilst others have made use of mere mechanical patterns of parallel\r\nor interlacing lines, we must conclude that by the appeal to one or\r\nother of these various tendencies it is easy to invent a large variety\r\nof more or less plausible theories as to the origin of the Swastika.\r\nThe truth of the matter can only be decided, if ever, by more direct\r\nand conclusive evidence than we at present possess. Nevertheless, it\r\nis a legitimate and fascinating thing to speculate on the origin of\r\nthis wonderful world-pervading emblem coming to us from the mists of\r\nprehistoric ages, and to endeavour to arrive, if possible, at possible\r\npoints of contact between it and other \"devices\" and \"symbols,\" even\r\nthough they may be of equally obscure birth.[8]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.]\r\n\r\nThe accurate division of a circle into two equal comma-shaped areas\r\nof the special shape presented by the \"Tomoye\" of the Japanese (Fig.\r\n54) and the rotating \"Great Monad\" of Chinese cosmogony (Fig. 55),\r\nis effected by describing within a given circle two circles each\r\nhaving its diameter equal to a radius of the enclosing circle. The\r\ntwo inscribed circles touch one another at the centre of the latter,\r\nbut do not overlap. The area of the enclosing circle is thus divided\r\ninto four areas, _a_, _b_, _c_ and _d_ (see Fig. 60, A). The areas\r\n_a_, _b_ are the two inscribed circles. Each of the residual areas\r\n_c_, _d_ is called (as Sir Thos. Heath, F.R.S., kindly informs me) an\r\n\"arbelus\" by ancient Greek geometricians–a name used for a rounded\r\nknife used by shoemakers. The comma-shaped bent cone or pine is\r\nformed by the fusion of one of the two small circles with one of the\r\nadjacent arbeli (Fig. 60, B). The figure so formed which to-day is\r\nloosely spoken of as a \"bent cone,\" a \"pine,\" or a \"comma,\" has never,\r\nso far as I can ascertain, received a name in geometry, nor in the\r\nlanguage of decorative design or pattern-making. Nor has the S-like\r\nline made by the two semicircles separating the contiguous \"pines\"\r\nor \"commas\" received any designation though vaguely indicated by\r\nthe word \"ogee.\" The comma-like areas might conveniently be called\r\n\"streptocones,\" and their S-like boundary \"a hemicyclic sigmoid.\" As\r\nshown in Fig. 56, by drawing a second hemicyclic sigmoid of the same\r\ndimensions at right angles to the first, the circle is divided into\r\nfour smaller streptocones. By using sigmoids or half-sigmoids of a\r\ncurvature of a different order from that of the hemicyclic one, but\r\nof a precisely defined nature, the circle may be divided into three,\r\nsix, eight or more equal \"streptocones\" of graceful proportions, some\r\nof which have been used either in series as borders in metal work\r\n(for circular dishes and goblets) or as detached or grouped elements\r\nin pattern-designs (stone-work tracery, embroidery, woven and printed\r\nfabrics).\r\n\r\nApart from this development of the \"streptocone\" as an important\r\nfeature in decorative work, it is not without interest in connection\r\nwith the probable importance and significance of the Japanese double\r\nstreptocone, as we may call the Tomoye, to note some of its geometrical\r\nfeatures. Referring to the Fig. 60, it is obvious that each of the\r\npaired streptocones is equal in area to half the enclosing circle,\r\nalso that each of the two inscribed circles (_a_, _b_) has an area of\r\none-fourth of that of the enclosing circle–and that each arbelus (_c_,\r\n_d_) has also an area one-fourth that of the enclosing circle and is\r\nequal in area to each of the inscribed circles (_a_, _b_). Each of the\r\ntwo constituent \"streptocones\" is made up of a _complete_ circle capped\r\nby an \"arbelus\" equal in area to it (namely, one-quarter of that of\r\nthe big circle). It is obvious that the area of the arbelus formed in\r\na semicircle by two enclosed semicircles which are contiguous and of\r\nequal base as in Fig. 60, is equal to that of a circle the diameter\r\nof which is the vertical line drawn from the apex of the arbelus to\r\nthe arc of the semicircle (Fig 60). This is true whether the enclosed\r\ncontiguous semicircles have chords of equal or unequal length (Fig.\r\n60). This fact was known to the Greek geometricians, as I am informed\r\nby Sir Thos. Heath.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[8] I am indebted for the figures (not the diagrams) illustrating\r\nChapters XVII., XVIII., XIX. to the report by Mr. Thomas Wilson on the\r\nSwastika–in the Smithsonian Reports, 1894. Those interested in this\r\nsubject will find a vast store of information in that report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nCOAL\r\n\r\n\r\nCoal is so much \"a matter of course\" in our daily life that most people\r\nare only now, when its supply is becoming precarious, anxious to know\r\nsomething of its nature and history. By the word \"coal,\" or \"coles,\"\r\nour ancestors understood what we now distinguish as \"charcoal,\"\r\nprepared from wood by the \"charcoal-burner,\" or \"charbonnier,\" as\r\nthe French call him. What we now call \"coal\" was known to them as\r\n\"sea-coal,\" and, later, as \"black\" or \"stone cole,\" to distinguish it\r\nfrom \"brown coal,\" known nowadays as \"lignite,\" though the name \"stone\r\ncoal\" is locally applied in England to that very hard kind of black\r\ncoal also called \"anthracite,\" of which jet is only an extremely hard\r\nand dense variety found in small quantities in the oolitic strata of\r\nWhitby, Spain, and other localities.\r\n\r\nIt is on record that in the year 1306 a citizen of London was tried,\r\ncondemned, and executed for burning \"sea-coal.\" This severe treatment\r\nwas held to be justified by the poisonous and otherwise injurious\r\nnature of the smoke produced by fires of sea-coal. I have not met with\r\nany records of the earliest digging for and trade in \"sea-coal,\" but\r\npresumably it was obtained near the coast in the North of England and\r\nbrought to London by ship–hence its name. The coal-trade of Newcastle\r\nbegan in the thirteenth century, but, owing to an Act of Parliament\r\nin the reign of Edward I forbidding the use of sea-coal in London,\r\ndid not become important until the seventeenth century. It came very\r\ngradually into use, and we find that Evelyn (the diarist) in 1661\r\nnoted the withering and bad condition of rose-bushes and other plants\r\nin London gardens, which he attributed to the pestilential action\r\nof the smoke given off by the newly introduced \"sea-coal\" which was\r\nincreasingly used as fuel in London houses. The sea-coal was not yet\r\nlargely, if at all, used in the production of iron; and Evelyn as a\r\nforest-owner and lover of trees, has much to say about the necessity\r\nfor attention to the cultivation of our forests in connection with the\r\niron industry which then flourished in the Weald of Sussex; charcoal\r\nprocured by the slow burning or roasting of wood being the fuel used\r\nin the smelting furnaces, whilst the ore was the orange-brown wealden\r\nsand. It was during the eighteenth century that what we now call simply\r\n\"coal\" came rapidly into use–not only for domestic heating, but for\r\nfurnaces of all kinds employed in industrial enterprise, and, at a\r\nlater date, for the earlier and later forms of steam-engines. The smoke\r\nof the new coal was everywhere regarded as a terrible nuisance, and\r\na source of injury to both animal and vegetable life. The poisonous\r\naction of coal-smoke is not due to the finely divided black particles\r\nof carbon of which it largely consists, but to the sulphuric acid\r\nderived from the small quantities of sulphur present in coal. It is\r\ncalculated that more than sixteen million tons of coal are annually\r\nused in London alone for heating purposes, and that 480,000 tons of\r\nblack carbon powder are discharged over London by its chimneys every\r\nyear, together with very nearly the same weight of poisonous sulphuric\r\nacid!\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is this \"sea-coal\" or \"coal\" of our modern life? We all\r\nknow its black, glistening appearance, and more or less friable\r\ncharacter. Its nature and origin are best conveyed by the statement\r\nthat it is very ancient \"peat,\" compressed and naturally changed by\r\nchemical action and retaining little or no trace of its original\r\nstructure. Peat, as we know it from the low land of English and French\r\nriver valleys and the bogs of Scotland and Ireland, is formed by the\r\nannual growth and death of \"mosses\" of several kinds and of other\r\naccompanying vegetation. It retains the woody forms of the vegetable\r\ngrowths which constitute it, and they are often but loosely adherent to\r\none another. Peat may be merely a growth of the past five years, but is\r\nsometimes many thousand years old. Older than peat, and more caked and\r\ncompressed, is lignite, or brown coal, which occurs on the Continent of\r\nEurope, also in South Devon and elsewhere, in geological strata newer\r\nthan those which yield our black coal. Then we have the most important\r\nclass of black coals which are known as \"bituminous coals,\" because\r\nthey soften when heated and form hydrocarbons of both viscid and\r\ngaseous nature. They are used for domestic purposes, and wherever flame\r\nis desired. They are, in fact, the \"lumps of coal\" familiar in our\r\nscuttles. The \"bituminous coal\" with the greatest amount of hydrogen\r\nin it is the cannel or candle coal, so called from its bright flame\r\nwhen burning. This kind is especially valuable for gas-making, and of\r\nsmaller value as fuel. The term \"anthracite\" is reserved for a hard,\r\nstone-like coal which is very nearly pure carbon (ninety per cent).\r\nThis class of coal burns with a very small amount of flame, gives\r\nintense heat, and no smoke. It is used in drying malt and hops.\r\n\r\nLike all woody matter, that from which peat is formed consists of a\r\ncombination of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen; and these\r\nremain in somewhat changed chemical union in the brown coal, bituminous\r\ncoal, and anthracite. The carbon and a varying and small proportion of\r\nthe original hydrogen of the woody peat, are the important elements in\r\ncoal; and we may well ask how they come to be produced as a black or\r\ndark brown mass from dead vegetable growths which are often bleached\r\nand colourless. It is true that vegetable refuse does not necessarily\r\nblacken when left to itself. We know that by roasting or charring wood\r\n(or animals' flesh or bone) we can drive off the elements oxygen and\r\nhydrogen and nitrogen (if there), and obtain a black mass of carbon\r\n(so-called charcoal). That blackness is the actual true tint of carbon.\r\nThe dead weeds and leaves at the bottom of a stagnant pond break down\r\nand form a pitch-black mud. They would not, and do not, go black\r\nif exposed to the oxygen of the atmosphere; but at the bottom of a\r\nstagnant pond or in a refuse heap they are excluded from the air, and\r\na microbe–a bacterium which has been carefully studied, and is of a\r\nkind which can only flourish in the absence of free oxygen–attacks the\r\ndead weeds, producing by change of their substance marsh-gas and black\r\ncarbon, the black mud emitting bubbles of gas which one may stir up\r\nwith a pole in such a pond. This chemical attack by anaërobic bacteria\r\ngoes on in the deeper layers of all marshes and stagnant pools, remote\r\nfrom the oxygen of the air; and it is fairly certain that the black\r\ncoal which we find in strata of great geological age was so produced\r\nby the action of special kinds of bacteria upon peat-like masses of\r\nvegetable refuse. Indeed, by studying microscopic sections of coal,\r\nnumerous forms of bacteria have been recognized which might be capable\r\nof effecting such chemical changes. On the other hand, we must remember\r\nthat it is not possible to conclude by form alone as to what subtle\r\nchemical work a bacterium or bacillus or micro-coccus may be, or may\r\nhave been, carrying on. The peat-like deposits which became carbonized\r\nand so formed the \"coal\" were probably masses of algæ, mosses and soft\r\naquatic plants, which were brought down and accumulated in swampy,\r\nforest-covered ground about the mouths of rivers, the deposit being\r\ncovered in owing to rapid oscillations of level by beds of sand or\r\nclay, followed by new growth and deposit.\r\n\r\nOur British coal and a good deal of foreign coal is found in certain\r\nstratified rocks of the earth's crust known as \"the Carboniferous\r\nSystem,\" about 12,000 ft. thick, consisting chiefly of very dense\r\nlimestone. The \"seams,\" or stratified beds of coal, occur in sandy\r\nrock known as the \"Coal Measures,\" and vary in thickness from a mere\r\nfilm to 40 ft. Above the Carboniferous System are later deposits, some\r\n14,000 ft. in thickness–the Permian, Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous,\r\nand Tertiary strata. Below them we find stratified deposits containing\r\nfossilized remains of plants and animals, to a depth of another 40,000\r\nft.: they are the Devonian, Silurian, and Cambrian \"systems\" or series\r\nof strata. Coal of a workable nature is found in many parts of the\r\nworld in the beds or strata of later age than our Coal Measures–namely,\r\nthose of Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary age.\r\n\r\nCoal is so valuable and used in such vast quantities by modern man\r\nthat, though procured at first from beds lying at or near the surface,\r\nit has been found remunerative to mine far into the depths of the\r\nearth's surface, where its existence is ascertained, in order to\r\nprocure it. A depth of 4000 ft. is apparently the limit set to such\r\nmining by the increase of temperature in mines which penetrate to\r\nthat extent below the surface. In 1905 the annual output of British\r\ncoal-mines was in round numbers 230,000,000 tons. It is certain that\r\nthere is a limit to this production, but not possible to calculate what\r\nthat limit may be, owing to the uncertainty as to the future working of\r\ncoal-fields as yet unexplored.\r\n\r\nSuch questions have been, and are being, considered by experts on\r\nbehalf of the Government. A matter of interest of another kind is\r\nthat in and associated with the coal seams of our Coal Measures,\r\nfossilized remains of peculiar fern-like trees, ferns, and other\r\nstrange plants, and of very peculiar, extinct newt-like animals (as\r\nlarge as crocodiles) are found in great variety. The notion that the\r\ntoads occasionally found embedded in the black mud of a coal-yard or\r\neven in a fractured lump of coal are survivals from the time–many\r\nmillions of years past–when the plants and animals of the Coal Measure\r\nswamps were living, is a baseless fancy. The toads so found are of the\r\nkind or species now living on the earth–totally different from those\r\nwhose bones occur in the Coal Measures, and the presence of such modern\r\ntoads embedded in black slime, in coal-heaps in store-yards, or even in\r\ncoal-scuttles, is only what may be expected to occur and does occur in\r\ndamp quarries and other places where these familiar little beasts love\r\nto hide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nBORING FOR OIL\r\n\r\n\r\nClosely similar to coal in chemical matter–that is to say, consisting\r\nchiefly of definite chemical compounds, called hydrocarbons, built\r\nup of only two elements, carbon and hydrogen, and of no other–is a\r\nvery remarkable class of mineral substances known to the ancients\r\nas \"bitumen.\" In its widest sense, it includes \"natural gas,\" the\r\nvariously mixed liquids called \"petroleum\" and the solid \"asphalts.\"\r\nIn ancient times the more fluid kinds of petroleum issuing from the\r\nground in South Russia and Persia were called \"naphtha,\" and that\r\nname is still applied to the more volatile hydrocarbons obtained by\r\nthe distillation of such substances as coal-tar (the residue of the\r\nextraction by heat of commercial gas from coal), bituminous shale,\r\npetroleum, wood and some other bodies which owe their existence to the\r\nactivity either of living or of long-extinct and \"fossilized\" plants\r\nand animals.\r\n\r\nThe bitumens, together with coal, present in their natural state a\r\nvery large variety of inflammable constituents–gaseous, liquid, and\r\nsolid hydrocarbons; but, when \"distilled\" at various temperatures and\r\nunder conditions determined by the manufacturing chemist, they yield a\r\nstill larger series of pure separable bodies, which have been minutely\r\nstudied and classified according to their chemical constitution.\r\nThey are produced in great chemical factories in large quantities\r\nfor use in the most diverse ways invented by human ingenuity. Thus\r\nnatural gas–superseded by distilled coal-gas–has served for fuel and\r\nfor illumination: refined petroleum serves not only for those uses\r\nin general, but as the special source of power in the engines of\r\nmotor-cars and aeroplanes. A wonderful solid crystalline wax-like\r\nsubstance, paraffin, as white as snow, is distilled in enormous\r\nquantities (nearly three million tons a year) from \"bituminous\r\nshale\" or \"oil-shale\" in this country alone. It can be obtained in\r\nsoft (vaseline) and liquid forms, and in fact the \"paraffin series\"\r\nrecognized by chemists starts from the gas \"methane,\" or marsh-gas,\r\nand comprises some thirty kinds, leading from gas to volatile liquids,\r\nthence to viscid liquids, to butter-like solids, and up to hard\r\ncrystalline substances which melt only at the temperature of boiling\r\nwater. Endless chemical manufacturing industries–_e.g._, those of\r\ndye-stuffs and explosives–depend upon the chemical treatment of these\r\nparaffins and of various bodies obtained as secondary products in their\r\npreparation. Benzine and aniline are chiefly obtained from coal-tar.\r\nThe oils and waxes of quasi-mineral origin have a great advantage over\r\nvegetable and animal oils in many uses, since they are not liable to\r\nbecome \"rancid\"; that is to say, to decompose owing to the action on\r\nthem of bacteria. A marked difference between the paraffins (often\r\ndistinguished, together with the \"olefines,\" as \"mineral\" oils) and the\r\noils and fats found in living plants and animals is that they do not\r\n\"saponify\"; that is to say, they do not form those combinations with\r\nalkalis and other bases which are called \"soaps,\" nor can they serve as\r\nfood to man or any other animal. They are not acted on by the digestive\r\njuices.\r\n\r\nFrom ancient times natural deposits or outpourings of \"bitumens\"\r\nhave been known and used by mankind. The Assyrians and other early\r\npeoples of the East used \"asphalt\" (translated by the word \"slime\"\r\nin the English version of the Bible) in place of calcareous mortar\r\nin building; and to this day it is used largely in this country as a\r\n\"damp-course\" in walls built of brick. Great deposits of asphalt are\r\nfound in Central America and some of the West Indian islands, and\r\n\"quarried\" for commercial purposes. The great pitch-lake of Trinidad\r\nyields an abundant supply. In the Val de Travers, in the Canton of\r\nNeuchatel (Switzerland), a rich deposit is worked which, mixed with\r\nearthy material, forms a road-making concrete, largely used in London\r\nand other cities, and also for main roads in country districts. The\r\nancient Egyptians used asphalt for embalming the dead. But the ancients\r\nalso knew natural springs of liquid bitumen–that which nowadays we call\r\npetroleum–some of them freely flowing like water, which would take\r\nfire and burn for long periods, and were described as fountains of\r\n\"burning water.\" We find, as we pass from the Middle Ages to the days\r\nof geographical exploration, records of such springs of inflammable\r\noil and of natural inflammable gas in all parts of the world–Japan,\r\nChina, Burma, Persia, Galicia, Italy (Salsomaggiore), Central and North\r\nAmerica, and of not a few in these islands–for instance, in Shropshire,\r\nDerbyshire, Sussex, Kimmeridge and various sites in the southern\r\ncounties. The oil was, until the middle of the last century, valued\r\nchiefly as a medicinal application, and \"Seneca oil\" and \"American\r\nmedicinal oil\" were largely sold and used as an embrocation in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWe owe the introduction of the name \"petroleum\" to Professor Silliman,\r\nwho in 1855 reported upon the \"rock oil or petroleum\" of Venango\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania. The first attempt as a commercial enterprise\r\nto obtain rock-oil or petroleum by _boring_ into the strata in which\r\nthere was local evidence of its existence in greater or less quantity,\r\nwas made in 1854 by the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company. After some\r\nunsuccessful attempts, when the drilling had been carried to a depth\r\nof 69 ft. the tools suddenly dropped into a subterranean cavity, and\r\non the following day the well was found to have \"struck oil,\" and\r\ntwenty-five barrels a day were yielded by that well for some time. From\r\nhere the industry spread over the States and Canada, and in 1908 the\r\nyear's yield was 45,000,000 barrels.\r\n\r\nSince 1870 the industry has spread all over the globe–Russia, Galicia,\r\nRumania, Java, Borneo and Burma being prominent sources of the oil\r\nsupply of the world. The raw petroleum of different localities differs\r\nin each case in the amount of solid paraffins and olefines dissolved\r\nin the liquid paraffins. Other substances also are dissolved in it in\r\nvariable amount–such as benzene, acetylene, camphene and naphthalene.\r\nThe fact that the oil, when reached by a boring, is often found to be\r\nunder a considerable pressure, so that it rises and flows from the\r\nsurface of the well, or even may shoot up as a great fountain, is\r\nan important feature in the oil-seeking industry, though the supply\r\ndepends largely on pumping and not necessarily on natural flow. The\r\nborings when made, act like Artesian wells, and sometimes are carried\r\nto a great depth. Those in Pennsylvania vary in depth from 300 ft. to\r\n3700 ft., according to the distance below the surface at which the\r\noil-bearing strata (usually a sandstone) is situate. As in the case of\r\nan Artesian well, the boring is in the first instance an exploration\r\nsubject to uncertainty as to \"striking\" the desired liquid, but\r\nthe uncertainty is greater in the case of the search for oil than\r\nin that for water. The water-well is also far less likely to \"give\r\nout\" when once flowing than is that bored for oil, which, even if at\r\nfirst successful, may be soon exhausted owing to the small area of\r\nthe oil-bearing strata tapped. A cause of the high pressure in many\r\noil-wells is the gas which accompanies the oil. The pressure may amount\r\nto as much as 1000 lb. to the square inch. In the Northern Caucasus\r\nspouting wells caused by the high pressure of gas in the boring are\r\nfrequent. A famous fountain-well in that region, which began to flow\r\nin August 1895, threw up 4½ million gallons a day, gradually\r\ndiminishing during fifteen months until it became exhausted. At first,\r\nwhen boring was introduced, such outbursts led to an enormous loss of\r\nthe oil, for there was not sufficient means of storing or transporting\r\nit. Ordinary cartage in barrels was the earlier method; then followed\r\ntanks on railway trains and canal boats; and this has been supplemented\r\nby the use of pipes along which the oil is pumped from the well to the\r\nrefinery. In Pennsylvania there are said to be no less than 25,000\r\nmiles of such pipes in use for the distribution of petroleum.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious from what is here stated that the attempt to\r\ndiscover an oil-supply in Derbyshire must not be regarded, at present,\r\nas more than a praiseworthy and interesting enterprise. There is no\r\nroom for doubt that the best expert opinion has been brought to bear\r\non the matter. A small quantity of petroleum has already been raised;\r\nbut whether the flow will be sufficient to cover the expenses of the\r\nboring, and how long the flow may last, or how much it may amount\r\nto, are matters quite impossible to foretell. In any case, it is in\r\nthe highest degree improbable that such an abundance of oil will\r\nbe obtained as to count much, if at all, in the world's production\r\nof petroleum. It must also be remembered that products similar to\r\nthose yielded by petroleum are already extracted in quantity as a\r\nremunerative industry by the distillation of oil-shales in various\r\nparts of the United Kingdom; and that there are oil-shales in this\r\ncountry still unworked. So that we need not be in despair if we do\r\nnot tap an oil-spring of any importance close to hand. The world's\r\nsupply is still open to British enterprise. Another reflection of some\r\nimportance is that these world-wide sources of rock-oil or petroleum\r\nare likely to be exhausted by exploitation much sooner than are the\r\ncoal-fields of the world. We cannot rely on their long duration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF LIME-JUICE AND SCURVY\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom mediæval times onward a serious constitutional disease–a morbid\r\ncondition of the blood and tissues–has been known by the name \"scurvy,\"\r\nand the word \"scorbutic\" has been coined from it. It is to-day\r\npractically unknown in the ordinary conditions of civilized life, but\r\nformerly was common, and the cause of disablement and of frightful\r\nmortality in ships' crews, beleaguered cities, armies on campaign, and\r\nwar-stricken regions. It begins with a certain failure of strength.\r\nBreathlessness, exhaustion, and mental depression follow. The face\r\nlooks haggard, sallow, and dusky. After some weeks the exhaustion\r\nbecomes extreme; the gums are livid, ulcerated, and bleeding; the teeth\r\nloosen and drop out; purple spots appear on the skin; ulcers break out\r\non the limbs; effusions of blood-stained fluid take place in the great\r\ncavities of the body; profound exhaustion and coma follow; and death\r\nresults from disorganization of the lungs, kidneys, or digestive tract.\r\nIt was recognized in early times that the disease was dependent on the\r\ncharacter of the food of those attacked by it; and not the least of\r\nthe horrors accompanying it was the terror caused by the well-founded\r\nconviction that the appearance of a single case in a ship's crew or\r\nother specially circumscribed community was an unfailing index, and\r\nmeant that all were likely within a few days–owing to the enforced\r\nidentity of their food and conditions of life–to develop the disease.\r\nOften, in past centuries, a half or two-thirds of a ship's company have\r\nbeen carried off by it before a port could be reached and healthy food\r\nand conditions of life obtained. At the present moment in view of the\r\nactual condition of Europe, it is a fact of very grave importance that\r\nscurvy is known to break out and cause a terrible mortality among civil\r\ncommunities in time of scarcity–especially in prisons, workhouses, and\r\nother public institutions, which are the first to suffer deprivations\r\nwhen food is scarce.\r\n\r\nThree hundred years ago it was held that fresh vegetables and\r\nfruit-juices were both a cure for and a preventive of scurvy, or\r\n\"anti-scorbutic.\" But the fact was not appreciated by Army and\r\nAdmiralty officials that _dried_ vegetables, even of kinds which were\r\nheld to be especially \"anti-scorbutic,\" would not serve in place of\r\n_fresh_ ones. In 1720, _dried_ \"anti-scorbutic\" herbs were supplied\r\nto the Austrian Army when suffering from scurvy; but they were of no\r\navail, and thousands of the soldiers perished from the disease. A\r\nfew years later, the British Lords of the Admiralty (actuated by a\r\nspirit of blundering parsimony) proposed to supply the Navy with dried\r\nspinach, although it was well known that dried vegetables were useless\r\nagainst scurvy. In the American Civil War, 1861-1865, in spite of this\r\nknowledge, large rations of dried vegetables were supplied to the\r\narmies, and failed to prevent outbreaks of scurvy. Even at the present\r\nday so little attention has been given of late years to the subject,\r\nthat many ignorant officials, upon whose action the life of thousands\r\ndepends, regard dried vegetables as equivalent in value to fresh!\r\n\r\nA great advance was made in the second half of the eighteenth century,\r\nwhen the British Admiralty became convinced by the repeated experience\r\nof its officers that \"lime-juice\" _is_ a specific remedy and preventive\r\nfor scurvy, and, in spite of the great expense and difficulties\r\nentailed, adopted its use officially. In those days of sailing-ships,\r\nlong voyages (such as those of Captain Cook) were safely carried\r\nthrough without serious outbreak of scurvy so long as a ration of\r\nso-called \"lime-juice\" (about one ounce) was swallowed each day by each\r\nsailor. But it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\nthat the disease was practically eliminated from the Navy by the\r\nintroduction (after many foolish delays) of a general issue of what was\r\ncalled \"lime-juice.\"\r\n\r\nThe complete control and elimination of scurvy by the use of so-called\r\n\"lime-juice\" sufficed to carry us on until the introduction of steam\r\nnavigation, when it became superfluous owing to the fact that long\r\nabsence from land, where fresh food could be obtained, ceased to be\r\nusual. Moreover, after a mutiny on the part of our defrauded sailors,\r\nbetter food and greater variety of it was secured for them, and the\r\nprofits of murderous contractors were stopped.\r\n\r\nThe history of outbreaks of scurvy for the last century is practically\r\nconfined to the experiences of Arctic Expeditions and the campaigning\r\nof troops in remote or devastated regions. So little had scurvy been\r\ninvestigated, or any serious study made of the nature of the remedial\r\nand preventive action of lime-juice, that up to the year 1914 it was\r\nregarded as a matter of course that the acid, the citric acid, of\r\nlime-juice was what gave to it its virtue, and samples of lime-juice\r\nsupplied by contractors were tested solely as to the percentage of that\r\nacid present. Eminent medical authorities proposed to use crystals of\r\ncitric acid in place of the juice; others declared that vinegar would\r\ndo just as well; others, in spite of the overwhelming record as to the\r\nvalue of lime-juice, held that scurvy was due _not_ to the absence of a\r\nfood constituent–supplied by fresh vegetables and fruit-juice–but to\r\na peculiar poison present in the salted and dried meat served out as\r\nrations; others again, without any study of the disease, have expressed\r\nthe opinion that it is due to a bacterial micro-organism.\r\n\r\nA blow to the easy-going belief of the Admiralty that they had mastered\r\nand made an end of scurvy was struck when scurvy broke out (60 cases\r\namong 122 men) in the expedition to the North Pole which sailed in\r\nMay 1875 in the _Alert_ and the _Discovery_, under the command of Sir\r\nGeorge Nares. The expedition had to return prematurely after seventeen\r\nmonths' absence, and a committee was appointed to inquire into the\r\ncause of the outbreak. The stores of food and of lime-juice were shown\r\nto have been ample; and the action of the leader in equipping his\r\nsledging parties was in accordance with the judgment and experience\r\nof successful explorers who gave evidence. The cause of the outbreak\r\nremained a mystery. The firm belief in the anti-scorbutic powers of\r\n\"lime-juice\" was shaken, and this unfavourable opinion of its value has\r\nbeen confirmed by medical officers who, during the recent war, have\r\nbeen confronted by outbreaks of scurvy. These outbreaks occurred among\r\ntroops who, in military circumstances which rendered an adequate supply\r\nof fresh meat and vegetables impossible, were supplied with lime-juice\r\nprepared from the West Indian \"sour-lime.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, an experimental study of scurvy has been\r\ncarried out during the last four years by a group of workers at the\r\nLister Institute, together with a historical inquiry as to the use\r\nof lime-juice. The reports of these investigators have very great\r\npractical value and far-reaching interest, as showing what disastrous\r\nresults may arise from inaccurate use of a word, and the neglect to\r\nascertain the exact nature of the material thing upon which the issue\r\nbetween life and death may depend.\r\n\r\nHere let me say that the staff of the Lister Institute for medical\r\nresearch has done work in its laboratories in Chelsea Gardens of the\r\nvery greatest national importance during the war. It was founded by\r\npublic subscription, and has now an endowment of some £10,000 a year.\r\nSir David Bruce, the chairman of its Council, gives in the Report of\r\nthe Governing Body for 1919 a very striking summary of the work done\r\nin the laboratories and by the staff of the Institute. The successful\r\ninvestigation of trench fever and of tetanus, of the destruction of\r\nlice, and of the effects of cold storage on food, besides the study\r\nof scurvy and other diseases due to deficiency of what are now called\r\n\"_accessory food factors_,\" are, we learn, the chief matters in\r\nwhich the Lister Institute was engaged in the year 1918-19. Besides\r\nthis, however, at its farm at Elstree it has prepared and supplied\r\nto the War Office, the Admiralty, the Overseas Forces, and the Local\r\nGovernment Board more than a million doses of anti-toxins (diphtheria\r\nand tetanus), bacterial vaccines (cholera, plague, influenza), and\r\nother similar curative fluids–requiring for their safe production the\r\nhighest skill and most complete knowledge of recent discovery. And this\r\nis only a sample of what the Lister Institute has been doing for many\r\nconsecutive years.\r\n\r\nNow we return to the investigation of scurvy. Within the last ten\r\nyears the fact has been established (which was more or less guessed\r\nand acted upon by medical men of past days) that, in order to\r\nmaintain health, the diet of man and of many animals must contain\r\nnot merely the necessary quantities of meat or cheese-like bodies,\r\nof fat and starch and sugar, but also minute quantities of accessory\r\nfood-factors which it is convenient to term \"vitamines.\" The name\r\nserves (though its etymology is unsatisfactory) to indicate certain\r\n\"proteids\" or highly complex nitrogenous compounds which are only to\r\nbe obtained from fresh and uncooked or slightly heated vegetables\r\nand from some foods of animal origin. These \"vitamines\" are destroyed\r\nby heat and by desiccation. They have not yet been isolated though\r\nin some cases extracted in a nearly pure state. Their presence or\r\nabsence is demonstrated by careful experiments in feeding animals,\r\nsuch as guinea-pigs, with weighed quantities of different foods.\r\nThe \"vitamine\" is often found to be present only in one part of a\r\nseed or fruit or special kind of fat liable to be rejected in food\r\npreparation. An important fact is that it may not amount to as much as\r\none-ten-thousandth of the weight of the food in which it occurs; and\r\nthe part containing it may be overlooked and rejected, or its value\r\ndestroyed by heat or by desiccation. A committee on these \"accessory\r\nfood-factors\" is carrying on experiments at the Lister Institute. Dr.\r\nF. G. Hopkins, F.R.S., who first discovered the importance of one of\r\nthese factors in feeding young rats, is the chairman, and Dr. Harriette\r\nChick is the secretary. Three kinds of these vitamines, or accessory\r\nfood-factors, have up to this date been recognized. The first is the\r\nanti-neuritic or anti-beri-beri vitamine. Its principal sources are\r\nthe seeds of plants and the eggs of animals–yeast-cells are a rich\r\nsource of it. Where \"polished rice,\" as in the Far East, is the staple\r\narticle of diet, to the almost entire exclusion of other food-stuffs,\r\nlassitude and severe pains like those of rheumatism set in, and a whole\r\ncolony or shipload of Chinese \"coolies\" may be disabled. The disease\r\nis called beri-beri, and it can be cured by administering that part of\r\nthe rice-grain (the skin and germ) which is removed by \"polishing,\" and\r\nunfortunately is just that part which contains the needful vitamine.\r\nIt exists in very minute quantity, amounting to only one part in ten\r\nthousand by weight of rice-grain. The second \"vitamine\" recognized is\r\nthe anti-rachitic factor (studied by Hopkins), which tends to promote\r\ngrowth and prevent \"rickets\" in young animals. Certain fats of animal\r\norigin (milk) and green leaves contain it in minute quantity, and are\r\nnecessary for the life of young animals and for the health of adults.\r\n\r\nThe third vitamine recognized is the anti-scorbutic, the factor which\r\nprevents scurvy. It is found in fresh vegetable tissues, and to a\r\nless extent in fresh animal tissues. Its richest sources are cabbage,\r\nswedes, turnips, lettuce, water-cress, and such fruits as lemons,\r\noranges, raspberries, and tomatoes; other vegetables have a less\r\nvalue. Fresh milk and meat possess a definite but low anti-scorbutic\r\nvalue. This vitamine (I am quoting the report of the Committee, which\r\nhas been issued to our military, naval, and medical administrators\r\nand famine-relief-workers throughout the world) _suffers destruction_\r\nwhen the fresh food-stuffs containing it are subjected to _heat_, or\r\n_drying_, as methods of preservation. It is habitually destroyed and\r\nwasted by stewing fresh vegetables with meat for two or three hours.\r\nAll dry food-stuffs, such as cereals, pulses, dried vegetables and\r\ndried milk, are deficient in anti-scorbutic properties; so also are\r\n_tinned vegetables_ and _tinned meat_–hence the disgust to which they\r\nsoon give rise!\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the mystery about lime-juice (which a hundred years\r\nago was used with absolute success to prevent scurvy, and in 1875 was\r\na dead failure) is shown by the workers at the Lister Institute to\r\nbe this–namely, \"lime\" and \"lemon\" are in origin the same word, and\r\nhave become applied in ways unrecognized by the Admiralty and their\r\nmedical advisers in various parts of the world to which the citron, the\r\nlemon, the sweet-lime and the sour-lime–all varieties of one species,\r\n_Citrus medica_ of Linnæus–have been carried from their original home\r\nof origin, the south-east of Asia. The original effective and valuable\r\n\"_lime_-juice\" of the eighteenth century was _lemon_-juice, carefully\r\nprepared from lemons in Sicily and Italy, and from 1804 to 1860 in\r\nMalta. When the demand for it increased in the nineteenth century,\r\nit was adulterated and made up from poor fruit, as the commercial\r\nenterprise of contractors and the fatuous incapacity of the naval\r\nauthorities progressed hand in hand. And then, in the early fifties,\r\nthe West Indian growers of the small sour-lime (_Citrus medica var.\r\nacida_) in Montserrat got the naval contracts, the honest intention\r\nof Sir William Burnett, the chief medical officer of the Navy, being\r\nto establish a permanent and first-rate supply. Strangely enough,\r\nthe naval \"lime-juice\" now really was _lime_-juice and no longer\r\n_lemon_-juice. By a natural but fatal misconception, the medical value\r\nof the juice, whether of lemon or of lime, was by all authorities\r\nattributed to the citric acid present; and the only tests applied to it\r\nwere chemical ones, and not therapeutic. The Lister Institute Committee\r\nhave shown by therapeutic experiment–the feeding of guinea-pigs, in\r\nwhich scurvy can be produced and cured at will–that _the anti-scorbutic\r\nvitamine remains active and unimpaired in lemon-juice from which all\r\nthe citric acid has been extracted_. And, further, that the juice of\r\nthe West Indian sour-lime (_Citrus medica acida_), although very rich\r\nin citric acid, _contains only one-fourth the anti-scorbutic vitamine_\r\nwhich the same quantity of the juice of the true lemon (_Citrus medica\r\nlimonum_) contains. This has been most carefully established by\r\nprolonged series of feeding experiments. It explains the failure of the\r\n_lime_-juice in Sir George Nares' Polar Expedition, and restores the\r\nconfidence in _lemon_-juice based on the unanimous testimony of the\r\nearly records of its use.\r\n\r\nWhilst lemon-juice is thus justified, Dr. Harriette Chick has made a\r\ndiscovery which will go far to remove it from supremacy. She finds that\r\nan anti-scorbutic food can be prepared, when fresh vegetables or fruit\r\nare scarce, by moistening any available seeds (wheat, barley, rye,\r\npeas, beans, lentils) and allowing them to germinate. This sprouted\r\nmaterial possesses an anti-scorbutic value equal to that of many fresh\r\nvegetables; the unsprouted seeds have none. Probably this explains\r\nthe anti-scorbutic value of sweet-wort and of beers made from lightly\r\ndried malt; and the total failure in this respect of our modern beers\r\nmade from kiln-dried malt. Dr. Chick, amongst many other interesting\r\nand important results published by members of the Lister Institute\r\nCommittee, states that the juice of raw swedes and of raw turnips\r\nis a valuable anti-scorbutic (to be added to milk for the use of\r\nartificially nourished infants); so, she states, is orange-juice. But,\r\ncontrary to the usual opinion, she finds that beetroot has little or no\r\nanti-scorbutic value. The whole subject is of extreme importance, and\r\nis necessarily in a tentative stage of pioneer experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ages, successive, of stone, bronze, and iron,
