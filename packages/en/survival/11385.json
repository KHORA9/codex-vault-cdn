Johnson's exhibits at the Health Exhibition, London, chiefly\r\nrelate. Our engravings are from _The Engineer_. A filter press consists\r\nof a number of narrow cells of cast iron, shown in Figs. 3 and 4, held\r\ntogether in a suitable frame, the interior frames being provided with\r\ndrainage surfaces communicating with outlets at the bottom, and covered\r\nwith a filtering medium, which is generally cloth or paper. The interior\r\nof the cells so built up are in direct communication with each other, or\r\nwith a common channel for the introduction of the matter to be filtered,\r\nand as the only exit is through the cloth or paper, the solid portion is\r\nkept back while the liquid passes through and escapes by the drainage\r\nsurfaces to the outlets. The cells are subjected to pressure, which\r\nincreases as the operation goes on, from the growing resistance offered\r\nby the increasing deposit of solid matter on the cloths; and it is\r\ntherefore necessary that they should be provided with a jointing strip\r\naround the outside, and be pressed together sufficiently to prevent any\r\nescape of liquid. In ordinary working both sides of the cell are exposed\r\nto the same pressure, but in some cases the feed passages become choked,\r\nand destroy the equilibrium. This, in the earlier machines, gave rise to\r\nconsiderable annoyance, as the diaphragms, being thin, readily collapsed\r\nat even moderate pressures; but recently all trouble on this head has\r\nbeen obviated by introducing the three projections near the center, as\r\nshown in the cuts, which bear upon each other and form a series of stays\r\nfrom one end of the cells to the other, supporting the plates until the\r\nobstruction is forced away. We give an illustration below showing the\r\narrangement of a pair of filter presses with pneumatic pressure\r\napparatus, which has been successfully applied for dealing with sludge\r\ncontaining a large amount of fibrous matter and rubbish, which could not\r\nbe conveniently treated with by pumps in the ordinary way. The sludge is\r\nallowed to gravitate into wrought iron receivers placed below the floor,\r\nand of sufficient size to receive one charge. From these vessels it is\r\nforced into the presses by means of air compressed to from 100 lb. to\r\n120 lb. per square inch, the air being supplied by the horizontal pump\r\nshown in the engraving. The press is thus almost instantaneously filled,\r\nand the whole operation is completed in about an hour, the result being\r\na hard pressed cake containing about 45 per cent. of water, which can be\r\neasily handled and disposed of as required. The same arrangement is in\r\nuse for dealing with sewage sludge, and the advantages of the compressed\r\nair system over the ordinary pumps, as well as the ready and cleanly\r\nmethod of separating the liquid, will probably commend itself to many of\r\nour readers. We understand that from careful experiments on a large\r\nscale, extending over a period of two years, the cost of filtration,\r\nincluding all expenses, has been found to be not more than about 6d. per\r\nton of wet sludge. A number of specimens of waste liquors from factories\r\nwith the residual matters pressed into cakes, and also of the purified\r\neffluents, are exhibited. These will prove of interest to many, all the\r\nmore so since in some instances the waste products are converted into\r\nmaterials of value, which, it is stated, will more than repay for the\r\noutlay incurred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Fig 4.]\r\n\r\nAnother application of the filter press is in the Porter-Clark process\r\nof softening water, which is shown in operation. We may briefly state\r\nthat the chief object is to precipitate the bicarbonates of lime and\r\nmagnesia held in solution by the water, and so get rid of what is known\r\nas the temporary hardness. To accomplish this, strong lime water is\r\nintroduced in a clear state to the water to be softened, the quantity\r\nbeing regulated according to the amount of bicarbonates in solution. The\r\nimmediate effect of this is that a proportion of the carbonic acid of\r\nthe latter combines with the invisible lime of the clear lime water,\r\nforming a chalky precipitate, while the loss of this proportion of\r\ncarbonic acid also reduces the invisible bicarbonates into visible\r\ncarbonates. The precipitates thus formed are in the state of an\r\nimpalpable powder, and in the original Clark process many hours were\r\nrequired for their subsidence in large settling tanks, which had to be\r\nin duplicate in order to permit of continuous working. By Mr. Porter's\r\nprocess, however, this is obviated by the use of filter presses, through\r\nwhich the chalky water is passed, the precipitate being left behind,\r\nwhile, by means of a special arrangement of cells, the softened and\r\npurified water is discharged under pressure to the service tanks. Large\r\nquantities can thus be dealt with, within small space, and in many cases\r\nno pumping is required, as the resistance of the filtering medium being\r\nsmall, the ordinary pressure in the main is but little reduced. One of\r\nthe apparatus exhibited is designed for use in private mansions, and\r\nwill soften and filter 750 gallons a day. In such a case, where it would\r\nprobably be inconvenient to apply the usual agitating machinery, special\r\narrangements have been made by which all the milk of lime for a day's\r\nworking is made at one time in a special vessel agitated by hand, on the\r\nevening previous to the day on which it is to be used. Time is thus\r\ngiven for the particles of lime to settle during the night. The clear\r\nlime water is introduced into the mixing vessel by means of a charge of\r\nair compressed in the top of a receiver, by the action of water from the\r\nmain, the air being admitted to the milk of lime vessel through a\r\nsuitable regulating valve. A very small filter suffices for removing the\r\nprecipitate, and the clear, softened water can either be used at once,\r\nor stored in the usual way. The advantages which would accrue to the\r\ncommunity at large from the general adoption of some cheap method of\r\nreducing the hardness of water are too well known to need much comment\r\nfrom us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMATIC MALTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to K. Lintner, the worst features of the present system of\r\nmalting are the inequalities of water and temperature in the heaps and\r\nthe irregular supplies of oxygen to, and removal of carbonic acid from,\r\nthe germinating grain. The importance of the last two points is\r\ndemonstrated by the facts that, when oxygen is cut off, alcoholic\r\nfermentation--giving rise to the well-known odor of apples--sets in in\r\nthe cells, and that in an atmosphere with 20 per cent. of carbonic acid,\r\ngermination ceases. The open pneumatic system, which consists in drawing\r\nwarm air through the heaps spread on a perforated floor, should yield\r\nbetter results. All the processes are thoroughly controlled by the eye\r\nand by the thermometer, great cleanliness is possible, and the space\r\nrequisite is only one-third of that required on the old plan. Since May,\r\n1882, this method has been successfully worked at Puntigam, where plant\r\nhas been established sufficient for an annual output of 7,000 qrs. of\r\nmalt. The closed pneumatic system labors under the disadvantages that\r\nfrom the form of the apparatus germination cannot be thoroughly\r\ncontrolled, and cleanliness is very difficult to maintain, while the\r\nsupply of oxygen is, as a rule, more irregular than with the open\r\nfloors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED PNEUMATIC FILTERING PRESSES.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW FORM OF GAS WASHER.\r\n\r\nBy A. BANDSEPT, of Brussels.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe washer is an appliance intended to condense and clean gas, which, on\r\nleaving the hydraulic main, holds in suspension a great many properties\r\nthat are injurious to its illuminating power, and cannot, if retained,\r\nbe turned to profitable account. This cleaning process is not difficult\r\nto carry out effectually; and most of the appliances invented for the\r\npurpose would be highly efficacious if they did not in other respects\r\npresent certain very serious inconveniences. The passage of the gas\r\nthrough a column of cold water is, of course, sufficient to condense it,\r\nand clear it of these injurious properties; but this operation has for\r\nits immediate effect the presentation of an obstacle to the flow of the\r\ngas, and consequently augmentation of pressure in the retorts. In order\r\nto obviate this inconvenience (which exists notwithstanding the use of\r\nthe best washers), exhausters are employed to draw the gas from the\r\nretorts and force it into the washers. There is, however, another\r\ninconvenience which can only be remedied by the use of a second\r\nexhauster, viz., the loss of pressure after the passage of the gas\r\nthrough the washer--a loss resulting from the obstacle presented by this\r\nappliance to the steady flow of the gas. Now as, in the course of its\r\npassage through the remaining apparatus, on its way to the holder, the\r\ngas will have to suffer a considerable loss of pressure, it is of the\r\ngreatest importance that the washer should deprive it of as little as\r\npossible. It will be obvious, therefore, that a washer which fulfills\r\nthe best conditions as far as regards the cleaning of the gas will be\r\nabsolutely perfect if it does not present any impediment to its flow.\r\nSuch an appliance is that which is shown in the illustration on next\r\npage. Its object is, while allowing for the washing being as vigorous\r\nand as long-continued as may be desired, to draw the gas out of the\r\nretorts, and, having cleansed it perfectly from its deleterious\r\nproperties, to force it onward. The apparatus consequently supplies the\r\nplace of the exhauster and the scrubber.\r\n\r\nThe new washer consists of a rectangular box of cast iron, having a\r\nhalf-cylindrical cover, in the upper part of which is fixed a pipe to\r\ncarry off the gas. In the box there is placed horizontally a turbine,\r\nthe hollow axis of which serves for the conveyance of the gas into the\r\nvessel. For this purpose the axis is perforated with a number of small\r\nholes, some of which are tapped, so as to allow of there being screwed\r\non to the axis, and perpendicularly thereto, a series of brooms made of\r\ndog grass, and having their handles threaded for the purpose. These\r\nbrooms are arranged in such a way as not to encounter too great\r\nresistance from contact with the water contained in the vessel, and so\r\nthat the water cast up by them shall not be all thrown in the same\r\ndirection. To obviate these inconveniences they are fixed obliquely to\r\nthe axis of the central pipe, and are differently arranged in regard to\r\neach other. A more symmetrical disposition of them could, however, be\r\nadopted by placing them zigzag, or in such a way as to form two helices,\r\none of which would move in a particular direction, and the other in a\r\ndifferent way. The central pipe, furnished with its brooms, being set in\r\nmotion by means of a pulley fixed upon its axis (which also carries a\r\nflywheel), the gas, drawn in at the center, and escaping by the holes\r\nmade in the pipe, is forced to the circumference of the vessel, where it\r\npasses out.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this washer is first, to break up the current of gas, and\r\nthen force it violently into the water; at the same time sending into it\r\nthe spray of water thrown up by the brooms. This double operation is\r\nconstantly going on, so that the gas, having been saturated by the\r\ntransfusion into it of a vigorous shower of water (into the bulk of\r\nwhich it is subsequently immersed), is forced, on leaving the water, to\r\nagain undergo similar treatment. The same quantity of gas is therefore\r\nseveral times submitted to the washing process, till at length it finds\r\nits way to the outlet, and makes its escape. The extent to which the\r\nwashing of the gas is carried is, consequently, only limited by the\r\nspeed of the apparatus, or rather by the ratio of the speed to the\r\ninitial pressure of the gas. This limit being determined, the operation\r\nmay be continued indefinitely, by making the gas pass into several\r\nwashers in succession. There is, therefore, no reason why the gas should\r\nnot, after undergoing this treatment, be absolutely freed of all those\r\nproperties which are susceptible of removal by water. In fact, all that\r\nis requisite is to increase the dimensions of the vessel, so as to\r\ncompel the gas to remain longer therein, and thus cause it to undergo\r\nmore frequently the operation of washing. These dimensions being fixed\r\nwithin reasonable limits, if the gas is not sufficiently washed, the\r\nspeed of the apparatus may be increased; and the degree of washing will\r\nbe thereby augmented. If this does not suffice, the number of turbines\r\nmay be increased, and the gas passed from one to the other until the gas\r\nis perfectly clean. This series of operations would, however, with any\r\nkind of washer, result in thoroughly cleansing the gas. The only thing\r\nthat makes such a process practically impossible is the very\r\nconsiderable or it may be even total loss of pressure which it entails.\r\nBy the new system, the loss of pressure is _nil_, inasmuch as each\r\nturbine becomes in reality an exhauster. The gas, entering the washer at\r\nthe axis, is drawn to the circumference by the rotatory motion of the\r\nbrooms, which thus form a ventilator. It follows, therefore, that on\r\nleaving the vessel the gas will have a greater pressure than it had on\r\nentering it; and this increase of pressure may be augmented to any\r\ndesired extent by altering the speed of rotation of the axis, precisely\r\nas in the case of an exhauster.\r\n\r\nForcing the gas violently into water, and at the same time dividing the\r\ncurrent, is evidently the most simple, rational, and efficient method of\r\nwashing, especially when this operation is effected by brooms fixed on a\r\nshaft and rotated with great speed. Therefore, if there had not been\r\nthis loss of pressure to deal with--a fatal consequence of every violent\r\noperation--the question of perfect washing would probably have been\r\nsolved long ago. The invention which I have now submitted consists of an\r\narrangement which enables all loss of pressure to be avoided, inasmuch\r\nas it furnishes the apparatus with the greatest number of valuable\r\nqualities, whether regarded from the point of view of washing or that of\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Longitudinal Section. Elevation. Transverse Section.]\r\n\r\nReferring to the illustration, the gas enters the washer by the pipe, A,\r\nwhich terminates in the form of a [Symbol: inverted T]. One end (a) of\r\nthis pipe is bolted to the center of one of the sides of the cylindrical\r\nportion of the case, in which there is a hole of similar diameter to the\r\npipe; the other (a') being formed by the face-plate of a stuffing-box,\r\nB, through which passes the central shaft, C, supported by the\r\nplummer-block, D, as shown. This shaft has upon its opposite end a plate\r\nperforated with holes, E, which is fixed upon the flange of a horizontal\r\npipe, F. This pipe is closed at the other end by means of a plate, E',\r\nfurnished with a spindle, supported by a stuffing-box, B', and carrying\r\na fly-wheel, G. The central pipe, F, is perforated with a number of\r\nsmall holes. The gas entering by the pipe, A, makes its way into the\r\ncentral pipe through the openings in the plate, E, and passes into the\r\ncylindrical case through the small holes in the central pipe, which\r\ncarries the brooms, H. These are caused to rotate rapidly by means of\r\nthe pulley, I; and thus a constant shower of water is projected into the\r\ncylindrical case. When the gas has been several times subjected to the\r\nwashing process, it passes off by the pipe, K. Fresh cold water is\r\nsupplied to the vessel by the pipe, L; and M is the outlet for the\r\ntar.--_Journal of Gas Lighting_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIND MILL.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A paper read before the Engineers' Club of St. Louis, 1884.]\r\n\r\nBy JAMES W. HILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the history of the world the utilization of the wind as a motive\r\npower antedates the use of both water and steam for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe advent of steam caused a cessation in the progress of wind power,\r\nand it was comparatively neglected for many years. But more recently\r\nattention has been again drawn to it, with the result of developing\r\nimprovements, so that it is now utilized in many ways.\r\n\r\nThe need in the West of a motive power where water power is rare and\r\nfuel expensive has done much to develop and perfect wind mills.\r\n\r\nWind mills, as at present constructed in this country, are of recent\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nThe mill known as the \"Eclipse\" was the first mill of its class built.\r\nIt is known as the \"solid-wheel, self-regulating pattern,\" and was\r\ninvented about seventeen years ago. The wind wheel is of the rosette\r\ntype, built without any joints, which gives it the name \"solid wheel,\"\r\nin contradistinction to wheels made with loose sections or fans hinged\r\nto the arms or spokes, and known as \"section wheel mills.\"\r\n\r\nThe regulation of the Eclipse mill is accomplished by the use of a small\r\nadjustable side vane, flexible or hinged rudder vane, and weighted\r\nlever, as shown in Plate 1 (on the larger sizes of mills iron balls\r\nattached to a chain are used in place of the weighted lever). The side\r\nvane and weight on lever being adjustable, can be set to run the mill at\r\nany desired speed.\r\n\r\nNow you will observe from the model that the action of the governing\r\nmechanism is automatic. As the velocity of the wind increases, the\r\npressure on the side vane tends to carry the wind wheel around edgewise\r\nto the wind and parallel to the rudder vane, thereby changing the angle\r\nand reducing the area exposed to the wind; at the same time the lever,\r\nwith adjustable weight attached, swings from a vertical toward a\r\nhorizontal position, the resistance increasing as it moves toward the\r\nlatter position. This acts as a counterbalance of varying resistance\r\nagainst the pressure of the wind on the side vane, and holds the mill at\r\nan angle to the plane of the wind, insuring thereby the number of\r\nrevolutions per minute required, according to the position to which the\r\ngoverning mechanism has been set or adjusted.\r\n\r\nIf the velocity of the wind is such that the pressure on the side vane\r\novercomes the resistance of the counter weight, then the side vane is\r\ncarried around parallel with the rudder vane, presenting only the edge\r\nof the wind wheel or ends of the fans to the wind, when the mill stops\r\nrunning.\r\n\r\nThis type of mill presents more effective wind receiving or working\r\nsurface when in the wind, and less surface exposed to storms when out of\r\nthe wind, than any other type of mill. It is at all times under the\r\ncontrol of an operator on the ground.\r\n\r\nA 22-foot Eclipse mill presents 352 square feet of wind receiving and\r\nworking surface in the wind, and only 9½ square feet of wind resisting\r\nsurface when out of the wind.\r\n\r\nSolid-wheel mills are superseding all others in this country, and are\r\nbeing exported largely to all parts of the world, in sizes from 10 to 30\r\nfeet in diameter. Many of these mills have withstood storms without\r\ninjury, where substantial buildings in the immediate vicinity have been\r\nbadly damaged. I will refer to some results accomplished with pumping\r\nmills:\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1881 there was erected for Arkansas City, Kansas, a\r\n14-foot diameter pumping wind mill; a 32,000-gallon water tank, resting\r\non a stone substructure 15 feet high, the ground on which it stands\r\nbeing 4 feet higher than the main street of the town. One thousand four\r\nhundred feet of 4-inch wood pipe was used for mains, with 1,200 feet of\r\n1½-inch wrought iron pipe. Three 3-inch fire hydrants were placed on the\r\nmain street. The wind mill was located 1,100 feet from the tank, and\r\nforced the water this distance, elevating it 50 feet. We estimate that\r\nthis mill is pumping from 18,000 to 20,000 gallons of water every\r\ntwenty-four hours. We learned that these works have saved two buildings\r\nfrom burning, and that the water is being used for sprinkling the\r\nstreets, and being furnished to consumers at the following rates per\r\nannum: Private houses, $5; stores, $5; hotels, $10; livery stables, $15.\r\nAt these very low rates, the city has an income of $300 per annum. The\r\napproximate cost of the works was $2,000. This gives 15 per cent.\r\ninterest on the investment, not deducting anything for repairs or\r\nmaintenance, which has not cost $5 per annum so far.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 2. THE ECLIPSE WIND MILL.]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1883, a wind water works system was erected for the city of\r\nMcPherson, Kansas, consisting of a 22-foot diameter wind mill on a\r\n75-foot tower, which pumps the water out of a well 80 feet deep, and\r\ndelivers it into a 60,000-gallon tank resting on a substructure 43 feet\r\nabove the ground. Sixteen hundred feet of 6-inch and 300 feet of 4-inch\r\ncast iron pipe furnish the means of distribution; eight 2½-inch double\r\ndischarge fire hydrants were located on the principal streets. A gate\r\nvalve was placed in the 6-inch main close to the elbow on lower end of\r\nthe down pipe from the tank. This pipe is attached to the bottom of the\r\ntank; another pipe was run up through the bottom of tank 9 feet (the\r\ntank being 18 feet deep), and carried down to a connection with the main\r\npipe just outside the gate valve. The operation of this arrangement is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nThe gate valve being closed, the water cannot be drawn below the 9-foot\r\nlevel in tank, which leaves about 35,000 gallons in store for fire\r\nprotection, and is at once available by opening the gate valve referred\r\nto. The tank rests on ground about 5 feet above the main streets, which\r\ngives a head of 57 feet when the tank is half full. The distance from\r\ntank to the farthest hydrant being so short, they get the pressure due\r\nto this head at the hydrant, when playing 2-inch, or 1-1/8-inch streams,\r\nwith short lines of 2½-inch hose; this gives fair fire streams for a\r\ntown with few if any buildings over two stories high. It is estimated\r\nthat this mill is pumping from 30,000 to 38,000 gallons on an average\r\nevery twenty-four hours. There is an automatic device attached to this\r\nmill, which stops it when the tank is full, but as soon as the water in\r\nthe tank is lowered, it goes to pumping again. The cost of these works\r\ncomplete to the city was a trifle over $6,000.\r\n\r\nIn November last a wind mill 18 feet in diameter was erected over a coal\r\nmine at Richmond, in this State. The conditions were as follows:\r\n\r\nThe mine produces 11,000 gallons of water every twenty-four hours. The\r\nsump holds 11,000 gallons. Two entries that can be dammed up give a\r\nstorage of 16,500 gallons, making a total storage capacity of 27,500\r\ngallons. It takes sixty hours for the mine to produce this quantity of\r\nwater, which allows for days that the wind does not blow. The average\r\nelevation that the water has to be raised is 65 feet, measuring from\r\ncenter of sump to point of delivery. A record of ninety days shows that\r\nthis mill has kept the mine free from water with the exception of 6,000\r\ngallons, which was raised in the boxes that the coal is raised in. The\r\nlocation is not good for a wind mill, as it stands in a narrow ravine or\r\nvalley a short distance from its mouth, which terminates at the bottom\r\nlands of the Missouri River. This, taken in connection with the fact\r\nthat the grit in the water cuts the pump plunger packing so fast that in\r\na short time the pump will not work up to its capacity, accounts for the\r\napparent small amount of power developed by this mill.\r\n\r\nThere has been some discussion of late in regard to the horse power of\r\nwind mills, one party claiming that they were capable of doing large\r\namounts of grinding and showing a development of power that was\r\nsurprising to the average person unacquainted with wind mills, while the\r\nother party has maintained that they were not capable of developing any\r\ngreat amount of power, and has cited their performance in pumping water\r\nto sustain his argument. My experience has has led me to the conclusion\r\nthat pumping water with a wind mill is not a fair test of the power that\r\nit is capable of developing, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nA pumping wind mill is ordinarily attached to a pump of suitable size to\r\nallow the mill to run at a mean speed in an 8 to 10 mile wind. Now, if\r\nthe wind increases to a velocity of 16 to 20 miles per hour, the mill\r\nwill run up to its maximum speed and the governor will begin to act,\r\nshortening sail before the wind attains this velocity. Therefore, by a\r\nvery liberal estimate, the pump will not throw more than double the\r\nquantity that it did in the 8 to 10 mile wind, while the power of the\r\nmill has quadrupled, and is capable of running at least two pumps as\r\nlarge as the one to which it is attached. As the velocity of the wind\r\nincreases, this same proportion of difference in power developed to work\r\ndone holds good.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis is not considered a very windy place, therefore the following\r\ntable may be a surprise to some. This table was compiled from the\r\ncomplete record of the year 1881, as recorded by the anemometer of the\r\nUnited States Signal Office on the Mutual Life Insurance Building,\r\ncorner of Sixth and Locust streets, this city. It gives the number of\r\nhours each month that the wind blew at each velocity, from 6 to 20 miles\r\nper hour during the year; also the maximum velocity attained each month.\r\n\r\n_Complete Wind Record at St. Louis for the Year 1881._\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________\r\n      |No.    |No.    |No.    |No.    |No.    |No.    |No.    |No.    |\r\n      |hours  |hours  |hours  |hours  |hours  |hours  |hours  |hours  |Maximum\r\n      |wind   |wind   |wind   |wind   |wind   |wind   |wind   |wind   |velocity\r\nYEAR  |blew 6 |blew 8 |blew 10|blew 12|blew 14|blew 16|blew 18|blew 20|during\r\n1881. |miles  |miles  |miles  |miles  |miles  |miles  |miles  |miles  |each\r\nMONTHS|or over|or over|or over|or over|or over|or over|or over|or over|month.\r\n______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|____\r\n      |H.

It was built to do custom flour and feed\r\ngrinding, also corn shelling, and is in successful operation at the\r\npresent time. We have letters frequently from the owner; one of recent\r\ndate states that it has stood all of the \"Kansas zephyrs,\" never having\r\nbeen damaged as yet. On an average it shells and grinds from 6 to 10\r\nbushels of corn per hour, and runs a 14 inch burr stone, grinding wheat\r\nat the same time. During strong winds it has shelled and ground as high\r\nas 30 bushels of corn per hour. Plate 2 is from a photograph of this\r\nmill and building as it stands. One bevel pinion is all the repairs this\r\nmill has required.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1880 there was erected a 25-foot diameter mill at\r\nHarvard, Clay County, Neb. After this mill had been running nineteen\r\nmonths, we received the following report from the owner:\r\n\r\n\"During the nineteen months we have been running the wind mill, it has\r\ncost us nothing for repairs. We run it with a two-hole corn sheller, a\r\nset of 16-inch burr stones, and an elevator. We grind all kinds of feed,\r\nalso corn meal and Graham flour. We have ground 8,340 bushels, and would\r\nhave ground much more if corn had not been a very poor crop here for the\r\npast two seasons; besides, we have our farm to attend to, and cannot\r\nkeep it running all the time that we have wind. We have not run a full\r\nday at any time, but have ground 125 bushels in a day. When the burr is\r\nin good shape we can grind 20 bushels an hour, and shell at the same\r\ntime in the average winds that we have. The mill has withstood storms\r\nwithout number, even one that blew down a house near it, and another\r\nthat blew down many smaller mills. It is one of the best investments any\r\none can make.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer saw this mill about sixty days ago, and it is in good shape,\r\nand doing the work as stated. The only repairs that it has required\r\nduring four years was one bevel pinion put on this spring.\r\n\r\nThe owner of a 16-foot diameter mill, erected at Blue Springs. Neb.,\r\nsays that \"with a fair wind it grinds easily 15 bushels of corn per hour\r\nwith a No. 3 grinder, also runs a corn-sheller and pump at the same\r\ntime, and that it works smoothly and is entirely self-regulating.\"\r\n\r\nThe No. 3 grinder referred to has chilled iron burrs, and requires from\r\n3 to 4 horse-power to grind 15 bushels of corn per hour. Of one of these\r\n16-foot mills that has been running since 1875 in Northern Illinois, the\r\nowner writes: \"In windy days I saw cord-wood as fast as the wood can be\r\nhandled, doing more work than I used to accomplish with five horses.\"\r\n\r\nThe owner of one of these mills, 20 feet in diameter, running in the\r\nsouthwestern part of this State, writes that he has a corn-sheller and\r\ntwo iron grinding mills with 8-inch burrs attached to it; also a bolting\r\ndevice; that this mill is more profitable to him than 80 acres of good\r\ncorn land, and that it is easily handled and has never been out of\r\norder. The following report on one of these 16-foot mills, running in\r\nnorthern Illinois, may be of interest: This mill stands between the\r\nhouse and barn. A connection is made to a pump in a well-house 25 feet\r\ndistant, and is also arranged to operate a churn and washing machine. By\r\nmeans of sheaves and wire cable, power is transmitted to a circular saw\r\n35 feet distant. In this same manner power is transmitted to the barn\r\n200 feet distant, where connection is made to a thrasher, corn-sheller,\r\nfeed-cutter, and fanning-mill. The corn-sheller is a three horse-power,\r\nwith fan and sacker attached. Three hundred bushels per day has been\r\nshelled, cleaned, and sacked. The thrashing machine is a two horsepower\r\nwith vibrating attachment for separating straw from grain. One man has\r\nthrashed 300 bushels of oats per day, and on windy days says the mill\r\nwould run a thrasher of double this capacity. The saw used is 18 inches\r\ndiameter, and on windy days saws as much wood as can be done by six\r\nhorses working on a sweep power. The owner furnishes the following\r\napproximate cost of mill with the machinery attached and now in use on\r\nhis place:\r\n\r\n  1 16-foot power wind mill, shafting, and tower.    $385\r\n  1 Two horse thrasher.                                70\r\n  1 Three horse sheller.                               38\r\n  1 Feed grinder.                                      50\r\n  1 18-inch saw, frame and arbor.                      40\r\n  1 Fanning mill.                                      25\r\n  1 Force pump.                                        27\r\n  1 Churn.                                              5\r\n  1 Washing machine.                                   15\r\n  Belting, cables, and pulleys.                        45\r\n                                                     ----\r\n                                       Total.        $700\r\n\r\nThe following facts and figures furnished by the owner will give a fair\r\nidea of the economic value of this system, as compared with the usual\r\nmethods of doing the same work. On the farm where it is used, there are\r\nraised annually an average of sixty acres of oats, fifty acres of corn,\r\ntwenty acres of rye, ten acres of buckwheat.\r\n\r\n                                                   Bushels.\r\n  The oats average, say 30 bushels per acre.        1,800\r\n  Corn        \"         30    \"        \"            1,500\r\n  Rye         \"         20    \"        \"              400\r\n  Buckwheat   \"         20    \"        \"              200\r\n  Grinding for self and others.                     1,000\r\n\r\n  It will cost to thrash this grain, shell the corn, and\r\n    grind the feed with steam power.                 $285\r\n  And sawing wood, 12½ cords.                          18\r\n  Pumping, one hour per day, 365 days.                 36\r\n  Churning, half hour per day, 200 days.               10\r\n  Washing, half day per week, 26 days.                 26\r\n                                                     ----\r\n                                     Total.          $375\r\n\r\nThis amount is saved, and more too, as one man, by the aid of the wind\r\nmill, will do this work in connection with the chores of the farm, and\r\nsave enough in utilizing foul weather to more than offset his extra\r\nlabor, cost of oil, etc., for the machinery. The amount saved each year\r\nis just about equal to the cost of a good man. Cost of outfit,\r\n$700--just about equal to the cost of a good man for two years,\r\nconsequently, it will pay for itself in two years. Fifteen years is a\r\nfair estimate for the lifetime of mill with ordinary repairs.\r\n\r\nThe solid-wheel wind mill has never been built larger than 30 feet in\r\ndiameter. For mills larger than this, the latest improved American mill\r\nis the \"Warwick\" pattern.\r\n\r\nA 30-foot mill of this pattern, erected in 1880, in northwestern Iowa,\r\ngave the following results, as reported by the owner:\r\n\r\n\"Attachments as follows: One 22-inch burr; one No. 4 iron feed-mill; one\r\n26-inch circular saw; one two-hole corn-sheller; one grain elevater; a\r\nbolting apparatus for fine meal, buckwheat and graham, all of which are\r\nrun at the same time in good winds, except the saw or the iron mill;\r\nthey being run from the same pulley can run but one at a time. With all\r\nattached and working up to their full capacity, the sails are often\r\nthrown out of the wind by the governors, which shows an immense power.\r\nThe machines are so arranged that I can attach all or separately,\r\naccording to the wind. With the burr alone I have ground 500 bushels in\r\n48 consecutive hours, 100 bushels of it being fine meal. I have also\r\nground 24 full bushels of fine meal for table use in two hours. This\r\nlast was my own, consequently was not tolled. This was before I bought\r\nthe iron mill, and now I can nearly double that amount. I saw my fire\r\nwood for three fires; all my fence posts, etc. My wood is taken to the\r\nmill from 12 to 15 feet long, and as large as the saw will cut by\r\nturning the stick, consequently the saw requires about the same power as\r\nthe burrs. With a good sailing breeze I have all the power I need, and\r\ncan run all the machinery with ease. Last winter I ground double the\r\namount of any water mill in this vicinity. I have no better property\r\nthan the mill.\"\r\n\r\nA 40-foot mill, erected at Fowler, Indiana, in 1881, is running the\r\nfollowing machinery:\r\n\r\n\"I have a universal wood worker, four side, one 34-inch planer, jig saw,\r\nand lathe, also a No. 4 American grinder, and with a good, fair wind I\r\ncan run all the machines at one time. I can work about four days and\r\nnights each week. It is easy to control in high winds.\"\r\n\r\nA 60-foot diameter mill of similar pattern was erected in Steel County,\r\nMinnesota, in 1867. The owner gives the following history of this mill:\r\n\r\n\"I have run this wind flouring mill since 1867 with excellent success.\r\nIt runs 3 sets of burrs, one 4 feet, one 3½ feet, and one 33 inches.\r\nAlso 2 smutters, 2 bolts, and all the necessary machinery to make the\r\nmill complete. A 15-mile wind runs everything in good shape. One wind\r\nwheel was broken by a tornado in 1870, and another in 1881 from same\r\ncause. Aside from these two, which cost $250 each, and a month's lost\r\ntime, the power did not cost over $10 a year for repairs. In July, 1833,\r\na cyclone passed over this section, wrecking my will as well as\r\neverything else in its track, and having (out of the profits of the wind\r\nmill) purchased a large water and steam flouring mill here, I last fall\r\nmoved the wind mill out to Dakota, where I have it running in\r\nfirst-class shape and doing a good business. The few tornado wrecks make\r\nme think none the less of wind mills, as my water power has cost me four\r\ntimes as much in 6 years as the wind power has in 16 years.\"\r\n\r\nThere are very few of these large mills in use in this country, but\r\nthere are a great many from 14 to 30 feet in diameter in use, and their\r\nnumbers are rapidly increasing as their merits become known. The field\r\nfor the use of wind mills is almost unlimited, and embraces pumping\r\nwater, drainage, irrigation, elevating, grinding, shelling, and cleaning\r\ngrain, ginning cotton, sawing wood, churning, running stamp mills, and\r\ncharging electrical accumulators. This last may be the solution of the\r\nSt. Louis gas question.\r\n\r\nIn the writer's opinion the settlement of the great tableland lying\r\nbetween the Mississippi Valley and the Rocky Mountains, and extending\r\nfrom the Gulf of Mexico to the Red River of the North, would be greatly\r\nretarded, if not entirely impracticable, in large sections where no\r\nwater is found at less than 100 to 500 feet below the surface, if it\r\nwere not for the American wind mill; large cattle ranges without any\r\nsurface water have been made available by the use of wind mills. Water\r\npumped out of the ground remains about the same temperature during the\r\nyear, and is much better for cattle than surface water. It yet remains\r\nin the future to determine what the wind mill will not do with the\r\nimprovements that are being made from to time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PNEUMATIC DYNAMITE GUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is here shown as mounted on a torpedo launch and ready for action.\r\nThe shell or projectile is fired by compressed air, admitted from an air\r\nreservoir underneath by a simple pressure of the gunner's finger over\r\nthe valve. The air passes up through the center of the base, the pipe\r\nconnecting with one of the hollow trunnions. The valve is a continuation\r\nof the breech of the gun. The smaller cuts illustrate Lieutenant\r\nZalinski's plan for mounting the gun on each side of the launch, by\r\nwhich plan the gun after being charged may have the breech containing\r\nthe dynamite depressed, and protected from shots of the enemy by its\r\ncomplete immersion alongside the launch; and, if necessary, may be\r\ndischarged from this protected position. The gun is a seamless brass\r\ntube of about forty feet in length, manipulated by the artillerist in\r\nthe manner of an ordinary cannon. Its noiseless discharge sends the\r\nmissile with great force, conveying the powerful explosive within it,\r\nwhich is itself discharged internally upon contact with the deck of a\r\nvessel or other object upon which it strikes, through the explosion of a\r\npercussion fuse in the point of the projectile. A great degree of\r\naccuracy has been obtained by the peculiar form of the projectile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PNEUMATIC DYNAMITE GUN TORPEDO VESSEL.]\r\n\r\nThe projectile consists of a thin metal tube, into which the charge is\r\ninserted, and a wooden sabot which closes it at the rear and flares out\r\nuntil its diameter equals that of the bore of the gun. The forward end\r\nof the tube is pointed with some soft material, in which is embedded the\r\nfiring pin, a conical cap closing the end. A cushion of air is\r\ninterposed at the rear end of the dynamite charge, to lessen the shock\r\nof the discharge and prevent explosion, until the impact of the\r\nprojectile forces the firing pin in upon the dynamite and explodes it.\r\nMany charges have been successfully fired at Fort Hamilton, N.Y. As the\r\ncenter of gravity is forward of the center of figure in the projectile,\r\na side wind acting upon the lighter rear part would tend to turn the\r\nhead into the wind and thus keep it in the line of its trajectory. A\r\nrange of 1¼ miles has been attained with the two inch gun, with a\r\npressure of 420 lb. to the square inch, and one of three miles is hoped\r\nfor with the larger gun and a pressure of 2,000 lb.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROPE PULLEY FRICTION BRAKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA novel device in connection with rope pulley blocks is illustrated in\r\nthe annexed engravings, the object of the appliance being to render it\r\npossible to leave a weight suspended from a block without making the\r\ntail of the rope fast to some neighboring object. By this arrangement\r\nthe danger of the rope slipping loose is avoided, and absolute security\r\nis attained, without the necessity of lowering the weight to the ground.\r\nThe device itself is a friction brake, constructed in the form of a clip\r\nwith holes in it for the three ropes to pass through. It is made to span\r\nthe block, and is secured partly by the pin or bolt upon which the\r\nsheaves run, and partly by the bottom bolt, which unites the cheeks of\r\nthe block. Thus the brake is readily attachable to existing blocks. The\r\ninner half of the clip or brake is fixed solidly to the block, while the\r\nouter half is carried by two screws, geared together by spur-wheels, and\r\nso cut that although rotating in opposite directions, their movements\r\nare equal and similar. One of the screws carries a light rope-wheel, by\r\nwhich it can be rotated, the motion being communicated to the second\r\nscrew by the toothed wheels. When the wheel is rotated in the right\r\ndirection the loose half of the clip is forced toward the other half,\r\nand grips the ropes passing between the two so powerfully that any\r\nweight the blocks are capable of lifting is instantly made secure, and\r\nis held until the brake is released.\r\n\r\nA light spiral spring is placed on each of the screws, in order to free\r\nthe brake from the rope the moment the pressure is released. The hand\r\nrope has a turn and a half round the pulley, and this obviates the need\r\nof holding both ends of it, and thus leaves one hand free to guide the\r\ndescending weight, or to hold the rope of the pulley blocks.\r\n_Engineering_ says these brakes are very useful in raising heavy\r\nweights, as the lift can be secured at each pull, allowing the men to\r\nmove hands for another pull, and as they are made very light they do not\r\ncause any inconvenience in moving or carrying the blocks about.\r\nManufactured by Andrew Bell & Co., Manchester.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWIRE ROPE TOWAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have from time to time given accounts in this journal of the system\r\nof towage by hauling on a submerged wire rope, first experimented upon\r\nby Baron O. De Mesnil and Mr. Max Eyth. On the river Rhine the system\r\nhas been for many years in successful operation; it has also been used\r\nfor several years on the Erie Canal in this State. We publish from\r\n_Engineering_ a view of one of the wire rope tug boats of the latest\r\npattern adopted for use on the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe Cologne Central Towing Company (Central Actien-Gesellschaft für\r\nTauerei und Schleppschifffahrt), by whom the wire rope towage on the\r\nRhine is now carried on, was formed in 1876, by an amalgamation of the\r\nRührorter und Mulheimer Dampfschleppshifffahrt Gesellschaft and the\r\nCentral Actien-Gesellschaft fur Tauerei, and in 1877 it owned eight wire\r\nrope tugs (which it still owns) and seventeen paddle tugs. The company\r\nso arranges its work that the wire rope tugs do the haulage up the rapid\r\nportion of the Rhine, from Bonn to Bingen, while the paddle tugs are\r\nemployed on the quieter portion of the river extending from Rotterdam to\r\nBonn, and from Bingen to Mannheim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROPE PULLEY FRICTION BRAKE.]\r\n\r\nThe leading dimensions of the eight wire rope tugs now worked by the\r\ncompany are as follows:\r\n\r\n                             Tugs No. I. to     Tugs No. V. to\r\n                                  IV.

They are also provided with water ballast tanks, and\r\nunder ordinary circumstances they have a draught of 1.3 to 1.4 meters (4\r\nfeet 3 inches to 4 feet 7 inches), this draught being necessary to give\r\nproper immersion to the screws. When the water in the Rhine is very low,\r\nhowever, the water ballast is pumped out and the tugs are then run with\r\na draught of 1 meter (3 feet 3 3/8 inches), it being thus possible to\r\nkeep them at work when all other towing steamers on the Rhine are\r\nstopped. This happened in the spring of 1882.\r\n\r\nReferring to our engraving, it will be seen that the wire rope rising\r\nfrom the bed of the river passes first over a large guide pulley, the\r\naxis of which is carried by a substantial wrought iron swinging bracket,\r\nthis bracket being so pivoted that while the pulley is free to swing\r\ninto the line on which the rope is approached by the vessel, yet the\r\nrope on leaving the pulley is delivered in a line which is tangential to\r\na second guide pulley placed further aft and at a lower level. This last\r\nnamed guide pulley does not swing, and from it the rope is delivered to\r\nthe clip drum, over which it passes. From the clip drum the rope passes\r\nunder a third guide pulley; this pulley swings on a bracket having a\r\nvertical axis. This third pulley projects down below the keel of the tug\r\nboat, so that the rope on leaving it can pass under the vessel without\r\nfouling. Suitable recesses are formed in the side of the tug boat to\r\naccommodate the swinging pulleys, while the bow of the boat is sloped\r\ndownward nearly to the water line, as shown, so as to allow of the\r\nrising part of the rope swinging over it if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe hauling gear with which the tug is fitted consists of a pair of\r\ncondensing engines with cylinders 14.17 inches in diameter and 23.62\r\ninches stroke, the crankshaft carrying a pinion which gears into a spur\r\nwheel on an intermediate shaft, this shaft again carrying a pinion which\r\ngears into a large spur wheel fixed on the shaft which carries the clip\r\ndrum. In the arrangement of hauling gear above described the ratio of\r\nthe gear is 1:8.44, in the case of tugs Nos. I. to IV.; while in tugs\r\nNos. V. to VIII. the proportion has been made 1:11.82. In tugs I. to IV.\r\nthe diameter of the clip drum is 2.743 meters (9 feet), while in the\r\nremaining tugs it is 3.056 meters (10 feet).\r\n\r\nFrom some interesting data which have been placed at our disposal by Mr.\r\nThomas Schwarz, the manager of the Central Actien-Gesellschaft fur\r\nTauerei und Schleppschifffahrt, we learn that in the tugs Nos. I. to IV.\r\nthe hauling machine develops on an average 150 indicated horse, while in\r\nthe tugs No. V. to VIII. the power developed averages 180 indicated\r\nhorse power. The tugs forming the first named group haul on an average\r\n2,200 tons of cargo, contained in four wooden barges, at a speed of 4½\r\nkilometers (2.8 miles) per hour, against a stream running at the rate of\r\n6½ kilometers (4.05 miles) per hour, while the tugs Nos. V. to VIII.\r\nwill take a load of 2,600 tons of cargo in the same number of wooden\r\nbarges at the same speed and against the same current. In iron barges,\r\nabout one and a half times the quantity of useful load can be drawn by a\r\nslightly less expenditure of power.\r\n\r\nThe average consumption of coal per hour is, for tugs Nos. I. to IV., 5\r\ncwt, and for tugs Nos. V. to VIII., 6 cwt.; and of this fuel a small\r\nfraction (about one-sixth) is consumed by the occasional working of the\r\nscrew propellers at sharp bends. The fuel consumption of the wire rope\r\ntugs contrasts most favorably with that of the paddle and screw tugs\r\nemployed on the Rhine, the best paddle tugs (with compound engines,\r\npatent wheels, etc.) burning three and a half times as much; the older\r\npaddle tugs (with low pressure non-compound engines), four and a half\r\ntimes as much; and the latest screw tugs, two and a half times as much\r\ncoal as the wire rope tugs when doing the same work under the same\r\ncircumstances. The screw tugs just mentioned have a draught of 2½ meters\r\n(8 feet 2½ inches), and are fitted with engines of 560 indicated horse\r\npower.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1879, 1880, and 1881, the company had in use fourteen\r\npaddle tugs and ten eight-wire rope tugs, both classes being--owing to\r\nthe state of trade--about equally short of work. The results of the\r\nworking during these years were as follows:\r\n\r\n  ================================================================\r\n                  |       |  Freight   |  Cost of    | Degree\r\n                  |       |  hauled    |  haulage in |   of\r\n  Class of tugs.  | Year. |    in      |  pence per  | occupation.\r\n                  |       | ton-miles. |  ton-mile.  |\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Paddle          | 1879  | 31,862,858 |   0.1272    |  0.686\r\n    \"             | 1880  | 31,467,422 |   0.1305    |  0.638\r\n    \"             | 1881  | 28,627,049 |   0.1245    |  0.537\r\n  Wire Rope       | 1879  | 15,407,935 |   0.1167    |  0.614\r\n     \"            | 1880  | 17,289,706 |   0.1056    |  0.615\r\n     \"            | 1881  | 17,593,181 |   0.0893    |  0.536\r\n  ================================================================\r\n\r\nThe last column in the above tabular statement, headed \"Degree of\r\nOccupation,\" may require some explanation. It is calculated on the\r\nassumption that a tug could do 3,000 hours of work per annum, and this\r\nis taken as the unit, the time of actual haulage being counted as full\r\ntime, and of stoppages as half time. The expenses included in the\r\nstatement of cost of haulage include all working expenses, repairs,\r\ngeneral management, and depreciation. The accounts for 1882, which are\r\nnot completely available at the time we are writing, show much better\r\nresults than above recorded, there being a considerable reduction of\r\ncost, while the freight hauled amounted to a total of 54,921,965\r\nton-miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WIRE ROPE TUG BOAT, RIVER RHINE.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the wear of the rope, we may state that the relaying of the\r\nfirst rope between St. Goar and Bingen was taken in hand in September,\r\n1879, while that between Obercassel and Bingen was partially renewed the\r\nsame year, the renewal being completed in May, 1880, after the rope had\r\nbeen in use since the beginning of 1876. The second rope between Bonn\r\nand Bingen, a length of 74¾ miles, is of galvanized wire, has now been\r\n2¾ years in use, during which time there have been but three fractures.\r\nThe first rope laid was not galvanized, and it suffered nine fractures\r\nduring the first three years of its use. The first rope, we may mention,\r\nwas laid in lengths of about a mile spliced together, while the present\r\nrope was supplied in long lengths of 7½ miles each, so that the number\r\nof splices is greatly reduced. According to the report of the company\r\nfor the year 1880, the old rope when raised realizes about 16 per cent.\r\nof its original value, and allowing for this, it is calculated that an\r\nallowance of 18.7 per cent. per annum will cover the cost of rope\r\ndepreciation and renewals. Altogether the results obtained on the Rhine\r\nshow that in a rapid stream the economic performances of wire rope tugs\r\ncompare most favorably with those of either paddle or screw tug boats,\r\nthe more rapid the current to be contended against the greater being the\r\nadvantage of the wire rope haulage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED HAY-ROPE MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHay-ropes are used for many purposes, their principal use being in the\r\nfoundry for core-making; but they also find a large application for\r\npacking ironmongery and furniture. The inventor is James Pollard, of the\r\nAtlas Foundry, Burnley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAY ROPE MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe chief part of the mechanism is carried in an open frame, having\r\njournals attached to its two ends, which revolve in bearings. The frame\r\nis driven by the rope pulley. The journal at the left hand is hollow;\r\nthe pinion upon it is stationary, being fixed to the bracket of bearing.\r\nThe pinion gearing into it is therefore revolved by the revolution of\r\nthe frame, and through the medium of bevel wheels actuates a transverse\r\nshaft, parallel to which rollers, and driven by wheels off it, is a\r\ndouble screw, which traverses a \"builder\" to and fro across the width of\r\nframe. The builder is merely the eye through which the band passes, and\r\nits office is to lay the band properly on the bobbin. The latter is\r\nturned to coil on the band by a pitch chain from the builder screw, the\r\nmotion being given through a friction clutch, to allow for slip as the\r\nbobbin or coil gets larger, for obviously the bobbin as it gets larger\r\nis not required to turn so fast to coil up the band produced as when it\r\nis smaller. If the action is studied, it will be seen that the twist is\r\nput in between the bobbin and the hollow journal, and every revolution\r\nof the frame puts in one turn for the twist. The hay is fed to the\r\nmachine through the hollow journal already mentioned. By suitably\r\nproportioning the speed of feed-rollers and the revolutions of the\r\nframe, which is easily accomplished by varying the wheels on the left\r\nhand of frame, bands of any degree of hardness or softness may be\r\nproduced. The machine appears to be simple and not liable to get\r\nderanged. It may be after a little practice attended to by a laborer,\r\nand is claimed by its maker to be able to produce 400 yards of band per\r\nhour. The frame makes about 180 revolutions per minute, that is, this is\r\nthe number of turns put into the twist in this time. The machine can\r\nmake a bundle about 200 yards long, which can be removed off the bobbin\r\nwithout unwinding with the greatest facility.--_Mech.

This consideration, together with some others connected with\r\nthe proposed future deepening of the fairway, rendered it very desirable\r\nto locate the opening span nearly in the center of the river, as shown\r\nin the general plan of the situation, which we publish herewith. At the\r\nsame time it was necessary to avoid any encroachment upon the width of\r\nthe existing quays, which form important lines of communication for\r\nvehicular and passenger traffic along each side of the river, and to and\r\nfrom the railway stations. Again, it was necessary to preserve the full\r\nexisting width of waterway in the river itself, which is sometimes\r\nsubjected to heavy floods.\r\n\r\nThese considerations evidently precluded the construction of a central\r\npier and double-armed swing bridge, and on the other hand they also\r\nprecluded the construction of any solid masonry substructure for the\r\nturntable, either upon the quay or projected into the river. To meet\r\nthese several conditions the bridge has been designed in the form of a\r\nthree-span bridge, that is to say, it is only supported by the two\r\nabutments and two intermediate piers, each consisting of a pair of\r\ncast-iron cylinders or columns, as shown by the dotted circles upon the\r\ngeneral plan.\r\n\r\nThe central opening is that which serves for the passage of vessels. The\r\nswing bridge extends over two openings, or from the north abutment to\r\nthe southern pier, its center of revolution being situated over the\r\ncenter of the northern span, and revolves upon a turntable, which is\r\ncarried upon a lower platform or frame of girders extending across the\r\nnorthern span of the bridge. The southern opening is spanned by an\r\nordinary pair of lattice girders in line with the girders and\r\nsuperstructure of the swing bridge.\r\n\r\nWe propose at an early date to publish further details of this bridge,\r\nand the hydraulic machinery by which it is worked.\r\n\r\nWe present a perspective view of the bridge as seen from the entrance to\r\nthe exhibition building, which is situated in close proximity to the\r\nsouthern end of the bridge.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPORTABLE RAILWAYS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Paper read before the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.]\r\n\r\nBy M. DECAUVILLE, Aîne, of Petit-Bourg (Seine and Oise), France.\r\n\r\n\r\nNarrow gauge railways have been known for a very long time in Great\r\nBritain. The most familiar lines of this description are in Wales, and\r\nit is enough to instance the Festiniog Railway (2 feet gauge), which has\r\nbeen used for the carriage of passengers and goods for nearly half a\r\ncentury. The prosperous condition of this railway, which has been so\r\nsuccessfully improved by Mr. James Spooner and his son, Mr. Charles\r\nSpooner, affords sufficient proof that narrow gauge railways are not\r\nonly of great utility, but may be also very remunerative.\r\n\r\nIn Wales the first narrow gauge railway dates from 1832. It was\r\nconstructed merely for the carriage of slates from Festiniog to\r\nPort-Madoc, and some years later another was built from the slate\r\nquarries at Penrhyn to the port of Bangor. As the tract of country\r\ntraversed by the railways became richer by degrees, the idea was\r\nconceived of substituting locomotives for horses, and of adapting the\r\nline to the carriage of goods of all sorts, and finally of passengers\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nBut these railways, although very economical, are at the same time very\r\ncomplicated in construction. Their arrangements are based upon the same\r\nprinciples as railways of the ordinary gauge, and are not by any means\r\ncapable of being adapted to agriculture, to public works, or to any\r\nother purpose where the tracks are constantly liable to removal. These\r\npermanent narrow gauge lines, the laying of which demands the service of\r\nengineers, and the maintenance of which entails considerable expense,\r\nsuggested to M. Decauville, Aîne, farmer and distiller at Petit-Bourg,\r\nnear Paris, the idea of forming a system of railways composed entirely\r\nof metal, and capable of being readily laid. Cultivating one of the\r\nlargest farms in the neighborhood of Paris, he contemplated at first\r\nnothing further than a farm railroad; and he contrived an extremely\r\nportable plant, adapted for clearing the land of beetroot, for spreading\r\nmanure, and for the other needs of his farm.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning in his first railroads, the use of timber materials\r\nwas rigidly rejected by him; and all parts, whether the straight or\r\ncurved rails, crossings, turntables, etc., were formed of a single\r\npiece, and did not require any special workman to lay them down. By\r\ndegrees he developed his system, and erected special workshops for the\r\nconstruction of his portable plant; making use of his farm, and some\r\nquarries of which he is possessed in the neighborhood, as experimental\r\nareas. At the present time this system of portable railways serves all\r\nthe purposes of agriculture, of commerce, of manufactures, and even\r\nthose of war.\r\n\r\nWithin so limited a space it would be impossible to give a detailed\r\ndescription of the rails and fastenings used in all these different\r\nmodes of application. The object of this paper is rather to direct the\r\nattention of mechanical engineers to the various uses to which narrow\r\ngauge portable railways may be put, to the important saving of labor\r\nwhich is effected by their adoption, and to the ease with which they are\r\nworked.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Decauville railway has been so rapid and so great\r\nthat many inventors have entered the same field, but they have almost\r\nall formed the idea of constructing the portable track with detachable\r\nsleepers. There are thus, at present, two systems of portable tracks:\r\nthose in which the sleepers are capable of being detached, and those in\r\nwhich they are not so capable.\r\n\r\nThe portable track of the Decauville system is not capable of so coming\r\napart. The steel rails and sleepers are riveted together, and form only\r\none piece. The chief advantage of these railways is their great\r\nfirmness; besides this, since the line has only to be laid on the\r\nsurface just as it stands, there are not those costs of maintenance\r\nwhich become unavoidable with lines of which the sleepers are fixed by\r\nmeans of bolts, clamps, or other adjuncts, only too liable to be lost.\r\nMoreover, tracks which are not capable of separation are lighter and\r\ntherefore more portable than those in which the sleepers are detachable.\r\n\r\nWith regard to sleepers, a distinction must be drawn between those which\r\nproject beyond the rails and those which do not so project. M.\r\nDecauville has adopted the latter system, because it offers sufficient\r\nstrength, while the lines are lighter and less cumbersome. Where at\r\nfirst he used flat iron sleepers, he now fits his lines with dished\r\nsteel sleepers, in accordance with Figs. 1 and 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThis sleeper presents very great stiffness, at the same time preserving\r\nits lightness; and the feature which specially distinguishes this\r\nrailway from others of the same class is not only its extreme strength,\r\nbut above all its solidity, which results from its bearing equally upon\r\nthe ground by means of the rail base and of the sleepers.\r\n\r\nIn special cases, M. Decauville provides also railroads with projecting\r\nsleepers, whether of flat steel beaten out and rounded, or of channel\r\niron; but the sleeper and the rail are always inseparable, so as not to\r\nlessen the strength, and also to facilitate the laying of the line. If\r\nthe ground is too soft, the railway is supported by bowl sleepers of\r\ndished steel, Figs. 3 and 4, especially at the curves; but the necessity\r\nfor using these is but seldom experienced. The sleepers are riveted\r\ncold. The rivets are of soft steel, and the pressure with which this\r\nriveting is effected is so intense that the sleepers cannot be separated\r\nfrom the rails, even after cutting off both heads of the rivets, unless\r\nby heavy blows of the hammer, the rivets being driven so thoroughly into\r\nthe holes made in the rails and sleepers that they fill them up\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nThe jointing of the rails is excessively simple. The rail to the right\r\nhand is furnished with two fish-plates; that to the left with a small\r\nsteel plate riveted underneath the rail and projecting 1¼ in. beyond it.\r\nIt is only necessary to lay the lengths end to end with one another,\r\nmaking the rail which is furnished with the small plate lie between the\r\ntwo fish-plates, and the junction can at once be effected by fish-bolts.\r\nA single fish-bolt, passing through the holes in the fish-plates, and\r\nthrough an oval hole in the rail end, is sufficient for the purpose.\r\n\r\nWith this description of railway it does not matter whether the curves\r\nare to the right or to the left. The pair of rails are curved to a\r\nsuitable radius, and can only need turning end for end to form a curve\r\nin the direction required. The rails weigh 9 lb., 14 lb., 19 lb., and 24\r\nlb. per running yard, and are very similar to the rails used on the main\r\nrailways of France, except that their base has a proportionally greater\r\nwidth. As to the strength of the rail, it is much greater in proportion\r\nto the load than would at first sight be thought; all narrow-gauge\r\nrailways being formed on the principle of distributing the load over a\r\nlarge number of axles, and so reducing the amount on each wheel. For\r\ninstance, the 9 lb. rail used for the portable railway easily bears a\r\nweight of half a ton for each pair of wheels.\r\n\r\nThe distance between the rails differs according to the purpose for\r\nwhich they are intended. The most usual gauges are 16in., 20 in., and\r\n24in. The line of 16 in. gauge, with 9 lb. rails, although extremely\r\nlight, is used very successfully in farming, and in the interior of\r\nworkshops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Fig. 4. Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nA length of 16 ft. 5 in. of 9 lb. steel rail, to 16 in. gauge, with\r\nsleepers, etc., scarcely weighs more than 1 cwt., and may therefore be\r\nreadily carried by a man placing himself in the middle and taking a rail\r\nin each hand.\r\n\r\nThose members of the Institution who recently visited the new port of\r\nAntwerp will recollect having seen there the portable railway which\r\nMessrs. Couvreux and Hersetit had in use; and as it was these works at\r\nthe port of Antwerp that gave rise to the idea of this paper, it will be\r\nwell to begin with a description of this style of contractor's plant.\r\n\r\nThe earth in such works may be shifted by hand, horsepower, or\r\nlocomotive. For small works the railway of 16 in. gauge, with the 9 lb.\r\nrails, is commonly used, and the trucks carry double equilibrium\r\ntipping-boxes, containing 9 to 11 cubic feet. These wagons, having\r\ntipping-boxes without any mechanical appliances, are very serviceable;\r\nsince the box, having neither door nor hinge, is not liable to need\r\nrepairs.\r\n\r\nThis box keeps perfectly in equilibrium upon the most broken up roads.\r\nTo tip it up to the right or the left, it must simply be pushed from the\r\nopposite side, and the contents are at once emptied clean out. In order\r\nthat the bodies of the wagons may not touch at the top, when several are\r\ncoupled together, each end of the wagon is furnished with a buffer,\r\ncomposed of a flat iron bar cranked, and furnished with a hanging hook.\r\n\r\nPlant of this description is now being used in an important English\r\nundertaking at the port of Newhaven, where it is employed not only on\r\nthe earthworks, but also for transporting the concrete manufactured with\r\nMr. Carey's special concrete machine.\r\n\r\nThese little wagons, of from 9 to 11 cubic feet capacity, run along with\r\nthe greatest ease, and a lad could propel one of them with its load for\r\n300 yards at a cost of 3d. per cube yard. In earthworks the saving over\r\nthe wheel-barrow is 80 per cent., for the cost of wagons propelled by\r\nhand comes to 0.1d. per cube yard, carried 10 yards, and to go this\r\ndistance with a barrow costs ½d. A horse draws without difficulty,\r\nwalking by the side of the line, a train of from eight to ten trucks on\r\nthe level, or five on an incline of 7 per cent. (1 in 14).\r\n\r\nOne mile of this railway, 16 in. gauge and 9 lb. steel rail, with\r\nsixteen wagons, each having a double equilibrium tipping box containing\r\n11 cubic feet, and all accessories, represents a weight of 20 tons--a\r\nvery light weight, if it is considered that all the materials are\r\nentirely of metal. Its net cost price per mile is 450_l_., the wagons\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nLarge contracts for earthwork with horse haulage are carried on to the\r\ngreatest advantage with the railway of 20 in. gauge and 14 lb. rails.\r\nThe length of 16 ft. 5 in. of this railway weighs 170 lb., and so can\r\neasily be carried by two men, one placing himself at each end. The\r\nwagons most in use for these works are those with double equilibrium\r\ntipping boxes, holding 18 cubic feet. These are at present employed in\r\none of the greatest undertakings of the age, namely, the cutting of the\r\nPanama Canal, where there are used upward of 2,700 such wagons, and more\r\nthan 35 miles of track.\r\n\r\nA mile of these rails of 20 in. gauge with 14 lb. rails, together with\r\nsixteen wagons of 18 cubic feet capacity, with appurtenances, costs\r\nabout 660_1_., and represents a total weight of 33 tons.\r\n\r\nThis description of material is used for all contracts exceeding 20,000\r\ncubic yards.\r\n\r\nA very curious and interesting use of the narrow-gauge line, and the\r\nwagons with double equilibrium tipping-box, was made by the Societe des\r\nChemins de Fer Sous-Marins on the proposed tunnel between France and\r\nEngland. The line used is that of 16 in. gauge, with 9 lb. rails.\r\n\r\nThe first level of the tunnel, which was constructed by means of a\r\nspecial machine by Colonel Beaumont, had only a diameter of 2.13 m. (7\r\nft.); the tipping boxes have therefore a breadth of only 2 ft., and\r\ncontain 7¼ cubic feet. The boxes are perfectly balanced, and are most\r\neasily emptied. The wagons run on two lines, the one being for the\r\nloaded trains, and the other for the empty trains.\r\n\r\nThe engineers and inspectors, in the discharge of their duties, make use\r\nof the Liliputian carriages. The feet of the travelers go between the\r\nwheels, and are nearly on a level with the rails; nevertheless, they are\r\ntolerably comfortable. They are certainly the smallest carriages for\r\npassengers that have ever been built; and the builder even prophesies\r\nthat these will be the first to enter into England through the Channel\r\nTunnel.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important uses to which a narrow gauge line can be put\r\nis that of a military railway. The Dutch, Russian, and French\r\nGovernments have tried it for the transporting of provisions, of war\r\nmaterial, and of the wounded in their recent campaigns. In Sumatra, in\r\nTurkestan, and in Tunis these military railroads have excited much\r\ninterest, and have so fully established their value that this paper may\r\nconfine itself to a short description.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of the Russians against the Turcomans presented two great\r\ndifficulties; these were the questions of crossing districts in which\r\nwater was extremely scarce or failed entirely, and of victualing the\r\nexpeditionary forces. This latter object was completely effected by\r\nmeans of 67 miles of railway, 20 in. gauge, 14 lb. steel rails, with 500\r\ncarriages for food, water, and passengers. The rails were laid simply on\r\nthe sand, so that small locomotives could not be used, and were obliged\r\nto be replaced by Kirghiz horses, which drew with ease from 1,800 lb. to\r\n2,200 lb. weight for 25 miles per day.\r\n\r\nIn the Tunisian war this railroad of 20 in. gauge, 14 lb. rail, was\r\nreplaced by that of two ft. gauge, with 14 lb. and 19 lb. rails. There\r\nwere quite as great difficulties as in the Turcoman campaign, and the\r\ncountry to be crossed was entirely unknown. The observations made before\r\nthe war spoke of a flat and sandy country. In reality a more uneven\r\ncountry could not be imagined; alternating slopes of about 1 in 10\r\ncontinually succeeded each other; and before reaching Kairouan 7½ miles\r\nof swamp had to be crossed. Nevertheless the horses harnessed to the\r\nrailway carriages did on an average twelve to seventeen times the work\r\nof those working ordinary carriages. In that campaign also, on account\r\nof the steep ascents, the use of locomotives had to be given up. The\r\ntrack served not only for the conveying of victuals, war material, and\r\ncannon, but also of the wounded; and a large number of the survivors of\r\nthis campaign owe their lives to this railway, which supplied the means\r\nof their speedy removal without great suffering from the temporary\r\nhospitals, and of carrying the wounded to places where more care could\r\nbe bestowed upon them.\r\n\r\nThe carriages which did duty in this campaign are wagons with a platform\r\nentirely of metal, resting upon eight wheels. The platform is 13 ft. 1\r\nin. in length, and 3 ft. 11 in. in width. The total length with buffers\r\nis 14 ft. 9 in. This carriage may be at will turned into a goods wagon\r\nor a passenger carriage for sixteen persons, with seats back to back, or\r\nan ambulance wagon for eight wounded persons.\r\n\r\nFor the transport of cannon the French military engineers have adopted\r\nsmall trucks. A complete equipage, capable of carrying guns weighing\r\nfrom 3 to 9 tons, is composed of trucks with two or three axles, each\r\nbeing fitted with a pivot support, by means of which it is made possible\r\nto turn the trucks, with the heaviest pieces of ordnance, on turntables,\r\nand to push them forward without going off the rails at the curves.\r\n\r\nThe trucks which have been adopted for the service of the new forts in\r\nParis are drawn by six men, three of whom are stationed at each end of\r\nthe gun, and these are capable of moving with the greatest ease guns\r\nweighing 9 tons.\r\n\r\nThe narrow-gauge railway was tested during the war in Tunis more than in\r\nany preceding campaign, and the military authorities decided, after\r\npeace had been restored in that country, to continue maintaining the\r\nnarrow-gauge railways permanently; this is a satisfactory proof of their\r\nhaving rendered good service. The line from Sousse to Kairouan is still\r\nopen to regular traffic. In January, 1883, an express was established,\r\nwhich leaves Sousse every morning and arrives at Kairouan--a distance of\r\nforty miles--in five hours, by means of regularly organized relays. The\r\nnumber of carriages and trucks for the transport of passengers and goods\r\nis 118.\r\n\r\nThe success thus attained by the narrow-gauge line goes far to prove how\r\nunfounded is the judgment pronounced by those who hold that light\r\nrailways will never suffice for continuous traffic. These opinions are\r\nbased on certain cases in the colonies, where it was thought fit to\r\nadopt a light rail weighing about 18 lb. to 27 lb. per yard, and keeping\r\nthe old normal gauge. It is nevertheless evident that it is impossible\r\nto construct cheap railways on the normal gauge system, as the\r\nmaintenance of such would-be light railways is in proportion far more\r\ncostly than that of standard railways.\r\n\r\nThe narrow gauge is entirely in its right place in countries where, as\r\nnotably in the case of the colonies, the traffic is not sufficiently\r\nextensive to warrant the capitalization of the expenses of construction\r\nof a normal gauge railway.\r\n\r\nQuite recently the Eastern Railway Company of the province of Buenos\r\nAyres have adopted the narrow gauge for connecting two of their\r\nstations, the gauge being 24 in. and the weight of the rails 19 lb. per\r\nyard. This company have constructed altogether six miles of narrow-gauge\r\nroad, with a rolling stock of thirty passenger carriages and goods\r\ntrucks and two engines, at a net cost price of 7,500l., the engines\r\nincluded. This line works as regularly as the main line with which it is\r\nconnected. The composite carriages in use leave nothing to be desired\r\nwith regard to their appearance and the comforts they offer. Third-class\r\ncarriages, covered and open, and covered goods wagons, are also\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nAll these carriages are constructed according to the model of those of\r\nthe Festiniog Railway. The engines weigh 4 tons, and run at 12½ miles\r\nper hour for express trains with a live load of 16 tons; while for goods\r\ntrains carrying 35 tons the rate is 7½ miles an hour.\r\n\r\nAnother purpose for which the narrow-gauge road is of the highest\r\nimportance in colonial commerce is the transport of sugar cane. There\r\nare two systems in use for the service of sugar plantations:\r\n\r\n1. Traction by horses, mules, or oxen.\r\n\r\n2. Traction by steam-engine.\r\n\r\nIn the former case, the narrow gauge, 20 in. with 14 lb. rails, is used,\r\nwith platform trucks and iron baskets 3 ft. 3 in. long.\r\n\r\nThe use of these wagons is particularly advantageous for clearing away\r\nthe sugar cane from the fields, because, as the crop to be carried off\r\nis followed by another harvest, it is important to prevent the\r\ndestructive action of the wheels of heavily laden wagons. The baskets\r\nmay be made to contain as much as 1,300 lb. of cane for animal traction,\r\nand 2,000 lb. for steam traction. In those colonies where the cane is\r\nnot cut up into pieces, long platform wagons are used entirely made of\r\nmetal, and on eight wheels. When the traction is effected by horses or\r\nmules, a chain 14½ ft. long is used, and the animals are driven\r\nalongside the road. Oxen are harnessed to a yoke, longer by 20 in. to 24\r\nin. than the ordinary yoke, and they are driven along on each side of\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nOn plantations where it is desirable to have passenger carriages, or\r\nwhere it is to be foreseen that the narrow-gauge line maybe required for\r\nthe regular transport of passengers and goods, the 20 in. line is\r\nreplaced by one of 24 in.\r\n\r\nThe transport of the refuse of sugar cane is effected by means of\r\ntilting basket carts; the lower part of which consists of plate iron as\r\nin earthwork wagons, while the upper part consists of an open grating,\r\noffering thus a very great holding capacity without being excessively\r\nheavy. The content of these wagons is 90 cubic feet (2,500 liters). To\r\nuse it for the transport of earth, sand, or rubbish, the grating has\r\nmerely to be taken off. In the case of the transport of sugar cane\r\nhaving to be effected by steam power, the most suitable width of road is\r\n24 in., with 19 lb. rails; and this line should be laid down and\r\nballasted most carefully. The cost of one mile of the 20 in. gauge road,\r\nwith 14 lb. rails, thirty basket wagons, and accessories for the\r\ntransport of sugar cane, is 700l., and the total weight of this plant\r\namounts to 35 tons.\r\n\r\nOwing to the great lightness of the portable railways, and the facility\r\nwith which they can be worked, the attention of explorers has repeatedly\r\nbeen attracted by them. The expedition of the Ogowe in October, 1880,\r\nthat of the Upper Congo in November, 1881, and the Congo mission under\r\nSavorgnan de Brazza, have all made use of the Decauville narrow-gauge\r\nrailway system.\r\n\r\nDuring these expeditions to Central Africa, one of the greatest\r\nobstacles to be surmounted was the transport of boats where the river\r\nceased to be navigable; for it was then necessary to employ a great\r\nnumber of negroes for carrying both the boats and the luggage. The\r\nexplorers were, more or less, left to the mercy of the natives, and but\r\nvery slow progress could be made.\r\n\r\nOn returning from one of these expeditions in Africa, Dr. Balay and M.\r\nMizon conceived the idea of applying to M. Decauville for advice as to\r\nwhether the narrow-gauge line might not be profitably adapted for the\r\nexpedition. M. Decauville proposed to them to transport their boats\r\nwithout taking them to pieces, or unloading them, by placing them on two\r\npivot trollies, in the same manner as the guns are transported in\r\nfortifications and in the field. The first experiments were made at\r\nPetit-Bourg with a pleasure yacht. The hull, weighing 4 tons, was placed\r\non two gun trollies, and was moved about easily across country by means\r\nof a portable line of 20 in. gauge, with 14 lb. rails. The length of the\r\nhull was about 45 ft., depth 6 ft. 7 in., and breadth of beam 8 ft. 2\r\nin., that is to say, five times the width of the narrow-gauge, and\r\nnotwithstanding all this the wheels never came off the line. The\r\nsections of line were taken up and replaced as the boat advanced, and a\r\nspeed of 1,100 yards per hour was attained. Dr. Balay and M. Mizon\r\ndeclared that the result obtained exceeded by far their most sanguine\r\nhopes, because during their last voyage, the passage of the rapids had\r\nsometimes required a whole week for 1,100 yards (1 kilometer), and they\r\nconsidered themselves very lucky indeed if they could attain a speed of\r\none kilometer per day. The same narrow gauge system has since been three\r\ntimes adopted by African explorers, on which occasions it was found that\r\nthe 20 in. line, with 9 lb. or 14 lb. rails, was the most suitable for\r\nscientific expeditions of this nature.\r\n\r\nThe trucks used are of the kind usually employed for military purposes,\r\nwith wheels, axles, and pivot bearings of steel; on being dismounted the\r\nbodies of the two trucks form a chest, which is bolted together and\r\ncontains the wheels, axles, and other accessories. The total weight of\r\nthe 135 yards of road used by Dr. Balay and M. Mizon during their first\r\nvoyage was 2,900 lb., and the wagons weighed 5,000 lb. Hence the\r\nexpedition had to carry a supplementary weight of 3½ tons; but at any\r\ngiven moment the material forming this burden became the means of\r\ntransporting, in its turn, seven boats, representing a total weight of\r\n20 tons.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to enumerate in this paper all the various kinds of\r\nwagons and trucks suitable for the service of iron works, shipyards,\r\nmines, quarries, forests, and many other kinds of works; and we\r\ntherefore limit ourselves to mentioning only a few instances which\r\nsuffice to show that the narrow gauge can be applied to works of the\r\nmost varied nature and under the most adverse circumstances possible.\r\n\r\nIt therefore only remains to mention the various accessories which have\r\nbeen invented for the purpose of completing the system. They consist of\r\noff-railers, crossings, turntables, etc.\r\n\r\nThe off railer is used for establishing a portable line, at any point,\r\ndiverging to the right or left of a permanent line, and for transferring\r\ntraffic to it without interruption. It consists of a miniature inclined\r\nplane, of the same height at one end as the rail, tapering off regularly\r\nby degrees toward the other end. It is only necessary to place the\r\noff-railer (which, like all the lengths of rail of this system, forms\r\nbut one piece with its sleepers and fish-plates) on the fixed line,\r\nadding a curve in the direction it is intended to go, and push the\r\nwagons on to the off-railer, when they will gradually leave the fixed\r\nline and pass on the new track.\r\n\r\nThe switches consist of a rail-end 49 in. in length, which serves as a\r\nmovable tongue, placed in front of a complete crossing, the rails of\r\nwhich have a radius of 4, 6, or 8 meters; a push with the foot suffices\r\nto alter the switch. There are four different models of crossings\r\nconstructed for each radius, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. For two tracks with symmetrical divergence.\r\n\r\n2. For a curve to the right and a straight track.\r\n\r\n3. For a curve to the left and a straight track.\r\n\r\n4. For a meeting of three tracks.\r\n\r\nWhen a fixed line is used, it is better to replace the movable switch by\r\na fixed cast-iron switch, and to let the workmen who drive the wagon\r\npush it in the direction required. Planed switch tongues are also used,\r\nhaving the shape of those employed on the normal tracks, especially for\r\nthe passage of small engines; the switches are, in this case, completed\r\nby the application of a hand lever.\r\n\r\nThe portable turntable consists of two faced plates laid over the other,\r\none of thick sheet iron, and the other of cast iron. The sheet-iron\r\nplate is fitted with a pivot, around which the cast iron one is made to\r\nrevolve; these plates may either be smooth, or grooved for the wheels.\r\nThe former are used chiefly when it is required to turn wagons or trucks\r\nof light burden, or, in the case of earthworks, for trucks of moderate\r\nweight. These plates are quite portable; their weight for the 16 in.\r\ngauge does not exceed 200 lb. For engineering works a turntable plate\r\nwith variable width of track has been designed, admitting of different\r\ntracks being used over the same turntable.\r\n\r\nWhen turntables are required for permanent lines, and to sustain heavy\r\nburdens, turntables with a cast iron box are required, constructed on\r\nthe principle of the turntables of ordinary railways. The heaviest\r\nwagons may be placed on these box turntables, without any portion\r\nsuffering damage or disturbing the level of the ground. In the case of\r\ncoal mines, paper mills, cow houses with permanent lines, etc., fixed\r\nplates are employed. Such plates need only be applied where the line is\r\nalways wet, or in workshops where the use of turntables is not of\r\nfrequent occurrence. This fixed plate is most useful in farmers'\r\nstables, as it does not present any projection which might hurt the feet\r\nof the cattle, and is easy to clean.\r\n\r\nThe only accident that can happen to the track is the breaking of a\r\nfish-plate. It happens often that the fish-plates get twisted, owing to\r\nrough handling on the part of the workmen, and break in the act of being\r\nstraightened. In order to facilitate as much as possible the repairs in\r\nsuch cases, the fish-plates are not riveted by machinery, but by hand;\r\nand it is only necessary to cut the rivets with which the fish-plate is\r\nfastened, and remove it if broken: A drill passed through the two holes\r\nof the rail removes all burrs that may be in the way of the new rivet.\r\nNo vises are required for this operation; the track to be repaired is\r\nheld by two workmen at a height of about 28 in. above the ground, care\r\nbeing taken to let the end under repair rest on a portable anvil, which\r\nis supplied with the necessary appliances. The two fish-plates are put\r\nin their place at the same time, the second rivet being held in place\r\nwith one finger, while the first is being riveted with a hammer; if it\r\nis not kept in its place in this manner it may be impossible to put it\r\nin afterward, as the blows of the hammer often cause the fish-plate to\r\nshift, and the holes in the rail are pierced with great precision to\r\nprevent there being too much clearance. No other accident need be feared\r\nwith this line, and the breakage described above can easily be repaired\r\nin a few minutes without requiring any skilled workman.\r\n\r\nThe narrow-gauge system, which has recently received so great a\r\ndevelopment on the Continent, since its usefulness has been\r\ndemonstrated, and the facility with which it can be applied to the most\r\nvaried purposes, has not yet met in England with the same universal\r\nacceptance; and those members of this Institution who crossed the sea to\r\ngo to Belgium were, perhaps, surprised to see so large a number of\r\nportable railways employed for agricultural and building purposes and\r\nfor contractors' works. But in the hands of so practical a people it may\r\nbe expected that the portable narrow gauge railway will soon be applied\r\neven to a larger number of purposes than is the case elsewhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGERARD'S ALTERNATING CURRENT MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe machine represented in the annexed engravings consists of a movable\r\ninductor, whose alternate poles pass in front of an armature composed of\r\na double number of oblong and flat bobbins, that are affixed to a circle\r\nfirmly connected with the frame. There is a similar circle on each side\r\nof the inductor. The armature is stationary, and the wires that start\r\nfrom the bobbins are connected with terminals placed upon a wooden\r\nsupport that surmounts the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GERARD'S ALTERNATING ELECTRIC MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThis arrangement allows of every possible grouping of the currents\r\naccording to requirements. Thus, the armature may be divided into two\r\ncurrents, so as to allow of carbons 30 mm. in diameter being burned, or\r\nelse so as to have four, eight, twelve, twenty-four, or even forty-eight\r\ndistinct circuits capable of being used altogether or in part.\r\n\r\nThis machine has been studied with a view of rendering the lamps\r\nindependent; and there may be produced with it, for example, a voltaic\r\narc of an intensity of from 250 to 600 carcels for the lighting of a\r\ncourtyard, or it may be used for producing arcs of less intensity for\r\nshops, or for supplying incandescent lamps. As each of the circuits is\r\nindependent, it becomes easy to light or extinguish any one of the lamps\r\nat will. Since the conductors are formed of ordinary simple wires, the\r\ncost attending the installation of 12 or 24 lamps amounts to just about\r\nthe same as it would in the case of a single cable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GERARD'S 250 H.P.

F. TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince 1838 much has been done toward increasing the carrying capacity of\r\na single wire. In response to your invitation I will relate my\r\nexperience upon the Postal's large coppered wire, in an effort to\r\ntransmit 800 words per minute over a 1,000 mile circuit, and add my mite\r\nto the vast sum of knowledge already possessed by electricians.\r\n\r\nAs an introduction, I shall mention a few historical facts, but do not\r\npropose to write in this article even a short account of the different\r\nautomatic systems, and I must assume that my readers are familiar with\r\nmodern automatic machines and appliances.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, upon the completion of the Automatic Company's 7 ohm wire\r\nbetween New York and Washington, it happened that Prof. Moses G. Farmer\r\nwas in the Washington office when the first message was about to be\r\nsent, and upon being requested, he turned the \"crank\" and transmitted\r\nthe message to New York, at the rate of 217 words per minute.\r\n\r\nUpon his return to New York he co-operated with Mr. Prescott in\r\nexperiments on W.U. wires, their object being to determine what could be\r\ndone on iron wires with the Bain system. A good No. 8 wire running from\r\nNew York to Boston was selected, reinsulated, well trimmed, and put in\r\nfirst-class electrical condition, previous to the test. The \"Little\"\r\nchemical paper was used.\r\n\r\nThe maximum speed attained on this wire was 65 words per minute.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time George H. Grace used an electro magnet on the\r\nautomatic line with such good effect that the speed on the New\r\nYork-Washington circuit was increased to 450 words per minute.\r\n\r\nThen a platina stylus or pen was substituted for the iron pen in\r\nconnection with iodide paper, and the speed increased to 900 words per\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, upon the completion of the Rapid Company's 6 ohm wire, between\r\nNew York and Boston, 1,200 words per minute were transmitted between the\r\ncities above named.\r\n\r\nIn 1882, I was employed by the Postal Telegraph Company to put the Leggo\r\nautomatic system into practical shape, and, if possible, transmit 800\r\nwords per minute between New York and Chicago.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to string a steel-copper wire, the copper on which was\r\nto weigh 500 lb. to the mile.\r\n\r\nWhen complete, the wire was rather larger than No. 3, English gauge, but\r\nvaried in diameter, some being as large as No. 1, and it averaged 525\r\nlb. of copper per mile and = 1.5 ohms. The surface of this wire was,\r\nhowever, large.\r\n\r\nDr. Muirhead estimated its static capacity at about 10 M.F., which\r\nsubsequent tests proved to be nearly correct.\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that this static capacity stood in the way of fast\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\nResistance and static capacity are the two factors that determine speed\r\nof signaling.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the variable state is in proportion to the square of the\r\nlength of the conductor, so that the difficulties increase very greatly\r\nas the wire is extended beyond ordinary limits. According to Prescott,\r\n\"The duration of the variable condition in a wire of 500 miles is\r\n250,000 times as long as in a wire of 1 mile.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, a long line _retains a charge_, and time must be allowed\r\nfor at least a falling off of the charge to a point indicated by the\r\nreceiving instrument as zero.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of the line care was taken to insure the _lowest\r\npossible resistance_ through the circuit, even to the furnishing of the\r\nriver cables with conductors weighing 500 lb. per mile.\r\n\r\nGround wires were placed on every tenth pole.\r\n\r\nWhen the first 100 miles of wire had been strung, I was much encouraged\r\nto find that we could telegraph without any difficulty past the average\r\nprovincial \"ground,\" provided the terminal grounds were good.\r\n\r\nWhen the western end of this remarkable wire reached Olean, N.Y., 400\r\nmiles from New York, my assistant, Mr. S.K. Dingle, proceeded to that\r\ntown with a receiving instrument, and we made the first test.\r\n\r\nI found that 800 words, or 20,000 impulses, per minute, could be\r\ntransmitted in Morse characters over that circuit _without compensation_\r\nfor static.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the old Bain method was competent to telegraph 800 words\r\nper minute on the 400 miles of 1.5 ohm wire.\r\n\r\nThe trouble began, however, when the wire reached Cleveland, O., about\r\n700 miles from New York.\r\n\r\nUpon making a test at Cleveland, I found the signals made a continuous\r\nblack line upon the chemical paper. I then placed both ends of the wire\r\nto earth through 3,000 ohms resistance, and introduced a small auxiliary\r\nbattery between the chemical paper and earth.\r\n\r\nThe auxiliary or opposing battery was placed in the same circuit with\r\nthe transmitting battery, and the currents which were transmitted from\r\nthe latter through the receiving instrument reached the earth by passing\r\ndirectly through the opposing battery.\r\n\r\nThe circuit of the opposing battery was permanently completed,\r\nindependently of the transmitting apparatus, through both branch\r\nconductors and artificial resistances.\r\n\r\nThe auxiliary battery at the receiving station normally maintained upon\r\nthe main line a continuous electric current of a negative polarity,\r\nwhich did not produce a mark upon the chemical paper.\r\n\r\nWhen the transmitting battery was applied thereto, the excessive\r\nelectro-motive force of the latter overpowered the current from the\r\nauxiliary battery and exerted, by means of a positive current, an\r\nelectro-chemical action upon the chemical receiving paper, producing a\r\nmark.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the interruption of the circuit of the transmitting\r\nbattery, the unopposed current from the auxiliary battery at the\r\nreceiving station flowed back through the paper and into the main line,\r\nthereby both neutralizing the residual or inductive current, which\r\ntended to flow through the receiving instrument, and serving to clear\r\nthe main line from electro-static charge.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram illustrates my method:\r\n\r\nReferring to this diagram, A and B respectively represent a transmitting\r\nand a receiving station of an automatic telegraph. These stations are\r\nunited in the usual manner by a main line, L. At the transmitting\r\nstation, A, is placed a transmitting battery, E, having its positive\r\npole connected by a conductor, 2, with the metallic transmitting drum,\r\nT. The negative pole of the battery, E, is connected with the earth at G\r\nby a conductor, 1. A metallic transmitting stylus, t, rests upon the\r\nsurface of the drum, T, and any well known or suitable mechanism may be\r\nemployed for causing an automatic transmitting pattern slip, P, to pass\r\nbetween the stylus and the drum. The transmitting or pattern slip, P, is\r\nperforated with groups of apertures of varying lengths and intervals as\r\nrequired to represent the dispatch which it is desired to transmit, by\r\nan arbitrary system of signs, such, for example, as the Morse\r\ntelegraphic code.\r\n\r\nAt the receiving station, B, is placed a recording apparatus, M, of any\r\nsuitable or well known construction. A strip of chemically prepared\r\npaper, N, is caused to pass rapidly and uniformly between the drum, M',\r\nand the stylus, m, of this instrument in a well known manner. The drum,\r\nM', is connected with the earth by conductors, 4 and 3, between which is\r\nplaced the auxiliary battery, E, the positive or marking pole of this\r\nbattery being connected with the drum and the negative pole with the\r\nearth. The electro-motive force of the battery, E', is preferably made\r\nabout one-third as great as that of the battery, E.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nExtending from a point, o, in the main line, near the transmitting\r\nstation, to the earth at G, is a branch conductor, l, containing an\r\nadjustable artificial resistance, R. A similar conductor, ll, extends\r\nfrom a point, o', near the receiving terminal of the line, L, to the\r\nconductor, 3, in which an artificial resistance, R', is also included,\r\nthis resistance being preferably approximately equal to the resistance,\r\nR. The proportions of the resistance of the main line and the artificial\r\nresistances which I prefer to employ may be approximately indicated as\r\nfollows: Assuming the resistance of the main line to be 900 ohms, the\r\nresistance, R, and R', should be each about 3,000 ohms. The main\r\nbattery, E, should then comprise about 90 cells, and the auxiliary\r\nbattery, E', 30 cells.\r\n\r\nThe operation of my improved system is as follows: While the apparatus\r\nis at rest a constant current from the battery, E', traverses the line,\r\nL, and the branch conductors, l, and ll, dividing itself between them,\r\nin inverse proportion to their respective resistances, in accordance\r\nwith the well-known law of Ohm. When the transmitting pattern strip, P,\r\nis caused to pass between the roller, T, and the stylus, t, electric\r\nimpulses will be transmitted upon the line, L, from the positive pole of\r\nthe battery, E, which will traverse the main line, L, the two branch\r\nlines, l, and ll, and their included resistances, and also the receiving\r\ninstrument, M. The greater portion of this current will, however, on\r\naccount of the less resistance offered, traverse the receiving\r\ninstrument, M, and the auxilary battery, E'. The current from the\r\nlast-named battery will thus be neutralized and overpowered, and the\r\nexcess of current from the main battery, E, will act upon the chemically\r\nprepared paper and record in the form of dots and dashes or like\r\narbitrary characters the impulses which are transmitted.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the cessation of each impulse, the auxiliary battery, E',\r\nagain acts to send an impulse of positive polarity through the receiving\r\npaper and stylus in the reverse direction and through the line, L, which\r\nreturns to the negative pole of the battery by way of the artificial\r\nresistances, R and R'. Such an impulse, following immediately upon the\r\ninterruption of the circuit of the transmitting battery, acts to destroy\r\nthe effect of the \"tailing\" or static discharge of the line, L, upon the\r\nreceiving instrument, and also to neutralize the same throughout the\r\nline. By thus opposing the discharge of the line by a reverse current\r\ntransmitted directly through the chemical paper, a sharply defined\r\nrecord will in all cases be obtained; and by transmitting the opposing\r\nimpulse through the line, the latter will be placed in a condition to\r\nreceive the next succeeding impulse and to record the same as a sharply\r\ndefined character.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was made on the New York-Cleveland circuit, and the\r\ncharacters were then clearly defined and of uniform distinctness. The\r\nspeed of transmission on this circuit was from 1,000 to 2,000 words per\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nUpon the completion of the wire to Chicago, total distance 1,050 miles,\r\nincluding six miles of No. 8 iron wire through the city, the maximum\r\nspeed was found to be 1,200 words per minute, and to my surprise the\r\nspeed was not affected by the substitution of an underground conductor\r\nfor the overhead wire.\r\n\r\nThe underground conductor was a No. 16 copper wire weighing 67 pounds\r\nper mile, in a Patterson cable laid through an iron pipe.\r\n\r\nI used 150 cells of large Fuller battery on the New York-Chicago\r\ncircuit, and afterward with 200 cells in first class condition,\r\ntransmitted 1,500 words, or 37,000 impulses, per minute from 49\r\nBroadway, New York, to our test office at Thirty-ninth Street, Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe matter was always carefully counted, and the utmost care taken to\r\nobtain correct figures.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned as a curious fact that we not only send 1,200 words\r\nper minute through 1,050 miles of overhead wire and five miles of\r\nunderground cable, but also through a second conductor in No. 2 cable\r\nback to Thirty-ninth Street, and then connected to a third underground\r\nconductor in No. 1 cable back to Chicago main office, in all about\r\nfifteen miles of underground, through which we sent 1,200 words per\r\nminute and had a splendid margin.--_Electrical World_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[ELECTRICAL REVIEW].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF THE ACTION OF THE CARBON MICROPHONE--WHAT IS IT?\r\n\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the opinions of scientific men given in the\r\ntelephone cases--before Lord McLaren in Edinburgh and before Mr. Justice\r\nFry in London--leads me to the conclusion that scientific men, at least\r\nthose whose opinions I shall quote, are not agreed as to what is the\r\naction of the carbon microphone.\r\n\r\nIn the Edinburgh case, Sir Frederick Bramwell said: \"The variations of\r\nthe currents are effected so as to produce with remarkable fidelity the\r\nvaried changes which occur, according as the carbon is compressed or\r\nrelieved from compression by the gentle impacts of the air set in motion\r\nby the voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"The most prominent quality of carbon is its capability, under the most\r\nminute differences of pressure, to enormously increase or decrease the\r\nresistances of the circuit.\" \"That the varying pressure of the black\r\ntension-regulator (Edison's) is sufficient to cause a change in the\r\nconducting power.\" Sir Frederick also said \"he could not believe that\r\nthe resistance was varied by a jolting motion; could not conceive a\r\njolting motion producing variation and difference of pressure, and such\r\nan instrument could not be relied on, and therefore would be practically\r\nuseless.\"\r\n\r\nSir William Thomson, in the same case, said: \"The function of the carbon\r\nis to give rise to diminished resistance by pressure; it possesses the\r\nquality of, under slight degrees of pressure, decreasing the resistance\r\nto the passage of the electric current;\" and, also, \"the jolting motion\r\nwould be a make-and-break, and the articulate sounds would be impaired.\r\nThere can be no virtue in a speaking telephone having a jolting motion.\"\r\n\"Delicacy of contact is a virtue; looseness of contact is a vice.\"\r\n\"Looseness of contact is a great virtue in Hughes' microphone;\" and \"the\r\nelements which work advantages in Hughes' are detrimental to the good\r\nworking of the articulating instrument.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nMr. Falconer King said: \"There would be no advantage in having a jolting\r\nmotion; the jolting motion would break the circuit and be a defect in\r\nthe speaking telephone,\" and \"you must have pressure and partially\r\nconducting substances.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Fleeming Jenkin said, \"The pressure of the carbons is what\r\nfavors the transmission of sound.\"\r\n\r\nAll the above named scientific men agree that variations of a current\r\npassing through a carbon microphone are produced by _pressure_ of the\r\ncarbons against one another, and they also agree that a jolting motion\r\ncould not be relied upon to reproduce articulate speech.\r\n\r\nMr. Conrad Cooke said, \"The first and most striking principle of Hughes'\r\nmicrophone is a shaking and variable contact between the two parts\r\nconstituting the microphone.\" \"The shaking and variable contact is\r\nproduced by the movable portion being effected by sound.\" \"Under Hughes'\r\nsystem, where gas carbon was used, the instruments could not possibly\r\nwork upon the principle of pressure.\" \"I am satisfied that it is not\r\npressure in the sense of producing a change of resistance.\" \"I do not\r\nthink pressure has anything to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Blyth said: \"The Hughes microphone depends essentially upon\r\nthe looseness or delicacy of contact.\" \"I have heard articulate speech\r\nwith such an instrument without a diaphragm.\" \"There is no doubt that to\r\na certain extent there must be a change in the number of points of\r\nsurface contact when the pencil is moved.\" \"The action of the Hughes\r\nmicrophone depends more or less upon the looseness or delicacy of the\r\ncontact and upon the changes in the number of points of surface contact\r\nwhen the pencil is moved.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Oliver Heaviside, in _The Electrician_ of 10th February last,\r\nwrites: \"There should be no jolting or scraping.\" \"Contacts, though\r\nlight, should not be loose.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nA writer, who signs \"W.E.H.,\" in _The Electrician_ of 24th February\r\nlast, says: \"The variation of current arises from a variation of\r\nconductivity between the electrodes, consequent upon the variation of\r\nthe closeness or pressure of contact;\" and also, \"there must be a\r\nvariation of pressure between the electrodes when the transmitter is in\r\naction.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems, then, that some scientific men agree that variation of\r\npressure is required to produce action in a microphone, and some of them\r\nadmit that a microphone with loose contacts will transmit articulate\r\nspeech, while others deny it, and some admit that a jolting or shaking\r\nmotion of the parts of the microphone does not interfere with articulate\r\nspeech, while others say such motion would break the circuit, and cannot\r\nbe relied on.\r\n\r\nI will now describe two microphones in which there is a shaking or\r\njolting motion, and loose contacts, and no variation of pressure of the\r\ncarbons against one another, and both of these microphones when used\r\nwith an induction coil and battery give most excellent articulation. One\r\nof these microphones is made as follows: Two flat plates of carbon are\r\nsecured to a block of cork, insulated from each other; into a hole of\r\neach carbon a pin of carbon fits loosely, projecting above the carbons;\r\nanother flat piece of carbon, having two holes in it, bridges over the\r\ntwo lower carbons, being kept in its place by the pins of carbon which\r\nfit loosely in the holes in it, the bottom carbons being connected with\r\nthe battery; a block of cork has a flat side of it cut out so as when\r\nsecured to the lower cork the carbons will not come in contact with it,\r\nyet be close enough to it to keep the carbons from falling apart. The\r\ncork covering the carbons forms a dome.\r\n\r\nAny good telephone receiver when used in connection with this\r\nmicrophone, reproduces articulate speech with remarkable distinctness,\r\nespecially hissing sounds, and with a loud and full tone.\r\n\r\nA description of this microphone was published in _La Lumiere\r\nElectrique_, of 15th April, 1882, and a drawing thereof on 29th April of\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\nAnother form of microphone is made as follows: Two blocks of gas carbon,\r\nC, B, each about one and a half inches long and one inch square, having\r\neach a circular hole one and a quarter inches deep and half inch in\r\ndiameter; these two blocks are embedded in a block of cork, C, about\r\none-quarter of an inch apart, these holes facing each other, each block\r\nforming a terminal of the battery and induction coil; a pencil of\r\ncarbon, C, P, about three-eighths of an inch in diameter, and two inches\r\nlong, having a ring of ebonite, V, fixed around its center, is placed in\r\nthe holes of the two fixed blocks; the ebonite ring fitting loosely in\r\nbetween the two blocks so as to prevent the pencil from touching the\r\nbottom of the holes in the blocks. The space between the blocks is\r\nclosed with wax, W, to exclude the air, but not to touch the ring on the\r\npencil. A block of cork fitting close to the carbon blocks on all sides\r\nis then firmly secured to the other block of cork. The microphone should\r\nlie horizontally or at a slight angle.\r\n\r\nThis microphone produces in any good telephone perfect articulation in a\r\nloud and full tone. In these microphones there is certainly \"looseness\r\nand delicacy of contact,\" and there is a \"jolting or shaking motion,\"\r\nand it does not seem possible that there can be any \"pressure of one\r\ncarbon against another.\"\r\n\r\nI repeat the question I asked at the beginning of this communication,\r\nand hope that it may elicit from you, or some of our scientific men, an\r\nexplanation of the theory of the action of this form of microphone.\r\n\r\nW.C. BARNEY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEMBINSKI MICROPHONIC TELEPHONE TRANSMITTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, which is shown by Figs. 1, 2, and 3, consists of a\r\nwooden case, A, of oblong shape, closed by a lid fixed by hinges to the\r\ntop or one side of the case. The lid is actually a frame for holding a\r\npiece of wire gauze, L L, through which the sound waves from the voice\r\ncan pass. In the case a flat shallow box, E F (or several boxes), is\r\nplaced, on the lid of which the carbon microphone, D C (Figs. 1 and 3),\r\nwhich is of the ordinary construction, is placed. The box is of thin\r\nwood, coated inside with petroleum lamp black, for the purpose of\r\nincreasing the resonance. It is secured in two lateral slides, fixed to\r\nthe case. The bottom of the box is pierced with two openings, resembling\r\nthose in a violin (Fig. 2). Lengthwise across the bottom are stretched a\r\nseries of brass spiral springs, G G G, which are tuned to a chromatic\r\nscale. On the bottom of the case a similar series of springs, not shown,\r\nare secured. The apparatus is provided with an induction coil, J, which\r\nis connected to the microphone, battery, and telephone receiver (which\r\nmay be of any known description) in the usual manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe inventors claim that the use of the vibrating springs give to the\r\ntransmitter an increased power over those at present in use. They state\r\nthat the instrument has given very satisfactory results between Ostende\r\nand Arlon, a distance of 314 kilometers (about 200 miles). It does not\r\nappear, however, that microphones of the ordinary Gower-Bell type, for\r\nexample, were tried in competition with the new invention, and in the\r\nabsence of such tests the mere fact that very satisfactory results were\r\nobtained over a length of 200 miles proves very little. With reference\r\nto a statement that whistling could be very clearly heard, we may remark\r\nthat experience has many times proved that the most indifferent form of\r\ntransmitter will almost always respond well and even powerfully to such\r\nforms of vibration.--_Electrical Review_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW GAS LIGHTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are going to make known to our readers two new styles of electric\r\nlighters whose operation is sure and quick, and the use of which is just\r\nas economical as that of those quasi-incombustible little pieces of wood\r\nthat we have been using for some years under the name of matches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--MODE OF USING THE GAS LIGHTER.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these is a portable apparatus designed for lighting gas\r\nburners, and is based upon the calorific properties of the electric\r\nspark produced by the induction bobbin. Its internal arrangement is such\r\nas to permit of its being used with a pile of very limited power and\r\ndimensions. The apparatus has the form of a rod of a length that may be\r\nvaried at will, according to the height of the burner to be lighted, and\r\nwhich terminates at its lower part in an ebonite handle about 4\r\ncentimeters in width by 20 in length (Fig. 1). This handle is divided\r\ninto two parts, which are shown isolatedly in Fig. 2, and contains the\r\npile and bobbin. The arrangement of the pile, A, is kept secret, and all\r\nthat we can say of it is that zinc and chloride of silver are employed\r\nas a depolarizer. It is hermetically closed, and carries at one of its\r\nextremities a disk, B, and a brass ring, C, attached to its poles and\r\ndesigned to establish a communication between the pile and bobbin when\r\nthe two parts of the apparatus are screwed together. To this end, two\r\nelastic pieces, D and E, fit against B and C and establish a contact. It\r\nis asserted that the pile is capable of being used 25,000 times before\r\nit is necessary to recharge it. H is an ebonite tube that incloses and\r\nprotects the induction bobbin, K, whose induced wire communicates on the\r\none hand with the brass tube, L, and on the other with an insulated\r\ncentral conductor, M, which terminates at a point very near the\r\nextremity of the brass tube. The currents induced in this wire produce a\r\nseries of sparks between the tube, L, and the rod, M, which light the\r\ngas when the extremity of the apparatus is placed in proximity with the\r\nburner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. MECHANISM OR THE INDUCTION SPARK GAS LIGHTER.]\r\n\r\nThe ingenious and new part of the system lies in the mode of exciting\r\nthe induced currents. When the extremity of the tube, L, is brought near\r\nthe gas burner that is to be lighted, it is only necessary to shove the\r\nbotton, F, from left to right in order to produce a _limited_ number of\r\nsparks sufficient to effect the lighting. The motion of the button has\r\nnot for effect, as might be believed, the closing of the circuit of the\r\npile upon the inducting circuit of the bobbin. In fact in its normal\r\nposition, the vibrator is distant from its contact, and the closing of\r\nthe circuit would produce no action. The motion of F produces a\r\n_mechanical_ motion of the spring of the vibrator, which latter acts for\r\na few instants and produces a certain number of contacts that give rise\r\nto an equal number of sparks. Owing to this arrangement, the expenditure\r\nof electric energy required by each lighting is limited; and, an another\r\nhand, the vibrator, which would be incapable of operating if it had to\r\nbe set in motion by the direct current from the pile, can be actuated\r\n_mechanically_. As the motion of the vibrator is derived from the hand\r\nof the operator, and not from the pile, it will be comprehended that the\r\nlatter can, everything being equal, produce a larger number of lightings\r\nthan an ordinary bobbin and vibrator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--INCANDESCENT GAS LIGHTER.]\r\n\r\nDr. Naret's _Fiat Lux_ (Fig. 3) is simpler in its operation, and cheaper\r\nof application, since it takes its current from the ordinary piles that\r\nsupply domestic call-bells. It consists essentially of a fine platinum\r\nwire supported by a tilting device in connection with the two poles of a\r\npile composed of three Leclanche elements. Upon exerting a vertical\r\npressure on the button placed to the left of the apparatus, either\r\ndirectly or by means of a cord, we at the same time turn the cock and\r\ncause the platinum spiral to approach, and the latter then becomes\r\nincandescent as a consequence of the closing of the circuit of the pile.\r\nAfter the burner is lighted it is only necessary to leave the apparatus\r\nto itself. The cock remains open, the spiral recedes from the burner,\r\nthe circuit opens anew, and the burner remains lighted until the gas is\r\nturned off. This device, then, is particularly appropriate in all cases\r\nwhere there is a pressing need of light, for a single maneuver suffices\r\nto open the cock and effect a lighting of the burner.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF HEAT WHICH IS DEVELOPED BY FORGING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of June. 1874, Tresca presented to the French Academy some\r\nconsiderations respecting the distribution of heat in forging a bar of\r\nplatinum, and stated the principal reasons which rendered that metal\r\nespecially suitable for the purpose. He subsequently experimented, in a\r\nsimilar way, with other metals, and finally adopted Senarmont's method\r\nfor the study of conductibility. A steel or copper bar was carefully\r\npolished on its lateral faces, and the polished portion covered with a\r\nthin coat of wax. The bar thus prepared was placed under a ram, of known\r\nweight, P, which was raised to a height, H, where it was automatically\r\nreleased so as to expend upon the bar the whole quantity of work _T=PH,_\r\nbetween the two equal faces of the ram and the anvil. A single shock\r\nsufficed to melt the wax upon a certain zone and thus to limit, with\r\ngreat sharpness, the part of the lateral faces which had been raised\r\nduring the shock to the temperature of melting wax. Generally the zone\r\nof fusion imitates the area comprised between the two branches of an\r\nequilateral hyperbola, but the fall can be so graduated as to restrict\r\nthis zone, which then takes other forms, somewhat different, but always\r\nsymmetrical. If A is the area of this zone, b the breadth of the bar, d\r\nthe density of the metal, c its capacity for heat, and t-t0 the excess\r\nof the melting temperature of wax over the surrounding temperature, it\r\nis evident that, if we consider A as the base of a horizontal prism\r\nwhich is raised to the temperature t, the calorific effect may be\r\nexpressed by:\r\n\r\n  Ab x d x C(t-t0);\r\n\r\nand on multiplying this quantity of heat by 425 we find, for the value\r\nof its equivalent in work,\r\n\r\n  T' = 425 AbdC(t-t0).\r\n\r\nOn comparing T' to T we may consider the experiment as a mechanical\r\noperation, having a minimum of:\r\n\r\n  T'/T = (425/PH)AbdC(t-t0).\r\n\r\nAfter giving diagrams and tables to illustrate the geometrical\r\ndisposition of the areas of fusion, Tresca feels justified in concluding\r\nthat the development of heat depends upon the form of the faces and the\r\nintensity of the shock; that the points of greatest heat correspond to\r\nthe points of greatest flow of the metal, and that this flow is really\r\nthe mechanical phenomenon which gives rise to the calorific phenomenon;\r\nthat for action sufficiently energetic and for bars of sufficient\r\ndimensions, about 0.8 of the labor expended on the blow may be found\r\nagain in the heat; that the figures formed in the melted wax for shocks\r\nof less intensity furnish a kind of diagram of the distribution of the\r\nheat and of the deformation in the interior of the bar, but that the\r\ncalculation of the coefficient of efficiency does not yield satisfactory\r\nresults in the case of moderate blows.--_Comptes Rendus_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIN IN CANNED FOODS.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Read at an evening meeting of the Pharmaceutical Society,\r\nMarch 5, 1884.]\r\n\r\nBy PROFESSOR ATTFIELD, F.R.S., ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, during the past twelve years, paragraphs have\r\nappeared in newspapers and other periodicals tending in effect to warn\r\nthe public at least against the indiscriminate use of canned foods. And\r\nwhenever there has been any foundation in fact for such cautions, it has\r\ncommonly rested on the alleged presence and harmfulness of tin in the\r\nfood. At the worst, the amount of tin present has been absurdly small,\r\naffording an opportunity for one literary representative of medicine to\r\nstate that before a man could be seriously affected by the tin, even if\r\nit occurred in the form of a compound of the metal, he would have to\r\nconsume at a meal ten pounds of the food containing the largest amount\r\nof tin ever detected.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest proportions of tin thus referred to are, according to\r\nmy experiments, far beyond those ever likely to be actually present in\r\nthe food itself in the form of a compound of tin; present, that is to\r\nsay, on account of the action of the fluids or juices of the food on the\r\ntin of the can. Such action and such consequent solution of the tin, and\r\nconsequent admixture of a possibly assimilable compound of tin with the\r\nfood, in my opinion never occurs to an extent which in relation to\r\nhealth has any significance whatever. The occurrence of tin, not as a\r\ncompound, but as the metal itself, is, if possible, still less\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fifteen years I have frequently examined canned foods,\r\nnot only with respect to the food itself as food, and to the process of\r\ncanning, but with regard to the relation of the food to, or the\r\ninfluence if any of the metal of, the can itself. So lately as within\r\nthe past two or three months I have examined sixteen varieties of canned\r\nfood for metals, with the following results:\r\n\r\n                                  Decimal parts of\r\n                                    a grain of tin\r\n                                 (or other foreign\r\n                                 metal) present in\r\n  Name of article               a quarter of a lb.\r\n  examined.\r\n\r\n  Salmon                               none.\r\n  Lobsters                             none.\r\n  Oysters                              0.004\r\n  Sardines                             none.\r\n  Lobster paste                        none.\r\n  Salmon paste                         none.\r\n  Bloater paste                        0.002\r\n  Potted beef                          none.\r\n  Potted tongue                        none.\r\n  Potted \"Strasbourg\"                  none.\r\n  Potted ham                           0.002\r\n  Luncheon tongue                      0.003\r\n  Apricots                             0.007\r\n  Pears                                0.003\r\n  Tomatoes                             0.007\r\n  Peaches                              0.004\r\n\r\nThese proportions of metal are, I say, undeserving of serious notice. I\r\nquestion whether they represent more than the amounts of tin we\r\nperiodically wear off tin saucepans in preparing food--a month ago I\r\nfound a trace of tin in water which had been boiled in a tin kettle--or\r\nthe silver we wear off our forks and spoons. There can be little doubt\r\nthat we annually pass through our systems a sensible amount of such\r\nmetals, metallic compounds, and other substances that do not come under\r\nthe denomination of food; but there is no evidence that they ever did or\r\nare ever likely to do harm or occasion us the slightest inconvenience.\r\nHarm is far more likely to come to us from noxious gases in the air we\r\nbreathe than from foreign substances in the food we eat.\r\n\r\nBut whence come the much less minute amounts of tin--still harmless, be\r\nit remembered--which have been stated to be occasionally present in\r\ncanned foods? They come from the minute particles of metal chipped off\r\nfrom the tin sheets in the operations of cutting, bending, or hammering\r\nthe parts of the can, or possibly melted off in the operations necessary\r\nfor the soldering together of the joints of the can. Some may, perhaps,\r\nbe cut, off by the knife in opening a can. At all events I not\r\nunfrequently find such minute particles of metal on carefully washing\r\nthe external surfaces of a mass of meat just removed from a can, or on\r\notherwise properly treating canned food with the object of detecting\r\nsuch particles. The published processes for the detection of tin in\r\ncanned food will not reveal more than the amounts stated in the table,\r\nor about those amounts; that is to say, a few thousandths or perhaps two\r\nor three hundredths of a grain, if this precaution be adopted. If such\r\ncare be not observed, the less minute amounts may be found. I did not\r\ndetect any metallic particles in the twelve samples of canned food just\r\nmentioned, but during the past few years I have occasionally found small\r\npieces of metal, perhaps amounting in some of the cases to a few tenths\r\nof a grain per pound. Now and then small shot-like pieces of tin, or\r\npossibly solder, may be met with; but no one has ever found, to my\r\nknowledge, such a quantity of actual metallic tin, tinned iron, or\r\nsolder as, from the point of view of health, can have any significance\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe largest amount of tin I ever detected in actual solution in food was\r\nin some canned soup, containing a good deal of lemon juice. It amounted\r\nto only three-hundredths of a grain in a half pint of the soup as sent\r\nto table. Now, Christison says that quantities of 18 to 44 grains of the\r\nvery soluble chloride of tin were required to kill dogs in from one to\r\nfour days. Orfila says that several persons on one occasion dressed\r\ntheir dinner with chloride of tin, mistaking it for salt. One person\r\nwould thus take not less than 20 to 30 grains of this soluble compound\r\nof tin. Yet only a little gastric and bowel disturbance followed, and\r\nfrom this all recovered in a few days. Pereira says that the dose of\r\nchloride of tin as an antispasmodic and stimulant is from 1/16 to ½ a\r\ngrain repeated two or three times daily. Probably no article of canned\r\nfood, not even the most acid fruit, if in a condition in which it can be\r\neaten, has ever contained, in an ordinary table portion, as much of a\r\nsoluble salt of tin as would amount to a harmless or useful medicinal\r\ndose.\r\n\r\nMetallic particles of tin are without any effect on man. A thousand\r\ntimes the quantity ever found in a can of tinned food would do no harm.\r\n\r\nFood as acid as say ordinary pickles would dissolve tin. Some\r\nmanufacturers once proposed using tin stoppers to their bottles of\r\npickles. But the tin was slowly dissolved by the acid of the vinegar.\r\nThese pickles, however, had a distinctly nasty \"metallic\" flavor. The\r\nidea was abandoned. Probably any article of food containing enough tin\r\nto disagree with the system would be too nasty to eat. Purchasers of\r\nfood may rest assured that the action taken by this firm would be that\r\nusually followed. It is not to the interest of manufacturers or other\r\nvenders to offend the senses of purchasers, still less to do them actual\r\nharm, even if no higher motive comes into force.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of canning, it is just possible that the use of\r\n\"spirits of salt\" in soldering may have resulted in the presence of a\r\nlittle stannous, plumbous, or other chloride in canned food; but such a\r\nfault would soon be detected and corrected, and as a matter of fact,\r\nresin-soldering is to my knowledge more generally employed--indeed, for\r\nanything I know to the contrary, is exclusively employed--in canning\r\nfood. Any resin that trained access would be perfectly harmless. It is\r\njust possible, also, that formerly the tin itself may have contained\r\nlead, but I have not found any lead in the sheet tin used for canning of\r\nlate years.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion: 1. I have never been able to satisfy myself that a can of\r\nordinary tinned food contains even a useful medicinal dose of such a\r\ntrue soluble _compound_ of tin as is likely to have any effect on man.\r\n2. As for the metal itself, that is the filings or actual metallic\r\nparticles or fragments, one ounce is a common dose as a vermifuge;\r\nharmless even in that quantity to man, and not always so harmful as\r\ncould be desired to the parasites for whose disestablishment it is\r\nadministered. One ounce might be contained in about four hundredweight\r\nof canned food. 3. If a possibly harmful quantity of a soluble compound,\r\nof tin be placed in a portion of canned food, the latter will be so\r\nnasty and so unlike any ordinary nasty flavor, so \"metallic,\" in fact,\r\nthat no sane person will eat it. 4. Respecting the globules of solder\r\n(lead and tin) that are occasionally met with in canned food, I believe\r\nmost persons detect them in the mouth and remove them, as they would\r\nshots in game. But if swallowed, they do no harm. Pereira says that\r\nmetallic lead is probably inert, and that nearly a quarter of a pound\r\nhas been administered to a dog without any obvious effects. He goes on\r\nto say that as it becomes oxidized it occasionally acquires activity,\r\nquoting Paulini's statement that colic was produced in a patient who had\r\nswallowed a leaden bullet. To allay alarm in the minds of those who fear\r\nthey might swallow pellets of solder, I may add that Pereira cites\r\nProust for the assurance that an alloy of tin and lead is less easily\r\noxidized than pure lead. 5. Unsoundness in meat does not appear to\r\npromote the corrosion or solution of tin. I have kept salmon in cans\r\ntill it was putrid, testing it occasionally for tin. No trace of tin was\r\ndetected. Nevertheless, food should not be allowed to remain for a few\r\ndays, or even hours, in saucepans, metal baking pans, or opened tins or\r\ncans, otherwise it _may_ taste metallic. 6. Unsound food, canned or\r\nuncanned, may, of course, injure health, and where canned food really\r\nhas done harm, the harm has in all probability been due to the food and\r\nnot to the can. 7. What has been termed idiosyncrasy must also be borne\r\nin mind. I know a man to whom oatmeal is a poison. Some people cannot\r\neat lobsters, either fresh or tinned. Serious results have followed the\r\neating of not only oatmeal or shell fish, but salmon and mutton;\r\n_hydrate_ (misreported _nitrate_) of tin being gratuitously suggested as\r\nbeing contained in the salmon in one case. Possibly there were cases of\r\nidiosyncrasy in the eater, possibly the food was unsound, possibly other\r\ncauses altogether led to the results, but certainly, to my mind, the tin\r\nhad nothing whatever to do with the matter.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, given after well weighing all evidence hitherto\r\nforthcoming, the public have not the faintest cause for alarm respecting\r\nthe occurrence of tin, lead, or any other metal in canned foods.--_Phar.\r\nJour, and Trans., March 8, 1884, p. 719_.\r\n\r\n[In reference to Prof. Attfield's statement contained in the closing\r\nparagraph, we remark: It is well known that mercury is an ingredient of\r\nthe solder used in some canning concerns, as it makes an easier melting\r\nand flowing solder.

Of course the\r\nAmericans, being young, and having come to the fore, so to speak,\r\nfull-fledged, have been able to profit by the lessons which they have\r\nderived from their neighbors--though it is none the less to their credit\r\nthat they have profited so well and so quickly. Technical and industrial\r\neducation has received a more general recognition, and been developed\r\nmore rapidly, than the general education of the country, partly for the\r\nreason that there is no uniform system of the latter throughout the\r\nStates, but that each individual State and Territory does that which is\r\nright in its own eyes. The principal reason, however, is that to possess\r\nthe knowledge, how to work is the first creed of the American, who\r\nconsiders that the right to obtain that knowledge is the birthright of\r\nevery citizen, and especially when the manual labor has to be\r\nsupplemented by a vigorous use of brains. The Americans as a rule do not\r\nlike heavy or coarse manual labor, thinking it beneath them; and,\r\nindeed, when they can get Irish and Chinese to do it for them, perhaps\r\nthey are not far wrong. But the idea of idleness and loafing is very far\r\nfrom the spirit of the country, and this is why we see the necessity for\r\nindustrial education so vigorously recognized, both as a national duty,\r\nand by private individuals or communities of individuals.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever source it is provided, technical education in the United\r\nStates comes mainly within the scope of two classes of institutions,\r\nviz., agricultural and mechanical colleges; although the two are, as\r\noften as not, combined under one establishment, and particularly it\r\nforms the subject of a national grant. Indeed, it may be said that the\r\nscope of industrial education embraces three classes: the farmer, the\r\nmechanic, and the housekeeper; and in the far West we find that\r\nprovision is made for the education of these three classes in the same\r\nschools, it being an accepted idea in the newer States that man and\r\nwoman (the housekeeper) are coworkers, and are, therefore, entitled to\r\nequal and similar educational privileges. On the other hand, in the more\r\nconservative East and South, we find that the sexes are educated\r\ndistinct from each other. In the East, there is generally, also, a\r\nseparation of subjects. In Massachusetts, for instance, the colleges of\r\nagriculture and mechanics are separate affairs, the students being\r\ntaught in different institutions, viz., the agricultural college and the\r\ninstitute of technology. In Missouri the separation is less defined, the\r\nSchool of Mines and Metallurgy being the, only part that is distinct\r\nfrom the other departments of the University.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief reasons for the necessity for hastening the extension\r\nof technical education in America was the almost entire disappearance of\r\nthe apprenticeship system, which, in itself, is mainly due to the\r\nsubdivision of labor so prevalent in the manufacture of everything, from\r\npins to locomotives. The increased use of machinery, the character of\r\nwhich is such as often to put an end to small enterprises, has promoted\r\nthis subdivision by accumulating workmen in large groups. The beginner,\r\nconfining himself to one department, is soon able to earn wages, and so\r\nhe usually continues as he begins. Mr. C.B. Stetson has written on this\r\nsubject with great force and earnestness, and it will not be amiss to\r\nquote a sentence as to the advantages enjoyed by the technically\r\nworkman. He says that \"it is the rude or dexterous workman, rather than\r\nthe really skilled one, who is supplanted by machinery. Skilled labor\r\nrequires thinking; but a machine never thinks, never judges, never\r\ndiscriminates. Though its employment does, indeed, enable rude laborers\r\nto do many things now which formerly could only be done by dexterous\r\nworkmen, it is clear that its use has decidedly increased the relative\r\ndemand for skilled labor as compared with unskilled, and there is\r\nabundant room for an additional increase, if it is true, as declared by\r\nthe most eminent authority, that the power now expended can be readily\r\nmade to yield three or four times its present results, and ultimately\r\nten or twenty times, when masters and workmen can be had with sufficient\r\nintelligence and skill for the direction and manipulation of the tools\r\nand machinery that would be invented.\"\r\n\r\nThe establishment of colleges and universities by the aid of national\r\ngrants has depended very much for their character upon the industrial\r\ntendencies of the respective States, it being understood that the land\r\ngrants have principally been given to those of the newer States and\r\nTerritories which required development, although some of the\r\ninstitutions of the older States on the Atlantic seaboard have also been\r\nrecipients of the same fund, which in itself only dates from an act of\r\nCongress in 1862. In California and Missouri, both States abounding in\r\nmineral resources, there are courses in mining and metallurgy provided\r\nin the institutions receiving national aid. In the great grain-producing\r\nsections of the Mississippi Valley the colleges are principally devoted\r\nto agriculture, whereas the characteristic feature of the Iowa and\r\nKansas schools is the prominence given to industries.\r\n\r\nWe need not devote attention to the aims and arrangements of the\r\nagricultural colleges proper, but will pass at once to those which deal\r\nwith the mechanical arts, dealing first of all with those that are\r\nassisted by the national land grant. Taking them alphabetically, we have\r\nfirst the State Agricultural College of Colorado, in the mechanical and\r\ndrawing department of which shops for bench work in wood and iron and\r\nfor forging have been recently erected, this institution being one of\r\nthe newest in America. In the Illinois Industrial University the student\r\nof mechanical engineering receives practice in five shops devoted to\r\npattern-making, blacksmithing, moulding and founding, benchwork for\r\niron, and machine tool-work for iron. In the first shop the practice\r\nconsists of planing, chiseling, turning, and the preparation of patterns\r\nfor casting. The ordinary blacksmithing operations take place in the\r\nsecond shop, and those of casting in the third. In the fourth there is,\r\nfirst of all, a course of freehand benchwork, and afterward the fitting\r\nof parts is undertaken. In the fifth shop all the fundamental operations\r\non iron by machinery are practiced, the actual work being carefully\r\noutlined beforehand by drawings. This department of the University\r\nconsists, in point of fact, of three separate schools, destined to\r\nqualify the student for every kind of engineering--mining, railway,\r\nmechanical, and architectural. In addition to the shops and machine\r\nrooms, there are well furnished cabinets of geological and mineralogical\r\nspecimens, chemical laboratories for assaying and metallurgy, stamp\r\nmill, furnaces, etc., and, in fact, every known vehicle for practical\r\ninstruction. The school of architecture prepares students for the\r\nbuilding profession. Among the subjects in this branch are office work\r\nand shop practice, constructing joints in carpentry and joinery, cabinet\r\nmaking and turning, together with modeling in clay. The courses in\r\nmathematics, mechanics and physics are the same as those in the\r\nengineering school; but the technical studies embrace drawing from\r\ncasts, wood, stone, brick, and iron construction, turners' work,\r\nslating, plastering, painting, and plumbing, architectural drawing and\r\ndesigning, the history and aesthetics of architecture, estimates,\r\nagreements specification, heating, lighting, draining, and ventilation.\r\nThe student's work from scale drawing occupies three terms, carpentry\r\nand joinery being taught in the first year, turning and cabinet making\r\nin the second, metal and stone work in the third. A more condensed\r\ncourse, known as the builder's course, is given to those who can only\r\nstop one year. The machine shop has a steam engine of 16 horse power,\r\ntwo engines and three plain lathes, a planer, a large drill press, a\r\npattern shop, a blacksmith's shop, all of the machinery having been\r\nbuilt on the spot. The carpenter's shop is likewise supplied with\r\nnecessary machine tools, such as saws, planers, tenoning machine,\r\nwhittlers, etc., the power being furnished by the machine shop. At the\r\ndate of the last University report, there were 41 students in the\r\ncourses of mechanical engineering, 41 in those of civil engineering, 3\r\nin mining engineering, and 14 in architecture. Tuition is free in all\r\nthe University classes, though each student has to pay a matriculation\r\nfee of $10, and the incidental expenses amount to about $23 annually. He\r\nis charged for material used or apparatus broken, but not for the\r\nordinary wear and tear of instruments. It should be mentioned that the\r\nendowment of the Illinois Industrial University is from scrip received\r\nfrom the Government for 480,000 acres of land, of which 454,460 have\r\nbeen sold for $319,178. The real estate of the University, partly made\r\nup by donations and partly by appropriations made in successive sessions\r\nby the State of Illinois, is estimated at $450,000.\r\n\r\nThe Purdue University in Indiana, named after its founder, who gave\r\n$150,000, which was supplemented by another $50,000 from the State and a\r\nbond grant of 390,000 acres, also provides a very complete mechanical\r\ncourse, with shop instruction, divided as follows:\r\n\r\n  Bench working in wood    for 12 weeks, or 120 hours.\r\n  Wood-turning              \"   4   \"     \"  40  \"\r\n  Pattern-making            \"  12   \"     \" 120  \"\r\n  Vise-work in iron         \"  10   \"     \" 100  \"\r\n  Forging in iron and steel \"  18   \"     \" 180  \"\r\n  Machine tool-work in iron \"  20   \"     \" 200  \"\r\n\r\nThe course in carpentry and joinery embraces: 1. Exercising in sawing\r\nand planing to dimensions. 2 Application, or box nailed together. 3\r\nMortise and tenon joints; a plain mortise and tenon; an open dovetailed\r\nmortise and tenon (dovetailed halving); a dovetailed keyed mortise and\r\ntenon. 4. Splices. 5. Common dovetailing. 6. Lap dovetailing and\r\nrabbeting. 7. Blind or secret dovetail. 8. Miter-box. 9. Carpenter's\r\ntrestle. 10. Panel door. 11. Roof truss. 12. Section of king-post truss\r\nroof. 13. Drawing model.\r\n\r\nThe course in wood turning includes: 1. Elementary principles: first,\r\nstraight turning; second, cutting in; third, convex curves with the\r\nchisel; fourth, compound curves formed with the gouge. 2. File and\r\nchisel handles. 3. Mallets. 4. Picture frames (chuck work). 5. Card\r\nreceiver (chuck work). 6. Watch safe (chuck work). 7. Ball.\r\n\r\nIn the pattern-making course the student is supposed to have some skill\r\nin bench and lathe work, which will be increased; the direct object\r\nbeing to teach what forms of pattern are in general necessary, and how\r\nthey must be constructed in order to get a perfect mould from them. The\r\ncharacter of the work differs each year. For instance, for the last\r\nyear, besides simpler patterns easily drawn from the sand, such as\r\nglands, ball-cranks, etc., there were a series of flanged pipe-joints\r\nfor 2½ in. pipes, including the necessary core boxes; also pulley\r\npatterns from 6 in. to 10 in. diameter, built in segments for strength,\r\nand to prevent warping and shrinkage; and, lastly, a complete set of\r\npatterns for a three horse-power horizontal steam engine, all made from\r\ndrawings of the finished piece. In the vise work in iron, the chief\r\nrequirements are these: 1, given a block of cast iron 4 in. by 2 in. by\r\n1½ in. in thickness, to reduce the thickness ¼ in. by chipping, and then\r\nfinishing with the file; 2, to file a round hole square; 3, to file a\r\nround hole into elliptical; 4, given a 3 in. cube of wrought iron, to\r\ncut a spline 3 in. by 3/8 in. by ¼ in., and second, when the under side\r\nis a one half round hollow--these two cuts involve the use of the cope\r\nchisel and the round nose chisel, and are examples of very difficult\r\nchipping; 5, round tiling or hand-vise work; 6, scraping; 7, special\r\nexamples of fitting. In the forging classes are elementary processes,\r\ndriving, bending, and upsetting; courses in welding; miscellaneous\r\nforging; steel forging, including hardening and tempering in all its\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that in the industrial art school of the Purdue\r\nUniversity there were 13 of the fair sex as students, besides one in the\r\nchemical school, and two going through the mechanical courses just\r\ndetailed, showing that the scope of woman's industry is less limited in\r\nAmerica than in England. The Iowa State Agricultural College has also\r\ntwo departments of mechanical and civil engineering, the former\r\nincluding a special course of architecture. The workshop practice, which\r\noccupies three forenoons of 2½ hours each per week, is, however, of more\r\ngeneral character, and is not pursued with such a regard to any special\r\ncalling as in the case of the Purdue University.\r\n\r\nThe Kansas State Agricultural College has a course of carpentry, though\r\ndesigned rather more to meet the everyday necessities of a farmer's\r\nlife. In fact, all the students are obliged to attend these classes, and\r\ntake the same first lessons in sawing, planing, lumber dressing, making\r\nmortises, tenons, and joints, and in general use of tools--just the kind\r\nof instruction that every English lad should have before he is shipped\r\noff to the Colonies. This farmer's course in the Kansas College provides\r\nfor a general training in mechanical handiwork, but facilities are given\r\nalso to those who wish to follow out the trade, and special instruction\r\nis provided in the whole range of work, from framing to stair-building,\r\nas also in iron work, such as ordinary forging, filing, tempering, etc.\r\nOf the students attending this college, 75 percent, are from farmers'\r\nhomes, and the majority of the remainder from the families of mechanics\r\nand tradesmen.\r\n\r\nThe State College of Maine provides courses for both civil and\r\nmechanical engineers, and has two shops equipped according to the\r\nRussian system. Forge and vise work are taught in them, though it is not\r\nthe object of the college so much to teach the details of any one trade\r\nas to qualify students by general knowledge to undertake any of them\r\nafterward. A much more complete and thorough technical education is\r\ngiven in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology at Boston, where\r\nthere are distinct classes for civil, mechanical, mining, geological,\r\nand architectural engineering. The following are the particulars of the\r\ninstruction in the architectural branch, which commences in the\r\nstudent's second year, with Greek, Roman, and Mediæval architectural\r\nhistory, the Orders and their applications, drawing, sketching, and\r\ntracing, analytic geometry, differential calculus, physics, descriptive\r\ngeometry, botany, and physical geography. In the third year the course\r\nis extended to the theory of decoration, color, form, and proportion;\r\nconventionalism, symbolism, the decorative arts, stained glass, fresco\r\npainting, tiles, terra-cotta, original designs, specifications, integral\r\ncalculus, strength of materials, dynamics, bridges and roofs,\r\nstereotomy. In the fourth year the student is turned out a finished\r\narchitect, after a course of the history of ornament, the theory of\r\narchitecture, stability of structure, flow of gases, shopwork\r\n(carpentry), etc.\r\n\r\nThe number of students in this very comprehensive Institute of\r\nTechnology was, by the latest report, 390, of whom 138 were undergoing\r\nspecial courses, 39 were in the schools of mechanical art, and 49 in the\r\nLowell School of Practical Design. Tuition is charged at the rate of 200\r\ndols. for the institute proper, and 150 dols. for the mechanical\r\nschools, the average expenses per student being about 254 dols. There\r\nare 10 free scholarships, of which two are given for mechanical art. The\r\nLowell School has been established by the trustee of the Lowell\r\nInstitute to afford free technical education, under the auspices of the\r\nInstitute of Technology, to both sexes--a large number of young women\r\navailing themselves of it in connection with their factory work at\r\nLowell. The courses include practical designs for manufactures, and the\r\nart of making patterns for prints, delaines, silks, paperhangings,\r\ncarpets, oilcloth, etc., and the school is amply provided with pattern\r\nlooms. Indeed, the whole of the appliances for practical teaching at the\r\nInstitute are on such a complete scale that at the risk of being a\r\nlittle tedious it is as well to enumerate them. They comprise\r\nlaboratories devoted to chemistry, mineralogy, metallurgy, and\r\nindustrial chemistry; there are also microscopic, spectroscopic, and\r\norganic laboratories. In other branches there are laboratories and\r\nmuseums of steam engineering, mining, and metallurgy, biology and\r\narchitecture, together with an observatory, much used in connection with\r\ngeodesy and practical astronomy. The steam engineering laboratory\r\nprovides practice in testing, adjusting, and managing steam machinery.\r\nThe appliances in connection with mining and metallurgy include a\r\nfive-stamp battery, Blake crusher, automatic machine jigs, an engine\r\npulverizer, a Root and a Sturtevant blower, with blast reverberating,\r\nwasting, cupellation, and fusion furnaces, and all other means for\r\nreducing ores. The architectural museum contains many thousand casts,\r\nmodels, photographs, and drawings. The shops for handwork are large and\r\nwell arranged, and include a vise-shop, forge shop, machine, tool, and\r\nlathe shops, foundry, rooms for pattern making, weaving, and other\r\nindustrial institutions. The vise-shop contains four heavy benches, with\r\n32 vises attached, giving a capacity for teaching 128 students the\r\ncourse every ten weeks, or 640 in a year of fifty weeks. The forge-shop\r\nhas eight forges. The foundry has 16 moulding benches, an oven for core\r\nbaking, and a blast furnace of one-half ton capacity. The\r\npattern-weaving room is provided with five looms, one of them in\r\n20-harness, and 4-shuttle looms, and another an improved Jacquard\r\npattern loom. It may safely be said that there is nor an establishment\r\nin the world better equipped for industrial and technical education than\r\nthis Institute of Massachusetts.--_London Building News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIVORY GETTING SCARCE.--The stock of ivory in London is estimated at\r\nabout forty tons in dealers' private warehouses, whereas formerly they\r\nusually held about one hundred tons. One fourth of all imported into\r\nEngland goes to the Sheffield cutlers. No really satisfactory substitute\r\nfor ivory has been found, and millions await the discoverer of one. The\r\nexisting substitutes will not take the needed polish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANAESTHETICS OF JUGGLERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFakirs are religious mendicants who, for the purpose of exciting the\r\ncharity of the public, assume positions in which it would seem\r\nimpossible that they could remain, submit themselves to fearful\r\ntortures, or else, by their mode of living, their abstinence, and their\r\nindifference to inclement weather and to external things, try to make\r\nbelieve that, owing to their sanctity, they are of a species superior to\r\nthat of common mortals.\r\n\r\nIn the Indies, these fakirs visit all the great markets, all religious\r\nfetes, and usually all kinds of assemblages, in order to exhibit,\r\nthemselves. If one of them exhibits some new peculiarity, some curious\r\ndeformity, a strange posture, or, finally, any physiological curiosity\r\nwhatever that surpasses those of his confreres, he becomes the\r\nattraction of the fete, and the crowd surrounds him, and small coin and\r\nrupees begin to fall into his bowl.\r\n\r\nFakirs, like all persons who voluntarily torture themselves, are curious\r\nexamples of the modifications that will, patience, and, so to speak,\r\n\"art\" can introduce into human nature, and into the sensitiveness and\r\nfunctions of the organs. If these latter are capable of being improved,\r\nof having their functions developed and of acquiring more strength (as,\r\nfor example, the muscles of boxers, the breast of foot racers, the voice\r\nof singers, etc.), these same organs, on the contrary, can be atrophied\r\nor modified, and their functions be changed in nature. It is in such\r\ndegradation and such degeneration of human nature that fakirs excel, and\r\nit is from such a point of view that they are worth studying.\r\n\r\nWe may, so to speak, class these individuals according to the grades of\r\npunishments that they inflict upon themselves, or according to the\r\ndeformities that they have caused themselves to undergo. But, as we have\r\nalready said, the number of both of these is extremely varied, each\r\nfakir striving in this respect to eclipse his fellows. It is only\r\nnecessary to open a book of Indian travel to find descriptions of fakirs\r\nin abundance; and such descriptions might seem exaggerated or unlikely\r\nwere they not so concordant. The following are a few examples:\r\n\r\n_Immovable fakirs_.--The number of these is large. They remain immovable\r\nin the spot they have selected, and that too for an exceedingly long\r\nperiod of time. An example of one of these is cited who remained\r\nstanding for twelve years, his arms crossed upon his breast, without\r\nmoving and without lying or sitting down. In such cases charitable\r\npersons always take it upon themselves to prevent the fakir from dying\r\nof starvation. Some remain sitting, immovable, and apparently lifeless,\r\nwhile others, who lie stretched out upon the ground, look like corpses.\r\nIt may be easily imagined what a state one of these beings is in after a\r\nfew months or years of immobility. He is extremely lean, his limbs are\r\natrophied, his body is black with filth and dust, his hair is long and\r\ndishevelled, his beard is shaggy, his finger and toe nails have become\r\ngenuine claws, and his aspect is frightful. This, however, is a\r\ncharacter common to all fakirs.\r\n\r\nWe may likewise class among the immovables those fakirs who cause\r\nthemselves to be interred up to the neck, and who remain thus with their\r\nhead sticking out of the ground either during the entire time the fair\r\nor fete lasts or for months and years.\r\n\r\n_Anchylotic Fakirs_.--The number of fakirs who continue to hold one or\r\nboth arms outstretched is very large in India. The following description\r\nof one of them is given by a traveler: \"He was a goussain--a religious\r\nmendicant--who had dishevelled hair and beard, and horrible tattooings\r\nupon his face, and, what was most hideous, was his left arm, which,\r\nwithered and anchylosed, stuck up perpendicularly from the shoulder. His\r\nclosed hand, surrounded by straps, had been traversed by the nails,\r\nwhich, continuing to grow, had bent like claws on the other side.\r\nFinally, the hollow of this hand, which was filled with earth, served as\r\na pot for a small sacred myrtle.\"\r\n\r\nOther fakirs hold their two arms above their head, the hands crossed,\r\nand remain perpetually in such a position. Others again have one or both\r\narms extended. Some hang by their feet from the limb of a tree by means\r\nof a cord, and remain head downward for days at a time, with their face\r\nuncongested and their voice clear, counting their beads and mumbling\r\nprayers.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable peculiarities of fakirs is the faculty that\r\ncertain of them possess of remaining entirely buried in vaults and\r\nboxes, and inclosed in bags, etc., for weeks and months, and, although\r\nthere is a certain deceit as regards the length of their absolute\r\nabstinence, it nevertheless seems to be a demonstrated fact that, after\r\nundergoing a peculiar treatment, they became plunged into a sort of\r\nlethargy that allows them to remain for several days or weeks without\r\ntaking food. Certain fakirs that have been interred under such\r\nconditions have, it appears, passed ten months or a year in their grave.\r\n\r\n_Tortured Fakirs_.--Fakirs that submit themselves to tortures are very\r\nnumerous. Some of them perform exercises analogous to those of the\r\nAissaoua. Mr. Rousselet, in his voyage to the Indies, had an opportunity\r\nof seeing some of these at Bhopal, and the following is the picturesque\r\ndescription that he gives of them: \"I remarked some groups of religious\r\nmendicants of a frightfully sinister character. They were Jogins, who,\r\nstark naked and with dishevelled hair, were walking about, shouting, and\r\ndancing a sort of weird dance. In the midst of their contortions they\r\nbrandished long, sharp poniards, of a special form, provided with steel\r\nchains. From time to time, one of these hallucinated creatures would\r\ndrive the poniard into his body (principally into the sides of his\r\nchest), into his arms, and into his legs, and would only desist when, in\r\norder to calm his apparent fury, the idlers who were surrounding him\r\nthrew a sufficient number of pennies to him.\"\r\n\r\nAt the time of the feast of the Juggernaut one sees, or rather one _did_\r\nsee before the English somewhat humanized this ceremony, certain fakirs\r\nsuspended by their flesh from iron hooks placed along the sides of the\r\ngod's car. Others had their priests insert under their shoulder blades\r\ntwo hooks, that were afterward fixed to a long pole capable of pivoting\r\nupon a post. The fakirs were thus raised about thirty feet above ground,\r\nand while being made to spin around very rapidly, smilingly threw\r\nflowers to the faithful. Others, again, rolled over mattresses garnished\r\nwith nails, lance-points, poniards, and sabers, and naturally got up\r\nbathed in blood. A large number cause 120 gashes (the sacred number) to\r\nbe made in their back and breast in honor of their god. Some pierce\r\ntheir tongue with a long and narrow poniard, and remain thus exposed to\r\nthe admiration of the faithful. Finally, many of them are content to\r\npass points of iron or rods made of reed through folds in their skin. It\r\nwill be seen from this that fakirs are ingenious in their modes of\r\nexciting the compassion and charity of the faithful.\r\n\r\nElsewhere, among a large number of savage tribes and half-civilized\r\npeoples, we find aspirants to the priesthood of the fetiches undergoing,\r\nunder the direction of the members of the religious caste that they\r\ndesired to enter, ordeals that are extremely painful. Now, it has been\r\nremarked for a long time that, among the neophytes, although all are\r\nprepared by the same hands, some undergo these ordeals without\r\nmanifesting any suffering, while others cannot stand the pain, and so\r\nrun away with fright. It has been concluded from this that the object of\r\nsuch ordeals is to permit the caste to make a selection from among their\r\nrecruits, and that, too, by means of anesthetics administered to the\r\nchosen neophytes.\r\n\r\nIn France, during the last two centuries, when torturing the accused was\r\nin vogue, some individuals were found to be insensible to the most\r\nfearful tortures, and some even, who were plunged into a species of\r\nsomnolence or stupefaction, slept in the hands of the executioner.\r\n\r\nWhat are the processes that permit of such results being reached?\r\nEvidently, we cannot know them all. A certain number are caste, sect, or\r\nfamily secrets. Many are known, however, at least in a general way. The\r\nprocesses naturally vary, according to the object to be attained. Some\r\nseem to consist only in an effort of the will. Thus, those fakirs who\r\nremain immovable have no need of any special preparation to reach such a\r\nresult, and the same is the case with those who are interred up to the\r\nneck, the will alone sufficing. Fakirs probably pass through the same\r\nphases that invalids do who are forced to keep perfectly quiet through a\r\nfracture or dislocation. During the first days the organism revolts\r\nagainst such inaction, the constraint is great, the muscles contract by\r\nstarts, and then the patient gets used to it; the constraint becomes\r\nless and less, the revolt of the muscles becomes less frequent, and the\r\npatient becomes reconciled to his immobility. It is probable that after\r\npassing several months or years in a state of immobility fakirs no\r\nlonger experience any desire to change their position, and even did they\r\nso desire, it would be impossible owing to the atrophy of their muscles\r\nand the anchylosis of their joints.\r\n\r\nThose fakirs who remain with one or several limbs immovable and in an\r\nabnormal position have to undergo a sort of preparation, a special\r\ntreatment; they have to enter and remain two or three mouths in a sort\r\nof cage or frame of bamboo, the object of which is to keep the limb that\r\nis to be immobilized in the position that it is to preserve. This\r\ntreatment, which is identical with the one employed by surgeons for\r\ncuring affections of the joints, has the effect of soldering or\r\nanchylosing the articulation. When such a result is reached, the fakir\r\nremains, in spite of himself and without fatigue, with outstretched\r\narms, and, in order to cause them to drop, he would have to undergo a\r\nsurgical operation.\r\n\r\nAs for those voluntary tortures that cause an effusion of blood, the\r\ninsensibility of those who are the victims of it is explainable when we\r\nreflect that _India_ is _the_ country _par excellence_ of anæsthetic\r\nplants. It produces, notably, Indian hemp and poppy, the first of which\r\nyields hashish and the other opium. Now it is owing to these two\r\nnarcotics, taken in a proper dose, either alone or combined according to\r\na formula known to Hindoo fakirs and jugglers, but ignored by the lower\r\nclass, that the former are able to become absolutely insensible\r\nthemselves or make their adepts so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN FAKIRS IN VARIOUS POSITIONS.]\r\n\r\nThere is, especially, a liquor known in the Indian pharmacopoeia under\r\nthe name of _bang_, that produces an exciting intoxication accompanied\r\nwith complete insensibility. Now the active part of bang consists of a\r\nmixture of opium and hashish. It was an analogous liquor that the\r\nBrahmins made Indian widows take before leading them to the funeral\r\npile. This liquor removed from the victims not only all consciousness of\r\nthe act that they were accomplishing, but also rendered them insensible\r\nto the flames. Moreover, the dose of the anæsthetic was such that if, by\r\naccident, the widow had escaped from the pile (something that more than\r\nonce happened, thanks to English protection), she would have died\r\nthrough poisoning. Some travelers in Africa speak of an herb called\r\n_rasch_, which is the base of anæsthetic preparations employed by\r\ncertain Arabian jugglers and sorcerers.\r\n\r\nIt was hashish that the Old Man of the Mountain, the chief of the sect\r\nof Assassins, had recourse to for intoxicating his adepts, and it was,\r\nit is thought, by the use of a virulent solanaceous plant--henbane,\r\nthornapple, or belladonna--that he succeeded in rendering them\r\ninsensible. We have unfortunately lost the recipe for certain\r\nanæsthetics that were known in ancient times, some of which, such as the\r\n_Memphis stone_, appear to have been used in surgical operations. We are\r\nalso ignorant of what the wine of myrrh was that is spoken of in the\r\nBible.\r\n\r\nWe are likewise ignorant of the composition of the anæsthetic soap, the\r\nuse of which became so general in the 15th and 16th centuries that,\r\naccording to Taboureau, it was difficult to torture persons who were\r\naccused. The stupefying recipe was known to all jailers, who, for a\r\nconsideration, communicated it to prisoners. It was this use of\r\nanæsthetics that gave rise to the rule of jurisprudence according to\r\nwhich partial or general insensibility was regarded as a certain sign of\r\nsorcery. We may cite a certain number of preparations, which vary\r\naccording to the country, and to which is attributed the properly of\r\ngiving courage and rendering persons insensible to wounds inflicted by\r\nthe enemy. In most cases alcohol forms the base of such beverages,\r\nalthough the _maslach_ that Turkish soldiers drink just before a battle\r\ncontains none of it, on account of a religious precept. It consists of\r\ndifferent plant-juices, and contains, especially, a little opium.\r\nCossacks and Tartars, just before battle, take a fermented beverage in\r\nwhich has been infused a species of toadstool (_Agaricus muscarius_),\r\nand which renders them courageous to a high degree.\r\n\r\nAs well known, the old soldiers of the First Empire taught the young\r\nconscripts that in order to have courage and not feel the blows of the\r\nenemy, it was only necessary to drink a glass of brandy into which\r\ngunpowder had been poured.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[SCHOOL OF MINES QUARTERLY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPOSITION OF ORES.\r\n\r\nBy J.S. NEWBERRY.\r\n\r\nMINERAL VEINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Quarterly_ for March, 1880, a paper was published on \"The Origin\r\nand Classification of Ore Deposits,\" which treated, among other things,\r\nof mineral veins. These were grouped in three categories, namely: 1.\r\nGash Veins; 2. Segregated Veins; 3. Fissure Veins; and were defined as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n_Gash Veins_.--Ore deposits confined to a single bed or formation of\r\n_limestone_, of which the joints, and sometimes planes of bedding,\r\nenlarged by the solvent power of atmospheric water carrying carbonic\r\nacid, and forming crevices, galleries, or caves, are lined or filled\r\nwith ore leached from the surrounding rock, e.g., the lead deposits of\r\nthe Upper Mississippi and Missouri.\r\n\r\n_Segregated Veins_.--Sheets of quartzose matter, chiefly lenticular and\r\nconforming to the bedding of the inclosing rocks, but sometimes filling\r\nirregular fractures across such bedding, found only in metamorphic\r\nrocks, limited in extent laterally and vertically, and consisting of\r\nmaterial indigenous to the strata in which they occur, separated in the\r\nprocess of metamorphism, e.g., quartz ledges carrying gold, copper, iron\r\npyrites, etc., in the Alleghany Mountains, New England, Canada, etc.\r\n\r\n_Fissure Veins_.--Sheets of metalliferous matter filling fissures caused\r\nby subterranean force, usually in the planes of faults, and formed by\r\nthe deposit of various minerals brought from a lower level by water,\r\nwhich under pressure and at a high temperature, having great solvent\r\npower, had become loaded with matters leached from different rocks, and\r\ndeposited them in the channels of escape as the pressure and temperature\r\nwere reduced.\r\n\r\nSince that article was written, a considerable portion of several years\r\nhas been spent by the writer continuing the observations upon which it\r\nwas based. During this time most of the mining centers of the Western\r\nStates and Territories, as well as some in Mexico and Canada, were\r\nvisited and studied with more or less care. Perhaps no other portion of\r\nthe earth's surface is so rich in mineral resources as that which has\r\nbeen covered by these observations, and nowhere else is to be found as\r\ngreat a variety of ore deposits, or those which illustrate as well their\r\nmode of formation. This is so true that it maybe said without\r\nexaggeration that no one can intelligently discuss the questions that\r\nhave been raised in regard to the origin and mode of formation of ore\r\nbodies without transversing and studying the great mining belt of our\r\nWestern States and Territories.\r\n\r\nThe observations made by the writer during the past four years confirm\r\nin all essentials the views set forth in the former article in the\r\n_Quarterly_, and while a volume might be written describing the\r\nphenomena exhibited by different mines and mining districts, the array\r\nof facts thus presented would be, for the most part, simply a\r\nre-enforcement of those already given.\r\n\r\nThe present article, which must necessarily be short, would hardly have\r\na _raison d'etre_ except that it affords an opportunity for an addition\r\nwhich should be made to the classes of mineral veins heretofore\r\nrecognized in this country, and it seems called for by the recent\r\npublication of theories on the origin of ore deposits which are\r\nincompatible with those hitherto presented and now held by the writer,\r\nand which, if allowed to pass unquestioned, might seem to be\r\nunquestionable.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEDDED VEINS.\r\n\r\nCertain ore deposits which have recently come under my observation\r\nappear to correspond very closely with those that Von Cotta has taken as\r\ntypes of his class of \"bedded veins,\" and as no similar ones have been\r\nnoticed by American writers on ore deposits they have seemed to me\r\nworthy of description.\r\n\r\nThese are zones or layers of a sedimentary rock, to the bedding of which\r\nthey are conformable, impregnated with ore derived from a foreign\r\nsource, and formed long subsequent to the deposition of the containing\r\nformation. Such deposits are exemplified by the Walker and Webster, the\r\nPiñon, the Climax, etc., in Parley's Park, and the Green-Eyed Monster,\r\nand the Deer Trail, at Marysvale, Utah. These are all zones in quartzite\r\nwhich have been traversed by mineral solutions that have by substitution\r\nconverted such layers into ore deposits of considerable magnitude and\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe ore contained in these bedded veins exhibits some variety of\r\ncomposition, but where unaffected by atmospheric action consists of\r\nargentiferous galena, iron pyrites carrying gold, or the sulphides of\r\nzinc and copper containing silver or gold or both. The ore of the Walker\r\nand Webster and the Piñon is chiefly lead-carbonate and galena, often\r\nstained with copper-carbonate. That of the Green Eyed Monster--now\r\nthoroughly oxidized as far as penetrated--forms a sheet from twenty to\r\nforty feet in thickness, consisting of ferruginous, sandy, or talcose\r\nsoft material carrying from twenty to thirty dollars to the ton in gold\r\nand silver. The ore of the Deer Trail forms a thinner sheet containing\r\nconsiderable copper, and sometimes two hundred to three hundred dollars\r\nto the ton in silver.\r\n\r\nThe rocks which hold these ore deposits are of Silurian age, but they\r\nreceived their metalliferous impregnation much later, probably in the\r\nTertiary, and subsequent to the period of disturbance in which they were\r\nelevated and metamorphosed. This is proved by the fact that in places\r\nwhere the rock has been shattered, strings of ore are found running off\r\nfrom the main body, crossing the bedding and filling the interstices\r\nbetween the fragments, forming a coarse stock-work.\r\n\r\nBedded veins may be distinguished from fissure veins by the absence of\r\nall traces of a fissure, the want of a banded structure, slickensides,\r\nselvages, etc.; from gash veins and the floors of ore which often\r\naccompany them, as well as from segregated veins, they are distinguished\r\nby the nature of the inclosing rock and the foreign origin of the ore.\r\nSometimes the plane of junction between two contiguous sheets of rock\r\nhas been the channel through which has flowed a metalliferous solution,\r\nand the zone where the ore has replaced by substitution portions of one\r\nor both strata. These are often called blanket veins in the West, but\r\nthey belong rather to the category of contact deposits as I have\r\nheretofore defined them. Where such sheets of ore occupy by preference\r\nthe planes of contact between adjacent strata, but sometimes desert such\r\nplanes, and show slickensided walls, and banded structure, like the\r\ngreat veins of Bingham, Utah, these should be classed as true fissure\r\nveins.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORIES OF ORE DEPOSIT.\r\n\r\nThe recently published theories of the formation of mineral veins, to\r\nwhich I have alluded, are those of Prof. Von Groddek[1] and Dr.\r\nSandberger,[2] who attribute the filling of veins to exudations of\r\nmineral solutions from the wall rocks (i.e., lateral secretions), and\r\nthose of Mr. S.F. Emmons,[3] and Mr. G.F. Becker,[4] who have been\r\nstudying, respectively, the ore deposits of Leadville and of the\r\nComstock, by whom the ores are credited to the leaching of adjacent\r\n_igneous_ rocks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Die Lehre von den Lagerstatten der Erze, von Dr. Albrecht\r\nvon Groddek, Leipzig. 1879.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Untersuchungen uber Erzgange, von Fridolin Sandberger,\r\nWeisbaden, 1882.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Geology and Mining Industry of Leadville, Annual Report,\r\nDirector U.S. Geol. Surv., 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Geology of the Comstock Lode and Washoe District, G.F.\r\nBecker, Washington, 1883.\r\n\r\nIt is but justice to Messrs. Becker and Emmons to say that theirs are\r\nadmirable studies, thorough and exhaustive, of great interest and value\r\nto both mining engineers and geologists, and most creditable to the\r\nauthors and the country. No better work of the kind has been done\r\nanywhere, and it will detract little from its merit even if the views of\r\nthe authors on the theoretical question of the sources of the ores shall\r\nnot be generally adopted.]\r\n\r\nThe lack of space must forbid the full discussion of these theories at\r\nthe present time, but I will briefly enumerate some of the facts which\r\nrender it difficult for me to accept them.\r\n\r\nFirst, _the great diversity of character exhibited by different sets of\r\nfissure veins which cut the same country rock_ seems incompatible with\r\nany theory of lateral secretion. These distinct systems are of different\r\nages, of diversified composition, and have evidently drawn their supply\r\nof material from different sources. Hundreds of cases of this kind could\r\nbe cited, but I will mention only a few; among others the Humboldt, the\r\nBassick, and the Bull Domingo, near Rosita and Silver Cliff, Colorado.\r\nThese are veins contained in the same sheet of eruptive rock, but the\r\nores are as different as possible. The Humboldt is a narrow fissure\r\ncarrying a thin ore streak of high grade, consisting of sulphides of\r\nsilver, antimony, arsenic, and copper; the Bassick is a great\r\nconglomerate vein containing tellurides of silver and gold,\r\nargentiferous galena, blende, and yellow copper; the Bull Domingo is\r\nalso a great fissure filled with rubbish containing ore chimneys of\r\ngalena with tufts of wire silver. I may also cite the Jordan, with its\r\nintersecting and yet distinct and totally different veins; the Galena,\r\nthe Neptune, and the American Flag, in Bingham Canon, Utah; and the\r\nclosely associated yet diverse system of veins the Ferris, the\r\nWashington, the Chattanooga, the Fillmore, etc., in Bullion Canon at\r\nMarysvale. In these and many other groups which have been examined by\r\nthe writer, the same rocks are cut by veins of different ages, having\r\ndifferent bearings, and containing different ores and veinstones. It\r\nseems impossible that all these diversified materials should have been\r\nderived from the same source, and the only rational explanation of the\r\nphenomena is that which I have heretofore advocated, the ascent of\r\nmetalliferous solutions from different and deep seated sources.\r\n\r\nAnother apparently unanswerable argument against the theory of lateral\r\nsecretion is furnished by the cases _where the same vein traverses a\r\nseries of distinct formations, and holds its character essentially\r\nunaffected by changes in the country rock_. One of many such may be\r\ncited in the Star vein at Cherry Creek, Nevada, which, nearly at right\r\nangles to their strike, cuts belts of quartzite, limestone, and slate,\r\nmaintaining its peculiar character of ore and gangue throughout.\r\n\r\nThis and all similar veins have certainly been filled with material\r\nbrought from a distance, and not derived from the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEACHING OF IGNEOUS ROCKS.\r\n\r\nThe arguments against the theory that mineral veins have been produced\r\nby the leaching of superficial _igneous_ rocks are in part the same as\r\nthose already cited against the general theory of lateral secretion.\r\nThey may be briefly summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Thousands of mineral veins in this and other countries occur in\r\nregions remote from eruptive rocks. Into this category come most of\r\nthose of the eastern half of the Continent, viz., Canada, New England,\r\nthe Alleghany belt, and the Mississippi Valley. Among those I will refer\r\nonly to a few selected to represent the greatest range of character,\r\nviz., the Victoria lead mine, near Sault Ste. Marie, the Bruce copper\r\nmine on Lake Huron, the gold-bearing quartz veins of Madoc, the Gatling\r\ngold vein of Marmora, the Acton and the Harvey Hill copper mines of\r\nCanada, the copper veins of Ely, Vermont, and of Blue Hills, Maine, the\r\nsilver-bearing lead veins of Newburyport, Mass.; most of the segregated\r\ngold veins of the Alleghany belt, the lead veins of Rossie, Ellenville,\r\nand at other localities farther South; the copper bearing veins of\r\nVirginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee; the veins carrying\r\nargentiferous galena in Central Kentucky and in Southern Illinois; the\r\nsilver, copper, and antimony veins of Arkansas; and the lead and zinc\r\ndeposits of Missouri and the Upper Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIn these widely separated localities are to be found fissure,\r\nsegregated, and gash veins, and a great diversity of ores, which have\r\nbeen derived, sometimes from the adjacent rocks--as in the segregated\r\nveins of the Alleghany belt and the gash veins of the Mississippi\r\nregion--and in other cases--where they are contained in true fissure\r\nveins--from a foreign source, but all deposited without the aid of\r\nsuperficial igneous rocks, either as contributors of matter or force.\r\n\r\n2. In the great mineral belt of the Far West, where volcanic emanations\r\nare so abundant, and where they have certainly played an important part\r\nin the formation of ore deposits, the great majority of veins are not in\r\nimmediate contact with trap rocks, and they could not, therefore, have\r\nfurnished the ores.\r\n\r\nA volume might be formed by a list of the cases of this kind, but I can\r\nhere allude to a few only, most of which I have myself examined, viz.:\r\n\r\n_(a.)_ The great ore chambers of the San Carlos Mountains in Chihuahua,\r\nthe largest deposits of ore of which I have any knowledge. These are\r\ncontained in heavy beds of limestone, which are cut in various places by\r\ntrap dikes, which, as elsewhere, have undoubtedly furnished the stimulus\r\nto chemical action that has resulted in the formation of the ore bodies,\r\nbut are too remote to have supplied the material.\r\n\r\n_(b.)_ The silver mines of Santa Eulalia, in Chihuahua, from which\r\nduring the last century one hundred and twelve millions of dollars were\r\ntaken, opened on ore deposits situated in Cretaceous limestones like\r\nthose of San Carlos, and apparently similar ore-filled chambers; an\r\nigneous rock caps the hills in the vicinity, but is nowhere in contact\r\nor even proximity to the ore bodies. (See Kimball, _Amer. Jour. Sci,_.\r\nMarch, 1870.)\r\n\r\n_(c.)_ The great chambers of Tombstone, and the copper veins of the\r\nGlobe District, the Copper Queen, etc., in Arizona.\r\n\r\n_(d.)_ The large bodies of silver-ore at Lake Valley, New Mexico;\r\nchambers in limestone, like _c_.\r\n\r\n_(e.)_ The Black Hawk group of gold mines, the Montezuma, Georgetown,\r\nand other silver mines in the granite belt of Colorado.\r\n\r\n_(f.)_ The great group of veins and chambers in the Bradshaw, Lincoln,\r\nStar, and Granite districts of Southern Utah, where we find a host of\r\nveins of different character in limestone or granite, with no trap to\r\nwhich the ores can be credited.\r\n\r\n_(g.)_ The Crismon Mammoth vein of Tintic.\r\n\r\n_(h.)_ The group of mines opened on the American Fork, on Big and Little\r\nCottonwood, and in Parley's Park, including the Silver Bell, the Emma,\r\nthe Vallejo, the Prince of Wales, the Kessler, the Bonanza, the Climax,\r\nthe Piñon, and the Ontario. (The latter, the greatest silver mine now\r\nknown in the country, lies in quartzite, and the trap is near, but not\r\nin contact with the vein.)\r\n\r\n_(i.)_ In Nevada, the ore deposits of Pioche, Tempiute, Tybo, Eureka,\r\nWhite Pine, and Cherry Creek, on the east side of the State, with those\r\nof Austin, Belmont, and a series too great for enumeration in the\r\ncentral and western portions.\r\n\r\n_(j.)_ In California, the Bodie, Mariposa, Grass Valley, and other\r\nmines.[1]\r\n\r\n_(k.)_ In Idaho, those of the Poor Man in the Owyhee district, the\r\nprincipal veins of the Wood River region, the Ramshorn at Challis, the\r\nCuster and Charles Dickens, at Bonanza City, etc.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Redmond's Report _(California Geol. Survey Mining\r\nStatistics, No 1),_ where seventy-seven mines are enumerated, of which\r\nthree are said to be in \"porphyritic schist,\" all the others in granite,\r\nmica schist, clay, slate, etc.]\r\n\r\nIn nearly all these localities we may find evidence not only that the\r\nore deposits have not been derived from the leaching of igneous rocks,\r\nbut also that they have not come from those of any kind which form the\r\nwalls of the veins.\r\n\r\nThe gold-bearing quartz veins of Deadwood are so closely associated with\r\ndikes of porphyry, that they may have been considered as illustrations\r\nof the potency of trap dikes in producing concentration of metals. But\r\nwe have conclusive evidence that the gold was there in Archæan times,\r\nwhile the igneous rocks are all of modern, probably of Tertiary, date.\r\nThis proof is furnished by the \"Cement mines\" of the Potsdam sandstone.\r\nThis is the beach of the Lower Silurian sea when it washed the shores of\r\nan Archæan island, now the Black Hills. The waves that produced this\r\nbeach beat against cliffs of granite and slate containing quartz veins\r\ncarrying gold. Fragments of this auriferous quartz, and the gold beaten\r\nout of them and concentrated by the waves, were in places buried in the\r\nsand beach in such quantity as to form deposits from which a large\r\namount of gold is now being taken. Without this demonstration of the\r\norigin and antiquity of the gold, it might very well have been supposed\r\nto be derived from the eruptive rock.\r\n\r\nStrong arguments against the theory that the leaching of superficial\r\nigneous rocks has supplied the materials filling mineral veins, are\r\nfurnished by the facts observed in the districts where igneous rocks are\r\nmost prevalent, viz.: (1.) _Such districts are proverbially barren of\r\nuseful minerals_. (2.) _Where these occur, the same sheet of rock may\r\ncontain several systems of veins with different ores and gangues._\r\n\r\nThe great lava plain of Snake River, the Pedrigal country of eastern\r\nOregon, Northern California and Mexico are without valuable ore\r\ndeposits. The same may be said of the Pancake Range and other mountain\r\nchains of igneous rock in Nevada, while the adjacent ranges composed of\r\nsedimentary rocks are rich in ore deposits of various kinds. A still\r\nstronger case is furnished by the Cascade Mountains, which, north of the\r\nCalifornia line, are composed almost exclusively of erupted material,\r\nand yet in all this belt, so far as now known, not a single valuable\r\nmine has been opened. In contrast with this is the condition of things\r\nin California, where the Sierra Nevada is composed of metamorphic rocks\r\nwhich have been shown to be the repositories of vast quantities of gold,\r\nsilver, and copper. Cases belonging to this category may be found at\r\nRosita and Silver Cliff, where the diversity in the ores of the mines\r\nalready enumerated can hardly be reconciled with the theory of a common\r\norigin. At Lake City the prevailing porphyry holds the veins of the Ute\r\nand Ulay and the Ocean Wave mines, which are similar, and the Hotchkiss,\r\nthe Belle, etc., entirely different.\r\n\r\nWe have no evidence that any volcanic eruption has drawn its material\r\nfrom zones or magmas especially rich in metals or their ores, and on the\r\ncontrary, volcanic districts, like those mentioned, and regions, such as\r\nthe Sandwich Islands, where the greatest, eruptions have taken place,\r\nare poorest in metalliferous deposits.\r\n\r\nAll the knowledge we have of the subject justifies the inference that\r\nmost of the igneous rocks which have been poured out in our Western\r\nTerritories are but fused conditions of sediments which form the\r\nsubstructure of that country. Over the great mineral belt which lies\r\nbetween the Sierra Nevada and the front range of the Rocky Mountains,\r\nand extends not only across the whole breadth of our territory, but far\r\ninto Mexico, the surface was once underlain by a series of Palaeozoic\r\nsedimentary strata not less than twenty to thirty thousand feet in\r\nthickness; and beneath these, at the sides, and doubtless below, were\r\nArchæun rocks, also metamorphosed sediments. Through these the ores of\r\nthe metals were generally though sparsely distributed. In the\r\nconvulsions which have in recent times broken up this so long quiet and\r\nstable portion of the earth's crust (and which have resulted in\r\ndepositing in thousands of cracks and cavities the ores we now mine),\r\nportions of the old table-land were in places set up at high angles\r\nforming mountain chains, and doubtless extending to the zone of fusion\r\nbelow. Between these blocks of sedimentary rocks oozed up through the\r\nlines of fracture quantities of fused material, which also sometimes\r\nformed mountain chains; and it is possible and even probable that the\r\nrocks composing the volcanic ridges are but phases of the same materials\r\nthat form the sedimentary chains There is, therefore, no _a priori_\r\nreason why the leaching of one group should furnish more ore than the\r\nother; but, as a matter of fact, the unfused sediments are much the\r\nricher in ore deposits. This can only be accounted for, in my judgment,\r\nby supposing that they have been the receptacles of ore brought from a\r\nforeign source; and we can at least conjecture where and how gathered.\r\nWe can imagine, and we are forced to conclude, that there has been a\r\nzone of solution below, where steam and hot water, under great pressure,\r\nhave effected the leaching of ore-bearing strata, and a zone of\r\ndeposition above, where cavities in pre-existent solidified and\r\nshattered rocks became the repositories of the deposits made from\r\nascending solutions, when the temperature and pressure were diminished.\r\nWhere great masses of fused material were poured out, these must have\r\nbeen for along time too highly heated to become places of deposition; so\r\nlong indeed that the period of active vein formation may have passed\r\nbefore they reached a degree of solidification and coolness that would\r\npermit their becoming receptacles of the products of deposition. On the\r\ncontrary, the masses of unfused and always relatively cool sedimentary\r\nrocks which form the most highly metalliferous mountain ranges (White\r\nPine, Toyabe, etc.) were, throughout the whole period of disturbance, in\r\na condition to become such repositories. Certainly highly heated\r\nsolutions forced by an irresistible _vis a tergo_ through rocks of any\r\nkind down in the heated zone, would be far more effective leaching\r\nagents than cold surface water with feeble solvent power, moved only by\r\ngravity, percolating slowly through superficial strata.\r\n\r\nRichthofen, who first made a study of the Comstock lode, suggests that\r\nthe mineral impregnation of the vein was the result of a process like\r\nthat described, viz., the leaching of deep-seated rocks, perhaps the\r\nsame that inclose the vein above, by highly heated solutions which\r\ndeposited their load near the surface. On the other hand, Becker\r\nsupposes the concentration to have been effected by surface waters\r\nflowing laterally through the igneous rocks, gathering the precious\r\nmetals and depositing them in the fissure, as lateral secretion produces\r\nthe accumulation of ore in the limestone of the lead region. But there\r\nare apparently good reasons for preferring the theory of Richthofen:\r\nviz., first, the veinstone of the Comstock is chiefly quartz, the\r\nnatural and common precipitate of _hot_ waters, since they are far more\r\npowerful solvents of silica than cold. On the contrary, the ores\r\ndeposited from lateral secretion, as in the Mississippi lead region, at\r\nlow temperature contain comparatively little silica; second, the great\r\nmineral belt to which reference has been made above is now the region\r\nwhere nearly all the hot springs of the continent are situated. It is,\r\nin fact, a region conspicuous for the number of its hot springs, and it\r\nis evident that these are the last of the series of thermal phenomena\r\nconnected with the great volcanic upheavals and eruptions, of which this\r\nregion has been the theater since the beginning of the Tertiary age. The\r\ngeysers of Yellowstone Park, the hot springs of the Wamchuck district in\r\nOregon, the Steamboat Springs of Nevada, the geysers of California, the\r\nhot springs of Salt Lake City, Monroe, etc., in Utah, and the Pagosa in\r\nColorado, are only the most conspicuous among thousands of hot springs\r\nwhich continue in action at the present time. The evidence is also\r\nconclusive that the number of hot springs, great as it now is in this\r\nregion, was once much greater. That these hot springs were capable of\r\nproducing mineral veins by material brought up in and deposited from\r\ntheir waters, is demonstrated by the phenomena observable at the\r\nSteamboat Springs, and which were cited in my former article as\r\naffording the best illustration of vein formation.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the lower workings of the Comstock vein is now over\r\n150°F., and an enormous quantity of hot water is discharged through the\r\nSutro Tunnel. This water has been heated by coming in contact with hot\r\nrocks at a lower level than the present workings of the Comstock lode,\r\nand has been driven upward in the same way that the flow of all hot\r\nsprings is produced. As that flow is continuous, it is evident that the\r\nworkings of the Comstock have simply opened the conduits of hot springs,\r\nwhich are doing to-day what they have been doing in ages past, but much\r\nless actively, i.e., bringing toward the surface the materials they have\r\ntaken into solution in a more highly heated zone below. Hence it seems\r\nmuch more natural to suppose that the great sheets of ore-bearing quartz\r\nnow contained in the Comstock fissure were deposited by ascending\r\ncurrents of hot alkaline waters, than by descending currents of those\r\nwhich were cold and neutral The hot springs are there, though less\r\ncopious and less hot than formerly, and the natural deposits from hot\r\nwaters are there. Is it not more rational to suppose with Richthofen\r\nthat these are related as cause and effect, rather than that cold water\r\nhas leached the ore and the silica from the walls near the surface? Mr.\r\nBecker's preference for the latter hypothesis seems to be due to the\r\ndiscovery of gold and silver in the igneous rocks adjacent to the vein,\r\nand yet, except in immediate contact with it, these rocks contain no\r\nmore of the precious metals than the mere trace which by refined tests\r\nmay be discovered everywhere. If, as we have supposed, the fissure was\r\nfor a long time filled with a hot solution charged with an unusual\r\nquantity of the precious metals, nothing would be more natural than that\r\nthe wall rocks should be to some extent impregnated with them.\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps illuminate the question to inquire which of the springs\r\nand water currents of this region are now making deposits that can be\r\ncompared with those which filled the Comstock and other veins. No one\r\nwho has visited that country will hesitate to say the hot and not the\r\ncold waters. The immense silicious deposits, carrying the ores of\r\nseveral metals, formed by the geysers of the Yellowstone, the Steamboat\r\nSprings, etc., show what the hot waters are capable of doing; but we\r\nshall search in vain for any evidence that the cold surface waters have\r\ndone or can do this kind of work.\r\n\r\nAt Leadville the case is not so plain, and yet no facts can be cited\r\nwhich really _prove_ that the ore deposits have been formed by the\r\nleaching of the overlying porphyry rather than by an outflow of heated\r\nmineral solutions along the plane of junction between the porphyry and\r\nthe limestone. Near this plane the porphyry is often thoroughly\r\ndecomposed, is somewhat impregnated with ore, and even contains sheets\r\nof ore within itself; but remote from the plane of contact with the\r\nlimestone, it contains little diffused and no concentrated ore. It is\r\nscarcely more previous than the underlying limestones, and why a\r\nsolution that could penetrate and leach ores from it should be stopped\r\nat the upper surface of the blue limestone is not obvious; nor why the\r\nplane of junction between the porphyry and the _blue limestone_ should\r\nbe the special place of deposit of the ore.\r\n\r\nIf the assays of the porphyry reported by Mr. Emmons were accurately\r\nmade, and they shall be confirmed by the more numerous ones necessary to\r\nsettle the question, and the estimates he makes of the richness of that\r\nrock be corroborated, an unexpected result will be reached, and, as I\r\nthink, a remarkable and exceptional case of the diffusion of silver and\r\nlead through an igneous rock be established.\r\n\r\nIt is of course possible that the Leadville porphyries are only phases\r\nof rocks rich in silver, lead, and iron, which underlie this region, and\r\nwhich have been fused and forced to the surface by an ascending mass of\r\ndeeper seated igneous rock; but even if the argentiferous character of\r\nthe porphyry shall be proved, it will not be proved that such portions\r\nof it as here lie upon the limestone have furnished the ore by the\r\ndescending percolation of cold surface waters. Deeper lying masses of\r\nthis same silver, lead, and iron bearing rock, digested in and leached\r\nby _hot_ waters and steam under great pressure, would seem to be a more\r\nlikely source of the ore. If the surface porphyry is as rich in silver\r\nas Mr. Emmous reports it to be, it is too rich, for the rock that has\r\nfurnished so large a quantity of ores as that which formed the ore\r\nbodies which I saw in the Little Chief and Highland Chief mines,\r\nrespectively 90 feet and 162 feet thick, should be poor in silver and\r\niron and lead, and should be rotten from the leaching it had suffered,\r\nbut except near the ore-bearing contact it is compact and normal.\r\n\r\nSuch a digested, kaolinized, desilicated rock as we would naturally look\r\nfor we find in the porphyry _near the contact_; and its condition there,\r\nso different from what it is remote from the contact, seems to indicate\r\nan exposure to local and decomposing influences, such indeed as a hot\r\nchemical solution forced up from below along the plane of contact would\r\nfurnish.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand why the upper portions of the porphyry\r\nsheet should be so different in character, so solid and homogeneous,\r\nwith no local concentrations or pockets of ore, if they have been\r\nexposed to the same agencies as those which have so changed the under\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nAccepting all the facts reported by Mr. Emmons, and without questioning\r\nthe accuracy of any of his observations, or depreciating in any degree\r\nthe great value of the admirable study he has made of this difficult and\r\ninteresting field, his conclusion in regard to the source of the ore\r\ncannot yet be insisted on as a logical necessity. In the judgment of the\r\nwriter, the phenomena presented by the Leadville ore deposits can be as\r\nwell or better accounted for by supposing that the plane of contact\r\nbetween the limestone and porphyry has been the conduit through which\r\nheated mineral solutions coming from deep seated and remote sources have\r\nflowed, removing something from both the overlying and underlying\r\nstrata, and by substitution depositing sulphides of lead, iron, silver,\r\netc., with silica.\r\n\r\nThe ore deposits of Tybo and Eureka in Nevada, of the Emma, the Cave,\r\nand the Horn Silver [1] mines in Utah, have much in common with those of\r\nLeadville, and it is not difficult to establish for all of the former\r\ncases a foreign and deep seated source of the ore. The fact that the\r\nLeadville ore bodies are sometimes themselves excavated into chambers,\r\nwhich has been advanced as proof of the falsity of the theory here\r\nadvocated, has no bearing on the question, as in the process of\r\noxidation of ores which were certainly once sulphides, there has been\r\nmuch change of place as well as character; currents of water have flowed\r\nthrough them which have collected and redeposited the cerusite in sheets\r\nof \"hard carbonate\" or \"sand carbonate,\" and have elsewhere produced\r\naccumulations of kerargyrite, perhaps thousands of years after the\r\ndeposition of the sulphide ores had ceased and the oxidation had begun.\r\nIn the leaching and rearrangement of the ore bodies, nothing would be\r\nmore natural than that accumulations in one place should be attended by\r\nthe formation of cavities elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Horn Silver ore body lies in a fault fissure between a\r\nfootwall of limestone and a hanging wall of trachyte, and those who\r\nconsider the Leadville ores as teachings of the overlying porphyry would\r\nprobably also regard the ore of the Horn Silver mine as derived from the\r\ntrachyte hanging wall; but three facts oppose the acceptance of this\r\nview, viz., let, the trachyte, except in immediate contact with the ore\r\nbody, seems to be entirely barren; 2d, the Horn Silver ore \"chimney,\"\r\nperhaps fifty feet thick, five hundred feet wide, and of unknown depth,\r\nis the only mass of ore yet found in a mile of well marked fissure; and\r\n3d, the Carbonate mine opened near by in a strong fissure with a bearing\r\nat right angles to that of the Horn Silver, and lying entirely within\r\nthe trachyte, yields ore of a totally different kind. Both are opened to\r\nthe depth of seven hundred feet with no signs of change or exhaustion.\r\nIf the ore were derived from the trachyte, it should be at least\r\nsomewhat alike in the two mines, should be more generally distributed in\r\nthe Horn Silver fissure, and might be expected to give out at, no great\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nIf deposited by solutions coming from deep and different sources, the\r\nobserved differences in character would be natural; it would accumulate\r\nas we find it in the channels of outflow, and would be as time will\r\nprobably prove it, perhaps variable in quantity, but indefinitely\r\ncontinuous in depth.]\r\n\r\nAnother question which suggests itself in reference to the Leadville\r\ndeposits is this: If the Leadville ore was once a mass of sulphides\r\nderived from the overlying porphyry by the percolation of surface\r\nwaters, why has the deposit ceased? The deposition of galena, blende,\r\nand pyrite in the Galena lead mines still continues. If the leaching of\r\nthe Leadville porphyry has not resulted in the formation of alkaline\r\nsulphide solutions, and the ore has come from the porphyry in the\r\ncondition of carbonate of lead, chloride of silver, etc., then the\r\nnature of the deposition was quite different from that of the similar\r\nones of Tybo, Eureka, Bingham, etc., which are plainly gossans, and\r\nindeed is without precedent. But if the process was similar to that in\r\nthe Galena lead region, and the ores were originally sulphides, their\r\nformation should have continued and been detected in the Leadville\r\nmines.\r\n\r\nFor all these reasons the theory of Mr. Emmons will be felt to need\r\nfurther confirmation before it is universally adopted.\r\n\r\nFrom what has gone before it must not be inferred that lateral secretion\r\nis excluded by the writer from the list of agencies which have filled\r\nmineral veins, for it is certain that the nature of the deposit made in\r\nthe fissure has frequently been influenced by the nature of the adjacent\r\nwall rock. Numerous cases may be cited where the ores have increased or\r\ndecreased in quantity and richness, or have otherwise changed character\r\nin passing from one formation to another; but even here the proof is\r\ngenerally wanting that the vein materials have been furnished by the\r\nwall rocks opposite the places where they are found.\r\n\r\nThe varying conductivity of the different strata in relation to heat and\r\nelectricity may have been an important factor. Trap dikes frequently\r\nenrich veins where they approach or intersect them, and they have often\r\nbeen the _primum mobile_ of vein formation, but chiefly, if not only, by\r\nsupplying heat, the mainspring of chemical action. The proximity of\r\nheated masses of rock has promoted chemical action in the same way as do\r\nthe Bunsen burners or the sand baths in the laboratory; but no case has\r\nyet come under my observation where it was demonstrable that the filling\r\nof a fissure vein had been due to secretion from igneous or sedimentary\r\nwall rocks.\r\n\r\nIn the Star District of Southern Utah the country rock is Palæozoic\r\nlimestone, and it is cut by so great a number and variety of mineral\r\nveins that from the Harrisburg, a central location, a rifle shot would\r\nreach ten openings, all on as many distinct and different veins (viz.,\r\nthe Argus, Little Bilk, Clean Sweep, Mountaineer, St. Louis, Xenia,\r\nBrant, Kannarrah, Central, and Wateree). The nearest trap rock is half a\r\nmile or more distant, a columnar dike perhaps fifteen feet in thickness,\r\ncutting the limestone vertically. On either side of this dike is a vein\r\nfrom one to three feet in thickness, of white quartz with specks of ore.\r\nWhere did that quartz come from? From the limestone? But the limestone\r\ncontains very little silica, and is apparently of normal composition\r\nquite up to the vein. From the trap? This is compact, sonorous basalt,\r\napparently unchanged; and that could not have supplied the silica\r\nwithout complete decomposition.\r\n\r\nI should rather say from silica bearing hot waters that flowed up along\r\nthe sides of the trap, depositing there, as in the numerous and varied\r\nveins of the vicinity, mineral matters brought from a zone of solution\r\nfar below.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the conclusions reached in this discussion. I may repeat\r\nthat the results of all recent as well as earlier observations has been\r\nto convince me that Richthofen's theory of the filling of the Comstock\r\nlode is the true one, and that the example and demonstration of the\r\nformation of mineral veins furnished by the Steamboat Springs is not\r\nonly satisfactory, but typical.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[NATURE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS OF BURROWING CRAYFISHES IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 13, 1883, I chanced to enter a meadow a few miles above\r\nWashington, on the Virginia side of the Potomac, at the head of a small\r\nstream emptying into the river. It was between two hills, at an\r\nelevation of 100 feet above the Potomac, and about a mile from the\r\nriver. Here I saw many clayey mounds covering burrows scattered over the\r\nground irregularly both upon the banks of the stream and in the adjacent\r\nmeadow, even as far as ten yards from the bed of the brook. My curiosity\r\nwas aroused, and I explored several of the holes, finding in each a\r\ngood-sized crayfish, which Prof. Walter Faxon identified as _Cambarus\r\ndiogenes_, Girard _(C. obesus_, Hagen), otherwise known as the burrowing\r\ncrayfish. I afterward visited the locality several times, collecting\r\nspecimens of the mounds and crayfishes, which are now in the United\r\nStates National Museum, and making observations.\r\n\r\nAt that time of the year the stream was receding, and the meadow was\r\nbeginning to dry. At a period not over a month previous, the meadows, at\r\nleast as far from the stream as the burrows were found, had been covered\r\nwith water. Those burrows near the stream were less than six inches\r\ndeep, and there was a gradual increase in depth as the distance from the\r\nstream became greater. Moreover, the holes farthest from the stream were\r\nin nearly every case covered by a mound, while those nearer had either a\r\nvery small chimney or none at all, and subsequent visits proved that at\r\nthat time of year the mounds were just being constructed, for each time\r\nI revisited the place the mounds were more numerous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1 Section of Crayfish burrow]\r\n\r\nThe length, width, general direction of the burrows, and number of the\r\nopenings were extremely variable, and the same is true of the mounds.\r\nFig. 1 illustrates a typical burrow shown in section. Here the main\r\nburrow is very nearly perpendicular, there being but one oblique opening\r\nhaving a very small mound, and the main mound is somewhat wider than\r\nlong. Occasionally the burrows are very tortuous, and there are often\r\ntwo or three extra openings, each sometimes covered by a mound. There is\r\nevery conceivable shape and size in the chimneys, ranging from a mere\r\nridge of mud, evidently the first foundation, to those with a breadth\r\none-half the height. The typical mound is one which covers the\r\nperpendicular burrow in Fig. 1, its dimensions being six inches broad\r\nand four high. Two other forms are shown in Fig. 2. The burrows near the\r\nstream were seldom more than six inches deep, being nearly\r\nperpendicular, with an enlargement at the base, and always with at least\r\none oblique opening. The mounds were usually of yellow clay, although in\r\none place the ground was of fine gravel, and there the chimneys were of\r\nthe same character. They were always circularly pyramidal in shape, the\r\nhole inside being very smooth, but the outside was formed of irregular\r\nnodules of clay hardened in the sun and lying just as they fell when\r\ndropped from the top of the mound. A small quantity of grass and leaves\r\nwas mixed through the mound, but this was apparently accidental.\r\n\r\nThe size of the burrows varied from half an inch to two inches in\r\ndiameter, being smooth for the entire distance, and nearly uniform in\r\nwidth. Where the burrow was far distant from the stream, the upper part\r\nwas hard and dry. In the deeper holes I invariably found several\r\nenlargements at various points in the burrow. Some burrows were three\r\nfeet deep, indeed they all go down to water, and, as the water in the\r\nground lowers, the burrow is undoubtedly projected deeper. The diagonal\r\nopenings never at that season of the year have perfect chimneys, and\r\nseldom more than a mere rim. In no case did I find any connection\r\nbetween two different burrows. In digging after the inhabitants I was\r\nseldom able to secure a specimen from the deeper burrows, for I found\r\nthat the animal always retreated to the extreme end, and when it could\r\ngo no farther would use its claws in defense. Both males and females\r\nhave burrows, but they were never found together, each burrow having but\r\na single individual. There is seldom more than a pint of water in each\r\nhole, and this is muddy and hardly suitable to sustain life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2 Crayfish Mound]\r\n\r\nThe neighboring brooks and springs were inhabited by another species of\r\ncrayfish, _Cambaras bartonii_, but although especial search was made for\r\nthe burrowing species, in no case was a single specimen found outside of\r\nthe burrows. _C. bartonii_ was taken both in the swiftly running\r\nportions of the stream and in the shallow side pools, as well as in the\r\nsprings at the head of small rivers. It would swim about in all\r\ndirections, and was often found under stones and in little holes and\r\ncrevices, none of which appeared to have been made for the purpose of\r\nretreat, but were accidental. The crayfishes would leave these little\r\nretreats whenever disturbed, and swim away down stream out of sight.\r\nThey were often found some distance from the main stream under rocks\r\nthat had been covered by the brook at a higher watermark; but although\r\nthere was very little water under the rocks, and the stream had not\r\ncovered them for at least two weeks, they showed no tendency to burrow.\r\nNor have I ever found any burrows formed by the river species _Cumbarus\r\naffinis._ although I have searched over miles of marsh land on the\r\nPotomac for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2 Crayfish Mound (shorter)]\r\n\r\nThe brook near where my observations were made was fast decreasing in\r\nvolume, and would probably continue to do so until in July its bed would\r\nbe nearly dry. During the wet seasons the meadow is itself covered. Even\r\nin the banks of the stream, then under water, there were holes, but they\r\nall extended obliquely without exception, there being no perpendicular\r\nburrows and no mounds. The holes extended in about six inches, and there\r\nwas never a perpendicular branch, nor even an enlargement at the end. I\r\nalways found the inhabitant near the mouth, and by quickly cutting off\r\nthe rear part of the hole could force him out, but unless forcibly\r\ndriven out it would never leave the hole, not even when a stick was\r\nthrust in behind it. It was undoubtedly this species that Dr. Godman\r\nmentioned in his \"Rambles of a Naturalist,\" and which Dr. Abbott _(Am.\r\nNal.,_ 1873, p. 81) refers to _C. bartonii_. Although I have no proof\r\nthat this is so, I am inclined to believe that the burrowing crayfishes\r\nretire to the stream in winter and remain there until early spring, when\r\nthey construct their burrows for the purpose of rearing their young and\r\nescaping the summer droughts. My reason for saying this is that I found\r\none burrow which on my first visit was but six inches deep, and later\r\nhad been projected to a depth at least twice as great, and the\r\ninhabitant was an old female.\r\n\r\nI think that after the winter has passed, and while the marsh is still\r\ncovered with water, impregnation takes place and burrows are immediately\r\nbegun. I do not believe that the same burrow is occupied for more than\r\none year, as it would probably fill up during the winter. At first it\r\nburrows diagonally, and as long as the mouth is covered with water is\r\nsatisfied with this oblique hole. When the water recedes, leaving the\r\nopening uncovered, the burrow must be dug deeper, and the economy of a\r\nperpendicular burrow must immediately suggest itself. From that time the\r\nperpendicular direction is preserved with more or less regularity.\r\nImmediately after the perpendicular hole is begun, a shorter opening to\r\nthe surface is needed for conveying the mud from the nest, and then the\r\nperpendicular opening is made. Mud from this, and also from the first\r\npart of the perpendicular burrow, is carried out of the diagonal opening\r\nand deposited on the edge. If a freshet occurs before this rim of mud\r\nhas had a chance to harden, it is washed away, and no mound is formed\r\nover the oblique burrow.\r\n\r\nAfter the vertical opening is made, as the hole is bored deeper, mud is\r\ndeposited on the edge, and the deeper it is dug the higher the mound. I\r\ndo not think that the chimney is a necessary part of the nest, but\r\nsimply the result of digging. I carried away several mounds, and in a\r\nweek revisited the place, and no attempt had been made to replace them;\r\nbut in one case, where I had in addition partly destroyed the burrow by\r\ndropping mud into it, there was a simple half rim of mud around the\r\nedge, showing that the crayfish had been at work; and as the mud was dry\r\nthe clearing must have been done soon after my departure. That the\r\ncrayfish retreats as the water in the ground falls lower and lower is\r\nproved by the fact that at various intervals there are bottled-shaped\r\ncavities marking the end of the burrow at an earlier period. A few of\r\nthose mounds farthest from the stream had their mouths closed by a\r\npellet of mud. It is said that all are closed during the summer months.\r\n\r\nHow these animals can live for months in the muddy, impure water is to\r\nme a puzzle. They are very sluggish, possessing none of the quick\r\nmotions of their allied _C. bartonii,_ for when taken out and placed\r\neither in water or on the ground, they move very slowly. The power of\r\nthrowing off their claws when these are grasped is often exercised.\r\nAbout the middle of May the eggs hatch, and for a time the young cling\r\nto the mother, but I am unable to state how long they remain thus. After\r\nhatching they must grow rapidly, and soon the burrow will be too small\r\nfor them to live in, and they must migrate. It would be interesting to\r\nknow more about the habits of this peculiar species, about which so\r\nlittle has been written. An interesting point to settle would be how and\r\nwhere it gets its food. The burrow contains none, either animal or\r\nvegetable. Food must be procured at night, or when the sun is not\r\nshining brightly. In the spring and fall the green stalks of meadow\r\ngrasses would furnish food, but when these become parched and dry they\r\nmust either dig after and eat the roots, or search in the stream. I feel\r\nsatisfied that they do not tunnel among the roots, for if they did so\r\nthese burrows would be frequently met with. Little has as yet been\r\npublished upon this subject, and that little covers only two spring\r\nmonths--April and May--and it would be interesting if those who have an\r\nopportunity to watch the species during other seasons, or who have\r\nobserved them at any season of the year, would make known their results.\r\n\r\nRALPH S. TARR\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR SERVANTS, THE MICROBES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho of us has not, in a partially darkened room, seen the rays of the\r\nsun, as they entered through apertures or chinks in the shutters,\r\nexhibit their track by lighting up the infinitely small corpuscles\r\ncontained in the air? Such corpuscles always exist, except in the\r\natmosphere of lofty mountains, and they constitute the dust of the air.\r\nA microscopic examination of them is a matter of curiosity. Each flock\r\nis a true museum (Fig. 1), wherein we find grains of mineral substances\r\nassociated with organic debris, and germs of living organisms, among\r\nwhich must be mentioned the _microbes_.\r\n\r\nSince the splendid researches of Mr. Pasteur and his pupils on\r\nfermentation and contagious diseases, the question of microbes has\r\nbecome the order of the day.\r\n\r\nIn order to show our readers the importance of the study of the\r\nmicrobes, and the results that may be reached by following the\r\nscientific method created by Mr. Pasteur, it appears to us indispensable\r\nto give a summary of the history of these organisms. In the first place,\r\nwhat is a microbe? Although much employed, the word has not been well\r\ndefined, and it would be easy to find several definitions of it. In its\r\nmost general sense, the term microbe designates certain colorless algæ\r\nbelonging to the family Bacteriaceæ, the principal forms of which are\r\nknown under the name of _Micrococcus. Bacterium, Bacillus. Vibrio,\r\n/Spirillum, etc_.\r\n\r\nIn order to observe these different forms of Bacteriaceæ it is only\r\nnecessary to examine microscopically a drop of water in which organic\r\nmatter has been macerated, when there will be seen _Micrococci_ (Fig. 2,\r\nI.)looking like spherical granules, _Bacteria_ in the form of very short\r\nrods, _Bacilli_ (Fig. 2, V.), _Vibriones_ (Fig. 2, IV.,) moving their\r\nstraight or curved filaments, and _Spirilli_ (Fig. 2, VI.), rolled up\r\nspirally. These varied forms are not absolutely constant, for it often\r\nhappens in the course of its existence that a species assumes different\r\nshapes, so that it is difficult to take the form of these algæ as a\r\nbasis for classifying them, when all the phases of their development\r\nhave not been studied.\r\n\r\nThe Bacteriaceæ are reproduced with amazing rapidity. If the temperature\r\nis proper, a limpid liquid such as chicken or veal broth will, in a few\r\nhours, become turbid and contain millions of these organisms.\r\nMultiplication is effected through fission, that is to say, each globule\r\nor filament, after elongating, divides into two segments, each of which\r\nincreases in its turn, to again divide into two parts, and so on (Fig.\r\n2, I. b). But multiplication in this way only takes place when the\r\nbacteria are placed in a proper nutritive liquid; and it ceases when the\r\nliquid becomes impoverished and the conditions of life become difficult.\r\nIt is at this moment that the formation of _spores_ occurs--reproductive\r\nbodies that are destined to permit the algæ to traverse, without\r\nperishing, those phases where life is impossible. The spores are small,\r\nbrilliant bodies that form in the center or at the extremity of each\r\narticulation or globule of the bacterium (Fig. 2, II. l), and are set\r\nfree through the breaking up of the joints. There are, therefore, two\r\nphases to be distinguished in the life of microbes--that of active life,\r\nduring which they multiply with great rapidity, are most active, and\r\ncause sicknesses or fermentations, and that of retarded life, that is to\r\nsay, the state, of resting spores in which the organisms are inactive\r\nand consequently harmless. It is curious to find that the resistance to\r\nthe two causes of destruction is very different in the two cases.\r\n\r\nIn the state of active life the bacterides are killed by a temperature\r\nof from 70 to 80 degrees, while the spores require the application of a\r\ntemperature of from 100 to 120 degrees to kill them. Oxygen of a high\r\npressure, which is, as well known from Bert's researches, a poison for\r\nliving beings, kills many bacteria in the state of active life, but has\r\nno influence upon their spores.\r\n\r\nIn a state of active life the bacteriae are interesting to study. The\r\nabsence of green matter prevents them from feeding upon mineral matter,\r\nand they are therefore obliged to subsist upon organic matter, just as\r\ndo plants that are destitute of chlorophyl (such as fungi, broomrapes,\r\netc.). This is why they are only met with in living beings or upon\r\norganic substances. The majority of these algae develop very well in the\r\nair, and then consume oxygen and exhale carbonic acid, like all living\r\nbeings. If the supply of air be cut off, they resist asphyxia and take\r\nthe oxygen that they require from the compounds that surround them. The\r\nresult is a complete and rapid decomposition of the organic materials,\r\nor a fermentation. Finally, there are even certain species that die in\r\nthe presence of free oxygen, and that can only live by protecting\r\nthemselves from contact with this gas through a sort of jelly. These are\r\nferments, such as _Bacillus amylobacter,_ or butyric ferment, and _B.\r\nsepticus_, or ferment of the putrefaction of nitrogenized substances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--ATMOSPHERIC DUST.]\r\n\r\nThese properties explain the regular distribution of bacteria in liquids\r\nexposed to the air. Thus, in water in which plants have been macerated\r\nthe surface of the liquid is occupied by _Bacillus subtilis_. which has\r\nneed of free oxygen in order to live, while in the bulk of the liquid,\r\nin the vegetable tissues, we find other bacteria, notably _B.\r\namylobacter_, which lives very well by consuming oxygen in a state of\r\ncombination. Bacteria, then, can only live in organic matters, now in\r\nthe presence and now in the absence of air.\r\n\r\nWhat we have just said allows us to understand the process of\r\ncultivating these organisms. When it is desired to obtain these algae,\r\nwe must take organic matters or infusions of such. These liquids or\r\nsubstances are heated to at least 120° in order to kill the germs that\r\nthey may contain, and this is called \"sterilizing.\" In this sterilized\r\nliquid are then sown the bacteria that it is desired to study, and by\r\nthis means they can be obtained in a state of very great purity.\r\n\r\nThe Bacteriaceae are very numerous. Among them we must distinguish those\r\nthat live in inert organic matters, alimentary substances, or debris of\r\nliving beings, and which cause chemical decompositions called\r\nfermentations. Such are _Mycoderma aceti_, which converts the alcohol of\r\nfermented beverages into vinegar; _Micrococcus ureae_, which converts\r\nthe urea of urine into carbonate of ammonia, and _Micrococcus\r\nnitrificans,_ which converts nitrogenized matters into intrates, etc.\r\nSome, that live upon food products, produce therein special coloring\r\nmatters; such are the bacterium of blue milk, and _Micrococcus\r\nprodigiosus_ (Fig. 2, I.), a red alga that lives upon bread and forms\r\nthose bloody spots that were formerly considered by the superstitious as\r\nthe precursors of great calamities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--VARIOUS MICROBES. (Highly magnified.)]\r\n\r\nAnother group of bacteria has assumed considerable importance in\r\npathology, and that is the one whose species inhabit the tissues of\r\nliving animals, and cause more or less serious alterations therein, and\r\noften death. Most contagious diseases and epidemics are due to algæ of\r\nthis latter group. To cite only those whose origin is well known, we may\r\nmention the bacterium that causes charbon, the micrococcus of chicken\r\ncholera, and that of hog measles.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this sketch how important the study of these\r\norganisms is to man, since be must defend his body against their\r\ninvasions or utilize them for bringing about useful chemical\r\nmodifications in organic matters.\r\n\r\n_Our Servants._--We scarcely know what services microbes may render us,\r\nyet the study of them, which has but recently been begun, has already\r\nshown, through the remarkable labors of Messrs. Pasteur, Schloesing and\r\nMuntz, Van Tieghem, Cohn, Koch, etc., the importance of these organisms\r\nin nature. All of us have seen wine when exposed to air gradually sour,\r\nand become converted into vinegar, and we know that in this case the\r\nsurface of the liquid is covered with white pellicles called \"mother of\r\nvinegar.\" These pellicles are made up of myriads of globules of\r\n_Mycoderma aceti_. This mycoderm is the principal agent in the\r\nacidification of wine, and it is it that takes oxygen from the air and\r\nfixes it in the alcohol to convert it into vinegar. If the pellicle that\r\nforms becomes immersed in the liquid, the wine will cease to sour.\r\n\r\nThe vinegar manufacturers of Orleans did not suspect the role of the\r\nmother of vinegar in the production of this article when they were\r\nemploying empirical processes that had been established by practice. The\r\nvats were often infested by small worms (\"vinegar eals\") which disputed\r\nwith the mycoderma for the oxygen, killed it through submersion, and\r\ncaused the loss of batches that had been under troublesome preparation\r\nfor months. Since Mr. Pasteur's researches, the _Mycoderma aceti_ has\r\nbeen sown directly in the slightly acidified wine, and an excellent\r\nquality of vinegar has thus been obtained, with no fear of an occurrence\r\nof the disasters that accompanied the old process.\r\n\r\nAnother example will show us the microbes in activity in the earth. Let\r\nus take a pinch of vegetable mould, water it with ammonia compounds, and\r\nanalyze it, and we shall find nitrates therein. Whence came these\r\nnitrates? They came from the oxidation of the ammonia compounds brought\r\nabout by moistening, since the nitrogen of the air does not seem to\r\ncombine under normal conditions with the surrounding oxygen. This\r\noxidation of ammonia compounds is brought about, as has been shown by\r\nMessrs. Schloesing and Muntz, by a special ferment, the _Micrococcus\r\nnitrificans_, that belongs to the group of Bacteriacæ. In fact, the\r\nvapors of chloroform, which anesthetize plants, also prevent\r\nnitrification, since they anaesthetize the nitric ferment. So, too, when\r\nwe heat vegetable humus to 100°, nitrification is arrested, because the\r\nferment is killed. Finally, we may sow the nitric ferment in calcined\r\nearth and cause nitrification to occur therein as surely as we can bring\r\nabout a fermentation in wine by sowing _Mycoderma aceti_ in it.\r\n\r\nThe nitric ferment exists in all soils and in all latitudes, and\r\nconverts the ammoniacal matters carried along by the rain into nitrates\r\nof a form most assimilable by plants. It therefore constitutes one of\r\nthe important elements for fertilizing the earth.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must refer to the numerous bacteria that occasion\r\nputrefaction in vegetable or animal organisms. These microbes, which\r\nfloat in the air, fall upon dead animals or plants, develop thereon, and\r\nconvert into mineral matters the immediate principles of which the\r\ntissues are composed, and thus continually restore to the air and soil\r\nthe elements necessary for the formation of new organic substances.\r\nThus, _Bacillus amylobacter_ (Fig. 2, II.), as Mr. Van Tieghem has\r\nshown, subsists upon the hydrocarbons contained in plants, and\r\ndisorganizes vegetable tissues in disengaging hydrogen, carbonic acid,\r\nand vegetable acids. _Bacterium roseopersicina_ forms, in pools, rosy or\r\nred pellicles that cover vegetable debris and disengage gases of an\r\noffensive odor. This bacterium develops in so great quantity upon low\r\nshores covered with fragments of algæ as to sometimes spread over an\r\nextent of several kilometers. These microbes, like many others,\r\ncontinuously mineralize organic substances, and thus exhibit themselves\r\nas the indispensable agents of the movement of the matter that\r\nincessantly circulates from the mineral to the organic world, and _vice\r\nversa_.--_Science et Nature._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPalms sprouted from seeds kept warm by contact of the vessel with the\r\nwater boiler of a kitchen range are grown by a man in New York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEPITAPHIUM CHYMICUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following epitaph was written by a Dr. Godfrey, who died in Dublin\r\nin 1755:\r\n\r\n  Here lieth, to _digest macerate_, and _amalgamate_ into clay,\r\n  _In Batneo Arenæ_,\r\n  _Stratum super Stratum_\r\n  The _Residuum, Terra damnata_ and _Caput Mortuum_,\r\n  Of BOYLE GODFREY, Chymist and M.D.\r\n  A man who in this Earthly Laboratory pursued various\r\n  _Processes_ to obtain _Arcanum Vitæ_,\r\n  Or the Secret to Live;\r\n  Also _Aurum Vitæ_,\r\n  or the art of getting rather than making gold.\r\n  _Alchymist_-like, all his Labour and _Projection_,\r\n  as _Mercury_ in the Fire, _Evaporated_ in _Fume_ when he\r\n  _Dissolved_ to his first principles.\r\n  He _departed_ as poor\r\n  as the last drops of an _Alembic_; for Riches are not\r\n  poured on the _Adepts_ of this world.\r\n  Though fond of News, he carefully avoided the\r\n  _Fermentation, Effervescence_, and _Decrepitation_ of this\r\n  life.

In Europe\r\nit was cultivated before the period of history, as samples have been\r\nrecovered from the lacustrine dwellings of Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe first wheat raised in the \"New World\" was sown by the Spaniards on\r\nthe island of Isabella, in January, 1494, and on March the 30th the ears\r\nwere gathered. The foundation of the wheat harvest of Mexico is said to\r\nhave been three or four grains carefully cultivated in 1530, and\r\npreserved by a slave of Cortez. The first crop of Quito was raised by a\r\nFranciscan monk in front of the convent. Garcilasso de la Vega affirms\r\nthat in Peru, up to 1658, wheaten bread had not been sold in Cusco.\r\nWheat was first sown by Goshnold Cuttyhunk, on one of the Elizabeth\r\nIslands in Buzzard's Bay, off Massachusetts, in 1602, when he first\r\nexplored the coast. In 1604, on the island of St. Croix, near Calais,\r\nMe., the Sieur de Monts had some wheat sown which flourished finely. In\r\n1611 the first wheat appears to have been sown in Virginia. In 1626,\r\nsamples of wheat grown in the Dutch Colony at New Netherlands were shown\r\nin Holland. It is probable that wheat was sown in the Plymouth Colony\r\nprior to 1629, though we find no record of it, and in 1629 wheat was\r\nordered from England to be used as seed. In 1718 wheat was introduced\r\ninto the valley of the Mississippi by the \"Western Company.\" In 1799 it\r\nwas among the cultivated crops of the Pimos Indians of the Gila River,\r\nNew Mexico.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF STARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Bunzener and Fries _(Zeitschrift fur das gesammte\r\nBrauwesen_), a thick, sirupy starch paste prepared with a boiling one\r\nper cent solution of salicylic acid is only very slowly saccharified,\r\nand on cooling deposits crystalline plates of starch. For the\r\ndetermination of starch in barley the finely-ground sample is boiled for\r\nthree-quarters of an hour with about thirty times its weight of a one\r\nper cent solution of salicylic acid, the resulting colorless opalescent\r\nliquid filtered with the aid of suction, and the starch therein inverted\r\nby means of hydrochloric acid. The dextrose formed is estimated by\r\nFehling's solution. The results are one to two per cent higher than when\r\nthe starch is brought into solution by water at 135° C.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION, $5 A YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
