BAKER, _Treas._\r\n\r\n\r\n           _Copyrighted by Bradley Fertiliser Co., 1892._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Cranberry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is not intended to be a scientific or elaborate treatise\r\nupon the Cranberry, but rather a book of practical suggestions, and\r\na summary of helpful hints that may prove of benefit to those who\r\nundertake to grow this fruit.\r\n\r\nThe methods of growing Cranberries vary with localities and growers,\r\nand are undoubtedly in an experimental state at the present time. The\r\noriginal Cranberry grower was the owner of some wild and uncultivated\r\npatch where, in a natural condition, the berries (receiving no\r\nattention until picking time) were gathered “at halves,” meeting\r\nlittle or no market beyond the limits of the locality in which they\r\ngrew.\r\n\r\nThe modern grower has found the application of improved methods of\r\ncultivation and fertilization to pay liberally with the Cranberry,\r\nas with every other crop, and it should be his endeavor, through all\r\navailable methods, to reduce the cost of growing and increase the\r\nyield of berries per acre, giving special attention to such culture\r\nas may the better secure the _keeping quality_ of the fruit.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, the grower may have to lay aside his\r\npreconceived notions as to the best methods of growing and\r\nfertilization, and possibly even discard some which have in years\r\npast been approved by leading growers. By a careful selection of\r\nvarieties best adapted to each particular locality, or frequently\r\nby a larger increase in the depth of sand upon the bog, and then by\r\nthe greatest care in all that pertains to the picking and packing\r\nof the fruit, he will be enabled to maintain for the Cape berries a\r\nforemost reputation as “keepers” among those who handle this valuable\r\ncrop. Too little attention has heretofore been paid to this essential\r\nfeature, and quantity rather than quality has been sought. When\r\nsecured, the berries, as a general thing, are hurriedly packed at the\r\nbog, usually warm from the vines, and so, oft-times, they are almost\r\nruined before reaching a market. This practice is largely responsible\r\nfor the prejudice of some dealers against Cape berries.\r\n\r\nAgain, improved methods of cultivation by which an increased\r\nproduction, with improved quality, may be secured, are certainly\r\ndesirable to every individual grower; though the present enormous\r\ncrop would hardly seem to warrant a larger acreage, yet, at the same\r\ntime, it behooves every grower to make as productive as possible (in\r\nview of the great expenditure) each acre already under cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe matter here presented is the result of thorough investigation\r\ninto the methods of cultivation as practised by the most successful\r\ngrowers, and we believe it presents facts to the grower which will\r\nprove well worthy of his careful attention.\r\n\r\n                                               BRADLEY FERTILIZER CO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE BOG.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is popularly supposed that the Cranberry flourishes upon Cape\r\nCod because of the salt sea sand of which the Cape is so largely\r\ncomposed. This theory, however, is erroneous, as it has been proved\r\nthat even on Cape Cod the Cranberry will not flourish except under\r\ncertain other favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nThe first inquiry, then, is, What kind of land is preferable for a\r\nbog? The best growers select a laurel, maple, or cedar swamp, so\r\nsituated that it can be easily flowed with water at any time when\r\nthis may seem necessary. They select a swamp in preference to a\r\nmeadow, because it is found in practice that a meadow always produces\r\nconsiderable coarse grass detrimental to the crop, which does not\r\ngrow in the swamps.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is proved that a swamp on which wood has grown has a better\r\nbottom than the average meadow, as it is largely composed of decayed\r\nfoliage, which has for many years dropped from the trees, and has\r\ngradually become a rich, friable soil, usually free from either weeds\r\nor grass.\r\n\r\nSome growers believe that it is not essential to have the bog so\r\nsituated that it can be covered by water; but, while there are some\r\nvery fine dry Cranberry bogs of this description, if an early frost\r\nor the fire-worm strikes the crop at a vital time, it causes an\r\nentire failure, which could have been prevented had there been a\r\nchance of promptly flowing the bog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HOW TO PREPARE A BOG.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cranberry bog is usually prepared in late fall, winter, or early\r\nspring, when the ground is partially frozen, as it is more easily\r\ncleared at this time, and cheaper labor is obtainable.\r\n\r\nThe first step in preparing the bog is to mow off, with a bush\r\nscythe, all the small brush and undergrowth. We are then ready to\r\nget rid of the trees. Experience has proved that the cheaper way is\r\nto cut the roots of the large trees, and then by means of tackle,\r\nin case they do not fall by their own weight, pull them over to the\r\nground. This saves many days’ labor, which would be necessary if the\r\ntrees were cut down above the ground and the stumps then dug out.\r\n\r\nThe refuse materials should be gathered into heaps, and, when dried,\r\nburned upon the bog; but great care is necessary in burning not to\r\nallow the moss and turf, of which the bog is composed, to get on\r\nfire; for when once fairly started, it is nearly impossible, except\r\nby flowing the bog, to extinguish the flames.\r\n\r\nThese first steps in clearing the bog must be done in the best\r\npossible manner, preferably by day labor, under the direct care of\r\na watchful foreman, as the ultimate success of the Cranberry bog\r\ndepends very largely upon the thoroughness with which all of the tree\r\nand bush roots are removed.\r\n\r\nAfter the surface of the bog has been thoroughly cleaned off, it\r\nis cut into squares, about eighteen inches across, by means of a\r\nturf-axe, which is a thin, hatchet-shaped bladed implement, with a\r\nstout, hickory handle, about thirty inches long. This axe is utilized\r\nfor cutting the tough, undergrowing roots, sure to be found just\r\nbelow the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe usual method is to cut across the bog in parallel lines eighteen\r\ninches apart, and again at right angles in parallel lines in the same\r\nmanner, thus leaving the turf in square blocks about eighteen inches\r\nsquare. Two men with long-handled, four-pronged bog-hooks follow\r\nthe cutters, pulling over the turf, which, after the ditching is\r\nfinished, should be chopped up, and so rendered suitable for making\r\nthe surface as smooth as possible, when the work of final grading is\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nWe are now ready for ditching; the manner and methods necessary to\r\nsecure the best possible drainage being subject, of course, to such\r\nvaried conditions as to render it difficult to describe. But if there\r\nwere but three essential features of special importance, two of them\r\nwould be drainage.\r\n\r\nAll of the ditches should be dug with flaring banks, so as to prevent\r\ncaving in of the sides of the ditch, and thus making constant\r\ntrouble. A ditch, in any case, around the entire bog is an essential\r\nfeature in drainage, and to carry-off the cold surface water, as well\r\nas a preventive of much difficulty in cultivation, etc.\r\n\r\nIf the ditches are thoroughly well made they will need but little\r\nrepairing or cleaning, and here as elsewhere in preparing the bog the\r\nmost careful attention on the part of the superintendent will prove\r\nthe cheapest in the end.\r\n\r\nAfter the ditches are completed, the bog must be graded until it is\r\nas smooth and level as a lawn. In grading the bog the levels must\r\nbe run in such a manner that it can be easily flooded with water,\r\nsince sometimes it may be desirable to do this as expeditiously\r\nas possible, and the necessary arrangements to do this should be\r\nprovided at this time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                 NORTH HARWICH, MASS., Oct. 19, 1891.\r\n\r\n  I have been in the habit of using Bradley’s Fertilizer on my\r\n  cranberry bogs for a number of years, and consider it very\r\n  beneficial. It pushes the new vines along to a bearing condition\r\n  much earlier than would be the case if left to depend on the\r\n  natural strength of the soil, and by covering the ground quicker\r\n  with vines the grass and brush are not so likely to get a start.\r\n\r\n  It also does well on old vines, increasing the crop, and the size\r\n  and quality of the berry. Last spring, to my sorrow, I neglected to\r\n  apply this phosphate to my old bog, and on gathering my crop this\r\n  fall I found I had made a great mistake. Shall use it another year,\r\n  without fail.\r\n\r\n                                                       BENJ. F. HALL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                   HARWICHPORT, MASS., Oct. 19, 1891.\r\n\r\n  I have used Bradley’s Fertilizer for growing cranberries, and find\r\n  it very beneficial. New vines come to bearing one year earlier by\r\n  its use, and grass and weeds are crowded out, and do not get the\r\n  foothold they are apt to where vines grow slowly, and are a long\r\n  while covering the ground.\r\n\r\n  Cranberry growers in this section are finding it greatly to their\r\n  interest to use Bradley’s Fertilizer on their bogs, both new and\r\n  old.\r\n\r\n  About the 1st of June, 1891, I put on 100 pounds of Bradley’s\r\n  Fertilizer on about 60 rods of late vines, set out 20 years ago. On\r\n  the other side of the ditch were 60 rods of vines, the same age,\r\n  both done by the same man; in other words, the same conditions\r\n  exactly, except the Fertilizer. This year I gathered both pieces.\r\n  The piece to which I applied 100 pounds of Fertilizer yielded 8\r\n  barrels of cranberries, the other, barely 1 barrel.\r\n\r\n                                                         E. B. ALLEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE DAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA dam must be built at the lower end of the bog, in such a manner\r\nas seems necessary from the location and force of the water running\r\nthrough the main ditch. If the main ditch is a brook which carries\r\na large amount of surplus water, the dam must be very strongly and\r\nthoroughly built; but if, on the other hand, it is simply a ditch\r\nfilled by springs or small brooks found in the bog, a simple dam can\r\nbe thrown up at slight cost; although care must be taken to make\r\nit strong enough, so that the high water in winter or spring will\r\nnot carry it away and leave the vines unprotected from the frost.\r\nIf the bog is of large size, and a large amount of water is needed,\r\nof course a larger and more substantial dam must be built. The\r\naccompanying illustration gives a section of a turf dam, preferably\r\nabout fifteen feet wide at the bottom by ten feet at the top,\r\nconstructed of turf, and sand or clay, in such a manner as to be\r\nabsolutely safe.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the walls slope from the foundation to the top,\r\nand are composed outside of layers of turf, so laid one upon the\r\nother that the joints are broken and a solid wall is made, between\r\nwhich is filled in a mass of stone, clay, and sand, thoroughly tamped\r\ndown so as to make a firm structure in the centre of the dam. At the\r\nend of the main ditch should be constructed a water-course or flume,\r\npreferably of two-inch plank, with a waste-gate that can be raised or\r\nlowered as the supply of water may be needed or allowed to run to\r\nwaste. This is simply made of plank, with an oak joist for a lever,\r\nwhich, used as a pry, easily opens the gate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE SANDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sand used on a Cranberry bog should be absolutely free from\r\neither clay or loam, for if it contain either it will, in the one\r\ncase, under the action of sun and water, form a hard surface in which\r\nthe vines will not thrive, or in the other, if there is much loam\r\nintermixed, it will contain weed seeds, which will prove a detriment\r\nto the bog. Sand can generally be found in the immediate vicinity of\r\nthe bog, and should preferably be coarse rather than fine in quality.\r\n\r\nTo spread the sand over the bog, lay down a course of plank, over\r\nwhich the sand can be wheeled in barrows and so dumped, from this\r\nplank-walk, as to make the level spreading thereof a matter of little\r\nlabor; shift the plank about four feet from that portion already\r\ncovered, and dump to right and left as before; enough should be\r\nbrought on to give an even coating of from four to five inches, and\r\nit may be smoothed by a lawn rake, or a leveller made of one-inch\r\nboard, about a foot and a half long, by three or four inches wide,\r\nwith a rake handle fastened in the centre of the board.\r\n\r\nWhen the sand has been evenly spread over the bog, it is ready to\r\nbe marked off. This is generally done by using an improvised rake\r\nor “marker,” made of a piece of 2 by 4 inch joist, seven to ten feet\r\nlong, with white-oak teeth eight inches long, set eighteen inches\r\napart, the whole finished with a handle for easy working. This rake\r\nis usually run parallel with some straight ditch, or along one side\r\nof a bog in a straight line, so that when set in vines it may present\r\na uniform appearance. But as, in the case of corn, “more grows in\r\ncrooked rows than straight ones,” this may be left to taste and\r\nconvenience; again cross-marking at right angles, and you are ready\r\nfor setting the vines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                        NEWPORT, R.I., Oct. 26, 1891.\r\n\r\n  I have used Bradley’s Fertilizer on my cranberry bog twice, and\r\n  find a great improvement in checking the growth of moss, also\r\n  in starting the vines. In fact, I think it made the vines grow\r\n  too fast, or I may have put on too much. I can recommend it as a\r\n  first-class Fertilizer.\r\n\r\n                                                  H. B. RYDER,\r\n                                                      17 Harvard Ave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                 NORTH HARWICH, MASS., Oct. 19, 1891.\r\n\r\n  I have used Bradley’s Fertilizer on my cranberry bogs, both old\r\n  and new, the past three or four years, with highly satisfactory\r\n  results. It adds to the growth of new vines, so that they cover the\r\n  ground quicker, and come into bearing one or two years earlier than\r\n  they would were there no fertilizer applied.\r\n\r\n  On my old vines the effect of this Fertilizer has been to kill out\r\n  the moss (burn it up, to appearance), and to so renew the vines as\r\n  to give them the look of a young bog.\r\n\r\n                                                       JOHN E.

The fruit will generally be larger and fairer where it\r\n  is used, and used on young vines will cause them to spread and\r\n  shade the ground, thus preventing as large a growth of weeds. I\r\n  cheerfully recommend it to all cranberry growers.\r\n\r\n  The foreground shows vines set in the spring of 1890; the\r\n  background on the right new bearing bog, and on the left, a small\r\n  showing of vines set in spring of 1891.\r\n\r\n                                                       E. K. CROWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE BEST BERRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a wide division of opinion in regard to what is the best\r\nberry to grow; the shrewdest growers find that a selection of\r\nberries, running from the very early to the very late berry, gives\r\nthe best returns when a series of years is taken into account.\r\n\r\nBy common consent the purple-black berry, called “Early Black,” has\r\nbeen the favorite with both growers and consumers, as its handsome,\r\nrich coloring made it a good seller, while it is also a very prolific\r\nberry. It is a medium-hard berry, and for bogs which are liable to be\r\ninfested with the fire, fruit, or span worm it seems preferable, as\r\nthe bog can be kept under water until as late as the first or middle\r\nof June, and these berries will then, in an average season, ripen\r\nbefore frost. It is, however, pretty well conceded by many growers\r\nthat this berry has been of great injury to the business as a whole,\r\nsince it is one of the poorest of keepers, and, while affording\r\nprofit for the time to the grower, has been of such loss to the\r\n“middleman,” as to render him unduly cautious of Cape Cod berries.\r\nThis reputation which has attached itself to the Cape crop is wholly\r\nunwarranted by a careful and intelligent investigation of the many\r\nand various conditions which govern this, the most important feature\r\nof the whole business.\r\n\r\nThe “A. D. Makepeace” berry is the outcome of a berry found by\r\nits namesake, the largest grower in this country, and gradually\r\ncultivated until it is conceded to be the largest early berry in the\r\nmarket, and as such commands a high price. It is of cherry shape, and\r\nrose-tinged purple in coloring. Illustration No. 1 is a fair example\r\nof the shape of this berry.\r\n\r\nThe “James Anthony” is a very good variety of the second early\r\nberries, and by some considered among the best keepers of the\r\nmedium-early berries.\r\n\r\nThe “Bachelor” is a larger berry, and, like the “J. P. Howes,” proves\r\nto be a fair keeper and a salable berry, although the Howes is more\r\neven and regular in size.\r\n\r\nThe “McFarland” is a dark-red, handsome berry, of large size, and a\r\nfavorite with a few large growers.\r\n\r\nThe “Bugle” or “Chipman” is an older berry, and one of the best\r\nkeepers, but not as productive as some others.\r\n\r\nThe six varieties mentioned are the most popular grown. Some others\r\nmay have a local reputation, which time and attention will bring into\r\nfavorable notice. Local conditions have much to do, however, with\r\nqualities in all cases.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                   HARWICHPORT, MASS., Oct. 20, 1891.\r\n\r\n  I have used Bradley’s Fertilizer for a number of years on\r\n  cranberries, both on newly set vines and old vines. I apply it\r\n  broadcast, and I find it pays well. I can recommend it to be a good\r\n  investment, causing more and larger fruit.\r\n\r\n                                                    WATSON B. KELLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE PLANTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cranberry is propagated, through the means of vines which are\r\nprocured from old bogs; they are cut or mowed off, preferably from\r\nvines not more than three or four years old. In sorting these\r\ncuttings, care should be taken to remove all the dead wood, and only\r\nthe bright, clean cuttings used for planting. Most growers estimate\r\nfive barrels of cuttings to the acre of bog, as they use from four\r\nto six cuttings in each setting. Some growers prefer taking runners\r\ntwenty to thirty inches in length, and doubling them over at time of\r\nplanting; but the former seems to be the generally adopted method.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of planting is by using a “dibble,” or\r\nsetting-blade, made from hard wood, although one of the shrewdest\r\ngrowers has recently adopted an implement consisting of an iron\r\nblade, with a cross-piece handle of wood. He claims that this is\r\nfar preferable to any wooden instrument, and always readily presses\r\nthrough the sand, although it is not sharp enough to cut the vines.\r\n\r\nIn planting, a bunch of four or six runners is placed upon the sand\r\nat every intersecting corner. This bunch is held in the left hand of\r\nthe planter, while with his right hand he presses them into the sand\r\nby means of the “dibble,” so that they will reach through to the soil\r\nbeneath, and when planted will not come above the surface more than\r\ntwo inches. The accompanying sketch shows the method of planting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A A is the main ditch encircling the bog.\r\n  B B is the central ditch.\r\n  C C are the cross-ditches draining into main and central ditches.\r\n  D D are the lines made by the marker.\r\n  E E show points at which plants are set.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks after the cuttings are set, a small handful of\r\nBradley’s Superphosphate should be scattered around each bunch of\r\ncuttings, as this will cause them to grow with great vigor, and so\r\nstimulate their growth that few if any of the cuttings will die;\r\nsometimes not one in a hundred will fail to make a flourishing set.\r\nIt is a little more work, but advisable, to put the fertilizer in the\r\nhill, just under the sand.\r\n\r\nSome growers prefer, after the bog is planted, to keep the ground\r\nwet by damming back the water to within six or eight inches of\r\nthe surface of the bog, and keeping it here until the vines give\r\nsigns of having made some growth. The water is then let out of the\r\nditches, and the vines take care of themselves through the ensuing\r\nseason, unless it happens to be a particularly dry summer. If so,\r\nonce or twice, through the dryest of the season, the water should\r\nbe dammed back for a few days, and the vines receive the benefit\r\nof the irrigation. They will not need any further care during the\r\nfirst season, unless there is a growth of weeds, which should be\r\neffectually destroyed.\r\n\r\nA cleanly, well-kept bog is not only a beautiful sight, but is the\r\nfoundation for large returns in the future; it requires no little\r\ncare, during the first year or two, on the best of bogs to secure the\r\nproper money return, in order that the unavoidable outlay heretofore\r\noutlined may be rendered remunerative. Four hundred dollars per acre\r\nis no unusual amount to be expended in preparing a bog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FERTILIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil within a few years the Cranberry bog has had to depend upon its\r\nown resources for fertilization, as it was popularly supposed that a\r\nbog contained all the necessary nutriment to feed the growing crop.\r\nCareful investigation by the most successful growers has led them to\r\nbelieve that, in common with every other farm crop, a larger crop of\r\nfiner quality of fruit can be grown per acre, if a good commercial\r\nfertilizer is used upon the Cranberry. They therefore commence with\r\nthe plant when set out, and scatter a small quantity of fertilizer\r\naround each plant in setting, as we have before suggested on page 17;\r\nand each year thereafter they sow broadcast over the bog from 200 to\r\n400 pounds of Bradley’s Superphosphate to the acre. The result is\r\nthat a larger crop of richer-colored berries is secured, which will\r\nmore successfully withstand handling and shipping. The vines are also\r\nso stimulated that the crop ripens much earlier, and very often a\r\nsaving of hundreds of dollars will be made, through the grower being\r\nable to gather the berries early in the season, before the frost\r\ncomes.\r\n\r\nOn old bogs, which are partially run out, the influence of a liberal\r\ndressing of Bradley’s Superphosphate is very marked, as it gives the\r\nvines a fresh supply of needed food, and brings ample returns the\r\nfirst season in largely increased crops of berries.\r\n\r\nSo marked is this effect, that if any one having a Cranberry bog will\r\nfertilize a small section of it for one season, at the rate of 200\r\nto 400 pounds of Bradley’s Phosphate to the acre, he will always use\r\nthis fertilizer thereafter, as the results will readily prove that it\r\nwill pay him liberally to do so.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for fertilization is, that, through a liberal use of\r\nBradley’s Superphosphate, the young plants attain that sturdy growth\r\nwhich enables them to withstand more successfully the attacks of the\r\nfire, fruit, and span worm, which flourish best upon weak plants.\r\n\r\nThe common theory that a fertilizer is simply a stimulant, whose\r\ninfluence is of no permanent benefit, has been proved to be erroneous\r\nby the experiments of some of the largest growers, who, after having\r\nused Bradley’s Superphosphate, find that not only have they grown\r\nenormous crops of the best quality berries, but their bogs are\r\nannually in a better condition than their neighbors’ bogs which have\r\nnot been fertilized, and from which only small or average crops of\r\nberries have been secured.\r\n\r\nBy common consent, therefore, the leading growers are large users of\r\nBradley’s Superphosphate, as they are convinced that its liberal use\r\nupon their bogs is repaid to them every season in increased crops of\r\nperfect fruit which commands the highest market price.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                SOUTH YARMOUTH, MASS., Oct. 22, 1891.\r\n\r\n  I have used the Bradley Fertilizer on newly set cranberry vines,\r\n  and find it causes them to grow and spread more rapidly over a new\r\n  bog.\r\n\r\n                                                      JAMES F. SEARS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CRANBERRY ENEMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest enemies to successful Cranberry growing is one\r\nthat can be easily conquered, but which is oftenest neglected; that\r\nis, the weeds and small bushes when they first appear. It is a\r\ncomparatively easy matter under the more favorable conditions, during\r\nthe three years before the bog comes to full bearing, to go over it\r\nonce or twice during each season with a hoe, and clean out every weed\r\nand bush, no matter how small and insignificant it make look. But\r\nthe grower often thinks that this is unnecessary labor, especially\r\nas he has put considerable money into the bog, and as yet has had\r\nno returns from his investment. If this work is neglected now, when\r\nthe bog comes to fruiting there will be found, especially among the\r\nplants, quite an amount of injurious weeds and small bushes which\r\nincrease rapidly from year to year, and finally kill out the bog. But\r\nif during the first three years they are steadily and systematically\r\ncut down, they become so thoroughly eradicated that a little going\r\nover the bog every spring will keep it in good condition for ten or\r\nfifteen years, with little trouble from either weeds or bushes.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the Cranberry, ever since it has been\r\ncultivated for a crop, has been a practical exemplification of\r\nthe advice of that eminent agriculturist, Horace Greeley, who,\r\nfor the extermination of the Canadian thistle, recommended its\r\n“cultivation,” as then there would come plenty of enemies to\r\naccomplish its destruction.\r\n\r\nThe fire, span, tip, and fruit worms rank in the order named as the\r\nmost destructive,--the first two in the list blasting in a few hours\r\nan almost assured and abundant crop.\r\n\r\nThe larger growers, after experimenting with perhaps all of the\r\nknown insecticides, have most generally adopted some form of tobacco\r\npreparation, applied in solution in the form of a spray, upon the\r\nfirst indication of the approach of the fire-worm.\r\n\r\nSo extensive is the use of tobacco, that one grower, Mr. Franklin\r\nCrocker, of Hyannis, treasurer of the South Sea Cranberry Company,\r\nwho has probably given as much attention as any other grower to this\r\nbranch of the business, informs us that for himself and others he\r\npurchased, in its various forms, over five thousand dollars’ worth\r\nof tobacco during the past two years, for this purpose. Mr. Crocker\r\ntells of his experience with tobacco in his letter on page 3 of cover.\r\n\r\nMany growers (not all) are able to resort to “Spring Flowage” as an\r\neffective and cheap remedy for fire-worms. That this is effective\r\nthere can be no question, but in its application for destroying\r\nthe worm it is injurious to the keeping quality of the fruit when\r\ngathered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE HARVEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe picking of berries commences about the first of September. They\r\nshould be picked as soon as the greater part have put on a good, fair\r\ncolor. The great mistake in the past has been in allowing the berries\r\nto become over size. The trade has demanded _dark_ berries, which\r\nmade the Early Blacks so popular; but all that was gained in _color_\r\nwas at the sacrifice of the keeping quality, to the injury of the\r\ngrower and dealer.\r\n\r\nThis is becoming so well recognized that “pick early” comes with\r\nthe greater emphasis from all the larger dealers, who, by sad\r\nexperiences, have become more interested in this particular feature\r\nthan the grower, who, gathering his harvest of beautiful fruit, has\r\nalso immediately gathered in the skekels, recognizing that “the best\r\ntime to sell is right off the bog.” Thus has he “Sown to the Wind;”\r\nand while disaster has been delayed, its coming is manifest in the\r\nexperience of the past season, when in some cases the crop has not\r\npaid expenses.\r\n\r\nAn old receipt, “How to cook a hare,” began, “First catch the\r\nhare.” We have endeavored to tell you how to get the crop; and now,\r\nsupposing you have this, we will give you an idea of how it is\r\ngathered, so far as may be of interest to the uninitiated: Lines are\r\ndrawn across the bog, from eight to twenty feet apart, as a guide\r\nfor keeping in place those pickers who incline otherwise to the\r\nright or left, as “spots” thick or thin allure or repel them in their\r\neagerness “to fill the measure.” Then, placing as many pickers within\r\nthe lines as can have sufficient “elbow room,” picking length-wise,\r\nthey proceed to pick.\r\n\r\nAn overseer is needed for every twenty-five pickers, to see that the\r\nwork is properly done, each in his or her own place, and that all are\r\npicking clean from the vines, and from the “bottom;” that is, picking\r\nfrom the ground all scattering berries.\r\n\r\nMeasures holding six quarts are the most convenient size, and the\r\nusual price is ten cents per measure, each picker using generally\r\ntwo measures and so saving time, as the berries must be carried to\r\nthe “Tally.” The pickers are all known by numbers, and as they go to\r\nempty their measure they report “Number (5),” one or two measures,\r\nas the case may be, the Tally repeating each number and tally, as a\r\nprecaution against mistakes.\r\n\r\nOn some bogs checks are given thus: “Good for ten cents, South Sea\r\nCo., F. Crocker, Hyannis, Treas.;” and such checks are current coin\r\nduring “Cranberry time” for supplies at the stores.\r\n\r\nAgain, others provide themselves with a large amount of dimes, and so\r\n“pay off” as each measure is delivered. Berries, after being picked,\r\nshould be put in slatted boxes holding about one bushel each, as\r\nbeing the most convenient size to handle, and then put away for at\r\nleast twenty-four hours to cool off, as prevention against the almost\r\nimmediate process of decay if this is not done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BARRELLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter being thoroughly cooled they are put in screens about ten feet\r\nlong, three feet wide at the upper end, and six to eight inches\r\nat the lower end, from which, under the careful eye of an expert\r\n“screener,” they are “run” into a barrel set ready to receive them.\r\n\r\nFour or five screeners about each screen remove all trash and unsound\r\nberries, and sometimes the light-colored ones, which are held to\r\n“color up,” or packed separately and marked “Light.” As the barrels\r\nare being filled, they should be thoroughly shaken, at least three\r\ntimes; then, when the uninitiated packer thinks he has got the barrel\r\nfull enough, it needs from four to six quarts more, when, with a\r\nscrew, press the berries firmly down into the barrel. The barrels now\r\nproperly headed and nailed, carry the berries in shape to command the\r\nhighest price for which their grade may warrant. It _pays_ to pack\r\nthe fruit as _solid_ as possible, since, whether sound or otherwise,\r\na full barrel will _sell_ when one lacking one inch or more of\r\nberries will command little attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                  WEST HARWICH, MASS., Oct. 19, 1891.\r\n\r\n  In the spring of 1890 I bought an acre of cranberry bog that had\r\n  been set about 30 years, and was so run down as to bear only about\r\n  10 barrels per year. I immediately applied 400 pounds of Bradley’s\r\n  Fertilizer, and received the first year a crop of 22 barrels.\r\n\r\n  Last spring I applied 600 pounds of same Fertilizer, and have\r\n  just gathered 40 barrels of nice berries, making an increase of\r\n  30 barrels a year on one acre by the use of Bradley’s Fertilizer,\r\n  equal to 300 per cent. gain.\r\n\r\n  Besides all this improvement in the crop, the Fertilizer has had\r\n  the effect to renew the vines to such an extent as to give them\r\n  the appearance of a new bog, while the moss, which was quite\r\n  troublesome, has been wholly killed out. It is surprising to see\r\n  how quick moss will begin to disappear where Bradley’s Fertilizer\r\n  has been applied.\r\n\r\n                                                         W. P. BAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE 1891 CROP IN THE NEW ENGLAND STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following comparative statement of the 1891 crop of Cranberries\r\non Dec. 1, 1891, in the New England States, was compiled by Charles\r\nH. Nye, Esq., Superintendent Cape Cod Division, Old Colony Railroad,\r\nand allowing that 9,000 bushels may have been grown in Rhode Island\r\nand Connecticut, would make the 1891 crop about or quite 480,000\r\nbushels.\r\n\r\n  ============================+===============+========================\r\n                              |     1890.     |     1891.     |\r\n     STATIONS SHIPPED FROM.

It has been\r\nrepeatedly noticed that Cranberries grown on this fertilizer are more\r\nhighly colored, harder, and better “keepers” than those raised under\r\nordinary conditions of cultivation.\r\n\r\nAs Bradley’s Phosphate contains the very choicest quality of plant\r\nfoods in such forms and proportions as long practical experience has\r\ndemonstrated will most fully satisfy the demands of the crop for a\r\ncomplete and nutritious fertilizer, it wholly meets the requirements\r\nof the Cranberry, as has been abundantly proven by exhaustive tests\r\non the largest bogs.\r\n\r\nA “Special Fertilizer” for Cranberries, claimed to be “based on their\r\nanalysis,” may be taking with some; but this is only an _idea_,--a\r\n_theory_ without _practice_ to support it, an advertising dodge to\r\ncatch the uninitiated. The theory of feeding plants on this basis was\r\nexploded long ago both at home and abroad; and while formerly one\r\nmanufacturer of “Special Fertilizers” advertised twenty-four special\r\ncrop formulas, he now sells but ten, and the analyses of these are\r\ntotally different from the original formulas which were represented\r\nas accurate demonstrations of the “discovery,” so called.\r\n\r\nProfessor Johnson, Director of the Connecticut Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station, and one of the best authorities on agricultural\r\nchemistry of this country, has said: “_In honest truth, there is no\r\npossibility of compounding special fertilizers adapted to each of\r\nour various crops, nor even to our various classes of crops. Special\r\nmanures for particular crops are, in fact, least heard of where\r\nagriculture is guided by the clearest light of science and the widest\r\nrange of experience._”\r\n\r\nProfessor Atwater, recently Director of the Experiment Stations of\r\nthe United States at Washington, has stated: “_There is no best\r\nfertilizer for any crop, and the formulas to fit all cases are out of\r\nthe question._” So do not be caught by this _theory_ snare, and pay\r\nfour or five dollars a ton extra on your fertilizer for that “idea.”\r\n\r\nBradley’s Superphosphate has stood the test of nearly thirty years,\r\nand its sales are far greater than that of any other fertilizer on\r\nthe market. It is the acknowledged _Standard_, so recognized by\r\nits strongest competitors, whose favorite argument is that their\r\nfertilizer is “equal to Bradley’s.” “There are tricks in all trades,”\r\nbut no trick can undermine the stability of an article so universally\r\nrecognized as the _standard of excellence_ in its class as Bradley’s\r\nPhosphate.\r\n\r\nThe following letter may serve to answer inquiries about\r\n“_Insecticide_.”\r\n\r\n                                       HYANNIS, MASS., Feb. 22, 1892.\r\n\r\n  In regard to tobacco as an insecticide, I submit the following:\r\n  Tobacco solution is prepared by steeping tobacco stems in warm\r\n  water, using from one and a half to two pounds of stems to a gallon\r\n  of water, according to strength of stems in the nicotine principle.\r\n  So far, the larger growers prefer the stems from the Missouri-river\r\n  region, and for this purpose I ordered six car-loads last Saturday\r\n  from that section for the use of growers the coming season.\r\n\r\n  Of the solution, when prepared, it takes about one gallon to a\r\n  square rod, applied in the form of a spray as fine as possible.\r\n  For this purpose the “Nixon Pump” is the most effective among the\r\n  many that I have ever tested. The application should be made upon\r\n  the first appearance of the worms; any delay resulting often in\r\n  entire loss of crop, since nothing but flowage will kill the larger\r\n  worms. Another and more convenient solution is obtained from Hill’s\r\n  Extract of Tobacco--two or three quarts to a barrel of water. This\r\n  requires no heating, and may be prepared at a moment’s notice. My\r\n  sales last year of this Extract amounted to over eight hundred\r\n  gallons.\r\n\r\n                         Respectfully yours,\r\n                                                    FRANKLIN CROCKER.",
