It has ever excited admiration, and obtained a\r\nprominent situation in the cabinet; and so great are the facilities\r\nafforded at the present day to procure specimens and obtain a knowledge\r\nof this science, that it has become one of the requisites of a finished\r\neducation. Shells are found in all parts of the world, both on land and\r\nin water; but the most beautiful and valuable species are found between\r\nthe tropics.\r\n\r\nAt first they were regarded as pleasing curiosities, and prized only on\r\nthat account; but the investigations of scientific men have proved that\r\nthe study of this science is not only interesting, but useful. Much\r\nvaluable information has already been obtained, and, from the\r\ninvestigations of modern naturalists, much more may be anticipated.\r\n\r\nSo intimate is the connexion between Conchology and Geology, that a\r\nknowledge of the one is indispensable to the study and acquirement of\r\nthe other. The geologist will draw much advantage from a close study of\r\nthe testaceous covering of molluscous animals to aid him in determining\r\nthe identity or the superposition of the different strata of the earth\r\nand the extraordinary changes it has undergone; for, as Bergman\r\nelegantly says, “fossil shells, coral, and wood are the only three\r\nremaining medals of Creation.” He will see in the innumerable quantity\r\nof these animals, succeeding each other from generation to generation in\r\nthe depth of the seas, one of the evident causes of the growth and\r\nincrease of islands and continents.\r\n\r\nBut man may find in the knowledge of Mollusca applications still more\r\ndirect to his well being in society, both as to the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages to be derived from them: thus a great number of species\r\nare proper for food, as oysters, mussels, &c., which are objects of\r\ncommercial speculations. The Pinna furnishes the Italians with materials\r\nfor a rich dress, and the pearl, so much prized by the Orientals, by\r\nprinces, and particularly by the ladies, as a modest and beautiful\r\nornament, is produced by a disease of the animals in certain species of\r\nshells. It was this knowledge which made the celebrated Linnæus imagine\r\nthat it was possible to form an artificial pearlery in the rivers of\r\nSweden. The mother of pearl, so much employed as an ornament in articles\r\nof luxury, is only the interior lining of certain univalve or bivalve\r\nshells. Painting draws from some of these animals many colours, valuable\r\nnot so much for their beauty as their usefulness, as Chinese ink and\r\nsepia.\r\n\r\nThe brightest and richest colour known by the ancients, and used by them\r\nfor the celebrated Tyrian purple dye, is produced by animals at this\r\ntime known by the name of Purpura.\r\n\r\nThe Teredo attacks the wood of our vessels, and often does much injury;\r\ntherefore the knowledge of its manners, habits, and customs must be of\r\ngreat importance in countries infested with them, so as to be able to\r\nprovide a remedy against them. Snails and slugs are also enemies much to\r\nbe dreaded in our gardens.\r\n\r\nLamarck, in his last work, the result of the successive and continual\r\nlabours of his whole life and those of his contemporaries, has rendered\r\na very great service to science, but especially to conchology, by\r\ndescribing, or, at least, characterizing the numerous species of shells\r\nin his own splendid cabinet. It may be proper here to remark, that a\r\npart of Lamarck’s cabinet is now in the possession of Isaac Lea, Esq.,\r\nof Philadelphia, to whom we are much indebted for valuable assistance.\r\nTo Dr. Comstock, and the Rev. W. Turner, of Hartford, Conn., we are much\r\nindebted for kind favours; their aid has greatly facilitated our\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nIn this Manual of Conchology we have endeavoured to give a free\r\ntranslation of Lamarck’s system, as simplified by De Blainville; and, in\r\norder to facilitate as much as possible the study of this beautiful and\r\ninteresting science, we have divested it of numerous technicalities, and\r\ndivided it into four classes: Annelides, Cirrhipedes, Conchifera, and\r\nMollusca.\r\n\r\nTo each class we have assigned its various families, to each family its\r\ngenera, and to each genus its living species; thereby making it plain\r\nand within the reach of the meanest capacity. A type of almost every\r\ngenus is given, excepting only those shells which, from their similarity\r\nto other genera, may easily be classed.\r\n\r\nIt was deemed advisable, as this is intended for an easy introduction to\r\nthe science, to omit many divisions and subdivisions, which would only\r\nserve to perplex and render the attainment more difficult.\r\n\r\nAs the Naiades, or shells of this country, are given in several valuable\r\nscientific works lately published, we have only slightly touched them in\r\nthe place they are intended to occupy.\r\n\r\nWe cannot expect that the work now presented to the public is free from\r\nimperfections; but we ask for their lenity and kind forbearance to\r\nexcuse whatever defects there may be in our humble attempts to advance\r\nthe cause of science. Conchology, like other departments of natural\r\nhistory, is progressing; and that which is given to-day is almost always\r\nsusceptible of being modified to-morrow; should this work be well\r\nreceived, it is our intention to give, as soon as practicable, an\r\nenlarged work, containing even the minute microscopic shells and the\r\nfossils, with plates containing types of as many species of the genera\r\nas can possibly be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe plates were drawn and coloured with great care and accuracy from the\r\nnatural shells in our own cabinet, under the superintendence of Mr.\r\nJames Ackerman, artist.\r\n\r\n                                                                   T.

Twenty-six species.\r\n\r\nThe name of this genus is derived from the Latin word serpo, to creep,\r\non account of the vermiform character of some of its species.\r\n\r\nThey are invariably tubular, sometimes solitary, but more frequently in\r\nclusters spirally entwined, adhering to marine substances. In colour\r\nthey are brown, purple, yellow, tawny, pink or white, and sometimes\r\ntinged with green.\r\n\r\nTube solid, calcareous, irregularly twisted, fixed to other substances.\r\n\r\n                         Serpula vermicularis.\r\n                         S. fascicularis.\r\n                         S. intestinum.\r\n                         S. contortuplicata.\r\n                         S. plicaria.\r\n                         S. glomerata.\r\n                         S. decussata.\r\n                         S. protensa.\r\n                         S. infundibulum.\r\n                         S. annulata.\r\n                         S. cereolus.\r\n                         S. filograna.\r\n                         S. vermicella.\r\n                         S. filaria.\r\n                         S. pellucida.\r\n                         S. intorta.\r\n                         S. cristata.\r\n                         S. spirulæa.\r\n                         S. quadrangularis.\r\n                         S. minima.\r\n                         S. echinata.\r\n                         S. sulcata.\r\n                         S. costalis.\r\n                         S. dentifera.\r\n                         S. sipho.\r\n                         S. arenaria.\r\n\r\n_S. vermicularis._ The wormlike Serpula.\r\n\r\nWhite, cylindrical, tapering, rugged, variously curved and twisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      3. Vermilia. Eight species.\r\n\r\nTube testaceous, cylindrical, more or less twisted, gradually attenuated\r\nposteriorly; opening round, the margin with one, two, or three teeth;\r\nshell adhering by the side to other substances; provided with a convex\r\noperculum.\r\n\r\n                           Vermilia rostrata.\r\n                           V. triquetra.\r\n                           V. bicarinata.\r\n                           V. eruca.\r\n                           V. subcrenata.\r\n                           V. plicifera.\r\n                           V. scabra.\r\n                           V. tæniata.\r\n\r\n_V. triquetra._ The three-sided Vermilia.\r\n\r\nWhite or reddish, rugged, twisted and triangular, carinated along the\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      4. Galeolaria. Two species.\r\n\r\nDistinguished from the Vermilia by a very peculiar operculum. Found in\r\ngroups, adhering together at the base.\r\n\r\nTube open at the summit; aperture orbicular, terminated on the side by a\r\nspatulous tongue; operculum orbicular, squamose, consisting of from five\r\nto nine testaceous parts or valves, all attached to one side of the\r\noperculum; the middle one dentated at the truncated part of its summit,\r\nthe others a little toothed on their internal edge.\r\n\r\n                         Galeolaria cæspitosa.\r\n                         Galeolaria elongata.\r\n\r\n_G. elongata._ The elongated Galeolaria.\r\n\r\nWhitish, existing in congregated masses; operculum as above.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        5. Magilus. One species.\r\n\r\nA very singular shell, greatly resembling a petrified body, composed of\r\na testaceous white substance like alabaster. The base is bent into a\r\nshort spire, with about four contiguous whorls; the last prolonged and\r\nnearly straight. The animal, as it increases in size, abandons the\r\nspiral part by increasing the tubular part, filling up the part it quits\r\nwith calcareous matter, which proves that it advances gradually.\r\n\r\nTube partially involuted, convex in its upper exterior part, the lower\r\nside flattened, platted, carinated, and somewhat angular; the spire\r\nshort, helix-formed, and prolonged through the rest of its extent in\r\nnearly a right line; aperture entire, oval, with a sort of sinus or\r\ngutter in the middle line, producing the keel of the shell.\r\n\r\n_M. antiquus._ The antiquated Magilus.\r\n\r\nAnswers to the above description; colour pale yellowish brown,\r\ntransversely wrinkled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CLASS II.\r\n                              CIRRHIPEDES.\r\n                          HAS BUT ONE FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CIRRHIPEDES. Ten genera.\r\n\r\nLamarck divided the Lepas of Linnæus into the various genera which\r\ncompose this family. The term lepas is derived from the Greek word\r\nλεπας, a rock, alluding to its custom of adhering to rocks and marine\r\nbodies. The shell often varies in shape, covering, and colouring; it is\r\ngenerally conical, but sometimes hemispherical; some of the valves are\r\nplaced perpendicularly on a base, broad at the lower margin and tapering\r\ntowards the summit, which is closed by small horizontal valves forming\r\nthe operculum. The number of valves is indefinite, from four to\r\ntwenty-four; but all are diversified with striæ, ridges, and grooves.\r\nThe striæ are mostly transverse, and the ridges longitudinal.\r\n\r\nThe valves which compose the operculum or lid vary in shape, and are in\r\nnumber two, three, four, or more; they are generally attached to a\r\nligament.\r\n\r\nThey are seldom, if ever, found detached, but adhere in groups to rocks,\r\nshells, anchors, marine animals, &c. Those that fix themselves to ships\r\nare generally called barnacles; they rapidly increase in size and\r\nnumber, do great damage, and greatly impede the progress of the vessel.\r\nSome of this family are affixed at the base of the shell to other\r\nsubstances, and are therefore called sessile; others are attached to a\r\nfleshy peduncle or stem, and are said to be pedunculated. The peduncle\r\nor stem, proceeding from the base of the shell to the substance which\r\nsustains it, is sometimes smooth, fine in texture, and tinged with\r\nbright red or orange; sometimes it is of a dark or brownish colour, with\r\na texture much coarser and granulated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      1. Tubicinella. One species.\r\n\r\nHas the form of a cylindrical tube, slightly curved, and open at both\r\nends; one extremity closed by four trapezoidal valves attached to the\r\ninner margin, the other end closed by a membrane. The annular ribs which\r\nseparate the compartments show its progressive growth. Found buried so\r\ndeeply in the fat of marine animals, particularly whales, that only the\r\noperculum and the upper part of the tube are visible. Shell rather\r\nelevated, sub-cylindrical, the partitions rather small and indented; the\r\nspaces or compartments almost quadrilateral; the inferior much more\r\nnarrow than the others; the apertures equal and circular; the membrane\r\nwhich closes the superior forming a tube between the four almost equal\r\nvalves of the operculum.\r\n\r\n_T. balænarum._ The Whale Tubicinella.\r\n\r\nTubular, with transverse ribs, and a ring-shaped margin; operculum\r\nbottle-shaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      2. Coronula. Three species.\r\n\r\nFound imbedded in the skin of whales and other marine animals, though\r\nnot generally at so great a depth as the Tubicinella. Shell in form a\r\nlittle variable and without trace of support; the coronary part formed\r\nof six pieces, as in those properly called _Balanus_, but more regularly\r\ndisposed in a manner to imitate a kind of crown or tube; spaces\r\nalternately hollowed and saliant; operculum not articulated, composed of\r\ntwo pairs of small, level, delicate valves, joined at the aperture of\r\nthe tube by a considerable membranous part, leaving a passage for the\r\ncirrhous appendages of the animal.\r\n\r\n                         Coronula testudinaria.\r\n                         C. balænarum.\r\n                         C. diadema.\r\n                         C. quinquevalvis.\r\n\r\n_C. testudinaria._ The Tortoise Coronula.\r\n\r\nVery depressed, circular, as if radiated by the disposition of marked\r\nspaces, striated transversely, forming six rays diverging from the\r\ncentre to the circumference; aperture oval and hexagonal.\r\n\r\n_C. balænarum._ The Whale Coronula.\r\n\r\nA little more elevated; the spaces prominent, equal between them, much\r\nlarger than the excavated; the aperture subcircular; the operculum of\r\nfour valves, almost equal, occupying but a small space of the membranous\r\npart which forms between them a sort of tube.\r\n\r\n_C. diadema._ The Crown Coronula.\r\n\r\nMore elevated, sub-hexagonal; the spaces almost equal, the hollow parts\r\nlarger than the saliant; the superior aperture very large and hexagonal;\r\nthe inferior much smaller, of the same form, and communicating in a\r\nround excavation by radiated plates; the operculum bivalve.\r\n\r\n_C. quinquevalvis._ The five-valved Coronula. Pl. 4, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nSpecies irregular, having only five valves, of a purple hue.\r\n\r\n\r\n           3. Balanus. The Acorn Shell. Twenty-eight species.\r\n\r\nSo named from its resemblance to an acorn. Shell conical; the coronary\r\npart formed of six very distinct valves, one dorsal, one ventral, and\r\ntwo pairs of laterals, with or without a calcareous support; operculum\r\nof four articulated pieces, forming a sort of pyramid in the superior\r\naperture of the tube.\r\n\r\n                           Balanus angulosus.\r\n                           B. sulcatus.\r\n                           B. tintinnabulum.\r\n                           B. nigrescens.\r\n                           B. cylindraceus.\r\n                           B. calycularis.\r\n                           B. roseus.\r\n                           B. palmatus.\r\n                           B. stalactiferus.\r\n                           B. plicatus.\r\n                           B. duploconus.\r\n                           B. patellaris.\r\n                           B. semiplicatus.\r\n                           B. galeatus.\r\n                           B. ovularis.\r\n                           B. miser.\r\n                           B. amphimorphus.\r\n                           B. perforatus.\r\n                           B. lævis.\r\n                           B. spinosus.\r\n                           B. radiatus.\r\n                           B. subimbricatus.\r\n                           B. rugosus.\r\n                           B. placianus.\r\n                           B. crispatus.\r\n                           B. punctatus.\r\n                           B. fistulosus.\r\n                           B. latus.\r\n\r\n_B. sulcatus._ The furrowed Balanus.\r\n\r\nWhite; valves nearly smooth; operculum strongly ridged transversely,\r\nwith longitudinal, nearly obsolete striæ.\r\n\r\n_B. tintinnabulum._ The little Bell Balanus.

Six genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n         1. Aspergillum. The Watering-pot Shell. Four species.\r\n\r\nA well-known but rare shell; the larger end closed by a convex disk,\r\nwith numerous small perforations, and encircled by a dilated margin of\r\nelegant papyraceous tubes, resembling a beautifully plaited ruff; the\r\nsmaller end open. Found in sandy places at low water.\r\n\r\nShell oval, slightly elongated, striated longitudinally,\r\nsub-equilateral; adhering, more or less confounded with the coats of a\r\nrather thick calcareous tube, conic, club-shaped, open at its attenuated\r\nextremity, and terminated at the other by a convex disk pierced by a\r\ngreat number of sub-tubular, rounded holes, and by a fissure in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n                          Aspergillum Javanum.\r\n                          A. vaginiferum.\r\n                          A. Novæ Zeylandiæ.\r\n                          A. agglutinans.\r\n\r\n_A. Javanum._ The Java Aspergillum. Pl. 33, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nSpecies smooth, in which the circumference of the disk is bordered with\r\na waved testaceous fringe.\r\n\r\n_A. Novæ Zeylandiæ._ The New-Zealand Aspergillum.\r\n\r\nSpecies in which the circumference of the disk is without a fringe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      2. Clavagella. One species.\r\n\r\nAn irregular tube, with branches or projecting tubes at the closed end;\r\nwithin it is one free or moveable valve, united by a ligament to\r\nanother, which is blended with the tube; this distinguishes it from the\r\nAspergillum. Found in sand and coral.\r\n\r\nShell oval, very slightly elongated, striated longitudinally, slightly\r\nirregular; equivalve, inequilateral; hinge a little variable; ligament\r\nexterior; two well-marked distant muscular impressions; a calcareous\r\nsub-cylindrical tube, more or less completely surrounding the shell, and\r\nterminated before by a single orifice.\r\n\r\n_C. aperta._ The open Clavagella.\r\n\r\nTube erect, adhering; aperture waved, entire, expanding, funnel-shaped,\r\nleaving the two valves open or uncovered in all their anterior part;\r\nwith an ovate face valve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      3. Fistulana. Four species.\r\n\r\nLamarck asserts that the tube and shell of this genus are quite\r\ndistinct. It so greatly resembles the Teredo that it is with difficulty\r\ndistinguished. It is found in sand, wood, stone, and sometimes shells.\r\n\r\nShell annular or very short, not sharp nor angular anteriorly, but in\r\nother respects much like that of the Teredo.\r\n\r\nTube generally shorter, thicker, more solid, more club-shaped than that\r\nof the Teredo, always closed at its anterior extremity in such a manner\r\nas to contain and entirely hide the shell; the posterior extremity open,\r\nand divided interiorly into two syphons by a partition.\r\n\r\n                            Fistulana clava.\r\n                            F. corniformis.\r\n                            F. gregata.\r\n                            F. lagenula.\r\n\r\n_F. corniformis._ The horn-shaped Fistulana.\r\n\r\nAnswers to the above description.\r\n\r\n_F. gregata._ The gregarious Fistulana.\r\n\r\nSheath or tube doubly club-shaped, congregating; shell angularly\r\narcuated, with double angulated serrated wings.\r\n\r\n_F. Clava._ The Club Fistulana. Pl. 33, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nSpecies with one end clavate, the other incurved, narrower, obtuse, and\r\nperforated in the middle; shell generally flexuous, of a brownish\r\ncolour; exterior rough, interior smooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       4. Septaria. One species.\r\n\r\nThe tube of this genus unquestionably contains a bivalve shell; but, as\r\nno perfect specimen has yet been found, nothing decisive is known\r\nrespecting it.\r\n\r\nTube calcareous, thick, conically elongated, more or less flexuous, as\r\nif composed of pieces placed on the ends of each other, or as if\r\narticulated, with a ring or projection more or less marked at the place\r\nof the joints, but without traces of partitions; terminated on one side\r\nby an inflation, oftentimes with some interior partitions, and on the\r\nother by two tubes, distinct and sub-articulated.\r\n\r\n_S. arenaria._ The Sand Septaria.\r\n\r\nThe type of this genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    5. Teredina. Two fossil species.\r\n\r\nA genus without a living species, given here to preserve the family\r\nentire, having a shell thick, oval, short, very gaping posteriorly,\r\nequivalve, inequilateral; summits well marked; a spoonlike cavity in\r\neach valve.\r\n\r\nTube or sheath testaceous, cylindrical; anterior end open; posterior end\r\nclosed, but exhibiting the two valves of the shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n                6. Teredo. The Ship Worm. Three species.\r\n\r\nThis genus derived its name from the faculty it possesses of boring\r\nwood. The T. navalis can penetrate the stoutest oaken planks of a ship’s\r\nsides by means of two valves affixed to the head of the animal. The\r\neffects produced would be much more destructive but from the fact of\r\ntheir generally perforating the wood in the direction of the grain. Sir\r\nE. Home wrote a very scientific and interesting description of a species\r\nnot mentioned by Lamarck, called the T. gigantea, found imbedded in\r\nindurated mud in the Island of Sumatra. It is the largest species known,\r\nsome having been seen four or five feet long.\r\n\r\nShell thick, solid, very short or annular, open at both extremities;\r\nequivalve, equilateral, angular and sharp anteriorly, only slightly\r\ntouching by the opposite edges; hinge obsolete; a considerable internal\r\nspoonlike cavity; one slightly sensible muscular impression.\r\n\r\nTube more or less distinct from the substance in which the animal lives,\r\ncylindrical, straight or flexuous, closed with age at the oral extremity\r\nso as to envelop the animal and its shell; always open at the other end,\r\nand divided interiorly into two syphons by a middle partition.\r\n\r\n                            Teredo navalis.\r\n                            T. palmulata.\r\n                            T. gigantea.\r\n\r\n_T. navalis._ The common Ship Worm.\r\n\r\nSpecies very thin, cylindrical, and smooth; slightly twisted, white,\r\nfinely striated longitudinally.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY II.\r\n                        PHOLADARIA. Two genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n              1. Pholas. The Stone Piercer. Nine species.\r\n\r\nThis genus is without any tubular sheath; it derives its name from the\r\nGreek word φωλεω, to hide, alluding to the custom of its inhabitant in\r\nforming cells in rocks, wood, &c.\r\n\r\nIn form the Pholas is generally oblong, having two large valves opposite\r\nto each other, with a number of smaller ones attached to the back as a\r\nsubstitute for a hinge. The two large valves never shut close; they are\r\nopen at one end, and sometimes at both.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the shell is usually of a pure or dusky white, but\r\nsometimes of a brownish cast. In some species the shell is adorned with\r\nbeautiful delicate reticulations, like the finest lace; in others the\r\ntexture is coarser, like small basket-work. They are found in the\r\nAmerican, Indian, and European seas, each shell in a separate habitation\r\nformed in limestone, sandstone, wood, coral, &c.; often discovered\r\ncompletely imbedded in the oak planks of ships traversing those seas; as\r\nthey advance in growth they enlarge the space within, and leave the\r\naperture by which they entered of its primitive size.\r\n\r\nShell thin, sub-transparent, finely striated, elongated oval, bivalve,\r\nequivalve, inequilateral; the valves only touching in the middle of\r\ntheir edges; the summits but little marked, and concealed by a callosity\r\nproduced by the expansion of the dorsal lobes of the mantle; near the\r\nhinge are often developed one or more accessory calcareous pieces; an\r\nincurved tooth interior beneath the hinge.\r\n\r\n                            Pholas dactylus.\r\n                            P. orientalis.\r\n                            P. candida.\r\n                            P. dactyloides.\r\n                            P. silicula.\r\n                            P. costata.\r\n                            P. crispata.\r\n                            P. callosa.\r\n                            P. clavata.\r\n\r\n_P. dactylus._ The prickly Pholas. Pl. 3, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nAnswers to the general description, but is beset with small calcareous\r\nspiny nodules on the ribs, which run widening and enlarging from the\r\nsummit to the margin; colour white or very light brown.\r\n\r\n_P. striata._ The striated Pholas. Pl. 3, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nOval, the dorsal callosity leaving the summit free, and extending\r\ntowards the anterior and inferior extremity in such a manner that each\r\nvalve seems to be formed of three parts, because of an oblique furrow\r\nfrom the summit to the margin; a tooth running down in the inside from\r\nthe summit; one pair of accessory pieces at the posterior extremity of\r\nthe shell.\r\n\r\n_P. candida._ The white Pholas. Pl. 3, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nElongated, wedge-shaped; muscular impression almost medial; a kind of\r\noblique tooth parting from the summit; no accessory pieces.\r\n\r\n_P. costata._ The ribbed Pholas. Pl. 3, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nElongated, wedge-shaped, covered with regular elevated jagged or\r\nscalloped ribs, elegantly disposed; three dorsal accessory pieces;\r\nmuscular impression almost medial.\r\n\r\n_P. crispata._ The curled Pholas.\r\n\r\nSomewhat oval, truncated behind, and as if divided into two parts by an\r\noblique furrow from the summit to the base; anterior part reticulated,\r\nthe other parts plain; muscular impression marginal.\r\n\r\n_P. clavata._ The clubbed Pholas.\r\n\r\nShort, wedge-form, little gaping, with many accessory pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     2. Gastrochæna. Three species.\r\n\r\nAlways without accessory pieces, and, therefore, easily distinguished\r\nfrom the Pholas.\r\n\r\nShell equivalve, somewhat wedge-shaped, with a very large, oval,\r\noblique, anterior opening between the valves; the posterior extremity\r\nnearly close; hinge linear, marginal, without teeth; two distant\r\nmuscular impressions; sometimes with a kind of tube or calcareous\r\ngeneral envelope.\r\n\r\n                        Gastrochæna cuneiformis.\r\n                        G. mytiloides.\r\n                        G. modiolina.\r\n\r\n_G. modiolina._ The Modioliform Gastrochæna.\r\n\r\nOval, thin, brittle, gaping at the side; light reddish brown, with a\r\nbluish white interior.\r\n\r\n_G. cuneiformis._ The wedgelike Gastrochæna. Pl. 3, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nSpecies with a smooth shell, and without distinct tube. (Represented as\r\nimbedded in wood.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FAMILY III.\r\n                        SOLENIDES. Four genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      1. Solen. Eighteen species.\r\n\r\nThere are many species belonging to this genus differing considerably in\r\nform and appearance. Its name is derived from a Greek word signifying a\r\npipe or tube. It is a bivalve whose breadth sometimes exceeds its\r\nlength; some species have a resemblance to the sheath of a razor or a\r\nknife handle; others are curved like the scabbard of a cimeter.\r\n\r\nThe Solen is found in the sand of the seashore, which it sometimes\r\npenetrates to the depth of one or two feet. Most of the species are\r\ncovered with an epidermis, which renders their colours more or less\r\nobscure. In general they present but little beauty, though some are of a\r\nbright pink colour, and some are beautifully and delicately radiated\r\nwith purple and white.\r\n\r\nThe principal characteristic of this genus is the hinge, which generally\r\nhas one subulate tooth, though sometimes two or three.\r\n\r\nShell equivalve, extremely inequilateral, transversely elongated, open\r\nat both ends; the apices very small, and entirely at the commencement of\r\nthe dorsal line; one or two teeth in the hinge; ligament external; two\r\ndistant muscular impressions; the anterior one very long and narrow, the\r\nposterior one sub-angular.\r\n\r\n                            Solen vagina\r\n                            S. corneus.\r\n                            S. ensis.\r\n                            S. pygmæus.\r\n                            S. ambiguus.\r\n                            S.

Panopæa. One species.\r\n\r\nDistinguished from the Mya by the prominency of the apex and the\r\nsituation of the ligament.\r\n\r\nShell regular, elongated oval, gaping at the two extremities, equivalve,\r\ninequilateral; summit but little marked, and anterodorsal; hinge very\r\ncomplete, similar, formed by a conical primary tooth before a short,\r\ncompressed, ascending callosity; ligament exterior, attached to the\r\ncallosity; two muscular impressions.\r\n\r\n_P. Aldrovandi._ The Panopæa of Aldrovandus. Pl. 5, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe type of this genus, transversely elongated, undulated;\r\nconcentrically wrinkled; of dark green colour, almost black.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     3. Solecurtus. Three species.\r\n\r\nShell oval, elongated, equivalve, sub-equilateral, edges almost straight\r\nand parallel; the extremities equally rounded, and as if truncated;\r\nsummits but little marked; hinge toothless, or formed by some\r\nrudimentary primary teeth; ligament projecting, affixed to the thick\r\nnymphal callosities; two distant, rounded muscular impressions.\r\n\r\n                          Solecurtus radiatus.\r\n                          S. strigilatus.\r\n                          S. legumen.\r\n\r\n_S. radiatus._ The radiated Solecurtus.\r\n\r\nSpecies flat, small, with an interior ridge running down obliquely from\r\nthe summit to the abdominal margin.\r\n\r\n_S. strigilatus._ The strigilated Solecurtus.\r\n\r\nSpecies more cylindrical, without interior ridge.\r\n\r\n_S. legumen._ The Pease-pod Solecurtus.

Two species.\r\n\r\nDistinguished from the Solen by being without teeth at the hinge.\r\n\r\nShell covered with epidermis, slightly irregular, elongated, gaping at\r\nthe two extremities, equivalve, inequilateral; the summits but little\r\nmarked; hinge toothless; a longitudinal callosity; ligament exterior,\r\naffixed to very projecting callosities on the shortest side of the\r\nshell; two distinct muscular impressions.\r\n\r\n                        Glycimeris margaritacea.\r\n                        Glycimeris siliqua.\r\n\r\n_G. siliqua._ The podlike Glycimeris.\r\n\r\nTransversely oblong, covered with a black epidermis; umbones\r\ndecorticated; internal disc of the valves white, thick, and callous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY IV.\r\n                          MYARIA. Two genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n           1. Mya. The Trough Shell, or Gaper. Four species.\r\n\r\nThis term is derived from the Greek word μυω, to close, alluding to the\r\nanimal’s custom of closing the valves. The principal characteristic of\r\nthe Mya is its gaping at one end; it is likewise distinguished by having\r\na large spoonlike tooth proceeding from beneath the beak. Its form is\r\ngreatly varied, but generally covered with a greenish epidermis, which\r\nmay be removed; and the shell, when polished, will display beautiful\r\nprismatic colours. The Mya is found on the seashore or on the banks of\r\nlarge rivers, partially concealed in the sand and mud.\r\n\r\nShell transverse, inequilateral, surrounded with a thick epidermis;\r\nrather solid; edges thin and sharp; summits but little marked; hinge\r\ndissimilar; one or two large, compressed, spoon-shaped teeth rising\r\nperpendicularly from the plane of the left valve, and fitting into the\r\nentrance of a primary cavity in the right valve; ligament interior,\r\nattaching the tooth and cavity; two distant muscular impressions; the\r\nanterior long and narrow, the posterior rounded; the mantle impression\r\nnarrow, with a large sinus or hollow.\r\n\r\n                            Mya truncata.\r\n                            M. arenaria.\r\n                            M. erodona.\r\n                            M. solenimyalis.\r\n\r\n_M. arenaria._ The Sand Mya.

Pl. 5, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nSub-oval, truncated; small end gaping; large end rounded; covered with a\r\ndark yellowish epidermis; inside white; wrinkled transversely.\r\n\r\n\r\n               2. Anatina. The Duck’s Bill. Ten species.\r\n\r\nShell elongated oval, very thin, fragile, semipellucid; much inflated at\r\none end like a duck’s bill, whence it derives its common name;\r\nequivalve, very inequilateral; hinge toothless; the anterior side\r\nrounded and much longer than the posterior; ligament interior affixed to\r\na bony spoonlike process in each valve, and sustained by a lateral plate\r\nrunning obliquely into the interior of the shell.\r\n\r\n                            Anatina laterna.\r\n                            A. truncata.\r\n                            A. subrostrata.\r\n                            A. longirostris.\r\n                            A. globulosa.\r\n                            A. trapezoides.\r\n                            A. rugosa.\r\n                            A. imperfecta.\r\n                            A. myalis.\r\n                            A. rupicola.\r\n\r\n_A. subrostrata._ The beaklike Anatina.\r\n\r\nSpecies equivalve and regular.\r\n\r\n_A. myalis._ The Mya-like Anatina.\r\n\r\nSpecies inequivalve.\r\n\r\n_A. trapezoides._ The trapezium-shaped Anatina. Pl. 12, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nSpecies with a moveable tooth or calcareous piece upon the right valve,\r\nlodged in the angle formed by the spoonlike process.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY V.\r\n                        MACTRACEA. Seven genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      1. Lutraria. Eleven species.\r\n\r\nThis genus was taken from the Mactra, and is perfectly distinct, as it\r\nwants the lateral teeth. It is called Lutricola by De Blainville, from\r\nits lurking in sand or mud at the mouths of large rivers.\r\n\r\nShell inequilateral, orbicular, sub-triangular or transversely oval,\r\ngaping at the extremities; hinge with one cardinal tooth folded in two,\r\nor two teeth, one of which is plain, with an opposite hollow to receive\r\nit; no lateral teeth; ligament interior and fixed in the hollow cavity\r\nof the primary tooth.\r\n\r\n                          Lutraria solenoides.\r\n                          L. rugosa.\r\n                          L. compressa.\r\n                          L. piperata.\r\n                          L. tellinoides.\r\n                          L. elliptica.\r\n                          L. papyracea.\r\n                          L. plicatella.\r\n                          L. crassiplica.\r\n                          L. complanata.\r\n                          L. candida.\r\n\r\n_L. solenoides._ The Solen-like Lutraria.\r\n\r\nSpecies oblong, sub-cylindrical, very gaping, two very strong cardinal\r\nteeth; the spoonlike cavity of the ligament vertical.\r\n\r\n_L. compressa._ The compressed Lutraria.\r\n\r\nSpecies oval or orbicular, almost equilateral, very compressed, little\r\ngaping; hinge similar; internal ligament inserted in the pit of a\r\nvertical spoonlike cavity; two distinct tubes, without longitudinal\r\nstriæ.\r\n\r\n_L. rugosa._ The rugged Lutraria.\r\n\r\nSpecies ovate, closed at both ends; striæ from the summit to the base.\r\n\r\n_L. elliptica._ The oval Lutraria.\r\n\r\nOblong oval, nearly smooth, having a few concentric striæ, and some\r\ndiagonal striæ at the ends of the valves; colour yellow or greenish\r\nbrown; inside white.\r\n\r\n\r\n         2. Mactra. The Kneading-trough. Thirty-three species.\r\n\r\nThe name given to this genus was derived from the Greek word μακτρα,\r\nfrom its resemblance to a trough used for kneading bread.\r\n\r\nIn all species of this genus a similarity of colouring and form pervades\r\nthe whole. In shape they are sub-triangular or oblong, with a smooth,\r\nstriated, or transversely-ribbed exterior. In some species the valves\r\ngape at both ends, and in others at the anterior only. The most general\r\ncolour is lilac, or white tinged with blue or yellow; some have purple\r\nrays on a brown ground.\r\n\r\nA singularity in the form of the hinge of the Mactra distinguishes it\r\nfrom all other genera. It is of a triangular form, has a bent or angular\r\ncompressed tooth on each valve, with a small oblique cavity on each side\r\nto which the ligament is attached. There are also two lateral teeth, one\r\nnear the ligament and the other near the primary tooth. These teeth are\r\nthin and fragile; the primary tooth is sometimes indistinct, but the\r\nlateral teeth always exist.\r\n\r\nThe Mactra is found buried in the sand at a little distance from the\r\nseashore. Shell generally thin and brittle, covered with epidermis, of a\r\ntriangular form, transverse, equivalve, inequilateral; beaks prominent;\r\none compressed, folded, cardinal tooth, with an adjoining pit in each\r\nvalve, projecting inward; lateral teeth thin, lamellous, entering,\r\nplaced near the hinge; exterior ligament small; an interior ligament\r\ninserted in the cardinal pits; two muscular impressions, united by a\r\nnarrow marginal tongue.\r\n\r\n                            Mactra gigantea.\r\n                            M. Spengleri.\r\n                            M. striatella.\r\n                            M. carinata.\r\n                            M. straminea.\r\n                            M. Australis.\r\n                            M. violacea.\r\n                            M. fasciata.\r\n                            M. turgida.\r\n                            M. plicataria.\r\n                            M. rufescens.\r\n                            M. maculata.\r\n                            M. subplicata.\r\n                            M. triangularis.\r\n                            M. lactea.\r\n                            M. abbreviata.\r\n                            M. Helvacea.\r\n                            M. grandis.\r\n                            M. stultorum.\r\n                            M. maculosa.\r\n                            M. ovalina.\r\n                            M. alba.\r\n                            M. solida.\r\n                            M. castanea.\r\n                            M. rufa.\r\n                            M. squalida.\r\n                            M. Brasiliana.\r\n                            M. donacina.\r\n                            M. depressa.\r\n                            M. lilacea.\r\n                            M. trigonella.\r\n                            M. deltoides.\r\n                            M. crassatella.\r\n\r\n_M. gigantea._ The gigantic Mactra.\r\n\r\nSpecies in which the cardinal teeth are almost obsolete, in consequence\r\nof the enlargement of the pit of the ligament.\r\n\r\n_M. stultorum._ The fool’s Mactra. Pl. 9, fig. 6.\r\n\r\nSpecies in which all the teeth are very large, lamellous, striated\r\nlongitudinally; colour reddish brown.\r\n\r\n_M. solida._ The solid Mactra.\r\n\r\nSpecies thick, solid, without epidermis; lateral teeth finely striated.\r\n\r\n_M. trigonella._ The three-cornered Mactra.\r\n\r\nSpecies in which the lateral teeth are almost obsolete; exterior surface\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\n_M. triangularis._ The triangular Mactra.\r\n\r\nSpecies very small, strong, opaque, white; inside white; margin strongly\r\ncrenated.\r\n\r\n_M. crassa._ The thick Mactra.\r\n\r\nSpecies very thick, solid, striated longitudinally; the cardinal teeth\r\nobsolete, or almost so; the lateral very thick, very close, and\r\nreflected; an external ligament as well as an internal one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    3. Crassatella. Eleven species.\r\n\r\nMay be easily known from the Mactra and Lutraria, as the valves, when\r\nclosed, fit exactly, and do not gape. It is remarkable that all the\r\nliving species contained in this genus only exist in the seas of\r\nAustralasia, while at least seven species in a fossil state are found in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nShell inequilateral, sub-orbicular, close, equivalve, sometimes\r\nattenuated at one end; two divergent primary teeth, with a cavity at the\r\nside; lateral teeth obsolete; ligament internal, inserted in the cavity\r\nof the hinge.\r\n\r\n                         Crassatella Kingicola.\r\n                         C. donacina.\r\n                         C. sulcata.\r\n                         C. subradiata.\r\n                         C. contraria.\r\n                         C. cuneata.\r\n                         C. rostrata.\r\n                         C. glabrata.\r\n                         C. erycinæa.\r\n                         C. cycladea.\r\n                         C. striata.\r\n\r\n_C. sulcata._ The furrowed Crassatella. Pl. 6, fig 4.\r\n\r\nShell ordinarily thick, striated transversely, denticulated,\r\nsub-triangular, equivalve, inequilateral, summits well marked and\r\nevidently turned forward; hinge very large, subsimilar, formed by two\r\ndiverging cardinal teeth, separated by a large pit; ligament almost\r\nentirely interior, and inserted in the pit.\r\n\r\n_C. Kingicola._ The King’s Island Crassatella.\r\n\r\nOvate, orbicular; yellowish white, with obsolete rays; very minutely\r\nstriated transversely; the umbones somewhat plicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        4. Erycina. One species.\r\n\r\nThe only living species of this genus is found on the sand in\r\nNew-Holland, but there are many fossils in France. It is so equivocal in\r\ncharacter that it is difficult to judge of their hinge.\r\n\r\n_E. cardioides._ The cardium-shaped Erycina. Pl. 6, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nShell rather longer than high, sub-triangular, regular, equivalve,\r\ninequilateral, rarely gaping; the summits well marked and a little\r\nanteriorly inclined; hinge subsimilar; two unequal cardinal teeth,\r\nconverging at the summit, and leaving a pit between them; two lateral\r\nteeth, not distant, lamellous, inserted; ligament interior, fixed in the\r\ncavity between the primary teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       5. Ungulina. Two species.\r\n\r\nThis genus is very remarkable for having the pit or cavity divided into\r\ntwo parts, the one at the end of the other; the ligament is partially\r\nseen from the outside.\r\n\r\n                          Ungulina oblonga.\r\n                          Ungulina transversa.\r\n\r\n_U. transversa._ The transverse Ungulina.\r\n\r\nShell vertical or longitudinal, rather irregular, not gaping, equivalve,\r\ninequilateral, with summits little marked and decorticated; hinge\r\ndorsal, formed by one short, primary cleft tooth, before an oblong pit,\r\ndivided by a small ligament, in which is inserted a sub-interior\r\nligament; colour yellowish brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       6. Solenimya. Two species.\r\n\r\nThis genus, which at first sight is confounded with the Solens, differs\r\nfrom them particularly by the singular disposition of the ligament\r\nplaced at the short side of the shell.\r\n\r\n                        Solenimya Australis.\r\n                        Solenimya Mediterranea.\r\n\r\n_S. Australis._ The Australian Solenimya. Pl. 6, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nShell covered with a thick brownish epidermis, regular, thick, elongated\r\noval, edges straight and parallel, equally rounded at both extremities;\r\nvalves equal, very inequilateral.\r\n\r\n_S. Mediterranea._ The Mediterranean Solenimya.\r\n\r\nTransversely oblong; dark brown, ribbed longitudinally, with imbricated\r\nprojecting foliations; inside white.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    7. Amphidesma. Sixteen species.\r\n\r\nThis genus was constituted by Lamarck on account of the peculiar\r\ncharacters which distinguished it from those genera which it most\r\nresembles; particularly in having the valves connected by two ligaments.\r\n\r\nShell generally small, transverse, sub-oval or rounded, occasionally a\r\nlittle gaping at the sides; hinge with one or two cardinal teeth, and a\r\nnarrow cavity for the interior ligament; exterior ligament short.\r\n\r\n                         Amphidesma variegata.\r\n                         A. donacilla.\r\n                         A. lactea.\r\n                         A. cornea.\r\n                         A. albella.\r\n                         A. flexuosa.\r\n                         A. prismatica.\r\n                         A. phaseolina.\r\n                         A. corbuloides.\r\n                         A. glabrella.\r\n                         A. lucinalis.\r\n                         A.

Two genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       1. Corbula. Nine species.\r\n\r\nThis genus approximates the Crassatella and Ungulina, but is\r\ndistinguished from them by the inequality of the valves and the strong\r\nprimary tooth.\r\n\r\nShell rather solid, a little irregular and triangular, inequivalve, more\r\nor less inequilateral, rounded and enlarged before, attenuated and\r\nprolonged behind; summits well marked, one projecting behind the other;\r\nhinge anomalous, formed by a large, conical, recurved cardinal tooth,\r\nwith a cavity at its base for the reception of the tooth of the other\r\nvalve; ligament very small; two muscular impressions little distant.\r\n\r\n                           Corbula Australis.\r\n                           C. sulcata.\r\n                           C. erythrodon.\r\n                           C. ovalina.\r\n                           C.

Three genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       1. Saxicava. Five species.\r\n\r\nThis genus is taken from the Mytilus, and, like the Pholas, possesses\r\nthe faculty of penetrating calcareous rocks, from which it cannot be\r\nextracted without breaking the substance in which it is imbedded.\r\n\r\nShell bivalve, thick, covered with epidermis, rather irregular,\r\nelongated, sub-cylindrical, obtuse at the two extremities; summits\r\nlittle marked; hinge toothless, or with a very small rudimentary tooth;\r\nligament external, a little inflated.\r\n\r\n                            Saxicava rugosa.\r\n                            S.

Venerirupis. Seven species.\r\n\r\nAnother lithophagous shell, taken from the genus Venus, from which it is\r\ndistinguished by the different disposition of the teeth, having three\r\nprimary in one of the valves at least.\r\n\r\nShell more or less irregular, sub-trigonal, striated or radiated,\r\nequivalve, inequilateral, the anterior side shorter and rounded, the\r\nposterior sub-truncated; summits well marked; hinge sub-regular, more or\r\nless dissimilar, formed by slender, narrow, cardinal teeth, variable in\r\nnumber on each valve, sometimes two on the right and three on the left,\r\nand sometimes three on both; these teeth are small, contiguous,\r\nparallel, and but little, if at all, divergent exterior; very weak.\r\n\r\n                         Venerirupis perforans.\r\n                         V. nucleus.\r\n                         V. irus.\r\n                         V. exotica.\r\n                         V. distans.\r\n                         V. crenata.\r\n                         V. carditoides.\r\n\r\n_V. perforans._ The perforating Venerirupis.\r\n\r\nSub-rhombic, transversely striated, wrinkled on the anterior side;\r\nexterior brown, interior white, sometimes tinged with purple.\r\n\r\n_V. irus._ The foliated Venerirupis.

Ten genera.\r\n\r\nThis family is divided into N. Solenaria and N. Tellinaria, from their\r\nresemblance to the Solen and the Tellina.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      N. SOLENARIA. Three genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    1. Sanguinolaria. Four species.\r\n\r\nThis genus may be distinguished from the Solen by never having the\r\ntransverse oblong shape, or the edge of the valves parallel to the base.\r\n\r\n                        Sanguinolaria occidens.\r\n                        S. rosea.\r\n                        S. livida.\r\n                        S. rugosa.\r\n\r\n_S. rosea._ The rosy Sanguinolaria.\r\n\r\nSemi-orbicular, smooth, shining and convex; near the umbones of a\r\nbeautiful rose colour, which becomes paler as it descends; acute\r\ntransverse striæ.\r\n\r\n_S. occidens._ The setting-sun Sanguinolaria. Pl. 7, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nOval, a little elongated, very compressed, slightly gaping, valves\r\nelliptical, equally rounded at the two extremities, without mark of\r\nposterior keel; summits slightly indicated; hinge formed by one or two\r\ncontiguous cardinal teeth on each valve; ligament projecting, convex;\r\nmargins not parallel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    2. Psammobia. Eighteen species.\r\n\r\nTaken from the Tellina, which it much resembles in form, but from which\r\nit differs by not having the irregular plait on the anterior part.\r\n\r\nShell ovate, transverse, slightly gaping; summits projecting; hinge\r\nformed by two teeth on one valve, and only one inserted on the other.\r\n\r\n                           Psammobia virgata.\r\n                           P.

Galathea.\r\n\r\n_P. virgata._ The striped Psammobia. Pl. 7, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nSpecies rather gaping, striated longitudinally, the teeth of the hinge\r\nconsiderably effaced.\r\n\r\n_P. Ferroensis._ The Ferro Psammobia.\r\n\r\nOblong oval; white, radiated with crimson; finely striated transversely;\r\nvalves obliquely truncated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      3. Psammotæa. Seven species.\r\n\r\nOf the same form as the Psammobia, but differing in the number of teeth,\r\nas the left valve of the Psammotæa has only one tooth; sometimes one\r\nvalve is toothless, while the other has two teeth.\r\n\r\nShell transverse oval or oblong; gaping a little at the sides; one\r\nprimary tooth on each valve, though sometimes on only one of them;\r\nligament exterior, attached to callosities at the hinge, and without an\r\nirregular plait.\r\n\r\n                          Psammotæa violacea.\r\n                          P. zonalis.\r\n                          P. pellucida.\r\n                          P. serotina.\r\n                          P. candida.\r\n                          P. Tarentina.\r\n                          P. donacina.\r\n\r\n_P. violacea._ The violet Psammotæa. Pl. 7, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nTransversely ovate-oblong, sub-ventricose; transversely striated; purple\r\nradiations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TELLINARIA. Seven genera.\r\n\r\nThe first five of these genera have one or two lateral teeth, the\r\nremaining two have none.\r\n\r\n\r\n              4. Tellina. The Tellen. Fifty-four species.\r\n\r\nThis genus differs but little from the Donax; its species are numerous,\r\nespecially in the seas of hot countries; they are found sunk deep in the\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nThere are but few genera that can vie with the Tellina in beauty,\r\nvariety, or number; some are smooth and polished, some are remarkable\r\nfor their beautiful radiations, and others are covered with minute striæ\r\nand undulations; occasionally the whole surface is covered with\r\nimbrications or scales.\r\n\r\nThey are produced abundantly in almost every sea and in many rivers, but\r\nthe finest species are found in the pearl-fisheries of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe usual form of the Tellina is broad at one end and gradually tapering\r\ntowards the other. It derives its name from the Greek word τελειω, to\r\nbring to a termination.\r\n\r\nShell of variable form, generally striated longitudinally and very\r\ncompressed; equivalve, more or less inequilateral; anterior side longer\r\nand more rounded than the posterior; offers a flexuous plait or twist at\r\nthe inferior margin; summits little marked; hinge similar; one or two\r\ncardinal teeth; two distant lateral teeth, with a pit at their base in\r\neach valve; ligament external.\r\n\r\n                            Tellina radiata.\r\n                            T. unimaculata.\r\n                            T. semizonalis.\r\n                            T. maculosa.\r\n                            T. virgata.\r\n                            T. staurella.\r\n                            T. crucigera.\r\n                            T.

Pl. 8, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nShell elongated; posterior side shorter and more narrow than the\r\nanterior.\r\n\r\n_T. foliacea._ The foliaceous Tellen.\r\n\r\nSpecies transversely oblong; upon the edge of the front side of either\r\nvalve are rows of serrated teeth, running from the apex to the margin.\r\n\r\n_T. bimaculata._ The double-spotted Tellen.\r\n\r\nSpecies orbicular, easily known by answering to its common name.\r\n\r\n_T. fabula._ The false Tellen.\r\n\r\nShell very thin, pellucid, and oval; yellowish colour, darker towards\r\nthe umbo, which is nearly central, pointed and turned a little to one\r\nside; anterior side slopes to an obtuse point; posterior side large and\r\nrounded; hinge with three teeth in one valve and two in the other.\r\n\r\n_T. scobinata._ The rasp Tellen.\r\n\r\nSpecies oval or sub-orbicular, sub-equilateral.\r\n\r\n_T. donacina._ The Donax-like Tellen. Pl. 9, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nSub-oval, flattish, semi-striated and semipellucid; hinge with two teeth\r\nin one valve and one in the other; pale yellow, radiated longitudinally\r\nwith pink.\r\n\r\n_T. depressa._ The depressed Tellen.\r\n\r\nOval, flat, pointed at the smaller end and slightly reflected; pale\r\nyellowish colour, faintly striated concentrically; covered with a pale\r\nbrown epidermis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      5. Tellinides. One species.\r\n\r\nThough this genus bears a great affinity to many others, it cannot be\r\nunited with any; having lateral teeth, it differs from the Psammobia; by\r\nnot having the valves twisted, it differs from the Tellina; the valves\r\nclosing, and having muscular impressions in the interior, render it\r\ndistinct from the Lucina.\r\n\r\nShell equilateral, rather elongated, almost without the flexuous plait;\r\ntwo cardinal teeth diverging, and two remote lateral teeth, of which the\r\nanterior is but little distant from the summit.\r\n\r\n_T. Timorensis._ The Tellinides of Timor. Pl. 8, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nThe only type and species of this genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        6. Corbis. One species.\r\n\r\nThis genus was at first classed by Lamarck with the Lucina; but Cuvier,\r\nhaving discovered that the organization of the animals differed, made\r\nthis a distinct genus, which was adopted by Lamarck.\r\n\r\nShell transverse, equivalve, no flexuosity; apices curved inward,\r\nopposed to each other; two primary and two lateral teeth, the posterior\r\none nearest to the hinge; muscular impression simple, valves sometimes\r\nconvex, strongly ribbed transversely, striated longitudinally, margins\r\nserrated and closely interlocking.\r\n\r\n_C. fimbriata._ The fringed Corbis. Pl. 8, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nSpecies white, rather thick, oval, a little elongated, almost\r\nequilateral; the cardinal and the lateral teeth well marked; the\r\nmuscular impression anterior, rounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       7. Lucina. Twenty species.\r\n\r\nIn the hinge and lateral teeth it much resembles the Tellina, but\r\ndiffers from it in never being flexuous. This genus is more easily\r\ncharacterized by the orbicular, compressed, general form of the shell,\r\nthan by the dental system, which is sometimes entirely effaced.\r\n\r\nShell compressed, regular, orbicular, sub-equilateral; summits small and\r\npointed, inclined anteriorly; hinge similar, but variable; two divergent\r\ncardinal teeth, little marked, and sometimes entirely effaced; two\r\nremote lateral teeth, with a pit at the base, sometimes obsolete;\r\nposterior ligament more or less sunk; two widely-separated muscular\r\nimpressions, of which the anterior is narrow and long.\r\n\r\n                          Lucina Jamaicensis.\r\n                          L.

Jamaicensis._ The Jamaica Lucina. Pl. 8, fig. 8.\r\n\r\nSpecies lenticular, striated concentrically; the teeth of the hinge\r\nvariable, and sometimes obsolete.\r\n\r\n_L. undata._ The waved Lucina.\r\n\r\nOrbicular, thin, convex, undulated with fine irregular striæ; exterior\r\npale yellow, interior white; margin glossy and plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n            8. Donax. The Wedge Shell. Twenty-seven species.\r\n\r\nThe singularity of form that gave rise to its common name renders it\r\neasily distinguished. It very much resembles a wedge, being very broad\r\nand thick at one extremity, and gradually tapering towards the other.\r\nThey vary in colour, but the most general is purple radiated on a white\r\nground, diverging from the beak to the margin; many have an orange\r\ntinge, and others a pink hue; the interior generally partakes of the\r\ncolour of the exterior. There are not, perhaps, two species that have\r\nabsolutely the same hinge.\r\n\r\nThe Donax is found buried deep in the sand of the seashore, with the\r\nshort side uppermost.\r\n\r\nShell sub-trigonal, greater in length than in height, equivalve, very\r\ninequilateral; posterior side much shorter than the anterior; summits\r\nalmost vertical; hinge complex, similar; two cardinal teeth in one or\r\nboth valves; one or two remote lateral teeth on each valve; ligament\r\nposterior, short, and inflated; two rounded muscular impressions.\r\n\r\n                           Donax scortum.\r\n                           D. pubescens.\r\n                           D. compressa.\r\n                           D. cuneata.\r\n                           D. deltoides.\r\n                           D. radians.\r\n                           D. abbreviata.\r\n                           D. triquetra.\r\n                           D. ringens.\r\n                           D. rugosa.\r\n                           D.

Pl. 8, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nSpecies oval, of which the posterior side is sub-truncated; with\r\ndecussated and muricated striæ.\r\n\r\n_D. trunculus._ The common Donax.\r\n\r\nOblong, glossy, finely striated longitudinally, transversely banded and\r\nradiated with purple; white, clouded with purple within; internal margin\r\nof the valves distinctly dentated or crenulated.\r\n\r\n_D. denticulata._ The denticulated Donax.\r\n\r\nSpecies of which the posterior side is truncated; furrowed from the\r\nsummit to the base.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         9. Capsa. Two species.\r\n\r\nThis genus was separated by Lamarck from the Donax on account of the\r\npeculiarity of the hinge.\r\n\r\n                          Capsa lævigata.\r\n                          Capsa Braziliensis.\r\n\r\n_C. lævigata._ The smooth Capsa.\r\n\r\nTriangular, sub-equilateral, obsoletely striated transversely; covered\r\nwith a greenish yellow epidermis; inside violet towards the umbones.\r\n\r\n_C. Braziliensis._ The Brazilian Capsa. Pl. 8, fig. 7.\r\n\r\nShell elongated, covered with epidermis; equivalve, close; the cardinal\r\nteeth reduced to one large sub-bifid tooth on the right valve, placing\r\nitself between two very thin ones on the left; ligament external, on the\r\nshort side.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       10. Crassina. One species.\r\n\r\nDistinguished from the Crassatella by the position of the ligament, and\r\nfrom the Venus by having only two teeth on each valve; one of them on\r\nthe left valve projects very slightly.\r\n\r\n_C. Danmoniensis._ The Devonshire Crassina. Pl. 6, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nSolid, thick, sub-orbicular, sub-equilateral; two very large divergent\r\nteeth on one valve, and two very unequal ones on the other; regular\r\nparallel grooves and ribs; covered with a yellowish epidermis; inside\r\nwhite; margin broad and plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY IX.\r\n                        CONCHACEA. Seven genera.\r\n\r\nThis family is divided into Conchæ fluviatiles, fresh-water shells, and\r\nConchæ marinæ, sea shells.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     C. FLUVIATILES. Three genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       1. Cyclas. Eleven species.\r\n\r\nThe shells of this genus are very small, and are found buried in the mud\r\nof fresh waters; the apices or summits are never eroded, and some\r\nspecies are so thin as to be transparent.\r\n\r\nShell covered with a brown epidermis, oval or sub-orbicular, regular,\r\nequivalve, inequilateral; summits blunt, contiguous, or turned\r\nanteriorly; hinge similar, complex, formed by a variable number of\r\ncardinal teeth, and by two remote lateral teeth with a cavity at the\r\nbase; ligament exterior, posterior, and convex; two distant muscular\r\nimpressions, without posterior sinus.\r\n\r\n                            Cyclas rivicola.\r\n                            C. cornea.\r\n                            C. lacustris.\r\n                            C. obliqua.\r\n                            C. calyculata.\r\n                            C. obtusalis.\r\n                            C. fontinalis.\r\n                            C. Australis.\r\n                            C. sulcata.\r\n                            C. striatina.\r\n                            C. Sarratogea.\r\n\r\n_C. cornea._ The horny Cyclas. Pl. 9, fig. 7.\r\n\r\nSpecies sub-orbicular, convex, thin, pellucid, with fine concentric\r\nstriæ; cardinal teeth a little variable, always very small, and\r\nsometimes obsolete; summits not eroded, covered with a horn-coloured\r\nepidermis; interior bluish white.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        2. Cyrena. Ten species.\r\n\r\nThis genus of shells is found in rapid rivers and streams; it was\r\nformerly classed with the Cyclas, from which, however, it greatly\r\ndiffers in having three cardinal teeth on each valve, and also lateral\r\nteeth. They are thick, solid shells, sometimes of a large size; the\r\napices always eroded or carious.\r\n\r\nShell rounded and trigonal, ventricose, inequilateral; hinge with three\r\nteeth on each valve; two lateral teeth, one of which is near the primary\r\nones; ligament exterior, placed on the largest side; in some species the\r\nlateral teeth are crenulated, in others they are entire.\r\n\r\n                           Cyrena trigonella.\r\n                           C. orientalis.\r\n                           C. cor.\r\n                           C. depressa.\r\n                           C. Caroliniensis.\r\n                           C. fuscata.\r\n                           C. fluminea.\r\n                           C. violacea.\r\n                           C. Bengalensis.\r\n                           C. Ceylanico.\r\n\r\n_C. fluminea._ The river Cyrena. Pl. 6, fig. 7.\r\n\r\nSpecies sub-trigonal or elongated oval; summits decorticated, more\r\nanterior; three cardinal teeth, of which the two posterior are forked;\r\nexterior greenish brown, interior variegated with white and violet;\r\nsulcated transversely.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       3. Galathea. One species.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful shell is found in fresh waters, and is distinguished from\r\nthe Cyrena by the divergent form of the primary tooth.\r\n\r\n_G. radiata._ The radiated Galathea. Pl. 6, fig. 8.\r\n\r\nShell equivalve, sub-trigonal, covered with a greenish epidermis,\r\nbeneath which the surface is of a milky white, highly polished, with\r\nseveral violet or pale chestnut rays diverging from the apex to the\r\nmargin; primary teeth furrowed, two on the right valve joined at the\r\nbase, three on the other valve placed triangularly, the intermediate one\r\nbeing advanced, separate, thick, and callous; the muscular impressions\r\nare lateral, and appear double on each side.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        C. MARINÆ. Four genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        4. Cyprina. Two species.\r\n\r\nThis shell is generally large, resembling the Venus, from which it may\r\nbe distinguished by having on the front side one impressed lateral\r\ntooth, which is sometimes obsolete; the nymphæ or callosities of the\r\nhinge large, arched, and terminated near the apices by a cavity,\r\nsometimes very deep.\r\n\r\nDe Blainville says that this genus is intermediary to the Cyclas and the\r\nVenus, and contains but one living species; Lamarck makes two, though at\r\nfirst he characterized eight.\r\n\r\n                          Cyprina tennistria.\r\n                          Cyprina Islandica.\r\n\r\n_C. Islandica._ The Icelandic Cyprina. Pl. 9, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nShell thick, regular, heart-shaped, covered with dark brown epidermis;\r\nwhite interior; sub-striated longitudinally; apices very strongly\r\nrecurved anteriorly, and often contiguous; hinge thick, sub-similar,\r\nformed by three cardinal teeth but little convergent, and by one remote\r\nposterior lateral tooth, sometimes obsolete; ligament very thick,\r\nconvex, fixed to large, arched, nymphal callosities, preceded by a\r\ncavity more or less deep, hollowed immediately behind the summits;\r\nmuscular impressions subcircular and very distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  5. Cytherea. Seventy-eight species.\r\n\r\nThis genus was taken from the Venus, and is easily defined as distinct\r\nfrom it by having four primary teeth on one valve, and only three united\r\non the other, with an isolated cavity, oval and parallel to the margin;\r\nthe lateral teeth divergent to the summit. In some species the internal\r\nmargin is entire, having the anterior cardinal tooth with a striated\r\ncanal or uneven sides; in others the anterior cardinal tooth is entire,\r\nwithout a striated canal; sometimes the internal margin is crenulated or\r\ndentated.\r\n\r\nShell solid, regular, equivalve, inequilateral; apices equal, recurved,\r\nand slightly projecting; four primary teeth on one valve, of which three\r\nare divergent and approximating at the base, and one remote; three\r\nprimary divergent teeth on the other valve, with a distant cavity\r\nparallel to the edge.\r\n\r\n                           Cytherea lusoria.\r\n                           C. petechialis.\r\n                           C. impudica.\r\n                           C. castanea.\r\n                           C. zonaria.\r\n                           C. graphica.\r\n                           C. morphina.\r\n                           C. purpurata.\r\n                           C. casta.\r\n                           C. corbicula.\r\n                           C. meretrix.\r\n                           C. gigantea.\r\n                           C. erycina.\r\n                           C. lilacina.\r\n                           C. impar.\r\n                           C. erycinella.\r\n                           C. pectoralis.\r\n                           C. planatella.\r\n                           C. florida.\r\n                           C. nitidula.\r\n                           C.

Venus. Eighty-eight species.\r\n\r\nThis genus of shells is numerous and varied. It surpasses all bivalve\r\nshells in beauty, and is in form very like the Cytherea, but easily\r\ndistinguished by the hinge, which almost invariably contains three\r\napproximate teeth, and a lateral tooth diverging to the summit. The\r\ninternal margin of the valves is crenated or dentated, with or without\r\nlamellar striæ.\r\n\r\nThe shells are of the most beautiful and lively tints; the exterior as\r\nwell as the interior colouring is of almost every possible shade and\r\nhue. They are found buried a little below the surface on the sandy\r\nshores of most parts of the world, particularly in warm climates.\r\n\r\nShell solid, thick, regular, perfectly equivalve and close, more or less\r\ninequilateral; summits well marked, inclined anteriorly; hinge\r\nsub-similar; the middle cardinal tooth forked, or three cardinal teeth\r\nmore or less contiguous and convergent towards the summit; ligament\r\nthick, often arched, convex, and exterior; two distant muscular\r\nimpressions; cordiform depressions beneath the beaks.\r\n\r\n                           Venus puerpera.\r\n                           V. reticulata.\r\n                           V. pygmæa.\r\n                           V. corbis.\r\n                           V. verrucosa.\r\n                           V. rugosa.\r\n                           V. casina.\r\n                           V. crebiscula.\r\n                           V. crenulata.\r\n                           V. discina.\r\n                           V. granulata.\r\n                           V. marica.\r\n                           V. cingulata.\r\n                           V. cardivides.\r\n                           V. grisea.\r\n                           V. elliptica.\r\n                           V.

Five genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n        1. Cardium. Cockle, or Heart Shell. Forty-eight species.\r\n\r\nThis genus received its name from its resemblance to a heart (καρδια).\r\nIt is so well defined by Linnæus that no alteration was made by Lamarck,\r\nexcept in making two divisions of them; the first distinguished by\r\nhaving the anterior side as large or larger than the posterior, and no\r\ndistinct angle at the apex; the second by possessing carinated or\r\nangular umbones, and the posterior side often much larger than the\r\nanterior. These shells are found at a small depth in the sand on almost\r\nevery seashore.\r\n\r\nShell inflated, equivalve, sub-cordiform (when seen anteriorly),\r\ngenerally costated from the summit to the circumference; summits very\r\nevident; slightly recurved forward; hinge complex, similar, formed by\r\ntwo oblique cardinal teeth, articulating with the corresponding teeth on\r\nthe other valve; two distant lateral teeth on each valve; ligament\r\ndorsal, posterior, and very short.\r\n\r\n                           Cardium costatum.\r\n                           C.

There is some difficulty in distinguishing\r\nthis genus from the Venericardia, without carefully examining the\r\nposition of the two teeth.\r\n\r\nShell regular, thick, solid, equivalve, more or less inequilateral;\r\nsummit dorsal, always very recurved anteriorly; hinge similar, formed by\r\ntwo oblique teeth; one short cardinal placed beneath the umbo, the other\r\noblique, arched, marginal, and prolonged; ligament elongated,\r\nsub-exterior, and inserted; two very distinct muscular impressions.\r\n\r\n                           Cardita sulcata.\r\n                           C. ajar.\r\n                           C. turgida.\r\n                           C. squamosa.\r\n                           C. phrenetica.\r\n                           C. crassicosta.\r\n                           C. rufescens.\r\n                           C. calyculata.\r\n                           C. subaspera.\r\n                           C. nodulosa.\r\n                           C. intermedia.\r\n                           C. trepezia.\r\n                           C. bicolor.\r\n                           C. depressa.\r\n                           C. concamerata.\r\n                           C. sinuata.\r\n                           C. aviculina.\r\n                           C. citrina.\r\n                           C. sublævigata.\r\n                           C. corbularis.\r\n                           C. lithophagella.\r\n\r\n_C. crassicosta._ The thick-ribbed Cardita.\r\n\r\nSpecies elongated, a little gaping at the inferior margin; ligament\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\n_C. sulcata._ The furrowed Cardita. Pl. 10, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nSub-cordiform or oval, more transverse than longitudinal; colour white,\r\ntesselated with brown; posterior depression heart-shaped; longitudinal,\r\nconvex, transversely-striated ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     3. Cypricardia. Four species.\r\n\r\nDistinguished from the Cardita by having three teeth beneath the apices,\r\nand a callous lengthened tooth or ridge.\r\n\r\nShell obliquely elongated, equivalve, inequilateral; valves striated,\r\nbut never ribbed; hinge with three teeth beneath the umbo, and one\r\nlateral elongated tooth.\r\n\r\n                         Cypricardia Guinaica.\r\n                         C. angulata.\r\n                         C. rostrata.\r\n                         C. coralliophaga.\r\n\r\n_C. Guinaica._ The Guinea Cypricardia. Pl. 10, fig. 6.\r\n\r\nSpecies elongated, very inequilateral; summit rounded and recurved\r\nanteriorly; two short divergent cardinal teeth, besides a lamellous\r\ntooth; ligament very long, projecting or not; yellowish white, covered\r\nwith decussated striæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       4. Hiatella. Two species.\r\n\r\nEstablished by Daudin; classed by Linnæus with the Solen, but Lamarck is\r\nof opinion that it more nearly approximates the Cardita.\r\n\r\nShell thin, sub-rhomboidal, equivalve, very inequilateral, gaping at its\r\ninferior margin and posterior extremity; the summit very anterior and\r\nrecurved in front; dorsal hinge formed by a single tooth on one valve\r\ncorresponding to a semicircular slope on the opposite valve, or by a\r\nsmall tooth with a cardinal cavity in each valve; ligament probably\r\nexterior and dorsal; muscular impressions unknown.\r\n\r\n                           Hiatella Arctica.\r\n                           Hiatella biaperta.\r\n\r\n_H. Arctica._ The Arctic Hiatella.\r\n\r\nShell small, transversely oblong; apices truncated, with two divergent\r\nspring ridges; a small tooth on each valve; cream colour, with\r\ndecussated striæ; inside pearly.\r\n\r\n_H. biaperta._ The double-clefted Hiatella. Pl. 10, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nSpecies that has only a single tooth on one valve; yellowish white.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      5. Isocardia. Three species.\r\n\r\nTaken from the Chama of Linnæus on account of a peculiarity in the shape\r\nof the cardinal teeth, and the singular curvature of the umbones.\r\n\r\n                            Isocardia cor.\r\n                            I. semisulcata.\r\n                            I. Moltkiana.\r\n\r\n_I. cor._ The heart Isocardia. Pl. 12, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nShell free, regular, heart-shaped, equivalve, very inequilateral;\r\nsummits diverging, strongly recurved spirally, forward, and outward;\r\nhinge dorsal, long, similar, formed by two flat cardinal teeth, with an\r\nelongated lateral one behind the ligament, which is dorsal and exterior,\r\ndiverging towards the summits; muscular impressions very distinct and\r\nrather small; slightly wrinkled longitudinally; exterior reddish\r\nchestnut colour, interior white.\r\n\r\nThe Isocardia Moltkiana is a very rare shell, and the most elegant\r\nspecies of this genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY XI.\r\n                         ARCACEA. Four genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       1. Cucullæa. One species.\r\n\r\nDistinguished from the Arca by the muscular impression within, to one\r\nside of which is an ear-shaped testaceous appendage; the shell is more\r\ntrapeziform, and the hinge by age becomes obsolete, giving the teeth a\r\nmore horizontal appearance.\r\n\r\nShell equivalve, inequilateral, trapeziform, heart-shaped; beaks\r\ndistant, and separated by the angular groove of the ligament, which is\r\naltogether external; hinge linear, straight, with small transverse\r\nteeth, having at its extremity from two to five parallel ribs; valves\r\nmarked with minute and strong longitudinal striæ, and sometimes one\r\nvalve overlaps; margins crenulated.\r\n\r\n_C. auriculifera._ The eared Cucullæa. Pl. 10, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nSpecies navicular or obliquely heart-shaped, with decussated striæ;\r\nhinge completely straight, with two parallel ribs at each end, the\r\nterminal teeth longer and more oblique than the others; exterior\r\nchestnut colour, interior white, tinged with violet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                2. Arca. The Ark. Thirty-seven species.\r\n\r\nThis genus is easily known by its resemblance to the hull of a ship; the\r\nhinge is peculiar, being composed of numerous sharp teeth alternately\r\ninserted between each other. The Arca of Linnæus was divided by Lamarck\r\ninto the four genera that compose this family, each possessing a strong\r\ndistinctive character. All the shells of this family are found in the\r\nsea at a little distance from the shore; they are covered with a dark\r\ngreenish lamellar or velvet-like epidermis, frequently ending in a deep\r\nfringe at the margin.\r\n\r\nShell a little varied in form, but most generally elongated, and more or\r\nless oblique at the posterior extremity; sometimes very inequilateral;\r\nsummits more or less distant, and a little recurved forward; hinge\r\nanomalous, straight, or a little curved; long, and formed by a line of\r\nshort vertical teeth decreasing from the extremities to the centre;\r\nligament exterior, broad; sometimes the margin is crenated.\r\n\r\n                            Arca tortuosa.\r\n                            A. semitorta.\r\n                            A. Noæ.\r\n                            A. tetragona.\r\n                            A. umbonata.\r\n                            A. sinuata.\r\n                            A. avellana.\r\n                            A. cardissa.\r\n                            A. ventricosa.\r\n                            A. retusa.\r\n                            A. sulcata.\r\n                            A. ovata.\r\n                            A. Helbingii.\r\n                            A. scapha.\r\n                            A. barbata.\r\n                            A. fusca.\r\n                            A. Magellanica.\r\n                            A. Domingensis.\r\n                            A. lactea.\r\n                            A. trapezina.\r\n                            A. pistachia.\r\n                            A. pisolina.\r\n                            A. cancellaria.\r\n                            A. callifera.\r\n                            A. irudina.\r\n                            A. bisulcata.\r\n                            A. Indica.\r\n                            A. senilis.\r\n                            A. antiquata.\r\n                            A. rhombea.\r\n                            A. granosa.\r\n                            A. auriculata.\r\n                            A. Brasiliana.\r\n                            A. corbicula.\r\n                            A. squamosa.\r\n                            A. Cayennensis.\r\n                            A. inequivalvis.\r\n\r\n_A. Noæ._ Noah’s Ark. Pl. 10, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nSpecies boat-shaped, oblong, striated transversely and ribbed\r\nlongitudinally; umbones remote and incurvated; margins entire and\r\ngaping; hinge straight; whitish, with divergent zigzag chestnut stripes;\r\ninside bluish white.\r\n\r\n_A. tortuosa._ The twisted Ark.\r\n\r\nA rare species; shell elongated, close, twisted; hinge completely\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\n_A. barbata._ The bearded Ark.\r\n\r\nSpecies with the hinge straight, not hollowed or not gaping inferiorly,\r\nand of which the muscle is not adherent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   3. Pectunculus. Nineteen species.\r\n\r\nThis genus has the ligament partially inserted internally, and has no\r\nexterior angular groove. The valves never gape, often have rayed\r\nlongitudinal ribs, are compressed, and the shell by age becomes thick\r\nand ponderous, sometimes attaining a large size. The teeth in the hinge\r\nare not so numerous as in the Arca and Cucullæa; the centre teeth appear\r\nworn down.\r\n\r\nShell close, orbicular, doubly convex, equivalve, sub-equilateral;\r\nsummits almost vertical, and more or less distant; hinge formed on each\r\nvalve by a rather numerous series of small teeth, disposed in a curved\r\nline, sometimes broken under the summit; ligament external and large.\r\n\r\n                        Pectunculus glycimeris.\r\n                        P. pilosus.\r\n                        P. undulatus.\r\n                        P. marmoratus.\r\n                        P. scriptus.\r\n                        P. angulatus\r\n                        P. stellatus.\r\n                        P. pallens.\r\n                        P. violacescens.\r\n                        P. zonalis.\r\n                        P. pennaceus.\r\n                        P. rubens.\r\n                        P. castaneus.\r\n                        P. pectiniformis.\r\n                        P. striatularis.\r\n                        P. nummarius.\r\n                        P. pectinatus.\r\n                        P. radians.\r\n                        P. vitreus.\r\n\r\n_P. glycimeris._ The delicious Pectunculus.\r\n\r\nSub-orbicular, umbones produced; finely striated transversely and\r\nlongitudinally; covered with epidermis, under which it is marked with\r\nreddish chestnut spots or bands; inside white; margins crenulated.\r\n\r\n_P. pilosus._ The hairy Pectunculus.\r\n\r\nSpecies convex, more or less smooth and hairy.\r\n\r\n_P. pectiniformis._ The Pecten-shaped Pectunculus. Pl. 11, fig. 6.\r\n\r\nSpecies lenticular, more compressed, pectinated, and more or less rough.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        4. Nucula. Six species.\r\n\r\nShell small, more or less thick, sub-triangular, equivalve,\r\ninequilateral; summits contiguous and turned forward; hinge similar,\r\nformed by a numerous series of very pointed teeth, pectinated and\r\ndisposed in a line interrupted under the summit; ligament internal,\r\nshort, inserted in a small oblique cavity in each valve; two muscular\r\nimpressions; valves more or less pearly within.\r\n\r\n                           Nucula lanceolata.\r\n                           N. rostrata.\r\n                           N. pella.\r\n                           N.

Pl. 11, fig. 7.\r\n\r\nSpecies of which the margin is crenated; numerous regular pectinated\r\nteeth; obliquely ovate, trigonal; striæ minute and almost obsolete;\r\ncovered with a greenish epidermis; inside silvery, pearl-like.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FAMILY XII.\r\n                        TRIGONACEA. Two genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       1. Trigonia. One species.\r\n\r\nSupposed to be in very deep places in the sea; it is a strong,\r\nbeautiful, pearly shell, sub-trigonal or sub-orbicular; thick, regular,\r\nequivalve, inequilateral; summits slightly prominent, recurved,\r\nanterodorsal; hinge complex, dorsal, dissimilar; two large oblong teeth\r\nlaterally compressed, joined angularly under the summit, strongly\r\nfurrowed on the right valve, penetrating into two excavations of the\r\nsame form, equally furrowed on the left valve; ligament exterior and\r\nmarginal; two distinct muscular impressions.\r\n\r\n_T. pectinata._ The pectinated Trigonia. Pl. 11, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nSpecies sub-orbicular, with radiated or divergent, prominent, and\r\nsomewhat scaly ribs; inside pearly; margin crenellated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       2. Castalia. One species.\r\n\r\nThis genus is found in fresh waters, and differs from the Trigonia in\r\nthe number and position of the lamellar teeth. The substance of the\r\nshell is pearly.\r\n\r\nShell sub-trigonal, equivalve, inequilateral; umbones eroded, covered\r\nwith epidermis, and inflected anteriorly; hinge with two lamellar teeth,\r\ntransversely striated, one of them posterior, distant, and shortened,\r\nthe other anterior, lengthened, and lateral; ligament exterior.\r\n\r\n_C. ambigua._ The ambiguous Castalia. Pl. 11, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nShort, sub-trigonal; umbones truncated; longitudinally ribbed, with\r\ndistant transverse striæ; covered with epidermis, under which the shell\r\nis of a pale chestnut brown, inside pearly; the lamellar and præ-apicial\r\nteeth are well marked, more regular, and all striated perpendicular to\r\ntheir length.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FAMILY XIII.\r\n                         NAIADES. Four genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     1. Unio. Forty-eight species.\r\n\r\nThe species of this genus become every day more numerous; they are found\r\nin all countries, but particularly in North America. The Unio is a\r\nfresh-water shell, and therefore, with great propriety, removed from the\r\nMya, which consists entirely of marine shells. The substance is pearly;\r\nthe exterior covered with a brown or green epidermis; the apices eroded.\r\nThey are found in the mud of rivers, with their apices downward; some\r\nare slightly gaping, and some species produce fine pearls.\r\n\r\nShell generally very thick, pearly within, covered with epidermis;\r\nsummits eroded, dorsal, and sub-interior; besides a long lamellous tooth\r\nunder the ligament, the hinge is formed by a double precardinal tooth,\r\nmore or less compressed, and dentated irregularly on the left valve,\r\nsimple on the right valve; ligament external, dorsal, and post-apicial;\r\nmuscular impressions well marked.\r\n\r\n                           Unio sinuata.\r\n                           U. elongata.\r\n                           U. crassidens.\r\n                           U.

Anodonta. Fifteen species.\r\n\r\nA fresh-water shell, found in ponds and lakes, difficult to be\r\ndistinguished from the Unio but by the hinge, which wants the cardinal\r\nand lateral tooth, and merely presents a smooth internal rim round the\r\nedge terminated by a sinus or notch, in which the anterior extremity of\r\nthe ligament is sunk; the substance is pearly, covered with a false\r\nepidermis.\r\n\r\nShell ordinarily rather thin, regular, close, equivalve, inequilateral;\r\nsummit anterodorsal; hinge linear, without teeth; ligament external,\r\ndorsal, and post-apicial; two well-marked muscular impressions.\r\n\r\n                           Anodonta cygnæa.\r\n                           A. anatina.\r\n                           A. sulcata.\r\n                           A. fragilis.\r\n                           A. cataracta.\r\n                           A. trapezialis.\r\n                           A. exotica.\r\n                           A. rubens.\r\n                           A. crispata.\r\n                           A. uniopsis.\r\n                           A.

One species.\r\n\r\nA very rare shell, separated from the Anodonta on account of the hinge\r\nbeing attenuated in the middle, and having small tubercles distributed\r\nalong its length. The substance is thicker and more solid than the\r\nAnodonta, and of a brilliant rose-coloured pearly hue; it is found in\r\nthe rivers of warm countries.\r\n\r\nShell equivalve, inequilateral, transverse, with small apices; recurved,\r\nbut nearly erect; not auriculated; hinge very long, linear, crenulated\r\nthrough all its length; ligament external and marginal; two well-marked\r\nmuscular impressions.\r\n\r\n_I. exotica._ The exotic Iridina.\r\n\r\nThe only species of this genus answering to the above description.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FAMILY XIV.\r\n                        CHAMACEA. Three genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    1. Diceras. One fossil species.\r\n\r\nOnly found in a fossil state; distinguished from the Chama by the hinge,\r\nwhich is dissimilar, formed by a large thick tooth, concave in the\r\ngreater valve; summits very projecting; almost regular spiral\r\ncontortions.\r\n\r\n_D. arietina._ The ram’s-horn Diceras.\r\n\r\nShell irregular, inequivalve, inequilateral, somewhat heart-shaped, with\r\ndivergent beaks.\r\n\r\n\r\n            2. Chama. The Clam or Gaper. Seventeen species.\r\n\r\nIn this genus are now comprehended only such as have a thick oblique\r\ntransverse tooth, resembling a lengthened callosity, generally\r\ncrenulated or grooved, fitting into a corresponding cavity in the lower\r\nvalve. The animals inhabiting these shells have the faculty of affixing\r\nthemselves to other bodies by the lower valve.\r\n\r\nThe Chama received its name from its gaping; it is found in most seas,\r\nparticularly in the Southern; sometimes its colours are elegantly\r\nblended.\r\n\r\nShell irregular, adherent, inequivalve, inequilateral; summits more or\r\nless twisted spirally, especially in the lower valve; some from left to\r\nright, others from right to left; hinge dissimilar, large, formed by one\r\nlamellous, arched, sub-crenulated, post-cardinal tooth, articulating\r\ninto a furrow of the same form; exterior, post-apicial, slightly\r\ninserted; two large and rather distant muscular impressions.\r\n\r\n                             Chama Lazarus.\r\n                             C. damæcornis.\r\n                             C. gryphoides.\r\n                             C. crenulata.\r\n                             C. unicornis,\r\n                             C. arcinella.\r\n                             C. radians.\r\n                             C. cristella.\r\n                             C. florida.\r\n                             C. limbula.\r\n                             C. æruginosa.\r\n                             C. asperella.\r\n                             C. decussata.\r\n                             C. albida.\r\n                             C. ruderalis.\r\n                             C. croceata.\r\n                             C.

Pl. 12, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nSpecies of which the summits twist from left to right; imbricated,\r\ndilated, waved foliations; striated obsoletely; exterior white, orange,\r\nred, or yellow; interior white.\r\n\r\n_C. arcinella._ The hedgehog Chama.\r\n\r\nSpecies of which the summits twist from right to left; the pink-coloured\r\nones of this species are the most prized.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       3. Etheria. Four species.\r\n\r\nDistinguished from the Chama by the want of teeth in the hinge, and\r\nbeing of a pearly substance. It is a rare shell, only found in deep\r\nwater, where it is attached to the rocks by the lower valve. Its\r\nirregular form is perhaps occasioned by the lower valve adapting itself\r\nto the form of the body to which it is affixed. Two species are\r\nfluviatile and two marine.\r\n\r\nShell adhering, irregular, thick, pearly, inequivalve, inequilateral;\r\nsummits thick, little evident; hinge toothless, callous, thick,\r\nirregular; longitudinal, sub-dorsal ligament, partly exterior and partly\r\npenetrating into the shell; two oblong muscular impressions, one\r\ninferior and anterior, the other superior and sub-posterior; with or\r\nwithout an oblong incrusted callosity on the base of the valve.\r\n\r\n                           Etheria elliptica.\r\n                           E. semilunata.\r\n                           E. trigonula.\r\n                           E. transversa.\r\n\r\n_E. elliptica._ The oval Etheria. Pl. 11, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nSpecies with an oblong callosity on the anterior part of the shell;\r\noval, depressed, dilated towards the umbones; summits distant.\r\n\r\n_E. semilunata._ The semilunar Etheria.\r\n\r\nSpecies without callosity at the base.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY XV.\r\n                        TRIDACNITES. Two genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n               1. Tridacna. The Clam Shell. Six species.\r\n\r\nThe most ponderous shell known, sometimes measuring several feet in\r\nlength, and sometimes weighing five hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nBy Linnæus this genus was classed with the Chama, but the characteristic\r\ndistinctions are so great that they are easily known. The Chama is\r\nirregular, has but one tooth, and is fastened to other substances by the\r\nlower valve; the Tridacna is equivalve, has but two teeth, and is\r\naffixed to other bodies by a byssus consisting of filiform tendons.\r\n\r\nThe animal inhabiting this shell is said to produce very fine pearls,\r\nbut there is no pearly appearance on the valves.\r\n\r\nShell thick, solid, varying in size; some are very small and some very\r\nlarge; regular, triangular, more or less inequilateral; the summits\r\ninclined backward; hinge dissimilar, entirely anterior to the summits;\r\none lamellous precardinal tooth, and two distant lateral teeth on the\r\nleft valve, corresponding to two lamellous precardinal teeth and one\r\nremote lateral tooth in the right valve; ligament anterior, elongated;\r\none forked sub-median muscular impression, almost marginal and\r\noftentimes nearly obsolete; valves with broad, rounded longitudinal\r\nribs, armed with vaulted scales, more or less elevated; posterior slope\r\nheart-shaped, and widely gaping.\r\n\r\n                            Tridacna gigas.\r\n                            T. elongata.\r\n                            T. squamosa.\r\n                            T. crocea.\r\n                            T. mutica.\r\n                            T. serrifera.\r\n\r\n_T. gigas._ The giant Tridacna. Pl. 12, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nSpecies of which the shell is sometimes very large, white, transversely\r\novate or elongated; the anterior side longer than the posterior; broad\r\nribs covered with vaulted scales; when of a pink or orange colour,\r\ngreatly valued.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       2. Hippopus. One species.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the Tridacna, but distinguished from it by having its\r\nposterior slope closed with a dentated margin; its ribs are never arched\r\nor vaulted, and its anterior side is shorter than the posterior side.\r\n\r\n_H. maculatus._ The spotted Hippopus. Pl. 12, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nShell transversely ovate, ventricose, with scaly ribs; lunule,\r\nheart-shaped, and oblique; margins deeply crenulated; reddish purple\r\nspots.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FAMILY XVI.\r\n                        MYTILACEA. Three genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n              1. Mytilus. The Muscle. Thirty-five species.\r\n\r\nAs arranged by Lamarck, now comprises only such shells as are regular,\r\nequivalve, and longitudinal; solid in substance, and attached to other\r\nbodies by a short thick byssus.\r\n\r\nIn colour and appearance they greatly vary, some being smooth and\r\nbeautifully variegated with delicate colours, or radiated with purple\r\nand white; some are coarsely ribbed or granulated, and have only one\r\ncolour, as black, blue, yellow, brown, or green; all are covered with an\r\nepidermis, to which oftentimes the colour is confined.\r\n\r\nShell of a close texture, elongated, more or less oval, sometimes\r\nsub-triangular, equivalve, summits anterior, more or less curved, a\r\nlittle sloping inferiorly; hinge generally without teeth, or with two\r\nvery small rudimentary teeth; ligament dorsal, linear, sub-interior,\r\ninserted in a long and narrow furrow; two muscular impressions, of which\r\nthe anterior is very small, with or without longitudinal grooves or\r\nfurrows.\r\n\r\n                         Mytilus Magellanicus.\r\n                         M. erosus.\r\n                         M. crenatus.\r\n                         M. decussatus.\r\n                         M. hirsutus.\r\n                         M. elongatus.\r\n                         M. latus.\r\n                         M. zonarius.\r\n                         M. ungulatus.\r\n                         M. violaceus.\r\n                         M. opalus.\r\n                         M. smaragdinus.\r\n                         M. corneus.\r\n                         M. edulis.\r\n                         M. retusus.\r\n                         M.

Pl. 12, fig. 6.\r\n\r\nSpecies smooth, more or less triangular; summit near the anterior\r\nextremity; byssus obsolete in adults.\r\n\r\n_M. sulcata._ The furrowed Modiola.\r\n\r\nSpecies striated longitudinally.\r\n\r\n\r\n               3. Pinna. The Wing Shell. Fifteen species.\r\n\r\nThis genus is the same as constituted by Linnæus; the shell is marine,\r\ngenerally very brittle and fragile, in form resembling an acute angled\r\ntriangle; usually covered with longitudinal ribs and elevated transverse\r\nstriæ; generally horn coloured.\r\n\r\nThis genus is remarkable for the production of an abundant byssus of a\r\nfine brown silky texture, which the Italians frequently fabricate into\r\narticles of dress, equal in appearance to the finest silk.\r\n\r\nThe Pinnæ often grow to a large size; they are sometimes found standing\r\nerect in the smooth-water bays, with the base of the shell uppermost,\r\nbut generally affixed by the byssus to rocks and other sub-marine\r\nbodies. The filaments that compose the byssus are so tough and strong\r\nthat the shells are not easily detached.\r\n\r\nShell fibrous, fragile, regular, equivalve, longitudinal, triangular,\r\nbase gaping and as if truncated; summit pointed and straight; hinge\r\ndorsal, longitudinal, linear, and without teeth; marginal ligament\r\noccupying almost the whole of the dorsal edge of the shell; one very\r\nbroad muscular impression behind a trace of the anterior in the summit.\r\n\r\n                             Pinna rudis.\r\n                             P. flabellum.\r\n                             P. seminuda.\r\n                             P. angustina.\r\n                             P. nobilis.\r\n                             P. squamosa.\r\n                             P. marginata.\r\n                             P. muricata.\r\n                             P. pectinata.\r\n                             P. saccata.\r\n                             P. varicosa.\r\n                             P. dolabrata.\r\n                             P. ingens.\r\n                             P. vexillum.\r\n                             P. nigrina.\r\n\r\n_P. squamosa._ The scaly Pinna.\r\n\r\nSpecies very close and rounded at the posterior extremity; valves\r\nconvex, covered with vaulted imbricated scales.\r\n\r\n_P. flabellum._ The fan Pinna. Pl. 13, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nSpecies gaping at the posterior extremity, which is as if truncated;\r\nvalves rather rounded at the upper end, and in the shape of an expanded\r\nfan; light fawn colour.\r\n\r\n_P. pectinata._ The pectinated Pinna. Pl. 13, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThin, pellucid; longitudinally ribbed and spinous for half its width,\r\nobliquely striated transversely on the other half.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FAMILY XVII.\r\n                        MALLEACEA. Five genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      1. Crenatula. Seven species.\r\n\r\nThere is one peculiar distinction between this genus and the Perna; the\r\nhinge of the Crenatula is composed of slightly concave callous\r\ncrenulations, which receive the ligament; while in the Perna it consists\r\nof parallel truncated linear teeth (or, rather, riblike joints),\r\ncorresponding and opposed to the opposite ones, the ligament being\r\ninserted only in their interstices.\r\n\r\nShell thin, very delicate, irregular, valves flattened, foliaceous,\r\nsub-rhomboidal, sub-equivalve; hinge longitudinal, dorsal, without\r\nteeth; ligament sub-multiple, and inserted in a series of rounded\r\ncavities corresponding with the dorsal margin; one sub-central muscular\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\n                         Crenatula avicularis.\r\n                         C. modiolaris.\r\n                         C. nigrina.\r\n                         C. bicostalis.\r\n                         C. viridis.\r\n                         C. mytiloides.\r\n                         C. phasianoptera.\r\n\r\n_C. avicularis._ The avicular Crenatula.

Perna. Ten species.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the Crenatula, we gave the characteristic distinction,\r\nwhich regarded it natural and expedient to make the Perna form a\r\ndifferent genus.\r\n\r\nShell irregular, very compressed, foliaceous, sub-equivalve, rather\r\nvariable form, gaping at the anterior part of the lower extremity;\r\nsummit very small, hinge straight, vertical, without teeth; ligament\r\nmultiple, and inserted in a series of longitudinal parallel furrows.\r\n\r\n                            Perna ephippium.\r\n                            P. obliqua.\r\n                            P. isognomon.\r\n                            P. avicularis.\r\n                            P. femoralis.\r\n                            P. canina.\r\n                            P. marsupiom.\r\n                            P. sulcata.\r\n                            P. vulsella.\r\n                            P. nucleus.\r\n\r\n_P. femoralis._ The femoral Perna. Pl. 14, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nSpecies elongated, and with appendages like ears.\r\n\r\n_P. vulsella._ The tweezer Perna.\r\n\r\nSpecies elongated, without earlike appendages, or having very small\r\nones.\r\n\r\n_P. ephippium._ The saddle Perna.\r\n\r\nSpecies round, compressed, very pearly in the interior; very slightly,\r\nif at all, auricled; margin acute; exterior purplish brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  3. Malleus. The Hammer. Six species.\r\n\r\nA shell of a singular form, resembling a pickaxe, found only in the\r\nIndian and Australian Seas; there are two species, the white and the\r\nblack, both of which, when in fine preservation, are highly esteemed,\r\nbut the white is more rare and valuable.\r\n\r\nShell sub-nacreous, irregular, rugged, sub-equivalve, inequilateral,\r\ngenerally auricled before and prolonged behind, so as to be in form like\r\na hammer; summit entirely anterior; between them and the inferior\r\nauricle, an oblique cut or slope for the passage of the byssus; hinge\r\nlinear, elongated, without teeth; ligament simple, triangular, inserted\r\nin a conical oblique cavity, partly exterior; one rather large\r\nsub-central muscular impression.\r\n\r\n                            Malleus albus.\r\n                            M. vulgaris.\r\n                            M. normalis.\r\n                            M. vulsellatus.\r\n                            M. anatinus.\r\n                            M. decurtatus.\r\n\r\n_M. vulgaris._ The common Malleus. Pl. 14, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nSpecies with two earlike appendages; trilobate, colour blackish brown.\r\n\r\n_M. albus._ The white Malleus.\r\n\r\nSpecies trilobate; base of the lateral lobe prolonged, without a sinus;\r\nthe base and the pit of the ligament not distinct; colour white, with\r\ntransverse undulations.\r\n\r\n_M. vulsellatus._ The tweezer Malleus.\r\n\r\nSpecies slightly auricled.\r\n\r\n_M. normalis._ The square Malleus.\r\n\r\nSpecies without earlike appendages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     4. Avicula. Thirteen species.\r\n\r\nRemarkable for the form of its shell, which resembles, when partially\r\nexpanded, a bird flying.\r\n\r\nShell foliaceous or not, thin and very fragile, always pearly,\r\nsub-equivalve; form sub-regular, but rather variable; summit anterior;\r\nvalves oblique, the left one with a little notch, through which the\r\nbyssus passes; sometimes unequally and obliquely auricled; hinge linear,\r\ntoothless, or with two small rudimentary teeth; ligament more or less\r\nexterior, placed in a narrow groove, sometimes enlarged towards the\r\nsummit; one very large posterior muscular impression; and one very small\r\nanterior.\r\n\r\n                          Avicula macroptera.\r\n                          A. lotorium.\r\n                          A. semi-sagitta.\r\n                          A. heteroptera.\r\n                          A. falcata.\r\n                          A. crocea.\r\n                          A. Tarentina.\r\n                          A. Atlantica.\r\n                          A. squamulosa.\r\n                          A. papilionacea.\r\n                          A. costellata.\r\n                          A. physoides.\r\n                          A. virens.\r\n\r\n_A. macroptera._ The rounded Avicula. Pl. 14, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nSpecies oval, oblique, the earlike appendages very developed, especially\r\nthe superior; one tooth at the hinge.\r\n\r\n_A. Atlantica._ The Atlantic Avicula.\r\n\r\nObliquely curved, yellowish fawn colour, with dark reddish-brown stains;\r\ninterior pearly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      5. Meleagrina. Two species.\r\n\r\nThe form of the shell is orbicular and equivalve, without the elongated\r\ntransverse base on the cardinal tooth, and the sloping sides of the\r\nopening for the passage of the byssus are perceptible on both valves;\r\nthese peculiarities distinguish it from the Avicula.\r\n\r\nShell sub-equivalve, rotundate, nearly square, externally squamose; the\r\ninferior cardinal margin straight, not caudate anteriorly; a sinus at\r\nthe posterior base of the valves for the passage of the byssus; the left\r\nvalve being at this place narrow and channelled; hinge linear, without\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n                       Meleagrina margaritifera.\r\n                       Meleagrina albina.\r\n\r\n_M. margaritifera._ The pearl-bearing Meleagrina, sometimes called the\r\nmother-of-pearl oyster.\r\n\r\nSpecies slightly oblique, somewhat square, pearly, very thick,\r\ncompressed; undulated and transversely striated, with a series of\r\nlamellated longitudinal scales; exterior greenish, interior pearly. This\r\nshell is celebrated for its irridescent colours, and is valued for the\r\nbeautiful and costly pearls it produces. These pearls are formed from a\r\ndeposition of the substance destined to line the shell upon sand or\r\nother bodies, casually or purposely introduced within the mantle of the\r\nanimal; the shell itself is the mother-of-pearl used for inlaying, or\r\nmaking various elegant trinkets.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FAMILY XVIII.\r\n                       PECTINIDES. Seven genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n              1. Pedum. The Shepherd’s Crook. One species.\r\n\r\nThe common name was given to this genus from the resemblance to a French\r\nshepherd’s crook. The shell is of a regular form; its lower valve, in\r\nwhich is a sinus for the byssus, is turned up at the edges, and the\r\nupper valve falls within it.\r\n\r\nShell inequivalve, a little eared; apices unequal, distant, rounded,\r\nlittle evident; hinge without teeth; ligament inserted in an oblique\r\ngroove, prolonged to the summit, and carried within in a kind of\r\nspoonlike cavity.\r\n\r\n_P. spondyloideum._ The spondylus-shaped Pedum. Pl. 15, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nOvate, wedge shaped, flat; superior valve with longitudinal striæ;\r\nwhite, granulated, and rough; slightly tinged with purple near the beak.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 2. Lima. The File Shell. Six species.\r\n\r\nNo sinus or notch; the valves, thick and gaping, form a lateral opening;\r\nthe ears are small, but distinct.\r\n\r\nShell oval, more or less oblique, almost equivalve, with small ears,\r\nregularly gaping at the anterior part of the lower edge; summits\r\nanterior and distant; hinge longitudinal, without teeth; ligament\r\nrounded, almost exterior, inserted in a cavity of each valve; central\r\nmuscular impression divided into three very distinct parts.\r\n\r\n                             Lima inflata.\r\n                             L. squamosa.\r\n                             L. glacialis.\r\n                             L. annulata.\r\n                             L. fragilis.\r\n                             L. linguatula.\r\n\r\n_L. squamosa._ The scaly Lima. Pl. 15, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nAnswers to the above description, with valves ventricose, armed with\r\nvaulted scales.\r\n\r\n_L. fragilis._ The fragile Lima.\r\n\r\nOblong ovate, very pellucid, delicately white, with longitudinal\r\ndistinct striæ; lower margin denticulated, closely interlocking when the\r\nvalves are closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n              3. Pecten. The Scallop. Fifty-nine species.\r\n\r\nThe shells constituting this genus are found in all seas; they are well\r\nknown, and many of them are very beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe form is usually regular; their surface is adorned with elevated\r\ndivergent ribs, varying in number from five to thirty, proceeding from\r\nthe beaks and terminating at the margins in a scalloped outline.\r\n\r\nSome are equivalve, others have one valve flat and the other convex; the\r\ncolours of the upper valve are brighter than those of the lower.\r\n\r\nThere is considerable variation in the size and form of the ears, which\r\nin some species are equal or nearly so, but in others are unequal; some\r\nare so small as to be nearly indistinct. The ribs are variously\r\ndiversified with beautiful colours and delicate checker-work; the\r\nmargins are mostly crenated, and oftentimes beautifully coloured.\r\n\r\nThese shells were formerly worn by Pilgrims on their hat or coat, as a\r\nmark of having been to the holy shrine in Palestine.\r\n\r\nShell free, regular, thin, solid, auricled, equivalve, equilateral;\r\nsummits contiguous; hinge without teeth; a ligamental membrane through\r\nall the length of the hinge, besides a short, thick ligament, almost\r\nentirely internal, which fills a triangular cavity under the summits;\r\none sub-central muscular impression.\r\n\r\n                           Pecten maximus.\r\n                           P. medius.\r\n                           P.

Pl. 15, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nSpecies of which the two valves are ribbed and almost equally convex,\r\nthe right a little less, and having its inferior ear less broad than the\r\nleft, so as to produce a kind of groove for the passage of the byssus.\r\n\r\n_P. Jacobæus._ The scallop of St. James.\r\n\r\nSpecies very inequivalve; the left valve being very flat, the right\r\nconvex; ears equal.\r\n\r\n_P. pleuronectes._ The sole Scallop.\r\n\r\nSpecies equivalve, not closing; surface smooth and ribbed within; one\r\nvalve perfectly white, the other of a brownish or reddish colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  4. Plagiostoma. Ten fossil species.\r\n\r\nOnly known as fossils; probably introduced here by Lamarck to serve as a\r\nconnecting link for the genera Lima, Pecten, Spondylus, and Podopsis.\r\n\r\nShell rather thick, regular, free, sub-equivalve, sub-auriculated; the\r\ntwo valves almost equally convex, both provided with a distinct summit,\r\nrecurved in the middle of a level surface, with a great triangular slope\r\nin the middle; the cardinal base transverse, straight; hinge without\r\nteeth; a conical cardinal pit situated below the beak, partly internal,\r\nopening outward, and receiving the ligament.\r\n\r\n_P. spinosa._ The thorny Plagiostoma.\r\n\r\nSubarcuated, the umbo of one shell higher than that of the other, with\r\nlongitudinal ribs and remote concentric rings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      5. Plicatula. Five species.\r\n\r\nSeparated from the Spondylus of Linnæus on account of its distinct\r\nstructure. The ligament is altogether internal; it is without ears, and\r\nthe prolonged beak so conspicuous in that genus. The Plicatula has the\r\nfaculty of affixing itself to another body, so that many are found\r\ngrouped together in clusters. The valves are strongly plaited within and\r\nwithout, closely interlocking with each other.\r\n\r\nShell solid, adhering, sub-irregular, without ears, inequivalve, pointed\r\nat the summit, rounded and plaited behind; hinge with two strong teeth\r\nin each valve, with a cavity between them, in which the ligament is\r\ninternally inserted.\r\n\r\n                           Plicatula ramosa.\r\n                           P. depressa.\r\n                           P. cristata.\r\n                           P. reniformis.\r\n                           P. Australis.\r\n\r\n_P. ramosa._ The branched Plicatula. Pl. 15, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nOblong, trigonal, very thick; strong longitudinal plaits; exterior\r\nbrown, with a yellow tinge, with reddish arrow-shaped markings; interior\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n\r\n          6. Spondylus. The thorny Oyster. Twenty-one species.\r\n\r\nThe valves of this genus greatly resemble those of the common oyster,\r\nbut have ears, and are covered with long recurved or straight-pointed\r\nspines.\r\n\r\nThe lower valve is much larger than the upper, and has foliaceous\r\nlaminæ, by which it is attached to the other substances. They are found\r\nin all seas of hot countries, but particularly in the Indian; they\r\nadhere to rocks, coral, &c., oftentimes in large groups.\r\n\r\nThe usual colours are red, purple, white, brown, or orange, several of\r\nwhich are sometimes blended in the same shell.\r\n\r\nShell solid, adhering, sub-regular, more or less spined,\r\nsub-auriculated, inequivalve; the right or inferior valve fixed, much\r\nmore excavated than the other, and having behind, at the summit, a\r\ntriangular face, which enlarges and elongates with age; hinge\r\nlongitudinal, provided in each valve with two strong teeth entering into\r\ncorresponding cavities; ligament short, almost medial, partly exterior;\r\none sub-dorsal, muscular impression.\r\n\r\n                          Spondylus gædaropus.\r\n                          S. Americanus.\r\n                          S. arachnoides.\r\n                          S. candidus.\r\n                          S. multilamellatus.\r\n                          S. coccineus.\r\n                          S. crassisquama.\r\n                          S. spathuliferus.\r\n                          S. ducalis.\r\n                          S. longitudinalis.\r\n                          S. costatus.\r\n                          S. variegatus.\r\n                          S. longispineus.\r\n                          S. regius.\r\n                          S. avicularis.\r\n                          S. microlepos.\r\n                          S. croceus.\r\n                          S. aurantius.\r\n                          S. radians.\r\n                          S. zonalis.\r\n                          S. violacescens.\r\n\r\n_S. gædaropus._ The thorny red Spondylus. Pl. 15, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nUpper valve red, under one white, with longitudinal striæ or ribs; rough\r\ngranulations, and somewhat tongue-shaped; rather short truncated spines.\r\n\r\n_S. longispineus._ The long-spined Spondylus.\r\n\r\nThickly spined, longitudinally sulcated and ribbed; alternate spines\r\narcuated and tongue-shaped; valves of a reddish colour; umbones orange.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    7. Podopsis. Two fossil species.\r\n\r\nOnly introduced here to fill up the family and keep up the chain of\r\nconnexion. It approximates the genus Gryphea.\r\n\r\nShell rather thick, sub-regular, symmetrical, equilateral, inequivalve,\r\nadhering by the extremity of the shorter valve; the other terminated by\r\na summit pointed, a little recurved and medial; articulation very\r\nangular, by means of two very distant condyles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FAMILY XIX.\r\n                         OSTRACEA. Six genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        1. Gryphæa. One species.\r\n\r\nThis genus resembles the Ostrea, with which it was formerly classed, but\r\nfrom which it is distinguished by the peculiar character of the lower\r\nvalve. It is very deep and carinated, with a summit terminating in a\r\nlong spirally recurved beak, slightly turned to one side; the edge sharp\r\nand angular.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom, if ever, attached to other bodies. Shell more finely\r\nlamellated than that of the oyster, free or slightly adherent,\r\nsub-equilateral, very inequivalve; the lower valve very concave, with a\r\nsummit more or less recurved like a hook; the upper valve much smaller,\r\nand formed like a lid; hinge without teeth; ligament inserted in an\r\noblong arched cavity; one single muscular impression on each valve.\r\n\r\n_G. angulata._ The angulated Gryphæa. Pl. 16, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nOblong ovate, with three long longitudinal carinated ribs below; summit\r\nof the inferior valve is subvolute. This is a rare shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n              2. Ostrea. The Oyster. Forty-eight species.\r\n\r\nAs given by Lamarck, is a natural and well-defined family. It is too\r\nwell known to require description. It fixes itself to other bodies by\r\nthe laminæ of the whole surface of one valve, and generally remains\r\nimmoveable, exhibiting no other signs of life other than that of opening\r\nits valves to receive nutriment.\r\n\r\nShell irregular, inequivalve, inequilateral, exterior roughly\r\nfoliaceous, interior somewhat pearly; the left or inferior valve larger,\r\ndeeper, and adhesive, its summit prolonging with age in a sort of heel,\r\nthe right or superior valve smaller, more or less in the form of a lid;\r\nhinge without teeth; ligament short, sub-interior, inserted in an oblong\r\ncardinal cavity, increasing with the summit; muscular impression single\r\nand sub-central.\r\n\r\n                            Ostrea edulis.\r\n                            O. hippopus.\r\n                            O. borealis.\r\n                            O.

Pl. 16, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nSpecies orbicular, and not plaited; rugged, with undulated, imbricated\r\nscales; one valve flat and the other convex; variable in size; outside\r\ngreenish brown, inside pearly white, sometimes with a bluish tinge.\r\n\r\n_O. Virginica._ The Virginian Oyster.\r\n\r\nSpecies longitudinal and not plaited.\r\n\r\n_O. imbricata._ The imbricated Oyster.\r\n\r\nSpecies orbicular and plaited.\r\n\r\n_O. crista-galli._ The Cock’s-comb Oyster.\r\n\r\nSpecies strongly plaited longitudinally.\r\n\r\n\r\n                3. Vulsella. The Tweezers. Six species.\r\n\r\nThis genus has several characteristics which distinguish it from the\r\nOstrea; they are free; the valves and the apices are nearly equal, with\r\na projecting callosity on each valve, depressed underneath, and\r\nobliquely arched for the reception of the ligament.\r\n\r\nShell sub-nacreous, sub-regular, sub-equivalve, inequilateral; upper\r\nvalve finely granulated, or striated longitudinally from the apex to the\r\nmargin; summits anterior, distant, recurved below; hinge without teeth;\r\nligament undivided, thick, inserted in a rounded cavity, made in a\r\nslightly projecting callosity on each valve; muscular impression\r\nsub-central, rather large, and two very small ones entirely anterior.\r\n\r\n_V. lingulata._ The tongue-like Vulsella. Pl. 15, fig. 6.\r\n\r\nElongated, depressed, transversely striated; pale yellowish brown, with\r\nlongitudinal darker stripes.\r\n\r\n\r\n          4. Placuna. The Chinese Window Shell. Three species.\r\n\r\nThis genus received its common name from the thin, transparent nature of\r\nthe valves of the shell, particularly of the species _placenta_, which\r\nby the ingenious Chinese are often polished and used as a substitute for\r\nwindow-glass.\r\n\r\nThe hinge of the shells of this genus is so peculiar as to make it\r\nperfectly distinct; entirely interior, fastened by a ligament shaped\r\nlike a V on one of the valves.\r\n\r\nShell free, sub-irregular, very thin, almost entirely transparent, flat,\r\nsub-equivalve, sub-equilateral, slightly auricled; hinge entirely\r\ninternal, formed on the superior less valve by two elongated, unequal,\r\noblique ribs converging at the summit, to the interior side of which a\r\nligament like the letter V is inserted in two equally converging, rather\r\ndeep cavities of the lower valve, which is more convex; one rather\r\nsmall, sub-central muscular impression.\r\n\r\n_P. placenta._ The glassy Placuna. Pl. 16, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nSub-orbicular, flat, white, and transparent; finely striated\r\nlongitudinally, slightly decussated.\r\n\r\n\r\n               5. Anomia. The Antique Lamp. Six species.\r\n\r\nWhen Linnæus formed this genus and named it Anomia, he probably did so\r\nfrom its having no determinate character. Its common name was given it\r\nby the fancied resemblance of some of its species to an antique lamp.\r\nLike the oyster, they seldom leave their place; they are always affixed\r\nto marine bodies by an osseous operculum, formed by the thick extremity\r\nof the animal’s muscle. The lower valve is perforated and smaller,\r\nconforming to the shape of the substance to which it is affixed.\r\n\r\nShell adhering, irregular, inequivalve, inequilateral, ostraceous;\r\ninferior valve rather more flat than the superior, divided at the summit\r\ninto two sloping branches, whose approaching together forms a large oval\r\nhole, through which protrudes a muscle, the extremity of which becomes\r\nossified and adheres to extraneous bodies; one sub-central muscular\r\nimpression divided into three.\r\n\r\n                           Anomia ephippium.\r\n                           A. patellaris.\r\n                           A. cepa.\r\n                           A. electrica.\r\n                           A. pyriformis.\r\n                           A. fornicata.\r\n                           A. membranacea.\r\n                           A. squamula.\r\n                           A. lens.\r\n\r\n_A. ephippium._ The Saddle Anomia. Pl. 16, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nShell sub-orbicular, irregularly wrinkled and waved; upper valve convex,\r\nunder flat and perforated at the hinge, through which passes the\r\nligament by which it is affixed to other bodies; inside pearly, and of\r\nvarious changing colours, such as green, purple, violet, and yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   6. Crania. The Scull. One species.\r\n\r\nSo called from the appearance caused by three holes or cavities on the\r\nsurface of the lower valve.\r\n\r\nShell irregular, orbicular, inequivalve; the inferior valve almost flat,\r\nand marked on the interior with four muscular impressions, sometimes\r\nvery deep, and of which the two sub-central are sufficiently connected\r\nto form but one; the superior valve like a Patella, more or less convex,\r\nwith four very distinct muscular impressions, rather distant.\r\n\r\n_C. personata._ The masked Crania. Pl. 16, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nOrbicular; upper valve gibbous and conical, lower valve flat, with three\r\nperforations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY XX.\r\n                       BRACHIOPODA. Three genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       1. Orbicula. One species.\r\n\r\nGreatly resembling a Patella, for which it is often mistaken on account\r\nof the lower valve being very thin, flat, and adhering.\r\n\r\nShell sub-orbicular, very compressed, inequilateral, very inequivalve;\r\nthe inferior valve very thin, adherent, and imperforated; the superior\r\nvalve like a Patella, with a summit more or less inclined towards the\r\nposterior side.\r\n\r\n_O. Norwegica._ The Norwegian Orbicula. Pl. 17, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nUpper valve in the form of a depressed cone, with a summit produced and\r\npointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    2. Terebratula. Twelve species.\r\n\r\nTaken from the Anomia, and with great propriety, as its characteristic\r\ndifferences are very great; the perforation of the Anomia is always in\r\nthe smaller valve, which is attached to the larger by a cardinal\r\nligament, while in the Terebratula the perforation is always in the\r\nlarger valve, which is connected to the smaller by teeth at the hinge.\r\nIn some the valves are smooth, and in others grooved longitudinally.\r\n\r\nShell thin, equilateral, sub-triangular, inequivalve; one of the valves\r\nlarger and more convex than the other, prolonged behind by a sort of\r\nheel, sometimes recurved, and pierced by a round hole at its extremity;\r\nfrequently sloped more or less by a cleft of variable form; the opposite\r\nvalve smaller, more flat, sometimes formed like a lid, having in the\r\ninterior a system of support variable in form and complication in every\r\ntrue species; hinge limited, prominent, and formed by two articulating\r\nsurfaces of one valve placed between corresponding projections of the\r\nother; a kind of tendinous ligament issuing from the sloping cleft of\r\nthe shell, by which it is attached to marine bodies.\r\n\r\n                          Terebratula vitrea.\r\n                          T. dilatata.\r\n                          T. rotunda.\r\n                          T. flavescens.\r\n                          T. dentata.\r\n                          T. dorsata.\r\n                          T. pisum.\r\n                          T. globosa.\r\n                          T. sanguinea.\r\n                          T. caput-serpentis.\r\n                          T. truncata.\r\n                          T. psittacea.\r\n\r\n_T. dorsalis._ The dorsal Terebratula. Pl. 17, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe summit of the large valve pierced with a round hole, very\r\ncircumscribed; grooved longitudinally; valves as if cut sloping in the\r\nmiddle line.\r\n\r\n_T. globosa._ The globose Terebratula.\r\n\r\nSpecies smooth, with the valves rounded at their anterior edge.\r\n\r\n_T. caput serpentis._ The Serpent’s-head Terebratula.\r\n\r\nSpecies grooved, with the summit or heel of the large valve deeply\r\nhollowed even to the edge of the articulation; the slope rounded; the\r\nvalves sub-bilobate by the apparent slope of the anterior edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        3. Lingula. One species.\r\n\r\nThe valves of this genus are united by means of a tubular, fleshy, or\r\nmembranous peduncle surrounding the narrow part of them, and of which\r\nthe base is affixed to marine substances.\r\n\r\nShell covered with epidermis, sub-equivalve, equilateral, depressed,\r\nelongated, truncated anteriorly, summit middle and posterior, without\r\ntrace of ligament, but supported at the extremity of a long\r\nfibro-gelatinous peduncle, which attaches it vertically to sub-marine\r\nbodies; multiple muscular impression.\r\n\r\n_L. anatina._ The Duck’s-bill Lingula. Pl. 17, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nCovered with a green, shining epidermis, shaped like a duck’s bill, and\r\nhaving a cylindrical peduncle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CLASS IV.\r\n                               MOLLUSCA.\r\n                          TWENTY-TWO FAMILIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY I.\r\n                         PTEROPODA. Six genera\r\n\r\nSome genera of this family are without a testaceous covering, and are\r\nmentioned only for the sake of preserving the family entire.\r\n\r\n\r\n                1. Hyalæa. Venus’s Chariot. Two species.\r\n\r\nThis genus derives its common name from a fancied resemblance to a\r\nminiature triumphal car.\r\n\r\nShell very thin, transparent, symmetrical, convex below, flat above,\r\nvalves unequal, form tricuspidated, cleft at the sides, open like a\r\ncleft anteriorly, and tridentated posteriorly; summit truncated.\r\n\r\n                           Hyalæa tridentata.\r\n                           Hyalæa cuspidata.\r\n\r\n_H. tridentata._ The three-toothed Hyalæa.\r\n\r\nTransparent, horn-coloured, globular; tridentated posteriorly; summit\r\nand two posterior sides open; finely striated transversely.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  2.

Two species.\r\n\r\nShell gelatinous, cartilaginous, transparent, in shape of a reversed\r\npyramid or lanceolate truncated, only open at the summit.\r\n\r\n                          Cleodora pyramidata.\r\n                          Cleodora caudata.\r\n\r\n_C. pyramidata._ The pyramidal Cleodora.\r\n\r\nLike a pyramid, triangular, thin, transparent; aperture obliquely\r\ntruncated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       4. Limacina. One species.\r\n\r\nShell papyraceous, very fragile, planorbis form, sub-carinated,\r\ninvoluted rather obliquely, in such a manner as to be deeply and largely\r\numbilicated on one side, and the spine slightly projecting and pointed\r\non the other; aperture large, entire.\r\n\r\n_L. helicialis._ The Helix-like Limacina.\r\n\r\nThin, fragile, spiral; the volutions united in a discoid form.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 5.

Pneumodermon. Has no shell. One species.\r\n\r\n                              P. Peronii.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY II.\r\n                       PHYLLIDIACEA. Four genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      1. Phyllidia. Three species.\r\n\r\nThe animals of this genus are covered with a coriaceous skin, but\r\nwithout a shell.\r\n\r\n                          Phyllidia varicosa.\r\n                          P. pustulosa.\r\n                          P. ocellata.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      2. Chitonellus. Two species.\r\n\r\nFormerly classed with the Chiton; but as the testaceous plates of this\r\ngenus are never joined, the two may be easily distinguished.\r\n\r\nShell elongated, multivalve; alternate pieces generally longitudinal;\r\nsides naked.\r\n\r\n                        Chitonellus striatus.\r\n                        Chitonellus larvæformis.\r\n\r\n_C. striatus._ The striated Chitonellus.\r\n\r\nStriæ radiating from the apex of each valve; margin serrated; base of\r\nthe last valve obtuse.\r\n\r\n_C. larvæformis._ The Caterpillar Chitonellus.\r\n\r\nMore or less cylindrical, almost naked; the valves of the shell very\r\nsmall, and almost entirely concealed under the skin; tufts hairy or\r\nsilky between the parts of the valves near the margin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        3. Chiton. Six species.\r\n\r\nThis genus was so called from the resemblance of its testaceous covering\r\nto a coat of mail. The form of the Chiton is very similar to a\r\nwell-known insect called the woodlouse, found in decayed timber; it\r\ngenerally adheres to rocks, or lies rolled up like a ball among seaweed\r\nand stones. In length it seldom exceeds an inch, except in tropical\r\nclimates, where they are sometimes three or four inches long. In general\r\nthere are eight valves, the termination of which is surrounded by a\r\nscaly or rough ligament, which enables the animal to expand or contract\r\nits shell freely. It presents a great variety of colour; in general it\r\nis dark brown, overcast with a shade of green, but some are beautifully\r\nvariegated with pink, yellow, blue, or red; interior green or whitish.\r\n\r\nShell more or less elongated, consisting of a longitudinal series of\r\neight very symmetrical calcareous pieces, more or less curved, and round\r\nat both extremities; summit more or less marked, and when imbricated,\r\nalways from front to rear.\r\n\r\n                            Chiton gigas.\r\n                            C. squamosus.\r\n                            C. Peruvianus.\r\n                            C. spinosus.\r\n                            C. fascicularis.\r\n                            C. marginatus.\r\n\r\n_C. squamosus._ The scaly Chiton. Pl. 1, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nDepressed, valves large, carinated, well imbricated; the interstices\r\noffering well-marked lateral spaces; the border of the mantle regularly\r\nscaly.\r\n\r\n_C. marginatus._ The marginated Chiton. Pl. 1, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nValves carinated and projecting over each other; finely shagreened, with\r\na dusky reddish-brown margin.\r\n\r\n_C. fascicularis._ The fasciculated Chiton. Pl. 1, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nValves more narrow, imbricated, without distinct spaces; lateral parts\r\nof the skin naked or hairy, but always provided with silky or hairy\r\ntufts disposed in pairs between the junctions of the valve.\r\n\r\n_C. spinosus._ The spiny Chiton. Pl. 1, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nShell beset with long, thin, curved, tubular, hairy, blackish spines.\r\n\r\n\r\n     4. Patella. The Limpet or Dishlike Shell. Forty-five species.\r\n\r\nThe Patella of Linnæus was divided by Lamarck into several distinct\r\ngenera, and now comprehends only such shells as are of a conical form,\r\nwith an imperforated summit. The anterior is that part to which the\r\nsummit inclines, and is always more narrow than the posterior part.\r\n\r\nIt derives its name from its resemblance to a little dish; the colour\r\nand structure are various; some are smooth, others granulated, and many\r\nare covered with elevated tuberculated ribs. The exterior is sometimes\r\nof a pale fawn colour, and the interior of a bright pink; some have a\r\nsilvery hue, but the more general colour is bluish white or light brown.\r\n\r\nThis genus of shells is very numerous in all seas, but chiefly in hot\r\ncountries, where they are found of a larger size; they generally adhere\r\nby their base to rocks, stones, and marine substances, from which it is\r\ndifficult to detach them.\r\n\r\nShell oval or circular, sub-conic; summit right or more or less recurved\r\nanteriorly; the cavity simple, entire, more or less deep; the margin\r\ncomplete and entirely horizontal; a narrow muscular impression.\r\n\r\n                           Patella apicina.\r\n                           P. granatina.\r\n                           P. oculus.\r\n                           P. barbara.\r\n                           P. plicata.\r\n                           P. laciniosa.\r\n                           P. saccharina.\r\n                           P. angulosa.\r\n                           P. barbata.\r\n                           P. longicosta.\r\n                           P. spinifera.\r\n                           P. aspera.\r\n                           P. luteola.\r\n                           P. pyramidata.\r\n                           P. umbrella.\r\n                           P. plumbea.\r\n                           P. cærulea.\r\n                           P. radians.\r\n                           P. scutellaris.\r\n                           P. viridula.\r\n                           P. pectinata.\r\n                           P.

Seven genera.\r\n\r\nThe genera that constitute this family were separated by Lamarck from\r\nthe Patella of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n\r\n         1. Parmaphora. The Duck’s-bill Limpet. Three species.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic distinctions of this shell were first pointed out by\r\nDe Blainville.\r\n\r\nShell elongated, very depressed; the summit greatly post-medial, and\r\nevidently inclined behind; aperture as large as the shell; the lateral\r\nedges straight and parallel, the posterior rounded, the anterior sharp\r\nand notched in the middle; muscular impression large, elongated oval,\r\nslightly open in front.\r\n\r\n                         Parmophora Australis.\r\n                         P. brevicula.\r\n                         P. granulata.\r\n\r\n_P.

Emarginula. The Slit Limpet. Four species.\r\n\r\nMost of the shells of this genus are small; some are elevated, and\r\nothers of a widely-depressed conical form.\r\n\r\nShell conical, recurved; summit entire; slit, or more or less hollowed\r\non the anterior side; a muscular impression in form of a horseshoe, open\r\nbehind and thicker at the beginning.\r\n\r\n                        Emarginula Blainvillii.\r\n                        E. marginata.\r\n                        E. fissura.\r\n                        E. rubra.\r\n\r\n_E.

Pl. 32, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nOval, compressed, summit well marked, with reticulated striæ and ribs;\r\nfissure extending half way from the margin to the summit; exterior light\r\nbrown, interior white.\r\n\r\n_E. marginata._ The marginated Emarginula.\r\n\r\nMore compressed than the preceding; summit distinct, anterior margin\r\nformed like a gutter.\r\n\r\n\r\n          3. Fissurella. The Keyhole Limpet. Nineteen species.\r\n\r\nThe perforation not being perfectly round, but generally ovate oblong,\r\nprocured for this genus its common name, by which it is easily\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nShell simple, conical, depressed, recurved; summit perforated a little\r\nanterior in an oblong or oval manner, like a keyhole; the exterior\r\nsurface ribbed longitudinally, slightly striated transversely.\r\n\r\n                           Fissurella picta.\r\n                           F. nimbosa.\r\n                           F. crassa.\r\n                           F.

Græca._ The Greek Fissurella. Pl. 32, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nConical, ovate oblong; striæ cancellated and elevated; sections\r\ntuberculated; exterior yellowish brown or clouded, interior white or\r\nlight blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n            4. Pileopsis. The Caplike Limpet. Four species.\r\n\r\nEasily distinguished by its form, which gave rise to the common name.\r\n\r\nShell oblique, sharp pointed; cone bent forward, with a recurved, almost\r\nspiral summit, finely striated longitudinally and slightly wrinkled\r\ntransversely; aperture a round oval; the margin at the base nearly\r\nround, more or less regularly crenated and indented, interior with a\r\nlengthened, arched, transverse muscular impression.\r\n\r\n                          Pileopsis ungarica.\r\n                          P. mitrula.\r\n                          P. intorta.\r\n                          P. subrufa.\r\n\r\n_P. ungarica._ The Fool’s Cap.\r\n\r\nConical, vertex slightly spiral, pointed, and recurved; exterior pale\r\nfawn colour, and the outer margin bordered with a fringed epidermis;\r\ninterior sometimes of a very bright pink or rose colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n         5. Calyptræa. The Cup and Saucer Limpet. Four species.\r\n\r\nThis genus of shells is remarkable for having in the interior cavity a\r\ntransverse funnel or tongue-shaped testaceous appendage, from which\r\noriginated its common name.\r\n\r\nShell conic, base orbicular; summit vertical and imperforated; cavity\r\ndeep, having at its interior summit a tongue-like appendage. This\r\nappendage is sometimes vertical and sometimes like a horseshoe, having\r\non it a muscular impression of variable form.\r\n\r\n                        Calyptræa extinctorium.\r\n                        C. lævigata.\r\n                        C. equestris.\r\n                        C. tectum-sinense.\r\n\r\n_C. extinctorium._ The extinguisher Calyptræa.\r\n\r\nSpecies in which the internal appendage is horn-shaped; colour brownish.\r\n\r\n_C. equestris._ The equestrian Calyptræa.

Crepidula. The Slipper Limpet. Six species.\r\n\r\nVery similar to the Navicella, but distinguished from it by not having\r\nan operculum.\r\n\r\nShell irregular, form very variable, depressed or compressed; spire\r\nobliquely inclined to one side; margin entire; cavity large, divided by\r\na horizontal partition, which gives it the form of a half-decked boat.\r\n\r\n                          Crepidula fornicata.\r\n                          C. porcellana.\r\n                          C. aculeata.\r\n                          C. unguiformis.\r\n                          C. dilatata.\r\n                          C.

Two species.\r\n\r\nThis is a fresh-water shell, found in the lakes of Europe.\r\n\r\nShell thin and brittle, obliquely conical; summit pointed and recurved;\r\nmargins simple, base oval and smooth.\r\n\r\n                          Ancylus oblongus.\r\n                          Ancylus fluviatilis.\r\n\r\n_A. oblongus._ The oblong Ancylus.\r\n\r\nAperture elongated, vertex turned to one side, striated concentrically;\r\nexterior pale yellowish colour, interior light blue.\r\n\r\n_A. fluviatilis._ The river Ancylus. Pl. 32, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nSimple, oval, almost symmetrical; summit pointed, compressed, very\r\ndistinct; bent back a little to the right, but not marginal; the edges\r\nof the aperture entire and effuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY IV.\r\n                        BULLACEA. Three genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  1. Acera. Has no shell. One species.\r\n\r\n                             Acera Carnosa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        2. Bullæa. One species.\r\n\r\nFormerly classed with the Bulla, but separated from it on account of the\r\nshell being entirely covered by the animal, and never externally\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nShell oval, thin, fragile, more or less involuted on one side, rendering\r\nthe aperture more or less wide.\r\n\r\n_B. aperta._ The open Bullæa. Pl. 17, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nShell interior and very incompletely involuted, without spire or\r\ncolumella; sub-orbicular, white, transparent, faintly striated, and\r\nslightly wrinkled; almost entirely open.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 3. Bulla. The Bubble. Eleven species.\r\n\r\nThe great confusion that existed in this genus, as classed by Linnæus,\r\nhas been elucidated by the division and classification of Lamarck. This\r\ngenus derived its name from the resemblance which some of the smaller\r\nspecies have to a bubble of water. Its shells are found in almost all\r\nparts of the world.\r\n\r\nShell external, oval, involuted; aperture very large, open the whole\r\nlength of the shell, and generally wider at the base; outer edge sharp\r\nand smooth; summit umbilicated.\r\n\r\n                            Bulla lignaria.\r\n                            B. ampulla.\r\n                            B. striata.\r\n                            B. naucum.\r\n                            B. physis.\r\n                            B. fasciata.\r\n                            B. aplustre.\r\n                            B. hydatis.\r\n                            B. cornea.\r\n                            B. fragilis.\r\n                            B. solida.\r\n\r\n_B. aplustre._ The streamer-like Bulla. Pl. 17, fig. 7.\r\n\r\nSpecies completely involute; the spire very distinct, visible, but not\r\nprojecting, with a kind of thickening at the anterior part of the\r\ncolumellar edge.\r\n\r\n_B. lignaria._ The woodlike Bulla.\r\n\r\nSpecies sub-involute, no visible spire either within or without, but\r\nnarrowed towards the top when it is slightly umbilicated; yellowish\r\nbrown colour, with transverse pale striæ.\r\n\r\n_B. hydatis._ The watery Bulla.\r\n\r\nSpecies more solid, thicker, almost entirely involute; whorls of the\r\nspire slightly visible in an umbilicus projecting interiorly from the\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\n_B. naucum._ The sea-nut Bulla.\r\n\r\nSpecies thin; the whorls of the spire visible externally, but without\r\nprojection, and with a suture as if caniculated without thickening at\r\nthe anterior part of the columellar edge.\r\n\r\n_B. fragilis._ The fragile Bulla.\r\n\r\nSpecies very thin, rather involute; the whorls of the spire distinct\r\nwithin as without; the suture deep, angular, and cleft in a greater or\r\nless part of its length.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY V.\r\n                        APLYSIACEA. Two genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       1. Aplysia. Three species.\r\n\r\nThis genus may almost be said to have no testaceous covering, as it\r\nappears more like the element of a shell.\r\n\r\n                           Aplysia depilans.\r\n                           A. fasciata.\r\n                           A. punctata.\r\n\r\n_A. depilans._ The bald Aplysia.\r\n\r\nShell dorsal, semicircular, of a thin yellow cartilaginous substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       2. Dolabella. Two species.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the Aplysia; it is a singularly formed shell,\r\ndifficult to describe, as it contains few of the characteristics which\r\ndistinguish other shells.\r\n\r\nShell rudimentary, entirely flat, sub-spiral, with a summit thick and\r\nvery callous.\r\n\r\n                          Dolabella Rumphii.\r\n                          Dolabella fragilis.\r\n\r\n_D. Rumphii._ Rumphius’s Dolabella.\r\n\r\nBase thick, callous, and sub-spiral; dilated above, thin, and\r\nwedge-shaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY VI.\r\n                        LIMACINEA. Five genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                1. Onchidium. Has no shell.

One species.\r\n\r\nLamarck has given a description of the animal of this genus, but only\r\nmentions that the scutcheon contains a shell or solid crustaceous body.\r\n\r\n                          Parmacella Olivieri.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        3. Limax. Four species.\r\n\r\nThe animal belonging to this genus is furnished with a coriaceous\r\nshield, wrinkled.\r\n\r\n                              Limax rufus.\r\n                              L. albus.\r\n                              L. cinerus.\r\n                              L. agrestis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      4. Testacella. One species.\r\n\r\nShell external, very small, ear-shaped; very depressed, summit inclined\r\nposteriorly, not spiral; aperture oval, very large; the left edge sharp,\r\na little rolled inward, especially behind.\r\n\r\n_T. Haliotidea._ The Haliotis-shaped Testacella. Pl. 17, fig. 6.\r\n\r\nAnswering to the above description; very thin, transparent, and\r\nyellowish.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        5. Vitrina. One species.\r\n\r\nShell proportionally very small, extremely thin, pellucid, almost\r\nmembranous, oval or sub-globular; spire very short, of which the last\r\nwhorl is very large; aperture large, semilunar; the edges sharp; the\r\nleft edge arched, and extending itself interiorly to the summit.\r\n\r\n_V. pellucida._ The pellucid Vitrina. Pl. 17, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nExtremely thin, pellucid, and glossy; depressed, spire very short;\r\naperture large and oval; colour pale yellowish green.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FAMILY VII.\r\n                       COLIMACEA. Eleven genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n          1. Helix. The Snail. One hundred and seven species.\r\n\r\nAccording to the systematic arrangement of Lamarck, this genus now\r\nconsists of shells with peculiar characteristic distinctions.\r\n\r\nBy Linnæus, marine, land, and fresh-water shells were united in this\r\ngenus, and so confounded that the naturalist would often look in vain\r\nfor the distinguishing characters which would enable him to class and\r\ndetermine the genus of the object under examination.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the divisions of Lamarck, its species are numerous; the\r\nshells are terrestrial, and found in all parts of the globe; some are\r\nrare and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe term Helix was given to this genus from the spiral form of the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nShell extremely variable in form, generally globular, sometimes\r\nventricose, conoid, never turriculated; summit constantly obtuse and\r\nrounded; aperture generally of a medium size, but sometimes very large\r\nor very small, always modified by the turn of the spire; oval,\r\nsemilunar, more wide than long, edges disunited, entering but very\r\nlittle into the formation of the interior; the right lip or margin\r\nthickened or reflected.\r\n\r\n                          Helix vesicalis.\r\n                          H. algira.\r\n                          H. pomatia.\r\n                          H. aspersa.\r\n                          H. vermiculata.\r\n                          H. alonensis.\r\n                          H. lineolata.\r\n                          H. picta.\r\n                          H. mutata.\r\n                          H. gigantea.\r\n                          H. polyzonalis.\r\n                          H. monozonalis.\r\n                          H. pulla.\r\n                          H. versicolor.\r\n                          H.

Fifteen species.\r\n\r\nThis genus is very beautiful, and derived its common name from its\r\nresemblance to the human ear. The exterior is generally tuberculated and\r\nloaded with marine substances, which gives it a rough and uncouth\r\nappearance, but the interior forms a splendid contrast by its natural\r\niridescence. Each shell is furnished with a row of orifices near the\r\nmargin, varying in number from eight upward; of these from three to\r\nseven are generally open, and the others close. These holes are made by\r\nthe animal as it increases the size of the shell, to admit the passage\r\nof a short syphon.\r\n\r\nThey are found adhering to rocks like the Patella, and are detached with\r\ngreat difficulty.\r\n\r\nShell ear-shaped, pearly, recurving, very depressed, more or less oval,\r\nwith spire very small, very low, almost posterior and lateral; aperture\r\nas large as the shell, with margins continued; the right thin and sharp,\r\nthe left flat, enlarged, and sharp; a series of holes, complete or\r\nincomplete, parallel to the left margin; one large oval muscular\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\n                            Haliotis Midæ.\r\n                            H. iris.\r\n                            H. tubifera.\r\n                            H. excavata.\r\n                            H.

Five species.\r\n\r\nShell smooth, not covered with epidermis, conical, elongated or\r\nsub-turriculated; aperture semi-oval, entire; the outer lip sharp,\r\ndentated interiorly, plaited, enlarged over the umbilicus, which it\r\nleaves more or less exposed.\r\n\r\n                        Pyramidella terebellum.\r\n                        P. dolabrata.\r\n                        P. plicata.\r\n                        P. corrugata.\r\n                        P. maculosa.\r\n\r\n_P. dolabrata._ The dentated Pyramidella. Pl. 22, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nAnswers to the above description; when placed on its base, it falls on\r\none side.\r\n\r\n_P. terebellum._ The wimble Pyramidella.\r\n\r\nSmooth, glossy, white, with reddish-brown bands; columella recurved;\r\ninside of the lip smooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FAMILY XIV.\r\n                       SCALARIDES. Three genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       1. Vermetus. One species.\r\n\r\nResembling in appearance the shell of a Serpula; but the organization of\r\nthe animal caused this to be made a distinct genus.\r\n\r\nIts shells are usually found grouped together or intertwined with each\r\nother, and are very remarkable for being attached to marine bodies by\r\nthe attenuated and pointed extremity of the spire.\r\n\r\nShell conical, tubular, thin, involute spirally, more or less close,\r\nwith whorls almost completely disunited; free or adherent by\r\nintertwining; aperture straight, circular, with edges sharp and\r\ncomplete; several partitions not perforated towards the summit;\r\noperculum horny and complete.\r\n\r\n_V. lumbricales._ The wormlike Vermetus. Pl. 23, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nA flexuous shell, with a spiral, acute tip, very much resembling a\r\ncorkscrew; colour reddish brown, sometimes clouded with a darker shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      2. Scalaria. Seven species.\r\n\r\nA marine shell, with a circular aperture like the Cyclostoma, but easily\r\ndistinguished by its turreted form; longitudinal, elevated ribs, never\r\nconnected together, rather oblique, and sharp; the shape of the shell is\r\nelegant, being a spiral cone, formed by gibbous whorls, unconnected by a\r\ncolumella, gradually increasing from the apex to the base. The colour is\r\ngenerally yellowish or brownish white. When perfect and of good size,\r\nthey are of great value and highly prized.\r\n\r\nShell sub-turreted, the whorls of the spire more or less pressed and\r\ngarnished with interrupted longitudinal ribs, formed by the successive\r\npreservation of the reflected margin of the aperture, which is small,\r\nperfectly round, with edges united, thickened, and outwardly reflected;\r\noperculum horny and thin.\r\n\r\n                           Scalaria pretiosa.\r\n                           S. lamellosa.\r\n                           S. coronata.\r\n                           S. varicosa.\r\n                           S. communis.\r\n                           S. Australis.\r\n                           S. raricosta.\r\n\r\n_S. pretiosa._ The precious Scalaria, more commonly called the Wentle\r\nTrap, or Winding Staircase. Pl. 23, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThis shell has its spiral whorls separate, and appears like an\r\nattenuated tube evolved round a cone; spire detached, with a deep\r\numbilicus; volutions connected by longitudinal ribs; body extremely\r\nventricose; colour cream yellow.\r\n\r\n_S. communis._ The common Scalaria, or false Wentle Trap.\r\n\r\nMore taper and elongated than the S. pretiosa. It has no umbilicus, and\r\nthe whorls are closely united.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     3. Delphinula. Three species.\r\n\r\nA marine shell, which, like the Scalaria, has a round aperture, but its\r\nsolidity and pearly substance distinguishes it from the Cyclostoma,\r\nwhich is terrestrial.\r\n\r\nShell thick, pearly in the interior, sub-discoid or conical; the spiral\r\nwhorls sometimes detached, rounded, spiny, with a large umbilicus;\r\naperture round or multrigonal, not modified; edges perfectly united with\r\na small spire, tuberculated exteriorly.\r\n\r\n                         Delphinula laciniata.\r\n                         D. distorta.\r\n                         D. turbinopsis.\r\n\r\n_D. laciniata._ The fringed Delphinula. Pl. 23, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nShell depressed, umbilicus large, surrounded by large vaulted scales in\r\nspiral rows; strong waved spiral striæ; colour reddish purple,\r\nvariegated with white.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FAMILY XV.\r\n                       TURBINACEA. Seven genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      1. Solarium. Seven species.\r\n\r\nSome shells of this genus are highly valued for their beauty and rarity.\r\n\r\nShell orbicular, involuted almost in the same plane; Planorbis-shaped;\r\nthe spire of the right side very depressed; umbilicus large and conical,\r\nwith edges denticulated or not at the entrance; aperture not modified by\r\nthe last whorl of the spire, which is entirely flat; no columella.\r\n\r\n                         Solarium perspectivum.\r\n                         S. granulatum.\r\n                         S. lævigatum.\r\n                         S. stramineum.\r\n                         S. hybridum.\r\n                         S. variegatum.\r\n                         S. luteum.\r\n\r\n_S. perspectivum._ The perspective Solarium. Pl. 23, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nSpecies very carinated in their circumference; the aperture square;\r\numbilicus large and crenated; colour yellowish, with brown and white\r\nbands on the sutures of the volutions.\r\n\r\n_S. variegatum._ The variegated Solarium.\r\n\r\nSpecies sub-carinated, aperture sub-orbicular.\r\n\r\n\r\n             2. Trochus. The Top Shell. Sixty-nine species.\r\n\r\nThis genus derived its name from its resemblance to a top.\r\n\r\nThe shells are marine, found in almost all parts of the world; some are\r\nsmooth, but the greater number are covered, with knobs, spines,\r\ntuberculations, or undulations.\r\n\r\nThe long spines on the margin of the T. Solaris are placed at regular\r\ndistances, and resemble the rays of the sun. Many, when decorticated,\r\nlook like mother-of-pearl; others have a splendid metallic lustre. The\r\nT. agglutinans possesses the faculty of covering itself with extraneous\r\nsubstances, such as stones, corals, fragments of shells, &c. Of this\r\nspecies there are two kinds, which, though conchologically known only by\r\none name, are familiarly known by two; the Conchologist and the\r\nMineralogist; the former so called from being loaded with shells, and\r\nthe latter with stones, &c. Sometimes the Conchologist is loaded with\r\ncorals only, and then is called the Zoologist.\r\n\r\nShell thick, generally pearly, shaped like a top, spire sometimes\r\ndepressed, sometimes elevated and pointed at the summit, sharp or\r\ncarinated at its circumference, umbilicated or not; aperture depressed,\r\nangular or sub-angular, sometimes heart-shaped, with edges disunited;\r\nthe right sharp; the columella arched, twisted, and often projecting\r\nforward; operculum horny, thin, with numerous spiral whorls, narrow, and\r\nincreasing a little from the centre to the circumference.\r\n\r\n                          Trochus imperialis.\r\n                          T. longispina.\r\n                          T. solaris.\r\n                          T.

Pl. 23, fig. 6.\r\n\r\nSpecies umbilicated, spire very depressed, sharp and radiated at their\r\ncircumference by the preservation of an angular canal from the middle of\r\nthe right margin. This species is rare and beautiful, found in\r\nNew-Zealand.\r\n\r\n_T. zizyphinus._ The livid Trochus.\r\n\r\nSpecies with strong transverse striæ; colour livid, with undulated\r\nstreaks of red or brownish carnation.\r\n\r\n_T. agglutinans._ The agglutinating or Carrier Trochus.\r\n\r\nSpecies umbilicated, with spire very depressed; the base much enlarged,\r\nand as if excavated by the large projection of the angle of the right\r\nedge, which advances much beyond the rounded columellar edge; generally\r\ncovered with shells, stones, or coral.\r\n\r\n_T. niloticus._ The large marble Trochus.\r\n\r\nSpecies not umbilicated, conical, with base flat and circular; the\r\ncolumella twisted; the aperture very angular.\r\n\r\n_T. obeliscus._ The obelisk Trochus.\r\n\r\nSpecies not umbilicated, conic, elevated, flat and circular base; the\r\ntermination of the columella strongly twisted, but passing down by the\r\nmargin, appearing sloped by the advance of an internal longitudinal\r\nplait.\r\n\r\n_T. iris._ The iris Trochus.\r\n\r\nSpecies not umbilicated, conic, base oblique; aperture large, slightly\r\nangular; the columella twisted, and forming a kind of tooth at its\r\ntermination.\r\n\r\n_T. granulatus._ The granulated Trochus.\r\n\r\nConic, imperforate at the base, spirally granulated and not marginated\r\nat the edges of the volutions; body swelling out; spire tapering\r\nabruptly; apex acute, flesh-coloured.\r\n\r\n_T. umbilicaris._ The umbilicated Trochus.\r\n\r\nShell conico-convex, rather flat, rounded at the top; apex depressed,\r\nvolutions sub-marginate; striated spirally; aperture compressed and\r\nangular; umbilicus large, extending to the apex; colour whitish.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  3. Monodonta. Twenty-three species.\r\n\r\nThis genus occupies an intermediate space between the Trochus and the\r\nTurbo; distinguished from the former by the aperture being more round\r\nand slightly depressed, and from the latter by the toothlike projecting\r\nangle which the truncated columella occasions at the base of the\r\naperture.\r\n\r\nShell ovate or conoid, aperture round and entire, with an operculum;\r\nouter lip disunited from the body at the top; columella arched and\r\ntruncated at the base.\r\n\r\n                          Monodonta bicolor.\r\n                          M. pagodus.\r\n                          M. tectum Persicum.\r\n                          M. papillosa.\r\n                          M. coronaria.\r\n                          M.

Pl. 23, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nSpecies sub-globular, umbilicated, spiral whorls rounded; the columella\r\nterminated by a tooth.\r\n\r\n_M. fragarioides._ The strawberry-shaped Monodonta.\r\n\r\nSpecies more or less globular, of which the columella, almost straight,\r\noffers but a little obstacle to its junction with the margin.\r\n\r\n\r\n            4. Turbo. The Turban Shell. Thirty-four species.\r\n\r\nDistinguished from the Monodonta by never having the columella truncated\r\nat the base; and from the Trochus by being solid, with the whorls\r\nconstantly convex and never flattened.

Struthiolaria. Two species.\r\n\r\nThe shells of this genus are marine, inhabited by mollusca, that, by\r\nfrequently moving in and out of the shell while wandering on the shore\r\nin search of food, produce singular callosities on the two edges of the\r\naperture. They generally resemble the Murex and Buccinum, but are\r\ndistinguished by a thickened marginal lip on the right side.\r\n\r\nShell ovate, spire produced; aperture sinuous, terminated at the base by\r\na very short canal; straight, and without a notch; columellar edge\r\ncallous and effuse; right edge with a thickened varix.\r\n\r\n                        Struthiolaria nodulosa.\r\n                        Struthiolaria crenulata.\r\n\r\n_S. nodulosa._ The nodulous Struthiolaria.

Ranella. Fourteen species.\r\n\r\nThis genus of shells has two rows of varices or thickened bands,\r\narranged on either side in rows, so that it forms a distinct division\r\nbetween the Struthiolaria and the Murex.\r\n\r\nShell oval, as if depressed by the preservation of each side of a\r\nlongitudinal thickened band; aperture oval, almost symmetrical by the\r\nexcavation of the columellar edge, terminating anteriorly by a short\r\ncanal, often a little sloping; a sinus at the posterior junction of the\r\ntwo edges.\r\n\r\n                           Ranella gigantea.\r\n                           R. leucostoma.\r\n                           R. candisata.\r\n                           R.

Murex. The Trumpet Shell. Sixty-six species.\r\n\r\nThough so greatly divided by Lamarck, this is a beautiful and numerous\r\ngenus, comprehending only such shells as have three or more varices on\r\neach whorl.\r\n\r\nThese varices show the number of times the animal has increased the size\r\nof its shell, and what proportion is added at each increase.\r\n\r\nThe shells are generally irregular in form, arising from their surfaces\r\nbeing usually armed with spines, knobs, striæ, or foliations.\r\n\r\nShell generally oval; the spire always but little elevated, armed with\r\nlongitudinal transverse varices or thickened bands; aperture small; very\r\noval and symmetrical by the excavation of the left edge, formed by a\r\nplate applied on the columella, terminated anteriorly by a middling\r\nsized canal, sometimes very long and close; the right edge more or less\r\nadorned with varices; operculum horny, oval, complete, almost circular,\r\nwith sub-concentric partitions; summit terminal.\r\n\r\n                           Murex crassispina.\r\n                           M.

Three genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     1. Rostellaria. Three species.\r\n\r\nLamarck formed this genus from the Strombus of Linnæus on account of\r\nhaving a sinus in the lower part of the right margin contiguous to the\r\ncanal. The beak is generally curved, and short in comparison to the\r\nlength of the spire, but sometimes it is straight, and equal in length\r\nto the other part of the shell.\r\n\r\nThe R. rectirostris is one of the most rare shells known.\r\n\r\nShell sub-depressed, turreted, with spire produced and pointed; aperture\r\noval by the excavation of the columellar edge; the right margin dilating\r\nby age, and having a sinus contiguous to the pointed canal which\r\nterminates the shell.\r\n\r\n                       Rostellaria curvirostris.\r\n                       R. rectirostris.\r\n                       R. pes-Pelicani.\r\n\r\n_R. curvirostris._ The curved beak Rostellaria.

Pteroceras. Seven species.\r\n\r\nFormed from the Strombus, being distinct from it by not having the canal\r\nat the base shortened or truncated. It greatly resembles the\r\nRostellaria, but the sinus of the right margin is distant from the body.\r\nFrom its digitation or long recurved claws it has often been called the\r\nSpider Shell.\r\n\r\nShell oblong-ovate, ventricose, canal elongated, attenuated, and often\r\nclosed; right margin dilating by age into an expanded, digitated wing,\r\nattached to and covering a short spire, with a sinus in the lower part\r\nnot contiguous to the body.\r\n\r\n                          Pteroceras truncata.\r\n                          P. lambis.\r\n                          P. millepeda.\r\n                          P. pseudoscorpio.\r\n                          P. scorpio.\r\n                          P. aurantia.\r\n                          P. chiragra.\r\n\r\n_P. chiragra._ The Devil’s Claw.

Strombus. The Wing Shell. Thirty-two species.\r\n\r\nAs now defined and characterized by Lamarck, is easily distinguished by\r\nnot having the winged aperture on the right side dentated or digitated,\r\nand the sinus therein always separated from the canal.\r\n\r\nIn some species the exterior is variously striated, smooth, wrinkled\r\nlongitudinally, or tuberculated; the interior presents vivid and\r\nbeautiful colours.\r\n\r\nThese shells frequently attain a large size and great solidity.\r\n\r\nShell thick, sub-involute, diconic, or ventricose, terminated like a\r\ncone before and behind; aperture very long, narrow, terminated\r\nanteriorly by a canal more or less elongated, recurved; the edges\r\nparallel; the external dilating with age, offering behind a gutter at\r\nits attachment to the spire, and before a sinus more posterior than the\r\ncanal, through which passes the head of the animal; operculum horny,\r\nlong, and narrow, with elements as if imbricated; the summit terminal.\r\n\r\n                           Strombus gigas.\r\n                           S. accipitrinus.\r\n                           S. latissimus.\r\n                           S. tricornis.\r\n                           S.

Monoceros. The Unicorn. Five species.\r\n\r\nDerived its name from the long, conical-pointed, somewhat recurved tooth\r\nin the outer lip, by which alone it can well be distinguished from the\r\nPurpura; and with this characteristic difference the description of the\r\nshell of the Purpura will answer for this genus.\r\n\r\n                         Monoceros cingulatum.\r\n                         M. imbricatum.\r\n                         M. striatum.\r\n                         M. glabratum.\r\n                         M. crassilabrum.\r\n\r\n_M. cingulatum._ The belted Monoceras.\r\n\r\nCylindrical, columella not smooth, but irregularly plaited or wrinkled,\r\nand the tooth does not extend within the interior of the whorls as in\r\nthe other species, but appears affixed only to the edge of the lip;\r\nvolutions flattened in their upper edges; transverse spiral brown bands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      6. Concholepas. One species.\r\n\r\nFormerly considered a Patella, but distinct from it on account of having\r\nan operculum. It is particularly distinguished by having two teeth at\r\nthe base of the right side.\r\n\r\nShell wide, rough, oval, spire very short, not projecting; aperture very\r\nlarge, oval, effuse, sloped anteriorly; the edges united; the right or\r\nexternal very thick, dentated; the two teeth which limit the slope are a\r\nlittle larger than the others; muscular impression visible, and almost\r\nin form of a horseshoe; operculum horny and rudimentary.\r\n\r\n_C.

Pl. 29, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nA regular species.\r\n\r\n_H. rosea._ The roseate Harp.\r\n\r\nOblong-ovate; flesh coloured, with roseate interrupted bands; ribs\r\nremote; columella of a fine rosy hue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                8. Dolium. The Tun Shell. Seven species.\r\n\r\nThe shells of this genus are generally large, thin, and globose, with a\r\nwide aperture, and toothed or crenated outer lip; they have a brittle\r\nand light structure, and although some of them grow to a very large\r\nsize, they retain their characteristic fragility and thinness.\r\n\r\nShell sub-globular, very ventricose, thin, encircled by decurrent\r\nflutings; the spire very short; the last turn much larger than all the\r\nothers together; aperture oblong, very large, by the great excavation of\r\nthe right edge, which is crenated through all its length; columella\r\ntwisted; operculum unknown.\r\n\r\n                             Dolium galea.\r\n                             D. olearium.\r\n                             D. maculatum.\r\n                             D. fasciatum.\r\n                             D. pomum.\r\n                             D. variegatum.\r\n                             D. perdix.\r\n\r\n_D. perdix._ The Partridge Dolium.

Buccinum. The Whelk. Fifty-eight species.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the divisions of the Linnæan Buccinum into so many\r\ndifferent genera, it still presents a great variety and diversity of\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nShell slightly covered with epidermis, oval, elongated; the spire\r\nmiddling elevated; aperture oblong, oval, notched, and sometimes\r\nsub-canaliculated anteriorly; the right edge thick, not reflected;\r\ncolumella simple and swelled at the upper part; operculum horny,\r\ncomplete, oval, with sub-concentric elements; the summit slightly marked\r\nand marginal.\r\n\r\n                          Buccinum undatum.\r\n                          B. glaciale.\r\n                          B.

The Egg. 12 species.\r\n\r\nThis is the first genus of Lamarck’s arrangement of convoluted shells;\r\nit is nearly allied to the Cypræa, but easily distinguished from it by\r\nthe want of spire, and by not having teeth on the columellar lip; the\r\nright lip is reflected inwardly, sometimes wrinkled and sometimes\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\nShell oblong, convex, resembling the Cypræa in form, with the two\r\nextremities of the aperture notched, and more or less prolonged like a\r\ntube; the left margin dentated.\r\n\r\n                            Ovula oviformis.\r\n                            O. angulosa.\r\n                            O. verrucosa.\r\n                            O. hordacea.\r\n                            O. spelta.\r\n                            O. birostris.\r\n                            O. lactea.\r\n                            O. carnea.\r\n                            O. triticea.\r\n                            O. gibbosa.\r\n                            O. acicularis.\r\n                            O. volva.\r\n\r\n_O. volva._ The Weaver’s Shuttle. Pl. 34, fig. 4.\r\n\r\nSpecies in which the right edge is not thickened or dentated, and with\r\neach extremity elongated, producing a long, straight tube, which\r\nincreases with age. One of the most rare shells of this genus.\r\n\r\n_O. oviformis._ The egg-shaped Ovula. Pl. 34, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nSpecies ovate, much inflated, ventricose in the centre, very glossy and\r\nwhite; right edge dentated, the tube of each extremity very prominent;\r\ninterior of aperture reddish purple.\r\n\r\n_O. gibbosa._ The belted Ovula. Pl. 34, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nSpecies gibbous, neither end dentated; tubes little marked, and with the\r\nbody of the shell encircled by a blunt keel.\r\n\r\n_O. verrucosa._ The warty Ovula. Pl. 34, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nSpecies in which the right end is dentated, with a notch and a knob\r\nabove at each extremity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   2. Cypræa. The Cowrie. 68 species.\r\n\r\nThis genus derived its name from the Cyprian goddess, on account of the\r\nbeauty of its polished shells. They are generally smooth, of great\r\nbrilliancy of colour, and elegantly marked with dots, zigzag lines,\r\nundulations, or stripes, and covered with an enamel-like glaze. They are\r\nfound buried in the sand at the bottom of the sea, and are covered by\r\nthe animal with a thin membrane, which preserves the polish and prevents\r\nother testaceous bodies from adhering to them. This membrane consists of\r\ntwo parts, and arises on both sides of the shell in the form of wings,\r\nfurnishing the testaceous and colouring matter; in some species they do\r\nnot quite meet on the back of the shell, and the uncovered space is\r\nmarked by a coloured dorsal line; when these membranous wings overlap\r\neach other, this line is nearly obsolete.\r\n\r\nThese shells often differ much with age; at first in thickness, then\r\nbecause the edges are thin, sharp, hardly dentated, unless internally;\r\nand, lastly, sometimes in the outline; this is because the two lobes of\r\nthe mantle, by turning over the primitive shell during the creeping of\r\nthe animal, deposite new calcareous matter. De Blainville cannot admit\r\nthe hypothesis of Bruguiere, that these animals can completely abandon\r\ntheir shell to form a new one.\r\n\r\nShell, when full grown and mature, is solid, oval, convex, very smooth,\r\ninvolute; the spire entirely posterior, very small, often concealed by a\r\ncalcareous layer deposited by the lobes of the mantle, leaving in some\r\nspecies a small cavity like an umbilicus; aperture longitudinal, very\r\nnarrow, slightly curved, as long as the shell, with edges internally\r\ndentated, and notched at each extremity.\r\n\r\nShell, when young and immature, is very thin, the edges of the aperture\r\nnot dentated; the right margin sharp and not reflected.\r\n\r\n                          Cypræa cerina.\r\n                          C. exanthema.\r\n                          C. tigris.\r\n                          C. tigrina.\r\n                          C.

Four species.\r\n\r\nAn intermediate genus between the Terebellum and the Oliva;\r\ndistinguished from the former by a callous oblique band at the base of\r\nthe columella; and from the latter by not having the spiral whorls\r\nseparated by a groove.\r\n\r\nShell smooth, oval, oblong, pointed behind, enlarged and truncated\r\nbefore; the columella covered anteriorly by a callous oblique band; the\r\nright lip obtuse.\r\n\r\n                         Ancillaria cinnamomea.\r\n                         A. ventricosa.\r\n                         A. marginata.\r\n                         A. candida.\r\n\r\n_A. cinnamomea._ The cinnamon Ancillaria. Pl. 30, fig. 5.\r\n\r\nSpecies with spire nearly obsolete; shell chestnut colour, with white\r\nbands; varix of the columella reddish and somewhat striated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                5. Oliva. The Olive. Sixty-two species.\r\n\r\nAn oval, involuted, internal shell, distinguished from the Ancillaria by\r\na narrow canal continued from its upper angle around the sutures of the\r\nspiral whorls. It was formerly classed with the Voluta, which genus has\r\nnot the canal, so that they cannot be mistaken for each other. There is\r\na callosity uniting with the spiral canal, and another at the base of\r\nthe columella.\r\n\r\nShell thick, solid, smooth, oval, elongated, sub-cylindrical; the spiral\r\nwhorls very small, separated by a canal; aperture long, narrow; the\r\ncolumellar edge reflected anteriorly by a callosity, and striated\r\nobliquely through all its length. The shells are generally clouded or\r\ncovered with waved lines of a brownish colour, more or less dark.\r\n\r\n                           Oliva porphyria.\r\n                           O. textilina.\r\n                           O. erythrostoma.\r\n                           O. pica.\r\n                           O. tremulina.\r\n                           O. angulata.\r\n                           O. maura.\r\n                           O. sepulturalis.\r\n                           O. fulminans.\r\n                           O. irisans.\r\n                           O. elegans.\r\n                           O. episcopalis.\r\n                           O. venulata.\r\n                           O. guttata.\r\n                           O. leucophæa.\r\n                           O. undata.\r\n                           O. inflata.\r\n                           O. bicincta.\r\n                           O. harpularia.\r\n                           O. hepatica.\r\n                           O. ustulata.\r\n                           O. avellana.\r\n                           O. tessellata.\r\n                           O. carneola.\r\n                           O. espidula.\r\n                           O. oriola.\r\n                           O. candida.\r\n                           O. volutella.\r\n                           O. tigrina.\r\n                           O.

Two genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        1. Spirula. One species.\r\n\r\nAn involute, symmetrical, discoid shell, whose whorls do not touch each\r\nother; the septa or partitions are brilliant pearl, concave externally,\r\npierced by a tube called the siphon or siphuncle, placed close to the\r\ninner edge of the aperture; covered with a thin epidermis.\r\n\r\n_S. Peronii._ Peron’s Spirula. Pl. 36, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nAnswers to the above description; colour yellowish white.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       2. Nautilus. Two species.\r\n\r\nAn elegant, well-known shell, more or less ventricose, discoid, slightly\r\ncompressed, umbilicated or not, but never papillose; the septa simple,\r\ntransverse, not visible externally, the last deeply sunk and perforated\r\nby a siphon running through them all; edges entire.\r\n\r\nThe N. Pompilius, when dissected, displays its beautiful pearly\r\nchambers; fine specimens are often converted into drinking-cups by the\r\nOrientals, who sometimes remove the outer coating, so that its whole\r\nappearance is pearly.\r\n\r\nThe Nautilis varies in size; some are microscopic; and although they\r\nhave received different names, and on account of the animal have been\r\nmade to form different genera, it was deemed unnecessary to treat of\r\nthem here.\r\n\r\n                         Nautilus Pompilius.\r\n                         Nautilus umbilicatus.\r\n\r\n_N.

Pl. 36, fig. 3.\r\n\r\nSpecies not umbilicated; the back rounded; aperture round and pearly;\r\nsiphon sub-central; pale yellow, with chestnut streaks and undulations.\r\n\r\n_N. umbilicatus._ The umbilicated Pompilius. Pl. 36, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nSpecies umbilicated, sub-orbicular; pale fawn colour, with chestnut\r\nundated transverse clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FAMILY XXII.\r\n                        HETEROPODA. Two genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n             1. Argonauta. The Paper Sailor. Three species.\r\n\r\nThe shells of this genus are remarkable for their fragility, delicacy,\r\nand elegance; they resemble a scroll, ornamented with various\r\ncanaliculated grooves from the summit to the margin, which is\r\nbicarinated. The colour is usually bluish, but the keel is of a darker\r\nhue; they vary greatly in size.\r\n\r\nShell navicular, symmetrical, very thin, compressed, bicarinated,\r\nsub-involuted longitudinally in the same plane; aperture very large,\r\nentire, symmetrical, square in front, slightly modified by the turn of\r\nthe summit, and provided on each side with an earlike appendage, with\r\nthick and smooth edges; lips sharp.\r\n\r\n                            Argonauta argo.\r\n                            A. tuberculosa.\r\n                            A. nitida.\r\n\r\n_A. argo._ The Portuguese man-of-war. Pl. 35, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nCharacterized above; shell whitish, fragile, keel rather narrow, with\r\nsharp-pointed tuberculations; sides striated transversely, wrinkled\r\nlongitudinally.\r\n\r\n_A. tuberculosa._ The tuberculated Argonaut. Pl. 35, fig. 2.\r\n\r\nSpecies more convex at the sides, with nodulous elevations; keel\r\nbroader, points more obtuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n           2. Carinaria. The glassy Nautilus. Three species.\r\n\r\nIn form and texture greatly resembling the Argonauta, but distinguished\r\nby only having one keel on the whole length of the back.\r\n\r\nShell symmetrical, carinated or not, very thin, slightly compressed,\r\nwithout spire, but with the summit slightly recurved posteriorly;\r\naperture oval and very entire.\r\n\r\n                           Carinaria vitrea.\r\n                           C. fragilis.\r\n                           C. cymbium.\r\n\r\n_C. vitrea._ The glassy Carinaria.\r\n\r\nSpecies very rare and beautiful, thin, papyraceous, very fragile and\r\nsemitransparent; a serrated keel rises up its front, and the sides are\r\ndecorated with ribs parallel to the base.\r\n\r\n_C. fragilis._ The fragile Carinaria.\r\n\r\nSpecies smaller, very thin, striated longitudinally, diverging from the\r\nsummit to the margin; no keel.\r\n\r\n_C. cymbium._ The minute Carinaria.\r\n\r\nSpecies not larger than a grain of sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n
