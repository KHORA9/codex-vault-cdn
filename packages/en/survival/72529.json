Here it grows in all its beauty and\r\nluxury of foliage. Here too, as the frosts of fall settle upon our\r\nmaple forests has the painters tried to copy and place upon canvas\r\nthe picture as the glossy green leaves turn to red and gold. Once it\r\nreigned supreme as King of the forests of Vermont. Thousands of acres\r\nonce occupied by the sugar maple have been cleared for agriculture, and\r\nthe maple like the dusky warrier has gradually been driven back to the\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nSugar maples have been transplanted to some extent in France, Germany,\r\nAustria and England, with a view to adding sugar making to their many\r\nlines of industries, but without satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nOf all the trees of the forest the maple was the most valuable to the\r\nearly settlers. Its wood furnished the best fuel for their greedy\r\nfireplaces. Also in the early days a considerable income was derived\r\nfrom the burning of charcoal, and the maple made the best of material\r\nfor this. But even more than for all these purposes it lost its life\r\nin the manufacture of potash. Not alone was the settlers’ great iron\r\nkettles used for boiling down the sap of the maple into sugar, but were\r\nprincipally used for boiling down the lye leached from wood ashes into\r\npotash thus deriving a large income, although it resulted in the same\r\nold story of killing the goose that laid the golden egg. But alas! Not\r\nalone did the people of years gone by destroy and lay waste our maple\r\ngroves. The maple worm for several years stripped our trees of their\r\nfoliage, and bid fair to make sugaring a thing of the past. But worst\r\nof all at the present time are the veneer mills, which pay large prices\r\nfor maple logs. And unless some means be found to induce the farmer to\r\nspare his maple grove, the maple Sugar industry of Vermont, like the\r\nIndian Brave who roamed at will beneath their shade will have passed\r\nfrom among us.\r\n\r\nWell may we cherish this grand old tree and be proud of sending forth\r\nto the world an article which in its purity and delicacy of flavor is\r\nunsurpassed by any sweetness otherwise produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATHERING MAPLE SAP WITH OXEN AFTER A SNOW STORM.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY HISTORY OF MAPLE SUGAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nVermont has an enviable world wide reputation for the production of two\r\nthings: men and maple sugar. The noble record of the former as given to\r\nus in history and also records of the present day are known to all. But\r\nthat the latter also has a history of much interest is little known.\r\n\r\nAlong with the maize and tobacco, maple sugar had its origin among the\r\nIndians. For time unknown before the white man came to this continent\r\nthe aborigines drew the sap of the maple tree and distilled therefrom\r\na sweet syrup. The various tribes of Canada, Vermont, New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan\r\nall knew of this art. Where ever the white people came in contact with\r\nthe Indians in a region where the maple tree grew they found them\r\nmaking this delicious sweet, and it was from them the white man learned\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\nThe probable way in which the Indians discovered this art is contained\r\nin one of their Legends, as given by Rowland E. Robinson in the\r\n_Atlantic Monthly_:\r\n\r\n“While Woksis, the mighty hunter was out one day in search of game, his\r\ndiligent squaw Moqua busied herself embroidering him some moccasins.\r\nFor the evening meal of her lord she boiled some moose meat in the\r\nsweet water from a maple tree just by the wigwam. Becoming interested\r\nin her work, she forgot the moose meat, and the sweet water boiled away\r\nto a thick brown syrup.”\r\n\r\n“When Woksis returned he found such a dainty morsel ready for his\r\nsupper, as he had never before tasted. The great chief eagerly devoured\r\nthe viand, licked the kettle clean and then went out and told his\r\ntribe that Kose-Kus-beh, a heaven sent instructor, had taught Moqua\r\nhow to make a delicious food by boiling the juice of the maple. And\r\nthe discovery soon became known among all the Indians.” To get the\r\nsap the Indians with their tomahawks cut a long slanting gash in the\r\ntree, below the lower end of this gash a notch was cut to hold a chip\r\nalong which the sap would flow. The sap was caught in birch bark\r\ndishes and boiled in earthen kettles. The small quantity of dark syrup\r\nthus produced was the Indians only supply of sugar. Imagine ourselves\r\nlimited in this necessity of life to a little taste each spring, and\r\nwe can think what a delicacy their maple sugar must have been to the\r\nIndian. We fondly anticipate the coming of this season of the year,\r\neither for pleasure or profit. How long these anticipations have\r\nexisted in the hearts of men we know not, but we do know that long\r\nbefore the foot of white man touched the virgin soil of New England,\r\nlong before the woodman’s axe echoed among our hills and valleys, the\r\ndusky race, who freely roamed the primeval forest gathered the maple\r\nsap in the primative way. It is not improbable that the young braves\r\nand dusky maidens of the tribe, had sugar parties, ate sugar upon snow\r\nand became sweet with each as do the boys and girls at sugar parties\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRIMATIVE METHOD, OF BOILING MAPLE SAP.]\r\n\r\nThe first white people to make maple sugar were the Canadians. The\r\nmanufacture of maple sugar in Vermont dates back to a very early day;\r\nthe first settlers like their neighbors in Canada first learned the art\r\nof making it from the Indian, who they observed notching the trees in\r\nthe springtime.\r\n\r\nFor a hundred years or more the methods of production remained without\r\nmaterial change, save the substitution of iron or copper kettles for\r\nvessels of clay or bark, and the use of better utensils. The sugar\r\nwas made merely for home use; cane sugar was a luxury and often\r\nunobtainable by the pioneer farmer at any cost.\r\n\r\nThe trees were tapped with axes in the Indian way, the sap caught in\r\nwooden troughs and gathered to some central place in buckets, carried\r\non the shoulders with a sap yoke; and if the snow was deep, snow shoes\r\nwere used to travel on; the boiling was done in large iron kettles\r\nswung upon a pole in the open woods in some hollow sheltered from the\r\nwind, with no protection from the sun, rain or snow, and the numerous\r\nimpurities of charcoal, ashes and leaves.\r\n\r\nAlthough this was greatly in advance of the primative methods of\r\nsugar making by the Indians, the product thus secured was dark in\r\ncolor, strong in flavor, not altogether the flavor of the maple, and\r\nquite variable in quality. This method with slight improvements and\r\nmodifications was principally used in the state until within the past\r\n50 years; since that time great improvements have been made. But the\r\nboys and girls of today can scarcely realize the conditions incident to\r\nthe sugar season even 40 or 50 years ago, nor can they fully realize\r\nthe pleasures which this season brought to the young people of those\r\ntimes, more especially the boys. In those days it was no small matter\r\nto get ready for sugaring. Each wooden hoop on the buckets must be\r\ntightened, with new hoops to replace the broken ones. It required\r\nseveral days to soak the buckets and make them hold the sap. The\r\nkettle, holders and buckets must then be taken to the sugar orchard.\r\n\r\nThe boiling place must be shovelled out, and perhaps new posts set for\r\nthe lug pole on which to hang the kettles. Then the big back logs must\r\nbe hauled and some wood cut to start the boiling. A few new sap spouts\r\nwere needed each year, and these were made from green sumac trees of\r\nproper size, and whittled to fit the auger hole; the small pith being\r\nburned out with a redhot iron. With the inch or three-fourths inch\r\nauger, one man could tap about 50 trees in a day if he did not bore\r\nmore than three inches deep, which was the rule. If a new sap yoke was\r\nneeded, a small basswood tree of right size was cut, and the proper\r\nlength for a yoke, halved, dug out to fit the neck and shoulders, and\r\nthe ends shaved to right dimensions. To make “the yoke easy and the\r\nburden light” required a good fitting sap yoke.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that in the days gone by much work, and some\r\ningenuity were needed to get ready for sugaring. In those days the\r\nsugar season called for hard work from the men and boys also who were\r\nalways required to do their part in gathering the nearby sap and\r\ntending the fires. But there were two sources of intense enjoyment for\r\nthe boys which largely compensated for the tired legs in carrying the\r\nsap, and burnt faces and hands in tending fires.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGAR HOUSE INTERIOR. BOILING SAP WITH PANS AND HEATER;\r\nNOW SLIGHTLY OUT OF DATE.]\r\n\r\nThese were sugaring off times, one of which came any day towards night,\r\nwhen the sap was gathered in, and father gave permission to take some\r\nof the sweetest boiling from the big syrup kettle, and sugar off in\r\nthe little four quart kettle, which mother would kindly let us take to\r\nthe boiling place for that purpose. Some live coals were raked from\r\nthe big fire and the little kettle with its precious sweet was placed\r\nthereon, and carefully watched until the sugar would blow through a\r\ntwig loop or lay on snow. The sugar was very dark and often contained\r\nbits of charcoal that had fallen into the big kettles in boiling, but\r\nthat did not matter; it was sweet and the feast always a delightful\r\none. The other occasion was, in a measure, a sort of state performance\r\nand generally occurred at the close of a good run of sap, with fifteen\r\nor twenty buckets of syrup on hand. Early in the morning the biggest\r\nkettle was taken from the boiling place, carefully washed and set on\r\nthree large stones. It was then filled about two-thirds full of syrup\r\nand a fire started. When milk warm, six or eight quarts of milk, with\r\nhalf a dozen well beaten eggs were added to the syrup to “cleanse it.”\r\nJust before boiling was the skimming time, when a pailful or more of\r\ndark thick scum would be taken from the top of the syrup. About noon\r\nthe boys, and oftentimes the girls also would gather around the kettle\r\nto see it boil and taste the sweet as it slowly thickened to sugar; but\r\nnot until about two o’clock in the afternoon would it be thick enough\r\nto lay on snow. In sugaring off with the little kettle we did not\r\nalways have as much sugar as we wanted, but when the big kettle was on,\r\nwe ate grained or waxed sugar, and hot sugar and doughnuts, until we\r\nwanted no more. Only those who have had these experiences can realize\r\nthe intense enjoyments of the sugar seasons of the years gone by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODERN SAP EVAPORATOR IN OPERATION.]\r\n\r\nWithin the past 40 or 50 years, great improvements have been made along\r\nthe line of sugar implements; first the crude sugar shed was built and\r\nthe kettles were incased in an arch; then came the large smooth bottom\r\npans which were considered the height of perfection. But the ever\r\nrestless Yankee was not content with this. First came the heater which\r\nheated the sap before it went into the pans; next the crude form of\r\nevaporator, with wooden sides and corrugations running across the pans\r\nbut no opening beneath. Then the evaporator of the present day of which\r\nthere are many kinds, all of which are good and capable of converting\r\nfrom twenty-five to a hundred gallons of sap into syrup in an hour;\r\nthis will be explained later.\r\n\r\nThe bit of small size has taken the place of the axe, tapping iron and\r\nlarge auger. The tin bucket with covers have placed in the background\r\nthe old troughs and wooden buckets. The team and lines of piping have\r\nlightened the burden of the man with a sap yoke and snow shoes, and\r\ninstead of boiling out of doors or in the old shed a comfortable,\r\nconvenient plank floor sugar house is now used. Thus we see the change\r\nwhich has taken place along the different lines of the industry. It\r\nhas worked itself into a trade or science and men make a study of it.\r\nTherefore instead of the dark colored article containing numerous\r\nflavors, the present product with the modern methods is light in color,\r\nflavored only with the aroma of the maple, and the fine qualities\r\npossessed by this article has already won for itself a reputation far\r\nbeyond the limits of our state. It has already passed the point of\r\nbeing considered a necessity and its use is now limited to those who\r\ncan afford it as a luxury; even the poorest quality the price per pound\r\nwill purchase several pounds of cane sugar for home use. Thus the poor\r\nfarmer cannot use it except as a delicacy. The total product of maple\r\nsugar in the United States as stated in our census is about 50,000,000\r\npounds. Of this Vermont is credited with about one-fourth of the entire\r\noutput. We do not wish to be misunderstood; all the pure maple sugar is\r\nnot of this fine quality; only the best grade which is a small percent\r\nof the amount manufactured is entitled to the high prices received.\r\nThe small quantity of the so-called first class goods have led the\r\nproducers to grade their product, so that we have the first, second and\r\nthird grades with prices to compare with the quality; the reason of\r\nthese numerous grades are several. First, the chemical changes which\r\ntake place with the sap being exposed to the weather, the advance of\r\nthe season and last but not least, the many sugar makers who do not\r\ntake the care they should and who do not have the suitable machines and\r\nutensils for making a No. 1 article.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAPLE SUGAR CAMP EARLY IN THE SEASON; GROUND COVERED\r\nWITH SNOW.]\r\n\r\nThe ever increasing demand for pure, genuine, first class maple goods\r\nat a high price as compared to other sugars has led to the making and\r\nplacing upon the market numerous imitations of our maple product, in\r\nwhich the poorer grade of maple sugar is used as a flavoring. These\r\ngoods often bear fraudulent labels in which it is represented that\r\nthey were manufactured in Vermont, though with the exception of a few\r\npounds used as flavoring, the stuff manufactured of glucose and other\r\ncompounds, never saw a maple tree in Vermont or any other state.\r\n\r\nThis is the article placed upon the market in January and February,\r\nmarked “Vermont New Maple Sugar”. You may ask, how may we get this\r\nbest grade of maple sugar and be sure of its purity and quality.

Get your\r\ngoods direct from the producers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPLE SWEETS AND HOW TO GET THE PURE GOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Vermont is noted as being the home of any industry, that industry is\r\nthe production of maple sugar and syrup, and in this booklet we will\r\ntell you something of the process of manufacture and of whom you can\r\nprocure this delicious luxury in all its purity.\r\n\r\nThe producer must first have a grove of maple trees of the sugar\r\nmaple variety. These groves Vermont has in abundance. They are on the\r\nhillside and in the valley; yet a grove of sugar maples that can be\r\nutilized for sugar making cannot be produced in a few years, as the\r\ntree is comparatively of slow growth and lives to a good old age. Not\r\nmany trees are used for sugar making until they are 40 years old, and\r\nhave a diameter of a foot or more. These are called second growth. Then\r\nthere are others, two, three or even four feet in diameter; sturdy old\r\ntrees that have withstood the storms of many winters. Some of the trees\r\nused for sugar making purposes have been growing since the Pilgrim\r\nFathers landed in 1620.\r\n\r\nAlong in March of each year, the farmer begins to watch the weather for\r\nsigns of spring and conditions favorable to a flow of sap. It can only\r\nbe obtained for a period of a few weeks in the spring, and on certain\r\ndays when the weather conditions are favorable. Snow usually lays on\r\nthe ground when the sugarmaker begins his operations in the sugar camp.\r\nThe first step is to break roads in the soft and thawing snow, so that\r\nthe teams can get about and gather the sap. This breaking roads is\r\noften no light task as the snow oftentimes has icy crusts beneath the\r\nsurface. After the oxen or horses have been over the road several times\r\nand they have become somewhat passable, the buckets are distributed one\r\nor two to a tree and the sugar maker goes about his grove tapping them\r\nby boring a hole with a bit three-eighths to one-half inch in diameter\r\nand two or three feet from the ground as the snow will permit; in this\r\nhole he drives a spout that conveys the sap to the bucket, and on which\r\nthe bucket usually hangs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAPPING THE GROVE.]\r\n\r\nWhen the sugar maker has finished tapping his trees he is ready for a\r\nflow of sap. Sometimes it comes at once and then again the weather may\r\nturn suddenly cold and for a week or ten days there is nothing doing in\r\nthe sugar camp; meantime he can get his boiling apparatus in readiness\r\nand perhaps get a little more wood.\r\n\r\nBut spring will come sooner or later and there is bound to be a rush of\r\nsap. Then comes the busy time in the camp; the men and boys gather the\r\nsap with oxen and horses. This is usually done with a tank holding from\r\n20 to 40 pails on a sled and drawn to the sugar house and stored in\r\ntanks from which in turn it flows to the boiling pan or evaporator; the\r\nflow from the storage tank being regulated by feeders which keeps the\r\nboiling sap in the evaporator constantly at the same level. The sap as\r\nit boils passes from one compartment to another becoming more dense and\r\nsweeter until it reaches the syruping off pan, where it is drawn off in\r\nthe form of syrup. The right density can be determined by a thermometer\r\nor the skilled operator can tell by the way the syrup “leather aprons”\r\nfrom the edge of the dipper. If the thermometer is used a temperature\r\nof 219° F. will give a syrup that will weigh eleven pounds to the\r\ngallon net. It must be remembered, however, that the thermometers are\r\ngraduated at the sea level, and as the altitude increases a lower\r\ntemperature will give the same result on account of the reduced air\r\npressure. An allowance of 1° for every 500 feet rise has been found to\r\nbe about right; thus at an altitude of 1,000 feet a boiling temperature\r\nof 217°F. will give the 11 pounds syrup. Syrup is not however usually\r\nbrought to the required density in the evaporating pan but is drawn off\r\na little less than 11 pounds net, and brought to a uniform standard in\r\nlarger quantities than would be possible in the evaporating pan. The\r\nfire under the boiling sap should be quick and hot, as the sooner it is\r\nreduced to syrup after it runs from the tree the better the product. As\r\nthe sap begins to boil a scum of bubbles rises to the top, which must\r\nbe constantly removed with a skimmer, and the man who tends the fires,\r\nskims the sap and draws off the syrup has a busy job.\r\n\r\nWhen the sap has been reduced to syrup having a density of about 11\r\npounds to the gallon, the niter or malate of lime, sometimes called\r\nsugar sand, which is held in solution in the sap and which crystalizes\r\nor precipitates at this stage of evaporation, can be separated from the\r\nsyrup. This is accomplished in two or more ways; some strain it through\r\nfelt while hot and leave the syrup free of niter; others let stand in\r\nbuckets or tanks until cold; then turn or draw off the clear amber\r\nsyrup leaving the malate of lime at the bottom.\r\n\r\nNothing has as yet been said about sugaring off, but this is a process\r\nby itself and comes after we get the syrup. Anyone who has maple syrup\r\ncan sugar off, as the saying is, or convert the syrup to sugar by\r\nboiling it.\r\n\r\nIn the sugar camp the sugaring off is usually done in a deep pan on a\r\nseparate arch, as the boiling sugar has a tendency to boil over unless\r\nconstantly watched. The size of the pan depends on the form of product\r\nto be made. If the sugar is to be put in tin pails or wood tubs it can\r\nbe handled in lots of 100 pounds or more; this would require a pan 12\r\ninches high, 2 feet wide and 4 feet long. For shipping long distances\r\nor to hot climates the sugar should be cooked down to a density of 240°\r\nto 245°F. Great care is necessary however, not to burn or scorch the\r\nsugar when cooked to so high a temperature. For ordinary purposes if\r\nthe sugar is to be used soon after it is made a temperature of 235° to\r\n238° is high enough.\r\n\r\nWhen making small cakes it is better to have two or more smaller pans\r\nand have the batches of sugar done at different intervals as the color\r\nand grain of the cake sugar depend largely on the amount of stirring\r\nit gets while hot and the sooner it is stirred after it is done the\r\nbetter. When the sugar gets so thick that it will barely pour it is run\r\ninto moulds where it soon hardens and is ready to be wrapped in waxed\r\npaper, packed in boxes and sent to market.\r\n\r\nThere is another form of sugar, and no sugar party is complete without\r\nit, that is sugar on snow or ice. Boil the syrup down a little past\r\n230°, cool it and put on snow with the spoon. When cooled, the waxed\r\nsugar eaten with an occasional plain doughnut and now and then a pickle\r\nis a pleasure long to be remembered and a banquet fit for a King.\r\n\r\nTo be sure and get the pure goods, order direct from the producer or\r\nfrom the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers’ Market, Randolph, Vt., where maple\r\ngoods can be procured at any season of the year.\r\n\r\nThis market is the outgrowth of and closely connected with the Vermont\r\nMaple Sugar Makers’ Association.\r\n\r\nThe addresses of producers will be found at the back part of this\r\nbooklet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUGARING OFF.\r\n\r\n_Will Carleton in Everywhere._\r\n\r\n\r\n    You’d hardly ever think it sir,\r\n    That this big city now astir\r\n    With every rattling noisy thing\r\n    With twentieth century thought to bring,\r\n    With roofs a-shuttin’ out the sky,\r\n    An’ trolley-wagons skippin’ by,\r\n    An’ wires a’ dodgin’ here and there,\r\n    For folks to whisper through the air.\r\n    An’ factories at the daylight’s gleam\r\n    A-blowin’ loud their horns o’ steam,\r\n    You’d hardly ever think, I say,\r\n    A-reasonin’ round the usual way,\r\n    That here, instead o’ things like these,\r\n    Was once a grove of maple trees,\r\n    An’ under yon electric lamp\r\n    We used to run a sugar camp?\r\n\r\n    One star-lit night—it seems, you know,\r\n    About a year or two ago,\r\n    But when you come to count it square\r\n    It’s fifty of ’em, I declare—\r\n    We gathered on my father’s lands,\r\n    ’Bout where that market wagon stands;\r\n    Us younger folks each other found\r\n    From wooded regions all around,\r\n    An’ then with genuine laugh and smile,\r\n    We sugared off in county style!\r\n\r\n    Since then, these memory hallowed spots\r\n    Are fenced up into city lots;\r\n    The farm is raisin’ spires and domes,\r\n    Where once the maples had their homes;\r\n    Big feats are given, rich and rare,\r\n    Of which, I own, I have had my share,\r\n    But nothin’ ever tasted quite\r\n    So good, as on that star-lit night!\r\n\r\n    An’ when the sap was boilin’ there\r\n    Till we could taste it in the air,\r\n    We wood-land boys with hearts awhirl,\r\n    Each took a cupful to his girl,\r\n    An’ cuddled down with her an’ ate,\r\n    With just the white snow for a plate.\r\n    You see that first-class candy-shop\r\n    Up yonder where them school girls stop?\r\n    They’ve gathered sweet-meats there that’s worth\r\n    As much as any _now_ on earth;\r\n    But they’ve got nothin’ that’s in sight\r\n    Of what we ate that winter’s night.\r\n\r\n    An’ up on Woodland Avenue,\r\n    A young, old lady, kind an’ true,\r\n    With han’some tresses gray enough,\r\n    But still on earth, an’ “up to snuff,”\r\n    Will tell you, when we go that way,\r\n    (If she hasn’t changed her mind today)\r\n    That, though the years have brought her nigh\r\n    All earthly good that cash can buy,\r\n    She’d give them all for that one night,\r\n    When, from the sap fire’s fadin’ light,\r\n    We wandered homeward side by side,\r\n    An’ kindled flames that never died,\r\n    An’ felt confession’s sudden charm,\r\n    An’ slowly walkin’ arm-in-arm,\r\n    With no one there to laugh or scoff,\r\n    Just had a private sugarin’-off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two women]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAPLE GROVE IN SOUTHEASTERN VERMONT. ASCUTNEY MOUNTAIN\r\nIN THE DISTANCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERMONT MAPLE SYRUP AND THE ENVIRONMENT OF MANUFACTURE.\r\n\r\nE. WELLMAN BARNARD, Open Ridge, Springfield, Vt.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Vermonters congregate at some special social function when\r\nresponses are expected concerning the state and its products, the\r\nspeakers may be relied on to advance at least the claim of excellence\r\nfor the men it sends to other states and countries to become noted\r\nfactors in the land of their adoption; for its gracious women; for\r\nits pure bred Morgan horses and its far famed maple sweets. These\r\nclaims are in a great measure valid and the inborn pride that vouches\r\nfor them is pardonable, for of the first it is only necessary to\r\nconsult municipal, state and national Blue Books to find corroborative\r\nevidence; the second are known the world around in art and song and\r\nstory. The supple Morgan, elastic to the tread of his native hills,\r\nwith arching neck and prancing feet, an ear for martial music, and\r\nan intelligence too often of a higher degree than his master, has\r\nenlivened the trotting and road stock of the country. It is of the last\r\nproduct and the environment of its manufacture we will treat. Vermont\r\nhas become as justly celebrated for its fine flavored maple products,\r\nas for the silky fibre of its merino wool. For the climate and soil\r\ncontribute to that end as much as do the soils and climate of Cuba and\r\nSumatra to the delicate aroma of smoking tobacco, and it is safe to\r\nsay that nowhere in the known world do these exact conditions occur\r\nto such a great degree as in the section which comprises upper New\r\nEngland and some portions of New York and Canada. There is probably\r\nno crop dependent upon the elements, so sensitive to and actuated by\r\nmeteorological conditions as this, from the day the bud of the maple\r\nbursts forth a tiny leaf in May or June to the day of sap flowing in\r\nthe March or April following. The summer’s heat is quite as essential\r\nas the winter cold, for the former makes the starchy growth to the\r\ntree that the latter converts into sugar, and while the sugar maker\r\nis blistering in his hay field in mid-summer or putting up the fires\r\nto keep out 30° below zero temperature when winter shuts him in, he\r\nknows the right forces are at work in nature’s laboratory to produce\r\nhis sugar crop, and is so patient in his discontent. The sugar season\r\nmay commence early in March or it may be delayed until April, all again\r\n“depends on the weather.” The old time saying “When ye ancient moon of\r\nApril shall glow so shall ye maple sap in abundance flow,” often holds\r\ngood, but when it sometimes happens there are two last quarters of a\r\nmoon in April the sugar maker can take his choice as to which he will\r\nclose the harvest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAMP AFTER A SUGAR SNOW.]\r\n\r\nAs the sun advances northward from its long southern sojourn and the\r\nnorth and south winds lock and interlock for supremacy, the frost and\r\nfury line gradually recedes and the more direct actinic rays of the\r\nsun thaws out the hard frozen timber, the crows hold their annual\r\nmatrimonial pow-wow for pairing; blue birds come and a snow crust often\r\nforms at night hard enough to hold a man if not a team. It is then the\r\nsugar maker begins to think of his annual effort.\r\n\r\nAll up-to-date plants have substantial buildings, running water and\r\nheaters for washing; use galvanized iron tanks for gathering and\r\nstorage; galvanized iron or tin buckets and sap spouts and also one\r\nof the more modern evaporators. This often represents a cash outlay\r\nquite sufficient to handle some business in town and is in use only\r\ntwo or three weeks in the year, the rest of the time being idle unless\r\nthe owner includes the making of cider apple jellies in the fall and\r\nprovides himself with a copper evaporator for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIf the sugar maker has been wise he has erected his sugar house along\r\nside a bank or declivity at least 30 feet high and easy of approach\r\nso that he can handle all the sap by gravity from the gathering tank\r\ndownward to the straining tank and on to the holding tanks and then\r\ninto the evaporator; each being well below the other. He uses an iron\r\narch and stack which he keeps well coated with asphalt varnish to\r\nprevent rust and in case the draft of his arch is not good uses a Fenn\r\nrotary chimney top on his stack. Of course he has an ample supply of\r\nwood fuel that has been provided a year or more in advance under an\r\nadjoining shed so that it may be _very_ dry for a quick fire is one of\r\nthe main factors of rapid evaporation so necessary for good product,\r\nand another quite as important is that the evaporator room be built for\r\nit, with a space of about 5 feet all around it, and the walls sealed\r\nclose to make a hot air draft upward. He does not need to kill the\r\ngoose that lays the golden egg by providing sound rock maple wood. Any\r\ntimber will do if dry; old dry pine stumps are the _ne plus ultra_ and\r\nhemlock boughs, a good second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT THE CLOSE OF THE SEASON; BUCKETS DRYING IN THE SUN.]\r\n\r\nThe competent sugar maker has thoroughly cleansed all his apparatus\r\nwhen he put it up at the end of the season before, but many things will\r\nneed a new scald. The buckets however, and spouts are usually ready for\r\nbusiness if properly stored after a little dusting at short notice and\r\nthis is most important and often saves the first run of sap, and here\r\nlet me add, the competent sugar maker must be as alert and use as much\r\ncare and forethought as the competent hay maker, who _cures_ hay rather\r\nthan “handles it”. Afterthought does not count at sugaring except for\r\nthe next season, but then again scatter brains has poor memory. Our\r\ncity cousin whom we gladly greet in our homes in the “good old summer\r\ntime” has lost some of the joys of the round of the country season if\r\nhe has not been on hand on the morning of some fine spicy day when\r\nthrough the brilliant mirror-like atmosphere Mount Washington looks\r\nlike the Jungfrau, standing aloft in the grand circle of the green and\r\ngranite mountains of New England so reminiscent of Switzerland, and\r\nrobin red breast is back to his old home sending forth cheery notes of\r\ngreeting to go along with the sugar maker and his big load of buckets\r\nto the sugar bush, over a road that has been shoveled or plowed or\r\nbroken through the deep snows on a thawy day ready for the event and in\r\nthe early morn, while the snow crust will hold up and with plenty of\r\nhelpers the buckets, perhaps a thousand or more, are hung. The men who\r\ntap the trees with the wide swing bit stock and 7-16 bit, but have the\r\nexperience and adeptness to quickly select new growth timber in the old\r\ntapped tree and also to secure an upright resting place for the bucket.\r\nThe spout men must never chaffer the tree into the inner bark and must\r\nnot injure the spout when driving it securely in. The bucket should\r\nbe properly placed and kept so at all future gatherings of sap. There\r\nis some discussion pro and con as to the convenience and necessity of\r\ncovers, but they save lots of trouble in stormy weather and save much\r\ngood sap that otherwise would be wasted. The coming bucket will be a\r\nlarge one, holding more then 20 quarts, perfectly covered, well flared\r\nfor ice expansion and compression, concaved on one side to fit the tree\r\nand having in the bottom a flat, sap tight, easily worked faucet that\r\nwill discharge quickly all the sap into the gathering pails without\r\ndisturbing the bucket. Inventors take notice. Our city friend may take\r\na hand at gathering and note the necessity of getting the sap from tree\r\nto evaporator quickly and holding it in as low temperature as possible\r\nto prevent acids inherent to the tree circulation getting in adverse\r\nchemical action and detrimenting the product. It is a good plan to have\r\ngood, clean chunks of ice on hand to keep in storage tanks although\r\nat times it will not be required because of the low temperature\r\nprevailing. The ideal sugar weather is 25° at night and 55° during the\r\nday with damp northerly winds.\r\n\r\nNow as the sap has commenced running our guest will soon realize that\r\nthe whole proposition and output depends strictly on the weather\r\nconditions. A shift of the wind; a change in temperature or humidity\r\nand especially a change of barometer pressure, which is the actual\r\nforce behind a rapid flow of sap, may turn a big sap day into a\r\ncomplete fiasco and perhaps the often reoccurrence, a whole season, and\r\nthus the competent sugar maker with his $30 per month and board “help”\r\nand $4.00 per day teams may be quite out of pocket at the end of the\r\nseason for no cause of his own, even though he obtain $1.50 per gallon\r\nfor his canned syrup; but then he may charge all this up in his profit\r\nand loss account along with his products of milk and cream for the city\r\ncontractor often backing up the latter with a mortgage on his farm the\r\ngrain, help and imposed conditions account that the mill may go around\r\nby day and year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAPLE GROVE IN EARLY SPRING.]\r\n\r\nHas it ever occurred to the city consumer that the modern dairy\r\nbuilding and apparatus so glibly demanded will cost from $3,000 to\r\n$5,000 according to locality, for a herd of 25 cows often more than the\r\nwhole farm does sell for at auction after such improvement has been\r\nadded. And this holds good as to the sugar output; $1,000 goes a short\r\nway for a 2,500 tree establishment and it is the many full buckets\r\nthat count against short runs, rather than a smaller number with less\r\ninitial expense. Moreover it should be borne in mind by the town\r\nconsumer that the farm price demanded has never been exorbitant for\r\nany product and that for at least a quarter of a century has ruled so\r\ndangerously low that no other business or calling that did not have its\r\nhabitation and crude food products included in the output would have\r\nstood up to it for a season; but then, there is the middleman who is\r\noften a needless or exaggerated adjunct that in many lines has become\r\nan avaricious parasite to legitimate business—but that is another story\r\nand our city friends can help us solve that after they have canvassed\r\nthe situation by actual contact, and with benefit to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENT STATUS OF THE INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nBY DR. HARVEY W. WILEY.\r\n\r\n(_From the Government Bulletin._)\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment of Present Conditions.\r\n\r\nMaple sugar was made by the early settlers as an article of food, the\r\nWest Indian cane sugar being costly and difficult to transport inland.\r\nThe commonest kind of “muscovado,” however, was preferred to maple\r\nsugar, if it could be obtained. With the increased supply of cane sugar\r\nthere is little doubt that maple sugar would have almost ceased to be\r\na commodity on the market but for its peculiar flavor, which, while\r\nobjectionable for general purposes, created a special demand. Thus,\r\nwhile the cheaper and unflavored cane product has almost displaced\r\nmaple sugar as an article of food, the demand for maple syrup and sugar\r\nas luxuries and flavoring materials not only keeps the industry alive,\r\nbut calls for a continually increasing supply.\r\n\r\nIt would naturally be supposed that this growth in demand would\r\nhave been followed by a corresponding increase in production. Such,\r\nhowever, is not the case; while the demand for maple sugar and syrup is\r\ncontinually increasing, the production has been more or less stationary\r\nfor twenty years. The explanation lies in the fact that, at the very\r\nlowest estimate, seven-eighths of the product sold today is a spurious\r\narticle, which is only in part maple sugar, or is manufactured entirely\r\nfrom foreign materials.\r\n\r\nWhen maple sugar began to come into general demand, the market fell\r\nnaturally into the hands of the wholesale dealers. The farmers\r\nwere unorganized, and, as a rule, out of touch with the consumers.\r\nConsequently the sugar, made in the early spring, when the farmer was\r\nmost in need of ready money, was generally either sold to the country\r\nstore at a low price, or exchanged for cane sugar, pound for pound,\r\nirrespective of general market conditions. It was then bought again by\r\nthe “mixers” and used to flavor a body of glucose or cane sugar six or\r\nten times as great, making a product which was marketed as “pure maple\r\nsugar.” The mixers preferred to buy a dark, inferior sugar, because\r\nit would go further in the mixture. If the season was bad they bought\r\nless, but at almost the same price, and increased the proportion of\r\nthe adulterant. Thus a shortage in the maple sugar crop has no effect\r\nwhatever on the general supply. It is also true that while the trade in\r\nmaple sugar has been steadily growing, the production from the trees\r\nhas remained stationary. The mixer controls the situation, with the\r\neffect of lowering the profits of the farmer, preventing a compensatory\r\nincrease in price when the crop is short, and retarding progress in the\r\nindustry by the demand for a low-grade tub sugar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAPLE SUGAR CAMP IN ONE OF THE\r\nLARGEST GROVES IN NORTHERN VERMONT.\r\n\r\n(Continuation of this picture on opposite page.)]\r\n\r\nBut there has always been a certain amount of trade in pure maple\r\nsugar and syrup. A part of the city and town population comes from\r\nthe country, where they have known the genuine article, and they have\r\ngenerally been able to supply their wants by dealing directly with the\r\nproducers. The progressive and well-to-do sugar maker has also worked\r\nin this field. Of course there are farmers and others who, having pride\r\nand capacity, do their utmost to produce the best goods and market\r\nthem in the most advantageous manner. Such sugar makers are unwilling\r\nto sell their high-grade goods to the mixers at a low price, but make\r\nevery effort to reach a steady market of regular customers.\r\n\r\nIn the effort to make such a market more general, several maple sugar\r\nmakers’ associations have come into existence. That of Vermont is\r\nthe most notable. The annual meetings of this society have done much\r\nto stimulate improved methods, as well as to build up a legitimate\r\ntrade. The association has established a central market, has adopted\r\na registered trade-mark, and guarantees absolute purity. Its trade,\r\nthrough advertising and other business methods, has reached good\r\nproportions. But there is only a very small part of the business, even\r\nat the present time, which is not in the hands of the mixers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAPLE SUGAR CAMP IN ONE OF THE\r\nLARGEST GROVES IN NORTHERN VERMONT.]\r\n\r\nThe following quotations are from the testimony of Mr. Madden before\r\nthe House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Fifty-seventh\r\nCongress, pages 85 and following:\r\n\r\nMr. Madden. I would like to speak to you a moment in regard to maple\r\nsyrup. That is a subject that will undoubtedly interest you all. We\r\nare in a very peculiar position in regard to maple syrup. We do not\r\nbelieve it is right that a syrup composed of maple syrup made from\r\neither the sap of the maple tree or from maple sugar and mixed with\r\nglucose should be sold as a maple syrup; but we do believe that a maple\r\nsyrup made from syrup of the maple sugar and mixed with cane-sugar\r\nsyrup or refined-sugar syrup, I will say—because beet and cane sugar\r\nare the same after they have been through boneblack—we do believe\r\nthat should be sold for maple syrup, and I will tell you why. In the\r\nfirst place, the amount of sap of maple syrup—that is, syrup that is\r\nmade from boiling the sap of the maple tree without converting it into\r\nsugar—is so limited that it would not, in my judgment, supply more than\r\n5 percent of the demand for maple syrup in the United States.\r\n\r\nNow, when maple sap is boiled into sugar—and I want to say before I go\r\nfurther that the reason that the amount of sap syrup is so limited is\r\nbecause it is hard to keep it from fermentation, and the season is so\r\nshort in which the sap runs that it is difficult to manufacture, to\r\nboil enough in the camps to supply the demand; consequently a large\r\nproportion of the sap in the States where maple sugar is made is boiled\r\ninto maple sugar. Now, we have found by experience—not by chemical\r\nanalysis, but by experience—that the maple sugar made from the sap of\r\nthe maple tree in Ohio is not so strong as the maple sugar made from\r\nthe sap of the maple tree in Vermont, and that the maple sugar made\r\nfrom the sap of the maple tree in Vermont is not so strong in flavor as\r\nthat which is made in Canada, in Quebec Province, because it seems the\r\ncolder the climate, the stronger in flavor the maple sap is.\r\n\r\nNow, we buy these various sugars and reduce them to a liquor to make\r\nmaple syrup, and I will give you my word, gentlemen, if we take a\r\nCanadian sugar, which is the highest priced maple sugar we have, it\r\nbeing worth at the present time twelve cents a pound, while Vermont is\r\nworth only eight cents a pound—I give you my word that if we make a\r\nliquor by melting that Canadian maple sugar, without the addition of\r\nsugar to reduce the strength of the flavor, it is so strong you could\r\nnot use it.\r\n\r\nMr. Coombs. What do you mean by strong?\r\n\r\nMr. Madden. Strong in flavor.\r\n\r\nMr. Coombs. You mean it is positive?\r\n\r\nMr. Madden. The flavor is so positive; yes, sir.\r\n\r\nMr. Coombs. And it is sweet?\r\n\r\nMr. Madden. Sweet, yes; but if you put it on a hot cake you would say\r\nright away, “Take it away; I won’t have such stuff,” and you would\r\nordinarily say that it was glucose. You would be wrong, but that is\r\nwhat you would say.\r\n\r\nNow the Vermont sugar is not so strong, and it does not require so much\r\ncane sugar to reduce that to a flavor comparing with the natural maple\r\nsyrup obtained from the sap itself; and I tell you that we can take\r\nmaple sugar and reduce it, blending it with cane sugar—and by that I\r\nmean take ordinary cut-loaf sugar, for instance, and melt it—and we\r\ncan take this syrup that is made by melting the maple sugar and blend\r\nit with the white syrup, and we can produce a maple syrup that is in\r\nflavor strong enough and yet delicate enough to satisfy the appetite,\r\nand that, in my judgment, is better than the sap syrup made from the\r\nmaple tree for a great majority of the people.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration, although we get $11.50 per dozen gallons for a\r\nsap maple syrup that is boiled from the sap of the maple tree and the\r\ncharacter of the maple syrup that I have just described, about 95\r\npercent of our business is on the syrup that is made from the maple\r\nsugar and the cane sugar rather than on the syrup made from the sap\r\nitself. Now, if we have to take this maple syrup and brand it as cane\r\nsugar, or have any such restrictions, we can not sell it. Now, what are\r\nwe going to do? We do not believe in frauds any more than you do. We\r\nthink just as much of our reputation as you do of yours; but we do not\r\nwant to be held responsible for conditions that we have not built up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF MODERN EQUIPPED MAPLE SUGAR CAMP.]\r\n\r\nMr. Coombs. It seems to me your whole argument has illustrated that\r\neverybody who buys these things knows he is not buying the pure article.\r\n\r\nMr. Richardson. It is either that or you are deceiving them, one or the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nMr. Madden. Well, I will answer another phase of that question.\r\n\r\nNow, it is commonly assumed, I think, that these blends, mixtures,\r\nsubstitutes, and what some of our theoretical gentlemen call commercial\r\nfrauds, are done for the purpose of palming off on the people something\r\nthat is cheap or inferior at a high price. Right there is where the\r\nmistake is made. The profits on that class of goods are less to us\r\nthan on the higher class and more expensive goods, because competition\r\nforces these lower-class commodities down to such an extent that they\r\npay us less profit than any other.\r\n\r\nWe could not take a maple sugar and mix it with cane sugar and obtain\r\nthe price for pure maple-sugar syrup unless it had the quality, unless\r\nit cost so much. In other words, in speaking of maple syrup—and here\r\nis the part of this I forgot to speak of—if you take maple sugar and\r\nreduce it to the liquor, as we call it, and had to sell it without the\r\naddition of any reducing sugar or white syrup—not glucose, but pure\r\ncane or beet sugar—if you have to sell it without doing that, it would\r\nbe so expensive as to be prohibitory, because with Canadian maple sugar\r\nworth twelve cents a pound today, it taking eight pounds of it to make\r\na gallon of syrup, you would have a price of nearly a dollar a gallon\r\nfor your liquor as a first cost, without the cost of package. * * *\r\n\r\nThe above quotations will illustrate sufficiently well the processes of\r\nmanufacturers and dealers in adulterating maple syrup. It is evident\r\nfrom this testimony that if the pure article be obtained when purchased\r\nat random it is by accident rather than by intention. Whatever may be\r\nthe condition of the products when they leave the manufacturers in\r\nVermont, New York, Ohio, or Canada, it is evident that all that part\r\nwhich goes into general commerce is subject to extensive adulterations.\r\nOnly that part which enters domestic commerce, that is sold directly by\r\nthe manufacturer to the consumer, can be considered above suspicion.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the above résumé of the subject that the\r\nadulteration of maple syrup is practiced to an enormous extent.\r\nAs stated by one of the witnesses, it is doubtful if more than 5\r\npercent of the amount sold in this country is the genuine article.\r\nIt is evident that the makers of the genuine article are forced into\r\ncompetition with these extensive adulterations, thus lowering the\r\nlegitimate price. Every grove of maple trees in the United States would\r\nbe worth a great deal more to its owner if the state and national laws\r\nshould be so framed as to eradicate this great evil. Such laws would\r\npermit the sale of these mixed goods under their proper names, and thus\r\nprotect both the manufacturer and consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\nNecessity for Sugar Makers’ Organizations.\r\n\r\nWith a steadily growing demand for maple syrup, which today is almost\r\nentirely supplied by the mixer, the producers of pure syrup can hope\r\nto control the trade only through organization. The difference between\r\nthe pure and the adulterated product is so marked that there would\r\nbe little question as to choice, with the genuine sugar known to the\r\npopular trade. A large number of the consumers hardly know pure maple\r\nsyrup when they taste it, and as so great a part of that on the market\r\nis spurious, they have little chance to learn. Under such a condition\r\nthe market can be gained for the pure product only by means of united\r\naction. An example of such action is the present Vermont Sugar Growers’\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nThe situation is very similar to that which has already been\r\nsuccessfully met, in the case of certain other farm products, by\r\norganized cooperation of producers. Sometimes, as in Germany and\r\nCanada, this has been initiated and substantially aided by government\r\naction; sometimes, as in Ireland and England, it has been carried\r\nthrough entirely by private enterprise. Some years ago Canadian dairy\r\nproducts formed but an insignificant proportion of the exports of these\r\narticles to Great Britain. Now, through the efforts of the Canadian\r\ngovernment to foster intelligent and honest methods of production, an\r\nEnglish market has been secured for the Canadian output. The Irish\r\nAgricultural Organization Society has gone far toward bringing about an\r\neconomic regeneration of the island, and in Germany rural prosperity\r\nhas been vastly increased by the same methods. In all these cases the\r\nprincipal purposes aimed at have been the improvement of methods of\r\nproduction, and furnishing a guaranty of purity to consumers.\r\n\r\nIn the case of maple sugar producers the first necessity is a market\r\nfor high grade, unadulterated sugar and syrup. This they should be able\r\nto secure without much difficulty through responsible association,\r\nwhich can guarantee the quality of all the product bearing its name or\r\nstamp. * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Amount of Sugar in Maple Sap.\r\n\r\nMaple sap is a nearly colorless liquid composed of water, sugar and\r\nvarious mineral substances, such as lime, potash, magnesia, and iron;\r\nit also contains some organic matter in the form of vegetable acids.\r\nThe peculiar flavor of maple sugar comes, not from the sugar, but from\r\nsome one or a combination of all the other substances contained in the\r\nsap.\r\n\r\nThe amount of sugar in the sap of the average sugar maple tree varies\r\ngreatly, the percentage changing in each tree as the season progresses.\r\nCareful experiments have shown that the sap contains on an average\r\nabout 3 percent of sugar. The maximum is reported at 10.2 percent,\r\nwhich was found in a small flow of sap from a sugar maple near the end\r\nof a season, during which the tree averaged 5.01 percent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manufacture of Sugar and Syrup.\r\n\r\n_The Sap Season._\r\n\r\nThe sap season throughout the maple sugar belt of the United States\r\ngenerally begins about the middle of March and continues until the\r\nthird week in April but it varies very widely with a late or an early\r\nspring. Sugar making has begun as early as February 22 and as late as\r\nthe first week in April. The season lasts on an average about four\r\nweeks. The longest run on record included forty-three days, and the\r\nshortest eight days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARGE MAPLE SUGAR CAMP IN CENTRAL VERMONT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VERMONT MAPLE SUGAR MAKERS’ ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWas organized at Morrisville, Vermont, January, 1893. The object of\r\nthis association is to improve the quality and increase the quantity\r\nof the maple product of the state, and to protect the manufacturer and\r\nconsumer from the many fraudulent preparations that are placed upon the\r\nmarkets of this country as pure maple sugar and syrup, and to inform\r\nthe general public where the genuine article can be procured. The\r\nmembers of this association consist of the best manufacturers of maple\r\nsugar and syrup in the state, and their names and post-office address\r\nmay be found in this work, and any dealer or consumer ordering sugar or\r\nsyrup from them will be sure to get that which is pure and free from\r\nadulteration.\r\n\r\nThe association owns and issues a protected label to its members upon\r\ntheir agreement, filed with the secretary, that they will only use\r\nit upon packages containing pure maple sugar or syrup, of standard\r\nquality, of their own manufacture, a copy of which label will be found\r\nin this work, and a purchaser of a package covered by this label may\r\nbe assured of its purity. The improper or unauthorized use of this\r\nlabel or any adulteration of the products covered by the same will be\r\nprosecuted to the full extent of the law by the association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALITY OF MAPLE SUGAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the sugar product of the state has improved\r\ngreatly within the past few years, it is also true that there is\r\nconsiderable of the product at the present time that does not show\r\nthe improvements that have been noted. It is one of the rules of the\r\nVermont Maple Sugar Makers’ Association that no member shall use the\r\nlabel of the association on goods of an inferior quality, and a member\r\nwho does so use it is liable to be expelled from its membership;\r\ntherefore, it is well to insist upon packages bearing this label, and\r\ncustomers are requested to report to the secretary of the society any\r\ncase of receiving poor goods bearing this label. While it is the first\r\nobject of the association to improve the quality of maple products, and\r\nincrease the quantity now produced, which can easily be doubled, it\r\nrecognizes as of the utmost importance that it should place before the\r\nconsumers the knowledge which shall enable them to secure pure goods\r\ninstead of an imitation product.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there is more of the spurious than of the genuine sold at\r\nthe present time shows that there is chance for abundant work in that\r\ndirection, and the officers of the association will always be glad to\r\naid customers in placing their orders when requested so to do, as far\r\nas practicable, a medium of information between producer and customer\r\nin which it is hoped that each will receive an advantage.\r\n\r\nMaple goods as put up in Vermont, are in three general classes. 1.\r\nThe syrup or maple honey is put up and sealed in air-tight tin cans\r\nor in glass, the usual form being the gallon tin can either round or\r\noblong and the syrup in these cans should weigh eleven pounds net to\r\nthe gallon or about eleven and three-fourths pounds including can. Pure\r\nsyrup varies to quite an extent in color. The first run of sap usually\r\nproduces syrup of a lighter color than is produced later in the season.\r\nThe color also depends upon the method used in collecting the sap and\r\nboiling it and, other things being equal, the less time that is allowed\r\nbetween the production of the sap and its conversion into syrup or\r\nsugar the whiter will be the product. Were it possible to convert sap\r\nto sugar without any lapse of time or exposure to the air the product\r\nwould be perfectly white. There has been a suspicion among people who\r\nare familiar with Vermont maple products of the last generation that\r\nthe present goods were not pure because so much whiter than formerly,\r\nbut the change is due entirely to the improved and more rapid methods\r\nof manufacture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WELL LOCATED MAPLE SUGAR CAMP IN SOUTHEASTERN VERMONT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPURE MAPLE SUGAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is practically no adulteration of maple sugar in Vermont. The\r\nstate has a stringent law on the subject and the maple sugar makers\r\nof the state will tolerate no infringement of its provisions, so that\r\nthe customer can feel great security in ordering sugar or syrup of\r\nproducers or dealers in the state, and can feel absolute security in\r\nordering these goods of any of the members of the Vermont Maple Sugar\r\nMakers’ Association, bearing the label of the association. The name and\r\npost-office address of all the members of the association will be found\r\nin this booklet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR THE CARE OF MAPLE SUGAR AND SYRUP.\r\n\r\n\r\nSugar. To keep maple sugar in a warm climate, store in as cool and\r\ndry a place as possible. If in tin and tightly covered it will mould\r\nand ferment on top. To prevent this the best method is to take off\r\nthe covers and paste over the top of the can a piece of strong manila\r\npaper. This will also serve to keep out the ants. Tubs with covers are\r\nnot as liable to ferment, but is it well to treat them in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nSyrup. Syrup should be put in air-tight packages and kept so until\r\nused. If the syrup is received packed in sawdust the best method is\r\nto leave it in the original package and store in a dark cool place,\r\nuntil needed for use, and if it is put up in glass be very careful to\r\nkeep it from the light. If for any reason the syrup should begin to\r\nferment, which will be known in the case of tin packages by a bulging\r\nof the head of the can called “swelled-head” it should be borne in mind\r\nthat it is not necessarily spoiled as would be the case with fruit,\r\nbut by heating it to a boiling temperature the fermentation can be\r\narrested and the original flavor, to a great extent, restored. And in\r\nthis connection it may be said that either syrup or sugar, which has\r\nbeen kept for some time, will be greatly improved in flavor by the same\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEAR THE CLOSE OF THE MAPLE SUGAR SEASON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN SUGARING TIME.\r\n\r\nHELEN M. WINSLOW, _in Harper’s Bazaar_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It’s sugarin’-time up country; an’ settin’ here in town\r\n  I seem to hear the “drip, drip, drip” of sap a-tricklin down\r\n  Into them wooden buckets in our old sugar place,\r\n  Afore Josiah died, an’ our only daughter, Grace,\r\n  Insisted ’twasn’t noways safe for me to live alone\r\n  Up in that old brown farm-house that long’s I live I own;\r\n  An’ naught would do but I must come an’ stay along o’her,\r\n  Where sugarin’ might be hayin’ time, an’ all this bustlin’ stir;\r\n  Where smells o’spring, an’ tricklin’ sap, and wild flowers never come.\r\n  There ain’t no chance for such things around Grace’s city home;\r\n  An’ sugarin’-time no different ain’t from summer or from fall.\r\n  I wisht Josiah’n me was back—a-workin’ hard an’ all.\r\n\r\n  The children on these brick paved-walks they make me think of Jim,\r\n  What we had hoped would stay by us—the farm was meant for him.\r\n  He died when he was twenty. Yes, there was young Josiah,\r\n  Professor in a college now, with hope of something higher.\r\n  An Grace, our girl, she married what they called a railroad king,\r\n  An lives on Beacon Street, in all the styles that she can swing.\r\n  But all the same, when April comes, I see ’em all again,\r\n  Jest runnin’ wild around that farm, them three, an in\r\n  All sorts of mischief daily, from early spring to fall.\r\n  I wisht the hull of us was back—a-workin’ hard an’ all.\r\n\r\n  I seem to see the tossels shakin’ out up on the trees;\r\n  I seem to smell the perfume of the May-flowers in the breeze;\r\n  I seem to feel the summer a-coming ’crost the hills;\r\n  I seem, up in the pastur’, to hear the singin’ rills;\r\n  I see the mowin’ lot, an’ hear the sharpen’ of the blades;\r\n  I hear the cattle lowin’; I go berryin’ in the glades;\r\n  I smell the harvest ripenin’ over in the corner lot;\r\n  I see Josiah bringin’ home that last new pair he bought;\r\n  I remember how together, when the children went away—\r\n  Grown big an’ married—by the fire we sat at close of day;\r\n  An’ how together we had lived there fifty year—come fall.\r\n  I wisht Josiah’n’ me was back—a-workin’ hard an’ all.\r\n\r\n  It’s sugarin’-time up country; but never once again\r\n  Shall I, now goin’ on eighty, see the spring a-comin’ in\r\n  The old way, thro’ the maple trees, ’crost the pastur’s brown;\r\n  For I must stay—in sugarin’-time—on Beacon Street in town.\r\n  The children never, as of old, shall I tuck in at night,\r\n  Their little feet so tired, but their happy hearts so light.\r\n  They wouldn’t go back if they could, an’ I’m too old they say;\r\n  An’ sence Josiah isn’t there, I let ’em have their way.\r\n\r\n  It’s sugarin’-time up country, though, an’ memories, like the sap,\r\n  Start up an’ set me longin’ for Mother Natur’s lap,—\r\n  An’ him, an’ Jim,—the farm, the hens, the horses in the stall.\r\n  It’s sugarin’-time up country; I’m homesick—that is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPURE FOOD AND DRUG LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nVermont has a Pure Food and Drug law which strictly prohibits the\r\nadulteration and misbranding of food products including maple sugar and\r\nsyrup. (Public Statutes of Vermont, sections 5466 to 5494 inclusive.)\r\n\r\nPurchasers of maple products made in Vermont may rest assured that they\r\nare as represented, and made from the sap of the maple tree and nothing\r\nelse. The maple sugar and syrup produced in Vermont is not only pure\r\nbut it has a delicacy of flavor and aroma not found in the same product\r\nmade in other localities. This fine flavor is the result of the soil\r\nand climatic conditions to be found in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXIMS FOR MAPLE SUGAR MAKERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBe in readiness to get the first run.\r\n\r\nHave all utensils thoroughly cleansed and scalded.\r\n\r\nEmploy none but competent and experienced men to tap your trees.\r\n\r\nCut away the rough bark, only, before tapping, leaving bark\r\nsufficiently thick to hold the spout firmly to prevent leaking.\r\n\r\nThe finest flavor and lightest color will be obtained by shallow\r\ntapping.\r\n\r\nGather often, boil at once. Every delay in the process of evaporating\r\nsap will injure more or less the _quality_ of the sugar.\r\n\r\nAlways strain your sap. Use felt strainers for syrup. Boil down to\r\n11 pounds per gallon; test by a correct thermometer, and can hot to\r\nprevent crystalizing in bottom of the can.\r\n\r\nGive full gallon measure and ship only _standard_ goods to your best\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nUse a reliable thermometer. It is as indispensable in the sugar house\r\nas in the dairy.\r\n\r\nUse tin or painted buckets and the best improved metallic spout.\r\n\r\nThe bucket cover has come to stay. Use them, they will save their cost\r\nin one season.\r\n\r\nJoin your State Maple Sugar Makers’ Association, and attend the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nDo not think that you know it all, for maple sugar making is a science\r\nabout which you may learn something every season if you are observing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARGE MAPLE SUGAR CAMP IN NORTHERN VERMONT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES FOR USING MAPLE SWEETS IN COOKING; HOME CANDY MAKING, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaple Rolls.\r\n\r\nOne quart of bread dough when it is moulded for the last raising, mould\r\nin a cup of maple sugar, ¼ teaspoonful of soda, 1 tablespoon of butter.\r\nLet it rise and mould again and cut out, rise and bake.

Boil\r\nuntil it will be crumpy when dropped in cold water. Turn on buttered\r\nplates; when cool enough, pull and cut into sticks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaple Cream Without Cream.\r\n\r\nNo. 1. Place in a batter bowl the whites of two eggs and two cups\r\nof the best maple syrup. Whip these together with an egg-beater or\r\nfork, and then throw in enough XXX confectioners’ sugar to thicken\r\nsufficiently to mould into shapes. Coat with either chocolate or plain\r\ncream.\r\n\r\nNo. 2. Mix two pounds of maple sugar, a fourth of a teaspoonful of\r\ncream of tartar and a cup of water, and boil until a little of the\r\nsyrup will form a “soft ball” when tried in water. Set it away in the\r\nkettle until almost cold, and then work it with the paddle until it\r\nbecomes creamy or cloudy, when pour immediately into a shallow tin pan.\r\nWhen cold, turn the pan upside down, when the cream will drop out.\r\nDivide into blocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A REFRESHING DRINK.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMaple Cream.\r\n\r\nTwo cups of maple sugar, one-half cup of cream. Let it boil until it\r\nhairs then stir in one cup of nuts, butternuts preferable.\r\n\r\nPour into buttered tins and when nearly cold cut in squares.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaple Sugar Fudge.\r\n\r\nTwo cups of white sugar. One cup of maple sugar, two-thirds cup of\r\nsweet milk. Cook twelve minutes after it begins to boil. Remove from\r\nthe stove and add a piece of butter size of a walnut and 1 cup of\r\nwalnut meats. Stir until it thickens then pour into a buttered tin.\r\nWhen nearly cold cut in squares.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaple Sugar Candy.\r\n\r\nTwo pint bowls maple sugar, 1 pint bowl white sugar, 1 pint bowl of\r\nwater, two or three tablespoons whipped cream, one large coffee cup\r\nbutternuts. Place kettle with the sugar and water in it on back of the\r\nstove until sugar is dissolved then draw forward and boil until the\r\nsoft ball stage is reached (being careful not to stir the sugar after\r\nit commences to boil). Remove to a cool place until nearly cold before\r\nstirring. When partly grained add whipped cream, turn into tins and set\r\nin a cool place to harden.\r\n\r\n\r\nNut Candy.\r\n\r\nNice maple sugar with sufficient water to dissolve it, 1 tablespoonful\r\nof vinegar to 2 pounds of sugar, and butter size of walnut. Boil until\r\nvery hard when tried in water. Pour immediately into a buttered pan in\r\nwhich the nuts have been placed. Cut into sticks before cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaple Opera Caramels.\r\n\r\nMeasure a cup and a half each of coffee and maple sugar, one cupful\r\nof cream, and a fourth of a small teaspoonful of cream of tartar, and\r\nboil the cream and sugar together, adding the cream of tartar, wet with\r\na little cream, as soon as the syrup reaches the boiling point. Cook\r\nuntil a drop of syrup, lifted out on the point of a skewer and dropped\r\ninto very cold water, may be rolled into a soft, creamy ball between\r\nthe fingers. Care must be taken to stir the syrup incessantly, and also\r\nthat the bottom of the pan or kettle does not come into direct contact\r\nwith the fire, as the cream is very apt to scorch. When done, remove\r\nfrom the fire, flavor, and pour on a slab, sprinkled with a very little\r\nwater. When cold, cream the candy as directed for fondant, and as soon\r\nas perfectly smooth, form into a sheet half an inch thick, using the\r\nrolling pin. Let it remain on the slab a few hours, when divide into\r\nstrips and wrap in parafin paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaple Molasses Cocoanut Squares.\r\n\r\nPlace in the kettle a scanty cupful of new maple molasses and a\r\ntablespoonful of butter, and, when boiling add a grated cocoanut. Cook\r\nover a slow fire, stirring until done. As soon as the hot candy will\r\nharden when dropped into cold water, pour it out upon a well buttered\r\nslab; and when hardened sufficiently cut it into squares and wrap in\r\nparafin paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nPulled Taffy.\r\n\r\nTake three cupfuls of dry maple sugar, a cupful of vinegar and water\r\nin equal parts (one-third vinegar and two-thirds water may be used if\r\nthe vinegar is very strong) and a piece of butter the size of a walnut.\r\nBoil the sugar, water and vinegar together until half done, then add\r\nthe butter, stirring only enough to incorporate the butter thoroughly,\r\nand boil until done. Drop a little of the candy now and then into cold\r\nwater and test by pulling it apart; if it snaps it is done and must\r\nbe immediately poured upon a buttered dish to cool. Flavor with a\r\nlittle vanilla extract poured upon the top. When the taffy has cooled\r\nsufficiently to handle, it may be pulled, cut into short lengths and\r\nplaced on buttered dishes or parafin paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nPopped Corn and Nut Candy.\r\n\r\nTake a tablespoonful of butter, three of water and one cupful of maple\r\nsugar; boil until it is ready to candy and then add three quarts\r\nof nicely popped corn. Stir briskly until the mixture is evenly\r\ndistributed over the corn. Keep up the stirring until it cools when\r\neach kernel will be separately coated. Close and undivided attention\r\nmay be necessary to the success of this kind of candy. Nuts are\r\ndelicious prepared by this method.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoarhound Candy.\r\n\r\nTo a quart of water add a small single handful of hoarhound herbs and\r\nboil for about half an hour. Strain and press all the liquor from the\r\nherbs. Place on the fire and add to this liquid three pounds of maple\r\nsugar. When it boils add half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Test,\r\nand when it reaches the “hard crack” or 290 degrees, add a piece of\r\nbutter as large as a hulled walnut. When the butter is dissolved, pour\r\nthe whole mass on a marble slab or onto a greased platter. When almost\r\ncold mark into squares with a knife.\r\n\r\n\r\nMolasses Candy.\r\n\r\nTwo cups of maple molasses, 2 teaspoonfuls of butter, 1 cup of maple\r\nsugar, ½ cup of water.\r\n\r\nBoil all together until done,—be careful not to stir while cooking.\r\nWhen done, pull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICERS OF THE VERMONT MAPLE SUGAR MAKERS’ ASSOCIATION, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A.

Grimm, at that convention, made the first display of high grade\r\nMaple Sugar and Syrup, winning first prize, then and there after, for\r\nyears in succession, until Sugar Makers became sufficiently interested\r\nto make exhibits worthy of the industry.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the Grimm exhibits were wholly confined to utensils for\r\nproducing a high grade quality of maple sweets. Grimm utensils won the\r\nhighest awards of the Association in 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898,\r\n1899, 1901, 1904 and 1905. In the three years omitted, Grimm exhibits\r\nwere not in competition.\r\n\r\nThe Grimm Evaporator and Grimm Sap Spout is more extensively used by\r\nup-to-date Sugar Makers than any other make. More Grimm Evaporators\r\nare annually sold than the combined output of all competitors. I will\r\nforfeit $500.00 if this statement is not absolutely true. Competitors\r\nare invited to investigate, order books are at their disposal. The\r\nGrimm Spout has benefited the Sugar Maker and the Maple tree, more than\r\nany other article in the Sugar Bush. If you desire first quality, the\r\nGrimm Evaporator is in a class by itself. Ask those who have used it\r\nfor nearly thirty years. Addresses can be had for the asking.\r\n\r\nThe Grimm Evaporator is made with or without Syphons, and with the\r\nlatest improvements, no other evaporator can evaporate sap faster nor\r\nmake as good a quality of product as the Improved Grimm Evaporator.\r\n\r\n  G.

Best maple sugar makers throughout the state and country\r\nprefer the Williams Bellows Falls Evaporator for these superior\r\nfeatures:\r\n\r\n1st.—=Simplicity.= There is a free flow of sap from end to end. No need\r\nof siphons. They are easy to tend, easy to handle and cannot burn the\r\nbottom if left with a fire in the arch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Evaporators]\r\n\r\n2nd.—=Durability.= These evaporators are made of galvanized iron,\r\ntin plate or copper, tin plated. The material is the highest quality\r\nobtainable, and the evaporator will keep its shape with long service.\r\n“It is almost impossible to wear them out.”\r\n\r\n3rd.—=Double Heating Surface.= The crimps, which run crosswise, are\r\npressed from the same sheet metal as the bottom. As they are open\r\nunderneath, they not only prevent the heat passing up the chimney, but\r\ngive double the heating surface of other pans.\r\n\r\n4th.—=Cost.= Heating surface considered, the Williams is the cheapest\r\nevaporator made. Our catalogue gives the price of any size evaporator\r\nas well as of all other sugar makers supplies.\r\n\r\n=We can give you high quality goods, at reasonable prices.
