public, it is hoped that he will have the patience to\r\nexamine the contents of this.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the following pages commenced beekeeping in 1828, without\r\nany knowledge of the business to assist him, save a few directions\r\nabout hiving, smoking them with sulphur, &c. Nearly all the information\r\nto be had was so mingled with erroneous whims and notions, that it\r\nrequired a long experience to separate essential and consistent points.\r\nIt was _impossible_ to procure a work that gave the information\r\nnecessary for practice. From that time to the present, no sufficient\r\nguide for the inexperienced has appeared. European works, republished\r\nhere, are of but little value. Weeks, Townley, Miner, and others,\r\nwriters of this country, within a few years, have given us treatises,\r\nvaluable to some extent, but have entirely neglected several chapters,\r\nvery important and essential to the beginner. Keeping bees _has_ been,\r\nand is now, by the majority, deemed a hazardous enterprise. The ravages\r\nof the moth had been so great, and loss so frequent, that but little\r\nattention was given to the subject for a long time. Mr. Weeks lost his\r\nentire stock three times in fifteen years. But soon after the discovery\r\nwas promulgated, that honey could be taken from a stock without\r\ndestroying the bees, an additional attention was manifest, increasing\r\nto a rage in many places. It seems to be easily understood, that\r\n_profit_ must attend success, in this branch of the farmer's stock;\r\ninasmuch as the \"bees work for nothing and find themselves.\" This\r\ninterest in bees should be encouraged to continue till enough are kept\r\nto collect all the honey now wasted; which, compared with the present\r\ncollections, would be more than a thousand pounds to one. But to\r\nsucceed, that is the difficulty. Some eighteen years since, after a\r\npropitious season, an aged and esteemed friend said to me, \"It is not\r\nto be expected that you will have such luck always; you must expect\r\nthey will run out after a time. I have always noticed, when people have\r\nfirst-rate luck for a time, that the bees generally take a turn, and\r\nare gone in a few years.\"\r\n\r\nI am not sure but, to the above remarks, may be traced the cause of my\r\nsubsequent success. It stimulated me to observation and inquiry. I soon\r\nfound that good seasons were the \"lucky\" ones, and that many lost in an\r\nadverse season, all they had before gained. Also, that strong families\r\nwere the only ones on which I could depend for protection against the\r\nmoth. This induced the effort to ascertain causes tending to diminish\r\nthe size of families, and the application of remedies. Whether success\r\nhas attended my efforts or not, the reader can judge, after a perusal\r\nof the work.\r\n\r\nIt is time that the word \"_luck_,\" as applied to beekeeping, was\r\ndiscarded. The prevailing opinion, that bees will prosper for one\r\nperson more than another, under the same circumstances, is fallacious.\r\nAs well might it be applied to the mechanic and farmer. The careless,\r\nignorant farmer, might occasionally succeed in raising a crop with a\r\npoor fence; but would be liable, at any time, to lose it by trespassing\r\ncattle. He might have suitable soil in the beginning, but without\r\nknowledge, for the proper application of manures, it might fail to\r\nproduce; unless a _chance_ application _happened_ to be right.\r\n\r\nBut with the _intelligent_ farmer the case is different: fences in\r\norder, manures judiciously applied, and with propitious seasons, he\r\nmakes a sure thing of it. Call him \"_lucky_\" if you please; it is his\r\nknowledge, and care, that render him so. So with bee-keeping, the\r\ncareful man is the \"lucky\" one. There can be no effect without a\r\npreceding cause. If you lose a stock of bees, there is a cause or\r\ncauses producing it, just as certain as the failure of a crop with the\r\nunthrifty farmer, can be traced to a poor fence, or unfruitful soil.\r\nYou may rest assured, that a rail is off your fence of management\r\nsomewhere, or the proper applications have not been made. In relation\r\nto bees, these things may not be quite so apparent, yet nevertheless\r\ntrue. Why is there so much more uncertainty in apiarian science than\r\nother farming operations? It must be attributed to the fact, that among\r\nthe thousands who are engaged in, and have studied agriculture, perhaps\r\nnot more than one has given his energies to the nature and habits of\r\nbees. If knowledge is elicited in the same ratio, we ought to have a\r\nthousand times more light on one subject than the other, and still\r\nthere are some things, even in agriculture, that may yet be learned.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed, by many, that we already have all the knowledge that\r\nthe subject of _bees_ affords. This is not surprising; a person that\r\nwas never furnished with a full treatise, might arrive at such\r\nconclusions. Unless his own experience goes deeper, he can have no\r\nmeans of judging what is yet behind.\r\n\r\nIn conversation relative to this work, with a person of considerable\r\nscientific attainments, he remarked, \"You do not want to give the\r\nnatural history of bees at all; that is already sufficiently\r\nunderstood.\" And how is it understood; as Huber gives it, or in\r\naccordance with some of our own writers? If we take Huber as a guide,\r\nwe find many points recently contradicted. If we compare authors of our\r\nday, we find them contradicting each other. One recommends a peculiarly\r\nconstructed hive, as just the thing adapted to their nature and\r\ninstincts. If a single point is in accordance with their nature, he\r\nlabors to twist all the others to his purpose, although it may involve\r\na fundamental principle impossible to reconcile. Some one else succeeds\r\nin another point, and proceeds to recommend something altogether\r\ndifferent. False and contradictory assertions are made either through\r\nignorance, or interest. Interest may blind the judgment, and spurious\r\nhistory may deceive.\r\n\r\nIt is folly to expect success in bee-keeping for any length of time,\r\nwithout a correct knowledge of their nature and instincts; and this we\r\nshall never obtain by the course hitherto pursued. As much of their\r\nlabor is performed in the dark, and difficult to be observed, it has\r\ngiven rise to conjecture and false reasoning, leading to false\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nWhen _I_ say a thing _is so_, or say it is _not so_, what evidence has\r\nthe reader that it is proved or demonstrated? _My_ mere assertions are\r\nnot expected to be taken in preference to another's; of such proof, we\r\nhave more than enough. Most people have not the time, patience, or\r\nability, to set down quietly with close observation, and investigate\r\nthe subject thoroughly. Hence it has been found easier to receive error\r\nfor truth, than to make the exertion necessary to confute it; the more\r\nso, because there is no guide to direct the investigation. I shall,\r\ntherefore, pursue a different course; and for every _assertion_\r\nendeavor to give a test, that the reader may apply and satisfy himself,\r\nand trust to no one. As for theories, I shall try to keep them separate\r\nfrom facts, and offer such evidence as I have, either for or against\r\nthem. If the reader has further proof that presents the matter in\r\nanother light, of course he will exercise the right to a difference of\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nI could give a set of rules for practice, and be very brief, but this\r\nwould be unsatisfactory. When we are told a thing _must be done_, most\r\nof us, like the \"inquisitive Yankee,\" have a desire to know _why_ it is\r\nnecessary; and then like to know _how_ to do it. This gives us\r\nconfidence that we are right. Hence, I shall endeavor to give the\r\npractical part, in as close connection with the natural history, that\r\ndictates it, as possible.\r\n\r\nThis work will contain several chapters entirely new to the public: the\r\nresult of my own experience, that will be of the utmost value to all\r\nwho desire to realize the greatest possible advantages from their bees.\r\n\r\nThe additions to chapters already partially discussed by others, will\r\ncontain much original matter not to be found elsewhere. When many\r\nstocks are kept, the chapter on \"Loss of Queens,\" alone, will, with\r\nattention, save to any one, not in the secret, enough in one season to\r\nbe worth more in value than many times the cost of this work. The same\r\nmight be said of those on diseased brood, artificial swarms, wintering\r\nbees, and many others.\r\n\r\nIf such a work could have been placed in my hands twenty years ago, I\r\nshould have realized hundreds of dollars by the information. But\r\ninstead of this, my course has been, first to suffer a loss, and then\r\nfind out the remedy, or preventive; from which the reader may be\r\nexempt, as I can confidently recommend these directions.\r\n\r\nAnother new feature will be found in the duties of each season being\r\nkept by itself, commencing with the spring and ending with the winter\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nIn my anxiety to be understood by all classes of readers, I am aware\r\nthat I have made the elegant construction and arrangement of sentences\r\nof secondary importance; therefore justly liable to criticism. But to\r\nthe reader, whose object is information on this subject, it can be of\r\nbut little consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nA BRIEF HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE KINDS OF BEES.\r\n\r\nEvery prosperous swarm, or family of bees, must contain one queen,\r\nseveral thousand workers, and, part of the year, a few hundred drones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN.] [Illustration: WORKER.] [Illustration: DRONE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\nThe queen is the mother of the entire family; her duty appears to be\r\nonly to deposit eggs in the cells. Her abdomen has its full size very\r\nabruptly where it joins the trunk or body, and then gradually tapers to\r\na point. She is longer than either the drones or workers, but her size,\r\nin other respects, is a medium between the two. In shape she resembles\r\nthe worker more than the drone; and, like the worker, has a sting, but\r\nwill not use it for anything below royalty. She is nearly destitute of\r\ndown, or hairs; a very little may be seen about her head and trunk.\r\nThis gives her a dark, shining appearance, on the upper side--some are\r\nnearly black. Her legs are somewhat longer than those of a worker; the\r\ntwo posterior ones, and the under surface, are often of a bright copper\r\ncolor. In some of them a yellow stripe nearly encircles the abdomen at\r\nthe joints, and meets on the back. Her wings are about the same as the\r\nworkers, but as her abdomen is much longer, they only reach about\r\ntwo-thirds the length of it. For the first few days after leaving the\r\ncell, her size is much less than after she has assumed her maternal\r\nduties. She seldom, perhaps never, leaves the hive, except when leading\r\na swarm, and when but a few days old, to meet the drones, in the air,\r\nfor the purpose of fecundation. The manner of the queen's impregnation\r\nis yet a disputed point, and probably never witnessed by any one. The\r\nmajority of close observers, I believe, are of opinion that the drones\r\nare the males, and that sexual connection takes place in the air,[1]\r\nperforming their amours while on the wing, like the humble-bee and some\r\nother insects. It appears that one impregnation is operative during her\r\nlife, as old queens are not afterwards seen coming out for that purpose.\r\n\r\n      [1] The objectors to this hypothesis will be generally found\r\n      among those who are unable to give a more plausible elucidation.\r\n      Those who oppose the fact that one bee is the mother of the whole\r\n      family, will probably be in the same class.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION AND DUTY OF WORKERS.\r\n\r\nAs all labor devolves on the workers, they are provided with a sack, or\r\nbag, for honey. Basket-like cavities are on their legs, where they pack\r\nthe pollen of flowers into little pellets, convenient to bring home.\r\nThey are also provided with a sting, and a virulent poison, although\r\nthey will not use it abroad when unmolested, but, if attacked, will\r\ngenerally defend themselves sufficient to escape. They range the fields\r\nfor honey and pollen, secrete wax, construct combs, prepare food, nurse\r\nthe young, bring water for the use of the community, obtain propolis to\r\nseal up all crevices about the hive, stand guard, and keep out\r\nintruders, robbers, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF DRONES.\r\n\r\nWhen the family is large and honey abundant, a brood of drones is\r\nreared; the number, probably, depends on the yield of honey, and size\r\nof the swarm, more than anything else. As honey becomes scarce, they\r\nare destroyed. Their bodies are large and rather clumsy, covered with\r\nshort hairs or bristles. Their abdomen terminates very abruptly,\r\nwithout the symmetry of the queen or worker. Their buzzing, when on the\r\nwing, is louder, and altogether different from the others. They seem to\r\nbe of the least value of any in the hive. Perhaps not more than one in\r\na thousand is ever called upon to perform the duty for which they were\r\ndesigned. Yet they assist, on some occasions, to keep up the animal\r\nheat necessary in the old hive after a swarm has left.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOST BROOD IN SPRING.\r\n\r\nIn spring and first of summer, when nearly all the combs are empty, and\r\nfood abundant, they rear brood more extensively than at any other\r\nperiod, (towards fall more combs are filled with honey, giving less\r\nroom for brood.) The hive soon becomes crowded with bees, and royal\r\ncells are constructed, in which the queen deposits her eggs. When some\r\nof these young queens are advanced sufficiently to be sealed over, the\r\nold one, and the greater part of her subjects, leave for a new\r\nlocation, (termed swarming.) They soon collect in a cluster, and, if\r\nput into an empty hive, commence anew their labors; constructing combs,\r\nrearing brood, and storing honey, to be abandoned on the succeeding\r\nyear for another tenement. One in a hundred may do it the same season,\r\nif the hive is filled and crowded again in time to warrant it. Only\r\nlarge early swarms do this.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR INDUSTRY.\r\n\r\nIndustry belongs to their nature. When the flowers yield honey, and the\r\nweather is fine, they need no impulse from man to perform their part.\r\nWhen their tenement is supplied with all things necessary to reach\r\nanother spring, or their store-house full, and no necessity or room for\r\nan addition, and we supply them with more space, they assiduously toil\r\nto fill it up. Rather than to waste time in idleness, during a\r\nbounteous yield of honey, they have been known to deposit their surplus\r\nin combs outside the hive, or under the stand. This natural industrious\r\nhabit lies at the foundation of all the advantages in bee-keeping;\r\nconsequently our hives must be constructed with this end in view; and\r\nat the same time not interfere with other points of their nature; but\r\nthis subject will be discussed in the next chapter. Those peculiar\r\ntraits in their nature, mentioned in this, will be more fully discussed\r\nin different parts of this work, as they appear to be called for, and\r\nwhere proof will be offered to sustain the positions here assumed,\r\nwhich as yet are nothing more than mere assertions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nHIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIVES TO BE THOROUGHLY MADE.\r\n\r\nHives should be constructed of good materials, boards of good\r\nthickness, free from flaws and cracks, well fitted and thoroughly\r\nnailed.\r\n\r\nThe time of making them is not very particular, providing it is done in\r\nseason. It certainly should not be put off till the swarming period, to\r\nbe made as wanted, because if they are to be painted; it should be done\r\nas long as possible before, as the rank smell of oil and paint, just\r\napplied, might be offensive to the bees.\r\n\r\nBut what kind of hive shall be made?\r\n\r\nIn answer, some less than a thousand forms have been given. The\r\nadvantages of bee-keeping depend as much upon the construction of\r\nhives, as any one thing; yet there is no subject pertaining to them on\r\nwhich there is such a variety of opinions, and I have but little hopes\r\nof reconciling all these conflicting views, opinions, prejudices, and\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT THEM.\r\n\r\nOne is in favor of the old box, and the cruel practice of killing the\r\nbees to obtain the honey, as the only means to obtain \"luck;\" \"they are\r\nsure to run out if they meddle with them.\" Another will rush to the\r\nopposite extreme, and advocate all the extravagant fancies of the\r\nitinerant patent-vender, as the _ne plus ultra_ of all hives, when\r\nperhaps it would be worth more for fire-wood than the apiary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR HAS NO PATENT TO RECOMMEND.\r\n\r\nTo remove from the mind of the reader all apprehension that I am about\r\ncondemning one patent to recommend another, I would say in the\r\nbeginning, that I have _no patent to praise, no interest in deceiving_,\r\nand I hope no prejudices to influence me, in advocating or condemning\r\n_any_ system. I wish to make bee-keeping plain, simple, economical, and\r\nprofitable; so that when we sum up the profit \"it shall not be found in\r\nthe other pocket.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a principle recognized by our statute, that no person is suitable\r\nas a Juror, who is biased either by interest or prejudice. Now whether\r\nI am the impartial Jurist, is not for me to say: but I wish to discuss\r\nthe subject fairly. I hope some few will be enabled to see their own\r\ninterest: at any rate, dismiss prejudice, as far as possible, while we\r\nexamine wherein _one class_ in community is unprofitable to\r\nbee-keepers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECULATORS SUPPORTED LONG ENOUGH.\r\n\r\nWe have faithfully supported a host of speculators on our business for\r\na long time; often not caring one straw about our success, after\r\npocketing the fee of successful \"humbuggery.\" One is no sooner gone,\r\nthan we are beset by another, with something altogether different, and\r\nof course the acme of perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFIX OF PATENT A BAD RECOMMENDATION.\r\n\r\nThis has been done until the very prefix of patent, or premium,\r\nattached to a hive, renders it almost certain that there must be\r\nsomething deleterious to the apiarian; either in expense of\r\nconstruction or intricate and perplexing in management, requiring an\r\nengineer to manage, and a skilful architect to construct.\r\n\r\nWhat does the American savage, who without difficulty can track the\r\npanther or wolf, know of the principles of chemistry? What does the\r\nChemist know of following a track in the forest, when nothing but\r\nwithered leaves can guide him? Each understands principles, the\r\n_minutiæ_ of which the other never dreamed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIGNORANCE OF OFFICERS AND COMMITTEES.\r\n\r\nThus it appears to be with granting patents and premiums, if we take\r\nwhat has been patented and praised by our committees and officers as\r\nimprovements in bee-culture. These men may be capable, intelligent, and\r\nwell fitted for their sphere, but in bee matters, about as capable of\r\njudging, as the Hottentot would be of the merits of an intricate\r\nsteam-engine. Knowledge and experience are the only qualifications\r\ncompetent to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPPOSITION TO SIMPLICITY.\r\n\r\nI am aware that among the thousands whose direct interest is opposed to\r\nmy simple, plain manner of getting along, many will be ready to contend\r\nwith me for every departure from their patent, improved or premium\r\nhives, as the case may be.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY GAINING ONE POINT, PRODUCE ANOTHER EVIL.\r\n\r\nI think it will be an easy matter to show that every departure from\r\nsimplicity to gain _one_ point, is attended in another by a\r\ncorrespondent evil, that often exceeds the advantage gained. That we\r\nhave made vast improvements in art and science, and in every department\r\nof human affairs, no one will deny; consequently, it is assumed we must\r\ncorrespondingly improve in a bee-hive; forgetting that nature has fixed\r\nlimits to the instinct of the bee, beyond which she will not go!\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to point out the advantages and objections to\r\nthese pretended improvements, and then we will see if we cannot avoid\r\nthe objections, _and retain the advantages, without the expense_, by a\r\nsimple addition to the common hive; because if we expect to encourage\r\nbee-keeping, they must have better success than a neighbor of mine, who\r\nexpended fifty dollars for bees and a patent, and lost all in three\r\nyears! Most bee-keepers are farmers; very few are engineers sufficient\r\nto work them successfully. I would say to all such as do not understand\r\nthe nature of bees, adhere to simplicity until you do, and then I am\r\nquite sure you will have no desire for a change.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST DELUSION.\r\n\r\nProbably the first delusion in the patent line originated with the\r\nidea, that to obtain surplus honey, it was absolutely necessary to have\r\na chamber hive. To get rid of the depredations of mice, the suspended\r\nhive was contrived. The inclined bottom-board was then added to throw\r\nout the worms. To prevent the combs from sliding down, the lower end\r\nwas contracted.\r\n\r\nThe principle of bees rearing queens from worker-eggs when destitute,\r\ngave rise to the dividing hive in several forms. Comb, when used\r\nseveral years, becomes thickened and black, and needs changing; hence\r\nthe changeable hives, Non-swarmers have been introduced to save risk\r\nand trouble. Moth-proof hives to prevent the ravages of worms, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMBER HIVE.\r\n\r\nThe chamber hive is made with two apartments; the lower and largest is\r\nfor the permanent residence of the bees, the upper or chamber for the\r\nboxes. Its merits are these: the chamber affords all the protection\r\nnecessary for glass boxes; considered as a cover, it is never lost. Its\r\ndemerits are inconvenience in handling; it occupies more room if put in\r\nthe house in the winter; if glass boxes are used, only one end can be\r\nseen, and this may be full when the other may hold some pounds yet, and\r\nwe cannot possibly know until it is taken out. I know we are told to\r\nreturn such boxes when not full \"and the bees will soon finish them,\"\r\nbut this will depend on the yield of honey at the time; if abundant, it\r\nwill be filled; if not, they will be very likely to take a hint, and\r\nremove below what there is in the box; whereas if the chamber was\r\nseparate from the hive, and was not a chamber but a loose cap to cover\r\nthe boxes, it could be raised at any time without disturbing a single\r\nbee, and the precise time of the boxes being filled ascertained, (that\r\nis, when they are of glass.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. GRIFFITH'S HIVE.\r\n\r\nMrs. Griffith, of New Jersey, is said to have invented the suspended\r\nchamber hive with the inclined bottom-board. One would suppose this was\r\nsufficiently inconvenient to use, and difficult and expensive to\r\nconstruct.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEEKS' IMPROVEMENT.\r\n\r\nYet Mr. Weeks makes an alteration, calls it an improvement, the expense\r\nis but a trifle more; it is sufficient to be sanctioned by a patent.\r\nFrom front to rear, the bottom is about three inches narrower than the\r\ntop, somewhat wedge-shape; it has the merit to prevent the combs from\r\nslipping down, when they _happen_ to be made, to have the edges\r\nsupported. The objections are, that filth from the bees will not fall\r\nas readily to the bottom as if every side was perpendicular, and the\r\nextra trouble in constructing.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCLINED BOTTOM-BOARDS DO NOT THROW OUT ALL THE WORMS.\r\n\r\nInclined bottom-boards form the basis of one or two patents, said to be\r\ngood to roll out the worms. I can imagine a pea rolling off such a\r\nboard; but a worm is not often found in a rolling condition. Most of us\r\nknow, that when a worm drops from the combs, it is like the spider,\r\nwith a thread attached above. The only way that I can imagine one to be\r\nthrown out by these boards, is to have it dead when it strikes it, or\r\nso cold that it cannot spin a thread, and wind to shake the board, till\r\nit rolls off. The objections to these boards are coupled with the\r\nsuspended hive, with which they are usually connected.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIONS TO SUSPENDED HIVES.\r\n\r\nAll suspended hives _must be objectionable_ to any one who wishes to\r\nknow the _true_ condition of his bees at all times. Only think of the\r\ntrouble of unhooking the bottom-board, and getting down on your back,\r\nor twisting your neck till your head is dizzy, to look up among the\r\ncombs, and then see nothing satisfactory for want of light; or to lift\r\nthe hive from its supporters, and turn it over. The operation is too\r\nformidable for an indolent man, or one that has much other business.\r\nThe examination would very probably be put off till quite sure it would\r\ndo no longer, and sometimes a few days after that, when you will very\r\noften find your bees past remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEE BEES OFTEN.\r\n\r\n\"_See your bees often_,\" is a choice recipe,--it is worth five hundred\r\ndollars at interest, even when you have but few stocks. How necessary\r\nthen that we have every facility for a close and minute inspection. How\r\nmuch easier to turn up a hive that simply rests on a stand. Sometimes\r\nit is necessary to turn the hive, even bottom up, and let the rays of\r\nthe sun directly among the combs, to see _all_ the particulars. By this\r\nclose inspection, I have often ascertained the cause of some\r\ndifficulty, and provided a remedy, thus saving a good many that in a\r\nshort time would have been lost; yet, with a little help, were as\r\nvaluable as any by another year.\r\n\r\n\r\nHALL'S PATENT.\r\n\r\nMr. Hall has added a lower section to his hive, about four inches deep,\r\nwith two boards inside, like the roof of a house, to discharge the\r\nworms, &c.; but as these boards would interfere with close inspection,\r\nthey are objectionable. Several other variations of inclined\r\nbottom-boards and suspended hives have been contrived, to obtain a\r\npatent, but the objections offered will apply to most of them. I shall\r\nnot weary the reader by noticing in detail _every_ hive that has been\r\npatented; I think if I notice the _principles of each kind_, it will\r\ntest his patience sufficiently.\r\n\r\n\r\nJONES' PATENT.\r\n\r\nJones' dividing hive was probably suggested by this instinctive\r\nprinciple of the bee, viz.: when a stock by any accident loses its\r\nqueen, and the combs contain eggs or very young larvæ, they will rear\r\nanother. Now if a hive is constructed so as to divide the brood-combs,\r\nit would seem quite certain that the half without a queen, would raise\r\none; and we could multiply our stocks without swarms, the trouble of\r\nhiving, and risk of their going to the woods, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, I thought I had obtained a principle that would\r\nrevolutionize the whole system of bee management. In 1840 I constructed\r\nsuch hives, and put in the bees to test by actual experiment, the\r\nutility of what seemed so very plausible in theory. It would appear\r\nthat this principle suggested the same idea to Mr. Jones; perhaps with\r\nthis difference: I think he did not wait to test the plan thoroughly,\r\nbefore obtaining his patent in '42. One vender of rights asserted that\r\n63 stocks were made from one in three years; but somehow a great many\r\nthat obtained the rights, failed in their expectations. From my\r\nexperiments, I think I could guess at some of the reasons.\r\n\r\nMr. A.--\"Well, what are the reasons? give us your experience, if you\r\nplease, I am interested; I had the right for such a hive, and had a lot\r\nmade to order, that cost more money in the end than I shall ever pay\r\nagain for anything about bees.\"\r\n\r\nDo not be too hasty, friend, I think I can instruct you to keep bees on\r\nprinciples in accordance with their nature, which is very simple, so\r\nthat if you can be induced to try again, we will have the _hives_ cost\r\nbut little, at any rate.\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS OF FAILURE IN DIVIDING HIVES.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty with dividing hives, appeared to be here. It\r\nmust be constructed with a partition or division to keep the combs in\r\neach apartment separate; otherwise, we make tearing work in the\r\ndivision. When bees are first put into such hives, unless the swarm is\r\nvery large, and honey abundant, one apartment will be filled to the\r\nbottom before a commencement is made in the other.\r\n\r\nMr. A.--\"What difference can that make? It is necessary to have the\r\nhive full; if it cannot be all filled at once, why let them fill part.\"\r\n\r\nThe difference is this. The first combs built by a swarm are for brood,\r\nand store-combs afterwards, as needed; one apartment will be nearly\r\nfilled with all brood-combs, and the other with store-combs and honey.\r\nNow in the two kinds of cells there is a great difference; those for\r\nbreeding are near half an inch in length, while those for storing are\r\nsometimes two inches or more; totally unfit for breeding; until the\r\nbees cut them off to the proper length, which they will not do, unless\r\ncompelled for want of room, consequently this side of store-combs is\r\nbut little used for brood. When such hive is divided, the chances are\r\nnot more than one in four, that this apartment will have any young bees\r\nof the proper age from which to raise a queen; if not, and the old\r\nqueen is in the part with the brood-comb, where she will be ninety-nine\r\ntimes in a hundred, one half of the hive is lost for want of a queen.\r\n\r\nMr. A.--\"Ah! I think I now understand how I lost one-half of nearly\r\nevery hive I divided. I also lost some of them in the winter; there was\r\nplenty of bees as well as honey; can you tell the cause of this?\"\r\n\r\nI will guess that they starved.\r\n\r\nMr. A.--\"Starved! why, I said there was plenty of honey.\"\r\n\r\nI understood it, but nevertheless feel quite sure.\r\n\r\nMr. A.--\"I would like to see that made plain; I can't understand how\r\nthey could starve when there was honey!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF STARVING IN SUCH HIVES.\r\n\r\nI said one apartment would be filled with brood-combs; this will be\r\noccupied, at least partially, with brood as long as the yield of honey\r\nlasts; consequently, there will be but little room for storing here,\r\nbut the other side may be full throughout. The bees will take up their\r\nwinter quarters among the brood-combs. Now suppose the honey in this\r\napartment is all exhausted during a severe turn of cold weather, what\r\ncan the bees do? If one should leave the mass and go among the frosty\r\ncombs for a supply, its fate would be as certain as starvation. Without\r\nfrequent intervals of warm weather to melt all frost on the combs, and\r\nallow the bees to go into the other apartment for honey, they _must_\r\nstarve.\r\n\r\nThe cost of construction is another objection to this hive, as the\r\nlabor bestowed on one is more than would finish two, that would be much\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF THE CHANGEABLE HIVE CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\nThe value of changeable hives is based upon the following\r\nprinciple:--Each young bee when it first hatches from the egg, is\r\nneither more nor less than a worm; when it receives the necessary food,\r\nthe bees seal it over; it will then spin a cocoon, or line its cell\r\nwith a coating of silk, less in thickness than the thinnest paper: this\r\nremains after the bee leaves it. It is evident, therefore, that after a\r\nfew hundreds have been reared in a cell, and each one has left its\r\ncocoon, that such cell must be somewhat diminished, although the\r\nthickness of a dozen cocoons could not be measured; and this old cell\r\nneeds removing, that the bees may replace it with a new one. But how\r\nshall it be done? This is a feat for the display of ingenuity. A common\r\nman might go about it in a very sensible, simple manner, might possibly\r\nturn the hive over, and cut out the old combs when necessary, without\r\nknowing perhaps that the patent-vender could _sell_ a receipt to do the\r\nthing _scientifically_, the benefit of which would be many times on the\r\nprinciple of a surgeon cutting off your head, to get a good chance to\r\ntie a small artery according to system; or would show you a roundabout\r\nway of half a dozen miles to accomplish what the same number of rods\r\nwould do. Had we not ocular demonstration of the fact, we could not\r\nsuppose so many variations for the same end could be invented. But if\r\nwe reward ingenuity, it will be stimulated to great exertions. Perhaps\r\nif we describe the merits of one or two of this class, the utility of\r\nthis principle may be comprehended.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATION OF THESE HIVES.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, the sectional hive of various patterns has been patented;\r\nit consists generally of about three boxes, one above another; the top\r\nof each has one large hole, or several small ones, or cross-bars, about\r\nan inch wide, and half an inch apart; these holes or spaces allowing\r\nthe bees to pass from one box to the other. When all are full, the\r\nupper one is removed, and an empty one put under the bottom; in this\r\nway all are changed, and the combs renewed in three years; very easily\r\nand quietly done. This is as far as a patent-vender wishes the subject\r\ninvestigated; and some of his customers have not gone beyond this\r\npoint. As an offset for these advantages, we will first look at the\r\ncost of such hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENSE IN CONSTRUCTING CHANGEABLE HIVES.\r\n\r\nIt is as much work to construct each separate section, as a common\r\nhive; consequently, it is three times the expense to begin with. It is\r\nobjectionable for wintering bees, on the same principle as the dividing\r\nhive. I object to it on another point: our surplus honey will never be\r\npure, as each section must be used for breeding, and every cell so\r\nused, will contain cocoons corresponding to the number of bees raised.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURPLUS HONEY WILL CONTAIN BEE-BREAD.\r\n\r\nAlso pollen, or bee-bread, is always stored in the vicinity of the\r\nyoung brood; some of this will remain mixed with the honey, to please\r\nthe palate with its _exquisite flavor_. The majority will probably\r\nprefer all surplus honey stored in pure comb, where it will be with\r\nproper management.\r\n\r\nI will here give a full description of a hive on this principle, as I\r\nhave the description from one of its advocates, in the Dollar\r\nNewspaper, Philadelphia: called Cutting's Patent Changeable Hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF CUTTING'S CHANGEABLE HIVE.\r\n\r\n\"The size of the changeable hive most used in this section, has an\r\noutside shell, made of inch boards, about two feet high and sixteen and\r\na half inches square, with a door hung in the rear. On the inside are\r\nthree boxes or drawers, which will hold about one thousand cubic inches\r\neach, and when filled with honey, usually weigh about thirty-five\r\npounds, which is a sufficient amount of honey to winter a large swarm.\r\nThe sides of these drawers are made of boards, about half an inch\r\nthick; the tops and bottoms of the lower drawers and ends of the upper\r\ndrawers should be three-fourths of an inch, and the drawers should be\r\nfourteen inches high, fourteen inches from front to rear, and six and\r\nthree-fourths inches wide. Two of these drawers stand side by side,\r\nwith the third placed flatwise upon the two, with a free communication\r\nfrom one drawer to another, by means of thirty three-fourth inch holes\r\non the side of each drawer, and twenty-four in the bottom of the upper\r\ndrawer, and holes in the top and bottom of the lower drawers, to\r\ncorrespond, and slides to cut off the communication when occasion may\r\nrequire. Thus we see our hive may be one hive, with communication\r\nsufficiently free throughout, or we may have three hives combined. The\r\ndrawers have tubes made in them, (for the bees to pass and repass),\r\nwhich are made to go through the front side of the hive. The back-side\r\nof the drawers are doors, with glass set in them. These drawers set up\r\nfrom the bottom of the hive, and rest on pieces of wood, closely fitted\r\nin such a way, as to make a space under the drawers for the _dirt_,\r\n_dead bees_, and _water_, which collect in the bottom of hives in\r\nwinter; between the drawers and the outside is an air space of about\r\none-third of an inch.\r\n\r\nThese hives, when well made and painted, will last many years, and\r\nthose doing much in the business will find it an advantage to have a\r\nfew extra drawers. Having given you some idea of the construction of\r\nthe changeable hive, I will proceed to notice some of the most\r\nimportant reasons why I prefer this hive to any I have yet seen. First\r\nbecause the hive, being constructed upon the changeable principle, so\r\nthat by taking out a full drawer, and placing an empty one in its\r\nstead, our comb is always kept new, wherefore, the size of the bee is\r\npreserved, and kept in a more healthy, or prosperous state, or\r\ncondition, than when obliged to remain and continue to breed, in the\r\nold comb, when the cells have become small. Secondly, because small,\r\nlate swarms may be easily united. Thirdly, because large swarms may be\r\neasily divided. Fourthly, because however late a swarm may come off, it\r\nmay be easily supplied with honey for the winter, by taking from a full\r\nhive a surplus drawer, and placing it in the hive of the late swarm.\r\nFifthly, because a column of air between the drawers and the outside of\r\nthe hive is a non-conductor of both heat and cold, preventing the\r\nmelting of the comb, and securing the bees against frost and cold.\"\r\n\r\nNow here is a full description of perhaps as good a hive as any of its\r\nclass; it is given for the benefit of those who wish to go miles\r\ninstead of rods; they may know the road, especially as they can have\r\nthe privilege by paying for it: for myself, I had rather be\r\nexcused,--why, reading the description has nearly exhausted my\r\npatience; what should I do if I attempted to make one?\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST OBJECTION, COST OF CONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe first obstacle in the way (after the right is obtained) is the\r\nconstruction. Let's see; we want inch boards to make the shell,\r\nthree-quarter inch boards for the tops and bottoms of drawers, half\r\ninch for sides, hinges to hang a door, glass for back of drawers, tubes\r\nfor the egress of the bees, and slides to cut off communication. It\r\nwill be necessary to get a mechanic, and a workman too. Those 108 holes\r\nthat must be bored, _must match_, or it is of no use to make them. But\r\nfew farmers would have the tools requisite, a still less number the\r\nskill and patience to do it. What the cost might be by the time a hive\r\nwas ready to receive the bees, I could not say; but guess it might be\r\nsome three or four dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIVES CAN BE MADE WITH LESS EXPENSE.\r\n\r\nThe one I shall recommend, without paint, will not cost, or need not,\r\nover 37-1/2 cents, with cover, etc. Now, if we wish hives for ornament,\r\nit is well enough to expend something for the purpose; but it is well\r\nnot to refine too much, as there are limits which, if passed, will\r\nrender it unfit for bees. Therefore, when profit is an object, the\r\nextra expense will or ought to be made up by the bees, in return for an\r\nexpensive domicil. But will they do it? The merits of the one under\r\nconsideration are fully given. \"First, by taking out a full drawer and\r\nputting in an empty one in its stead, the combs are always kept new,\r\nand cells of full size.\" Now this fear of bees becoming dwarfs in\r\nconsequence of being reared in cells too small, has done more mischief\r\namong the bees, and their owners' pockets, than if the fact had never\r\nbeen thought, or heard of.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD BREEDING CELLS WILL LAST A LONG TIME.\r\n\r\nThese old cells do not need renewing half as often as has been\r\nrepresented. It is the interest of these patent-venders to sell rights;\r\nthis interest either blinds their eyes as to facts, or lulls the\r\ninternal monitor of right, while acquisitiveness is gratified. The same\r\ncells can be used for breeding six or eight years, perhaps longer, and\r\nno one can tell the difference by the size of the bees; I have two\r\nstocks now in their tenth year without renewal of comb. A neighbor of\r\nmine kept a stock twelve years in the same combs; it proved as\r\nprosperous as any. I have heard of their lasting twenty, and am\r\ninclined to believe it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCELLS LARGER THAN NECESSARY AT FIRST.\r\n\r\nThe bees seem to make a provision for this emergency, the sheets of\r\ncomb are farther apart than actually necessary at first, the diameter\r\nof the cell is also a little larger than the size of the young bee\r\nrequires. _Of this we are certain_--great many young bees _can_ be\r\nraised in a cell, and not be diminished in size, sufficient to be\r\ndetected. The bottom fills up faster than at the sides, and as they do\r\nso, the bees add a little to the length, until the ends of these cells\r\non two parallel combs approximate too close to allow the bees to pass\r\nfreely; before which time it is unnecessary to remove comb for being\r\nold.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPENSE OF RENEWING COMBS.\r\n\r\nOne important item should be considered in this matter, by those who\r\nare so eager for new combs. It is doubtful whether one in 500 ever\r\nthought of the expense of renewing comb. I find it estimated by one\r\nwriter,[2] that twenty-five lbs. of honey was consumed in elaborating\r\nabout half lb. wax. This without doubt is an over estimate, but no one\r\nwill deny that some is used.\r\n\r\n      [2] See Appendix of Cottage Bee-keeper, page 118.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEST TO USE OLD COMBS AS LONG AS THEY WILL ANSWER.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied of this much, from actual experience, that every time\r\nthe bees have to renew their brood-combs in a hive, they would make\r\nfrom ten to twenty-five lbs. in boxes, hence I infer that their time\r\ncan be more profitably employed than in constructing brood-combs _every\r\nyear_. I would also suggest that when combs have been once used for\r\nbreeding it is the best use they can be applied to, after that, as the\r\ncocoons render it unfit for much else than a little wax.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD FOR PRUNING WHEN NECESSARY.\r\n\r\nBut when the combs do actually need removing, I prefer the following\r\nmethod of pruning, to driving the bees out entirely, as has been\r\nrecommended. It can be done in about an hour. As we are comparing the\r\nmerits of different methods of getting rid of old combs, I shall give\r\nmine here, notwithstanding it may seem a little out of place.\r\n\r\nThe best time is a little before night. The first movement is to blow\r\nunder the hive some tobacco smoke (the best means of charming them I\r\never found); the bees, deprived of all disposition to sting, retreat up\r\namong the combs to get away from the smoke; now raise the hive from the\r\nstand and carefully turn it bottom upwards, avoiding any jar, as some\r\nof the bees that were in the top when the smoke was introduced, and did\r\nnot get a taste, will now come to the bottom to ascertain the cause of\r\nthe disturbance; these should receive a share, and they will\r\nimmediately return to the top, perfectly satisfied. When so many bees\r\nare in the hive, as to be in the way in pruning, (which if there is not\r\nit is not worth it,) get an empty hive the size of the old one, and set\r\nit over, stopping the holes; now strike the lower hive with a hammer or\r\nstick, lightly and rapidly, five or ten minutes, when nearly all the\r\nbees will be in the upper hive, and set that on the stand. There being\r\nnow nothing in the way, except a few scattering bees, that I will\r\n_warrant not to sting, unless you pinch or get them fast_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOOLS FOR CUTTING OUT COMB.]\r\n\r\nThe broad one is very readily made from a piece of an old scythe, about\r\n18 inches long, by any blacksmith, by simply taking off the back, and\r\nforming a shank for a handle at the heel. The end should be ground all\r\non one side, and square across like a carpenter's chisel. This is for\r\ncutting down the sides of the hive; the level will keep it close the\r\nwhole length, when you wish to remove all the combs; it being square\r\ninstead of pointed or rounded, no difficulty will be found in guiding\r\nit,--it being very thin; no combs are mashed by crowding.\r\n\r\nThe other tool is for cutting off combs at the top or any other place.\r\nIt is merely a rod of steel three-eighths of an inch diameter, about\r\ntwo feet long, with a thin blade at right angles, one and a half inches\r\nlong, and a quarter inch wide, both edges sharp, upper side bevelled,\r\nbottom flat, &c. You will find these tools very convenient; be sure and\r\nget them by all means, the cost cannot be compared to the advantages.\r\n\r\nNow with the tools just described, proceed to remove the brood-combs\r\nfrom the centre of the hive. The combs near the top and outside are\r\nused but little for breeding, and are generally filled with honey;\r\nthese should be left as a good start for refilling, but take out all\r\nthat is necessary, while you are about it; then reverse the hives,\r\nputting the one containing the bees under the other; by the next\r\nmorning all are up; now put it on the stand, and this job is done\r\nwithout one cent extra expense for a patent to help you, and the bees\r\nare much better off for the honey left, which has to be taken away with\r\nall patent plans that I have seen, and this, as has been remarked, is\r\nnot worth much, occupied as it is with a few cocoons and bee-bread. It\r\nis worth much more to the bees, and they will give us pure comb and\r\nhoney for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF TOBACCO SMOKE.\r\n\r\n\"I would not do it for fifty dollars, the bees would sting me to\r\ndeath.\" Stop a moment, if you never tried the efficacy of tobacco\r\nsmoke, you know nothing of a powerful agent; this is the grand secret\r\nof success; without it, I admit it would be somewhat hazardous; but\r\nwith it, I have done it time after time without receiving a single\r\nsting, and no protection whatever, for either hands or face.\r\n\r\nBut is there no difficulty with our sectional or changeable hive, when\r\nthis feat is to be performed? The combs will be made in the two drawers\r\nsimilar to the dividing hive, brood-combs in one side, and store-combs\r\nin the other. We wish to remove the one with brood-combs of course, (as\r\nthat is the one where the combs are thick and bad, &c.) Where will the\r\nqueen be? With the brood-comb, where her duty is most likely to be;\r\nwell, this is the one we want, and we take it out. How is she to get\r\nback? She must go back, or we have three chances in four of losing the\r\nstock; but her majesty will remain perfectly easy, as well as some of\r\nthe workers, wherever you put the drawer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER OBJECTIONS TO A SECTIONAL HIVE.\r\n\r\nI can see no other way but to break the box, look her up, and help the\r\nhelpless thing home, (the chances of being stung may be here too.) Now,\r\nfor a time at least, they must use the other drawer for breeding, where\r\nmost of the cells are unfit. There is altogether too great a proportion\r\nof drone-cells; these, as well as the other size, will nearly all be\r\nmuch too long, and will have to be cut off to the proper length, a\r\nwaste of wax as well as labor. Another thing might be set down per\r\ndisadvantage of Mr. Cutting's hive; the job of getting a swarm into\r\nsuch hive, at first, I fancy would not be desirable to many. Now, when\r\nwe strike the balance, putting expense, difficulties, and perplexities\r\non one side, and simplicity and economy on the other, it appears like a\r\n\"great cry for little wool.\" But stop a moment, four other advantages\r\nare enumerated in its favor: second, third, and fourth are borrowed\r\nfrom the common hive, or are all available here when required. But\r\nfifthly, allows a \"column of air between the drawers and outside of the\r\nhive, is a non-conductor of heat and cold,\" &c. This is an advantage\r\nnot possessed by the common hive; neither does the common hive offer\r\nsuch advantages to the moth, by affording such snug quarters for worms\r\nto spin their cocoons, when they cannot be destroyed without\r\nconsiderable trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-SWARMERS.\r\n\r\nHere I will endeavor to be brief; I feel anxious to get through with\r\nthis disagreeable part, where every word I say will clash with\r\nsomebody's interest or prejudice. The merits of this hive are to obtain\r\nsurplus honey with but little trouble, which often succeeds in\r\nsatisfying people of its utility. The principal objection is found on\r\nthe score of profit. Suppose we start with one, call it worth five\r\ndollars in the beginning, at the end of ten years it is worth no more,\r\nvery likely not as much, (the chances of its failing, short of that\r\ntime, we will not take into the account;) we might get annually, say\r\nfive dollars worth of surplus honey, amounting to fifty dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTRAST OF PROFIT.\r\n\r\nThe swarming hive, we suppose, will throw off one swarm annually, and\r\nmake us one dollar's worth of surplus honey, (we will not reckon that\r\nyielded by the first swarm, which is often more than that from the old\r\nstocks,) about one third of the average in good seasons. The second\r\nyear there will be two to do the same; take this rate for ten years, we\r\nhave 512 stocks, either of them worth as much as the non-swarmer, and\r\nabout a thousand dollars worth of surplus honey. Call these stocks\r\nworth five dollars each, which makes $2,560, all added together will\r\nmake the snug little sum of about $3,500, against $55. It is not to be\r\nexpected that any of us will realize profits to this extent, but it is\r\na forcible illustration of the advantages of the swarming hive over the\r\nnon-swarmer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLE OF SWARMING NOT UNDERSTOOD.\r\n\r\nBut many of these non-swarmers, 'tis said, can be changed to swarmers\r\nto suit the convenience of the apiarian--Colton's is one. It is\r\nasserted that it can be made to swarm within two days at any time,\r\nmerely by taking off the six boxes or drawers that are very ingeniously\r\nattached; as this contracts the room, the bees are forced out. Now I\r\nwill candidly confess that I could never get this thing to work at all.\r\nOf this I am quite positive, that he (Mr. Colton) is either ignorant of\r\nthe necessary and regular preparations that bees make before swarming,\r\nor supposes others are. Mr. Weeks has advocated the same principle: he\r\nsays, \"There is no queen in any stage of existence, in the old stock,\r\nimmediately after the first swarm leaves it.\" I have examined this\r\nmatter till I am satisfied I risk but little in the bold assertion,\r\nthat not one stock in fifty will cast a swarm short of a week after\r\ncommencing preparations. This opinion will be adopted by whoever will\r\ntake the trouble to investigate for themselves. (The chapter on\r\nswarming will give the necessary instructions for examining this point,\r\nif you wish.)\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT TO BE DEPENDED UPON.\r\n\r\nFurther, these non-swarmers are not always to be depended upon as such.\r\nThey will sometimes throw off swarms when there is abundant room in the\r\nhive as well as in the boxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIVES NOT ALWAYS FULL BEFORE SWARMING.\r\n\r\nI know Weeks, Colton, Miner and others, tell us the hive _must be full_\r\nbefore we need expect a swarm; but experience is against them. Bees do\r\nsometimes cast a swarm before filling the hive. From close observation,\r\nI find when a hive is very large, say 4,000 cubic inches, and is filled\r\nwith comb, the first season, that such seldom swarm except in very good\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE OF HIVES NEEDED.\r\n\r\nBut if such hive is only half full, or 2,000 inches, it is very common\r\nfor them to swarm without adding any new comb; proving very\r\nconclusively that a hive that size, is sufficient for all their wants\r\nin the breeding season. When about 1,200 inches only had been filled\r\nthe first year, I have known them to add combs until they had filled\r\nabout 1,800, and then cast a swarm, proving also that a little less\r\nthan 2,000 will do for breeding. I have tested the principle of giving\r\nroom to prevent swarming, a little further.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of '47, I placed under five full hives, containing 2,000\r\nsolid or cubic inches, as many empty ones, the same size, without the\r\ntop. I had a swarm from each; but two had added any new comb, and these\r\nbut little. If these hives had been filled to the bottom with comb in\r\nthe spring, it is very doubtful whether either of them would have\r\nswarmed. The only place we can put a good stock and not expect it to\r\nswarm in good seasons, is inside a building, where it is perfectly\r\ndark, and even here a few have been known to do it. If we could manage\r\nto get _a very large hive_ filled with combs, it would perhaps be as\r\ngood a preventive as any. All the bees that could be reared in one\r\nseason, would have sufficient room in the combs ready made for their\r\nlabors, and there would be no necessity for their emigration. \"But what\r\nbecomes of all the bees raised in the course of several years?\" To this\r\nquestion I shall not probably be able to give a satisfactory answer at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEES DO NOT INCREASE, IF FULL, AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, IN SAME HIVE.\r\n\r\nI only will notice the fact, that the bees somehow disappear, and there\r\nis no more at the end of five years than at the end of one. A stock of\r\nbees may contain 6,000 the first of May, and raise 20,000 in the course\r\nof the year; by the first of the next May, as a general thing, not one\r\nmore will be found, even when no swarm had issued.\r\n\r\n\r\nGILLMORE'S SYSTEM DOUBTED.\r\n\r\nNow this fact is not known by a recent patentee from the State of\r\nMaine, (else he supposes others do not,) as he recommends placing bees\r\nin a house, and empty hives in connection with the one containing bees,\r\nand in a few years all will be full. He has discovered a mixture to\r\nfeed bees, (to be noticed hereafter); this may account for an unusual\r\nquantity being stored by an ordinary sized family. He said another\r\nthing, that is, each of these added hives would contain a queen! This\r\nwould seem to explain away the first difficulty of the continued\r\nincrease of bees, and so it would if it did not get into another\r\nequally erroneous; one error never made another true. This idea of bees\r\nraising a queen, merely because they have a side box to the main hive,\r\nis contrary to all my experience, and to the experience of all writers\r\n(except himself) that I have consulted. If the principle is correct,\r\nwhy not sometimes raise a queen in a box on the top or side for us? I\r\nnever discovered a single instance, where two perfect queens were\r\nquietly about their duties in connection with one hive. The deadly\r\nhostility of queens is known to all observing apiarians. Not having the\r\nleast faith in the principle, I will leave it.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTILITY OF MOTH-PROOF HIVES DOUBTED.\r\n\r\nAs for moth-proof hives, I have but little to say, as I have not the\r\nleast faith in one of them. When I come to speak of that insect, I will\r\nshow, I think, conclusively, that no place where bees are allowed to\r\nenter is safe from them.\r\n\r\nSeveral other _perfect hives_ might be mentioned; yet I believe that I\r\nhave noticed the principles of each. Have I not said enough? Such as\r\nare not satisfied now would not be if I filled a volume. Our view of\r\nthings is the result of a thousand various causes; the most powerful is\r\ninterest, or prejudice.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in Europe, the same ingenuity is displayed in twisting\r\nand torturing the bee, to adapt her natural instinct to unnatural\r\ntenements; tenements invented not because the bee needs them, but\r\nbecause this is a means available for a little change. \"Patent men\"\r\nhave found the people generally too ignorant of apiarian science. But\r\nlet us hope that their days of prosperity in this line are about\r\nnumbered.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTINCTS OF THE BEE ALWAYS THE SAME.\r\n\r\nLet us fully understand that the nature of the bee, when viewed under\r\nany condition, climate, or circumstance, is the same. Instincts first\r\nimplanted by the hand of the Creator, have passed through millions of\r\ngenerations, unimpaired, to the present day, and will continue\r\nunchanged through all future time, till the last bee passes from the\r\nearth. We may, we have, to gratify acquisitiveness, forced them to\r\nlabor under every disadvantage; yes, we have compelled them to\r\nsacrifice their industry, prosperity, and even their lives have been\r\nyielded, but never their instincts. We may destroy life, but cannot\r\nimprove or take from their nature. The laws that govern them are fixed\r\nand immutable as the Universe.\r\n\r\nSpring returns to its annual task; dissolves the frost, warms into life\r\nnature's dormant powers. Flowers with a smile of joy, expand their\r\ndelicate petals in grateful thanks, while the stamens sustain upon\r\ntheir tapering points the anthers covered with the fertilizing pollen,\r\nand the pistil springs from a cup of liquid nectar, imparting to each\r\npassing breeze delicious fragrance, inviting the bee as with a thousand\r\ntongues to the sumptuous banquet. She does not need an artificial\r\nstimulus from man, as an inducement to partake of the feast; without\r\nhis aid or assistance she visits each wasting cup of sweetness, and\r\nsecures the tiny drop, while the superabundant farina, dislodged from\r\nthe nodding anthers, covers her body, to be brushed together and\r\nkneaded into bread. All she requires at the hands of man, is a suitable\r\nstorehouse for her treasures. In good seasons, her nature Will prompt\r\nthe gathering for her own use an over supply. This surplus man may\r\nappropriate to his own use, without detriment to his bees, providing\r\nhis management is in accordance with their nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROFIT THE OBJECT.\r\n\r\nTo give the bees all necessary advantages, and obtain the greatest\r\npossible amount of profit, with the least possible expense, has been my\r\nstudy for years. I might keep a few stocks for amusement, even if it\r\nwas attended with no dollar and cent profit, but the number would be\r\n_very small_; I will honestly confess then, that _profit_ is the\r\nactuating principle with me. I have a strong suspicion that the\r\nmajority of readers have similar motives. I am sure, then, that all of\r\nus with these views, will consider it a pity, when a stock produces\r\nfive dollars worth of surplus honey, to be obliged to pay three or four\r\nof it for patent and other useless fixings.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON HIVE RECOMMENDED.\r\n\r\nI would not exchange the hive I have used for the last ten years for\r\nany patent I ever saw, if furnished gratis. I will guarantee that it\r\naffords means to obtain surplus honey, as much in quantity and in any\r\nway which fancy may dictate, whether in wood or glass, and what is more\r\nthan all, it shall cost nothing for the privilege of using.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE IMPORTANT.\r\n\r\nAfter deciding what kind of hive we want, the next important point is\r\nthe size. Dr. Bevan, an English author, recommends a size \"eleven and\r\nthree-eighths inches square, by nine deep in the clear,\" making only\r\nabout 1,200 inches, and so few pounds necessary to winter the bees,\r\nthat when I read it, I found myself wondering if the English inch and\r\npound were the same as ours.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL HIVES MORE LIABLE TO ACCIDENTS.\r\n\r\nAt all events, I think it too small for our Yankee bees in any place.\r\nWe must remember, that the queen needs room for all her eggs, and the\r\nbees need space to store their winter provisions; for reasons before\r\ngiven, this should be in one apartment. When this is too small, the\r\nconsequences will be, their winter supply of food is liable to run out.\r\nThe swarms from such will be smaller and the stock much more liable to\r\naccidents, which soon finish them off.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPT TO DECEIVE.\r\n\r\nYet I can imagine how one can be deceived by such a small hive, and\r\nrecommend it strongly; especially if patented. Suppose you locate a\r\nlarge swarm in a hive near the size of Dr. Bevan's; the bees would\r\noccupy nearly all the room with brood-combs; now if you put on boxes,\r\nand as soon as filled put on empty ones, the amount of surplus honey\r\nwould be great; very satisfactory for the first summer, but in a year\r\nor two your little hive is gone. This result will be in proportion as\r\nwe enlarge our hives, until we arrive at the opposite extreme.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNPROFITABLE IF TOO LARGE.\r\n\r\nIf too large, more honey will be stored than is required for their\r\nwinter use. It is evident a portion might have been taken, if it had\r\nbeen stored in boxes. The swarms will not be proportionably large when\r\nthey do issue, which is seldom--but there is this advantage, they last\r\na long time, and are but little profit in surplus honey, or swarms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRECT SIZE BETWEEN TWO EXTREMES.\r\n\r\nBetween the two extremes, like most other cases, is found the correct\r\nplace. A hive twelve inches square, each way, inside, has been\r\nrecommended as the correct size. Here are 1,728 cubic inches. This, I\r\nthink, is sufficient for many places, as the queen probably has all the\r\nroom necessary for depositing her eggs; and as the swarms are more\r\nnumerous, and nearly as large as from hives much larger; also, there is\r\nroom for honey sufficient to carry the bees through the winter, at\r\nleast, in many sections south of 40 degrees latitude, where the winter\r\nis somewhat short.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE FOR WARM LATITUDES.\r\n\r\nThis size will also do in this latitude (42 degrees,) in some seasons,\r\nbut not at all in others.[3] Not one swarm in fifty will consume\r\ntwenty-five lbs. of honey through the winter, that is, from the last of\r\n_September_ to the first of April, (six months). The average loss in\r\nthat time is about eighteen lbs.; but the critical time is later; about\r\nthe last of May, or first of June, in many places.\r\n\r\n      [3] When Mr. Miner wrote his manual recommending this size, 1,728\r\n      inches, for all situations, it should be remembered he lived on\r\n      Long Island. Since removing to Oneida County in this State,\r\n      either his own experience or _some other cause_ has changed his\r\n      views, as he now recommends my size, viz., 2,000 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGER HIVE MORE SAFE FOR LONG WINTERS OR BACKWARD SPRING.\r\n\r\nAbout the first of April they commence collecting pollen and rearing\r\ntheir young; by the middle of May all good stocks will occupy nearly,\r\nif not quite all, their brood-combs for that purpose, but _little honey\r\nis obtained_ before fruit blossoms appear; when these are gone, no more\r\nof any amount is obtained until clover appears, which is some ten days\r\nlater. (I am speaking now particularly of this section; I am aware it\r\nis very different in other places, where different flowers exist.) Now\r\nif this season of fruit flowers should be accompanied by high winds, or\r\ncold rainy weather, but little honey is obtained; and our bees have a\r\nnumerous brood on hand that _must be fed_. In this emergency, if no\r\nhoney is on hand of the previous year, a famine ensues; they destroy\r\ntheir drones, perhaps some of their brood, and for aught I know put the\r\nold bees on short allowance. This I do know, that the whole family has\r\nactually starved at this season; sometimes in small hives. This of\r\ncourse depends on the season; when favorable, nothing of the kind\r\noccurs. Prudence therefore dictates the necessity of a provision for\r\nthis emergency, by making the hive a little larger for northern\r\nlatitudes, as a little more honey will be stored to take them through\r\nthis critical period. From a series of experiments closely observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n2,000 INCHES SAFE FOR THIS SECTION.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that 2,000 inches in the clear, is the proper size for\r\nsafety in this section, and consequently, profit. On an average, swarms\r\nfrom this size are as large as any.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions should be uniform in all cases, whatever size is decided\r\non. It is folly to accommodate each swarm with a hive corresponding in\r\nsize; a very small family this year, may be very large next, and a very\r\nlarge one, very small, &c. A queen belonging to a small swarm will be\r\ncapable of depositing as many eggs, as another belonging to a barrel\r\nfull. A small family able to get through the winter and spring, may be\r\nexpected by another year to be as numerous as any.\r\n\r\n\r\nKIND OF WOOD, WIDTH OF BOARD, ETC.\r\n\r\nOf the kinds of wood for hives, pine is preferable, still other kinds\r\nwill do; I have no faith in bees liking one kind better than another,\r\nand less likely to leave on that account. Hemlock is cheaper, and used\r\nto a great extent; when _perfectly sound_ is as good as anything, but\r\nis very liable to split, even after the bees have been in them some\r\ntime. It should be used only when better wood cannot be obtained. Bass\r\nwood when used for hives should _always be painted_, and then will be\r\nvery liable to warp from the moisture arising from the bees inside.\r\nWhen not painted outside, and allowed to get wet, if only for a few\r\nhours, so much moisture is absorbed that it will bend outward, and\r\ncleave from the combs and crack them. A few days of dry weather will\r\nrelieve the outside of water, and the inside kept moist by the bees,\r\nthe bending will be reversed, and the combs pressed inward, keeping the\r\nbees fixing that which will not \"stay fixed.\" Perhaps there is wood as\r\nsuitable or better than pine, but it is not as common.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAPE OF NO CONSEQUENCE.\r\n\r\nBoards should be selected, if possible, that will be the proper width\r\nto make the hive about square, of the right size. Say twelve inches\r\nsquare, inside, by fourteen deep. I prefer this shape to any other, yet\r\nit is not all important. I have had some ten inches square by twenty in\r\nlength; they were awkward looking, but that was all, I could discover\r\nno difference in their prosperity. Also, I have had them twelve inches\r\ndeep by thirteen square, with the same result. Hence, if we avoid\r\nextremes, and give the required room, the shape can make but little\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nIt has been recommended to plane the boards for hives, \"inside and\r\nout;\" but bees, when first put into such hive, find much difficulty in\r\nholding fast until they get their combs started, hence this trouble is\r\nworse than useless.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR MAKING HIVES.\r\n\r\nIf hives are not desired of the cheapest possible construction, the\r\noutside may be planed and painted; but it is doubtful whether strict\r\neconomy would demand it. Yet a painted hive appears so much better,\r\nthat it ought to be done, especially as the paint adds almost enough to\r\nits durability to pay the expense. The color may be whatever fancy\r\ndictates; the moth will not probably be attracted by one color more\r\nthan another. White is affected the least by the sun in hot weather.\r\nLime is put on as white-wash, annually, by many, as a protection\r\nagainst insects.\r\n\r\nWhen hives are not painted, the grain should never be crosswise, having\r\nthe width of boards form the height; not that the bees would have any\r\ndislike to such, but nails will not hold firmly, they draw out in a few\r\nyears. The size, shape, materials, and manner of putting together, are\r\nnow sufficiently understood, for what I want. Sticks half an inch in\r\ndiameter, should cross each way through the centre, to help support the\r\ncombs. A hole about an inch diameter in the front side, half way to the\r\ntop, is a great convenience for the bees to enter when coming home\r\nheavy laden.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to make the top, cover, and boxes, (the bottom-board\r\nwill be described in another chapter.) The tops should be all alike;\r\nboards fifteen inches square are just the right size; three-fourths of\r\nan inch is the best thickness, (inch will do;) plane the upper side,\r\nrabbet out around the edge of the upper side one inch wide, and\r\nthree-eighths deep; this will leave the top inside the rabbeting, just\r\nthirteen inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE OF CAP AND BOXES.\r\n\r\nA box for a cover or cap, that size inside, will fit any hive. The\r\nheight of this box should be seven inches. Of course other sizes will\r\ndo, but it is best to commence with one that we can adhere to\r\nuniformly, and no vexations arise by covers not fitting exactly, &c. I\r\nthink this size is as near correct as we shall be likely to get; we\r\nwant all the room in the boxes that the majority of our stocks demand\r\nfor storing in a yield of honey,[4] at the same time not be\r\nnecessitated to give too much of the room in the height. They will\r\ncommence work in a box five inches high, much sooner than one seven or\r\neight. To give the requisite room, and have the boxes less than five\r\ninches high, would require more than thirteen inches on the top, this\r\nwould make the hive too much out of shape; it would appear top-heavy.\r\n\r\n      [4] I have added a side box occasionally, but it has seldom paid\r\n      me for the trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINER'S HIVE.\r\n\r\nMiner's Equilateral Hive has a cap somewhat smaller than this in\r\ndiameter; consequently, if we have the requisite room, it must be in\r\nits height. But by making the cap of his a little larger, and a few\r\ntrifling alterations, it would do very well for a patent. And if any\r\none _must_ have a patent hive, my advice is to get that; it costs but\r\ntwo dollars for the right of using, and is nearer what we want for\r\nbees, than any I ever saw. I prefer rabbeting around the edge of the\r\ntop, instead of nailing on a thin board the size of the inside of the\r\ncover, with room for a slide under it; it affords too nice a place for\r\nworms to spin their cocoons. Also, without the rabbeting water may get\r\nunder the cap, and pass along the top till a hole lets it among the\r\nbees. As for slides, I do not approve of them at all; in shutting off\r\ncommunication, it is almost certain to crush a few bees. This makes\r\nthem irritable for a week; they are unnecessary for me, at least. We\r\nwill now finish the hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR MAKING HOLES.\r\n\r\nAfter the top is got out as directed, strike a line through the centre,\r\nthree and a quarter inches from this, make another on each side, now\r\nmeasure on one of the last lines, two and a half inches for the first\r\nhole, two inches for the next, and so on till five are marked on this,\r\nand the same number on the other side, ten in all; these holes should\r\nbe about an inch diameter, a pattern three and a quarter inches wide,\r\nand thirteen in length, with places for holes marked on it, will save\r\ntime when many are made. When this top is nailed on, the hive is ready.\r\nA less number of holes is often used, and one is thought by some to be\r\nsufficient; experience has satisfied me that the more room bees have to\r\nenter boxes, the less reluctance is manifested in commencing their work\r\nin them; but here is another extreme to be avoided: when the holes are\r\nmuch larger, or more of them, or even one very large one, the queen is\r\nvery apt to go into the boxes and deposit her eggs, which renders the\r\ncomb tough, dark, &c., also bee-bread is stored near the brood. Dr.\r\nBevan's and Miner's cross-bar hives are objectionable on this account,\r\nthey offer too free access to the boxes; we want all the room that will\r\nanswer, and no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUGGESTION.\r\n\r\nMr. Miner's cross-bar hive is intended to make the bees construct all\r\nstraight combs, and probably will do it. But the disadvantage of\r\nbee-bread and brood in the boxes will not be made up by straight combs.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who have been made to believe straight combs\r\n_all important_, and perhaps have purchased the right to make the hive,\r\nand had some constructed, and have found bee-bread in their surplus\r\nhoney, I would suggest an improvement, (that is, if it is thought the\r\nstraight combs will pay. If you have not the right for the cross-bar\r\nhive, and you wish to use it, I would say, buy the right, and remove\r\nall grounds of complaint with him.) Put in the bars and hive your bees\r\nas he directs. After all the combs are started, instead of setting the\r\nopen bottom boxes (which are also unsuitable for sending to market)\r\ndirectly on the bars as he recommends, take off the cloth, and with\r\nscrews fasten on a top with ten holes, that I have just described; and\r\nthen you will have the straight combs, and surplus honey in the boxes\r\npure.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLASS BOXES PREFERRED.\r\n\r\nHaving told how I make a hive, I will now give some reasons for\r\npreferring a particular kind of boxes. I have taken great quantities of\r\nhoney to market, put up in every style, such as tumblers, glass jars,\r\nglass boxes, wooden boxes with glass ends, and boxes all wood. I have\r\nfound the square glass boxes the most profitable; the honey in such\r\nappears to the best possible advantage, so much so, that the majority\r\nof purchasers prefer paying for the box at the same rate as the honey,\r\nthan the wood box, and have the tare allowed. This rate of selling\r\nboxes always pays the cost, while we get nothing for the wood. Another\r\nadvantage in this kind of boxes is, while being filled, the progress\r\ncan be watched, and the time they are finished known precisely, when\r\nthey should be taken off, as every day they remain after that, soils\r\nthe purity of the combs.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLASS BOXES--HOW TO MAKE.\r\n\r\n_Directions for making._--Select half-inch boards of pine or other soft\r\nlight wood, cut the length twelve and three-quarters inches, width six\r\nand three-eighths inches, dress down the thickness to three-eighths or\r\nless, two pieces for a box, top and bottom, in the bottom bore five\r\nholes throughout the centre to match with those in the top of the hive,\r\n(the pattern used in marking the top of hives is just the one to mark\r\nthese). Next, get out the corner posts, five-eighths of an inch square,\r\nand five inches in length; with a saw, thick enough to fit the glass,\r\ncut a channel length-wise on two sides, one-fourth of an inch deep,\r\none-eighth from the corner, for the glass. A small lath nail through\r\neach corner of the bottom into the posts will hold them; it is now\r\nready for the glass--10×12 is the right size to get--have them cut\r\nthrough the centre the longest way for the sides, and they are right,\r\nand again the other way, five and five-eighths long for the ends. These\r\ncan now be slipped into the channels of the posts, and the top nailed\r\non like the bottom, and the box is ready.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUIDE-COMBS NECESSARY.\r\n\r\nIt will be found a great advantage, previous to nailing on the top, to\r\nstick fast to it some pieces of guide-combs in the direction you wish\r\nthe bees to work. They are also an inducement for them to commence\r\nseveral days sooner, than if they had to start combs for themselves;[5]\r\na piece an inch square will do; it is well to start every comb you want\r\nin the box; two inches apart is about the right distance to look well.\r\nTo make these pieces hold fast, melt one edge by the fire, or candle,\r\nor melt some bees-wax, and dip one edge in that, and apply it before\r\ncooling; with a little practice you can make them stick without\r\ndifficulty. For a supply of such combs, save all empty, clean, white\r\npieces you can, when removing combs from a hive.\r\n\r\n      [5] A line of bees-wax made with a guide-plate, or other means,\r\n      is found to be of but little use.\r\n\r\nIf you have any way superior to this for making glass boxes, so much\r\nthe better, make them so by all means: \"The best way is as good as\r\nany.\" I give my method to be used only when better is not convenient.\r\nIf you sell honey, I think you will find it an advantage to have glass\r\nboxes made in some way. Two of this size when full weigh 25 lbs. If\r\npreferred, four boxes six and three-eighths inches square, can be used\r\nfor a hive instead of two; the expense of making is a little more for\r\nthe same number of lbs., yet, when it is in market, a few customers\r\nwill prefer this size.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOD BOXES.\r\n\r\nFor home consumption, the wood-box will answer equally well for all\r\npurposes of obtaining the honey, but will give no chance to watch the\r\nprogress of the bees, unless a glass is inserted for the purpose, and\r\nthen it will need a door to keep it dark, or a cover over the whole\r\nlike the one for glass boxes, may be put on. Wood boxes are generally\r\nmade with open bottom, and set on the top of the hive. A passage for\r\nthe bees out of the box to the open air is unnecessary, and worse than\r\nuseless. They like to store their honey as far from the entrance as\r\npossible. Unless crowded for room, they will not store much there when\r\nsuch entrances are made.\r\n\r\nWhether we intend to consume our surplus honey or not, it is as well to\r\nhave the hives and covers made in a manner that we can use glass, when\r\nwe are likely to have some to spare. I am not sure, but it would pay to\r\nmake hives in this way, even if glass boxes were never used; the\r\nrabbeting prevents light as well as water from passing under the cover;\r\nimagine a box set on a plain board nailed on for a top, without the\r\nrabbeting; the warping or bending admits the light and water,\r\nespecially when hives are out in the weather, (and I shall not\r\nrecommend any other way of keeping them.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCOVER FOR HIVES.\r\n\r\nI have termed the cap or box a cover; but this should also be covered\r\nwith a board laid on, if nothing else. A good roof for each hive can be\r\nmade by fastening two boards together like the roof of a building; let\r\nit be about 18 by 24 inches; it being loose, can be changed in\r\naccordance with the season; in spring, let the sun strike the hive; but\r\nin hot weather let the longest end project over the south side, &c. You\r\ncan ornament this hive, if you choose, by mouldings or dentals, under\r\nthe top, where it projects over the body of the hive, also the cap can\r\nhave the top projected a little and receive the same addition.\r\n\r\n\r\nJARS AND TUMBLERS--HOW PREPARED.\r\n\r\nWhen jars, tumblers, or other vessels, that are all glass, are used, it\r\nis _absolutely necessary_ to fasten as many pieces of combs as you wish\r\nmade, in the top, for a beginning, or fasten a piece of wood there; as\r\nthey seldom commence building on glass, without a start.\r\n\r\nSome of you may have seen paraded at our fairs, or in the public parts\r\nof some of our cities, hives containing tumblers, some of them neatly\r\nfilled, others empty, and this meagre sentence written upon them, _not\r\nto be filled_! Pretending to govern the bees, as the juggler sometimes\r\ndoes his tricks, by mysterious incantations! I once encountered an\r\nagent of this humbug, and modestly suggested to him that I had a\r\ncounter charm: that I could put a tumbler on his hive and it would be\r\nfilled if the others were, however much he might forbid it by written\r\ncharms! He saw at a glance how the matter stood; I was not the customer\r\nhe wanted, and intimated that the show was only intended for the\r\nextreme verdancy of most visitors. It no doubt assisted in displaying\r\nhis profound knowledge in bee management, which he wished to establish,\r\nas he had a little work on the subject to sell, also hives, and bees.\r\nThe reader no doubt will guess as I did, the reason that those tumblers\r\nwere not filled, was because no combs were put in for a start.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFECT OBSERVATORY HIVE DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\nThere are many things pertaining to bees that cannot be properly\r\nexamined and understood, without a glass hive of some sort. Yet a\r\nperfect observatory hive containing but one comb, is not a perfect hive\r\nfor the bees. We can see very well what the bees are doing, but it is\r\nnot a tenement they would choose if left to themselves. It forces them\r\nto labor in an unnatural manner, is unsuitable for wintering bees, and\r\notherwise but little profit. If the satisfaction of witnessing some of\r\ntheir operations more perfectly than in glass hives of another kind\r\nwill not pay, it is doubtful if we get it. I will describe as briefly\r\nas possible. Two frames or sashes about two and a half feet square,\r\ncontaining glass, are so fastened together as to leave room for only\r\none comb between them, about an inch and three-fourths apart. A comb of\r\nthis size will not support itself by the top and edges; hence, it is\r\nnecessary to put in numerous cross-bars to assist in supporting it.\r\nOutside the glass are doors to keep the whole dark, to be opened when\r\nwe wish to inspect proceedings. Under the bottom is a board or frame,\r\nto keep it in an upright position, &c. Probably but few will be induced\r\nto make one. I will therefore describe another; a hive that I think\r\nwill pay better.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE LIKE COMMON HIVE PREFERRED.\r\n\r\nIf we expect to know what bees are doing in ordinary hives, we must\r\nhave one similar in every respect, in size, shape, number of bees, &c.\r\nThe construction of royal cells will be watched by most observers with\r\nthe greatest interest; now these are generally on one edge of the\r\ncombs. The bees leave a space half an inch or more between the edges of\r\nthe combs and one side of the hive, near half the length of it,\r\napparently for no other purpose but to have room for these cells, as\r\nthe other edges of the same combs are generally attached to the hive at\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT MAY BE SEEN.\r\n\r\nNow instead of having one piece or pane of glass in the side of several\r\nhives, I would recommend having one or more with glass on every side;\r\nbecause we might have it on three sides, and not the fourth; and this\r\nmight contain all the queen cells, and we should miss an important\r\nsight. There are many other things to be witnessed in such a hive. The\r\nqueen may be often seen depositing her eggs! We may see the workers\r\ndetach the scales of wax from their abdomen, and apply them to the\r\ncombs during the process of construction, see them deposit pollen from\r\ntheir legs, store their honey, feed the queen, each other, their young\r\nbrood, seal over cells containing brood, honey, &c. It is further\r\nuseful as a guide for putting boxes on other hives, (that is, if it is\r\na good one, which it should be); we can easily ascertain whether our\r\nbees are gaining or losing.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR MAKING GLASS HIVE.\r\n\r\nMy method of making them is as follows: The top is like those for other\r\nhives, fifteen inches square, adapted to boxes and cover. This hive we\r\nwant to be as profitable as any, giving us surplus honey, and swarms\r\nlike others. Four posts are then got out, two inches square, and\r\nthirteen in length; care should be taken to have the ends perfectly\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\nA frame is then to be made, just fourteen inches square outside, for\r\nthe bottom; the pieces are one inch thick, by two in width, halved\r\ntogether at the corners. A guage-mark is then made around the under\r\nside of the top, half an inch from the edge, a post is then set inside\r\nof each corner of this mark, and thoroughly nailed, the bottom is\r\nnailed on with the posts even with the outside corners. Four pieces an\r\ninch thick, and an inch and a half wide, are fitted between the posts,\r\neven with the guage-mark on the top. Sixteen strips, about one quarter\r\nby half an inch, are got out, eight to be ten, and eight twelve inches\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nA gauge-mark one inch from posts, bottom, &c., is the place to nail\r\nthese strips; very small nails or tacks will hold them. The panes of\r\nglass are to rest against them, which are held in their places by small\r\npieces of tin, or brads. The doors are the size of the glass, 10×12,\r\nabout three-fourths of an inch thick; these doors are cut a little too\r\nshort, and the pieces, to prevent warping, are nailed on the ends;\r\nthese are hung to a post on one side, and secured by a button on the\r\nother. On two opposite sides inside the posts, half way up, two strips,\r\nhalf an inch by three quarters, are nailed, with holes in them for the\r\ncross-sticks; one way is enough if you have guide-combs for a start,\r\nlike those recommended for boxes, so that the sheets will be at right\r\nangles with them; otherwise, let the sticks cross both ways, about\r\nthree each way will be needed, as the glass at the edges is not so good\r\na support as wood.\r\n\r\nThe cap can be made of half inch boards; the top to project over like\r\nthe hive, or let it be a little more than half an inch, it will admit a\r\nheavier moulding, which should surround it here, as well as at the top\r\nof the hive, or if it is prefered, dentals can be used, and look\r\nequally well--when no ornament is wanted, omit it. But painting seems\r\nnecessary for such hives, to prevent warping, and the swelling of the\r\ndoors in wet weather; these want to open and shut without rubbing or\r\nsticking, otherwise we disturb the bees every time a door is stirred.\r\nPutty should not be used to hold the glass, as the bees in the course\r\nof a few years will cover it with propolis; it is then necessary to\r\ntake it out, and scrape, clean, and return it, when, if fastened with\r\nputty, it would be difficult; cold weather is the time for this\r\noperation. I am aware that a hive can be more substantially made than\r\nthe one here described; but I have endeavored to make one as cheap as\r\npossible, and if properly made, will answer. The cost will be much less\r\nthan many patents, and the satisfaction much more, at least, with many.\r\nWhen our hive contains a swarm of bees, and they are thoroughly in\r\noperation, we must not let them pass out at the bottom on every side,\r\nas they are frequently allowed to do from other hives; because, should\r\none come out a little excited in consequence of a slight jar,\r\naccidentally given the hive, on opening the door or some other way, and\r\nshould find our face within a foot of their house, peering in the\r\nwindow among their works, it would be very likely to give us _a gentle\r\nhint_ that it was a mark of low breeding, that we were not wanted there\r\nat all, and that it was none of our business what they were doing. To\r\nprevent this as far as possible, a bottom-board, somewhat different\r\nfrom the common one, is needed. Four posts of chestnut or other lasting\r\nwood, about two inches square, are driven into the earth in the form of\r\na square, far enough apart to come under the corners of the\r\nbottom-board, (fifteen inches,) and high enough for convenience when\r\nlooking into the hive. The ends of these posts are to be perfectly\r\nlevel, and to which the bottom is to be nailed fast. As the hive is to\r\nsit perfectly close to the board, a passage must be made through it, as\r\nwell as means for ventilation in hot weather, without raising the hive\r\nfor that purpose. It requires a board about fifteen inches square,\r\nplaned smooth, the ends clamped to prevent warping or splitting; a\r\nportion of the centre is taken out, say six inches by ten, and wire\r\ncloth nailed over, four-ounce tacks will hold it, fasten it just enough\r\nto keep the bees from getting through; very likely it will want to be\r\ntaken off occasionally and cleaned from the propolis that will be\r\nspread over it. It is easiest done in freezing weather.\r\n\r\nTake an edge in each hand, and rock the wires a few times out of\r\nsquare, and it will readily crumble and fall out. In warm weather it\r\nmust be scalded or burnt off. To close this space, a moving slide is\r\nfixed in grooves under-side, fastened to the posts or board. The slide\r\nis to be moved in accordance with the weather, when cold, close it,\r\nwhen hot, withdraw it, and give the bees as much air as possible,\r\nwithout raising the hive, the whole of such space is as much\r\nventilation as ordinary hives raised an inch. (Wire cloth is needed for\r\nother purposes, it is best to procure some, even at considerable\r\ntrouble and expense.) On the side of the board intended for the front,\r\ntwo inches from the edge of the wire cloth, a passage is cut for the\r\nbees, three-eights of an inch wide, by eleven in length. \"But how is\r\nthe bees to get to this place, so inconvenient, something is needed to\r\nassist them?\" Certainly, Sir; an alighting board, eleven inches wide,\r\nand about two feet long, (not planed), is placed at an angle of\r\nforty-five degrees, between the two front posts of your stand, the\r\nupper end passing under the bottom, far enough back; to be just even\r\nwith the back-side of the passage for the bees. The bees alight on this\r\nboard, and walk up into the hive without difficulty. When the bees are\r\nat work pretty freely, and a door of this hive is opened, those that\r\nare about departing will be very likely to get on the glass, instead of\r\nthrough the opening at the bottom; seeing the light through the glass,\r\nthey endeavor to escape by the nearest route. When so many gather here\r\nas to prevent a good view, and you wish to observe further, shut the\r\ndoor a moment and they will leave through their own passage, when you\r\ncan open your door again, for a short time. After the hive is filled\r\nwith combs, the number attracted to the glass on opening a door will be\r\nmuch less.\r\n\r\nThe plate on the preceding page represents a glass hive, cover, and\r\nstand. The common hive can be made equally ornamental, if you choose;\r\nthis kind of stand is unnecessary for them. I use such as are\r\nrecommended on page 138.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nBREEDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPERFECTLY UNDERSTOOD.\r\n\r\nThe time that bees commence raising their young brood is but\r\nimperfectly understood by most people. Many persons that have kept them\r\nfor years, have bestowed so little attention on this point, that they\r\nare unable to tell at what time they commence, how they progress, or\r\nwhen they cease. A kind of an idea that one swarm, and occasionally two\r\nor three, are reared sometime in June, or fore part of summer, is about\r\nthe extent of their reflections on the subject. Whether the drones\r\ndeposit the eggs, or that a portion of the workers are females, and\r\neach raise a young one or two, or whether the \"king bee\" is the chap\r\nfor laying eggs, is a matter beyond their ability to answer. It is but\r\na few years since, that a correspondent of a Journal of Agriculture\r\ndenied the existence of a queen bee, giving the best reasons he had, no\r\ndoubt, that is, he had never seen one. But bee-keepers of this class\r\nare so few, it is unnecessary to waste time to convince them; suffice\r\nit to say, that a queen exists with every prosperous swarm, and all\r\napiarians with much pretensions to science, acknowledge the fact, also,\r\nthat she is the mother of the whole family.\r\n\r\nThe period at which they commence depositing eggs probably depends on\r\nthe strength of the colony, amount of honey on hand, &c., and not the\r\ntime they commence gathering food.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOD STOCK SELDOM WITHOUT BROOD.\r\n\r\nI once removed the bees from a hive on the tenth of January, and found\r\nbrood amounting to about five hundred, sealed over, and others in every\r\nstage of growth down to the egg.\r\n\r\nThis hive had been in the house, and kept warm; it will doubtless be\r\nsupposed that being kept warm was the cause; but this is not a solitary\r\ninstance. A neighbor lost a hive the fourteenth February, in weather\r\ncold enough to seal the entrance with ice, and smother the bees. I\r\nassisted to remove the combs, and found young brood in abundance, from\r\nthe perfect bee, through all stages of growth. This stock had been in\r\nthe cold all winter. I have further noticed, when sweeping out the\r\nlitter under the hives early in spring, say the first of March, that\r\nyoung bees would often be found under the best stocks. Hence it appears\r\nthere is but little time, and perhaps none, when our best stocks have\r\nno broods. Yet stocks, when very weak, do not commence till warm\r\nweather. It seems that a certain degree of warmth is necessary to\r\nperfect the brood, which a small family cannot generate.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW SMALL STOCKS COMMENCE.\r\n\r\nThe first eggs are deposited in the centre of the cluster of bees, in a\r\nsmall family; it may not be in the centre of the hive in _all_ cases;\r\nbut the middle of the cluster is the warmest place, wherever located.\r\nHere the queen will first commence; a few cells, or a space not larger\r\nthan a dollar, is first used, those exactly opposite on the same comb\r\nare next occupied. If the warmth of the hive will allow, whether mild\r\nweather produces it, or the family be large enough to generate that\r\nwhich is artificial, appears to make no difference; she will then take\r\nthe next combs exactly corresponding with the first commencement but\r\nnot quite as large a place is used as in the first comb. The circle of\r\neggs in the first is then enlarged, and more are added in the next,\r\n&c., continuing to spread to the next combs, keeping the distance to\r\nthe outside of the circle of eggs, to the centre or place of beginning,\r\nabout equal on all sides, until they occupy the outside comb. Long\r\nbefore the outside comb is occupied, the first eggs deposited are\r\nmatured, and the queen will return to the centre, and use these cells\r\nagain, but is not so particular this time to fill so many in such exact\r\norder as at first. This is the general process of small or medium sized\r\nfamilies. I have removed the bees from such, in all stages of breeding,\r\nand always found their proceedings as described.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT WITH LARGER ONES.\r\n\r\nBut with very large families, their proceedings are different: as any\r\npart of the cluster of bees is warm enough for breeding, there is less\r\nnecessity for economizing heat, and having all the eggs confined to one\r\nsmall spot, some unoccupied cells will be found among the brood; a few\r\nwill contain honey and bee-bread.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW POLLEN IS STORED IN THE BREEDING SEASON.\r\n\r\nBut in the height of the breeding season, a circle of cells nearly all\r\nbee-bread, an inch or two wide, will border the sheets of comb\r\ncontaining brood. As bee-bread is probably the principal food of the\r\nyoung bee, it is thus very convenient.\r\n\r\nWhen pollen is abundant, and the swarm is in prosperous condition, they\r\nsoon reach the outside sheets of comb with the brood. At this period,\r\nwhen the hive is about full, and the queen is forced to the outside\r\ncombs to find a place for her eggs, it is interesting to witness\r\noperations in a glass hive. I have seen her several times during one\r\nday, on the same piece of comb (next the glass). The light has no\r\nimmediate effect on her \"Highness,\" as she will quietly continue about\r\nher duty, not the least embarrassed by curious eyes at the window.\r\nBefore depositing an egg, she enters the cell head first, probably to\r\nascertain if it is in proper condition to receive it; as a cell part\r\nfilled with bee-bread or honey is never used. If the area of combs is\r\nsmall, or the family is small, and cannot protect a large space with\r\nthe necessary heat, she will often deposit two, and sometimes three, in\r\none cell (the supernumeraries I suppose are removed by the workers).\r\nBut under prosperous circumstances, with a hive of suitable size, &c.,\r\nthis emergency is avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPERATION OF LAYING AND THE EGGS DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\nWhen a cell is in a condition to receive the egg, on withdrawing her\r\nhead she immediately curves her abdomen, and inserts it a few seconds.\r\nAfter leaving it, an egg may be seen attached by one end to the bottom;\r\nabout the sixteenth of an inch in length, slightly curved, very small,\r\nnearly uniform the whole length, abruptly rounded at the ends,\r\nsemi-transparent, and covered with a very thin and extremely delicate\r\ncoat, often breaking with the slightest touch.\r\n\r\nAfter the egg has been about three days in the cell, a small white worm\r\nmay be seen coiled in the bottom, surrounded with a milky-like\r\nsubstance, which is its food, without doubt. How this food is prepared,\r\nis merely guess-work. The hypothesis of its being chiefly composed of\r\npollen, I have no objection to; as it is sufficiently proved by the\r\nquantities that accumulate in hives that lose their queen, and rear no\r\nbrood (that is, when a requisite number of workers are so left). The\r\nworkers may be seen entering the cell every few minutes, probably, to\r\nsupply this food.[6]\r\n\r\n      [6] When the comb in our glass hive is new, and white, these\r\n      operations can be seen more distinctly than when very old and\r\n      dark.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME FROM THE EGG TO THE PERFECT BEE.\r\n\r\nIn about six days it is sealed over with a convex waxen lid. It is now\r\nhidden from our sight for about twelve days, when it bites off the\r\ncover, and comes forth a perfect bee. The period from the egg to the\r\nperfect bee varies from twenty to twenty-four days; average about\r\ntwenty-two for workers, twenty-four for drones. The temperature of the\r\nhive will vary some with the atmosphere; it is also governed by the\r\nnumber of bees. A low temperature probably retards the development,\r\nwhile a high one facilitates it. You may have seen accounts of the\r\nassiduous attentions given to the young bee when it first emerges from\r\nthe cell: 'tis said they \"lick it all over, feed it with honey,\" &c.,\r\ndesperately pleased with their new acquisition.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUGH TREATMENT OF THE YOUNG BEE.\r\n\r\nNow, if you expect to see anything of this, you must watch a little\r\ncloser than I have. I have seen hundreds when biting their way out.\r\nInstead of care or notice, they often receive rather rough treatment:\r\nthe workers, intent on other matters, will sometimes come in contact\r\nwith one part way out the cell, with force sufficient to almost\r\ndislocate its neck; yet they do not stop to see if any harm is done, or\r\nbeg pardon. The little sufferer, after this rude lesson, scrambles back\r\nas soon as possible out of the way; enlarges the prison door a little,\r\nand attempts again, with perhaps the same success: a dozen trials are\r\noften made before they succeed. When it does actually leave, it seems\r\nlike a stranger in a multitude, with no friend to counsel, or mother to\r\ndirect. It wanders about uncared for and unheeded, and rarely finds one\r\nsufficiently benevolent to bestow even the necessaries of life; but\r\ndoes sometimes. It is _generally_ forced to learn the important lesson\r\nof looking out for itself, the day it leaves the cradle. A cell\r\ncontaining honey is sought for, where its immediate wants are all\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUESS WORK.\r\n\r\nThe time before it is ready to leave the hive for honey, I might guess\r\nwould be two or three days. Others have said \"it would leave _the day\r\nit left the cell_;\" but I guess they guess at this point. They tell us,\r\ntoo, that after the bees seal over the cells containing the larvæ,\r\n\"they immediately commence spinning their cocoons, which takes just\r\nabout thirty-six hours.\" I think it very likely; but when I admit it, I\r\ncannot imagine how it was ascertained;--the faculty of looking through\r\na mill-stone I do not possess, and it requires about the same optical\r\npenetration to look into one of these cells after it is sealed over, as\r\nit is all perfect darkness. Suppose we drive away the bees and open the\r\ncell, to give us a look at the interior: the little insect stops its\r\nlabor in a moment, probably from the effect of air and light. I never\r\ncould detect one in its labor. Suppose we open these cells every hour\r\nafter sealing; can we tell anything about their progress by the\r\nappearance of these cocoons, or even tell when they are finished? The\r\nthickness of a dozen would not exceed common writing paper. When a\r\nsubject is obscure, or difficult to ascertain, like this, why not tell\r\nus how they found out the particulars; and if they were guessed at, be\r\nhonest, and say so? When the bee leaves the cell, a cocoon remains, and\r\nthat is about all we _know_ about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS APPLIED TO YOUNG BEES.\r\n\r\nThe young bee, when it first leaves the egg, is termed grub, maggot,\r\nworm, or larva; from this state it changes to the shape of the perfect\r\nbee, which is said to be three days after finishing the cocoon; from\r\nthe time of this change, till it is ready to leave the cell, the terms\r\nnymph, pupa, and chrysalis, are applied. The lid of the drone's cell is\r\nrather more convex than that of the worker's, and when removed by the\r\nyoung bee to work its way out, is left nearly perfect; being cut off\r\naround the edges, a good coat or lining of silk keeps it whole; while\r\nthe covering of the worker's cell is mostly wax, and is pretty well cut\r\nto pieces by the time the bee gets out. The covering to the queen's\r\ncell is like the drone's, but larger in diameter, and thicker, being\r\nlined with a little more silk.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCREPANCY IN TIME IN REARING BROOD AS GIVEN BY HUBER.\r\n\r\nWe are told by most writers, the period of time necessary to perfect\r\nfrom the egg, the three different kinds of bees. Huber leads the way,\r\nand the rest, _supposing him to be right_, repeat in substance his\r\naccount as follows: That the whole time necessary to perfect a queen\r\nfrom the egg is sixteen days, the worker twenty, and the drone\r\ntwenty-four days; Huber (as quoted by Harpers) gives the time of each\r\nstage of development belonging to each kind of bee; but is rather\r\nunfortunate in arithmetic; the items, or stages, when added together,\r\n\"do not prove,\" as the school-boys say; that is, he gains time by\r\nmaking his bee by degrees. He says, first, of the worker, \"It remains\r\nthree days in the egg, five in the grub state, it is thirty-six hours\r\nin spinning its cocoon; in three days it changes to a nymph, passes six\r\nin that form, and then comes forth a perfect bee.\" How do the items add?\r\n\r\n    The egg,              3     days.\r\n    Grub,                 5      \"\r\n    Spinning cocoon,      1-1/2  \"\r\n    Changing to a nymph,  3      \"\r\n    In that form,         6      \"\r\n                       -------\r\n                        18-1/2  days.\r\n\r\nOne and a half days short. We will next see how the figures with the\r\nroyal insect match; recollect sixteen days are all she has allowed;\r\nthen, of the different stages, \"three days in the egg, is five a worm,\r\nwhen the bees close its cell, and it immediately begins its cocoon,\r\nwhich is finished in twenty-four hours. During eleven days, and even\r\nsixteen hours of the twelfth, it remains in a state of complete repose.\r\nIts transformation into a nymph then takes place, in which state four\r\ndays and part of the fifth are passed.\" Now let us add the items:\r\n\r\n    The egg,                                   3     days.\r\n    A worm,                                    5       \"\r\n    Spinning a cocoon, (24 hours),             1       \"\r\n    Reposes eleven days and 16 hours,         11-2/3   \"\r\n    A nymph four days, and part of the fifth,  4-1/3   \"\r\n                                             -------\r\n                                              25     days.\r\n\r\nNow, reader, what do you make of such palpable blundering guess-work? A\r\ndifference of nine days--the merest school-boy ought to know better!\r\nCan we rely on such history? Does it not prove the necessity of going\r\nover the whole ground, applying a test to every assertion, and a\r\nrevision of the whole matter throughout? My object is not to find\r\nfault, but to get at _facts_. When I see such guess-work as the above\r\npublished to the world, in this enlightened age, gravely told to the\r\nrising generation, as a portion of natural history, I feel it a duty\r\nnot to resist the inclination to expose the absurdity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NUMBER OF EGGS DEPOSITED BY THE QUEEN GUESSED AT.\r\n\r\nThe number of eggs that a queen will deposit is often another point of\r\nguess-work. When the estimate does not exceed 200 per diem, I have no\r\nreason to dispute it; the number will probably fall short in some\r\ncases, and exceed it in others. Some writers suppose that this number\r\n\"would never produce a swarm, as the bees that are lost daily amount\r\nto, or even exceed that number,\" and give us instead from eight hundred\r\nto four thousand eggs in a day, from one queen. The only way to test\r\nthe matter accurately, is by actually counting, in an observatory hive,\r\nor in one with sufficient empty combs to hold _all the eggs_ she will\r\ndeposit for a few days, when, by removing the bees, and counting\r\ncarefully, we might ascertain, and yet several would have to be\r\nexamined, before we could get at the average. The nearest I ever came\r\nto knowing anything about it happened as follows: A swarm left, and the\r\nqueen from some cause was unable to cluster with it, and was found,\r\nafter some trouble, in the grass a few rods off. She was put in the\r\nhive with the swarm about 11 o'clock, A.M.; the next morning, at\r\nsunrise, I found on the bottom-board, among the scales of wax, 118 eggs\r\nthat had been discharged in that time. Probably a few escaped notice,\r\nas the color is the same as wax scales; also, they might already have\r\nhad combs containing some. I have several times found a few the next\r\nmorning, under swarms hived the day previous, but never over thirty,\r\nexcept in this one instance. The reason of this queen not being able to\r\nfly well might have been an unusual burden of eggs. Perhaps it would be\r\nas well to mention here, that in all cases where eggs are found in this\r\nway, that they must be first swarms which are accompanied by the old\r\nqueens.\r\n\r\nSchirach estimates \"the eggs a single female will lay, from 70,000 to\r\n100,000 in a season.\" Reaumer and Huber do not estimate so high.\r\nAnother writer estimates 90,000, in three months. Let the number be as\r\nit may, probably thousands are never perfected. During the spring\r\nmonths, in medium and small families, where the bees can protect with\r\nanimal heat but a few combs, I have often found cells containing a\r\nplurality of eggs, two, three, and occasionally four, in a single cell.\r\nThese supernumeraries must be removed, and frequently may be found\r\namongst the dust on the bottom-board.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TEST FOR THE PRESENCE OF A QUEEN.\r\n\r\nIf you have a hive that you suspect has lost a queen at this season,\r\nher presence can be ascertained nine times in ten by this method. Sweep\r\noff the board clean, and look the next day or two after for these eggs.\r\nTake care that ants, or mice, have no chance to get them; they might\r\ndeceive you, being as fond of eggs for breakfast as anyone.[7] When one\r\nor more is found, or any immature bees, it is sufficient, no further\r\nproof of the presence of a queen is needed.\r\n\r\n      [7] It is said that the bees will devour these eggs also.\r\n\r\nAnother portion of eggs is wasted whenever a supply of their food\r\nfails; if we remove the bees from a stock during a scarcity, when the\r\nhive is light, we will be very likely to find hundreds of eggs in the\r\ncells, and but very few advancing from that stage towards maturity. I\r\nhave thus found it in the fall, in July, and sometimes the first of\r\nJune, or at any time when maturing the brood would be likely to exhaust\r\ntheir stores, to endanger the family's supply. Now, instead of the\r\nfertility of the queen being greater in spring and first of summer than\r\nat other times, (as we are often told), I would suggest the probability\r\nthat a greater abundance of food at this season, and a greater number\r\nof empty cells, may be the reason of the greater number of bees\r\nmatured.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN DRONES ARE REARED.\r\n\r\nWhenever the hive is well supplied with honey, and plenty of bees, a\r\nportion of eggs are deposited in the drone-cells, which three or four\r\ndays more are necessary to mature than the worker.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN QUEENS ARE REARED.\r\n\r\nAlso, when the combs become crowded with bees, and honey plenty, the\r\npreparations for young queens commence: as the first step towards\r\nswarming, from one to twenty royal cells are begun; when about half\r\ncompleted, the queen (if all continues favorable) will deposit eggs in\r\nthem, these will be glued fast by one end like those for the workers;\r\nthere is no doubt but they are precisely the same kind of eggs that\r\nproduce other bees. When hatched, the little worm will be supplied with\r\na superabundance of food; at least, it appears so from the fact, that a\r\nfew times I have found a quantity remaining in the cell after the queen\r\nhad left. The consistence of this food is about like cream, the color\r\nsome lighter, or just tinged with yellow. If it was thin like water, or\r\neven honey, I cannot imagine how it could be made to stay in the upper\r\nend of an inverted cell of that size in such quantities as are put in,\r\nas the bees often fill it near half full. Sometimes a cell of this kind\r\nwill contain this food, and no worm to feed upon it. I _guessed_ the\r\nbees had compounded more than their present necessities required, and\r\nthat they stored it there to have it ready, also, that being there all\r\nmight know it was for royalty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE OF THE THREE KINDS OF CELLS.]\r\n\r\nThe taste is said to be \"more pungent\" than food given to the worker,\r\nand the difference in food changes the bee from a worker to a queen. I\r\nhave nothing to say against this hypothesis; it may be so, or the young\r\nbee being obliged to stand on its head may effect it, or both causes\r\ncombined may effect the change. I never tasted this food, or found any\r\ntest to apply.\r\n\r\nThe preceding plate represents a piece of comb containing all the\r\ndifferent cells--those at the left hand the size for drones. In the\r\ncentre are few that appear sealed over, others nearly covered, others\r\nthe larva in different stages of growth, as well as the eggs. _Fig. 1_\r\nrepresents a queen's cell just commenced. They are usually started thus\r\nfar the first season, very frequently when the hive is only half or\r\ntwo-thirds full. _Fig. 2_ is a cell sufficiently advanced to receive\r\nthe egg. _Fig. 3_ one finished, the stage when the first swarm leaves.\r\n_Fig. 4_ when a queen has been perfected and left. _Fig. 5_ is a cell\r\nwhere its occupant has been destroyed by a rival, and removed by the\r\nworkers. It will be perceived that each finished queen's cell contains\r\nas much wax as fifty made for the workers.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIABILITY OF BEING DESTROYED.\r\n\r\nIn any stage from the egg to maturity these royal insects are liable to\r\nbe destroyed;--if honey fails from any cause sufficient to make the\r\nexistence of a swarm any way hazardous, the preparations are abandoned,\r\nand these young queens destroyed; (I would here request the reader not\r\nto condemn me for telling more than I can prove, until he has had the\r\nwhole story; in the swarming season, I will give further particulars.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDRONES DESTROYED WHEN HONEY IS SCARCE.\r\n\r\nWhen an occurrence like the above happens, the drones next fall victims\r\nto the failure of honey. A brief existence only is theirs; such as are\r\nperfect, are destroyed without mercy; those in the chrysalis state are\r\noften dragged out, and sacrificed to the necessities of the family.\r\nSuch as are allowed to hatch, instead of being fed and protected as\r\nthey would be if honey was abundant, are allowed, while yet weak from\r\nthe effects of hunger, to wander from the hive, and fall to the earth\r\nby hundreds. These effects attend only a scarcity in the early part of\r\nthe season. The massacre of July and September is quite different. The\r\ndrones then have age and strength--an effort is apparently first made\r\nby the workers to drive them out without proceeding to extremes; they\r\nare harassed sometimes for several days; the workers feigning only to\r\nsting, or else they cannot, as I never succeeded in seeing but very few\r\ndispatched in that way; yet there is evidence proving beyond doubt that\r\nthe sting is used. Hundreds will often be collected together in a\r\ncompact body at the bottom of the hive; this mutual protection\r\naffording a few hours' respite from their tormentors, who do not cease\r\nto worry them. In a few days they are gone, and it is a hard matter to\r\ntell what has become of them, at least the majority. If the hive in\r\nSeptember is well supplied with honey, a portion of the drones have a\r\nlonger lease of life given them; I have seen them as late as December.\r\nIn some seasons, when the best hives are poorly supplied with stores,\r\nthe ensuing spring the bees will rear no drones, until the flowers\r\nyield a good supply. I have known one or two years in which no drones\r\nappeared before the last of June; at other times, thousands are matured\r\nby the first of May.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD QUEEN LEAVES WITH THE FIRST SWARM.\r\n\r\nThe old queen leaves with the first swarm; as soon as cells are ready\r\nin the new hive she will deposit her eggs in them, at first for\r\nworkers; the number perfected will correspond with the supply of honey\r\nand size of the swarm. When the supply fails before leaving the old\r\nstock, she remains _there_, and continues laying throughout the season;\r\nbut the bees matured after the 20th of July (in this section) are not\r\nmore than sufficient to keep the number good. As many die, or are lost\r\nduring their excursions, as the young ones will replace; in fact, they\r\noften lose rather than gain; so that by the next spring, a hive that\r\nhas cast no swarm, is no better for a stock than one from which a swarm\r\nhas issued. We are apt to be deceived by bees clustering outside,\r\ntowards the latter end of the season, and suppose it hardly possible\r\nfor them all to get in, when it may be caused by hot weather, full\r\nstores, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nA YOUNG QUEEN TAKES THE PLACE OF HER MOTHER IN THE OLD STOCK.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary circumstances, when a swarm has left a stock, the oldest of\r\nthe young queens is ready to emerge from her cell in about eight or\r\nnine days; if no second swarm is sent out, she will take her mother's\r\nplace, and begin to lay eggs in about ten days, or a little less. Two\r\nor three weeks is the only time throughout the whole season, but what\r\neggs can be found in all prosperous hives. Whenever a copious yield of\r\nhoney occurs, drones are reared; as it becomes scarce, they are\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe relative number of drones and workers that exist when they are most\r\nnumerous, doubtless depends on the size of the hive, whether one in\r\nten, or one in thirty.\r\n\r\nWhen a swarm is first hived, the first cells are the size for working;\r\nif the hive be very small, and bees numerous, it may be filled before\r\nthey are fully aware of it, and but few drone-cells constructed;\r\nconsequently, but few can be raised; whereas if the hive be large, long\r\nbefore it is full, considerable honey will be stored. Cells for storing\r\nhoney are usually the size for drones; these will be made as soon as\r\nthe requisite number for workers is provided. An abundant yield of\r\nhoney during the process of filling a large hive, would therefore cause\r\na great proportion of these cells to be built--the amount of\r\ndrone-brood being governed by the same cause, is a strong argument\r\nagainst large hives, as affording room for too many of these cells,\r\nwhere an unnecessary number of drones will be reared, causing a useless\r\nexpenditure of honey, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER THEORIES.\r\n\r\nTheories differing materially from the foregoing, are advanced by\r\nnearly all writers. One says, \"In spring the queen lays about 2,000\r\neggs of males, resumes it again in August, but during the rest of the\r\nintervals she exclusively lays worker eggs. The queen must be at least\r\neleven months old before she begins to lay the eggs of males.\" Mr.\r\nTownley makes the same assertion. Dr. Bevan says, \"the great laying of\r\ndrone eggs usually commences about the end of April.\" Another author\r\nrepeats about the same, and appears to have investigated farther, as he\r\nhas found out that the eggs for the two kinds of bees are germinated\r\nseparately, and the queen knows when each kind is ready, as well as the\r\nworkers, &c. Now, I beg leave to differ a little from these authors.\r\nEither there exists no difference in the eggs germinated, and any, or\r\nall will produce drones or workers, just as they happen to be deposited\r\nand fed; or else the periods of laying drone eggs are much more\r\nfrequent than any writer with which I am acquainted has been willing to\r\nallow.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT NOT UNDERSTOOD.\r\n\r\nI am not anxious to establish a new theory, but to get at facts. If we\r\npretend to understand natural history, it is important that we have it\r\ncorrect; and if we do not understand it, say so, and leave it open for\r\nfurther investigation. It is my opinion that we _know_ but very little\r\nabout this point. I wish to induce closer observation, and would\r\nrecommend no _positive_ decision, until all the facts that will apply\r\nhave been examined. Whether these drone-egg theories have been too\r\nhastily adopted, the reader can decide; I shall offer a few more facts,\r\nsomewhat difficult to reconcile with them.\r\n\r\nFirst, in relation to the queen being \"eleven months old\" before laying\r\ndrone eggs. We _all_ agree, I believe, that the old queen goes with the\r\nfirst swarm, and a young one remains in the old stock. Now suppose the\r\nfirst swarm leaves in June, and the old stock yet contains a numerous\r\nfamily. The flowers of buckwheat in August yield a bountiful harvest of\r\nhoney. This old stock rears a large brood of drones. Is it not proved\r\nin this case that the queen was but two months old, instead of eleven?\r\nWe further agree that young queens accompany second or after-swarms.\r\nWhen these happen to be large and prosperous, they never fail to rear a\r\nbrood of drones at this season. What is the age of these? I apprehend\r\nthat this eleven months theory originated in sections where there are\r\nno crops of buckwheat raised, or in small quantities. Clover generally\r\nfails in August, and May, or June, of another year comes round, before\r\nthere is a sufficient yield to produce the brood. With these\r\nobservations _only_, how very rational to conclude that it must be a\r\nlaw of their nature, instead of being governed by the yield of honey,\r\nand size of the family? If the periods of drone egg laying are limited\r\nto only two or three, it would seem that all queens ought to be ready\r\nwith this kind of egg, about the same period of the season, but how are\r\nthe facts?\r\n\r\nI would like to inquire what becomes of the first series of drone eggs,\r\nthe last of April, or the first of May, when the stocks are poorly\r\nsupplied with honey, or when a family is small and but little honey\r\nthrough the summer? No drone brood is matured in these cases. It is not\r\npretended that the queen has any control over the germination of these\r\neggs, yet somehow she has them ready whenever the situation of the hive\r\nwill warrant it. Two stocks may have an equal number of bees the first\r\nof May; one may have forty pounds of honey, the other four pounds; the\r\nlatter cannot afford to rear a drone, while the other will have\r\nhundreds. Let two stocks have but four pounds each at any time in\r\nsummer when honey is scarce, now feed one of them plentifully, and a\r\nbrood of drones is sure to appear, while the other will not produce\r\none. Whenever stocks are well stored with honey, and full of bees, the\r\nfirst of May will find drone-cells containing brood. If the flowers\r\ncontinue to yield a full supply, these cells may be examined every week\r\nfrom that period till the first swarm leaves, and I will engage that\r\ndrone brood may be found in all stages from the egg to maturity; and\r\nthe worker brood the same. In twenty-four days after the first swarm\r\nleaves, the last drone eggs left by the old queen will be just about\r\nmatured. When transferring bees from old to new hives, I generally do\r\nit about twenty-one or twenty-two days after the first swarm, (this is\r\nthe time to avoid destroying the worker-brood; the particulars will be\r\ngiven in another place.) I have transferred a great many, and _never\r\nfailed_ to find a few drones about ready to leave the combs. Whether\r\nthe swarm had left the last of May, or middle of July, there was no\r\ndifference, they were on hand.\r\n\r\nA very early swarm in good seasons, will often fill the hive, and send\r\nout an issue in from four to six weeks: the usual amount of drone-brood\r\nmay be found in these cases. The following circumstance would appear to\r\nindicate that all the eggs are alike, and if they are laid in\r\ndrone-cells, the bees give the proper food and make drones; if in\r\nworker-cells, workers, just as they make a queen from a worker-egg,\r\nwhen put in a royal cell.\r\n\r\nIn a glass hive, one sheet of comb next the glass, and parallel with\r\nit, was full size; about three-quarters of this sheet was worker-cells,\r\nthe remainder drone-cells. The family had been rather small, but now\r\nhad increased to a full swarm; a few drones had matured in the middle\r\nof the hive. It was about the middle of June, 1850, when I discovered\r\nthe bees on this outside sheet, preparing it, as I thought, for brood,\r\nby cutting off the cells to the proper length. They had been used for\r\nstoring honey, and were much too long, being about an inch and a half\r\ndeep. In a day or two after I saw a few eggs in both worker and\r\ndrone-cells; four or five days afterwards, on opening the door, I found\r\nher \"majesty\" engaged in depositing eggs in the drone cells. Nearly\r\nevery one already contained an egg; most of these she examined, but did\r\nnot use them; six or eight, it appeared, were all that were unoccupied;\r\nin each of these she immediately deposited an egg. She continued to\r\nsearch for more empty cells, and in doing so, she got on the part of\r\nthe comb containing worker-cells, where she found a dozen or more\r\nempty, in each of which, she laid one. The whole time perhaps thirty\r\nminutes. Query? Was her series of drone eggs exhausted just at this\r\ntime? If so, it would appear that she was not aware of it, because she\r\nexamined several drone-cells after laying the last one there, before\r\nleaving that part of the comb, and acted exactly as if she would have\r\nused them had they not been pre-occupied. Did the worker-cells receive\r\nsome eggs that would have produced drones, but for the circumstance of\r\nbeing deposited in worker-cells? I know we are told that an egg may be\r\ntransferred from a worker-cell to one for drones, or an egg taken from\r\na drone-cell and deposited in a worker-cell; that the exchange will\r\nmake no difference, the bee will be just what the first deposit would\r\nhave made it. How the knowledge for this assertion was obtained, we are\r\nnot informed, at least of the practical part. That an egg was ever\r\ndetached from the bottom of one cell safely and successfully deposited\r\nin another, without breaking or injuring it in some manner, to make the\r\nbees refuse it, permit me at present to doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\nNECESSITY FOR FURTHER OBSERVATION.\r\n\r\nCannot some experiments, practicable to all, be instituted that will\r\nthrow more light on this subject? The old hypothesis of limiting\r\ndrone-egg laying to two or three periods, is evidently at fault.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO SIDES OF THE QUESTION.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose that the eggs are all alike, and the subsequent treatment\r\nmakes either workers, drones, or queens, and look to analogy for\r\nsupport, we shall find much against, as well as for it. For instance,\r\nwe find in almost every department of animated nature, that the sex of\r\nthe germ of a future being is decided before being separated from the\r\nparent, as the eggs of fowls, &c. Another fact, some queens (averaging\r\none in sixty or eighty) deposit eggs that produce only drones,[8]\r\nwhether in worker or drone-cells, proving that sex is decided in this\r\ncase beyond controversy. Hence it would appear reasonable, if sex was\r\ndecided by the ovaries of the queen, in one case, it would be in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n      [8] I have had several such. It made no difference whether the\r\n      eggs were in the worker-cells or drone-cells, the brood was all\r\n      drones. When in the worker-cells, (and the majority was there,)\r\n      they required to be lengthened about one-third. In an occurrence\r\n      of this kind, the colony of workers will rapidly diminish in\r\n      number, until too few are left to protect the combs from the\r\n      moth. It occurs most frequently in spring, but I once had a case\r\n      the last of summer. The first indications are an unusual number\r\n      of caps, or covers of cells, being under and about the hive; the\r\n      workers, instead of increasing, grow less in number. When you\r\n      fear this state of things, make a thorough examination, blow\r\n      under the hive some tobacco smoke, as directed in pruning, invert\r\n      the hive, part the combs till you can see the brood; if the\r\n      worker-cells contain drones, they are readily perceived, as they\r\n      project beyond the usual even surface, being very irregular, here\r\n      and there a few, or perhaps but one sticking out. The  worker-brood,\r\n      when in their own cells, form nearly an even surface; so of the\r\n      drones. The only remedy that I have found is to destroy this\r\n      queen, and substitute another, which can be obtained in the\r\n      swarming season, or in the fall, better than at other times. To\r\n      find the queen, paralyze with puff-ball, &c. For directions see\r\n      fall management.\r\n\r\nTo allow the bees the power of making three kinds of bees from one kind\r\nof eggs, which would be virtually constituting a third sex, an anomaly\r\nnot often found. The drones being males, and workers imperfect females\r\nwith generative organs undeveloped, renders the anomaly of the third\r\nsex unnecessary. On the other side it might be said in reply: That if\r\nfood and treatment would create or produce organs of generation in the\r\nfemale, by making an egg destined for a worker into a queen, (a fact\r\nwhich all apiarians admit,) why not food and treatment make the drone?\r\nIs the difficulty of developing _one_ kind of sexual organs greater\r\nthan another?\r\n\r\nRespecting the anomaly of the eggs of some queens producing only\r\ndrones, the question might be asked, Is this more of an anomaly than\r\nthat of ordinary queens which are said to germinate eggs in distinct\r\nseries? It is all out of the usual line. Other animals or insects\r\nusually produce the sexes promiscuously. As we are ignorant of causes\r\ndeciding sex in any case, we must acknowledge mystery to belong to both\r\nsides of the question here. The stumbling-block of more than two sexes,\r\nwhich seems so necessary to make plain, is no greater here than with\r\nsome species of ants, that have, as we are told, king, queen, soldier\r\nand laborer. Four distinct and differently formed bodies, all belonging\r\nto one nest, and descended from one mother. Whether there are four\r\ndistinct kinds of eggs producing them, or the power is given to the\r\nworkers to develop such as are wanted, from one kind, we cannot say. If\r\nwe make two kinds of eggs, it helps the matter but very little. There\r\nis still an anomaly. There is but one perfect female in a nest to\r\ngerminate eggs, and the myriads produced (being over 80,000 in\r\ntwenty-four hours, according to some historians) shows that the\r\nfecundity of our queen-bee is not a parallel case by any means. And yet\r\nthey are similar, by having their offspring provided for without an\r\neffort of their own.\r\n\r\nI shall leave this matter for the present, hoping that _something\r\nconclusive_ may occur in the course of my experiments, or those of\r\nothers. At present I am inclined to think that the eggs are all alike,\r\nbut am not fully satisfied.\r\n\r\nI am aware that this matter is of but little value or interest to many,\r\nbut myself and a few others have \"Yankee inquisitiveness\" pretty well\r\ndeveloped, and would like to _know_ how it _was_ managed.\r\n\r\nAs for workers proving occasionally fertile, I have but little to say.\r\nAfter years of close observation directed to this point, I have been\r\nunable to discover anything to establish this opinion. Neither have I\r\nfound the black bees described by some authors. It is true that in the\r\nmiddle or latter part of summer a portion will be much darker than\r\nothers, and perhaps rather smaller, and some of them with their wings\r\nsomewhat worn, probably the result of continued labor, peculiar food,\r\nor some incidental circumstance.\r\n\r\nI have a few times found a humble-bee under the hive, that had entered,\r\nand not finding his way out readily, was speedily shorn of his\r\nbeautiful \"locks,\" and consequently his strength--that is, every\r\nparticle of hair, down, feathers, bristles, or whatever he had been\r\ncovered with, was completely removed by the bees, who had no regard for\r\nhis beautiful alternating stripes of yellow and brown; which left him\r\nthe very picture of darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nBEE PASTURAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some seasons the earth is covered with snow much later than others.\r\nWhen this occurs, a greater number of warm days are necessary to melt\r\nit, and start the flowers, than otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSTITUTE FOR POLLEN.\r\n\r\nDuring these warm days, while waiting for the flowers, the bees are\r\nanxious to do something. It is then interesting to watch them, and see\r\nwhat will be used as substitutes for pollen and honey. At such times, I\r\nhave seen hundreds engaged on a heap of sawdust, gathering the minute\r\nparticles into little pellets on their legs, seeming quite pleased with\r\nthe acquisition. Rotten wood, when crumbled into powder, and dry, is\r\nalso collected. Flour, when scattered near the hive, I have known to be\r\ntaken up in considerable quantities. Some apiarians have fed it to\r\ntheir bees at this season, and consider it a great advantage; I have\r\nnot tested it sufficient to give an opinion. A substitute for honey is\r\nsap from a few kinds of trees, yet it all amounts to but very little.\r\nAll these unnatural sources are abandoned when the flowers appear.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANNER OF PACKING IT.\r\n\r\nThe particular manner of obtaining pollen has been witnessed by but\r\nvery few persons, as it is generally brushed from their bodies and\r\npacked on their legs, while on the wing, thereby preventing a fair\r\nchance to inspect operations. When collecting only pollen they alight\r\non the flowers, passing rapidly over the stamens, detaching a portion\r\nof the dust, which lodges on most parts of them, to be brushed together\r\nand packed into pellets when again on the wing. Thus they keep\r\nalternately flying and alighting until a load is obtained, when they\r\nimmediately return to the hive; each bee bringing several loads in a\r\nday. Honey, as it is collected, is deposited in the abdomen, and kept\r\nout of sight till stored in the hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nALDER YIELDS THE FIRST.\r\n\r\nThe first material gathered from flowers is pollen. Candle-alder\r\n(_Alnus Rubra_)[9] yields the first supply. The time of flowering\r\nvaries from the 10th of March to the 20th of April. The amount afforded\r\nis also variable. Cold, freezing weather frequently destroys a great\r\nportion of these flowers after they are out. These staminate flowers\r\nare nearly perfected the season previous, and a few warm days in spring\r\nwill bring them out, even before any leaves appear. When the weather\r\ncontinues fine, great quantities of farina are secured.\r\n\r\n      [9] The botanical names are from Wood's Class-Book.\r\n\r\nThe time that bees commence their labors does not govern the time of\r\nswarming by any means; this matter depends on the weather through April\r\nand May. These remarks apply particularly to this section, Green\r\nCounty, New York, in latitude about 42 degrees. In other places many\r\ndifferent trees, shrubs, and herbs, may be found yielding honey and\r\npollen that scarcely exist here, producing far different results.\r\n\r\nOur swamps produce several varieties of willow, (salix,) that put out\r\ntheir blossoms very irregularly. Some of these bushes are a month\r\nearlier than others, and some of the buds on the same bush are a week\r\nor two later than the rest. These also afford only pollen, but are much\r\nmore dependence than alder, as a turn of cold weather cannot at any\r\ntime destroy more than a small part. Next comes the aspen, (_Populus\r\nTremuloides_); of this we have more than is necessary for any purpose.\r\nIt is not a particular favorite with the bees, as but few,\r\ncomparatively, visit it. It is followed very soon by an abundance of\r\nthe red maple (_Acer Rubrum_), that suits them better, but this, like\r\nthe others, is often lost by freezing. The first honey obtained of any\r\naccount is from the golden willow (_Salix Vitellina_); it yields no\r\npollen, and is seldom injured by frost. Gooseberries, currants,\r\ncherries, pear and peach trees, add a share of both honey and pollen.\r\nSugar maple (_Acer Saccharinum_) now throws out its ten thousand silken\r\ntassels, beautiful as gold. Strawberries modestly open their petals in\r\ninvitation, but, like \"obscure virtues,\" are often neglected for the\r\nmore conspicuous Dandelion, and the showy appearance and flagrant\r\nblossoms of the apple-trees, which now open their stores, offering to\r\ntheir acceptance a real harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT FLOWERS IMPORTANT IN GOOD WEATHER.\r\n\r\nIn good weather, sometimes a gain of twenty lbs. is added to their\r\nstores, during this period of apple-tree blossoms. But we are seldom\r\nfortunate enough to have good weather all through this period, it being\r\nrainy, cloudy, cool, or windy, which is very detrimental. Sometimes a\r\nfrost at this time destroys all, and the gain of our bees is reversed,\r\nthat is, they are lighter at the end than at the beginning of these\r\nflowers. Yet this is the season that decides their prosperity for the\r\nsummer, whether they do _first rate_ or otherwise. If good weather now,\r\nwe expect our first swarms about the first of June; if not, no\r\nsubsequent yield of honey will make up for this deficiency. We now have\r\na time of several days, from ten to fourteen, in which but few flowers\r\nexist. If our hives are poorly supplied when this scarcity occurs, it\r\nwill so disarrange their plans for swarming, that no preparations are\r\nagain made much before July, and sometimes not at all. In sections\r\nwhere the wild cherry (_Cerasus Seratina_) abounds, the flowers of this\r\nwill appear and fill this time of scarcity, which this section annually\r\npresents.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED RASPBERRY A FAVORITE.\r\n\r\nThe red raspberry (_Rubus Strigosus_) next presents the stamens as the\r\nmost conspicuous part of the flower, soliciting the embrace of the bee,\r\nby pouring out bounteous libations more prized by our industrious\r\ninsect than wine. For several weeks they are allowed to partake of this\r\nexquisite beverage; it is secreted at all hours and in all kinds of\r\nweather. When the morning is warm we often hear their cheerful humming\r\namong the leaves and flowers of this shrub, ere the sun appears above\r\nthe horizon. The gentle shower, sufficient to induce man to seek a\r\nshelter, is often unheeded by the bee when luxuriating among these\r\nflowers; even white clover, important as it is in furnishing the\r\ngreatest part of their stores, at this season, would be neglected if\r\nthere was only a full supply of this. Clover begins to blossom with the\r\nraspberry, and continues longer. We have an insufficient supply (in\r\nthis section) in most seasons. Red clover probably secretes as much\r\nhoney as the white, but the tube of the corolla being longer, the bee\r\nappears to be unable to reach it. Yet I have seen a few at work even\r\nhere but it appeared like slow business. Sorrel, (_Rumex Acetosella_)\r\nthe pest of many farmers, is brought under contribution, and furnishes\r\nthe precious dust in any quantity. Morning is the only part of the day\r\nappropriated to its collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATNIP, MOTHER-WORT, AND HOARHOUND ARE SOUGHT AFTER.\r\n\r\nCatnip, (_Nepeta Cataria_,) Mother-wort, (_Leonurus Cardiaca_,) and\r\nHoarhound, (_Marrubium Vulgare_,) about the middle of June, put forth\r\ntheir flowers, rich in sweetness, and like the Raspberry, the bees\r\nvisit them at all hours and in nearly all kinds of weather. They last\r\nfrom four to six weeks; the catnip I have known to last twelve in a few\r\ninstances, yielding honey during the whole time. Ox-eye daisy,\r\n(_Leucanthemum Vulgare_,) that beautiful and splendid flower, in\r\npasture and meadow, and worth but little in either, also contains some\r\nhoney. The flower is compound, and each little floret contains\r\nparticles so minute, that the task of obtaining a load is very tedious.\r\nIt is only visited when the more copious honey-yielding flowers are\r\nscarce. Snap-dragon,(_Linaria Vulgaris_,) with its nauseous and\r\nsickening odor, troubling the farmer with its vile presence, is made to\r\nbestow the only good thing about it, except its beauty, upon our\r\ninsect. The flower is large and tubular, and the bee to reach the honey\r\nmust enter it; to see the bee almost disappear within the folds of the\r\ncorolla, one would think that it was about being swallowed, when the\r\nhideous mouth was gaping to receive it; but unharmed, soon it emerges\r\nfrom the yellow prison, covered with dust; this is not brushed into\r\npellets on its legs, like the pollen from some other flowers, but a\r\npart adheres to its back between the wings, which it is apparently\r\nunable to remove, as it remains there sometimes for months, making a\r\ncluster outside the hive, appear quite speckled. Bush honey-suckle\r\n(_Diervilla Trifida_) is another particular favorite.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINGULAR FATALITY ATTENDANT ON SILKWEED.\r\n\r\nSilkweed (_Asclepias Cornuti_) is also another honey-yielding\r\nperennial, but a singular fatality attends many bees while gathering\r\nit, that I never yet saw noticed. I had observed during the period this\r\nplant was in bloom, that a number of the bees belonging to swarms,\r\nbefore the hive was full, were unable to ascend the sides to the comb;\r\nthere would be sometimes thirty or more at the bottom in the morning.\r\nOn searching for the cause, I found from one to ten thin yellow scales,\r\nattached to their feet, triangular, or somewhat wedge shape, in size\r\nabout the twentieth part of an inch. On the longest point or angle, was\r\na black thread-like point, from a sixteenth to an eighth of an inch in\r\nlength; on this stem was either hooks, barbs, or a glutinous matter,\r\nthat firmly adhered to each foot or claw of the bee, rendering it\r\nuseless as far as climbing the sides of the hive was concerned. I found\r\nalso among bees clustered outside of full hives, this ornament\r\nattached, but to them it appeared no inconvenience. Among the scales of\r\nwax and waste matter that accumulates about the swarms to the amount of\r\na handful, I found a great many of these scales, which the bees had\r\nworked from their feet. The question then arose, were these scales a\r\nforeign substance, accidentally entangled in their claws, or was it\r\nsomething formed there by nature, or _rather_ an unnatural appendage?\r\nIt was soon decided. From the number of bees carrying it, I was\r\nsatisfied that if it was the product of any flower, it belonged to a\r\nspecies somewhat abundant. I set about a close examination of all such\r\nas were then in bloom. I found the flowers of the Silkweed, (or\r\nMilkweed, as some call it,) sometimes holding a dead bee by the foot,\r\nsecured by this appendage. Both sepals and petals of this flower are\r\nre-curved, that is, turned backward towards the stem, forming five\r\nacute angles, or notches, just the thing for a trap for a bee with\r\n_strings_ of _beads_ on its toes; when at work they are very liable to\r\nslip a foot into one of these notches; the flower being thick and firm,\r\nholds it fast; pulling only draws it deeper into the wedge-like cavity.\r\nThe bee must either perish or break loose; their instincts fail them in\r\nthis emergency; they know nothing about getting it out by a gentle pull\r\nthe other way. I never saw one do it except by accident. By examining\r\nthe buds of this plant just before opening, I found this fatal\r\nappendage, by which great numbers of our bees are lost.[10] When I\r\npoint out a loss among our bees, I would like to give a remedy; but\r\nhere I am at a loss, unless all these plants are destroyed, and this is\r\nimpracticable in many places. After all I am not sure but honey enough\r\nis obtained by such bees as do escape, to counterbalance what we lose.\r\nThis would depend on the amount of honey yielded by other flowers at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n      [10] In Wood's Class-book of Botany, \"Order CII.,\" in a plate\r\n      showing the parts of this plant, it is thus described: \"Fig. 11,\r\n      a pair of pollen masses suspended from the glands at an angle of\r\n      the antheridium,\" &c.\r\n\r\n      One, when reading this simple botanical description, and seeing\r\n      the plate, or the Botanist with his glasses, when he minutely\r\n      inspects the parts, would not suspect anything fatal to bees\r\n      about it.\r\n\r\nWhitewood (_Liriodendron Tulipifera_) yields something eagerly sought\r\nfor by the bees, but whether honey, or pollen, or both, I have never\r\nbeen able to ascertain. All the flowers of this kind, with us, are too\r\nhigh. It is very scarce, as well as Basswood, (_Tilia Americana_,)--that\r\nin some places is abundant, and yields honey clear and transparent as\r\nwater, superior in appearance, but inferior in flavor to clover; it\r\nalso appears much thinner when first collected.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE YIELD FROM BASSWOOD.\r\n\r\nDuring the time this tree is in bloom, a period of two or three weeks\r\nin many sections, astonishing quantities are obtained. A person once\r\nassured me that he had known \"ten pounds collected by one swarm in a\r\nday, by weighing the hive in the morning and again at evening.\" I have\r\nsome doubt of the statement, and think half the amount would be a good\r\nday's work; but I had but a small chance to know, as only a few trees,\r\nas a specimen, grow in this section. I have weighed hives during\r\nseasons of apple-tree blossoms and buckwheat, the two best yields of\r\nhoney we have, and three and a half pounds was the best for one day\r\nthat I ever had. Sumach, (_Rhus Glabra_,) in some sections, affords\r\nconsiderable honey. Mustard (_Sinapis Nigra_) is also a great favorite.\r\n\r\nI have now mentioned most of the honey-producing trees and plants that\r\ncome on before the middle of July. The course of these flowers is\r\ntermed the first yield. In sections where there are no crops of\r\nbuckwheat, it constitutes the only full one. Other flowers continue to\r\nbloom till cold weather. Where white clover is abundant and the fields\r\nare used for pasture, it will continue to throw out fresh flowers,\r\nsometimes, throughout the summer; yet the bees consume about all they\r\ncollect in rearing their brood, &c. Thus it appears in some sections\r\nsix or eight weeks is about all the time they have to provide for\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN FLOWERS UNIMPORTANT.\r\n\r\nIn passing along I have not mentioned garden flowers, because the\r\namount obtained here is a small item, compared to the forest and\r\nfields--especially ornamental flowers. It is true that the Hollyhock,\r\n(_Altha Rosea_,) Mallows, (_Malva Rotundifolia_) and many others yield\r\nhoney, but what does it amount to? A person expecting his hives to be\r\nfilled from such a source would very likely be disappointed, especially\r\nwhen many are kept together.\r\n\r\n\r\nHONEY-DEW.\r\n\r\nHoney-dew is said to be a source from whence large collections are made\r\nin some places. When or where it appears or disappears is more than I\r\ncan tell. I have seen the accounts of it, but accounts I have learned\r\nto doubt until I find something corroborative in my own experience. I\r\nfind too many errors copied merely because they happen to be in company\r\nwith several truths. Huber discovered many important truths, and has\r\ngiven them to the world; too many writers take it for granted when two\r\npoints of his are true, the third _must be also_. It is no proof that\r\nthere is no such article merely because I never discovered it. In the\r\nmany fruitless endeavors that I have made to get a view of this\r\nsubstance, it may be I have lacked close observation; or possibly there\r\nis none showered upon this region; or I may have failed to bring my\r\nimagination to assist me to convert common dew into the real article.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINGULAR SECRETION.\r\n\r\nI once discovered bees collecting a secretion unconnected with flowers;\r\nbut was not honey-dew, as it has been described. I was passing a bush\r\nof Witch-hazel, (_Hamamelis Virginiana_,) and was arrested by an\r\nunusual humming of bees. At first I supposed that a swarm was about me,\r\nyet it was late in the season, (it being about the 25th July.) On close\r\ninspection, I found the bush contained numerous warty excrescences, the\r\nsize and shape of a hickory-nut. These proved to be only a shell--the\r\ninside lined with thousands of minute insects, a species of aphis.\r\nThese appeared to be engaged sucking the juices, and discharging a\r\nclear, transparent fluid. Near the stem was an orifice about an eighth\r\nof an inch in diameter, out of which this liquid would gradually exude.\r\nSo eager were the bees for this secretion, that several would crowd\r\naround one orifice at a time, each endeavoring to thrust the other\r\naway. This occurred several years ago, and I never have been able to\r\nfind anything like it since; neither have I learned whether it is\r\ncommon in other sections.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETIONS OF THE APHIS.\r\n\r\nThe liquid ejected by the aphis, (plant louse,) when feeding or sucking\r\nthe juices of tender leaves, and received by the ants that are always\r\nin attendance, is something like it; but in this case the bees were in\r\nattendance instead of ants.\r\n\r\nThis mode of elaborating honey, although not generally collected by\r\nbees, perhaps may not be too much out of place here. Also, it may\r\nfurnish a clue to the cause or substantiate some theory of honey-dew.\r\n\r\nThese insects (_Aphis_) have been very appropriately termed \"ants'\r\ncows,\" as they are regarded by them with the most tender care and\r\nsolicitude. In July or August, when the majority of the leaves of our\r\napple trees are matured, there is often a few sprouts or suckers about\r\nthe bottom or trunk, that continue growing and putting out fresh\r\nleaves. On the under side of these, you will find the _aphis_ by\r\nhundreds, of all sizes, from those just hatched to the perfect insect\r\nwith wings. All appear to be engaged in sucking the bitter juice from\r\nthe tender leaf and stalk. The ants are among them by scores. (They are\r\noften accused by the careless observer of the injury, instead of the\r\n_aphis_.) Occasionally there will issue from their abdomen a small,\r\ntransparent globule, which the ant is ever ready to receive. When a\r\nload is obtained it descends to the nest; others may be seen going and\r\nreturning continually. Many other kinds of trees, shrubs and plants are\r\nused by the ants as \"cow pasture,\" and most kinds of ants are engaged\r\nin this dairy business.[11] Would the bees attend on the _aphis_ for\r\nthis secretion, (for it appears to be honey,) if the ant was not there\r\nfirst? Or if there were no ants or bees, would this secretion be\r\ndischarged, and falling on the leaves below them, be honey-dew? If they\r\nwere situated on some lofty trees, and it lodged on the leaves of small\r\nbushes near the earth, it would, with some authors.\r\n\r\n      [11] The history of insects, as published by Harpers, gives more\r\n      particulars on this interesting subject.\r\n\r\nThese questions I shall not answer, at present. As for theory, I shall\r\nprobably have enough before I get through, where I hope the subject may\r\nbe more interesting.[12]\r\n\r\n      [12] Since the foregoing was written, I have made some further\r\n      observations on this subject. In August, 1852, I noticed, on\r\n      passing under some willow trees, (_Salix Vitellina_,) that\r\n      leaves, grass, and stones, were covered with a wet or shining\r\n      substance. On looking among the branches, I found nearly all the\r\n      smallest were covered with a species of large black _aphis_,\r\n      apparently engaged in sucking the juices, and occasionally\r\n      discharging a minute drop of a transparent liquid. I _guessed_\r\n      this might be the honey-dew. As this was early in the morning, I\r\n      resolved to visit this place again, as soon as the sun got up far\r\n      enough to start out the bees, and see if they collected any of\r\n      it. On my return I found not only bees in hundreds, but ants,\r\n      hornets, and wasps. Some were on the branches with the _aphis_,\r\n      others on the leaves and larger branches. Some of them were even\r\n      on the stones and grass under the trees, collecting it.\r\n\r\nWe will now return to the flowers, and see what few there are yet to\r\nappear, after the middle of July. The button-ball bush (_Cephalanthus\r\nOccidentalis_) is now much frequented for honey. Also, our vines,\r\nmelons, cucumbers, squashes, and pumpkins. The latter are visited only\r\nin the morning, and honey is the only thing obtained; notwithstanding\r\nthe bee is covered with farina, it is not kneaded into pellets on its\r\nlegs. I have seen it stated that bees never get honey early in the\r\nmorning, but pollen instead. Now it is not best always to take our\r\nword, who pretend to know all about it, but look for yourselves into\r\nsome of these matters. Take a look some warm morning, when the pumpkins\r\nare in bloom, and see whether it is honey or pollen they are in quest\r\nof. Also please make an observation when they are at work on the red\r\nraspberry, motherwort, or catnip; you will thus ascertain a fact so\r\neasily, that you will wonder any one with the least pretension to\r\napiarian science could be ignorant of it. I mention this, not because\r\nit is of much importance in itself, but to show the fallibility of us\r\nall, as we sometimes copy the mistaken assertions of others.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF BUCKWHEAT.\r\n\r\nUnder some circumstances, clover will continue to bloom through this\r\npart of the season; also, a few other flowers; but I find by weighing,\r\na loss from one to six pounds, between the 20th July and the 10th of\r\nAugust, when the flowers of buckwheat begin to yield honey, which\r\ngenerally proves a second harvest. In many places it is their main\r\ndependence for surplus honey. It is considered by many an inferior\r\nquality. The color, when separated from comb, resembles molasses of\r\nmedium shade. The taste is more pungent than clover honey; it is\r\nparticularly prized on that account by some, and disliked by others for\r\nthe same reason. In the same temperature it is a little thicker than\r\nother honey, and is sooner candied.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF HONEY COLLECTED FROM IT.\r\n\r\nSwarms issuing as late as the 15th July, when they commence on\r\nbuckwheat, sometimes contain not over five pounds of stores, and yet\r\nmake good stocks for winter, whereas, without this yield, they might\r\nnot live through October. It fails about once in ten years. I have\r\nknown a swarm to gain in one week sixteen pounds, and construct comb to\r\nstore it at the same time. At another time I had a swarm issue the 18th\r\nAugust, that obtained thirty pounds in about eighteen days. But such\r\nbuckwheat swarms, in ordinary seasons, seldom get over fifteen pounds.\r\nThe flowers last from three to five weeks. The time of sowing the grain\r\nvaries in different sections, from the 10th of June to the 20th July.\r\nFarmers wish to give it just time to ripen before frost, as the yield\r\nof grain is considered better, but as the time of frost is a matter of\r\nguess-work, some will sow several days earlier than others. Whenever an\r\nabundant crop of this grain is realized, a proportionate quantity of\r\nhoney is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nDO BEES INJURE THE CROP?\r\n\r\nMany people contend that bees are an injury to this crop, by taking\r\naway the substance that would be formed into grain. The best reasons\r\nfor this opinion that I have obtained are these: \"I believe it, and\r\nhave thought so a long time.\" \"It is reasonable if a portion of this\r\nplant is taken away by the bees, there must be a less quantity of\r\nmaterial left for the formation of seed, &c.\" Most of us have learned\r\nthat a person's opinion is not the strongest kind of proof, unless he\r\ncan exhibit substantial reasons for it. Are the above reasons\r\nsatisfactory? How are the facts? The flowers expand, and a set of\r\nvessels pour into the cup or nectary a minute portion of honey. I am\r\nnot aware that any one contends that the plant has another set of\r\nvessels prepared to again absorb this honey and convert it into grain.\r\nBut strong testimony proves very plainly that it never again enters the\r\nstalk or flower, but evaporates like water. We all know that animal\r\nmatter when putrid will be dissolved into particles small enough to\r\nfloat in the atmosphere, too minute for the naked eye. When passing off\r\nin this way this real flesh and blood would escape notice perhaps\r\naltogether, and never be detected, were it not for the olfactories,\r\nwhich on some occasions notify us of its presence very forcibly. In\r\npassing a field of buckwheat in bloom, by the same means we are assured\r\nof the presence of honey in the air. Now what is the difference whether\r\nthis honey passes off in the air, or is collected by the bees? If any\r\ndifference, the advantage appears to be in favor of the bees getting\r\nit, for the reason that it thus answers another important end in the\r\neconomy of nature, consistent with her provisions in ten thousand\r\ndifferent ways of adapting means to ends. Most breeders of domestic\r\nanimals are aware of the deteriorating qualities induced by in-and-in\r\nbreeding; a change of breed is found necessary for perfection, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nARE NOT BEES AN ADVANTAGE TO VEGETATION?\r\n\r\nVegetable physiology seems to indicate a similar necessity in that\r\ndepartment. The stamens and pistils of flowers answer the different\r\norgans of the two sexes in animals. The pistil is connected with the\r\novaries, the stamens furnish the pollen that must come in contact with\r\nthe pistil; in other words, it _must be impregnated_ by this dust from\r\nthe stamens, or no fruit will be produced. Now if it be necessary to\r\nchange the breed, or essential that the pollen produced by the stamens\r\nof one flower shall fertilize the pistil of another, to prevent\r\nbarrenness, what should we contrive better than the arrangement already\r\nmade by Him who knew the necessity and planned it accordingly? And it\r\nworks so admirably, that we can hardly avoid the conclusion _that bees\r\nwere intended for this important purpose_! It is thus planned! Their\r\nwants and their food shall consist of honey and pollen; each flower\r\nsecretes but little, just enough to attract the bee; nothing like a\r\nfull load is obtained from one; were it thus, the end in view would not\r\nbe answered; but a hundred or more flowers are often visited in one\r\nexcursion; the pollen obtained from the first may fertilize many,\r\nprevious to the bees' returning to the hive; thus a field of buckwheat\r\nmay be kept in health and vigor in its future productions. A field of\r\nwheat produces long slender stalks that yield to the influence of the\r\nbreeze, and one ear is made to bestow its pollen on a neighboring ear\r\nseveral feet distant, thereby effecting just what bees do for\r\nbuckwheat. Corn, from its manner of growth, the upright stalk bearing\r\nthe stamens some feet above the pistils, on the ears below, seems to\r\nneed no agency of bees; the superabundant pollen from the tassel is\r\nwafted by the winds rods from the producing stalk, and there does its\r\noffice of fertilizing a distant ear, as is proved by different\r\nvarieties mixing at some distance. But how is it with our vines\r\ntrailing on the earth, a part of these flowers producing stamens, the\r\nother only pistils? Now it _is absolutely essential_ that pollen from\r\nthe staminate flowers shall be introduced into the pistillate to\r\nproduce fruit; because if a failure occurs in this matter the germ will\r\nwither and die. Here we have the agent ready for our purpose; these\r\nflowers are visited by the bee promiscuously; no pollen (as was said)\r\nis kneaded into pellets, (particularly that from pumpkins,) but it\r\nadheres to every part of their body, rendering it next to impossible\r\nfor a bee thus covered with dust to enter the pistillated flower\r\nwithout fulfilling the important duty designed, and leave a portion of\r\nthe fertilizing dust in its proper place. Hence it is reasonably\r\ninferred by many, that if it was not for this agent among our vines,\r\nthe uncertainty of a crop from non-fertilization would render the\r\ncultivation of them a useless task.\r\n\r\nWhen the aphis is located on the stalk or leaf of a plant it is\r\nfurnished with means to pierce the surface and extract the juices\r\nessential to the formation of the plant, thereby preventing vigorous\r\ngrowth and a full development. This idea is too apt to be associated\r\nwith the bee when she visits the flower, as if she was armed with a\r\nspear, to pierce bark or stem and rob it of its nourishment. Her real\r\nstructure is lost sight of, or perhaps never known; her slender\r\nbrush-like tongue folded closely under her neck, and seldom seen except\r\nwhen in use, is not fitted to pierce the most delicate substance; all\r\nthat it can be used for is to sweep or lick up the nectar as it exudes\r\nfrom the pores of the flower, secreted, it would seem, for no other\r\npurpose but to attract her--while there she obtains nothing but what\r\nnature has provided for her and given her the means of obtaining, and\r\nthe most delicate petal receives no injury.\r\n\r\nDuring an excursion the bee seldom visits more than a single species of\r\nflower; were it otherwise, and all kinds of flowers were visited\r\npromiscuously, by fertilizing one species with the pollen from another,\r\nthe vegetable kingdom would be very likely to get into confusion.\r\nWriters, when noticing the peculiarity of instinct governing the bee\r\nhere, cannot be content always, but must add other marvels. They follow\r\nthis trait into the hive, and make her store every kind by itself\r\nthere. Relative to honey it is not an easy matter to be positive; but\r\npollen is of a variety of colors, generally yellow, yet sometimes\r\npale-green, and reddish or dark-brown. Now I think a little patient\r\ninspection would have satisfied any one that two kinds _are_ sometimes\r\npacked in one cell, and prevented the assertion to the contrary. I will\r\nadmit that two colors are seldom found packed together, but sometimes\r\nwill be. I have thus found it, and it has entirely ruined that theory\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TEST FOR THE PRESENCE OF QUEEN DOUBTED.\r\n\r\nIt is further asserted that if a hive loses its queen \"no pollen is\r\ncollected.\" Also, \"that such quantities are sometimes collected, and\r\nfill so many cells, that too little room is left for brood, and the\r\nstock rapidly dwindles away in consequence.\" The first of these\r\nassertions has been given as a test to decide whether the hive contains\r\na queen or not. Now my bees have such a habit of doing things wrong\r\nthat the above is no test whatever. It is made to appear very well in\r\ntheory, but wants the truth in practice. I will say what I have known\r\non this point, and perhaps clear up the difficulty of a stock\r\ncontaining an unusual quantity of bee-bread with the honey, and instead\r\nof being the cause of its having but few bees, it is the effect. Stocks\r\nand sometimes swarms lose their queen in the swarming season, (the\r\nparticulars will be given in another place,) when, instead of remaining\r\nidle, the usual quantity of both _pollen and honey is collected_\r\n(unless the family is very small). There being no larvæ to consume the\r\nbread, the consequence is, more than half the breeding cells will\r\ncontain it; they will be packed about two-thirds full, and finished out\r\nwith honey. I have known a large family left under such circumstances,\r\nand about all the cells in the hive would be occupied. Whereas, in a\r\nstock containing a queen and rearing brood, _a portion of the combs\r\nwill be used for this purpose until the flowers fail_, and then such\r\ncomb will be found empty.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXTRA QUANTITY OF POLLEN NOT ALWAYS DETRIMENTAL.\r\n\r\nTo test whether this extra quantity of bee-bread was so _very_\r\ndetrimental, I have introduced into such hive in the fall a family with\r\na queen and wintered them in it, and watched their prosperity another\r\nyear, and never found them less profitable on that account. I am so\r\nwell satisfied of this, that whenever I now have a hive in such a\r\nsituation, it is a rule to introduce a swarm.\r\n\r\nIt is calculated, I believe, generally, that when medium-sized hives\r\nare full, about seven-eighths of the cells are made the proper diameter\r\nfor raising the workers, the remainder for drones, except a few for\r\nqueens. Here is one circumstance I do not remember to have seen\r\nmentioned, and that is, bee-bread is generally packed exclusively in\r\nthe worker cells. I would say always; but I would do better to be\r\ncareful, especially as I find my bees doing things so differently from\r\nsome others. I might as well remark here, that when taking combs from a\r\nhive filled with honey, if such pieces were selected as contained only\r\nthe large or drone cells, but little risk of bee-bread would occur; of\r\nthe other combs, the outside sheets and the corners of the others near\r\nthe top are the next best. The sheets of comb used principally for\r\nraising workers, and the cells next those so used, for an inch or two\r\nin width, are nearly all packed with pollen, and much of it will\r\nremain, when the breeding season is past. Smaller portions are found in\r\nthe worker cells in nearly all parts of the hive; even the boxes will\r\nsometimes contain a little.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANNER OF PACKING STORES.\r\n\r\nIn a glass hive, the bees may be seen depositing their load of pollen;\r\nthe legs holding the pellets are thrust into the cell, (not their\r\nheads), and a motion like rubbing them together is made for a half\r\nminute, when they are withdrawn, and the two little loaves of bread may\r\nbe seen at the bottom. This bee appears to take no farther care about\r\nthem, but another will soon come along, and enter the cell head first,\r\nand pack it close; this cell is filled about two-thirds of its length\r\nin this way, and when sealed over a little honey is used to fill it\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHY IN FILLING A CELL WITH HONEY.\r\n\r\nTo witness the operation of depositing honey, a glass hive or box is\r\nrequisite; the edges of the combs will be attached to the glass--when\r\nhoney is abundant, most of these cells next the glass will contain\r\nsome. Now is the time to see the operation, glass forming one side of\r\nsuch as are in contact, &c. The bee may be seen to enter the cell till\r\nit reaches the bottom; with its tongue, the first particle is\r\ndeposited, and brushed into the corners or angles, carefully excluding\r\nall the air from behind it--as it is filled, that next the sides of the\r\ncell is kept in advance of the centre. The bee does not put its tongue\r\nin the centre and pour out its load there, but carefully brushes the\r\nsides as it fills, excluding every particle of air, and keeps the\r\nsurface concave instead of convex. This is just as a philosopher would\r\nsay it should be. If it was filled at once and no care taken to attach\r\nit to the sides, why, the external air would never keep it there, which\r\nit does effectually when of ordinary length. When the cell is about\r\none-fourth of an inch deep they often commence filling it, and as it is\r\nlengthened they add to it, keeping it within an eighth of an inch of\r\nthe end; it is never quite full till nearly sealed over, and often not\r\nthen. In cells of the worker size, the sealing seldom touches the\r\nhoney. But in the size for drones the case is different; the honey on\r\nthe end touches the sealing, about half the diameter on the lower side;\r\nit is kept in the same shape while being filled; but being somewhat\r\nlarger, the atmospheric pressure is less effectual in keeping the honey\r\nin its place; consequently, when they commence sealing these cells they\r\nbegin on the lower side and finish at the top.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG CELLS SOMETIMES TURNED UPWARD.\r\n\r\nWhen storing honey in boxes, cells of this size are usually much\r\nlonger, in which case they are crooked, the ends turning upward,\r\nsometimes half an inch or more; this, of course, will prevent the honey\r\nfrom running, but if the box is taken off and turned over before such\r\ncells are sealed, they are very sure to spill most of their contents.\r\nThe cells in the breeding apartment, of ordinary length, will hold the\r\nhoney well enough as long as horizontal; but turn the hive on its side,\r\nand bring the open end downward, in hot weather, or break out a piece\r\nand hold it in that position, the air will not sustain it in them, but\r\nwill, in the size suitable for workers.\r\n\r\nWhen the hive is fully supplied with bees and honey, (unless destitute\r\nof a queen,) I never examined one, winter or summer, but it had a\r\nnumber of unsealed cells containing honey, as well as pollen; it is so\r\nwhen they have stored fifty pounds in boxes, even when so crowded for\r\nroom as to store honey outside or under the bottom-board; ever having\r\nsome cells open for a ready supply.\r\n\r\nYoung swarms seem unwilling to construct combs faster than needed for\r\nuse; it would appear, at first thought, to be a lack of economy. When\r\nno honey is to be obtained and nothing to do, then it would seem to be\r\na fine chance for getting ready for a yield; but this is not _their_\r\nway of doing business; whether they cannot spare the honey already\r\ncollected to elaborate the wax, or whether they find it more difficult\r\nto keep the worms from a large quantity of comb, I shall not decide. Of\r\nthis I am satisfied, that it is better arranged by their instincts,\r\nthan we could do it. Large swarms, when first located, if honey is\r\nabundant, will extend their combs from top to bottom in a little more\r\nthan two weeks; but such hive is not yet full; some sheets of comb may\r\ncontain honey throughout their whole length, and not a cell be sealed\r\nover; but, however, they generally find time to finish up within a few\r\ninches of the lower end as they proceed. Whenever unfinished cells\r\ncontain honey, it will generally be removed soon after the flowers\r\nfail, and used before that which is sealed; and the cells will remain\r\nempty till another year.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS A DRY OR WET SEASON BEST FOR HONEY?\r\n\r\nThe inquiry is often made, \"What kind of season is best for bees, wet\r\nor dry?\" This point I have watched very closely, and have found that a\r\nmedium between the two extremes produces most honey. When farmers begin\r\nto express fears of a drought, then is the time (if in the season of\r\nflowers) that most honey is obtained; but if dry weather passes these\r\nlimits, the quantity is greatly diminished. Of the two extremes,\r\nperhaps very wet is the worst.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MANY STOCKS SHOULD BE KEPT.\r\n\r\n\"What number of stocks can there be kept in one place?\" is another\r\nquestion often asked. This is like Mr. A. asking farmer B. how many\r\ncattle could be pastured in a lot of ten acres. Farmer B. would first\r\nwish to know how much pasture said lot would produce, before he could\r\nbegin to answer; since one lot of that size might produce ten times as\r\nmuch as the other. So with bees, one apiary of two hundred stocks might\r\nfind honey in abundance for all, and another of forty might almost\r\nstarve. Like the cattle, it depends on pasture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF HONEY.\r\n\r\nThere are three principal sources of honey, viz.:--clover, basswood,\r\nand buckwheat. But clover is the only universal dependance; as that is\r\nalmost everywhere, to some extent, in the country. Buckwheat in some\r\nplaces is the main source; in others, basswood, which is of brief\r\nduration. Where all three are abundant, there is the true El Dorado of\r\nthe apiarian! With plenty of clover and buckwheat, it is nearly as\r\nwell. Even with clover alone, enormous quantities of honey are\r\nobtained. I have said what was our dependence in this section. I will\r\nfurther say that within a circle of three or four miles, there are kept\r\nabout three hundred stocks. I have had for several years, three\r\napiaries about two miles apart, averaging in spring a little more than\r\nfifty in each. When a good season for clover occurs, as many more would\r\nprobably do equally well, but in some other seasons I have had too\r\nmany; on an average nearly right. When clover furnishes too little\r\nhoney for the number, buckwheat usually supplies more than is\r\ncollected. Of surplus honey, the proportion is about fifteen pounds of\r\nbuckwheat to one of clover. I have now been speaking of large apiaries.\r\nThere can hardly be a section of country found, that man can procure\r\nhis living, but what a few stocks would thrive, even if there were no\r\ndependence on the sources just mentioned. There will be some\r\nhoney-yielding flowers in nearly all places. The evil of over-stocking\r\nis of short duration, and will work its own cure speedily. Some\r\njudgment is required here as well as in other matters.\r\n\r\nAnother question of some interest, is the distance that a bee will\r\ntravel in search of honey in flowers--it is evident that it will be\r\nfarther than they will go to plunder a stock. I have heard of their\r\nbeing found seven miles from home. It was said they ascertained, by\r\nsprinkling flour on them as they left the hive in the morning, and then\r\nsaw the same bees that distance away. When we consider the chances of\r\nfinding a bee even one mile from the hive thus marked, it appears like\r\na \"poor look;\" and then pollen the color of flour might deceive us. It\r\nis difficult to prove that bees go even two miles. Let us say we guess\r\nat it, for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWAX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe careless, unreflecting observer, when seeing the bees enter the\r\nhive with a pellet of pollen on each of their posterior legs, is very\r\napt to conclude that it must be material for comb, as it appears unlike\r\nhoney. So little regard is paid to the matter by many people, that they\r\nare unable to imagine any other use for it. Others suppose that it will\r\nchange from that to honey, after being stored a time in the hive, and\r\nwonder at the curious phenomenon; but when asked how long a time must\r\nelapse before it takes place, they cannot tell exactly, but they \"have\r\nfound cells where it began to change, as a portion near the outer end\r\nof the cell had become honey, and no doubt the remainder would in\r\ntime.\" It has been remarked that cells were only filled about\r\ntwo-thirds full of this, and finished with honey; now when any one\r\nfinds a cell filled to the brim with pollen, and no honey, such\r\nreasoning will apply better. If this was the case, by examining at\r\ndifferent periods through the summer, we certainly should find some\r\ncells before the change had commenced, instead of their always being in\r\njust this stage of transition.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS POLLEN CONVERTED INTO WAX?\r\n\r\nAs for pollen being converted into wax or comb, a simple question will\r\nshow its fallacy. Do not the bees belonging to a hive that is full of\r\ncombs, and no more wax for that purpose needed, bring home as much and\r\noften more pollen than one half full? Any person who has watched two\r\nsuch hives five minutes when busily engaged at work, can answer. It is\r\nevident, then, that pollen is for something else besides wax.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW IS IT OBTAINED?\r\n\r\nThe inquiry is now made, \"Where do they get it from, if not from\r\npollen?\" I might with propriety answer, they don't get it at all.\r\n\"Stop, there, if you please; if you expect us to credit you, you must\r\nnot give us too much absurdity.\" Well, let me ask a question. Do\r\ncattle when grazing actually obtain flesh, bone, &c., or only the\r\nmaterials from which these parts are secreted? As to the production of\r\nwax, I believe all close observers (that I have found) agree that it is\r\na secretion natural only to the bee. With the ox, fruit, grain, or\r\ngrass may be converted into tallow; with the bee, honey and syrup made\r\nof sugar may be converted into wax. These are probably the only two\r\nsubstances yet discovered from which they extract it. Some writers have\r\npretended that pollen is also used, but they have failed to prove that\r\nthe old bees consume it at any time; which they must in this case if it\r\nis converted into wax. From experiments related by Huber, either of\r\nthese substances, mixed with a little water, is all sufficient for its\r\nproduction. From experiments of my own, I am satisfied that he is\r\ncorrect. The experiment is tried by shutting up a swarm when first\r\nhived; feeding them with honey--a few of the bees will probably have\r\nsome pollen, though not enough to make a comb three inches square, yet\r\nit is something--and to be certain, time must be given them to exhaust\r\nit. In three or four days take out the bees and remove the combs;\r\ninclose them again, and feed with honey as before. Repeat the process,\r\nuntil satisfied that no pollen is needed in the composition of wax.\r\nHuber removed the combs \"five times,\" with the same result at every\r\ntrial. Whenever bees are _confined_ in hot weather, _air and water are\r\nabsolutely necessary_.\r\n\r\nWe will now describe the first appearance of wax, and how it is\r\nproduced. When a swarm of bees is about leaving the parent stock,\r\nthree-fourths or more of them will fill their sacks with honey. When\r\nlocated in their new home, of course no cells exist to hold it; it must\r\nremain in the stomach or sack for several hours. The consequence is,\r\nthat thin white scales of wax the sixteenth of an inch in diameter,\r\nsomewhat circular, are formed between the rings of the abdomen, under\r\nside. With the claws of one of their hind legs one of these is detached\r\nand conveyed to the mouth, and there pinched with their forceps or\r\nteeth, until one edge is worked somewhat rough; it is then applied to\r\nthe comb being constructed, or to the roof of the hive. The first\r\nrudiments of comb are often applied within the first half hour after\r\nthe swarm is hived. In the history of insects before noticed, is a\r\nminute account of the first foundation of combs, somewhat amusing, if\r\nnot instructive.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUBER'S ACCOUNT OF A COMMENCEMENT OF COMB.\r\n\r\nHuber, it is said, \"having provided a hive with honey and water, it was\r\nresorted to in crowds by bees, who, having satisfied their appetite,\r\nreturned to the hive. They formed festoons, remained motionless for\r\ntwenty-four hours, and after a time scales of wax appeared. An adequate\r\nsupply of wax for the construction of a comb having been elaborated,\r\none of them disengaged itself from the centre of the group, and\r\nclearing a space about an inch in diameter, at the top of the hive,\r\napplied the pincers of one of its legs to its side, detached a scale of\r\nwax, and immediately began to mince it with the tongue. During the\r\noperation, this organ was made to assume every variety of shape;\r\nsometimes it appeared like a trowel, then flattened like a spatula, and\r\nat other times like a pencil, ending in a point. The scale, moistened\r\nwith a frothy liquid, became glutinous, and was drawn out like a\r\nriband. This bee then attached all the wax it could concoct to the\r\nvault of the hive, and went its way. A second now succeeded, and did\r\nthe like; a third followed, but owing to some blunder did not put the\r\nwax in the same line with its predecessor; upon which another bee,\r\napparently sensible of the defect, removed the displaced wax, and\r\ncarrying it to the former heap, deposited it there, exactly in the\r\norder and direction pointed out.\" Now I have some objections to make to\r\nthis account. First, in the usual course of swarming, it is unnecessary\r\nto provide the honey and water, as they come laden with honey from the\r\nparent stock. Next, to form festoons and remain motionless twenty-four\r\nhours to concoct the wax, is not the way they generally manage affairs.\r\nThey either swallow the honey before leaving home long enough to have\r\nthe wax ready, or less time than twenty-four hours is needed to produce\r\nit. I have frequently found lumps, half the size of a pin's head,\r\nattached to the branch of a tree where they had clustered, when they\r\nhad not been there over twenty-five minutes. I have had occasion a few\r\ntimes to change the swarm to another tenement, an hour or two after\r\nbeing hived, and found places on the top nearly covered with wax. How\r\nit was managed to see a bee quit the \"group,\" is more than I can\r\ncomprehend; and then the tongue to be the only instrument used to mould\r\nthe scale of wax, is another difficulty; to witness the whole process\r\nminutely in this stage of comb-making has never been my good fortune,\r\nand I am sometimes inclined to doubt the success of others. I have had\r\nglass hives, and put swarms in them, and always found the first\r\nrudiments of comb so entirely covered with bees as to prevent my seeing\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEST TIME TO WITNESS COMB-MAKING.\r\n\r\nThe only time when I have witnessed the process with any degree of\r\nsatisfaction is when the combs approach the glass, and but few bees in\r\nthe way; then, by watching patiently a few minutes, some part of the\r\nprocess may be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANNER OF WORKING WAX.\r\n\r\nTransferring the swarms to different hives from one to forty-eight\r\nhours after being hived, will show their progress. I have found that\r\nwax is attached to the top of the hive at first promiscuously, that is,\r\nwithout the least order, until some of the blocks or lumps are\r\nsufficiently advanced for them to begin cells. The scales of wax are\r\nwelded on the edge quite thick, without regard to the shape of the\r\ncell, then an excavation is made on one side for the bottom of a cell,\r\nand two others on the opposite side; the division between them exactly\r\nopposite the centre of the first. When this piece is an inch or two in\r\nlength, two other pieces at equal distances on each side are commenced.\r\nIf the swarm is large, and honey abundant, it is common for two pieces\r\nof comb to be started at one time on different parts of the top; the\r\nsheets in the two places are often at right angles, or any other way,\r\njust as chance happens to give direction. The little lumps that are\r\nplaced at random at first are all removed as they advance.\r\n\r\nWhile the combs are in progress, the edges are always kept much the\r\nthickest, and the base of the cell is worked down to the proper\r\nthickness with their teeth, and polished smooth as glass. The ends of\r\nthe cell also, as they lengthen them, will always be found much thicker\r\nthan any other part of it when finished.\r\n\r\nWhen two combs approach each other in the middle of the hive at nearly\r\nright angles, an edge of comb is left there; but when an obtuse angle,\r\nthe edges are generally joined, making a sheet of crooked comb. It is\r\nevident where the two combs join, there must be some irregular cells\r\nunfit for rearing brood.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROOKED COMBS A DISADVANTAGE.\r\n\r\nThese few irregular cells have been considered a great disadvantage. It\r\nis thought, or pretended, that there is a vast difference between the\r\nprosperity of a stock with straight combs and one with crooked ones. To\r\navoid them, or cause the bees to make them all straight, has given rise\r\nto much contrivance, as if a few such cells could effect much. Suppose\r\nthere were a dozen sheets of comb in a hive, and each one had a row or\r\nmore of such irregular cells from top to bottom, what proportion would\r\nthey hold to those that were perfect? Perhaps not one in a thousand.\r\nHence we infer that in a hive of the proper size, the difference in\r\namount of brood never could be perceived. This is the only difference\r\nit can make, because such cells can be used for storing honey as well\r\nas others. But sometimes there will be corners and spaces not wide\r\nenough for two combs, and too wide for one of the proper thickness for\r\nbreeding. As bees use all their room economically, and generally at the\r\nbest advantage, a thick comb will be the result. It is said they never\r\nuse such thick combs for breeding. How are the facts? I have just such\r\na space in a glass hive; one comb two inches thick. How is it managed?\r\nTowards fall this sheet is filled with honey; the cells outside are\r\nlengthened until there is just room for a bee to pass between them and\r\nthe glass, when they are sealed over. In spring these long cells are\r\nall cut down (except at the top and upper corners) to the proper length\r\nfor breeding, and used for this purpose. This has been done for five\r\nyears in succession.\r\n\r\nI will grant that there is a little waste room in such spaces, for part\r\nof the year. It amounts to but little, as it is only outside. They are\r\nnecessitated to make such combs, because the inside combs, if built in\r\na breeding apartment, however crooked one may be, the next one will\r\ngenerally match it, the right distance from it. But when they are built\r\nexpressly for storing honey, in such as are made in boxes, the right\r\ndistance is not so well preserved; hence it is not recommended to\r\ncompel bees to use such storing apartment for breeding. But suppose we\r\nshould compel a swarm to labor under these disadvantages, I should not\r\napprehend such disastrous results, (providing they have a proper\r\nproportion of worker cells,) as no swarms, or even no surplus honey, as\r\nhas been represented. Imagine a hive filled with combs that are all too\r\nthick, and room wasted when cut down, to the amount of one-fourth of\r\nall that is in the hive. Now here are combs enough left to mature\r\nthree-fourths as many bees as in an ordinary hive, where all are right.\r\nWe can now suppose a good swarm will bring home the same amount of\r\nhoney as though it belonged to other hives; only three-fourths as much\r\ncan be fed to the brood, and stored in the hive; and the result ought\r\nto be, that we get a quarter more surplus honey in boxes. Even if we\r\nget no swarm, I cannot see how our surplus honey can be less, as in\r\nthis case there would be more bees at all times than in a hive that had\r\nbeen reduced by swarming.\r\n\r\nDoes experience substantiate the theory that stocks with crooked combs\r\nare as profitable as when they are straight? When combs are built\r\nexpressly for breeding, I could never discover any difference. Any\r\nperson can easily test it by a little observation; not by taking a\r\nsolitary instance of only one hive, because some other cause might\r\nproduce the result. Take a half-dozen at least with straight combs, and\r\nas many with them crooked; have them all alike in other respects, and\r\ncarefully watch the result. I think you will have but little interest\r\nwhich way the combs are made, providing _they are made_, as far as\r\nprofit is concerned. It is true, it would gratify order to have them\r\nall straight, and if it was not attended with more trouble than the\r\nresult would pay for, it would be well to have them so.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary circumstances, when a swarm is first hived, they set about\r\ncomb-making immediately; yet sometimes they will remain two days, and\r\nnot make a particle. I have known them to swarm out and cluster in the\r\nusual way, and when rehived, commence at once. This seems to prove that\r\nthey can retain the wax, or prevent secreting it, till wanted. This\r\nseldom occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCERTAINTY IN WEIGHT OF BEES.\r\n\r\nA large swarm will probably carry with them some five or six pounds of\r\nhoney from the parent stock. I only guess at this, because I am\r\nuncertain what the bees weigh exactly. \"I can tell you,\" some one\r\nexclaims, \"I saw some weighed,--so many weigh just eight ounces.\" Are\r\nyou sure there was nothing but bees weighed? Was there no honey,\r\nbee-bread, fæces, or other substance, that might deceive you? \"Can't\r\nsay; I never thought of that!\" Now it is important, if we weigh bees to\r\nknow _their_ weight, to be sure we weigh nothing else. It is evident,\r\nthat if five thousand weigh three pounds, when nothing is in their\r\nsacks, they would weigh, when filled with honey, several pounds more.\r\nHence, the fallacy of judging of the size of a swarm by weight, as one\r\nswarm might issue with half the honey of another. Perhaps eight pounds,\r\nfor large swarms, might be an average for bees and honey. This honey,\r\nwhatever it amounts to, cannot be stored till combs are constructed to\r\nhold it. This principle holds good till the hive is full. That is,\r\nwhenever they have more honey than the combs will hold, if there is\r\nroom in the hive, they construct more. But they seem to go no farther\r\nthan this in comb-making. However large the swarm may be, this\r\ncompulsion appears necessary to fill the hive. Drone-cells are seldom\r\nmade in the top of the hive, but a part are generally joined on the\r\nworker-cells, a little distance from the top; others near the bottom.\r\nThere seems to be no rule about the number of such cells. Some hives\r\nwill contain twice the number of others. It may depend on the yield of\r\nhoney at the time; when very plenty, more drone-cells, &c. If the hive\r\nbe very large, no doubt an unprofitable number would be constructed.\r\nWhere the large and small cells join, there will be some cells of\r\nirregular shape; some with four or five angles; the distance from one\r\nangle to the other is also varied. Even where two combs of cells the\r\nsame size join, making a straight comb, they are not always perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME WAX WASTED.\r\n\r\nWhen constructing comb, they are constantly wasting wax, either\r\naccidentally or voluntarily. The next morning after a swarm is located,\r\nthe scales may be found, and will continue to increase as long as they\r\nare working it; the quantity often amounts to a handful or more. It is\r\nthe best test of comb-making that I can give. Clean off the board and\r\nlook the next morning, you will find the scales in proportion to their\r\nprogress. Some will be nearly round as at first; others more or less\r\nworked up, and a part will be like fine saw-dust.\r\n\r\nHuber and some others have divided the working bees into different\r\nclasses, denominating some wax-workers, others nurses, and pollen\r\ngatherers, &c. It may be partially true, but how it was found out is\r\nthe mystery.\r\n\r\nThe angles in the cells used for brood, are gradually filled, and after\r\na time become round, both at the ends and sides.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER NECESSARY TO COMB-MAKING.\r\n\r\nWhenever bees are engaged making comb, a supply of water is absolutely\r\nnecessary. Some think it requisite in rearing brood. It may be needed\r\nfor that, or it may be required for both purposes; but yet I have\r\ndoubts if a particle is given to the young bee, besides what the honey\r\ncontains. June, and first part of July, and most part of August (the\r\nseason of buckwheat,) are periods of extensive comb-making; they then\r\nuse most water; breeding is carried on from March till October, and as\r\nextensively in May, perhaps more so, than in August, yet not a tenth\r\npart of the water is used in May.\r\n\r\nI have known stocks repeatedly to mature brood from the egg to the\r\nperfect bee, when shut in a dark room for months, when it was\r\nimpossible to obtain a drop; also stocks that stand in the cold, (if\r\ngood,) will mature some brood whether the bees can leave the hive or\r\nnot. These facts prove that some are reared without water. As they get\r\nsufficient honey to require more comb to store it, they will at the\r\nsame time have a brood; and it is easy to guess they need it for brood\r\nas comb, without a little investigation. This much is certain, that\r\nthey use water at such times for some purpose, and when no pond, brook,\r\nspring, or other source is within convenient distance, the apiarian\r\nwould find it economy to place some within their reach, as it would\r\nsave much valuable time, if they would otherwise have to go a great\r\ndistance, when they might be more profitably employed; it always\r\nhappens in a season of honey. It should be so situated that the bees\r\nmay obtain it without jeopardizing their lives;--a barrel or pail has\r\nsides so steep that a great many will slip off and drown. A trough made\r\nvery shallow, with a good broad strip around the edge to afford an\r\nalighting place, should be provided. The middle should contain a float,\r\nor a handful of shavings spread in the water with a few small stones\r\nlaid on them to prevent their being blown away when the water is out,\r\nis very convenient. A tin dish an inch or so in depth, will do very\r\nwell. The quantity needed may be ascertained by what is used--only give\r\nthem enough, and change it daily. I have no trouble of this kind, as\r\nthere is a stream of water within a few rods of the hives; but I have\r\nan opportunity to witness something of the number engaged in carrying\r\nit. Thousands may be seen (in June and August) filling their sacks,\r\nwhile a continual stream is on the wing, going and returning.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nThe exact and uniform size of their cells is perhaps as great a mystery\r\nas anything pertaining to them; yet, we find the second wonder before\r\nwe are done with the first. In building comb, they have no square or\r\ncompass as a guide; no master mechanic takes the lead, measuring and\r\nmarking for the workmen; each individual among them is a finished\r\nmechanic! No time is lost as an apprentice, no service given in return\r\nfor instruction! Each is accomplished from birth! All are alike; what\r\none begins, a dozen may help to finish! A specimen of their work shows\r\nitself to be from the hands of master workmen, and may be taken as a\r\nmodel of perfection! He, who arranged the universe, was their\r\ninstructor. Yes, a profound geometrician planned the first cell, and\r\nknowing what would be their wants, implanted in the sensorium of the\r\nfirst bee, all things pertaining to their welfare; the impress then\r\ngiven, is yet retained unimpaired! They need no lectures on domestic\r\neconomy to tell them, by using the base of one set of cells on one side\r\nof their combs, for the base of those on the opposite, will save both\r\nlabor and wax; no mathematician that a pyramidal base, just three\r\nangles, with just such an inclination, will be the exact shape needed,\r\nand consume much less wax than round or square--that the base of one\r\ncell of three angles, would form a part of the base of three other\r\ncells on the opposite side of the comb--that each of the six sides of\r\none cell forms one side of six others around it--that these angles and\r\nthese only would answer their ends.\r\n\r\n\"The bees appear,\" says Reaumer, \"to have a problem to solve, which\r\nwould puzzle many a mathematician. A quantity of matter being given, it\r\nis required to form out of it cells, which shall be equal, and similar,\r\nand of a determinate size, but the largest possible with relation to\r\nthe quantity of matter employed, while they shall occupy the least\r\npossible space!\"\r\n\r\nHow little does the epicure heed, when feasting on the fruits of their\r\nindustry, that each morsel tasted must destroy the most perfect\r\nspecimens of workmanship! that in a moment he can demolish what it has\r\ntaken hours, yes days, perhaps weeks, of assiduous toil and labor, for\r\nthe bees to accomplish!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPROPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT USED FOR.\r\n\r\nThis substance is first used to solder up all the cracks, flaws, and\r\nirregularities about the hive. A coat is then spread over the inside\r\nthroughout; when the hive is full, and many bees cluster outside, the\r\nlatter part of summer, a coat of it is also spread there. An additional\r\ncoat it seems is annually applied, as old hives will be coated with a\r\nthickness proportionate to its age, providing it has been occupied with\r\na strong family. Huber has said it was also used to strengthen the\r\ncells when first made, by mixing it with the wax. If it was their\r\npractice at that time, the practice has been abandoned by our bees to a\r\ngreat extent. I have made examinations when comb was first made, when\r\nit contained eggs, and when it contained larvæ, and have never been\r\nable to find anything other than pure wax composing it. After a young\r\nbee has matured in a cell, the coating or cocoon that it leaves is of a\r\ndark color, somewhat resembling it, and may have given rise to the\r\nsupposition. How the article is obtained, appears to be the mystery.\r\nThis is a subject about which apiarians have failed to agree. A few\r\ncontend that it is an elaborated substance; while others assert it to\r\nbe a resinous gum, exuding from certain trees, and collected by the\r\nbees like pollen. It differs materially from wax, being more tenacious,\r\nand when it gets a little age, much harder.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS IT AN ELABORATE OR NATURAL SUBSTANCE?\r\n\r\nNo modern observer has ever been able to detect the bees in the act of\r\ngathering it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUBER'S OPINION.\r\n\r\nHuber tells us, that \"near the outlet of one of his hives, he placed\r\nsome of the branches of the poplar, which exuded a transparent juice,\r\nthe color of garnet. Several workers were soon seen perched upon these\r\nbranches,--having detached some of this resinous gum, they formed it\r\ninto pellets, and deposited them in the baskets of their thighs; thus\r\nloaded, they flew to the hive, where some of their fellow-laborers\r\ninstantly came to assist them in detaching this viscid substance from\r\ntheir baskets.\" Some of our modern apiarians have doubted this account\r\nof Huber's. Now, in the absence of anything positive on this subject, I\r\nam inclined to adopt this theory; that it is a resin or gum produced by\r\ntrees. (I cannot say that I am exactly satisfied with the story of\r\nbringing the \"branches and laying them by the hive,\" &c.) That bees\r\ngather it in its natural state, is in accordance with my own\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER PROOF.\r\n\r\nOur first swarms that issue in May, or first of June, seldom use much\r\nof the article pure for soldering and plastering; but instead, a\r\ncomposition, the most of which is wax. I have noticed at this season,\r\nwhen old pieces of boards that had been used for hives, were left in\r\nthe sun, that this old propolis would become soft in the middle of the\r\nday. Here I have frequently seen the bees at work, packing it upon\r\ntheir legs; it was detached in small particles, and the process of\r\npacking was seen distinctly, as the bee did not fly during the\r\noperation, as in the case of packing pollen. It is asserted that when\r\nbees need it they always have it, indicating that they can elaborate it\r\nlike wax. I can see no reason why they do not need it in June as much\r\nas August; yet, in the latter month, they use more than a hundred times\r\nthe quantity. At this time, they manifest no disposition to gather any\r\nfrom the old boards, &c. It would seem they prefer the article new,\r\nwhich they now have in abundance. Boxes filled in June contain but very\r\nlittle, sometimes none. Why not, if they have enough of it? but when\r\nfilled in August, they always have the corners, and sometimes the top\r\nand sides, lined with a good coat. Cracks, large enough for bees to\r\npass through, are sometimes completely filled with it. In this season,\r\na little before sunset of some fair day, I have frequently seen the\r\nbees enter the hive with what I supposed to be the pure article on\r\ntheir legs, like pollen, except the surface, which would be smooth and\r\nglossy; the color much lighter than when it gets age. I have also seen\r\nthem through the glass inside, when they seemed unable to dislodge it\r\nthemselves, like pollen, and were continually running around among\r\nthose engaged in soldering and plastering; when one required a little,\r\nit seized hold of the pellet with its teeth or forceps, and detached a\r\nportion. The whole lump will not cleave off at once; but firmly adheres\r\nto the leg; from its tenacity, perhaps a string an inch long will be\r\nformed in separating, the piece obtained is immediately applied to\r\ntheir work, and the bee is ready to supply another with a portion; it\r\ndoubtless gets rid of its load in this way; it is difficult to watch it\r\ntill it is freed from the whole, as it is soon lost among its fellows.\r\nNow if this substance is not found in its natural state, how does it\r\nhappen that they pack it on their legs just as they do when getting it\r\nfrom a board of an old hive, or pollen, when collected? They never take\r\nthe trouble to pack the wax there, when elaborated. Do not these\r\ncircumstances strongly favor the idea of its being a vegetable\r\nsubstance? Perhaps the reason of its being collected at this season in\r\ngreater abundance, may be found in the fact, that the buds of trees and\r\nshrubs are now generally formed. Many kinds are protected from rain and\r\nfrost, by a kind of gum or resinous coating. It may be found in many\r\nspecies of Populus, particularly the balsam poplar, (_Populus\r\nBalsamifera_) and the Balm of Gilead, (_Populus Candicans_). By boiling\r\nthe buds of these trees, an aromatic resin or gum may be obtained,\r\n(used sometimes for making salve;) the odor is very similar to that\r\nemitted by propolis, when first gathered by the bees, or by heating it\r\nafterwards. In the absence of facts, we are apt to substitute theory.\r\nThis appears to me to be very plausible. Yet I am ready to yield it as\r\nsoon as facts decide differently. Perhaps not one bee in a thousand is\r\nengaged in collecting this substance--there being so few may be one\r\nreason why they are not often detected, yet few as they are, a few of\r\nus should set about close observation; something certain might decide.\r\nApiarian science is sadly neglected; a large amount of error is mixed\r\nup with truth, that patient, scrutinizing investigation must separate.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nI feel anxious to get to the practical part of this work, which I hope\r\nwill interest some readers who care but little about the natural\r\nhistory. I shall begin with spring, and will now endeavor to mix more\r\nof the practical with it, as we proceed to the end of the year. In\r\norder to illustrate some points of practice, I may have occasion to\r\nrepeat some things already mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE APIARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nITS LOCATION.\r\n\r\nIn the location of the apiary, one important consideration is, that it\r\nis convenient to watch in the swarming season; that the bees may be\r\nseen at any time from a door or window, when a swarm rises, without the\r\ntrouble of taking many steps to accomplish it; because if much trouble\r\nis to be taken, it is too often neglected. Also, if possible, the hives\r\nshould stand where the wind will have but little effect, especially\r\nfrom the northwest. If no hills or building offer a protection, a\r\nclose, high board fence should be put up for the purpose. It is economy\r\nto do it--bees enough may be saved to pay the expense. During the first\r\nspring months, the stocks contain fewer bees than at any other season.\r\nIt is then that a numerous family is important, for the purpose of\r\ncreating animal heat to rear the brood, if for nothing else. One bee is\r\nof more consequence now than a half dozen in midsummer. When the hive\r\nstands in a bleak place, the bees returning with heavy loads, in a high\r\nwind, are frequently unable to strike the hive, and are blown to the\r\nground; become chilled, and die. A chilly south wind is equally fatal,\r\nbut not so frequent. When protected from winds, the hives may front any\r\npoint you choose; east or south is generally preferred. A location near\r\nponds, lakes, large rivers, &c., will be attended with some loss. Hard\r\nwinds will fatigue the bees when on the wing, often causing them to\r\nalight in the water; where it is impossible to rise again until wafted\r\nashore, and then, unless in very warm weather, they are so chilled as\r\nto be past the effort. I do not mention this to discourage any one from\r\nkeeping them, when so situated, because some few must keep them thus or\r\nnot at all. I am so situated myself. There is a pond of four acres,\r\nsome twelve rods off. In spring, during high winds, a great many may be\r\nfound drowned, and driven on shore. Although we cannot miss so few from\r\na stock, it is nevertheless a loss as far as it goes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECIDE EARLY.\r\n\r\nWhatever location is chosen, it should be decided upon as early in the\r\nspring as possible; because, when the chilling winds of winter have\r\nceased for a day, and the sun, unobstructed, is sending his first warm\r\nrays to a frozen earth, the bees that have been inactive for months,\r\nfeel the cheering influence, and come forth to enjoy the balmy air. As\r\nthey come from their door, they pause a moment to rub their eyes, which\r\nhave long been obscured in darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEES MARK THEIR LOCATION ON LEAVING THE HIVE.\r\n\r\nThey rise on the wing, but do not leave in a direct line, but\r\nimmediately turn their heads towards the entrance of their tenement,\r\ndescribing a circle of only a few inches at first, but enlarge as they\r\nrecede, until an area of several rods have been _viewed and marked_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGING STAND ATTENDED WITH LOSS.\r\n\r\nAfter a few excursions, when surrounding objects have become familiar,\r\nthis precaution is not taken, and they leave in a direct line for their\r\ndestination, and return by their way-marks without difficulty. Man with\r\nhis reason is guided on the same principles. There are a great many\r\npeople who suppose the bee knows its hive by a kind of instinct, or is\r\nattracted towards it, like the steel to the magnet. At least, they act\r\nas if they did; as they often move their bees a few rods, or feet,\r\nafter the location is thus marked, and what is the consequence? The\r\nstocks are materially injured by loss of bees, and sometimes entirely\r\nruined. Let us trace the cause. As I remarked, the bees have marked the\r\nlocation. They leave the hive without any precaution, as surrounding\r\nobjects are familiar. They return to their old stand and find no home.\r\nIf there is more than one stock, and the removal has been from four to\r\ntwenty feet, some of the bees may find a hive, but just as liable to\r\nenter the wrong one as the right. Probably they would not go over\r\ntwenty feet, and very likely not that, unless the new situation was\r\nvery conspicuous. If a person had but one stock, very likely the loss\r\nwould be less, as every bee finding a hive, would be sure to be home,\r\nand none killed, as is generally the case when a few enter a strange\r\nhive.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAN BE TAKEN SOME DISTANCE.\r\n\r\nWhen bees are taken beyond their knowledge of country, some two miles\r\nor more, the case seems to be somewhat different, but not always\r\nwithout loss, especially if many hives are set too close. They leave\r\nthe hive of course without knowing that the situation has been changed;\r\nperhaps get a few feet before strange objects warn them of the fact.\r\nWhen they return, the immediate vicinity is strange, and they often\r\nenter their neighbors' domicil.\r\n\r\n\r\nDANGER OF SETTING STOCKS TOO CLOSE.\r\n\r\nA case in point occurred in the spring of '49. I sold over twenty\r\nstocks to one person. He had constructed a bee-house, and his\r\narrangement brought the hives within four inches of each other. The\r\nresult was, he entirely lost several stocks; some of them were the\r\nbest; others were materially injured, yet he had a few made better by\r\nthe addition of bees from other hives; (sometimes a stock will allow\r\nstrange bees to unite with them, but it is seldom, unless a large\r\nnumber enters--it is safest to keep each family by itself, under\r\nordinary circumstances). These stocks, before they were moved, had been\r\ncollecting pollen, and had their location well marked. Had they been\r\nplaced six feet apart, instead of four inches, he probably would not\r\nhave lost any, or even two feet might have saved them. I have often\r\nmoved them at this season, and placed them at three feet distance, and\r\nhad no bad results.\r\n\r\nFacts like the foregoing, satisfied me long since that stocks should\r\noccupy their situation for the summer, as early as possible in the\r\nspring, at least before they mark the location; or if they must be\r\nmoved after that, let it be nothing short of a mile and a half, and\r\nplenty of room between the hives.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPACE BETWEEN HIVES.\r\n\r\nAs regards the distance between hives generally, I would say let it be\r\nas great as convenience will allow. Want of room makes it necessary\r\nsometimes to set them close; where such necessity exists, if the hives\r\nwere dissimilar in color, some dark, others light, alternately, it\r\nwould greatly assist the bees in knowing their own hive. But it should\r\nbe borne in mind, that whenever economy of space dictates less than two\r\nfeet, there are often bees enough lost by entering the wrong hive,\r\nwhich, if saved, would pay the rent of a small addition to a garden, or\r\nbee-yard. I have several other reasons to offer for giving plenty of\r\nroom between hives, which will be mentioned hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL MATTERS.\r\n\r\nThe reader who is accustomed to doing things on gigantic principles,\r\nwill consider this long \"yarn\" about saving a few bees in spring, a\r\nrather small affair, and so it is; yet small matters must be attended\r\nto if we succeed; \"a small leak will sink a ship.\" A grain of wheat is\r\na small matter; 'tis only in the aggregate that its importance is\r\nmanifest. The bee is small, the load of honey brought home by it is\r\nstill less, and the quantity secreted in the nectary of each flower,\r\nyet _more minute_. The patient bee visits each, and obtains but a tiny\r\nmorsel; by perseverance a load is obtained, and deposited in the hive;\r\nit is only by the accumulation of such loads that we find an object\r\nworthy our notice: here is a lesson; look to little things, and the\r\nmanner in which they are multiplied, and preserved. It is much better\r\nto save our bees than waste them, and wait for others to be raised; \"a\r\npenny saved is worth two-pence earned.\" If a stock is lost by small\r\nmeans, a corresponding effort is only necessary to save it. This\r\ntrifling care is sometimes neglected through indolence. But I hope for\r\nbetter things generally; I am willing to believe it is thorough\r\nignorance, not knowing what kind of care is necessary--how, when, and\r\nwhere to bestow it. This is what now appears to be my duty to tell. You\r\nwill now sufficiently understand the cause of loss on this point;\r\ntherefore, let it be a rule to have all ready in spring, before the\r\nbees leave their hives--the stands, bee-house, etc., and not change\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMY.\r\n\r\nIf we keep bees for ornament, it would be well to build a bee-house,\r\npaint the hives, &c.; but as I expect the majority of readers will be\r\ninterested in the profit of the thing, I will say that the bees will\r\nnot pay a cent towards extra expenses; they will not do a whit more\r\nlabor in a painted house, than if it was thatched with straw. When\r\nprofit is the only object, economy would dictate that labor shall be\r\nbestowed only where there will be a remuneration.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEAP ARRANGEMENT OF STANDS.\r\n\r\nSo many kinds of bee-houses and stands have been recommended--all so\r\ndifferent from what I prefer, that I perhaps ought to feel some\r\nhesitancy in offering one so cheap and simple; but as profit is my\r\nobject, I shall offer no other apology. I have fifteen years'\r\nexperience to prove its efficacy, and have no fears on this score in\r\nrecommending it. I make stands in this way: a board about fifteen\r\ninches wide is cut off two feet long; a piece of chestnut or other\r\nwood, two inches square, is nailed on each end; this raises the board\r\njust two inches from the earth, and will project in front of the hive\r\nsome ten inches, making it admirably convenient for the bees to alight\r\nbefore entering the hive, (when the grass and weeds are kept down,\r\nwhich is but little trouble). A separate piece for each hive is better\r\nthan to have several on a bench together, as there can then be no\r\ncommunication by bees running to and fro. Also we are apt to give more\r\nroom between them; and a board or plank will make a stand for as many\r\nstocks when cut in pieces, as if left whole; (and it ought to make\r\nmore).\r\n\r\n\r\nCANAL BOTTOM-BOARD DISCARDED.\r\n\r\nI used what is termed a canal bottom-board, until I found out it did\r\nnot pay expense, and have now discarded it, and succeed just as well.\r\nIt is generally recommended as a preventive of robberies, and keeping\r\nout the moth. It may prevent one hive in fifty from being robbed; but\r\nas for keeping out the moth, it is about as good an assistant for it as\r\ncan be contrived. It is a place of great convenience for the worms to\r\nspin their cocoons, and some ingenuity of the apiarian is requisite to\r\nget at them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ADVANTAGE IN BEING NEAR THE EARTH.\r\n\r\nI am aware that I go counter to most apiarians, in recommending the\r\nstands so near the earth; less than two or three feet between the bees\r\nand the earth, it is said, will not answer any way. Mr. Miner is very\r\npositive on this point, in his Manual. I ventured to suggest to him,\r\nthat there was more against it in theory, than in practice, and gave\r\nhim my experience. In less than two years from that time I visited him,\r\nand found his bees close to the earth. Experience is worth a dozen\r\ntheories; in fact, it is the only test to be depended upon. I shall not\r\nurge the adoption of any rule, that I have not proved by my own\r\npractice. The objection raised, is dampness from the earth, when too\r\nnear; I am unable to perceive the least bad effect. Now let us compare\r\nadvantages and disadvantages a little farther. One hive or a row of\r\nhives suspended, or standing on a bench, two or three feet from the\r\nearth, when approached by the bees on a chilly afternoon, (and we have\r\nmany such in spring,) towards evening, even if there is not much wind,\r\nthey are very apt to miss the hive and bottom, and fall to the ground,\r\nso benumbed with cold, as to be unable to rise again, and by the next\r\nmorning are \"no use\" whatever. On the other hand, if they are near the\r\nearth, with a board as described, there is no _possibility_ of their\r\nalighting under the hive, and if they should come short, and get on the\r\nground, they can always creep, long after they are too cold to fly, and\r\nare able, and often do enter the hive without the necessity of using\r\ntheir wings.\r\n\r\nEnough may be saved in one spring, from a few hives, in this way, to\r\nmake a good swarm, which taken from several is not perceived; yet, as\r\nmuch profit from them might be realized, as if they were a swarm by\r\nthemselves. A little contrivance is all that is needed to save them. To\r\nsuch as _must_ and _will_ have them up away from the earth, I would\r\nsay, do suggest some plan to save this portion of your best and most\r\nwilling servants; have an alighting board project in front of the hive\r\nat least one foot, or a board long enough to reach from the bottom of\r\nthe hive to the ground, that they may get on that, and crawl up to the\r\nhive. Do you want the inducement? Examine minutely the earth about your\r\nhives, towards sunset, some day in April, when the day has been fair,\r\nwith some wind, and chilly towards night, and you will be astonished at\r\nthe numbers that perish. Most of them will be loaded with pollen,\r\nproving them martyrs to their own industry and your negligence. When I\r\nsee a bench three feet high and no wider than the bottom of the hive,\r\nperhaps a little less, and no place for the bees to enter but at the\r\nbottom, and as many hives crowded on as it will hold, I no longer\r\nwonder that \"bee-keeping is all in luck;\" the wonder is how they keep\r\nthem at all. Yet it proves that, with proper management, it is not so\r\nvery precarious after all.\r\n\r\nThe necessary protection from the weather, for stocks, is a subject\r\nthat I have taken some pains to ascertain; the result has been, that\r\nthe cheapest covering is just as good as any; something to keep the\r\nrain and rays of the sun from the top, is all sufficient. Covers for\r\neach hive, like the bottom-board, should be separate, and some larger\r\nthan the top.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTILITY OF BEE-HOUSES DOUBTED.\r\n\r\nI have used bee-houses, but they will not pay, and are also discarded.\r\nThey are objectionable on account of preventing a free circulation of\r\nair; also, it is difficult to construct them, so that the sun may\r\nstrike the hives both in the morning and afternoon; which in spring is\r\nvery essential. If they front the south, the middle of the day is the\r\nonly time when the sun can reach all the hives at once; this is just\r\nwhen they need it least; and in hot weather, sometimes injurious by\r\nmelting the combs. But when the hives stand far enough apart, on my\r\nplan, it is very easily arranged to have the sun strike the hive in the\r\nmorning and afternoon, and shaded from ten o'clock, till two or three,\r\nin hot weather.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding our prodigality in building a splendid bee-house, we\r\nthink of economy when we come to put our hives in, and get them _too\r\nclose_. \"Can't afford to build a house, and give them so much room, no\r\nhow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nROBBERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobbing is another source of occasional loss to the apiarian. It is\r\nfrequent in spring, and at any time in warm weather when honey is\r\nscarce. It is very annoying, and sometimes gets neighbors in\r\ncontention, when perhaps neither is to blame, farther than ignorance of\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD.\r\n\r\nA person keeping many hives must expect to be accountable for all\r\nlosses in his neighborhood, whether they are lost by mismanagement or\r\nwant of management. Many people suppose, if one person has but one\r\nstock, and another has ten, that the ten will combine for plundering\r\nthe one. There are no facts, showing any communication between\r\ndifferent families of the same apiary, that I can discover. It is true,\r\nwhen one family finds another weak and defenceless, possessing\r\ntreasure, they have no conscientious scruples about carrying off the\r\nlast particle. The hurry and bustle attending it seldom escape the\r\nnotice of the other families; and when one hive has been robbed in an\r\napiary, perhaps two-thirds of the other families, sometimes all, have\r\nparticipated in the plunder. One family, if it be large, is just as\r\nlikely, and more so, to find a weak one among the ten, and commence\r\nplundering, as the other way.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROPER REMEDIES.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding it is common to hear remarks like this, \"I had a\r\n_first-rate_ hive of bees,\" (when the fact was he had not looked\r\nparticularly at his bees for a month, to know whether it was so or not,\r\nand if he had, very likely would not know,) \"and Mr. A.'s bees began to\r\nrob them. I tried every thing to stop it; I moved them around in\r\nseveral places to prevent their finding the hive. It did no good; the\r\nfirst I knew they were all gone--bees, honey, and all! The bees all\r\njoined the robbers.\" Now the fact is, that not one _good_ stock of bees\r\nin fifty, will ever be robbed, if let alone; that is, if the entrance\r\nis properly protected. This moving the hive was enough to ruin any\r\nstock; bees were lost at every change, until nothing was left but honey\r\nto tempt the robbers; whereas, if left on its stand, it might have\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nA great many remedies have been given me gratis, which, had one-half\r\nbeen followed, would have ruined them. The fact is, with many people,\r\nthe remedies are often the cause of the disease. The most fatal is, to\r\nmove them a few rods; another, to close the hive entirely, (very liable\r\nto smother them); or, break out some comb and set the honey to running.\r\nThere are some charms that affect them but little any way. Probably\r\nthere are but few bee-keepers able to tell at once, _when bees are\r\nbeing robbed_. It requires the closest scrutinizing observation to\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTY IN DECIDING.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing about the apiary more difficult to determine, nothing\r\nmore likely than to be deceived. It is generally supposed, when a\r\nnumber are outside fighting, that it is conclusive that they are also\r\nrobbing, which is seldom the case. On the contrary, a show of\r\nresistance indicates a strong colony, and that they are disposed to\r\ndefend their treasures. I no longer have any fears for a stock that has\r\ncourage to repel an attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEAK FAMILIES IN MOST DANGER.\r\n\r\nIt is weak families, that show no resistance, where we find the most\r\ndanger. In seasons of scarcity, all _good_ stocks maintain or keep\r\nsentinels about the entrance, whose duty it appears to be to examine\r\nevery bee that attempts to enter. If it is a member of the community,\r\nit is allowed to pass; if not, it is examined on the spot. It would\r\nseem that a password was requisite for admittance, for no sooner does a\r\nstranger-bee endeavor to get in, than it is known. If without necessary\r\ncredentials, there is evidence enough against it. Each bee is a\r\nqualified jurist, judge, and executioner. There is no delay; no waiting\r\nfor witnesses for defence. The more a bee attempts to escape, the more\r\nlikely it will be to receive a sting, unless it succeeds. How strange\r\nbees are known, would be nothing but theory, if I should attempt to\r\nexplain. Let it suffice that they are known.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR BATTLES.\r\n\r\nI will here describe some of their battles. I have in the spring\r\nfrequently seen the whole front side of the hive covered with the\r\ncombatants, (but for such hives I have no fears; they are able to\r\ndefend themselves.) Several will surround one stranger; one or two will\r\nbite its legs, another the wings; another will make a feint of\r\nstinging, while another is ready to take what honey it has, when\r\nworried sufficient to make it willing. It is sometimes allowed to go\r\nafter yielding all its honey, but at others, is dispatched with a\r\nsting, which is almost instantly fatal. A bee is killed sooner by a\r\nsting, than by any other means, except crushing. Sometimes a leg will\r\ntremble, for a minute; the legs are drawn close to the body; the\r\nabdomen contracts to half its usual size, unless filled with honey. I\r\nhave known a pint accidentally to enter a neighboring stock, and be\r\nkilled in five minutes. The only places the sting will penetrate a bee\r\nare the joints of the abdomen, legs, the neck, &c. I have occasionally\r\nseen one bee drag about the dead body of its victim, being unable to\r\nwithdraw its sting from a joint in the leg. During the fight, if it be\r\nto keep off those in search of plunder, a few bees may be seen buzzing\r\naround in search of a place unguarded to enter the hive. If such is\r\nfound, it alights and enters in a moment. At other times, when about to\r\nenter, it meets a soldier on duty, and is on the wing again in an\r\ninstant. But another time it may be more unfortunate, and be nabbed by\r\na policeman, when it must either break away, or suffer the penalty of\r\ninsect justice, which is generally of the utmost severity.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAD POLICY TO RAISE THE HIVES.\r\n\r\nA great many apiarians raise their hives an inch from the board early\r\nin spring. They seem to disregard the chance it gives robbers to enter\r\non every side. It is like setting the door of your own house open, to\r\ntempt the thief, and then complain of depravity.\r\n\r\nLet it be understood, then, that all good stocks, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, will take care of themselves. Nature has provided means\r\nof defence, with instinct to direct its use. Non-resistance may do for\r\nhighly cultivated intellect in man, but not here.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDICATIONS OF ROBBERS.\r\n\r\nWe will now notice the appearance about a weak hive that makes no\r\nresistance, and show the result to be a total loss of the stock,\r\nwithout timely interference. Each robber, when leaving the hive,\r\ninstead of flying in a direct line to its home, will turn its head\r\ntowards the hive to mark the spot, that it may know where to return for\r\nanother load, in the same manner that they do when leaving their hive\r\nin the spring. The first time the young bees leave home, they mark\r\ntheir location, by the same process. A few of these begin to hatch from\r\nthe cells very early; in all good stocks, often before the weather is\r\nwarm enough for _any to leave the hive_. Consequently, it cannot be too\r\nearly for them at any time in spring. These young bees, about the\r\nmiddle of each fair day, or a little later, take a turn of flying out\r\nvery thickly for a short time. The inexperienced observer would be very\r\nlikely to suppose such stock very prosperous, from the number of\r\ninhabitants in motion. This unusual bustle is the first indication of\r\nfoul play, and should be regarded with suspicion; yet it is not\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DUTY.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of every bee-keeper, who expects to succeed, to know\r\nwhich his weak stocks are; an examination some cool morning, can be\r\nmade by turning the hive bottom up, and letting the sun among the\r\ncombs. The number of inhabitants in them is easily seen. When weak,\r\nclose the entrance, till there is just room for one bee to pass at\r\nonce. The first real pleasant days, at any time before honey is\r\nobtained plentifully, a little after noon, look out for them to\r\ncommence robbing. Whenever a weak stock is taken with what appears to\r\nbe a fit of unusual industry, it is quite certain they are either\r\nrobbers or young bees; the difficulty is to decide which. Their motions\r\nare alike, but there is a little difference in color--the young bees\r\nare a shade lighter; the abdomen of the robbers, when filled with\r\nhoney, is a little larger. It requires close, patient observation, to\r\ndecide this point, and when you have watched close enough to detect\r\nthis difference, you can decide without trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TEST.\r\n\r\nBut while you are learning this nice distinction, your bees may be\r\nruined. We will, therefore, give some other means of protection.\r\n\r\nBees, when they have been stealing a sack of honey from a neighboring\r\nhive, will generally run several inches from the entrance before\r\nflying: kill some of these; if filled with honey, they are robbers;\r\nbecause it is very suspicious, to be filled with honey when leaving the\r\nhive; or sprinkle some flour on them as they come out, and have some\r\none watch by the others to see if they enter. Another way is less\r\ntrouble, but will take longer, before they are checked, if robbing.\r\nVisit them again in the course of half an hour or more, after the young\r\nbees have had time to get back, (if it should happen to be them); but\r\nif the bustle continues or increases, it is time to interfere. When the\r\nentrance has been contracted as directed, close it entirely till near\r\nsunset. When it has been left without, it should now be done, (giving\r\nroom for only one bee at a time). This will allow all that belong to\r\nthe hive to get in, and others to get out, and materially retard the\r\nprogress of the robbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBBING USUALLY COMMENCES ON A WARM DAY.\r\n\r\nUnless it should be cool, they will continue their operations till\r\nevening. Very often some are unable to get home in the dark, and are\r\nlost. This, by the way, is another good test of robbing. Visit the\r\nhives every warm evening. They _commence_ depredations on the warmest\r\ndays; seldom otherwise. If any are at work when honest laborers should\r\nbe at home, they need attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDIES.\r\n\r\nAs for remedies, I have tried several. The least trouble is to remove\r\nthe weak hive in the morning to the cellar, or some dark, cool place,\r\nfor a few days, until at least two or three warm days have passed, that\r\nthey may abandon the search. The robbers will then probably attack the\r\nstock on the next stand. Contract the entrance of this in accordance\r\nwith the number of bees that are to pass. If strong, no danger need be\r\napprehended; they may fight, and even kill some; perhaps a little\r\nchastisement is necessary, to a sense of their duty.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON OPINION.\r\n\r\nThere is an opinion prevalent that robbers often go to a neighboring\r\nstock, kill off the bees first, and then take possession of the\r\ntreasures. To corroborate this matter, I have never yet discovered one\r\nfact, although I have watched very closely. Whenever bees have had all\r\ntheir stores taken, at a period when nothing was to be had in the\r\nflowers, it is evident they must starve, and last but a day or two\r\nbefore they are gone. This would naturally give rise to the supposition\r\nthat they were either killed, or gone with the robbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CASE IN POINT.\r\n\r\nI have a case in point. Having been from home a couple of days, I\r\nfound, on my return, a swarm of medium strength, that had been\r\ncarelessly exposed, had been plundered of about fifteen pounds of\r\nhoney, every particle they had.[13] About the usual number of bees were\r\namong the combs, to all appearance, very disconsolate. I at once\r\nremoved them to the cellar, and fed them for a few days. The other bees\r\ngave over looking for more plunder, in the meantime. It was then\r\nreturned to the stand, entrance nearly closed, as directed, &c. In a\r\nshort time it made a valuable stock; but had I left it twenty-four\r\nhours longer, it probably would not have been worth a straw.\r\n\r\n      [13] It occurred the last of July.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER DIRECTIONS.\r\n\r\nWhen a stock has been removed, if the next stand contains a weak,\r\ninstead of a strong one, it is best to take that in also; to be\r\nreturned to the stand as soon as the robbers will allow it. If a second\r\nattack is made, put them in again, or if practicable, remove them a\r\nmile or two out of their knowledge of country; they would then lose no\r\ntime from labor. Where but few stocks are kept, and not more than one\r\nor two stocks are engaged, sprinkle a little flour on them as they\r\nleave, to ascertain which the robbers are; then reverse the hives,\r\nputting the weak one in the place of the strong, and the strong one in\r\nthe place of the weak one. The weak stock will generally become the\r\nstrongest, and put a stop to their operations; but this method is often\r\nimpracticable in a large apiary; because several stocks are usually\r\nengaged, very soon after one commences, and a dozen may be robbing one.\r\nAnother method is, when you are _sure_ a stock is being robbed, take a\r\ntime when there are as many plunderers inside as you can get, and close\r\nthe hive at once, (wire-cloth, or something to admit air, and at the\r\nsame time confine the bees, is necessary;) carry in, as before\r\ndirected, for two or three days, when they may be set out. The strange\r\nbees thus enclosed will join the weak family, and will be as eager to\r\ndefend what is now _their_ treasure, as they were before to carry it\r\noff. This principle of forgetting home and uniting with others, after a\r\nlapse of a few days, (writers say, twenty-four hours is sufficient for\r\nthem to forget home) can be recommended in this case. It succeeds about\r\nfour times in five, when a proper number is enclosed. Weak stocks are\r\nstrengthened in this way very easily; and the bees being taken from a\r\nnumber of hives, are hardly missed. The difficulty is, to know when\r\nthere are enough to be about equal, to what belongs to the weak stock;\r\nif too few are enclosed, they are surely destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON CAUSE OF COMMENCING.\r\n\r\nAfter all, bees being robbed is like being destroyed by worms; a kind\r\nof secondary matter; that is, not one strong stock in a hundred will\r\never be attacked and plundered on the first onset. Bees must be first\r\ntempted, and rendered furious by a weak hive; a dish of refuse honey\r\nset near them is sometimes sufficient to set them at work, also where\r\nthey have been fed and not had a full supply. After they have once\r\ncommenced, it takes an astonishing quantity to satiate their appetite.\r\nThey seem to be perfectly intoxicated, and regardless of danger; they\r\nventure on to certain destruction! I have known a few instances where\r\ngood stocks by this means were reduced, until they in turn fell a prey\r\nto others. I have for several years kept about one hundred stocks away\r\nfrom home, where I could not see them much, to prevent robbing. Yet I\r\nnever lost a stock by this cause. I simply keep the entrance closed,\r\nexcept a passage for the bees at work during spring. It is true I have\r\nlost a few stocks, when the other bees took the honey, but they would\r\nhave been lost any way.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRING THE WORST TIME.\r\n\r\nAs I before remarked in the commencement of this chapter, bees will\r\nplunder and fight at any time through the summer, when honey cannot be\r\ncollected; but _spring_ is the only time that such desperate and\r\npersevering efforts are made to obtain it. It is the only time the\r\napiarian can be excused for having his hives plundered, or letting them\r\nstand in a situation for it. We then often have families reduced in\r\nwinter and spring, from various causes, and when protected through this\r\nseason, generally make good stocks. It is then we wish them to form\r\nsteady, industrious habits, and not live by plunder. Prevention is\r\nbetter than cure; evil propensities should be checked in the beginning.\r\nThe bee, like man, when this disposition has been indulged for a time,\r\nit is hard breaking the habit; a severe chastisement is the only cure;\r\nthey too go on the principle of much wanting more.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO NECESSITY TO HAVE THE BEES PLUNDERED IN THE FALL.\r\n\r\nThe apiarian having his bees plundered in the fall, is not fit to have\r\ncharge of them; their efforts are seldom as strong as in spring,\r\n(unless there is a general scarcity,) the weak hives are usually better\r\nsupplied with bees, and consequently a less number is exposed; but yet,\r\nwhen there are some very weak families, these should be taken away as\r\nsoon as the flowers fail, or strengthened with bees from another hive.\r\nParticulars in fall management.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes made my swarms equal, early in spring, by the\r\nfollowing method, and I have also failed. Bees, when wintered together\r\nin a room, will seldom quarrel when first set out. When one stock has\r\nan over supply of bees, and another a very few, the next day or two\r\nafter being out, I change the weak one to the stand of the strong one,\r\n(as mentioned a page or two back,) and all bees that have marked the\r\nlocation return to that place. The failure is, when too many leave the\r\nstrong stock, making that the weak one, when nothing is gained. If it\r\ncould be done when they had been out of the house just long enough for\r\nthe proper number to have marked the location, success would be quite\r\ncertain. But before an exchange of this kind is made, it would be well,\r\nif possible; to ascertain what is the cause of a stock being weak; if\r\nit is from the loss of a queen, (which is sometimes the case,) we only\r\nmake the matter worse by the operation. To ascertain whether the queen\r\nbe present, do not depend on the bees carrying in pollen; as most\r\nwriters assert they will not, when the queen is gone; because I have\r\n_known_ them do it so many times without, that I can assure the reader\r\nagain, it is no test whatever. The test given in chapter III. page 73,\r\nis always certain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nFEEDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOULD BE A LAST RESORT.\r\n\r\nFeeding bees in spring is sometimes absolutely necessary; but in\r\nordinary seasons and circumstances, it is somewhat doubtful if it is\r\nthe surest road to success, for the apiarian to attempt wintering any\r\nstock so poorly supplied with honey, that he feels satisfied will need\r\nfeeding in the spring or before. I will recommend in another place (in\r\nfall management) what I consider a better disposition of such light\r\nfamilies. But as some stocks are either robbed, or from some other\r\ncause, consume more honey than we expect, a little trouble and care may\r\nsave a loss. Also bees are often fed at this season to promote early\r\nswarming, and filling boxes with surplus honey.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE NEEDED.\r\n\r\nConsiderable care is requisite, and but few know how to manage it\r\nproperly. Honey fed to bees, is almost certain to get up quarrels among\r\nthem. Sometimes strong stocks scent the honey given to weak ones, and\r\ncarry it off as fast as supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARENT CONTRADICTION WHEN FEEDING CAUSING STARVATION.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that feeding a stock of bees in spring, may cause them\r\nto starve! whereas, if let alone, they might escape. Notwithstanding\r\nthis looks like a contradiction, I think it appears reasonable.\r\nWhenever the supply of honey is short, probably not more than one egg\r\nin twenty which the queen deposits, will be matured--their means not\r\nallowing the young brood to be fed. This appears from the fact that\r\nseveral eggs may be found in one cell. I transferred over twenty stocks\r\nin March, 1852--most of the cells occupied with eggs contained a\r\nplurality; two, three, and even four, were found in one cell; it is\r\nevident that all could not be perfected. Also, the fact of these eggs\r\nbeing at this season on the bottom-board. Now suppose you give such a\r\nstock two or three pounds of honey, and they are encouraged to feed a\r\nlarge brood, and your supply fails before they are half grown. What are\r\nthey to do? destroy the brood and lose all they have fed, or draw on\r\ntheir old stores for a small quantity to help them in this emergency,\r\nand trust to chance for themselves? The latter alternative will\r\nprobably be adopted, and then, without a timely intervention of\r\nfavorable weather, the bees starve. The same effect is sometimes\r\nproduced by the changes of the weather; a week or two may be very fine\r\nand bring out the flowers in abundance--a sudden change, perhaps frost,\r\nmay destroy all for a few days. This makes it necessary to use\r\nconsiderable vigilance, as these turns of cold weather (when they\r\noccur) make it unsafe, till white clover appears; but if the spring is\r\nfavorable, there is but little danger, unless they are robbed. If you\r\ntake the necessary care about worms, you will know which are light, and\r\nwhich heavy, unless your hives are suspended; even then, it is a duty\r\nto know their true condition, in this respect. This is another\r\nadvantage of the _simple_ hive; merely raising one edge to destroy\r\nworms, tells you something about the honey on hand. To be very exact,\r\nthe hive should be weighed when ready for the bees, and the weight\r\nmarked on it; by weighing at any time after, tells at once within a few\r\npounds of what honey there is on hand. Some allowance must be made for\r\nthe age of the combs, the quantity of brood, &c. It is wrong to begin\r\nto feed without being prepared to continue to do so, as the supply must\r\nbe kept up till honey is abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW LONG IT WILL DO TO WAIT BEFORE FEEDING.\r\n\r\nIf it is wished to wait as long as possible, and not lose the bees, a\r\ntest will be necessary to decide how long it will do to delay feeding.\r\nIn this case, _strict attention will be necessary; they will need\r\nexamination every morning_. If a light tap on the hive is answered b; a\r\nbrisk, lively buzzing, they are not suffering yet; but if no answer is\r\nreturned to your inquiry, it indicates a want of strength. Extreme\r\ndestitution destroys all disposition to repel an attack. Sometimes a\r\npart of the bees will be too weak to remain among the combs, and will\r\nbe lying on the bottom, and some few outside. If the weather is cool,\r\nthey appear to be lifeless; yet they can be revived, and now _must he\r\nfed_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR FEEDING.\r\n\r\nThose among the combs may be able to move, though feebly. When this is\r\nthe condition of things, invert the hive, gather up all the scattered\r\nbees, and put them in. Get some honey; if candied, heat it till it\r\ndissolves; comb honey is not so good without mashing; if no honey is to\r\nbe had, brown sugar may be taken instead; add a little water, and boil\r\nit till about the consistence of honey, and skim it; when cool enough,\r\npour a quantity among the combs, directly on the bees; cover the bottom\r\nof the hive with a cloth, securing it firmly, and bring to the fire to\r\nwarm up. In two or three hours they will be revived, and may be\r\nreturned to the stand, providing the honey given is all taken up; on no\r\naccount let any honey run out around the bottom. The necessity of a\r\ndaily visit to the hives is apparent from the fact, that if left over\r\nfor one day, in the situation just described, it will be too late to\r\nrevive them. At night, if you have a box cover, such as I have\r\nrecommended, you may open the holes in the top of the hive; fill a\r\nsmall baking dish with honey or syrup, and set it on the top; put in\r\nsome shavings to keep the bees from drowning, or a float may be used if\r\nyou choose; it should be made of some very light wood, very thin, and\r\nfull of holes or narrow channels, made with a saw. At the commencement\r\nof feeding, a few drops should be scattered on the top of the hive and\r\ntrailed to the side of the dish, to teach them the way; after feeding a\r\nfew times, they will know the road. When the weather is warm enough for\r\nthem to take it during the night, it is best to feed at evening,--from\r\nfour to eight ounces daily, is sufficient. If the family is very small,\r\nwhat honey is left in the morning may attract other bees; it is then\r\nbest to take it out, or carry the hive in the house to a dark room,\r\nsufficiently warm, and feed them enough to last several days, and then\r\nreturn them to the stand; keeping a good lookout that they are not\r\nplundered, and again in a starving condition, until flowers produce\r\nhoney sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHOLE FAMILIES MAY DESERT THE HIVE.\r\n\r\nWhen you have the means to keep up a supply of food, and time requisite\r\nto make feeding secure, perhaps it would not be advisable to wait till\r\nthe last extremity before feeding, as a small family will sometimes\r\nentirely desert the hive, when destitute, if it occurs before they have\r\nmuch brood. In these cases, they issue precisely as a swarm; after\r\nflying a long time, they either return, or unite with some other stock.\r\nIf they return, they need attention immediately. You may be certain\r\nthere is something wrong, let the desertion take place when it may; in\r\nspring it may be destitution, or mouldy combs; at other times the\r\npresence of worms, diseased brood, &c. By whatever cause it is\r\nproduced, ascertain it, and apply the remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIONS TO GENERAL FEEDING.\r\n\r\nI have known it recommended, and practised by some apiarians, to feed\r\nbees all at once in the open air, in a large trough; but whoever\r\nrealizes much profit by this method, will be very fortunate, as every\r\nstock in the neighborhood will soon scent it out, and carry off a good\r\nshare, and nearly every stock at home will be in contention, and great\r\nnumbers killed; the moment the honey is out, their attention is\r\ndirected to other stocks. Another objection to this general feeding is,\r\nthat some stocks are not necessitated at all, while others need it; but\r\nthe strongest stock is pretty sure to get the most. NOW, as I cannot\r\nafford to divide with my neighbors in this way of feeding, and I\r\nsuppose but few will be found who are willing to do it, I will give my\r\nmethod, which, when once arranged, is but little trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT FOR FEEDING.\r\n\r\nI got a tinman to make some dishes, two inches deep, 10×12 inches\r\nsquare, and perpendicular sides. A board was then got out, fifteen\r\ninches wide, and two feet long; two inches from one end, a hole is cut\r\nout the longest way, just the size of the dish, so that it will set in\r\njust even with the upper side of the board; a good fit should be made,\r\nso that no bees can get in around it; cleats should be nailed on the\r\nunder side of the board, some over an inch thick, to prevent crowding\r\nthe dish out. This is to go directly under the hive, but it is not\r\nready yet, because if such dish is filled with honey under a hive, the\r\nbees would drown; if a float is put on to keep them out, it will settle\r\nto the bottom when the honey is out, and the bees cannot creep up the\r\nsides of tin very easily. Another thing, there is nothing to prevent\r\nthe bees from making their combs to the bottom of this dish, two inches\r\nbelow the bottom of the hive; these things are to be prevented. Get out\r\ntwo pieces of half-inch board, ten inches long, one to be two inches\r\nwide, the other one and a half inches. With a coarse or thick saw, cut\r\nchannels in the side of the strips, one-fourth inch deep, three-eighths\r\nor half an inch apart, crosswise the whole length. You will then want a\r\nnumber corresponding to the places sawed, of very thin shingles, or\r\nstrips, say one-eighth of an inch thick, and one and three-fourths\r\nwide, and nine and a half long; these are to stand edgewise in the\r\ndish; the first two are to hold them in the channels at the ends. The\r\nnarrow one needs a block one-half inch square, nailed on each end; on\r\nthe edge, a strip of wire cloth is then nailed on, making the whole\r\nwidth just two inches. This is now put in the dish, wire cloth at the\r\nbottom, two inches from one end; two pins to act as braces will keep it\r\nthere; the other wide one is placed against the other end, and pressed\r\ndown even with the top of the dish. The thin pieces are now slipped\r\ninto the channels even with the top; it is now ready to go under the\r\nhive to be fed. Let the two-inch space project out on the back side of\r\nthe hive. A narrow board should be provided, some more than two inches\r\nwide, to cover it. Let the hive stand close on this board; the hole in\r\nthe side is sufficient for the passage of bees at work, till very hot\r\nweather. Thus you see that the hive covers all but the space behind,\r\nwhich the board covers, and not a strange bee can get at the honey,\r\nwithout entering the hole at the side, and passing through among the\r\nbees belonging to the hive, which they will not often do; if the family\r\nis numerous, it makes it as safe as feeding on the top; with this\r\nadvantage, there are no bees in the way to interfere while pouring in\r\nthe food. When the bees are to be fed, raise the board at the back and\r\npour in the honey; the wire-cloth in the bottom prevents all bees from\r\nentering this space, at the same time will let the honey pass through\r\ndirectly under the bees, which will take it up quicker than from any\r\nother place that I can put it; they will work all night even when the\r\nweather is quite cool. This board and feeder can be taken out when done\r\nfeeding, and put away till wanted again; if left under through the\r\nsummer, it affords the worms a place rather too convenient to spin\r\ntheir cocoons, where they are not easily destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING TO INDUCE EARLY SWARMS.\r\n\r\nIf the object in feeding is to induce early swarms, of course the best\r\nstocks should be chosen for the purpose; but some care is necessary not\r\nto give too much, and fill the combs with honey, that ought to be\r\nfilled with brood, and thereby defeat your object; one pound per day is\r\nenough, perhaps too much. The quantity obtained from flowers is a\r\npartial guide; when plenty, feed less; when scarce, more. Begin as soon\r\nas you can make them take it up in spring, and continue in accordance\r\nwith the weather, till white clover blossoms, or swarms issue. Another\r\nobject in feeding bees at this period, is to have the store combs all\r\nfilled with inferior honey, so that when clover appears, (which yields\r\nour best honey,) there is no room except in the boxes to store it,\r\nwhich are now put on, and rapidly filled. When this last object is\r\nalone wished for, it is not much matter how much is given at a time,\r\nproviding it is all taken up through the night; it will then take no\r\ntime in day-light, when they might work on flowers; also, the bees\r\nwould have no trouble in repelling any attempt of others to get at it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT MAY BE FED.\r\n\r\nInferior honey may be used for this purpose; Southern or West India is\r\ngood, and costs but little. Even molasses sugar mixed with it will do;\r\nbut they do not relish it so well when fed without the honey. I have\r\nusually taken about equal quantities of each, adding a pint of water to\r\nten pounds of this mixture, and making it as hot as it will bear\r\nwithout boiling over, and skimming it.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS CANDIED HONEY INJURIOUS?\r\n\r\nThere has an idea been advanced, that candied honey is injurious to\r\nbees, even said to be fatal. I never could discover any thing further,\r\nthan it was a perfect waste, while in this state. When boiled, and a\r\nlittle water added, it appears to be just as good as any. Nearly every\r\nstock will have more or less of it on hand at this season; but as warm\r\nweather approaches, and the bees increase to warm the hive, it seems to\r\nget liquified, from this cause alone. The bees, when compelled to use\r\nhoney from these cells, thus candied, waste a large portion; a part is\r\nliquid, and the rest is grained like sugar, which may be seen on the\r\nbottom-board, as the bees work it out very often. Another object in\r\nfeeding bees, is to give inferior honey, mixed with sugar and flavored\r\nto suit the taste, to the bees, and let them store it in boxes for\r\nmarket. Now, I have no faith in honey undergoing any chemical change in\r\nthe stomach of the bee,[14] and cannot recommend this as the honest\r\ncourse. Neither do I think it would be very profitable, feeding to this\r\nextent, under any circumstances. I have a few times had some boxes\r\nnearly finished and fit for market at the end of the honey season; a\r\nlittle more added would make them answer. I have then fed a few pounds\r\nof good honey, but always found that several pounds had to be given the\r\nbees to get one in the boxes.\r\n\r\n      [14] Mr. Gillman's patent for feeding bees, is based on the\r\n      principle of a chemical change. It is said that the food he gives\r\n      to the bees, when poured into the cells, becomes honey of the\r\n      first quality. This appears extremely mysterious; for it is well\r\n      understood that when a bee has filled its sack it will go to the\r\n      hive, deposit its load, and return immediately for more; and will\r\n      continue its labor throughout the day, or until the supply fails;\r\n      each load occupying but few minutes. The time in going from the\r\n      feeder to the hive is so short that a change so important is not\r\n      at all probable. The nature of bees seems to be to _collect_\r\n      honey, not _make_ it; hence we find, when bees are gathering from\r\n      clover, they store quite a different article than when from\r\n      buckwheat,--or when we feed West India honey, in quantities\r\n      sufficient to have it stored _pure_ in the boxes, we find that it\r\n      has lost none of its bad taste in passing through the sacks of\r\n      our northern bees.\r\n\r\n      It appears most probable that, if Southern honey and cheap sugar\r\n      form the basis of his food, (which it is said to,) that it is\r\n      flavored with something to disguise the disagreeable qualities of\r\n      the compound. Should this be the secret, it would seem like a\r\n      waste to feed it to bees--a portion would be given to the brood,\r\n      and possibly the old bees might not always refrain from sipping a\r\n      little of the tempting nectar. Why not, when the compound was\r\n      ready,--instead of wasting it by this process,--put it directly\r\n      in market? Or, is it necessary to have it in the combs to help\r\n      psychologize the consumer into the belief that it is honey of a\r\n      pure quality?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF WORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall not give a full history of the moth in this chapter, as spring\r\nis not the time they are most destructive. It will be further noticed\r\nunder the head of Enemies of Bees. But as this is a duty belonging to\r\nspring, a partial history seems necessary.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the bees commence their labors, the worms are generally\r\nready to begin theirs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME IN THE BEST STOCKS.\r\n\r\nYou will probably find some in your best stocks; but don't be\r\nfrightened; this is not the season when they often destroy your stocks,\r\nyet they injure them some.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW FOUND.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when cool, raise the hive, and you will find them on\r\nthe board. You must not suppose that these chaps are bred outside the\r\nhive, got their growth, and are now on their way among the bees, but\r\nthe reverse. They are _bred in the hive_, and most of them are on the\r\nway out, and this is the precise time to arrest them and bring them to\r\njustice for their crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TOOL FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nI have used a simple tool, made in a few minutes, and very convenient\r\nin this business. Any one can make it. Get a piece of narrow hoop-iron,\r\n(steel would be better,) three-fourth inch wide, five inches long;\r\ntaper from one side three inches from the end to a point; then grind\r\neach edge sharp; make three or four holes through the wide end, to\r\nadmit small nails through it in the handle, which should be about two\r\nfeet long and about half an inch square. Armed with this weapon, you\r\ncan proceed. Raise the hive on one edge, and with the point of your\r\nsword you may pick a worm out of the closest corner, and easily scrape\r\nall from under the hive with it. Now, _be sure and dispatch every one_;\r\nnot that the \"little victim\" will itself, personally, do much mischief;\r\nbut through its descendants the mischief is to be apprehended. Very\r\nlikely half of all you find will have finished their course of\r\ndestruction, among the combs, and have voluntarily left them for a\r\nplace to spin their cocoons. They are worried by the bees, if they are\r\nnumerous, until satisfied that it is no safe place among them to make a\r\nshroud and remain helpless two or three weeks. Accordingly, when they\r\nget their growth they leave, get on the board on the bottom, become\r\nchilled and helpless in the morning, but again active by the middle of\r\nthe day. Now, if they are merely thrown on the earth, a place there\r\nwill be selected, if no better is found, for transformation; and a moth\r\nperfected ten feet from the hive is just as capable of depositing five\r\nhundred eggs in your hive, as if she had never left it.\r\n\r\nSeveral generations are matured in the course of one summer:\r\nconsequently, one destroyed at this season, may prevent the existence\r\nof thousands before the summer is over.\r\n\r\nThis is another subject of theoretical reasoning, and imposition, (at\r\nleast in my opinion.) I wish the reader to judge for himself; get rid\r\nof whims and prejudice, and look at the subject candidly and fair; and\r\nif there is no corroborative testimony comes up to confirm any position\r\nthat I assume, I shall not complain if my assertions fare no better\r\nthan some others. Only defer judgment till you _know_ for yourself.\r\n\r\nBees have ever received my especial regard and attention; and my\r\nenthusiasm may blind my judgment. I may be prejudiced, but will not be\r\nwilfully wrong. I have found so many theories utterly false, when\r\ncarried out in practice, that I can depend on no one's hypothesis,\r\nhowever plausible, without facts in practice to support it. No one\r\nshould be fully credited without a test. To return to our subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTAKEN CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed by many, when these worms are found on the board, they\r\nget there by accident, having dropped from the combs above. They seem\r\nnot to understand that the worm generally travels on safe principles;\r\nthat is, he attaches a thread to whatever he travels over. To be\r\nsatisfied on this point, I have many times carefully detached his\r\nfoot-hold, when on the side of the hive or other place, where he would\r\nfall a few inches, and always found him with a thread fast at the place\r\nhe left, to enable him to regain his position if he chose. Is it not\r\nprobable, then, that whenever he leaves the combs for the bottom-board,\r\nhe can readily ascend again? No doubt he often does, to be driven down\r\nagain by the bees. Now, what I wish to get at by all this preamble, is\r\nsimply this: that all our trouble and worrying to prevent the worms\r\nfrom again ascending to the combs--by wire hooks, wire pins, screws,\r\nnails, turned pins, clam-shells, blocks of wood, &c., is perfect\r\nnonsense, when half or more of them would not harm the bees any more if\r\nthey did, and might as well go there as any where else. Besides, these\r\nuseless \"fixins\" are very often a positive injury to the bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIONS TO SUSPENDED BOTTOM-BOARD.\r\n\r\nSuppose, if you please, that the worm has no thread attached above, and\r\nyour board is far enough from the bottom of the hive to prevent his\r\nreaching it. Of course, he can't get up; but how are your bees to do\r\nany better? The worm can reach as high as they can. The bee can fly up,\r\nyou think; so it will, sometimes; but will try a dozen times first to\r\nget up without, and when it does, it is a very bad position to start\r\nfrom, being a smooth board. In hot weather it does better. Did you ever\r\nwatch by a hive thus raised, in April or May, towards night, when it\r\nwas a little cool, and see the industrious little insects arrive with a\r\nload as heavy as they could possibly carry, all chilly, and nearly out\r\nof breath, scarcely able to reach home, and there witness their vain\r\nattempts to get among their fellows above them? If you never witnessed\r\nthis, I wish you would take some pains for it, and when you find them\r\ngiving up in despair, when too chilly to fly, and perishing after many\r\nfruitless attempts for life, I think, if you possess sympathy,\r\nbenevolence, or even selfishness, you will be induced to do as I\r\ndid--discard at once wire hooks and all else from under the hive in the\r\nspring, and give the bees, when they do get home with a load, under\r\nsuch circumstances, what they richly deserve, and that is,\r\n_protection_.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGE OF THE HIVE CLOSE TO THE BOARD.\r\n\r\nAn inch hole in the side of the hive, a few inches from the bottom, as\r\na passage for the bees, is needed, as I shall recommend letting the\r\nhive close to the board; it is essential on account of robbing; also,\r\nit is necessary to confine as much as possible the animal heat, in most\r\nhives, during the season the bees are engaged in rearing young brood;\r\nand warmth is necessary to hatch the eggs, and develop the larvæ; we\r\nall know that when the hive is close, less heat will pass off than if\r\nraised an inch.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTION ANSWERED.\r\n\r\nYou object to this, and tell me, \"the worms will get between the bottom\r\nof the hive and the board.\" Well, I think they will, and what then? Why\r\nI expect if you intend to succeed, that you will get them out, and\r\ncrush their heads; if you cannot give as much attention as this, better\r\nnot keep them, or let some one have the care of them that will. I am as\r\nwilling to find a worm under the edge of the hive, and dispatch it, as\r\nto have it creep into some place out of sight, and change to the moth.\r\nI once trimmed off the bottom of my hives to a thin edge, so they did\r\nnot have this place for their cocoons, but now prefer to have them\r\nsquare. _All profit_ is seldom obtained with anything. If you plant a\r\nfield with corn, you do not expect that the whole work for the crop is\r\nfinished. Neither should you expect when you set up a stock of bees,\r\nthat a full yield will be realized without something more. If you are\r\nremunerated by keeping the weeds from your corn, be assured it is\r\nequally profitable to weed out your bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSUFFICIENCY OF INCLINED BOTTOM-BOARD.\r\n\r\nNow do not be deceived in this matter, and through indolence be induced\r\nto get those hives with descending bottom-boards, to throw out the\r\nworms as they fall, and hope by that means to get rid of the trouble;\r\n(I have already, in another chapter, expressed doubts of this). But we\r\nwill _now_ suppose such descending bottom-boards capable of throwing\r\nevery worm that touches it \"heels over head\" to the ground; what have\r\nwe gained? His neck is not broken, nor any other _bone_ of his body! As\r\nif nothing extraordinary had happened, he quietly gathers himself up,\r\nand looks about for snug quarters; he cares not a fig for the hive now;\r\nhe gormandized on the combs until satisfied, before he left them, and\r\nis glad to get away from the bees any how. A place large enough for a\r\ncocoon is easily found, and when he again becomes desirous of visiting\r\nthe hives, it is not to satisfy his own wants, but to accommodate his\r\nprogeny; he is then furnished with wings ample to carry him to any\r\nheight that you choose to put your bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MOTH CAN GO WHERE BEES CAN.\r\n\r\nA hive that is proof against the moth, is yet to be constructed. We\r\nfrequently hear of them, but when they come to be tested, somehow these\r\nworms get where the bees are. When your hives become so full of bees,\r\nthat they cover the board in a cool morning, the worms will be seldom\r\nfound there, except under the edge of the hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAP TO CATCH WORMS.\r\n\r\nYou may now raise it, but you may still catch the worms by laying under\r\nthe bees a narrow shingle, a stick of elder split in two lengthwise,\r\nand the pith scraped out, or anything else that will afford them\r\nprotection from the bees, and where they may spin their cocoons. These\r\nshould be removed every few days, and the worms destroyed, and the trap\r\nput back. Do not neglect it till they change to the moth, and you have\r\nnothing but to remove the empty cocoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOX FOR WREN.\r\n\r\nIf you would take the trouble to put up a cage or two for the wren to\r\nnest in, he would be a valuable assistant in this department of your\r\nlabor. He would be on the lookout when you were away, and many worms,\r\nwhile looking up a hiding-place in some corner, would be relieved from\r\nall further trouble by being deposited in his crop. The cage for him\r\nneed not be more than four inches square; it may be fastened near as\r\npossible to the bees; to a post, tree, or side of some building a few\r\nfeet high. I have seen the skull of some animal (horse or ox) used, and\r\nis very convenient for them, the cavity for the brains being used for\r\nthe nest. A person once told me the wren would not build in one that he\r\nhad put up. On examination, the stake to support it was found driven\r\ninto the only entrance. I mention this to show how little some people\r\nunderstand what they do. It is sometimes well enough to know why a\r\nthing is to be done, as to know it _must_ be done. I could tell you to\r\ndo a great many things, but then you would like to know _why_, then\r\n_how_ to do it. Now if this prolixity is unnecessary for you, another\r\nmay need it. You must remember I am endeavoring to teach some few to\r\nkeep bees, who are not over supplied with ingenuity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nPUTTING ON AND TAKING OFF BOXES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPutting on boxes may be considered a duty intermediate between spring\r\nand summer management. I cannot recommend putting them on as early as\r\nthe last of April, or first of May, in ordinary circumstances. It is\r\npossible to find a case that it would be best. But before the hive is\r\nfull of bees it is generally useless, very likely a disadvantage, by\r\nallowing a portion of animal heat to escape that is needed in the hive\r\nto mature the brood. Also, moisture may accumulate until the inside\r\nmoulds, &c. Some experience and judgment is necessary to know about\r\nwhat time boxes are needed. That boxes _are needed_ at the proper\r\nseason, I think I shall not need an argument to convince any one, in\r\nthe present day. Bee-keepers have generally discarded the barbarous\r\npractice of killing the bees to obtain the honey. Many of them have\r\nlearned that a good swarm will store sufficient honey for winter,\r\nbesides several dollars worth as profit in boxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGE OF THE PATENT VENDER.\r\n\r\nHere is where the patent vender has taken the advantage of our ignorance,\r\nby pretending that no other hive but _his ever obtained such quantities,\r\nor so pure in quality_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME OF PUTTING ON--RULE.\r\n\r\nIt is probable a great many readers will need the necessary observation\r\nto tell precisely when the hive is full of honey; it may be full of\r\nbees, and not of honey. And yet the only rule that I can give to be\r\ngenerally applied, is, when the bees begin to be crowded out, but a day\r\nor two before would be just the right time, that is, when they are\r\nobtaining honey--(for it should be remembered that they do not always\r\nget honey when beginning to cluster out). This guide will do in place\r\nof a better one, which close observation and experience only can give.\r\nBy observing a glass hive attentively, in those cells that touch the\r\nglass on the edge of the combs, whenever honey is being deposited here\r\nabundantly, it is quite evident that the flowers are yielding it just\r\nthen, and other stocks are obtaining it also. Now is the time, if any\r\ncluster out, to put on the boxes. When boxes are made as I have\r\nrecommended, that is, the size containing 360 solid inches, it is\r\nadvisable to put on only one at first; when this is full either of bees\r\nor honey, and yet bees are crowded outside, the other can be added.\r\nThis is before swarming; too much room might retard the swarming a few\r\ndays, but if crowded outside, it indicates want of room, and the boxes\r\ncan make but little difference. It is better to have one box well\r\nfilled than two half full, which might be the case if the bees were not\r\nnumerous. The object of putting on boxes before swarming, is to employ\r\na portion of the bees, that otherwise would remain idly clustering\r\noutside two or three weeks, as they often do, while preparing the young\r\nqueens for swarming. But when all the bees can be profitably engaged in\r\nthe body of the hive, more room is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING HOLES AFTER THE HIVE IS FULL.\r\n\r\nWhenever it is required to put boxes on a hive that has no holes\r\nthrough the top, it need not prevent your getting a few pounds of the\r\npurest honey that may be had, just as well as to have a portion of the\r\nbees idle. I always endeavor to ascertain in what direction the sheets\r\nof comb are made, and then mark off the row of holes on the top, at\r\nright angles with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGE OF PROPER ARRANGEMENT.\r\n\r\nTwo inches being nearly the right distance, each one will be so made\r\nthat a bee arriving at the top of the hive between any two sheets will\r\nbe able to find a passage into the box, without the task of a long\r\nsearch for it; which I can imagine to be the case when only one hole\r\nfor a passage is made, or when the row of holes is parallel with the\r\ncombs. A hive might contain eight or ten sheets of comb, and a bee\r\ndesirous of entering the box might go up between any two, many times,\r\nbefore it found the passage. It has been urged that every bee soon\r\nlearns all passages and places about the hive, and consequently will\r\nknow the direct road to the box. This may be true, but when we\r\nrecollect that all within the hive is perfect darkness--that this path\r\nmust be found by the sense of feeling alone--that this sense must be\r\nits guide in all its future travels--that perhaps a thousand or two\r\nyoung workers are added every week, and these have to learn by the same\r\nmeans--it would seem, if we studied our own interest, we would give\r\nthem all the facility possible for entering the boxes. What way so easy\r\nfor them as to have a passage, when they get to the top, between each\r\ncomb? That bees do not know all roads about the hive, can be partially\r\nproved by opening the door of a glass hive. Most of the bees about\r\nleaving, instead of going to the bottom for their exit, where they have\r\ndeparted many times, seem to know nothing of the way, but vainly try to\r\nget out through the glass, whenever light is admitted.\r\n\r\nI am so well convinced of this, that I take some pains to accommodate\r\nthem with a passage between each comb; they will then at least lose no\r\ntime by mistakes between the wrong combs, crowding and elbowing their\r\nway back through a dense mass of bees which impede every step, until\r\nagain at the top perhaps between the same combs, perhaps right, perhaps\r\nfarther off than at first; when I suppose they try it again; as boxes\r\nare filled sometimes under just such circumstances.\r\n\r\nTo assist them as much as possible, when new hives are used for swarms,\r\nI wait till the hive is nearly filled before making the holes to\r\nascertain the direction of the combs. We all know it is uncertain which\r\nway the combs will be built, when the swarm is put in, unless\r\nguide-combs are used.[15] When holes are made before the bees are put\r\nin, guide-combs as directed for boxes should be put in; (of course they\r\nshould cross at right angles the row of holes).\r\n\r\n      [15] Perhaps Miner's cross-bar hive would do it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR BORING HOLES IN FULL STOCKS.\r\n\r\n_To make holes in the top after the combs are made_,--Mark out the top\r\nas directed for making hives and boxes. A centre bit or an auger bit\r\nwith a lip or barb is best, as that cuts down a little faster than the\r\nchip is taken out, leaving it smooth; when nearly through, a pointed\r\nknife can cut the remainder of the chip loose, and it can be taken out;\r\nif it is between the combs, it is well; if directly over the centre of\r\none, it is a little better; with the knife take out a piece as large as\r\na walnut; even if honey is in it, no harm will be done. The bees will\r\nthen have a passage through from either side of the comb.\r\n\r\nAfter you have opened one hole, very likely the bees will want to see\r\nwhat is going on over head, and walk out to reconnoitre. To prevent\r\ntheir interference, use some tobacco-smoke, and send them down out of\r\nyour way, till your hole is finished. Now lay over this a small stone\r\nor block of wood, and make the others in the same way. When all are\r\ndone, blow in some smoke as you uncover them, and put on your box. This\r\nprocess is not half so formidable as it appears; I have in this way\r\nbored hundreds. You will remember my hives are not as high as many\r\nothers keep them, they are in about as convenient a position as I can\r\nget them. This method saves me the trouble of sticking the guide-combs\r\nin my hives; also, the necessity of covering or stopping the holes. Dr.\r\nBevan and some others have made a cross-bar hive, instead of nailing on\r\na top in the usual way; a half-inch board of the right length is cut\r\ninto strips, some over an inch wide, and half an inch apart, across the\r\ntop. It is plain that in such a hive a bee can pass into the box\r\nwhenever it arrives at the top, without difficulty. I will here repeat\r\nthe objection to allowing too much room, to pass into the boxes, that\r\nyou may see the disadvantages of the extremes of too little and too\r\nmuch room. In these cross-bar hives, the animal heat rises into the box\r\nfrom the main hive, making it as warm as below; the queen goes up with\r\nthe bees, and finding it warm and convenient for breeding, deposits her\r\neggs; and young brood as well as honey is found there. When we think it\r\nfull, it is then indispensable to return it, if taken off, till they\r\nhatch, (otherwise they spoil it by moulding), which makes the combs\r\ndark, tough, &c. Another objection to such open tops is, that open\r\nbottom boxes must be used, which are not half as neat for market.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BE TAKEN OFF WHEN FILLED.\r\n\r\nThis advantage attends glass boxes: while being filled, the progress\r\ncan be watched till finished, when they should be taken off to preserve\r\nthe purity of the combs. Every day the bees are allowed to run over\r\nthem, renders them darker. Consequently, when our bees are a long time\r\nfilling a box, it is not as purely white as when filled expeditiously.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME TAKEN TO FILL A BOX.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks is the shortest time I ever had any filled and finished.\r\nThis, of course, depends on the yield of honey, and size of the swarm;\r\nthree or four weeks are usually taken for the purpose. I have before\r\nsaid that the first yield of honey nearly fails in this section,\r\nusually about the 20th of July; there are some variations, later or\r\nearlier, according to the season. In other places it may be much later.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN TO TAKE OFF BOXES PART FULL.\r\n\r\nIt can be ascertained by occasionally raising the cover to your glass\r\nboxes. When no more is being added, all boxes that are worth the\r\ntrouble should be taken off; if left longer the comb gets darker, and\r\nsuch cells of honey as are not sealed over, (and sometimes the majority\r\nare such,) the bees generally remove down into the hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOBACCO SMOKE PREFERRED TO SLIDES.\r\n\r\nWhen boxes are to be taken off, if a slide of tin, zinc, &c., is used\r\nto close the holes, some of the bees are apt to be crushed, others will\r\nfind themselves minus a head, leg, or abdomen, and all of them be\r\nirritable for several days. A little tobacco smoke is preferable, as it\r\nkeeps all quiet. Just raise the box to be taken off sufficient to puff\r\nunder it some smoke, and the bees will leave the vicinity of the holes\r\nin an instant; the box can then be removed, and another put on if\r\nnecessary, without exciting their anger in the least.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANNER OF DISPOSING OF THE BEES IN THE BOXES.\r\n\r\nArouse the bees by striking the box lightly four or five times. If all\r\nthe cells are finished, and honey is still obtained, turn the box\r\nbottom up, near the hive from which it was taken, so that the bees can\r\nenter it without flying; by this means you can save several young bees,\r\nthat have never left the hive and marked the location, and a few others\r\ntoo weak to fly, but will follow the others into the hive; (such are\r\nlost when we are obliged to carry them at a distance.) Boxes can be\r\ntaken off either in the morning or evening; if in the morning, it may\r\nstand several hours when the sun is not too hot, but on no account let\r\nit stand in the sun in the middle of the day, as the combs will melt.\r\nThe bees will all leave, sometimes in an hour; at others they will not\r\nbe out in three. They may be taken off at evening and stand till\r\nmorning, in fair weather; if not too cool, they are generally all out;\r\nbut here is some risk of the moth finding it and depositing her eggs;\r\nperhaps one in fifty may be thus found.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEES DISPOSED TO CARRY AWAY HONEY.\r\n\r\nWhen boxes are taken off at the end of the honey season, a different\r\nmethod of getting rid of the bees must be adopted, or we lose our\r\nhoney. Unless the combs are all finished, we lose some then any way, as\r\nmost of the bees fill themselves before leaving; they carry it home and\r\nreturn for more immediately, and take it all, if not prevented. It has\r\nbeen recommended to take it to some dark room with a small opening to\r\nlet the bees out; in the course of the day they will sometimes all\r\nleave; but this method I have found unsafe, as they sometimes find the\r\nway back. When a large number of boxes are to be managed, a more\r\nexpeditious mode is, to have a large box with close joints, or an empty\r\nhogshead, or a few barrels with one head out, set in some convenient\r\nplace; put the boxes in, one above another, but not in a manner to stop\r\nthe holes; over the top throw a sheet of one thickness, a thin one is\r\nbest, as it will let through more light. The bees will leave the boxes,\r\ncreep to the top, and get on the sheet; take this off and turn it over\r\na few times; in this way all may be got rid of without the possibility\r\nof carrying off much honey. All that know the way will return to the\r\nhive, but a few young ones are lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT DISPOSED TO STING.\r\n\r\nThey seldom offer to sting during this part of the operation, even when\r\nthe box is taken off without tobacco smoke, and carried away from the\r\nhive; after a little time, the bees finding themselves away from home,\r\nlose all animosity.\r\n\r\nAs honey becomes scarce, less brood is reared; a great many cells that\r\nthey occupied are soon empty; also, several cells that contained honey\r\nhave been drained, and used to mature the portion of brood just started\r\nat the time of the failure. We can now understand, or think we do, why\r\nour best stocks that are very heavy, that but a few days before were\r\ncrowded for room and storing in boxes, are now eager for honey to store\r\nin the hive; as there is abundant room for several pounds. They will\r\nquickly remove to the hive the contents of any box left exposed; or\r\neven risk their lives by entering a neighboring hive for it; after\r\nbeing allowed to make a beginning, under such circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE.\r\n\r\nDuring a yield of honey, take off boxes as fast as they are filled, and\r\nput on empty ones. At the end of the season take all off. Not one stock\r\nin a hundred will starve that has worked in boxes, that is, when the\r\nhive is the proper size, and full before adding the boxes, unless\r\nrobbed or other casualty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSECURING HONEY FROM THE MOTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO THINGS TO BE PREVENTED.\r\n\r\nWhen the boxes are free from the bees, two things are to be prevented,\r\nif we wish to save our honey till cold weather. One is to keep out the\r\nworms, the other to prevent souring. The last may be new to many, but\r\nsome few of us have had it caused by dampness in warm weather. The\r\ncombs become covered with moisture, a portion of the honey becomes thin\r\nlike water, and instead of the saccharine qualities we have the acid.\r\nRemedy: keep perfectly dry and cool, if you can, but dry at any rate.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPT TO BE DECEIVED ABOUT THE WORMS.\r\n\r\nBut the worms, you can surely keep them out, you think, since you can\r\nseal up the boxes perfectly close, preventing the moth or even the\r\nsmallest ant from entering! Yes, you may do this effectually, but the\r\nworms will often be there somehow, unless in a very low temperature,\r\nsuch as a very cool cellar, or in house, and then you have dampness to\r\nguard against. I have a little experience in this matter that spoils\r\nyour theory entirely. I have taken off glass jars, and watched them\r\ntill the bees were all out, and was _certain the moth did not come\r\nnear_ them, then immediately sealed them up; absolutely preventing\r\naccess afterwards, (I could do this with a jar more effectually than a\r\nbox which is made of several pieces,) I then felt quite sure that I was\r\nahead, and should have no trouble with the worms, as had often been the\r\ncase before. I was sadly mistaken.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR PROGRESS DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, I could see at first a little white dust, like flour, on\r\nthe side of the combs, and on the bottom of the jar. As the worms grew\r\nlarger, this dust was coarser. By looking closely at the combs, a small\r\nwhite thread-like line was first perceptible, enlarging as the worm\r\nprogressed.\r\n\r\nWhen combs are filled with honey, they go only on the surface, eating\r\nnothing but the sealing of the cells; seldom penetrating to the centre,\r\nwithout an empty cell to give the chance. Disgusting as they seem to\r\nbe, they dislike being daubed with honey. _Wax, and not honey, is their\r\nfood._\r\n\r\nThe reader would like to know how these worms came in the jars, when,\r\nto all appearance, it _was a physical impossibility_. I would like to\r\ntell positively, but cannot. But I will guess, if you will allow it. I\r\nwill first premise, that I do not suppose they are generated\r\nspontaneously! Their being found there, then, would indicate some agent\r\nor means not readily perceived.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SOLUTION OFFERED.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis that I offer is original and new, and therefore open for\r\ncriticism; if there is a better way to account for the mystery, I would\r\nbe glad to know it.\r\n\r\nFrom the first of June till late in the fall, the moth may be found\r\naround our hives, active at night, but still in the day. The only\r\nobject probably is to find a suitable place to deposit its eggs, that\r\nthe young may have food; if no proper and convenient place is found,\r\nwhy, I suppose it will take up with such as it _can_ find; their eggs\r\n_must_ be deposited somewhere, it may be in the cracks in the hive, in\r\nthe dust at the bottom, or outside, as near the entrance as they dare\r\napproach. The bees running over them may get one or more of these eggs\r\nattached to their feet or bodies, and carry it among the combs, where\r\nit may be left to hatch. It is not at all probable that the moth ever\r\npassed through the hive among the bees, to deposit her eggs in the jars\r\nbefore mentioned. Had these jars been left on the hive, not a worm\r\nwould have ever defaced a comb; because, when the bees are numerous,\r\neach worm as soon as it commences its work of destruction will be\r\nremoved, that is, when it works on the surface, as in the boxes of\r\nhoney--in breeding combs, they get in the centre and are more difficult\r\nto remove. By taking off these jars and removing the bees, it gave all\r\nthe eggs that happened to be there a fair chance. Many writers finding\r\nthe combs undisturbed when left on the hive till cold weather,\r\nrecommend that as the only safe way, preferring to have the combs a\r\nlittle darker, than the risk of being destroyed by the worms. But I\r\nobject to dark combs, and leaving the boxes will effectually prevent\r\nempty ones taking their places, which are necessary to get all the\r\nprofits. I will offer a few more remarks in favor of my theory, and\r\nthen give my remedy for the worms. I have found in all hives where the\r\nbees have been removed in warm weather, say between the middle of June\r\nand September, (and it has been a great many,) moth eggs enough among\r\nthe combs to destroy them in a very short time, unless kept in a very\r\ncool place; this result has been uniform. Any person doubting this, may\r\nremove the bees from a hive that is full of combs in July or August;\r\nand close it to prevent the _possibility_ of a moth entering, set it\r\naway in a temperature ranging from sixty to ninety, and if there are\r\nnot worms enough to satisfy him that this is correct, he will have\r\nbetter success than I ever did. Yet, no such result will follow, when\r\nthe bees are left among the combs, unless the swarm be very small; then\r\nthe injury done will be in proportion. A strong stock may have as many\r\nmoth eggs among the combs as a weak one, yet one will be scarcely\r\ninjured, while the other may be nearly or quite destroyed.\r\n\r\nNow, if this theory be correct, and the bees do actually carry these\r\neggs among the combs, is there not a great deal of lost labor in trying\r\nto construct a moth-proof hive? The moth, or rather the worms, are ever\r\npresent to devour the combs, whenever the bees have left them in this\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF KILLING WORMS IN BOXES.\r\n\r\nNow, whether you are satisfied or not with the foregoing, we will\r\nproceed with the remedy. Perhaps you may find one box in ten that will\r\nhave no worms about it, others may contain from one to twenty when they\r\nhave been off a week or more. All the eggs should have a chance to\r\nhatch, which in cool weather may be three weeks. They should be\r\nwatched, that no worms get large enough to injure the combs much,\r\nbefore they are destroyed. Get a close barrel or box that will exclude\r\nthe air as much as possible; in this put the boxes, with the holes or\r\nbottom open. In one corner leave a place for a cup or dish of some\r\nkind, to hold some sulphur matches while burning. (They are made by\r\ndipping paper or rags in melted sulphur.) When all is ready, ignite the\r\nmatches, and cover close for several hours. A little care is required\r\nto have it just right: if too little is used, the worms are not killed;\r\nif too much, it gives the combs a green color. A little experience will\r\nsoon enable you to judge. If the worms are not killed on the first\r\ntrial, another dose must be administered. Much less sulphur will adhere\r\nto paper or rags, if it is very hot, when dipped, than when just above\r\nthe temperature necessary to melt it; this should be considered, as\r\nwell as the number of boxes to be smoked, size of the vessel used in\r\nsmoking them, &c.\r\n\r\nWhether this gas from burning sulphur will destroy the eggs of the moth\r\nbefore the worm appears, I have not tested sufficiently to decide; but\r\nI do know that it is an effectual quietus for the larvæ!\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEZING DESTROYS THEM.\r\n\r\nBoxes taken off at the end of warm weather, and exposed in a freezing\r\nsituation through the winter, appear to have all the worms as well as\r\neggs for them destroyed by the cold; consequently, all boxes so\r\nexposed, may be kept any length of time; the only care being necessary,\r\nto shut out the moth effectually. But don't forget to look out for all\r\ncombs from which the bees have been removed in warm weather. I prefer\r\ntaking off all boxes at the end of the first yield of honey, even when\r\nI expect to put them on again for buckwheat honey. The bees at this\r\nseason collect a great abundance of propolis, which they spread over\r\nthe inside of the boxes as well as hive; in some instances it is spread\r\non the glass so thick as to prevent the quality of honey being seen.\r\nThere is no necessity for boxes on a hive at any season when there is\r\nno yield of honey to fill them. Sometimes even in a yield of buckwheat\r\nhoney, a stock may contain too few bees to fill boxes, but just a few\r\nmay go into them and put on the propolis; this should not be allowed,\r\nas it makes it look bad when used another year. At this season,\r\n(August) some old stocks may be full of combs, and but few bees, but\r\nswarms when they have got the hive full in time, are very sure to have\r\nbees enough to go into the boxes to work. I have known them to do so in\r\nthree weeks after being hived.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTION TO USING BOXES BEFORE THE HIVE IS FULL.\r\n\r\nSome put on boxes at the time of hiving the bees. In such cases the box\r\nis often filled first, and nearly as often will contain brood. I\r\nconsider it no advantage, and often a damage to do so; as I want the\r\nhive full any way--and then if they have time let them into boxes,\r\nalthough it may be buckwheat, instead of clover honey that we get.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nSWARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME TO EXPECT THEM.\r\n\r\nThe season for regular swarms in this section, I have known to commence\r\nthe 15th of May, and in some seasons the 1st of July. The end is about\r\nthe 15th of the latter month, with some exceptions. I have had one as\r\nlate as the 21st; also a few buckwheat swarms between the 12th and 25th\r\nof August.\r\n\r\nThe subject now before us is one of thrilling interest. To the apiarian\r\nthe prospect of an increase of stocks is sufficient to create some\r\ninterest, even when the phenomenon of swarming would fail to awaken it.\r\nBut to the naturalist this season has charms that the indifferent\r\nbeholder can never realize.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL BEE-KEEPERS SHOULD UNDERSTAND IT AS IT IS.\r\n\r\nAs a guide in many cases, it is important that the practical apiarian\r\nshould understand this matter _as it is_, and not as said to be by many\r\nauthors. I shall be under the necessity of differing from nearly all in\r\nmany points.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS OF UNDERSTANDING IT.\r\n\r\nThis is another case of \"when doctors disagree, who shall decide?\" You,\r\nreader, are just the person. There is no need of a doctor at all in\r\nthis matter. I will endeavor to give a test for most of my assertions.\r\nTo make this subject as plain as possible in this place, I may repeat\r\nsome things said before. The facts related have come under my own\r\nobservation. I have probably taken more pains than most bee-keepers, to\r\nunderstand this matter to the bottom _from the beginning_, (I mean the\r\nbottom of the cells). But few apiarians have made the number of\r\nexaminations that I have to get at the _modus operandi_ of swarming.\r\nPerhaps I ought not to expect full credit for veracity, when I assure\r\nthe reader that I have inverted more than one hundred stocks to get a\r\npeep at the royal cells, some of them near a dozen times in one summer.\r\nI have inverted them frequently for the purpose of obtaining cells. But\r\ngenerally to see when such cells are being made, when they contain\r\neggs, when these eggs are sufficiently matured for swarming, or\r\nabandoned and destroyed, &c.\r\n\r\nBy these signs I predict with certainty (almost) when to expect swarms,\r\nand when to cease looking for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nINVERTING A STOCK RATHER FORMIDABLE AT FIRST.\r\n\r\nTo a person that has never inverted a hive full of bees, even to\r\noverflowing, or never has seen it done, it appears like a great\r\nundertaking, as well as the probability of ruining the stock! But after\r\nthe first trial, the magnitude of the performance is greatly\r\ndiminished, and will grow less with every repetition of the feat, until\r\nthere is not the least dread attending it. Without tobacco smoke I\r\nhardly think it practicable, but with it, there is not the least\r\ndifficulty. It would be very unsatisfactory to turn over a hive and\r\nnothing to drive the bees away from the very places on the combs that\r\nyou wish particularly to inspect. The smoke is just the thing to do it!\r\nAs for the bad effects of such overturning and smoking, I never\r\ndiscovered any.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUISITES BEFORE PREPARATION OF QUEEN'S CELLS.\r\n\r\nI have found the process for all regular swarms something like this:\r\nbefore they commence, two or three things are requisite. The combs must\r\nbe crowded with bees; they must contain a numerous brood advancing from\r\nthe egg to maturity; the bees must be obtaining honey either by being\r\nfed or from flowers. Being crowded with bees in a scarce time of honey\r\nis insufficient to bring out the swarm, neither is an abundance\r\nsufficient, without the bees and the brood. The period that all these\r\nrequisites happen together, and remain long enough, will vary with\r\ndifferent stocks, and many times do not happen at all through the\r\nseason, with some.\r\n\r\nThese causes then appear to produce a few queen-cells, generally begun\r\nbefore the hive is filled, (sometimes when only half full, but usually\r\nremain as rudiments till the next year, when the foregoing conditions\r\nof the stock may require their use).\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE OF QUEEN'S CELL WHEN USED.\r\n\r\nThey are about half finished, when they receive the eggs; as these eggs\r\nhatch into larvæ, others are begun, and receive eggs at different\r\nperiods for several days later. The number of such cells seem to be\r\ngoverned by the prosperity of the bees: when the family is numerous,\r\nand the yield of honey abundant, they may amount to twenty, at other\r\ntimes perhaps not more than two or three; although several such cells\r\nmay remain empty. I have already said that a failure, (or even a\r\npartial one), in the yield of honey at any time from the depositing of\r\nroyal eggs till the sealing of the cells, (which is about ten days),\r\nwould be likely to bring about their destruction. Even after being\r\nsealed, I have found a few instances where they were destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE WHEN SWARMS ISSUE.\r\n\r\nBut when there is nothing precarious about the honey, the sealing of\r\nthese cells is the time to expect the first swarm, which will generally\r\nissue the first fair day after one or more are finished. I never missed\r\na prediction for a swarm 48 hours, when I have judged from these signs,\r\nin a prosperous season. When there is a partial failure of honey, the\r\nswarm sometimes will wait several days after finishing them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLUSTERING OUTSIDE NOT ALWAYS TO BE DEPENDED UPON.\r\n\r\nThe clustering out of the bees I find but a poor criterion to judge\r\nfrom, further than full hives do swarm--many such do not.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATIONS--THE RESULT.\r\n\r\nI will detail a few circumstances, that have led to these conclusions.\r\nSome years ago the honey began to fail, when only about one third of my\r\ngood stocks had cast swarms; and all at once, the issues began to \"be\r\nfew and far between.\" I had previously examined, and found they had\r\ngone into preparations pretty extensively; by having not only\r\nconstructed cells, but occupied them with royal eggs and larvæ. Now I\r\nexamined again, and found five out of six had destroyed them, (at the\r\nsame time the bees clustered out extensively). This put an end to all\r\nhopes of swarms here. Some few had finished their cells, and these, I\r\nhad some hopes, would send out the swarms; but the dry weather caused\r\nsome misgivings. After waiting three or four days and none coming, I\r\nfound these sealed cells destroyed also, and had no more swarms that\r\nseason. Subsequent observations have fully confirmed these things. One\r\nseason some of the hives commenced preparations at two different\r\nperiods, and then abandoned them without swarming at all, through the\r\nsummer. The first time it was the last of May, the next in July.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nThe failure of honey was the cause, without any doubt. And who shall\r\nsay, these bees were not wise in their conduct? What prudent man would\r\nemigrate with a family, if the prospect of a famine was plainly\r\nindicated, when, by remaining at home, there was enough, at least for\r\nthe present? Who can help but admire this wise and beautiful\r\narrangement? The combs must contain brood; the bees must find honey\r\nduring the rearing of the queens. If a swarm were to issue the moment\r\nof obtaining honey, the consequence might be fatal, as there would not\r\nbe a numerous brood to hatch out, and replenish the old stock with bees\r\nsufficient to keep out the worms. Were they to issue at any time, as\r\nsoon as the bees had increased enough in numbers to spare a swarm,\r\nwithout regard to the yield of honey, they might starve.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFLICTING THEORIES.\r\n\r\nI find many theories conflicting with these views, which appear to call\r\nfor some remarks. It is generally supposed that a young queen must be\r\nmatured to issue with the swarms, and the old one with the old bees are\r\npermanent residents of the old hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOTH OLD AND YOUNG LEAVE WITH SWARMS.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that no rule governs the issue of workers. Old and young\r\ncome out promiscuously. That old bees come out may be known sometimes,\r\nby so many leaving, that not a quarter as many will be left, as\r\ncommenced work in the spring. That young bees leave, any one may be\r\nsatisfied on seeing a swarm issue; a great many too young and weak to\r\nfly will drop down in front of the hive, having come out now for the\r\nfirst time, and perhaps some of them had not been out of the cell an\r\nhour; these very young bees are known by the color.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF THE QUEEN'S INABILITY TO FLY SUGGESTED.\r\n\r\nThe old queen often gets down in the same way; but I would assign\r\nanother cause for her inability to fly; that is, I would suggest it to\r\nbe her burden of eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVIDENCE OF THE OLD QUEEN'S LEAVING.\r\n\r\nThat the old queen does leave with the first swarm is indicated by\r\nseveral things: one is, eggs may often be found on the board the next\r\nmorning; another, when the first swarm has left, and before any of\r\nthese royal cells hatch, the bees may be driven out and no queen will\r\nbe found, or you may drive out the bees at the end of three weeks, and\r\nthe brood of workers will be about all hatched, the drone brood not\r\nquite as near. The combs may also contain some eggs, and perhaps some\r\nvery young larvæ, that have been deposited by the young queen, which\r\nbegins to lay usually sixteen or eighteen days after the first swarm.\r\nThis shows a cessation of laying eggs for about two weeks. First swarms\r\nwill have eggs in the cells as soon as they are made to hold them,\r\nwhich is often within 24 hours after being hived; occasionally a new\r\npiece of comb will fall down, and, if the cells are deep enough, they\r\nare almost certain to contain eggs. I could add other proof, but the\r\nattentive observer will discover it himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. WEEKS' THEORY NOT SATISFACTORY.\r\n\r\nMr. J. M. Weeks, in his work on bees, says, \"Two causes and two only\r\ncan be assigned why bees ever swarm: the first, the crowded state of\r\nthe hive; the second, to avoid the battle of the queens.\" The first\r\ncause producing first swarms, the other second, third, &c. Mr. Colton's\r\npatent hive, it is said, can be made to swarm \"at any time within two\r\ndays,\" merely for want of room. By removing the six boxes attached to\r\nit, the bees are compelled to crowd into the main body of the hive, and\r\nswarm out in consequence. Now, if merely crowding the hive with bees is\r\nthe only cause of first swarms, how is it that half or more of mine\r\nrefused to swarm, when a great many, for want of room, were crowded\r\noutside for weeks, and great numbers maturing every day to crowd them\r\nstill more? To me the reason is plain, that some of the\r\nbefore-mentioned requisites were wanting. Mr. Weeks further says, when\r\nthe first swarm has left, \"not a single queen, in any stage of\r\nminority, is left in the old hive; the bees, destitute of a queen, set\r\nabout constructing several royal cells, take larvæ or eggs and put in\r\nthem, and feed with royal jelly, and in a few days have a queen.\"\r\nAlthough I had not had much experience at the time of getting his work,\r\nI had some doubts, because I found that all hives that became full and\r\nbegan to run over, did not swarm, and some others swarmed before being\r\nquite full; it seemed as if something like a preparation beforehand was\r\nrequisite. I knew of no means, for a long time, that would decide\r\n_positively_; when it occurred to me, if I examined the old stock\r\nimmediately after the first swarm had left, I should find some\r\npreparations if there were any; a thing so simple and easy that I felt\r\nsomewhat mortified not to have thought of it before. The first stock I\r\nlooked at revealed the secret. I examined it the evening of the day\r\nthat a swarm had left; I was gratified by finding two finished cells on\r\nthe lower edges of the combs; other cells were in different stages of\r\nprogression, from those containing an egg to the full developed larva.\r\nSeveral more hives showed the same result. I now got bold enough to\r\nexamine some previous to swarming, as I have already explained.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. MINER NOT CORRECT.\r\n\r\nMr. T. B. Miner, in his work, has allowed the preparation of queen\r\ncells previous to swarming, but he has put off the time of the swarm\r\nissuing eight or nine days too long. That is, he has the young queen\r\nmatured so that she commences piping first, which does not occur more\r\nthan one time in fifty.\r\n\r\nNow I think it more than probable that many readers will have some\r\ndoubts in regard to my statements about this swarming matter. Yet I\r\nthink I can give directions sufficiently particular that they may\r\nremove them themselves. They should bear in mind that they have no\r\nright to be _positive_ on any subject without an investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICULAR DIRECTIONS FOR TESTING THE MATTER.\r\n\r\nI will now give more minute directions for an examination. Full hives\r\nrequire a little more care than those containing fewer bees. Don't let\r\nthe crowded state of the hive, even if some are outside, deter you from\r\ngratifying a laudable curiosity, (such hives are most likely to possess\r\nthese cells.) Let the satisfaction of ascertaining a few facts for\r\nyourselves stimulate you to this exertion, the risk is not much; what I\r\nhave done you may do. This is better than to rely on any man's \"_ipse\r\ndixit_.\" I do it without any protection whatever for face or hands;\r\nbut, if you have too much fear of stings, a veil to protect the face\r\nmay be put on, but do without it, if you can find the courage, as you\r\nwill want a good view. The best time is, when most of the bees are out\r\nat work near the middle of the day; but then the bees from the other\r\nhives are sometimes cross, and interfere. On that account I prefer\r\nmorning or evening, although there are more bees to be smoked out of\r\nthe way. If you are accustomed to smoking tobacco, you will find a pipe\r\njust the thing for making a smoke here; if not, vide a description of\r\nan apparatus in chap. 18th, p. 281. When you are ready to proceed, some\r\nsmoke must be blown under the hive before you touch it; then raise the\r\nfront side a few inches, and blow in some more; now carefully lift the\r\nhive from the stand, avoiding any jar, as this would arouse their\r\nanger; turn it bottom upwards; also, be careful all the time not to\r\nbreathe among them. More smoke will now make them crowd among the combs\r\nout of your way while you examine. It is very common for the bees to\r\nset up a buzzing, and rush up the sides of the hive, but a little smoke\r\nwill drive them back; get them out of the way as much as possible, and\r\nlook on the edges of the combs for the queens' cells, where most of\r\nthem are. If the hive is fully supplied with honey, they will be near\r\nthe bottom, if not, farther up among the combs; in some hives they\r\ncannot be seen even where they exist. Yet they may be found in four out\r\nof five, by a thorough search. I have found nine within two inches of\r\nthe bottom, some on the extreme ends of the comb. I would here give a\r\ncaution about turning over hives with very new combs, before they are\r\nattached to the sides of the hive, as they are apt to bend over.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPTY HIVES TO BE READY.\r\n\r\nWe will now suppose that some of your stocks are ready to cast their\r\nswarms: we will also presume that your empty hives for the reception of\r\nswarms are ready before this period; to prepare a hive after the swarm\r\nhas issued is bad management; negligence here argues negligence\r\nelsewhere; it is one of the premonitions of \"bad luck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBOTTOM-BOARDS FOR HIVING.\r\n\r\nYou will want also a number of bottom-boards, expressly for hiving; get\r\na board a little larger than the bottom of the hive, nail strips across\r\nthe ends on the under side to prevent warping; in the middle cut out a\r\nspace five or six inches square, and cover with wire cloth. These are\r\nfor your large swarms in very hot weather, to be used for four or five\r\ndays. They are much safer than to raise the hive an inch or more for\r\nventilation. They are also essential for many other occasions. I would\r\nnot do without them, even if the expense was ten times what it is.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF SWARM ISSUING.\r\n\r\nWhen the day is fair and not too much wind, first swarms generally\r\nissue from ten o'clock till three; if you are on the lookout, the first\r\noutside indication of a swarm, will be an unusual number of bees around\r\nthe entrance, from one to sixty minutes before they start. The utmost\r\nconfusion seems to prevail, bees running about in every direction; the\r\nentrance apparently closed with the mass of bees, (perhaps one\r\nexception in twenty,) presently a column from the interior forces a\r\npassage to the open air; they come rushing out by hundreds, all\r\nvibrating their wings as they march out; and when a few inches from the\r\nentrance, rise in the air; some run up the side of the hive, others to\r\nthe edge of the bottom-board. If you have seen the old queen come\r\nrushing out the first one, and the rest following her, as we are often\r\ntold she does, you have seen what I never did in a first swarm! Second\r\nand third swarms conduct themselves quite differently. I have seen the\r\nold queen issue a few times, but not till half the swarm was out.\r\n\r\nThe bees when first rising from the hive, describe circles of but few\r\nfeet, but as they recede, they spread over an area of several rods.\r\nTheir movement are much slower than usual, in a few minutes thousands\r\nmay be seen revolving in every possible direction! A swarm may be seen\r\nand heard, at a distance, where fifty hives, ordinarily at work, would\r\nnot be noticed! When about out of the hive, or soon after, some branch\r\nof a tree or bush is usually selected on which to cluster. In less than\r\nhalf a minute after the spot is indicated, even when the bees are\r\nspread over an acre, they are gathered in the immediate vicinity, and\r\nall cluster in a body from five to ten minutes after leaving the hive.\r\nThey should now be hived immediately, as they show impatience if left\r\nlong, especially in the sun; also, if another stock should send out a\r\nswarm while they were hanging there, they would be quite sure to mix\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANNER OF HIVING CAN BE VARIED.\r\n\r\nIt makes but little difference what way they are put in the hive,\r\nproviding they are all made to go in. Proceed as is most convenient; an\r\nold table or bench is very good to keep them out of the grass if there\r\nshould happen to be any; if there is not much in the way, lay your\r\nbottom-board on the ground, make it level, set your hive on it, and\r\nraise one edge an inch or more to give the bees a chance to enter.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSUAL METHOD.\r\n\r\nCut off the branch with the bees, if it can be done as well as not, and\r\nshake it in front of the hive, a portion will discover it, and will at\r\nonce commence a vibration of their wings; this, I suppose, is a call\r\nfor the others. A knowledge of a new home being found seems to be\r\ncommunicated in this way, as it is kept up until all are in. A great\r\nmany are apt to stop about the entrance, thereby nearly or quite\r\nclosing it, and preventing others going in, when they will gather on\r\nthe outside. You can expedite the matter with a stick or quill, by\r\ngently pushing them away; and another portion will enter. When gentle\r\nmeans will not induce them to go in, in a reasonable time, and they\r\nappear obstinate, a little water sprinkled on them will facilitate\r\noperations greatly, when nothing else will. (Be careful and not over-do\r\nthe matter, by using too much water, they can be so wet as not to move\r\nat all.)\r\n\r\nWhen they cluster on a branch that you do not wish to cut off, place\r\nyour bottom-board as near as convenient; on it lay two sticks about an\r\ninch in diameter, of the same length: try the hive, and see that all is\r\nright; then turn it bottom up, directly under the main part of the\r\ncluster; if you have an assistant, let him jar the branch sufficiently\r\nto detach the bees; most of them will fall directly into the hive. If\r\nno assistant is at hand it is unnecessary to wait, (I have done it a\r\nhundred times without help); with the bottom of the hive strike the\r\nunder side of the branch hard enough to dislodge them, then turn it on\r\nthe board; the sticks will prevent the bottom crushing many bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN OUT OF REACH.\r\n\r\nI have gone up a ladder fifteen feet, got the bees in the hive in this\r\nway, and backed down without difficulty. After putting the hive in its\r\nplace, sometimes a part will go back; in that case, a small branch full\r\nof leaves should be held directly under and close to them, and as many\r\njarred on it as possible. Hold this still, and shake the other to\r\nprevent their clustering there; you will soon have them all collected,\r\nready to bring down, and put by the hive. A handle basket or large tin\r\npan may be taken up the ladder instead of the hive, when they can be\r\nreadily emptied before it. But very few will fly out in coming down. If\r\nyou succeed in getting nearly all the bees in the first effort, and but\r\nfew are left, merely shaking the branch will be sufficient to prevent\r\ntheir holding fast, and will turn their attention to those below, where\r\nthose which have already found a hive will be doing their best to call\r\nthem. When the hive is first turned over, most of the bees fall on the\r\nboard and rush out, but as soon as it is realized that a home is found,\r\na buzzing commences inside; this quickly communicates the fact to those\r\noutside, which immediately turn about, facing the hive and hum in\r\nconcert, while marching in.\r\n\r\nAnother plan may be adopted, even if fifteen feet high; when the branch\r\nis not too large, and there is not too much in the way below it. Have\r\nready two or three light poles of suitable length; select such as have\r\na branch at the upper end, large enough to hold a two-bushel basket.\r\nThis is raised directly under the swarm; with another pole, the bees\r\nare all dislodged, and fall into the basket, and are quickly let down.\r\nNow, if you have got about all, throw a sheet over for a few moments,\r\nto prevent their escape. They soon become quiet, and may be hived\r\nwithout many going back to the branch, as they do, when attempting to\r\nhive them immediately.\r\n\r\nI often have them begin to cluster near the ground, very conveniently\r\nfor hiving. In such a case, I do not wait for all to collect, but as\r\nsoon as such place is indicated, I get the board and hive ready. When a\r\nquart or so are gathered, shake them in a hive, and set it up; the\r\nswarm will now go to that, instead of the branch, especially if the\r\nlatter is shaken a little. Where many stocks are kept, it is advisable\r\nto be as expeditious as possible. A swarm will thus hive itself much\r\nsooner than when it is allowed to cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN THEY CANNOT BE SHAKEN OFF.\r\n\r\nSwarms will sometimes get in places where it is impossible to jar them\r\noff, or cut off a branch, such as the trunk of a tree, or a large limb\r\nnear it. In which case place the hive near, as first directed; take a\r\nlarge tin dipper, a vessel most convenient for the purpose, and dip it\r\nfull of bees; with one hand turn back the hive; with the other throw\r\nthe bees into it; some of them will discover that a home is provided,\r\nand set up the call for the rest, (by the vibration of their wings),\r\nand the remainder may be emptied in front of the hive as you dip them\r\noff. I have known a few instances when the first dipper full all ran\r\nout, and joined the others without making the discovery that they were\r\nin a hive, but this is seldom the case. When you get the queen in,\r\nthere is no trouble with the remainder, even if there are many left; as\r\nsoon as they ascertain that the queen is no longer among them, it may\r\nbe known by their uneasy movements, and they will soon leave, and join\r\nthose in the hive; but if the queen is yet on the tree, and but a dozen\r\nwith her, they will leave the hive and cluster again.\r\n\r\n\r\nALL SHOULD BE MADE TO ENTER.\r\n\r\nIn all cases be sure to get them all to enter; a cluster outside of it\r\nmay contain the queen, unconscious of a home so near; and the probable\r\nconsequence might be, she would leave for a miserable one in the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOULD BE TAKEN TO THE STAND IMMEDIATELY.\r\n\r\nWhen all are in, except a few that will be flying, let the hive down\r\nclose to the board; take hold of this and carry it at once to the stand\r\nthey are to occupy, and raise the front edge half an inch; let the back\r\nrest on the board; this will give them means to re-ascend, if they\r\nchance to drop, which large swarms often do in hot weather. If the\r\nbottom is an inch or more from the board when the bees fall, there is\r\nnothing to prevent their rushing out on every side--their means of\r\ngetting up again are bad--if the queen comes out with the rush, there\r\nare some chances for their leaving.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION FROM THE SUN NECESSARY.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is very important; _swarms should be protected from the\r\nsun for several days, in hot weather_, from nine o'clock till three or\r\nfour; and then if the heat is very oppressive, and the bees cluster\r\noutside, sprinkle them with water and drive them in; and by wetting the\r\nhive occasionally, it will carry off a large portion of the heat, and\r\nmake it much more comfortable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLUSTERING BUSHES.\r\n\r\nIf there are no large trees in the vicinity of your apiary, all the\r\nbetter, as there will then be no danger of your swarms lighting on\r\nthem; but all bee-keepers are not so fortunate, myself being one of the\r\nnumber. In such a place it is necessary to provide something for them\r\nto cluster on; get some bushes six or eight feet high (hemlock is\r\npreferable); cut off the ends of the branches, except a few near the\r\ntop: secure the whole with strings to prevent swaying in ordinary\r\nwinds; make a hole in the earth deep enough to hold them, and large\r\nenough to be lifted out easily. The bees will be likely to cluster on\r\nsome of these; they can then be raised out, and the bees hived without\r\ndifficulty. A bunch of dry mullein tops tied together on the end of a\r\npole, makes a very good place for clustering; it so nearly resembles a\r\nswarm that the bees themselves appear to be sometimes deceived. I have\r\nfrequently known them leave a branch where they had begun to cluster,\r\nand settle on this when held near.\r\n\r\nThe motives for immediately removing the swarm to the stand are, that\r\nthey are generally more convenient to watch in case they are disposed\r\nto leave; also many bees can be saved. All that leave the hive, mark\r\nthe location the same as in spring; several hundreds will probably\r\nleave the first day; a few may leave several times; when removed at\r\nnight, such will return to the stand of the previous day, and generally\r\nare lost; whereas, if they are carried at once to a permanent stand,\r\nthis loss is avoided.\r\n\r\nThose that are left flying at the time, return to the old stock, which\r\nthose that return from the swarm the next day will not always do. The\r\ntime for moving them now is no more than at another. It is unnecessary\r\nto object, and say, that \"it will take too long to wait for the bees to\r\nget in;\" this will not do. I shall insist on your getting all the bees\r\nto enter before leaving any way. I consider this an essential feature\r\nin the management. I will not say that my directions will _always_\r\nprevent their going to the woods, but this I do say, that out of the\r\nhundreds that I have hived, not one has ever left. It is possible\r\nproper management has had no influence in my success, yet something\r\nlike an opinion of this kind has been indulged for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW SWARMS ARE GENERALLY MANAGED THAT LEAVE FOR THE WOODS.\r\n\r\nSome of my neighboring bee-keepers lose a quarter or half of their\r\nswarms by flight, and how do they manage? When the word is given out,\r\n\"Bees swarming,\" a tin-horn, tin-pan, bells, or anything to make a\r\n\"horrible din,\" is seized upon in the hurry of the moment, and as much\r\nnoise made as possible, to _make_ them cluster; (which they naturally\r\nwould do without the music, at least all mine have. This probably gave\r\nrise to the opinion of one old lady, who _knew_ \"drumming on a pan did\r\ngood, for she had tried it.\") Very often a hive is to be constructed,\r\nor an old one unfit to use any way, needs some sticks across, or\r\nsomething to take time. When the hive is obtained, it must be washed\r\nwith something nice to make the bees like it; a little honey must be\r\ndaubed on the inside; sugar and water, molasses and water, salt and\r\nwater, or salt and water rubbed on with hickory leaves, \"is the best\r\nthing in the world;\" several other things are just as good, and some\r\nare better. Even whisky, that bane of man, has been offered them as a\r\nbribe to stay, and sometimes they are persuaded and go to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTHING BUT BEES NEEDED IN A HIVE.\r\n\r\nNow I cannot say positively that these things do harm, yet I am quite\r\nsure they do no good, as nothing but bees is needed in a hive. Is it\r\nreasonable to suppose they are fond of all the \"knick-knacks\" given\r\nthem? I have never used any, and could not possibly have done better. I\r\nam careful to have the hive sweet and clean, and not too smooth inside;\r\nan old hive that has been used before is scalded and scraped.\r\n\r\nBut to the manner they get the bees in, after the hive is ready. A\r\ntable is set out, and a cloth spread on it; sticks are put on to raise\r\nthe hive an inch or more: if they succeed in getting the swarm even on\r\nthe outside of the hive it is left; if they go in, it is well; if they\r\ngo off, why hope for \"better luck next time.\" The hive is left\r\nunsheltered in the hot sun and when there is no wind, the heat is soon\r\ninsupportable, or at least very oppressive; the bees hang in loose\r\nstrings, instead of a compact body, as when kept cool; they are very\r\napt to fall, and when they do, will rush out from every side: if the\r\nqueen chances to drop with them, they _may_ \"step out.\" Two thirds of\r\nall the bees that go to the woods are managed in this, or a similar\r\nmanner, and may it not be said, they are fairly driven off?\r\n\r\n\r\nSELDOM GO OFF WITHOUT CLUSTERING.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one swarm in three hundred will depart for the woods without\r\nfirst clustering. I have had three times that number, not one of which\r\nhas ever left me thus. Yet I have evidence not to be disputed that some\r\nwill do it. Three instances have occurred near me that satisfied me of\r\nthe fact. Two were lost, the other was followed to a tree, half a mile\r\noff; I assisted in cutting the tree, and hiving them. The cavity where\r\nthey entered was very small, and contained old comb, made by a swarm a\r\nyear or two previous, which had probably starved, as there was too\r\nlittle room for storing sufficient honey for winter. This swarm, when\r\nhived and carried home, remained perfectly contented.\r\n\r\n\r\nDO SWARMS CHOOSE A LOCATION BEFORE SWARMING?\r\n\r\nThe inquiry is often made, Do all swarms have a place looked out before\r\nleaving the parent stock? The answer to this must ever be guess-work. I\r\ncould offer some circumstances indicating the affirmative very\r\nstrongly, and as much for the negative; and will let it pass at that.\r\nYet I think if bees are properly cared for, that ninety-nine swarms in\r\na hundred will prefer a good clean hive to a rotten tree in the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS OF ARRESTING A SWARM.\r\n\r\nI have had three swarms that were exceptions to general rules, giving\r\nme some trouble by swarming out after being hived; the third and fourth\r\ntime they left, I threw water among them, causing quite a shower; when\r\nmy pail-full was out, I used earth; they went but a short distance, and\r\nclustered in the usual way. Now were these bees intending to leave, and\r\nhad their designs frustrated by the water and earth? I am not quite as\r\nsure as the old lady, who _knew_ that \"drumming on a tin-pan did good,\"\r\nbut I am inclined to think it had some effect. I have heard of several\r\ninstances where swarms were apparently stopped, by having earth thrown\r\namong them, while passing over a field where men were at work. We know\r\nthey dislike being wet, as we see them hastening home on the approach\r\nof a shower; or we can at any time drive them in the hive by sprinkling\r\nthem with water. Throwing water in the swarm is a kind of imitation\r\nshower, and earth is something like it. Whether useful or not, these\r\nswarms leaving the hive was rather suspicious, and I should try it\r\nagain under similar circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME COMPULSION.\r\n\r\nAfter getting them in the hive for the fourth time, I resolved not to\r\nbe baffled or have much more such trouble, and perhaps go to the woods\r\nat last, thereby setting a bad example. I put under the hive the\r\nwire-cloth bottom-board, opened two or three holes on the top, and\r\ncovered these also with wire-cloth, (this was to let the air\r\ncirculate); a quantity of honey and water was given them and they were\r\nthen carried to the cellar, and kept prisoners four days, except half\r\nan hour before sunset; when too late to leave for a journey, I set them\r\nout to provide a few necessaries, and then returned them to the cellar.\r\nIn four days, when _honey enough_ is given them, a good swarm will half\r\nfill an ordinary hive with combs. Some of the first eggs deposited will\r\nbe about hatching into larvæ, all of which would seem like too much to\r\nleave. I now set them out, and gave them liberty; shading the hive,\r\n&c., as before directed. They all proved faithful and industrious,\r\nprospering like others. If their design was for a distant location,\r\nthey put a good face on the matter in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW FAR WILL THEY GO IN SEARCH OF A HOME?\r\n\r\nHow far they will travel in search of a home, is also uncertain. I have\r\nheard of their going seven miles, but could not learn how the fact was\r\nproved. I have no experience of my own in this matter, but will relate\r\na circumstance that happened near me a few years since. A neighbor was\r\nploughing, when a swarm passed over him; being near the earth, he\r\n\"pelted them heartily\" with the loose dirt he had ploughed up, which\r\nseemed to bring them up, or rather down, as they clustered on a very\r\nlow bush; they were hived, and gave no further trouble. A man living\r\nsome three miles from this neighbor, on that day hived a swarm about\r\neleven o'clock, and left them to warm up in the sun as described a page\r\nor two back; about three o'clock their stock of patience was probably\r\nexhausted, when they resolved to seek a better shelter. They put off in\r\na great hurry, not even waiting to thank their owner for the spread on\r\nhis table, and the sweet-scented \"yarbs\" and good things with which he\r\nhad rubbed their hive. They gave him no notice whatever of their\r\nintention to \"quit,\" until they were moving! With all their goods ready\r\npacked, they were soon under way, accompanied by their owner with\r\nmusic; but whether they marched with martial precision, keeping time,\r\nis uncertain. In this case the bees took the lead; the man with his\r\ntin-pan music kept the rear, and was soon at a respectful distance.\r\nThey were either not in a mood, just then, to be charmed by melodious\r\nsounds, or their business was too urgent to allow them to stop and\r\nlisten! Their means of locomotion being superior to his, he gave up in\r\ndespair, out of breath, after following about a mile. Another person,\r\nabout the same time in the day, saw a swarm moving in the same\r\ndirection of the first; he also followed them till compelled to yield\r\nto their greater travelling facilities. A third discovered their flight\r\nand attempted a race, but like the others soon came out behind. The\r\nbefore-mentioned neighbor saw them, and thought of the fresh earth that\r\nhe had ploughed up, which he threw among them till they stopped. How\r\nmuch farther they would have gone, if any, would be guessing. That it\r\nwas the same swarm that started three miles away, appears almost\r\ncertain; the direction was the same as seen by all, until they were\r\nstopped; the time in the day also exactly corresponded.\r\n\r\nWe will now return to the issuing of the swarms. There will be some\r\nemergencies to provide for, and some exceptions to notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO OR MORE SWARMS LIABLE TO UNITE.\r\n\r\nIf we expect to keep many stocks, the chances are that two or more may\r\nissue at one time; and when they do, they nearly always cluster\r\ntogether (I once knew an instance where only three stocks were kept;\r\nthey all swarmed and clustered together). It is plain that the greater\r\nthe number of stocks, the more such chances are multiplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISADVANTAGE.\r\n\r\nOne first swarm, if of the usual size, will contain bees enough for\r\nprofit, yet two such will work together without quarrelling, and will\r\nstore about one-third more than either would alone; that is, if each\r\nsingle swarm would get 50 lbs., the two together would not get over 70\r\nlbs., perhaps less. Here, then, is a loss of 30 lbs., besides one of\r\nthe swarms is about lost for another year; because such double swarms\r\nare not generally any better the next spring as a stock, and often not\r\nas good as a single one. You will therefore see the advantage of\r\nkeeping the first swarms separate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAN OFTEN BE PREVENTED.\r\n\r\n\"Prevention is better than cure.\" We can, if we keep a good lookout,\r\noften prevent more than one issuing at a time. This depends on our\r\nknowledge of indications, in a great measure. I have said that before\r\nstarting to fly off, they were about the entrance in great numbers;\r\nthere may be one exception in twenty, where the first indications will\r\nbe a column of bees rushing from the hive. To take this matter a little\r\nfarther from the surface, we will take a peep at the interior; that is,\r\nif our hives contain glass boxes, such as have been recommended. It is\r\nan advantage to know which are about to cast their swarms, as long\r\nbeforehand as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDICATIONS OF SWARMING INSIDE THE HIVE.\r\n\r\nThese glass boxes are usually filled with bees; before leaving they may\r\nbe seen in commotion, long before any unusual stir is visible outside,\r\nsometimes for near an hour. The same may be noticed in a glass hive.\r\nNow, in good weather, when we have reason to expect many swarms, it is\r\nour duty to watch closely, especially when the weather has been\r\nunfavorable for several days previous. A number of stocks may have\r\nfinished their queen-cells during the bad weather, and be ready to come\r\nout within the first hour of sunshine that occurs in the middle of the\r\nday. We must expect some such occurrences, and in large apiaries there\r\nis apt to be trouble, unless you take some precautions. If you have\r\ntaken no care (which but few will), by previous examinations, to know\r\nwhich are ready, as soon as one has started or commenced flying, look\r\nat all the rest that are in condition to swarm; or, what is much\r\nbetter, look before any have started. Even if nothing unusual is seen\r\nabout the entrance, raise the cover to the boxes. If the bees in them\r\nare all quiet as usual, no swarm need be immediately apprehended, and\r\nyou will probably have time to hive one or two first.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTING A SWARM ISSUING FOR A TIME.\r\n\r\nBut should you discover the bees running to and fro in great commotion,\r\nalthough there may be but few about the entrance, you should lose no\r\ntime in sprinkling those outside with water from a watering-pot, or\r\nother means. They will immediately enter the hive to avoid the supposed\r\nshower. In half an hour they will be ready to start again, in which\r\ntime the others may be secured. I have had, in one apiary, twelve hives\r\nall ready in one day, and did actually swarm; several of which would\r\nhave started at once, had they not been kept back with water, allowing\r\nonly one at a time, thus keeping them separate. They had been kept back\r\nby the clouds, which broke away about noon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PREVENT SWARMS UNITING WITH THOSE ALREADY HIVED.\r\n\r\nWhen any of the subsequent swarms were disposed to unite with those\r\nalready hived, a sheet was thrown over to keep them out. I had four so\r\ncovered at once. An assistant, in such cases, is very important; one\r\ncan watch symptoms and keep them back, while the other hives the\r\nswarms.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, when ready for a swarm and waiting for one to start, two\r\nmay do so at once. Whenever a part have got on the wing, I never\r\nsucceeded in stopping the issue: consequently I have found it useless\r\ntrying to drive or coax them back in such cases. To succeed, the means\r\nmust be used in season, before any of the swarm leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN TWO HAVE UNITED, THE METHOD OF SEPARATING.\r\n\r\nTwo or more swarms will cluster together, and not quarrel, if put in\r\none hive; I have already told you the disadvantages. Unless business is\r\nvery urgent, your time cannot be better employed than in dividing them.\r\nFirst, it is necessary to provide a good stock of patience, as it may\r\nbe a short job, or it may be a long one. Get two empty hives, and\r\ndivide the bees as nearly equal as possible. It is generally the best\r\nway to spread a sheet on the ground, and shake the bees in the centre,\r\nand set the hives each side of the mass, their edges raised to allow\r\nthe bees to enter; if too many are disposed to enter one hive, set it\r\nfarther off. If they cluster in a situation where they cannot be got to\r\nthe earth in a body, they must be dipped off as before directed, but,\r\nin this case, putting a dipper full in each hive alternately, until all\r\nare in. They should be made to hurry some in going in; keep the\r\nentrance clear, and stir them up often; or sprinkle a very little water\r\non them, as they should not be allowed to stop their humming until all\r\nare in. We have one chance in two of getting a queen in each. The two\r\nhives should now be placed twenty feet apart; if there is a queen in\r\neach, the bees in both will remain quiet, and the work is done; but if\r\nnot, the bees in the one destitute will soon manifest it by running\r\nabout in all directions, and, when the queen cannot be found, will\r\nleave for the other hive, where there are probably two, a few going at\r\na time. Now there are two or three methods of separating these queens;\r\none is, to empty the bees out and proceed as before, a kind of chance\r\ngame, that may succeed at the next trial, and may have to be repeated.\r\nAnother way is, that, as soon as it is ascertained which is without a\r\nqueen, before many bees leave, spread down a sheet; set this hive on\r\nit, and tie the corners over the top to secure the bees for the\r\npresent, turn the hive on its side for the present to give them air; or\r\nit may be let down on a wire cloth bottom-board and the hole in the\r\nside stopped, and this would be less likely to smother the bees, if it\r\ncould be secured to the bottom, and have the hive lie on its side; when\r\nthis division is secured, get another hive, and jar out those with the\r\nqueens; let them enter as before, and then set them apart, &c.,\r\nwatching the result; if the queens are not yet separate, it will be\r\nknown by the same appearances. The process must be continued till\r\nseparate, or the number with the queens may be easily looked over, and\r\none of them found; indeed, a sharp lookout should be kept up from the\r\nbeginning, and the queens caught, if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO DANGER OF A STING BY THE QUEEN.\r\n\r\nNo danger of her sting need be apprehended, as she will not demean\r\nherself to use that for a common foe; she must have a _royal_\r\nantagonist. When successful in obtaining one, it is sufficient; put her\r\nin a tumbler or some safe place; then put your bees in two hives, place\r\nthem as directed, and you will soon learn where your queen is needed.\r\nAfter all is done, the two hives should not be nearer than twenty feet,\r\nat least the first day; perhaps forty would be still better. When two\r\nswarms are mixed, and then separated, it is evident that a portion of\r\neach swarm must be in both hives. A queen in each must of course be a\r\nstranger to at least a part of the bees; these might, if their own\r\nmother was too near, discover her, and leave the stranger for an old\r\nacquaintance, and, in the act of going, call or attract the whole with\r\nthem, including the queen. I have known a few instances of the kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME PRECAUTIONS IN HIVING TWO SWARMS TOGETHER.\r\n\r\nIf you are disposed to separate them, but are afraid to work among them\r\nto this extent in the middle of the day, or if there is danger of more\r\nissuing, to mix with them, and add to your perplexity, of which you\r\nalready have enough, then you can hive them as a single swarm; but,\r\ninstead of a bottom-board, invert an empty hive and set the one with\r\nthe swarm on this, and insert a wedge between them, for ventilation. As\r\nmany bees are liable to drop down, in this case the lower hive will\r\ncatch them, and there is less danger of leaving. Let them remain till\r\nnear sunset, when another course may be taken to find a queen, though\r\nby that time one is sometimes killed; yet it is well to know the fact.\r\nTake them to some place out of the sun, as a less number will fly\r\nduring the operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO FIND QUEEN, WHEN TWO STRANGERS ARE TOGETHER.\r\n\r\nFirst, look into the lower hive for a dead queen, and, if none is found\r\nthere, look thoroughly, as far as possible, for a little compact\r\ncluster of bees, the size of a hen's egg, that may be rolled about\r\nwithout separating. Secure this cluster in a tumbler; it is quite sure\r\none of the queens is a prisoner in the middle;[16] should two be seen,\r\nget both. Then divide the bees, and give the one destitute, a queen;\r\nor, if you have two, one to each, as the case may be. It would be well\r\nfirst to see if the queen was alive, by removing the bees from about\r\nher. But should you find nothing of the kind, spread a sheet on the\r\nground, shake the bees on one end of it, and set the hive on the other;\r\nthey will immediately begin a march for the hive. You may now see the\r\ncluster, and may not; but they will spread out in marching, and give a\r\ngood chance to see her majesty, when a tumbler is the most convenient\r\nthing to set over her. No matter if a few bees are shut up with her,\r\nthere is no risk, then, in your eagerness to get the queen, of taking\r\nhold of a worker or two. A piece of window-glass can be slipped under,\r\nand you have her safe, and by this time you will know what is to be\r\ndone next. This operation could not well be done in the middle of the\r\nday, or in the sun, as too many bees would be flying, and greatly\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\n      [16] All stranger queens, introduced into a stock or swarm, are\r\n      secured and detained in this manner by the workers, but whether\r\n      _they_ dispatch them, or this is a means adopted to incite them\r\n      to a deadly conflict, writers do not agree, and I shall not\r\n      attempt a decision, as I never saw the bees voluntarily release a\r\n      queen thus confined. But I have seen queens, when no bees\r\n      interfered, rush together in a fatal rencounter, and one of them\r\n      was soon left a fallen victim of the contest. 'Tis said it\r\n      _never_ happens that both are killed in these battles,--perhaps\r\n      not. As I never saw _quite all_ of these royal combats, of course\r\n      I cannot decide.\r\n\r\nShould you fail in finding a queen, and cannot succeed in making a\r\ndivision in consequence, or should you resolve, from want of time,\r\npatience or energy, to let them remain together in the beginning, it is\r\nunnecessary to get a hive any larger than usual for two swarms; they\r\nwill certainly find room by cold weather: if more than two, they\r\n_should_ be divided by all means; it will be a disadvantage for another\r\nyear. For the first four days, when two large swarms are together, it\r\nis necessary to keep an inverted hive under them, but much longer it\r\nwould not do, as they might extend their combs into the lower hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOXES FOR DOUBLE SWARMS IMMEDIATELY.\r\n\r\nIt should then be taken out, and boxes immediately put on, which should\r\nbe changed for empty ones, as fast as they are filled. Yet, this extra\r\nhoney is not quite as much advantage as increase of stocks; when that\r\nis an object, I will recommend another disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETURNING A PART TO THE OLD STOCK.\r\n\r\nSeparate one-third or more of the two swarms, being sure there is no\r\nqueen with this part, (by the test given of setting them at a distance)\r\nand then return them to one of the old stocks; they will immediately\r\nenter without contention, and issue again in about nine days, or as\r\nsoon as a young queen is matured to go with them. There may be an\r\nexception to this, of one in twenty. I would have recommended this\r\ncourse in all cases of the kind, but there will be a loss of time for\r\nthe bees in the old stock; because they are apt to be rather idle, even\r\nwhen they might labor in the boxes; and here there is a loss of some\r\neight or ten days. The collections of a good swarm may be estimated at\r\nleast one pound a day, (often two or three.) A swarm that just fills\r\nthe hive, would make at least ten pounds box-honey, if it could have\r\nbeen located ten days earlier. Still another method may be adopted when\r\nyou have a very small swarm, one that is not likely to fill the hive,\r\nand has not been hived more than two or three days. A third of your two\r\nswarms may be put in with that; taking care, as before, not to let your\r\nonly queen go with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF UNITING.\r\n\r\nThe manner of doing it is very simple; get them in a hive as before\r\ndirected, and jar them out in front of the one you wish them to enter,\r\nor invert it, setting the other over, and let them run up.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN CARE IS NECESSARY.\r\n\r\nExcept on the day of swarming, care is necessary not to introduce a\r\nsmall number with a large swarm; they are liable to be destroyed. The\r\ndanger is much greater than to put together about an equal number, or a\r\nlarge number put in with a few. The day that swarms issue, they will\r\ngenerally mix peaceably, but in proportion as time intervenes between\r\nthe issues, so will be the liability to quarrel. Yet, I have united two\r\nfamilies of about equal numbers in the fall and spring, and, with a few\r\nexceptions, have had no difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWARM-CATCHER.\r\n\r\nThere is another method of keeping swarms separate, contrived and used\r\nby a Mr. Loucks, of Herkimer Co., N.Y. He calls it a swarm-catcher; he\r\nhas a half dozen of them, and says he would not do without for one\r\nseason, for fifty dollars, as he has a large apiary. I made one as near\r\nas I could from seeing his, without taking the exact measure. I got out\r\nfour light posts four and half feet long, one inch square; then twelve\r\npieces of one-quarter inch stuff, four inches wide; the four for the\r\ntop twelve inches long, for the bottom two were fourteen inches long,\r\nand two were twenty. These were thoroughly nailed on the ends of the\r\nposts, making it into an upright frame, the other four pieces were\r\nnailed around the middle, which made the frame firmer. I made a frame\r\nfor the top, of four pieces, each an inch and a half in width, and half\r\ninch thick, halved at the ends and nailed together, and fastened by\r\nhinges to one side of the top, and a catch to hold it shut. The whole\r\nwas now covered with very thin cloth to admit the light, but not so\r\nopen as to let the bees through, (Mr. Loucks used cloth made for\r\ncheese-strainers.) I now had a covered frame four and half feet high,\r\n12 inches square at the top, at the bottom 14 by 20, with a door or lid\r\nat the top, to let out the bees. On each side of the bottom I tacked a\r\npiece of common muslin, near a yard in length. When a swarm is ready to\r\nissue, the bottom of this frame is set up before the hive, one edge of\r\nthe bottom rests on the bottom-board, the other against the side of the\r\nhive; the top sets off from the hive at an angle of about 45 degrees,\r\nunder which a brace is set to hold it. The muslin at the bottom is to\r\nwrap around the hive at the side to prevent the escape of the bees. The\r\nswarm rushes into this without any hesitation.\r\n\r\nWhen done coming out, the muslin at the bottom is drawn over it, and\r\nthe frame is set in an upright position, and allowed to stand a few\r\nminutes for the bees to get quiet in the top. It is now to be laid on\r\nits side, the door opened, and the bees hived. In the few trials that I\r\nhave given it, I succeeded without difficulty. But I would remark, that\r\nstocks from which swarms are caught in this way, must not be raised at\r\nthe back side, as a part of the swarm would issue there, and not get\r\ninto the net. Mr. Loucks had his hive directly on the board; and he\r\ntold me he kept them so through the season: the only places of entrance\r\nwas a sprout out of the bottom of the front side, about three inches\r\nwide by half inch deep, and a hole in the side a few inches up. You\r\nwill thus perceive that stocks from which swarms are hived in this way\r\nmust be prepared for it previously. Also, it will be no use to such\r\nbee-keepers as depend on seeing their swarms in the air. It will be\r\nbeneficial only in large apiaries, where several swarms are liable to\r\nissue at once; the swarming indications well understood, and the\r\napiarian on the lookout.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWARMS SOMETIMES RETURN.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a swarm will issue, and in a few minutes return to the old\r\nstock. Mr. Miner gives a cause for this, very ingenious, and romantic,\r\nbut unfortunately there are but few facts to sustain this hypothesis,\r\n(at least I have not discovered them.) There are other causes that\r\nappear to me more reasonable; the most common is the inability of the\r\nold queen to fly, on account of her burden of eggs, old age, or\r\nsomething else. I have sometimes, after the swarm had returned found\r\nthe queen near the stock, and put her back, and the next day she would\r\ncome out again, and fly without difficulty, (perhaps she had discharged\r\nsome of her eggs.)\r\n\r\nTheir returning is more frequent in windy weather, or when the sun is\r\npartially obscured by clouds. About three-fourths of them will not\r\nre-issue until a young queen is matured, eight or ten days afterwards;\r\nand a few, not at all. But when the queen returns with the swarm, they\r\nusually come out again the next day, or day after, and some not till\r\nthe third or fourth. I have known two instances where they issued again\r\nthe same day.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPETITION PREVENTED.\r\n\r\nSometimes a swarm will issue and return three or four days in\r\nsuccession, but this I generally remedy, as it is often owing to some\r\ninability of the queen, and she may be frequently found while the swarm\r\nis leaving outside the hive, unable to fly. In such cases it is only\r\nnecessary to have a tumbler ready, and watch for her; and as soon as\r\nshe appears, secure her, get the empty hive for the swarm, a sheet, and\r\nput down a bottom-board a few feet from the stock. The swarm is sure to\r\ncome back; the first bees that alight on the hive will set up the call;\r\nas soon as this is perceived, lose no time in setting the old stock on\r\nthe board, and throwing the sheet over it to keep out the bees. Put the\r\nnew one in its place on the stand, and the queen in it; in a few\r\nminutes the swarm will be in the _new_ hive, when it can be removed,\r\nand the old one replaced. This I have done many times. But should the\r\nswarm begin to cluster in a convenient place, when you have so caught\r\nthe queen, by being expeditious she may be put with the swarm, before\r\nthey have missed her and may be hived in the usual way.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIABILITY TO ENTER WRONG STOCKS.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, whether you set a new hive in place of the old one or\r\nnot, whenever a swarm returns, if other stocks stand close on each\r\nside, they are quite sure to receive a portion of the bees--probably a\r\nfew hundreds; these are certain to be massacred. To prevent which, it\r\nis necessary to throw sheets over them until the swarm has gathered on\r\ntheir own hive. This is another reason for plenty of room between\r\nstocks. Should no queen be discovered during their issue, or return,\r\nshe should be sought for in the vicinity of the hive, and put back if\r\nfound, and the swarm will be likely to issue several days earlier, than\r\nto wait for a young queen.\r\n\r\nWhen the old queen is actually lost, and the bees have returned to wait\r\nfor a young one, it is often ready to leave one or two days short of\r\nthe time required for second swarms. Whether a greater number of bees\r\nin the old stock creating more animal heat, matures the chrysalis in\r\nless time than a stock thinned by casting a swarm, or some other cause,\r\nI cannot say. I mention it because I have known it to occur frequently,\r\nbut not invariably. A swarm flying, unaccompanied by a queen, is\r\nscattered more than usual.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ISSUES GENERALLY CHOOSE FAIR WEATHER.\r\n\r\nFirst swarms are commonly more particular as to weather than after\r\nswarms. They have several days from which to choose, after these royal\r\ncells are ready, and before the queens are matured; and they usually\r\ntake a fair one. But here again are exceptions. I once had two first\r\nswarms issue in a wind that kept every branch of tree and bush in\r\nagitation to such a degree that it was impossible to find any such\r\nplace to cluster. I expected their return to the old hive; but here\r\nwere more exceptions. After repeating a fruitless attempt at the\r\nbranches, they gave it up, and came down amongst the grass on \"terra\r\nfirma.\" This occurred after several days of rainy weather. The next day\r\nbeing pleasant, twelve issued; almost proving that the wind the\r\npreceding day kept back a part. I also knew one to issue in a shower,\r\nthat beat many of them to the ground before they could cluster. In this\r\ncase the shower was sudden, the sun shone almost up to the time it\r\nbegan to rain. About this time the swarm started when it seemed they\r\nwere unwilling to turn about.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER SWARMS.\r\n\r\nAfter swarms are second and third issues (or all after the first) from\r\na stock; and quite a different affair from the first, as also are some\r\nfirst swarms, when the old queen has been lost, being led out by young\r\nqueens.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR SIZE.\r\n\r\nSecond swarms are usually half as large as the first, the third half as\r\nlarge as the second, the fourth still less; with some variations. I\r\ngive general features, noticing only the exceptions that occur most\r\nfrequently; others sometimes happen, but so seldom that mentioning them\r\nis deemed unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME AFTER THE FIRST.\r\n\r\nWhenever the first swarm in a prosperous season _was not kept back by\r\nfoul weather_, the first of the young queens in the old stock is ready\r\nto emerge in about eight days. We will suppose the first swarm issued\r\non Sunday; a week from the next Tuesday will be usually as soon as the\r\nsecond one need be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIPING OF THE QUEEN.\r\n\r\nOn the Monday evening previous, or on Tuesday morning, by putting your\r\near close to the hive, and listening attentively five minutes, you will\r\nhear a distinct piping noise, like the word _peep, peep_, uttered\r\nseveral times in succession, and then an interval of silence; two or\r\nmore may be often heard at the same time; that of one will be shrill\r\nand fine, of another hoarse, short and quick. This piping is easily\r\nheard by _any_ one not actually deaf, and not the least danger of its\r\nbeing taken for any humming; in fact, it is not to be mistaken for\r\nanything else _but piping_, even when you hear it for the first time.\r\nThese notes can probably never be heard except when the hive contains a\r\nplurality of queens.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY ALWAYS BE HEARD BEFORE AND AFTER SWARM.\r\n\r\nI _never failed to hear it_, previous to a second swarm, or any after\r\nthe first, whenever I listened; and whenever I have listened and not\r\nheard it at the proper time, I never knew a second swarm to issue!\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME OF CONTINUANCE VARIES.\r\n\r\nThe time of commencing will be later than this rule in some stocks, if\r\nthe weather is cool, or not many bees left; it may be ten or twelve\r\ndays. I once found it fourteen before I heard it. Also the swarm may\r\nnot issue in two or three days after you hear it. The longer the swarm\r\ndelays, the louder will be the piping; I have heard it distinctly\r\ntwenty feet, by listening attentively when I knew one was thus engaged;\r\nbut at first it is rather faint. By putting your ear against the hive\r\nit may be heard even in the middle of the day, or at any time before\r\nissuing. The length of time it may be heard beforehand seems to be\r\ngoverned again by the yield of honey; when abundant it is common for\r\nthem to issue the next day; but when somewhat scarce, they will be much\r\nlonger--very often three or four days. In these cases third swarms\r\nseldom occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME BETWEEN SECOND AND THIRD ISSUES.\r\n\r\nPiping for third swarms (when they issue) may usually be heard the\r\nevening after the second has left, though one day commonly intervenes\r\nbetween their issues.\r\n\r\nHere my experience is at variance with many writers, who give several\r\ndays between the second and third. I do not recollect an instance of\r\nmore than three days between, but many in less, several the next, and\r\none the same day of the second! I had an instance of a swarm losing its\r\nqueen (the old one) on its first sally, and returned to wait for the\r\nyoung ones; when they were ready, an uncommon number of bees were\r\npresent; three swarms issued in three days! On the fourth, another came\r\nout and returned; the fifth day it left; making four regular swarms in\r\nfive days. On the eighth, the fifth swarm left! Although I never had\r\nfive swarms from a stock before, yet I expected this, from the fact of\r\nhearing the piping on the next evening after the fourth one had left.\r\nThe piping had continued in this hive from the evening previous to the\r\nfirst swarm till the last one had left.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT ALWAYS TO BE DEPENDED UPON.\r\n\r\nOne stock in fifteen may commence piping, yet send out no swarm. The\r\nbees will change their minds about coming out, and kill their queens,\r\nor allow the eldest one of them to destroy the others, or some other\r\nway, as they do not always swarm in such circumstances. But when the\r\npiping continues over twenty-four hours, I never knew _but one\r\nfailure_! I have known a few (two or three) to commence this piping,\r\nwhile I supposed the old queen was yet present, and had not left the\r\nhive, on account of bad weather, but a swarm issued soon after. Also,\r\nthree instances where I supposed the old queen lost, from some other\r\ncause than leading out a swarm, and the stock reared some young ones to\r\nsupply her place. It occurred in or near the swarming season, and one\r\nor two issues was the consequence. One case was three weeks in advance\r\nof the season, and the swarm was about half the usual size. When a\r\nswarm has been out, and returned at the last of the swarming season, it\r\nis much more probable to re-issue, than if it depended on an old queen\r\nfor a leader, that had not been out. Such will sometimes be a week or\r\nten days later than others. Once I had the first swarm kept back by wet\r\nweather, and the second came out on the fifth day after; several other\r\ninstances on the seventh and eighth; and one as late as the sixteenth,\r\nafter the first.\r\n\r\n\r\nA RULE FOR THE TIME OF THESE ISSUES.\r\n\r\nThis may be put down as a rule, that all after swarms _must_ be out by\r\nthe eighteenth day from the first. I never found an exception, unless\r\nthe following may be considered so: When a swarm left the middle of\r\nMay, and another the first of July, seven weeks after, but two cases of\r\nthis kind have come up, and these I consider rather in the light of\r\nfirst swarms, as they leave under the same circumstances, leaving the\r\ncombs in the old stock filled with brood, queen-cells finished, &c. A\r\nstock may cast swarms in June, and a buckwheat swarm in August, on the\r\nsame principle.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN IT IS USELESS TO EXPECT MORE SWARMS.\r\n\r\nTherefore, bee-keepers having but few stocks, will find it unnecessary\r\nto watch their bees when the last of the first swarms came out sixteen\r\nor eighteen days before. Much trouble may be thus saved by\r\nunderstanding this matter. During my early days in beekeeping, I wished\r\nfor the greatest possible increase of stocks. I had some that had cast\r\nthe first swarm, and soon after clustered out again. I vainly watched\r\nthem for weeks and months, expecting another swarm. But had I\r\nunderstood the _modus operandi_, as the reader may now understand it, I\r\nshould have been through with all my anxiety, as well as watching, in a\r\nfortnight. As it was, it lasted two months. I found no one to give me\r\nany light on this subject, or even tell me when the swarming season was\r\nover, and I came very near watching all summer!\r\n\r\n\r\nPLURALITY OF QUEENS DESTROYED.\r\n\r\nWhen the bees, queens, or all together, decide that no more swarms are\r\nto issue, the plurality of queens is destroyed, and but one is left. It\r\nis probable that the oldest and strongest queen dispatches the others,\r\ngenerally while in the cells.\r\n\r\nI once had some artificial queens reared, as an experiment, from common\r\neggs, on the top of a hive, in a small glass box, where there was room\r\nfor but one comb, which allowed me to see all particulars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANNER.\r\n\r\nAfter the first queen was matured, and had left her cell, I caught her\r\nwithin six hours, taking advantage of her younger sisters, which were\r\nyet sealed up, and of course could offer no resistance. She first made\r\nan opening that would allow her to reach the abdomen of her competitor\r\n(probably this is the most vulnerable). As soon as this was\r\nsufficiently large to admit her body, she thrust it in, inflicting the\r\nfatal sting. This was then left for another, that soon shared the same\r\nfate. If quick and spiteful movements are any indications of hatred, it\r\nwas manifested here very plainly. The bees enlarged the orifice and\r\ndragged out the now dead queens.\r\n\r\nNow, if I should say that all queens were dispatched in this way,\r\nmerely because I witnessed it in this case, it would be carrying out\r\nthe principle I am endeavoring to avoid: that is, judging all cases\r\nfrom one or two solitary facts. As it is, it is somewhat confirmatory\r\nof what some others have said. I will suppose, then, until further\r\nevidence contradicts it, that the first perfect queen leaving her cell,\r\nmakes it her business to destroy all rivals in their cradle, as soon as\r\nit is decided that no more swarms shall issue. By keeping grass, weeds,\r\n&c., away from about the stock, these dead queens, as they are brought\r\nout, may be frequently found. Such as are removed during the night may\r\nbe often found on the floor-board in the morning. I have found a dozen\r\nby one stock. Should the stock send out but one swarm, they may be\r\nfound about the time, or a little before you would listen for the\r\npiping. But should after swarms come out, they will, or may be found\r\nthe next morning after it is decided that no more are to issue. It is\r\nvery seldom that all the queens reared are needed. They make it a rule,\r\nas far as they have control, to go on safe principles, by having a\r\nlittle more than just enough. When several such bodies are thrown out,\r\nand no piping is heard, no further swarming need be expected. But\r\nshould you hear the piping a day or two after finding a dead queen, you\r\nmay yet look for the swarm.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORY DOUBTED.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that when the bees decide an after swarm shall issue, the\r\nfirst queen matured is not allowed to leave her cell, but kept a\r\nprisoner there, and fed until wanted to go forth with the swarm. This\r\nmay be true in some cases (though not satisfactorily proved), but I am\r\nquite sure it is not in all.\r\n\r\nWhen she is confined to her cell, how does she ascertain the presence\r\nof others? By leaving the cell, this knowledge is easily obtained.\r\nHuber says she does, and is \"enraged at the existence of others, and\r\nendeavors to destroy them while yet in the cell, which the workers will\r\nnot allow; this is so irritating to her majesty that she utters this\r\npeculiar sound.\" Also second and third swarms may contain several\r\nqueens, frequently two, three, and four; even six at one time come out.\r\nIf these had to bite their way out, after the workers had decided it\r\nwas time to start (for it _must be they_ decide it when the queens are\r\nshut up), they would hardly be in season.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER SWARMS DIFFERENT IN APPEARANCE FROM THE FIRST WHEN ABOUT TO\r\nISSUE.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, when after swarms start, the appearance about the\r\nentrance is altogether different from first ones, unless there is an\r\nunusual number of bees. I have said that for a little time beforehand,\r\nthat such were in an apparent tumult, &c. But after swarms seldom give\r\nany such notice. One or more of the young queens may sometimes be seen\r\nto run out, and back, several times in a few minutes, in a perfect\r\nfrenzy; sometimes fly a short distance, and return before the swarm\r\nwill get started (which she could not do if confined). The workers seem\r\nmore reluctant about leaving than in first swarms, when a mother\r\ninstead of a sister is leader. Even after the swarm is in motion, she\r\nmay return and enter the hive a moment. No doubt she finds it necessary\r\nto animate or induce as many as possible to leave with her. A person\r\nwatching the issue of a second swarm under these circumstances, for the\r\nfirst time, and finding the queen leaving first, would very likely\r\n_guess_ all must be alike. Perhaps the next one would be different; the\r\nfirst thing seen might be the swarm leaving, and no queen discovered at\r\nall. But to return to the imprisonment of the queens. I have one other\r\nfact in objection. I once saw a queen running about in a glass hive,\r\nwhile they were piping for a second swarm. She was near the glass,\r\nappeared agitated, stopping occasionally to vibrate her wings, which\r\nwas simultaneous with the piping, and seemed to make it. The workers\r\nappeared to take but little notice of her. The next day the swarm left.\r\nHere was one instance, at least, of her not being confined till the\r\ntime of leaving, making an exception, if not a rule. Let this matter be\r\nas it may, I admit it makes but little difference to the practical\r\napiarian, either way; but to the reader whose interest is the natural\r\nhistory of the bee, the truth is important.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME OF DAY, WEATHER, ETC.\r\n\r\nThese after swarms are not very particular about the weather; heavy\r\nwinds, a few clouds, and sometimes a slight sprinkling of rain, will\r\nnot _always_ deter them. Neither are they very precise about the time\r\nof day. I have known them in a warm morning to issue before seven\r\no'clock, and after five P.M. These things should be understood;\r\nbecause, when after swarms are expected (of which the piping will give\r\nwarning), it is necessary to watch them in weather, and at times when\r\nfirst ones would not venture to leave.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWARMS NECESSARY TO BE SEEN.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that you see them, that you may know where they\r\ncluster, otherwise it might be difficult to find them. They are apt to\r\ngo farther from the parent stock than others; sometimes fifty rods, and\r\nthen settle in two places, perhaps that distance apart, in some high or\r\ninconvenient place to get at. (Let me not be misunderstood: I do not\r\nsay they all do so, or even the majority; but I wish to say that a\r\ngreater portion of these swarms do so than of the first.) If they\r\ncluster in two places, a queen may be in each, and they will remain,\r\nand when you have hived one part you may think you have all. If one\r\ncluster is without a queen, they will join the other if near; but when\r\ndistant, will be very likely to return to the old stock soon, unless\r\nput together. I had a swarm light in two places, in exactly opposite\r\ndirections from the stock. In one, a good swarm had clustered; in the\r\nother, some less than a pint. The small part had one or more queens,\r\nthe other none. It was perceived at once by their movements. Now, if we\r\nprovide a hive for a swarm, and get a few to set up the call or\r\nbuzzing, they will not leave till that is stopped. There is generally\r\nno difficulty to start it. The surest way is to jar a portion or all\r\ndirectly into the hive. It takes a few minutes to get composed, and\r\nmiss the queen. In my case I got them in the hive, and before they\r\nmissed the queen, carried them to the small cluster, which I got in a\r\ndipper and emptied in front of the hive; they entered, and all were\r\npeaceable. You will therefore see the necessity of watching such\r\nswarms, to see if there is no separation, if nothing else.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETURNING AFTER SWARMS TO THE OLD STOCK.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said about returning all after swarms to the old stock;\r\nthe advantages of which will depend on the time of issuing; whether\r\nlate or early, the yield of honey, etc. It would be unusual to have\r\nmany after swarms without a liberal yield of honey, for the time being;\r\nbut to tell of its continuance is the question to be answered. Second,\r\nand even third swarms, if early in the season, and the honey continues\r\nplentiful, may be hived, and these, together with the old stock, will\r\nprosper. Here the apiarian needs a little judgment and experience to\r\nguide him.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN THEY SHOULD BE RETURNED.\r\n\r\nIt is always best, if possible, to have good strong families. When\r\nafter swarms are late it is safest to return them, as the old stock\r\nwill need them to replenish the hive, and prepare for winter. Also a\r\nless number of worms will infest it, when well provided with bees; and\r\nthe chances of box honey are greater.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF DOING IT.\r\n\r\nBut the process of returning such requires some little patience and\r\nperseverance. I have said there may be a dozen young queens in the old\r\nstock. Now suppose one, two, or more leave with the swarm, and you\r\nreturn the whole together, there is nothing to prevent their leading\r\nout the swarm again the next day. Therefore it is policy to keep the\r\nqueens back. The least trouble is to hive in the usual way, and let\r\nthem stand till the next morning. It will save you the trouble of\r\nlooking for more than one, if there should be more, for all but that\r\nare destroyed by that time. There is a chance, also, for the old stock\r\nto decide that no more should issue, and allow all but one to be slain\r\nthere. When this is the case, and you find the one with the swarm, you\r\nwill have no further trouble by their re-issuing. They should be\r\nreturned as soon as the next morning, otherwise they might not agree,\r\neven when put in the old home. To return them, and find a queen easily,\r\nget a wide board a few feet long; let one end rest on the ground, the\r\nother near the entrance, that they may enter the hive without flying;\r\nthen shake out the swarm on the lower end of the board; but few will\r\nfly, but soon commence running up towards the hive; the first one that\r\ndiscovers the entrance will set up the call for the others. If they do\r\nnot discover it, which is the case sometimes, scatter some of them near\r\nit, and they will soon commence marching up, when you should look out\r\nfor, and secure the queen, as they spread and give a good chance. By\r\napplying your ear to the hive, the piping will tell you if they are to\r\nissue again. It is evident, if you follow these directions, that the\r\nswarm cannot issue many times before their stock of royalty will be\r\nexhausted; and when but one queen remains the piping will cease, and no\r\nfurther trouble will be had. To prevent these after swarms, some\r\nwriters recommend turning over the hive and cutting out all the royal\r\ncells but one. This I have found impracticable with a great many\r\nstocks. Some of the cells are too near the top to be seen, consequently\r\nthis cannot always be depended upon. As for a rule about returning, it\r\nis somewhat difficult to give one. If I should say, return all such as\r\nissue after the 20th of June, the variation in the season might be two\r\nor three weeks, even in the same latitude; i.e., the course of flowers\r\nthat had bloomed by that date in one season might, another year,\r\nrequire two weeks more to bring out. Also, the 20th of June, in\r\nlatitude of New York City, is as late as the 4th of July in many places\r\nfurther north. I once had a second swarm on the 11th of July, that\r\nwintered well, having nearly filled the hive. Yet, in some seasons, the\r\nfirst swarms, of the last of June, have failed to get enough. In\r\nsections where much buckwheat is raised, late swarms do more towards\r\nfilling their hives than where there is none.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE CARE NEEDED BY AFTER SWARMS WHEN HIVED.\r\n\r\nShould it be thought best to hive after swarms, and risk the chances,\r\nthey should receive a little extra attention after the first week or\r\ntwo, to destroy the worms; a little timely care may prevent\r\nconsiderable injury. They are apt to construct more combs in proportion\r\nto the number of bees, than others; consequently, such combs cannot be\r\nproperly covered and protected. The moth has an opportunity to deposit\r\nher eggs on them, and, sometimes, entirely destroy them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO MAY BE UNITED.\r\n\r\nWhenever these swarms issue near enough together, it is best to unite\r\nthem. I have said second swarms were generally half as large as the\r\nfirst. By this rule, two second swarms would contain as many bees as a\r\nfirst one, and four of the third, or one of the second issue, and two\r\nof the third, &c. If the first and second are of the ordinary size, I\r\nthink it advisable always to return the third. But in large apiaries it\r\nis common for them to issue without any previous warning, just when a\r\nfirst one is leaving, and crowd themselves into their company, and\r\nseeming to be as much at home as though they were equally respectable.\r\n\r\nWhenever the hives containing our swarms are full or very near it, the\r\nboxes should be put on without delay, unless the season of honey is so\r\nnearly gone as to make it unnecessary.\r\n\r\nI have found it an advantage to hive a few of these very small swarms,\r\non purpose to preserve queens, to supply some old stocks that sometimes\r\nlose their own at the extreme end of the swarming season. The cases to\r\nbe mentioned at the last of the next chapter. I try and save one for\r\nabout every twenty stocks that have swarmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nLOSS OF QUEENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF SWARMS THAT LOSE THEIR QUEEN.\r\n\r\nSwarms that lose their queen the first few hours after being hived,\r\ngenerally return to the parent stock; with the exception that they\r\nsometimes unite with some other. If much time has elapsed before the\r\nloss, they remain, unless standing on the same bench with another. On a\r\nseparate stand they continue their labor, but a large swarm diminishes\r\nrapidly, and seldom fills an ordinary-sized hive. One singular\r\ncircumstance attends a swarm that is constructing combs without a\r\nqueen. I have never seen it noticed by any one, and may not always be\r\nthe case, but _every_ instance that has come under my notice, I have so\r\nfound it. That is, four-fifths of the combs are drone-cells; why they\r\nthus construct them is another subject for speculation, from which I\r\nwill endeavor in this instance to refrain.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUGGESTION AND AN ANSWER.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested as a profitable speculation, \"to hive a large\r\nswarm without a queen, and give them a piece of brood-comb containing\r\neggs, to rear one, and then as soon as it is matured, deprive them of\r\nit, giving them another piece of comb, and continue it throughout the\r\nsummer, putting on boxes for surplus honey. The bees having no young\r\nbrood to consume any honey, no time will be lost, or taken to nurse\r\nthem, and as a consequence they will be enabled to store large\r\nquantities of surplus honey.\"\r\n\r\nThis appears very plausible, and to a person without experience\r\nsomewhat conclusive. If success depended on some animal whose lease of\r\nlife was a little longer, it would answer better to calculate in this\r\nway. But as a bee seldom sees the anniversary of its birthday, and most\r\nof them perish the first few months of their existence, it is bad\r\neconomy. It will be found that the largest amount of our surplus honey\r\nis obtained from our prolific stocks. Therefore it is all-important\r\nthat every swarm and stock has a queen to repair this constant loss.\r\n\r\n\r\nA DISPUTED QUESTION.\r\n\r\nWe now approach another disputed point in natural history, relative to\r\nthe queen leaving at any time except when leading out a swarm. Most\r\nwriters say that the young queen leaves the hive, and meets her\r\nparamour, the drone, on the wing. Others deny this _positively_, having\r\nwatched a whole summer without seeing her highness leave. Consequently\r\nthey have arrived at the very plausible and apparently consistent\r\nconclusion, that nature never intended it to be so, since it must\r\nhappen at a time when the existence of the whole family depends\r\nentirely on the life of the queen. The stock at such times contains no\r\neggs or larvæ, from which to rear another, if she should be lost. \"The\r\nchances at such times of being devoured by birds, blown away by the\r\nwinds, and other casualties, are too many, and it is not probable the\r\nCreator would have so arranged it.\" But facts are stubborn things; they\r\nwill not yield one jot to favor the most \"finely-spun hypothesis;\" they\r\nare most provokingly obstinate, many times. When man, without the\r\nnecessary observation, takes a survey through animated nature, and\r\nfinds with scarcely an exception that male and female are about equal\r\nin number, he is ready, and often does conclude that one bee among\r\nthousands cannot be the only one capable of reproduction or depositing\r\neggs. Why, the idea is preposterous! And yet only a little observation\r\nwill upset this very consistent and analogous reasoning. So it appears\r\nto be with the excursions of the young queens. I was compelled, though\r\nreluctantly, to admit that they leave the hive. That their purpose is\r\nto meet the drones, I cannot at present contradict. Also, that, when\r\nthe queen is once impregnated, it is operative for life, (yet it is\r\nanother anomaly), as I never detected her coming out again for that\r\npurpose. What then is the use of the ten thousand drones that never\r\nfulfil this important duty? It seems, indeed, like a useless waste of\r\nlabor and honey, for each stock to rear some twelve or fifteen hundred,\r\nwhen perhaps but one, sometimes not any of the whole number is of any\r\nuse. If the risk is great in the queen's leaving, we find it arranged\r\nadmirably in its not being too frequent.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MULTITUDE OF DRONES NEEDED.\r\n\r\nInstinct teaches the bee to make the matters left to them as nearly\r\n_sure_ as possible. When they want one queen, they raise half a dozen.\r\nIf one drone or only half a dozen were reared, the chances of the queen\r\nmeeting one in the air would be very much reduced. But when a thousand\r\nare in the air instead of one, the chances are a thousand times\r\nmultiplied. If a stock casts a swarm, there is a young queen to be\r\nimpregnated, and be got safely back, or the stock is lost. Every time\r\nshe leaves, there is a chance of her being lost, (one in fifteen). If\r\nthe number of drones was any less than it is, the queen would have to\r\nrepeat her excursions in proportion, before successful. As it is, some\r\nhave to leave several times. The chances and consequences are so great,\r\nthat on the whole no doubt but it is better to rear a thousand\r\nunnecessarily, than to lack one just in time of need. Therefore let us\r\nendeavor to be content with the present arrangement, inasmuch as we\r\ncould not better it, and probably had we been consulted, would have so\r\nfixed \"the thing, that it would not go at all.\"\r\n\r\nBut what is the use of the drones in hives that do not swarm, and do\r\nnot intend it, situated in a large room or very large hives? Such\r\ncircumstances seldom produce swarms, yet as regular as the return of\r\nsummer, a brood of drones appear. What are they for? Suppose the old\r\nqueen in such hive dies, leaving eggs or young larvæ, and a young queen\r\nis reared to supply her place. How is she to be impregnated without the\r\ndrones? Perhaps they are taught that whenever they can afford it, they\r\nshould have some on hand to be ready for an emergency. I have already\r\nsaid when bees are numerous, and honey abundant, they never fail to\r\nprovide them. I once put a swarm in a glass hive. The queen was a\r\ncripple, having lost one of her posterior legs; in two months after she\r\nwas replaced by one young and perfect. Here was an instance of drones\r\nbeing needed, when no intention of swarming was indicated; the hive was\r\nbut little more than half full.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN LIABLE TO BE LOST IN HER EXCURSIONS.\r\n\r\nThis excursion of the queen, whenever I have witnessed it, always took\r\nplace a little after the middle of the day, when the drones were out in\r\nthe greatest numbers. At such times I have seen them leave amid rather\r\nmore commotion than usual among the workers. I have watched their\r\nreturn, which varied from three minutes to half an hour, and seen them\r\nhover around their own hive, apparently in doubt whether they belonged\r\nin that, or the next; in a few instances they have actually settled on\r\nthe neighboring hive, and would have there perished, but for my\r\nassistance in putting them right.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TIME WHEN IT OCCURS.\r\n\r\nThus we see that queens are lost on these occasions from some cause,\r\nand part of them by entering the wrong hive, perhaps most of them; if\r\nso, it is another good reason for not packing stocks too close. The\r\nhives are very often nearly alike in color and appearance. The queen\r\ncoming out for the first time in her life, is no doubt confused by this\r\nsimilarity.\r\n\r\nThe number of such losses in a season has varied: one year the average\r\nwas one in nine, another it was one in thirteen, and another one in\r\ntwenty. The time from the first swarm also varies from twelve to twenty\r\ndays. The inexperienced reader should not forget that it is the old\r\nstocks which have cast swarms, where these accidents happen; the old\r\nqueen having left with the first swarm. Also all after swarms are\r\nliable to the same loss. I would suggest that these have abundant room\r\ngiven between the hives; if it is necessary to pack close, let it be\r\nthe first swarms, where the old queen has no occasion to leave. Having\r\nnever seen this matter fully discussed, I wish to be somewhat\r\nparticular, and flatter myself that I shall be able to direct the\r\ncareful apiarian how to save a few stocks and swarms annually, that is,\r\nif he keeps many. A few years ago, I wrote an article for the Albany\r\nCultivator. A subscriber of that paper told me a year afterwards that\r\nhe saved two stocks the next summer by the information; they were worth\r\nat least five dollars each, enough to pay for his paper ten years or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nWhen a stock casts but one swarm, the queen having no competitors to\r\ninterfere with her movements, will leave in about fourteen days, if the\r\nweather is fair; but should an after swarm leave, the oldest of the\r\nyoung queens will probably go with that, of course: then, it must be\r\nlater before the next is ready: it may be twenty days, or even more;\r\nthose with after swarms will vary from one to six. It _always must_\r\noccur when no eggs or larvæ exist, and no means left to repair this\r\nloss; a loss it is, and a serious one; the bees are in as much trouble\r\nas their owner, and a great deal more, they seeming to understand the\r\nconsequences, and he, if he knows nothing of the matter, has no\r\ntrouble. Should he now, for the first time, learn the nature of it, he\r\nwill at the same time understand the remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDICATIONS OF THE LOSS.\r\n\r\nThe next morning after a loss of this kind has occurred, and\r\noccasionally at evening, the bees may be seen running about in the\r\ngreatest consternation, outside, to and fro on the sides. Some will fly\r\noff a short distance and return; one will run to another, and then to\r\nanother, still in hopes, no doubt, of finding their lost sovereign! A\r\nneighboring hive close by, on the same bench, will probably receive a\r\nportion, which will seldom resist an accession under such\r\ncircumstances. All this will be going on while other hives are quiet.\r\nTowards the middle of the day, this confusion will be less marked; but\r\nthe next morning it will be exhibited again, though not so plainly, and\r\ncease after the third, when they become apparently reconciled to their\r\nfate.\r\n\r\nThey will continue their labors as usual, bringing in pollen and honey.\r\nHere I am obliged to differ with writers who tell us that all labor\r\nwill now cease. I hope the reader will not be deceived by supposing\r\nthat because the bees are bringing in pollen, that they _must_ have a\r\nqueen; I can assure you it is not always the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESULT.\r\n\r\nThe number of bees will gradually decrease, and be all gone by the\r\nearly part of winter, leaving a good supply of honey, and an extra\r\nquantity of bee-bread, as before mentioned, because there has been no\r\nyoung brood to consume it. This is the case when a large family was\r\nleft at the time of the loss. When but few bees are left, it is very\r\ndifferent; the combs are unprotected by a covering of bees; the moth\r\ndeposits her eggs on them, and the worms soon finish up the whole. Yet\r\nthe bees from the other stocks will generally first remove the honey.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGE OF BEES INDICATED.\r\n\r\nHundreds of bee-keepers lose some of their stocks in this way, and can\r\nassign no reasonable cause. \"Why,\" say they, \"there wasn't twenty bees\r\nin the hive; it was all full of honey,\" or worms, as the case may be.\r\n\"Only a short time before, it was full of bees; I got three good swarms\r\nfrom it, and it always had been first rate, but all at once the bees\r\nwere gone. I don't understand it!\" Such bee-keepers cannot understand\r\nhow rapidly a family of bees diminish, when there is no queen to\r\nreplenish with young this mortality of the old ones. I doubt whether\r\nthe largest and best family possibly could be made to exist six months,\r\nwithout a queen for their renewal, except, perhaps, through the winter.\r\n\r\nWhen standing close on one bench, they are gone sooner than if on\r\nseparate stands, as they often join a neighboring hive when they can\r\nwalk to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNECESSITY OF CARE.\r\n\r\nAs this tumult cannot be seen but a few days at most, it is well--yes,\r\nit is necessary--to make it a duty to glance at the hives at this\r\nperiod after swarming, _every morning_; a glance is sufficient to tell\r\nyou of the fact. Remember to reckon from the date of the first issue;\r\nthis occurs when the first royal cells are sealed over, and is the best\r\ncriterion as to when the queen will leave. If the first swarm issue and\r\nreturn, it can make no difference; reckon from their first issuing.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDY.\r\n\r\nWhen you discover a loss, first ascertain if there is any after swarm\r\nto be expected from another stock, (by listening for the piping); if\r\nso, wait till it issues, and obtain a queen from that for your stock;\r\neven if there is but one, take it, and let the bees return; they would\r\nbe likely to come out again the next day; if not, it is very often no\r\ngreat loss.\r\n\r\nShould no such swarm be indicated, go to a stock that has cast a first\r\nswarm within a week; smoke it and turn it over, as before directed,\r\nfind a royal cell, and with a broad knife cut it out, being careful not\r\nto injure it. This must now be secured in the other hive in its natural\r\nposition, the lower end free from any obstacle, that would interfere\r\nwith the queen leaving it. It will make but little difference whether\r\nat the top or bottom, providing it is secure from falling.\r\n\r\nI generally introduce it through a hole in the top, taking care to find\r\none that will allow the cell to pass down between two combs. It being\r\nlargest at the upper end, the combs each side will sustain it, and\r\nleave the lower end free. In a few hours the bees will secure it\r\npermanently to the combs with wax. This operation cannot be performed\r\nin a chamber hive, as it is impossible to see the arrangement of the\r\ncombs through the holes. To put it in at the bottom is some more\r\ntrouble; the difficulty is, to fasten it, and prevent it resting on the\r\nend. I have done it as follows: Get an _old_ thick piece of dry comb\r\nsome three inches square; cut out an inch of the middle. At right\r\nangles with this, in one edge in the centre, make another to intersect\r\nit, just the size of the cell, and have the lower end reach into the\r\nopening. This comb will keep it in the right position, and may rest on\r\nthe floor-board. It can now be put in the hive, cutting out a piece of\r\ncomb to make room for it if necessary.\r\n\r\nSoon after such cell is introduced, the bees are quiet. In a few days\r\nit hatches, and they have a queen as perfect as if it had been one of\r\ntheir own rearing. This queen of course will be necessitated to leave\r\nthe hive, and will be just as liable to be lost, but no more so than\r\nothers, and must be watched the same. It is unnecessary to look for a\r\ncell in a stock that has cast its first swarm more than a week before,\r\nas they are generally destroyed by that time, (sometimes short of it,)\r\nunless they intend to send out an after swarm.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARK THE DATE OF SWARMS ON THE HIVE.\r\n\r\nShould you have so many stocks that you cannot remember the date of\r\neach swarm without difficulty, it is a good plan to mark the date on\r\none side or corner of the hive, as it issues. You can then tell at once\r\nwhere to look for a cell when wanted.\r\n\r\nIt will sometimes happen that a queen may be lost at the extreme end of\r\nthe swarming season, when no other stock contains such cells. I then\r\nlook around for the poorest stock or swarm that I have on hand, one\r\nthat I can afford to sacrifice, if it possesses a queen, to save the\r\none that has sustained this loss; this is not often the case, but is\r\nsometimes. I have a few times put just bees enough with the queen to\r\nkeep her in a box, and kept them for this purpose, as was mentioned in\r\nthe last chapter. When introduced, the bees are generally killed, but\r\nthe queen is preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBTAINING A QUEEN FROM WORKER BROOD.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another method to be adopted, and that is, to obtain a\r\npiece of brood-comb containing workers' eggs, or larvæ very young. You\r\nwill generally find it without much trouble, in a young swarm that is\r\nmaking combs; the lower ends usually contain eggs; take a piece from\r\none of the middle sheets, two or three inches long, (you will probably\r\nuse smoke by this time without telling). Invert the hive that is to\r\nreceive it, put the piece edgewise between the combs, if you can spread\r\nthem apart enough for the purpose; they will hold it there, and then\r\nthere will be ample room to make the cells. They will nearly always\r\nrear several queens. I have counted nine several times, which were all\r\nthey had room for. But yet I have very little confidence in such\r\nqueens, they are almost certain to be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEY ARE POOR DEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\nTherefore I would recommend getting a royal cell whenever it is\r\npractical. There is yet another advantage; you will have a queen ready\r\nto lay eggs two or three weeks earlier, than when they are compelled to\r\ncommence with the egg. I have put such piece of brood-comb in a small\r\nglass box on the top of the hive instead of the bottom, because it was\r\nless trouble, but in this case the eggs were all removed in a short\r\ntime; whether a queen was reared in the hive or not I cannot say; but\r\nthis I know, I never obtained a prolific queen, after repeated\r\nexperiments in this way.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that I have been more unfortunate with queens reared in\r\nthis way, than most experimenters. I have no difficulty to get them\r\nformed to all appearance perfect, but lose them afterwards. Now whether\r\nthis arose from some lack of physical development, by taking grubs too\r\nfar advanced to make a perfect change, or whether they were reared so\r\nlate in the season, that most of the drones were destroyed, and the\r\nqueen to meet one had to repeat her excursions till lost, I am yet\r\nunable to _fully_ determine. To test the first of these questions, I\r\nhave a few times removed all the larvæ from the comb; leaving nothing\r\nbut eggs, that all the food given them might be \"royal pap,\" from the\r\ncommencement, and had no better success so far. Yet occasionally\r\nprolific queens have been reared when I could account for their origin\r\nin no other way but from worker eggs. But you will find they are not to\r\nbe depended upon generally.\r\n\r\nSometimes, after all our endeavors, a stock or two will remain\r\ndestitute of a queen. These, if they escape the worms, will generally\r\nstore honey enough in this section to winter a good family. This will\r\nhave to be introduced, of course, from another hive, containing a\r\nqueen; but this belongs to Fall management.\r\n\r\nAs respects the time that elapses from the impregnation of the queen\r\ntill the commencement of egg laying, I cannot tell, but guess it might\r\nbe about two or three days. I have driven out the bees twenty-one days\r\nafter the first swarm, when no second swarm had issued--the young queen\r\ncame out on the fourteenth day. I found eggs and some very young larvæ.\r\nWhen it is remembered that eggs remain three days before they hatch, it\r\nshows that the first of these must have been deposited some four or\r\nfive days. When writers tell us the exact time to an hour (46 or 48)\r\nfrom impregnation to laying, I am willing to admit the thing in this\r\ncase, but feel just as if I would like to ask how they managed to find\r\nout the fact; by what sign they knew when a queen returned from an\r\nexcursion, whether she had been successful or not, in her amours; or,\r\nwhether another effort would have to be made; and then, how they\r\nmanaged to know exactly when the first egg was laid.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a queen is lost at other than the swarming season,\r\naveraging about one in forty. It is most frequent in spring; at least\r\nit is generally discovered then. The queen may die in the winter, and\r\nthe bees not give us any indications till they come out in spring.\r\n(Occasionally they may all desert the hive, and join another.) If we\r\nexpect to ascertain when a queen is lost at this season, we must notice\r\nthem just before dark on the first warm days--because the mornings are\r\napt to be too cool for any bees to be outside--any unusual stir, or\r\ncommotion, similar to what has been described, shows the loss. This is\r\nthe worst time in the year to provide the remedy, unless there should\r\nhappen to be some very poor stock containing a queen, that we might\r\nlose any way--then it might be advisable to sacrifice it to save the\r\nother, especially if the last contained all the requisites of a good\r\nstock except a queen. Some eight or ten, that I have managed in this\r\nway, have given me full satisfaction. I have at other times let them go\r\ntill the swarming season, and then procured a queen, or introduced a\r\nsmall swarm; at which time they are so reduced as to be worth but\r\nlittle, even when not affected by the worms. To obviate this loss in\r\nthis way, it might be an advantage to transfer the bees to the next\r\nstock, if it was not too full already; or the bees of the next stock to\r\nthis. Let the age and condition of the combs, quantity of stores, &c.,\r\ndecide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL SWARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD.\r\n\r\nArtificial swarms can be made with safety at the proper season. To the\r\nbee-keeper who wishes to increase his stocks, it will be an advantage\r\nto understand some of the principles. I have had some little experience\r\nthat has led to different conclusions from those of some others. I have\r\nseen it stated, and found the assertion repeated by nearly every\r\nwriter, that \"whenever bees were deprived of their queen, if they only\r\npossessed eggs or young larvæ, they would not fail to rear another,\"\r\n&c. There are numerous instances of their doing this, but it is not to\r\nbe depended upon, especially when left in a hive full of combs, as the\r\nfollowing experiments tend to prove.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\nSeveral years since I had a few stocks well supplied with bees, and\r\nevery indication of swarming present, such as clustering out, &c., but\r\nthey pertinaciously adhered to the old stock, through the whole\r\nswarming season! Others apparently not as well supplied with bees threw\r\noff swarms. I had but few stocks, and was very anxious to increase the\r\nnumber; but these were provokingly indifferent to my wishes. Taking the\r\nassertions of these authors for facts, I reasoned thus: In all\r\nprobability there are eggs enough in each of those stocks. Why not\r\ndrive out a portion of the bees, with the old queen, and leave about as\r\nmany as if a swarm had issued? Those left will then raise a queen, and\r\ncontinue the old stock, and I shall have six instead of the three, that\r\nhave been so obstinate. Accordingly, I divided each, examined and found\r\neggs and larvæ. Of course all _must be right_. Now, thought I, my\r\nstocks can be doubled at least annually. If they do not swarm, I can\r\ndrive them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESULT UNSATISFACTORY.\r\n\r\nMy swarms prospered, the old stocks seemed industrious, bringing in\r\npollen in abundance, which to me at _that_ time, was conclusive that\r\nthey had a queen, or soon would have. I continued to watch them with\r\nmuch interest, but somehow, after a few weeks, there did not seem to be\r\nquite as many bees; a few days later, I was quite _sure_ there was not.\r\nI examined the combs, and behold there was not a cell containing a\r\nyoung bee of any age, not even an egg in any one of these old stocks.\r\nMy visionary anticipations of future success speedily retrograded about\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nI had, it is true, my new swarms in condition to winter, although not\r\nquite full; but the old ones were not, and nothing was gained. I had\r\nsome honey, a great deal of bee-bread and old black comb. Had I let\r\nthem alone, and put on boxes, I should have probably obtained\r\ntwenty-five or thirty pounds of pure honey from each, worth five times\r\nas much as what I did get; besides, the old stocks, even with the old\r\ncomb, would have been better supplied with both honey and bees;\r\naltogether much better, as stocks for wintering. Here was a\r\nconsiderable loss, merely by not understanding the matter.\r\n\r\nI carefully looked the bees over, and ascertained to a certainty that\r\nneither of them had a queen. I smothered what few there was left in the\r\nfall. I then knew of no better way. I had been told that the barbarous\r\nuse of fire and brimstone was part of the \"luck;\" that a more\r\nbenevolent system would cause the bees \"to run out,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to these experiments, I thought perhaps the jarring of the\r\nhives in driving might have some effect on the bees, and prevent their\r\nrearing a queen. This idea suggested the dividing hive, when the\r\ndivision could be made quietly; but success was yet uncertain. I was\r\ntold to confine the bees in the old stock twenty-four hours or more,\r\nafter driving out a swarm; this I tried, with no better results. Again,\r\nI drove out the swarm, looked out the queen, and returned her to the\r\nold stock, compelling the new swarm to raise one. To be certain they\r\ndid so, I constructed a small box about four inches square, by two in\r\nthickness; the sides glass. In this I put the piece of brood-comb\r\ncontaining eggs and larvæ, and then put it on the hive containing the\r\nswarm, having holes for communication, a cover to keep it dark, &c.\r\nThey were very sure to rear queens, but from some cause were lost after\r\nthey were matured.\r\n\r\nNow, if others have been more successful in these experiments than\r\nmyself, it indicates that some favorable circumstances attended them\r\nthat did not me. I have not the least doubt but the result will be\r\nfavorable sometimes. Yet from the foregoing, I became satisfied that\r\nnot one of these methods could be relied upon. Instead of constructing\r\na queen's cell, and then removing the egg or larva to it from another\r\ncell, I always found that the cell containing such egg or larva was\r\nchanged from the horizontal to the perpendicular; such cells as were in\r\nthe way below were cut off, probably using the material in forming one\r\nfor royalty, which, when finished, contains as much material as fifty\r\nor a hundred others.\r\n\r\nMy experiments did not end here. I can now make artificial swarms, and\r\nsucceed nine times in ten with the first effort, and the reader can as\r\neasily do the same. It must be in the swarming season, or as soon as\r\nthe first regular swarm issues. You want some finished royal cells that\r\nany stock having cast a swarm will furnish, (unless in rare instances,\r\nwhere they are too far up among the combs to be seen.)\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUCCESSFUL METHOD.\r\n\r\nWhen you are all ready, take a stock that can spare a swarm; if bees\r\nare on the outside, raise the hive on wedges, and drive them in with a\r\nlittle water, and disturb them gently with a stick. Now smoke and\r\ninvert it, setting the empty hive over. If the two hives are of one\r\nsize, and have been made by a workman, there will be no chance for the\r\nbees to escape, except the holes in the side; these you will stop; (no\r\nmatter about a sheet tied around it.) With a light hammer or stick,\r\nstrike the hive a few times lightly, and then let it remain five\r\nminutes. This is very essential, because most of the bees, if allowed\r\nthe opportunity, will fill themselves with honey after such\r\ndisturbance.\r\n\r\nAll regular swarms go forth so laden. A supply is necessary when bad\r\nweather follows soon after. It is also used in forming wax, a very\r\nnecessary article in a new hive. The amount of honey carried out of a\r\nstock by a good swarm, together with the weight of the bees (which is\r\nnot much), will vary from five to eight pounds.\r\n\r\nThis, allowing time for the bees to fill their sacks, and supplying the\r\nold stock with a royal cell, I believe is entirely original: the\r\nimportance of which the reader can judge.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF THIS METHOD.\r\n\r\nIt is very plain that a queen from such finished cell must be ready to\r\ndeposit eggs several days sooner than by any other method that we can\r\nadopt. It is also clear that if we have a dozen queens depositing eggs\r\nby the 10th of June, that our bees are increasing faster, on the whole,\r\nthan if but half that number are engaged in it for a month later. There\r\nis yet another advantage. The sooner a young queen can take the place\r\nof the old one in maternal duties, the less time will be lost in\r\nbreeding, the more bees there will be to defend the combs from the\r\nmoth, and the surest guaranty for surplus honey.\r\n\r\nWhen the bees have filled their sacks, proceed to drive them into the\r\nupper hive by striking the lower one rapidly from five to ten minutes.\r\nA loud humming will mark their first movement. When you think half or\r\ntwo-thirds are out, raise the hive and inspect progress. They are not\r\nat all disposed to sting in this stage of proceeding, even when they\r\nescape outside. If full of honey, they are seldom provoked to\r\nresentment. The only care will be not to crush too many that get\r\nbetween the edges of the hives. The loud buzzing is no sign of anger.\r\nIf your swarm is not large enough, continue to drive till it is. When\r\ndone, the new hive should be set on the stand of the old one. A few\r\nminutes will decide whether you have the queen with the swarm, as they\r\nremain quiet: otherwise uneasy, and run about, when it will be\r\nnecessary to drive again.\r\n\r\nIf both hives are one color, set the old one two feet in front; but if\r\nof different colors, a little more. I prefer this position to setting\r\nthe old stock on one side, even when there is room; yet it can make but\r\nlittle difference. Should you set it on one side, let the distance be\r\nless. When the old stock is taken much farther than this rule, all the\r\nbees that have marked the location (and all the old ones will have done\r\nso) will go back to the old stand, and none but young bees that have\r\nnever left home will remain. The same will be the case with the new\r\nswarm if moved off. It will not do to depend on the old queen keeping\r\nthem, as she does when they swarm out naturally. This has been my\r\nexperience. Try it, reader, and be satisfied, by putting either of the\r\nhives fifteen or twenty feet distant.\r\n\r\nBefore you turn over the old stock, look among the combs as far as\r\npossible for queens' cells; if any contain eggs or larvæ, you may\r\nsafely risk their rearing a queen; but otherwise wait till next\r\nmorning, or at least twenty-four hours, then go to a stock that has\r\ncast a swarm, and obtain a finished royal cell, as before directed, and\r\nintroduce it. You will have a queen here as soon as if it had been left\r\nin the original hive, and no risk of an after swarm, because there is\r\nbut one. But when there are young queens in the cells at the time of\r\ndriving, after swarms may issue. Should a queen-cell be introduced\r\nimmediately, it is more liable to be destroyed than after waiting\r\ntwenty-four hours; and then is not always safe. After it has had time\r\nto hatch, (which is about eight days after being sealed), cut it out,\r\nand examine it: if the lower end is open, it indicates that a perfect\r\nqueen has left it, and all is safe; but if it is mutilated or open at\r\nthe side, it is probable that the queen was destroyed before maturity,\r\nin which case, another cell will have to be given them.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL SWARMS ONLY SAFE NEAR THE SWARMING SEASON.\r\n\r\nBy what I have said about artificial swarms, it would appear that it is\r\nunsafe at any time but the swarming season; that is my opinion. It may\r\ndo a little in advance or a little after, providing royal cells can be\r\nhad. By feeding as directed, (in Chapter IX.) you may induce a stock to\r\nsend out a swarm some days in advance of the regular season, thereby\r\ngiving you a chance for these cells somewhat early.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETIMES HAZARDOUS.\r\n\r\nTo make such swarms at any time when the bees are destroying drones,\r\nwould be extremely hazardous, not only on account of the young queen\r\nbeing impregnated, but their massacre denotes a scarcity of honey.\r\nTherefore I would advise never to make swarms, or drive out bees at\r\nsuch periods, when it can be avoided, without spare honey is on hand to\r\nfeed them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OBJECTIONS.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued by some, and with much reason, that \"nature is the\r\nbest guide, and it is better to let the bees have their own way about\r\nswarming--if honey is abundant, and the stock is in condition to spare\r\na swarm, their own instincts will teach them to construct royal cells;\r\nif it fails before they are ready, and the royal brood is destroyed, it\r\nis because the existence of the swarm would be precarious, and it is\r\nbest not to issue.\" I will grant that in many instances it is better.\r\nThe chance is better for surplus honey; the stock is quite sure to be\r\nin condition to winter; and some judgment is required to tell when a\r\nstock can spare a swarm.\r\n\r\nBut yet, we are sometimes anxious to increase our stocks to the utmost\r\nthat safety will allow, and often have some that can spare a swarm as\r\nwell as not, but refuse to leave; perhaps commence preparations, and in\r\na few days abandon them. Now it is evident that as long as many\r\ncontinue such preparation, that honey is sufficiently abundant to put\r\nthe safety of the swarm beyond hazard; some stocks will swarm while\r\nthese others just as good, (that had abandoned it before) and have not\r\nnow begun again, to be in time before a partial failure of honey, and\r\nsome may not have commenced in season.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL SWARMS EQUALLY PROSPEROUS.\r\n\r\nI can see no difference in artificial or natural swarms of equal size,\r\nat the same time. By taking the matter in time into our own hands, with\r\nthe rules given, we make a sure thing of it, that is, we are sure to\r\nget the swarms, when if left to the bees it would be uncertain, and no\r\ngreater risk afterwards than with natural issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS MATTER TOO OFTEN DELAYED.\r\n\r\nI am aware that this matter will be apt to be put off too long; \"wait\r\nand see if they don't swarm,\" will be the motto of too many, and when\r\nthe season is over, drive them. Perhaps a good swarm has set outside\r\nthe hive, all through the best of the honey season, and done nothing,\r\nwhile they could have half filled a hive; but this is all lost now, as\r\nwell as the best chances for getting cells. Let me impress the\r\nnecessity of doing it in season, when it will pay. If you intend to\r\nhave a swarm from every stock that can spare one, begin when nature\r\npoints out the proper time, which is, when the regular ones begin to\r\nissue. It must, indeed, be a poor season when there are none.\r\n\r\n\r\nIS THE AGE OF THE QUEEN IMPORTANT?\r\n\r\nThere is another object effected in this way, considered by some\r\napiarians as very important. It is the change of the queens in the old\r\nstock. A young queen is thought to be \"much more prolific than an old\r\none.\" They even recommend keeping none \"over two or three years old,\"\r\nand give directions how they may be renewed. But as I have been unable\r\nto discover any difference in relation to the age in this respect, I\r\nshall not at present take much time to discuss it. It is well enough,\r\nwhen we can take our choice without trouble, to preserve a young queen.\r\nWhen we consider that there are but few queens but what will deposit\r\nthree times as many eggs in a season as are matured, it looks as if it\r\nwould hardly pay to take much trouble to change them.  At what time the\r\nqueen becomes barren from old age, I presume has never yet been fully\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine has had a stock in a large room eight years, that has\r\nnever swarmed, and is still prosperous! I think it very probable that\r\nthis queen will gradually decay, and possibly become barren, some weeks\r\nbefore she dies; if so, this stock will soon die off. A few such cases\r\nwill probably occur in swarming hives, perhaps one in fifty, but\r\ngenerally such old and feeble queens are lost when they leave with the\r\nswarm, especially in windy weather. As long as they are able to go with\r\nthe swarm, and sometimes when they are not, I have found them\r\nsufficiently prolific for all purposes. I would rather risk their\r\nfecundity, and hive the swarm, than to allow the bees to return to the\r\nparent stock, and wait eight or nine days for a young queen to mature.\r\nA great many will remain idle, even if there is room to work in the\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPRUNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding I have given the method of pruning in the chapter on\r\nhives, (page 23, Chapter II.) it will be necessary to give the tyro in\r\nbee-culture a few more particulars. The season for doing it is of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT OPINIONS AS TO TIME.\r\n\r\nThe month of March has been recommended by several; others prefer\r\nApril, August, or September. Here, as usual, I shall have to differ\r\nfrom them all, preferring still another period, for which I offer my\r\nreasons, supposing, of course, that the reader is conscious of a\r\nfreeman's privilege, that is, to adopt whatever method he thinks\r\nproper, on this, as on any other point.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER TIME PREFERRED.\r\n\r\nThere is but one period from February till October, when prosperous\r\nstocks are free from young brood in the combs. If combs are taken out\r\nwhen occupied, there must be a loss of all the young bees they contain;\r\nwhich may be avoided. The old queen leaves with the first swarm; all\r\nthe eggs she leaves in the worker-cells will be matured in about\r\ntwenty-one days, consequently this is the time to clear out the old\r\ncombs with the least waste. A few drones will be found in the cells,\r\nthat would require a few days more to hatch, but these are of no\r\naccount. Also a few very young larvæ and some eggs may be sometimes\r\nfound, the product of the young queen; these few must be wasted, but as\r\nthe bees have expended no labor upon them as yet, it is better to\r\nsacrifice these than the greater number left by her mother, which have\r\nconsumed their portion of food; the bees have sealed them up, and now\r\nonly require the necessary time to mature, to make a valuable addition\r\nto the stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOULD NOT BE DELAYED.\r\n\r\nShould this operation be put off for a time much longer than three\r\nweeks, the young queen will so fill the combs again as to make it a\r\nserious loss. Therefore, I wish to urge strongly attention to this\r\npoint at the proper season. If you think it unimportant to mark the\r\ndate of your first swarms for the purposes mentioned in another place,\r\nit will be found very convenient here, for those that need pruning.\r\n\r\nIt is also recommended by some, to take only a part, say one-third or\r\nhalf, in a season; thereby taking two or three years to renew the\r\ncombs. This is advisable only when the family is very small. As this\r\nspace made by pruning cannot be filled without wax and labor, our\r\nsurplus honey will be proportionate to its extent. Now suppose we take\r\nout half the old combs, and get half a yield of box honey this year,\r\nand the same next, or make a full operation of it and get none this\r\nyear, and a full one next. What is the difference? There is none in\r\npoint of honey, but some in trouble, and that is in favor of a full\r\noperation at once. We have to go through with about the same trouble to\r\nget one-third or half as to take the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTION TO PRUNING.\r\n\r\nThe objection to this mode of renewing combs generally, will be the\r\nfear of getting stung. But I can assure you there is but little danger,\r\nnot as much as to walk among the hives in a warm day. Only begin right,\r\nuse the smoke, and work carefully, without pinching them, and you will\r\nescape unhurt generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCKS PRUNED NOW ARE BETTER FOR WINTER.\r\n\r\nBesides the advantage of saving a large brood by pruning at this\r\nseason, such stocks will usually refill before fall, and are much\r\nbetter for wintering, which is not the case when it is done later. We\r\nmust of necessity then waste the brood, and have a large space\r\nunoccupied with combs through the winter. But few combs can then be\r\nmade, and those few must be at the expense of their winter stores,\r\nunless we resort to feeding.\r\n\r\nThese objections apply with greater force to pruning in March or April.\r\nThe loss of brood is of much more consequence now, than in mid-summer,\r\nor even later, and a space to be filled with combs is a serious\r\ndisadvantage. It is important that the bees should devote their whole\r\nattention now to rearing brood, and be ready to cast their swarms as\r\nearly as possible. One _early_ swarm is worth two late ones. Suppose a\r\nstock, instead of collecting food and nursing its young, is compelled\r\nto expend its honey and labor in secreting wax and constructing combs\r\nbefore it can proceed with breeding advantageously, it _must of\r\nnecessity_ be some weeks later.\r\n\r\nFurther, I have always found it best to have the bees out of the way,\r\nduring this operation. It will be found much more difficult to drive\r\nthe bees out of a hive in the cool weather of March or April, than in\r\nsummer, as they seem unwilling to shift their warm quarters and go into\r\na cold hive.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed the reader will bear in mind the disadvantages already\r\ngiven of too frequently renewing combs; the little value of combs for\r\nstoring honey, _for our use_, after being once used for breeding; the\r\nnecessity of the bees using them as long as they possibly will answer;\r\nand not compel them to be filling the hive, when they might be storing\r\nhoney of the purest quality in boxes, &c.\r\n\r\nVide remarks on this subject on page 22, Chapter II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nDISEASED BROOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, like many other chapters in this work, is probably new, as I,\r\nnever saw one thus headed. A few newspaper discussions are about all\r\nthat have yet appeared on this subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD.\r\n\r\nThis disease is probably of recent origin. Mr. Miner, it appears, knew\r\nnothing of it until he moved from Long Island to Oneida County, in this\r\nState. Mr. Weeks, in a communication to the N.E. Farmer, says, \"Since\r\nthe potato rot commenced, I have lost one-fourth of my stocks annually,\r\nby this disease;\" at the same time adds his fears, that \"this race of\r\ninsects will become extinct from this cause, if not arrested.\" (Perhaps\r\nI ought to mention, that he speaks of it as attacking the \"chrysalis\"\r\ninstead of the larva; but as every thing else about it agrees exactly,\r\nthere is but little, doubt of its being all one thing.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMY OWN EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\nMy first experience will probably go back to a date beyond many others;\r\nit is almost twenty years since the first case was noticed. I had kept\r\nbees but four or five years when I discovered it in one of my best\r\nstocks; in fact, it was No. 1 in May and first of June. It cast no\r\nswarm through the summer; and now, instead of being crowded with bees,\r\nit contained but very few; so few, that I dared not attempt to winter\r\nit. What was the matter? I had then never dreamed of ascertaining the\r\ncondition of a stock while there were bees in the way, but was like the\r\nunskilful physician who is obliged to wait for the death of his\r\npatient, that he may dissect and discover the cause. I accordingly\r\nconsigned what few bees there were to the \"brimstone pit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nA \"_post mortem_\" examination revealed the following circumstances:\r\nNine-tenths of the breeding-cells were found to contain young bees in\r\nthe larva state, stretched out at full length, sealed over, dead,\r\nblack, putrid, and emitting a disagreeable stench. Now here was one\r\nlink in the chain of cause and effect. I learned why there was a\r\nscarcity of bees in the hive. What should have constituted their\r\nincrease, had died in the cells; none of them were removed,\r\nconsequently but few cells, where any bees could be matured, were left.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSE UNCERTAIN.\r\n\r\nBut when I attempted the next link in the chain (to wit) What caused\r\nthe death of this brood just at this stage of development? I was\r\nobliged to stop. Not the least satisfaction could be obtained. All\r\ninquiries among the bee-keepers of my acquaintance were met with\r\nprofound ignorance. They had \"never heard of it!\" No work on bees that\r\nI consulted ever mentioned it.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, I had more stocks in the same situation. I found,\r\nwhenever the disease existed to any extent, that the few bees matured\r\nwere insufficient to replace those that were lost; that the colony\r\nrapidly declined, and _never afterwards cast a swarm_!\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDIAL EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\nAs for remedies, I tried pruning out all those combs containing brood,\r\nleaving only such as contained honey, and let the bees construct new\r\nfor breeding. It was \"no use,\" these new combs were invariably filled\r\nwith diseased brood! The only thing effectual was to drive out the\r\nbees, into an empty hive. In this way, when done in season, I generally\r\nsucceeded in rearing a healthy stock. But here was a loss of all\r\nsurplus honey, and a swarm or two that might have been obtained from a\r\nhealthy one.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC INQUIRY AND ANSWERS.\r\n\r\nI had so many cases of the kind, that I became somewhat alarmed, and\r\nmade inquiry through the Cultivator, (an agricultural paper,) as to a\r\ncause, and remedy, offering a \"reward for one that would not fail when\r\nthoroughly tested,\" &c. Mr. Weeks, in answer, said, \"that cold weather\r\nin spring chilling the brood was the cause.\" (This was several years\r\nprior to his article in the N.E. Farmer.) Another gentleman said, \"dead\r\nbees and filth that accumulated during winter, when suffered to remain\r\nin the spring, was the cause.\" A few years after, another correspondent\r\nappeared in the Cultivator, giving particulars of his experience,\r\nproving very conclusively to himself and many others, that cold was the\r\ncause. Having mislaid the paper containing his article, I will endeavor\r\nto quote correctly from memory. He had \"three swarms issue in one day;\r\nthe weather during the day changed from very hot to the other extreme,\r\nproducing frost in many places the next morning. These swarms had left\r\nbut few bees in the old stocks, and the cold forced them up among the\r\ncombs for mutual warmth; the brood near the bottom, thus left without\r\nbees to protect it with animal heat, became chilled, and the\r\nconsequence was diseased larvæ.\" He then reasoned thus: \"If the eggs of\r\na fowl, at any time near the end of incubation, become chilled from any\r\ncause, it stops all further development. Bees are developed by\r\ncontinued heat, on the same principle, and a chill produces the same\r\neffect, &c.; afterwards, other swarms issued under precisely similar\r\ncircumstances; but these old stocks were covered with a blanket through\r\nthe night, which enabled the bees to keep at the bottom of the hive. In\r\na few days, enough were hatched to render this trouble unnecessary.\r\nThese last remained healthy.\" He further says, that \"last spring was\r\nthe first time I ever knew them to become diseased before swarming had\r\nthinned the population. The weather was remarkably pleasant through\r\nApril. The bees obtained great quantities of pollen and honey, and by\r\nthis means extended their brood further than usual at this season.\r\nSubsequent chilly weather in May, caused the bees to desert a portion\r\nof brood, which were destroyed by the chill.\"\r\n\r\nNow this is reasoning from cause to effect very consistently.\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWERS NOT SATISFACTORY.\r\n\r\nHad I no experience further than this, I should, perhaps, rest\r\nsatisfied as to the cause, and should endeavor to apply the remedy.\r\nSeveral other writers have appeared in different papers, on this\r\nsubject, and nearly all who assign a cause have given this one as the\r\nmost probable. Now I have known the chrysalis in a few stocks to be\r\nchilled and destroyed by a sudden turn of cold weather, yet these were\r\nremoved by the bees soon after, and the stocks remained healthy. To me\r\nthe cause assigned appears inadequate to produce _all_ the results with\r\nthe larvæ. After close, patient observation of fifteen years, I have\r\nnever yet been wholly satisfied that any one instance among my bees,\r\nwas thus produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CAUSE SUGGESTED.\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar to some extent with the contagious diseases of the\r\nhuman family, such as small-pox, whooping-cough, and measles, and their\r\nrapid spread from a given point, &c. We must also admit that some cause\r\nor causes, adequate to the effect, must have produced the first case.\r\nTo contagion, then, I would attribute the spread of this disease of our\r\nbees, at least nineteen cases in twenty. I will admit, if you please,\r\nthat one stock in twenty or fifty may be somewhat affected by a chill\r\nto a small extent. It is only a portion of the brood that is in\r\ndanger--only such as have been sealed over, and before they have\r\nprogressed to the chrysalis state, are attacked. How many then can\r\nthere be in a hive at any one time, in just the right stage of\r\ndevelopment to receive the fatal chill? Of course there will be some;\r\nbut they should be confined to the cells near the bottom, where the\r\nbees had left them exposed. These should be all; and these few would\r\nnever seriously damage the stock. Why then does this disease, when\r\nthoroughly started, spread so rapidly throughout all the combs in the\r\nhive? Will it be said that the chill is repeated every few days through\r\nthe summer? Or will it be admitted that something else may continue it?\r\n\r\nI think there must be other causes, besides the chill, even to start\r\nit, in most cases. As our practice will be in accordance with the view\r\nwe take of this matter, and the result of our course will be somewhat\r\nimportant, I will give some of the reasons that have led to this\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR THE OPINION.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I had all the bees of a good swarm leave the hive in\r\nMarch; after flying a time, they united with another good stock, making\r\ndouble the usual number of bees at this season; enough to keep the\r\nbrood sufficiently warm at any time; if other stocks with half or a\r\nquarter of the number could. By the middle of June, the bees were much\r\nreduced, and had not cast a swarm. It was examined, and the brood was\r\nfound badly diseased. My best and most populous stocks, in spring, are\r\njust as liable, and I might add more so, than smaller or weaker\r\nfamilies. I have had two large swarms unite, and were hived together,\r\nthat were diseased the next autumn. These cases prove strongly, if not\r\nconclusively, that animal heat is not the only requisite. The fact that\r\nwhen I had pruned out all affected comb from a diseased stock, and left\r\nhoney in the top and outside pieces, and the bees constructed new for\r\nbreeding, and the brood in such were invariably affected, though only a\r\nfew at first, and increasing as the combs were extended; led me to\r\nsuppose that it was a contagious disease, and the virus was contained\r\nin the honey. Some of it had been left in these stocks, and very\r\nprobably the bees had fed it to the brood. To test this principle still\r\nfurther, I drove all the bees from such diseased stocks, strained the\r\nhoney, and fed it to several young healthy swarms soon after being\r\nhived. When examined a few weeks after, every one, without an\r\nexception, had caught the contagion.\r\n\r\nHere then is a clue to the cause of this disease spreading, whether we\r\nhave its origin or not. We will now see if we can trace it through, if\r\nthere is any consistency in its transfer from one stock to another.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF ITS SPREADING.\r\n\r\nSuppose one stock has caught the infection, but a small portion of the\r\nbrood is dead. In the heat of the hive, it soon becomes putrid; other\r\ncells adjoining with larvæ of the right age are soon in the same\r\ncondition. All the breeding combs in the hive become one putrid mass,\r\nwith an exception, perhaps, of one in ten, twenty or a hundred, that\r\nmay perfect a bee. Thus the increase of bees is not enough to replace\r\nthe old ones that are continually dying off. It is plain, therefore,\r\nthat this stock _must_ soon dwindle down to a very small family. Now\r\nlet a scarcity of honey occur in the fields, this poor stock cannot be\r\nproperly guarded, and is easily plundered of its contents by the\r\nothers. Honey is taken that is in close proximity to dead bodies,\r\ncorrupting by thousands, creating a pestilential vapor, of which it has\r\nprobably absorbed a portion. The seeds of destruction are by this means\r\ncarried into healthy stocks. In a short time, these in turn fall\r\nvictims to the scourge; and soon dwindle away, when some other strong\r\nstock is able to carry off _their_ stores; and only stop, perhaps, at\r\nthe last stock! The moth is ever ready with her burden of eggs, which\r\nshe now without hindrance deposits directly on the combs. In a short\r\ntime the worms finish up the whole business, and are judged guilty of\r\nthe whole charge; merely because they are found carrying out effects\r\nthat speedily follow such causes.\r\n\r\nLet the reader who doubts this theory, simply strain out honey,\r\nvitiated in this way, and feed it to a few stocks or swarms, that are\r\nhealthy; and if they escape, communicate the fact to the public. But\r\nshould he become satisfied that such honey is poison to his bees, he\r\nwill with me, and all others interested, wish to stop this growing\r\nevil.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT EASILY DETECTED AT FIRST.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to detect the first hundred or two that die in a\r\nstock. But when nine-tenths of the breeding cells hold putrid larvæ,\r\nthere is but very little trouble in making out a correct diagnosis. The\r\nbees are few and inactive. When passing the hive our olfactories are\r\nsaluted with a nauseous effluvia, arising from this corrupting mass.\r\nNow, if we wish, or expect to escape, the most severe penalty, our\r\nneglect must never allow this extent of progression before such a stock\r\nis removed. Therefore, we must watch symptoms--ascertain the presence\r\nof the disease _at the earliest moment possible_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS TO BE OBSERVED.\r\n\r\nAs no part of the breeding season is exempt, the stocks should be\r\ncarefully observed during spring, and fore part of summer, relative to\r\nincrease of bees. When one or more is much behind others in this\r\nrespect, make an examination immediately. (I would here urge again the\r\nconvenience of the simple, common hive, over those more complicated, or\r\nsuspended, and difficult to turn over. In one case we might make an\r\nexamination in season; in the other, too much trouble and difficulty\r\nmight cause it to be put off too long.) The hive must be inverted, and\r\nthe bees smoked out of the way. Our attention is to be directed to the\r\nbreeding cells; with a sharp-pointed knife, proceed to cut off the ends\r\nof some of them that appear to be the oldest; bearing in mind that\r\nyoung bees are always white, until some time after they take the\r\nchrysalis state. Therefore, if a larva is found of a dark color, it is\r\ndead! Should a dozen such be found, the stock should be condemned at\r\nonce, and all the bees driven into an empty hive. (The directions for\r\nthis have been given, see page 31.) If honey should be scarce, at the\r\ntime, they should be fed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCALDING THE HONEY TO DESTROY THE POISON FOR FEEDING.\r\n\r\nThe honey from the old hive may be used, if you will only first destroy\r\nthe virus. This, I have ascertained, may be done by scalding: add a\r\nhalf-pint of water to about ten lbs.; stir it well, and heat it to the\r\nboiling point, and carefully remove all the scum.\r\n\r\nStocks in which the disease has not progressed too far, will generally\r\nswarm.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN TO EXAMINE STOCKS THAT HAVE SWARMED.\r\n\r\nThree weeks from the first swarm, will be the time to examine them. I\r\nmake it a rule to inspect all my stocks at this period. It is easily\r\ndone now, as about all the healthy brood (except drones) should be\r\nmatured in that time. By perseverance in these rules, I allow no stocks\r\nto dwindle away until they are plundered by others. If all my neighbors\r\nwere equally careful, this disease would probably soon disappear. This\r\nis like one careless farmer allowing a noxious weed to mature seeds, to\r\nbe wafted by winds on the lands of a careful neighbor, who must fortify\r\nhis mind to continual vigilance, or endure the injury of a foul pest.\r\nSo with the successful apiarian; in sections where the disease has\r\nappeared (it has not in all), he must be continually on the watch; it\r\nis the price of success.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE IN SELECTING STOCK HIVES FOR WINTER.\r\n\r\nAgain, after the breeding season is over, in the fall, _every stock\r\nshould be thoroughly inspected, and all diseased ones condemned for\r\nstock hives_. It is better to do it, even if it should take the last\r\none. It would pay much better to procure others instead, that are\r\nhealthy.\r\n\r\nPersons wishing to eat the honey from such hives, will experience no\r\nbad effects from it, if they are careful to remove all the dead brood,\r\nas they take it out of the hive.\r\n\r\nThe greatest distance that I ever knew bees to go, and plunder a\r\ndefenceless stock of its contents, was three-fourths of a mile. Very\r\nlikely they would go farther on some occasions, but not often.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCUSATIONS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT.\r\n\r\nCareless bee-keepers, when their hives are thus robbed, feel regret, or\r\nare more often vexed at somebody--at the result of their carelessness.\r\nThe person, keeping most bees in a neighborhood, must expect to be\r\naccountable for all effects of their ignorance, mismanagement, or\r\ncarelessness, and consequent \"bad luck;\" when all the honey thus\r\nobtained, probably carries with it more mischief than can be eradicated\r\nin a twelvemonth, thereby giving the real cause of complaint to the\r\nother party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nIRRITABILITY OF BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeeping bees good-natured, offers a pretty fair subject for ridicule:\r\nit seems rather too absurd to teach _a bee_ anything! Nevertheless, it\r\nis worth while to think of it a little. Most of us know that by\r\ninjudicious training, horses, cattle, dogs, &c., may be rendered\r\nextremely vicious. If there is no perceptible analogy between these and\r\nbees, experience proves that they may be made ten times more irritable\r\nthan they naturally would be.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR MEANS OF DEFENCE.\r\n\r\nNature has armed them with means to defend their stores, and provided\r\nthem with combativeness sufficient to use them when necessary. This\r\ncould not be bettered. If they were powerless to repel an enemy, there\r\nare a thousand lazy depredators, man not excepted, who would prey upon\r\nthe fruits of their industry, leaving them to starve. Had it been so\r\narranged, this industrious insect would probably have long since been\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME OF GREATEST IRRITABILITY.\r\n\r\nThe season of their greatest caution, in this section, is August,\r\nduring the flowers of buckwheat. It is then their stores are greatest.\r\nAs soon as a stock is pretty well supplied with this world's goods,\r\nlike some bipeds, they become very haughty, proud, aristocratic, and\r\ninsolent. A great many things are construed into insults, that in their\r\ndays of adversity would pass unnoticed; but now it is becoming and\r\nproper for their honor to show a \"just resentment.\" It behooves us,\r\ntherefore, to ascertain what are considered insults.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPER CONDUCT.\r\n\r\nFirst, all quick motions, such as running, striking, &c., about them,\r\nare noticed. If our movements among them are slow, cautious, humble,\r\nand respectful, we are often let to pass unmolested, having manifested\r\na becoming deportment. Yet the exhalations from some persons appear\r\nvery offensive, as they attack them much sooner than others; though I\r\napprehend there is not so great a difference as many suppose. Whenever\r\nan attack is made, and a sting follows, the venom thus imparted to the\r\nair, if by only one, is perceived by others at some distance, which\r\nwill immediately approach the scene, and more stings are likely to\r\nfollow than if the first had not been.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO PROCEED WHEN ATTACKED.\r\n\r\nStriking them down renders them ten times more furious. Not in the\r\nleast daunted, they return to the attack. Not the least show of fear is\r\nperceived. Even after losing their sting, they obstinately refuse to\r\ndesist. It is much the best way to walk as quietly as possible to the\r\nshelter of some bush, or to the house. They will seldom go inside of\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\r\nA PERSON'S BREATH OFFENSIVE, AND OTHER CAUSES.\r\n\r\nThe breath of a person inside the hive, or among them, when clustered\r\noutside, is considered in the tribunals of their insect wisdom as the\r\ngreatest indignity. A sudden jar, sometimes made by carelessly turning\r\nup the hive, is another. After being once thoroughly irritated in this\r\nway, they remember it for weeks, and are continually on the alert; the\r\nmoment the hive is touched, they are ready to salute a person's face.\r\nWhen slides of tin or zinc are used to cut off the communication\r\nbetween the hives and boxes, some of the bees are apt to be crushed or\r\ncut in two. This they remember, and retaliate, as occasion offers; and\r\nit may be when quietly walking in the apiary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR MANNER OF ATTACK.\r\n\r\nI must disagree with any one who says we always have warning before\r\nbeing stung. I have been stung _a few times_ myself. Two-thirds of them\r\nwere received without the least notice--the first intimation was the\r\n\"blow.\" At other times, when fully determined on vengeance, I have had\r\nthem strike my hat and remain a moment endeavoring to effect their\r\nobject. In this case, I have warning to hold down my face to protect it\r\nfrom the next attempt, which is quite sure to follow. As they fly\r\nhorizontally, the face held in that position is not so liable to be\r\nattacked. When they are not so thoroughly charged with anger, they\r\noften approach in merely a threatening attitude, buzzing around very\r\nprovokingly for several minutes in close proximity to our ears and\r\nface, apparently to ascertain our intentions. If nothing hostile or\r\ndispleasing is perceived, they will generally leave; but should a quick\r\nmotion or offensive breath offend them, the dreaded result is almost\r\nsure to follow. Too many people are apt to take these threatening\r\nmanifestations as positive intentions to sting. When these things can\r\nbe quietly endured, and at the same time leave their vicinity, it\r\ngenerally ends peaceably. They never make an attack while away from\r\ntheir home in quest of honey, or on their return, until they have\r\nentered the hive. It is only in the hive and its vicinity that we\r\nexpect to meet this irascible temperament, which should not be allowed,\r\nor at least may be subdued in a great measure, if not entirely, by\r\ndoing things in a quiet manner, and, by the use of tobacco smoke. Any\r\nperson having the care of bees should go armed with this powerful\r\nweapon. As bees are not much affected with smoke, while flying in the\r\nair, but will have their own way, we must take them in the hive as the\r\nplace to teach _them_ a proper deportment!\r\n\r\nThose who are accustomed to smoking will find a pipe or segar very\r\nconvenient here. But such as are not would do better, perhaps, not to\r\nlearn a bad habit. I will therefore give a simple substitute.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOKER DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\nGet a tube of tin about five-eighths of an inch diameter, five or six\r\ninches in length; make stoppers of wood to fit both ends, two and a\r\nhalf or three inches long; with your nail-gimlet make a hole through\r\nthem lengthwise: when put together it should be about ten inches. The\r\nends may be tapered. On one end leave a notch, that it may be held with\r\nthe teeth, which is the most convenient way, as you will often want to\r\nuse both hands: it is also always ready, without any trouble to blow\r\nthrough, and also to keep the tobacco burning. When ready to operate,\r\nfill the tube with tobacco, ignite it, and put in the stoppers; by\r\nblowing through it you keep the tobacco burning while the smoke issues\r\nat the other end.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF TOBACCO SMOKE.\r\n\r\nWe can now subdue these combative propensities, or render them\r\nharmless; turn their anger to submission, and make them yield their\r\ntreasures to the hands of the spoiler without an effort of resistance!\r\nWhen once overpowered, they seem to lose all knowledge of their\r\nstrength, and no slave can be more submissive! After the effects of the\r\nsmoke have passed off, their former animosity will return. Should any\r\nresentment be shown on raising a hive, blow in the smoke; they\r\nimmediately retreat, \"begging pardon.\" After a few times, they learn\r\n\"it's no use,\" and allow an inspection. If you wish to take off a box,\r\nraise it just enough to blow under the smoke; there is no trouble; you\r\ncan replace it with another; the bees are kept out of the way with a\r\nlittle more smoke, _and no anger created about it to be remembered_.\r\nThose in the box are all submission; they can be carried away and\r\nhandled as you please, without a possibility of getting them irritated,\r\nuntil they once more get home, and then are much more \"amiable\" than if\r\nthe box had been taken without the smoke. They seem to forget, or do\r\nnot realize anything of the transaction. When bees are to be\r\ntransferred to a new hive, it is unnecessary to be so very particular\r\nabout the escape of a single bee; no fears need be entertained of such\r\nas get out. In driving, the loud humming indicates their submission;\r\nthe upper hive can then be safely raised at any time. After being thus\r\ndriven out, they may be pushed about with impunity, and still be quiet!\r\nIn short, by using smoke on all occasions where they would be likely to\r\nbe disturbed without it by our meddling with them, it has a tendency to\r\nkeep dormant their combative propensities. When these have never been\r\naroused, there is much less danger from their attacks while walking or\r\nlooking among them. Any one wishing further proof, I would recommend\r\nthe experiment of managing one year with smoke, and the next without.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTING DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\nTheir sting, as it appears to the naked eye, is but a tiny instrument\r\nof war; so small, indeed, that its wound would pass unheeded by all the\r\nlarger animals, if it was not for the poison introduced at the same\r\ninstant. It has been described as being \"composed of three parts, a\r\nsheath and two darts. Both the darts are furnished with small points or\r\nbarbs like a fishhook,\" that hold it when introduced into the flesh;\r\nthe bee being compelled to leave it behind.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOES ITS LOSS PROVE FATAL?\r\n\r\nIt is said \"to the bee itself this mutilation proves fatal.\" This last\r\nis another assertion for fact, so often repeated, that perhaps we might\r\nas well admit it; seeing the difficulty we should have in disproving\r\nit. Only think of the impossibility of keeping our eye, for five\r\nminutes, on a bee that is flying about, after it has left its sting.\r\nYet there are some persons so very particular about what they receive\r\nas facts, that they would require this very unreasonable thing of\r\nwatching a bee till it died, before they could be _positively sure_\r\nthat the loss of its sting caused its death. (It is much easier to\r\nguess.) They might even take analogy, and say that other insects\r\npossess so little sensation that they have been known to recover after\r\nmuch more extensive mutilation--that beetles have lived for months\r\nunder circumstances that would have instantly killed some of the higher\r\nanimals--that spiders often reproduce a leg, even lobsters can replace\r\na lost claw, &c. I have put off describing any protection against their\r\nattacks, because I wish to get up a little more courage in our doings\r\namong them. Yet it is folly to expect all will manage successfully\r\nwithout something for defence.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS OF PROTECTION.\r\n\r\nThe face and hands are most exposed; for the latter, thick woollen\r\nmittens or gloves are best; the sting is generally left when thrust\r\ninto a leather glove. For the face procure one and a half yards of thin\r\nmuslin or calico, sew the ends together, the upper end gathered on a\r\nstring small enough to prevent it slipping over the head when put on.\r\nAn arm-hole is to be cut out on each side; below is another string to\r\ngather it close to the body. As I do not expect you to work in the\r\ndark, we will have a place cut out in front, and a piece of coarse lace\r\ninserted; that which will just prevent a bee from passing, is best, as\r\nit gives us a better chance to see. To keep it from falling against the\r\nface, a wire is bent around and sewed fast. Any person that knows how\r\nto put on a shirt will manage this. When thus equipped, and other\r\ngarments of proper thickness, the most timid ought not to hesitate to\r\nventure among them, when necessary. I cannot avoid cautioning you again\r\nto beware of irritating your bees, until this protection is necessary,\r\nas it is a rather bad state of things. With this on, you cannot\r\nconveniently use any smoke. To put this on and off is considerable\r\ntrouble, and every time you go among them, if you have to resort to\r\nthis, I fear some necessary duties will be neglected. Whenever a\r\npartial protection will do, I would recommend a handkerchief; it is\r\nalways at hand, and can be put on in a moment; throw it over the head,\r\nletting the ends fall around the neck and shoulders, covering all but\r\nthe face. The hat can come on over it. As for the face, whenever a bee\r\ncomes around in a menacing attitude, hold it down--unless he stings at\r\nthe first onset, there is not much risk.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDIES FOR STINGS.\r\n\r\nConcerning the remedies for stings, it is a hard matter to tell which\r\nis the best. There is so much difference in the effect in different\r\nindividuals, and the different parts of the body, as well as the depth\r\nthe sting reaches, that a great variety of remedies are recommended.\r\n\r\nA person is slightly stung, and applies something as an antidote; the\r\neffect of the sting is trifling, as perhaps it would have been without\r\nanything, and the medicine is forthwith extolled as a sovereign remedy.\r\nI have been thus deceived; when slightly stung applied what I thought\r\ncured in one case, when in the next the sting might have penetrated\r\ndeeper, or in some other place, and the remedy would seem to have no\r\neffect. For the last few years, I have not made any application\r\nwhatever for myself, and the effect is no worse, nor even as bad as\r\nformerly. (This, I am told, is because the system is hardened, and now\r\ncan resist or throw off the effects.) Among the remedies recommended,\r\nare saleratus and water, salt and water, soft-soap mixed with salt, a\r\nraw onion cut in two and one-half applied, mud or clay mixed pretty wet\r\nand changed often, tobacco wet and rubbed thoroughly to get at the\r\nstrength, and cold water constantly applied. To cure the smart, the\r\napplication of tobacco is strongly urged, and cold water is spoken of\r\nwith equal favor to prevent the swelling.\r\n\r\nWhen stung in the throat, drinking often of salt and water is said will\r\nprevent serious consequences.\r\n\r\nWhether any of these remedies are applied or not, I suppose it is\r\nunnecessary to say that the sting should be pulled out as soon as\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nENEMIES OF BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the enemies of bees, there are included rats, mice, birds, toads,\r\nand insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nARE THEY ALL GUILTY?\r\n\r\nBut some of these are probably clear of any actual mischief. I strongly\r\nsuspect that the spirit of destructiveness with many people is\r\naltogether too active. There are some farmers, with this principle\r\npredominant, so short-sighted, that if it was in their power they would\r\ndestroy a whole class of birds, because some of them had picked a few\r\ncherries, or dug out a few hills of corn, when, at the same time, they\r\nare indebted to their activity in devouring worms, insects, &c., that\r\nwould otherwise have destroyed entire crops! It will be well,\r\ntherefore, before condemnation, to see if on the whole we are to be\r\ngainers or losers by an indiscriminate slaughter, without judge or\r\njury.\r\n\r\n\r\nRATS AND MICE.\r\n\r\nRats and mice are never troublesome, except in cold weather. The\r\nentrances of all hives standing out are too small to admit a rat. It is\r\nonly when in the house that much damage need be apprehended. They\r\nappear to be fond of honey, and when it is accessible will eat several\r\npounds in a short time.\r\n\r\nMice will often enter the hive when standing on the bench, and make\r\nextensive depredations. Sometimes, after eating a space in the combs,\r\nthey will there make their nest. The animal heat created by the bees\r\nwill make a snug, warm place for winter quarters. There are two kinds:\r\none the common class, belonging to the house; the other called\r\n\"deer-mouse\"--the under side perfectly white, the back much lighter\r\nthan the other kind. The latter seems to be particularly fond of the\r\nbees, while the first appears to relish the honey. Whether they take\r\nbees that are alive, or only such as are already dead, I cannot say.\r\nOnly a part of the bee is eaten; and if we take the fragments left to\r\njudge of the number consumed, the circumstance will go some ways to\r\nprove the sacrifice of quite a number. Whether bees or honey is wasted,\r\na little care to prevent their depredations is well worthy of bestowal.\r\nAs rats and mice have so long since been condemned and sentenced for\r\nbeing a universal plague, and without a redeeming trait, I will say\r\nnothing in their favor, and am perfectly willing they shall be hanged\r\ntill dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nARE ALL THE BIRDS GUILTY?\r\n\r\nBut for some of the birds accused of preying upon bees, I would say a\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING-BIRD--ONE WORD IN HIS FAVOR.\r\n\r\nThe king-bird stands at the head of the list of depredators! With a\r\nfair trial he will be found guilty, though not so heinously criminal as\r\nmany suppose. I think we shall find him guilty of taking only the\r\ndrones. In the afternoon of a fair day he may be seen perched upon some\r\ndry branch of a shrub or tree near the apiary, watching for his\r\nvictims, occasionally darting to seize them. I have shot him down and\r\nexamined his crop, after seeing him devour a goodly number; but in\r\nevery instance the bees were so crushed to pieces, that it was\r\nimpossible to distinguish workers from drones. We are told of great\r\nnumbers of workers being counted. It may be so, or it may be thus\r\nrepresented by a spice of prejudice. I have found the brutal\r\ngratification of taking life so strong with some, that a natural\r\nantipathy is allowed to take the place of justice, and a proper defence\r\nis not allowed in such cases where the suffering party has not the\r\npower to enforce it. If he was satisfied with workers as well as\r\ndrones, why does he not visit the apiary long before noon, and fill his\r\ncrop with them? But instead, he waits till afternoon for the drones;\r\nand if none are flying, he watches quietly till one appears, although\r\nworkers may be out by hundreds continually. If the question is asked,\r\nhow they tell the difference in the two kinds of bees, I might suggest\r\nthat _instinct_ has taught most animals the proper kind of food, and\r\nmight direct the birds in this case. If it was not sufficient, a little\r\nexperience in catching bees provided with stings, might impart the\r\nimportant difference, in one or two lessons. I once had a chicken that\r\nknew the difference by some means, and would stand by the hive and\r\ndevour every drone, the moment it touched the board, while the workers\r\nwould pass by him in scores untouched!\r\n\r\nNow, whether this taking the drones is a disadvantage or otherwise,\r\nwould depend entirely upon circumstances. If honey was a little scarce,\r\nthe less we had of them the better; it would also save the bees some\r\ntrouble in dispatching them. It is probably a matter of so little\r\nmoment to our bees, that it will not pay for powder to shoot them.\r\n\r\nMartins, and a kind of swallows, are said to be guilty of taking bees\r\non some occasions; but as they pursue them on the wing (if they do),\r\nthe same remarks will apply as to the king-bird.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAT-BIRD ACQUITTED.\r\n\r\nThe cat-bird also comes in for a share of censure. It is said \"they\r\nwill get right down by the hive, and pick up bees by the hundred.\" Yet,\r\nright in the face of this charge, I am disposed to acquit him. With the\r\nclosest observation, I find him about the hive, picking up _only_ young\r\nand immature bees, such as are removed from the combs and thrown out.\r\nThey may be seen as soon as the first rays of light make objects\r\nvisible about the apiary, looking for their morning supply, as well as\r\nfrequent visits during the day. Should an unlucky worm be in sight just\r\nthen, while looking up a place for spinning a cocoon, or a moth\r\nreposing on some corner of the hive, their fate is at once decided.\r\nBefore destroying this bird, it would be well to judge by actual\r\nobservation as to facts; otherwise we might \"destroy a friend instead\r\nof a foe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAD GOT CLEAR.\r\n\r\nA toad is discovered near the hives, and forthwith he is executed as a\r\nbee-eater. \"He ought to be killed for his looks, if nothing else!\" He\r\nis thus often sacrificed _really_ on account of his appearance, while\r\npretending he is a villain. It is true his \"feathers\" will not vie in\r\nbrilliancy with the plumage of the humming-bird, and do not gratify\r\nideality--therefore he is dispatched. The next week the complaint is\r\nmade that the little bugs, that he might have destroyed, \"have eaten up\r\nall the little cucumbers and cabbages.\" His food is probably small\r\ninsects. Whoever has seen him swallow bees, must have watched closer\r\nthan I ever did.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASPS AND HORNETS NOT FAVORED.\r\n\r\nAs for the frequent visits of the black-wasp in the sunny days of\r\nspring, but little can be said in their favor--they seem to have no\r\nother object but to tease and irritate the bees. I never could discover\r\nthat they entered the hive for the purpose of plunder. They have\r\nfrequent battles with the bees, but I never saw any bees devoured or\r\ncarried off, nor even killed. After the first of June they are seldom\r\ntroublesome. The yellow wasp or hornet, that is around in autumn, is of\r\nbut little account; their object is honey, which they take when they\r\ncan get it, but are not apt to enter the hive among the bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTS--A WORD IN THEIR FAVOR.\r\n\r\nAnts come in for a share of condemnation. This little industrious\r\ninsect shall have my endeavors for a fair hearing; I think I can\r\nunderstand why they are so frequently accused of robbing bees. Many\r\nbee-keepers are wholly ignorant, most of the time, of the real\r\ncondition of their stocks. Many causes independent of ants, induce a\r\nreduction of population. Suppose the bees are so reduced as to leave\r\nthe combs unprotected, and the ants enter and appropriate some of the\r\nhoney to themselves, and should the owner come along just then and see\r\nthem engaged, \"Ha! you are the rascals that have destroyed my bees,\"\r\nwithout a thought of looking for causes, beyond present appearances.\r\nThey are often unjustly accused by the farmer of injuring the growth of\r\nhis little trees, by causing the tender leaves to curl and wither.\r\nInquiries are often made in some of the agricultural papers for means\r\nto destroy them, merely because they are found on them; when the real\r\ncause of the mischief is with the plant louse, (aphis) that is upon the\r\nleaves or stalk in hundreds, robbing them of their important juices,\r\nand secreting a fluid greatly prized by the ants. By destroying the\r\nlice, you remove all the attraction of the ants. The peculiar habits of\r\nthe small black ants, probably give rise to a suspicion of mischief in\r\nthis way. They live in communities of thousands--their nests are\r\nusually in old walls, in old timber, under stones, and in the earth.\r\nFrom their nests a string may be traced sometimes for rods, going\r\nafter, and returning laden with food. During a spell of wet weather,\r\nsuch as would make the earth and many other places too damp and cold\r\nfor a nest, they look out for better quarters. The top or chamber of\r\nour bee-hives affords shelter from rain. The animal heat from the bees\r\nrenders it perfectly comfortable. How then can we blame them for\r\nchoosing such a location, so completely answering all their wants? As\r\nlong as the bees are not disturbed, we can put up with it better. But\r\nthe careless observer having discovered their train to and fro from\r\ntheir nest on the hive, exclaims: \"Why, I have seen them going in a\r\ncontinual stream to the hive after honey;\" when a little scrutiny into\r\nthe matter would show that only the nest was on the top of the hive,\r\nand they were going somewhere else for food; not one to be seen\r\nentering the hive among the bees for honey, (at least I never could\r\ndetect it.)\r\n\r\nWhen honey is unprotected by bees, or boxes of it placed where they can\r\nhave access, as a natural consequence, they will carry off some; but it\r\nis easily secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIDER CONDEMNED.\r\n\r\nSpiders are a source of considerable annoyance to the apiarian, as well\r\nas to the bees; not so much on account of the number of bees consumed,\r\nas their habit of spinning a web about the hive, that will occasionally\r\ntake a moth, and will probably entangle fifty bees the whilst. They are\r\neither in fear of the bees, or they are not relished as food;\r\nparticularly, as a bee caught in the morning is frequently untouched\r\nduring the day. This web is often exactly before the entrance,\r\nentangling the bees as they go out and return; irritating and hindering\r\nthem considerably. They often escape after repeated struggles. I have\r\nremoved a web from the same place every morning, for a week, that was\r\nrenewed at night with astonishing perseverance! I can generally look\r\nout his hiding-place, which is in some corner near by, and dispatch\r\nhim. His redeeming qualities are few, and are more than balanced by the\r\nevil, as far as I have discovered. Their sagacity in some instances\r\nwill find a place of concealment not easily discovered. At the approach\r\nof cold weather, the box or chamber of the hive being a little warmer\r\nthan other places, will attract a great many there to deposit their\r\neggs. Little piles of webbing or silk may be seen attached to the top\r\nof the hive, or sides of boxes. These contain eggs for the next year's\r\nbrood. This is the time to destroy them and save trouble for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIf we combine into one phalanx all the depredators yet named, and\r\ncompare their ability for mischief with the wax moth, we shall find\r\ntheir powers of destruction but a small item! Of the moth itself we\r\nwould have nothing to fear were it not for her progeny, that consist of\r\na hundred or a thousand vile worms, whose food is principally wax or\r\ncomb.\r\n\r\nAs the instinct of the flesh-fly directs her to a putrid carcass to\r\ndeposit her eggs, that her offspring may have their proper food, so the\r\nmoth seeks the hive containing combs, and where its natural food is at\r\nhand to furnish a supply. During the day a rusty brown miller, with its\r\nwings wrapped close around the body, may be often seen lying perfectly\r\nmotionless on the side of the hive on one corner, or the under edge of\r\nthe top, where it projects over--they are more frequent at the corners\r\nthan anywhere else, one-third of their length projecting beyond it;\r\nappearing much like a sliver on the edge of a board that is somewhat\r\nweather-beaten. Their color so closely resembles old wood, that I have\r\nno doubt their enemies are often deceived, and let them escape with\r\ntheir lives. As soon as daylight shuts out the view, and no danger of\r\ntheir movements being discovered by their enemies, they throw off their\r\ninactivity, and commence searching for a place to deposit their eggs,\r\nand woe to the stock that has not bees sufficient to drive them from\r\nthe comb. Although their larvæ has a skin that the bee cannot pierce\r\nwith its sting, in most cases, it is not so with the moth, and of this\r\nfact they seem to be aware, for whenever a bee approaches they dart\r\naway with speed ten times greater than that of any bee, disposed to\r\nfollow! They enter the hive and dodge out in a moment, having either\r\nencountered a bee, or fear they may do so. Now it needs no argument to\r\nprove that when all our stocks are well protected, that it must be a\r\npoor chance to deposit eggs, on the combs of such hives, where their\r\ninstinct has taught them is the proper place. But they _must_ leave\r\nthem somewhere. When driven from all the combs within, the next best\r\nplace is the cracks and flaws about the hive, that are lined with\r\npropolis; and the dust and chips that fall on the floor-board of a\r\nyoung swarm not full will be used. This last material is mostly wax,\r\nand answers very well instead of comb. The eggs will here hatch and the\r\nworms sometimes ascend to the combs; hence the necessity of keeping the\r\nbottom brushed off clean. It will prevent those that are on the bottom\r\nfrom going up; also the bees from taking up any eggs, if this should\r\nhappen to be the method. I can conceive of no other way by which they\r\nget among the combs of a populous stock; where they are often detected,\r\nhaving been deposited by some means. A worm lodged in the comb, makes\r\nhis way to the centre, and then eats a passage as he proceeds, lining\r\nit with a shroud of silk, gradually enlarging it, as he increases in\r\nsize. (When combs are filled with honey, they work on the surface,\r\neating only the sealing.) In very weak families this silken passageway\r\nis left untouched,--but removed by all the stronger ones. I have found\r\nit asserted that \"the worms would be all immediately destroyed by the\r\nbees, were it not for a kind of dread in touching them until compelled\r\nto by necessity.\" As the facts which led to this conclusion are not\r\ngiven, and I can find none confirming it, perhaps I shall be excused if\r\nI have no faith. On the contrary, I find to all appearance an\r\ninstinctive antipathy to all such intruders, and are removed\r\nimmediately when possessing the power.\r\n\r\nWhen a worm is in a comb filled with brood, its passage being in the\r\ncentre, it is not at first discovered. The bees, to get it out, must\r\nbite away half the thickness, removing the brood in one or two rows of\r\ncells, sometimes for several inches. This will account for so many\r\nimmature bees found on the bottom board at morning, in the spring; as\r\nwell as in stocks and swarms but partially protected after the swarming\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDICATIONS OF THEIR PRESENCE.\r\n\r\nSometimes a half dozen young bees, nearly mature, will be removed\r\nalive, all webbed together, fastened by legs, wings, &c. All their\r\nefforts for breaking loose prove unavailing. Also others that are\r\nseparate may be seen running about with their wings mutilated, or part\r\nof their legs eaten off, or tied together! These generally are the\r\nfirst symptoms of worms in our stock at this season. Although\r\nunfavorable, it might be worse. It shows that the bees are not\r\ndiscouraged yet,--that when finding the worms present, have sufficient\r\nenergy left to make an effort to rid themselves of the nuisance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT.\r\n\r\nShould the apiarian now give them a little assistance for a few days,\r\nthey will soon be in a prosperous condition. The hive should be\r\nfrequently raised, and everything brushed out clean. If it is a new\r\nswarm half full, that presents these indications, it should be turned\r\nover a few times, perhaps once a week, till the worms are mastered; and\r\nthe corners below the bees examined for the cocoons, that will very\r\noften be found there, and are easily detached and destroyed. In turning\r\nover a hive part full, in warm weather, you should first observe the\r\nposition of the combs, and let the edges rest against the side of the\r\nhive, otherwise they might bend over and break loose when the hive was\r\nagain set up, (by simply making a pencil mark across the top in the\r\ndirection of the combs, you may know any time after first looking).\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE IN TURNING OVER HIVES.\r\n\r\nWhen a hive is full of combs, the edges are usually attached sufficient\r\nto steady them, and it is of less consequence which way it is turned,\r\nyet in very warm weather the honey will run out of drone cells if\r\nperpendicular.\r\n\r\nIn _very_ small swarms, hundreds of the young brood may be frequently\r\nseen with their heads out of the cells, endeavoring to escape, but are\r\nfirmly held inside by these webs. I have known a few instances in such\r\ncircumstances, where it appeared as if the bees had cut off the whole\r\nsheet of comb and let it drop, thereby ridding themselves of all\r\nfurther trouble (or would be rid of it, if their owner only did his\r\npart by taking out what fell down.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER SYMPTOMS OF WORMS.\r\n\r\nBut when the bees make no effort to dislodge the enemy or his works in\r\nold stocks, the case is somewhat desperate! Instead of the foregoing\r\nsymptoms we must look for something entirely different. But few young\r\nbees will be found. In their place we may find the fæces of the worms\r\ndropped on the board. During winter and spring the bees, in biting off\r\nthe covering of cells to get at the honey, drop chips closely\r\nresembling it. To detect the difference and distinguish one from the\r\nother requires a little close inspection. The color of the fæces varies\r\nwith the comb on which they feed, from white to brown and black. The\r\nsize of these grains will be in proportion to the worm--from a mere\r\nspeck to nearly as large as a pin-head: shape cylindrical, with obtuse\r\nends: length about twice its diameter. By the quantity we can judge of\r\nthe number. If the hive is full of combs the lower ends may appear\r\nperfect, while the middle or upper part is sometimes a mat of webs!\r\n\r\nWhenever our stocks have become reduced from over-swarming or other\r\ncause, this is the next effect in succession that we must expect. Here\r\nis another important reason that we know the _actual_ condition of our\r\nbees at all times; we can then detect the worms very soon after they\r\ncommence. In some instances we might save the stock by breaking out\r\nmost of the combs, leaving just enough to be covered by the bees. When\r\nsuccess attends this operation, it _must_ be done before the worms have\r\nprogressed to a thorough lodgment. When the stock is weak, and\r\nappearances indicate the presence of many, it is generally the safest,\r\nand will be the least trouble in the end, to drive out the bees at once\r\nand secure the honey and wax. The bees when put into a new hive _may_\r\ndo a little, but if they should do nothing, it would be no worse. It\r\ncannot be as bad any way as to have left them in the old hive till the\r\nworms had destroyed all and matured a thousand or two moths in addition\r\nto those otherwise produced, thereby multiplying the chances of damage\r\nto other stocks a thousand-fold. It is probably remembered that I said\r\nwhen bees are removed from a hive in warm weather, if it was not\r\ninfested with worms at the time, it soon would be, unless smoked with\r\nsulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN THEY GROW LARGER THAN USUAL.\r\n\r\nIn a hive thus left without bees to interfere, the worms will increase\r\nto one-half or two-thirds larger than where their right to the combs is\r\ndisputed. In one case they often have their growth, and actually wind\r\nup in their cocoon when less than an inch in length: in the other they\r\nwill quietly fatten till they are an inch and a half long and as large\r\nas a pipe-stem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME OF GROWTH.\r\n\r\nWhen first hatched from the egg, it requires very close inspection to\r\nsee them with the naked eye. The rapidity of growth depends on the\r\ntemperature in which they are, as much or more than their good living.\r\nA few days in hot weather might develop the full-grown worm, while in a\r\nlower temperature it would require weeks and even months in some cases,\r\nperhaps from fall till spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME OF TRANSFORMATION.\r\n\r\nThe worm, after spinning its cocoon, soon changes to a chrysalis, and\r\nremains inactive for several days, when it makes an opening in one end\r\nand crawls out. The time taken for this transformation is also governed\r\nby the temperature, although I think but few ever pass the winter in\r\nthis state. It is a rare thing to find a moth before the end of May,\r\nand not many till the middle of June; but after this time they are more\r\nnumerous till the end of the season.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEZING DESTROYS WORMS, COCOON AND MOTH.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty well demonstrated that the moth, its eggs, larvæ and\r\nchrysalis cannot pass the winter without warmth of some kind to prevent\r\ntheir freezing to death. The following facts indicate this. I have\r\ntaken all the bees out of a hive in the fall, and without disturbing\r\nthe comb or honey, put it in a cold chamber where it could freeze\r\nthoroughly. In the following March bees were again introduced, and when\r\nnot on a bench with some other stock that had worms, not a single\r\ninstance in forty cases has ever produced a worm before the middle of\r\nJune, or until the eggs of some moth matured in another hive has had\r\ntime to hatch. I have sometimes, instead of putting bees in these in\r\nMarch, kept them till June for swarms, perfectly free from any\r\nappearance of worms!\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THEY PASS THE WINTER.\r\n\r\nBut it is altogether a different thing with our hives in which bees are\r\nwintered; they are seldom or never entirely exempt! Perhaps it is\r\nimpossible to winter bees without preserving some eggs of the moth or a\r\nfew worms at the same time. The perfect moth perhaps never survives the\r\nwinter; the only place that the chrysalis would be safe, I think must\r\nbe in the vicinity of the bees--and a good stock will never allow it\r\nthere--but eggs, it would appear, are suffered to remain. In the fall,\r\nat the approach of cold weather, the bees are apt to leave the ends of\r\nthe combs exposed; the moth can now enter and deposit her eggs directly\r\nupon them; these, together with what are carried in by means before\r\nsuggested, are enough to prevent losing the breed. The warmth generated\r\nby the bees will keep these eggs from freezing and preserve their\r\nvitality. When warm weather approaches in the spring, those nearest the\r\nbees are probably hatched first, and commence depredations and are\r\nremoved by the bees. As the bees increase and occupy more comb, more\r\nare warmed up and hatched. In this way, even a small family of bees\r\nwill hatch, and get rid of all the eggs that happen to be in their\r\ncombs, and not be destroyed. This is the time that the apiarian may be\r\nof service in destroying the worms, as the bees get them on the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCKS MORE LIABLE TO BE DESTROYED LAST OF SUMMER.\r\n\r\nBut in July and August it is different in this respect; a single moth\r\nmay enter the hive when exposed, and deposit her whole burden of\r\nseveral hundred eggs, as in the other case, but the heat from the bees\r\nis now unnecessary to hatch them. The weather at this season will make\r\nany part of the hive warm enough to set her whole brood at work at\r\nonce, and in three weeks all may be destroyed! This, and the fact that\r\nmore moths exist now than before, may account for the greater number of\r\nstocks being destroyed at this season. Yet it is considered extremely\r\nbad management to allow honey or combs to be devoured by this\r\ndisgusting creature. A little care to know the condition of the stocks\r\n_is necessary_ to prevent their getting the start. These duties should\r\nbe fully considered before we take the responsibility of the care of\r\nbees.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN BEES ARE SAFE.\r\n\r\nThe only condition when we can rest and feel safe is when _we know all\r\nour stocks are full of bees_. Even the \"moth-proof\" hive containing\r\ncombs will be scented out by the moth, when there are no bees to guard\r\nit. An argument to show that a moth can enter where a bee can go is\r\nunnecessary, and a little observation, I think, will prove that her\r\neggs sometimes go where she is not allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS TO DESTROY THEM.\r\n\r\nAt this season, (July and August), it is a good plan to put a few\r\npieces of old dry combs near the hives, in a box, or other place, as a\r\ndecoy, where the moth may have access. She will deposit a great many of\r\nher eggs here, instead of the hive, and can be easily destroyed. As we\r\ncannot always have our bees in a situation to feel safe, it will be\r\nwell to adopt some of the means recommended to diminish the number of\r\nmoths. First destroy all the worms that can be found at any time,\r\nparticularly in spring; second, all cocoons that can be got at. A great\r\nmany worms can be enticed to web up, under a trap of elder, &c., when\r\nit is an easy matter to dispatch them. Thirdly, destroy all the moths\r\npossible that can be seen about the hive. They are very much like the\r\nflea, \"when you put your finger on him he is not there;\" a careful move\r\nis necessary to crush him at once, otherwise he darts away at the least\r\ndisturbance. Probably the most expeditious mode is to make them drunk.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING THEM DRUNK, AND THEIR EXECUTION BY CHICKENS.\r\n\r\nMix with water just enough molasses and vinegar to make it palatable;\r\nthis is to be put in white saucers or other dishes, and set among the\r\nhives at night. Like nobler beings, if not wiser, when once they have\r\ntasted the fatal beverage, they seem to lose all power to leave the\r\nfascinating cup; but give way to appetite and excitement till a fatal\r\nstep plunges them into destruction! The next morning finds them yet\r\nwallowing in filth, weak and feeble. Whether they would recover from\r\nthe effects of their carousal if lifted out of the mire, and carefully\r\nnursed like other specimens of creation, I never ascertained. With but\r\nlittle trouble a chicken or two will learn to be on hand, and greedily\r\ndevour every one. Hundreds are caught in this way, although many other\r\nkinds besides the bee-moth will be mixed with them. This drink may be\r\nused till dried up, occasionally adding a little water; perhaps it is\r\nbetter after fermenting. This recipe appeared some years ago in some\r\npaper; I have forgotten where. Salt has been recommended to prevent the\r\nmischief of the worms, as well as a benefit to the bees. I used it\r\npretty extensively for several years, as I thought without much\r\nbenefit, and got tired. I then tried salting a part, and let the rest\r\ndo entirely without, and found no difference in their prosperity. Since\r\nthen, some ten years ago, I abandoned its use altogether, and succeed\r\njust as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nMELTING DOWN OF COMBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSE.\r\n\r\nWhen extreme hot weather occurs immediately after the bees have been\r\ngathering from a plentiful harvest for two or three weeks, or even\r\nduring the yield, the wax composing new combs is very liable to be\r\nsoftened, till they break loose from their fastenings and settle to the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS.\r\n\r\nSometimes the injury is trifling, only a piece or two slipping down; at\r\nother times the whole contents fall in a confused and broken mass, the\r\nweight pressing out the honey, and besmearing the bees, which in that\r\nsituation creep out, and away, from the hive in every direction.\r\n\r\nI once had some new stocks ruined, and several others injured by hot\r\nweather, in this way, about the first of September, immediately after\r\nthe flowers of buckwheat. The bees, or most of them, being covered with\r\nhoney, together with what ran out of the hive, at once attracted bees\r\nfrom the others to the spot, which carried off the entire contents in a\r\nfew hours. This was an uncommon occurrence; I have known but one season\r\nin twenty-five years when it occurred after the failure of honey in the\r\nflowers. It usually happens during a plenteous yield, and then other\r\nstocks are not apt to be troublesome.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INDICATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe first indications of such an accident will be, the bees outside in\r\nclusters, when the hive is perhaps only half or two-thirds full, and\r\nthe honey running out from the bottom, (this is when part has fallen.)\r\n\r\n\r\nPREVENTION.\r\n\r\nTo prevent such occurrences as far as possible, ventilate by raising\r\nthe hives on little blocks at the corners, and _effectually protect\r\nthem from the sun_; and if necessary, wet the outside with _cold_\r\nwater. At the time of losing those before mentioned, I kept all the\r\nrest of the young swarms wet through the middle of the day, and I have\r\nno doubt but I saved several by this means. I had some trouble with\r\nsuch as had only a piece or two come down, and started just honey\r\nenough to attract other bees. It was not safe to close the hive to\r\nprevent the robbers, as this would have made the heat still greater,\r\nand been certain destruction.\r\n\r\nThe best protection I found, was to put around the bottom of the hive a\r\nfew stems of asparagus; this gave a free circulation of air, and at the\r\nsame time, made it very difficult for the robbers to approach the\r\nentrance, without first creeping through this hedge and encountering\r\nsome bees that belonged to the hive; which, with this assistance, were\r\nenabled to defend themselves till all wasting honey was taken up.\r\n\r\nWhen the hive is nearly full, and but one or two sheets come down, the\r\nlower edge will rest on the floor, and the other combs will keep it in\r\nan upright position, until the bees fasten it again. It is generally as\r\nwell to leave such pieces as they are. If the hive is but half full or\r\nlittle more, and such pieces are not kept perpendicular by the\r\nremaining combs, they are apt to be broken and crushed badly, by\r\nfalling so far; and most of the honey will be wasted. To save this, it\r\nwill be necessary to remove it, (unless a dish can be made to catch\r\nit). Be careful not to turn the hive on its side, and break the\r\nremaining combs, if any are left. Such combs as contain brood and but\r\nlittle honey, might be left for the brood to mature. Should the bees be\r\nable to take the honey or not waste much, it might be advisable to\r\nleave it, till the contents were taken up; it would greatly assist in\r\nfilling up. But these broken pieces should be removed before they\r\ninterfere with the combs extending to the bottom. A part of the bees\r\nare generally destroyed, but the majority will escape; even such as are\r\ncovered with honey, (if they are not crushed) will clean it off and\r\nsoon be in working order, when others do not interfere officiously,\r\nassisting to remove it. A good yield of honey is the best protection\r\nagainst this disposition to pillage. After the first year combs become\r\nthicker, and are not so liable to give way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nFALL MANAGEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST CARE.\r\n\r\nWhen the flowers fail at the end of the season, the first thing\r\nnecessary is to ascertain which are the weakest stocks, and all that\r\ncannot defend themselves should either be removed or reinforced. The\r\nstrength of all stocks is pretty thoroughly tested within a few days\r\nafter a failure of honey. Should any be found with too few bees for\r\ndefence, they are quite sure to be plundered. Hence the necessity of\r\naction in season, that we may secure the contents in advance of the\r\nrobbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRONG STOCKS DISPOSED TO PLUNDER.\r\n\r\nStrong stocks, that during a yield have occupied every cell with brood\r\nand honey, when it fails, will soon have empty cells left by the young\r\nbees, hatching. These empty cells, without honey to fill them, appear\r\nto be a source of much uneasiness. Although such hive and caps may be\r\nwell stored, I have ever found them to be the worst in the apiary, much\r\nmore disposed to plunder, than weaker ones with half the honey. As weak\r\nstocks cannot be bettered now, it is best to remove them at once, and\r\nput the temptation out of the way. Carelessness is but a sorry excuse,\r\nfor letting bees establish this habit of dishonesty. Should any stocks\r\nbe weak from disease, the consequences would be even more disastrous\r\nthan bad habits; the reasons why such impure honey should not go into\r\nthrifty stocks, have already been given. If we want the least possible\r\ntrouble with our bees, none but the best should be selected for winter.\r\nBut what constitutes a good stock, seems to be but partially\r\nunderstood; if we judge from the number lost annually, too many are\r\ncareless, or ignorant in the selection; supposing, perhaps, because a\r\nstock has been good one winter and swarmed well, it must of course be\r\nright; the mistake is often fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEES CHANGEABLE.\r\n\r\nBees are so changeable, especially in the summer and swarming season,\r\nthat we can seldom be certain what they are, by what they have been. It\r\nis safest, therefore, _to know what they are now_.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUISITES FOR GOOD STOCKS.\r\n\r\nThe proper requisites for a good stock are a full hive of proper shape\r\nand size, (viz., 2,000 inches,) well stored with honey; a large family\r\nof bees, and in a healthy condition, which must be ascertained by\r\nactual inspection. The age is not important till over eight years old.\r\nStocks possessing these points, can be wintered with but little\r\ntrouble. But it cannot be expected that all will be in this condition.\r\nMany bee-keepers will wish to increase their stocks and keep all that\r\nis practicable, by supplying any deficiency. I shall endeavor to make\r\nit appear profitable to do so, until bees enough are kept in the\r\ncountry, to get all the honey that is now wasted.\r\n\r\nAll can understand why it is a loss to have bees eat honey part of the\r\nwinter and then die--that the honey consumed might have been\r\nsaved--that it makes no great difference to the bees whether they are\r\nkilled in the fall or sacrificed in the winter. I am not an advocate\r\nfor fire and brimstone as the reward of all unfortunate stocks, and\r\nshall recommend it only when its use will make it no worse. We will see\r\nhow far it can be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT DISADVANTAGE OF KILLING THE BEES.\r\n\r\nThose rustic bee-keepers who are in the habit of making their hives\r\nvery large, such as will hold from 100 to 140 lbs., and killing the\r\nbees in the fall, and sending the honey to market, will probably\r\ncontinue the use of sulphur, unless we can convince them of the greater\r\nadvantage of making the hive smaller and have fifty or eighty lbs. of\r\nthis honey in boxes which will sell for more than can be realized for\r\ntheir larger hive full, and at the same time, save their bees for a\r\nstock-hive, making a better return in the long run, than one hundred\r\ndollars at interest. When hives are made the proper size, the honey\r\nwill not be an object sufficient to pay for destroying the bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION OF COUNTRY MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN WHAT POOR STOCKS NEED.\r\n\r\nThe kind of requisite to be supplied to our deficient stocks, will\r\nprobably depend on the section of country. Where the principal source\r\nis clover and basswood, it will fail partially, at least, before the\r\nend of warm weather.\r\n\r\nSome poor or medium stocks will continue to rear brood too extensively\r\nfor their means, and exhaust their winter stores in consequence; such\r\nwill need a supply of honey. But where great quantities of buckwheat\r\nare sown, cold weather follows almost immediately after this yield, and\r\nstops the breeding. Consequently a scarcity of bees is more frequent\r\nthan honey. There are exceptions, of course; I am speaking of these\r\ncases generally. My experience has mostly been in a section where this\r\ncrop is raised, and will say that there is not more than one season in\r\nten, but that the honey will be in proportion with the bees the first\r\nof September; that is, if there are bees enough, there will be honey\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN BEES ARE NEEDED.\r\n\r\nI have frequently had stocks with stores amply sufficient to carry a\r\ngood family through the winter, and yet too few bees to last till\r\nJanuary, or even to defend themselves from the robbers. Hence I am in\r\nthe habit of supplying bees oftener than honey.\r\n\r\nI usually have some few hives with too little honey, as well as too few\r\nbees. Now it is very plain if the bees of one or more of this class\r\nwere united with the first successfully, we should have a respectable\r\nfamily. I have made additions to stocks in this way that proved\r\nfirst-rate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUTION.\r\n\r\nWhenever we make additions in this manner, it would be well first to\r\nascertain what was the cause of a scarcity of bees; if it was\r\nover-swarming or loss of queen, it is well enough--but if from disease,\r\nreject them, unless the bees are to be transferred the next spring, and\r\nthen, when too many cells are occupied with dead brood, as the bees\r\ncannot be successfully wintered.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL DIFFICULTY.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty in uniting two families or more in this manner,\r\nis where they have to be taken from different places in the same\r\napiary; where the locations have been marked. It is sufficiently shown\r\nthat bees return to the old stand.\r\n\r\nTo prevent these results, it has been recommended \"to set an empty hive\r\nwith some pieces of comb, fastened in the top in the place of the one\r\nremoved, to catch the bees that go back to the old stand, and remove\r\nthem at night for a few times, when they remain.\" This should be done\r\nonly when we cannot do better; it is considerable trouble; besides\r\nthis, we do not always succeed to our satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW AVOIDED.\r\n\r\nI like the plan of bringing them a mile or more for this purpose, and\r\nhave no after trouble about it. Two neighbors being that distance\r\napart, each having stocks in this condition might exchange bees, making\r\nthe benefit mutual. I have done so, and considered myself well paid for\r\nthe trouble. But latterly I have had several apiaries away from home,\r\nand now manage without difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF MAKING ONE GOOD STOCK FROM TWO POOR ONES.\r\n\r\nThis making one good stock out of two poor ones, cannot be too highly\r\nrecommended; aside from its advantages, it relieves us from all\r\ndisagreeable feelings in taking life, that we can with but little\r\ntrouble preserve.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO FAMILIES TOGETHER WILL NOT CONSUME AS MUCH AS IF SEPARATE.\r\n\r\nEven when a stock already contains bees enough to make it safe for\r\nwinter, another of the same number of bees may be added, and _the\r\nconsumption of honey will not be five lbs. more than one swarm would\r\nconsume alone_. If they should be wintered in the cold, the difference\r\nmight not be one pound. Why more bees do not consume a proportionate\r\nquantity of honey, (which the experience of others as well as myself\r\nhas thoroughly proved), is a mystery, unless the greater number of bees\r\ncreates more animal heat, and being warm, eat less, is a solution,\r\n(which if it is, is a strong reason for keeping bees warm in winter.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXPERIMENT.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, I cannot recommend making a _good_ stock\r\nbetter by adding the bees from another good one as a source of profit.\r\nI tried it a few times. I had purchased some large hives for market,\r\nand wished to dispose of the bees without sulphur, and try the\r\nexperiment of uniting two or more. The next spring when they commenced\r\nwork such double stocks promised much; but when the swarming season\r\narrived, the single swarms, such as were good and had just about bees\r\nenough, were in the best condition, in ordinary seasons. Whether this\r\nwas owing to the circumstance of there being already bees enough that\r\nwere beginning to crowd and interfere with each other's labors, and\r\nless brood raised in consequence, or to some other reason, I cannot\r\nsay. I have often noticed, (as others have), that stocks which have\r\ncast no swarms, are no better the next spring than others. The same\r\ncause might operate in both cases. Therefore it would appear\r\nunnecessary to unite two or more _good swarms_, unless it is to spare\r\nour feelings in destroying the bees. The two extremes may generally be\r\navoided, and not have too many or too few bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEASON FOR OPERATING.\r\n\r\nThe season for operating is, generally, when all the brood has matured\r\nand left the cells. The exceptions are when there are not bees enough\r\nto protect the stores; it may then be necessary, immediately after the\r\nfailure of honey.\r\n\r\nCol. H. K. Oliver, of Salem, Mass., is said to be the inventor of the\r\nfumigator, an instrument to burn fungus (_puff-ball_). By the aid of\r\nthis the smoke is blown in the hive, paralyzing the bees in a few\r\nminutes; when they fall to the bottom, apparently dead, but will\r\nrecover in a few minutes, on receiving fresh air.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUMIGATOR.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to a communication from J. M. Weeks, published on page\r\n151 of the Cultivator for 1841, for this method. The description of the\r\nfumigator that I constructed will vary a trifle from his, but will\r\nretain the principle.  I obtained a tin tube four inches long, and two\r\nin diameter. Next, I made a stopper of soft wood, three inches long, to\r\nexactly fit one end of the tube when driven in half an inch, and\r\nsecured it by little nails driven through the tin. Through the centre\r\nof this stopper I made a hole one-fourth of an inch in diameter. To\r\nprevent this hole filling up, the end in the tube was covered over with\r\nwire cloth, made a little convex. The end of this stopper was cut down\r\nto about half an inch, tapering it from the tin. For the other end a\r\nsimilar piece of wood is fitted, though a little longer, and not to be\r\nfastened, as it must be taken out for every operation. The outer end of\r\nthis is cut down into a shape to be taken into the mouth, or attached\r\nto the pipe of a bellows.  (I fitted them in the turning lathe, but\r\nhave seen them fixed very nicely without.) It could all be made of tin;\r\nbut then it is necessary to use solder, which is liable to melt and\r\ncause leaks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FUMIGATOR.]\r\n\r\n\"The puff-balls must not be too much injured by remaining in the\r\nweather, and should be picked, if possible, just before they are ripe\r\nand burst open. When not thoroughly dry, put them in the oven after the\r\nbread is out.\" When used, the cuticle or rind must be carefully\r\nremoved; ignite it by a lamp or coal (it will not blaze in burning),\r\nblow it, and get it thoroughly started, before putting it in the tube.\r\nPut in the stopper, and blow through it; if it smokes well, you are\r\nready to proceed. When it does not burn freely, unstop and shake it\r\nout. The dry air is much better than moist breath at the commencement.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR UNITING TWO FAMILIES.\r\n\r\nThe hive to receive the bees is inverted, the other set over it right\r\nend up, all crevices stopped to prevent the escape of the smoke. Now\r\ninsert the end of the fumigator into a hole in the side of the hive\r\n(which if not made before will need to be now); blow into the other\r\nend, this forces the smoke into the hive; in two minutes you may hear\r\nthe bees begin to fall. Both hives should be smoked; the upper one the\r\nmost, as we want all the bees out of that. The other only needs enough\r\nto make the scent of the bees similar to those introduced. At the end\r\nof eight or ten minutes, the upper hive may be raised, and any bees\r\nsticking between the combs brushed down with a quill. The two queens in\r\nthis case are of course together; one will be destroyed, and no\r\ndifficulty arise. But if either of them is a young one, and you have\r\nbeen convinced by some \"bee-doctor\" that such are much more prolific,\r\nand happen to know which hive contains her, and wish that one to be\r\npreserved, you can do so by varying the process a little. Instead of\r\ninverting one hive, set them both on a cloth right side up, and smoke\r\nthe bees; the queens are easily found, while they are all paralyzed;\r\nthen put the bees all together. The hive should now have a thin cloth\r\ntied over the bottom, to prevent the escape of the bees. Before they\r\nare fully recovered, they seem rather bewildered, and some of them get\r\naway. Set the hive right end up, and raise it an inch; the bees drop on\r\nthe cloth, and fresh air passing under soon revives them. In from\r\ntwelve to twenty-four hours, they may be let out.\r\n\r\nFamilies put together in this way will seldom quarrel (not more than\r\none in twenty), but remain together, defending themselves against\r\nintruders as one swarm.\r\n\r\nI once had a stock nearly destitute of bees, with abundant stores for\r\nwintering a large family. I had let it down on the floor-board, and was\r\non the lookout for an attack. The other bees soon discovered this\r\nweakness, and commenced carrying off the honey. I had brought home a\r\nswarm to reinforce them only the day before, and immediately united\r\nthem by means of the fumigator. The next morning I let them out,\r\nallowing them to issue only at the hole in the side of the hive. It was\r\namusing to witness the apparent consternation of the robbers that were\r\non hand for more plunder; they had been there only the day before, and\r\nhad been allowed to enter and depart without even being questioned. But\r\nlo! a change had come over the matter. Instead of open doors and a free\r\npassage, the first bee that touched the hive was seized and very rudely\r\nhandled, and at last dispatched with a sting. A few others receiving\r\nsimilar treatment, they began to exercise a little caution, then tried\r\nto find admission on the back side, and other places; and attempted one\r\nor two others on either side, perhaps thinking they were mistaken in\r\nthe hive; but these being strong, repulsed them, and they finally gave\r\nit up. I mention this to show how easy it is, with a little care, to\r\nprevent robberies at this season. Too many complaints are made about\r\nbees being robbed; it is very disagreeable. Suppose that _none were\r\nplundered through carelessness_; this complaint would soon be a rare\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITING WITH TOBACCO SMOKE.\r\n\r\nBy the use of tobacco smoke, bees may be united with nearly the same\r\nsuccess. First, smoke the two to be united, thoroughly; disturb them\r\nand smoke again, that all may become partially drunk, and acquire the\r\nsame scent. Then invert both hives, and with your pruning tools, cut\r\nthe combs down on the sides of the hive, and across the top, and take\r\nout one comb at a time with the bees on it, and brush them with a quill\r\ninto the other hive; they immediately go down among the combs, without\r\nonce thinking it necessary to sting you. When done, the bees are to be\r\nconfined, the same as in the other method. I do not like this method as\r\nwell as the first, and do not resort to it when I can get the\r\npuff-ball. The bees are more liable to disagree, and it compels me to\r\ntake out the comb, which I do not always like to do at the time. To\r\navoid it, I have tried to drive them, but when the hive is only part\r\nfull of combs, or contains but few bees, it is a slow job; and more so\r\nin cool weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF STOCKS IN 1851.\r\n\r\nThe latter part of the summer of 1851 was very dry and cold; the yield\r\nof buckwheat honey was not a tenth of the usual quantity; the\r\nconsequence was, that none but early swarms had sufficient honey for\r\nwinter; twenty-five pounds is required to make it _safe_ in this\r\nsection. I had over thirty young swarms with less than that quantity.\r\nFeeding for winter I avoid when I can; they would not winter as they\r\nwere; and yet I made the most of them good stocks for the next summer\r\nby the following plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THEY WERE MANAGED.\r\n\r\nI had about twenty old stocks with diseased brood, and but few bees,\r\nyet _honey enough_. Now this honey appears healthy enough for the old\r\nbees, and fatal only to the young brood.\r\n\r\nI transferred the bees of these new swarms to the old stocks with black\r\ncomb and diseased brood. The bees were thus wintered on honey of but\r\nlittle account any way, and all that was in the others, new and\r\nhealthy, was saved. These new hives were set in a cold dry place for\r\nwinter; _right end up_, to prevent much of the honey from dripping out\r\nof the cells; some will leak then, but not as much as when the hive is\r\nbottom up. Honey that runs out, when the hive is bottom up, will soak\r\ninto the wood at the base of the combs; this will have a tendency to\r\nloosen the fastenings, and render them liable to fall, &c.\r\n\r\nThe next March the bees were again transferred from the old to the new\r\nhives. My method is as follows: As the combs in the hive to receive the\r\nbees are rather cold, I set them by the fire, or in a warm room, for\r\nseveral hours previous. I take a warm room before a window, and as some\r\nfew bees fly off, they will collect there. The new hive is turned\r\nbottom up on the floor; the old one on a bench by the side of it,\r\nhaving smoked the bees to keep them quiet. One comb at a time is taken\r\nout, and the bees brushed into the new hive; (a little smoke will keep\r\nthem there). When through, I get the few on the window, and tie over a\r\ncloth to confine them, and keep them warm for a few hours longer.\r\nParalyzing with puff-ball will answer instead, but they do not always\r\nall fall out of the combs when the hive is filled to the bottom, and it\r\nis possible that if a few were left, the queen might be one. Also a\r\nvery few bees are worth saving at this season, and the combs might have\r\nto be broken out at last, for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen a good-sized family is put in a hive containing fifteen or twenty\r\npounds of honey, and near half full of clean new comb, they are about\r\nas sure to fill up and cast a swarm, as another that is full and has\r\nwintered a swarm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF THEIR SUPERIOR THRIFT.\r\n\r\nOne cause of superior thrift may be found in the circumstance, that all\r\nmoth eggs and worms are frozen to death, and the bees are not troubled\r\nwith a single worm before June. No young bees have to be removed to\r\nwork them out. Nearly every young bee that is fed and sealed up, comes\r\nforth perfect, and of course makes a vast difference in the increase.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWARMS PARTLY FILLED PAY BETTER THAN TO CUT OUT THE HONEY.\r\n\r\nAny person wishing to increase his stocks to the utmost, will find this\r\nplan of saving all part-filled hives, of much more advantage than to\r\nbreak it out for sale. Suppose you have an old stock that needs\r\npruning, and have neglected it, or it has refused to swarm, and give\r\nyou a chance without destroying too much brood. You can let it be, and\r\nput on the boxes; perhaps get twenty-five pounds of cap honey; and then\r\nwinter the bees as described, and in the spring transfer them to the\r\nnew combs. Again, if there is no stocks to be transferred in the\r\nspring, keep them till the swarming season. If a swarm put into an\r\nempty hive would just fill it, the same swarm put into one containing\r\nfifteen pounds of honey, it seems plain, would make that number of\r\npounds in boxes. The advantage is, in the comparative value of box or\r\ncap honey over that stored in the hive; the difference being from\r\nthirty to a hundred per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES IN TRANSFERRING.\r\n\r\nI would now like to show the advantages I derived in transferring the\r\ntwenty swarms before mentioned. We will suppose that each family, from\r\nthe first of October till April, consumed twenty pounds of honey. That\r\nin the centre combs, where there is most bee-bread, &c., is eaten\r\nfirst; if any is left, it is at the top and outside. If I had attempted\r\nto take out and strain this twenty pounds in the fall, it would have\r\nbeen so mixed with dead brood, and bee-bread, that I probably should\r\nhave rejected most of it. The remainder, when strained, might have been\r\nfive pounds, not more. The market price for it is about ten cents per\r\npound; amount fifty cents. We will say the new hive kept through the\r\nwinter to receive the bees in the spring contained fifteen pounds; this\r\nwould also have averaged about ten cents per pound, amounting to $1.50.\r\nAll that a stock of this kind costs me appears to be just $2.00, and\r\nworth at least $5.00. The advantage in changing twenty would be $60.00.\r\nThe labor of transferring will offset against the trouble of straining,\r\npreparing, and the expense of getting the honey to market.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER METHOD OF UNITING TWO FAMILIES.\r\n\r\nI have occasionally adopted yet another method of making a good stock\r\nfrom two poor ones, which the reader may prefer. When all your old\r\nstocks have been reinforced that need it, and you still have some\r\nswarms with too few bees and too little honey for safety as they are,\r\ntwo or more can be united. The fact, which has been thoroughly tested,\r\nthat two families of bees, when united and wintered in one hive, will\r\nconsume but little, if any more, than each of them would separately, is\r\na very important principle in this matter. If each family should have\r\nfifteen pounds of honey, they would consume it all, and probably starve\r\nat last, after eating thirty pounds. But if the contents of both were\r\nin one hive, it would be amply sufficient, and some to spare in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITING COMB AND HONEY AS WELL AS BEES.\r\n\r\nThe process of uniting them is simple. Smoke both the stocks or swarms\r\nthoroughly, and turn them over. Choose the one with the straightest\r\ncombs, or the one nearest full, to receive the contents of the other;\r\ntrim off the points of the combs to make them square across, and this\r\none is ready; remove the sticks from the other, and with your tools\r\ntake out the combs with the bees on as before directed, one at a time,\r\nand carefully set them on the edges of the other; if the shape will\r\nadmit it, let the edges match; if not, let them cross. Small bits of\r\nwood or rolls of paper will be needed between them, to preserve the\r\nright distance. When both hives are of one size, the transferred combs\r\nwill exactly fit, if you are careful to place them as they were before.\r\nYou will now want to know, \"what is to prevent these combs from falling\r\nout when the hive is turned over?\" This hive is to remain bottom up in\r\nsome dark place for some time, or till spring. (See method of wintering\r\nbees.) The bees will immediately join these combs fast; the hive being\r\ninverted, the honey in these combs will be consumed first; and when the\r\nhive is again set out in spring, it will be a rare occurrence for any\r\npieces to drop out. Should any pieces project beyond the bottom of the\r\nhive, they may be trimmed off even after they are fastened, any time\r\nbefore setting out. An additional cross-stick may pass under the bottom\r\nof the combs, to assist in holding them, if you desire. You will\r\nprobably never discover any difference in the subsequent prosperity in\r\nconsequence of the joining or crossing of the combs in the middle. I\r\nhave had them in this way, when they were among the most prosperous of\r\nmy stocks. As this operation is to be put off till November, it will be\r\nan advantage in another way; that is, families of the same apiary can\r\nbe united, and will mostly forget the old location by spring, and no\r\ndifficulty arise by returning to the old stand, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN FEEDING SHOULD BE DONE FOR STOCK HIVES.\r\n\r\nIn some sections of country the _honey_ is more frequently wanting than\r\nbees, or comb, and some seasons in this; in such cases, it will be\r\nfound an advantage to feed, until enough is stored for winter. This\r\nshould be done in September or October. But if they lack comb as well\r\nas honey, and you wish to try feeding, (which I seldom do lately,) it\r\nshould be done if possible in warm weather, as they cannot work combs\r\nto advantage in the cold. While feeding bees, it requires a great deal\r\nof caution to prevent others from scenting the honey, and their\r\ncontentions about it. The safest place is on the top of the hive, with\r\na good cap over; but they will not work quite as fast, especially if\r\nthe weather is cool. The next best place is under the bottom in the\r\nmanner described in Chapter IX.\r\n\r\nSetting out honey to feed all at once, I condemn wholly. These\r\ndisadvantages attend it: strong stocks that do not need an ounce, will\r\nget two or three pounds, while those weaker ones, needing it more, will\r\nnot get one. Nearly every stock, in a short time, will be fighting.\r\nProbably the first bee that comes home with a load, will inform a\r\nnumber of its fellows that a treasure is close at hand. A number will\r\nsally out immediately, without waiting for particular directions for\r\nfinding it; and mistaking other hives for the place, alight there, are\r\nseized and probably dispatched. As soon as the honey given them is\r\ngone, the tumult is greatly increased, and great numbers are destroyed.\r\nIf any of your neighbors near you have bees, you must expect to divide\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nIf the honey to be fed is in the comb, and your hives are not full, and\r\nthey are to be wintered in the house, bottom up, it may be done at any\r\ntime through the winter, merely by laying pieces with honey on those in\r\nthe hive. The bees readily remove the contents into their own combs;\r\nwhen empty, remove them and put in more until they have a full supply.\r\nThey will join such pieces of comb to their own; yet there will be no\r\nharm in breaking them loose. The principal objection to feeding in this\r\nway, will be found in the tendency to make them uneasy and disposed to\r\nleave the hive, when we want them as quiet as possible, A thin muslin\r\ncloth, or other means, will be necessary to confine them to the hive.\r\n\r\nI have now given directions to avoid killing any family of bees worth\r\nsaving, if we choose.\r\n\r\nWhen such as need feeding have been fed, and all weak families made\r\nstrong by additions, etc., but little more fall work is needed in the\r\napiary. It is only when you have weak stocks, unfit to winter, that it\r\nis necessary to be on the lookout every warm day to prevent pillage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER  XXII.\r\n\r\nWINTERING BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is almost as much diversity of opinion with respect to wintering\r\nbees as in the construction of hives, and about as difficult to\r\nreconcile.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT METHODS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED.\r\n\r\nOne will tell you to keep them warm, another to keep them cold; to keep\r\nthem in the sun, out of the sun, bury them in the ground, put them in\r\nthe cellar, the chamber, wood-house, and other places, and no places at\r\nall; that is, to let them remain as they are, without any attention.\r\nHere are plans enough to drive the inexperienced into despair. Yet I\r\nhave no doubt but that bees have been sometimes successfully wintered\r\nby all these contradictory methods. That some of these methods are\r\nsuperior to others, needs no argument to illustrate. But what method\r\n_is best_, is our province to inquire. Let us endeavor to examine the\r\nsubject without prejudice to bias our judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IDEA OF BEES NOT FREEZING HAS LED TO ERRORS IN PRACTICE.\r\n\r\nBy close observation we shall probably discover that the assertion so\r\noften repeated, that bees have never frozen except when without honey,\r\nhas led to an erroneous practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEARANCE OF BEES IN COLD WEATHER.\r\n\r\nWe will first endeavor to examine the condition of a stock left to\r\nnature, without any care, and see if it affords any hints for our\r\nguidance, when to assist and protect with artificial means.\r\n\r\nWarmth being the first requisite, a family of bees at the approach of\r\ncold weather crowd together in a globular form, into a compass\r\ncorresponding to the degree of cold; when at zero it is much less than\r\nat thirty above. Those on the outside of this cluster are somewhat\r\nstiffened with cold; while those inside are as brisk and lively as in\r\nsummer. In severe weather every possible space within their circle is\r\noccupied; even each cell not containing pollen or honey will hold a\r\nbee. Suppose this cluster is sufficiently compact for mutual warmth,\r\nwith the mercury at 40, and a sudden change brings it down to zero, in\r\na few hours, this body of bees, like most other things, speedily\r\ncontracts by the cold. The bees on the outside, being already chilled,\r\na portion of them that does not keep up with the shrinking mass, is\r\nleft exposed at a distance from their fellows, and receive but little\r\nbenefit of the warmth generated there; they part with their vitality,\r\nand are lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW PART OF THE SWARM IS FROZEN.\r\n\r\nA good family will form a ball or circle about eight inches in\r\ndiameter, generally about equal every way, and must occupy the spaces\r\nbetween four or five combs. As combs must separate them into divisions,\r\nthe two outer ones are smallest, and most exposed of any; these are\r\noften found frozen to death in severe weather. Should evidence be\r\nwanting from other sources to show that bees will freeze to death, the\r\nabove would seem to furnish it. It is said, \"that in Poland bees are\r\nwintered in a semi-torpid state, in consequence of the extreme cold.\"\r\nWe must either doubt the correctness of this relation, or suppose the\r\nbee of that country a different insect from ours--a kind of semi-wasp,\r\nthat will live through the winter, and eat little or nothing.  The\r\nreader can have no difficulty in deciding which is the most probable,\r\nwhether _bees are bees_ throughout the world, endowed with the same\r\nfaculties and instincts, or that the facts as they are, are not\r\nprecisely given, especially when we see what our own apiarians tell us\r\nabout their never freezing.\r\n\r\nHere I might use strong language in contradiction; but as I am aware\r\nthat such a course is not always the most convincing, I prefer the test\r\nof close observation. If bees will freeze, it is important to know it,\r\nand in what circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW A SMALL FAMILY MAY ALL FREEZE.\r\n\r\nSuppose a quart of bees were put in a box  or hive where all the cells\r\nwere filled and lengthened out with honey; the spaces between the combs\r\nwould be about one-fourth of an inch--only room for one thickness of\r\nbees to spread through. The combs would perhaps be one and a half or\r\ntwo inches thick. All the warmth that could be generated then, would be\r\nby one course or layer of bees, an inch and a half apart. Although\r\nevery bee would have food in abundance without changing its position,\r\nthe first turn of severe weather would probably destroy the whole.\r\nThis, it may be said, \"is an unnatural situation.\" I will admit that it\r\nis; the case was only supposed for illustration. I know that their\r\nwinter quarters are among the brood combs, where the hatching of the\r\nbrood leaves most of the cells empty; and the space between the combs\r\nis half an inch; a wise and beautiful arrangement; as ten times the\r\nnumber of bees can pack themselves within a circle of six inches, as\r\ncan in the other case; and in consequence the same number of bees can\r\nsecure much more animal heat, and endure the cold much better; but a\r\n_small_ family, even here, will often be found frozen, as well as\r\nstarving.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROST AND ICE SOMETIMES SMOTHER BEES.\r\n\r\nBesides freezing, there are other facts to be observed in stocks which\r\nstand in the cold. If we examine the interior of a hive containing a\r\nmedium-sized swarm, on the first severely cold morning, except in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the bees, we shall find the combs and sides of\r\nthe hive covered with a white frost. In the middle of the day, or as\r\nsoon as the temperature is slightly raised, this begins to melt,--first\r\nnext to the bees, then at the sides. A succession of cold nights will\r\nprevent the evaporation of this moisture; and this process of freezing\r\nand thawing, at the end of a week or two, will form icicles sometimes\r\nas large as a man's finger, attached to the combs and the sides of the\r\nhive. When the bottom of the hive is close to the floor, it forms a\r\nsealing around the edges, perfectly air-tight, and your bees are\r\nsmothered. I have frequently heard bee-keepers say in these cases, \"The\r\nstorm blew in, and formed ice all round the bottom, and froze my bees\r\nto death.\" Others that have had their bees in a cold room, finding them\r\nthus, \"could not see how the water and ice could get there any way;\r\nwere quite sure it was not there when carried in,\" &c. Probably they\r\nnever dreamed of its being accounted for philosophically, and to\r\nanalyze anything pertaining to bees would be rather small business. But\r\nwhat way can it be accounted for?\r\n\r\n\r\nFROST AND ICE IN A HIVE ACCOUNTED FOR.\r\n\r\nPhysiologists tell us \"that innumerable pores in the cuticle of the\r\nhuman body are continually throwing off waste or worn out matter; that\r\nevery exhalation of air carries with it a portion of water from the\r\nsystem, in warm weather unperceived, but will be condensed into\r\nparticles large enough to be seen in a cold atmosphere.\" Now, if\r\nanalogy be allowed here, we will say the bee throws of waste matter and\r\nwater in the same way. Its food being liquid, nearly all will be\r\nexhaled--in moderate weather it will pass off, but in the cold it is\r\ncondensed--the particles lodge on the combs in form of frost, and\r\naccumulate as long as the weather is very severe, a portion melting in\r\nthe day, and freezing again at night.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF ICE OR FROST ON BEES AND COMB.\r\n\r\nWhen the bees are not smothered, this water in the hive is the source\r\nof other mischief. The combs are quite certain to mould. The water\r\nmould or dampness on the honey renders it thin, and unhealthy for the\r\nbees, causing dysentery, or the accumulation of fæces that they are\r\nunable to retain. When the hive contains a very large family, or a very\r\nsmall one, there will be less frost on the combs,--the animal heat of\r\nthe first will drive it off; in the latter there will be but little\r\nexhaled.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROST MAY CAUSE STARVATION.\r\n\r\nThis frost is frequently the cause of medium or small families starving\r\nin cold weather, even when there is plenty of honey in the hive.\r\nSuppose all the honey in the immediate vicinity of the cluster of bees\r\nis exhausted, and, the combs in every direction from them are covered\r\nwith frost; if a bee should leave the mass and venture among them for a\r\nsupply, its fate would be as certain as starvation. And without timely\r\nintervention of warmer weather, they _must_ perish!\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER DIFFICULTIES.\r\n\r\nShould they escape starving, there is another difficulty often\r\nattending them in continued cold weather. I said that small families\r\nexhaled but little. Let us see if we can explain the effect.\r\n\r\nThere is not sufficient animal heat generated to exhale the aqueous\r\nportion of their food.  The philosophy that explains why a man in warm\r\nblood and in profuse perspiration would throw off or exhale more\r\nmoisture than in a quiet state, will illustrate this. The bees in these\r\ncircumstances must retain the water with the excrementitious part,\r\nwhich soon distends their bodies to the utmost, rendering them unable\r\nto endure it long. Their cleanly habits, that ordinarily save the combs\r\nfrom being soiled, is not a sure protection now, and they are compelled\r\nto leave the mass very often in the severest weather, to expel this\r\nunnatural accumulation of fæces. It is frequently discharged even\r\nbefore leaving the comb, but most of it at the entrance; also some\r\nscattered on the front side of the hive, and a short distance from it.\r\nIn a moderately warm day, more bees will issue from a hive in this\r\ncondition than from others; it appears that a part of them are unable\r\nto discharge their burden--their weight prevents their flying--they get\r\ndown and are lost. When cold weather is too long continued, they cannot\r\nwait for warm days to leave, but continue to come out at any time; and\r\nnot one of such can then return. The cluster inside the hive is thus\r\nreduced in numbers till they are unable to generate heat sufficient to\r\nkeep from freezing. With the indications attendant upon such losses, my\r\nown observation has made me somewhat familiar, as the following\r\nconversation will illustrate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nA neighbor who wished to purchase some stock hives in the fall,\r\nrequested my assistance in selecting them. We applied to a perfect\r\nstranger; his bees had passed the previous winter in the open air. I\r\nfound on looking among them that he had lost some of them from this\r\ncause, as the excrement was yet about the entrance of one old\r\nweather-beaten hive, that was now occupied by a young swarm, and was\r\nabout half filled with combs.\r\n\r\nI saw at once what had been the matter, and felt quite confident that I\r\ncould give its owner a correct history of it. \"Sir,\" said I, \"you have\r\nbeen unfortunate with the bees that were in this hive last winter; I\r\nthink I can give you some particulars respecting it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, what makes you think so? I would like to hear you guess; to\r\nencourage you, I will admit that there has been something rather\r\npeculiar about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"One year ago you considered that a good stock-hive; it was well filled\r\nwith honey, a good family of bees, and two or three years old or more.\r\nYou had as much confidence in its wintering as any other; but during\r\nthe cold weather, somehow, the bees unaccountably disappeared, leaving\r\nbut a very few, and they were found frozen to death. You discovered it\r\ntowards spring, on a warm day. When you removed the combs, you probably\r\nnoticed a great many spots of excrement deposited on them, as well as\r\non the sides of the hive, particularly near the entrance. Also one-half\r\nor more of the breeding cells contained dead brood, in a putrid state;\r\nand this summer you have used the old hive for a new swarm.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, sir, in every particular. Now, I would like to know\r\nwhat gave you the idea of my losing the bees in that hive? I can see\r\nnothing peculiar about that old hive, more than this one,\" pointing to\r\nanother that also contained a new swarm. \"You will greatly oblige me if\r\nyou will point out the signs particularly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do so with pleasure\" (feeling quite willing to give him the\r\nimpression that I was \"posted up\" on this subject, notwithstanding it\r\nsavored strongly of boasting).\r\n\r\nI then directed his attention to the entrance in the side of the hive,\r\nwhere the bees had discharged their fæces, on the moment they issued,\r\nuntil it was near the eighth of an inch thick, and two or three inches\r\nbroad; that yet remained, and just began to cleave off. \"You see this\r\nbrown substance around this hole in the hive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is bee-glue (_propolis_); it is very common on old hives.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not; if you will examine it closely, you will perceive it is\r\nnot so hard and bright; it already begins to crumble; bee-glue is not\r\naffected by the weather for years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so, but what is it, and what has that to do with your\r\nguess-work?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the excrement of the bees. In consequence of a great many cells\r\ncontaining dead brood, which the bees could not enter, they were unable\r\nto pack themselves close enough to secure sufficient animal heat to\r\nexhale or drive off the water in their food, it was therefore retained\r\nin their bodies till they were distended beyond endurance--they were\r\nunable to wait for a warm day--necessity compelled them to issue daily\r\nduring the coldest weather, discharging their fæces the moment of\r\npassing the entrance, and part of them before. They were immediately\r\nchilled, and could not return; the quantity left about this entrance\r\nshows that a great many must have come out. That they came out in cold\r\nweather is proved by its being left on the hive, because in warm\r\nweather they _leave_ the hive for this purpose.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a new idea; at present it seems to be correct; I will think it\r\nover. But how did you know that it was not a new swarm; that it was\r\nwell filled?\"\r\n\r\n\"When looking under it just now, I saw that combs of a dark color had\r\nbeen attached to the sides near the bottom, below where those are at\r\npresent; this indicates that it had been full, and the dark color that\r\nit was not new. Also, a swarm early and large enough to fill such a\r\nhive the first season, would not be very likely to be affected by the\r\ncold in this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? I think this hive was crowded with bees as much as any of my\r\nnew swarms.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt they appeared so; but we are very liable to be\r\ndeceived in such cases, by the dead brood in the combs. A\r\nmoderate-sized family in such a hive will make more show than some\r\nlarger ones that have empty cells to creep into, and can pack closer.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you know about the dead brood?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because old stocks are thus often reduced and lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were the indications of its being filled with honey?\"\r\n\r\n\"Combs are seldom attached to the side of the hive farther down than\r\nthey are filled with honey. In this hive the combs had been attached to\r\nthe bottom, consequently must have been full. Another thing, unless the\r\nfamily is very much reduced, the hive is generally well stored, even\r\nwhen diseased.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you suppose it was near spring before I discovered it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I took the chances of guessing. The majority of bee-keepers, you know,\r\nare rather careless, and when they have fixed their bees for winter,\r\nseldom give them much more attention, till they begin to fly out in the\r\nspring.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what should I have done had I discovered the bees coming out?\"\r\n\r\n\"As it was affected with dead brood, it was but little use to do\r\nanything; you would have lost it eventually. But if it had been a stock\r\notherwise healthy, and was affected in this way only because it was a\r\nsmall family, or the severity of the weather, you could have taken it\r\nto a warm room, and turned it bottom up; the animal heat would then\r\nconvert the most of the water contained in their food into vapor; that\r\nwould rise from the hive, and the bees could retain the excrementitious\r\nportion without difficulty till spring.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you must get along without losing many through the winter,\r\nif I may judge by your confident explanations.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can assure you I have but little fear on this head. If I can have\r\nthe privilege of selecting proper stocks, I will engage not to lose one\r\nin a hundred.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you manage? I would be glad to obtain a method in which I could\r\nfeel as perfectly safe as you appear to.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first important requisite is to have all good ones to start with.\r\nEnough weak families are united together till they are strong, or some\r\nother disposition made of them.\" I then gave him an outline of my\r\nmethod of wintering, which I can confidently recommend to the reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nACCUMULATION OF FÆCES DESCRIBED BY SOME WRITERS AS A DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThis accumulation of fæces is considered by many writers as a\r\ndisease--a kind of dysentery. It is described as affecting them towards\r\nspring, and several remedies are given. Now if what I have been\r\ndescribing is not the dysentery, why I must think I never had a case of\r\nit; but I shall still persist in guessing it to be the same, and\r\nsuppose that inattention with many must be the reason that it is not\r\ndiscovered in cold weather, at the time that it takes place. Some\r\nstocks may be badly affected, yet not lost entirely, when moderate\r\nweather will stop its progress. When a remedy is applied in the spring,\r\nlong after the cause ceases to operate, it would be singular if it was\r\nnot effectual. I have no doubt but some have taken the natural\r\ndischarge of fæces, that always takes place in spring when the bees\r\nleave the hive, for a disease. Others, when looking for a cause for\r\ndiseased brood, and found the combs and hive somewhat besmeared, have\r\nassigned this as sufficient; but according to my view, have reversed\r\nit, giving the effect before the cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR'S REMEDY.\r\n\r\nFor a time, I supposed that this moisture on the combs gradually mixed\r\nwith the honey, making it thin, and that the bees eating so much water\r\nwith their food, would affect them as described. Some experiments that\r\nfollowed, induced me to assign cold as the cause, as I always found,\r\nwhen I put them where it was sufficiently warm, that an immediate cure\r\nwas the result, or at least, it enabled them to retain their fæces till\r\nset out in the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nBURYING BEES.\r\n\r\nBurying bees in the earth below the frost, has been recommended as a\r\nsuperior method of wintering, for small families. I have known it\r\nconfidently asserted, that they would lose nothing in weight, and no\r\nbees would die. I found, in testing it, that a medium quantity of honey\r\nsufficed, and but very few were lost, perhaps less than by any other\r\nmethod. Yet the combs were mouldy, and unfit for further use. There was\r\nno escape for the vapor and dampness of the earth. This did not satisfy\r\nme; it only cured \"one disease by instituting another.\" I saved the\r\nbees, (and perhaps some honey), but the combs were spoiled.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS OF THE AUTHOR TO GET RID OF THE FROST.\r\n\r\nI wished to keep them warm, and save the bees as well as honey, and at\r\nthe same time, get rid of the moisture. I found that a large family\r\nexpelled it much better than small ones; and if all were put together\r\nin a close room, the animal heat from a large number combined, would be\r\nan advantage to the weak ones, at least,--this proved of some benefit.\r\nYet I found on the sides of a glass hive, that large drops of water\r\nwould stand for weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESS IN THIS MATTER.\r\n\r\nThe following suggestion then came to my relief. If this hive was\r\nbottom up, what would prevent all this vapor as it arises from the bees\r\nfrom passing off? (It always rises when warm, if permitted.) The hive\r\nwas inverted; in a few hours the glass was dry.\r\n\r\nThis was so perfectly simple, that I wondered I had not thought of it\r\nbefore, and wondered still more that some one of the many intelligent\r\napiarians had never discovered it. I immediately inverted every hive in\r\nthe room, and kept them in this way till spring; when the combs were\r\nperfectly bright, not a particle of mould to be seen, and was well\r\nsatisfied with the result of my experiment. Although I was fearful that\r\nmore bees would leave the hives when inverted, than if right side up,\r\nyet the result showed no difference. I had now tried both methods, and\r\nhad some means of judging.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEES WHEN IN THE HOUSE SHOULD BE KEPT PERFECTLY DARK.\r\n\r\nWhen not kept perfectly dark, a few would leave the hives in either\r\ncase. I have found it much better to make the room dark to keep the\r\nbees in the hive, than to tie over them a thin muslin cloth, as that\r\nprevents a free passage of the vapor, and a great number of full stocks\r\nwere not at all satisfied in confinement; and were continually\r\nworrying, and biting at the cloth, till they had made several holes\r\nthrough it for passages out. Thus the little good was attended by an\r\nevil, as an offset. Even wire cloth put over to confine them, which\r\nwould be effectual, would not save bees enough to pay expense. I have\r\nthus wintered them for the last ten years, and am extremely doubtful if\r\na better way can be found.[17] For several years I made use of a small\r\nbed-room in the house, made perfectly dark, in which I put about 100\r\nstocks. It was lathed and plastered, and no air admitted, except what\r\nmight come through the floor. It was single, and laid rather close,\r\nthough not matched.\r\n\r\n      [17] I was so well pleased with my success, especially with small\r\n      families, that I detailed the most important points in a\r\n      communication to the Dollar Newspaper, Philadelphia, published\r\n      November, 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nA ROOM MADE FOR WINTERING BEES.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1849 I built a room for this purpose; the frame was\r\neight by sixteen feet square, and seven high, without any windows. A\r\ngood coat of plaster was put on the inside, a space of four inches\r\nbetween the siding and lath was filled with saw-dust; under the bottom\r\nI constructed a passage for the admission of air, from the north side;\r\nanother over head for its exit, to be closed and opened at pleasure, in\r\nmoderate weather, to give them fresh air, but closed when cold, and so\r\narranged as to exclude all the light.\r\n\r\nA partition was extended across near the centre. This was to prevent\r\ndisturbing the whole by letting in light when carrying them out in the\r\nspring. By closing the door of this partition, those in one room only\r\nneed be disturbed at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANNER OF STOWING AWAY BEES.\r\n\r\nShelves to receive the hives were arranged in tiers one above the\r\nother; they were loose, to be taken down and put up at pleasure.\r\nSuppose we begin at the back end: the first row is turned directly on\r\nthe floor, a shelf is then put across a few inches above them, and\r\nfilled, and then another shelf, still above, when we again begin on the\r\nfloor, and continue thus till the room is full; or if the room is not\r\nto be filled, the shelves may be fixed around the sides of the room in\r\ntwo or three courses. This last arrangement will make it very\r\nconvenient to inspect them at any time through the winter, yet they\r\nshould be disturbed as little as possible. The manner of stowing each\r\none is to open the holes in the top, then lay down two square sticks,\r\nsuch as are made by splitting a board, of suitable length, into pieces\r\nabout an inch wide. The hive is inverted on these; it gives a free\r\ncirculation through the hive, and carries off all the moisture as fast\r\nas generated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE OF ROOM.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of such a room will vary according to the number and\r\nstrength of the stocks put in; 100 or more would be very sure to keep\r\nit above the freezing point at all times. Putting a very few into such\r\na room, and depending on the bees to make it warm enough, would be of\r\ndoubtful utility. If these means will not keep the proper temperature,\r\nprobably some other method would be better. All full stocks would do\r\nwell enough, as they would almost any way. Yet I shall recommend\r\nhousing them whenever practicable. If the number of stocks is few, let\r\nthe room be proportionably small.[18] It is the smallest families that\r\nare most trouble: if they are too cold, it may be known by bees leaving\r\nthe hive in cold weather, and spots of excrement on the combs; they\r\nshould then have some additional protection; close part or all of the\r\nholes in the top, cover the open bottom partially or wholly, and\r\nconfine to the hive as much as possible the animal heat; when these\r\nmeans fail, it may be necessary to take them to a warm room, during the\r\ncoldest weather.\r\n\r\n      [18] As an additional proof that this method of inverting hives\r\n      in the house for winter is valuable, I would say that Mr. Miner,\r\n      author of the American Bee-Keeper's Manual, seems fully to\r\n      appreciate it. In. the fall of 1850, I communicated to him this\r\n      method; giving my reasons for preferring it to the cold method\r\n      recommended in his Manual. The trial of one winter, it appears,\r\n      satisfied him of its superiority, so much so that within a year\r\n      from that time he published an essay recommending it; but advised\r\n      confining the bees with muslin, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOO MUCH HONEY MAY SOMETIMES BE STORED.\r\n\r\nAfter the flowers fail, and all the brood has matured and left the\r\ncombs, it sometimes happens that a stock has an opportunity of\r\nplundering, and rapidly filling all those cells that had been occupied\r\nwith brood during the yield of honey, and which then effectually\r\nprevents their storing in them. This, then, prevents close packing,\r\nwhich is all-important for warmth. Although a large family, as much\r\ncare is needed as with the smaller ones. Also such as are affected with\r\ndiseased brood should receive extra attention for the same reason.\r\n\r\nSome bee-keepers are unwilling to risk the bold measure of inverting\r\nthe hive, but content themselves by merely opening the holes in the\r\ntop; this is better than no ventilation, but not so effectual, as all\r\nof the moisture cannot escape. There are some who cannot divest\r\nthemselves of the idea, that if the hive is turned over, the bees must\r\nalso stand on their heads all winter!\r\n\r\nRats and mice, when they find their way into such room, are less bold\r\nwith their mischief than if the hive is in its natural position.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF ROOM TOWARDS SPRING.\r\n\r\nA few warm days will often occur, towards spring, before we can get our\r\nbees out. In these cases, a bushel or two of snow or ice pounded up\r\nshould be spread on the floor; it will absorb and carry off as it melts\r\nmuch of the heat, that is now unnecessary, and will keep them quiet\r\nmuch longer than without it; (provision for getting rid of this water\r\nshould be made when putting down the floor.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME FOR SETTING OUT BEES.\r\n\r\nThe time for carrying out bees is generally in March, but some seasons\r\nlater. A warm pleasant day is the best, and one quite cold, better than\r\none only _moderately_ warm.\r\n\r\nAfter their long confinement, the light attracts them out at once,\r\n(unless very cold air prevents), and if the rays of a warm sun do not\r\nkeep them active, they will soon be chilled and lost.\r\n\r\nSome bee-keepers take out their stocks at evening. If we could be\r\nalways sure of having the next day a fair one, it would probably be the\r\nbest time; but should it be only moderate, or cloudy, it would be\r\nattended with considerable loss--or if the next day should be quite\r\ncold, but few would leave, and then the only risk would be to get _a\r\ngood day_, before one that was just warm enough to make them leave the\r\nhive, but not quite enough to enable them to return.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOT TOO MANY STOCKS TAKEN OUT AT ONCE.\r\n\r\nWhen too many are taken out at once, the rush from all the hives is so\r\nmuch like a swarm, that it appears to confuse them. Some of the stocks\r\nby this means will get more bees than actually belong to them, while\r\nothers are proportionably short, which is unprofitable, and to equalize\r\nthem is some trouble; yet it may be done. Being all wintered in one\r\nroom, the scent or the means of distinguishing their own family from\r\nstrangers, becomes so much alike, that they mix together without\r\ncontention.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILIES MAY BE EQUALIZED.\r\n\r\nBy taking advantage of this immediately, or before the scent has again\r\nchanged, and each hive has something peculiar to _itself_, you can\r\nchange the stands of very weak and very strong families.\r\n\r\nTo prevent, as far as possible, some of these bad effects, I prefer\r\nwaiting for a fair day to begin, and then not until the day has become\r\nsufficiently warm to make it safe from chill.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOW NEED NOT ALWAYS PREVENT CARRYING OUT BEES.\r\n\r\nI am not particular about the snow being gone--if it has only lain long\r\nenough to have melted a part of it, it is \"terra firma\" to a bee, and\r\nanswers equally well as the bare earth. When the day is right, about\r\nten o'clock I put out twelve or fifteen, taking care that each hive\r\noccupies its old stand, at the same time endeavoring to take such as\r\nwill be as far apart as possible; (to make this convenient, they should\r\nbe carried in in the manner that you wish them to come out.) When the\r\nrush from these hives is over, and the majority of the bees has gone\r\nback, I set out as many more about twelve o'clock, and when the day\r\ncontinues fair, another lot about two. In the morning, while cool, I\r\nmove from the back to the first apartment, about as many as I wish to\r\nset out in a day, except a few at the last.\r\n\r\nTo do this in the middle of the day, while warm, would induce a good\r\nmany bees to leave the hive, while the light was admitted, and which\r\nwould be lost. It will be supposed generally that their long\r\nconfinement makes them thus impatient to get out; but I have frequently\r\nreturned stocks during a cold turn of weather after they had been out,\r\nand always found such equally as anxious to come out, as those which\r\nhad been confined throughout the winter; without the airings, I have\r\nkept them thus confined, for five months, without difficulty! The\r\nimportant requisites are, sufficient warmth and perfect darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOES NOT ANALOGY PROVE THAT BEES SHOULD BE KEPT WARM IN WINTER?\r\n\r\nOpposition to this method of wintering will arise with those who have\r\nalways thought that bees must be kept cold; \"the colder the better.\" I\r\nwould suggest for their consideration the possibility of some analogy\r\nbetween bees and some of the warm-blooded animals--the horse, ox, and\r\nsheep, for instance, that require a constant supply of food, that they\r\nmay generate as much caloric as is thrown off on the cold air. This\r\nseems to be regulated by the degree of cold, else why do they refuse\r\nthe large quantity of tempting provender in the warm days of spring,\r\nand greedily devour it in the pelting storm? The fact is pretty well\r\ndemonstrated, that the quantity of food needed for the same condition\r\nin spring, is much less when protected from the inclemency of the\r\nweather, than when exposed to the severe cold. The bee, unlike the\r\nwasp, when once penetrated with frost, is dead--_their temperature must\r\nbe kept considerably above the freezing point, and to do this, food is\r\nrequired_. Now if the bees are governed by the same laws, and cold air\r\ncarries off more heat than warm, and their source of renewing it is in\r\nthe consumption of honey in proportion to the degree of cold, common\r\nsense would say, keep them warm as possible. As a certain degree of\r\nheat is necessary in all stocks, it may take about such a quantity of\r\nhoney to produce it, and this may explain why a small family requires\r\nabout the same amount of food as others that are very large.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEXT BEST PLACE FOR WINTERING BEES.\r\n\r\nA _dry_, warm cellar is the next best place for wintering them; the\r\napiarian having one perfectly dark, with room to spare, will find it a\r\nvery good place, in the absence of a room above ground. If a large\r\nnumber was put in, some means of ventilation should be contrived for\r\nwarm turns of weather. I know an apiarian, who by my suggestion has\r\nwintered from sixty to eighty stocks in this way, for the last six\r\nyears, with perfect success, not having lost one. Another has wintered\r\nthirty with equal safety.\r\n\r\nAs for burying them in the earth, I have not the least doubt, if a dry\r\nplace should be selected, the hive inverted, and surrounded with hay,\r\nstraw, or some substance to absorb the moisture, and protected from the\r\nrain, at the top of the covering, that perfect success would attend the\r\nexperiment. But this is only theory; when I tried the experiment of\r\nburying, and had the combs mould, the hives ware right side up.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVILS OF WINTERINGS IN THE OPEN AIR CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\nAs a great many bee-keepers will find it inconvenient, or be unable to\r\navail themselves of my method of wintering, it will be well enough to\r\nsee how far the evils of the open air, which we have already glanced\r\nat, may be successfully avoided. I am told by those who have tried\r\nwintering them in straw hives, that in this respect they are much safer\r\nthan those made of boards; probably the straw will absorb the moisture.\r\nBut as these hives are more trouble to construct, and their shape will\r\nprevent the use of suitable boxes for surplus honey, this one advantage\r\nwill hardly balance the loss. They are said also to be more liable to\r\ninjury from the moth. We want a hive that will unite advantageously as\r\nmany points as possible.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that bees always need air, especially in the\r\ncold.[19] With this in view, we will try to dispose of the vapor or\r\nfrost. If the hive is raised sufficient to let it out, it will let in\r\nthe mice; to prevent which, it should be raised only about one-fourth\r\nof an inch. The hole in the side should be nearly covered with wire\r\ncloth to keep out the mice; but give a passage for the bees; otherwise\r\nthey collect here, endeavoring to get out, and remain till chilled, and\r\nthus perish by hundreds. The boxes on the top must be removed, but not\r\nthe cap or cover; the holes all opened, to let the vapor pass up into\r\nthe chamber; if this is made with perfectly close joints, so that no\r\nair escapes, it should be raised a very little; otherwise not. The\r\nmoisture will condense on the sides and top, when it melts will follow\r\nthe sides to the bottom, and pass out; the rabbeting around the top of\r\nthe hive will prevent its getting to the holes, and down among the\r\nbees. It will be easily comprehended, that a hole between each two\r\ncombs at the top, (as mentioned in the subject of putting on the\r\nboxes,) will ventilate the hive much better than where there is but one\r\nor two, or where there is a row of several, and all are between two\r\ncombs.\r\n\r\n      [19] It is presumed that the inexperienced will soon learn to\r\n      distinguish such bees, as die from old age or natural causes,\r\n      from those affected by the cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nBUT LITTLE RISK WITH GOOD STOCKS.\r\n\r\nAll _good stocks_ may be wintered in this way, with but little risk in\r\nmost situations. Whether in the bleak north-wind, buried in a\r\nsnow-bank, or situated warm and pleasant, it will make no great\r\ndifference. The mice cannot enter; the holes give them air, and carry\r\noff moisture, &c. But second-rate stocks are not equally safe in cold\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF KEEPING SECOND-RATE STOCKS OUT OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\nIt has been strongly urged, without regard to the strength of the\r\nstock, to keep them all out of the sun; because an occasional warm day\r\nwould call out the bees, when they get on the snow, and perish; this is\r\na loss, to be sure, but there is such a thing as inducing a greater one\r\nby endeavoring to avoid this. I have said in another place that second\r\nrate or poor stocks might occasionally starve, with plenty of stores in\r\nthe hive, on account of frosty combs. If the hive is kept from the sun,\r\nin the cold, the periods of temperate weather might not occur as often,\r\nas the bees would exhaust the honey within their circle or cluster. But\r\non the contrary, when the sun can strike the hive, it warms up the\r\nbees, and melts the frost more frequently. The bees may then go among\r\ntheir stores and obtain a supply, generally, as often as needed. We\r\nseldom have a winter without sunny days enough for this purpose; but\r\nshould such an one occur, stocks of this class should be brought into a\r\nwarm room, once in four or five days, for a few hours at a time, to\r\ngive them a chance to get at the honey. Stocks much below second-rate\r\ncannot be wintered successfully in this climate; the only place for\r\nthem is the warm room. I have known bees thoroughly covered in a\r\nsnow-drift, and their owner was at considerable trouble to shovel the\r\nsnow away, fearing it would smother them. This is unnecessary, when\r\nprotected from the mice and ventilated as just directed; a snow-bank is\r\nabout as comfortable a place as they can have, except in the house.\r\nWhen examined a short time after being so covered, the snow for a space\r\nof about four inches on every side of the hive is found melted, and\r\nnone but quite poor stocks would be likely to suffer with this\r\nprotection. A little snow around the bottom, without a vent in the side\r\nof the hive, might smother them.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF SNOW CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\nAs for bees getting on the snow, I apprehend that not many more are\r\nlost there, than on the frozen earth; that is, in the same kind of\r\nweather. I have seen them chilled, and lost on the ground by hundreds,\r\nwhen a casual observer would not have noticed them; whereas, had they\r\nbeen on the snow, at the distance of several rods, every bee would have\r\nbeen conspicuous. Snow is not to be dreaded as much as chilly air.\r\nSuppose a hive stands in the sun throughout the winter, and bees are\r\nallowed to leave when they choose, and a portion are lost on the snow,\r\nand that it was possible to number all that were lost by getting\r\nchilled, throughout the season, on the bare earth--the proportion (in\r\nmy opinion) lost on the snow would not be one in twenty. A person that\r\nhas not closely observed during damp or chilly weather, in April, May,\r\nor even the summer months, has no adequate conception of the number.\r\nYet, I do not wish to be understood that it is of no consequence what\r\nare lost on the snow, by any means. On the contrary, a great many are\r\nlost, that might be saved with proper care. But I would like to impress\r\nthe fact, that frozen earth is not safe without warm air, any more than\r\nsnow, when crusted, or a little hard. Even when snow is melting, it is\r\nsolid footing for a bee; they can and do rise from it, with the same\r\nease as from the earth. Bees that perish on snow in these\r\ncircumstances, would be likely to be lost if there was none.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOCKS TO BE PROTECTED ON SOME OCCASIONS.\r\n\r\nThe worst time for them to leave the hive is immediately after a new\r\nsnow has fallen, because if they light on it then, it does not sustain\r\ntheir weight; and they soon work themselves down out of the rays of the\r\nsun, and perish. Should it clear off pleasant, after a storm of this\r\nkind, a little attention will probably be remunerated. Also, when the\r\nweather is moderately warm, and not sufficiently so to be safe, they\r\nshould be kept in, whether snow is on the ground or otherwise.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, a wide board should be set up before the hive to\r\nprotect it from the sun, at least above the entrance in the side. But\r\nif it grows sufficiently warm so that bees leave the hive when so\r\nshaded, it is a fair test by which to tell when it will do to let them\r\nhave a good chance to sally out freely, except in cases of a new snow,\r\nwhen it is advisable to confine them to the hive. The hive might be let\r\ndown on the floor-board, and the wire-cloth cover the passage in the\r\nside, and made dark for the present; raising the hive at night again,\r\nas before. I have known hundreds of stocks wintered successfully\r\nwithout any such care being taken, and the bees allowed to come out\r\nwhenever they chose to do so. Their subsequent health and prosperity\r\nproving that it is not altogether ruinous. It has been recommended to\r\nenclose the whole hive by a large box set over it, and made perfectly\r\ndark, with means for ventilation, &c. (A snow-bank would answer equally\r\nwell, if not better.) For large families it would do well enough, as\r\nwould also other methods. But I would much rather take the chances of\r\nletting them all stand in the sun, and issue as they please, than to\r\nhave the warmth of the sun entirely excluded from the moderate-sized\r\nfamilies. I never knew a whole stock lost by this cause alone.[20] Yet,\r\nI have known a great many starved, merely because the sun was not\r\nallowed to melt the frost on the combs, and give them a chance to get\r\nat their stores.\r\n\r\n      [20] Vide other causes of loss, a few pages back.\r\n\r\n\r\nDO THE BEES EAT MORE WHEN ALLOWED TO COME OUT OCCASIONALLY IN WINTER?\r\n\r\nBesides the loss of bees on the snow when standing in the sun, and\r\ntaking an airing occasionally, there are some economical bee-keepers\r\nwho urge this disadvantage, \"that every time bees come out in winter\r\nthey discharge their excrement, and eat more honey in consequence of\r\nthe vacant room.\" What a ridiculous absurdity it would be to apply this\r\nprinciple to the horse, whose health, strength, and vital heat is\r\nsustained by the assimilation of food! and the farmer is not to be\r\nfound who would think of saving his provender by the same means. That\r\nbees are supported in cold weather on the same principle is indicated\r\nstrongly, if not conclusively.\r\n\r\nIs it not better (if what has been said on the subject of wintering\r\nbees is correct) to keep our bees warm and comfortable when\r\npracticable, as a means of saving honey?\r\n\r\nTo winter bees in the best manner, considerable care is required.\r\nWhenever you are disposed to neglect them, you should bear in mind that\r\none early swarm is worth two late ones; their condition in spring will\r\noften decide this point. Like a team of cattle or horses when well\r\nwintered, they are ready for a good season's work, but when poorly\r\nwintered have to recruit a long time before they are worth much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nSAGACITY OF BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nARE NOT BEES DIRECTED ALONE BY INSTINCT?\r\n\r\nOn this subject I have but little to say, as I have failed to discover\r\nanything uncommonly remarkable, separate and distinct in one swarm,\r\nthat another would not exhibit. I have found one swarm guided alone by\r\ninstinct, doing just what another would under the same circumstances.\r\n\r\nWriters, not contented with the astonishing results of instinct, with\r\ntheir love of the marvellous, must add a good share of reason to their\r\nother faculties,--\"an adaptation of means to ends, that reason alone\r\ncould produce.\" It is very true, without close inspection, and\r\ncomparing the results of different swarms in similar cases, one might\r\narrive at such conclusion. It is difficult, as all will admit, \"to tell\r\nwhere instinct ends, and reason begins.\" Instances of sagacity, like\r\nthe following, have been mentioned. \"When the weather is warm, and the\r\nheat inside is somewhat oppressive, a number of bees may be seen\r\nstationed around the entrance, vibrating their wings. Those inside will\r\nturn their heads towards the passage, while those outside will turn\r\ntheirs the other way. A constant agitation of air is thus created,\r\nthereby ventilating the hive more effectually.\" _All full stocks do\r\nthis in hot weather._\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THEY DO WITH PROPOLIS.\r\n\r\n\"A snail had entered the hive and fixed itself against the glass side.\r\nThe bees, unable to penetrate it with their stings, the cunning\r\neconomists fixed it immovably, by cementing merely the edge of the\r\norifice of the shell to the glass with resin, (propolis), and thus it\r\nbecame a prisoner for life.\" Now the instinct that prompts the\r\ngathering of propolis in August, and filling every crack, flaw, or\r\ninequality about the hive, would cement the edges of the snail-shell to\r\nthe glass, and a small stone, block of wood, chip, or any substance\r\nthat they are unable to remove, would be fastened with it in the same\r\nmanner. The edges or bottom of the hive, when in close proximity to the\r\nbottom, is joined to it with this substance. Whatever the obstacle may\r\nbe, it is pretty sure to receive a coating of this. The stoppers for\r\nthe holes at the top are held in their places on the same principle;\r\nand the unaccountable sagacity that once fastened a little door, might\r\npossibly be nothing more than the same instinct.\r\n\r\nAnother principle, I think, will be found to be universal with them,\r\ninstead of sagacious reasoning.\r\n\r\nWhenever the combs in a hive have been broken, or when combs have been\r\nadded, as was mentioned in the chapter on fall management, the first\r\nduty of the bees appears to be to fasten them as they are; when the\r\nedges are near the side of the hive, or two combs in contact, a portion\r\nof wax is detached and used for joining them together, or to the side.\r\n\r\n\r\nMENDING BROKEN COMBS.\r\n\r\nWhere two combs do not touch, and yet are close together, a small bar\r\nis constructed from one to the other, preventing any nearer approach.\r\n(This may be illustrated by turning the hive a few inches from the\r\nperpendicular after being filled with combs in warm weather.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING PASSAGES TO EVERY PART OF THEIR COMBS.\r\n\r\nShould nearly all the combs in the hive become detached from any cause,\r\nand lie on the bottom in one \"grand smash of ruin,\" their first steps\r\nare, as just described, pillars from one to the other to keep them as\r\nthey are. In a few days, in warm weather, they will have made passages\r\nby biting away combs where they are in contact, throughout every part\r\nof the mass; little columns of wax below, supporting the combs\r\nabove,--irregular, to be sure, but as well as circumstances admit. Not\r\na single piece can be removed without breaking it from the others, and\r\nthe whole will be firmly cemented together. A piece of comb filled with\r\nhoney, and sealed up, may be put in a glass box with the ends of these\r\ncells so sealed, touching the glass. The principle of allowing no part\r\nof their tenement to be in a situation inaccessible, is soon\r\nmanifested. They immediately bite off the ends of the cells, remove the\r\nhoney that is in the way, and make a passage next to the glass, leaving\r\na few bars from it to the comb, to steady and keep it in its position.\r\nA single sheet of comb lying flat on the bottom-board of a populous\r\nswarm is cut away under side, for a passage in every direction,\r\nnumerous little pillars of wax being left for its support. How any\r\nperson in the habit of watching their proceedings, with any degree of\r\nattention, could come at the conclusion that the bees raised such comb\r\nby mechanical means and then put under the props for its support, is\r\nsomewhat singular. Their efforts united for such a purpose like\r\nreasonable beings, I never witnessed.\r\n\r\nThese things, considered as the effect of instinct, are none the less\r\nwonderful on that account. I am not sure but the display of wisdom is\r\neven greater than if the power of planning their own operations had\r\nbeen given them.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned these, to show that a course of action called forth by\r\nthe peculiar situation of one family, would be copied by another in a\r\nsimilar emergency, without being aware of its ever being done before.\r\nWere I engaged in a work of fiction, I might let fancy reign and\r\nendeavor to amuse, but this is not the object. Let us endeavor then to\r\nbe content with truth, and not murmur with its reality. When we take a\r\nsurvey of the astonishing regularity with which they construct their\r\ncombs without a teacher, and remember that the waxen material is formed\r\nin the rings of their body, that for the first time in life, without an\r\nexperienced leader's direction, they apply a claw to detach it, that\r\nthey go forth to the fields and gather stores unbidden by a tyrant's\r\nmandate, and throughout the whole cycle of their operations, one law\r\nand power governs. Whoever would seek mind as the directing power, must\r\nlook beyond the sensorium of the bee for the source of all we behold in\r\nthem!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nSTRAINING HONEY AND WAX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen about to remove the contents of a hive, I have never found it\r\nnecessary to use all the precautions often recommended to prevent the\r\naccess of bees. I have seen it stated that a room in which there was a\r\nchimney open, would be unsuitable, as the bees would scent the honey,\r\nand thus find their way down into the room. I never was thus troubled\r\nby their perpendicular travelling. It is true, if the day was warm, and\r\na door or window was standing open, the bees would find their way in\r\nduring a scarcity of honey. But with doors and windows closed no\r\ndifficulty need be apprehended.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF REMOVING COMBS FROM THE HIVE.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient way to remove combs from the hive is to take off\r\none of its sides, but this is apt to split the boards, if it was\r\nproperly nailed, and injure it for subsequent use. With tools such as\r\nhave been described, it may be done very nicely, and leave the hive\r\nwhole. The chisel should have the bevel all on one side, like those\r\nused by carpenters. When you commence, turn the flat side next the\r\nboard of the hive, and the bevel crowded by the combs will follow it\r\nclose the whole length; with the other tool they are cut across the\r\ntop, and readily lifted out. If preferred, they may be cut across near\r\nthe centre and take out half a sheet at a time; this is sometimes\r\nnecessary on account of the cross-sticks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT METHODS OF STRAINING HONEY.\r\n\r\nSuch combs as are taken from the middle or vicinity of brood-cells, are\r\ngenerally unfit for the table; such should be strained. There are\r\nseveral methods of doing it. One is, to mash the comb and put it in a\r\nbag, and hang it over some vessel to catch the honey as it drains out.\r\nThis will do very well for small quantities in warm weather, or in the\r\nfall before there is any of it candied. Another method is to put such\r\ncombs into a colander, and set this over a pan, and introduce it into\r\nan oven after the bread is out. This melts the combs. The honey and a\r\nportion of the wax run out together. The wax rises to the top and cools\r\nin a cake. It is somewhat liable to burn, and requires some care. Many\r\nprefer this method, as there is less taste of bee-bread, no cells\r\ncontaining it being disturbed, but all the honey is not certain to\r\ndrain out without stirring it. If disposed, two qualities may be made,\r\nby keeping the first separate. Another method is merely to break the\r\ncombs finely, and put them into a colander, and allow the honey to\r\ndrain out without much heat, and afterwards skim off the small\r\nparticles that rise to the top, or when very particular, pass the honey\r\nthrough a cloth, or piece of lace. But for large quantities, a more\r\nexpeditious mode is to have a can and strainer, made for the purpose,\r\nwhere fifty pounds or more can be worked out at once. The can is made\r\nof tin, twelve or fourteen inches deep, by about ten or twelve\r\ndiameter, with handles on each side at the top, for lifting it. The\r\nstrainer is just enough smaller to go down inside the can; the height\r\nmay be considerably less, providing there are handles on each side to\r\npass out at the top; the bottom is perforated with holes like a\r\ncolander, combs are put into this, and the whole set into a kettle of\r\nboiling water, and heated without any risk of burning, until all the\r\nwax is melted, (which may be ascertained by stirring it,) when it may\r\nbe taken out. All the wax, bee-bread, &c., will rise in a few minutes.\r\nThe strainer can now be raised out of the top and set on a frame for\r\nthe purpose, or by merely tipping it slightly on one side it will rest\r\non the top of the can. It might be left to cool before raising the\r\nstrainer, were it not liable to stick to the sides of the can; the\r\nhoney would be full as pure, and separate nearly as clean from the wax\r\nand bee-bread, &c. When raised out before cooling, the contents should\r\nbe repeatedly stirred, or considerable honey will remain. Two qualities\r\nmay be made by keeping the first that runs through separate from the\r\nlast, (as stirring it works out the bee-bread). Even a third quality\r\nmaybe obtained by adding a little water, and repeating the process.\r\nThis is worth but little. By boiling out the water, without burning,\r\nand removing the scum, it will do to feed bees. By adding water until\r\nit will just bear a potato, boiling and skimming, and letting it\r\nferment, it will make metheglin, or by letting the fermentation proceed\r\nit will make vinegar. Honey that has been heated thoroughly, will not\r\ncandy as readily as when strained without heat. A little water may be\r\nadded to prevent its getting too hard; but should it get so in cold\r\nweather, it can at any time be warmed, and water added until it is of\r\nthe right consistence.\r\n\r\n\r\nGETTING OUT WAX--DIFFERENT METHODS.\r\n\r\nSeveral methods have been adopted for separating the wax. I never found\r\nany means of getting out the _whole_. Yet I suppose I came as near it\r\nas any one. Some recommend heating it in an oven, similar to the method\r\nof straining honey through the colander, but I have found it to waste\r\nmore than when melted with water. A better way for small quantities, is\r\nto half fill a coarse stout bag with refuse comb and a few\r\ncobble-stones to sink it, and boil it in a kettle of water, pressing\r\nand turning it frequently till the wax ceases to rise. When the\r\ncontents of the bag are emptied, by squeezing a handful, the particles\r\nof wax may be seen, and you may thereby judge of the quantity thrown\r\naway. For large quantities the foregoing process is rather tedious. It\r\ncan be facilitated by having two levers four or five feet long and\r\nabout four inches wide, and fastened at the lower end by a strong\r\nhinge. The combs are put into a kettle of boiling water, and will melt\r\nalmost immediately; it is then put into the bag, and taken between the\r\nlevers in a wash-tub or other large vessel and pressed, the contents of\r\nthe bag shaken, and turned, several times during the process, and if\r\nneed be returned to the boiling water and squeezed again. The wax, with\r\na little water, is now to be remelted and strained again through finer\r\ncloth, into vessels that will mould it into the desired shape. As the\r\nsediment settles to the bottom of the wax when melted, a portion may be\r\ndipped off nearly pure without straining.\r\n\r\nWax in cool weather may be whitened in a short time in the sun, but it\r\nmust be in very thin flakes; it is readily obtained in this shape by\r\nhaving a very thin board or shingle, which should be first thoroughly\r\nwet, and then dipped into pure melted wax; enough will adhere to make\r\nit the desired thickness, and will cool instantly on being withdrawn.\r\nDraw a knife along the edges, and it will readily cleave off. Exposed\r\nto the sun in a window or on the snow, it will become perfectly white,\r\nwhen it can be made into cakes for market, where it commands a much\r\nhigher price than the yellow. It is said there is a chemical process\r\nthat whitens it readily, but I am not acquainted with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nPURCHASING STOCKS AND TRANSPORTING BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the reader has no bees, and yet has had interest or patience to\r\nfollow me thus far, it is presumptive evidence that he would possess\r\nthe requisite perseverance to take charge of them. It would be well,\r\nhowever, to remember the anxieties, perplexities, and time necessary to\r\ntake the proper care, as well as the advantages and profit.\r\n\r\nBut if you are disposed to try the experiment, very likely some\r\ndirections for a commencement would be acceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY THE WORD LUCK IS APPLIED TO BEES.\r\n\r\nThere has been so much uncertainty in stock of this kind, that the word\r\n_luck_ has been made to express too much. Some have been successful,\r\nwhile others have failed entirely; this has suggested the idea that\r\n_luck_ depended on the manner that the stocks were obtained; and here\r\nagain there seems to be a variety of opinions, as is the case always,\r\nwhen a thing is guessed at. One will assert that the \"fickle dame\" is\r\ncharmed into favor by stealing a stock or two to begin with, and\r\nreturning them after a start. Another, (a little more conscientious,\r\nperhaps) that you must take them without _liberty_, to be sure, but\r\nleave an equivalent in money on the stand. Another, that the only way\r\nto get up an effectual charm, is to exchange sheep for them; and still\r\nanother says, that _bees must always be a gift_. I have had all these\r\nmethods offered me gratis, with gravity, suitable to make an\r\nimpression. And, finally, there has yet another method been found out,\r\nand that is, when you want a few stocks of bees go and buy them, yes,\r\nand pay for them too, in dollars and cents, or take them for a share of\r\nthe increase for a time, if it suits your pecuniary resources best. And\r\nyou need not depend on any _charm_ or mystic power for your success--if\r\nyou do, I cannot avoid the unfavorable prediction of a failure. It is\r\ntrue that a few have accidentally prospered for a few years; I say\r\naccidentally, because when they have no true principles of management,\r\nit must be the result of accident. It is a saying with some, that \"one\r\nman can't have luck but few years at once,\" and others none at all,\r\nalthough he tries the whole routine of charms. Nearly twenty years ago,\r\nwhen my respected neighbor predicted a \"turn in my luck, because it was\r\nalways so,\" I could not understand the force of this reasoning, unless\r\nit belonged to the nature of bees to deteriorate, and consequently run\r\nout. I at once determined to ascertain this point. I could understand\r\nhow a farmer would often fail to raise a crop, if he depended on chance\r\nor luck for success, instead of fixed natural principles. It was\r\npossible that bees might be similar. I found that in good seasons the\r\nmajority of people had luck, but in poor seasons, the reverse, and when\r\ntwo or three occurred in succession, then was the time to lose their\r\nluck. It was evident, then, if I could pass in safety the poor seasons\r\nby any means, I should do well enough in good ones.[21] The result has\r\ngiven me but little reason to complain. My advice therefore is, that\r\nreliance should be placed on proper management, instead of luck,\r\narising from the manner the first stock was obtained. Should any one\r\nfeel disposed to make you a present of a stock or two of bees, I would\r\nadvise you to accept the offer and be thankful, discarding all\r\napprehension of a failure on that account. Or if any one is willing you\r\nshould take some on shares, this is a cheap way to get a start, and you\r\nhave no risk of loss in the old stock. Yet if bees prosper, the\r\ninterest on the money that stocks cost is a mere trifle in comparison\r\nto the value of increase, and you have the same trouble. On the other\r\nhand, the owner of bees can afford to take care of a few hives more,\r\nfor half the profits, which he has to give if another takes them; this\r\nis apt to be the case, especially, with such as have no faith in charms.\r\n\r\n      [21] There are sections of country where the difference in\r\n      seasons is less than in this.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE IN TAKING BEES FOR A SHARE.\r\n\r\nThe rule generally adopted for taking bees is this. One or more stocks\r\nare taken for a term of years, the person taking them finding hives,\r\nboxes, and bestowing whatsoever care is necessary, and returning the\r\nold stocks to the owner with half the increase and profits.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAN MAY SELL HIS \"LUCK.\"\r\n\r\nThere are yet a few persons who refuse to sell a stock of bees, because\r\nit is \"bad luck.\" There is often some grounds for this notion. It might\r\narise under the following circumstances. Suppose a person has a half\r\ndozen hives, three extra good, the others of the opposite extreme. He\r\nsells for the sake of the better price his three best; there is but\r\nlittle doubt but his best \"luck\" would go too! But should his poorest\r\nbe taken, the result would be different, without doubt.\r\n\r\nBut there are cases where an apiarian has more stocks than he wishes to\r\nkeep. (It has been the case with myself frequently.) Persons wishing to\r\nsell, are the proper ones of which to buy. Purchasers seldom want any\r\nbut first-rate stocks, they are generally cheapest in the end. There is\r\nusually a difference of about a dollar in the spring and fall prices,\r\nand five and six dollars are common charges. I have known them sell at\r\nauction at eight, but in some sections they are less.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST-RATE STOCKS RECOMMENDED TO BEGIN WITH.\r\n\r\nFor a beginning then, I would recommend purchasing none but first-rate\r\nstocks; it will make but little difference in the risk, whether you\r\nobtain them in the spring, or fall, if you have read my remarks on\r\nwinter management with attention; I have already said the requisites\r\nfor a good stock for winter, were a numerous family and plenty of\r\nhoney, and that the cluster of bees should extend through nearly all\r\nthe combs, &c. To avoid as far as possible diseased brood, find an\r\napiary where it has never made its appearance, to make purchases. There\r\nare some who have lost bees by it, and yet are totally ignorant of the\r\ncause. It would be well, therefore, to inquire if any stocks have been\r\nlost, and then for the cause--be careful that secondary are not\r\nmistaken for primary causes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD STOCKS ARE GOOD AS ANY, IF HEALTHY.\r\n\r\nWhen it appears that all are exempt, (by a thorough examination, if not\r\nsatisfied without,) you need not object to stocks two or three years\r\nold; they are just as good as any, sometimes better, (providing they\r\nhave swarmed the season previous, according to one author; because such\r\nalways have young queens, which are more prolific than old ones, that\r\nwill be in all first swarms).\r\n\r\nOld stocks are as prosperous as any, as long as they are healthy, yet\r\nthey are more liable to become diseased.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUTION RESPECTING DISEASED BROOD.\r\n\r\nWhen no apiary from which to purchase can be found, but where the\r\ndisease _has made_ its appearance, and you are necessitated to purchase\r\nfrom such, or not at all, you cannot be too cautious about it. It would\r\nbe safest in this case to take none but young swarms, as it is not so\r\ncommon for them to be affected the first season, yet they are not\r\nalways exempt. But here, again, you may not be allowed to take all\r\nyoung stocks; in which case let the weather be pretty cold, the bees\r\nwill be further up among the combs, and give a chance to inspect the\r\ncombs. At this season, say not earlier than November, all the healthy\r\nbrood will be hatched. Sometimes, a few young bees may be left that\r\nhave their mature shape, and probably had been chilled by sudden cold\r\nweather--these are not the result of disease, the bees will remove them\r\nthe next season, and no bad results follow. In warm weather a\r\nsatisfactory inspection can be had no other way, but by the use of\r\ntobacco smoke. Be particular to reject all that are affected with the\r\ndisease in the least; better do without, than take such to begin with.\r\n(A full description has been given of this disease in another place.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULT OF IGNORANCE IN PURCHASING.\r\n\r\nA neighbor purchased thirteen stock-hives; six were old ones, the\r\nothers swarms of the last season. As the old hives were heavy, he of\r\ncourse thought them good; either he knew nothing of the disease, or\r\ntook no trouble to examine; five of the six old ones were badly\r\naffected. Four were lost outright, except the honey; the fifth lasted\r\nthrough the winter, and then had to be transferred. He had flattered\r\nhimself that they were obtained very cheaply, but when he made out what\r\nhis good ones cost, he found no great reason, in this respect, for\r\ncongratulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZES OF HIVES IMPORTANT.\r\n\r\nAnother point is worthy of consideration: endeavor to get hives as near\r\nthe right size as possible, _viz._, 2,000 cubic inches; better too\r\nlarge than too small. If too large, they may be cut off, leaving them\r\nthe proper size. But yet, it often makes an ungainly shape, being too\r\nlarge square for the height. As the shape probably makes no difference\r\nin the prosperity of the bees, the appearance is the principal\r\nobjection, after being cut off.\r\n\r\nAn acquaintance had purchased a lot of bees in very large hives, and\r\ncalled on me to know what to do with them, as he feared such would not\r\nswarm well in consequence; I told him it would be doubtful, unless he\r\ncut them off to the right size.\r\n\r\n\"Cut 'em off! how can that be done? there is bees in 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I expected, but it can be done nearly as well as if empty.\"\r\n\r\n\"But don't you get stung dreadfully?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not often: if it is to be done in warm weather, I smoke them well\r\nbefore I begin; _in very cold weather_ is the best time, then it is\r\nunnecessary; simply turn the hive bottom up, mark off the proper size,\r\nand with a sharp saw take it off without trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some are filled with combs; you don't cut off such, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; I consider all the room for combs in a hive over 2,000\r\ninches as worse than lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you ask to cut mine off? If I could see it done once, I\r\nmight do it next time.\"\r\n\r\n\"The charge will be light; but if you intend to keep bees, you should\r\nlearn to do everything pertaining to them, and not be dependent on any\r\none; I did it before I ever saw or heard of its being done.\" I then\r\ngave him full directions how to manage, but could not persuade him to\r\nundertake.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW LARGE HIVES CAN BE MADE SMALLER.\r\n\r\nA short time after, I attended, on a cold day, with a sharp saw,\r\nsquare, &c. I found his hives fourteen inches square inside, and\r\neighteen deep, holding about 3,500 inches. Of this square, a little\r\nmore than ten inches in height, would make just the right size. To work\r\nconvenient, I inverted the hive on a barrel, set on end, marked the\r\nlength, and sawed it off, without a bee leaving. It was very cold,\r\n(mercury at 6 deg.) The bees came to the edges of the combs, but the\r\ncold drove them back. In a short time I had taken off six; four when\r\ndone were just about full; the other two were so when I began, but they\r\nwere marked and sawed like the rest; when the combs were attached, they\r\nwere severed with a knife, and the piece of the hive thus loose, was\r\nraised off, leaving several inches of the combs projecting out of the\r\nhive. I now cut off the first comb, even with the bottom of the hive.\r\nOn the next comb there were a few bees; with a quill these were brushed\r\ndown into the hive; this piece was then removed, and the bees on the\r\nother side of it were brushed down also. In this way all others were\r\nremoved, and left the hive just full. The other full hive, after it was\r\nsawed on each side, a small wire was drawn through, parallel with the\r\nsheets, and severed all the combs at once; each piece was taken out,\r\nand the bees that were clustered on them brushed back; removing the\r\nloose part of the hive, was the last thing to be done. This last method\r\nwas preferred to the other by my employer; yet it was all performed to\r\nhis satisfaction, no sting or other difficulty about it, except the\r\ntrouble of warming fingers rather frequently. Tobacco smoke would have\r\nkept them quiet during the operation, nearly as well. If preferred, a\r\nhive may stand right side up while sawing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERATE WEATHER BEST TO REMOVE BEES.\r\n\r\nIn transporting your bees, avoid if possible the two extremes of very\r\ncold, or very warm weather. In the latter the combs are so nearly\r\nmelted, that the weight of the honey will bend them, bursting the\r\ncells, spilling the honey, and besmearing the bees. In very cold\r\nweather, the combs are brittle, and easily detached from the sides of\r\nthe hive. When necessitated to move them in very cold weather, they\r\nshould be put up an hour or so before starting. The agitation of the\r\nbees after being disturbed will create considerable heat; a portion of\r\nthis will be imparted to the combs, and add to their strength.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR TRANSPORTING BEES.\r\n\r\nTo prepare for moving them, pieces of thin muslin about half a yard\r\nsquare is as good as anything, secured by carpet tacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECURING BEES IN THE HIVE.\r\n\r\nThe hive is inverted, and the cloth put over, neatly folded, and\r\nfastened with a tack at the corners, and another in the middle.  The\r\ntack is crowed in about two-thirds of its length, it then presents the\r\nhead convenient to pull out. If the bees are to go a great distance,\r\nand require to be shut up several days, the muslin will be hardly\r\nsufficient, as they would probably bite their way out. Something more\r\nsubstantial would then be required. Take a board the size of the\r\nbottom, cut out a place in the middle, and cover with wire cloth, (like\r\nthe one recommended for hiving,) and fasten it with tacks. This board\r\nis to be nailed on the hive. After the nails are driven, with the\r\nhammer start it off about the eighth of an inch; it will admit a little\r\nair around the sides as well as the middle, quite necessary for heavy\r\nstocks. But very small families might be safe without the wire cloth;\r\nair enough would pass between the hive and board, except in warm\r\nweather. New combs break easier than old.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEST CONVEYANCE.\r\n\r\nProbably the best conveyance is a wagon with elliptic springs. But a\r\nwagon without springs is bad, especially for young stocks. Yet I have\r\nknown them moved safely in this way, but it required some care in\r\npacking with hay, or straw, under and around them, and careful driving.\r\nGood sleighing will answer very well, and by some thought to be the\r\nbest time.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIVE TO BE INVERTED.\r\n\r\nWhatever conveyance is employed, the hive should be inverted. The combs\r\nwill then all rest closely on the top, and are less liable to break\r\nthan when right end up, because then the whole weight of the combs must\r\ndepend upon the fastenings at the top and sides for support, and are\r\neasily detached and fall. When moving bees, so reversed, they will\r\ncreep upward; in stocks part full, they will often nearly all leave the\r\ncombs, and get upon the covering. In a short time after being set up,\r\nthey will return, except in very cold weather, when a few will\r\nsometimes freeze; consequently a warm room is required to put them in\r\nfor a short time.\r\n\r\nAfter carrying them a few miles, the disposition to sting is generally\r\ngone, yet there are a few exceptions. In moderate weather, when bees\r\nare confined, they manifest a persevering determination to find their\r\nway out, particularly after being moved, and somewhat disturbed. I have\r\nknown them to bite holes through muslin in three days. The same\r\ndifficulty is often attendant on attempting to confine them to the hive\r\nby muslin when in the house in the winter, except when kept in a cold\r\nsituation. Should any combs become broken, or detached from their\r\nfastenings, in hives not full, by moving or other accident, rendering\r\nthem liable to fall when set up, the hive may remain inverted on the\r\nstand till warm weather, if necessary, and the bees have again fastened\r\nthem, which they do soon after commencing work in the spring. If they\r\nare so badly broken that they bend over, rolls of paper may be put\r\nbetween them to preserve the proper distance till secured. When they\r\ncommence making new combs, or before, it is time to turn the right end\r\nup. While the hive is inverted, it is essential that a hole is in the\r\nside, through which the bees may work. A board should fit close over\r\nthe bottom, and covered, to effectually prevent any water from getting\r\namong the bees, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion I would say, that the apiarian who has followed me\r\nattentively, and has added nothing of value to his stock of\r\ninformation, possesses an enviable experience that all should strive to\r\nobtain.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that \"three out of five who commence an apiary must\r\nfail;\" but let us suppose it is through ignorance or inattention, and\r\nnot inherent with the bees. To the beginner then I would say,--if you\r\nexpect to succeed in obtaining one of the most delectable of sweets for\r\nyour own consumption, or the profit in dollars and cents, you will find\r\nsomething more requisite than merely holding the dish to obtain the\r\nporridge. \"SEE YOUR BEES OFTEN,\" and know at all times their actual\r\ncondition. This one recipe is worth more than all others that can be\r\ngiven; it is at the head of the class of duties; _all others begin\r\nhere_. Even the grand secret of successfully combating the worms,--KEEP\r\nYOUR BEES STRONG, must take its rise at this point. With the above\r\nmotto acted upon, carried out fully, and with perseverance, you cannot\r\nwell fail to realize all reasonable expectations. Avoid over-anxiety\r\nfor a rapid increase in stocks; try and be satisfied with one good\r\nswarm from a stock annually, your chances are better than with more; do\r\nnot anticipate the golden harvest too soon. You will probably be\r\nnecessitated to discard some of the _extravagant_ reports of profits\r\nfrom the apiary. Yet you will find one stock trebling, perhaps\r\nquadrupling its price or value in products, while the one beside it\r\ndoes nothing. In some seasons particularly favorable your stocks\r\ncollectively will yield a return of one or two hundred per cent.--in\r\nothers, hardly make a return for trouble. The proper estimate can be\r\nmade only after a number of years, when, if they have been judiciously\r\nmanaged, and your ideas have not been too extravagant, you will be\r\nfully satisfied. I have known a single stock in one season to produce\r\nmore than twenty dollars in swarms and honey, and ninety stocks to\r\nproduce over nine hundred dollars, when a few of the number added not a\r\nfarthing to the amount. I do not wish to hold out inducements for any\r\none to commence bee-keeping, and end it in disgust and disappointment.\r\nBut I would encourage all suitable persons to try their skill in bee\r\nmanagement. I say suitable persons, because there are many, very many,\r\nnot qualified for the charge. The careless, inattentive man, who leaves\r\nhis bees unnoticed from October till May, will be likely to complain of\r\nill success.\r\n\r\nWhoever cannot find time to give his bees the needed care, but can\r\nspend an hour each day obtaining gossip at the neighborhood tavern, is\r\nunfit for this business. But he who has a home, and finds his\r\naffections beginning to be divided between that and his companions of\r\nthe bar-room, and wishes to withdraw his interest from unprofitable\r\nassociates, and yet has nothing of sufficient power to break the bond,\r\nto what can he apply with a better prospect of success, than to engage\r\nin keeping bees? They make ample returns for each little care.\r\nPecuniary advantages are not all that may be gained--a great many\r\npoints concerning their natural history are yet in the dark, and many\r\nare disputed. Would it not be a source of satisfaction to be able to\r\ncontribute a few more facts to this interesting subject, adding to the\r\nscience, and holding a share in the general fund? Supposing all the\r\nmysteries pertaining to their economy discovered and elucidated,\r\nprecluding all chance of further additions, would the study be dry and\r\nmonotonous? On the contrary, the verification witnessed by ourselves\r\nwould be so fascinating and instructive, that we cannot avoid pitying\r\nthe condition of that man who finds gratification only in the gross and\r\nsensual. It has been remarked, that \"he who cannot find in this and\r\nother branches of natural history a salutary exercise for his mental\r\nfaculties, inducing a habit of observation and reflection, a pleasure\r\nso easily obtained, unalloyed by any debasing mixture--tending to\r\nexpand and harmonize his mind, and elevate it to conceptions of the\r\nmajestic, sublime, serene, and beautiful arrangements instituted by the\r\nGod of nature, must possess an organization sadly deficient, or be\r\nsurrounded by circumstances indeed lamentable.\" I would recommend the\r\nstudy of the honey-bee as one best calculated to awaken the interest of\r\nthe indifferent. What can arrest the attention like their\r\nstructure--their diligence in collecting stores for the future--their\r\nsecretion of wax and moulding it into structures with a mathematical\r\nprecision astonishing the profoundest philosophers--their maternal and\r\nfraternal affection in regarding the mother's every want, and assiduous\r\ncare in nursing her offspring to maturity--their unaccountable display\r\nof instinct in emergencies or accidents, filling the beholder with\r\nwonder and amazement? The mind thus contemplating such astonishing\r\noperations, cannot well avoid looking beyond these results to their\r\ndivine Author. Therefore let every mind that perceives one ray of light\r\nfrom nature's mysterious transactions, and is capable of receiving the\r\nleast enjoyment therefrom, pursue the path still inviting onward in the\r\npursuit. Every new acquisition will bring an additional satisfaction,\r\nand assist in the next attempt, which will be commenced with a renewed\r\nand constantly increasing zest; and will arise from the contemplation a\r\nwiser, better, and a nobler being, far superior to those who have never\r\nsoared beyond the gratifications of the mere animal, grovelling in the\r\ndark. Is there, in the whole circle of nature's exhaustless storehouse,\r\nany one science more inviting than this? What more exalting and\r\nrefining, and at the same time making a return in profits as a\r\npecuniary reward?\r\n\r\nWhat would be the result in the aggregate of all the honey produced in\r\nthe flowers of the United States annually? Suppose we estimate the\r\nproductions of one acre to be one pound of honey, which is but a small\r\npart of the real product in most places; yet, as a great many acres are\r\ncovered with water and forest,[22] this estimate is probably enough for\r\nthe average. This State (New York) contains 47,000 square miles; 640\r\nacres in a square mile will multiply into a little more than\r\n30,000,000, and each acre producing its pound of honey, we have the\r\ngrand result of 30,000,000 lbs. of honey. If we add the States of\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, we have an amount of over 126,000,000\r\nlbs. What it might be by including all the States, those disposed may\r\nascertain. Enough for our purpose is made clear, and that is, a small\r\nitem only of an enormous amount is now secured.\r\n\r\n      [22] It should not be forgotten that forest trees are valuable,\r\n      especially when there is basswood, or even maple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS PUBLISHED BY\r\nJ.

This has been\r\ndrawn from a large number of the best authorities on the subjects\r\nindicated in the title; the numerous analyses of plants and manures are\r\nparticularly valuable, and are not to be found in any other single\r\ntreatise. Those who wish to advance towards perfection in the saving,\r\nmanufacturing, and judging of the comparative value of manures, and in\r\napplying them with the least possible waste to crops, will find in this\r\nbook a vast magazine of suggestions and advice, worth many times its\r\ncost and the labor of perusal.\"--_Albany Cultivator._\r\n\r\n\"The title 'Muck Book' inadequately describes the character of the\r\nwork; for it treats of all kinds of fertilizers, animal, vegetable and\r\nmineral, and in a style to instruct without perplexing. The manner in\r\nwhich the various manures operate, and the means whereby any required\r\ndeficiency in the soil can be supplied, are plainly given; and none\r\nneed waste a horn-pith or an old shoe, as many do, for want of\r\nknowledge how to turn it to advantage.\r\n\r\n\"We recommend the work to intelligent and inquiring farmers, who desire\r\nto make everything tell in the manure heap, and who would keep their\r\nsoil in good heart.\"--_Journal of Agriculture._\r\n\r\n\"From an attentive examination of the pages of this book, I have come\r\nto the conclusion that it is one of the best works extant, on the\r\nprinciples of scientific agriculture, and the best compendium of our\r\nmost recent knowledge of the nature of manures and their adaptation to\r\nparticular soils and crops.\"--_N.E. Farmer._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Browne was, we believe, bred and educated a practical farmer\r\nhimself, and having a general knowledge of geology, chemistry, &c., and\r\nextensive personal knowledge of farming, gardening, &c, in almost every\r\nsoil and climate, having been for five years a traveller and resident\r\nin America, Europe, Western Africa, and the West Indies, his\r\nobservation and experience combined, would render him eminently\r\nqualified for the task. This he has accomplished with credit to\r\nhimself, and no doubt the result will prove it highly advantageous to\r\nthe farming community. It is just such a work as is needed by every\r\nagriculturist, and the very neat and excellent style in which the\r\nenterprising publisher has issued it, will we are very sure commend it\r\nto every friend of the farming interest in the country.\"--_N.Y. Farmer\r\nand Mechanic._\r\n\r\n\"This is a well-written work of over four hundred pages, printed and\r\nbound in the usual handsome and permanent style of Mr. Saxton. The\r\nimportance to every farmer and horticulturist of the great subject of\r\nwhich it treats cannot fail to make this work invaluable to the library\r\nof every man who tills the soil. One feature of this work which pleases\r\nus, and which will make it universally acceptable is, that the subjects\r\nare treated in such a manner as to be easily understood by the 'working\r\nfarmer,' who knows little or nothing of chemical science and learned\r\ntechnicalities. With such a work as this in his hands, the farmer is\r\nenabled to reclaim his lands, impoverished by his own or his ancestors'\r\nmismanagement, and realize abundant crops where nothing would grow to\r\nreward his toil in the ordinary mode of culture.\"--_Phrenological\r\nJournal._\r\n\r\n_The following is from. Dr. C. T. Jackson, of Boston, the best\r\nAgricultural Chemist in the United States_:\r\n\r\n\r\n    BOSTON, NOVEMBER 6th, 1851.\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: I have the pleasure of acknowledging the receipt of a\r\n    copy of the \"American Muck Book,\" recently published by you, and\r\n    edited by Mr. D. Jay Browne.\r\n\r\n    From an attentive examination of the pages of this book, I have come\r\n    to the conclusion that it is one of the best works extant, on the\r\n    principles of scientific agriculture, and the best compendium of our\r\n    most recent knowledge of the nature of manures and their adaptation\r\n    to particular soils and crops. It cannot be expected that a single\r\n    volume could possibly contain the whole sum of chemical knowledge\r\n    applicable to the science of agriculture; but, on looking over the\r\n    closely-printed and compact tables of analyses, and the abundant\r\n    formulas, which this publication contains, I could not fail to be\r\n    surprised at the industry manifested in preparing it. I was also\r\n    gratified to find it so well adapted to the American system of\r\n    husbandry, and so practical, in its character. Its copious and\r\n    accurate index adds not a little to its value.\r\n\r\n    I shall certainly recommend it to my agricultural friends as a very\r\n    useful book, and one necessary to every scientific farmer.\r\n\r\n    I am, respectfully, your ob't servant,\r\n\r\n    CHARLES T. JACKSON, State Assayist, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n    To C. M. SAXTON, Esq., New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FARM BOOK,\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nCOMPEND OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nCONTAINING A CONCISE AND PLAINLY-WRITTEN EXPOSITION OF DUTIES PERTAINING\r\nTO THE CULTIVATION OF THE EARTH, THE MANAGEMENT OF THE FARM, &C., &C.,\r\nON PRACTICAL SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\nBY R. L. ALLEN.\r\n\r\n_The cheapest and most valuable book for a farmer ever printed; being\r\na complete guide, both practical and scientific, for the_\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF THE FARM.\r\n\r\n                           *      *      *\r\n\r\nBesides the varied practical knowledge which this book imparts, and\r\nwhich is indispensable to the proper management of every department of\r\nagriculture, it gives the elements of other information highly\r\nnecessary to a successful farmer, as History, Geology, Chemistry,\r\nBotany, Physiology, and Mechanics. These branches of knowledge are\r\ngiven as applicable to agricultural pursuits, and when properly\r\nunderstood will essentially aid and assist the farmer. In fact, a\r\nknowledge of these sciences is a sure key to wealth for any\r\nagriculturist. It gives the modes of preparation, and the effects of\r\nall kinds of manures; the origin, texture, divisions, and description\r\nof every variety of soil; the economy of sowing, reaping, and mowing,\r\nirrigation, and draining; cultivation of the grasses, clovers, grains,\r\nand roots; _Southern_ and miscellaneous products, as cotton, hemp,\r\nflax, the sugar cane, rice, tobacco, hops, madder, woad, &c.; the\r\nrearing of fruit--apples, pears, peaches, plums, grapes, &c.; farm\r\nbuildings, hedges, &c.; with the best methods of planting, cultivating,\r\nand preparation for market. Illustrated by 100 engravings.\r\n\r\nThe reader can form some idea of the above work, from the fact that it\r\ntreats of 800 _different subjects_ important to a farmer. It contains\r\n354 pages, and is beautifully bound in cloth, suitable for a library.\r\n_Price only One Dollar._\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTICES OF THE PRESS.\r\n\r\nThe author has been one of the most able contributors to the\r\nagricultural press for the last ten years; aside from this, he is a\r\npractical farmer and stock-breeder, and consequently knows from his own\r\nexperience what he is writing about.--_Commercial Advertiser._\r\n\r\nThis work is by a gentleman of known experience; the work is\r\nexceedingly cheap, and the farmer will find it a valuable book of\r\nreference.--_N.Y. Express._\r\n\r\nIt is in fact a brief encyclopedia on the subjects treated, and the\r\nfarmer will find appropriate Information on almost any subject coming\r\nwithin his reach.--_N.Y. Observer._\r\n\r\nHere is a book for the million, precisely what its title indicates.\r\nCompassed within its pages, the reader will find the subject of soils,\r\nmanures, crops, and animals, treated in a style easily comprehended.--_N.Y.\r\nSpirit of the Times._\r\n\r\nThis work is what might be expected from one so well qualified for the\r\nundertaking.--_Boston Cultivator._\r\n\r\nWhy shall not every good farmer economise his muscles by storing his\r\nmind? We hope this book will find its way into many family and school\r\nlibraries.--_N.Y. Tribune._\r\n\r\nWe think that Mr. Allen's volume, the basis of which is good practical\r\nfarming, as practised by the best cultivators in the United States,\r\nwith an intelligent reference to those principles of science which lie\r\nat the root of all successful practice, is likely to be of as muck or\r\nmore real service to us, than any work on agriculture yet issued from\r\nthe press, and we gladly commend it to the perusal of every one of our\r\nreaders engaged in the cultivation of the land.--_Horticulturist._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nFAMILY KITCHEN GARDENER;\r\n\r\nCONTAINING\r\n\r\nPLAIN AND ACCURATE DESCRIPTIONS\r\n\r\nOF ALL THE\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT SPECIES AND VARIETIES\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nCULINARY VEGETABLES:\r\n\r\nBY ROBERT BUIST,\r\n\r\nAUTHOR OF THE AMERICAN FLOWER-GARDEN DIRECTORY, ROSE MANUAL, ETC.\r\n\r\n                           *      *      *\r\n\r\nNEW  YORK:\r\n\r\nC.
