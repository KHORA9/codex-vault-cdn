The boarding-house\r\nwas preparing for its nap; indeed already half enveloped, but there\r\ncame to Bellair’s nostrils a smell of carpets that brought back his\r\nfirst passage up stairs five years before. The halls were filled with\r\ngreys--dull tones that drove him forth at last. It was November, and\r\nthe day didn’t know what to do next. Gusts of seasonable wind, wisps\r\nof sunshine, threats of rain, and everywhere Bellair’s old enemy--the\r\nterrifying Sabbath calm, without which the naked granite soul of New\r\nYork would remain decently hid. Sundays had tortured him from the\r\nbeginning. It was not so bad when the garment was on--the weave of\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nHe walked east with an umbrella, thinking more than observing, crossed\r\nto Brooklyn and followed the water-front as closely as the complication\r\nof ferries, pier-systems and general shipping would permit. Finally he\r\ncame to a wooden arch, marked Hatmos & Company, the gate of which was\r\nopen. Entering, he heard the water slapping the piles beneath, his eyes\r\nheld in fascination to an activity ahead. In the wonder of a dream,\r\nhe realised that this was a sailing-ship putting forth. On her black\r\nstern, he read\r\n\r\n  _Jade of Adelaide_\r\n\r\nprinted in blue of worn pigment.\r\n\r\nA barkentine, her clipper-built hull of steel, her lines satisfying\r\nlike the return of a friend after years. Along the water-line shone\r\nthe bright edge of her copper sheathing; then a soft black line smooth\r\nas modelled clay where she muscled out for sea-worth, and covered her\r\ndisplacement in the daring beauty of contour. Still above was the\r\nshining brass of her row of ports on a ground of weathered grey, and\r\nthe dull red of her rail. Over all, and that which quickened the ardour\r\nof Bellair’s soul, was the mystery of her wire rigging and folded\r\ncloths against the smoky horizon, exquisite as the frame of a butterfly\r\nto his fancy.\r\n\r\nHis emotion is not to be explained; nor another high moment of his life\r\nwhich had to do with a flashing merchantman seen from the water-front\r\nat San Francisco--square-rigged throughout, a cloud of sail-cloth,\r\nher royals yet to be lifted, as she got underweigh. He knew that\r\nconsiderable canvas was still spread between California, Australia and\r\nthe Islands, but what a well-kept if ancient maiden of the _Jade’s_\r\nspecies was doing here in New York harbour, A. D. Nineteen hundred and\r\nodd, was not disclosed to Bellair until afterward, and not clearly then.\r\n\r\nHe knew her for a barkentine, and in the intensely personal appeal\r\nof the moment he was a bit sorry for the blend. To his eyes the\r\nschooner-rig of mizzen and main masts was not to be compared for\r\nbeauty to the trisected fore. Still he reflected that square-rigged\r\nthroughout, she would be crowded with crew to care for her, and that\r\nher concession to trade was at least not outright. Schooner, bark and\r\nbrig--he seemed to know them first hand, not only from pictures and\r\npages of print, though there had been many long evenings of half-dream\r\nwith books before him--books that always pushed back impatiently\r\nthrough the years of upstart Steam into Nature’s own navigation,\r\nwhere Romance has put on her brave true form in the long perspective.\r\nShips that really _sailed_ were one of Bellair’s passions, like\r\norchards and vined stone-work--all far from him apparently and out\r\nof the question--loved the more because of it.... He watched with\r\nrapt eyes now, estimated the _Jade’s_ length at one-seventy-five\r\nand was debating her tonnage when a huge ox of a man appeared from\r\nthe cabin (while the _Jade_ slid farther out), waddled aft as if\r\nbare-footed, spoke to an officer there, and then held up two brown\r\nhairy, thick-fingered hands, palms extended to the pier--as if to push\r\nBrooklyn from him forever.... The officer’s voice just reached shore,\r\nbut not his words. A Japanese woman appeared on the receding deck.\r\n\r\n“_Jade of Adelaide_,” muttered Bellair, moments afterward.\r\n\r\nA tug was towing her straight toward Staten. He thought of her\r\nlying off the glistening white beach of a coral island two months\r\nhence, surrounded by native craft, all hands helping the big man get\r\nashore.... At this moment a young man emerged from the harbour-front\r\ndoor of the Hatmos office, locking it after him. Bellair came up from\r\nhis dream. Such realities of the city man are mainly secret. It was the\r\nworn surface that Bellair presented to the stranger, a sophisticated\r\nand imperturbable surface, and one employed so often that its novelty\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\n“Where’s she going?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\nBellair smiled at the facetiousness.\r\n\r\n“The _Jade_,” he said gently.\r\n\r\n“Just as far from here as she can get.”\r\n\r\n“Round the world?”\r\n\r\n“I doubt if she’ll come back.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t see many of them any more----”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied the other agreeably enough, “this old dame and two or\r\nthree sisters are about all that call here. Hatmos & Co. get ’em all.”\r\n\r\n“Will you have a little drink?” Bellair inquired. “That is, if you know\r\na place around here. I’m from across.”\r\n\r\nThe other was not unwilling. They walked up the pier together. A place\r\nwas found.\r\n\r\n“Does the _Jade_ belong to the Hatmos people?” Bellair asked.\r\n\r\n“No. We’re agents for Stackhouse. By the way, he’s aboard the\r\n_Jade_--just left the office a half hour ago. The Hatmos son and heir\r\nwent home in a cab, like his father used to, when Stackhouse blew in\r\nfrom the South Seas----”\r\n\r\n“The big man who stood aft as the ship cleared?” Bellair suggested.\r\n\r\n“Hairy neck--clothes look like pajamas?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“That must have been Stackhouse. He’s the biggest man in\r\nPeloponasia----”\r\n\r\nBellair wondered if he meant Polynesia. “You mean in size?”\r\n\r\n“Possibly that, but I meant--interests. Owns whole islands and\r\nsteam-fleets, but hates steam. Does his pleasure riding under canvas.\r\nComes up to New York every third year with a new Japanese wife. Used to\r\nspend his time drinking with old Hatmos--now he’s trying to kill off\r\nthe younger generation. Lives at the _Florimel_ while in New York, and\r\nteaches the dago barboys how to make tropical drinks. If he had stayed\r\nlonger, he would have got to me. Young Hatmos is about finished.”\r\n\r\nBellair breathed deeply, strangely alive. “Where does the _Jade_ call\r\nfirst after leaving here?”\r\n\r\n“Savannah--then one or two South American ports--then around the Horn\r\nand the long up-beat to the Islands.”\r\n\r\n“Why, that might mean four months.” Bellair spoke with a touch of\r\nwistfulness.\r\n\r\nThey emerged to the street at length, and the New Yorker started shyly\r\nback to the pier. The Hatmos man laughed.\r\n\r\n“You fall for the sailing-stuff, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s got me. Do they take passengers?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, if you’re in no hurry. Here and there, some one like you--just\r\nfor the voyage. Two or three on board from here.... One a preacher.\r\nHe’d better look out. Stackhouse hates to drink alone.”\r\n\r\n“Thanks. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nThe _Jade_, far and very little among the liners, had turned south to\r\nthe Narrows and was spreading her wings.... The world began to shut\r\nBellair in, as he crossed the river again. Sunday night supper at the\r\nboarding-house was always a dismal affair; by every manner and means\r\nit was so to-night. The chorus woman of the Hippodrome was bolting\r\nahead of the bell, to hurry away to rehearsal. Nightly she came up out\r\nof the water.... He tried three sea-books that night--“Lady Letty,”\r\n“Lord Jim” and “The Phantom,” but couldn’t get caught in their old\r\nspell. A new and personal dimension was upon him from the afternoon.\r\nHe fell to dreaming again and again of the _Jade_--the last misty\r\nglimpse of her at the Narrows, and the huge brown hands pushing\r\nBrooklyn away.... There is pathos in the city man’s love and need for\r\nfresh air. Bellair pulled his bed to the window at last, surveying the\r\nroom without regard. Long afterward he dreamed that he was out on the\r\nheaving floor of the sea, and that a man-monster came down from the\r\ndeck in pajamas, and pressing his hands against the walls of the cabin,\r\nmade respiration next to impossible for the inmate. There was a key to\r\nthis suffocation, for the air in his room was still as a pool. A lull\r\nhad fallen upon the city before a gusty storm of wind and rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART TWO\r\n\r\nLOT & COMPANY: I\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nBELLAIR regarded himself as an average man; and after all perhaps this\r\nwas the most significant thing about him. He was not average to look\r\nat--the face of a student and profoundly kind--and yet, he had moved in\r\nbinding routine for five years that they knew of at Lot & Company’s.\r\nHis acquaintances were of the average type. He did not criticise them;\r\nyou would not have known that he saw them with something of the same\r\nsorrow that he regarded himself.\r\n\r\nBack of this five years was an Unknowable. Had you possessed exactly\r\nthe perception you might have caught a glimpse of some extraordinary\r\nculture that comes from life in the older lands, and personal contacts\r\nwith deeper evils--the culture of the great drifters, the inimitable\r\npolish of rolling stones. As a usual thing he would not have shown\r\nyou any of this. At Lot & Company’s offices, men had moved and talked\r\nand lunched near and with him for years without uncovering a gleam of\r\na certain superb equipment for life which really existed in a darkened\r\nroom of his being.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was still in preparation. We have not really completed the\r\ncircle of any accomplishment until we have put it in action. Certainly\r\nBellair had not done that, since the Unknowable ended. He had made no\r\ngreat friends among men or women; though almost thirty, he had met no\r\nstirring love affair, at least in this period. He had done the most\r\ncommon duties of trade, for a common reward in cash; lived in a common\r\nhouse--moved in crowds of common men and affairs. It was as if he were\r\na spy, trained from a child, but commanded at the very beginning of his\r\nmanhood, not only to toil and serve in an insignificant post--but to\r\nbe insignificant as well. It was by accident, for instance, that they\r\ndiscovered at Lot & Company’s that Bellair was schooled in the Sanscrit.\r\n\r\nBefore usual he was astir that Monday morning, but late at the office\r\nfor all that. A drop of consciousness somewhere between shoe-buttons,\r\nand a similar trance between collar and tie. In these lapses a half\r\nhour was lost, and queerly enough afterward the old purports of his\r\nlife did not hold together as before. A new breath from somewhere, a\r\ndifference in vitality, and the hum-drum, worn-sore consciousness given\r\nto his work with Lot & Company, had become like an obscene relative,\r\nto be rid of, even at the price of dollars and the established order\r\nof things. It had been very clear as he drank his coffee that he must\r\ngive quit-notice at the office, yet when he reached there, this was not\r\nso easy, and he was presently at work as usual in his cage with Mr.\r\nSproxley, the cashier.\r\n\r\nThe Quaker firm of Lot & Company was essentially a printing\r\nestablishment. During the first half of the period in which Bellair\r\nhad been connected, though he was not stupider than usual, he had not\r\nrealised the crooked weave of the entire inner fabric of the house.\r\nLot & Company had been established for seventy-five years and through\r\nthree generations. Its conduct was ordered now like a process of\r\nnature, a systematised tone to each surface manner and expression. All\r\nthe departments were strained and deformed to meet and adjust in the\r\nlarger current of profit which the cashier had somehow bridged without\r\nscandal for twenty-seven years. Personally, so far as Bellair knew,\r\nMr. Sproxley was an honest man, though not exactly of the manner, and\r\nunderpaid.\r\n\r\nThe cashier’s eyes were black, a black that would burn you, and\r\nunquestionably furtive, although Bellair sat for two years at a little\r\ndistance from the cashier’s desk before he accepted the furtiveness,\r\nso deeply laid and set and hardened were his first impressions. They\r\nwere hard eyes as well, like that anthracite which retains its gleaming\r\nblack edge, though the side to the draft is red to the core.\r\n\r\nMr. Sproxley’s home was in Brooklyn, an hour’s ride from the office--a\r\nlittle flat in a street of little flats, all with the same porches,\r\nbrickwork and rusty numerals. An apartment for two, and yet Mr. and\r\nMrs. Sproxley had not moved, though five black-eyed children had come\r\nto them. The cashier of Lot & Company was a stationary man--that was\r\nhis first asset.... A hundred times Bellair had heard the old formula,\r\ndelivered by firm members to some caller at the office:\r\n\r\n“This is our cashier, Mr. Sproxley. He has been with us twenty-seven\r\nyears. We have found him the soul of honour”--the last trailing off\r\ninto a whisper--a hundred times in almost the same words, for the\r\nLots and the Wetherbees bred true. The visitor would be drawn off and\r\nconfidently informed that Mr. Sproxley would die rather than leave\r\na penny unaccounted; indeed, that his zeal on the small as well as\r\nlarge affairs was frequently a disturbance to the office generally,\r\nsince everything stopped until the balance swung free. Bellair knew of\r\nthis confidential supplement to the main form, because he had taken\r\nit into his own pores on an early day of his employment. The lift of\r\nthat first talk (in Bellair’s case it was from the elder Wetherbee,\r\nan occasional Thee and Thou escaping with unworldly felicity) was for\r\nBellair sometime to attain a similar rock-bound austerity of honour....\r\nAlways the stranger glanced a second time at Mr. Sproxley during the\r\nfirm-member’s low-voiced affirmation of his passionate integrity.\r\n\r\nPassing to the second floor, the visitor would meet Mr. Hardburg, head\r\nof the manuscript and periodical department, for Lot & Company had\r\nfound a good business in publishing books of story and poetry at the\r\nauthor’s expense. Here eye and judgment reigned, Mr. Hardburg’s, on all\r\nmatters of book-dress and criticism; yet within six or seven minutes,\r\nthe formula would break through for the attention of the caller, thus:\r\n\r\n“Lot & Company is a conservative House--that’s why it stands--a House,\r\nsir (one felt the Capital), that has stood for seventy-five years on\r\na basis of honour and fair dealing, if on a conservative basis. Lot &\r\nCompany stands by its agents and employés first and last. Lot & Company\r\ndoes not plunge, but over any given period of time, its progress is\r\napparent and its policy significantly successful.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hardburg’s eyes kindled as he spoke--grey tired eyes, not at all\r\nlike Mr. Sproxley’s--but the light waned, and Mr. Hardburg quickly\r\nrelapsed into ennui and complaint, for he was a living sick man.\r\nThe impression one drew from his earlier years, was that he had\r\noverstrained as an athlete, and been a bit loose and undone ever\r\nsince.... Now Mr. Hardburg would be called away for a moment, leaving\r\nthe stranger in the office with Miss Rinderley, his assistant. With\r\nfluent and well directed sentences, this lady would outline the\r\ntriumphs of Mr. Hardburg from college to the mastery of criticism which\r\nhe was now granted professionally.\r\n\r\n“But what we love best about him,” Miss Rinderley would say, glancing\r\nat the enlarged photograph above his desk, “is the tireless way he\r\nhelps young men. Always he is at that. I have seen him talk here for\r\nan hour--when the most pressing matters of criticism and editorial\r\nresponsibility called--literally giving himself to some one needing\r\nhelp. Very likely he would miss his train for the country. Poor Mr.\r\nHardburg, he needs his rest so----”\r\n\r\nThe caller would cry in his heart, “What a superb old institution\r\nthis is!” and cover his own weaknesses and shortcomings in a further\r\nsheath of mannerism and appreciation--the entire atmosphere strangely\r\nprevailing to help one to stifle rather than to ventilate his real\r\npoints of view.\r\n\r\nSo the establishment moved. The groups of girls going up and down the\r\nback stairs--to count or tie or paste through all their interesting\r\ndays--counted the heads of their respective departments as their\r\ngreatest men; spoke of them in awed whispers, in certain cases with\r\nmaternal affection, and on occasion even with playful intimacy on the\r\npart of a few--but always as a master-workman, the best man in the\r\nbusiness, who expressed the poorest part of himself in words, and had\r\nto be lived with for years adequately to be appreciated and understood.\r\n\r\nMr. Nathan Lot, the present head of the firm, was a dreamer. It was Mr.\r\nSproxley who had first told Bellair this, but he heard it frequently\r\nafterward, came to recognise it as the accepted initial saying as\r\nregarded the Head, just as his impeccable honour was Mr. Sproxley’s\r\nand unerring critical instinct Mr. Hardburg’s titular association.\r\nMr. Nathan was the least quarrelsome man anywhere, the quietest and\r\nthe gentlest--a small bloodless man of fifty, aloof from business;\r\na man who had worn and tested himself so little that you would\r\nimagine him destined to live as long again, except for the lugubrious\r\natmospheres around his desk, in the morning especially, the sense of\r\nimperfect ventilation, though the partitions were but half-high to\r\nthe lower floor and there was a thousand feet to draw from. The same\r\nwas beginning in Jabez, the son, something pent, non-assimilation\r\nsomewhere. However Jabez wasn’t a dreamer; at least, dreaming had\r\nnot become his identifying proclivity. He was a head taller than\r\nhis father with a wide limp mouth and small expressionless brown\r\neyes--twenty-seven, and almost as many times a millionaire.\r\n\r\nJabez was richer than his father, who was the direct heir of the House\r\nof Lot, but his father’s dreaming had complicated the flow of another\r\nhuge fortune in the familiar domestic fashion--Jabez being the symbol\r\nand centre of the combination; also the future head of the House of Lot\r\nand Company--up and down town.\r\n\r\nBellair wondered a long time what the pervading dream of the father\r\nwas. He had been in the office many months, had never heard the\r\nsenior-mind give vent to authoritative saying in finance, literature,\r\nscience or prints; and while this did not lower his estimate at all--he\r\nwas sincerely eager to get at the sleeping force of this giant. Mr.\r\nSproxley spoke long on the subject, but did not know. Mr. Hardburg said:\r\n\r\n“I have been associated with Mr. Nathan for eleven years now. The\r\nappeal of his worth is not eager and insinuating, but I have this to\r\nsay--that in eleven years I have found myself slipping, slipping into\r\na mysterious, _a different_ regard, a profounder friendliness--if one\r\nmight put it that way--for Mr. Nathan, than any I have known in my\r\nwhole career. The fact is I love Mr. Nathan. He is one of the sweetest\r\nspirits I ever knew.”\r\n\r\nBellair was interested in dreamers; had a theory that dreaming was\r\nimportant. When he heard that a certain child was inclined to\r\ndreaming, he was apt to promise a significant future off-hand. He\r\nreflected that even Mr. Hardburg had forgotten to tell him of the\r\ntendency in Mr. Nathan’s case, but determined not to give up.... Once\r\nin the lower part of the city, he passed the firm-head--a studious\r\nlittle man making his way along at the edge of the walk. Bellair spoke\r\nbefore he thought. Mr. Nathan started up in a dazed way, appeared to\r\nrecognise him with difficulty, as if there was something in the face\r\nthat the hat made different. He cleared his voice and inquired with\r\nembarrassment:\r\n\r\n“Are you going to the store?”\r\n\r\nAfter Bellair had ceased to regret speaking, he reflected upon the word\r\n“store.” The president of a great manufacturing plant, content to be\r\nknown as a tradesman--an excellent, a Quaker simplicity about that.\r\n\r\nBellair’s particular friend in the establishment was Broadwell of the\r\nadvertising-desk, a young man of his own age who was improving himself\r\nevenings and who aspired to be a publisher. But even closer to his\r\nheart was Davy Acton, one of the office-boys, who had been tested out\r\nand was not a liar. A sincere sad-faced lad of fifteen, who lived with\r\nhis mother somewhere away down town. He looked up to Bellair as to a\r\nman among men, one who had achieved. This was hard to bear on the man’s\r\npart, but he was fond of the youngster and often had him over Sundays,\r\nfurnishing books of his own and recommending others. Davy believed in\r\nhim. This was the sensation.\r\n\r\nThe only voices that were ever raised in the establishment were those\r\nof the travelling salesmen. The chief of this department, Mr. Rawter,\r\nwas loud-voiced in his joviality. That was _his_ word--“Mr. Rawter is\r\nso jovial.”\r\n\r\nWhen the roaring joviality of Mr. Rawter boomed through the lower\r\nfloor, old Mr. Wetherbee, the vice-president, would look up from his\r\ndesk, and remark quietly to any one who happened near, “Mr. Rawter is\r\nforced to meet the trade, you know.” It was doubtless his gentle Quaker\r\nconception that wine-lists, back-slapping and whole-souled abandonment\r\nof to-morrow, were essentials of the road and trade affiliation.\r\nFrom the rear of the main floor, back among the piles of stock,\r\nreverberating among great square monuments of ledgers and pamphlets\r\nwere the jovial voices of the other salesmen, Mr. Rawter’s seconds, the\r\nMiddle-west man, and the Coast-and-South man--voices slightly muffled,\r\nas became their station, but regular in joviality, and doubtless as\r\nboom-compelling afield as their chief’s, considering their years.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the elder Mr. Wetherbee--Mr. Seth--presided over a\r\ndistinguished silence for the main. His desk was open to the floor\r\nat large. He was seventy, and one of the first to arrive in the\r\nmorning--a vice-president who opened the mail, and had in expert\r\nscrutiny such matters as employment, salaries, orders and expenses\r\nof the travelling men on the road. Mr. Seth was not a dreamer; at\r\nleast not on week-days--a millionaire, who gave you the impression\r\nthat he was constantly on his guard lest his heart-quality should\r\nsuddenly ruin all. The love, the very ardour of his soul was to _give_\r\naway--to dissipate the fortunes of his own and the firm-members, but so\r\nsuccessfully had he fought all his life on the basis of considering the\r\njustice to his family and his firm, that Lot & Company now relied upon\r\nhim, undoubting. Thus often a man born with weakness develops it into\r\nhis particular strength....\r\n\r\nThe son, Eben Wetherbee, was harder for Bellair to designate. He seemed\r\na different force, and called forth secret regard. A religious young\r\nman, who always occurred to Bellair’s mind as he had once seen him,\r\ncrossing the Square a summer evening, a book under his arm, his short\r\nsteps lifted and queerly rounded, as if treading a low-geared sprocket;\r\ntoes straight out--the whole gait mincing a little. Eben was smileless\r\nand a great worker. He had no more to do or say with his father during\r\nworking hours than any of the others.\r\n\r\nSuch was the firm: Mr. Nathan Lot and his son Jabez; Mr. Seth\r\nWetherbee and his son Eben, and Mr. Rawter who had been given a nominal\r\nquantity of stock after thirty-five years’ service. In due course Mr.\r\nSproxley would qualify for this illumination.... And yet not all.\r\nStaring down from the arch over the president’s door was a dour, white,\r\nbig-chinned face, done in oils long ago--almost yellow-white, the\r\nblack shoulder deadening away into the background; small eyes, wide\r\nmouth, but firmly hung--grandfather to Mr. Nathan, but no dreamer;\r\ngreat grand-sire to Mr. Jabez, but nothing loose-mouthed about the\r\nface of this, the original Jabez Lot,--organising genius of the House,\r\nand its first president, spoken of with awe and reverence; the first\r\nmillionaire of the family and builder of its Gramercy mansion....\r\nSuddenly, it had come to Bellair that this was the spirit of the Store,\r\nthis picture was its symbol, that the slow strangulation of the souls\r\nof all concerned had begun in that white head, the planting of this bed\r\nof crooked canes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nOne morning when Bellair was well into his third year with the\r\nprinting-firm, the silence was broken on the lower floor. He was\r\nshaken that day into the real secret of the house. A certain Mr.\r\nPrentidd had been in conversation with Mr. Rawter some moments. The\r\njovial voice of the head-salesman was without significance to those\r\nnear his partition--a part of the routine. Mr. Prentidd had invented\r\na combination ledger and voucher-file that was having some sale in\r\nAmerica, being manufactured and distributed by Lot & Company. Mr.\r\nRawter on a recent trip abroad had been empowered to dispose of the\r\nEnglish rights. The result, it now appeared, did not prove satisfactory\r\nto the inventor. The voice of the latter was raised. One felt the\r\nentire building subside into a quivering hush.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, sir, I don’t trust you. I have heard in fact that the only\r\nway you could hurt your reputation here in New York or on the road\r\nwould be to tell the truth.”\r\n\r\nTo Bellair there was something deeply satisfying in that remark of\r\nthe inventor’s--something long awaited and very good. He saw Mr. Seth\r\narise, his chin moving in a sickly fashion, a very old pathetic Mr.\r\nSeth. He realised that Mr. Rawter had laughed--that something had\r\nbeen burned from that laugh. Mr. Prentidd was hurried forth, and the\r\nnullifying system began. Mr. Jabez emerged from his father’s office\r\nand turning to Broadwell at the advertising-desk, said in a tone\r\nuniversally penetrative:\r\n\r\n“What a pity that Mr. Prentidd drinks. There are few men finer to deal\r\nwith when he is himself.”\r\n\r\nMr. Seth, in his chair again, sitting frog-like and gasping, remarked\r\nto Mr. Sproxley across the distance: “I really must ask Mr. Prentidd to\r\ncome to us earlier in the day. He’s far too worthy a man to disgrace\r\nhimself in this way.”\r\n\r\nBellair wondered that the point of Mr. Prentidd’s remark seemed\r\nentirely lost. As for himself he counted it worthy of regard. The\r\nepisode was but begun. The inventor returned immediately, just as\r\nMr. Rawter was stepping out. The two men met in the main corridor.\r\nIt appeared that Mr. Prentidd repeated a certain question, for the\r\nhead-salesman replied, the roundness of the joviality gone from his\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n“I tell you, Mr. Prentidd, the situation has changed. I could not\r\ndispose of the English order at a better figure to save my soul. I\r\nextracted every cent for you and for the House.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe you. Other matters of the same kind do better. If you\r\nspeak the truth, you made a very bad bargain for yourself and what is\r\nmore important, for me----”\r\n\r\nThe least like an inventor imaginable, a most physical person, Mr.\r\nPrentidd, with a fiery sense of his own rights and a manner as soft as\r\nhis voice was penetrating. He turned a leisurely look of scorn at Mr.\r\nRawter, half-stare and half-smile, then appeared to perceive the elder\r\nMr. Wetherbee for the first time. The old man arose. Bellair felt the\r\nagony of expectancy far back among the stock-piles. The inventor shot\r\nstraight at the vice-president:\r\n\r\n“You’re an old man. I’ll trust your word. You’re an old man and a\r\nQuaker--yes, I’ll take your word. Your man, Rawter, says he could get\r\nonly seven and one-half cents’ royalty for me on my Nubian file from\r\nEngland. I say it’s only half what I should get. Is it true--remember\r\nyou’re old. Is it true?”\r\n\r\nPrentidd’s face had power in it, exasperation and the remains of a\r\nlaugh. It appeared that he was content to take a gambler’s chance and\r\nclose the ugly business on Mr. Seth’s word.\r\n\r\nThe old man’s eye roved. He looked sick and shaken. He found the eyes\r\nof his son Eben which were full of terror and pity and hope.\r\n\r\n“Answer me. Could Lot & Company get no more than fifteen cents\r\naltogether on the English patents?”\r\n\r\nMr. Wetherbee’s lips moved. “That’s all we could get, Mr. Prentidd. I’m\r\nsorry,” he said.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Mr. Prentidd stood there. It was evident that he had\r\nexpected a different answer. True to his promise to take the old man’s\r\nword, however, he turned on his heel and walked out.\r\n\r\nOn the high sloping desk before Bellair’s eyes, a big ledger lay open.\r\nHe had turned during the talk to the transaction of Prentidd--Lot &\r\nCompany. The English disposal had been arranged for at twenty-five\r\ncents the file, royalty. Apparently Mr. Prentidd had agreed upon an\r\neven split, but Lot & Company had taken seventeen and the fraction.\r\n\r\nBellair was ill. The nausea crept down through his limbs, and up to\r\nhis throat. The thing had worked out before him with such surety and\r\nclarity. The head of Mr. Sproxley moved about as if on a swivel, his\r\nbody in writing position still. Presently he stepped down from his high\r\nstool, and came to Bellair’s side. Placing his pen behind his ear, he\r\nlifted the ledger from under Bellair’s eyes, his lips compressed with\r\nthe effort. Then he placed it on his own desk to close it tenderly,\r\nafter which it was taken to its niche in the vault.\r\n\r\nThe office was silent. Just now Bellair’s eyes turned as if subtly\r\nattracted to the place where Eben Wetherbee sat. The young man’s\r\nsmileless eyes, almost insane with apprehension and sadness, were\r\nturned with extraordinary intent upon the place where his father sat.\r\nBellair’s followed. The old man sat plumped in his chair; he gulped,\r\ntried to turn. His face looked as if he heard a ghost whispering. Yet\r\nhe seemed unable to trust himself, hardly daring to meet the eyes that\r\nawaited. His hands lifted to the papers before him, but did not feel\r\nproperly. He seemed a man of eighty. Mr. Eben came forward at last and\r\nasked Mr. Sproxley if he might look at the Prentidd transaction.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t posted yet, Mr. Eben,” said the cashier.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the side door at closing time, Bellair happened to pass a party of\r\nyoung women coming down from the bindery. One was saying:\r\n\r\n“... and Mr. Prentidd was quite helpless after the scene--so that they\r\nhad to call a taxi-cab for him. Isn’t it dreadful he drinks so?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a personal result for Bellair, which he at no time\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\n“We have considered creating a position for you next to Mr. Sproxley,”\r\nsaid the elder Mr. Wetherbee, the second morning following.\r\n\r\nBellair bowed.\r\n\r\n“Since you have been with us less than three years, this is very good\r\ncomment on the character of your services and our hope for your future\r\nwith us----”\r\n\r\n“What additional salary goes with the position?” Bellair had asked.\r\n\r\n“If I followed my own inclination, it would be considerable. I have\r\nbeen able to secure for you, however, but a slight increase----”\r\n\r\nThis was one of Mr. Seth’s little ways. He added hopes of fine quality.\r\nThere was a further point:\r\n\r\n“You will at times handle considerable money and we must insist upon\r\nyour putting in trust for us the sum of two thousand dollars.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t two thousand dollars, Mr. Wetherbee,” Bellair said.\r\n\r\n“Of course, we trust you. It is a form--a form, nevertheless, upon\r\nwhich a valuable relation of this kind should be placed on a business\r\nbasis.”\r\n\r\nBellair repeated.\r\n\r\n“But you have friends----”\r\n\r\n“Not with two thousand dollars’ surety for me--no friend like that.”\r\n\r\n“Banks insist upon this--among those employés who handle much money----”\r\n\r\n“I know--but that amount cannot be arranged.”\r\n\r\n“How much can you put in trust available to Lot & Company in event of\r\nyour departure----”\r\n\r\n“I have slightly less than one thousand dollars----”\r\n\r\n“Could you raise one thousand dollars?”\r\n\r\n“With some effort.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, it will draw interest for you----”\r\n\r\n“I understand these affairs.”\r\n\r\nThe matter was referred to the next day when it was decided to accept\r\nBellair’s amount of one thousand dollars, which Lot & Company could\r\nnot touch without his consent, except in the event of his departure\r\nwith company funds; and which Bellair could not draw without written\r\nstatement from Lot & Company to the effect that he was leaving with a\r\nbalanced account.\r\n\r\nThereafter he was one with Mr. Sproxley in the financial management,\r\nunder the eye of Seth Wetherbee. One by one he learned the points of\r\nthe system. Wherever the accounts had run over a series of years, there\r\nwere byways of loot. These pilferings were not made at once, on the\r\nsame basis that a gardener does not cut asparagus for market from young\r\nroots. The plants were encouraged to establish themselves. After that\r\nthe open market was supplied with a certain output, the rest belonging\r\nto Lot & Company’s table. It frequently occurred to Bellair with a\r\nsort of enveloping darkness that he had the institution in his power;\r\nand with a different but equal force that he had a life position in\r\nall naturalness; that his life would be spent with slowly increasing\r\nmonetary reward for juggling the different accounts--the field of\r\ncrooked canes which was the asparagus-bed of Lot & Company. He did not\r\nlike it. He was not happy; and yet he realised that the adjustments his\r\nnature had already made to the facts, suggested an entire adjustment\r\nlater, the final easy acceptance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nBellair had thought many times of getting out from under the die, but\r\nit never came to him with quite the force as on that Monday morning,\r\nafter watching the _Jade_ fare forth from the Brooklyn water-front.\r\nSomething had turned within him as a result of that little pilgrimage,\r\nsomething that spurred to radicalism and self-assertion. At no time had\r\nBellair credited himself with a fairer honesty than most men. He had\r\nnever given it a large part of thinking. Roughly he had believed that\r\nto be honest is the common lot. The corruption in the office which he\r\ncould not assimilate had to do with extensive ramifications, its lying\r\nto itself. The instant seizing upon Mr. Prentidd’s alleged weakness\r\non the part of the younger Lot and the elder Wetherbee; the action of\r\nMr. Sproxley with the ledger; the subtle will-breaking and spiritual\r\nblinding of all the employés in a process that never slept and was\r\noperative in every thought and pulse of the establishment--the extent\r\nand talent of these, and the untellable blackness of it all, prevailed\r\nupon Bellair with the force of a life-impression.\r\n\r\nBellair’s present devil was a kind of inertia. Granting that the\r\nUnknowable had been charged with periods of intense action of several\r\nkinds, the recent half-decade might be regarded as its reflex\r\ncondition. There is an ebb and flow to all things, and it is easier to\r\nadjust Bellair’s years at Lot & Company as a sort of resting period for\r\nhis faculties, than to accept a constitutional inertia in his case, for\r\nsubsequent events do not quite bear that out. He doubtless belonged\r\nto that small class of down town men who do their work well enough,\r\nbut without passion, who have faced the modern world and its need of\r\nbread and cake, and who have compromised, giving hours in exchange for\r\nessential commodities, but nothing like the full energies of their\r\nlives. It is a way beset with pitfalls, but the unavoidable result of a\r\nsystem that multiplies products and profits and minimizes the chances\r\nfor fine workmanship on every hand. Moreover in Bellair’s case there is\r\na philosophical detachment to be considered. The aims and purports of\r\nthe printing establishment were coldly and absolutely material. These\r\ndid not challenge him to any fine or full expenditure of his powers;\r\nand if he had touched that higher zone of philosophy which makes a\r\nconsecration of the simplest and the heaviest tasks, he had at least\r\nfound it impracticable to make it work among the systems of Lot &\r\nCompany’s business.\r\n\r\nThe two years or more since he was made assistant cashier had brought\r\nmany further items and exhibits. He was now used on the left hand side\r\nof the throne, developed in the darkness-department already overworked,\r\nthe eye of which was Mr. Seth and the hand, Mr. Sproxley. For as yet\r\nBellair believed that even Eben Wetherbee had only suspicions. This was\r\nthe bite of the whole drama. There were men in the building who would\r\nhave died for their conviction that the House was honest. You might\r\nhave told these men that Lot & Company was a morgue of conservatism;\r\nthat having existed under a certain policy for seventy-five years,\r\nwas the chief reason for its changing; that free, unhampered genius\r\nnever found utterance through that House--and any of a dozen clerks\r\nwould have laughed, spoken proudly of unerring dividends and uncanny\r\nstability, granting the rest. But that Lot & Company was structurally\r\ncrooked was incredible except to the few who performed the trick.\r\nBellair knew, for instance, that his best friend in the office,\r\nBroadwell, head of the advertising, was innocent....\r\n\r\nMonday passed without his giving notice. He quailed before the\r\nquestions that would be asked. If it were not for the one thousand\r\ndollars, he would have escaped with a mere “Good-night,” though\r\na panic would have started until the Company was assured of the\r\ninnocence of his departure. As for a panic, Lot & Company had that\r\ncoming, he thought. Now he knew that he would not be able to get his\r\nsurety-deposit until all was made certain in his regard by the firm....\r\n\r\nBellair wasn’t greedy, nor caught in any great desire for wealth. He\r\nhad fallen into the Down town Stream, but did not belong. Every month\r\nhad weakened him. He disliked to lose his beginnings toward competence;\r\nall the subtle pressures of Lot & Company worked upon him not to\r\nchange. There was no other way open. He had been touched by the fear\r\nof fear--a sort of poorhouse horror that dogs men up into the millions\r\nand down to the grave. In a way, he had become slave to the Job. He\r\neven had the suspicion that more men maim their souls by sticking to\r\ntheir jobs than by any dissipation. This is the way to the fear of\r\nfear--the insane undertow of modern materialism.\r\n\r\nHe had tried to find peace outside his work in music and different\r\nphilanthropies, but the people he met, their seriousness, perhaps more\r\nthan anything else, and the vanity of their intellectualism, aroused\r\nhis sense of humour. Bellair believed in the many, but was losing\r\nbelief in himself. Often he had turned back to evenings in the room,\r\nand realised that the days were draining him too much for his own\r\nreal expression of any kind. Always he felt that Lot & Company was\r\ntoo strong for his temper, that his edge was dulled in every contact.\r\nFrom his depressions, he saw ahead only two ways--a life of this, or a\r\nmoment in which he had Lot & Company in his power unequivocably. The\r\nlast was poisonous, and he knew it. He would have to fall considerably\r\nto profit by this sort of thing, but the inevitable conclusion of the\r\nwhole matter, was that the life with Lot & Company was slowly but\r\nsurely _getting him down_.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday noon, Mr. Seth asked him to take to lunch a certain young\r\nstationer from Philadelphia, named Filbrick. They were made acquainted\r\nin the corridor. Passing out, Bellair and his companion met the smile\r\nof Mr. Sproxley. Bellair began the formula of the cashier’s absolute\r\nand autocratic integrity. He did not really hear himself, until he\r\nreached this part:\r\n\r\n“I happen to be in the financial department. Two or three times each\r\nyear, the whole office is thrown into a mess over some little strayed\r\naccount----”\r\n\r\nHe stopped. It was less that he was saying this, than that he had come\r\nso far without a nudge from within. They had passed the big front\r\ndoors, and met the wind of the street before he realised how deep the\r\nmannerism of the establishment had prevailed upon him. The process had\r\npassed almost into fulfilment before the truth within him had stirred\r\nfrom its sleep.... A very grey day. All through that luncheon he had\r\nfound himself at angles from his companion, in strategic hollows,\r\nnever in the level open. It wasn’t that he was different from usual,\r\nbut that he was watching himself more shrewdly. His inner coherence\r\nwas repeatedly broken, though the outer effects were not. He had never\r\nperceived before with such clarity that a man cannot be square and\r\nfriendly to another man, when his mind and critical faculties are busy\r\nappraising him, while his eyes and lips approved and assuaged. Bellair\r\nthat day realised his moral derangement--that he must be ripped open\r\nand his displaced organs corrected once for all, if anything decent was\r\nto come from him ever again.... He was still thinking in mid-afternoon,\r\nin the very trance of these thoughts, when he happened to look into Mr.\r\nSproxley’s face. It seemed to him that there was a movement of most\r\npitiful activities back of the red and black of Mr. Sproxley’s eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was much mental roving on Bellair’s part that week; moments in\r\nwhich the Monday morning abandon returned, and his self-amazement of\r\nthe Tuesday luncheon, upon discovering how deeply his thoughts were\r\nimbedded in the prevailing lie. New York and the salary clutched him\r\nhard at intervals; so that he saw something of what was meant to give\r\nit up; also he saw that dreams are dreams.... Thousands of other young\r\nmen would be glad to do his work, even his dirty work.\r\n\r\nHe had just returned from lunch on Friday when he started, to perceive\r\nthe ruddy face and powerful frame of Mr. Prentidd darken the front\r\ndoor--which he had not done since his voice was last raised. Bellair\r\nwas conscious of Seth Wetherbee hitching up his chair and a peculiar\r\ngasping cough from the old man, but his own eyes did not turn from the\r\ncaller’s face--which moved slowly about, the pale little exchange-miss\r\nbehind the first barrier, attentive to catch the stranger’s eye and\r\nanswer his question. The inventor glanced slowly among desks and\r\ndoors. His eye sought Sproxley, and the furtive black eyes of the\r\nlatter shot down to his ledger as if crippled on the wing. His eyes\r\nheld Bellair and the young man felt the scorn of ages burn through\r\nhis veins--something new to his later life, yet deep in his heart,\r\nsomething he had known somewhere before, as if he had betrayed a\r\ngood king, and his punishment had been to look that king in the eye\r\nbefore he died. Bellair had never hated himself as at that moment,\r\nand certainly never before felt himself identified body and soul with\r\nmodern corruption, as now with scorn like a fiery astringent in his\r\nveins. The eyes of Mr. Prentidd finally settled upon the figure of Mr.\r\nSeth Wetherbee, their rays striking him abeam as it were. The old man\r\nhunched closer if anything, but did not raise his head.\r\n\r\nThe inventor was a physical person; his morals of a physical nature;\r\nhis Nubian file of the same dimension and method of mind--a strong\r\nman who had to do with pain and pleasure of the flesh; his ideas of\r\npossessions were of the world. He moved softly, a soft, dangerous\r\nsmile upon his lips, to the desk of the vice-president and jerked up\r\na chair. The old man had to raise his head. It was as if the scene of\r\nthree years ago was now to be continued, for Bellair saw the sorrowful,\r\nlengthened face of Mr. Eben turn from his desk in the other room and\r\nbend toward his father, whose face was intensely pathetic now in its\r\nforced smile of greeting.\r\n\r\n“You’re not looking well--in fact, you’re looking old, Mr. Wetherbee,\r\nas if you would die pretty soon.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not so strong as I was, Mr. Prentidd.”\r\n\r\nBellair couldn’t have done it, as the inventor did. Had the man stolen\r\nand ruined him--he could not have pushed on after the pathos of that.\r\n\r\n“You’re a dirty old man--and you’ll die hard and soon--for you lied to\r\nme when I trusted you. I suppose you have lied to everybody, all your\r\nlife----”\r\n\r\nThus he baited Mr. Seth feature by feature, pointing out the disorder\r\nof liver, kidney-puffs, the general encroachments of death, in fact.\r\nThen he pictured the death itself--all of a low literary strength as\r\nwas Mr. Prentidd’s cold habit. The answer of Mr. Seth was an incoherent\r\nhelplessness, his lips moving but with nothing rational under the sun,\r\nas if he had been called by some inexorable but superior being to an\r\naltitude where he was too evil to breathe, and begged piteously to be\r\nallowed to sink back and die. It was Mr. Eben who stopped it, coming\r\nforward quietly, his steps rounded, his shoulders bent, his face\r\nseeming brittle as chalk in its fixity. The thing that he said was\r\nquite absurd:\r\n\r\n“You really mustn’t, Mr. Prentidd. It is too much.”\r\n\r\nThe inventor turned to him. His look was that of a man who turns a\r\nlarge morsel in his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you’re right,” he said with a slow laugh. “There is this\r\ndelicacy to old liars. Come give me my check--and I will go.”\r\n\r\n“Your check----” Mr. Eben repeated.\r\n\r\n“Yes, now--the check for the difference which your father’s lie cost me\r\nthree years ago. I have seen the English books----”\r\n\r\nNow young Mr. Jabez Lot came forward:\r\n\r\n“Of course, if there has been error or any breach of contract--of\r\ncourse, you see a check off hand such as you ask is out of the\r\nquestion----”\r\n\r\nThe elder Mr. Wetherbee sank back to his desk; and now the dreamer, Mr.\r\nNathan Lot, appeared with a frightened word of amelioration. Mr. Eben\r\nstood by the caller to the last moment. The latter was not at his best\r\nin this period--his threats and anger amounted to the usual result.\r\nLot & Company refused to deal further, referring him to its attorney.\r\nThe strangest part of it all was the gathering of three around Mr.\r\nSeth Wetherbee’s desk--Mr. Jabez and his father with Mr. Eben. Yet the\r\nconcern of the Lots, father and son, had nothing to do with dangerous\r\nexhaustion of the vice-president.\r\n\r\n“We have beaten him,” the dreamer said softly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mr. Jackson will do the rest,” said Mr. Jabez. Mr. Jackson was\r\nthe attorney.\r\n\r\nBellair, even with his training, had to take it slowly. “Beaten\r\nhim”--that meant that the money had not passed to Mr. Prentidd. It was\r\nnow with the law and the years--millions against a mere inventor. The\r\npsychic slaughtering of the old vice-president did not count--nothing\r\nof words counted. The firm had won, because the firm had not been\r\nknocked down and its pockets rifled--that would have meant loss. Not\r\nhaving been forced to pay, they had won.... Even as Bellair thought\r\nthis out in full, the system of salving had begun from all the\r\nfirm-heads for the benefit of those who heard. It was simply arranged\r\nand stated.... Their worst fears were realised: Mr. Prentidd was\r\ninsane.... Mr. Seth went home early. Bellair knew that Mr. Eben had not\r\nbeen able to turn all responsibility to Mr. Jackson.... That afternoon\r\nBellair reached his decision--in fact, he found it finished within him\r\nafter the scene.\r\n\r\nYet he could not walk out at once, since he must have the amount of\r\nhis surety, the item of interest and salary due. A certain project in\r\nhis mind prevented the possibility of waiting several days for this\r\namount to be detached from Lot & Company. Especially now after the\r\nfinal scene, they would make themselves very sure of his accounts and\r\nintentions. Late that Friday afternoon, it happened that considerable\r\ncash came in after banking hours. Bellair’s custom was to put this in a\r\nsafety-vault until the following day. This time he held out the amount\r\nof his deposit and two years’ interest, together with the amount of his\r\nsalary to date, locking up with the balance his order of release to the\r\naccount of the Trust company. He determined to write a letter to Nathan\r\nLot at once....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nThe City had a different look to him that night in his new sense of\r\ndetachment. There were moments at dinner in which he felt as if he were\r\nalready forgotten and out of place. Bellair had only known the one\r\nlandlady in his five years of New York; yet he knew this one no better\r\nnow than at the end of the first month. Perhaps there was nothing more\r\nto learn. She was anæmic of body, and yet did prodigious tasks, very\r\nquiet, very grey; and days to her were like endless rooms of the same\r\nhouse, all grim and uniform. She had her little ways, her continual\r\nsuspicions, but all her faith was gone. Without church, without\r\nfriends, without any new thought or gossip, her view of the world was\r\nneither magnified nor diminished, but greatly shortened, her eyes were\r\nalmost incredibly dim. There was nothing to love about her. She was not\r\nexcessively clean, nor excellent in cooking. She was like wax-work,\r\na little dusty, her mind and all. Bellair paid her for the week, and\r\nadded a present:\r\n\r\n“Which I forgot on your birthday,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe held it in her hand. It did not seem hers. The apathy extended to\r\nall that was not actually due; all expectancy dead.\r\n\r\n“You mean you are giving this to me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Mr. Bellair,--perhaps you will want it some time again.”\r\n\r\nHe wrote the letter to Mr. Nathan, but decided not to mail it until\r\nthe last thing. He was restless over the irregularity in the money\r\naffair--had to assure himself again and again that he was taking not a\r\ncent that did not belong to him. The boarding-house was in the upper\r\nForties between Broadway and Sixth avenue, and though he usually turned\r\neastward for pleasure, this night he went among his own people, where\r\neven a nickle was medium of exchange. A stimulant did not exactly\r\nrelieve his tension. His sense was that of loneliness, as he chose a\r\ntable in _Brandt’s_ indoor garden.\r\n\r\nA mixed quartette presently broke into song behind him. Bellair’s\r\nthoughts were far from song. He was not expectant of music that would\r\nsatisfy. Still something tugged him--again and again--until he really\r\nlistened, but without turning. It was the voice of the contralto\r\nthat was making an impression deep where his need was. There seemed\r\nan endless purple background to it, like a night of stars and south\r\nwind; the soft, deep volume rolled forth _for him_, and found itself\r\nexpressed without amazement or travail. He turned now. The one voice\r\nwas from the throat of a girl, just a girl, and though it was a gusty\r\nNovember, she was still wearing her summer hat.\r\n\r\nThe face was merely pretty, but the voice was drama; flame of poppies\r\nin the presence of a fabulous orchid. Bellair’s heart may have been\r\nparticularly sensitive to impression that night. The big brilliant\r\nden known as _Brandt’s_ did not seem to have been cast into any\r\nenchantment; and yet it was likely that Bellair knew as much about\r\nmusic natively and by acquisition as any one present. In fact, he had\r\nreached the state of appreciation which dares to enjoy that which\r\nappeals and to say so, having endured for several winters a zeal which\r\nrushed him from one to another musical event, intolerant of all save\r\nclassic symphonies. It wasn’t the music that held him now--a high\r\nflowery operatic matter not particularly interesting nor well-done--but\r\nthe contralto was just a little girl, and the round girlish breast\r\nwhich held nothing miraculous for the many, was sending forth tones\r\nthat quivered through Bellair, spine and thigh, and thrilling his mind\r\nwith a profound passion to do something for the singer--an intrinsic\r\nand clean emotion, but one which made him ashamed. For an instant,\r\nhe felt himself setting out on the great adventure of his life, the\r\nfaintest aroma of its romance touching his senses; something akin to\r\nhis dreams in the prison of Lot & Company, and which he had not sensed\r\nat all since his departure, until this instant. Quickly it passed; yet\r\nhe had the sense that this great romance had to do with the little\r\nsinger.\r\n\r\nAt once he wanted to take her from the other three; dreamed of working\r\nfor her, so that she might have the chance she craved. Of course,\r\nshe wanted something terribly; passionate want always went with such\r\na voice. He saw her future alone. Some vampire of a manager would\r\nhear her. She would tie up--the little summer hat told him that. She\r\nwould tie up, and New York would take her bloom before the flower\r\nmatured--would take more than her little song. Here she was in\r\n_Brandt’s_ already, and singing as if for the angels.\r\n\r\nBellair was four-fifths undiscovered country, as are all men but the\r\nvery few, who dare to be themselves. Already the world was calling\r\nto him sharply for this first step aside from the worn highways of\r\nthe crowd. He had not been normal to-night, even in his room; and his\r\npresent adventure had already summoned forth all the hateful reserves\r\nof his training, as Prentidd’s departure had started the lies through\r\nthe floors and halls of Lot & Company. His heart was calling out to the\r\nlittle singer, that here was a friend, one who understood and wanted\r\nnothing but to give; yet all that he had learned from the world was\r\nbeating him back into the crowd.\r\n\r\nHe saw that the music had hardly penetrated the vast vulgar throng.\r\nNew York is so accustomed to be amused, to dine to music and forget\r\nitself in various entertainments, that the quartette barely held its\r\nown against the routine of eating and drink and the voices of rising\r\nstimulation. It was Bellair who started the little applause when the\r\nfirst number was over. He hated to do it. The clapping of hands drew to\r\nhimself eyes that he did not care to cultivate, but it seemed the only\r\nway just then to help her to make good.\r\n\r\nThe four of the quartette looked at him curiously, appraising his value\r\nas a critic, perhaps. Was he drunk or really appealed to? Was he worth\r\nconsidering? Applause at any price is dearly to be had. They took him\r\nin good faith, since he was not without desirable appearance. The young\r\ngirl and the tenor arose and sang:\r\n\r\n  “_Oh, that we two were Maying----_”\r\n\r\nThe old song was a kind of fulfilment for Bellair, and preciously wrung\r\nhis heart. He had never been Maying; wasn’t sure what sort of holidays\r\nwere pulled off in regular Mayings; but he liked the song, and for all\r\nhe knew the familiar sentiment was evoked bewitchingly. Many others\r\nnow caught the thrall. These things are infectious. From hatred, he\r\ncame to love _Brandt’s_--as if he had come home, and had been long away\r\nhungering--as if this were life, indeed.... They sang the last verse\r\nagain, and sat down for hurried refreshment. The four were very near.\r\nThe young girl caught Bellair’s eye, regarded him shyly for an instant,\r\nand turned to whisper to the bass, who seemed in charge of the four.\r\n\r\n“... Yes, but hurry back. We’ve got to pull out of here.”\r\n\r\nBellair wasn’t dangling. Never had he been more intent to be decent and\r\nhelpful. No one knew this. Even the girl was far from expectant. ...\r\nShe sat down beside him.\r\n\r\n“Hello,” she said. “You don’t live in New York, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, why?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you looked so homesick--when we sang.”\r\n\r\nBellair’s heart sank.\r\n\r\n“I think I was homesick. What may I order for you?”\r\n\r\n“A little Rhine wine--it’s very good here--and a sandwich----”\r\n\r\nThe waiter was standing by. Bellair had to clear his voice before\r\nordering. He was distressed--up to his eyes in gloom that was general\r\nand without name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   5\r\n\r\n“Do you sing in other places to-night?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, we’re just beginning. We’re on Broadway at eleven.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“First at _Pastern’s_, then at the _Castle_.”\r\n\r\nThese places were just without the orbit of extravagance. She knew her\r\nanswer was not exactly a stock-raiser, and added:\r\n\r\n“But I expect to be on the road in the Spring----”\r\n\r\n“Who with?”\r\n\r\nShe mentioned a light opera troupe that was just short of broad and\r\nunqualified approval--like _Brandt’s_ and _Pastern’s_--an institution\r\nas yet without that mysterious toppiness which needs no props and meets\r\nsanction anywhere. These things are exactly ordered.\r\n\r\n“But you are so good--you should be with people who would help you.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him a little scornfully, something of weather and stress\r\nunder the summer hat. She decided to be agreeable. “They all say that,”\r\nshe said wearily.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry. I said just what I thought.”\r\n\r\n“Study--a girl without a cent!” She lowered her voice: “Go with better\r\npeople--before one is invited? Swing to the top of the opera before one\r\nis sufficiently urged?... Why, singing isn’t all. One must do more than\r\nsing----”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe that----”\r\n\r\n“You should try. Singing won’t get you across. You’ve got to act, for\r\none thing.”\r\n\r\nHe was relieved that she did not discuss the angel business, which is\r\nforgotten in so few stories of struggle and failure.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, all that one has to do is to sing--when one sings as you\r\ndo.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard that many times,” she said bitterly, “from people not in\r\nthe fight. They didn’t come to New York on their nerve--as I did. I\r\nmade up my mind not to be afraid of wolves or bears or cars--to take\r\nwhat I could get, and wait until somebody beckoned me higher. Meanwhile\r\n_Pastern’s_ and the _Castle_ and here----”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could do something for you.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes gleamed at him.\r\n\r\n“You need money?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I need money so terribly--that it’s almost a joke--but what do _you_\r\nwant?”\r\n\r\nBellair rubbed his eyes, and smiled a little. “I don’t know what’s the\r\nmatter with me, but I want to do something for you. At least, I did\r\nwant just that.”\r\n\r\n“What happened?”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t a thing to talk or think about, I’m afraid. One starts\r\nthinking, and ends by wanting something--and I didn’t at first. What I\r\nsaid at first I meant--nothing more nor less.”\r\n\r\nHer lips tightened. “If you mean just that----”\r\n\r\nIt raked him within. He did not help her by speaking. Somehow he had\r\nexpected her to see that he had meant well. It was always a mystery to\r\nhim how anything fine could be expected of men, if women were not so.\r\n\r\n“Of course, I have to understand,” she added. “I can do with a poor\r\nroom and poor food, but I can’t get anywhere without clothes.... I must\r\ngo now.”\r\n\r\n“I want you to excuse me if I’ve given you the idea of my being rich.\r\nI’m not, but I might help you some. How late do you work?”\r\n\r\n“One o’clock.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you last?”\r\n\r\n“At the _Castle_.”\r\n\r\n“And what time do you get there?”\r\n\r\n“About eleven-thirty.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be there. Sing ‘_Maying_’ for an encore----”\r\n\r\nShe made believe that she trusted him.\r\n\r\n“We’ll sing it at the _Castle_ the last thing,” she said, leaving\r\nhastily.\r\n\r\nNo ease had come to him. His thoughts now were not the same as those\r\nwhich had come during the singing. He tried to put them away. He didn’t\r\nlike the idea of giving her money. He knew that she didn’t expect to\r\nsee him again; also that if he did come she would accept the service of\r\na stranger, and give in return as little as she could. How explicit she\r\nwas, already touched with the cold stone of the world. He did want to\r\nhelp her, and it had been pure at first. Talk as usual had broken the\r\nbeauty of that. Sophistication and self-consciousness had come; her\r\nface changing more and more as the moments passed after the song. New\r\nYork had taught them each their parts. It had been her thought from the\r\nfirst that he was looking for prey, but it had been very far from his.\r\n\r\nBellair was not without imagination. He saw himself following this\r\ngirl in a future time, playing the part he had despised in other\r\nmen--the dumb, slaving, enduring male; she continually expectant of\r\nhis services, petulant, unreasonable without them. For the first time\r\nthe question came to him: Is there not a queer sort of conquest in the\r\nlives of such men?... She was for herself; had it all planned out, the\r\nwaiting, and what she would give on the way up, beside her song. It\r\nwould not be much; as little as possible, in fact; but as much as was\r\nabsolutely demanded. Bellair in the present state of mind seemed to\r\nobject to all this less than what she wanted of the world--praise and\r\nfame.\r\n\r\n“She’s just a little girl after all,” he muttered. “She ought to have\r\nher chance.”\r\n\r\nHe added (easing the conception a little for his own peace) that she\r\nwas only franker and more outspoken than other women he had known; that\r\nthey all wanted money and place, and wanted men who could furnish such\r\nthings. Suddenly it occurred that the incident automatically supplied\r\nthe final break with Lot & Company and New York. He laughed aloud....\r\nHe might borrow enough in time to make up the amount he gave her for\r\nmorning, but that would certainly be a betrayal of the fiery urge that\r\nhad whipped him all week to cross over into a new life and burn the\r\nlast bridge.\r\n\r\nHe took his bags down to the station, arranging with the landlady\r\nto have his goods stored for the present. After that he rambled, a\r\ngrateful freshness in the cool wind. His steps led through darker\r\nstreets, where he startled the misery from the faces of the forbidden\r\nwho took a chance on him. Their voices _would_ whine; they couldn’t\r\nhelp it, and all they wanted in the world was money.... He was at the\r\n_Castle_ before the quartette came.... They sang and Bellair dreamed.\r\n\r\nHe had never made pretence of other than the commonest lot; yet he\r\nconned now an early manhood that made later years utterly common. He\r\nfollowed the enticements of the sea, of the future, the singing-girl\r\nnever far away, the rest shadows and sadness.... He must do something\r\nfor her.... Rich natural tones winged forth from the breast of a maid,\r\nfrom shoulders so delicate and white. He would make and keep her great;\r\nhere was something to do, to work for. It was like finding the ultimate\r\nsecret. He knew now what had been the matter all the time--nothing\r\nto work for.... He would stand between her and all that he knew was\r\nrotten--the crowds like this at the _Castle_, the blurred face of the\r\ntenor which was both sharp and soft, the tired, tawdry soprano, the\r\nstupid animal of a bass. And Bellair, in the magnanimity of his heart’s\r\neffusion, included himself among the forces of destruction. He would\r\nkeep her from the worst of himself, by all means.... She kept her\r\npromise, and arose with the tenor at last:\r\n\r\n  “_Oh, that we two were Maying----_”\r\n\r\n... New York and all the rest reversed again in his mind. It wasn’t\r\nrotten, but lavish to furnish everything for money--so much that men\r\nand women were lost in the offerings, and did not know what to choose.\r\nYet it was man’s business to choose. Bellair listened as one across the\r\nworld; as if he had been gone a year and was thirsting and starving to\r\nget back. He was literally longing for New York, with its ramifications\r\nall about him--yet the thing he wanted, he could not touch. It was\r\nlike a sick stomach that infested his whole nature with desire, while\r\neverything was at hand but the exact nameless thing desired.... She\r\nwas like a saint, as she stood there, her mouth so pure, her features\r\nso pretty, her voice so brave and tireless--starry to Bellair, a\r\nnight-voice with depths and heights and dew-fragrance. She was coming\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n“You look just the same. I wouldn’t take you for a New Yorker.... Yes,\r\nI am through for to-night.”\r\n\r\n“I should think you’d love to sing,” he said.\r\n\r\nThe remark was fatuous to her. She didn’t know that a year ago Bellair\r\nwouldn’t have dared to say anything so commonplace, but that he had\r\ncome back to this simplicity from the complication of classics she had\r\nnever heard of.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, what do you want most?” he asked earnestly. “I don’t mean the\r\nneed of clothes. We’ve covered that----”\r\n\r\n“I want all that a voice will bring.”\r\n\r\n“Great salaries, noise wherever you go, a continual performance of\r\nnewspaper articles?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“A score of men praying for favours?”\r\n\r\nShe sipped warily.\r\n\r\n“Don’t mind my question. It isn’t fair. But tell me, doesn’t it do\r\nsomething to you--to get even a man like me going, for instance,--to\r\nmake him all different and full of pictures that haven’t anything to do\r\nwith the case?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what you mean.”\r\n\r\nHe stared at her. “You ought to. You do it. I’m not talking of art\r\nor soul, or any of that stuff. That isn’t it. I mean just what\r\nyour singing amounts to in my case. It means New York, but not the\r\nroutine New York--possibly the New York that might be. It means\r\n_Maying_--whatever that is----”\r\n\r\n“You must have been drinking a lot, since I left _Brandt’s_,” she said\r\nmerrily.\r\n\r\nHe didn’t let it hurt him, and was miserable anyway. “The fact is, I\r\ndidn’t take a drink since Sixth avenue, until a moment ago.”\r\n\r\nHe saw that she was debating the vital matter of the evening--whether\r\nhe was a piker who must be shaken presently, or whether he would really\r\nmake good on his offer to help in the essentials of career.\r\n\r\n“What’s your name?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Bessie Brealt.”\r\n\r\n“And where could I find you, if I wanted to write?”\r\n\r\nHe noted her swift disappointment. There was positive pain in the air.\r\nHe knew well what she was thinking, though her sweet face covered well:\r\nthat he was about to promise to send the money to her, that ancient\r\nbeau business. She took a last chance, and mentioned a booking agency\r\nthat might answer for a permanent address.\r\n\r\n“I’ll want to write--I feel that. And here, Bessie, if you don’t mind\r\nmy saying ‘Bessie,’ I can spare a hundred for that wardrobe. I’d like\r\nto do some really big thing for you.”\r\n\r\nHe saw tears start to her eyes, but was not carried out of reason by\r\nthem. She had wanted the money fiercely and it had come.\r\n\r\n“How are you going to get home?” he asked, to relieve the embarrassment.\r\n\r\nShe glanced up quickly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t mean that I want to take you home,” he said, shocked by the\r\nugliness of the world that had called this explanation so hastily.\r\n“My train needs me.... Say, Bessie, men haven’t supplied you with\r\naltogether pleasant experiences so far, have they?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll get a car home.”\r\n\r\nHe gave her his card.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Better let me get you a cab to-night. It’s late.”\r\n\r\nShe thanked him again.... At the curb, as the driver backed in, Bessie\r\nput up her lips to him.\r\n\r\n“... Dear singing-girl--I didn’t ask that.”\r\n\r\n“It’s because you didn’t, I think. Really that’s it. Oh, thank you.\r\nGood-night.”\r\n\r\nBellair beckoned another cab, and sank back into the dark. All the way\r\nto the station, and through to the Savannah-Pullman, he was wrenching\r\nhimself clear from something like a passion to turn about to New York.\r\nAt the last moment, before the train moved, he recalled the letter to\r\nMr. Nathan, and hailed a station porter from the step.\r\n\r\n“Please mail this for me,” he said, bringing up silver with the letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THREE\r\n\r\nTHE JADE: II\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nBELLAIR had to wait less than two days in Savannah, for the _Jade_\r\nhad made a pretty passage. Impressions rushed home too swift for\r\nhis mind to follow, as he stepped aboard from the cotton dock; the\r\nnumber of impressions, he did not know, until he began the inventory\r\nin his cabin afterward. Last and first and most compelling, however,\r\nwas the spectacle of Stackhouse, that David Hume figure of a man,\r\nreclining in his cane-chair of similar vast proportions just aft of the\r\nmain-shrouds. A momentous hammock of canes, that steamer-chair, with\r\ngentle giving slopes for the calves and broad containers, polished with\r\nwear and tightly woven like armour, for the arms; a sliding basket for\r\nthe head, suggestive of a guillotine’s grisly complement; the whole\r\nadjusted to Stackhouse and no other.\r\n\r\nHumid heat in the harbour, a day of soft low clouds. The man who pushed\r\nBrooklyn from him, had discarded even more thoroughly the clothing of\r\ntemperate climes. The vivid black of his hairy chest was uncovered, and\r\nthere was a shining bar of the same, just above the selvage of white\r\nsock. Bellair thought he must be hairy as a collie dog.... But mainly\r\nthat which weighted and creaked the chair seemed an enormous puddle of\r\nfaded silks.\r\n\r\nThe bulky brown head (which arose plumb as a wall from the back of the\r\nneck) had slightly bowed as Bellair passed. There was something ox-like\r\nin the placidity of the brown eyes, but that was only their first beam,\r\nas it were. Much that was within and behind the eyes of Stackhouse,\r\nBellair thought of afterward. Through a deep, queer process, it came\r\nto him that even the answer for his coming was in that indescribable\r\nbackground; and restless, too, in the pervading brown, a movement of\r\nsleek animals there. The Japanese woman had _skuffed_ forward with\r\ndrink for her lord.\r\n\r\nOver all was the cloud of canvas and rigging, which Bellair had studied\r\nfrom the land, and which had forced him to a fine respect for the\r\nruffian sailor-men who could move directly in such an arcanum, and\r\ncommand its service. Bellair had not found such labour on shore, having\r\nlost his respect for the many who did not learn even the commonest\r\nwork.... There was a deep-sea smell about her, a solution of tar and\r\ndried fruit, paint and steaming coppers from the galley.\r\n\r\nThe very age of the _Jade_ was a charm to him. Only her spine and ribs\r\nand plates were of steel--the rest a priceless woodwork that had come\r\ninto its real beauty under the endlessly wearing hands of man. There\r\nseemed a grain and maturity to the inner parts, as if the strain and\r\nroughing of the seas had brought out the real enduring heart of the\r\nexcellent fabric. The rose-wood side-board of his upper berth, for\r\ninstance, placed for the full light from the port to fall upon it,\r\nwas worth the price of the passage--sixteen inches wide, a full inch\r\nand one-half thick, worn to a soft lustre as if the human hands had\r\nhallowed it, and giving back to the touch the same answer from the\r\nyears that a vine brings to stone-work and the bouquet to wine.... The\r\n_Jade_ had known good care and answered. Floors, even of the cabins,\r\nwere hollowed from much stoning; the hinges held and ferried their\r\nburdens in silence, and the old locks moved with soft contented clicks,\r\nthe wards running in new oil.\r\n\r\nA city man who had long dreamed of a country garden; or indeed, Bellair\r\nwas a city man who had long dreamed of a full-rigged ship to fulfil in\r\npart the romance of his soul. The _Jade_ had a dear inner life for him,\r\nsatisfied him with her lines, her breathing, settling and repose. A\r\nfine hunger began to animate the length and breadth of the man.\r\n\r\nThere was a half hour of straight, clear thinking, of the kind that\r\nplumbs the outlook with the in, and mainly comes unawares. Bessie\r\nBrealt, of course, appeared and passed, in all the hardness of her life\r\nand the pity of it, but the days that had elapsed since the parting had\r\nnot changed his unique desire to help her; nor did he lie to himself\r\nthat he wanted her, too, as a man wants a woman. He loved her in a way,\r\nagainst his will. Possibly the kiss had fixed that. In the solution of\r\nthe running thoughts, and without subtlety of mingling, was the face on\r\ndeck, the dark, extraordinary face of Stackhouse.\r\n\r\nThey were a full day at sea, before Bellair was called to sit down\r\nbefore the great cane chair. There was a warm land wind; November\r\nalready forgotten. The _Jade_ had gathered up her skirts and was\r\nswinging along with a low music of her own. Stackhouse waddled back to\r\nhis chair from the land-rail, a remarkable mass of crumpled silks, the\r\ncanes marked in the general effusion of dampness along his back and\r\nlegs, the silks caught up behind by a system of wrinkles and imprints,\r\nand one hitched pantaloon revealing the familiar muff of fur above the\r\nselvage of his fallen sock. Now Stackhouse was preparing to enter.\r\nBellair was caught in the tension. The process, while prodigious, was\r\nnot without its delicate parts. One hand was irrevocably occupied\r\nwith a long-stemmed China pipe, a warm creamy vase, already admired by\r\nBellair. Breath came in puffs and pantings of fragrant tobacco, but\r\nthere were gurglings and strange stoppages of air that complained from\r\ndeeper passages.\r\n\r\nCreaking began at the corners; and a wallowing as if from the father of\r\nall boars. Now the centre of the chair caught the strain in full and\r\nwhipped forth its remonstrance. One after another the legs gripped the\r\ndeck, each with a whimper of its own; and the air was filled with sharp\r\nsinging tension which infected the nerves of the watcher. Suddenly\r\nthe torso seemed to let go of itself; and from the canes of the huge\r\ncentral hollow came a scream in unison. By miracle the whole found\r\nitself once more and the breathing of Stackhouse subsided to a whine.\r\n\r\n“We are entering the latitude of rum,” said he. “Whoever you are, young\r\nman, drink the drink of nature, and you will brosper.”\r\n\r\nThe west was just a shore-line, the dusk rising like a tide. The hand\r\nof the owner pressed the silks variously about his chest, and at last\r\nlocated a loose match. Nerves were sparsely scattered in these thick,\r\nheavy-fleshed fingers. He had to stop all talk and memory to direct his\r\nfeeling. The match at length emerged from his palm, and slithered over\r\nthe fine canes of the arm. It was damp. Stackhouse rubbed the sulphur\r\ndelicately in the hair at his temple and tried again. Fire leaped to\r\nthe tip, and poured out from the great hand which pressed it to the\r\npipe and mothered it from the wind. From the gurgling passages, smoke\r\nnow poured as the sweetness in Sampson’s riddle.\r\n\r\nRum had come. The Japanese woman served them. The youth of her face\r\nchilled Bellair; the littleness of her, all the tints and delicacy of\r\na miniature in her whitened face. Bright-hued silk, a placid smile,\r\nthe _skuffing_ of her wooden sandals and the clock-work intricacy of\r\nthe coils of her black hair--these were but decorations of the tragedy\r\nwhich came home to the American where he was still tender.... But why\r\nshould he burn tissue? She seemed happy. He knew that the Japanese\r\nwomen require very little to make them happy; but that little was\r\ndenied this maiden. An hour a day to giggle with her girl-friends\r\nbehind a lattice, and she might have borne twenty-three hours of hell\r\nwith calmness and cheer, not counterfeit like this.\r\n\r\n“You have no true drink of the soil in Ameriga,” said Stackhouse.\r\n“You do not make beer nor wine, so you make no music. The only drink\r\nand the only music that come from the States of Ameriga, are from the\r\nnigger-folk who do not belong there. They make music and corn whiskey.\r\nThe rest is boison to the soul.”\r\n\r\nThe voice was rich and mellow. He must have known Teutonic beginnings,\r\nor enough association for the mannerisms to get into his blood.\r\nStackhouse was not even without that softness of sentiment, though he\r\nwas tender only for men. Except for a spellable word here and there,\r\nhis accent was inimitable. He talked of little other than death, and\r\nwith indescribable care--as if he had been much with men of another\r\nlanguage or with men of slow understanding.... It may have been the\r\ndrink, or the sunset over distant land; the Spanish Main ahead, or\r\nthe dryness and pentness of the city-heart and its achievement of\r\nlong-dreamed desire in a snug, sweet ship under the easy strain of\r\nsails with wind in them; in any event Bellair was drawn with exquisite\r\npassion--drawn southward as the _Jade_ was drawn in the soft,\r\nirresistible strength of nature.\r\n\r\nHe knew that this would pass, that he could not continue to sense this\r\n_rapport_ with the sea-board, but he loved it now, breathed deep, and\r\nsaw Stackhouse as he was never to be seen again. There was enchantment\r\nin the eyes of the great wanderer, and a certain culture of its kind in\r\nits stories. Bellair listened and in the gleam of the broad, dark eyes,\r\nthere seemed a glimpse of burning ships, shadowy caravans on moonlit\r\nsands and the flash of arms by night; low-lying lights of island ports,\r\nformless rafts, spuming breakers, mourning derelicts--just glimpses,\r\nbut of all the gloom and garishness of the sea. He began a monologue\r\nthat night, and though it is not this story, it was not interrupted\r\nexcept by meals and sleeping, for many days; and all the pauses in that\r\nstory were the dramatic pauses of death:\r\n\r\n“... I have travelled more than most travellers and have seen more than\r\nis good for one man. In New York I saw Brundage of Frisco, who asked\r\nme if I remembered Perry. I said I remembered very well, for Perry\r\nwas a bartner of mine, before young Brundage came out to the Islands.\r\nHe told me Perry was six weeks buried. That is the way now. When I\r\nwas young, my combanions did not die in beds. They were killed. Eight\r\nmonths ago, I saw Emslie--waved at him going up the river to Shanghai.\r\nHe was outward bound, and came home to us in Adelaide in a sealed\r\nbox. Old Foster, who is richer than I, has married a little Marie in\r\nManila and may die when he pleases now. The South Seas still run in and\r\nyonder among Island shores, but who buys wine for the Japanese girls in\r\nDunedin, since Norcross was conscripted for the service we all shall\r\nknow?...\r\n\r\n“And thus you come to the _Jade_, and some time you will here them dell\r\nof Stackhouse. Who knows but you may dell the story--of a familiar face\r\nturned down like an oft-filled glass? And some one will say, ‘He has\r\nnot laughed these many years.’ They used to say in the _Smilax_ at Hong\r\nKong, when the harbour was raving and the seas were trying to climb\r\nthe mountain--they used to say that Stackhouse was laughing somewhere\r\noff the China coasts. But there are only so many laughs in a man,\r\nand they go out with the years. Most of those who said that thing of\r\nStackhouse--yes, most of them, are dead as glacial drift.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the quality of his perorations, hunched ox-like just aft of\r\nthe main-shrouds--the Japanese woman coming and going with the ship’s\r\nbells, bringing drinks day and night.\r\n\r\n“It seared my coppers--that drinking in the States of Ameriga. It will\r\nnot subdue,” said he. “One has a thirst for weeks after a few days of\r\ndrinking in Ameriga. For one must be bolite.”\r\n\r\nHe was never stimulated, seldom depressed, but saturated his great\r\nframe twenty hours of the twenty-four, the Japanese woman seeming\r\nto understand with few or no words the whims of taste of which he\r\nwas made. Just once in the small hours, Bellair heard her voice. The\r\ncane-chair had not been empty long, and the silence of soft rain\r\nwas upon the deck. Bellair had opened a package of New York papers\r\npurchased on the last day in Savannah.... It was just one scream, but\r\nthe scream of one not frightened by any human thing.... The roll of\r\npapers dropped down behind the bunk. Anyway, Bellair could not have\r\nread after that. Early in the morning after hours of torture of dreams,\r\nhe was awakened as usual by the sluicing of the monster. Two Lascars\r\nwho travelled with Stackhouse apparently for no other purpose, poured\r\npails of salt water upon him in the early hour when the decks were\r\nwashed; and often at midday as they neared the Line. It was given to\r\nBellair more than once, as the voyage lengthened, to witness this\r\nhippodrome.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nHer face was continually turned away. Bellair wondered as days passed\r\nif he should ever see her face to face--the silent, far-looking young\r\nwoman with a nursing baby in her arms. On deck she stood at the rail,\r\neyes lost oversea. Her contemplation appeared to have nothing to do\r\nwith Europe or America, but set to the wind wherever it came from, as\r\nthe strong are always turned up-stream. Sometimes she wore a little\r\nblue jacket, curiously reminding Bellair of school-days, and though she\r\nwas not far from that in years, she seemed to have passed far into the\r\nworld. The child cried rarely.\r\n\r\nThere was a composure about the mother, but he did not know if it were\r\nstolidity or poise. Certainly she had known poverty, but health was\r\nin her skin, and there was something in that white profile, that the\r\nsun had touched with olive rather than tan, that stopped his look.\r\nThe perfection of it dismayed Bellair. He loved beauty, but did not\r\ntrust it, did not trust himself with it. The presence of a beautiful\r\nface stimulated him as no wine could do, but it also started him to\r\nidealising that which belonged to it, and this process had heretofore\r\nbrought disappointment. Bellair did not want this touch of magnetism\r\nnow. Beauty was plentiful. He had seen the profiles of Italian girls in\r\nNew York, that the Greeks would have worshipped, and which the early\r\nworship of the Greeks was doubtless responsible for--beauty with little\r\nbeside but giggle and sham. He disliked the thing in a man’s breast\r\nthat answers so instantly to the line and colour of a woman’s face;\r\nobjected to it primarily, because it was one of the first and most\r\nobvious tricks of nature for the replenishment of species in man and\r\nbelow. Bellair fancied to answer the captivation, if any at all, of a\r\ndeeper wonder in woman than the contour of her countenance.\r\n\r\nHe was aware that many a woman has a beautiful profile, whose direct\r\nlook is a disturbing reconsideration. This kept his eyes down, when she\r\nwas opposite in the dining cabin. We are strangely trained at table;\r\nat no time so merciful. The human dining countenance must be lovely,\r\nindeed, not to break the laws of beauty. Only outright lovers dare, and\r\nthey are bewildered by each other, and see not. So he did not know the\r\ncolour of her eyes.\r\n\r\nShe nursed her baby often on deck, sitting bare-headed in the wind and\r\nsun, sometimes singing to it. The singing was all her own; Bellair\r\nwished she wouldn’t. Her melodies were foreign, and sometimes it\r\nseemed to him as if they were just a touch off the key. Her low\r\ndissonances, he described vaguely as Russian, but retained the\r\nsuspicion that she was tonally imperfect of hearing.\r\n\r\nThe singing and the picture of her was just as far as possible from\r\nBessie Brealt, but she made Bellair think. In all likelihood this was\r\nthe general objection. His eyes smarted in the dusks, as he thought of\r\nthe other singer (as solitary in New York as this woman here), who was\r\ndetermined not to be afraid of the cars or the bears or the wolves.\r\nEvery day Bessie’s first words returned to him:\r\n\r\n“A little Rhine wine--it’s very good here.”\r\n\r\nAnd always the devastation of that sentence was great. It was a\r\nstreet-woman’s inside familiarity, _Brandt’s_ being one of her\r\nrounds; as she might speak of the beer at _Holbeck’s_ or the chops at\r\n_Sharpe’s_. Yet Bessie was not greedy, and had no taste for wine. It\r\nwas the glibness, the town mannerism, and the low, easy level which\r\nher acceptance of the common saying revealed; the life which she was\r\nwilling to make her own, at least exteriorly. But after all, in the\r\nbetter moments, it seemed very silly to deny a great soul to the girl\r\nwho could sing as Bessie sang. Some day she would feel her soul....\r\n\r\nThe preacher, third passenger on board the _Jade_, reported that the\r\nFaraway woman was returning to her home in New Zealand. Fleury didn’t\r\nknow if her baby was boy or girl, but judged that it was very healthy,\r\nsince it cried so little.\r\n\r\nFleury wasn’t promising to Bellair’s eyes. First of all it was\r\nthe cloth; and then during the first three weeks at sea, Bellair\r\nspent innumerable hours in the periphery of the great cane-chair.\r\nHe did not resist his prejudice. “A missionary going out with the\r\nusual effrontery,” he decided. The preacher’s face appeared placid\r\nand boyish.... Fleury, however, continued to observe cheerful\r\ngood-mornings, to praise the fine weather, and to offer opportunities\r\nfor better acquaintance--all without being obtrusive in the least.\r\nHayti and Santo Domingo--names once remote and romantic to the city\r\nman’s mind--were now vanished shores, and as yet the voyage was but\r\nwell begun.... The three passengers were served together in the cabin,\r\nexcept in cases when the Stackhouse narrative happened to be running\r\nparticularly well. Bellair would then be called to dine with the owner.\r\nCaptain McArliss would appear at this mess and disappear--the courses\r\nbeing brought to him one after another in a certain rapid form. The\r\nCaptain seemed so conscious, that Bellair never quite dared to observe\r\nwhat happened to the food, but he was certain that McArliss did not\r\nbolt. His suspicion was that he tasted or sipped as the case might be,\r\nmerely spoiling the offering. He was gone before Stackhouse was really\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\nIt was less what the giant ate, than the excessive formality and\r\nimportance of his table sessions that prevailed upon the American.\r\nDinner was the chief doing of the day. Bellair had never complained,\r\neven in thought, of the food served to him in the usual mess, but with\r\nStackhouse everything was extra fine from the Chinese standpoint--all\r\ndelicacies and turns of the art, all choice cuttings and garnishments,\r\na most careful consideration of wines--so that from the first audible\r\ndelectation of the contents of the silver tureen, to the choice of a\r\ncigar (invariably after a few deep inhalations from a cigarette “made\r\nin Acca by the brisoners”), there was formality and deep responsibility\r\nupon the ship; and a freedom afterward through the galleys that was\r\npleasant to regard.\r\n\r\n“There are many things in Belgium,” said the master. “There are wines\r\nand gookeries there; also in Poland there are gooks. In England there\r\nare gooks, but not in Ameriga--only think-they-are-gooks. However,\r\nthere are gooks in China. I have one, as you shall see.”\r\n\r\nSomething like this at each mighty dining--and the promise had to do\r\nwith the next course which Stackhouse invariably knew and served as\r\na surprise for his guest, for he ordered his dinner with his coffee\r\nand fish in the morning. Bellair had often seen the Chinese emerge\r\nfrom the galley, as they came up from the dining saloon, little sparse\r\npatches of hair here and there on his fat face like willow clumps\r\non the shore, these untouched by the razor, though his forehead was\r\nperfectly shaven to the queue circlet. This was Gookery John taking his\r\nbreath after the moil and heat of the day.\r\n\r\nStackhouse would declare that he dined just once a day, meaning this\r\nexactly. He breakfasted on a plate of fried fish with many pourings of\r\nmellow, golden and august German coffee, eating the hot fishes in his\r\nhands like crackers--a very warm and shiny hand when it was done--crisp\r\nbrown fishes stripped somehow in his beard, the bones tossed overside.\r\nHe liked full day with this meal. The plates were brought hot and\r\ncovered to the great cane chair, until he called for them to cease. For\r\nhis supper he desired outer darkness (English ale and apples, black\r\nbread from Rome that comes sewn in painted canvas like hams for the\r\nshipping, butter from Belgium packed with the care of costly cheeses,\r\nof which he was connoisseur; sauces of India, a cold chicken, perhaps,\r\nor terrapin, and an hour or two of nuts). The Japanese woman appeared\r\nat none of these services.\r\n\r\nIt was the dinners, however, which bewildered Bellair most. He had\r\nnot the heart utterly to condemn them, since the _Jade_ and the noble\r\nsea-air, sometimes winy and sometimes of sterile purity, kept him in\r\nthat fine state of appreciation, which if he had ever known as a boy\r\nwas utterly forgotten. He had initiation in curries and roasts, piquant\r\nrelishes of seed and fish and flower, chowders, broiled fish and\r\nbaked--until he felt the seas and continents serving their best, and\r\nlearned about each in the characteristic telling of the man who lived\r\nfor them. For instance when chicken was brought:\r\n\r\n“These are the birds for the Chinese to play with--yes, you would\r\nthink me joking? It is not so. The little chicken-birds are kept for\r\npets. They are not frightened to death. You do not know, berhaps,\r\nthat fear and anger boisons the little birds? They are kept happy and\r\nkilled quick--before they know. Many mornings they are fed from the\r\nhand and played with, until they love John of the gookeries--and one\r\nmorning--so, like that--heads off--and no boison from the fear of death\r\nin our flavours. Many things you do not know--yes?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Bellair said.\r\n\r\nStackhouse loved his little facts like these, all matters of\r\npreparation of fish and flesh and fowl; the intricate processes of\r\nfattening, curing, softening, corking and all the science of the\r\nstores.... “There was a certain goose which I found in Hakodate--not\r\nfrom the Japanese, but from a Chino there----”.... “And once upon a\r\ntime in Mindanao, they baked a fish for me with heated stones in the\r\nground. Wrapped in leaves, it was, and covered first in clay. You\r\nshould see the scales and skin come off with the clay--and the inner\r\nbarts a little ball, when it was finished. And the dining of that\r\nevening. Ah, the sharb eyes of the little nigger girls--you would\r\nbelieve?”.... Such were the stories in the long feeding--but the\r\nstories on deck were the stories of the death of men.\r\n\r\nIn the usual mess the chat was perfunctory on Bellair’s part, since\r\nhe granted that the preacher and the Faraway woman (he called her\r\nso in his thoughts from her distant-searching on deck) were so well\r\nadjusted to each other. He granted this, and much beside concerning\r\nthe two, from pure fancy. Never once had they disregarded him, or\r\nengaged in conversation that would leave him dangling, though many\r\ntimes his own thoughts were apart. The _Jade_ had been three weeks out\r\nof Savannah, in the southern Caribbean, a superb mid-afternoon, when\r\nBellair, turning at the rail, found Fleury at his side. He had just\r\nbeen wondering if he had better go below and read awhile by the open\r\nport, or start the monologue of Stackhouse for the rest of the day. The\r\nlatter was enjoyable enough, but Bellair disliked to drink anything so\r\nearly.... “One must be bolite.”\r\n\r\nIt happened right for the first conversation with Fleury. He had never\r\nknown a preacher whose talk touched the core of things. Preachers\r\nhad always shown a softness of training on the actualities, and\r\nleft Bellair sceptical of the rest. A minister had once told him:\r\n“What force for good we get to be in mid-life, is in spite of our\r\necclesiastical training, not because of it.” Bellair had often thought\r\nof that.\r\n\r\nYet, he had given much secret thought to religious things, not counting\r\nhimself a specialist, however, seldom opening the subject. Certainly\r\nat Lot & Company’s, no one had marked this proclivity. He had the idea\r\nthat a man must come up through men, and through the real problems of\r\nmen, if he would become a moving force for good in the world; that no\r\ntraining apart among texts and tracts and tenets would get him power.\r\nVery clearly he saw that a man must go apart to fix his ideals, but\r\nthat he should seek his wilderness after learning the world, not after\r\nprolonged second-hand contacts with books.\r\n\r\n“The big job ahead is for some one who can show the human family that\r\nit’s all of a piece, and that we’re all out after the same thing,” he\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n“A Unifier,” Fleury suggested.\r\n\r\n“Yes. Just so long as we have to hate one cult or sect, because we love\r\nanother, we’re lost to the whole beauty of the scheme----”\r\n\r\n“I quite agree with you,” said the preacher.\r\n\r\n“What is your church?” Bellair asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, the fact is, I haven’t one,” Fleury said with a smile.\r\n“Convictions somewhat similar to that which you have expressed have\r\ntwice cost me my church. As the church puts it, I am a failure and not\r\nto be trusted with regular work----”\r\n\r\n“You are going out in the mission-service?”\r\n\r\nBellair was now ashamed, because he had held the other a bit cheaply.\r\nThe boyish face looked suddenly different to him, as Fleury said:\r\n\r\n“No--that is, I have ceased to expound theology. I have come out to\r\nmake the thought and the act one.”\r\n\r\nBellair was taking on a new conception. His question was a trifle\r\nautomatic:\r\n\r\n“Did you talk out in meeting?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. There were a thousand years in the congregation. You know what I\r\nmean--only a few of our generation in method of mind.”\r\n\r\n“A sort of Seventeenth century average?” Bellair suggested.\r\n\r\n“Don’t misunderstand me. I was wrong, too,” Fleury declared. “Wrong,\r\nin the young man’s way of thinking himself right. You know we’re just\r\nas baneful when we are getting into a new world of thought as when we\r\nare not yet out of the old. It’s only after we have settled down and\r\ngot accustomed to the place, that we’re reasonable. A man should be big\r\nenough to talk to all men, and appear everlastingly true to the least\r\nand the greatest. Truth is big enough for that. I had only a different\r\ntrail from theirs, and wanted them all to come to mine, forgetting that\r\nthe trails are only far apart at the bottom of the mountain--that they\r\nall converge at the top----”\r\n\r\n“You had to be honest with yourself,” Bellair said thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“That’s just what I thought, but maybe there was a lie in that,” Fleury\r\nanswered. “It’s not so easy to be honest with one’s self and keep on\r\nusing words for a living. The best way is to act----”\r\n\r\n“You’ve said something, Mr. Fleury.”\r\n\r\nAnd in his new respect for the other, Bellair wanted to make his view\r\nclearer. “It’s the old soil and seed story again,” he said. “It isn’t\r\nenough to get truth down to superb simplicity. The minds of men must\r\nbe open beside. My objection to the Church is that it has separated\r\nreligion from work and the week-day--tried to balance one day of\r\nsanctimoniousness against six days of mammon--taught men that heaven\r\nis to be reached in a high spiritual effusion because One has died for\r\nus. The fact is we’ve got to help ourselves to heaven.... Excuse me for\r\nbeing so communicative,” he added, “but what you said about putting\r\ndown talk and taking up action interested me at once. I’ve a suspicion\r\nyou won’t be long in finding something to do----”\r\n\r\n“I’m hoping just that.”\r\n\r\nFleury smiled at him. The face was large and mild, not a fighter’s\r\nface nor a coward’s either.... The young woman appeared with the child.\r\nShe seemed to hold it to the sun, and she walked with the beauty of a\r\nwoman bringing a pitcher to the fountain. Bellair realised the heat of\r\nthe day. Her face had an intense clearness, but was partly turned away.\r\nThere was a delicacy about it that he had not known before. He recalled\r\nthat she had just bowed to them.... They were passing an island\r\nshore--a line of sun-dazzle that stung the eyes, empty green hills and\r\na fierce white sky. Bellair thought of the woman and the island as one\r\n... he, the third, coming home, mooring his boat, hastening up the\r\ntrail at evening.... Her frail back, bending a little to the right,\r\nmade him think of a dancer he had once seen. He saw the child’s bare\r\nlimbs in the sun.... His steps were quickened up that Island trail\r\nagain.... The _Jade_ seemed fainting in the cushions of hot wind. Just\r\nthen a voice said:\r\n\r\n“She’s quite the most remarkable woman. She isn’t a talker.”\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten Fleury.\r\n\r\n“Where is she going?”\r\n\r\n“Auckland. She came from there.”\r\n\r\n“Queer, she would go home this way----”\r\n\r\n“Her whole fortune is in her arms,” Fleury whispered.\r\n\r\nThe ship’s bell struck twice; the cane-chair creaked; they turned by\r\nhabit to note the appearance of the Japanese woman with drink. She did\r\nnot fail. Stackhouse came to with a prolonged snore, a sound unlike a\r\npair of pit-terriers at work.\r\n\r\n“A considerable brute,” muttered the preacher.\r\n\r\n“He has been much of a man in his way,” said Bellair.\r\n\r\n“He talks much--that is weakness.”\r\n\r\nTheir eyes met. Bellair began to understand how deeply the other’s\r\nexperience had bitten him.\r\n\r\n“He’s afraid of death,” Fleury added.\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” Bellair mused. “He talks always of death. He’s been in at\r\nthe deaths of many men. He’ll die hard himself--if he doesn’t tame\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\nFleury added: “When a man is so much an animal, all his consciousness\r\nis in that. They see death as the end--that’s why they are afraid----”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if he is a coward?” Bellair questioned.\r\n\r\n“The stuff animals are made of cannot last,” the preacher concluded.\r\n\r\nBellair pondered as he sat with Stackhouse that night. Brandy was the\r\nchoice of the evening. The Japanese woman brought it from the deeps of\r\nthe hold, where it had come in stone from Bruges. Bellair joined him a\r\nsecond and a third time for the instant stinging zest of the fire....\r\nFleury and the woman had long stood together aft by the clicking log.\r\nThe moon came late and bulbous. Stackhouse talked of his fortune, and\r\nthe chaos in many island affairs his death would cause.... Once he had\r\nloved a chap named Belding, and would have left him great riches, but\r\nBelding was dead....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nThey had crossed the Line. The night was windless hot--almost\r\nsuffocating below. Bellair gave it up, a little after midnight, and\r\nwent on deck, moving forward out of the smell of paint, for the heat\r\nhad bubbled the lead on the cabin planking. A few first magnitude stars\r\nglinted in the fumy sky. The anchor chains and the big hook itself made\r\na radiator not to be endured--better the smell of paint than that.\r\nCaptain McArliss moved past with a cigar and suggested jerkily that a\r\nhammock was swung aft by the binnacle. Bellair thanked him and went\r\nthere, but did not lie down. Close to the rail he could smell the deep\r\nand it refreshed him. Left alone in this hard-won ease, his thoughts\r\nturned back to New York.\r\n\r\n... It was like a ghost at the companionway--a faint grey luminosity.\r\nShe came toward him without a sound, the child in her arms. Something\r\nof the strangeness prevented him speaking until she was near, and then\r\nhe spoke softly in fear lest she be frightened:\r\n\r\n“It is I, Bellair----”\r\n\r\nIf she were startled, she did not let him know. He offered the\r\ndeckchair he had occupied, or the hammock, as she chose.\r\n\r\n“I would not have disturbed you,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I think it is cooler close to the rail,” he suggested. “The little one\r\nis very brave. Is he awake?”\r\n\r\n“Yes----”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know why I said ‘he,’--the fact is, I didn’t know,” he laughed.\r\n\r\n“You were right,” she answered, sitting down. “He seems to have so much\r\nto study and contemplate. It passes the time for him, and then he is\r\nvery well and he likes the sea.”\r\n\r\n“He has been to sea before?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, we came up from Auckland on a steamer when he was _ver-ee_\r\nlittle, but he liked it, and did so well. It was harder for him in New\r\nYork, although he didn’t complain----”\r\n\r\nBellair laughed.\r\n\r\n“Now that I have taken your seat--won’t you get another?” she asked.\r\n“Or the hammock?”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t mind I should be very glad to get another chair----”\r\n\r\nBellair found himself hurrying to the waist, for there was always a\r\nlesser seat by the great cane throne.... He could not see her face in\r\nthat utter night, but sometimes when he had forgotten for a moment,\r\nthere seemed the faintest grey haze about her face and shoulders, but\r\nnever when he looked sharply; and the curve of her back as her body\r\nfitted to the child in her lap, hushed him queerly within, so that he\r\nlistened to his own commonplace words, as one would hear the remarks of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose he would come to me?” the man asked.\r\n\r\n“I think he would be very glad,” she said.\r\n\r\nBellair took no risk, but placed his hand softly between the little\r\nones. Something went out of him, leaving nothing but a queer, joyous\r\nvibration that held life together, with ample to spare to laugh with.\r\nThe larger part of his identity seemed to be infused with the night,\r\nhowever. On one side of his hand, there was a warm, light seizure,\r\nrendering powerless his own little finger, and on the other side, his\r\nthumb was taken. He lifted his hand a little and the captor’s came with\r\nit--no waste of energy whatsoever, but with easy confidence of having\r\nenough and to spare. The man couldn’t breathe without laughing, but he\r\nwas very quiet about it as the moment demanded, and his delight was\r\nnowise to be measured in recent history.\r\n\r\nHe was bending forward close to the woman’s breast. Suddenly he\r\nremembered her--as if finding himself in a sanctuary.... The great\r\npictures of the world had this _motif_, but the Third of the trinity\r\nwas always invisible. Yet he had entered in this darkness, come right\r\ninto the fragrance and the love-magnetism of it ... held there in two\r\nineffable pressures.\r\n\r\nHis low laughter ceased. He was full of wonder now, but could not stay.\r\nOut of the bewilderment of emotions he had the one sense--that he was\r\nnot the third to this mystery--that the third must be invisible, as in\r\nthe great _madonnas_ of paint. He betrayed the tiny grips with a twist,\r\ncaught the child in his two hands and lifted him from the mother,\r\nsitting back in his own chair.... But the fragrance lingered about him\r\nand that wonderful homing vibration. He knew something of the nature of\r\nit now. It was peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nThe little blue jacket had come forth again as they ran down into the\r\ncold.... There was wild weather around the Horn, and Stackhouse was a\r\nsick monster from confinement. Bellair, who could drink a little for\r\ncompany through the glorious nights on deck, bolted from the cabin\r\nperformance, and Captain McArliss was called to listen, and fell, as\r\nStackhouse knew he would, for he had said to Bellair during one of\r\ntheir last talks:\r\n\r\n“Lest there appear among men a perfect sailor, they handicapped my\r\nMcArliss--packed his inner barts in unslaked lime. Never will you see\r\na thirst fought as he fights it. First he will drink with me, and\r\nyou will hear him laugh; then he will drink alone, and there will be\r\nsilence until he begins to scream. Already his eyes are tortured and\r\nhis lips white. Bresently he will come and sit with me----”\r\n\r\nBellair hated this; in fact the big master had begun to wear deeply. “I\r\nshould think you would want to keep him on his feet--for the passage\r\naround the Horn.”\r\n\r\n“My McArliss is always a sailor,” said Stackhouse, rocking his head.\r\n\r\nBellair could credit that. McArliss interested him--an abrupt, nervous\r\nman, who covered the eager warmth of his friendliness in frosted\r\nmannerisms and sentences clipped at each end. He was afraid of himself\r\nexcept in his work, afraid of his opinions, though a great reader of\r\nthe queer out of the way good things. Bellair found Woolman’s Life in\r\nhis little library, with narratives of the ocean, tales of Blackbirders\r\nand famous Indiamen, Lytton’s “Strange Story” and “Zanoni,” also\r\nHartmann’s “Magic, Black and White.” The latter he read, and found it\r\nnot at all what he expected, but a book that would go with him as far\r\nas he cared at any angle, and then lose him. He was quite astonished.\r\nIt was a long book, too--the kind you vow you will begin again, from\r\ntime to time through the last half. He wanted to talk to McArliss about\r\nit, but the Captain was embarrassed.\r\n\r\n“Crazy, eh?” he would say with a queer, dry laugh.\r\n\r\n“I’ve stopped saying that about a book--because I don’t get it all,”\r\nBellair remarked. “This man is right as far as I can go with him.”\r\n\r\n“You give him the benefit--eh? That’s pretty good.”\r\n\r\n“And you like it?”\r\n\r\n“Ha--it passes the time. Good God--we have to pass the time!”\r\n\r\nHe spoke jerkily, always in this fashion, and the days brought no ease\r\nto the tension. McArliss patted his pockets, swore hastily over little\r\nthings, looked snappily here and there. Bellair would have guessed,\r\nwithout the word from Stackhouse. The Captain was fighting hard. There\r\nseemed nothing to be done; the man had grown a spiked hedge around an\r\ninnocent shyness; all that was real about him he kept shamefacedly to\r\nhimself. Still Bellair believed more and more in his fine quality.\r\nMcArliss made a picture for him of one who has come up through steam\r\nand returned to canvas bringing a finer appreciation to the beauty and\r\npossibilities of natural seamanship; as a man returns to the land,\r\nafter many wearing years of city life, with a different and deeper\r\ninstinct of the nature of the soil.\r\n\r\n“She’s a slashing sailer,” he would say critically, as he crowded the\r\n_Jade_. “She balances to a hair--eh? Good old girl--they don’t breed\r\nher kind any more.”\r\n\r\nIt was he who balanced her to every wind, meeting all weathers with\r\ndifferent cuts of cloth. Having only a distant familiarity with his\r\nfellow-officers and not even a speaking acquaintance with the crew,\r\nMcArliss made her sing her racing song night and day down into the\r\nlower latitudes, until one played with the suspicion that he managed\r\nthe weather, too,--with that same nervous, effective energy. It was\r\nall tremendously satisfying to Bellair. He had reacted on the last\r\nreaction, and was healed throughout. Worldliness was lost from his\r\nmental pictures of Bessie; daily she became more as he wanted her to\r\nbe. Lot & Company had lost its upstanding and formidable black--was\r\nfar-off now and dimly pitiable. He had not cared what was ahead; it\r\nhad been the _Jade_ and the voyage that had called him, but now the\r\nIslands and all that watery universe of the Southern Pacific were\r\nin prospect, to explore and make his own. Perhaps men were younger\r\nthere; trade less old and ramified; perhaps they would bring him the\r\nnew magic of life--so that he could live with zest and be himself....\r\nAlways at this part of the dream he would think of Bessie again. She\r\nwas the cord not yet detached. Sooner or later, he must go back to\r\nher. At times he thought that he could not bear to remain very long;\r\nsometimes even watching this endless passage of days with strange\r\nconcern.... But there was a short cut home--straight up the Pacific to\r\nSan Francisco--and four days across....\r\n\r\nFleury and the Faraway woman had their increasingly fine part in his\r\nlife. The preacher was always finding some new star, or bidding adieu\r\nto some northern constellation.\r\n\r\nThey had chosen the passage through the Straits because of the settled\r\nweather. At least, they called it fair-going--wild and rugged though\r\nit was, with huge masses of torn cloud, black or grey-black, hurtling\r\npast, often as low as the masthead, and all life managed at sick\r\nangles. The _Jade_ bowed often and met the screaming blasts with her\r\npoles strangely bare, except, perhaps, for a few feet of extra-heavy\r\ncanvas straining at the mizzen weather-rig.... Stackhouse nudged him\r\none night and a laugh gurgled up from his chest as he pointed forward\r\nwhere McArliss stood in the waist lighting a cigarette.\r\n\r\n“He will not sleep to-night. He will come to me--and you will never\r\nhear such talk as from this silent man. He will look for gompany\r\nto-night. One must be bolite.”\r\n\r\nIt was true. McArliss apparently fell into the cigarettes first,\r\nor perhaps he had fallen deeper. Bellair did not join them in the\r\ncabin, but heard their voices. The next day McArliss hunted him up,\r\nan inconceivable action. This was not like timid Spring, but sudden\r\nredolent summer after the austerities. The man was on fire, but\r\nperfectly in hand. All that he had thought and kept to himself for\r\nmonths appeared to come forth now--books and men, the great oceans of\r\nspirit and matter, and the mysteries of life and release. It seemed as\r\nif his body and brain had suddenly become transparent. The Captain was\r\nhappy and kind, without oath or scandal, full of colour and romance;\r\nreturning with excellent measure all the good thoughts that Bellair had\r\ngiven to him, and showing forth for one rare forenoon the memorable\r\nfabric of a man.\r\n\r\nThere was no repetition to his stages. In the afternoon he passed\r\nBellair brusquely, and drank the night away with Stackhouse. The\r\nnext day both face and figure had a new burden; the real man was now\r\nimprisoned more effectively than even his sobriety could accomplish....\r\nThen the descent day by day--the narrow, woman’s waist and the broad,\r\nlean shoulders becoming a hunched unit, face averted, hands thick.\r\nBellair always felt that Stackhouse was in a way responsible--for the\r\nold Master had known what would come and lured it on. He had foretold\r\neach stage--even to the last of McArliss drinking alone.\r\n\r\nOn two nights Fleury was with him while he met his devils. He had\r\noutraged Bellair at every offer and entrance. Even Stackhouse was\r\nsurprised that the preacher was permitted to attend. His poor vitality\r\nat length began to crawl back into his body with terrible pain and\r\nshattered sanity--that old familiar battle, the last of many storms.\r\nAnd now the _Jade_ was sailing up into the summer of the southern\r\nocean. Midwinter in New York and here a strange, spacious sort of\r\nJune, not without loneliness and wonderment to Bellair for the steady\r\nbrightness and exceeding length of day.\r\n\r\nThe new moon had come down, extraordinary in its earth-shine which\r\nFleury explained. The _Jade_ was marking time, just making steerage\r\nheadway, the breeze too light for good breathing.... To-night (as\r\nhad happened a dozen times before on the other side of South America\r\nbefore the cold weather) Stackhouse had begun his story with, “It was\r\na night like this----” As of old it was the tale of man and death, of\r\nthe Stackhouse escape from death, sinuously impressing the Stackhouse\r\ncourage and cleverness. Not that the story was without art; indeed,\r\nas usual, it was such a one as a man seldom leaves until the end; but\r\nBellair had long since reached the moment of sufficiency. He had come\r\nto the end of his favourite author; had begun to see the mechanism and\r\ninventional methods of the workmanship. Vim was lost for the enactment\r\nof Stackhouse’s fiercer strength. The man was a concentrated fume of\r\nspirit, every tissue falsely braced, his very life identified with the\r\nlife and heat of decay....\r\n\r\nAlone, Bellair glanced about before going below. A breeze had slightly\r\nquickened the ship in the last hour. There may have been a dozen\r\nnights of equal mystery but this he appreciated more soundly and\r\nwas grateful for freedom. His mind answered the beauty of it all\r\n... something of this, he might be able to tell Bessie in a letter.\r\nThe stars were far and tender; the air heavenly cool and soft, the\r\nnight high, and the ship’s full white above, had something to do with\r\nangels--a dreamy spirit-haunt about it all. He would always see the\r\n_Jade_ so, as he would see the Captain in that wonderful forenoon of\r\nhis emancipation--poor McArliss who had not been on deck for days.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later, with paper before him in his berth, Bellair was\r\ndeep in the interpretation of his heart, when the _Jade_ struck the\r\ncupola of a coral castle, and hung there shivering for five seconds. It\r\nwas like a suspension of the law of time.\r\n\r\nBellair thought of Bessie, of every one on the ship, beginning with\r\nFleury and the New Zealand woman, and ending with Captain McArliss and\r\nthe owner’s Japanese wife. These latter two were strangely rolled into\r\none, as their images came. He thought of the ship’s position somewhere\r\nin the great emptiness between the Strait of Magellan and Polynesia. He\r\nre-read the last line of the letter before him. It had to do with the\r\nreal help he hoped to be in Bessie’s cause _within the year_. He heard\r\nthe running and the hard-held voices on deck, and one great bellowing\r\ncry from Stackhouse. He knew now that all the tales were the low\r\nfuries of fear; that the movement he had seen first in the eyes of the\r\ngreat animal were the movements of fear....\r\n\r\nAnd then the _Jade_ slid off the reef with a rip more tragic than the\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   5\r\n\r\nHissing and sucking began below, and the drawing of the centre of the\r\nearth. Bellair felt this in his limbs, and the limp paralysis of the\r\nsails. It was like the blind struggle in the soul of a bird, this\r\nstrain in the entity of the old _Jade_ to retain her balance between\r\nearth and sky.... Bellair was on his knees dragging forth his unused\r\ncase. The roll of New York papers came with it, and he stuffed them\r\nin overcoat pockets with a six-shooter, a bottle of whiskey and a\r\nfew smaller things. These arrangements were made altogether without\r\nthought. Unfumblingly, he obeyed a rush of absurdities that seemed\r\nobvious and reasonable as in a dream.\r\n\r\nThe touch of water on his knee as he arose was like a burn. It poured\r\nin under the door, its stream the size of a pencil, a swift and quiet\r\nlittle emissary. It occurred--a queer, rational touch--that the _Jade_\r\ncould not be thus filled so soon, that something must have overturned.\r\nHe opened the door to the deck. Night and ocean were all one; the rest\r\nwas the stars, and this bit of chaos recoiling from its death--a\r\nlittle ship, struck from the deep and perceiving her death like a rat\r\nthat has been struck by a rattler. He smelled the sea, as one in a\r\nnight-walk smells the earth when passing a ravine.\r\n\r\nHe moved aft toward the voices, without yet having thought of his own\r\ndeath. He passed a leaking water-cask, and this reminded him of his\r\nthirst. He took a deep drink--all he could--and his thoughts came\r\nup to the moment. At the same time, that which had been a mass of\r\ninarticulate sounds cleared into a more or less coherent intensity of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nHe heard that the _Jade_ was sinking, but knew that already; heard\r\nthat she would be under in five minutes, which was news of the first\r\norder of sensation.... Now he heard Stackhouse again; the rich unctuous\r\nvoice gone, a sharp, dry _peaking_ instead.... They were aft at the\r\nbinnacle--Stackhouse, Fleury, the Faraway Woman, McArliss. The Japanese\r\nwoman was hurrying forward with a pitcher of wine. Stackhouse drank\r\nfrom the pitcher, standing, and with greed that flooded his chest. He\r\nspoke and the Japanese woman vanished.\r\n\r\nBellair saw the face of McArliss in the white ray from the binnacle.\r\nHe had scarcely seen the Captain for a week. Last seen, it was a face\r\nswollen and flaming red. It was yellow now, like the skin of a chicken,\r\nand feathered with patches of white beard. The loose eye-lids were\r\ntouched with blue. He fumbled with a cigarette, and called hysterically\r\nto an officer amidships. He was not broken from the tragedy, but from\r\nthe debauch.\r\n\r\nStackhouse was standing by the small boat when two sailors came to\r\nlaunch it. He rocked from one foot to another and peaked to them\r\nincessantly. Fleury and the woman stepped nearer the boat. They moved\r\ntogether as one person.... Bellair saw Stackhouse raise his hands as he\r\nhad done that first Sunday, pushing Brooklyn from him. His body pressed\r\nagainst the gunwale of the small boat; he caught it in his hands, as it\r\nraised clear, his ridiculous ankles alternately lifting.\r\n\r\nHis Chinese cook rushed forward with cans of crackers, and dumped them\r\nin the boat. The Japanese woman appeared dragging a huge hamper of\r\nwines and liquors. Stackhouse took the hamper between his legs and sent\r\nher back to his cabin. The boat was lowered just below the level of the\r\n_Jade’s_ gunwale. Stackhouse sprawled forward, the hairy masses of his\r\nlegs writhing after. Presently he reversed, and began to reach for the\r\nhamper. Fleury kicked it out of reach, and lifted the woman and child\r\nin.\r\n\r\n“Get water,” he said to Bellair. “I’ll save a place for you.”\r\n\r\nBellair tossed his overcoat into the boat and darted to the galley,\r\nwhere he found cans. Filling them seemed a process interminable, until\r\nhe pulled over the half-filled cask.... Stackhouse was screaming for\r\nhis hamper. The Japanese woman sped by with more bottles. She tried\r\nto put them in the boat, but Fleury took them from her, and attempted\r\nto force her into a place, but she had heard a final command from her\r\nlord and broke away.... Bellair was filling his cans a second time....\r\nStackhouse, who had risen insanely, was rocked back either by word or\r\nblow from Fleury. The small boat was on the sea, and the _Jade’s_ rail\r\nleaned low to it. The sea was roaring into the mother-boat; she would\r\nflurry in an instant.\r\n\r\n“Yes, water, Bellair,” said Fleury. “But don’t go back.”\r\n\r\n“One more trip,” said Bellair.\r\n\r\nHe filled the last can--his mind holding the image of Stackhouse\r\non his knees praying to Fleury for his hamper. Beseechings back in\r\nthe dark accentuated the picture. Fleury was calling for him.... He\r\npassed the Japanese woman, sobbing and _skuffing_ pitifully back to\r\nthe cabin; as a child sent repeatedly for something hard to find. He\r\nheard the launching of the other and larger boat forward; saw at the\r\nbinnacle McArliss still fumbling for a match. Then Fleury grasped him\r\nand his can.... No, it was the woman’s hand that saved the can from\r\noverturning. Bellair would have waited for the Japanese woman, but the\r\n_Jade_ dipped half-over and slid him into the boat.\r\n\r\nThe mother-ship shuddered. The Japanese woman passed the binnacle,\r\nholding something high in her hand. She was on her knees.... There was\r\na flare and the face of McArliss--who had struck his match at last....\r\nThe _Jade_ seemed to go from them--a sheet of grey obscured the rail.\r\nThe two who remained were netted there together, the red point of the\r\ncigarette flickered out.... The two boats were on the sea; the night, a\r\nserenity of starlight.... The sound of slobbering turned their eyes to\r\nStackhouse, who was drinking from one of the large cans.... Fleury went\r\nto him, pressed the face from it, and placed the cans forward at the\r\nfeet of the woman. His hand was sticky afterward, as if with blood, and\r\nhe held it overside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FOUR\r\n\r\nTHE OPEN BOAT\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nBELLAIR was athirst. The fact that he had taken a deep drink less than\r\na half-hour before, did not prevail altogether against it. In the very\r\npresence of Stackhouse there was a psychological intensity of thirst.\r\nThe master sat hunched and obscene in the stern of the boat, patting\r\nthe wet folds of his shirt--a pure desire-body, afraid of death, afraid\r\nof thirst, afraid of the fear of thirst and death. Picturesqueness and\r\npersonality were gone from him; romance and the strange culture of the\r\nman, for the eyes of Bellair; the old wonder, too, which the seas and\r\nthe islands of the seas had given him. Bellair could not forget the\r\nankles, the moving of those bare masses up and down, as Stackhouse\r\nhad clung at the same time to the small boat and the gunwale of the\r\n_Jade_. What a poison to past tales--this present passion and method of\r\nself-salvation. He was less than a beast, in retaining the effigy of a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nBellair turned to Fleury. Like swift pleasant rays in the dark, the\r\nlast scenes of the main-deck recurred. Again he marvelled at the\r\nfalsity of his first judgments, by which he had formerly set so much,\r\nand so complacently. It had seemed a fat face to him at first, a face\r\nout of true with the world, the face of an easy man who placates things\r\nas they are, because he was not trained to see the evil of them and\r\ngive them fight. All that was remembered with difficulty, even for this\r\nmoment of contrast. It would not come again. Fleury had stood up in\r\nthe crisis, a man to tie to. He would never be the same again in look\r\nor action or intonation; as Stackhouse could never be the same. Fleury\r\nhad risen and put on a princely dimension; the other had lost even that\r\nuncertain admirableness of gross animalism.\r\n\r\nThe preacher was leaning forward toward the knees of the woman, talking\r\nto the babe. Bellair imagined its eyes wide-open and sober; certainly\r\nit was still. The mother’s face was partly turned away. Fleury said:\r\n\r\n“He is having his adventures. He will be a great man. He will have the\r\nworld at his finger-tips, when he is as old as we are--and then his\r\nreal work will begin. For when we know enough of the world, we turn to\r\nGod.”\r\n\r\nThe note of the preacher in this did not embarrass Bellair, as it\r\nwould have done before the _Jade’s_ sinking.\r\n\r\n“He will be a great power,” Fleury went on, for the heart of the\r\nmother. “These things which for him pass unconsciously, will form him\r\nnevertheless. They will do their work within; and when he is grown he\r\nwill know what to do and say.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?” the mother asked.\r\n\r\n“Chiefly because I believe in you,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“I want him to live,” she said.\r\n\r\n“We want that, too,” said Fleury.\r\n\r\nBellair felt himself nodding in the dark.\r\n\r\n“If he is to be a great man, he will have to live through his first--at\r\nleast, through this adventure.”\r\n\r\nThe meaning came very pure to Bellair. It had to do with crackers and\r\nwater for the nourishment of the child. So strong and sure was her own\r\nfortitude that she did not need to say she was thinking only of food\r\nand drink for him. It meant to Bellair, “If I cannot nurse him, he will\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\nHe regarded the length and beam of the small boat. It was not more\r\nthan eighteen feet long--and only the Polar seas could be emptier than\r\nthis vast southern ocean. The nights would be more easily endured, but\r\nthe days, one long burning. Still it would not be torrid heat; they\r\nwere too far south for that. The thought of storm, he kept in the\r\nbackground of his mind. They all did. Roughly estimated, there was\r\nfood and water enough for them to live without great agony for a week,\r\npossibly for a day or two over, but Stackhouse was not a part of this\r\nconsideration. He could not live a week without an abnormal consumption\r\nof water....\r\n\r\nFleury was talking about the stars. They would see Venus before dawn,\r\nhe said; the great one in their meridian now was Jupiter. “If we had a\r\nmarine-glass, we would be able to see his moons.... That,” he pointed\r\nto the brightest of the fixed stars, a splendid yellow gleam in the\r\neast, “that is Canopus, never seen north of the Gulf States at Home.\r\nIt’s so mighty that our little earth would turn molten in ten seconds\r\nif it came as near as our sun.”\r\n\r\nBellair leaned toward him listening. The preacher pointed out the\r\nSouthern Cross, and Alpha Centauri, almost the nearest of the sun’s\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nTheir thoughts groped naturally to such things. In the full realisation\r\nof their helplessness, they looked up. The background was a deep\r\nfleckless purple. Bellair hadn’t known the great stars of the northern\r\nskies, much less these splendid strangers. The brimming closeness\r\nof the dark sea harrowed the landsman’s heart of him; and there was\r\nsomething as great or greater than the actual terror of ultimate\r\nsubmerging. It was the fear of the fear; the same that causes men\r\nto leap from high places through the very horror of the thought of\r\nleaping. The water lapped the clinkered sides of the small boat. He\r\ntouched it. His flesh took from the coolness something that numbed the\r\npervading alarm; a message which the wet hand sensed, but the brain\r\ncould not interpret. The presence of the others forward sustained him;\r\nStackhouse in the stern was the downpull; thus Bellair was in the\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\nIt was yet far from dawn; certainly no lighter, but Bellair could see\r\nbetter. The woman was looking away. He knew that he would see her so,\r\nuntil the last day of her life--that profile of serene control, that\r\ncalm, far-seeing gaze.... What gave her this quiet power?... Already\r\nthe thoughts of the three were intimate matters to all. It seemed very\r\nnatural now to ask Fleury what gave the woman such strength.\r\n\r\n“It’s the sense that all is well, in spite of this physical\r\nestrangement from the world,” the preacher said. “Bellair, it’s the\r\nsense that nothing matters but the soul. It’s not belief; it’s knowing.\r\nShe has lost the sense of self. _She is through talking._ It is\r\nfinished with her. We talk, because it is not finished in us--but it is\r\nbeing accomplished. We talk because we want that peace; when it comes\r\nwe will not talk, but live it. It is exactly opposite to _desire_; you\r\ncan see that----”\r\n\r\nYes, Bellair could see that. He had but to turn back in his seat to\r\nconfront Stackhouse wringing his heavy twitching hands and begging for\r\nwater, begging like a leper, now that a face turned to him--the most\r\nfrightful picture of the work of desire and the fear of desire, that\r\nthe world or the underworld could furnish. Less than two hours before\r\nhe had drunk a quart and wasted a pint in his greed; and behind Bellair\r\nwas the silent woman and Fleury, thinking of others, full of the good\r\nof the world.... In the worldliness that came to him from Stackhouse,\r\nthe intimacy of the matter they had just talked about seemed startling.\r\n\r\n“One can’t help but notice what _you get from somewhere_--and what the\r\nwoman has,” Bellair added.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were in the grey mystery of dawn--alone, for they had drifted, and\r\nthe sailors in the other boat had begun to row at once. Stackhouse was\r\nlifted a little, brought nearer, possibly by the tension, which they\r\nall came to know so well--the tension of that grey hour, before the day\r\nreveals the sea.\r\n\r\n“It was my ship,” he whimpered. “It was my hamber--McArliss was mine\r\nand the service----”\r\n\r\n“You’d have had them all yet, but you amused yourself watching poor\r\nMcArliss fall into the drink. You would have had it all--just the same\r\nthis morning--for he would never have hit the reef on duty----”\r\n\r\nIt was Bellair who spoke, and the thing had suddenly appeared very\r\nclear to him. Stackhouse did not falter from the present, his huge head\r\ndarting east and west to stare through the whitening film.\r\n\r\n“It was my hamber. There is room here at my feet. It was little, yet\r\nmeant so much. I should not have troubled you----”\r\n\r\nThe lack of it seemed suddenly to hurt him even more poignantly.\r\n\r\n“You will all go to hell with your talk of beace,” he declared, looking\r\nbetween them but at no pair of eyes. “I will go first, what with the\r\ndrink dying out, but you will not be long. There is hell for me, but\r\nfor all alike. You may live days--but the longer, the more hell. And\r\nyou will all come at last--to the long deep drink of the brine----”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come now, Stackhouse,” said Bellair. “It may not turn out so\r\nbadly. You’ve had luck before. You’ve talked much to me of luck--and\r\ndeaths of others. If it’s your turn--face it as your innumerable\r\nfriends faced it.”\r\n\r\nThe man was undone before them. The flesh of his jaws stood out, as if\r\npulled by invisible fingers. His heavy lips rubbed together, so that\r\nthey turned from the sight of them.\r\n\r\n“There was room in the boat for that basket of rum,” he called out\r\ninsanely. “It was all to me. There is no talk of God for me--rum was\r\nall I had!... I would have been so quiet. It would have been here at my\r\nfeet, but for that fool who talks of God, and can never know the thirst\r\nof men.”\r\n\r\nFleury turned to him, his face deeply troubled. It occurred to Bellair\r\nthat there was something to what Stackhouse said. Fleury, in kicking\r\nback the hamper, had kept the devil of Stackhouse from entering the\r\nboat, and Stackhouse served no other.... More and more it was twisting\r\nhis brain, as young alligators twist at a carcass.\r\n\r\n“I would have had it here between my knees. And I would have had the\r\nlittle bottle from the cabin--the last that boots you to sleep----”\r\n\r\n“And so that is what you sent her back for--sent her to her death----”\r\n\r\n“You lie. She was held here--trying to get the hamber to me. There\r\nwould have been time. She would have gone and come. She would have been\r\nhere now----”\r\n\r\nBellair and Fleury glanced at each other.\r\n\r\n“I am rotted with drink--and will drink the brine first, but you\r\nwill follow me. You will bring it up with your hands and drink--and\r\ndrink----”\r\n\r\nHe was looking at Fleury now. The intensity of thirst in the spectacle\r\nof him--the presence of that vast galvanism of thirst--was like a\r\nburning sun in their throats. The baby cried, and the mother drew him\r\nshudderingly to her breast. Fleury swallowed hard, his face haggard\r\nand drawn in the daybreak. He went over and took his seat before the\r\nmonster. Bellair was tempted to ask him to be easy, but there was no\r\nneed. Fleury turned and drew a cup of water and handed it to the other.\r\nBellair’s jaws ached cruelly from the drain of empty glands.\r\n\r\n“We should pity you, Stackhouse,” he said, “but we are not facing\r\ndeath now. You fill the boat with thirst--you fill the sea--with your\r\nthinking drink and talking drink--until you bring a cry of thirst\r\nto the little child. It’s as if we had gone sixty hours--instead of\r\nsix----”\r\n\r\nHe talked on for the sake of the woman. Stackhouse drank and grew\r\nsilent. Bellair felt better and braver--even though the full light\r\nrevealed nothing but empty sea and heavenly sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nBellair surveyed his world as the dawn came up.... Thirst and\r\nfasting; possibly, the end.... The peculiar part of his open boat\r\ncontemplations, no two were alike. Physical denial hurried him from one\r\nplane to another from which he regarded his world--his two worlds, for\r\nStackhouse behind was one, and his friends forward, another; the one\r\ndrawing his love, courage and finest ideals; the other, repression\r\nof self, lest he wear himself out in hatred. They were not talkers in\r\nfront. He had not seen quite the entire fulfilment of Fleury’s meaning\r\nabout talking until late moments. The Faraway Woman invariably said\r\nlittle; the child was the silentest of all; Fleury had met this demon\r\nand put it away. Stackhouse had talked and talked, and to the pictures\r\nhe made with words, he belonged not at all, but to unspeakable things.\r\nBellair remembered his own talk to Filbrick. It made him writhe. He had\r\nbecome crossed and complicated and ineffective that day. He had not\r\ntalked in the straight line of heart and brain. He saw that a man who\r\ntalks that which he is not, is less than nothing, as Stackhouse was\r\nless than nothing.\r\n\r\n“How far are we from anywhere, Bellair?” Fleury asked.\r\n\r\n“We weren’t supposed to strike land before Chatham or Bounty\r\nIsland--two days’ sail this side of New Zealand, as I understand it.\r\nWe lost land six--a week ago to-day--_Madre de Dios_, McArliss called\r\nit--off the west Coast of South America. With good wind McArliss\r\nplanned to sight the Islands off New Zealand in three weeks. We had\r\na week’s good sailing until yesterday--so we are a fortnight, as the\r\n_Jade_ reckoned, from--_your home_.”\r\n\r\nBellair turned to the woman. She did not speak.\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose we struck coral?” Fleury asked.\r\n\r\nThe subject seemed very hopeless. “I saw the charts in McArliss’ cabin.\r\nNo reefs were charted according to our passage. We may have been\r\noff our course. But I do not understand. The mate took our bearings\r\nyesterday noon. I do not know what he reported to the Captain----”\r\n\r\n“It may have been a sunken wreck that we struck,” said Fleury.\r\n\r\nBellair had thought of that. He turned to Stackhouse, who might have\r\nhad something to say, but the other stared at them balefully--at their\r\nfaces, not meeting their eyes. Either he had not followed their words,\r\nor chose to take no part.\r\n\r\n“If we are in the course of any ships at all, it would be of one\r\npassing our route, from the Horn to the Islands,” Fleury added. “I\r\ndoubt if it would do us any good to row. We must not tax our strength.\r\nIf we are off our course, we cannot tell whether it is to the north or\r\nsouth, so nothing is positively to be gained. It’s a question of hands\r\nup. The other boat set out for somewhere at once. If they find ship\r\nthey will tell the story----”\r\n\r\nIt appeared a useless recounting of obvious things. Bellair had thought\r\nthis out bit by bit several times without finding the least substance\r\nto tie to. Fleury’s addition merely accentuated the bleakness of their\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n“Still,” the preacher added, “if there is nothing for us to do in the\r\nway of struggle--the rest is simplified. We may be thoroughly tested,\r\nbut I feel a strange confidence of our ultimate delivery. I thought of\r\nit before we had parted from the _Jade_. It came to me again in the\r\nnight. I believe it now. We do not belong to the deep--not all of us.”\r\n\r\nBellair wondered at the strength which came from this. He placed his\r\ntrust upon this man, as one having familiarity with a source which he\r\npersonally did not draw from. The preacher’s words were designed to\r\ncheer the woman, but he could not let them pass as merely for that.\r\nFleury had a conviction, or he would not have spoken so.\r\n\r\nThe air grew cooler during the long closing of that first day.\r\nBellair thought of his overcoat which lay in a roll under the narrow\r\nplanking forward where the woman sat. The bundle of New York papers\r\ndropped out, as he drew the garment forth. He opened one of the papers\r\nlaughingly.... The headlines were like voices from another world. The\r\nabyss between the real and the unreal yawned before his eyes now in\r\nthe open boat. New York seemed to be fighting in prints for things so\r\nlittle and unavailing. So little ago, he, Bellair, had moved among\r\nthem, as among things that counted. Now what was real was the woman’s\r\ncourage and the substance of Fleury’s faith, and the hope that came\r\nfrom the immensity. The deep contrasts of life held Bellair.\r\n\r\nAs the message of the press came up to his eyes, he sunk into queer\r\napathy, believed himself dreaming when he read his own name. He was not\r\nstartled; even that was not his, but an invention like the clicking\r\nof a watch, which marks off an illusion of the illusion time.... An\r\nafternoon paper, dated the second day after his departure from New\r\nYork; a brief statement of his departure with certain funds of Lot\r\n& Company; one item of a thousand dollars, several others suspected\r\nmissing.... There was a follow story in the next day’s issue: Bellair\r\nas yet unfound, was believed to have gone to the Cobalt; Bessie Brealt,\r\na professional singer, had passed an hour or two with the missing man\r\non the eve of his flight. He had spent money recklessly.... This was\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHe dumped the papers overside, and was sorry afterward; still, there\r\nwas not physical energy in him to explain, nor comprehension in the\r\nother two for such details. Lot & Company had sacrificed him to ward\r\noff disclosures he might make. Possibly Attorney Jackson had suggested\r\nthe step. It was very clear. Even if the station-porter had not mailed\r\nhis letter, they would have found his order of release in the safe. It\r\nwas a part of the other world--proper business from Lot & Company’s\r\npoint of view. He was marked a thief in his small circle. He seemed\r\nto see the face of the boarding-house woman as she heard the news.\r\nShe would search her house.... And Bessie Brealt.... The tempter,\r\nnotoriety, was responsible for her small, mean part. It wasn’t an\r\naccident. She must have looked at his card and told, for the reporters\r\nwould not have come to her.... It began to hurt him, mainly because of\r\nthe thoughts and dreams of helping her, which had come to him since,\r\nespecially here in the open boat. She had fallen into one of the little\r\ntricks of New York--to break into print at any cost. There wasn’t much\r\nreality in the rest, nor much chance of his needing New York again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... Three and a child in a small boat. The pale moon-crescent, her\r\nbow to the sinking sun, appeared higher in the west. What a cosmic\r\nintervention--since last night when he had seen her first arc and the\r\nearth-shine from the deck of the _Jade_! And what a supper he had gone\r\ndown to afterward! There was wrench in that--an age since then.... No\r\none had spoken for a long time. Bellair wondered if the man and woman\r\nthought of food as he did.\r\n\r\nThree and a child in the empty sea, and the great suns of night were\r\ncoming forth in the deepening dusk. They were strangers, but more\r\nreal than the sea. This was not like the earth at all; and yet the\r\n_Jade_ had been of the earth. Her fabric had contained the bond that\r\nheld from port to port. Stars and sea--one more real than the other,\r\nand different, too, for there was horror in looking down, but hope in\r\nlooking up. Something in his breast answered the universality--but\r\nquailed before the deep.\r\n\r\n... Just now Bellair, lifting his overcoat to draw it closer around\r\nhim, sensed its unaccustomed weight on the left. His hand sped thither,\r\ntouched the full bottle of Bourbon whiskey purchased in Savannah. His\r\nhand remained with it a moment. A shudder passed through the small boat\r\nfrom Stackhouse, who had come to from another hideous sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nBellair stared into the sea. No one had spoken for many minutes. It was\r\nclose to noon. Though all that had to do with memory since the sinking\r\nof the _Jade_ was treacherous, according to his recounting, it was but\r\nthe second day; that is, the mother-ship had gone down in the heart of\r\nnight before last.... Bellair had given away to temptation, when he let\r\nhis eyes sink into the depths. He had fought it for hours, and knew\r\nthat nothing good would come of it, but there was so much to fight, he\r\nhad not the further strength for this.\r\n\r\nThe sea was calm on the surface, but there appeared a movement below,\r\nso vast and unhurried, that it was like some planetary function.\r\nThere seemed a draw of the depths southward, an under-movement toward\r\nthe Pole. At times a cloud of purple would rise from far beneath and\r\nshut off his peering, like the movement of blueing in a laundry-tub\r\nbefore it is well-diffused. It came to him that this was but a denser\r\ncloud-land--an ocean of condensed clouds, moved not by winds alone,\r\nbut the stirring of the earth’s mysterious inner attractions, which\r\nin their turn were determined by the sun and moon and stars. It was\r\nall orderly, but he, Bellair, was out of order. And such a little\r\nthing--a quart of cool water, and any one of the thousands of meals he\r\nhad thoughtlessly, gratelessly bought and paid for--thousands consumed\r\nwith a book at hand, or a paper to keep his mind off the perfunctory\r\nroutine of feeding himself. Hundreds of meals he had taken, because\r\nit was the hour, and a cigar was more pleasurable afterward; meals in\r\nhis room--paper packages of food, pails of ice, chilled bottles with\r\na mist forming on them; saloon lunches, plates of colored sausages,\r\ncreamy-rose slices of ham, tailored radishes and herring pickled in\r\nonions.... There was not a fish in the sea, not a movement but the\r\nblueing, and that slide of the under-ocean river to the Pole.\r\n\r\nYet there _was_ something in there--an end to this disorder. It would\r\ntake all he had left--the good air. It was like a knife or a gun or a\r\npoison-pill.... The movement below was so strong that it would grip\r\nhim, shut him from the air, and leave him slithering along toward the\r\nPole, sometimes sinking sideways, and then rising, forever seeking his\r\nbalance ... not forever. He pictured himself in a school of herring,\r\nthousands of bright lidless eyes, thousands of bubbles, like eyes, from\r\ntheir mouths opening and shutting--he slithering sideways--his hands\r\nmoving in the tugs and pressures. They would cease to dart from his\r\nmovements, understanding them as the ground-birds know the wind in the\r\ngrass. Lips and eye-lids and nostrils--they would have food. Food was\r\nthe great event of the day to all things--except men. Men ate by the\r\nclock, ate to smoke, ate to soften the hearts of women ... yet after\r\nall food was food.... Or one big fish.... Or two fighting for him....\r\nOr one finding him lying still, a slow fanning of fins against the\r\npurple pressures, watching to be sure--then the strike.... Once he had\r\nexamined a minnow after the strike of a bass.... Where would _he_ be\r\nin that strike--or in that herring school-room--not that slithering\r\nsideways thing--but _he_? Would he be watching humorously, or back\r\nin the cage with Mr. Sproxley, or in Bessie’s bedroom? Was it all a\r\nmyth about that other _he_? It seemed a myth with his stomach sinking,\r\ntightening like a dripping rag between a pair of mighty elbows. In the\r\ncentre of the rag was a compressed cork, and in the cork, a screw was\r\ntwisting.\r\n\r\nCork--that made him think of the whiskey. He turned from the water\r\nto the coat under the seat, his eyes blinking. His bare foot moved\r\npainfully to the coat and along the breast to the pocket, to the hard\r\nhump of the bottle.\r\n\r\nHis eyes suddenly filled with the figure of Stackhouse, whose attitudes\r\nwere an endless series of death tableaus, as his stories had also\r\npictured. His face had broken out into more beard, his eyes glazed,\r\nbody shapeless, like clothing stuffed with hair. His hands held the\r\nprimal significance of birth and death. They lay upon his limbs, the\r\nthumbs drawn into the palms, the first and little fingers of each\r\npointing straight down. Bellair thought of how death contracts the\r\nthumb, and how infants come with their thumbs in-drawn.\r\n\r\nAlso his mind was played upon by two distinct series of\r\nemotions--Stackhouse representing one set; Fleury and the Faraway Woman\r\nsignifying the other. He swung from power to power. Then his concern\r\nand fascination for Stackhouse changed from loathing and the visible\r\ntragedy, to a queer passage of conjecture regarding the worldwide\r\nprocesses which had nourished that huge body to its fall. In fact,\r\nBellair’s favourite restaurants returned to mind like a pageant;\r\nthe little inns on the Sound that he used to go summer Saturday\r\nafternoons; the one place in Staten where there were corn-cakes and\r\na view of the shipping; the myriad eating and drinking places of New\r\nYork; and from them all, one shop of chop and chicken-broils where the\r\nmiracles were done on wood-embers, so that even the smoke that filled\r\nthe place was seasoned nutriment.\r\n\r\n“They certainly knew how to buy,” he muttered aloud.\r\n\r\nIt was a kind of moan, and he added quickly: “I beg your pardon.”\r\n\r\nFleury and the woman regarded him with silent kindness.\r\n\r\n“I was just thinking of a man I knew--a buyer of canned goods,” he\r\nexplained hastily. “The bargains in canned-goods he had a way of\r\npulling off! There wasn’t a man in New York who could bring in lines of\r\nstuff at the figure he copped--a little runt of a man named Blath, who\r\nknew his business----”\r\n\r\nFleury leaned back as if reaching for support, his quiet smile not a\r\nlittle tender. His two browned hands came forward to Bellair’s knees,\r\nand he said with a devoted smile:\r\n\r\n“I’ll not forget that in a hurry.... Blath, you say his name was?”\r\n\r\nBellair knew well that he had not kept his mental pictures from\r\nFleury’s mind. His entire consciousness had been in steam and woodsmoke\r\nhaving to do with broiling meat. The three were worn thin, worn to\r\nfine receptivity, and caught one-another’s thought without effort of\r\nmany words.... Though he did not turn, a shock of pity came to him now\r\nfor the master. He had meant to save the opening of the whiskey for the\r\nnext dawn, vaguely thinking that if they should find the sea empty once\r\nmore, there would be that false strength to fall back upon. Stackhouse\r\ncould not live more than a day or two longer. He was torn by devils,\r\nhis only surcease being the snap of consciousness from time to time.\r\nThe whiskey had been upon Bellair’s mind like a curse. He wanted its\r\nforce for himself, but never really meant to use it, had not even given\r\nthe temptation leeway. His lot was cast with the forward forces; they\r\nwould not have touched the contents of his bottle. This did not change\r\nthe desire, however.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nThe third day. Bellair was light-headed from the scarcity of crackers.\r\nYesterday had been a mingled thirst and hunger day, but this was\r\ncharacterised by hunger incessant. To-morrow he anticipated with dread\r\nanother thirst horror, and after that, no hunger at all, but mighty\r\nagony that knew but the one word, _Water_. The keen airs of night and\r\nmorning, and the sterilised burning of the noons, constantly fanned\r\nand stimulated the natural demands of the body.... He had forgotten\r\nthe newspapers. Bessie’s face came before him--something of her deep\r\nheart-touching tones which changed him.\r\n\r\n“There must be a great woman there--a great fine woman--like this one.”\r\n\r\nHe did not turn. It may have been the first concession from his\r\nevery-day faculties of this woman’s actual beauty. He had already\r\ngranted this deeper within, where the understandings of men are wiser,\r\nbut harder to get at. Certain hours had shown him the clear quality\r\nof saints and martyrs; and he had seen in pure life-equation that the\r\nchild was worth his life or Fleury’s. He would have given his, as most\r\nwhite men would, but it was different to see the value and rightness of\r\nit....\r\n\r\nThere was now an unspeakable need in the stern. He drew the bottle from\r\nthe overcoat-pocket at his feet, without turning. Fleury and the woman\r\nwatched him. He cut the small wires with his knife, tore off the wafer,\r\nhalf-expectant of some sound from behind.... The day was ending. The\r\nyoung moon newly visible in the dusk began its curve into the west from\r\na higher point in the sky....\r\n\r\nThere was a screw in Bellair’s knife. It sank noiselessly into the\r\ncork, but the first creak of the stopper against the glass brought the\r\njolt. They all felt it--as if the great body had fallen from a dream.\r\n\r\nStackhouse was staring at the thing in Bellair’s hands, his tongue\r\nvisible, his face filling with light. He rubbed his eyes, the\r\nbeginnings of articulation deep in his throat. He was trying to make\r\nhimself believe it was not a vision. That harrowed them. A pirate would\r\nhave pitied him--reptile desire imaged not in the face alone, but in\r\nthe hands and all. Bellair poured a big drink in a tin-cup. Fleury\r\npassed him a gill of water. Stackhouse drained the cup with a cry.\r\n\r\nSomething earth-bound slowly left his face. In contrast it grew mild\r\nand reckonable; but within an hour he was wild with pain, and dangerous\r\nfor night was falling. In the light of the moon there was treachery.\r\nBellair and Fleury sat together in the centre. The other’s bulk was\r\ngreat and the boat small. In becoming custodian of a bottle of whiskey,\r\nBellair now required help. He wished it in the sea, but there was a\r\npang of cruelty about that. The new force that animated Stackhouse\r\nhad to be reckoned with. It was both cunning and destructive. There\r\nwas no murder in their hearts.... Stackhouse drew his feet under him,\r\nhelping them with his hands; his eyeballs turned upward from the agony\r\nof cramps in his limbs; then he sank forward on his knees. The craft of\r\ndesire had turned from fighting to speech. The moon was grey upon his\r\nbreast and gleamed from his eyes.\r\n\r\n“You will listen to a man who is dying. Yes, Bellair, you will\r\nlisten--who listened to me so much.... Give me drink, so I can talk----”\r\n\r\n“It may save you--but not if you take it all at once.”\r\n\r\nThe creature winced, but his passion moved to its appointed ends. He\r\ndrew forth the large brown wallet they had often seen; rubbed it in his\r\nhands, until his fingers could feel; then opened the leather band. From\r\none receptacle he lifted a thick package of bank-notes.\r\n\r\n“I liked you, Bellair--almost as I liked one Belding. I could have done\r\nmuch for you. I hate _that_ man, for he has made my death hard----”\r\n\r\nHis face turned toward Fleury, but did not meet the preacher’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“The _Jade_ brought a sweet cargo to Ameriga, and Stackhouse does\r\nnot bank in New York.... Bellair, I want to drink--so the talk will\r\ncome----”\r\n\r\nSo absurd was the sound of cargo and banking that Bellair thought his\r\nmind had wandered again, yet he said:\r\n\r\n“You are better. You cannot drink each hour. If this is to help you,\r\nyou must be sane.”\r\n\r\n“I have something to say of imbortance--you will help me, Bellair. It\r\nis for you.”\r\n\r\nThe faces of Fleury and the mother gave him no help. They were kind,\r\nbut the thing seemed beneath them, as if they were waiting for him to\r\ncome back from it.\r\n\r\n“You have stood by that man, and not by me,” Stackhouse said hoarsely.\r\n“So that I meant to toss this in the sea at the last--this and all the\r\npapers----”\r\n\r\nHe lifted the bank-notes and showed him the collection of\r\nseparately-banded documents.\r\n\r\n“I am a rich man, and I have no heir. I had thought of you, but you\r\nturned away from me and did not continue to listen. You went to him\r\nof the breachings--but you have now what is needful for me and I will\r\nbay. I have no heir. I said that before. I dell you now. A dying man\r\ndoes not lie. There are papers to make you rich, for I have other\r\nfortunes. Look, I will toss it into the sea--if you do not give me that\r\nbottle----”\r\n\r\nBellair laughed at him.\r\n\r\n“These are thousand dollar notes--there are fifty of them----”\r\n\r\nBellair turned aside for an instant. Money and papers of more\r\nmoney--these were very far from fanning excitement in his breast. A\r\nloaf and a jug of fresh water were real; the moon’s higher appearance\r\neach night, and the majestic plan of the night-suns, these were real.\r\nFleury, the woman and the babe, lost in the brimming darkness of\r\nearth’s ocean--they were real. Like the stars they had to do with the\r\nmighty Conceiver of it all. They were a part of the Conception--and so\r\nthey were real--but the dollars of men....\r\n\r\n“And do you know what I will do--after I have tossed this into the sea?”\r\n\r\nThe question brought him back quickly.\r\n\r\n“No, Stackhouse,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“I will come for you and dake that bottle. I am big. I have strength. I\r\nwill dake it--or you will kill me--and that will be the end----”\r\n\r\nBellair thought of that. There was a pistol in his coat. He did not\r\nwant to use it. He believed Stackhouse would do as he said.\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, Bellair----”\r\n\r\n“If I give it to you--oh, not for that rubbish!” he pointed to the\r\nwallet. “If I give it to you--you will die more quickly----”\r\n\r\n“That is what I want.”\r\n\r\n“But it is not our way----”\r\n\r\nStackhouse tore loose from his shirtpocket the heavy gold watch and its\r\nheavier chain, dropped the whole into one of the folds of the wallet to\r\nweight it down. “It will sink,” he said.\r\n\r\n“To hell with it----”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, Bellair!” Stackhouse moaned, his arm rising with the\r\nwallet and falling again.\r\n\r\nAt that instant Bellair thought of Bessie Brealt and her career.... He\r\nturned to Fleury and the Mother. They were regarding him with kindest\r\nconcern--as if he were a loved one who could not fail to do well in any\r\nevent. Then he thought of the work that Fleury might do--the preacher\r\nwho had finished with talk, and was so eager to act.... And just then,\r\nthe little child turned to him from the mother’s breast--a puzzled\r\nlook, but calm, and a flicker of the damp upper lip, as if it would\r\nlike to smile, but was not sure.\r\n\r\nBellair held out the whiskey. The wallet was thrust in his hands for\r\nreception of the bottle--a frenzied transaction.\r\n\r\nThey begged him to spare it for his own peace. They gave him water, but\r\npoor Stackhouse could not live with the stuff in his hands. In fifteen\r\nminutes the bottle was drained, and then the monster wept.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   5\r\n\r\nThe night roved on like a night in still mountains. The young moon had\r\nsunk behind the sea. Jupiter in meridian glory seemed trying to bring\r\nhis white fire to the dying red of Antares.... A dark night of stars\r\nnow, since the upstart moon had left the deeper purple. Most of all,\r\nBellair was fascinated by the great yellow gleam of Canopus. It was\r\na dry, pure dark--no drip in that night--but a thirsty horror in the\r\nsaline lapping of the ocean against the planks.\r\n\r\nStackhouse was headless in the shadow, his piglike breathing a part\r\nof all. Fleury, the mother and the child slept; the preacher’s head\r\nclose to the knees of the woman. Bellair marked that, and that Fleury\r\nloved her. At times the preacher’s whole life seemed an effort to make\r\nher eat and drink; and as for Fleury himself it often appeared that he\r\nrequired no better nutriment than that of conferring food and water\r\nupon the others. As custodian, he claimed authority for his action....\r\nBellair thought long of Bessie. He was watching the east at last for\r\nVenus to arise ahead of the sun....\r\n\r\n... But Bessie became blurred. He did not understand. Either his\r\nbrain had another picture, or the original of the singing girl was\r\nfading.... A New York voice, no passion, but ambition, an excellent\r\nvoice--and such a beautiful, girlish breast.... Bellair tried to\r\nshake this coldness from him. This was not being true. He had a faint\r\nsuspicion that a man’s woman is more apt to depart from him while he\r\nis at her side than when he is away. It is because another has come,\r\nif passion for the old dies, when one is away. Alone and apart, man is\r\nmore ardent, in fact, unless a new picture composes.... He thought of\r\nDavy Acton, the office boy at Lot & Company’s, that wistful, sincere\r\nface--and then Bellair gave way to the night.\r\n\r\nThis was a new sensation. It came from the hunger and thirst. He could\r\n_let go_. The purple immensity would then take him. A half-hour, even\r\nan hour, would pass. It was not sleep, very different from that. He was\r\nnot altogether lost. A little drum-beat would come back to him from the\r\nmighty revery-space, and his heart would answer the beat. He seemed to\r\nbe on the borderland of the Ultimate Secret; and invariably afterward\r\nhe was amazed at what he had been--so sordid and sunken and depraved\r\nwas the recent life he had known.\r\n\r\n“But I was what the days and years seemed to want of me,” he muttered.\r\n\r\nThat was the gall of it. Days and years are betrayers; all the\r\nactivities of the world are betrayers. He glimpsed the great patience\r\nof the scheme. Only man makes haste. Myriad pressures, subtle and\r\nstill-voiced, tighten upon a man, bringing just the suggestion that all\r\nis not well with him. Then there are the more obvious pressures--fever,\r\ndesire, the death of a man’s loves--to make him stop and look and\r\nlisten. But so seldom does he relate these to the restlessness of his\r\nsoul. Rather he attributes them to the general misery of life. He has\r\nbeen taught to do so--the false teaching.... For general misery is not\r\nthe plan of life. If _children_ could only be taught that it is all\r\nsuperbly balanced, the plan perfect; that not a momentary stress of\r\nsuffering comes undeserved; that the burden of all suffering is to make\r\na man change!... A sentence came so clearly to him that even his lips\r\nformed it.\r\n\r\n“The plan of life is for joy!”\r\n\r\nHe saw the need of every hundredth man at least, arising to repeat\r\nthis sentence around the world--arising from his pain and husks like\r\nthe Younger Son, and returning to the joy of the Father’s House....\r\nSomething was singing in him from his thought of _children_.\r\n\r\n“We’re too old,” he thought, meaning the millions of men caught in\r\nthe world as he had been, “but the children could learn. They could\r\nchange----”\r\n\r\nHe had turned to the bow. Fleury was a nearer shadow, sitting, head\r\nbowed forward. The Mother’s head lay back against Bellair’s coat, the\r\nchild across her knees.... That faint grey light was about her. He had\r\nnot noted this at first; it seemed to have come from the moment of\r\ncontemplation--something like starlight, something like the earth-shine\r\nthat Fleury explained. Her lips were parted, and her eyes seemed held\r\nshut, not as if she slept but as if she were thinking of something dear\r\nto her--her face wasted a little.\r\n\r\nHe saw it more clearly than the faintness of the light would\r\nsuggest--and to Bellair’s breast came a sudden sense of her expectancy.\r\nIt seemed she were awake, but lying back with eyes shut awaiting a\r\nlover, her face wasted a little from the burning of expectation. For\r\na moment it was very beautiful to him. Then all was spoiled--for the\r\npersonal entered. Almost before he had any volition in the matter, his\r\nmind had flashed across the interval of space between them--as if he\r\nwere the one to bring that token to the parted lips.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head with impatience, and the miseries of the hour rushed\r\nhome to his mind.\r\n\r\n... Fleury was awake and they were whispering, the woman still asleep.\r\n\r\n“The plan of the world is for joy,” Bellair said wearily. “We are all\r\ntaught that it is a vale of tears--that’s the trouble--taught that we\r\nmust grab what we can.”\r\n\r\n“If we won’t learn from joy--we’ve got to take the pain,” said the\r\npreacher. “We’ve got to get out of the conception of time and space as\r\nthe world sees it to catch a glimpse of the joy of the plan. We are\r\nin the midst of a superb puzzle. To those who see only the matter and\r\nnot the meaning, life is an evil country, a country of dragons and\r\nmonsters. But there’s a soul to it all, and man has a soul. If a man\r\nbegins to use his soul to see and think with, the puzzle begins to\r\nunfold. A man’s soul isn’t of matter. It’s a pilgrim come far, far to\r\ngo--very eager to get this particular journey through matter ended----”\r\n\r\n“But why make the journey?”\r\n\r\n“To learn evil.”\r\n\r\n“The Younger Son wasted himself afield----”\r\n\r\n“Was he not placed afterward above the elder in the Father’s heart?”\r\nFleury asked. “Could he not appreciate the Father’s House better than\r\nhim who had not left it? Man is greater than angels--that’s hinted at\r\neverywhere in the Scriptures. Angels are unalloyed good. The man who\r\nhas mastered matter becomes a creative force. All the great stories\r\nof the world tell the same story--the wanderings of Ulysses, the\r\ntasks of Hercules. The soul’s mastery of each task and escape from\r\neach peril and illusion is an added lesson--finally the puzzle breaks\r\nopen. The adventurer sees the long journey of the soul, not this\r\nlittle earth-crossing. He sees that his misery now is but a dip of the\r\nvalley--that the long way is a steadily rising road--that the plan _is_\r\nfor joy.”\r\n\r\nIt came home to him closer than ever before that night. His soul had\r\ntried to express itself and ordain his higher ways these many years,\r\nbut he had lost his way in the world. He perceived that all men lose\r\ntheir way; that he had suddenly been shaken apart so he could see.\r\nIt was luck in his case--the misery at Lot & Company’s, the singing\r\nof Bessie Brealt, the unparalleled contrasts here in the open boat.\r\nBut why should he be shown, and not the millions of other imprisoned\r\nmen? Was this a part of the great patience of the scheme again? Would\r\nsomething happen to each man in due season, some force in good time to\r\nhelp him to rise and be free?\r\n\r\n“The man who ties himself to the pilgrim--and not the sick little\r\nchattering world creature--suddenly finds that he has but one job,”\r\nFleury said presently. “He’s got to tell about it----”\r\n\r\nThe world suddenly smote Bellair.\r\n\r\n“Why, men would say a man was crazy if he told the things we have\r\nthought this night,” he said, leaning forward. “Maybe we are a bit\r\nunsound. Perhaps these are illusions we are harbouring--vagaries\r\nfrom drying up and wasting away, similar to the vagaries of\r\nalcohol--doubtless----”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was like waking from a dream--the horrible sounds now from the\r\nstern. Bellair heard Fleury’s voice. Turning, he saw Venus before\r\nanything else. It was the thought that he had fallen into the revery\r\nwith, and had to be finished on the way out.\r\n\r\nUnder that superb vision of morning, Stackhouse was kneeling, his\r\nbreast against the rail,--bringing up to his mouth great palm-fuls of\r\nbrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   6\r\n\r\nThe things that happened in the open boat on this fourth day are not\r\naltogether to be explained. A metaphysician from the East explained\r\na similar visitation--but like many explanations of the East, the\r\nfoundations of his discussion were off the ground. He did not begin\r\nwith stuff that weighs-up avoirdupois. The West can weigh the moon\r\nand estimate the bulk of Antares’ occulted companion, but in cases\r\nwhere _things_ cease to be weighable, our side of the world sits back\r\nwith the remark, “It is well enough to hypothecate the immaterial,\r\nbut what’s the good of it when you can’t see it?” Also when the East\r\ngently suggests an opinion, the West rises to declare, “Why, you people\r\nhaven’t got gas or running water in your houses.”\r\n\r\nNow occasionally there comes a time when the Western eye sees something\r\nthat it can’t touch or smell exactly, and it is easier to disbelieve\r\nits own senses than to change its point of view for an Eastern one.\r\nAccordingly it says, “I was crazy with the heat,” or as Bellair was\r\nprone to explain away the visitation of this day, “The thirst and the\r\nhunger had got to me.”\r\n\r\nThere follows, without further peroration, an unheated narrative of\r\nwhat _appeared_ to take place on that fourth day:\r\n\r\nAs was expected from drinking the brine, Stackhouse went mad. The\r\nlook of the great creature, his very identity, changed, went out from\r\nhim, and something else came in. This happens when a dog goes mad. We\r\nhave had to reckon with it in our own families. If that which we knew\r\npasses, without something foreign taking its place, the result would\r\nbe a mere inert mass waiting for death. The alienists have given us\r\nthe word _obsession_ to explain that which comes instead, making an\r\nobscenity and violence of that which we knew. In the olden days these\r\nEnterers were known as demons. A man named Legion was beset with them,\r\nand Another with a strong will came and, according to the story, freed\r\nLegion. That which had defiled him entered a herd of swine, the bars of\r\nwhich were somehow down at the time....\r\n\r\nThey had ceased to hate Stackhouse. The old Master was gone into who\r\nknows what long feeding dream? This was merely his body that they\r\nwatched for an hour or two in the forenoon. In fact, Bellair had\r\nstudied the departure with some detachment. He was sitting as usual in\r\nthe centre of the boat, glad that the Stackhouse agony was done. There\r\nwas a moment in which it appeared that death was stealing in rapidly,\r\nand another in which a new kind of life entered the body--as vandals\r\nenter to despoil a house after the tenant has moved away.\r\n\r\nThe hunched body had suddenly reached for him like a great ape. Bellair\r\nhad felt the crippling force of the touch, and an almost equal force\r\nfrom the thought that flashed in his mind--to use the pistol.... The\r\nboat had rocked beneath them. The blackness of much blood was in\r\nBellair’s brain. The struggle was brief. Through it all, Bellair heard\r\nthe cries of the child. Just as he was ready to fail, the monster sat\r\nback, his teeth snapping in his beard--the huge hands feeling for him,\r\nas one blinded.\r\n\r\n“Change places with me, Bellair.”\r\n\r\nThis was from Fleury--midforenoon that fourth day. Bellair obeyed\r\nbecause he was afraid of the pistol at hand.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to kill him,” he panted.\r\n\r\n“It will not come to that,” Fleury answered.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the transfer of seats was made. Bellair relied\r\nvaguely upon the preacher’s greater strength which was not of limb and\r\nshoulder. The monster dropped to his knees to renew the fight.\r\n\r\n“Be still,” Fleury commanded. “Be still and rest----”\r\n\r\nStackhouse himself would not have faltered before that voice of\r\nFleury’s, but there was a force in it that prevailed for a moment upon\r\nthe obsession. The air was full of strain.... They heard the heart in\r\nthe poor body. The blue-tipped hands were upraised from the bottom of\r\nthe boat--the face was toward them. Bellair and the Faraway Woman could\r\nsee only the back of Fleury’s head. The strain was like a vice in the\r\nopen boat.\r\n\r\nBellair contemplated the mystery: that this force, lower and more\r\ndestructive than Stackhouse, could be managed and subdued in part by\r\nthe energy of another’s will-power, when Stackhouse himself would have\r\nrequired brute strength.... He thought he understood what was going\r\non, though he would likely have scouted the same had some one told him.\r\nIn any event, Fleury was quieting the complicated thing before him....\r\nThey heard the heart-beats rise and sink, the hands often lifting from\r\nthe bottom. The entire passage of the battle was magnified before their\r\neyes. Hours passed. Fleury scarcely turned.\r\n\r\nSo far there is nothing to call in the Eastern metaphysicians, but\r\nthe day was not done, nor the dying galvanism of the monster. The\r\nafternoon was still bright, when the great hairy head cocked itself\r\nup differently--the eyes stretching open and suddenly filled with\r\nyellow-green light, the colour of squash-pulp close to the rind, but a\r\ntransparent light, that gathered the rays of the day in its expiring\r\nlucency, and held their own eyes--a lidless horror lifted from its\r\nbelly. The woman must have seen the change at the same instant, for her\r\ncry blended with the voice of Bellair. As one, they understood that\r\nthis was a different force for Fleury to meet--a wiser, more ancient\r\nand terrific force, from the bowels of the world of evil possibly,\r\nwithout relation to Stackhouse, but with a very thrilling relation to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe whole face had a different look. It was rising higher. The hands\r\nwere braced upon the grating, pushing the body up. They were accustomed\r\nto the loosed havoc of bestiality which Stackhouse had left upon his\r\nfeatures--but this that looked out from his eyes was knit and intent.\r\n\r\nFleury’s hand groped back.\r\n\r\n“It will not answer me,” he was saying. “This is different. It will not\r\nobey me. Take my hand, Bellair.... Yes, and take hers with the other.\r\nWe must drive it out.”\r\n\r\nWeariness more than death was in the speech. He had struggled for\r\nhours. It was the voice of a man who had fought to his soul’s end.\r\nBellair held his hand and the woman’s, but felt himself the betrayer.\r\nThis had come _for him_! He was the prophet lying still while the\r\nsailors deliberated. They must cast him into the sea, before this thing\r\ncould be willed into quiescence. Concentration on his part was broken\r\nby this conviction.\r\n\r\nThe body of Stackhouse was lifted to its knees--the different face\r\nlooking out of the eyes. They sat before it like terrified children;\r\nthe eyes found them one after another, steadily, with unearthly frigid\r\nhumour, like some creative force of evil, integrated of the ages,\r\ncharged with intrepid will, a ruling visitant that would tarry but an\r\ninstant for the climax.\r\n\r\nIt was not human, save in the shape and feature for their recognition;\r\nits difference from the human was its frank knowing destructiveness.\r\nHumanity is mainly unconscious of the processes of evil; _this had\r\nchosen_. This was of the pull of the earth, and knew its power. It\r\nseemed known to Bellair as if from some ancient meeting. He could never\r\nhave remembered, however, without this return. It was devoid of sex,\r\nwhich seemed to bring to him some old deep problem that took its place\r\nwith his ineffable fear of the presence.\r\n\r\nSo Bellair sat between them, holding their hands, but powerless to\r\nhelp.... It was higher, looking out of the eyes of the body, in strange\r\nsolution with the fallen humanity of the face they knew. And Bellair\r\nknew _he_ was responsible.\r\n\r\n“You must depart. You do not belong here,” a voice said. Bellair could\r\nnot tell if it were Fleury’s or the woman’s or his own. It may have\r\nbeen merely a thought.\r\n\r\nThe thing had uprisen now. It lurched in the sway of the boat. Fleury\r\nand he were standing to meet the body that hurled itself forward....\r\nWater dashed over them. They were beneath the monster. Bellair felt\r\nmore than the crush of the weight of flesh, a force kindred to\r\nelectricity, but not electric, a smothering defiling dynamics, that\r\ndespoiled him by the low, cold depth of its vibration, rather than by\r\nthe fierce fury of it. Then he thought of the woman’s child. It came to\r\nhim like a pure gleam. The child must live. The thought was very real,\r\nout of the self, but not _for_ self.... It seemed that he heard the\r\nheart of Stackhouse break, and the demon hiss away.\r\n\r\nBellair looked up from the bottom of the boat. The woman’s face was\r\nvery close, his face between her hands.\r\n\r\n“... Yes, come back to us!” she was saying. “Oh, we could not live\r\nwithout you----”\r\n\r\nIt did not seem real to him for a moment. He turned from her merciful\r\neyes. Fleury was sitting there in the centre, holding the child with\r\nhands that trembled. The boat rode lightly, though water lay in the\r\nbottom. He turned farther. Yes, the seat in the stern was empty.\r\n\r\n“He is dead?” Bellair whispered.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“And we did not kill him,” Fleury added.\r\n\r\n“But how did he get overside?”\r\n\r\n“You helped,” they told him.\r\n\r\nHe did not remember. “And the child?”\r\n\r\n“The little Gleam is all right. All is well with us, Bellair.”\r\n\r\nSomething of the encounter returned now. “I do not belong here with\r\nyou,” he said. “The thing--at the last--came for me----”\r\n\r\nThen he realised how absurd this would sound--as if some ogre had come.\r\nYet they understood.\r\n\r\n“I thought it had come for me,” the woman answered quietly. “I said\r\nthat, and _he_----”she turned with a smile to the preacher,“--and he\r\nsaid the same--that it had come for him. We will forget that. Something\r\nfreed us----”\r\n\r\nBellair turned to the child.\r\n\r\n“It was the little Gleam who freed us,” Fleury said.\r\n\r\n“How did you get that name?” Bellair asked.\r\n\r\n“You said it.”\r\n\r\n“How long have I been lying here?”\r\n\r\n“Ten minutes.”\r\n\r\nHe rested a moment longer.... The woman was sane, the child unhurt.\r\nStackhouse was dead, and they had not murdered him. It was the fourth\r\nsunset.... Bellair sat up and turned his eyes to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe great body was near. It would not sink. They tried to row, but\r\nwere too weak to pull far. The calm sea would not cover it from their\r\neyes.... Even the birds did not come to it, and there was no tugging\r\nfrom the deep.\r\n\r\nThe terrible battle of the day had left them whimpering--drained men,\r\nin the pervading calm of the sea, under the dry cloudless heat and\r\nlight of the sky. Fleury and Bellair looked at each other and their\r\neyes said: “We did not murder him.” They looked again and found the\r\nwoman saner than they. They turned over her shoulder to the blotch\r\nupon the sea. It floated high, drifted with them. They could not speak\r\nconnectedly, but longed for the night.... At last, they heard her voice:\r\n\r\n“It is very great to me to know that there are such men in the world.\r\nAs a little girl in New Zealand I used to picture such heroes--such\r\nbrothers and heroes. I came to doubt it afterward, and that was evil in\r\nme. I see now that the dream was true----”\r\n\r\nThey listened like two little boys.\r\n\r\n“See, the cool is coming!” she added. “The child is glad, too.\r\nTo-night, we will talk!”\r\n\r\n“You will tell us a story?” Fleury said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, when it is darker. It is all so safe and quiet now. We are all\r\none.”\r\n\r\nThat meant something to Bellair. Later when it was dark, and they had\r\nsupped, he said:\r\n\r\n“It’s good--the way you count me in, but you shouldn’t. I don’t belong,\r\nmuch as I’d like to. I misjudged you at first. I misjudged Fleury--and\r\nhim----” he pointed over her shoulder to the sea.\r\n\r\n“It will be gone in the morning,” she whispered, patting his hand. “We\r\nare three--and the child.”\r\n\r\n“Three, and God bless you,” said Fleury. “Three and the little\r\nGleam----”\r\n\r\n“The Gleam,” the woman repeated, holding the child closer. “I love\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“We are three and we follow the Gleam.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   7\r\n\r\nFleury took the child. The Faraway Woman sat straight in her seat, so\r\nthat Bellair wondered at her strength. Her strength came to him. The\r\ndeeps of his listening were opened to her low voice. The story came\r\nto them with all the colour and contour of her thought-pictures--a\r\nrichness from the unspoken words which cannot be given again:\r\n\r\n“It’s about a little girl whom I will call Olga,” she said. “That is\r\nreally her name, and the story is the little girl’s truly. I shall only\r\ntell part of it to-night, for it is long and I would only tell you the\r\nhappy part--to-night.\r\n\r\n“Olga’s father and mother and the other children lived in a low house\r\nby the open road that led to Hamilton. He raised sheep for a living on\r\nthe rolling pasture-lands near the Waikata river, a hundred miles south\r\nof Auckland.... Yes, Olga was born in New Zealand--the youngest of a\r\nhouseful of sisters. They belong more to the latter part of the story\r\nwhich I shall not tell to-night--just the happy part to-night.... The\r\nfirst thing that Olga remembered as belonging to the Great Subject was\r\nspoken by her father one evening when they were all together at their\r\nsupper of bread and milk:\r\n\r\n“‘... One never knows. It is best not to turn away any stranger, not\r\neven if he is shabby and ill-looking. I heard of a house where a\r\nstranger was turned away. They were not bad people, but supper was\r\nover, the things put aside, and the woman was very tired. The stranger\r\nwas taken in at the next house, and in the morning he seemed different\r\nto them--not shabby or ill-looking at all, but rested and laughing,\r\nwith bright lights about his hair. Always afterward, that house was\r\nblest, but the other house went on in its misery and labour. One never\r\nknows. It is best not to turn any stranger away.’\r\n\r\n“Now Olga understood that from beginning to end. Many times before she\r\nhad tried to follow the talk at the table, but the words would come\r\ntoo fast, and she would fall away to her own manner of seeing things.\r\nThis talk simplified many matters for her, and seemed greatly to be\r\napproved. So in the evenings she began to watch for _her_ guest up the\r\nlong level road that led to Hamilton. All that summer Olga thought of\r\nit and watched, though she was very little and only five. Sometimes\r\nwhen it was not yet dark she would venture forth a few steps and\r\nstare up the long road, until the house of their distant but nearest\r\nneighbour was all blurred in the night. Just behind her cottage in the\r\nother direction, the road dipped into a ravine, and the trees grew up\r\nfrom it, shutting off the distance. No place could be more wonderful\r\nthan the ravine at midday, for the shades were quickened with birds,\r\nbees, flowers and much beside that only Olga saw, but its enchantment\r\nwas too keen for the evening, and the night came there very quickly.\r\n\r\n“Her Guest would never come from the ravineway, but from the long, open\r\nroad--Olga was sure of this. Yet when stopping to think, she became\r\nafraid he would not be allowed to pass the neighbour’s house. Their\r\nlittle Paul was her frequent playmate, and Paul’s father and mother\r\nwere most good and hospitable people, the last on the Hamilton road\r\nto let a stranger go by, without food and shelter. And Paul would\r\nbe looking, for he was almost always interested in her things....\r\nBut perhaps they would be in at supper and not see the stranger; or\r\nperhaps he would not want to stop there, but would know that _she_ was\r\nwatching. She made very certain that he would not get by her house\r\nunobserved.\r\n\r\n“Spring had come again. The pale blue hepaticas were peeping into\r\nbloom. There was one day that ended in Olga’s most wonderful night. The\r\nsun had gone down, but not the light. The sky was crowded with rich\r\ngold like the breast of the purple martin--flickerings of beautiful\r\nlight in the air, as if little balls of happiness were bursting of\r\nthemselves. The shadows were soft on the long road; the tiles of the\r\nneighbour’s low house were like beaten gold, and the perfume of the\r\nhyacinths flooded everywhere into the silence. All that heaven could\r\never be was in that broad splendour and sweetness--the ravine a soft\r\npurple stillness behind, and a faint mist of red falling in the distant\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n“He was coming. She knew him for The Guest from afar. The neighbours’\r\nhouse was already dimmed, but the stranger was clear, so that she knew\r\nhe had passed their door. She ran forth to meet him, and no one called\r\nto her from behind. It seemed all made for her--the evening so sweet\r\nand vast and perfect. One of her little loose shoes came off as she\r\nhurried, but she did not stop. The single one made her running clumsy,\r\nso she kicked that free too. He must not think she was a little lame\r\ngirl.... He was farther than she thought; she had never come so far\r\nalone in the evening. And yet how clearly she could see him....\r\n\r\n“He must be very tired, for sometimes he was on one side of the road,\r\nand sometimes on the other. He was quite old, and his step unsteady,\r\nyet he carried his cane and did not use it.... His head was uncovered.\r\nNow she knew why his steps were so unsteady. He was looking upward as\r\nhe walked--upward and around quite joyously, the glow of the sky upon\r\nhis white beard and hair--so that he did not see her coming, and her\r\nbare feet were silent on the road.\r\n\r\n“She felt very little as she touched his cane.\r\n\r\n“‘Won’t you come to our house to rest? Oh, please----’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, yes,’ he answered, but did not look down.\r\n\r\n“‘Our house is near--won’t you come?’ she asked again, and turning, she\r\nwas surprised how far it was, but not afraid, and no one called to her.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, yes,’ he answered.\r\n\r\n“‘But I am down here----’\r\n\r\n“‘Bless me--are you?’\r\n\r\n“He did not seem to see her very well, but tried to follow her voice,\r\nhis eyes looking past her, and to the side, his great hands groping\r\nfor her gently. Olga spoke again and touched his hands. Then he really\r\nsaw her, and she sighed with relief, because his eyes filled with the\r\ngentlest love she had ever seen--seemed to rest upon her and enclose\r\nher at the same time. The gladdest smile of welcome had come to his\r\nface. Both her hands were in his groping ones, but now she turned and\r\nled him. There was silence as they walked, and Olga asked:\r\n\r\n“‘But what were you looking for--you were looking up, you know?’\r\n\r\n“‘Was I, dear?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, and what were you looking for?’\r\n\r\n“‘I was looking for my mother,’ he said.\r\n\r\n“Olga thought how old she must be, and she wanted to cry.... _Her_\r\nmother made the stranger very welcome, and her father stood back\r\nagainst the wall smiling in a way that she always remembered, and\r\nwithout lighting his pipe until after the stranger had finished his\r\nmeal. There was golden butter and the dark bread that is the life of\r\nthe peasants, a pitcher of fresh milk and a bite of that cheese which\r\nis brought forth only on Sundays or holidays. They pressed him to eat\r\nmore, saying that he must be in need of food after his journey, but it\r\nwas very little that he really took. He smiled and looked with peace\r\nfrom face to face, but Olga had pulled her stool back into the shadows,\r\nfor she did not wish to intrude. He had not seen so much of the others.\r\n\r\n“A chair was brought to the hearth, for it was now dark and there was a\r\nlittle fire burning against the damp coolness of evening. They waited\r\nin vain for him to speak. It was as if he had come home. To Olga he was\r\nintensely memorable sitting there in the firelight. The others would\r\ndraw near, and he leaned forward and looked into their faces smilingly,\r\nbut it was not the same.... Now he was looking and looking around the\r\nroom. He found her, and held out his hands. She heard her mother say,\r\n‘This is Olga’s guest.’\r\n\r\n“She had not believed his old arms could be so strong. With one hand he\r\nheld her, while the other patted her shoulder softly, slowly,--as if\r\nhe had everything he desired. All about her was the firelight and the\r\nstrange joyous whiteness of him--his throat and collar and beard all\r\nlustrous white. In his arms there was something she had never known,\r\neven from her mother--a deep and limitless joy, as if the world were\r\nall good, and nothing could possibly happen that would not be the right\r\ngood thing.\r\n\r\n“Then she became afraid her breast would burst, for the happiness was\r\nmore and more. It had to do with the future, such a far distance of\r\nseeing, all rising and increasingly good--until Olga had to slip down\r\nfrom his knees, because the happiness in and through her was more than\r\nshe could bear.\r\n\r\n“‘I will come back,’ she said hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Outdoors she waited until the stars had steadied and were like the\r\nstars she knew, for they had been huge and blazing at first; then she\r\nreturned and he stretched out his hands to her, and she heard her\r\nmother say, ‘Surely, this is Olga’s guest.’\r\n\r\n“She did not remember how she got into her little bed. She heard the\r\nbirds in the vines, and it was golden day when she awoke. Suddenly she\r\nknew that she had slept too long, that she would find him gone.... She\r\nthought of her little brown shoes on the road, but some one must have\r\nbrought them in, for there they were by the bed.... He was no longer in\r\nthe house, but she did not weep. There had been so much of wonder and\r\nbeauty. She looked into her mother’s face, but did not ask. The mother\r\nsmiled, as if waiting for her to speak. The other children must have\r\nbeen told, for they did not speak.\r\n\r\n“A thousand times Olga wished that she had awakened in time; often it\r\ncame to her that she had not done all she could for her guest, but\r\nthere was never real misery about it, and she was never quite the same\r\nafter that perfect night. She thought it out bit by bit every day, but\r\nit was long, long afterward before she spoke, and this was to an elder\r\nsister, who--it was most strange and pitiful to Olga--seemed to have\r\nforgotten it all----”\r\n\r\nThe Faraway Woman reached for the child, and held it close and\r\nstrangely. Fleury offered her water, but she took just a sup and bade\r\nthem finish the cup. “That was the happy part,” she added in a whisper,\r\nher back moving slowly to and fro, as she held the child high. “It\r\nmight all have been happier, but Olga was not quite like the others.\r\nThey did not tell her what they knew, and Olga never could tell them\r\nwhat she felt. Another time--some happy time--I will tell you, who are\r\nso good--you will understand the rest of the story----”\r\n\r\n“Would you tell us if Olga’s guest came again?” the preacher asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he came again,” she said softly.\r\n\r\nBellair sat still for several moments. Then he leaned forward and\r\ntouched the child’s dress.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   8\r\n\r\nThey made an appearance of drinking (with a cracker in hand) at\r\nmidnight, but it was for the sake of the woman--a sup of tepid water.\r\nThe long night sailed by. Slowly the moon sank--that dry moon,\r\nbrick-red and bulbous, as it entered the western sea. All was still in\r\nthe little boat. Bellair was ready to meet his suffering. He could not\r\nsleep--because the woman was near. That was the night that her quality\r\nfixed itself for all time exemplary in his heart.\r\n\r\nThe little story had revealed to him a new sanctuary. He loved it and\r\nthe little Gleam; as for that, he loved Fleury, too. It was a strange\r\nresolving of all separateness that had come to him from these friends.\r\nMore than ever thrilling it had come, with Stackhouse out of the boat\r\nand since the story had been made his.\r\n\r\nShe had been frightened by his loss of consciousness at the end of the\r\nbattle. He had awakened looking into her eyes. He scarcely dared to\r\nrecall what she had said in her anxiety, but it was an extraordinary\r\nmatter of value. What a mother she was; and what a little girl lived\r\nin that story, and now!... That little girl was still in her heart.\r\nThe recent days in the open boat had not spoiled her; nor the recent\r\nyears of loneliness and tragedy. Out of it all had come certain perfect\r\nworks--the babe in her arms, her own fortitude and fearlessness of\r\ndeath; the little girl still in her eyes and heart. Bellair saw that a\r\nman loves the child in a woman, quite as much as a woman loves the boy\r\nin a man.... She had said that Fleury and he were brothers and heroes.\r\nHe knew better in his own case. Still she had said it, adding that the\r\ndiscovery of such men to her was a part of the very bloom of life....\r\n\r\nBellair was not thinking the personal relation now. Fleury and she\r\nwere mated in his own thoughts. From the beginning, this was so; and\r\nyet he did not ask more. He had come to believe from their glorious\r\nhumanity (so strange to him and unpromising in the beginning)--that the\r\nworld was crowded with latent values which, once touched and quickened\r\ninto life, would make it a paradise.\r\n\r\nThat was the substance of the whole matter. He must never forget it.\r\nThe human values which he had met in these were secret in thousands,\r\nperhaps in millions, of hearts, and needed only breaking open by stress\r\nand revelation--to bring the millennium to old Mother Earth, and open\r\nher skies for the plan of joy. Bellair impressed this upon his mind\r\nagain, so he would not forget--then fell asleep.\r\n\r\nShe was first awake in the distance-clearing light. She arose\r\ncarefully, so as not to awaken the men and the child, and stared long\r\nin every quarter. There was no ship, no land, no cloud; and yet a trace\r\nof happiness on her thin face, as she sat down. Fleury was rousing. She\r\nhad expected that; for through their strange sympathy several times\r\nbefore he had awakened with her, or soon after. She bent forward and\r\nwhispered a good-morning, and added:\r\n\r\n“It is gone----”\r\n\r\n“Surely?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Thank God.”\r\n\r\nThe preacher breathed deeply, contemplated their faces one after\r\nanother. From Bellair lying in the stern, his eyes turned significantly\r\nto the woman’s, and his own lit with zeal.... Bellair was on the\r\nborderland then, coming up through the fathoms of dream. Already he\r\nfelt the heat; the sun had imparted its ache to his eyes. The three\r\nwere half-blinded by the long brilliance of the cloudless days on the\r\nsea.... Bellair was trying to speak, but could not because of the parch\r\nin his throat. Moreover, no thoughts could hold him--not even Bessie.\r\nShe came to mind, pink and ineffectual, lost in her childish things.\r\nShe had failed this way before....\r\n\r\nThere was a cup to his lips. He smelled the water, and wanted it as he\r\nwanted decency and truth--as he wanted to be brave and fit to be one of\r\nthe three. It almost crazed him, the way he wanted it--but it would be\r\ntaking it from her. All the violence of one-pointed will was against\r\nthe cup. He pushed it away.\r\n\r\n“Don’t, Bellair,” said Fleury. “You’ll spill it. Drink----”\r\n\r\n“I won’t. Take it away.”\r\n\r\n“You must drink. It is yours.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he must drink,” said the woman.\r\n\r\nBellair sat up. Fleury was holding the cup to his lips.\r\n\r\n“It is gone from behind,” said the preacher. “Drink your water. I\r\nhave. I will speak to you after you drink.”\r\n\r\nHe stared at them, and at the open sea behind her. Then it came to him,\r\nas if from Fleury’s mind, to obey.... Fleury then served the woman.\r\nThey ate a cracker together; at least it seemed so. Then Fleury spoke:\r\n\r\n“We have the child to serve--that is our first thought; therefore we\r\nmust think of the child’s mother first. As for her other part, as our\r\ncompanion, she will be one with us, of course. We have been here five\r\nfull days, and we have not been allowed, by the presence of him who\r\nis gone--and may God rest and keep that--we have not been allowed to\r\ndo the best we could in this great privilege of being together and\r\ndrawing close to reality. Many have gone without food and drink for ten\r\ndays--to come close to God. There is food here and water--to keep us in\r\nlife. This is what I would say: We must change our point of view.”\r\n\r\nHe paused, and their eyes turned from one to another. The child’s face\r\nseemed washed in the magic of morning. The preacher added:\r\n\r\n“We must cease to regard ourselves as suffering, as creatures in want,\r\nas starving or dying of thirst. Rather, as three souls knit, each to\r\nthe other, who have entered upon a pilgrimage together--a period of\r\nsimple austerity to cleanse and purify our bodies the better to meet\r\nand sense reality, and to approach with a finer sensitiveness, than\r\nwe have ever known--the mystery and ministry of God.... So we are not\r\nsuffering, Bellair. We are not suffering--”\r\n\r\nHe turned to the woman.\r\n\r\n“We are chosen ones. This is our wilderness. When we are ready--God\r\nwill speak to us. We are very far from the poor needs of the body--for\r\nthis is the time and period of our consecration. God bless you\r\nboth--and the Gleam.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   9\r\n\r\nIt was the seventh evening, the cool coming in. Bellair could not feel\r\nhis body below his lungs, unless he stopped to think. The child was\r\non his knee, his hands holding it. The little face was browned, but\r\nvery clear and bright. Bellair’s hands against the child’s dress were\r\nclawlike to his own eyes, like the hands of a black man very aged. He\r\ncould move his fingers when he thought of it, but he did not know if\r\nthey moved unless he watched. The effort of steadying the child he did\r\nnot feel in his arms, but in his shoulders. It was like the ache in his\r\neyes. No tears would come, but all the smart of tears’ beginnings; and\r\nthe least little thing would bring it about. He had to stop between\r\nwords and wait for his throat to subside--in the simplest saying.\r\n\r\nHe saw everything clearly. The open boat was like a seat lifted a\r\ntrifle above the runways of the world. He could see them, as one in the\r\nswarming paths beneath could never hope to see. It was all good, but\r\nthe pain and the pressure of them all!... Bessie Brealt in pain and\r\npressure; Davy Acton in the hard heavy air; Broadwell who was trying\r\nto be a man at Lot & Company’s; the old boarding-house woman who had\r\nforgotten everything but her rooms--her rooms moving with shadows whom\r\nshe never saw clearly and never hoped to understand--shadows that\r\nflitted, her accounts never in order, her rooms never in order....\r\nThere had been people in there whom he never saw--one girlish voice\r\nthat awakened in the afternoon and sang softly, a most subdued and\r\nimpossible singing. She worked nights at a telephone switch-board--the\r\nnight-desires of the great city passing through her--and she sang\r\nto the light of noon when it came to the cage.... Sunday afternoons\r\nwhen it was fine, a bearded man emerged from a back-room, emerged\r\nwith a cane and cigarette case. Always on the front steps he lit the\r\ncigarette....\r\n\r\nBellair now couldn’t smoke.... Once there had been moaning in a lower\r\nback room, moaning night and morning from a woman. He was not sure if\r\nit were the millinery woman, or the one who worked in Kratz’s. The\r\nmoaning stopped and as he passed through the hall, he heard a doctor\r\nsay to the landlady:\r\n\r\n“King Alcohol.”\r\n\r\nJust that.... He saw the millinery woman afterward, so it wasn’t\r\nshe.... The air in the old halls was of a character all its own. It\r\nwas stronger than the emanations from any of the rooms. The separate\r\ncurrents lost their identity like streams in the ocean, like souls\r\nin Brahma.... How strangely apart he had kept all that five years! A\r\nface not seen before in the halls, and he did not know if it were a\r\nnewcomer or old. So few came to the board to dine--the chorus-woman\r\nfrom the Hippodrome, who came up nightly from the water.... He saw\r\nthe view from his window--over the roofs and areas. It was a wall of\r\nwindows--dwellers in the canyon sides; boxes of food hanging out,\r\nclothing out to freshen itself in the dingy and sluggish airs--the\r\ncoloured stockings and the faces that looked out. Everything was\r\nmonotonous but the faces--faces grim and sharp--faces of kittens and\r\nbulls and rabbits and foxes, faces of ferrets, sleek faces, torn faces,\r\nred and brutal, white and wasted faces; faces of food and drink, faces\r\nof hunger and fear; the drugged look; few tears but much dry yearning,\r\nand not a face of joy.\r\n\r\nThere was no joyousness and peace in the lower runways, but pain and\r\nheavy pressures.... Bellair saw himself moving among those halls again,\r\nnot a stranger, but with a hand, a smile, a dollar. No one would moan\r\nfor days without his knowing. He would find day-work for the little\r\ntelephone miss, and send orders for hats to the milliner. He would\r\nawaken that shadow of all the shadows, the landlady, with kindness and\r\nhealing. He would call across the windowed cavern.... They would say,\r\n“Come over and help us,” and he would rush down stairs, and around\r\ninto other streets, and faces there would be ready to show him. He\r\nsaw it all clearly, such as it was, but no facts. They would not call\r\nto him. They would not be healed. They would take a dollar, but say\r\nhe was cracked. He could move about passing forth a dollar here and\r\nthere--that was all. They would welcome him at Lot & Company’s if he\r\npassed it out quietly enough. The dollar would go into the Sproxley\r\nsystem and emerge unbroken to the firm itself, there to be had and held\r\nand marked down in the house of Lot--Jabez, Nathan, Eben, Seth, each\r\na part, the jovial Mr. Rawter a small but visible part--one hundred\r\nSproxley-measured cents.... Davy Acton wouldn’t get one, nor Broadwell,\r\nnor the girls upstairs. The firm would not encourage him passing beyond\r\nthe cage of Mr. Sproxley.... There were many who wanted food and drink\r\nand hats--hats----”\r\n\r\nHe was with Bessie Brealt now ... that night and the kiss. It was\r\nanother life.... He went back to those who needed food--New York so\r\nfull of food. Then he felt the heavy wallet against his breast--one\r\npaper in there would fill the open boat with food....\r\n\r\n“My God,” he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe didn’t try to explain.... Sometimes he fell into a little dream as\r\nhe sat. Once he was drinking at the narrow throat of a green bottle,--a\r\nmagic bottle whose base was in the sea, and the trickle that passed\r\nthrough was freshened drop by drop. But it was a trick like all else\r\nin the world and the drops passed with agonising slowness. He came to,\r\nsucking hard upon his brass key, his mouth ulcered from it.... There\r\nwere times in the long days that he hungered for the stars almost\r\nas for drink; times in the night when the stars bored him like some\r\nman-pageantry that he had seen too much of; times when the thought\r\nof God was less than the thought of water; and times when the faith\r\nand the glory of the spirit of the world made thirst a thing to laugh\r\nat, and death whimsical and insignificant.... Sometimes in the night,\r\nhe fancied the woman was Bessie Brealt. It would come like a little\r\nsuspicion first hardly stirring his faculties; finally it would be\r\nreal--that the singing girl was there, all but her song. He would sit\r\nup rubbing his eyes in rebellion. Once he had spoken to be sure.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is I,” she said huskily, and the voice was not Bessie\r\nBrealt’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  10\r\n\r\nThey did not speak of ships. Through the wakeful night hours they\r\nwatched for the lights of ships, but they did not speak of vigils.\r\nTheir eyes were straining for uncharted shores during the days,\r\nbut they did not speak of land; nor of rain, though they watched\r\npassionately the change and movement of wind and cloud.\r\n\r\nIt is true that they suffered less in the days that followed the\r\npassing of Stackhouse. The underworld was gone from the seat in the\r\nstern; sunlight and sea air had cleansed it from the boat. They were\r\nweaker, but pangs of thirst were weaker, too. Small pieces of metal\r\nin their mouths kept the saliva trickling. The real difference was an\r\nexaltation which even Bellair shared at times, and which had come to\r\nthem the fifth morning with Fleury’s talk, and with refining intensity\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nThe child was well; his imperative founts still flowing. She was pure\r\nmother; it was the child that was nourished first, not her own body.\r\nShe was first in the passion for his preservation. Indeed, she would\r\nhave told them at once had any change threatened him. But she was the\r\nsoul of the fasting too; the austerity of it found deep sanction within\r\nher; and there were moments in which she bewildered Bellair, for she\r\nbecame bright with the vitality which is above the need of bread.\r\n\r\nFleury talked of God, as Stackhouse had talked of death. Indeed, there\r\nwas a contrasting intoxication in the days and nights of the preacher,\r\nbut one without hideous reaction.\r\n\r\n“There comes a moment,” he said, “when I am alone--when you two are\r\nasleep--that I feel the weakness. I drink and eat--perhaps more than my\r\nshare. But when we are all together--sitting here as now, talking and\r\nsustaining one another--oh, it seems I was never so happy.”\r\n\r\nBellair suspected that this talk of lapses into abandonment while\r\nothers slept was an effort to make their minds easy on the subject of\r\nhis share. Both the Mother and Bellair doubted this; it preyed upon\r\nthem. In the main they were one solution, each separate quality of\r\ntheir individualism cast into a common pool for the sustaining of a\r\ntrinity.\r\n\r\n“It changes the whole order,” Fleury declared. “Why, whole crowds have\r\ndied of hunger--in half the number of days that holy men and women have\r\nfasted as a mere incident of their practice toward self-mastery. This\r\nis our consecration.”\r\n\r\nBellair found it true. He had ceased to marvel at himself. Deep\r\nreconstruction was advanced within him; and a strange loyalty\r\nand endurance prospered from the new foundations. If this were\r\nself-hypnosis--very well; if madness--very well, too; at least, it\r\nwas good to possess, seven, eight, nine days in an open boat, on a\r\none-fifth ration of water and food. To Bellair, who felt himself\r\ninferior to the others, it appeared that they already lived what he was\r\nthrillingly thinking out. He remembered his first thoughts of them--in\r\nthe cold worldly manner of a fellow-traveller. It was almost as far as\r\na man’s emotion can swing, from what he thought of them now. Before\r\nGod, he believed he was right now, and wrong then. Certainly he would\r\ntest it out, if he lived to move among men again.\r\n\r\nHe thought often about the child’s voice--at the moment that the heart\r\nof Stackhouse broke--as the point of his turning and salvation. This\r\nfurnished a clue to many things, though he did not miss the fact that\r\nthe world would smile at his credulity in accepting such a dispensation\r\nas real. The world would say that he had been driven to far distances\r\nof illusion by thirst and hunger; in fact, that anything which he had\r\nseen, other than the original entity in the eyes of Stackhouse, was a\r\npart of the illusion. Bellair considered this, and also that in every\r\ninstance of late in which he had held the world’s point of view he\r\nhad been proven wrong. He granted the world its rights to think as it\r\nchose, but accepted the dispensation.\r\n\r\nThere had been good and evil within him. The balance had turned in\r\nfavour of the good, with that cry. It had turned from the self. The\r\npurpose of the Enterer had been to keep him _in_ the self. It had come\r\nfrom the unfathomed depths of evil--that purpose and the devil which\r\nhe saw. Bellair had heard repeatedly that some such _dweller_ appeared\r\nto each man who makes an abrupt turn from the life of flesh to the\r\nlife of the spirit. Each of the three had seen something foreign in\r\nthe eyes of Stackhouse. It is true they had not talked of it; possibly\r\nto each it was different in its deadliness; perhaps theirs was not the\r\ndemon _he_ saw, since Fleury and the woman were much farther on the way\r\nthan he, but they had been good enough to share responsibility for the\r\nvisitation. Indeed, the Faraway Woman could not have been acting, since\r\na cry came from her the instant _it_ appeared.\r\n\r\nThis he loved to study: that his thought of the child had balanced the\r\nwhole issue against the intruder; that something within him had brought\r\nthat saving grace of selflessness out of chaos. It was a squeak, he\r\ninvariably added, but it had shown him enough, opening the way. There\r\nmust be such a beginning in every man; in fact, there must come an\r\ninstant of choice; an instant in which a man consciously chooses his\r\npath, weighing all that is past against the hope and intellectual\r\nconception of a better life.\r\n\r\nBellair brooded upon this a great deal, especially on the ninth day,\r\nand that was the day, Fleury talked--the holiest of their days in the\r\nopen boat. Bellair found many things clearer afterwards. As soon as he\r\nunderstood fully, he meant to close it all, so far as his own relation\r\nwas concerned. In its very nature it must be given to others, must be\r\nturned to helpfulness. It was a sort of star-dust which did not adhere\r\nto self, but sought places of innocence to shine from, and used every\r\npure instrument for its dissemination. The key to the whole matter was\r\nthe loss of the sense of self. Having accepted this, Bellair knew that\r\nhe must go up into Nineveh, so to speak. He trembled.\r\n\r\n“We learn by austerities apart,” Fleury said, “and then we return\r\nto men with the story. We are called up the mountain to witness the\r\ntransfiguration, and then are sent with the picture down among men. Oh,\r\nno, we are not permitted to remain, nor build a temple up there. First\r\nwe receive; then we must give. We must lose the sense of self in order\r\nto receive; and having received, we do not want the sense of self.\r\nThis is the right and left hand of prayer--pure selfless receptivity,\r\nthen tireless giving to others. It is the key to the whole scheme of\r\nlife--mountain and valley, ebb and flow, night and day, winter and\r\nsummer, the movement of the lungs and the heart and the soul. We cannot\r\nreceive while our senses are hot with desire; therefore we must become\r\ndelicate and sensitive. Having received, we must make the gift alive\r\nthrough action. Dreaming is splendid; the dreamer receives. The dreamer\r\nstarts all things; but the dreamer becomes a hopeless ineffectual if\r\nhe does not make his dreams come true in matter. That is it. We are\r\nhere to make matter follow the dream. That’s why the spirit puts on\r\nflesh--that’s why we are workmen. Action is the right hand of thought.”\r\n\r\nThe preacher was ahead of him in these thoughts. So often he said just\r\nwhat Bellair needed, the exact, clearing, helpful thing. For instance,\r\nBellair had followed his own fascinating conviction that the world\r\nis full of secret values; that the world is ready to pull together,\r\nonly it requires a certain stimulus from without--some certain message\r\nthat would reach and unify all. Fleury tightened the matter by his\r\nexpression of it:\r\n\r\n“The socialists are doing great good. The church is still doing good;\r\nthe societies that have turned to the East have heard the great\r\nmessage; even in commerce there is a new life; everywhere in the world,\r\nthe sense of having found _some new spirit_ which works to destroy\r\nthe sense of self. If one great figure should come now--come saying,\r\n‘You are all good. You are all after the same thing. One way is as\r\ngood as another--only come.’... What we need is for some one to touch\r\nthe chord for us--to give us the key, as to an orchestra of different\r\ninstruments. We are all making different notes; and yet are ready for\r\nthe harmony--some of us intensely eager for the harmony. The great need\r\nis for a Unifier.... It seems that we, here in the small boat, can see\r\nAmerica so much clearer, than when we were there----”\r\n\r\nBellair had felt this a thousand times.\r\n\r\n“The greatest story in the world is the story of the coming of a\r\nMessiah--the one who may chord for us. I think He will come. He will\r\ncome out of the East, his face like the morning sun turned to the West.\r\nDon’t you see--we are all like atoms of steel in a chaos? You know what\r\nhappens when a voltage of electricity is turned upon a bar of steel?\r\nOrder comes to the chaos; the atoms sing, all turned the same way. That\r\nVoice must come--that tremendous voltage of spiritual electricity--that\r\nwill set us all in harmony--all with our tails down stream.”\r\n\r\nAnd Fleury finished it all by pointing out what had happened to them\r\nin the small boat. They had lost separateness; they were each for the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n“That’s what must happen in America, in the world,--the pull of\r\neach for the whole--the harmony. You have seen an audience in the\r\nmidst of great message or great music--they weep together. They cry\r\nout together. They are all one. That’s the story. That is what must\r\nhappen. It will happen when the Unifier comes. It is the base of\r\nall gospel--that we are all one in spirit. Don’t you see it--every\r\nmessage from the beginning of time has told it? All one--all one--our\r\nseparateness is our suffering, our evil. To return to the House of Our\r\nFather--that is the end of estrangement.”\r\n\r\n... And Fleury was the one who had ceased to talk. But he had acted,\r\ntoo.... They saw that he was held by some power of his giving to them.\r\nHe was like light. He had given the whole material force of his body to\r\nhold off that destruction which had come with the dying of Stackhouse.\r\nHe had not eaten, even as they had eaten. They feared for him, because\r\nhe was the centre and mainspring of their pilgrimage. Especially this\r\nhaunt became more grippable in the heart of the ninth night.... There\r\nwas a small tin of water left, less than three pints, very far from\r\nclean; and somewhat less than a pound of crackers. Bellair awoke to\r\nfind Fleury gone from his place between him and the woman. He was in\r\nthe stern, in the old seat of Stackhouse, praying. ... Fleury met the\r\ntenth day with an exaltation that awed Bellair and the woman; and there\r\ncame from it a fear to Bellair’s heart that had nothing to do with\r\nself, nor with the Mother, nor the Gleam.\r\n\r\nThey were all weak, and two men utterly weak. Through their will and\r\ndenial, and the extraordinary force and health of her own nature, the\r\nchild had not yet been dangerously denied. It had become a sort of\r\nnatural religion with the three--a readiness to die for the Gleam.\r\n\r\n“This is our last day,” said Fleury, before the western horizon was\r\nmarked clear.... The Faraway Woman told them another story of what the\r\nwise old shepherd dog told the puppies--that it was better to begin on\r\ncrackers and water--and end on cookies and cream....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  11\r\n\r\nBellair believed about this being the last day. The authority was quite\r\nenough, but there was still something akin to eternity in the possible\r\nspace of another daylight and distance. The announcement did not bring\r\nhim an unmixed gladness, for the mysterious fear of the night haunted\r\nhim--the thing that had come to him under the full and amazing moon\r\nwhile Fleury prayed.... Day revealed no sign. They sat speechless and\r\nbowed under the smiting noon--the little boat in the wide, green deep\r\nunder a fleckless, windless sky, proud of its pure part in infinite\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nThat was the day the child moaned, as significantly for the ears of\r\nmen, as for the mother. He was a waif to look at--the little heart at\r\ntimes like one of them in stoicism--then nestling to the mother-breast\r\nand the turning away in astonishment and pain. The Mother’s eyes were\r\nharrowing.\r\n\r\n“This is our last day,” Fleury repeated.\r\n\r\n“I believe you,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Then drink and eat----”\r\n\r\n“I did--it is--it is--oh, I did!”\r\n\r\n“Land or rain or a ship, I do not know--but this is the last day----”\r\n\r\nBellair regarded him, between his own wordless vapourings of\r\nconsciousness. The preacher was like a guest, not of earth\r\naltogether--like one who would come in the evening.... Yes, that was\r\nit. He was like the old man who came to Olga, only young and beautiful.\r\nIt did not occur to Bellair now that he was regarding his friend with\r\na quality of vision that a well-fed man never knows.... That which he\r\nhad fancied placid and boyish was knit and masterful. The cheeks and\r\ntemples were hollowed, but the eyes were bright. There is a brightness\r\nof hunger, of fever, of certain drugs, but these were as different as\r\nseparate colours--and had not to do with this man’s eyes. Nothing that\r\nBellair knew but starlight could be likened--and not all starlight.\r\nThere was one star that rose late and climbed high above and a little\r\ntoward the north--solitary, remote, not yellow nor red nor green nor\r\nwhite, as we know it--yet of that whiteness which is the source of all.\r\nBellair had forgotten the name, but Fleury’s eyes made him think of it.\r\n\r\n... The woman’s head was lying back. Something that Bellair had noted\r\na hundred times, without bringing it actually into his mind’s front,\r\nnow appeared with all the energy of a realisation. Her throat was\r\nalmost too beautiful. The diverging lines under the ear, one stretching\r\ndown to the shoulder, the other curving forward around the chin, were\r\nshadowed a little deeper from her body’s wasting, but the beauty was\r\ndeeper than flesh, the structure itself classic. It was the same as\r\nwhen he had noted her finger-nails. Beauty had brought him a kind of\r\nexcitement, and something of hostility--as if he had been hurt terribly\r\nby it long ago. But this was different; these details had come one\r\nby one, as he was ready. Her integrity had entered his heart before\r\neach outer symbol. He had not seen her at all at first; recalled the\r\nqueer sense of hesitation in raising his eyes across the table in the\r\ncabin of the _Jade_. He had studied her face in the open boat, but\r\nsomething seemed to blur his eyes when she turned to him to speak. Two\r\nare required for a real understanding. As yet they had not really met,\r\nnot yet turned to each other in that searching silence which fathoms.\r\nBut the details were dawning upon him. Perhaps that was the way of the\r\nFaraway Woman--to dawn upon one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe day was ending--their shadows long upon the water. Fleury raised\r\nhis hand as he said:\r\n\r\n“It is surer to me than anything in the world----”\r\n\r\n“What, Fleury?” Bellair asked, though there was but one theme of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n“That this is our last day in the open boat.”\r\n\r\nBellair did not answer. His own voice had a hideous sound to him and\r\nbetrayed his misery.\r\n\r\n“It was the _too-great light_--that I saw,” the preacher added huskily.\r\n“It began last night as I prayed. I saw that this was the last day for\r\nus--but more----”\r\n\r\n“I saw something about you as you prayed,” the woman said.\r\n\r\nFleury surprised them now, taking a sup of water. They saw that he had\r\nsomething to say about God and the soul of man--that was the romance he\r\nworshipped. They listened with awe. In Bellair’s heart, at least, there\r\nwas a conviction that tightened continually--that they were not long to\r\nhear the words of the preacher.\r\n\r\n“... For two years I have been in the dark and could not pray. Before\r\nthat I prayed with the thought of self, which is not prayer. I could\r\nnot stay as a church leader without praying. I said I would pray when\r\nI could pray purely for them. I told them, too, that I could not look\r\nback in service and adoration to the Saviour of another people who\r\nlived two thousand years ago. They called me a devil and a blasphemer.\r\nFor two years, I have tried to serve instead of to pray, but no one\r\nwould listen, no one would have me. They said I was insane, and at\r\ntimes I believed it. At last, it came to me that I must go away--to\r\nthe farthest part of the world----”\r\n\r\nHe turned yearningly to the woman.\r\n\r\n“And then you came with your strength and faith.”\r\n\r\nNow to Bellair:\r\n\r\n“And you came with the world in your thoughts, and I made the third.\r\nWe went down into the wilderness together--with that other of the\r\nunderworld. _It was a cosmos._ It has shown me all I can bear. Last\r\nnight, it came to me that I _could_ pray for you. It came simply,\r\nbecause I loved you enough----”\r\n\r\nHis face moved from one to the other, his hand fumbling the dress of\r\nthe child beside him.\r\n\r\n“It was very clear. As soon as I loved you enough, I could pray for\r\nyou, without thought of self. It was the loss of the self that made it\r\nall so wonderful. And as I prayed, the light came, and the Saviour I\r\nhad lost, was in the light. And the light was Ahead; and this message\r\nfrom Him, came to my soul:\r\n\r\n“_I am here for those who look ahead; and for those who turn back\r\ntwo thousand years, I am there. Those who love one another find me\r\nswiftly._”\r\n\r\nBellair scarcely heard him. Fleury’s eyes were light itself. The man’s\r\ninner flame had broken through. Something incandescent was within him;\r\nsomething within touched by the “glittering plane.” But it did not\r\nmean future years together. Bellair had wanted that.... Fleury smiled\r\nnow, his eyes lost in the East. He lifted his hand.\r\n\r\n“It always comes from the East,” he said strangely.\r\n\r\nBellair had searched that horizon a few moments ago. He knew exactly\r\nhow the East had looked--a thin luminous grey line on the green,\r\nbrightening to Prussian blue, then to vivid azure. He dared not look\r\nnow, but watched the woman.\r\n\r\nStraining and terror were in her eyes--then sudden light, a miracle of\r\nlight and hope, then her cry.\r\n\r\nBellair seemed to see it in her mind--the smudge upon the\r\nhorizon--before he turned. It was there--a blur on the thin grey line.\r\n\r\nTo lift the oars was like raising logs of oak, but he shipped the pair\r\nat last, listening for the words of the others and watching their\r\nfaces. It seemed simpler than straining his eyes to the East. Fleury\r\ntried to raise the overcoat from the bottom of the boat, but it fell\r\nfrom his hands, and he sank back smiling:\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “They’re coming. They’ll see us soon.”\r\n\r\nTo Bellair it was like seeing a ghost, that smile of Fleury’s. It meant\r\nsomething that in the future would be quite as important to him as the\r\nship’s bearing down to lift them up. He pulled toward the east--felt\r\nthe old fainting come, pulled against that,--to the east, until a\r\nlow, thundering vibration was all about him, like the tramp of death.\r\nPerhaps it was that--the thought flickered up into form out of the deep\r\nblur.... He was drinking water again. This time he did not fight.\r\n\r\n“You may as well have yours, Bellair, man,” Fleury was saying, “and you\r\nneed not row. They’re coming. It’s a ship coming fast. There is light\r\nfor them to see us well--if they do not already----”\r\n\r\n“But you haven’t drunk!”\r\n\r\n“Bless you, I’ll drink now.”\r\n\r\nThe woman handed him the water. The cup was in his hand. He covered\r\nmerely the bottom of the cup, and made much of it as if it were a full\r\nquart.\r\n\r\n“The fact is--I’m not thirsty,” he said pitifully, when he saw their\r\nfaces.\r\n\r\n“You’re all in,” Bellair said in an awed tone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThrough the prolonged ending of that day Bellair watched the steamer\r\nnear, but his thoughts were not held to the beauty of her form, nor\r\nthe pricking out at last of her lights. He stood against the bare pole\r\nin the dusk, and waved and called--his voice little and whimsical. It\r\nseemed to falter and cling within their little radius, then run back\r\nto his ears--a fledgeling effort. But the deep baying of the steamer\r\nanswered at last. Even that could not hold Bellair’s thoughts.... She\r\nwas coming straight toward them now. If it were death and illusion, so\r\nbe it; at least that is what he saw.\r\n\r\n“It would be all right--except for him,” Bellair said to the woman.\r\n\r\n“I tell you all is well,” said Fleury. “Only I ask----”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” they said, when he paused.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let them separate us--when we are on board the ship to-night.\r\nI want to be with you both to-night--we three who have seen so much\r\ntogether--and the little man.”\r\n\r\n... They heard her bells and the slackening of the engines. She was\r\ncoming in softly like an angel, bringing the different life, a return\r\nto earth it was. The woman was weeping. Bellair could not have spoken\r\nwithout tears....\r\n\r\nJust now through the evening purple, he saw _that_ star in the east,\r\noff the point of the steamer’s prow.\r\n\r\n“Fleury,” he said, “tell me--what is that one--that pure one--I have\r\nforgotten?”\r\n\r\nThe preacher’s eyes followed his finger.\r\n\r\n“That is Spika--Spika of the Virgin,” he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  12\r\n\r\nThe engine had stopped. She neared in the deep dusk, a harp of lights,\r\nand with the steady sound of a waterfall.... She was just moving.\r\nThere was a hail from the heights.\r\n\r\n“Hai!” answered Bellair. It was a poor, broken sound.\r\n\r\nNow they felt the strange, different heat of the\r\nsteamer--earth-heat--and a thousand odours registered on their clean\r\nsenses--milk and meat, coal-smoke, and the steam of hot ashes,\r\nperfumes, metal and paint.... A hoarse voice called down:\r\n\r\n“Are any of you sick--infectious?”\r\n\r\n“No--just hunger and thirst--clean as a new berth.”\r\n\r\nIt was Bellair again.\r\n\r\n“Stay off well. We’re putting down a ladder. Watch the green light.”\r\n\r\nThey saw it come down to them--to the very water. Then they were\r\nuplifted. This was the world coming back--but a changed world. A great\r\nkindness had come over all men. Bellair saw the tears in the eyes of\r\nthe people gathered on the deck. He almost expected to see Bessie\r\nBrealt there.... Perhaps the change had come from her singing.... There\r\nwas a choke in the voices of the people gathered around them.\r\n\r\n“Please,” he managed to say, “don’t keep us apart to-night--we three.\r\nPlease let us be together.”\r\n\r\nAnd down the deck-passage he heard the voices of women, and among\r\nthem, the Faraway Woman’s voice, in answer:\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will go with you thankfully--but not for long. My companions\r\nand I must be together very soon. We three--to-night--it is promised\r\nbetween us.”\r\n\r\nThere was no voice from Fleury.\r\n\r\nThe kindness of every one, that was like a poignant distress to\r\nBellair. He dared not speak; in fact, there was danger of him breaking\r\ndown even without words. The eyes about him were searching, in their\r\neagerness to help. An Englishman came forward at intervals and gripped\r\nhis hand; a German spoke to others of the remarkable condition of\r\nthe boat and its three, after ten days; another German moved in and\r\nout helping, without any words, though his eyes lifted Bellair over\r\nseveral pinches of emotion. The American ship-doctor was the best\r\nof all; young, gruff, humorous, quick-handed, doing and saying the\r\nright thing.... They brought him stimulants and sups of water by the\r\nteaspoon. The merest aroma of thin broth in the bottom of a tea-cup\r\nwas lifted to his lips. He was helped to a hot bath; a splendid quiet\r\nfriendliness about it all. Now it occurred to Bellair that they were\r\ntremendously eager to hear his story. He wanted to satisfy them....\r\n\r\n“It was the fifth day--that Stackhouse died,” he was saying, though he\r\nwas mistaken. “Perhaps you’ve heard of him ... owns a lot of ships and\r\nislands down here.... That was the climax for us. He died hard and he\r\nwas a big man--but we did not murder him.... His body did not sink....”\r\n\r\nThere was a boom of running water in the bathroom; the steam rising.\r\nBellair’s voice was ineffectual. The face of the ship-surgeon bent to\r\nhim in the steam, saying:\r\n\r\n“Cut it--there’s plenty of time.... Leave it all to us.... I say, lean\r\nback. You’ve got a bath coming. Guess you’ve never been on a sick-list\r\nbefore. We can wait for the story.”\r\n\r\nBellair did try to lean back. One by one, the sheathes of will power\r\nthat he had integrated in the past ten days relaxed. It was strange to\r\nfeel them go. They had come hard, and they were correspondingly slow\r\nto ease in their grip. He had to be told again and again--to be helped\r\nto rest. It was good to think that a man does not lose such hard-won\r\nstrength more easily than it comes--that one, in fact, has to use the\r\nsame force to relax with. It was all delightful, this friendliness, the\r\nease of his body, and the giving--the giving into human arms of great\r\nkindliness, and the sense of the others being cared for similarly. They\r\nhad fixed a berth for him, when he said:\r\n\r\n“You know we are to be together to-night. It was a compact between\r\nus----”\r\n\r\nThe surgeon was out and in. It occurred to Bellair that he was\r\nattending the other two.... He repeated his wish to the surgeon about\r\njoining the others as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n“They’re all alike,” the latter said. “They’re all thinking about\r\ngetting together again.... Good God, man, you’ve had ten days of steady\r\ncompany. You ought to sleep----”\r\n\r\n“It is a compact between us.... Is he--is he?”\r\n\r\nIt came to Bellair that this man might be able to tell him the truth,\r\nbut the surgeon was now at the door speaking to one of the Germans. He\r\nvanished without turning....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were together later in one of the empty cabins of the German\r\nliner, _Fomalhaut_, bound for Auckland; and only the American doctor\r\ncame and went. The child was asleep in the berth beside Fleury. The two\r\nothers sat near.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary moonlight of the night before, when Bellair had\r\nawakened to find the preacher at prayer, had left the spirit of its\r\nradiance upon Fleury’s face. It was there now--and such a different\r\nface from which his eyes, falsified by New York, had seen at first.\r\nThis was the real Fleury--this lean, dark, white-toothed gamester,\r\nfeatures touched by some immortal glow from that orient moon; whose\r\nsmile and the quality of every word and gesture, had for him a gleam\r\nof inspiration and the nobility of tenderness. The man had risen in\r\nFleury--that was the secret. And this that had risen in Fleury could\r\nnot die.\r\n\r\nBut the flesh was dying. Bellair had known it in the dusk while the\r\nsteamer neared. He knew that the woman understood--from her face which\r\nleaned toward the berth continually, from the suffering in her eyes\r\nand the dilation of sensitive nostrils.... For ten days, as much as he\r\ncould, Fleury had betrayed himself. Custodian of the food and water,\r\nhe had served them well. And that day of the Stackhouse passing--if it\r\nwere not all a hideous dream, as Bellair fancied at times--he had not\r\ngiven a balance of strength that had not returned, to fight off the\r\nwill of the Intruder.\r\n\r\nThe flesh was dying, but this that had risen in Fleury could not die.\r\nTheir other companion had gone down, clothed in hair and filth and the\r\ndesire of a beast, taking the remnant of the man with it.\r\n\r\nThus it had come to Bellair--the vivid contrast of cavern and high\r\nnoon. It was all in the two deaths, the enactment of the second, as yet\r\nunfinished.... New York and all life moved with countless tricks and\r\nlures to make a man lose his way, lose his chance to rise and die with\r\ngrace like this. New York was like one vast Lot & Company.\r\n\r\nFleury’s head was upon the knees of the woman. Bellair had not seen\r\nher take him. For this last hour, the three were as one. There was a\r\ncry from Bellair that the woman heard all her days:\r\n\r\n“Oh, Fleury, do you have to go?”\r\n\r\nSo far as time measures, the silence was long before Fleury answered,\r\nand then only to say:\r\n\r\n“Take my hand, Bellair.”\r\n\r\nHe came up from a deep dream to obey. It had been as if he were out\r\nunder the stars again,--Fleury talking from the shadows near the\r\nwoman--the rest, vastness and starlight.\r\n\r\n“It’s the _too-great_ light, Bellair. It came when I could stand it.\r\nAs soon as I could love you enough I could pray. It is the loss of the\r\nsense of self that made it wonderful. The Light and His voice came from\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n“‘_I am here for those who look ahead, and for those who turn back\r\ntwo thousand years, I am there. Those who love one another find me\r\nswiftly._’... This is dying of happiness.”\r\n\r\nIn the silence, the low lights of the cabin came back for their eyes.\r\nThey heard him say at the last:\r\n\r\n“... I love you both and respect and thank you both. We found our\r\nhappiness in the open boat.... And Bellair, when you go back to New\r\nYork, do not stay too long. It is right for you to go, but do not stay\r\ntoo long.... And dear Bellair--always follow the Gleam.”\r\n\r\nThe Doctor came. It was his step in the passage that roused them. He\r\nbent to the face, then searched the eyes of the woman. She could not\r\nfind his.... Bellair was puzzled. The head was in her lap, yet the\r\npreacher seemed behind them, and still with something to say. They were\r\nnot sure at first that it was the Doctor who asked:\r\n\r\n“Why did you not call me?”\r\n\r\nHe repeated the question.\r\n\r\n“He told us--you would come afterward,” Bellair said in a dazed way.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he wanted it so,” said the woman.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor stared at them. “Are you two going to pull off anything\r\nfurther to-night, or are you going to get the rest you need, and attend\r\nto the nourishment you need?”\r\n\r\n“We’re under orders now, Doctor,” said Bellair....\r\n\r\n“If I should want him in the night--if I should be frightened, you\r\nwould let him come?”\r\n\r\nIt was the Faraway Woman who asked this of the Doctor, her hand\r\ntouching Bellair’s sleeve.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course,” the Doctor answered quickly.\r\n\r\n“We’ve been together in strange things,” Bellair explained. “And now\r\nyou see, our friend is gone.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door was open between their cabins, but Bellair was not called.\r\nOnce he heard the child cry, but it was quickly hushed.... He\r\nthought it must be near morning at last, and went on deck. He was not\r\nsuffering, except from lassitude, deep languor and numbing strangeness\r\nthat Fleury was not near him--that the woman was not sitting in her\r\nplace forward.... It was just after midnight, the moon still high,\r\nthe weather the same. ... He was not seen. Three men were seated\r\nsmoking in the lee of one of the engine-room funnels, the light from\r\nthe dining-saloon on their knees. The Doctor joined them, and said\r\npresently:\r\n\r\n“... It’s a bit deep for me. They’ve been in an open boat ten days. Old\r\nStackhouse, well-known down here, died of thirst the fourth or fifth\r\nday, but these two and the infant have lived through it. The preacher\r\nlooked all right, but seems to have suffered a fatal case of happiness\r\nsince we lifted him aboard. The two knew it was coming apparently, and\r\narranged for me to be absent.... It appears that they made a sort of\r\npilgrimage to Mecca out of thirst and starvation, and got away with\r\nit----”\r\n\r\nBellair withdrew softly.\r\n\r\nIn the long next forenoon when he could not rise, he wished he had gone\r\ninto that open door, when he was on his feet last night. Sometimes\r\nhalf-dreamily he wished he were back in the open boat, because she\r\nwas always there. Something had taken establishment in his character\r\nfrom that ten days. She had never failed--in light or dark, in the\r\ntwilights of dawn and evening, in moon and star and sunlight--always\r\nthere; disclosing leisurely some new aspect of beauty for him. He\r\nunderstood now that one does not begin to see clearly any object until\r\none is attracted to it--that all the cursory _looking at things_ around\r\nthe world will not bring them home to the full comprehension.\r\n\r\n... He could call to her, but it was like telephoning. He had never\r\nliked that, and beside he was not the master of his voice. It would\r\nnot go straight, but lingered in corners, broke pitifully--so that he\r\nknew it frightened her--and the meanings in his mind which he could not\r\nspeak, pressed the tears out of his eyes.... Then there was pain. His\r\nbody astonished him. He had merely been weak and undone last night, but\r\nto-day.... And he knew that she was suffering, not from any sound from\r\nher cabin, but because she did not come. Then _they_ had to feed the\r\nchild. This filled him with a rebellion so sharp that it recalled him\r\nto full faculties for a second. He had to smile at his absurdity.\r\n\r\nThe second day it was the same, but the third Bellair arose; and when\r\nshe heard his step, her call came. It was still early morning. He found\r\nthe child before he looked into her face.\r\n\r\n“I am ashamed to be so weak,” she said. “But to-day--a little later--he\r\nsaid I could rise. We are to be on deck for a half-hour after dinner,\r\nhe told me.”\r\n\r\n“The little Gleam----” said Bellair....\r\n\r\nShe was whiter, more emaciated than when they sighted the\r\n_Fomalhaut_. There had been a crisis that they had not expected in\r\nthe relinquishment of their will-powers.... Yet he saw how perfectly\r\nher face was fashioned.... Her hand came up to him, warm from the\r\nchild, the sleeve falling back to her shoulder--held toward him, palm\r\nupward. As he took it, all strangeness and embarrassment left him, and\r\nhe was something that he had not been for five years, something from\r\nthe Unknowable. But that was not all. He looked into her eyes and met\r\nsomething untellably familiar there.\r\n\r\nA most memorable moment to Bellair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were on deck together in the afternoon, the American doctor\r\nhelping them. They heard sacred music--as he walked between them aft.\r\nThey reached the rail of the promenade overlooking the main-deck.... A\r\nservice was being intoned in German. Passengers and crew were below,\r\nand in the midst--leaded and sewn in canvas, in the cover of a flag----\r\n\r\nThe sound that came from the woman was not to be interpreted. She\r\nturned and left them. Bellair would have followed but he felt a\r\ncourtesy due the Doctor, who had arranged for them not to miss the\r\nceremony. Perhaps he had held the ceremony until they could leave the\r\ncabin. Yet Bellair had already turned away.\r\n\r\n“Good God----” said the American. “You people have got me stopped. I\r\nthought this was a trinity outfit--that we picked up.”\r\n\r\nBellair took his hand. “It was--but our friend left us.”\r\n\r\nThe Doctor glanced at him curiously, and pointed down to the body\r\nalready upon the rail. “I suppose _that_ has nothing to do with him?”\r\nhe remarked.\r\n\r\n“Not now--not to watch,” said Bellair.\r\n\r\n“I’ll understand you sometime,” the other added. “Go to her. You’ll\r\nprobably find her waiting for you forward.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBellair lay in his berth that night, the open door between, and he\r\nthought of that first real look that had passed between them. “I’m not\r\njust right yet from the open boat,” he reflected. “I’m all let down\r\nfrom starvation, a bit wild with dreams and visions, but I saw old joys\r\nthere and old tragedies, and mountains and deserts and--most of all,\r\npartings. I wonder what I’ve got to do with them all? It seemed to me\r\nthat I belonged to some of those partings--as if I had hungered with\r\nher before and belonged to her now--and yet----”\r\n\r\nFleury came into his thoughts. “They were certainly great together. It\r\nseemed to me that I did not belong when they were together; and yet,\r\nthis morning as I looked down at her--well, something of expectancy was\r\nthere----”\r\n\r\nBellair found himself lying almost rigid in the intensity of his hope.\r\nThen his thoughts whirled back to New York--all unfinished. There was\r\nsomething in his heart for Bessie--and something in the wallet for\r\nBessie. That was in the original conception, and he must not fail in\r\nthat; and then he must clean that name, Bellair, from the black mark\r\nLot & Company had traced across it. For a moment he fell to wondering\r\njust how he would go about that. Lot & Company was tight and hard to\r\nmove.... A moment later he was somewhere in an evil and crowded part of\r\nNew York, in the dark, Davy Acton holding him fast by the hand.\r\n\r\n“... something of expectancy.”... Was it in her eyes, or in her lips?\r\nHer whole face came to him now, a picture as clear as life. He had\r\ndwelt upon her eyes before--and that billowy softness of her breast, as\r\nshe lay--he had not thought of that. It was like something one says to\r\nanother of such moment, that only the meaning goes home--the words not\r\nremembered until afterward. And her mouth--it was like a girl’s, like a\r\nmother’s too, so tender and _expectant_. ... That word thrilled him. It\r\nwas the key to it all.\r\n\r\nHe was farther and farther from sleep--listening at last with such\r\nintensity that it seemed she must call.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART FIVE\r\n\r\nTHE STONE HOUSE: I\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nTHE woman awed him quite as much as in the open boat. The turning\r\nof her profile to the sea had for Bellair a significance not to be\r\ninterpreted exactly, but it had to do with firmness and aspiration\r\nand the future. Fleury was in their minds more than in speech. She\r\ncould speak of him steadily, and this during the sensitiveness of\r\nconvalescence which is so close to tears. Perhaps they found their\r\ndeepest joy in the child’s fresh blooming. The ship’s people were an\r\nexcellent company.\r\n\r\nBellair’s mind adjusted slowly, and by a rather intense process, to\r\nthe fact of the Stackhouse wallet. It was all that the great wanderer\r\nhad said. The woman accepted the lifted condition, but it seemed hard\r\nfor her faculties to establish a relation with temporal plenty. Fleury\r\nhad given them each a greater thing. They were one in that--keen and\r\ncomprehensive; indeed their minds attacked with vigour and ardour this\r\none thought: somehow to help in drawing off the brimming sorrows of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt came all at once to Bellair that this was no new conception. He had\r\nheard and read of _helping_ all his life. A touch, queerly electric,\r\nhad come over him as a boy, when a certain old man passed, and some\r\none whispered in the most commonplace way, “His whole thought is for\r\nothers.”... He had read it in many books; especially of late, the note\r\nhad been sounded. It was getting into the press--some days on every\r\npage. All the cultic and social ports, into which he had sailed (like a\r\ndingy whaler, he thought) had spoken of brotherhood, first and last.\r\n\r\nDid a thing like this have to be talked by the few for several thousand\r\nyears before it broke its way into the conception of the many, and\r\nfinally began to draw the materials of action together? It had not been\r\nnew in certain parts of the world two thousand years ago when Jesus\r\nbrought the perfect story of it, and administered it through life and\r\ndeath. Had there been too much speech and too little action since; or\r\ndid all this speech help; the result being slow but cumulative, toward\r\nthe end of the clearly-chiselled thought on the part of the majority\r\nthat would compel the atoms of matter into action, making good all\r\nthoughts and dreams?... He knew men who sat every Sunday listening\r\ncourteously to more or less inspired voices that called upon them to\r\n_Love One Another_; yet these men, during the next six days, moved as\r\nusual about their work of rivalry and burning personal desire. Why was\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nThe answer was in his own breast. He had made a mental conception of\r\nthe good of turning the force of one’s life out to others, but he had\r\nnot lived it; had never thought seriously of living it, until now that\r\nthe results had been shown him, as mortal eyes were never given before\r\nto see. That was it; men required more than words. Would something\r\nhappen to bring to all men at last the transfiguring facts as they had\r\nbeen brought to him in the open boat--squarely, leisurely, one by one?\r\nHe was not different from many men. Given the spectacle of the fruits\r\nof desire and the fruits of compassion side by side, as he had been\r\nforced to regard them--any one would understand.\r\n\r\nThe woman was one of those who had got it all long ago. She had ceased\r\nto speak of it much, but had put it into action. The child was a part\r\nof her action, and his own love for her--that new emotion, deeper than\r\nlife to him. She had mainly ceased to speak.... Action and not speech\r\nhad been the way of Fleury, his main life-theme, his first and last\r\nwords. Formerly Fleury had spoken, and then emerged into the world of\r\naction. It had been tremendous action--for them. These things never\r\ndie.\r\n\r\n“That’s the beauty of them,” he said aloud. “These things never die.”\r\n\r\n“You were thinking of _him_?” the Faraway Woman said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Fomalhaut_ left them at Auckland--insular, high and breezy\r\nbetween its harbours and warm to the heart, from the southern summer.\r\nThey took the train to Hamilton, near where she had lived....\r\n\r\n“It seems so long since I was a part of the life here,” she told him,\r\nas they climbed a hill by the long road--the same upon which Olga’s\r\nGuest had come, “and yet it really isn’t. You can see--how little the\r\nGleam is. He was born here.... There was so much to learn. It has been\r\nlike a quick review of all life. When I think of it--and feel the child\r\nalive, unhurt--oh, do you know what it makes me want to do?”\r\n\r\nBellair was thinking of Fleury. He sensed her emotion, as he shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“It makes me want to work for you.”\r\n\r\nBellair placed her saying to the account of her fine zeal for the\r\ngood of the nearest. He was very far from seeing anything heroic in\r\nhis part of the ten days.... They had paused on the little hill back\r\nof the settlement where she had lived. With all her coming home, she\r\nmet no acquaintance while he was with her. It was as if she had come\r\nto look, not to enter.... But there were two days in which she went\r\nforward alone, and Bellair got a foretaste of what it would mean to be\r\nseparated. It called to him all the strength that he had earned.... The\r\nFaraway Woman came back to Hamilton where he waited--as one who had\r\nhastened. The child was asleep, and they walked out into the streets\r\ntogether....\r\n\r\nThey were alone again as in that first night on board the _Fomalhaut_\r\nwhen Fleury left them.\r\n\r\n“Do you want to stay to make your house near the Hamilton road?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nShe regarded him quietly, her eyes fixed upon his face with an\r\nincommunicable yearning.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to stay in New Zealand?”\r\n\r\nAgain she held him with her eyes, before answering:\r\n\r\n“It may be well for me here, as anywhere. I could not stay in America.”\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting. It was she who broke the silence:\r\n\r\n“_You_ must go away?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You knew that from _him_?”\r\n\r\n“From what he said--yes.”\r\n\r\n“He told me not to stay too long.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he saw it all. Perhaps he saw something that would keep you.”\r\n\r\n“He saw a very great deal.”\r\n\r\nThey had been gone two hours. Her steps quickened, when she thought\r\nof the child.... “Yes, I may as well stay in Auckland,” she said.\r\n“Do you know, I should like to stay by the sea--to be near it, for\r\nremembering----”\r\n\r\nThat seemed to come very close to Bellair’s conviction--that her whole\r\nlife was turned to the saint who had passed.\r\n\r\n“A little house by the sea,” he said, his mind picturing it eagerly to\r\nrelieve the greater matter.\r\n\r\n“Just what I was thinking--a little place out of Auckland on the\r\nbluffs--overlooking Waitemata--where one could see the ships coming\r\nin----”\r\n\r\n“Will you let me help you find it, and arrange your affairs?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be happier for me--if you would.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll go back to Auckland to-night, and start out looking from there.”\r\n\r\nMainly they followed the shore during their days of search; but\r\nsometimes they found woods and little towns. There was no coming to\r\nthe end of her; she put on fresh perfections every day, and there were\r\nmoments in which he was meshed in his own stupidity for not seeing\r\nthe splendour of her at the first moment. He became possessed of a\r\nhealthful wonder about women--how men like himself wait for years for\r\nsome companion-soul, finally believing her to be in the sky, only to\r\nfind that _the nearest_ was waiting all the time. The world is so full\r\nof illusions, and a man’s mind is darkest when it seems most clear.\r\n\r\nThe days were like entering one walled garden after another, always\r\nher spirit vanishing at the far gate. Beside him was a strong frail\r\ncomrade, loving the water and air and sky and wood, as only a natural\r\nwoman can love them--her eyes shining softly, her lips parted and red\r\nas the sleeping child’s. He was struck with the miracle of her mouth’s\r\nfreshness. It was like the mouth of a city-bred woman, a woman who had\r\nforced her way for years through the difficult passages of a man’s\r\nworld, who had met the fighting of the open, and the heavier-line\r\nfighting of solitude.... Here Bellair’s diffidence intervened.\r\nMoreover, it was a mouth that could say unerring things.\r\n\r\n“She is a fine weave,” he would say, after the partings at night.\r\n\r\nShe held through every test. The enthralling advance guard never\r\nfailed--that winged immortal something ahead. Often in some little inn\r\nor in the hotel at Auckland during the nights, he found himself in\r\nrebellion because he could not go to her. Always in the open boat he\r\nhad awakened to find her there, and on the night that Fleury passed,\r\nshe had asked to have him within call--but those times were gone. The\r\nworld had intervened that little bit.... There was one summer day\r\nand a bit of forest to enter, a moment surpassing all. Her arms and\r\nfingers, her eyes and breast were all fused with emotions. She gave him\r\nback his boyhood that afternoon in a solemn wordless ceremony, but all\r\nhis diffidence of boyhood came with it.\r\n\r\nThe woods were full of fairies to her; there were meanings for her eyes\r\nin the drift of the wind over the brown pools. She caught the woodland\r\nwhispers, was a part of sweet, low vibrations of the air.... Her eyes\r\nhad come up to his, fearless and tender; yet for the life of him, he\r\ncould not have been sure that they wanted anything he could give.\r\nFor the first time he marvelled now at the genius of self-protection\r\nwhich women have put on, instinct by instinct, throughout all this age\r\nof man, this age of muscle and brain, in which the driving spirit of\r\nit all has no voice.... There was one branch above her that was like\r\nhawthorn, and full of buds. The little Inverness cape that she wore was\r\ntossed back, and her arms were held up to the branches.... Strangely\r\nthat instant he thought of her story--the coming of The Guest--the\r\nthought she had held all the years, the strange restless beauty of its\r\nideal--the mothering beauty of it that seemed to him now endless in\r\npower. Such a mystery came to him from her arms--as if she were holding\r\nthem up to receive perfection, some great spiritual gift.... It was\r\nstartlingly native to her, this expectancy--the pure receptivity of it,\r\nand the thought of beauty in her mind. A woman could command heaven\r\nwith that gesture, he thought, and call to earth an archangel--if her\r\nideal were pure enough.\r\n\r\nA sudden gust of love came over him for her child. He thought he had\r\nloved it before, but it was startling now, filling him, turning his\r\nsteps back toward the place where it lay....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nAnd all the time that they were searching widely from Auckland for\r\ntheir house, a little Englishwoman, growing old, sat waiting for\r\nthem within an hour’s ride from the city. They found her at last\r\nand her stone cottage, rarely attractive in its neglect; and from\r\nthe door-yard, an Odessian vista of sky and harbour and lifted\r\nshore-line.... They had even passed it before, their eyes turned\r\nfarther afield. Bellair couldn’t ignore the analogy of the nearest\r\nwoman, nor the stories of all the great spiritual quests--how the\r\nfleeces on a man’s doorstep turn golden, if he can only see.\r\n\r\n“I knew some one would come,” the little woman said. She had a mole on\r\nher nose and eyes that twinkled brightly. “In fact, I prayed.”\r\n\r\nBellair smiled and thought of Fleury’s saying--that those who turn back\r\ntwo thousand years would find Him.... She had kept a boarding-house,\r\nand now the work was too much. Besides, the children of a younger\r\nsister back in the home in Essex were calling to her.\r\n\r\n“They need me in England,” she repeated. “And here, I have been unable\r\nto keep up the little house. I am too old now. My young men were so\r\ndear about it, but I was not making them comfortable. One’s heart\r\nturns home at the close----” She thought they did not understand; and\r\nexplained all the meanings carefully--how in age, the temporal needs\r\nare not so keen, and the mind wanders back to the elder places....\r\nBellair stood apart, knowing that the two women could manage better\r\nalone.... The cottage faced the east a little to northward, and had\r\nbeen built of the broken rocks of the bluff and shore, its walls twenty\r\ninches thick and plastered on the stone within. The interior surprised\r\nthem with its size, two bedrooms facing the sea and two behind, beside\r\nthe living room (for dining, too, according to the early design) and\r\nthe kitchen. They took it as it was, furniture and all, and loved the\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\nFor several days she remained with them, helped and explained and\r\namplified--suggesting much paint. Each day for an hour or so, there\r\nwere tears. She had found her going not so easy, and the process was\r\nslow to accustom herself to the long voyage; the sense of detachment\r\ncould not be hurried. She wanted them to see her whole plan of the\r\nplace. Her dream had been to have evergreens cut in patterns and\r\nflower-beds in stars and crescents. Meanwhile with her years had grown\r\nup about her the wildest and most natural garniture of the stone\r\ncottage; vines and shrubs, the pines putting on a sumptuousness of low\r\nfoliage altogether unapproved.\r\n\r\nGradually it was all forgotten but the long voyage, and Bellair could\r\nhelp in making the details of that as simple and desirable as possible.\r\nIn fact, he went with her to the ship....\r\n\r\n“She was dear to us, and we shall miss her always,” the Faraway Woman\r\nsaid that night.... She would never come back. It was a parting, but\r\nthe very lightness of it moved them. They wondered if they had done all\r\nthey could.\r\n\r\n“I’m so glad the means were not at hand for her to paint the\r\nstone-work,” Bellair said firmly.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid she would think we lack interest,” the woman added, as she\r\nglanced at the smoky beams of the ceiling. The years had softened them\r\nperfectly.\r\n\r\n“She wanted them washed the very first thing,” said Bellair, “and\r\nvarnished. If she had stayed much longer we would have been forced to\r\npaint something.”\r\n\r\nIn the days that followed, a softness and summery bloom came\r\ncontinually to the Faraway Woman’s eyes. His heart quickened when\r\nshe turned to him. They moved in and out from the cottage to grounds,\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\n“It’s unreal to me,” she would say. “I wonder if it will ever seem\r\nours? I know it won’t, while you are away. I could live here fifty\r\nyears until I seemed a part of the cottage and grass and trees, and I\r\nwould feel a pilgrim resting----”\r\n\r\n“It is part of you now, and always has been,” he said. “You are at home\r\non high ground and you must have the sea-distance. They belong to you.\r\nI think that is what made you so hard for me to understand.”\r\n\r\n“Was I hard for you?”\r\n\r\n“I was so fresh from the little distances and the short-sight of\r\nthings--from looking down----”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if any one ever was so willing to be seen on his worst side?”\r\nshe asked. “I really believe you know very little about yourself.... He\r\nsaw--the real side.”\r\n\r\n“He saw good everywhere,” said Bellair.\r\n\r\n“... I wonder why I was strange to you at first?” she repeated, after a\r\nmoment. “You were not strange to me.”\r\n\r\n“Not when I spent so much time at the great cane chair?”\r\n\r\n“No. You seemed to be studying. I could see that you didn’t belong\r\nthere. You appeared to be interested in it all--as if he were a part of\r\nthe ship----”\r\n\r\n“And you didn’t seem to belong at all to my eyes,” he told her. “You\r\nbelonged out in the distances of ocean. You came closer and closer\r\nduring the days in the open boat--but here you belong. It seems to me\r\nthat you have come home--and how I wish I could stay, too.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you could stay--but I know that there is unfinished work in New\r\nYork.”\r\n\r\n“I wonder how _he_ knew?” Bellair questioned.\r\n\r\n“He saw very clearly. He was not flesh at all--that last day----”\r\n\r\n“After the night--when he prayed.... You saw him that night?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nHer innate sense of beauty startled him afresh every day. All that he\r\nidealised was an open book to her. Bellair had planned his house in the\r\nNew York room. The greatest houses are planned so, by those who suffer\r\nand are confined. It had not come to him in the form of this stone\r\ncottage by the sea. This was not his dream that had come true here,\r\nalthough in many ways it was fairer than his dream. Very plainly, this\r\nlittle rock-bound eyrie was of her fashioning--the very atoms of it,\r\ndrawing together to conform with the picture in her mind. He loved the\r\nplace better so. Perhaps her thought of a home had been the stronger.\r\n\r\n“It is almost perfect now,” she would say. “The neglect has made\r\nit right. A few roses, some bee-hives, vines and perennials--the\r\nrest is just clearing and cleansing. I could go over all the leaves\r\nand branches with a soapy sponge. The rest is to prune and thin and\r\ncleanse--so the sunlight is not shut from anywhere altogether--so it\r\nall can breathe----”\r\n\r\nHe caught the picture in her mind--foliage cut away for the play of sun\r\nand wind everywhere--the chaste and enduring beauty of leaf and stone\r\nand moving water. And now appeared a bit of her nature quite as real:\r\n\r\n“And then those extra two rooms, I could rent them and give board----”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but you don’t have to.”\r\n\r\n“I have always had much to do. I must have work now.”\r\n\r\nShe had no realisation of property; material poverty was a part of her\r\ntemperament. She was superbly well, and could only remain so by the\r\nexpenditure of ample energy. Bellair saw the Martha soul, the mother of\r\nmen, a breadgiver. He thought of the passion of men for the vine-women,\r\nand of the clinging sons they bear.... He lingered over a ship, and\r\nanother. They toiled together like two peasants in the open, the baby\r\nsitting in the sun, the house ashine within. She would have only the\r\nsimple things. She loved fine textures, but only of the lasting fabrics\r\nin woods and wares. She was content to carry water and trim lamps.\r\nShe loved the stones and the low open fires. Often she turned away\r\nseaward, as he had seen her from the _Jade’s_ rail, and from the bow\r\nseat of the open boat. Once in the garden, he made the child laugh, to\r\nbring back her eyes, and she said:\r\n\r\n“I love it so here, but I don’t want to love it, so that it would hurt\r\nterribly, if it were taken away.”\r\n\r\nThis was but one side. There were other moments, in which Bessie and\r\nNew York and all that he and the Faraway Woman had been, seemed fused\r\ninto a ball of mist whirling away, and they stood together, man and\r\nwoman, touching sanity at last in a world of power and glory. It was\r\nnot then a time for words.... Once their hands went out together, and\r\nholding for a moment, Bellair had the strange sense of the self sinking\r\nfrom him. He could not feel his hand or any part of his being--as if it\r\nwere a part of her, two creatures blent into one, and an indescribable\r\nrush of something different than physical vitality.\r\n\r\nAnd once sitting with her under the lamp in the evening, he drew again\r\nthat sense of peace that had come in the queer darkness on the deck of\r\nthe _Jade_. It had to do with the mountains--as if they had finished\r\nwith the valleys, and were ascending together in the strong light of\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nAnd then there was passion--that plain, straight earth drive. Bellair\r\nwas strange about this with the Faraway Woman. This passion was like\r\nthe return of an old hunting companion, so natural in the wilds, but\r\nstrange and out of place in his newly-ordered life. It had come from\r\nthe Unknowable, and he had supposed it lost in that wilderness. It\r\ndismayed him that _she_ should call it forth, but she called from him\r\neverything day by day, and no day the same. He had lost much of the\r\nold, but not that passion. And the nature of it which she called had\r\na bewildering beauty.... But there was much to keep the old native of\r\nthe wilds from really entering. The world would have called Bellair’s\r\nidealism _naïve_; and there was something of Fleury in the very\r\nsolution of their lives--not a finger-print of passion in all that\r\nrelation. There was the Unfinished Story of Ogla’s Guest. Finally there\r\nwas the Gleam.\r\n\r\nLife was very full and rare to Bellair, but there seemed always a new\r\nship in the harbour flying Blue Peter for California.... In the main,\r\nthey forgot themselves, as unwatched man and woman, slept under the\r\nsame roof and had their food together; at least, Bellair forgot it for\r\nhours at a time. It seemed the very nature of life; the purity of it\r\nall so obvious.... One afternoon he came up from the city in a cool\r\nsouth wind; a grey afternoon, the sunset watery and lemon-hued. He was\r\nthinking of the ship that would float Blue Peter to-morrow. The homely\r\nscent of damp bark burning quickened his senses, as he crossed the\r\nyard, and he heard her singing to the child. Somehow the woodsmoke had\r\nbrought back to him a Spring day in the northern woods--grey light and\r\ndark pools, all foliage baby-new, a song-sparrow pair trilling back and\r\nforth from edge to open....\r\n\r\nHe saw her in one of the rare flashes of life. She was sitting by the\r\nfireplace, the nearest window across the room. Her figure was softened\r\nin the deep grey light to the pure sensousness of motherhood--except\r\nher face, hands and boots, and that which she held. These were mellowed\r\nin the faintest orange glow from the firelight. Her back was curved\r\nforward, her face bent to the baby’s head, held high in the hollow of\r\nher arms. The dress was caught tightly about her ankles--a covering\r\npliant almost as a night-robe, but that was a mystery of the shadows.\r\nShe was like the figure of some woman he had seen somewhere--some woman\r\nof the river-banks, but this a Madonna of the firelight. He passed on,\r\nand waited before speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nThey went a last time to the city.... There was a place for a chair,\r\nand they had seen an old urn in a by-street which belonged near the\r\nSpring. They felt that these products of men had to be just so, and\r\nthat they had earned a great boon in being given a part at stone\r\ncottage. The things that were brought there must endure; must reason\r\ntogether in long leisure concord, putting on the same inner hue at the\r\nlast and mellowing together as old friends, or old mates. This time,\r\nBellair’s eyes did not meet the city quite as before; it was not as\r\na stranger exactly, who rambles through a port while his ship lies\r\nin the offing. His real berth was an hour’s ride back from the city\r\nand made of stone. Perhaps later he would find work to do here.... A\r\nchild passed them in the store, and brought the change after their\r\npurchase--a boy of twelve or fourteen, his face old with care. It made\r\nBellair think of Davy Acton at Lot & Company’s. They bought a bit of\r\nglass, a bit of silver, some linen and a rug, and rode home with their\r\narms full.\r\n\r\nAnother letter had come from one of the Island headquarters of\r\nStackhouse, in answer to Bellair’s inquiry concerning affairs. The\r\npapers in the wallet had given him clues to the various insular\r\ninterests; and the replies, without exception, represented the\r\nattitudes of agents ready and open to authority from without.\r\nStackhouse had left no centre of force that appeared to have vitality\r\nenough to rise in its own responsibility. Bellair saw that sooner or\r\nlater he must make a visit to these different interests, and that\r\nthe place of the wallet for the time being, at least, amounted\r\nto headquarters. He wrote as explicitly as possible in reply to\r\nthe letters, promised to call in due course, established a freedom\r\nwhere his judgment permitted, but felt the whole vast business very\r\nloosely in hand. New York was first, and it became very clear to him,\r\nespecially on this night, that New York must be entered upon without\r\nfurther delay. There was a thrill of dismay in the thought of the weeks\r\nthat had passed, and the dreaming. Dreams were good. He had needed\r\nthese days; great adjustments and healings had taken place. It had\r\nbeen the pleasant lull between the old and new, the only rest his life\r\nhad known, in fact. All its beauty was massed into the period--but the\r\ndreams must be turned into action now.\r\n\r\nA man may stay just so long in joy. There are moments in every life\r\nwhen the hour strikes for parting. The lover does well to leave his\r\nlady then quickly. There is an understanding in the world that the\r\nwoman invariably whispers, _Stay_, but very often an organisation of\r\nforce that makes austerity possible, does not come from the man alone.\r\nIf the moment of parting passes, the two still lingering together, a\r\nshadow enters between them, blurring their faces for each other’s eyes,\r\ndimming the dream.\r\n\r\nIt does not come from without. The train missed, the passage paid for\r\nand not connected, the column that marches away, one set broken,\r\nthe sentry post to which a strange figure is called--these are but\r\nmatters to laugh at afterward. The shadow comes between them from their\r\nown failure. It is slow to lift. In the final elevation of romance,\r\nthere shows one sunken length.... There is the moment of meeting and\r\nthe moment of parting; that which lies between, whether an hour or\r\ngeneration, forms but the equal third, for the great love intervals of\r\nhuman kind are not measured by time, but by the opening of the doors\r\nof the heart. By the very laws of our being, the doors draw together\r\nagainst rapture prolonged. The man who crosses the world to live\r\none day with his sweetheart, sees her at last in the doorway or the\r\ntrysting-place as he cannot see her again; and in the tear of parting,\r\nsomething different of her, something that has been occulted, clears\r\nmagically for his eyes. It must not blind him to remain, for it is her\r\ngift to abide with him over the divide. It passes, not to come again\r\nif he remains; rapture falls into indulgence; the fibre of integrity\r\nweakens and lets them down into mere mortals. Man is not ready for\r\nthe real revelation of romance in whom a master does not arise at the\r\nstroke.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat night there was a _mew_ at the door. They had finished tea and\r\nwere sitting by the fire. The woman opened the door and a young\r\ntabby-puss walked leisurely in, moved in a circle about the room, tail\r\nheld high. Chair and table and lounge, she brushed against, standing\r\nupon her toes, eyes blinking at the fire. The woman brought a saucer of\r\nmilk. The visitor drank, as if that were all very well, but that she\r\ncould have done well enough until breakfast. Apparently it was not her\r\nway to land upon friends in a starving condition. Before the fire, she\r\nnow sat, adding a point to her toilet from time to time, inspecting it\r\ncarefully and long. Finally she turned to the woman, hopped upon her\r\nknee and settled to doze. She had accepted them, and they called her\r\n_Elsie_.\r\n\r\n“Little-Else-to-do,” said the woman.\r\n\r\nThey stood beside the child’s bed later that night.\r\n\r\nIt rained, and the home closed in upon them with its cheer and humble\r\nbeauty. He saw her hand now in everything--even the rungs of the chairs\r\nshone in the firelight. The hearth was swept. Her face--it was a place\r\nof power, and such a fusion of tenderness was there, the eyes pure\r\nand merciful. All that he had known before her coming was unfinished,\r\nexplanatory. She had shown him what a human adult woman should be in\r\nthis year of our Lord. His soul yearned to her; his whole life nestling\r\nto this place of hers--as her stone cot nestled to the cliff.... She\r\nwas always very quiet about her love for the child when he was near.\r\nThat was because he loved the Gleam so well.... Yet he had seen the\r\nFirelight Madonna.\r\n\r\n“You have made it all I can do--to go away,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I have thought of that--I might have made it easier. I have thought of\r\nthat,” she repeated. “And yet--we were so tired. We seemed to need to\r\nbe ourselves. It has been beautiful--to be ourselves----”\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that she came nearer, but that was impossible for the\r\nchild was between.... Just then his mind finished the other picture--of\r\nher arms held up to the hawthorn buds--a babe of his own in those\r\narms! He would have fought to prevent its coming, but it visualised\r\nof itself. Had it been that which enchanted the woodland?... He was\r\nsilent. She had become even more to him for this instant. He would not\r\ncall it other than beautiful, now that it had come. She was more than\r\never the heart of mystery--the Quest. She knew all these things--love\r\nand maternity she knew; even the passionate fluting of Pan had\r\nquickened her eyes; and where she abode, there was the genius of Home.\r\n\r\nSo slowly had it come--perhaps this was not all. For weeks he had\r\nstood by--day after day, the heart of her becoming more spacious and\r\neloquent; one miracle of the woman after another--finally, to-night\r\nthe mystery of all life about her, for his eyes. Yet to her it was no\r\nmystery; she was _of it_, rhythmically so. She knew the dream--and the\r\nlife that comes at last to quicken it. She could love; she could live;\r\nshe could wait. She loved God--but loved Nature, too. She was spirit,\r\nbut flesh, too. She was powerful in two worlds....\r\n\r\nSo Bellair stood with bowed head, and though Bessie was forgotten,\r\nFleury was not. It was still with him that Fleury and the Faraway Woman\r\nwere fashioned for each other.... “She may be so wonderful to me,\r\nbecause she trusts me to understand----” such was the essence of his\r\nfear. It kept his heart dumb.... That night she brought a pitcher of\r\nwater and placed it upon the hearth, looked up and found him watching.\r\n\r\n“For the fairies,” she said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat changed him a little, brought her nearer to words of his; though\r\nthe effort to speak was like lifting a bridge. She was leaving for her\r\nroom when he managed:\r\n\r\n“Day after to-morrow--the steamer. May we not talk to-night?”\r\n\r\nHe saw her stop. Then she was coming toward him so gladly.\r\n\r\n“Yes--you want the rest of the story?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.... I have been sorry that _he_ couldn’t hear it----”\r\n\r\nShe stood before him, tall and white.\r\n\r\n“I think you are like me,” she said in a moment. “I think you have\r\nsomething behind you that you do not tell--something that made you\r\nwhat you are--yet greater than you seem to yourself.... I would have\r\ntold you while _he_ was with us, but you know how the days passed and\r\nwe could not hold our thoughts together. Then there were times when\r\nwe could not even use our voices.... Do you know that the world is\r\nwonderful--that the thousands about us do not even dream how wonderful\r\nit is--how tremendous even miseries are? Sometimes I think that the\r\ntragedies we meet are our greatest hours.”\r\n\r\n“You have met them,” he said, a part of her spirit almost. “I have\r\nseen them in your eyes. It gave me the sense of shelter with you and\r\nlimitless understanding---”\r\n\r\n“I am thankful for that,” she whispered. “When we have understanding,\r\nwe have everything. Those who in their childhood are made to suffer\r\nhorribly are often the ones who reach understanding. Sometimes they\r\nsuffer too much and become dulled and dumb. Sometimes in the very ache\r\nof their story, which can be so rarely told, they risk the telling to\r\nsome one not ready. It aches so, as its stays and stays untold. Oh, the\r\nwhole world craves understanding, and yet if we tell our story to one\r\nwho is not ready--we hurt them and ourselves, and add unto our misery.\r\nThere are moments set apart in life in which one finds understanding,\r\nbut the world presses in the next day, and the story does not look so\r\nwell. The spirit of it fades and the actions do not seem pure when the\r\nspirit is out--so one loses a loved friend. Oh, I am talking vaguely.\r\nIt is not my way to talk vaguely--but to-night--it is like a division\r\nof roads, and a story is to be told---”\r\n\r\n“Do you think the story will diminish in my mind to-morrow?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“No--not you. I have seen you through the sunlight and the dark looking\r\ninto my eyes for it. If I thought it would diminish in your mind--yes,\r\nI would tell it just the same. It must be told--but life would not be\r\nthe same. Even this, our little stone cot, would not be the same. I\r\nshould have to become harder and harder to hold--to follow the Gleam----\r\n\r\n“... I shall be Olga in the rest of the story,” she was saying. “For\r\nI am Olga.... The truth is, I have no other name. There is one that\r\nI used, and another that I formerly used--but they are not mine. You\r\nshall see.... My father prospered with the sheep-raising, and slowly on\r\nthe long road that you have seen, houses came one by one, until at last\r\nthere was a village about us. My father was like the village father,\r\nand my mother the source of its wisdom in doctoring and maternal\r\naffairs--she had learned by bringing forth. But I was not of them--they\r\nall saw that. The coming of plenty, the coming of the people, the\r\ncoming of men to woo my sisters, and the maidens my brothers brought\r\nfor us to see, before they took them quite away--none of these things\r\nwere so real to me as the coming of my Guest when I was such a little\r\ngirl. And none remembered that--not even my mother. Until I ceased to\r\nspeak of it, they tried to make me think it was a dream. But I knew\r\nthat rapture. It had changed me. I was always to search for it again. I\r\nwas always looking for another such night--for that afterglow again. I\r\nwas the last child and the silent one.\r\n\r\n“But all that had to do with children was intimate and wonderful to\r\nme.... I remember once when we were all girls at home together, and\r\nthey were talking--each of what she should have for her treasure from\r\nthe household--one walnut, one silver, one an inlaid desk--and they\r\nturned to me laughingly, for I was not consulted as a rule, I said I\r\nwanted the little hickory cradle in an upper closet. It was one of\r\nthose household days which girls remember.... All was happier then.\r\nThe little cradle seemed like a casket in which jewels had come to my\r\nmother--seven times. We had all smiled at her first from that hickory\r\ncradle.... I went up stairs to look at it--a dim place full of life and\r\nmessages to me. I was weak; my arms ached; and it was so dear that I\r\ndare not say that it was mine.... My father said the cradle must belong\r\nto the eldest girl.\r\n\r\n“... I began to sense the terrible actuality of life through the\r\nmating of Lois, ten years older, with a countryman who came for her.\r\nFor sisters, Lois and I had always been far apart, and this stranger\r\nwho wished to marry her, had nothing to do with life as I dreamed\r\nit--a child of twelve. To many, Lois was the loveliest of us--large,\r\ncalm, dark and quiet, very well, slow of speech, but quick to smile.\r\nHad you visited our house then, you would have remembered my father’s\r\npatriarchal air, the smile of Lois, and the maternity that brooded\r\nover us all. The rest you would get afterward--a variety of young\r\npeople with different faults and attractions--I the grey one, last to\r\nbe noted. Lois was given credit for more than she was. I do not love\r\nbrain or power, but I seem to love courage. Lois had something to take\r\nthe place of these--not courage--and no, not power nor brain. She had\r\nsensuousness and appetite.\r\n\r\n“One night I seemed to see what the whole house was straining for--a\r\nkind of process of marriage continually afoot. Just now it was Lois.\r\nI remember my father being called into the front room where Lois and\r\nCollinge had been for an evening--his face beaming when he came forth,\r\nand my mother’s quiet sanction. There were conferences after that,\r\ndressmaking, the arrangement of money affairs. And I was suddenly ill\r\nwith it. To me, there could be no trade or public business. To me, it\r\nhad to do with a child and that was consecrated ground. Oh, you must\r\nsee it had to be different. I wanted it like a stroke of lightning.\r\nI did not understand but I wanted it like that--like a flight of\r\nswans--and not talk and property transactions. To me it had to do with\r\nrain and frost and the tides and the pulses of plants--the silent\r\nthings. I did not understand--but knew that children came to those who\r\ntook each other.\r\n\r\n“I remember one supper; the countryman talked--talked of the marriage\r\nday--the breakfast, the ceremony--the end and the dusk, and turned to\r\nLois with sleepy half-folded eyes. She was smiling and flushed--and I\r\nlooked from face to face at the table, at my sisters--and I rushed away\r\nbecause I could find nothing pure.... Some one said my mother never\r\nlooked prettier.... I remember the flood of honeysuckle perfume that\r\ncame to me in the torture of hatred, as I passed through the distant\r\nhall.... And then later from the top of the stairs, Lois and my mother\r\nwere talking, and Lois said:\r\n\r\n“‘You know, Mother, we will not have children for the first three\r\nyears, at least----’”\r\n\r\n“I was somehow below by her in the lower hall. She seemed a rosy pig\r\nupstanding, marked red and flaming.... And that night long afterward,\r\nmy mother found me and said, ‘You are getting beyond me, Olga.’ ...\r\nBut I could only think of men and women copying the squirrels,\r\nfilling their bins, dressing their door-yards, reaching for outer\r\nthings--and it was back of my very being--back of the mother and the\r\npatriarch--back of the shepherding and the folding--back of _me_.\r\nI hated life with destroying hatred--Lois wanting the seasons, but\r\nunwilling to bring forth fruit, accepting the countryman’s idea of\r\nlife.... Can you see that it had the look of death to me?”\r\n\r\nBellair could only bow his head. To him the woman was revealing the\r\ngrim days through which she had won her poise and power.... She was\r\ntelling another incident with the same inclination--for the thought\r\nof being a mother had been the one master of her days. He seemed to\r\nsee the child, the girl, the younger woman about her--a grey-eyed,\r\nred-lipped girl, with a waist that was smaller and smaller as she\r\ngained in inches from fifteen to eighteen--madness for mothering,\r\npassionate in that, but not passionate for sensation--her face\r\nsometimes so white, that they would ask her mother, “Is Olga quite\r\nwell?”... Yet teeming with that intensive health that goes with small\r\nbones and perfect assimilation--that finds all to sustain life in fruit\r\nand leaves ... books, light sleeping, impassioned with the lives of\r\ngreat women and the saints--one of those who come to the world for\r\ndevotion and austerity and instant sacrifice; yet for none of these\r\napart; rather a fruitful vine, her prevailing and perennial passion\r\nfor motherhood.\r\n\r\n“And yet I almost ceased to breathe,” she was saying, “when I came to\r\nunderstand man’s part in these things. I felt _myself_ differently\r\nafter that--even children--but from this early crisis which so many men\r\nand women have met with untellable suffering, emerged a calm that could\r\nnot have come without it. The travail brought me deep into the truth.\r\nFor all great things the price must be paid--how wonderfully we learned\r\nthat in the open boat. There are sordid processes in the production of\r\nall fine things--even in the bringing forth of a Messiah.”\r\n\r\nShe paused, as if she saw something enter the eyes that had listened\r\nso fervently. Bellair cleared his voice. “I remember something _he_\r\nsaid,” he told her. “That matter is the slate--spirit the message that\r\nis written. The slate is broken, the message erased, but _eyes_ have\r\nseen it, and the transaction is complete. For the spirit has integrated\r\nitself in expression----”\r\n\r\n“I think he said it, for you to tell me now,” the Faraway Woman\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\n“Only _he_ could have halted your story,” Bellair added.\r\n\r\n“... I told you when my Guest came in the afterglow, of the house\r\nof our nearest but distant neighbour; now I am telling you of years\r\nafterward, when there were many houses between on the long road, and\r\nmy playmate Paul had gone away to Sidney. Lois had long been married. I\r\nwas seventeen--and so strangely and subtly hungering--for expression,\r\nfor something that I did not know, which meant reality to me, but which\r\nwas foreign and of no import to all about me. Often at evening I stared\r\nup the long road.... I remember late one night in the nearest house,\r\nthe soft wind brought me the cry of a child. It was so newly come and\r\nit was not well. I went to it just as I was, though the people had just\r\nmoved in and were strange to us. It was thirst--as we know. I went to\r\nit, as we would have gone to a waterfall. The door of their house was\r\nlocked, but I knocked. The father came down at last. The lower rooms\r\nwere filled with unpacked boxes. I told him why I had come. He talked\r\nto me strangely. He went upstairs and sent the mother down to me. It\r\ndid not seem as if I could live through that night--and not have my\r\nway. She put her arms about me, led me upstairs to a room that was\r\nnot occupied--save a chair by the window. I stood there waiting until\r\nshe returned with the child.... I saw lights back in our house when\r\nthey missed me--voices, but I could not go. In the early light I heard\r\nthe woman saying to my mother: ‘... We really needed her so. Baby was\r\nrestless, but he is much better and quiet with her. They are very happy\r\ntogether.... Yes, she is safe and well.’”\r\n\r\nThe Faraway Woman left him now to go to the child.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nReturning, she put the kettle on, and made tea in the earthen pot. To\r\nBellair her coming into the room again was a replenishment--as if she\r\nhad been gone for hours; and this started a pang deep in his heart,\r\nwhich presently suffused everything when he realised that his ship had\r\ncome for him. It was past midnight.... In reality it was to-morrow that\r\nhis ship would sail.\r\n\r\n“You listen wonderfully,” she said.\r\n\r\n“It seems all about the little Gleam,” he answered. “It makes\r\neverything significant about the open boat.... I forget to swallow----”\r\n\r\nThey laughed together.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, I can hardly realise when we are here--that this is New\r\nZealand?” she said presently, “that only a little way back is the long\r\nroad and the river and the ravine--the neighbour’s house and ours and\r\nthe other houses between.... I will tell you the rest very quickly--and\r\noh, let me tell you first, I am not afraid. In spite of all I know, I\r\nam not----”\r\n\r\nShe was bending forward across the table.\r\n\r\n“... I was a woman when Paul came back from the distant city--and came\r\nfirst of all to me. He was changed--something excellent about his\r\nface and carriage, and something I did not understand at all, his\r\nface deeper lined, his voice lower, his words ready. I did not think\r\nabout him when he was away. In the first evenings we passed together,\r\nI had only an old-time laugh for him. I kissed him with something\r\nlike affection. We were permitted to be alone together, and I saw the\r\nold look upon my father’s face--that I had hated so. That look--even\r\nbefore the playmate thing had departed from me. Then I began to _see_\r\nPaul--something I could not like nor understand, a readiness of words,\r\nand he was not wise enough to make them ring deeply. I seemed to be\r\nstudying in him the novelty of a man--through the eyes of a girl.\r\n\r\n“One night we were together in my father’s house. It was our Spring and\r\nraining softly on the steps. The grass seemed full of odours, and the\r\nvines trembling with life. He kissed me there. It seemed that I hardly\r\nknew. I was looking over his shoulder into the dark, and I saw a little\r\nwhite face. It was like a rain-washed flower ... and to me it was quite\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n“... Everything that I had known and loved--compensation for all that I\r\nhad missed and hungered for. Only the little face--but I knew the arms\r\nwere held out to me.\r\n\r\n“Paul knew nothing of this. He was not to blame. It was not he, who\r\ncarried me away. He was merely being the man he fancied--playing the\r\nthing as the world had taught him--showing himself fervent and a man.\r\nI could have laughed at his kisses.... I have nothing against him.\r\nIt was his way.... But once he kissed me--and it came to me that he\r\nwas the way--that he must join his call to mine.... I could do all\r\nbut that--I need not love him. Can you understand--it seemed as if\r\neverything was done but that--that the little face had already chosen\r\nme.... I sent him away, and I remember long afterward I was standing on\r\nthe porch alone. It rained.”\r\n\r\nBellair realised now that she was watching him with something like\r\nanguish. A different picture of her came to him from that moment--filed\r\nfor the long days apart--the rapt look of her mouth, and the pearl\r\nin her hair that brought out the lustre of whiteness from her\r\nskin--full-bosomed, but slender--slender hands that trembled and moved\r\ntoward him as she spoke.... It was something for him--as if he had\r\nalways been partly asleep before--as if she had brought some final\r\narousing component to his being.\r\n\r\n“... My mother did not ask but once. When I told her--the horror came\r\nto me that she would die. I had not thought of it before. I had thought\r\nthat it was mine--had seen very little of Paul. In fact, he had come\r\nseveral times, when I would not see him.... She called my father--and\r\nit was all to be enacted again. For a moment, I thought he would strike\r\nme. The most dreadful thing to them all was that I was not ashamed.\r\nThey felt that I was unnatural....\r\n\r\n“There was one high day in that little upper room. It was all like a\r\nprayer, when they would suffer me to be alone and not wring me with\r\ntheir misery--but this one high day, I must tell you. I stood by\r\nthe window in the watery light of the sun from the far north. That\r\nmoment the Strange Courage came. I felt that I could lead a nation,\r\nnot to war, but to enduring peace; as if I had a message for all my\r\npeople, and a courage not of woman’s, to tell it, to tell it again and\r\nagain--until all the people answered. It was then that I understood\r\nthat a man’s soul had come to my baby, and that it was not to be a\r\ngirl, as I had sometimes thought.\r\n\r\n“And then the rest of the waiting--days of misery that I can hardly\r\nremember the changes of--yet something singing within me--I holding\r\nit high toward heaven as I could--singing with the song within. After\r\nweeks, it suddenly came to me what they wanted to do to hide their\r\nshame--to take the little child half-finished from me--to murder it--to\r\nhide their shame.\r\n\r\n“Then I told them that it had not occurred to me to marry Paul--that\r\nI did not love him--that I had loved the little child. I told them\r\nthat I did not believe in the world--that I did not believe I had done\r\nwrong--that I did not believe our old preacher who stayed so long at\r\nthe table could make me more ready for the child. I told my father that\r\nI did not believe in marrying a man and saying that I would have no\r\nchildren for three years. I told him that I was mad for the child--that\r\nI was young and strong and ready to die for it ... that my baby wanted\r\nme, and no other. I would have gone away, but they would not let me do\r\nthat. They kept me in an upper room. Paul had gone away ... and after\r\nmonths my father went to find him. It was sad to me--sadness that\r\nI cannot forget in that--my father taking his cane and his bag and\r\nsetting out to find the father--heart-broken and full of the awfulness\r\nof being away from his home. He had not been away for years.... And\r\nmy mother coming timidly to my room.... And then I went down like\r\nPharaoh’s daughter to the very edge of the water--for, for the Gleam!”\r\n\r\nHer eyes were shining and she laughed a little, looking upward\r\nas if she saw a vision of it, and had forgotten the room and the\r\nlistening--her eyes as close to tears as laughter.\r\n\r\n“... And when I came back--it was all so different. I could pity\r\nthem--my heart breaking for my father and mother, who had not the\r\nwonder, and only the fears. They were passing out--after doing their\r\nbest as they saw it, for many, many years together--and I had brought\r\nthem the tragedy, the crumbling of their house--a shame upon the\r\npatriarch of the long road, a blackness upon her maternities.... It was\r\nmy father’s thought to bring Paul to me. As if I would have taken him,\r\nbut he came--my father having given him much money.... Oh, do not be\r\nhard upon him. There is wildness in him and looseness, but the world\r\nhad showed him the way and he was young. I said to him (it was within\r\nten days after the coming and my father and mother were gone from the\r\nroom), ‘I would not think of marrying you, Paul, but do not tell them.\r\nAs soon as I am ready, I shall go away with you, and they will not be\r\nso unhappy--and as soon as we are well away, you shall be free. And you\r\nmay keep the money, Paul.’\r\n\r\n“... And now it is like bringing you a reward for listening so well. I\r\ntell you now of a moment of beauty and wonder--such as I had known but\r\nonce before, and was more real to me than all the rest. It made that\r\nwhich was sorrowful and sordid of the rest seem of little account....\r\nIt was early evening in the upper room and still light. An old\r\nservant who loved me was in the room, and the Gleam was sleeping--the\r\nfourteenth day after his coming. The woman helped me to a chair and\r\ndrew it to the window, and all was hushed. Even before I looked out, an\r\nunspeakable happiness began to gush into my heart.\r\n\r\n“The ravine was crowding with darkness, but the long road was full\r\nof light. The houses between seemed to dwindle but the distance was\r\nfull of radiance--that perfect afterglow again. Not for twenty years\r\nhad there been such a sunset, and now the sky was massed with gold of\r\nthe purple martin’s breast, and the roof of Paul’s house was like two\r\nopen leaves of beaten gold--everywhere the air filled with strange\r\nbrightenings. The fragrance from the fields arose to meet the heaven\r\nfalling from the sky.\r\n\r\n“I tried to make believe, but the road was empty. The Guest would never\r\ncome again, and yet on such a night as this, he had come to me--like\r\na saint that has finished his work, like a Master coming down a last\r\ntime. All the room and the house was hushed behind me.... But the long\r\nroad was empty.\r\n\r\n“The old servant at last could bear it no longer. Perhaps she thought\r\nI did not breathe. Softly she crossed the room to the cradle, lifted\r\nthe Gleam and placed him in my lap--as if to call me back. Breath came\r\nquickly at the touch of him, and she must have heard a low, joyous\r\nsound as I felt the child. With one hand I held him, patting his\r\nshoulder softly, slowly, with the other, until the ecstasy of long ago\r\nflowed into my being.\r\n\r\n“There was a moment that I should have asked her to take the Gleam\r\nfrom me--had I been able to speak. It was such a moment that I had run\r\nout under the stars. But as I patted the tiny shoulder, the burden of\r\nthe ecstasy passed, and a durable blessedness came--the calm of great\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n“The road--of course it was empty--for he had come.... I thought I had\r\ntold the old servant, but a second time I seemed to see her anxious\r\nface bending so near in the dusk.\r\n\r\n“‘Why, don’t you see?’ I whispered. ‘He was looking for his mother when\r\nI found him.’”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat was the end of the story--the rest just details that an outsider\r\nmight ask: How she went away with Paul for the sake of her father; how\r\nhe remained with her during the long voyage to America, but as nothing\r\nto her, more and more a stranger of different ways from hers--how he\r\ngave her but a little of the money her father had put in trust for her\r\nkeeping--and rushed away to dig his grave in the city.... Then just a\r\nglimpse of her need and her labour and longing for the Island life--a\r\ndream, the _Jade_....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   5\r\n\r\nThe final morning, Bellair took the babe in his arms and let himself\r\ndown the rocky way to the shore. The trail was empty behind him, and\r\nthe cottage shut off by the group of little pines, pure to pass through\r\nas the room of a child. And here were rain-washed boulders warming\r\nin the morning sun, and before his eyes the blue and deep-eyed sea.\r\nIt rolled up to his feet, forever changing with its stories and its\r\nsecrets, very cool about them all to-day, full of mastery and leisure.\r\n\r\nBellair sat upon a stone and looked at the child: “I wish you could\r\ntell me, little man ... but you are not telling. You know it all, like\r\nthe sea--but you do not tell.... And I’ll see you so many times, when\r\nI’m away,--see you like this and wish many times I could hold you. For\r\nwe were always friends, good friends. You didn’t ask much.... And you\r\nwere fine in the pinch, my son.... That little cry I heard, that little\r\ncry.... He loved you, and promised great things for you. I’ve come to\r\nbelieve it, little man, for I know your mother. That’s good gambling,\r\nfrom where I stand.... He knew it first. He knew it all first. And you\r\ndidn’t tell him.... Oh, be all to her, little Gleam--be all to her, and\r\ntell her I love her--when she looks away to the sea. Tell her, I’ll be\r\ncoming, perhaps.... I didn’t know I’d ever be called to kiss a little\r\nboy--but it’s all the same to you ... and take care of her for me.”\r\n\r\nThey were standing together a last time before his journey. The\r\ncarriage had been waiting many minutes. The child was propped upon the\r\nlawn, and Elsie was picking her steps and shaking her paws that met\r\nthe dew under the grass. His eye was held over her shoulder to the\r\nweathered door of the stone cottage. It was ajar and coppery brown,\r\nlike the walls above the young vines. And over her other shoulder, too,\r\nwas the brilliant etheric divide of the sea. He had to go back and\r\nstand a moment in the large room. The wind and the light came in; the\r\nvine tendrils came trailing in. He saw her books, her pictures, her\r\nchair, her door....\r\n\r\nHe stood beside her again, and tried to tell her how moving these weeks\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we have seen both sides, and this was the perfect side. We saw\r\nthe other, well----”\r\n\r\n“And you are not caught in either--that’s what thrills me most,” said\r\nhe. “I am always caught--in hunger and thirst and fear and pain--in\r\nbeauty and possessions. But you have stood the same through it\r\nall--ready to come or go, ready for sun or storm----”\r\n\r\n“After years of changes and uncertainty, one comes to rely only upon\r\nthe true things.”\r\n\r\n“I shall want to come back--before the first turn of the road,” he\r\nsaid. “I think I am hungry for the little house now----”\r\n\r\nShe put her arms about him. His heart was torn, but there was something\r\nimmortal in the moment.\r\n\r\n“This shall always be your home,” she said. “You may come back\r\nto-night--to-morrow--in twenty years--this is your house. I shall\r\nbe here. I shall teach _him_ to know and welcome you.... We are\r\ndifferent. We are not strangers. We have gone down into the deep ways\r\ntogether. We shall always know each other, as no one else can, or as we\r\ncan know no others. So we must be much to each other--and this is our\r\nhome. You will never forget.... Oh, yes, you must come back--just as\r\nyou must go away----”\r\n\r\nSentence by sentence, softly, easily spoken; not with a great beauty\r\nof saying, but with a bestowal of the heart that compelled his finest\r\nreceptivity. And she had held him as a mother might, or as a sister, or\r\nas a woman who loved him. There was something in her tenure, of all the\r\nloves of earth. He looked deeply into her eyes, but hers was the love\r\nthat did not betray itself then in the senses. He could not know, for\r\nhe would not trust his own heart.... But this he knew, and was much to\r\nponder afterward: This which she gave, could not have been given, nor\r\nhave been received, before the days of the open boat. So strange was\r\nthe ministry of that fasting.\r\n\r\nThey kissed, and hers so gladly given, failed of the secret; yet\r\nrevealed to him a love that sustained, and sent him forth a man--such\r\nas Bellair had not been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SIX\r\n\r\nLOT & COMPANY: II\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nBELLAIR reached New York on a mid-May morning from the west, and walked\r\nup Seventh avenue to his old room. It was a time of day that he had\r\nseldom known the street and step. There was a different expression\r\nof daylight upon them. Of course, he had met these matters on many\r\nSundays, but Sunday light and atmosphere was invariably different\r\nto his eyes--something foreign and false about it. He saw the old\r\nhall-mark, however, in the vestibule--the partial sweeping.... It\r\nhad always been her way; all things a form. The vestibule and stone\r\nsteps had to be swept--that was the law; to be swept with strength and\r\nthoroughness was secondary. He rang, and asked the servant for the\r\nwoman of the house.\r\n\r\nWaiting, he found himself in a singular depression of mind. The City\r\nhad cramped and bewildered him. A small oval of grey-white cloud\r\nappeared in the dark hall. It came nearer, and Bellair saw the face of\r\ndusty wax--smaller, a little lower from his eyes. It came very near,\r\nand was upturned. The vision was dim, and the memory; all the passages\r\nslow and cluttered.\r\n\r\n“It is Mr. Bellair,” she said, without offering her hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I’ve come back.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t a room--for you.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m sorry.”\r\n\r\n“And about your things in storage--I would be glad for the space now.\r\nCould you take care of this to-day?’\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“I have the bill ready.”... She called the servant who came with the\r\nbroom. “On my table among the papers you will find Mr. Bellair’s bill\r\nfor storage. Please get it.”\r\n\r\nBellair heard the servant on the stairs, one, two, three flights; then\r\na long silence. He had never been quite sure where the landlady slept,\r\nbelieving that she hovered from basement to sky-light according to the\r\nebb and flow of the tenant tides. The double-doors from the hall to the\r\nlower front room were slightly ajar. This, the most expensive in the\r\nhouse, appeared to be vacant. The servant was gone a long time. The\r\nlandlady did not leave him alone in the hall. They did not speak. The\r\ndarkness crept upon Bellair as if he were in a tank that was slowly\r\nbut surely being filled, and presently would cover him. The paper was\r\nbrought, the charge for six months’ storage, meagre. Bellair paid it,\r\nand offered more. He thought of her hard life, but the extra money was\r\npassed back to him.\r\n\r\n“I have that present in keeping,” she said.\r\n\r\n“What present?”\r\n\r\n“That you gave me the night you went away----”\r\n\r\n“But I gave it to you. Would you not take a little gift from one who\r\nhad been in your house five years?”\r\n\r\n“Money easily got, goes the same,” she answered.\r\n\r\nThen Bellair realised how stupid he had been. She had seen the\r\nnewspapers. She had been afraid to trust him alone in that bare hall.\r\nThe smell of carpets stifled him.\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry you feel that way,” he said. “But hold the present a little\r\nlonger. Perhaps you will not always feel that it came so easily. I’ll\r\nsend for my goods at once.... Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Mr. Bellair.”\r\n\r\nHe was ill. The side-door of a famous hotel yawned to him directly\r\nacross the street from his step. He was not sure they would take him.\r\nRegistering, he stopped to think where he was from, adding Auckland, N.\r\nZ.... Yes, his bags would be brought from the station. They gave him a\r\nroom, and Bellair stood in the centre of it.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments he actually weakened--limbs and mind. It wasn’t New\r\nYork alone, nor the sordid incident across the street, reminding him\r\nso ruthlessly of Lot & Company and all that had been and was still to\r\ndo; rather it was a giving way to a loneliness that had been rising\r\nfor almost a month, wearing him to a shadow of himself, and giving\r\nhim battle night and morning. Like many another solitary young man,\r\nhe had brooded much upon what a certain woman might be. He had found\r\nthat in those women he met, certain spaces must be filled in by his\r\nown compassion--and these spaces did not endure. Always in a test\r\nthey separated from the reality. But the Faraway Woman day by day had\r\nfulfilled; even where his idealism failed, she completed the picture of\r\nthe woman above him and of irresistible attraction.\r\n\r\nShe had come nearer and nearer. She was magic in this way. He had\r\nregarded her at first distantly and askance at the rail of the _Jade_.\r\nA gasp now came from him. That was so impossible and long ago.... She\r\nhad not called him any more than a peasant woman. And yet one after\r\nanother her rarities had unfolded; it would always be so. She was\r\nthe very fountain of romance to him; the essence of whose attraction\r\nis variableness of days. Of all the days together, there had been\r\nno two alike--no two hours alike. He had watched her face under the\r\nlight--never twice the same. The child, the maiden, the mother, the\r\nlove-woman, the saint--lips passional, devotional ... then those\r\nwonder-moments when the old tragedies came back to her eyes.\r\n\r\nThey stirred him as if he had known her long ago; and yet nothing of\r\nthis had come to him at first. How crude and coarse he had been not\r\nto see. Lot & Company and New York had covered her from his eyes. He\r\nhad to fast and pray and concentrate upon her being, as a devotee upon\r\nthe ball of crystal to begin upon her mysteries. Every man has his\r\nLot & Company, his New York--the forces that bind him to the world.\r\nA man bound to the world can see but the body of a thing--the paint\r\nof a picture, just the outline and pigment of a picture or a bit of\r\nnature--just the body of a woman.\r\n\r\nSomething came to him that instant--of the perfect law of all\r\nthings. Those caught in the body of events see but that, hear but\r\nthat, anticipate but that--the very secret of all the misery and\r\nshortsightedness in the world. A man must rise, lift the centre of\r\nconsciousness above the body of things, even to see physical matters\r\nin their true relation. It was all so thrillingly true to him in this\r\nglimpse--that a man can never see properly the sequence of his actions\r\nunless he can rise above them--that those in the ruck never know what\r\nthey are about....\r\n\r\nHe tried to remember her face, as he stood in the hotel room. Failing,\r\nhis mind returned to their days together. He was apart now and could\r\nview them, one by one, in their wonder and beauty. He was torn with\r\nthem. At different times on the long voyage he had dwelt separately\r\nupon the episodes. Some had worn him to exhaustion. People on the ship\r\nhad believed him a man with a great grief. At first, he looked about\r\nfrom face to face searching for some one whom he might tell, but there\r\nwas no reception for his story. He had to stop and think that he was\r\ndifferent and apart.... She had always been apart.\r\n\r\nHe had carried it alone, moving hushed and alone with his story; lying\r\nopen-eyed in his berth through the hours of night, and often through\r\nthe afternoons, an open book face downward upon his chest, his pipe\r\ncold ... living again the different moments in the rooms of the stone\r\ncottage, in the garden, on the shore; their journeys together, their\r\nbreakfasts and luncheons and evenings together.\r\n\r\nThe boy was gone from him, from face and body. He did not know what\r\nhad come instead, but he knew that he carried a creative image in his\r\nheart; something of the fragrance of her lingering about him. It had\r\ncome to him at night alone on deck--the sweetness of her--on the wind.\r\nAll that he wanted, all that he dreamed best of life and labour and\r\nlove ... and yet after all, what had he to do with her in relation\r\nto these intimate things? Friend, companion, confidante--she was\r\neverything that a woman could be, except---- Had not the substance of\r\nthat kind of giving died for her in the passing of the preacher?...\r\nSomething of her story frightened him. She had learned the ultimate\r\nrealness of loving. The man who entered her heart now would have to\r\ncome with an immortal seal upon him. There was but one who could take\r\nup the fatherhood of the Gleam.... Bellair did not feel the man; did\r\nnot know what she had given him; did not know what had come to him--to\r\nhis face and carriage and voice. He had not yet lifted himself above\r\nso that he could see. Those whom he met, however, were struck with\r\na different Bellair, and those who could not understand thought him\r\ntouched a little queerly--as a man after sunstroke or any great light.\r\n\r\n... It was now noon. He thought of his old friend, Broadwell, of the\r\nadvertising-desk at Lot & Company. Perhaps Broadwell would dine with\r\nhim. He called. The voice came back to him.... Yes, he would come at\r\nonce. Bellair asked him to the hotel. In the interval he called the\r\nTrust company in whose keeping the thousand dollar surety had been,\r\ninquiring if Lot & Company had collected the amount. The answer was\r\nreturned presently to the effect that Lot & Company had presented his\r\nrelease and collected the amount with interest four days after his\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nBellair hearkened to a faint singing somewhere within and found it had\r\nto do with Bessie. He called Brandt’s and ascertained that the same\r\nquartette was to sing there at nine in the evening. This was also one\r\nof the things he had come to do.\r\n\r\nBroadwell was a trifle late, but all urbanity. There was something of\r\nthe salesman’s manner and enunciation about him. Bellair fell away\r\nafter the greeting, caught in a sort of mental flurry in which the\r\npicture of another luncheon engagement recurred to his mind--the day he\r\nhad passed the desk and cage of Mr. Sproxley with the stranger named\r\nFilbrick, and his own telling of the cashier’s passionate honour....\r\nWhen he came back to see clearly the face of Broadwell, he found that\r\nhe personally was being scrutinised with odd intensity. Could it be\r\nthat Broadwell had something more than a personal friendly interest?\r\nHis questions did not seem adroit, and yet he wanted to know so\r\nmuch--of the ship, of Auckland, but especially of this long drive back\r\nto New York.\r\n\r\n“Are you stopping here?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes. My old room was just opposite, but I was told that the house was\r\nfull.”\r\n\r\n“So you came here?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And are you going to stay in New York?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know, Ben. There are a few things to see to.”\r\n\r\n“Are you looking for a job?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no. Not exactly, at least.”\r\n\r\nTry as he might, Bellair could not feel free, as of old time. He felt\r\nthe other wanted something, and this checked his every offering.\r\nHe knew that Broadwell, at least six months before, could not have\r\nbelieved ill of Lot & Company, and there was no apparent change. The\r\ndisclosure of the press must have righted itself in the office so far\r\nas he, Bellair, was concerned; surely Broadwell did not share the dread\r\nof him the landlady had shown; and yet, it was hard to broach these\r\nthings. The advertising-man apparently had no intention of doing so.\r\n\r\n“We’ve all missed you on the lower floor,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Are there any changes?”\r\n\r\n“Very few.”\r\n\r\n“Who took my place?”\r\n\r\n“Man from outside. Mr. Rawter brought in the man--middle-aged. Mr.\r\nSproxley knew him, too.”\r\n\r\n“Poor devil,” said Bellair, but not audibly. They had not dared to\r\nopen the ledger revelations to any one in the office, but had found a\r\nman outside who was doubtless familiar with such books, doubtless one\r\nwho had been deformed in the long, slow twistings of trade. Perhaps\r\nthis one had children. Children were good for Lot & Company’s most\r\ntrusted servants. It was well to have a number of children, like Mr.\r\nSproxley--for their wants are many, and a man’s soul cannot breathe in\r\nthe midst of many wants and small salary.\r\n\r\n“Are you coming over to the office?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I find I have to. Some folks are taking the end Lot and Company\r\ngave the newspapers about my leaving. They were very much in a hurry\r\nabout giving out that newspaper story--with the money in the vaults.”\r\n\r\nBroadwell regarded him seriously. “I suppose they took the point of\r\nview that there could be but one motive for your leaving, without\r\ngiving notice. Most firms would----”\r\n\r\n“I wonder if most firms would?” Bellair asked. “Men have lapses other\r\nthan falling into thievery. At least a firm should look up the facts\r\nin the case first. It’s a rather serious thing to charge a man with\r\ndeparture with funds. For instance, the public will glance through the\r\ndetails of such a charge, and miss entirely a denial afterward. Are you\r\nunder bond?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t handle company funds----”\r\n\r\n“Suppose you were--and one night you came to the end of your\r\nrope--found you couldn’t go back--found it was a life or death\r\nmatter of your soul, whether you went back or not. Still you had\r\nsome salary coming and say a thousand dollars’ surety. You took this\r\namount exactly--salary and bond and interest to the dollar, and left\r\na note saying so, in place of the amount; also a note releasing to\r\nyour firm the amount of the bond and interest, and stating clearly the\r\nitem of salary--I say, would you expect to find yourself charged with\r\nembezzlement in next day’s paper?”\r\n\r\nBroadwell’s shoulders straightened.\r\n\r\n“Not in next day’s paper,” he said, with a smile.\r\n\r\nBellair did not miss the cut of this.\r\n\r\n“You think that my case was not like that exactly?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I can’t see why a firm would give such a story to the press--unless\r\nthey uncovered a loss,” Broadwell said slowly.\r\n\r\n“Lot & Company couldn’t have uncovered a loss without looking in the\r\nvery place where my note was, which proved there was no loss. Lot &\r\nCompany couldn’t have collected my bond without proceedings--unless\r\nthey found my release of it. And the bond was collected.”\r\n\r\n“Then I can’t see any reason for incriminating--any one,” said\r\nBroadwell.\r\n\r\n“Well, there was a reason--though the facts of my case are exactly as\r\nstated. Lot & Company had a reason. I haven’t decided whether it will\r\nbe necessary to make that known.... But I didn’t bring you here to\r\ndiscuss this affair. I wanted to see _you_----”\r\n\r\nJust then Mr. Broadwell was paged. A messenger was said to be waiting\r\nfor him in the lobby.\r\n\r\n“Send him in,” Broadwell said thoughtlessly.\r\n\r\nDavy Acton came, and Broadwell saw his error. Bellair perceived that\r\nhis luncheon-companion had made known his engagement at the office\r\nbefore leaving....\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Davy. I’m glad to see you----”\r\n\r\nThe boy had grown. Bellair noted that simple thing, as he noted the\r\nfact also that Davy was tortured with embarrassment, and had not meant\r\nto come in. He wriggled his hand forward to take Bellair’s, which was\r\nheld toward his, and then looked down shamefacedly, as if _he_ had been\r\ncharged with theft. Bellair knew well that the boy’s trouble was how to\r\nmeet him--formerly a friend, but now an outcast from the firm. A kind\r\nof darkness stole over him. He saw now that Broadwell believed him a\r\nthief, even as the landlady had believed; but in the case of neither\r\nof these did the dread finality come to him, as from the face of this\r\nstricken boy.\r\n\r\nThis was the thought that shot through Bellair’s mind, “No one liked\r\nDavy so well as I did; no one tried to help him as I did; and now he\r\nthinks my liking and my helping, a part of the looseness of character\r\nwhich made me a thief.”\r\n\r\nThe thought was strange, yet natural, too. It came into the darkness\r\nwhich had covered the abode of Bellair’s consciousness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“A bit of copy--that I missed getting off,” Broadwell was saying. “I\r\nwas excited when you called.... All right, Davy. I’ve told ’em where\r\nto find it on the back of the note.... And now Bellair--you were\r\nsaying----”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nBellair watched for the turn on the part of Broadwell that would reveal\r\nthe character of his message, for he did not believe the matter of the\r\ncopy for the printer. The chill was thick between them, yet Bellair\r\nmanaged to say:\r\n\r\n“I’m not here for reprisal or trouble-making. It’s rather a novelty to\r\nbe innocent, yet charged with a thing; certainly one sees a look from\r\nthe world that could come no other way. I want to see you again--soon.\r\nI’ve got a story to tell you. It was a big thing to me. We used to have\r\nthings in common. I’d like to tell you the story and see how it strikes\r\nyou----”\r\n\r\n“Good. I’m to spare----”\r\n\r\n“Suppose you come here to lunch to-morrow----”\r\n\r\n“No, you come with me.”\r\n\r\n“I’d prefer it the other way,” Bellair declared. “It’s my story you are\r\nto listen to.”\r\n\r\nAs they parted, there was just a trace of the old Broadwell, that left\r\nBellair with a feeling of kindness.\r\n\r\n“I’m interested to hear that story,” the advertising-man said. “It did\r\nsomething to you apparently. Pulled you down a lot--but that’s not all.\r\nI can’t make it out exactly--but you’ve got something, Bellair.”\r\n\r\nThat was a long afternoon.... He had been gone less than six months;\r\nand yet was as much a stranger, as a young man coming in from the West\r\nfor the first time. The hours dragged. The City did not awe him, but\r\nso much of it struck him in places tender. He could give and give;\r\nthere seemed no other way, no other thing to do. He sat on a bench in\r\nUnion Square, and talked with an old man who needed money so badly\r\nthat Bellair reflected for some time the best way to bestow it without\r\nshock. The old fellow looked so near gone, that one feared his heart\r\nwould break under any undue pressure of excitement.\r\n\r\nBellair concluded he had better buy a stimulant first of all, so he\r\nled the way across the Square to Kiltie’s. They lined up against the\r\nbar, and warmed themselves, the idea in Bellair’s mind being to give\r\nsomething beside money. Now the old man (not in the least understanding\r\nmore than it was the whim of the stranger to do something for him),\r\nwas so intent on what was to be done that he could not listen. Bellair\r\nhad to come to the point. They went to a table for a bite of lunch, and\r\nthe spectacle of a beggar’s mind opened--a story lacking imagination\r\nand told with the pitiful endeavour to fit into what was imagined to be\r\nthe particular weakness of this listener.\r\n\r\nFor months, Bellair had not touched the little orbit of the trodden\r\nlives. The story was not true, for no single group of ten words hinged\r\nupon what had been said, or folded into the next statement. The old\r\nman was not simple, but his guile was simple, and the simplicity of\r\nthat was obscene. Begging might be a fine art, but men chose or fell\r\ninto their work without thought of making an art of it. The old man did\r\nnot know his own tremendous drama. Had he dared plainly to be true, he\r\nwould have captivated the world with his own poor faculties. Behind the\r\naffectations were glimpses of great realities--if only the fallen mind\r\ncould accept his days and tell them as they came--just the imperishable\r\nfruits of his days. As it was, the whiskey swept them farther away,\r\nand the creature attempted to act; his pitiful conception of effects\r\nwere called into being. The throb of it all was the way the world was\r\nbrought back to Bellair. His whole past city life thronged into mind.\r\nThis was but a shocking example of myriads of lives--trying to be what\r\ntheir undeveloped senses prompted for the moment, rather than to be\r\nthemselves. This was the salesman’s voice and manner, he had seen in\r\nBroadwell.... He stopped his revery by handing over the present.\r\n\r\nThe old man’s eyes were wild now with hope and anguish to get away;\r\na mingling of fear, too, lest the great sum of money in one piece be\r\ncounterfeit; lest the stranger ask it back, or some one knock him down\r\nand take it away.\r\n\r\n“I sat in a small boat,” Bellair was saying, “for ten days, with very\r\nlittle food and water. I saw one man die like a beast of thirst--or\r\nfear of thirst; and I saw another man master it--so that he died\r\nsmiling--as only a man can die----”\r\n\r\nBellair did not finish. He had tried to catch the old man’s attention\r\nwith this--to hold it an instant, thinking that some word would get\r\nhome, something of the immortal facts in his heart, something greater\r\nthan cash ... but the old man believed him insane, a liar, a fool or\r\nall three.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” he said, looking to the side, and to the door.\r\n\r\nSo he could listen, neither before nor afterward. Bellair eased his\r\nagony by letting him go--the money gripped in his hands, his limbs\r\nhastening, eyes darting to the right and left, as he sped through the\r\nswinging door.... For several moments, Bellair sat in the sorrow of\r\nit--lost in the grimmest of all tragedies--that here we are, a human\r\nfamily, all designed for lofty and majestic ends, yet having lost\r\nthe power to articulate to each other. Suddenly Bellair remembered\r\nthat the old face had looked into his for a swift second, when he was\r\nreleased--shaken, ashen, a murmur of something like “God thank you,”\r\non the trembling lips. There was a bit of a ray in that.... Then\r\nhe settled back into the tragedy again. It was this--that the old\r\nman had thought him insane for trying to help him; that he had seen\r\nsomething foreign and altogether amiss in the landlady’s eyes, in Ben\r\nBroadwell’s, and what was more touching to him, in Davy Acton’s.\r\n\r\nBellair straightened his shoulders. The misery of the thing oppressed\r\nhim until he brought it to the laugh. Formerly he would have tried to\r\nescape. It was not his business if the old man would not be helped; he\r\nhad tried. If a man can succeed in radiating good feelings and a spirit\r\nof helpfulness, he has done his part; the consequences are out of his\r\nhand. He saw that he had wanted to help; that what he had taken from\r\nthe open boat and from the woman had brought this impulse to the fore\r\nin all his thinking. After that he must be an artist in the work; must\r\nbecome consummate; but having done his best--he must not spend energy\r\nin moods and personal depressions.... As for Lot & Company, he must\r\nmeet them on their own footings--forgetting everything but their points\r\nof view. It was his business now to make a black spot clean, and it\r\nwas an ugly material matter to be coped with as such, calling forth\r\nwill-power and acumen of a world kind. He would see if he was to fail.\r\n\r\nBellair’s laugh was hard at first, from the tensity of the temptation\r\nto give up and let New York have its way in his case. Having whipped\r\nthat (and it was a fair afternoon’s work) the smile softened a little,\r\nand he entered upon the task of the evening.\r\n\r\n... Brandt’s was just as he had left it. The crowd increased; the\r\nquartette came. Bessie was lovely as ever; slightly different, since\r\nhe had thought of her so much in the old hat. She did not see him,\r\nbut her smile was like a flower of warmth and culture. A touch of the\r\nold excitement mounted in his breast, as they sang.... This was New\r\nYork--among men--food and drink and warmth. This, too, was life; these\r\nwere men who toil every day, who cannot take months to dream in, who\r\ncannot cross the sea and observe heroes and saints, but men who crowd\r\nand toil and fight, even expire, for their pleasures--such were the\r\nsurgings of Bellair’s brain in the midst of the music. Bessie was the\r\narch of it all--the arch of the old home, New York,--not this Bessie,\r\nbut the Bessie that might be, the significant woman it was his work to\r\nmake and mould. He was living his own thoughts, as much as listening.\r\nThey vanished when the music stopped.... He sent a waiter to her with\r\nthis written on a blank card:\r\n\r\n“Will you sing _Maying_ for an old friend?”\r\n\r\n... The song choked the wanderer, and this was the new mystery of\r\n_Maying_--that it left him at the stone gate of a door-yard beyond\r\nwindy Auckland....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe sent forward a gift of flowers, and was in a daze when she came to\r\nhim and sat down.\r\n\r\n“I have only a few minutes. We sing once more and then go. How dark and\r\nthin you look!”\r\n\r\nHe wanted to see her after her work was done, but dared not ask until\r\nother things were said.... There were words that left no impress, until\r\nhe heard himself saying:\r\n\r\n“I read the New York papers at sea----”\r\n\r\n“... The reporters came to me. I had told some one of seeing you. It\r\nwas just after I had read the news. It was new to me to have reporters\r\ncome--and somehow they got what they wanted----”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that didn’t matter. Only it was all unnecessary. My accounts there\r\nwere never other than straight.”\r\n\r\nShe said she was glad. He saw she was more glad to drop the subject,\r\nand didn’t exactly believe him.\r\n\r\n“And you’ve had luck away?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, in several ways--beside money.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed necessary to add the last. He was struck with the shame and\r\npity of it; yet it had to do with seeing her again.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to be in New York long?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know. I’d like to talk with you to-night, after you are\r\nthrough. I might know better then--how long I am to stay.... Is it\r\npossible?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--yes, I think so.”\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“After the _Castle_”\r\n\r\n“Thank you.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to be given a chance--in two weeks--a real chance,” she\r\ndeclared. “I’ll tell you later.”\r\n\r\nHe tried to make himself believe that it was just as it had been; that\r\nBessie was the same, the meaning of New York and the fortune that had\r\ncome to him. How could she sing so, if it were not true?\r\n\r\n“The formal try-out is two weeks from to-day,” she added. “The rest\r\nis done. It’s the chance for life--one of the leads with the _King\r\nFollies_ for next season. They’ve already heard me. I need to do no\r\nmore, than has been done?”\r\n\r\n“Just singing?”\r\n\r\n“There are many lines and some dancing--oh, it’s a chance to storm the\r\npiece--if I can.”\r\n\r\nShe enlarged and detailed the promise; Bellair forgot many things he\r\nhad to say.\r\n\r\n“Is that all you want, Bessie?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“This chance.”\r\n\r\nHer brows knit with irritation. It was her high tide, and he did not\r\nseem able to rise with it. Still she dared not be angry with him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you see--it’s everything?”\r\n\r\n“A good salary, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes----”\r\n\r\n“And you are all fixed for it?”\r\n\r\n“All but clothes--the old struggle. You helped me wonderfully before.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I could help you again?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, could you?” She was joyousness aflame--her whole nature winging\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nDeep within, he was empty and bleak and cold. He wanted to give her\r\nmoney, but somehow could not make it easy for her. It cheapened him in\r\nhis own eyes.... He was silent--his thoughts having crossed the world.\r\nThere is no one to explain the sentence that ran through his mind, “...\r\n_who buys wine for the Japanese girls in Dunedin, since Norcross was\r\nconscripted in the service we all shall know?_”\r\n\r\n“... But what am I to do for you,” he heard the girl inquire, “since\r\nyou are--not going away to-night?”\r\n\r\nHe quaked at the old recall. Perhaps he had forgotten a little how to\r\nbe sharp and city-wise; at least, he did not make himself clear at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“You have your mornings, don’t you, Bessie?”\r\n\r\n“Not if I’m to have new clothes. That’s morning work----”\r\n\r\n“There’s so much to say. I’ve thought about you in a lot of strange\r\nplaces----”\r\n\r\nShe leaned forward and said with a pitiful quiet, “Once, you only\r\nwanted me to be good.”\r\n\r\nThen it dawned on him. “Good God, Bessie,” he cried, “I don’t want you\r\nto be bad!”\r\n\r\nShe regarded him, playing with the stem of her glass, as of old time. A\r\ncurious being he was to her, and quite inexplicable.\r\n\r\n“You love me?” she asked.\r\n\r\nThe bass now beckoned, and she fled.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nBellair saw that one may have a gift from heaven, a superb\r\nsinging-voice, for instance, but that one must also furnish the thought\r\nbehind it. It was not that Bessie Brealt lacked ambition; in fact,\r\nshe had plenty of that, but it was the sort that cannot wait for real\r\nresults. She did not see the great singer; she had not a thought to\r\ngive with her song. She had not the emotions upon which a great organ\r\nof inspiration might be built with the years. Already she was touched\r\nwith the world; the world stirred her desires; matters of first\r\nimportance in her mind were the things she wanted.\r\n\r\nShe was not different from the thousands, from the millions, in this.\r\nHe had not altogether lost the conviction that she might be made\r\ndifferent. Already she was singing too much; her voice would never\r\nreach its full measure under these conditions. She would suffer the\r\nfate of the countless high-bred colts that are ruined by being raced\r\ntoo young, being denied the right to sound maturity. She should have\r\nbeen out of the life-struggle for years yet; in the country, in the\r\nperfect convent of natural life. She had not answered the true call,\r\nbut meanwhile a call had come; its poison had entered. Bellair saw that\r\nthe process before him, if any, was to break before building.... If\r\nconsummate art were used, might not Bessie be helped to conceive the\r\ngreat career? Of course that thought must come first. However, he was\r\nfar from believing that any art of his could be consummate.... Speaking\r\nthat night of her new opportunity, he said:\r\n\r\n“They will rehearse you a great deal--then performances twice a\r\nday--and you’re not more than twenty----”\r\n\r\n“Just twenty----”\r\n\r\n“You should be forty--before giving your voice so much work----”\r\n\r\nShe laughed. “Forty, I will doubtless be finished. Forty, and before,\r\nthe fat comes----”\r\n\r\n“People can forget fat--when a great voice is singing----”\r\n\r\n“The great voices have sung from children,” she answered.\r\n\r\nHe believed this untrue; at least, he believed that with conservation,\r\na more sumptuous power was attainable. “They have sung naturally\r\nperhaps, but not professionally. If they were called into the stress\r\nof life very young, any greatness afterward was in spite of the early\r\nstruggle, not because of it. The voice is an organ that wears out. It\r\nis not the same as the character which improves through every test. If\r\nyou were to spend ten years in study--ten years, not alone in vocal\r\nculture, but in life preparation and the culture of happiness----”\r\n\r\n“I suppose you would have me give up this chance with the _Follies_?”\r\nshe asked with the control that suggests imminent fracture.\r\n\r\n“Yes. There is nothing that passes so quickly--as the voice of a\r\nseason. It is the plaything of a people without memory. If you had\r\never listened to the best of the light opera singers, in contrast to a\r\nreally developed talent----”\r\n\r\nBut this was not the way. Bellair finished the sentence vaguely, not\r\nwith the sharpness of the idea that had come to him. She was nervous\r\nand irritable and tired. She was enduring him, much as one endures a\r\nbrother from the country, for whom allowances must be made; also there\r\nwas a deeper reason.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps what I think of you,” he said, stirring to thrill her some way\r\nif possible, “is really a fiery thing, Bessie. I think of you singing\r\ngreat hordes of creatures into unity of idea that would lift them from\r\nbeasts into men. The world is so full of sorrow and dulness of seeing;\r\nthe world is in a cloud--I want you to sing the clouds away. If you\r\ncould wait--just wait, as one holding a sure and perfect gift--until\r\nthe real call comes to you, and then sing, knowing your part, not\r\nin pleasure and amusement, but in life, in the stirring centres of\r\nstruggle and strife. If you would go forth singing that great song\r\nof yours--from your soul! It would be like a voice from the East--to\r\nbring the tatters of humanity together. I felt all this vaguely when I\r\nfirst heard you--six months ago. I have thought of it nights and days\r\non the ocean--in times when we had to live on our thoughts, hold fast\r\nto them or go mad, for we had two days’ water for ten, and two days’\r\nfood for ten. Then I remembered how I came into Brandt’s, torn that\r\nnight, not knowing what to do--dull-eyed and covered with wrongs. You\r\nsang me free. For the minute you sang me out of all that. I could not\r\nhave freed myself perhaps--without that song. I know that there are\r\nthousands of men like me to be freed----”\r\n\r\nBellair felt on sure ground now. This was his particular manner and\r\nmessage--the finest and strangest thing about him--the fact that\r\nhad always appeared, making him different even from Fleury and the\r\nwoman,--the thought that he was average--and not more impressionable\r\nthan the multitudes. If they could be reached, they would make the big\r\nturn that he had been shoved into.\r\n\r\n“... Thousands just as I was that night, preyed upon by trade,\r\ndull-witted with the ways of trade, the smug, the bleak, the poisonous\r\ntricks of trade, born and bred--their real life softened and watered\r\nand wasted away ... thousands who could turn into men at the right\r\nsong, the right word. I always thought of you, Bessie--as one of the\r\ngreat helpers. If you can wait, the way will come. I will help you to\r\nwait. I came back to New York to help you----”\r\n\r\nShe picked up his glass and smelled it, her eyes twinkling. “Splendid,”\r\nshe said, “but are you quite sure you haven’t a stick in this\r\nginger-ale?”\r\n\r\nBellair leaned back. He hadn’t touched _it_ yet. Perhaps something\r\nwould come, better than words. It was not straight-going--this work\r\nthat he had dreamed; always a shock in bringing down dreams from Sinai;\r\nalways something deadly in meeting the empirical. He smiled. “Just\r\nginger-ale, Bessie, but you are a stimulant. You are more beautiful\r\nthan before. Not quite so girlish, but there is something new that is\r\nvery intense to me----”\r\n\r\nShe leaned toward him now, very eager.\r\n\r\n“I wondered what you would see. The difference was plain at once in\r\nyou.... Tell me what you see----”\r\n\r\n“Just between the fold of the eye and the point of the chin----” he\r\nanswered.... (Queerly now he imagined himself talking on the shore to\r\nthe little Gleam; it gave him just the touch that helped.) “--a little\r\nstraightening of the oval, and the little puff at the mouth-corners\r\ndrawn out. Why, Bessie, it’s just the vanishing child. And you are\r\ntaller. I’m almost afraid to speak--to try to put it into words, how\r\npretty you are----”\r\n\r\nShe was elate and puzzled, too. “Where did you get anything like that?”\r\nshe asked. “It’s what made me remember before. Always when you get\r\nthrough preaching--you pay for it----”\r\n\r\nIt was out before she thought--yet for once the exact unerring thing\r\nthat was in her mind.\r\n\r\nHe treasured it; saw that his appeal was certain this way; that he must\r\nbe of the world, and right glib to master her. The way of reality was\r\nslow; he must never fail to pay for preaching.... They laughed, and\r\nthe weariness went from her eyes. The bloom of her health was at its\r\nheight. Now as Bellair watched her, thinking of the world-ways, she\r\nsuddenly swept home to him--the old forbidden adventure of her, the\r\nmeaning of money and nights, her homelessness, the city, the song, the\r\nprice she would pay if he demanded it.\r\n\r\nThe thing was upon him before he realised. It had all been the new\r\nBellair until now. His body had lain as if in a vault of wax, its\r\nessential forces in suspension. Suddenly without warning, the wax\r\nhad melted away. He did not instantly give battle to the gust of\r\ndesire--met it eye-to-eye. Bellair felt his own will, and knew he\r\nwould use it presently. He was rather amazed at the power of the thing\r\nas it struck him, and the nature of it, so utterly detached from the\r\nredolence and effulgence he had known in the Stone House. This was\r\nnot the old Hunting Companion who had come with garlands; a minkish\r\naborigine, this, who had come empty-handed, whose hands were out to be\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of all that Stackhouse had left in wallets and sea-girt\r\narchipelagoes was in this sullen-eyed entity--in the _O_ formed of\r\nthirsting lips. Bellair tried to check it before it came--the thought\r\nthat this was peculiarly a New York manifestation, one destined to be\r\nBessie Brealt’s familiar in future years.... He did not have to use his\r\nwill. He lost himself in thinking of her plight.\r\n\r\n“... Please bring the coffee,” she was saying to the waiter, her hand\r\nlifted, as if she would touch his sleeve, the familiarity of one who\r\nhad sung here many nights. “Yes, he will have coffee. He is merely away\r\nsomewhere.... Yes, we will have it smoked with cognac--but here--do it\r\nhere. I like to see it burn....”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Miss Brealt----”\r\n\r\nThe lights had all come back to Bellair. He was miserable--the\r\nadventure palled. There had been no lift, nor tumultuous carrying away.\r\nThe quick change chilled him. Her words one by one had chilled him....\r\nAt least, he had demanded a madness to-night. Bessie did not have the\r\nwine of madness in her veins. This much had been accomplished. He could\r\nnot break training coldly.... And now he felt as if the day had drained\r\nhim to the heart, as if the day had come to an end, and he must rest.\r\n\r\nHe turned to her. “I found a little check-book for you to-day, but\r\nyou must go to the bank and give them your signature. It is made of\r\nleather, small enough for your purse almost. The bank-book is with it.\r\nYou will find a little account started.... And now I will call a cab\r\nfor you----”\r\n\r\n“But your coffee----” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, we will have that----”\r\n\r\nHe had to get away for a moment. His heart was desolate with hunger....\r\nThe smell of the kitchen made him think of the galley of a ship....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Oh, what can I do for you?” Bessie asked, when he returned.\r\n\r\n“It’s what you can do for yourself that interests me----”\r\n\r\n“But I must go with the _Follies_--if I win. It’s the career--the\r\nbeginning!”\r\n\r\n“If you must.”\r\n\r\n“And when shall I see you?”\r\n\r\n“Here to-morrow night--if you will.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said eagerly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   4\r\n\r\nOn the way to Lot & Company’s the next morning Bellair smiled at the\r\nsense of personal injustice which had returned to him. He held fast to\r\na sort of philosophical calm, but permitted his energy to be excited by\r\na peculiar blending of contempt and desire to wring the truth from Lot\r\n& Company at any price.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he stopped. Lot & Company was merely something to master. Lot\r\n& Company was but an organised bit of the world which he had met; all\r\nmen had their own organisations to face, to comprehend the vileness\r\nand illusion of, and then to get underfoot, neck and other vitals....\r\nBessie had helped him. There was something in that.... He felt the\r\nfighting readiness within him, and an added warning not to raise his\r\nvoice. He must deal with Lot & Company on the straight low plane of\r\nwhat-was-wanted. That was the single level of the firm’s understanding.\r\n\r\nDavy Acton smiled at him shyly--the first face after the pale\r\ntelephone-miss at the door. Davy was more at home in these halls and\r\nfloors than in the hotel dining-room. Bellair heard the jovial voice\r\nof Mr. Rawter behind his partition. From the distance, Broadwell\r\nglanced up and waved at him. Mr. Sproxley’s black eyes were fixed in\r\nhis direction from behind the grating of his cage. Mr. Sproxley came\r\nforward, greeted him and returned. Bellair had asked to see the elder\r\nMr. Wetherbee, but it appeared that Mr. Seth was not in.\r\n\r\n“I’ll speak with Mr. Nathan Lot,” said Bellair.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lot is occupied.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Jabez then.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez came forth presently.... He had been married in the interval,\r\naccording to Broadwell; the fact had touched the wide, limp mouth. A\r\nvery rich girl had joined pastures with Jabez; so that this coming\r\nforward was one of the richest young men in New York, representing\r\nthe fortune of his mother which the dreaming Nathan had put into\r\nworks; representing the fortune he had recently wedded with or without\r\ndreaming, and also the Lot & Company millions. Mr. Jabez also stood\r\nfor the modern note of the firm; he was designed to bring the old and\r\nprosperous conservatism an additional new and up-to-the-hour force of\r\nsuction.... Mr. Jabez smiled.\r\n\r\n“Hello, Bellair,” he said with a careless regard,--doubtless part of\r\nthe modern method, the laxity of new America which knows no caste. The\r\nthought had formed about him something to this effect: “What’s the use\r\nof me carrying it--you will not be able to forget you are talking to\r\nforty millions?”\r\n\r\n“Come in,” he added and Bellair followed.\r\n\r\nMr. Nathan was beyond the partition. The atmosphere of the dreamer had\r\nlooped over into the son’s sanctum.... Bellair began at the point of\r\nhis handing the letter, addressed to Mr. Nathan, to the station-porter\r\nat the last moment from the platform of the Savannah Pullman.\r\n\r\n“But mails don’t miscarry,” said Mr. Jabez, impatiently.\r\n\r\n“That’s a fact. Perhaps mine wasn’t mailed. Of course,” he added\r\nquietly, “you didn’t require that letter. You had my note of release in\r\nthe safe. They say at the Trust company that you collected the thousand\r\ndollars and interest within four days after I left.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose every employé who has a deposit of faith--should tie us up\r\nthat way?”\r\n\r\n“It would be well to find out what he has done--before calling in the\r\npolice.”\r\n\r\n“What do you want, Bellair?”\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez could hold his temper, when its display was an inconvenience.\r\n\r\n“I want a paper signed by you for Lot & Company, stating that you were\r\nin error when you charged me with absconding with company funds; that\r\nmy accounts were afterward found to be entirely correct.”\r\n\r\nJabez Lot surveyed him. There was some change which he did not\r\nunderstand. The paper asked for, was a mere matter of dictation, a\r\nthing that might be forced from the firm. He believed, however, that\r\nBellair wanted something else.\r\n\r\n“I think the wisest plan for us will be to turn your case over to our\r\nattorney,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Why?” Bellair asked. The full episode of the Nubian File and Mr.\r\nPrentidd passed through his mind.\r\n\r\n“You see these affairs are adjusted better out of the office----”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“As a matter of fact, Bellair,” Mr. Jabez said patiently, “Lot &\r\nCompany is eager to make amends for its mistake----”\r\n\r\nThere was a slow, quiet cough, the most natural and thoughtless sort of\r\ncough from the inner office. Bellair wondered if the modern method of\r\nMr. Jabez was wearing a bit upon the dreamer, or if he were really lost\r\nin some inscrutable departure of mind.\r\n\r\n“That would seem natural,” said he. “It would seem the direct, clear\r\nway. I am not boisterous; I threaten nothing.”\r\n\r\nBellair knew that this reminder of the Prentidd episode did not\r\nhelp his cause, but he wished nothing to be lost from the force he\r\npossessed. At the same time, he knew that it was the policy of Lot &\r\nCompany to give nothing unforced. He was interested.\r\n\r\n“We hadn’t thought of it, of course,” the future head now said, “but I\r\nhave no doubt that Lot & Company has something as good for you as your\r\nold place, if you----”\r\n\r\n“But I do not want a position,” said Bellair.\r\n\r\n“What is it you want--again?”\r\n\r\n“I want a paper, saying that I stole nothing, that Lot & Company was in\r\nerror in charging me with taking funds----”\r\n\r\n“A sort of explanation of our course?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly--a statement of your course, and that you incriminated me\r\nunjustly----” Bellair spoke with slow clearness.\r\n\r\n“I really believe you had better see Mr. Jackson.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because this is most unusual----”\r\n\r\nAnother cough was heard.\r\n\r\n“Unusual--to straighten out a wrong that has hurt a man?”\r\n\r\n“The way you ask it. Lot & Company is willing to take you back----”\r\n\r\n“But I do not want to come back. You say that Lot & Company is eager to\r\nmake amends----”\r\n\r\nDavy Acton came in, saying that Mr. Jabez was called to the advertising\r\ndepartment for a moment.... To Bellair this was like an interruption\r\nof an interesting story, but he did not wait long. The scene was merely\r\nshifted. He was in Mr. Nathan’s room. Mr. Rawter joined them and Mr.\r\nJabez returned directly. The latter reopened the conversation by\r\nrelating justly and patiently what Bellair asked.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why he shouldn’t have such a paper,” said Mr. Nathan,\r\nbrushing his fingers through his hair, as if to force his thoughts\r\ndown. He was not a whit older. The same identical dandruff was upon his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nMr. Rawter laughed jovially: “Don’t you see? That’s just it.\r\nIndividually, that is exactly the situation--but a big house--all its\r\nramifications affected--and who’s to be responsible for Lot & Company\r\nas a whole?”\r\n\r\n“It was Lot & Company that incriminated me,” said Bellair.\r\n\r\n“I told Mr. Bellair----” Mr. Jabez began.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Bellair had better come back to the House--that in itself is our\r\nacknowledgement,” interrupted his father. Evidently the son was not yet\r\nfinished in training.\r\n\r\nBellair turned to Mr. Jabez, who explained the point of Bellair’s\r\nunwillingness to return. There was silence at this, as if it were\r\nentirely incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n“Have you taken a position elsewhere in New York?” Mr. Nathan asked.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Are you going to?”\r\n\r\n“On that--I cannot be sure.”\r\n\r\nMr. Rawter now arose and came forward, placing his arm across Bellair’s\r\nshoulder. The latter winced, but not physically. For an instant it had\r\nfired and fogged him. “Bellair, my boy, on the face of it--this that\r\nyou ask would seem very simple,” he began. “I would ask it in your\r\ncase, but think of us. By misunderstanding, we let out the fact that\r\nyou had gone with funds not your own.... You were away. We looked for\r\nyou everywhere before this happened----”\r\n\r\n“You let it out,” said Bellair. “It is very simple. Call it in\r\nagain----”\r\n\r\n“It isn’t so simple.”\r\n\r\n“I might come back to work for you,” Bellair added, “and those who\r\nknew would say, ‘He hadn’t anything. Instead of locking him up, Lot &\r\nCompany took him back to work out what he had taken----’”\r\n\r\n“I might give you a personal letter, saying I was very sorry, that in\r\nthe bewilderment of the moment, we jumped at the conclusion that you\r\nwere identified with the missing funds----”\r\n\r\n“But the funds were not missing. You could not look into the vault-box\r\nwithout finding my letter.”\r\n\r\n“Our funds were not all in that box, Bellair.”\r\n\r\n“They would know by next morning, if I had broken into your bank----”\r\n\r\nMr. Nathan appeared to be gone from them, his eyes softened with\r\nvisions.\r\n\r\n“Write him the letter, Mr. Rawter----” suggested Mr. Jabez.\r\n\r\nIt struck Bellair like a hated odour--this tool for unclean work,\r\nRawter’s part in the establishment. He did not hasten now, though he\r\nknew they were waiting for his answer. The head of the sales resumed:\r\n\r\n“Yes, I will do this gladly--in fact, it would relieve my mind to do\r\nthis in the most cordial terms, but I would be interested first in\r\nlearning just what disposition of it was intended----”\r\n\r\n“It would be mine,” said Bellair. “Of course, I should use it as I\r\nthought fit.”\r\n\r\n“I was thinking--in adjusting the tone of the letter, the wording, you\r\nknow----”\r\n\r\n“Adjust the tone--the wording--to the facts--that would seem best. But\r\nI would not accept such a letter from you personally. It would have to\r\nbe written for Lot & Company----”\r\n\r\nMr. Nathan now showed signs of coming back.\r\n\r\n“Let us have a day to think it over, Bellair,” he said.\r\n\r\n“In that case--my part is finished. I have asked to be lifted out of\r\na shameful position. You acknowledge that I have this lift coming.”\r\nIt was at this point that an inspiration arrived. “All that there is\r\nleft, naturally and equitably, is for you to do your part. A man’s name\r\nis of more importance than a firm’s name, and in any event, no man nor\r\nfirm was ever hurt by squaring a crooked action.”\r\n\r\nMr. Nathan appeared to welcome the slight heat of this remark. It\r\nbrought the moment nearer in which hands might be washed and the\r\nattorney summoned. But Bellair was not heated, Mr. Rawter fumed a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean by a man’s name being more important than a firm’s\r\nname?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“A firm shares its responsibility. A man shoulders it alone.”\r\n\r\n“And what do you mean by your part being finished?”\r\n\r\n“I have worked in this office five years,” Bellair answered. “I never\r\nsaw nor heard of a man in my position, or in a similar position of\r\nasking something, who profited by allowing delay. I will put the matter\r\nout of mind if the letter is not furnished to-day. Of course, I expect\r\nto get it. In fact, I have the pressure to force the issue--although it\r\nseems trivial for me to mention it.”\r\n\r\nBellair had thought of Mr. Prentidd again. There was doubtless a case\r\nof some kind pending on the matter of the Nubian File. Mr. Prentidd was\r\nno man to stop. It would not have been settled within six months. Lot\r\n& Company knew of his knowledge of this affair. Bellair plunged:\r\n\r\n“In fact, there is a case against Lot & Company, to which I might add\r\na singular weight of testimony. As for my own, it would go to the same\r\ncounsel----”\r\n\r\nMr. Nathan ruffled his hair and the silent fall of grey white dust\r\nfollowed. Bellair felt pent. After so long a time at sea, it was hard\r\nfor him to breathe in this place. He wearied now of the game, although\r\nMr. Nathan was palpably down, present in the material plane.\r\n\r\n“Bellair,” said he, turning about in his chair, “the added pressure\r\nof a discredited employé doesn’t count for much as testimony in any\r\ncase----”\r\n\r\n“I realised at once the reason why you discredited me--to cripple for\r\nthe time being any knowledge I might care to use against you. However,\r\nyou have all granted that I am not discredited. The only item mentioned\r\nin the charge was the item covered by the Trust company. You would have\r\nto work with Mr. Sproxley to show a deficit in the books having to do\r\nwith my departure----”\r\n\r\n“Bellair,” said Mr. Nathan, “a poor man can never win a suit against a\r\nstrongly backed firm----”\r\n\r\n“That is unfortunately true,” said Bellair, “but I am not poor. I came\r\ninto an inheritance during the past six months. The fact is, I think\r\nI could spend as much money to buy justice as Lot & Company would be\r\nwilling to spend to prevent it.”\r\n\r\n“Bellair,” said Mr. Nathan, “you will find it impossible to move the\r\npress in your behalf against the firm of Lot & Company, with our\r\nadvertising contracts among the valuable ones in the city lists----”\r\n\r\nKnowledge now counted. “You do not advertise in the _Record_,” he\r\ndeclared. “I have often heard from the advertising department that\r\nthere is a rupture between this office and that paper, dating over a\r\nquarter of a century----”\r\n\r\nMr. Nathan touched a button for his stenographer. She lit upon the\r\nlittle chair beside him like a winged seed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“To all Parties interested: Mr. Bellair left our employ suddenly and\r\nwithout furnishing customary warning,” the president dictated. “Finding\r\na certain explanation in the vault, instead of a sum slightly over one\r\nthousand dollars belonging to this firm, we hastily assumed that his\r\nsudden departure was energised by the usual conditions. In fact, such\r\na suspicion was stated to the press by this firm. We have since found\r\nMr. Bellair’s accounts to be correct in every detail, and we furnish\r\nthis letter to express in part our concern for Mr. Bellair’s character\r\nwhich our hasty conclusion impinged upon. Mr. Bellair left a letter\r\nof explanation in the vault, but his action in leaving abruptly and\r\nwithout explanation forced us on the spur of the moment to discredit\r\nit. However, the statement of his letter proved true, and the money\r\ntaken by Mr. Bellair was the exact amount of his surety bond, with\r\nstipulated interest, and his salary to the hour of departure.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“You have heard it?” Mr. Nathan inquired.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it will do,” said Bellair.\r\n\r\nThe president nodded to his stenographer, who whisked out. “It will\r\nbe ready in a moment,” he said. “I will sign it for Lot & Company....\r\nBellair, are you sure you don’t want your old desk back?”\r\n\r\n“Quite sure,” said Bellair.\r\n\r\nMr. Jabez and Mr. Rawter had departed. Bellair glanced at his watch.\r\nIt was a moment past the hour of Mr. Broadwell’s leaving for luncheon.\r\nThe advertising-man, of course, was aware of his presence in the lower\r\noffice. Bellair stepped out, however, to make sure of his appointment.\r\nBroadwell, hat in hand, was engaged in talk with Mr. Jabez. Bellair\r\nreturned to the office of the president to wait for the stenographer.\r\nNot more than two minutes later, Davy Acton came in with this message:\r\n\r\n  “Mighty sorry to call luncheon off. Am hurrying to catch a train for\r\n  Philadelphia for the rest of the day. Will see you later.--Broadwell.”\r\n\r\n... Bellair folded this thoughtfully. The stenographer brought the\r\nletter with copy. The front draft was approved for signature, and\r\nBellair’s morning work accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn the hall he met Davy Acton, and followed a quick impulse.\r\n\r\n“Davy, lad, how soon will you be ready to go out to lunch?”\r\n\r\n“In about three minutes----”\r\n\r\n“I’ll wait for you. I’m going your way.”\r\n\r\nDavy’s customary exit was the side-door. Bellair waited there\r\naccordingly. The girls were coming down the iron stairway from the\r\nbindery. He stepped back in the shadow to let them pass. There were\r\nfigures and faces that clutched at his throat.... And then a story\r\nbegan, half way up the first flight, and came nearer and nearer, the\r\nvoice carrying easily to one who listened with emotion:\r\n\r\n“Did you know that Mr. Bellair was back?... Bellair, the absconding\r\nclerk--Mr. Sproxley’s assistant. Lot & Company has refused to\r\nprosecute. He will not be arrested.... And think of his nerve--asking\r\nhis old position back----”\r\n\r\n... They saw merely the back of a man, if they saw him at all. The talk\r\nwas not interrupted on the way to the street and beyond.... Bellair\r\ncame up with a start to find the boy at his side.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   5\r\n\r\nFor a square or two, Davy Acton walking beside him, Bellair did not\r\nspeak. He had needed that last bit. The morning would have blurred his\r\nhard-earned knowledge of Lot & Company and the world, without that\r\nmoment under the iron stairs. It was hard to take, but a man mustn’t\r\nforget such realities as this. He loses his grip on the world when he\r\nforgets. Happy to lose, of course, but the point of his effectiveness\r\nis gone when these rock-bottom actualities are forgotten.... He looked\r\ndown, Davy was hopping every third step to keep up. Bellair had\r\nquickened his pace to put the stench of the swamp farther behind him,\r\nbut it was still in his nostrils.... He laughed.\r\n\r\n“I was thinking, Davy, and the thoughts were like spurs. We’re in no\r\nhurry, really.”\r\n\r\nHe would not take the boy to a stately and formal dining-room for him\r\nto be embarrassed. Bellair felt that he had something very precious\r\nalong; a far graver solution than luncheon with Broadwell. They sat\r\ndown at a little table in the corner of one of the less crowded\r\nrestaurants. As they waited, Bellair said, drawing out the paper he had\r\nreceived from the dreaming Mr. Nathan:\r\n\r\n“I want you to see this first. In fact, I was particularly concerned\r\nabout getting it, just to show you. Davy, it hit me like a rock--the\r\nway you looked at me in the hotel yesterday. I couldn’t have that.\r\nWe’ve been too good friends----”\r\n\r\nDavy read the letter carefully, deep responsibility upon his\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n“Did you have trouble getting it?” he asked finally.\r\n\r\n“It took the forenoon, Davy. I found that they had not taken the\r\ntrouble to tell my old friends on the different floors that I was not a\r\nthief. What was worse for me, they let you think so----”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t believe it at first,” said Davy.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad of that.”\r\n\r\n“I said to Mr. Broadwell, that they’d find out differently and be\r\nsorry. They didn’t let us know when they found out----”\r\n\r\n“That’s why it was important for me to come back----”\r\n\r\n“But why did you go away like that?”\r\n\r\nThe boy’s mind dwelt in the fine sense of being treated as an equal.\r\nBellair felt called upon to be very explicit and fair:\r\n\r\n“I came to the time when I couldn’t live with myself any longer--and\r\nstay in the cage with Mr. Sproxley. I saw a ship in the harbour the\r\nSunday before--a sailing-ship,” he began, and then made a picture of\r\nit; also of his own hopelessness and what the years would mean, not\r\ntouching specific dishonesties, but suggesting the atmosphere which\r\nhad suddenly become poisonous to him. He did not forget that Davy had\r\nno other place, that he must keep a certain sense of loyalty, or be\r\ndestroyed in such conditions.\r\n\r\n“It would have taken two weeks to get clear in the ordinary way,” he\r\nadded. “My decision came the day of the squabble with Mr. Prentidd in\r\nthe office. I had to leave right then--was off for Savannah that very\r\nnight----”\r\n\r\n“And you found the ship there?” Davy asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“I beat her there a day and a half. Then we sailed for South America. I\r\nwant to tell you the whole story. This is not the place. Could you come\r\nup in my room after supper to-night?”\r\n\r\n“I think my mother will let me come----”\r\n\r\n“Tell me about your mother, Davy. Is she well? I remember I meant to\r\nmeet her some time.”\r\n\r\n“Yes--just the same. You know she works a little, too----”\r\n\r\n“Where?” Bellair asked absently.\r\n\r\nDavy swallowed, and before he spoke, the man saw with a queer thrill\r\nthat the boy hadn’t yet learned to lie.\r\n\r\n“Well, she goes out three days a week--to do the laundry work--for\r\npeople who have had her a long time.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I see.”\r\n\r\n“I’m hoping to get where she won’t have to.”\r\n\r\n“Of course.”\r\n\r\nThe dinner was brought. Bellair tried to make up for the place--in\r\nquantity. Neither spoke for the present. The man was hungry, too.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you told me that,” he said after a time, “glad you told me\r\njust that way.”\r\n\r\nDavy applied himself further. Manifestly here was a point that he need\r\nnot follow.\r\n\r\n“Davy, you’ll come through. You’re starting in the right hard way--the\r\nold-fashioned way. It won’t be so slow as you think----” He was\r\nreminded now of what Fleury had said about the little Gleam that first\r\nnight in the open boat.\r\n\r\n“Slow but sure at Lot & Company’s--if a fellow does his part and works\r\nhard----”\r\n\r\nDavy was being brought up in the usual way.\r\n\r\nBellair said: “I’m coming over to see you at your house some evening\r\nsoon--if I may.”\r\n\r\n“Sure.... It isn’t much of a house.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not so certain about that. Anyway, I want to come. We’ll talk\r\nabout it again this evening. You ask your mother when she’ll let me----”\r\n\r\n“You might come to-night---instead of me coming to the hotel----”\r\n\r\n“No, I want to talk with you alone.”\r\n\r\nDavy looked relieved.... He was on his way presently, and the town\r\nappeared better to Bellair that afternoon. At five he was in the\r\nhotel-lobby when a hand plucked his sleeve and he looked down into the\r\nwhitest, most terrified face, he had ever seen.\r\n\r\n“I’m fired!” was the intelligence that came up from it, and there was\r\nreproach, too.\r\n\r\n“Come on upstairs, but first take it from me that you’ll be glad of it,\r\nin ten minutes----”\r\n\r\nBellair had to furnish a swift, heroic antidote for that agony.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t been home, of course?” the man asked in the elevator.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Could we send a messenger to your mother--so she wouldn’t worry, and\r\nyou wouldn’t have to go home until after we talk?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“All right, I’ll see to that at once.”\r\n\r\nDavy wrote with trembling hands. The messenger was asked to bring an\r\nanswer from Mrs. Acton.\r\n\r\n“Now tell me,” said Bellair.\r\n\r\n“Old Mr. Seth was down when I got back. You know he only comes down for\r\nan hour or two now in the middle of the day. He called me to him, and\r\nasked where I had been to lunch. I said with you. That was all, until\r\nfour o’clock, when Mr. Eben came to me and asked if you had shown me\r\nanything--a letter from Lot & Company, for instance. I said yes. He\r\nwent away, and at half-past four, he called me again, handed me my\r\nweekly envelope, saying that they would not need me any longer. I came\r\nright here. It seemed, I couldn’t go home----”\r\n\r\n“Davy, lad, I’m glad I’m not broke, but if I were and couldn’t do a\r\nthing to make up--it would be a lucky day for you.”\r\n\r\nBellair ordered supper served in the room. They were free and alone.\r\nFaith returned to the boy, enough for the hour. Davy was consulted\r\ncarefully upon the details of the order, a subtle suggestion from\r\nBellair from time to time. Something of the long dinners on the _Jade_\r\nhad come to his mind in this rôle. He had learned much about food that\r\nvoyage, the profundity and emptiness of the subject. Bellair told his\r\nstory, making it very clear to Davy--this at first:\r\n\r\n“The office was doing to me just what it would do to you, Davy. It\r\nwas breaking me down. The floors of Lot & Company are filled with\r\nheart-broken men. They do not know it well; some of them could\r\nnever know, but there are secrets in the breasts of men there, that\r\nyou wouldn’t dream of. It is so all over New York. Trade makes it\r\nso--offices, the entire city, crowded with heart-broken men.... They\r\nsay first, ‘Why, every one is out for himself and the dollar--why\r\nnot I?’ You and I were taught so in our little schooling. Then Lot\r\n& Company taught us. They are old masters--generations of teachers.\r\nCramped and bleak, but loyal to the one verb--_get_. In all the Lot\r\nfamily, Davy, there is not a true life principle such as you brought\r\nto the office in the beginning. But if Lot & Company were unique--they\r\nwould be an interesting study. The city is crowded with such\r\nfirms--heart-breakers of men, the slow, daily, terrible grind; every\r\nmovement, every expression, a lie--until to those inside, the lie is\r\nreality--and the truth a forbidden and terrible stranger. Every man has\r\nhis Lot & Company.\r\n\r\n“Davy, I breathed a bit of open that Sunday--so that I could see, but\r\nthe next morning it closed about me again. It was Mr. Prentidd who\r\nhelped me out. They stole from him and lied to him. Face to face, eye\r\nto eye, old Seth Wetherbee, the Quaker, lied to him, taking hundreds\r\nof dollars in the lie--millionaires taking hundreds of dollars from\r\na poor inventor. I had the book of the London transaction before me,\r\nwhich showed the truth as they talked, and Mr. Sproxley came and took\r\nthe book from me, and shut it in the safe.... And then when I left,\r\nthey knew I had their secrets. You wondered why they called me a\r\nthief, when I was not. It was plain, Davy, to spoil anything I might\r\nsay about their methods. Instantly they discredited me, because I was\r\none of six or seven in the office who knew that they were thieves and\r\nliars. And why did they fire you to-day for lunching with me? Because\r\nthey were afraid of what I might have told you. And why did they\r\nsend Broadwell to Philadelphia when they knew he was to have lunch\r\nwith me? For fear of what I might tell Broadwell. Even now they will\r\nnot tell the different floors that I am exonerated.... But they are\r\nafraid, Davy--that’s their hell. That is their life--fear and the lie.\r\nImagine men standing straight up to heaven--spines lifted from the\r\nground, but going back to the ground--who knows but their souls already\r\nbelly-down?--because they break the hearts of men, and live with fear\r\nand the lie.”\r\n\r\nHe told of Fleury and Stackhouse and the Faraway Woman--of McArliss,\r\nof striking the reef, and day by day in the open boat.... Davy’s eyes\r\nbulged. The boy saw Stackhouse at one end and quiet manhood in the\r\nother. He sat with Bellair, whom he could understand, in the point\r\nof balance between these forces. Bellair told of the stars and the\r\nchild, and the distance from which they viewed the little things of\r\nthe world and the grand simplicity of God. He pictured the man Fleury\r\nhad become--the straight-seeing, the fearless, the ignited man, who\r\nmastered the lie in his heart and the animal in his abdomen--the man\r\nhe, Bellair, wanted to be, and wanted Davy to be.... The _Formahaut_\r\ncame, with Spika agleam to the northward, and Fleury died--the picture\r\nin his mind of a man, rising rather than falling.... Bellair told him\r\nof the first moment he heard the real voice of Fleury, as he stood\r\non the tilted deck of the _Jade_ in the dark, while he went back for\r\nwater.... “I’ll hold a place for you!”\r\n\r\n“A real man always says that, Davy. A real man will hold a place for\r\nyou. And I thought, as I saw Stackhouse die and remembered his life,\r\nthat he was the saddest and most terrible animal in human form. He\r\nwas a glutton and a coward, but mainly he broke his own heart and not\r\nothers. He was a slave to his stomach, but there was life, not creeping\r\ndeath, in his mind. I saw the pictures that moved there, low, vivid\r\npictures, animal dreams, but he was not a destroyer of children or a\r\nbreaker of the hearts of men. Low Nature was loose in him, but it was\r\nnot a predatory instinct alone. Having enough, he could give. He could\r\ngive fifty thousand dollars and a wallet full of valuable papers for\r\na bottle of whiskey--but the Lots and the Wetherbees would have died\r\nclutching their money. I learned Stackhouse, Davy--only to understand\r\nthat there is a depth below his. I think I should have taken you out\r\nsomehow--if they hadn’t let you go----”\r\n\r\nDavy asked questions, and the story came better and better. The thing\r\nthat held him especially was the last days in the open boat.\r\n\r\n“And did you really suffer less when you decided to make it a fast?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that was true in my case. Many have set out to fast ten days, and\r\ndone with as little as we did. Of course it was harrowing, because we\r\ndidn’t know when it would end; then the little baby was there, and the\r\nmother.”\r\n\r\n“And you think _he_ was really as happy as he said?”\r\n\r\n“Davy, lad, Fleury was a prince. He would have given you his shirt. He\r\nhad himself going so strong _for us_--that the fire of happiness ran\r\nthrough him. I’ll give you some books about that. It’s really a fact.\r\nYou can’t suffer pain, when you’ve got something really fine up your\r\nsleeve for another. Perhaps you’ve felt it at Christmas----”\r\n\r\n“You’re all out of yourself-like----”\r\n\r\n“That’s it,” said the man.\r\n\r\nMore words would have stuck in his throat. Davy got it--got something\r\nof it. Bellair had come to ask so little, that this seemed a great\r\ndeal.... He followed Davy down and into the street. It was still two\r\nhours before he was due at the _Castle_.\r\n\r\n“How long does it take to get to your house, Davy?”\r\n\r\n“About twenty-five minutes. It’s ’way down town.”\r\n\r\n“Suppose I should go home and meet your mother. I have the time----”\r\n\r\n“Yes, come with me. She will be watching.”\r\n\r\nThey passed a delicatessen-store, ripe cherries in the window, and a\r\ncounter full of provisions that would have been far more thrilling had\r\nthey not dined so well.\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose we might take home an armful of these things?” Bellair\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nDavy dissuaded weakly.... That clerk must have thought him mad, for\r\nBellair merely pointed to bottles and jars and baskets--until they were\r\nboth loaded. There was a kind of passion about it for the man. He hated\r\nto stop; in fact did not, until it occurred to him that this was not\r\nthe last night of the world, and that Davy doubtless required many more\r\nsubstantial matters, which would furnish a rapturous forenoon among the\r\nstores--to-morrow forenoon....\r\n\r\nThey sat in an almost empty downtown subway train, their bundles about\r\nthem, the stops called by the guard. They both hunched a little, when\r\nthe stop nearest Lot & Company’s was called, but did not speak. Farther\r\nand farther downtown--the last passengers leaving. It was the hour the\r\ncrowds move upward. Strange deep moments for Bellair--moments in which\r\nthis was more than Davy sitting beside him. This was Boy--Davy Acton\r\nbut the symbol of a great need.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   6\r\n\r\nA hurried walk to the east with their bundles to a quarter that Bellair\r\nhad not known before, past the great stretches of massive buildings\r\nwhich the day had abandoned, to a low and older sort that carried on a\r\nnight-life of their own, where children cried, halls were narrow, and\r\nthe warmth became heaviness.... A plump little woman who had not lost\r\nhope (she did not see the stranger at first because the boy filled her\r\neyes); a dark, second-floor hall, a little room with a lamp and a red\r\ntable-cloth; a door at either end, and opposite the door they entered,\r\none window.... How bewildered she was with the bundles, desiring to\r\nprepare something for them right away. Indeed, it would have helped her\r\nto be active in their behalf.... Bellair was smiling.\r\n\r\nDavy told part and Bellair part. Presently all was forgotten in the\r\npresence of the calamity that had befallen. It was slow to change her\r\nmind about Lot & Company. Davy had impressed upon her for two years\r\nthe lessons administered there. Not to be changed in a moment, this\r\nestimate--that before all poverty, before all need, and above all hope,\r\na place at Lot & Company’s was a permanent place, “if a fellow did his\r\npart”--that Lot & Company was an honest house. Davy told of the paper\r\nMr. Bellair had forced from them, and Bellair touched upon the life\r\nhe had led in those halls, just a little and with haste. To help him\r\nto speak authoritatively, he added that he would help Davy to another\r\nposition.... Then he looked around, and glanced at his watch. There was\r\na small anteroom which they occupied.... Bellair had asked about the\r\nother door. “An empty room,” Mrs. Acton told him.\r\n\r\nOf course it was for rent. On the spur of the moment, he declared\r\nhe would take it, asked her to rent it for him, insisting on paying\r\nin advance. He would come in the morning--have his things brought\r\nlater.... No, Davy was not to look for a position to-morrow. Davy must\r\ndevote himself to him to-morrow. He left them happily. The mother\r\ncalled after him in hopeless excitement that he had left enough to rent\r\nthe room all summer.\r\n\r\nHe did not show the Lot & Company paper to Bessie; in fact, he never\r\nshowed it but once, and that was to Davy Acton immediately after it\r\nwas obtained. He had thought of taking it across the street to show\r\nthe landlady, but perhaps that would merely have added to her living\r\nconfusion. It had been most important for Davy, but to reopen the\r\nsubject with Bessie, his manner might have touched an “I-told-you-so”\r\nindelicacy.... She was happy when he found her that night. Clothes\r\nin quantity were already begun--the next ten forenoons at the\r\ndressmakers’. She thanked him charmingly, studied him with a quizzical\r\nexpression that invariably haunted him afterward.\r\n\r\nBellair could never tell just what would do it, but occasionally\r\nthrough an hour’s chat, he would say something, just enough above her\r\ncomprehension to challenge her. Once opened, her faculties were not\r\nslow, but the life she had chosen, held her mind so consistently to its\r\ncommon level that the habit was formed. Mainly when he spoke above her,\r\nshe ceased to listen, ignored him; but when something he said just hit\r\nhome, she praised him with animation, as one would a sudden gleam of\r\nunexpected intelligence on the part of a child. It became one of his\r\nmost remarkable realisations that a man who has anything worth while to\r\nsay must come down to say it, just as certainly as he must go up to get\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe sense of adventure with her did not return this night, though she\r\nhad seemed to accept him differently from before; as if he belonged,\r\npart of her impediment mainly, but at moments of surpassing value, like\r\na machine that one packs a day for a half-hour’s work it may do. His\r\nmoney had purchased something.\r\n\r\nBellair sat in the dark of his room, feet on the window-sill, hat\r\nstill on, at two o’clock, his last night in the hotel where he never\r\nhad belonged. He was very tired and longed for sleep; and yet there\r\nwas a different longing for sleep than that which belonged to physical\r\nweariness. It had to do with his hunger for the Faraway Woman. This\r\nstartled him. What was that refreshing mystery afterward? Did he go\r\nto her in sleep--did she come? Why was it that the burden of parting\r\ninvariably increased through the long days? It had been so on the ship.\r\nIn the morning he could live; then the hours settled down, until it\r\nseemed he must leap back to her; the ship’s ever increasing distance at\r\ntimes literally twisting his faculties until he was dazed with pain.\r\n\r\nHe had not thought of this before. Why was it always when the pressure\r\nincreased and the ardour mounted--that he longed for sleep?... Nothing\r\ncame to his work-a-day brain from the nights. His dreams were of lesser\r\nmatters--and yet, something within pulled him to unconsciousness like\r\nthe rush of a tide. It gave him a sense of the vastness, a glimpse of\r\nthe inner beauty of life.\r\n\r\nFar below in the side-street a heavy, slow-trotting horse clattered\r\nby. The motors were more and more hushed, even the hell of Broadway\r\nsubdued. A different set of sounds came home to him, but he did not\r\ninterpret for the present; their activity playing upon deeps of their\r\nown--a bridge swung open between them and his exterior thoughts....\r\n\r\nSlowly all exterior matters slipped away--the mother and Davy and\r\nBessie. The bridge between the surface and the deeps swung to, and he\r\nheard the sounds that had been thrilling his real being all the time as\r\nhe sat by the window--the liner whistles that crossed Manhattan from\r\nthe harbour, the deep-sea bayings which seemed to be calling him home.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   7\r\n\r\nBellair must have rested well in a few hours, for he arose early,\r\nfeeling very fit in and out. For years the man he had seen in the\r\nglass when he was alone, had aroused little or no curiosity; a sort\r\nof customary forbearance rather. The fact is, he had not looked close\r\nfor years. This morning as he shaved, something new regarded him from\r\nthe face, still deeply dark from the open boat. He called it a glint,\r\nbut would have designated it as something that had to do with power in\r\nanother. It was fixed--something earned and delivered.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was something she had seen.\r\n\r\nThis animated him. It had come from Fleury and the fasting, but most of\r\nall from contemplating her face and her nature. Was it the arousing of\r\nhis own latent will? Was it because he was lifted above Lot & Company?\r\nWhat part of it had come from the anguish of separation? Truly a man\r\nmust build something if he manages to live against the quickened beat\r\nof a hungry heart.\r\n\r\nThe face was very thin, too. He had felt that so often as he used the\r\nmorning knife, but he saw it now. Thin and dark, and the boy gone\r\naltogether.... Bellair smiled. Lot & Company had tried to take the\r\nboy. Had they not failed, the man would never have come, but something\r\ncraven in the place of the boy, something tied to its own death, its\r\nsoul shielded from the light--a shield of coin-metals.\r\n\r\nHe shuddered, less at the narrowness of his own escape, than at New\r\nYork whose business came up to him now through the open windows.... The\r\nshaving had dragged. He was not accustomed to study his own face. The\r\nvery novelty of it had held him this time--and especially the thought\r\nof what she might have seen there. Suddenly he wanted something big to\r\ntake back to her--a manhood of mind and an integrity of soul--something\r\nto match that superb freedom she had wrung from the world. A thousand\r\ntimes the different parts of her story had returned to his mind, always\r\nfilling him with awe and wonder. She had come like one with a task, and\r\nset about it from a child, against all odds, putting all laws of men\r\nbeneath--as if the task had been arranged before she came. He knew that\r\nthe essence of this freedom was in the hearts of women everywhere, but\r\nshe had made it manifest, dared all suffering for it. And yet with all\r\nthe struggle behind her, the gentleness which he had come to know in\r\nher nature was one of the great revelations. It gave him a vision of\r\nthe potential beauty of humanity; it made him understand that one must\r\nbe powerful before one can be gentle; that one must master one’s self\r\nbefore one dare be free. All that he had was far too little to bring\r\nhome to her. This morning he felt that nothing short of the impossible\r\nwas worth going after.\r\n\r\nA little later as he was leaving the room, the telephone rang. The\r\noperator said that a gentleman wanted to see him. On the lower floor,\r\nBellair glanced into the eyes of a young man who wanted something;\r\n“glanced _into_” is somewhat inaccurate; rather his eyes glanced\r\nfrom the other’s, and took away a peculiar, indescribable interest.\r\nIt was the look of a colt he had seen, a glitter of wildness and\r\nirresponsibility in a face that was handsome but not at its best.\r\n\r\nBellair had seen something of the expression in the faces of young men\r\nwho had been fathered too much; those who had not met the masterful\r\ninfluence of denial, and had been allowed to lean too long. The face\r\nhad everything to charm and to express beauty and reality with, but the\r\ninner lines of it were not formed; the judgments lacking, the personal\r\nneeds too imperious. He had made the most of well-worn clothing, but\r\nappeared to feel keenly the poorness of it.\r\n\r\n“I came in here yesterday,” he said hastily. “It all happened because\r\nthe ledger was turned back. I glanced at it, as one will, and standing\r\nout from the page was ‘Auckland, N. Z.’ It was as if written in\r\ndifferent colour to me. I followed the line back to the name--and tried\r\nto see you yesterday afternoon and last night. You didn’t come in----”\r\n\r\n“You come from Auckland?” Bellair asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes----”\r\n\r\n“How long?”\r\n\r\n“It’s more than a year.... Small thing to meet a stranger on, but it\r\nwas all I had. Auckland is so far and so different--that when I saw\r\nit--it seemed there must be a chance----”\r\n\r\n“Of course. I know how it is,” said Bellair. “Do you want to get back?”\r\n\r\n“That isn’t it, exactly, though I haven’t anything here----”\r\n\r\n“Have you had breakfast?”\r\n\r\n“N-no.”\r\n\r\n“Come in with me and we’ll talk. I have a half-hour to spare.”\r\n\r\nBellair heard his voice and wondered at the coldness of it. He\r\nremembered afterward the covered billiard-tables at the far end of\r\nthe hall and the dimness of the hall’s length, as he led the way. His\r\nown custom was a pot of coffee and a bit of toast, but the other’s\r\npossible need of food had a singular authority over him, so he made out\r\nthat this was one of the main feeding features of his day.... But the\r\nother was intent upon certain things beside food. He had been unlucky.\r\nEverything that he had tried in the year of New York had failed him\r\nsomehow--little ventures, positions lost--and always some one was to\r\nblame, not this one who spoke and had suffered so. Bellair hearkened\r\nfor one note that would confine itself to the unfinished mouth and\r\nthe unstable character; one note that would suggest the possibility\r\nof a clue that the series of failures lay in his own shortcomings of\r\nstrength and quality, but the boy had not this suggestion in his heart.\r\n\r\n“Are you married?” Bellair asked.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nThere was an instant’s lull, and then was turned off another story of\r\nmisfortune:\r\n\r\n“... I didn’t want to marry her. I got her in trouble down in New\r\nZealand. Her father wanted me to marry her--was willing to pay for\r\nit--but a fellow can’t take a chance like that. We came up together\r\nwith the kid to New York, but everything broke bad for me----”\r\n\r\nThe voice went on, but Bellair lost his face. There was a\r\ngreenish-yellow light between their faces, at least, for Bellair’s\r\neyes, and the floor seemed shaken with heavy machinery. Bellair\r\nknew the burn of hate, and the thirst to kill--and then he was all\r\nuncentred, like a man badly wounded. He arose.\r\n\r\n“... The fact is, I don’t think she was quite _right_. None of them\r\nare----”\r\n\r\n“I won’t be able to hear any more of that just now,” Bellair said\r\nslowly. “I’m leaving this hotel to-day for other quarters. But\r\nto-morrow morning at ten, I shall be here and listen to what you want.\r\nPerhaps I can set you straight a bit--for the present, anyway. And\r\nthis--is so you won’t miss any meals in the meantime----”\r\n\r\nBellair handed him money.\r\n\r\n“Please excuse me,” he added. “And finish your breakfast----”\r\n\r\nHe called the waiter and signed the card. Then he turned as if to look\r\naround the room. He located the door by which they had entered, drew\r\nhis hands strangely across his eyes. Effusive gratefulness was seeking\r\nhis ears from the young man in the chair. Bellair lifted his hand as if\r\nto cut off the voice, and then started for the door, his step hastening.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   8\r\n\r\nIt was truly a tenement quarter in which Davy and his mother lived. The\r\nfact awed Bellair somewhat. Had he been a cripple in a wheeled-chair,\r\nconfined to one side of one block, he could have found a life’s\r\nwork.... Little faces that choked him everywhere. One might toss coins\r\nat their feet, but the futility of that was like a cry to God.\r\n\r\nDavy’s mother was making his room ready. By some chance it faced the\r\neast; between ten and noon, there was sunlight. Forty years ago it had\r\nbeen the kitchen of a second-floor apartment, doubtless respectable.\r\nOnly the scars of the kitchen fixtures remained, like organs gone back\r\nto a rudiment in swift involution. Water now was to be had in but one\r\nplace on each floor--in the hall, and the natives came there with their\r\npitchers and cans as tropical villagers, morning and evening to the\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nMrs. Acton had spared a bit of carpet, which looked as if it had been\r\nscrubbed; and just below the window the tip of a heaven-tree waved. It\r\nwas thin as his single bed, but even that growth seemed miraculously\r\nattained, as if the seed must have held all the nourishment. Bellair\r\nstared down through shadows and litter, and could discern no more than\r\na crack in the stone pavement, from which this leafy creature had come\r\nto him. Quite as miraculously it was, with the myriad children in the\r\nstreets and halls. Certainly this was a place to keep tender. Davy had\r\ngone forth on an errand.\r\n\r\n“What was he interested in especially when he was little?” Bellair\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Boats--boats,” said the mother.\r\n\r\nIt struck the man queerly that he had not noted this. Davy had devoured\r\nhis little list of sea stories, and had listened as no one else to the\r\nopen boat narrative, but the man fancied it just the love of adventure.\r\nBellair’s mother might have said the same thing.\r\n\r\n“Did he draw them, you mean?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and played with them. His father was a seaman, Mr. Bellair.”\r\n\r\nBellair’s father had not been a seaman, but there was little to that.\r\nThey were one in the initial proclivity. Perhaps if the truth were\r\nshaken down, there was something in this fact that had to do with their\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\n“Could I have breakfast and supper here with you?” he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe woman looked startled. “You see, I am away three days a week.”\r\n\r\nIt was Bellair’s idea to make this impossible, so he insisted:\r\n\r\n“My wants are simple. I might not be here always to supper--but, of\r\ncourse, I should want to pay for it. It would be pleasant--we three\r\ntogether--and no matter to me if supper were a bit late. You see, Mrs.\r\nActon, now that I’ve begun, I insist on having a home. I lived in one\r\nroom for five years, and that sort of thing is ended. A hotel is no\r\nbetter.”\r\n\r\nDavy returned and Bellair took him forth at once, impatient to continue\r\nthe adventure of the purchases, begun the night before. Hours passed.\r\nOnce Davy looked up to him in a mixture of awe and joy:\r\n\r\n“Why are you buying so many things for us, Mr. Bellair?”\r\n\r\n“Sit down,” the man answered.\r\n\r\nThey were in a retail clothier’s. The salesman drew back.\r\n\r\n“Davy,” said Bellair, “it’s the most natural thing. First I have the\r\nmoney and you have the needs. Second, we are friends----”\r\n\r\nBellair had felt many things hammering for utterance, but when he had\r\ncome thus far, he found that the whole ground was covered.... The boy\r\nhurried home, but Bellair was not ready. With all his affection for\r\nthe lad, he wanted to be alone. He had held himself to Davy’s needs\r\nfor hours; but through it all, the sentences--so brief and thoughtless\r\nacross the breakfast table--recurred smitingly. They hurt everything in\r\nhim and in an incredible fashion. He marvelled that he had been able\r\nto reply quietly. His face burned now, and he thought of the Faraway\r\nWoman--how gentle she had been, blaming nothing, holding no sense of\r\nbeing wronged. It was that which helped him now, though his heart was\r\nhot and aching.... One must have compassion for the world--one whose\r\nhome is the house of such a woman.\r\n\r\n“It must not hurt the Gleam,” he said half-aloud. This was the burden\r\nof all his effort. “The Gleam is hers. I must not let the thought of\r\nthis touch the Gleam--not even in my mind.”\r\n\r\nThe young man was stranded in New York. They met as arranged the\r\nnext morning. Many difficulties were related, and the perversities\r\nof outside influences and the actions of others. The great regret\r\nwas that at a certain time when he _had_ the money more than a year\r\nago, the young man had delayed for a day to purchase a certain little\r\ntobacconist’s shop on Seventh avenue. A friend of his had advised him\r\nagainst it, and plucked the fruit himself. This gave Bellair an idea.\r\n\r\nIn the next ten days, everything seemed waiting for the manager of\r\nthe _Follies_ to decide the case of Bessie Brealt. Davy was permitted\r\nto look for a new job, but Bellair made light of his unsuccess....\r\nHe did not look up Broadwell again, understanding clearly that the\r\nadvertising-man would endanger his position in calling on him. Bellair\r\nwas not ready to be responsible for such a loss to Broadwell. Employés\r\nof Lot & Company did not change easily.... He was frequently, but never\r\nlong with Bessie during these days. There were moments of disturbing\r\nsweetness, and moments that he struggled quickly to forget, as Nature\r\nsets about hastily to cover unseemly matters upon the ground.\r\n\r\nNow that the great event of her life had come, Bessie required much\r\nsleep, and cared for her beauty as never before. She already lived, for\r\nthe most part, in the actual substance of victory, as only the young\r\ndare to do; yet she lost none of her zeal in preparation.... Bellair\r\nheld to the original idea, though the means was not yet articulate. He\r\nwas sensitive enough to realise that a man may be impertinent, even\r\nwhen trying to help another.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous discovery in this interval was that the open boat events\r\nwhich had proved so salutary and constructive in his own case, did not\r\nappear to have a comparable effect upon others when he related them. He\r\nbegan to believe that he had not authority, and that he must somehow\r\ntry to gain authority by making good with men. He had his story to\r\ntell. He had seen the spirit and the flesh--beast and saint--watched\r\nthem die. All life and hope and meaning were caught and held, as he saw\r\nit, between the manner of the deaths of two men. This experience had\r\nchanged him--if not for the better--then he was insane.\r\n\r\nIt was hard for him to grasp, that the thing which had changed him\r\ncould not change others--even Bessie. Yet those who listened, except\r\nDavy and his mother, appeared to think that he was making much of an\r\nadventure for personal reasons. He tried to write his story, but felt\r\nthe bones of his skull as never before. He began, “I am a simple man,”\r\nbut deep guile might be construed to that.... “I want nothing,” he\r\nwrote, “but to make you see the half that I saw in the open boat,” and\r\nhe heard the world replying in his consciousness, “The open boat is on\r\nthis man Bellair’s nerves. It’s his mania. The sun or the thirst _did_\r\ntouch him a bit.”...\r\n\r\nHe became afraid to talk much even with Bessie, and New York boomed\r\nby, leaving him out--out.... He tried to lift the signs of misery on\r\nthe way to the home of Davy’s mother, and in the surrounding halls,\r\nbut the extent and terror of it dismayed him; and remarkably enough,\r\nalways this same answer came: that he must get himself and the South\r\nSea business in hand before a true beginning could be made here....\r\n\r\nIt wasn’t on Seventh avenue that he found a cigar store to suit his\r\npurpose in this interval, but the promise was certainly as good as\r\nthe old one. He put the New Zealand young man in charge, on a basis\r\ndesigned to challenge any one’s quality; and having done this in a\r\nbusinesslike fashion, Bellair made haste to escape. The sense was cool\r\nand abiding in his mind that in this case, as in Lot & Company’s, the\r\ncircle was complete. Still he retained the suspicion that the young man\r\ndid not believe him sane.\r\n\r\nHe followed the singer when she permitted, to dressmakers, rehearsals,\r\nquartette performances and meals; found other men following singers\r\nsimilarly, in all their byways of routine; he disliked them, disliked\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHe had not told her of his fortune, because he knew in his heart it\r\nwould change everything. He helped in many small ways, and allowed her\r\nto believe what she chose. She had never identified him with large\r\nthings, did not think the present arrangement could last, and made as\r\nmuch as possible of the convenience. They were together on the night\r\nbefore her try-out, though as usual it was but a matter of moments.\r\nBellair used most of them in silence. The tension of hurry always\r\nstopped his throat. He longed for one full day with her, a ramble\r\nwithout the clock; yet what would he do with it--he, who dared not go\r\nto the water-front alone--to whom the night whistling of steamers in\r\nthe harbour was like the call of the child of his heart?\r\n\r\n“You are at your best,” he said. “Your voice was never sweeter than\r\nto-night. You must go now and sleep. To-morrow, of course, you will\r\nwin, and when may I come?”\r\n\r\nHer face clouded. Perhaps because he said the opposite, the thought of\r\npossible defeat came now with a clearness which had not before appealed\r\nto her unpracticed imagination.\r\n\r\n“You may come to my room at twelve--no, at one. I shall go there at\r\nonce after the trial--and you shall be first.”\r\n\r\nIt pleased him, and since she did not seem inclined to leave just\r\nthen, Bellair found himself talking of the future. Perhaps he did not\r\nentirely cover his zeal to change a little her full-hearted giving of\r\nself to the foam. Bessie bore it. He had not spoken of the open boat,\r\nbut something he said was related to it in her mind.\r\n\r\n“To-morrow will settle everything,” she declared.... “And I don’t like\r\nthat other woman on the ship. She isn’t human. You think it amazing\r\nbecause she didn’t cry and scream. That isn’t everything.... She’d be\r\nlost and unheard of here in New York.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is probably true.”\r\n\r\n“It’s all right for people who don’t write or paint or sing--to talk\r\nabout real life and what’s right work in the world, but artists see it\r\ndifferently. Anyway, it’s the only job we’ve got.”\r\n\r\nBellair never forgot that, or rather what she had meant to say.\r\n\r\n“Singing is what drew me to you, Bessie. What I object to is what the\r\nworld tries to do with its singers, and that so many singers fall for\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“The world lets you more or less alone--until you make good. Plenty of\r\ntime after that to answer back.”\r\n\r\nShe yawned. It was as near reality as they had gotten, and Bellair, who\r\nasked so little, had a glimpse again of the loveliness he had first\r\ntaken to sea--even to the kiss at the last. She also granted him this:\r\n\r\n“You’ve been good to me. I couldn’t have done without you----”\r\n\r\nHe lay awake long. The house in which he lived was very silent, and it\r\npressed so close to the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   9\r\n\r\nShe was only partly dressed when he came early the next afternoon, but\r\nwas not long in letting him in. Before any words, he knew that she had\r\nwon. A man often has to readjust hastily after the night before. It was\r\nso with Bellair now. Her eyes were bright with emotions, but a certain\r\nhardness was shining there. It was an effort for her to think of him\r\nand be kind. He would have seen it all in another’s story.\r\n\r\nHis glance kept turning to her bare arm, upon which a hideous\r\nvaccination-scar was revealed. _They_ had not thought of her singing\r\nin those days.... She had never spoken of her house or her people. It\r\nwas enough that those days were finished. Bellair could understand\r\nthat. Her victory was all through her now, satisfying, completing her.\r\nShe did not love money for its own sake or she would have treated him\r\ndifferently. All her surplus energy, even her passion, was turned to\r\nthis open passage of her career. Having that, previous props could be\r\nkicked away; at least, Bellair felt this.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it’s all done. A month of solid rehearsal--then the road. I take\r\nthe second part, but I hope to come back in the first----”\r\n\r\n“You were at your best at the trial?”\r\n\r\n“After the first moment or two.... And no more Brandt’s or _Castle_--no\r\nmore with the other three--God, how sick I am of them--and of this\r\nroom!”\r\n\r\n“Will you lunch with me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--I have until three.”\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after one. She talked with animation about her work,\r\nher eyes held to a glistening future. She finished her dressing\r\nleisurely, with loving touches, abandoning herself completely to\r\nthe mirror as an old actress might, having conceded the essential\r\nimportance of attractions. She studied her face and figure as if she\r\nwere the maid to them. Bessie dressed for the world, not for herself,\r\ncertainly not for Bellair. Without, in the world--streets, restaurants,\r\ntheatres--there existed an abstraction which must be satisfied. She had\r\nnot yet entered upon that perilous adventure of dressing for the eyes\r\nof one man. She did not think of Bellair as she lifted her arms to her\r\nhair. On no other morning could she have been so far from the sense of\r\nhim in her room. Empires have fallen because a woman has lifted her\r\nnaked arms to her hair with a man in the room.\r\n\r\nAn older woman would have rewarded him for being there; an older woman\r\nnever would have put on her hat for the street without remembering her\r\nhumanity. There was something in Bessie that reserved the kiss for the\r\nlast. Possibly after the last song of the day, a kiss remained. She put\r\non the flowers he brought; even that did not remind her, nor the dress\r\nhe had bought for her--asking him if he approved, not that she cared,\r\nbut because she was turning before the glass with the thing upon her\r\nbody and mind. She would have asked a child the same.\r\n\r\nThey went to Beathe’s for luncheon, which was also Bessie’s breakfast.\r\nThere, it may have been that she was ready to forget herself, knowing\r\nit would keep for a little. In any event, she seemed to see Bellair\r\nas he ordered for her, as if recalling that he had made many things\r\nmove easily of late, and that it was pleasant to have these matters,\r\neven luncheons, conducted by another. Thinking of him, the voyage was\r\ninstantly associated:\r\n\r\n“I said last night that I didn’t like that woman,” she began. “I didn’t\r\nmean just that, of course. But a woman can see another woman better\r\nthan a man. There are women who keep their mouths shut and get great\r\nreputations for being wise and all that. They never associate with\r\nwomen. You’ll always find them with men, playing sister and helping and\r\nsaying little. Men get to think they’re the whole thing----”\r\n\r\n“I suppose there are,” said Bellair.\r\n\r\nHe wished she had not picked up this particular point again; and yet a\r\ncertain novelty about this impressed him now, and recurred many times\r\nafterward--that it was she who had broached the subject.\r\n\r\n“Do you think a man knows men better than a woman does?” he asked.\r\n\r\nBessie had not thought of it; she was not sure.\r\n\r\nNor was Bellair. “The fact is, it doesn’t greatly matter what women\r\nthink of women, and what men think of men--compared to what men and\r\nwomen think of each other,” he observed.\r\n\r\n“You say you didn’t know that other man at first--that preacher,” she\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n“That’s true. There had to be danger--I had to hear his voice in\r\ndanger.”\r\n\r\nBellair was lifted to his life-theme. He had never really told it in\r\none piece. He did not mean to now, but Fleury came clearly to mind. The\r\nfood was served and it was quiet behind the palms. If he could only say\r\nsomething for her heart. She seemed ready. Points of human interest\r\nwere crowding to mind--perhaps he could hold her with them.\r\n\r\n“... His every thought was for others,” he was saying. “I disliked him\r\nat first, but he was so kind and good-natured throughout that he could\r\nnot fail to impress me a bit, but I didn’t really see him before the\r\nnight of the wreck, when he arose to take things in hand. It was not\r\nnoise, nor voice, but a different force. He seemed to rise--so that the\r\nhuge Stackhouse was just a squealing pig before him. He had no fear.\r\nYou looked into his face and wanted to be near him, and to do what\r\nhe said. I caught his secret. A fool would. It was because he wasn’t\r\nthinking of himself. It seems, Bessie, as sure as you live--that the\r\nmore a man gives out in that pure way Fleury did for us all--the more\r\npower floods into him. It came to him in volumes. We all knew it--even\r\nStackhouse----\r\n\r\n“And this is what I’m getting at. _You’ve_ got the chance to use it.\r\nI can’t yet. I seem to be all clotted with what I want, but you can!\r\nYou did. You pulled me out of the crowd, not knowing me at all--made\r\nme come to you--changed me. You can _give_ with your singing--to\r\nhundreds--so that they will answer in their thoughts, and do things\r\nstrange to themselves at first. They’ll want to die for you--but\r\nthat isn’t the thing for you. You must want to sing for them--want\r\nto give them your soul all the time. Greater things will come to you\r\nthan this--this which makes you happy. All that the world could give\r\nyou--you will come to see--doesn’t matter--but what you can give the\r\nworld----”\r\n\r\nHe saw her falling away from his story. It crippled him. He did not\r\nthink he could fail so utterly.\r\n\r\n“But you _were_ a thief,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I--was what?”\r\n\r\n“You preach all the time, but you were a thief----”\r\n\r\nHe had heard aright. His hand reached for the wallet, that contained\r\nthe letter from Lot & Company, but fell from it again.\r\n\r\n“If you like,” he answered, “but I saw a beast die in the open\r\nboat--and saw a saint die----”\r\n\r\n“You preach--preach--preach!” she cried, and her own points of view\r\nreturned with greater intensity. “You’ve been kind--but, oh, you bore\r\nme so! You have been kind--but oh, don’t think you fail to make\r\none pay the price! You were sunstruck, or crazed--and you come back\r\npreaching. I’m sick of you--just in my highest day, after the months of\r\nstruggle--I hate you----”\r\n\r\nBellair heard a ship’s bell. It was dark about him--a cool, serene\r\ndark. The air fanned him softly and sweet; the place rocked--just for\r\nan instant, as if he were at sea.\r\n\r\n“I hate you when you preach,” she finished. Her voice was softer. He\r\nknew she was smiling, but did not look at her face. She had delivered\r\nhim. He was calm, and ineffably free, the circle finished.\r\n\r\n“_Oh, that we two were Maying_----” he muttered, his thoughts far down\r\nthe seas--remote and insular, serene and homing thoughts.\r\n\r\n“It takes two to sing that,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But, I’m so sick of that----”\r\n\r\n“You must have sung it many times,” he said.\r\n\r\nHe did not want to linger. A certain hush had come to her from him. It\r\nwas not yet three.... He seemed surprised to find it broad day in the\r\nstreet. She touched his sleeve, drawing him to the curb, away from the\r\ncrowds which astonished him. Clearly something was wrong with his head.\r\n\r\n“Bessie--before your salary begins--have you everything? Isn’t there\r\nsomething----?”\r\n\r\nShe smiled and hesitated. He rubbed his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I’m so glad I thought of it,” he said, drawing forth the brown wallet.\r\n\r\nHis gift bewildered her, but she did not ask him this time what he\r\nwanted. Instead she asked:\r\n\r\n“But where are you going?”\r\n\r\n“Why, Bessie, I’m going home.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART SEVEN\r\n\r\nTHE STONE HOUSE: II\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1\r\n\r\nTHE hard thing was to get Honolulu behind. The first seven days at\r\nsea was like a voyage to another planet. Bellair could lose himself\r\nin the universe, between the banging of the Chinese gongs that called\r\npassengers willingly, for the most part, to meals on the British ship\r\n_Suwarrow_.... They had crawled out of the harbour in the dusk, a\r\nsouthwest wind waiting at the gate, like an eager lover for a maiden to\r\nsteal forth. She was in his arms shamelessly, before the dusk closed,\r\nthe voices from the land hardly yet having died away. Bellair watched\r\ntheir meeting in the offing. The blusterer came head on; the _Suwarrow_\r\nveered coquettishly and started to run, knowing him the swifter and\r\nthe stronger, as all woman-things love to know. Presently he had her,\r\nand they made a night of it--the moon breaking out aghast from time\r\nto time, above black and flying garments of cloud. Bellair enjoyed the\r\ngame, the funnels smoking the upper decks straight forward. They were\r\nmaking a passage that night, in the southward lift of that lover.\r\n\r\nHe had found a little leaf of cigars in a German shop in Honolulu;\r\nthe same reminding him of Stackhouse. They were _Brills_, with a\r\nTrichinopoli flavour, a wrapping from the States, the main filler\r\ndoubtless from the Island plantations. The German had talked of them\r\nlong, playing with the clotty little fellows in his hands, for they\r\nwere moist enough, not easily to be broken. “You sink your teeth in\r\none of these after a good dinner,” he said, “and if you do not enjoy\r\ntobacco, it is because you have been smoking other plants. These are\r\nmade by a workman----”\r\n\r\nBellair smoked to the workman; also he smoked to Stackhouse. Something\r\nkindly had come over him for the Animal. Lot & Company had helped him\r\nto it.... Yes, he thought, the animal part is right enough. It is only\r\nwhen the human adult consciousness turns predatory that the earth is\r\nlaid waste and the stars are fogged.... These were but back-flips\r\nof Bellair’s mind. In the main he was held so furiously ahead, that\r\nbody and brain ached with the strain. As nearly as he could describe\r\nfrom the sensation, there was a carbon-stick upstanding between his\r\ndiaphragm and his throat. Every time he thought of Auckland, it turned\r\nhot.\r\n\r\n... He knew better where to begin now. The beginning was not in New\r\nYork. The wallet was heavy upon him; he must not waste it; nor allow\r\nit to waste itself through bad management. Auckland was a desirable\r\ncentre for the Stackhouse operations. He could travel forth from one\r\nagency to another. The fundamental ideas of trade, together with large\r\nknowledge of how trade should not be conducted, was his heritage from\r\nLot & Company. He would begin slowly and sincerely to work out his big\r\nproblems--holding the fruits loosely in his hands; ready to give them\r\nup to another, if that other should appear; contenting himself only\r\nwith the simplest things; preparing always to be poorer, instead of\r\nricher.... He would earn the right to be poor. The thought warmed him,\r\nsomething of the natural strength of youth about it.\r\n\r\nStanding out of the wind with an expensive cigar, a superb\r\ncourse-dinner finished less than an hour back, Bellair smiled at the\r\nease of poverty, welcoming all the details of clean, austere denial.\r\nYet he was not so far from it as would appear. He had always taken\r\nthese matters of luxury and satiety with tentative grasp; even the\r\ndinners of Stackhouse were but studies of life. His ideal was closely\r\nadjusted to the Faraway Woman’s in these things. One of the dearest of\r\nher sayings had to do with renting the two front rooms of the stone\r\ncottage. Yet now he hoped furiously that she had not yet done so.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts turned again out among the Islands. He would meet the\r\nagents of Stackhouse. They would be bewildered at first; they would\r\nthink he had come to peer and bite. He would lift and help and pass\r\non--making the circles again and again, gaining confidence, not saying\r\nmuch. No, the thing he had in mind had little to do with words.... What\r\na masonry among men--here and there one giving his best secretly.\r\n\r\n_No words about it._ Bellair halted and filled his lungs from the good\r\nbreeze. This thought had repeated itself like a certain bright pattern\r\nthrough all the weave of his conception. It had a familiar look, and\r\na prod that startled him now. The whole meaning of it rushed home, so\r\nthat he laughed.\r\n\r\nHe had reached in his own way, the exact point that Fleury had set out\r\nwith. He was determined to act. He had ceased to talk.... Just then\r\nlooking up from his laughing reverie, he saw a star. It was ahead, not\r\nhigh, very brilliant and golden. It had only escaped a moment between\r\nthe flying black figures of the night, but more brilliant for that. It\r\nwas vast and familiar--the meaning tried the throat and struck at his\r\nheart with strange suffering.... Yes, the _Suwarrow_ was lifting the\r\nsouthern stars. There could be no doubt. He had looked at that mighty\r\nsun too often from the open boat to mistake. Fleury had said if it were\r\nas near to earth as our sun, this little planet would be dried to a\r\ncinder in ten seconds. It was the great golden ball, _Canopus_.... A\r\nhand was placed softly in his. Bellair was startled. He had been far\r\naway, yet the gladness was instant, as he turned down to the face of\r\nDavy Acton.\r\n\r\n“She’s better,” the boy said. “I’ve been trying to get her to come up\r\non deck. She told me to ask you, if you thought it best.”\r\n\r\n“Sure, Davy--I’ll go with you to get her.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   2\r\n\r\nHe had seen very little of Mrs. Acton during the voyage. Sailing was\r\nnot her feat, but the lady was winsome after her fast. Bellair had\r\nfound her very brave, and there had not been such an opportunity to\r\ntell her so, as this night. He wanted enough light to see her face, and\r\nenough air to keep her above any qualm. They found a cane-table, on the\r\nlee-side, toward America, the light of a cabin passage upon it. Bellair\r\nordered an innocuous drink for Davy and himself, and whispered along a\r\npint of champagne, having heard it spoken well of as an antidote for\r\nthose emerging from the sickness of the sea.\r\n\r\n“... It’s a little charged, cidery sort of a drink--just made for\r\npeople convalescent from the first days out of ’Frisco,” he said.\r\n\r\nShe drank with serene confidence, and leaned back to regard the glass\r\nand the two.\r\n\r\n“It’s not unlike a wine I drank long ago,” she observed, and her eyes\r\nwarmed with the memory.\r\n\r\n“A wine?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Just so, but it’s no crutch for the poor, I should say, by the way it\r\ncomes----”\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the service-tub, which, unfortunately, was of silver.\r\n\r\n“They like to keep it cold,” Bellair suggested.\r\n\r\n“It would need ice to keep that cold,” she replied.\r\n\r\nThere was a lyrical lilt to her words that he had not known before; in\r\nfact he hadn’t quite known Mrs. Acton before. She was lifted from the\r\nstratum of the submerged. She had her hands, her health, and the days\r\nnow and ahead were novel in aspect. A little seasickness was nothing\r\nto one who had met the City, and for years prevented it from taking\r\nher boy. The heart for adventure was not dead within her.... In fact,\r\nBellair, surveying the little plump white creature in new black, with\r\na sparkle in her eye, her hand upon the thin stem of a glass, entered\r\nupon a pleasant passage.\r\n\r\n“You see, Mrs. Acton--I’ve been struck ever since we sailed by the\r\ncourage you showed in crossing the world like this, at the word from a\r\nstranger----”\r\n\r\n“Stranger,” she repeated.\r\n\r\n“I wanted you to take me up on that, but the fact is, you came at my\r\nword.”\r\n\r\n“’Twas not much I had to leave----”\r\n\r\n“I liked it better than the hotel.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Mr. Bellair, I never gave up the hope of travel--a bit of\r\ntravel before I passed? But I thought it would be alone from Davy----”\r\nHer eyes glistened.\r\n\r\nBellair was wondering if there were others in that tenement-house who\r\nhad kept a hope.\r\n\r\n“You know,” he said, “when I decided to ask you to come--because I was\r\nfar from finished with our lad--I anticipated that it would be somewhat\r\nof a struggle. I saw how hard it was for you at first--the night we\r\ntold you about his loss of a place----”\r\n\r\n“We were on the edge so long--the least bump ready to push us over,”\r\nshe murmured.\r\n\r\n“I made a little arrangement with the express company to furnish you\r\nwith a return ticket--you and Davy, or cheques to secure them, and\r\nenough beside to get you back to New York at any time----”\r\n\r\nHer eyes widened. She turned to her boy to see if he were in this great\r\nbusiness. Wonders had not ceased for him, since the first evening at\r\nthe hotel. Davy was intent upon her now, even more than upon his friend.\r\n\r\n“So I had it all fixed in your name. There’s an agency in Auckland--one\r\nin every city--so you can’t go broke. And no one can cash these things\r\nbut you--after you call and register your signature. You’ll find enough\r\nand to spare for your passage (though I hope you won’t use it for many\r\na year), and expenses for you and the boy----”\r\n\r\nThere were tears in her eyes. Bellair poured her wineglass full in the\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t need to do anything like that----”\r\n\r\n“That’s a point I am particularly proud of,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“I’ll put this away for you,” she said, taking the proffered envelope.\r\n\r\nThe face of dusty wax-work sped past his inner eyes.\r\n\r\n“It’s all one,” she added. “It’s easy for me to say this, having\r\nnothing but what you give me. Did you hear of the house where every one\r\nput what they had in a basket hanging from the ceiling?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he said.\r\n\r\n“’Twas mainly empty. The poor are great-hearted, and those who have\r\nnothing.... This, I’ll put in no basket, but the bank, and you’ll have\r\nit when you get through giving away the rest. I’ll trust in the Lord,\r\nsure, to take me home----”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t been very successful in giving away much,” he said. “That’s\r\nour problem down here among the Islands. Davy is to grow up and help\r\nme. You are to help us. There is another to help us.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Acton finished her glass. “Is it as much as that, then?”\r\n\r\nDavy was regarding her with fine pride in his eyes.\r\n\r\nBellair sent him to the cabin for a book that would be hard to find,\r\nand turned to the boy’s mother:\r\n\r\n“I’ve got something to say to you about Davy. I brought back a story\r\nand a fortune from my other trip down here. The story was more\r\nimportant by a whole lot. It changed everything for me. I thought I’d\r\nonly have to tell it, to change others. That didn’t work. But Davy\r\nlistened, and he wasn’t the same afterward.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t understand him at first. I used to think when he didn’t\r\nspeak, he was bored. I used to think I had to entertain him, buy him\r\nwith gifts. But I was wrong. He was thinking things out for himself all\r\nthe time. He was puzzled at first why any one cared to be good to him\r\nand be a friend to him--God, what a price the world must pay for making\r\nboys as strange to kindness as that.... But this is what I want to say.\r\nHe believed in me long ago in Lot & Company’s. I succeeded in making\r\nhim believe in me again. And because he believed in me, he believed in\r\nmy story, and when he heard that--he wasn’t the same afterward.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, boys are full of wonderful things, but the world has shut\r\nthe door on them. All we’ve got to do is to be patient and kind and\r\nkeep the door open, and we’ll have human heroes about us presently,\r\ninstead of wolves and foxes and parrots and apes.... I learned that\r\nfrom Davy Acton. After he accepted me, he got my story--and that showed\r\nme that my work is with boys, and that first I’ve got to make them\r\nbelieve in me. I’ve got to be the kind of a man to win that. We’ll all\r\npull together--you and Davy and that other and I.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to help Davy, and I’m going to help boys. They’re not set.\r\nThey change. They are open to dreams and ready for action. They can\r\nforget themselves long enough to listen. The world has treated them\r\nbadly; the world has been a stupid fool in bringing up its children.\r\nWhy, it’s half luck if we manage to amount to anything! I think I know\r\nnow how to do better. I’m going to try. Why, I’d spend five years and\r\nall I have to give one boy his big, deep chance of being as human as\r\nGod intended. I’ll help boys to find their work, show them how to be\r\nclean and fit and strong. I’ll show them that _getting_ is but an\r\nincident, and when carried too far becomes the crime and the hell of\r\nthe world.... He’s coming back--and he’s found the book, too. I must\r\nuse it----”\r\n\r\nHe had told his story in a kind of gust, and the little woman had\r\nlistened like a sensitive-plate, her eyes brimming, her son moving\r\nhigher and higher in a future that was safe and green and pure.... It\r\nhad come out at last for Bellair. He was happy, for he knew that this\r\nwhich had been born to-night, with the help of the mother’s listening,\r\nwas the right good thing--the thing that had come home from hard\r\nexperience to the heart of a simple man.\r\n\r\n“Davy,” he said, “I’ve got a suspicion that your mother could eat\r\nsomething. Call a steward, lad.”\r\n\r\nShe started and fumbled for her handkerchief.\r\n\r\n“Do you know--that is--I might try a bite, Mr. Bellair----”\r\n\r\nThe man was smiling. Davy returned and sat down wonderingly between\r\nthem. His mother kept her mouth covered, but her eyes were wells of joy.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know whether it’s that cider that needs keeping so cold,” she\r\nbegan steadily, “or this which Mr. Bellair has been saying, but the\r\ntruth is, Davy, I haven’t been so happy since a girl----”\r\n\r\n“A little lunch will fix that,” Bellair suggested absently.\r\n\r\n“If it will,” she returned, “tell the man that it’s nothing I wish for,\r\nthis night.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   3\r\n\r\nAuckland passengers were not to be landed until the morning, but the\r\n_Suwarrow_ sent one boat ashore that night. By some law unknown to the\r\noutsider, a few top bags of mail were discriminately favoured, and they\r\nwere in the boat. The second officer, with a handful of telegrams to\r\nbe filed; a travelling salesman called home from the States on account\r\nof family illness, also Bellair were in the boat. He had told Davy\r\nand his mother that he was going to prepare a place for them; that he\r\nwould be back on the deck of the _Suwarrow_ before nine in the morning.\r\nBecause the little landing party was out of routine, an hour or more\r\nwas required for Bellair to obtain release to the streets. It was now\r\nmidnight.\r\n\r\nThree months away, and there had been no word from the woman who had\r\nremained. In fact, no arrangement for writing had been agreed upon,\r\nexcept in case New York should hold him. He had never seen the writing\r\nof the Faraway Woman.... He believed with profound conviction that\r\nwithin an hour’s ride by trolley from the place in the street where\r\nhe moved so hastily now, there was a bluff, a stone cottage, a woman\r\nwaiting for him, and a child near her; that all was well with the two\r\nand the place. Yet he lived and moved now in a wearing, driving terror.\r\nAll his large and little moments of the past three months passed before\r\nhim like dancers on a flash-lit stage, some beautiful, some false and\r\nugly, but each calling his eyes, something of his own upon them.\r\n\r\nThe world had shown him well that man is not ready for joy when he\r\nfears, yet Bellair was afraid. Man deserves that which he complains of.\r\nStill, he was afraid. He was exultant, too. Cities might change and\r\nnations and laws, but not that woman’s heart. He did not believe she\r\ncould love him, but he knew of her fondness hoped for that again. She\r\nwas in a safe place--as any place in the world is safe. She was well,\r\nwith a health he had never known in another, and the child was flesh\r\nof her. Yet he feared, his heart too full to speak. He did not deserve\r\nher, but he hoped for the miracle, hoped that the driving laws of the\r\nhuman heart might be merciful, hoped for her fondness again.\r\n\r\nHe would stand before her at his worst--all weakness and commonness\r\nof the man, Bellair, open before her. Perhaps she would see his love\r\nbecause of that, but he would not be able to tell her. Never could he\r\nask for her. If it were made known, it would not be through words. It\r\ncould only come from him in a kind of delirium. _He_ must be carried\r\naway, a passion must take him out of self. Very far he seemed from\r\npassion; rather this was like a child in his heart, with gifts, deep\r\nand changeless, but inarticulate, as a child is. It had been long in\r\ncoming, quietly fulfilling itself, and this was the rising.\r\n\r\n... The last car was gone, but he found a carriage--an open carriage, a\r\nslow horse, a cool and starry night. The city was growing silent, the\r\nedges darkened. There were high trees, a homing touch about them after\r\nthe sea, and a glimpse of the harbour to the left. Bellair had not even\r\na bag with him. He would take off his hat for a way, and then put it\r\non again. Sometimes he would let his ungloved hand hang overside, as\r\none would do in a small boat. There was a leathery smell from the seat\r\nof the carriage, with a bit of stable flavour, that would get into a\r\nman’s clothes if he stayed long enough. It was dusty, too, something\r\nlike a tight room full of old leather-bound books.\r\n\r\nThe horse plumped along, a little lurch forward at every fourth beat.\r\nHunched and wrapped, the driver sat, and extraordinarily still--a man\r\nused to sitting, who gave himself utterly to it, a most spineless and\r\nsunken manner. Every little while he coughed, and every little while\r\nhe spat.... Once they passed a motor-car--two men and a girl laughing\r\nbetween them; then the interurban trolley going back--the car he had\r\nmissed. His heart thumped. It was the same car that he had known, the\r\nsame tracks, no upheaval of the earth here so far.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Bellair was rounding the Horn in the _Jade_; they struck\r\nrock or derelict, were lost for ages in an open boat; they came to\r\nAuckland and found a little stone house on the bluff, paused there....\r\n\r\nHe was away at sea again, from Auckland to ’Frisco, across the States,\r\nto _Brandt’s_, to _Pastern’s_, to Lot & Company’s and the tenements,\r\nto the _Castle_ and the Landlady’s House; then trains and the long\r\nsouthern sweep of the _Suwarrow_, down the great sea again to this\r\n... plumping along on the high, rocky shore. The brine came up to him,\r\nalmost as from the open boat. His eyes smarted, his throat was dry, and\r\nthe driver coughed.\r\n\r\nBellair had paper money in his hand. He meant to look at it under the\r\ncarriage-light, when he stepped forth near the Gate. He leaned forward\r\nand touched the great coat.\r\n\r\n“_Whoa_,” said the man, loud enough to rouse the seven sleepers, and\r\nthe horse came up with a teeter.\r\n\r\n“Don’t stop,” said Bellair. “It’s a little ahead yet. I’ll tell you\r\nwhen to stop.... Yes, let him walk----”\r\n\r\nNow, Bellair surveyed what he had said. He was like that, just about as\r\ncoherent as that. The _whoa_ had shaken him empty for the most part....\r\nHe would not know what to say to her. He would sit or stand like a fool\r\nand grin.... But she was great-hearted. She would help him.... Awe and\r\nsilence crept into him again.\r\n\r\n“Now, pull up----”\r\n\r\n“_Whoa_,” was the answer, shaking the trees.\r\n\r\n“There, that will do,” Bellair said tensely. He stepped out and passed\r\nover the money, forgetting to look at it. He was afraid the man would\r\nroar again.\r\n\r\nIt was nearer than he thought, but a step to the Gate; its latch lifted\r\nsoftly and he crossed the gravel, held by the voice of the rig turning\r\nbehind. It turned slowly as a ship in a small berth, and the voice\r\ncarried like the cackle of geese.... There was no light. He was on the\r\nstep. Something sweet was growing at the door.... Something brushed\r\nhim at his feet. He leaned down in the darkness, and touched the\r\ntabby-puss, knocked softly.\r\n\r\n“Yes----” came from within.\r\n\r\n“It is I, Bellair----”\r\n\r\nThe door was opened to absolute blackness. She was not in his arms.\r\nRather he was in her arms. She seemed to tower above him. Around was\r\nthe softness and fragrance of her arms and her breast.... Not the\r\ncottage--her arms made the home of man. She held him from her, left him\r\nstanding bewildered in the centre of the room. He heard her match, and\r\nher voice like a sigh, trailing to him almost like a spirit-thing:\r\n\r\n“Oh,--I--am--so--happy!”\r\n\r\nThe lamp was lit, but she left it in the alcove, came to him again, a\r\nshawl about her. Lights were playing upon his shut eye-lids, fulfilment\r\nin his arms that a man can only know when he has crossed the world to a\r\nwoman, not a maiden; a plenitude that a maiden cannot give.\r\n\r\nAnd now she brought the light, and looked into his face--her own\r\ngleaming behind it, full of rapture, the face of a love-woman, some\r\ninspired training of the centuries upon it, all the mystery and\r\ndelicacy for a man’s eyes that he can endure and live....\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\nHe could only look at her.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” more softly.\r\n\r\nAs if the thing had been left over in his mind, and required clearing\r\naway, he answered:\r\n\r\n“Are--are the rooms rented?”\r\n\r\nShe laughed, came closer than the light.\r\n\r\n“We are alone--only the child. I could not let any one come--the rooms\r\nseemed yours.... I thought you would come. It was time enough to change\r\nwhen I heard from you----”\r\n\r\n“The little Gleam----”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he is here.... Oh, did you know what it meant to us--when you\r\nwent away?”\r\n\r\n“I knew what it meant to me----”\r\n\r\n“After the open boat and the days together here--you knew all?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I thought it would be easier.... And you are changed! You are like a\r\nman who has found his Quest.”\r\n\r\nShe was about him like magic. They were moving toward the little room.\r\nShe stopped and put the lamp back in the alcove.\r\n\r\n“We will not take it in there. It would wake him.”\r\n\r\n... It was dark upon the threshold. She took his hand. He heard her\r\nheart beating, or was it his own?... They heard the little breathing.\r\nShe guided his hand to the warm little hand.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he is well,” she whispered. “Everything is perfect with your\r\ncoming.... There.... You hurried home to me, didn’t you?... Yes, I\r\nhoped. I felt the ship. I could not sleep. I wondered if I could be\r\nwrong.... Oh, to think of the dawn coming in--finding us here together\r\n... and the little Gleam....”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGray light was coming in. Her face was shadowed, but the gray was\r\nfaint about her hair. His heart had taken something perfect from her;\r\nsomething of the nature of that peace which had come to him at the\r\n_Jade’s_ rail crossing the Line, but greater than that, the fulfilment\r\nof that. Because it was perfect, it could not last in its fulness.\r\nThat was the coolness of the Hills, but his love was glowing now like\r\nnoon sunlight in a valley, the redolence of high sunlight in the river\r\nlowlands. Mother Earth had taken them again.\r\n\r\nIt was the tide of life; it was as she had told him it must be with\r\nher, akin to the loveliest processes of nature, like the gilding of a\r\ntea-rose, like the flight of swans. He watched her as the dawn rose, as\r\na woman is only to be seen in her own room; watched her without words,\r\nuntil from the concentration, that which had been bound floated free\r\nwithin him.... A sentence she had spoken (it may have been an hour, or\r\na moment ago) returned to his consciousness. “Oh, how I wanted you to\r\ncome home to-night!”\r\n\r\nHis mind was full of pictures and power. It may have been the\r\nstrangeness of the light, but his eyes could not hold her face, nor\r\nhis mind remember the face that had welcomed him in the lamplight.\r\nDifferent faces moved before his eyes, a deep likeness in the plan of\r\nthem, as pearls would be sorted and matched for one string, a wonderful\r\nsisterhood of faces, tenderness, fortitude, ardour, joy, renunciation.\r\nIt was like a stroke. He had loved them all--facets of one jewel. And\r\nwas the jewel her soul?\r\n\r\nHe arose, without turning from her, and moved to the far corner of the\r\nroom, where there was neither chair nor table. As he moved, he watched\r\nher with tireless thirsting eyes.\r\n\r\nShe arose and came to him, moving low.... This figure that came,\r\nthrilled him again with the old magic of the river-banks. He could not\r\npass the wonder of her crossing the room to follow him.... And now he\r\nsaw her lips in the light--a girl’s shyness about her lips. She was a\r\ngirl that instant--as if a veil had dropped behind her. It had never\r\nbeen so before--a woman always, wise and finished with years, compared\r\nto whom that other was a child. And yet she was little older than\r\nthat other--in years. He loved the shyness of her lips. It was like\r\none familiar bloom in the midst of exotic wonders. It seemed he would\r\nfall--before she touched him.\r\n\r\nShe was low in his arms, as if her knees were bent, as if she would\r\nmake herself less for her lord.... And something in that, even as he\r\nheld her, opened the long low roads of the past--glimpses from that\r\nsurging mystery behind us all--as if they had sinned and expiated and\r\naspired together.\r\n\r\n“... That you would come to me----” he whispered.\r\n\r\n“I have wanted to come to you so long.”\r\n\r\n“I thought--I could not tell you--I thought I would stand helpless\r\nwithout words before you. Why, everything I thought was wrong. I can\r\ntell you--but there is no need----”\r\n\r\n“There is little need of words between us.”\r\n\r\n... That which she wore upon her feet was heel-less, and all the cries\r\nand calls and warnings and distances of the world were gone from\r\nbetween them, as they stood together.... And once her arms left him and\r\nwere upheld, as if to receive a perfect gift. A woman could command\r\nheaven with that gesture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had reached the end of the forest, and found the dawn. The sounds\r\nof the world came back to them like an enchanter’s drone.\r\n\r\n“Come,” she said, taking his hand, “it is day. We must return to the\r\nvillage. And oh, to our little Gleam! He is awakening. He will speak\r\nyour name.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY WILL LEVINGTON COMFORT\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Brief Expression of the Critical Reception of_\r\n\r\nDOWN AMONG MEN\r\n\r\n\r\n_Outlook_: Possessed of a marvelous descriptive genius, equipped with\r\na remarkably flexible use of English and impelled by the passion of a\r\nmystic--the author of _Down Among Men_ has written a striking novel.\r\n\r\n_The Dial_: Seems to us the most exalted and appealing story Mr.\r\nComfort has thus far written.\r\n\r\n_The Argonaut_: A novel of extraordinary power. It is good as\r\n_Routledge Rides Alone_. It could hardly be better.\r\n\r\n_London Post_: Alive with incident, bounding with physical energy,\r\ndramatic in coloring, and modern in every phrase. He has a message\r\ndelivered with vigor, inspired with tense passion.\r\n\r\n_Atlantic Monthly_: There is so much real fire in it--the fire of youth\r\nthat has seen and suffered--so much vitality and passion that one grows\r\nchary of petty comments. The writer offers us the cup of life, and\r\nthere is blood in the cup.\r\n\r\n_Chicago Record-Herald_: An almost perfect tale of courage and\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n_Chicago Tribune_: Contains some of the most remarkable scenes that\r\nhave appeared in recent American fiction.\r\n\r\n_New York Times_: Few richer novels than this of Mr. Comfort’s have\r\nbeen published in many a long day.\r\n\r\n_New York Globe_: We can say in all sincerity that we know of no\r\nrecent bit of descriptive writing that can match this for sustained,\r\nbreathless, dramatic interest.\r\n\r\n_Springfield Republican_: _Down Among Men_ is perhaps the most\r\nambitious American novel that has come out during the past year.\r\n\r\n                          _12mo., Net $1.25._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDSTREAM\r\n\r\n... A hint from the first-year’s recognition of a book that was made to\r\nremain in American literature:\r\n\r\n_Boston Transcript_: If it be extravagance, let it be so, to say\r\nthat Comfort’s account of his childhood has seldom been rivaled in\r\nliterature. It amounts to revelation. Really the only parallels that\r\nwill suggest themselves in our letters are the great ones that occur\r\nin _Huckleberry Finn_.... This man Comfort’s gamut is long and he has\r\nraced its full length. One wonders whether the interest, the skill, the\r\ngeneral worth of it, the things it has to report of all life, as well\r\nas the one life, do not entitle _Midstream_ to the very long life that\r\nis enjoyed only by the very best of books.\r\n\r\n_San Francisco Argonaut_: Read the book. It is autobiography in its\r\nperfection. It shows more of the realities of the human being, more of\r\ngod and devil in conflict, than any book of its kind.\r\n\r\n_Springfield Republican_: It is difficult to think of any other young\r\nAmerican who has so courageously reversed the process of writing for\r\nthe “market” and so flatly insisted upon being taken, if at all, on\r\nhis own terms of life and art. And now comes his frank and amazing\r\nrevelation, _Midstream_, in which he captures and carries the reader on\r\nto a story of regeneration. He has come far; the question is, how much\r\nfarther will he go?\r\n\r\nMary Fanton Roberts in _The Craftsman_: Beside the stature of this\r\nbook, the ordinary novel and biography are curiously dwarfed. You\r\nread it with a poignant interest and close it with wonder, reverence\r\nand gratitude. There is something strangely touching about words so\r\ncandid, and a draught of philosophy that has been pressed from such\r\nwild and bitter-sweet fruit. The message it contains is one to sink\r\ndeep, penetrating and enriching whatever receptive soul it touches.\r\nThis man’s words are incandescent. Many of us feel that he is breathing\r\ninto a language, grown trite from hackneyed usage, the inspiration of a\r\nquickened life.\r\n\r\nIda Gilbert Myers in _Washington Star_: Courage backs this revelation.\r\nThe gift of self-searching animates it. Honesty sustains it. And Mr.\r\nComfort’s rare power to seize and deliver his vision inspires it. It\r\nis a tremendous thing--the greatest thing that this writer has yet done.\r\n\r\nGeorge Soule in _The Little Review_: Here is a man’s life laid\r\nabsolutely bare. A direct, big thing, so simple that almost no one\r\nhas done it before--this Mr. Comfort has dared. People who are made\r\nuncomfortable by intimate grasp of anything, to whom reserve is more\r\nimportant than truth--these will not read _Midstream_ through, but\r\nothers will emerge from the book with a sense of the absolute nobility\r\nof Mr. Comfort’s frankness.\r\n\r\nEdwin Markham in _Hearst’s Magazine_: Will Levington Comfort, a\r\nnovelist of distinction, has given us a book alive with human interest,\r\nwith passionate sincerity, and with all the power of his despotism over\r\nwords. He has been a wandering foot--familiar with many strands; he\r\nhas known shame and sorrow and striving; he has won to serene heights.\r\nHe tells it all without vaunt, relating his experience to the large\r\nmeanings of life for all men, to the mystic currents behind life, out\r\nof which we come, to whose great deep we return.\r\n\r\n                          _12mo., Net, $1.25_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED FLEECE\r\n\r\n_Springfield Republican_: The first genuine war novel.\r\n\r\n_Outlook_: The first novel of any real consequence dealing with the\r\ngreat war.\r\n\r\n_San Francisco Argonaut_: An extraordinary book. The reader of\r\nComfort’s book is carried away on a storm of emotion.\r\n\r\n_New York Tribune_: Decidedly the first notable novel of the great war\r\nis Will Levington Comfort’s _Red Fleece_. Comfort sees in the moujik’s\r\ndreamy soul the seed of a spiritual regeneration of the world.\r\n\r\n_The Dial_: As a stylist, Mr. Comfort has never done better work. “His\r\nclothing smelled of death; and one morning before the smoke fell, he\r\nwatched the sun shining upon the smoke-clad hills. That moment the\r\nthought held him that the pine-trees were immortal, and men just the\r\ndung of the earth.” It is not given to many men to write such English\r\nas that.\r\n\r\n_Boston Transcript_: This is a story written in wireless. It leaves a\r\nlightning impression.\r\n\r\n_New York Times_: This novel has one most unusual fault. It is not long\r\nenough.\r\n\r\n_Churchman_, New York: By far the most interesting and thoughtful book\r\nof fiction springing from the great war.\r\n\r\n                          _12mo., Net, $1.25_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\r\n\r\nOn page 123, side-ways has been changed to sideways.\r\n\r\nOn page 130, banknotes has been changed to bank-notes.\r\n\r\nOn page 310, waterfront has been changed to water-front.\r\n\r\nOn page 336, eyelids has been changed to eye-lids.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Fomalhaut\" was spelled multiple ways in this book; all have\r\nbeen regularized to \"Fomalhaut\" (a star in the Southern Hemisphere.)\r\n\r\nAll other spelling, hyphenation and dialect has been retained as\r\ntypeset.",
