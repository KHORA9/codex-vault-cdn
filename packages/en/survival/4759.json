We believe the rubber industry\r\nwill be better off if the future citizens of our country know more\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you were asked, \"What did Columbus discover in 1492?\" you would\r\nhave but one answer. But what he discovered on his second voyage\r\nis not quite so easy to say. He was looking for gold when he\r\nlanded on the island of Hayti on that second trip. So his eyes\r\nwere blind to the importance of a simple game which he saw being\r\nplayed with a ball that bounced by some half-naked Indian boys on\r\nthe sand between the palm trees and the sea. Instead of the\r\ncoveted gold, he took back to Europe, just as curiosities, some of\r\nthe strange black balls given him by these Indian boys. He learned\r\nthat the balls were made from the hardened juice of a tree.\r\n\r\nThe little boys and girls of Spain were used to playing with balls\r\nmade of rags or wool, so you may imagine how these bouncing balls\r\nof the Indians must have pleased them. But the men who sent out\r\nthis second expedition gave the balls little thought and certainly\r\nno value. Since Columbus brought back no gold, he was thrown into\r\nprison for debt, and he never imagined that, four hundred years\r\nlater, men would turn that strange, gummy tree juice into more\r\ngold than King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and all the princes of\r\nEurope ever dreamed of.\r\n\r\nIn the next century after Columbus's travels the Portuguese\r\nfounded the colony of Brazil on the continent of South America.\r\nTheir settlements were near the coast and they did not begin to\r\nexplore the great Amazon region for a hundred years or so. The\r\njourney down this great river--which Theodore Roosevelt took so\r\nmany years later--was first made by a Portuguese missionary, who\r\nfound the same kind of gummy tree juice as that of the West\r\nIndies. But the natives along the Amazon had discovered that\r\nbesides being elastic it was waterproof, and they were making\r\nshoes that would keep out water. You can picture a native boy\r\nspilling some of this liquid on his foot, then covering it, as he\r\nmight with a mud pie, and when it dried wiggling his toes to find\r\nthat, he had the first and perhaps the best fitting gum shoe that\r\never was made.\r\n\r\nLittle by little samples of this new substance found their way to\r\nEurope. It was another hundred years before thoughtful men\r\nbelieved it worth while to investigate this gum. In 1731 the Paris\r\nAcademy of Science sent some explorers to learn about it. One of\r\nthese Frenchmen, La Condamine, wrote of a tree called \"Hevea\"[1]\r\n\"There flows from this tree a liquor which hardens gradually and\r\nblackens in the air.\" He found the people of Quito waterproofing\r\ncloth with it, and the Amazon Indians were making boots which, when\r\nblackened in smoke, looked like leather. Most interesting of all,\r\nthey coated bottle-shaped moulds, and when the gum had hardened they\r\nwould break the mould, shaking the pieces out of the neck, leaving\r\nan unbreakable bottle that would hold liquids.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Hevea is pronounced Hee'-vee-uh. Caoutchouc is\r\npronounced koo'-chook.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not long afterwards that Lisbon began to import some of\r\nthese crudely fashioned articles, and it is said that in 1755 the\r\nKing of Portugal sent to Brazil several pairs of his boots to be\r\nwaterproofed. A few years later the Government of Para, Brazil,\r\nsent him a full suit of rubber clothes. For all that, this elastic\r\ngum was for the most part only a curiosity, and few people knew\r\nthere was such a thing.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1770, a black, bouncing ball of caoutchouc, as the\r\nIndians called the gum, after many travels found its way to\r\nEngland, and Priestley, the man who gave us oxygen, learned that\r\nit would rub out pencil marks. Then and there he named it what you\r\nhave probably guessed long before this: \"rub-ber.\" Nearly every\r\nlanguage except English uses in place of the word rubber some form\r\nof the native Word \"caoutchouc,\" which means \"weeping tree.\" After\r\nPriestley's discovery, a one-inch \"rubber\" sold for three\r\nshillings, or about seventy-five cents, but artists were glad to\r\npay even that price, because their work was made so much easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2\r\n\r\nCHARLES GOODYEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1800 Brazil was the only country manufacturing rubber articles,\r\nand her best market soon proved to be North America. Probably the\r\nfirst rubber this country saw was brought to New England in\r\nclipper ships as ballast in the form of crude lumps and balls.\r\nRubber shoes, water-bottles, powder-flasks, and tobacco-pouches\r\nfound buyers in the American ports, but rubber shoes were most in\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nSoon some Americans began to import raw rubber and to manufacture\r\nrubber goods of their own, and in the old world a Scotchman named\r\nMacintosh found a way of waterproofing cloth by spreading on it a\r\nthin coating of rubber dissolved in coal naphtha. Many people\r\nstill refer to raincoats as mackintoshes. Rubber clothing shared\r\nfavor with rubber shoes, but its popularity was short-lived for it\r\ndid not wear well and was almost as sensitive to temperature as\r\nmolasses and butter. The rubber shoes and coats get hard and stiff\r\nin winter and soft and sticky in summer. A man wearing a pair of\r\nrubber overalls who sat down too near a warm stove soon found that\r\nhis overalls, his chair and himself were stuck fast together. The\r\nfirst rubber coats became so stiff in cold weather that when you\r\ntook one off you could stand it up in the middle of the floor and\r\nleave it, for it would stand like a tent until the rubber thawed\r\nout, and when thawed it was almost as uncomfortable as is fly-paper\r\nto the fly.\r\n\r\nOne day Charles Goodyear, a Connecticut hardware merchant of an\r\ninventive turn of mind, went to a store to buy a life preserver.\r\nHe could find only imperfect ones, but they drew his attention to\r\nthe study of rubber, and presently he was thinking of it by day\r\nand dreaming of it by night. Rubber became a passion with him. He\r\nfelt sure some way could be found to make it firm yet flexible\r\nregardless of temperature, and for ten years he experimented with\r\ndifferent mixtures and processes, hoping to find the right one. So\r\nintent was he on his search that he found time for nothing else.\r\nDue to neglect his business went to pieces and he became very\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1839, when he was on the point of giving up in\r\ndespair, he accidentally came upon the solution. He was\r\nexperimenting in his kitchen, a place which, through lack of\r\nfunds, he was often forced to use as a laboratory. Part of a\r\nmixture of rubber, sulphur and other chemicals, with which he was\r\nworking, happened to drop on the top of the stove. It lay there\r\nsizzling and charring until the odor of the burning rubber called\r\nhis attention to it. As he stooped to scrape it off the stove he\r\ngave a start of wonder as he noted that a change had come over the\r\nrubber during its brief contact with the stove.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise the mixture had not melted, but had flattened out\r\nin the shape of a silver dollar. When it had cooled enough to be\r\nhandled, he found that it bent and stretched easily, without\r\ncracking or breaking, and that it always snapped back to its\r\noriginal shape. Strangest of all, it was no longer sticky.\r\nApparently half the problem was solved. Whether his new mixture\r\nwould stand the cold he had yet to find out, so he nailed it on\r\nthe outside of the door and went to bed. Probably he slept but\r\nlittle and was up early. At any rate he found the rubber\r\nunaffected by the cold.\r\n\r\nThen he knew that he had made a real discovery and he named the\r\nprocess \"vulcanizing\" after Vulcan, the Roman god of fire.\r\n\"Vulcanizing\" means mixing pure rubber with certain chemicals and\r\nthen applying heat. On this process, which is by no means simple,\r\nthe great rubber business of the world has been established.\r\nPractically everything made of rubber, or of which rubber is a\r\npart, has to go through the vulcanizing process, whether it is a\r\npair of Keds, a tire, a fruit jar ring, or a doormat.\r\n\r\nSo many people had been deceived by previous rubber ventures that\r\nGoodyear had great trouble in finding anyone with enough faith to\r\ninvest money in his discovery. It was some time before he was able\r\nto take out the first of the more than sixty patents which he was\r\ngranted during his lifetime for applying his process to various\r\nuses. Under these patents he licensed several factories to use the\r\nprocess in the manufacture of rubber goods, but required them to\r\nstamp all goods with the words \"Goodyear patent.\" Scores of\r\ncompanies have since used the name Goodyear, but the only\r\nfactories that he licensed which are now in existence are parts of\r\nthe United States Rubber Company.\r\n\r\nGoodyear often had to defend his patents in court. In the most\r\nfamous of these suits, he was defended by Daniel Webster and\r\nopposed by Rufus Choate, so that we see interwoven in the story of\r\nrubber the names of two of the greatest statesmen this country has\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3\r\n\r\nTHE HEVEA TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the very first of the rubber story we may thank a little\r\nwood-boring beetle, and the way nature has of helping her children to\r\nprotect themselves.\r\n\r\nThe thistle of the meadow is as safe from hungry cattle as though\r\nfenced in by barbed wire. A cow must be starving that would care\r\nto flavor her luncheon with the needles that the thistle bears.\r\nThe common skunk cabbage would make a tempting meal for her after\r\na winter of dry feeding, had not Nature given it an odor that\r\ndisgusts even a spring-time appetite. The milkweed welcomes the\r\nbees and flies that help to distribute her pollen where she wants\r\nit spread, but she has her own way of punishing the useless\r\nthieves that trespass up her stalk. Wherever the hooks of an\r\ninsect's feet pierce her tender skin, she pours out a milky juice\r\nto entangle its feet and body, and it is a lucky bug that succeeds\r\nin escaping before this juice hardens, and holds him a prisoner\r\ncondemned to die.\r\n\r\nAll over the world there are plants with the same ability that the\r\nmilkweed has, but it is especially true of certain trees and vines\r\nof the tropics. As soon as the little beetle begins to bore into\r\nthe bark of one of these trees, there pours out a sticky, milky\r\nfluid that kills the insect at once. If this were all, the wound\r\nwould remain open, ready for the next robber who came along. In\r\norder that the break may be healed, a cement is necessary, but not\r\na hard, unyielding one, for that would crumble away with the\r\nmotion of the tree in the wind.\r\n\r\nSo with Mother Nature's perfection in doing things, the very plant\r\njuice that has done duty as a poison is hardened into an elastic\r\nstopper, with the result that, no matter how far the tree may sway\r\nand tug at the wound, the filling gives and stretches, true to the\r\ntask it has to perform.\r\n\r\nThis was the juice the crafty savage induced the tree to give up.\r\nWherever the bark was cut, the fluid poured forth to heal the\r\nbreak and hardened like blood on a cut finger. The native caught\r\nit while it was still soft and applied it to his simple needs.\r\n\r\nThis juice is not the sap of the rubber tree. Sap, which is the\r\nlife-blood of the tree, flows through the wood, but the juice we\r\nare describing is contained in the inner bark, a thin layer\r\ndirectly below the outer bark.\r\n\r\nScientific men call this juice latex. It is like milk in three\r\nways: it is white, it contains tiny particles that rise to the top\r\nlike cream, and it spoils quickly.\r\n\r\nThe particles in cow's milk are full of fats which make it good\r\nfor us to drink. But a rubber tree's milk has tiny atoms of rubber\r\nand resin and other things, and it took time to discover which of\r\nthe vines and trees was the prize milker of the tropics and gave\r\nthe largest amount of pure rubber. Finally, the Hevea, the very\r\ntree the Frenchman wrote about, proved to be the best, and,\r\nalthough by no means the only rubber tree of commercial value, it\r\nis acknowledged the greatest of rubber trees.\r\n\r\nThe Hevea tree grows sixty feet tall, and when full grown is eight\r\nor ten feet around. It rises as straight as an elm, with high\r\nbranching limbs and long, smooth oval leaves. Sprays of pale\r\nflowers blossom upon it in August, followed in a few months by\r\npods containing three speckled seeds which look like smooth,\r\nslightly flattened nutmegs. When the seeds are ready to drop the\r\nouter covering of the pod bursts with a loud report, the seeds\r\nshooting in all directions.\r\n\r\nThis is Nature's clever scheme to spread the Hevea family. The\r\ntree grows wild in the hot, damp forests of the Amazon valley and\r\nin other parts of South America that have a similar climate. The\r\nideal climate for the rubber tree is one which is uniform all the\r\nyear round, from eighty-nine to ninety-four degrees at noon, and\r\nriot lower than seventy degrees at night. The Amazon country has a\r\nrainy season which lasts half the year, though the other season is\r\nby no means a dry one, and so for half the time the jungles are\r\nflooded.\r\n\r\nThese rubber storehouses had been growing for thousands of years\r\nin the Amazon jungle with their wealth securely sealed up in their\r\nbark, the peck of a bird, the boring of a beetle, or the scratch\r\nof a climbing animal being the only draft upon their treasure. The\r\ntrees around the mouth of the river supplied whatever was needed\r\nfor the little manufacturing that was at first done. But the\r\ndiscovery that made a universal use for rubber changed all this.\r\nBrazil was surprised to find what great treasure her forests\r\ncontained. Large rubber areas were found a thousand miles up the\r\nriver and she began in a serious way to develop a large crude\r\nrubber business.\r\n\r\nLess than twenty years ago Brazil produced practically all the\r\nrubber used in the world. But to-day she furnishes less than\r\none-tenth of the world's supply. How Brazil, possessing in her vast\r\nforests millions of rubber trees of the finest quality, has been\r\nforced by unfavorable conditions to permit the Far East to sweep\r\nfrom her in this short time the crude rubber supremacy of the\r\nworld is one of the most unusual chapters in modern industrial\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4\r\n\r\nWICKHAM'S IDEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the success of the East Indies in wresting the crude\r\nrubber supremacy from Brazil, begins with an Englishman named\r\nWickham, who might be called the father of plantation rubber.\r\n\r\nWickham, who had spent some years in South America, understood the\r\ndifficulties of gathering rubber in the jungles. He believed that\r\nif rubber could be cultivated it might prove a good crop on the\r\ncoffee plantations in India which a blight had recently rendered\r\nvalueless for coffee. What a strange fact it is that this blight\r\ngave Brazil a chance to go into coffee growing, and that while\r\nBrazil was losing the rubber supremacy to the Far East, the Far\r\nEast at about the same time was surrendering the leadership in\r\ncoffee to Brazil. The latter now holds first place in coffee\r\ngrowing as firmly as does the Far East in rubber growing.\r\n\r\nWickham saw that there were difficulties that would prevent the\r\ngathering of wild rubber from keeping pace with the growing\r\ndemand. Although millions of rubber trees still stood untouched in\r\nthe Brazilian forests, only those trees near the river banks could\r\nbe tapped because of the impossibility of getting the rubber out\r\nof the dense vegetation. Life in the jungle was dangerous and\r\nlonely, and therefore rubber gatherers were not easy to find. They\r\nwere compelled to work far from their families and friends, and in\r\nconstant danger from wild beasts, reptiles and death-bearing\r\nfevers. It is no wonder that rubber obtained in this way came to\r\nbe known as \"wild rubber.\" Moreover, transporting the crude\r\nproduct through the jungles was hard and expensive and the rubber\r\nobtained under these conditions was not always so clean or high in\r\nquality as might be wished.\r\n\r\n\"If rubber trees grow from the seeds which nature scatters in the\r\njungle,\" said Wickham to himself, \"why should they not grow from\r\nseeds put into the ground by hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"If rubber trees could be raised from seed, they could be planted\r\nin the open in rows where they could easily be tended and tapped,\r\nand the rubber gathered quickly and safely. Instead of having to\r\nbrave the dangerous jungles, men could plant and cultivate rubber\r\nin spots of their own choosing so long as they chose places where\r\nthe climate was right.\"\r\n\r\nFor many years people only laughed at Wickham's great idea, but\r\nlike Goodyear he had faith enough to persevere. While in Brazil he\r\nplanted some rubber seeds to see what would happen. The seeds DID\r\ngrow, and the book which Wickham wrote about his idea and his\r\nexperiments finally came into the hands of Sir Joseph Hooker, the\r\nDirector of the Botanical Gardens in Kew, near London. So\r\ninterested did he become that he called Wickham's plan to the\r\nattention of the Government of India, and finally Wickham was\r\ncommissioned to take a cargo of rubber seeds to England, so that\r\nhis idea might be tried out.\r\n\r\nThis commission was more difficult than one might think, and all\r\nof Wickham's faith and perseverance were needed to carry it out.\r\nIndeed for a time it seemed hopeless, principally because the\r\nseeds so quickly dry up and lose their vitality that they must be\r\nplanted very soon after being gathered.\r\n\r\nBut Wickham watched his opportunity, and finally he was able to\r\ncharter a ship in the name of the Indian Government. About a third\r\nof the way up the Amazon River he placed in her hold several\r\nthousand carefully packed seeds of the Hevea Braziliensis, or\r\nrubber tree. Let Wickham, himself, tell how he surmounted the next\r\ndifficulty:\r\n\r\n\"We were bound to call in at the city of Para as the port of\r\nentry, in order to obtain clearance papers for the ship before we\r\ncould go to sea. Any delay would have rendered my precious freight\r\nquite valueless and useless. But again fortune favored. I had a\r\n'friend at court' in the person of Consul Green, who went himself\r\nwith me to call on the proper official, and supported me as I\r\npresented to His Excellency 'my difficulty and anxiety, being in\r\ncharge of, and having on board a ship anchored out in the stream,\r\nexceedingly delicate botanical specimens, especially designated\r\nfor delivery to Her Britannic Majesty's own Royal Garden of Kew.\r\nEven while doing myself the honor of thus calling on His\r\nExcellency, I had given orders to the captain of the ship to keep\r\nup steam, having ventured to trust His Excellency would see his\r\nway clear to furnishing me with immediate dispatch. An interview\r\nmost polite, full of mutual compliments in the best Portuguese\r\nmanner, enabled us to get under way as soon as the captain had got\r\nthe dinghy hauled aboard.\"\r\n\r\nCan you imagine Wickham's sigh of relief as his vessel, with its\r\nfreight of perishable treasure, steamed out of port, and began the\r\nlong journey to England?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5\r\n\r\nPLANTATION DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transporting of the rubber seeds from the Brazilian forests to\r\nEngland was only the first step in Wickham's project. The real\r\ntest was still to come. The seeds were planted in the famous\r\nBotanical Gardens of Kew, and on August 12, 1876, the several\r\nthousand seedlings which had been raised from them were packed in\r\nspecial cases and shipped to Ceylon on the other side of the globe\r\nfor the final and most important stage of the experiment.\r\n\r\nHow long the next five years must have seemed to the anxious\r\nWickham, for it was that long before the first rubber tree\r\nflowered in the gardens at Heneratgoda, sixteen miles from\r\nColombo, where the trees had finally been planted. In this year,\r\n1881, experiments in tapping began, and it was plain that\r\nWickham's dream was to be realized.\r\n\r\nFrom these few trees, so carefully tended in their youth, has\r\nsprung the whole rubber industry of Ceylon and the Far East.\r\nWickham must indeed have been proud to see the plantations\r\nspreading from Ceylon to Malaya, where rubber was eagerly taken up\r\nby planters who were despairing of ever making a living out of\r\ncoffee, and later to Sumatra and Java and Borneo. To-day rubber\r\nplantations cover an area of over 3,000,000 acres, with a yearly\r\noutput of almost 360,000 tons, or about ten times the average\r\nyearly output of \"wild rubber.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a curious coincidence in the fact that Wickham got his\r\nidea about planting rubber trees in India at about the same time\r\nthat men in America began to experiment with the horseless\r\ncarriage. You may never have stopped to think of it, but\r\nmechanical experts say that without rubber pneumatic tires,\r\nautomobiles could never have become the fine, swift vehicles they\r\nare. It was a wonderful thing that when in the early part of this\r\ncentury the automobile industry suddenly burst forth with a demand\r\nfor rubber so great that Brazil could never have hoped to supply\r\nit, there was found ready in the Far East, as a result of the\r\nplanting that had been done there, a supply that took care of the\r\nsudden emergency.\r\n\r\nA little more than ten years ago American business men began to\r\ntake an interest in the rubber plantations. They have shown\r\ncharacteristic energy in the field, and the greatest single rubber\r\nplantation in the world is owned by an American company, the\r\nUnited States Rubber Company. This plantation is on the island of\r\nSumatra in the Dutch East Indies, one of the best governed\r\ncolonies in the East. On this island is an orchard of rubber\r\ntrees, as beautifully laid out and as well cared for as any\r\norchard of fruit trees in our own country. For seventy square\r\nmiles, an area as large as the District of Columbia, the orderly\r\nranks of trees fill the gently rolling landscape, every inch of\r\nwhich is weeded as carefully as a garden. It takes twenty thousand\r\nemployees to care for the trees, which number more than 5,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn this plantation the science of growing rubber trees has been\r\nbrought to a perfection known nowhere else in the world. Groups of\r\nbotanists, chemists and arboriculturists study constantly tree\r\ndiseases, methods of increasing the yield, and the other problems\r\nof growing fine trees that will produce high grade rubber. Here,\r\nby experiment and inspection, the secrets of the rubber tree are\r\nbeing brought to light, so much so that growers look to this\r\nplantation for leadership in methods of rubber culture. This great\r\nproject so far from American soil and in a field so new gives a\r\nthrill of pride to the Americans visiting Sumatra on their way\r\naround the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6\r\n\r\nPLANTATION LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moist but very hot climate which rubber trees require is found\r\nonly in a zone around the world between the parallels of latitude\r\nthirty degrees north to thirty degrees south of the equator.\r\nWithin this zone there have been found more than 350 rubber\r\nbearing trees, shrubs and vines. For this reason this zone is\r\ncalled the Rubber Belt. As most of the rubber used commercially is\r\ngathered from trees growing within a zone extending from ten\r\ndegrees north to ten degrees south of the equator, this latter\r\nzone is sometimes called the Inner Rubber Belt.\r\n\r\nIf you will trace this belt on a map of the world you will see\r\nthat it includes the Amazon region which produces more than\r\nthree-quarters of the wild rubber used in manufacturing. Most of South\r\nAmerica's wild rubber is obtained from Brazil, the remainder from\r\nBolivia, Peru and Venezuela. Now continue the belt across the\r\nAtlantic Ocean to Africa, where you will strike the Belgian Congo\r\nwhich produces a small quantity of wild rubber. Partly owing to\r\nthe careless manner of gathering and partly to the fact that it is\r\nnot originally of as good quality as Brazilian rubber, Congo\r\nrubber is not as valuable for manufacturing as Brazilian. Then\r\ncomplete the circle by following the belt across the Indian Ocean\r\nto Ceylon and the East Indies which contain the great rubber\r\nplantations where most of the rubber used to-day comes from.\r\n\r\nTo establish a rubber plantation requires very careful planning.\r\nThe choice of a site is of first importance, for the planter must\r\nfind a locality having a moist climate with an evenly distributed\r\nrain-fall where the temperature throughout the year does not fall\r\nbelow seventy degrees Fahrenheit, and where there is protection\r\nfrom the wind. There must also be, of course, access to a steady\r\nlabor supply and a convenient shipping port. As the proper climate\r\nis a tropical one, there is usually dense jungle to be cleared\r\naway. Immense trees and thick bushes, rank straggling weeds and\r\nvines form an almost impenetrable jungle. To turn such a place\r\ninto a garden spot means a genuine battle against jungle\r\nconditions. But gradually trees, shrubs and undergrowth are torn\r\nout and burned, laying bare the rich soil ready for the plow of\r\nthe planter.\r\n\r\nMeantime the rubber seedlings have been sprouted in nurseries.\r\nWhen the ground is ready they are carefully taken up and\r\ntransplanted to the holes which have been made for them in the\r\nfield where they are to be permanently planted.\r\n\r\nThough the growth of the trees is very rapid, sometimes as much as\r\ntwenty feet in the first year, there are five years of anxious\r\nwaiting and guarding against winds and disease before they are\r\nready to be tapped and so begin to reward the planters. At first\r\nthe yield of a tree is only about one-half pound of rubber a year,\r\nand this increases so slowly that it is many years before it\r\namounts to as much as ten pounds a year. The highest yield ever\r\nrecorded was given by one of the original trees set out in the\r\ngardens at Heneratgoda, which gave ninety-six and one-half pounds\r\nin one year.\r\n\r\nHow different is life on the rubber plantations of to-day from the\r\nlife of the gatherer of wild rubber in the jungle. In Brazil, the\r\nsolitary workers have to plunge at dawn into the perilous forest,\r\nwith its lurking wildcats and jaguars, its coiled and creeping\r\nserpents. The dwellings are flimsy huts, food is scarce and\r\nexpensive, and disease and fever cause many deaths.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, workers on a well-managed plantation live in\r\ncomfortable houses in healthy surroundings and are supplied with\r\nplenty of good food. In fact the conditions are so much better\r\nthan generally prevail among natives in the Orient that work on a\r\nplantation is considered more desirable than most other forms of\r\nlabor. The unmarried men live in barracks, but the men with\r\nfamilies have individual houses with garden plots adjoining. Big\r\nkitchens prepare and cook the food in the best native style.\r\nSchools for the children, recreation centers for old and young,\r\nand hospitals to care for the sick, are all parts of the\r\nplantation organization.\r\n\r\nIn erecting hospitals and caring for the health of its plantation\r\nworkers, as in other branches of the rubber industry, America has\r\ntaken the lead. So well is this recognized, that the Dutch\r\nGovernment has awarded a medal to the United States Rubber Company\r\nfor the efficiency and completeness of its plantation hospital,\r\nwhich happens to be the largest private hospital in the East\r\nIndies, having accommodations for nearly a thousand patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7\r\n\r\nHARVESTING THE RUBBER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a cheerful sight to see the workers, men and women, dressed\r\nin all the colors of the rainbow, trooping out from their quarters\r\nto begin the day's work. The tapping must be done early in the\r\nday, for the latex or rubber juice stops flowing a few hours after\r\nsunrise.\r\n\r\nWhen the trees reach eighteen inches in girth at a point eighteen\r\ninches from the ground, they are ready for tapping. This growth is\r\nusually attained when the trees are about five years old.\r\n\r\nIn tapping, a narrow strip of bark is cut away with a knife, the\r\ncut extending diagonally one-quarter of the way around the tree.\r\nAt each succeeding day's tapping the tapper widens the cut by\r\nstripping off a sliver of bark one-twentieth of an inch in width.[2]\r\nHe must be careful not to cut into the wood of the tree, as such cuts\r\nnot only injure the tree but permit the sap to run into the latex\r\nand spoil the rubber. When the tapper has made the proper gash in\r\nthe bark he inserts a little spout to carry the dripping latex to\r\na glass cup beneath.\r\n\r\n\r\n[2] This method of tapping is shown on the front cover.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater in the morning the workers make the rounds of the trees with\r\nlarge milk cans, gathering the latex from the cups. When the cans\r\nare full they are carried to a collecting station, called a\r\nCoagulation Shed. It is as clean and well kept as a dairy. Here\r\nthe latex is weighed, and when each collector has been credited\r\nwith the amount he has brought, it is dumped into huge vats.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to extract the particles of rubber from the latex\r\nand to harden them. The jungle method of hardening rubber is to\r\ndip a wooden paddle in the latex and smoke it over a fire of wood\r\nand palm nuts.[3] It is a back-breaking process to cover the paddle\r\nwith layer after layer, until a good-sized lump, usually called a\r\n\"biscuit,\" is formed. The plantation method is a quicker and cleaner\r\none. Into the vats is poured a small quantity of acid, which causes\r\nthe rubber \"cream\" to coagulate and come to the surface. The\r\n\"coagulum,\" as it is called, is like snow-white dough. It is removed\r\nfrom the vats and run in sheets through machines which squeeze out\r\nthe moisture and imprint on them a criss-cross pattern to expose as\r\nlarge a surface as possible to the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] See picture, page 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese sheets of rubber are then hung in smoke houses and smoked\r\nfrom eight to fourteen days in much the same way that we smoke\r\nhams and bacon. After being dried in this way they are pressed\r\ninto bales or packed in boxes ready for shipment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8\r\n\r\nA LAST WORD\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be an adventure to follow a bale of plantation rubber as,\r\ncarefully boxed or wrapped in burlap, it starts on its long and\r\npicturesque journey. Bullock carts, railroads, boats and steamers\r\nbring it at last to one of the world markets, Singapore, Colombo,\r\nLondon, Amsterdam or New York, where it is bought by dealers, and\r\nthen sold to factories which make rubber goods.\r\n\r\nAn equally fascinating story might be told of its progress through\r\nthe factory, how it is kneaded and rolled, mixed with chemicals,\r\nrubbed into fabrics, baked in ovens, and finally emerges as any\r\none of the tens of thousands of articles that are made wholly or\r\npartly from rubber.\r\n\r\nRubber manufacturing is peculiarly an American industry. South\r\nAmerica gave us the original rubber trees, and the one man who,\r\nmore than any other, was responsible for making rubber useful was\r\nthe American, Charles Goodyear. To-day, two-thirds of the entire\r\noutput of rubber is sold to the United States, whose manufactured\r\nrubber goods set the standard for the whole world.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the wonders which rubber has already accomplished, and\r\nthe adventures, which have colored its history, only the beginning\r\nof the romance of rubber has been told. The plantation industry is\r\nstill in its infancy, and experiments are constantly being made to\r\ndetermine the best methods of planting, the most fruitful number\r\nof trees to the acre, the most advantageous way of tapping. In the\r\nlaboratories of the great rubber manufacturers, scientists are at\r\nwork improving old methods of using rubber and devising new ones.\r\n\r\nRubber is a substance of so many important characteristics that\r\nits uses are countless. It is used for certain purposes because it\r\nstretches, for others because it is airtight and watertight, for\r\nothers because it is a non-conductor of electricity, for others\r\nbecause it is shock-absorbing, and for others because it is\r\nadhesive.\r\n\r\nIt is on rubber that infants cut their teeth; after all the teeth\r\nare gone old age makes use of rubber in plates for false teeth.\r\nTen million motorists and other millions of cyclists in the United\r\nStates ride on rubber tires that are durable, noiseless and\r\nairtight. Balloons of rubber float aloft, and huge submarines plow\r\ntheir routes beneath the ocean's surface propelled by electricity\r\nstored in great rubber cells. Sheathed in rubber, the lightning\r\nmakes a peaceful way through our homes, offices and factories,\r\nfurnishing light and telephone service. Divers sink out of sight\r\nbeneath the waves in rubber suits. Rubber air-brake hose on\r\nrailroad trains makes safe the travel of a nation, air-drill hose\r\nrivets our ships, fire hose protects the properly in city and town\r\nand garden hose brings nourishment to our growing plants. Rubber\r\nclothing protects against storm and rubber footwear guards us\r\nagainst cold and wet. Tennis balls and golf balls and rubber-cored\r\nbaseballs give healthful sport to the millions. In hospitals and\r\nmedical work the uses of rubber are without number.\r\n\r\nTo select the most important use to which rubber is put would be\r\ndifficult. One student of the subject says:\r\n\r\n\"Of all the applications of rubber, that of packing for the steam\r\nengine and connecting machinery appears to have been the most\r\nimportant, as it has been an essential condition of the\r\ndevelopment and extended use of steam as a motive power.\"\r\n\r\nEven as you read this, rubber may be in the act of performing some\r\nnew magic, some fresh service to mankind. And who knows which one\r\nof us will, in the years to come, write a chapter in the story of\r\nrubber more thrilling than we are able to imagine to-day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA REVIEW AND QUESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
