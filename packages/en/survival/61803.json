He had already related to them, with much applause, a variety\r\nof \"Stories about Dogs,\" as well as \"Stories about the Instinct of\r\nAnimals,\" and now proposed to commence a series of narratives, \"Tales\r\nof Shipwrecks, and other Disasters at Sea,\" a proposal which his little\r\naudience, as we have above stated, received with unbounded delight.\r\n\r\nI am glad you have chosen Shipwrecks, Uncle Thomas, I am so very fond\r\nof such stories. I have just finished Robinson Crusoe, and almost wish\r\nI was, like him, cast away on a desert island, that I might have my man\r\nFriday, and my goat, and my gun!--It would be delightful!\r\n\r\nI am afraid, Frank, you would not find it so delightful as you seem\r\nto think. However, as you like it so much, I will begin my tales by\r\nrelating the adventures of Captain Richard Falconer, who was cast away\r\non a desert island, and show you how he fared.\r\n\r\nFalconer was a native of Bruton, England. His mother died when he was\r\nvery young, and being thus thrown on his father's care, he was his\r\nconstant companion. Having been a great traveller in his youth, the\r\nelder Falconer delighted to recount his adventures, and his son thus\r\nacquired an ardent desire to follow in his steps. With this view, as\r\nhe grew up, he often begged that his father would allow him to become\r\na sailor. His father knew better, however, and always replied to his\r\nsolicitations by saying, \"Stay where you are; you know not the hazards\r\nand dangers that attend the life of a sailor: think no more of going to\r\nsea, for I know that it is only the desire of youth, fond of change,\r\nwhich now actuates you; and if I were to give you leave, one week's\r\nvoyage would make you wish you were at home!\" Young Falconer, however,\r\nwas not satisfied with this reasoning, and again and again besought his\r\nfather to comply with his request. All his entreaties were, however,\r\nunavailing, till at length an event happened which put an end to his\r\nfather's scruples.\r\n\r\nThe elder Falconer held the situation of collector of taxes, and having\r\ncollected a large amount of revenue, he was unfortunately robbed of\r\nit, before he could pay it over to government. Fearful that some\r\nnegligence, of which he had no doubt been guilty, would expose him\r\nto punishment, and being thus a ruined man, he resolved to retire to\r\nsome place where he was unknown, and thus escape the vigilance of his\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nOne morning he called his son to him, and said, \"Richard, you have\r\noften been desirous of going to sea, and I have always endeavored to\r\ndissuade you from it; but as what has happened makes it impossible for\r\nme to remain any longer in the place of my birth, I must now recommend\r\nyou to the way of life which I should never have chosen for you, but\r\nthat my circumstances will not now allow me to provide for you in any\r\nother way. Here,\" continued he, \"take this money, which I can ill spare\r\nout of my little fortune; but since it is all I can do for you, take\r\nit, and may Heaven prosper you! May the blessing of a father, whose\r\nprayers shall ever be sent to the Almighty Creator for your welfare,\r\nalways be with you. Here is a letter to Captain Pultney, of Bristol,\r\nwhose friendship, I am sure, will be of service to you.\" Then, with\r\ntears in his eyes, he embraced his son, and once more gave him his\r\nblessing, and took his leave forever. They never saw each other again!\r\n\r\nHaving packed up a few things in a portmanteau, Falconer gave them to\r\nan old servant of his father's, who, to show his gratitude in the only\r\nway he had in his power, determined to see him as far as Bristol. They\r\nset out in the morning, and reached it by noon.\r\n\r\nCaptain Pultney received him with great cordiality, and promised to do\r\neverything in his power to promote his views, and when, by his advice,\r\nFalconer had studied the mathematics, and he thought him capable of\r\nperforming the duties of mate, he sent him on board the Albion frigate,\r\ncommanded by Captain Wise; and, on the 2nd of May, they set sail\r\nfor Jamaica, with a fair wind. As soon as they lost sight of land,\r\nFalconer began to be extremely sea-sick, and he bore the rough jokes of\r\nthe sailors very indifferently. One cried out, \"There's an excellent\r\nmaster's-mate; he'll hit Jamaica to a hair, if the island was no bigger\r\nthan the bung-hole of a cask!\" However, in a day or two, he perfectly\r\nrecovered, and was never afterwards troubled with sea-sickness.\r\n\r\nNothing material happened till they entered the Bay of Biscay, when\r\nthey encountered a dreadful storm; the billows ran very high, and the\r\nvessel seemed to be the sport of the waves. So high did these run, that\r\na ship, that overtook the Albion the day before, and accompanied it,\r\nwas sometimes altogether lost sight of, though they were not half a\r\nfurlong distant from each other: this continued for three days, when\r\nthe storm abated something of its fierceness, though it still blew very\r\nhard. The other vessel, by firing a gun and showing a signal, made\r\nit appear that she was in distress; but the sea ran so high, that it\r\nwas impossible to afford her any assistance; yet, the Albion, being\r\nto windward, bore down upon her, to be as near as possible without\r\nendangering her own safety. They found that she had sprung a leak, and\r\nthough they had all hands by turns at the pump, yet the water gained\r\nupon them. They begged the crew of the Albion to hoist out a boat, as\r\ntheir own was stove. They accordingly sent out their long-boat, with\r\ntwo men, but the rope that held her to the ship unfortunately broke,\r\nand she drove away with the two men in her, who were never afterwards\r\nheard of. They undoubtedly were either swallowed up by the sea, or\r\nperished of hunger, as they were then twenty leagues from shore. The\r\nship sunk in less than ten minutes afterwards, with fifty-seven men on\r\nboard, of whom four only were saved by clinging to the ropes which had\r\nbeen thrown out to them by the crew of the Albion.\r\n\r\nFrom the four men who were thus saved, they learned that the vessel,\r\nwhich had sunk, was a pirate, which, but a short time before, had\r\nattacked a French ship, murdered the captain, and such of the crew as\r\nwould not agree to join them, and that they were only waiting for the\r\nabating of the storm in order to attack the Albion. They also said,\r\nthey were forced, with several others, to become pirates; but whether\r\nthis was true or false, they behaved with great propriety during the\r\nremainder of the voyage.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th of May they made the Canaries, and saw the peak of\r\nTeneriffe. On the 4th of July, they anchored in Carlisle Bay,\r\nBarbadoes, after a desperate action with a pirate, who boarded them,\r\nbut was beat off. On the 20th of July they sailed for Jamaica, on the\r\n1st of August anchored at Nevis, and on the 7th of September arrived in\r\nPort Royal harbor.\r\n\r\nFinding that the affairs of the ship would detain it about half a\r\nyear in Jamaica, Falconer obtained leave of the captain to go in a\r\nsloop, with some of his companions, to obtain logwood, at the Bay of\r\nCampeachy, on the South American coast; and on the 25th of September,\r\nthey set out on this expedition. For six days they sailed merrily on\r\ntheir course, with a fair wind, towards the Bay; but on the seventh,\r\nthe clouds darkened, and the welkin seemed all on fire with lightning,\r\nand the thunder roared with frightful violence. In short, a dreadful\r\nhurricane approached. The sailors had furled their sails and lowered\r\ntheir topmasts, waiting for it under a double-reefed foresail. At\r\nlength it came with extreme violence, which lasted three hours, until,\r\nas if exhausted, it insensibly abated, and was followed by a complete\r\ncalm.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of October they anchored at Trist Island, in the Bay of\r\nCampeachy, and sent their men ashore at Logwood Creek, to seek for the\r\nlogwood cutters, who immediately came on board. The bargain was soon\r\nstruck; and, in exchange for rum and sugar, and a little money, they\r\ngot in their cargo in eight days, and again set sail for Jamaica.\r\n\r\nDuring the homeward voyage, Falconer one day went down into the hold to\r\nbottle off a small parcel of wine which he had there: on coming upon\r\ndeck again, wanting to wash himself, he went into the boat astern,\r\nwhich had been hoisted out in the morning to look after a wreck. Having\r\nwashed and dressed himself, he took a book out of his pocket, and sat\r\nreading in the boat; when, before he was aware, a storm began to rise,\r\nand finding that he could not get up at the ship's side as usual, he\r\ncalled for the ladder of ropes that hangs over the ship's quarter, in\r\norder to get up that way. Whether it broke through rottenness, it being\r\nseldom used, is uncertain, but down he fell into the sea; and though\r\nthe ship immediately tacked about to take him up, yet, as evening was\r\nnow coming on, and the storm had considerably increased, they soon lost\r\nsight of him. For some time he swam boldly in the direction in which\r\nhe expected to see the vessel, but at length he was forced to drive\r\nwith the wind, which, fortunately, set in with the current; and having\r\nmanaged to keep himself above water for about four hours, he felt his\r\nfeet touch the ground; and at last, by a great wave, was thrown upon\r\nthe sand.\r\n\r\nIt being now quite dark, he knew not what to do; but got up and walked\r\nas well as his numbed limbs would let him, and every now and then\r\nwas overtaken by the waves, which were not high enough, however, to\r\nwash him away. When he had got far enough, as he thought, to be out\r\nof danger, he began to examine what sort of place it was upon which\r\nhe had been thrown: he could not, however, discover anything of land,\r\nand conjectured that it was but some bank of sand, that the sea would\r\noverflow at high tide. He now sat down to rest his weary limbs, and\r\nprepare himself for death, which, it was evident, was now staring him\r\nin the face. At last he fell asleep, though he tried all he could to\r\nprevent it, by getting up and walking, till he was obliged, through\r\nweariness, to lie down again.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke in the morning, he found that he was on a low, sandy\r\nisland, surrounded by several others of the same description, and\r\nseparated from each other, about half a mile or more, by the sea.\r\nFinding that things were thus not quite so bad as he had anticipated,\r\nhe became a little cheerful, and walked about to see if he could\r\ndiscover anything that was eatable, as he now began to get very hungry;\r\nbut, to his great grief, he found nothing but a few eggs, which he was\r\nobliged to eat raw. The fear of starving seemed now to be worse than\r\nthat of drowning; and often did he wish that the sea had swallowed\r\nhim, rather than have thrown him on this desolate island; for he could\r\nperceive, from their flatness, that they were not inhabited either\r\nby man or beast, being only resorted to by sea-fowl. To complete his\r\nmisery, there was not to be found one drop of fresh water on the\r\nisland, so that he was forced to drink sea-water for two or three days,\r\nwhich caused his skin to peel off, and made him very ill. At last his\r\nmisery so increased, that he frequently resolved to terminate his\r\nexistence, but desisted, in the expectation that some alligator, or\r\nother voracious creature, would come and do it for him.\r\n\r\nOne day he discovered a bird, called a booby, sitting upon a bush,\r\nand ran immediately, as fast as he could, and knocked it down with a\r\nstick. Without for a moment considering whether it was proper food, he\r\nsucked the blood and ate the flesh with such a pleasure, as none can\r\nexpress but those who have felt the pain of hunger to the same degree.\r\nHe afterwards discovered many more of these birds, which he killed.\r\nBeing now pretty well off for food, he began to consider whether he\r\ncould not with two sticks make a fire, as he had seen the blacks do in\r\nJamaica, and at last, after many trials, happily accomplished it. He\r\nthen plucked several of the boobies which he had caught, and broiled\r\nthem as well as he could.\r\n\r\nAt night, he was exposed to a great storm of rain and thunder, with the\r\nreddest lightning he had ever seen, and was completely drenched; his\r\nclothes, which consisted of a pair of thin shoes and thread stockings,\r\nand a canvass waistcoat and trowsers, were thoroughly wet; but he had\r\nthe happiness to find in the morning several cavities of rain-water.\r\nHaving already suffered so much from using sea-water, he now thought\r\nof making a deep well, that he might have water continually by him. He\r\ntook a piece of wood, and pitched upon a place under a bush, where,\r\nwith his hands and the stick together, he dug a hole, big enough to\r\ncontain a hogshead of water; then he put in stones and paved it, and\r\ngot in and stamped them down hard all round, and, with his stick,\r\nbeat the sides close, so as to make it completely water-tight. But the\r\ngreat difficulty was how to get the water there: this, however, he at\r\nlength effected, by means of a sort of bucket made from a part of his\r\nclothing. Having been so successful in this matter, he now felt greatly\r\nelated, and thought he should not be very badly off for a long while;\r\nfor, besides the store of water, he had, ready broiled, forty boobies,\r\ndesigning to allow himself half a one a-day. Fortunately, he remained\r\nalways in good health, being only a little troubled with headache,\r\nfrom the sun beating on his head, having lost his hat in the water, in\r\nfalling down from the vessel's side. For a time he remedied this as\r\nwell as he could, by gathering a parcel of chicken-weed, which grew in\r\nplenty around, and strewing it over the bushes under which he sat; but\r\nat last, finding that he might be longer there than he expected, he\r\ntore off one of the sleeves of his shirt, and made himself a cap, which\r\nhe covered with green sprigs, twisted with bark.\r\n\r\nBy the time he had been a month on the island, his skin became as\r\nbrown, by constant exposure, as if it had been rubbed over with walnut\r\nshells. He several times thought of swimming to one of the other\r\nislands; but as they looked only like heaps of sand, he felt convinced\r\nthat he had got the best berth, so contented himself with his station.\r\nHe began, however, to feel very lonely, and was so wicked as to wish to\r\nhave companions in his misfortune, and every day hoped either to see\r\nsome vessel come that way, or a wreck, where, perhaps, he might find\r\nsome necessaries which he wanted. He used to fancy, that if he should\r\nbe forced to stay there long, he should lose his speech; so he used to\r\ntalk aloud, asking himself questions, and answering them. If anybody\r\nhad been by to have heard him, they would certainly have thought him\r\ncrazy, he often asked himself such strange questions. He was destined\r\nto be visited by companions in misfortune sooner than he expected; but\r\nI must tell you how this happened on some other occasion. I am afraid I\r\nhave already detained you too long this evening.\r\n\r\nOh no, Uncle Thomas!\r\n\r\nVery well, boys, to-morrow evening I will go on with Captain Falconer's\r\nadventures, and we will see how Frank likes this sort of life on a\r\ndesert island.\r\n\r\nAh, but Uncle Thomas, this was not a nice island, like Robinson\r\nCrusoe's! There were no large trees to make a canoe of, or any goats;\r\nand I don't see very well where Friday is to come from!\r\n\r\nI understand you, Frank; you would like it only if you had the choosing\r\nof your place, with plenty of conveniences of every kind. Good night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nUNCLE THOMAS CONTINUES HIS NARRATIVE OF CAPTAIN FALCONER'S ADVENTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, during Falconer's residence on the sandy island, of\r\nwhich I told you last evening, a violent storm arose, which continued\r\ntill noon. In the meantime, Falconer discovered a ship laboring with\r\nthe waves, and having watched it earnestly for several hours, he at\r\nlast saw it tossed by the violence of the tempest completely out of\r\nthe water upon the shore. He ran to see if there were anybody whom\r\nhe could assist, when he found four men (being all there were in the\r\nvessel) busy saving what they could. When he hailed them in English,\r\nthey seemed mightily surprised; and asked him how he came there, and\r\nhow long he had been on the island. When he told them his story, and\r\ndescribed the barrenness of the place, they were very much concerned\r\nfor themselves, for they feared there was no possibility of getting\r\ntheir bark off the sands, the wind having forced her so far; and began\r\nto bemoan each other's misfortunes. To Falconer, however, their mishap\r\nafforded a source of secret satisfaction, for he soon found that they\r\nhad on board plenty of everything.\r\n\r\nThey now set to work in order to secure such provisions as were in the\r\nship, as well as such utensils as they would find useful, including a\r\nfowling-piece and some gunpowder. They then took off the sails from\r\nthe yards, and, with some pieces of timber, raised a hut big enough to\r\nhold twenty men, under which they put the beds which they got from\r\nthe bark. It is true they had no shelter from the wind, for the bushes\r\nwere so low they were of no use; but for all this, Falconer now thought\r\nhimself in a palace, and was as merry as if he had been once more at\r\nJamaica, or even at home in his own country. In short, when they had\r\nbeen there some time, they began to be very easy, and having plenty\r\nof food, were content to wait patiently till God should send them\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nThough they had plenty of fishing tackle, they found it of little use,\r\nas they had no boat to go a little way from shore to catch fish; they\r\ntherefore set their wits to work, in order to make a float, and at last\r\nthey hit upon this odd project: they took six casks, and tarred them\r\nall over, then stopped up the bung-holes with corks, and nailed them\r\nclose down with a piece of tarred canvass. These six casks they tied\r\ntogether with some of the cordage of the vessel, and upon them they\r\nplaced the moveable hatches from the deck, and fixed them, and made the\r\nfloat so strong, that two men might sit upon it; but for fear a sudden\r\nstorm should arise, while they happened to be at sea, they tied to one\r\nend of it a coil or two of small rope, of 500 fathoms long, which they\r\nfixed to a stake on the shore. Two of the party then went out, in order\r\nto see what success they should have; but returned with only one fish,\r\nabout two feet long, something like a shark. Next day, however, they\r\nwere more successful, returning with two of the same kind of fish, and\r\na young shark about two feet long, which were dressed for dinner, and\r\nproved excellent eating.\r\n\r\nThey now began to consider what could be done to enable them to escape\r\nfrom their confinement. On examining their ship carefully, they found\r\nthat it was all sound; and though the violence of the storm had carried\r\nit considerably beyond the reach of ordinary tides, and though nearly\r\nburied by the drifting of the sand, that there was nothing to prevent\r\ntheir being able to launch it into deep water once more. They therefore\r\nset determinedly to work, and after sixteen days' hard labor, they at\r\nlast succeeded.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 31st of December, they launched their vessel, and\r\ndesigning to set sail on the following day, they resolved to celebrate\r\ntheir deliverance by a carousal. They accordingly got very merry, and\r\nwhen their punch was all done, they went to bed. Instead of sleeping\r\nin the tent, however, Falconer remained on board the bark, while his\r\ncompanions, as usual, slept on shore. During the night, one of the\r\nsudden storms, so common in these latitudes, arose, and tore the bark\r\nfrom its moorings, and carried it out to sea, Falconer all the time\r\nsleeping soundly below, quite unconscious of the danger to which he was\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nBy the time he awoke in the morning, the storm had so much abated, that\r\nhe remained unconscious of what had happened, till going on deck to\r\ncall his companions, he found that he was in the middle of the ocean,\r\nfar out of sight of land.\r\n\r\nFor fourteen days, he continued tossed about at the mercy of the\r\nwinds and waves. During the whole time, he saw but one ship, but it\r\nwas at such a distance, and bore away so fast, that no succor could\r\nbe expected. At length his vessel was driven so close in shore as to\r\nattract notice. He was then boarded by two canoes, containing one\r\nSpaniard and six Indians, to whom, by means of broken French, he\r\nexplained his condition. They carried him on shore, and introduced him\r\nto the governor, by whom he was kindly received. The place happened to\r\nbe a Spanish settlement on the coast of South America.\r\n\r\nBy the kindness of the governor, the ship was once more fitted out, and\r\nmanned, to go in search of Falconer's companions, who had been left\r\non the island. In fifteen days they reached the island, where they\r\nfound them in a most pitiable condition. They had consumed all their\r\nprovisions, and had no means of getting more; indeed, for some days\r\nthey had subsisted on the most filthy and revolting food.\r\n\r\nHaving received them on board, they again set sail; and it now occurred\r\nto Falconer that, in order to complete his equipment, five of the men\r\nwho composed his crew had been released from prison, where they had\r\nbeen confined on suspicion of piracy. A thought came into his head,\r\nwhich had escaped him before. He considered if these were really\r\npirates, being five to four, they might be too powerful for him and\r\nthe rest of his crew, and perhaps murder them. One day, as they all\r\ndined together upon deck, under an awning, it being very calm weather,\r\nhe asked the five men, what was the reason that they were taken for\r\npirates by the Spaniards. At first they seemed nonplussed; but one\r\nof them, named Warren, soon recovered himself, and answered for the\r\nothers, saying that they embarked on board the ship Bonaventure, in the\r\nThames, bound for Jamaica, whither they made a prosperous voyage; but\r\nafter taking in their cargo, on their way home, they were overtaken by\r\na storm, in which their ship was lost, and all the men perished, except\r\nhimself and four companions, who were saved in the long-boat; and that\r\nas they were making to shore to save themselves, they saw a bark riding\r\nat anchor without the port of Campeachy, which they approached in order\r\nto inquire where they were, and to beg some provisions, their own being\r\ngone. On entering the vessel, however, they found but two people in it;\r\nthe third, jumping into the water, swam on shore, and brought three\r\nboats, filled with Spanish soldiers, which came on board before they\r\ncould make off. \"Make off!\" said Falconer. \"What, did you design to run\r\naway with the vessel!\" \"No,\" answered Warren, with some confusion; \"we\r\nonly intended to weigh anchor, and go farther in shore, that we might\r\nland in the morning, it being late at night.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact of the fellow being nonplussed now and then, Falconer did not\r\nat all like, but, upon consideration, he thought it might be for want\r\nof words to express himself better; so he took no more notice of it. In\r\nthe evening, however, Middleton, one of their crew, came to him with\r\na face of concern, and told him that he did not like these fellows'\r\ntale. \"Why so?\" said Falconer. \"Because they herd together,\" answered\r\nhe, \"and are always whispering and speaking low to one another. If a\r\nforeboding heart may speak, I am sure we shall suffer something from\r\nthem, that will be of danger to us.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this, Falconer began to stagger in his opinion of their\r\nhonesty, and, therefore, he and his friends resolved to be upon\r\ntheir guard. They took no notice of their conversation to their two\r\nother companions, but resolved to wait till night, having a better\r\nopportunity then, as they slept together in the cabin. When suppertime\r\narrived, the five sailors excused themselves from joining the rest\r\nof the crew, by saying they had dined so lately that they were not\r\nhungry, which gave the others an opportunity to converse together\r\nsooner than they expected. They, therefore, opened the matter to their\r\ntwo companions, and they agreed immediately that they were in danger;\r\nso they resolved in the middle watch of the night to seize them in\r\ntheir sleep. It had been previously arranged that Falconer and his\r\nfriends were to have the first watch, which was at eight o'clock; the\r\nothers were to watch till twelve; and then, in the third watch, between\r\none and two, Falconer and his companions had determined to seize upon\r\nthe pirates as they slept. It having previously been found convenient\r\nthat one of the pirates should form part of the captain's watch, they\r\nagreed, before commencing operations, to seize and bind him fast, and\r\nto threaten him with death if he offered to make the least noise.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the first watch was set, one of the party proceeded to\r\nprepare their arms. In about half an hour, or thereabouts, Warren,\r\nwho had acted as spokesman, called to Hood, the man who had joined\r\nthe captain's watch, to get him a little water; whereupon he went\r\ndown immediately with some water to him. As soon as he was gone\r\nbelow, Falconer drew as near the hatchway as he could, to hear the\r\nconversation. Hood having been employed that day looking over the\r\nprovisions, that he might know how long they would last, the others\r\nhad not an opportunity to disclose their design to him. As soon as he\r\nwas gone down, he could hear Warren say to him, \"Hark ye, Frank, we\r\nhad like to have been smoked to-day; and though we had contrived the\r\nstory that I told you, yet I was a little surprised at their asking\r\nme, because then I did not expect it; but we intend to be even with\r\nthem in a very little time; for, hark ye--\" said he, and spoke so low\r\nthat he could not be overheard. Upon which, the other said, \"There\r\nis no difficulty in the matter; but we need not be in such haste, for\r\nyou know, as we ply it to windward, a day or two can break no squares,\r\nand we can soon bear down to leeward to our comrades, that we left on\r\nshore; for I fancy,\" added he, \"that they have some small suspicion\r\nof you now, which in time will sleep, and may be on their guard:\r\ntherefore, it is better to wait a day or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; we'll do it to-night when they are asleep,\" replied Warren;\r\nwhereupon there were many arguments for and against both plans. A\r\nlittle while afterwards, Hood came up again; and after walking up and\r\ndown for some time, fixing his eyes often upon Falconer, he said very\r\nsoftly, \"If you please, Mr. Falconer, I have a word or two to say to\r\nyou, that much concerns you all.\" \"What is it?\" asked he. \"Why,\"\r\nanswered the other, \"let us retire as far from the scuttle as we can,\r\nthat we may not be heard by any below deck.\" So they went into the\r\ncabin, and opened the hatchway above, that Musgrave, who steered, might\r\nhear what was said. Hood then began as follows,--\"My four companions\r\nbelow have a wicked design upon you; that is, to seize you, and set you\r\nadrift in the boat, and to run away with the vessel; but as I think it\r\nis an inhuman action, not only to any one, but to you in particular,\r\nwho have been the means of their freedom, I have thought it best to\r\ngive you warning.\" Finding from this conversation that he was sincere,\r\nFalconer told him that he was provided against it already, and informed\r\nhim of their design to seize his companions in the third watch. \"But,\"\r\nsaid he, \"they intend to put their project in practice next watch;\r\ntherefore, I think it will be necessary to counterplot them, and seize\r\nthem at once.\" \"As they have no arms,\" said Falconer, \"and we have, we\r\nneed not fear them.\"\r\n\r\nThey had several debates about the proper time to carry their scheme\r\ninto effect, which, unfortunately, took up so much time, that Warren,\r\ndistrusting Hood, it seems, got up, and stealing softly, came so close\r\nthat he overheard everything that was said. As soon as he understood\r\nwhat was going forward, he went and informed his companions, upon\r\nwhich they resolved to attack the crew at once. In the midst of this\r\nconsultation, Falconer and his companions were, therefore, surprised by\r\nthe pirates, who seized them, which they did with such quickness that\r\nthey were all confounded and overpowered before they had time to make\r\nthe least resistance. They then handcuffed them and tied their legs\r\ntogether so as completely to prevent their moving.\r\n\r\nIn this state the mutineers left them till it was broad day, when\r\nthey came and unbound their legs, and gave them leave to walk upon\r\ndeck; whereupon Falconer began to expostulate with them, particularly\r\nwith Warren, as he seemed to have a sort of command over the others.\r\n\"And what,\" asked he, \"do you intend to do with us, now you have\r\nsecured us?\" \"Do with you? why, by-and-bye, we intend to put you into\r\nthe boat, and turn you adrift; but, for that Hood, we'll murder him\r\nwithout mercy! The scoundrel! to betray us! But as you have not so\r\nmuch injured us, we'll put you immediately into the boat, with a week's\r\nprovisions, and a small sail, and you shall seek your fortune, as I\r\nsuppose you would have done by us.\" \"No,\" answered Falconer, \"we only\r\ndesigned to confine you till we came to Jamaica, and there to have\r\ngiven you your liberty to go where you thought fit. Put us ashore on\r\nany land that belongs to the English, and we will think you have not\r\ndone us an injury.\" \"No,\" said he, \"we must go to meet our captain and\r\nfifty men, upon the mainland of Yucatan, where our vessel was stranded.\r\nOur first design,\" continued he, \"when we were taken in our boat, was\r\nto get us a vessel to go buccaneering, which we had done at Campeachy,\r\nif it had not been for the Indian who swam on shore, unknown to us, and\r\nbrought help too soon.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Warren, therefore, ordered him to be tied to the mast\r\nof the vessel, and loaded a pistol to shoot him through the head._--P.\r\n47.]\r\n\r\nWhen the conspirators had got everything ready, that is to say, a\r\nbarrel of biscuit, another of water, about half a dozen pieces of beef,\r\nand as much pork, a small kettle, and a tinder-box, and were about to\r\ncommit their unfortunate companions to the mercy of the sea, a sudden\r\naccident changed the face of affairs.\r\n\r\nBefore they departed, the mutineers determined to let them witness\r\nthe death of Hood. Warren, therefore, ordered him to be tied to the\r\nmast of the vessel, and loaded a pistol to shoot him through the\r\nhead, not knowing that it was charged before. They all entreated for\r\nthe poor fellow, and he himself fell upon his knees, and begged them\r\nto spare him; but Warren swore bitterly that nothing should save\r\nhim: with these words he cocked his pistol and levelled it at Hood,\r\nbut in firing, it split into several pieces, and one struck Warren\r\ninto the skull so deep, that he fell upon deck. One of the bullets\r\ngrazed the side of Falconer's temple, and did but just break the skin:\r\nHood, however, escaped unhurt; but he was so alarmed at the noise of\r\nthe pistol, that he broke the cords which tied him. Finding himself\r\nunhurt, he ran to Falconer and his companions and unbound their arms,\r\nunperceived by the other two, who were busy about their unfortunate\r\ncompanion. Before the man that steered could come to their assistance,\r\nHood had unbound Falconer, and stopped the interference of the\r\nsteersman by giving him a blow with his fist, that knocked him down. In\r\nthe meantime, the rest of the crew were released, and they speedily\r\nsecured the other two pirates.\r\n\r\nAfter they had bound them in turn, they went to see what assistance\r\ncould be given to Warren, when they found that a piece of the barrel\r\nof the pistol had sunk into his skull, and that he was just expiring.\r\n\"You have overpowered us,\" said he, \"and I see the hand of Heaven is in\r\nit. I was born of good, honest parents, whose steps if I had followed,\r\nwould have made my conscience easy at this time; but I forsook all\r\nreligion, and now, too late, I find that to dally with Heaven is\r\nfooling one's self: but yet, in this one moment of my life which is\r\nleft, I heartily repent of all my past crimes.\" With that he crossed\r\nhimself and expired.\r\n\r\nFalconer and his companions now made sail for Jamaica, where, after a\r\nvariety of adventures, and being again taken by pirates, they at length\r\narrived. From thence they sailed for England, which they reached in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nUNCLE THOMAS TELLS ABOUT THE WRECK OF THE VRYHEID.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-night, boys, I am going to give you an account of perhaps one of\r\nthe most heart-rending shipwrecks with which I am acquainted; the more\r\nso that upwards of four hundred and fifty lives were lost, in all\r\nprobability, entirely in consequence of the obstinacy of the captain.\r\n\r\nFour hundred and fifty lives, Uncle Thomas! The very number is\r\nappalling.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed, John; but it is nevertheless true, that if the captain\r\nhad taken the advice of those who warned him of the danger into which\r\nhe was running, he and his crew might have escaped, as you shall hear.\r\nThe shipwreck I refer to, is that of the Vryheid, which took place near\r\nDover, in the beginning of the present century.\r\n\r\nThe Melville Castle, a British East Indiaman, after having performed\r\nthe usual number of voyages, was sold by the East India Company to\r\nan agent of the merchants of Amsterdam, trading to the East Indies.\r\nShe was carried to Amsterdam, where she underwent a tolerable repair\r\nin her upper works, and was new sheathed and coppered, but her knees\r\nand timbers remained in a very decayed state. Thus patched up, the\r\nCompany tendered her to the Dutch government, which was then in want\r\nof a vessel to carry out troops and stores to Batavia. A surveyor\r\nwas immediately ordered on board, who reported that the ship was in\r\nperfect repair, and wanted nothing but the necessary stores to equip\r\nher for the intended voyage. She was accordingly furnished with all the\r\nrequisite stores, was painted throughout, and received the name of the\r\nVryheid.\r\n\r\nHaving received on board the troops, consisting of three hundred and\r\ntwenty men, the flower of the regiment, who were selected out of nearly\r\none thousand, to form the second battalion of marines in the service\r\nof the Batavian republic, the ship got under way on the morning of the\r\n21st November, 1802, and proceeded with a favorable breeze till early\r\nin the morning of the following day, when it began to blow a heavy\r\ngale from a contrary direction. The captain immediately ordered the\r\ntop-gallant masts and yards to be struck, when the vessel appeared to\r\nride easier than before. As the day opened, however, the wind blew with\r\nincreased violence, and every exertion of the crew to render the ship\r\nmanageable, proved ineffectual.\r\n\r\nThe most serious apprehensions soon began to be entertained for\r\nthe safety of the vessel; and the state of the ladies on board was\r\nparticularly distressing. Some embraced their helpless offspring and\r\nwept over them in speechless agony, while others in vain implored their\r\nhusbands to procure the means of landing them in safety on their native\r\nshore, and to give up the voyage. The commander, Captain Scherman,\r\nwas himself in a very trying situation. His wife was on board, with\r\nan infant only three months old; and her affliction was aggravated\r\nby being surrounded with so many females, fondly weeping over their\r\nlittle ones, and earnestly entreating assistance of the captain, who\r\nhad the utmost difficulty to prevail on them to leave him, so that he\r\nmight attend to the duties of his station.\r\n\r\nThe ship continued to drive before the wind till about three o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon, when the storm increased to a perfect hurricane. Soon\r\nafter that hour, the mainmast went by the board, with a tremendous\r\ncrash, and, in its fall, swept overboard several of the crew, besides\r\nwounding four or five others. This disaster greatly augmented the\r\nfears of all on board. The captain himself, the admiral, and the other\r\nofficers, now seemed to consider their lives in the most imminent\r\ndanger; for though they were so near the Kentish shore, that they could\r\ndiscern objects on land, yet the waves, which then rolled mountains\r\nhigh, totally precluded the possibility of their receiving assistance.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency they hoisted a signal of distress, and after very\r\ngreat exertion, they managed to bring the ship to anchor at the\r\nentrance of Hythe Bay; but as it was now quite dark, they could\r\nobtain no assistance from the shore, though the wind was not quite so\r\ntempestuous. By the captain's orders the crew were plentifully regaled,\r\nand a beam of hope illumined every countenance; but, alas! it was but\r\nof momentary duration. The ship was found to have sprung a leak: all\r\nhands were ordered to the pumps; and while they were thus employed, the\r\nstorm again came on with redoubled violence.\r\n\r\nUniversal consternation now prevailed, and the piercing shrieks of the\r\nwomen and children, at each successive blast of wind, were sufficient\r\nto unman the stoutest heart. Every relief that circumstances would\r\nadmit was afforded by the ship's company and the troops, to the\r\nunfortunate ladies, many of whom were, by this time, clinging round\r\ntheir husbands and fainting in their arms.\r\n\r\nThey remained in this dismal situation for several hours, during which\r\nthe greatest order and sobriety reigned on board, till about six\r\no'clock on the succeeding morning, when the vessel parted from her best\r\nbower-anchor, and drifted towards Dymchurch Wall, about three miles to\r\nthe westward of Hythe. They continued to fire guns of distress, and\r\nkept the signal flying during the whole of the morning. At day-break,\r\na pilot-boat put off from Dover, and coming near, recommended the\r\ncaptain to put back to Deal or Hythe, and to remain till the weather\r\nbecame more moderate. \"If you proceed,\" said the boatman, \"all hands\r\nwill be lost; you are evidently unacquainted with the coast, and\r\nif the gale should continue, no power on earth can save you.\" The\r\ncaptain, however, conceiving the danger to be less imminent than was\r\nrepresented, neglected this advice, hoping that, as the day opened,\r\nthe wind would abate, when he should be enabled to put into some bay\r\nor port, without being obliged to comply with the demands of the Dover\r\npilots, or pay the Downs fees for coming to anchor there.\r\n\r\nThe pilot-boat had scarcely left the ship, when the commodore at\r\nDeal despatched two boats to endeavor to board the ship, when the\r\nunaccountable and fatal obstinacy of the captain was again strikingly\r\ndisplayed; the crew were ordered to let the vessel drive before the\r\nwind, and to pay no attention to the recommendations of the commodore.\r\nThe boats then fired several shots as a further signal to bring to,\r\nbut these were equally disregarded. A few minutes afterwards, one of\r\nthe boats passed close under the stern, and as the ship had lost her\r\nmainmast, desired she would immediately put about and stand for the\r\nfirst port. But to this, like the former solicitations, they gave no\r\nreply, and the gale increasing, they soon lost sight of both the boats.\r\nThe ill-fated captain was now in a state of the greatest agitation,\r\nand bitterly repented his refusal to take a pilot on board, but it was\r\nnow too late; the roar of the sea was terrific, and such a tremendous\r\nswell, that the chance of any relief being afforded from the shore was\r\ncompletely prevented.\r\n\r\nThe wind now blew a perfect hurricane from the south and south-west;\r\nthe signal-guns they continued to fire incessantly, and the captain\r\ntwice attempted to put the ship about, but all his exertions proved\r\nfruitless. She was now near Dymchurch Wall, where the coast, for the\r\nspace of above two miles, is protected from the encroachment of the sea\r\nby overlaths and immense piles, and is further secured by large wooden\r\njetties stretching far into the sea. On the first of these jetties the\r\nunfortunate vessel struck.\r\n\r\nIn this desperate situation, with the wind becoming more and more\r\nboisterous, the captain ordered the mizenmast to be cut away, and all\r\nthe water in the hold to be started, by staving the casks; while a\r\npart of the crew, under the direction of the officers, were incessantly\r\nemployed at the pumps. They also threw nearly the whole of the ballast\r\noverboard; but in spite of all their exertions, the danger seemed every\r\nmoment to increase. So maddening was the reflection of what might have\r\nbeen their situation had a pilot not been refused, that the officers\r\ncould not refrain from reproaching the captain with having slighted the\r\nadvice of the English in the boats: he appeared to be deeply sensible\r\nof his error, but it was now too late.\r\n\r\nThe admiral recommended the sheet anchor to be cut away, which was\r\naccordingly done, but, notwithstanding this precaution, the unfortunate\r\nship continued to beat upon the piles, and the sea to break over her\r\nwith such violence, that the men were no longer able to remain in the\r\nhold. The pumps had now become so completely choked with sand and mud,\r\nthat they were rendered totally useless, and a speedy destruction of\r\nthe vessel and all on board appeared to be inevitable. The foremast\r\nsoon afterwards went over the ship's side, carrying along with it about\r\ntwelve of the crew, who were soon swallowed up by the waves. The ladies\r\nnow began to prepare for the worst, and several of them, for greater\r\nsecurity, were handed to the bowsprit, attended by their husbands. The\r\nothers chose to wait their fate on the quarter-deck, where stood the\r\nmiserable Captain Scherman, in silent despair at the unavailing cries\r\nfor assistance of those around him; while his unfortunate wife, in all\r\nthe bitterness of maternal anguish, was clinging to his feet.\r\n\r\nAbout eight o'clock, the rudder was discovered to be unshipped, while\r\nthe tiller was tearing up the gun-deck, and the water rushing in\r\nwith fearful rapidity at the port-holes. At this moment most of the\r\npassengers and crew joined in solemn prayer to the Almighty; and while\r\nengaged in this act of devotion, the sea, foaming dreadfully, made a\r\nbreach completely over them, so that they were obliged to exert every\r\neffort to prevent their being swept out of the ship. From the uncommon\r\nfury and roaring of the waves, the signal-guns, which they continued\r\nto fire from time to time, could scarcely be heard even on board; and\r\nno hope remained of their obtaining assistance from the shore. As a\r\nlast expedient, the captain gave orders to cut away the anchors from\r\nthe bows, when a violent swell immediately parted them, and the ship\r\ndrifted with irresistible force farther on the piles.\r\n\r\nThe morning was unusually dark, and to aggravate the horrors of the\r\nterrific scene, the ship was not more than four or five cables' lengths\r\nfrom the shore; so that the crew could see that there were several\r\npeople on the Wall, but who were unable to afford them any assistance.\r\nIt was now half past eight, when a tremendous sea dashed with such\r\nforce against the ill-fated vessel, that, after rocking like a cradle\r\nfor two or three seconds, her timbers split, and she immediately\r\nbroke in pieces. About one hundred and seventy persons were instantly\r\noverwhelmed by the furious element, and not one of them ever reached\r\nthe land. The wreck, thus torn asunder, still presented nearly three\r\nhundred miserable objects clinging to the various parts that remained\r\nabove water; while the tremendous noise of the foaming billows was\r\ndrowned by the piercing shrieks and cries of the hapless women and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAt the earnest request of the admiral, the jolly-boat, which was\r\nhanging over the stern, was now launched; and he, together with\r\nthe colonel and eight females, were helped into it. They had not,\r\nhowever, proceeded far when a dreadful sea broke over them, and the\r\nboat instantly disappeared. In a few moments the colonel was observed\r\nendeavoring to support his wife above water, when a wave overwhelmed\r\nthem, and they also sank to rise no more.\r\n\r\nAs the ship was now settling rapidly, each determined to risk some\r\nexperiment to reach the shore. The captain proposed to his wife that\r\nthey should make themselves fast to a large hen-coop, and commit their\r\nlives to the mercy of the waves. A few of the crew having cut away\r\nthe coop, they with great difficulty made fast the captain and Mrs.\r\nScherman, and after an affectionate parting, lowered them down over the\r\nstern. They had nearly reached the Wall, followed by the anxious looks\r\nof those who had remained on board the wreck, when a large piece that\r\nhad been detached from it, was violently dashed against them, and they\r\nwere never seen to rise again.\r\n\r\nPainful as this spectacle must necessarily have been to the remaining\r\nsurvivers, their attention was completely absorbed in contriving means\r\nfor their own preservation. A lieutenant, his wife, and two female\r\ndomestics of the unfortunate admiral, still remained on the wreck, and\r\nthe men agreed to make one more effort to save them. Seizing one of\r\nthe hatches which had been torn asunder, they fastened it to a piece\r\nof the quarter-galley, and lashed the females to the planks, while the\r\nlieutenant, who was a good swimmer, stripped himself, and having taken\r\na rope round his waist, the raft was lowered into the water. They had\r\nscarcely been a few seconds upon the water, when a violent gust of wind\r\noverset the raft, and every soul on it was hurried into eternity. Thus\r\nperished all the officers and females who had remained on the stern of\r\nthe wreck.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the bowsprit was torn asunder from the other parts\r\nof the wreck. I have already told you that many of the females and\r\nofficers had taken refuge upon it, and the number of persons about the\r\nrigging and various parts of the bows was now above a hundred, who were\r\ndriven towards the Wall by the violence of the surf. Those who were\r\nupon the stern watched the progress of their companions with the utmost\r\nsolicitude, and just as they supposed them to be beyond the reach of\r\nfurther danger, a tremendous sea broke over them, and whelmed them all\r\nin one general destruction.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the ocean was instantly covered with their bodies, and\r\nmany of the unhappy creatures had almost reached the shore; but wave\r\nupon wave succeeded each other with fearful rapidity, and finally\r\ntriumphed over all their exertions. Among the most distressing\r\ninstances of individual suffering, was that of a captain of the\r\nmarines, who was swimming with one hand, and with the other endeavoring\r\nto support his wife by the hair of her head; till, overcome by cold and\r\nfatigue, he turned round, clasped her in his arms, and both sank amid\r\nthe waves.\r\n\r\nThe wreck, meanwhile, was gradually disappearing, and many of\r\nthe seamen and marines, successively seizing on various timbers,\r\nprecipitated themselves into the danger they were so anxious to avoid;\r\nbut it may naturally be supposed, that after so many dreadful examples,\r\nthose who still remained on the wreck should not be willing to attempt\r\nsimilar experiments. Of these there were now not more than forty-five\r\non both parts of the wreck, which frequently became so entangled,\r\nthat the men were near enough to hold a conversation with each other.\r\nTheir fate, however, was now rapidly approaching to a crisis; from all\r\nparts, the planks were being torn away, and each succeeding wave was\r\nfatal to two or three of the wretched survivers. At length, two of\r\nthe seamen determined to lash themselves to a large hog-trough, and\r\nendeavor to reach the land: they were handed over the larboard side,\r\nand after a miraculous escape from coming in contact with a fragment of\r\nthe drifting wreck, they fortunately succeeded in reaching the shore in\r\nsafety, being the first out of all the adventurers who had quitted the\r\nship that were successful.\r\n\r\nTheir success greatly contributed to animate the exertions of those\r\nwhom they had left behind, and who instantly fell to work to construct\r\na raft, which, in a few minutes, was sufficiently compact for them\r\nto make the attempt. To this frail structure did the survivers commit\r\ntheir lives; and they had scarcely got clear of the wreck, when a heavy\r\nsea struck it with such violence, that it was dashed into a thousand\r\npieces. The situation of those on the raft was now peculiarly awful,\r\nfrom the numerous fragments of the wreck, which were floating about\r\nin every direction, and by the violence of their motions threatening\r\ninstant destruction. They continued, however, to drift nearer the Wall,\r\nwhen they were run foul of by a piece of the wreck, which swept off\r\neighteen out of the thirty-three who were upon the raft, and wounded\r\nmost of the others in a greater or less degree; at the same time they\r\nwere driven forward with such velocity, that it was impossible to\r\nafford any relief to those who were struck off. About ten minutes\r\nafter this fatal accident the survivers succeeded in reaching the\r\nlong-wished-for shore, half dead with fatigue and the severe bruises\r\nwhich they had received.\r\n\r\nThus, of four hundred and seventy-two persons, who, but a few days\r\nbefore had left the city of Amsterdam, and who were but a few hours\r\nbefore on board the Vryheid, in full health and confidence of security,\r\nnot more than eighteen escaped. This wretched remnant of the crew of\r\nthat ill-fated vessel received from the inhabitants of the adjacent\r\ncoast, such generous attention, as not only contributed to their\r\nrecovery, but amply relieved all their necessities. The bodies of the\r\nunfortunate sufferers, which were scattered along the coast for many\r\nmiles, were likewise collected, and decently interred. The bodies\r\nof Captain Scherman and his wife, and many of the officers and their\r\nladies, were committed to the grave with every mark of respect.\r\n\r\nOh dreadful, Uncle Thomas! Poor, poor Captain Scherman; what shocking\r\nreflections must have been his when he found what fearful effects were\r\nresulting from his obstinacy!\r\n\r\nThey must have been shocking indeed, Frank. Let us gather wisdom from\r\nhis experience, dreadful as it was, and learn from it that an obstinate\r\nand self-willed adherence to our own opinions, in opposition to those\r\nwhose experience leads them to take a different view from us, is not\r\nonly culpable, but highly dangerous--how dangerous, in this instance,\r\nmay perhaps be gathered from the fact, that a small merchant vessel,\r\nwhich left the Texel on the same day as the Vryheid, took a pilot on\r\nboard off Margate, and was brought safe into port, without losing a\r\nsingle hand during the storm.\r\n\r\nGood night, boys; to-morrow I have a long and interesting tale to tell\r\nyou about the Mutiny of the Bounty.\r\n\r\nGood night, Uncle Thomas!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nUNCLE THOMAS TELLS ABOUT THE MUTINY OF THE BOUNTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood evening, Uncle Thomas! we are come to hear about the Mutiny of the\r\nBounty.\r\n\r\nVery well, boys, it is a long story, so I shall begin at once.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1787, it having been represented to the British Government,\r\nthat the introduction of the Bread-fruit tree into the West India\r\nislands would be of great benefit to the inhabitants, a vessel was\r\nfitted up, in the most commodious manner, for the reception of the\r\nplants, and placed under the command of Lieutenant Bligh, who had\r\npreviously sailed with Captain Cook on his voyage round the world.\r\nHer crew consisted of thirty-four persons, besides two intelligent\r\nbotanists, who were added to the expedition for the purpose of\r\nmanaging the plants during the voyage, as well as undertaking their\r\ntransplantation on board the vessel, and on their arrival at the place\r\nof destination.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d December, the Bounty sailed from Spithead, and on the 26th\r\nencountered a severe storm from the eastward, which continued for three\r\ndays, during which the ship suffered considerably. They therefore found\r\nit necessary to touch at Teneriffe, in order to refit. Having put\r\neverything to rights, they again sailed, on the 10th January, 1788.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a month they struggled hard against the tempestuous weather\r\nwhich they encountered on their attempts to reach the Society Islands,\r\nwhere the plants were to be procured, by the route of Cape Horn, but at\r\nlength, finding all their efforts ineffectual, they bore away for the\r\nCape of Good Hope, where they once more found it necessary to replenish\r\ntheir stock of provisions and water.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 26th of October, they came to anchor in Matavai Bay,\r\nin the island of Otaheite. The ship was soon crowded by natives, and\r\ntwo messengers arrived from Otoo, the chief of Matavai, each bringing a\r\nsmall pig and a young plantain-tree, as a token of friendship. Captain\r\nBligh now went on shore, accompanied by a chief named Poeenoo, and was\r\neverywhere received in the most friendly manner, the women clothing\r\nhim in the Otaheitan fashion, and afterwards accompanying him to the\r\nboat. In a few days the most friendly relations were established with\r\nthe natives, and presents of small articles were bestowed on the chief,\r\nwho was told that the king of England had sent him these on account of\r\nthe kindness of his people to Captain Cook, as well as from a desire\r\nto serve him and his countrymen. At the same time he was asked if\r\nthere was nothing he would like to send to the king in return. \"Yes,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I will send him anything I have,\" and immediately began\r\nenumerating such articles as the island afforded, and among others\r\nmentioned the bread-fruit. He was immediately told that this was what\r\nwould please the king very much, and a number of young trees were\r\npromised to be sent on board.\r\n\r\nFor upwards of five months the Bounty remained at Matavai, when,\r\nhaving at length obtained upwards of one thousand plants, she set sail\r\non the 4th of April, after bidding a most affectionate farewell to\r\nthese kind and simple-hearted islanders.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d, they reached the island of Annamooka, where they remained\r\ntill the 26th, carrying on a brisk trade with the natives in yams,\r\nplantains, hogs, fruits, &c. From thence the ship stood northward all\r\nnight, and at noon on the following day they were between the islands\r\nof Tofoa and Kotoo.\r\n\r\nSo far the voyage had been one of uninterrupted prosperity. They\r\nhad hitherto succeeded in the object of their mission, and to all\r\nappearance it was likely to result in the most complete success. These\r\nfair prospects were, however, destined to be suddenly overclouded\r\nby one of the most systematic, as well as cautious and deliberate\r\nmutinies, upon record.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _They pulled Captain Bligh out of bed, forced him upon\r\ndeck, and placed him under a guard._--P. 81.]\r\n\r\nAbout sunrise of the morning of the 28th April, Captain Bligh was awoke\r\nby Fletcher Christian, one of the mates, and three others, who tied\r\nhis hands behind his back, and threatened him with instant death if he\r\nspoke or made the least resistance. They then pulled him out of bed,\r\nforced him on deck in his shirt, and placed him under a guard with\r\nChristian, who seemed to be the ringleader at their head. To all his\r\nentreaties and enquiries as to the reason for this violence, their only\r\nanswer was a command to hold his tongue, with threats of having his\r\nbrains blown out if he did not instantly comply.\r\n\r\nThe mutineers then ordered the boatswain to hoist the launch out, and\r\nseveral of the officers were ordered into it. As Captain Bligh now\r\nsaw the fate that awaited him and the obnoxious members of his crew,\r\nhe once more made an effort to reason with those around him, but was\r\nimmediately checked, and again threatened with instant death. When they\r\nhad succeeded in getting rid of such of the crew as they disliked, the\r\nmutineers forced the captain over the ship's side into the boat, and\r\nafter subjecting their victims to much ridicule, and making sport of\r\ntheir situation, they at length cast them adrift on the open sea! As\r\nthe vessel sailed away, they could hear the mutineers shouting \"Huzza\r\nfor Otaheite!\" It was therefore supposed that the enticements of a\r\ndelightful climate and the allurements of a continuance of the life of\r\nunrestrained indulgence which they had recently led on that island,\r\nhad tempted them to the commission of the crime of which they had been\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nThe launch (a boat twenty-three feet in length) contained nineteen\r\npersons; and the quantity of provisions which they had been permitted\r\nto secure, amounted to only one hundred and fifty pounds weight of\r\nbread, about thirty pounds of pork, six quarts of rum, six bottles of\r\nwine, and twenty-eight gallons of water.\r\n\r\nThus abandoned, Captain Bligh and his companions directed their course\r\nto Tofoa, in the hope of there obtaining a supply of bread-fruit\r\nand water. They had at first great difficulty in finding any of the\r\nnatives; at length, however, having fallen in with two of them, several\r\nothers soon collected, from whom they obtained a small supply of such\r\narticles as they wanted. By degrees the number of natives increased,\r\nand they began to show symptoms of some hostile design; but they were,\r\nfor the time, overawed by the undaunted behavior of Captain Bligh.\r\nAs the evening advanced, however, they continued to congregate, all\r\ncarrying stones in their hands, which they continued knocking together\r\nin token of attack, and on the party proceeding to embark with the\r\nprovisions which they had accumulated, the attack commenced. They had\r\nall got in safety to the boat, and one of the men jumped on shore\r\nin order to untie the rope by which it was fastened, when he was\r\ninstantly knocked down and murdered in the most inhuman manner. Finding\r\nthat there was no hope of lending assistance to their unfortunate\r\ncompanion, they hastily pushed off. Some of the natives got into their\r\ncanoes, and gave chase, throwing the stones with which they were\r\narmed, with such power and effect as nearly to disable every person on\r\nboard. Fortunately, it occurred to Captain Bligh to drop some clothes\r\noverboard, when the canoes stopping to pick them up, allowed them to\r\nget a little ahead of their pursuers, and it being now almost dark,\r\nthey gave up the chase.\r\n\r\nSeeing that there was now no hope of relief until they reached Timour,\r\na distance of full twelve hundred leagues, where there was a Dutch\r\nsettlement, Captain Bligh and his companions bent their course across\r\nan ocean whose navigation was then little known, exposed as well to the\r\ndangers of the deep as to famine, their little store only allowing them\r\nto serve out one ounce of bread and a quarter of a pint of water per\r\nday.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bligh has left a very interesting journal of their sufferings\r\nduring this long and hazardous voyage, from which I will read you a few\r\nof the daily entries. It was about eight o'clock at night on the 2nd of\r\nMay, that they bore away from Tofoa, and having divided the people into\r\nwatches, and put the boat somewhat in order, they returned thanks to\r\nGod for their miraculous preservation.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d, it blew a violent storm, and the sea ran so high, that they\r\nwere obliged to keep constantly bailing, and were in great apprehension\r\nthat the bread, which was in bags, would be spoiled; to prevent this\r\nthey threw overboard all superfluous clothes, with some spare sails\r\nand ropes, in order to lighten the boat, and emptying the carpenter's\r\nchest, stowed the tools at the bottom of the boat, and put the bread\r\ninto the chest.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 5th, the gale had abated, and the boat was\r\nrunning among some islands; but after their reception at Tofoa, they\r\ndid not venture to land. Upon examining the state of their bread, they\r\nfound that a great part of it was damaged; but even this was carefully\r\npreserved for use. The next day they still continued to see islands at\r\na distance; and for the first time, to their great joy, they hooked a\r\nfish, but were miserably disappointed by losing it, as they were trying\r\nto get it into the boat. They were dreadfully cramped from the want of\r\nroom, which they endeavored to remedy by putting themselves at watch\r\nand watch; one half sitting up, while the others lay down in the bottom\r\nof the boat, with nothing to cover them, and so constantly wet, that\r\nafter a few hours' sleep, they were scarcely able to move.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th, they passed close to some rocky isles, from which they\r\nwere pursued by two large sailing canoes, but in the afternoon they\r\ngave over the chase. Soon after, it began to rain very heavily, when\r\nevery person on board did his utmost to catch some water, by which\r\nthey increased their stock to thirty-four gallons, besides quenching\r\ntheir thirst for the first time since they had been in the boat. The\r\nfollowing day they had an allowance of an ounce and a half of pork, a\r\ntea-spoonful of rum, half a pint of cocoa-nut milk, and an ounce of\r\nbread. The afternoon was employed in cleaning out the boat, and getting\r\neverything dry and in order. Hitherto Captain Bligh had issued the\r\nallowance by guess, but he now made a pair of scales with two cocoa-nut\r\nshells, and finding some pistol balls in the boat, which weighed\r\ntwenty-five to the pound, he adopted one of these as the weight of\r\nbread to be served to each person at one time.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th they experienced a violent storm of thunder and lightning.\r\nThey collected about twenty gallons of water; but were so miserably wet\r\nand cold, that a tea-spoonful of rum was served to each. The weather\r\ncontinued extremely bad, and the wind so increased, that hardly one\r\nof them got any sleep that night. The morning of the 10th brought no\r\nrelief except its light. The sea broke over the boat so much, that two\r\nmen were kept constantly bailing; and it was necessary to keep the boat\r\nbefore the wind to prevent its filling. The allowance was now one\r\nbullet-weight of bread and a quarter of a pint of water, at eight in\r\nthe morning, at noon, and at sunset, with the addition of half an ounce\r\nof pork for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe weather had not at all improved on the following day, and their\r\nsituation was becoming extremely dangerous from the constant running of\r\nthe sea over the stern, which kept them baling with all their strength;\r\nbut at noon they were much enlivened by the appearance of the sun,\r\nwhich gave them great pleasure.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th it rained towards the evening, and they again experienced a\r\ndreadful night. When the day came, they were in no way refreshed by the\r\nlittle sleep they had, as they were constantly drenched by the sea and\r\nrain; and though the men were shivering with wet and cold, the captain\r\nwas under the disagreeable necessity of informing them, that he could\r\nno longer afford them the scanty pittance of a tea-spoonful of rum.\r\n\r\nThe stormy weather and heavy seas continued unabated on the 13th and\r\n14th, and on these days they saw distant land and passed several\r\nislands, the sight of which increased, rather than alleviated the\r\nmisery of their situation; as an attempt to procure relief was\r\nconsidered to be attended with so much danger, that it was thought\r\nadvisable to remain as they were, rather than encounter the risk.\r\n\r\nThe 15th, it was still rainy, both day and night; it was so dark that\r\nnot a star could be seen by which steerage could be directed, and the\r\nsea was continually breaking over the boat: this continued on the 16th,\r\nwhen they passed a truly horrible night, with storms of thunder,\r\nlightning, and rain. The dawn of the 17th brought no relief; and the\r\nsuffering from wet and cold had been so severe, that they were obliged\r\nto break their rule, and serve a tea-spoonful of rum to each. The night\r\nwas again dark and dismal, and nothing but the winds and waves to\r\ndirect their steering.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th the rain abated, when they stripped and wrung their\r\nclothes, which greatly refreshed them; but every one of them complained\r\nof violent pains in their bones. At night the rain re-commenced,\r\nwith thunder and lightning, which continued without intermission\r\ntill the 21st, when they were so drenched with rain and salt water\r\nduring the whole of the afternoon, that they could scarcely see; and\r\non the following day their situation was extremely calamitous. They\r\nwere obliged to run right before the storm and keep a strict watch,\r\nas the slightest error in the helm would have instantly caused their\r\ndestruction. During the night the misery they endured was excessive,\r\nso much so that they expected another such a night would put an end to\r\nthe sufferings of several of them; but on the 24th the wind moderated\r\ntowards the evening, and the night was fair. In the morning they\r\nexperienced relief, from the warmth of the sun, for the first time\r\nduring the last fifteen days.\r\n\r\nAs the sea now began to run fair, Captain Bligh took the opportunity to\r\nexamine their stock of bread, and found there was sufficient, according\r\nto their present rate of allowance, to last twenty-nine days, which\r\nwas about the time they expected to be able to reach Timor: but as\r\nthis was uncertain, and it was possible they might be obliged to go\r\nto Java, they determined to reduce their present scanty rate, so as to\r\nmake the stock hold out six weeks. This was effected by continuing the\r\nsame quantity for breakfast and dinner as usual, and discontinuing the\r\nsupper allowance.\r\n\r\nAt noon of the 25th, some noddies came so near to the boat, that\r\nthey caught one of them, about the size of a small pigeon. This was\r\ndivided, with its entrails, into eighteen portions, and distributed\r\nby the following method:--one man stood with his back to the object,\r\nwhile another, pointing separately to each portion, asked aloud, \"Who\r\nshall have this?\" to which the first answered by naming somebody, until\r\nthe whole number had been served. By this impartial method, each man\r\nstood the same chance of obtaining an equal share. They had also an\r\nallowance of bread and water. In the evening several boobies came near\r\nthem, and they were fortunate enough to catch one about as large as a\r\nduck. This they killed for supper, and, giving the blood to three of\r\nthe people who were most distressed, the body, with the entrails, feet,\r\nand beak, were divided into eighteen shares, and distributed as before;\r\nand having with it an allowance of bread, the whole made an excellent\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th, at one o'clock in the morning, the man at the helm heard\r\nthe sound of breakers. It was the barrier reef which runs along the\r\neastern coast of New Holland, through which it now became their anxious\r\nobject to discover a passage. The sea broke furiously over the reef,\r\nbut within was so smooth and calm, that they already anticipated the\r\nheartfelt satisfaction they should experience, as soon as they should\r\npass the barrier. At length they discovered a break in the reef, about\r\na quarter of a mile in width, through which they passed rapidly with a\r\nstrong stream running to the westward, and came almost immediately into\r\nsmooth water.\r\n\r\nThey offered up their thanks to the Almighty for his merciful\r\nprotection of them, and then, with more contentment than they had yet\r\nbeen able to feel, took their miserable allowance of a bullet-weight\r\nof bread and a quarter of a pint of water for dinner. They now began\r\nto see the coast very distinctly, and in the evening they landed on\r\nthe sandy point of an island, where they soon discovered that there\r\nwere oysters: they also found plenty of fresh water. By the help of\r\na small magnifying glass, a fire was made; and they discovered among\r\nthe things that had been thrown into the boat a tinder-box and a piece\r\nof brimstone, so that in future they had the ready means of making a\r\nfire. One of the men had been provident enough to bring with him from\r\nthe ship a copper pot, in which they made a stew of oysters, bread and\r\npork, and each person received a full pint.\r\n\r\nThey now enjoyed a few luxurious meals of oysters and palm-tops stewed,\r\nwithout consuming any of their bread. They also collected a quantity\r\nof oysters, which they put on board the boat, and filled their vessels\r\nwith fresh water, to the amount of nearly sixty gallons. Upon examining\r\nthe bread, they found about thirty-eight days' allowance remaining.\r\n\r\nBeing now ready for sea, every person was ordered to attend prayers;\r\nand just as they were on the point of embarking, about twenty naked\r\nsavages made their appearance, and beckoned them to come near; but as\r\nthey were armed with spears and lances, it was thought advisable to\r\ndecline the invitation, and proceed on their voyage.\r\n\r\nAt length, after a variety of adventures, and the endurance of\r\nprivations almost unexampled, on the 11th of June Captain Bligh\r\nannounced the pleasing intelligence to his companions, that an\r\nobservation of longitude appeared to indicate that they had passed the\r\nmeridian of the eastern part of Timor. This joyful news filled every\r\nheart with exultation, and all eyes were intently directed to the\r\nquarter in which land was expected to appear. Evening fell, however,\r\nwithout their being able to discover any trace of it; but by day-break\r\non the following morning, a cultivated coast, finely diversified with\r\nhill and dale, appeared, stretching in a wide extent before them.--This\r\nwas Timor!\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to describe the wild tumult of joy, the\r\nintense and inexpressible delight, which filled their hearts at the\r\nsight of land! Their thoughts rapidly reverted to the varied events\r\nof their fearful passage, till it appeared scarcely credible, even\r\nto themselves, that in an open boat, so poorly provided, and under\r\ncircumstances every way so calamitous, they should have been able to\r\nreach the coast of Timor in forty-one days after leaving Tofoa, having\r\nin that time run, by their log, a distance of three thousand six\r\nhundred and eighteen nautical miles: and this, notwithstanding their\r\nextreme distress, without the loss of a single individual.\r\n\r\nThe governor of the island received them with the greatest hospitality.\r\nAfter remaining a short time at Timor, they proceeded to Batavia. Here\r\nCaptain Bligh was seized with a fever; and as his life was in danger\r\nfrom the heat of the climate, he was obliged to leave the island\r\nwithout loss of time. He accordingly sailed in a packet, and arrived\r\nin England in March, 1790. The crew were accommodated with passages\r\nhome as opportunity offered, but though apparently all in good health\r\nwhen Captain Bligh left, they did not all live to quit Batavia. The\r\nhardships which they had undergone had so undermined the constitutions\r\nof several, as rendered them unable to support the rigor of such an\r\nunhealthy climate; but of the nineteen who were forced into the launch\r\nby the mutineers, it pleased God that twelve should surmount the\r\ndifficulties and dangers of this unparalleled voyage, and live to visit\r\ntheir native land.\r\n\r\nBut, Uncle Thomas, what became of the mutineers?\r\n\r\nAnother vessel, boys, was fitted out by the British Government to\r\nproceed in search of them. Several of them were taken and brought to\r\nEngland, where, after being tried, three of them were executed. Some\r\nof the others who had been forced to join the mutiny were pardoned.\r\nFrom the statements of these men, it appeared that quarrels soon\r\nsprang up among them after Captain Bligh's departure, and several of\r\nthem suffered violent deaths--among the rest, Christian, who you will\r\nrecollect was the most active among them, was murdered by one of the\r\nnatives. The death of Christian was the signal for a general rising\r\namong the natives, who, by this time, had become tired of the English;\r\nsome of them were killed, and others, among whom was a man named John\r\nAdams, escaped, wounded, to the woods. They were joined by several\r\nfemales, to whom they had formed attachments, with whom they escaped\r\nand established themselves on what has since been called Pitcairn's\r\nIsland. For twenty years nothing was heard of them, till two British\r\nvessels, happening to touch at the island, the crews were astonished to\r\nfind it inhabited, and more so when they were accosted in their native\r\ntongue by the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nMatters were soon explained. They found Adams, a fine-looking old man,\r\nof nearly sixty years of age. He was revered as the father of the\r\ncolony, and ruled with a paternal sway over his little kingdom. He died\r\nin 1829.\r\n\r\nBut I must stop. I fear I have already detained you too long to-night,\r\nboys,--So good night!\r\n\r\nGood night, Uncle Thomas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nUNCLE THOMAS TELLS ABOUT THE LOSS OF THE KENT EAST INDIAMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood evening, Uncle Thomas! We were very much interested with the\r\naccount you gave us of the Mutiny of the Bounty. As we came along we\r\nwere thinking what a shocking thing it would be for a ship to take fire\r\nat sea. Do such misfortunes ever take place, Uncle Thomas?\r\n\r\nYes, boys, they do, though much less frequently than one would expect.\r\nThe sailors are very careful, and are prohibited from using lights\r\nafter certain hours. I can tell you about the loss of a large East\r\nIndiaman, which caught fire in the Bay of Biscay, and was completely\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nOh! do let us hear it, Uncle Thomas!\r\n\r\nOn the 19th February, 1825, the Kent, a fine new vessel, commanded by\r\nCaptain Henry Cobb, bound for Bengal and China, left the Downs. She had\r\non board a crew of one hundred and forty-eight men, including officers,\r\nwith twenty military officers, three hundred and forty-four soldiers,\r\nforty-three women, and sixty-six children, belonging to the 31st\r\nregiment, and twenty private passengers; making in all six hundred and\r\nforty-one persons.\r\n\r\nThe Kent proceeded prosperously on her voyage until the night of the\r\n28th February, when her progress was arrested by a violent gale from\r\nthe west, which gradually increased during the following morning. So\r\nviolent was the storm, that at every lurch the main chains of the\r\nvessel were considerably under water, and the various articles of\r\nfurniture were dashed about the cabin with such noise and violence, as\r\nto excite the liveliest apprehensions of danger.\r\n\r\nThe utmost activity of the officers and crew of the Kent was called\r\ninto exercise, and everything was done in order to secure the safety of\r\nthe vessel. In the course of his duty, one of the officers went into\r\nthe hold, accompanied by a couple of sailors, in order to see that all\r\nwas fast. They carried with them a patent lantern, and seeing that the\r\nlamp burned dimly, the officer took the precaution to hand it up to the\r\ndeck to be trimmed. Having discovered that one of the spirit casks had\r\nbroken loose from its fastenings, he sent the sailors for some billets\r\nof wood to secure it; but the ship in their absence having made a\r\nheavy lurch, the officer unfortunately dropped the lamp, and letting\r\ngo his hold of the cask, in his eagerness to recover the lantern, it\r\nsuddenly stove, and the spirits communicating with the flame, the whole\r\nplace was instantly in a blaze.\r\n\r\nSo long as the flames appeared to be confined to the spot where the\r\nfire originated, which was surrounded on all sides by water casks,\r\nhopes were entertained that it might be subdued; but no sooner was the\r\nlight blue vapor, that at first arose, succeeded by volumes of thick\r\ndingy smoke, which, speedily ascending through all the four hatchways,\r\nrolled over every part of the ship, than almost all hope of saving\r\nthe vessel was abandoned. \"The flames have reached the cable tier!\"\r\nwas exclaimed by some individuals; and the strong pitchy smell that\r\npervaded the deck, soon confirmed the truth of the exclamation.\r\n\r\nIn these awful circumstances, Captain Cobb, with an ability and\r\ndecision of character that seemed to increase with the imminence of the\r\ndanger, resorted to the fearful experiment of ordering the lower decks\r\nto be scuttled, and the lower port-holes of the vessel to be opened,\r\nfor the free admission of the waves.\r\n\r\nThese orders were speedily executed, but not before several of the\r\nunhappy passengers had perished from suffocation. So dense and\r\noppressive was the smoke, that it was with the greatest difficulty any\r\nperson could remain long enough below deck to execute the captain's\r\nwishes, but no sooner were they accomplished, than the sea rushed in\r\nwith extraordinary force, carrying before it the largest chests,\r\nbulk-heads, and other weighty articles. The immense quantity of water\r\nthus introduced, had the effect of checking the fury of the flames for\r\na time, but a new source of danger suddenly opened upon them--the ship\r\nbecoming water-logged, and seemed in danger of going down.\r\n\r\nThe scene of horror that now presented itself almost baffles\r\ndescription. The upper deck was covered with between 600 and 700 human\r\nbeings, many of whom, from previous sea-sickness, were forced, on the\r\nfirst alarm, to flee from below, in a state of absolute nakedness, and\r\nwere now running about in quest of husbands, children or parents. While\r\nsome were standing in silent resignation, or in stupid insensibility,\r\nto their impending fate, others were yielding themselves up to frantic\r\ndespair. Some on their knees were earnestly imploring the mercy of Him\r\nwhose arm, they exclaimed, was at length outstretched to smite them;\r\nothers were to be seen hastily crossing themselves, and performing\r\nvarious external acts required by their particular persuasion; while\r\na number of the older and more stouthearted soldiers and sailors took\r\ntheir seats directly over the powder magazine,--hoping, as they stated,\r\nthat by means of the explosion which they every instant expected, a\r\nspeedier termination might be put to their sufferings.\r\n\r\nAll hope had departed, and the employment of the different individuals\r\nindicated an utter despair of rescue. One was to be seen thoughtfully\r\nremoving a lock of hair from his writing-desk to his bosom, and another\r\nofficer, procuring paper, addressed a short communication to his\r\nfather, which he afterwards carefully enclosed in a bottle, in the hope\r\nthat it might eventually reach its destination, and relieve him from\r\nthe long years of fruitless anxiety and suspense, which the melancholy\r\nfate which hung over him might awaken. At this appalling instant, when\r\nall hope of being saved was taken away, it occurred to Mr. Thompson,\r\nthe fourth mate, to send a man to the fore-top, rather with the ardent\r\nwish that some friendly sail might be descried on the face of the\r\nwaters, than with any expectation that it would be realized. For a\r\nmoment the sailor who ascended threw his eyes around the horizon--a\r\nmoment of unutterable suspense--and then, waving his hat, exclaimed,\r\n\"A sail, on the lee bow!\" The joyful announcement was received with\r\nheartfelt thanksgivings, and answered by three loud cheers from those\r\non deck; the signals of distress were instantly hoisted, minute-guns\r\nfired, and endeavors made, under three topsails and foresail, to bear\r\ndown upon the stranger, which proved to be the Cambria, a small brig of\r\ntwo hundred tons burthen, commanded by Captain Cook, and bound to Vera\r\nCruz, having on board twenty or thirty Cornish miners, and some agents\r\nof the Anglo-Mexican company.\r\n\r\nFor ten or fifteen agonizing minutes, the crew of the Kent were in\r\ndoubt whether the brig perceived their signals, or, perceiving them,\r\nwas either disposed or able to give them any assistance. From the\r\nviolence of the gale, as they afterwards learned, the report of the\r\nguns was not heard, but the ascending volumes of smoke from the ship\r\nsufficiently announced the dreadful nature of their distress; and\r\nafter a short period of the greatest suspense, they saw the brig hoist\r\nBritish colours, and crowd all sail to hasten to their relief.\r\n\r\nWhile the vessel was approaching, arrangements were made for getting\r\nout the boats, so as to have all in readiness so soon as she came\r\nwithin a reasonable distance. Before hoisting out the boat, it was\r\nfilled with the officers' ladies and the female passengers, and as\r\nmany of the soldiers' wives as it could safely carry. They hurriedly\r\nwrapped themselves in whatever articles of clothing they could first\r\nlay their hands on; and, at about half past two o'clock, a most\r\nmournful procession advanced from the after-cabins to the starboard\r\ncuddy-port, from the outside of which the cutter was suspended. Not a\r\nsound was heard--not a syllable was uttered--even the infants ceased\r\nto cry, as though conscious of the unspoken anguish that was rending\r\nthe hearts of their parting parents; nor did aught occur to break the\r\nsolemn stillness of the scene, save in one or two instances, when the\r\nladies plaintively entreated to be left behind with their husbands; but\r\nbeing assured that every moment's delay might occasion the sacrifice\r\nof life, they successively suffered themselves to be torn from the\r\ntender embrace; and, with a fortitude which never fails to characterize\r\nand adorn their sex on occasions of overwhelming trial, were placed,\r\nwithout a murmur, in the boat, which was immediately lowered into so\r\ntempestuous a sea, as to leave them only to hope against hope, that\r\nit should live in it for a single moment. Twice the cry was heard from\r\nthose on the chains that the boat was swamping; but He who enabled the\r\napostle Peter to walk on the face of the deep, was graciously attending\r\nto the silent, but earnest, aspirations of those on board, and had\r\ndecreed its safety.\r\n\r\nAlthough every precaution was taken to diminish the danger of the\r\nboat's descent--a man having been stationed at each end, with an\r\naxe, ready to cut the ropes, in case of any difficulty occurring in\r\nunhooking it from the tackle by which it was lowered--yet the extreme\r\ndifficulty of the operation had nearly proved fatal to the whole of its\r\nprecious cargo. After one or two unsuccessful attempts had been made\r\nto place the little frail bark fairly upon the surface of the water,\r\nthe command was given to unhook: the stern tackle was immediately\r\ncleared, but the ropes at the bow having got foul, the sailors there\r\nfound it impossible to obey the order. In vain was the axe applied to\r\nthe entangled tackle. The moment was inconceivably critical, as the\r\nboat, necessarily following the motions of the ship, was gradually\r\nrising out of the water, and must in another instant have been hanging\r\nperpendicularly by the bow, and its helpless passengers precipitated\r\ninto the sea, had not a wave providentially struck the stern and lifted\r\nit up, so as to enable the seamen to clear the tackle; and the boat,\r\nbeing dexterously disentangled from the ship, was soon seen battling\r\nwith the billows in its progress to the brig--one instant like a speck\r\nupon their summit, and then disappearing for several seconds, as if\r\nengulfed in the horrid vale between them.\r\n\r\nThe Cambria having prudently lain at some distance from the Kent,\r\nlest she should be involved in her explosion, or exposed to the fire\r\nof the guns, which, being all shotted, afterwards went off as they\r\nwere successively reached by the flames, the boat had a considerable\r\ndistance to row. The interval of its leaving the Kent, and its arrival\r\nat the side of the Cambria, was a time of most intense interest; at\r\nlength, however, it reached her in safety, and the inmates, one after\r\nanother, arrived on board.\r\n\r\nIt being impossible for the boats, after the first trip, to come\r\nalongside the Kent, a plan was adopted for lowering the women and\r\nchildren by ropes from the stern, by tying them two-and-two together.\r\nBut from the heaving of the ship, and the extreme difficulty of\r\ndropping them at the instant the boat was underneath, many of the poor\r\ncreatures were unavoidably plunged repeatedly under water: all the\r\nwomen, from their superior strength, were happily able to endure this\r\nrough usage, but, unfortunately, several children fell victims.\r\n\r\nAmid the conflicting feelings and dispositions manifested by the\r\nnumerous actors in this melancholy drama, many affecting proofs\r\nwere elicited of parental and filial affection, or of disinterested\r\nfriendship, that seemed to shed a momentary halo around the gloomy\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nTwo or three soldiers, to relieve their wives of a part of their\r\nfamilies, sprang into the water with their children, and perished in\r\ntheir endeavors to save them. One young lady, who had resolutely\r\nrefused to leave her father, whose sense of duty kept him at his\r\npost, was very near falling a sacrifice to her filial devotion, not\r\nhaving been picked up by those in the boats until she had sunk five\r\nor six times. Another individual, who was reduced to the frightful\r\nalternative of losing his wife or his children, hastily decided in\r\nfavor of his duty to the former: his wife accordingly was saved, and\r\nfour fine children, alas! left to perish. One fine fellow, a soldier,\r\nwho had neither wife nor child of his own, but who evinced the greatest\r\nsolicitude for the safety of those of others, insisted on having three\r\nchildren lashed to him, with whom he plunged into the water; but not\r\nbeing able to reach the boat, he was drawn back again into the ship,\r\nyet not before two of the children had expired. One man fell down the\r\nhatchway into the flames. But the numerous instances of individual loss\r\nand suffering were not confined to the commencement of the perilous\r\nvoyage between the two vessels: one man, who fell between the boat and\r\nthe brig, had his head literally crushed; while some were lost in their\r\nattempts to ascend the sides of the Cambria.\r\n\r\nAs the day was drawing to a close, and the flames were now slowly, but\r\nperceptibly, extending, the gallant commanders felt increased anxiety\r\nfor the safety of the remainder of the brave men under their charge.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate this object a rope was suspended from the extremity of\r\nthe spanker-boom, which projects from sixteen to eighteen feet over the\r\nstern, and, in such a large ship as the Kent, on ordinary occasions\r\nrests about nineteen or twenty feet above the water. In order more\r\nreadily to reach the boats, and to prevent the danger of their being\r\nstove by approaching too close to the vessel, the men were directed\r\nto proceed along the boom and slide down by the rope. But as from the\r\ngreat swell of the sea, it was impossible for the boats to retain their\r\nstation for a moment, most of those who adopted this course, were\r\neither left for a time swinging in mid-air, or plunged into the sea,\r\nand perhaps violently flung against the boat as it once more approached\r\nto their rescue.\r\n\r\nAt length, when nearly every person was removed, and when those only\r\nremained whom fear had so overcome as to prevent their availing\r\nthemselves of the means of escape, even at the urgent request of\r\nthose in the boats, Captain Cobb quitted the ill-fated vessel, and\r\nshortly after the boat in which he was reached the Cambria, the flames,\r\nwhich had spread along the upper deck of the Kent, ascended with the\r\nrapidity of lightning to the masts and rigging, forming one general\r\nconflagration, and illuminating the heavens to an immense distance,\r\nuntil the masts, one by one successively, fell like stately steeples\r\nover the ship's side. At last, about half-past one in the morning, the\r\nfire communicated to the powder magazine, the long-threatened explosion\r\ntook place, and the fragments of the magnificent Kent were instantly\r\nhurried, like so many rockets, high into the air.\r\n\r\nThe Cambria now made all sail to the nearest port, and, though the\r\nviolence of the gale continued, she arrived at Falmouth shortly after\r\nmidnight on the 3d of March, when her unfortunate crew were received\r\nwith the utmost kindness by the inhabitants, and their wants instantly\r\nattended to.\r\n\r\nWere those that remained on board the Kent all lost, Uncle Thomas?\r\n\r\nNo, not the whole of them, boys. Wonderful to relate, the flames\r\nand the explosion attracted the notice of the crew of another ship,\r\nnamed the Caroline, on her passage from Alexandria to Liverpool, who\r\nimmediately set their sails and bore down upon the wreck. They were\r\nfortunately in time to save twelve persons whom they found floating\r\nabout on a mast. The captain of the Caroline, with the greatest\r\nhumanity, remained in the neighborhood all night, in the hope of\r\nassisting any who might have taken refuge on other parts of the wreck.\r\nIn the morning they rescued two more of the unfortunate survivers,\r\nbeing all that they could discover, from the floating masses of wreck.\r\nBut the sky beginning to assume a stormy aspect, the boat which had\r\nbeen sent out was forced to return to the ship, which once more\r\nproceeded on her voyage.\r\n\r\nWas rum the cause of this sad disaster, Uncle Thomas?\r\n\r\nYes, my boys, rum did all the mischief.\r\n\r\nThen we will have no rum on board of our ship, when we are men, will\r\nwe, John? for it is of no use, father says.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nUNCLE THOMAS TELLS ABOUT THE WRECK OF THE MEDUSA.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood evening, boys. The tale which I am going to tell you this evening,\r\nso far exceeds in misery and crime all of those which I have already\r\ntold you, that it is almost necessary for me, before I begin, to\r\nassure you that it really happened. I question indeed, if the wildest\r\nimagination could have contrived to conjure up such a complication of\r\ndisasters.\r\n\r\nIt must be something very terrible indeed, Uncle Thomas!\r\n\r\nIt is, boys;--but you shall judge for yourselves. On the restoration\r\nof the general peace, in the year 1814, the French possessions\r\non the west coast of Africa, which had been taken by the British\r\nforces, were agreed to be given up. An expedition, consisting of a\r\nfrigate and three other vessels, having on board nearly four hundred\r\npersons, men of science, artisans, agriculturists, &c, was accordingly\r\ndespatched, in June, 1816, to take possession of them. The naval part\r\nof the expedition was entrusted to an officer named Lachaumareys, who\r\ncommanded the Medusa, of forty-four guns.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the ignorance of the officers of the ship of the\r\nnavigation of the coast, the Medusa unfortunately run aground on the\r\nbank of Arguin, on the coast of Africa. After in vain trying every\r\nmeans of getting her off, and finding that all hope of saving the\r\nvessel was useless, they took measures to secure the safety of the\r\ncrew and passengers. Finding that the boats did not afford sufficient\r\naccommodation for the whole, a raft was hastily constructed; but in\r\nthe tumult of abandoning the wreck, it happened that the raft, which\r\nwas destined to carry the greatest number of persons, had on board the\r\nsmallest quantity of provisions.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, the boats pushed off, towing the raft, those on\r\nboard assuring the passengers on the raft that they would conduct them\r\nin safety to land. They had not proceeded above a couple of leagues,\r\nhowever, when, one after another, the boats cast off the tow-lines, and\r\nleft the raft to its fate, each striving to make off with all possible\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was discovered that the raft was completely\r\noverloaded, and the articles of which it was composed becoming\r\nsaturated with water, it sunk below the surface, so as to immerse every\r\nperson on board nearly up to the middle in water. Finding themselves\r\nthus abandoned, and threatened every instant with being swallowed\r\nup in the deep, the most horrible ideas took possession of their\r\nimaginations; they gave themselves up to despair. With some difficulty,\r\nthe officers who were on board succeeded in restoring their men to a\r\ncertain degree of tranquillity. Their own confidence had well nigh\r\ngiven way when they found that they were in the middle of the ocean,\r\nwithout chart or compass on the raft. It was discovered that one of the\r\nmen had preserved a pocket-compass, but in their anxiety to secure this\r\ninvaluable little instrument, it fell from the hands of the person who\r\nheld it, and disappeared between the openings of the raft.\r\n\r\nAs night came on, the breeze freshened and the sea began to swell. By\r\nmidnight the weather had become very stormy, the waves breaking over\r\nthem in every direction. During the whole night the unhappy wretches\r\nstruggled against death, holding firmly by the spars to prevent\r\nthemselves from being swept away, tossed by the waves from one end to\r\nthe other, sometimes precipitated into the sea, floating between life\r\nand death; \"mourning over our misfortunes,\" says one of the survivers,\r\n\"certain of perishing, yet contending for the remains of existence with\r\nthat cruel element which threatened to swallow us up. Such was our\r\nsituation till break of day--horrible situation! How shall we convey\r\nan idea of it which will not fall far short of the reality?\"\r\n\r\nIn the morning the wind abated and the sea subsided a little, but the\r\nday-light displayed a scene scarcely less appalling than the storm of\r\nthe night. Ten or twelve of the unhappy men had their limbs jammed\r\nbetween the spars of the raft, and exhausted by fatigue and hunger, and\r\nunable to extricate themselves, had perished in this situation. Several\r\nhad been swept away altogether, so that when they came to count their\r\nnumber, it was found that twenty had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe day turned out beautiful, and they flattered themselves with the\r\nhope that in the course of it some of the boats would come to their\r\nrescue. Evening approached, however, and none was to be seen. As the\r\nnight advanced, the storm again rose; the waves broke over them, many\r\nwere swept away, and the crowding to the centre of the raft became so\r\noppressive, that several were crushed to death. Firmly persuaded that\r\nthey were on the point of being swallowed up by the sea, the soldiers\r\nand sailors, abandoning themselves to despair, resolved to sooth their\r\nlast moments by drinking to intoxication. They bored a hole in the head\r\nof a large cask, and continued to suck till the salt water, mixing\r\nwith the wine, rendered it no longer palatable. Excited by the wine\r\nacting on empty stomachs and on bodies weakened by hunger and fatigue,\r\nthey now became deaf to the voice of reason, and openly declared their\r\nintention to murder their officers and to cut the ropes which bound the\r\nraft together. One wretch, indeed, seizing an axe, actually began the\r\ndreadful work. The officers rushed forward, and their interference was\r\na signal for a general revolt. The mutineers, for the most part, were\r\nfortunately badly armed, and the sabres and bayonets of the opposite\r\nparty kept them at bay. One fellow was discovered secretly cutting the\r\nropes which bound their frail raft together. He was instantly flung\r\ninto the sea. Others cut the ropes which supported the mast, and it\r\nfell on one of the officers and broke his thigh. He was instantly\r\nseized by the mutineers and thrown overboard, but was saved by his\r\nfriends. Finding that it was necessary to make a desperate effort to\r\nput an end to the mutiny, the officers once more rushed forward, and\r\nmany of the mutineers fell. By-and-by, the effects of the wine which\r\nthey had drank wore off, and they sank into calmness and servility,\r\ncrying out for mercy, and begging forgiveness on their knees.\r\n\r\nIt was now midnight, and tranquillity appeared once more to be\r\nrestored; but scarcely an hour had elapsed when the mutineers, as if\r\nonce more seized with sudden frenzy, rushed on the officers, tearing\r\nthem with their teeth. A new scene of slaughter again took place, and\r\nthe raft was once more strewed with dead bodies.\r\n\r\nWhen day dawned, it was found that in the night of horror which had\r\njust elapsed, no fewer than sixty-five of the mutineers had perished,\r\nas well as two of the other party. The scanty stock of provisions which\r\nthey at first possessed, was now exhausted. A single cask of wine\r\nonly remained. They began to experience the most violent cravings of\r\nhunger, and in the extremity of their distress were forced to devour\r\nthe dead bodies of their unfortunate companions. Some, who, even in\r\nthe extremity to which they were reduced, revolted from this horrible\r\nrepast, tried to stay the pangs of hunger by gnawing their sword-belts,\r\ncartridge-boxes, &c; but from them they found little relief.\r\n\r\nA third night of horror approached. Fortunately, the weather was now\r\ncalm, and they were disturbed only by the piercing cries of those\r\nwho were hourly falling victims to hunger and thirst. The morning's\r\nsun showed the survivers the lifeless bodies of ten or a dozen more\r\nof their unfortunate companions, who had died during the night. They\r\nwere all committed to the deep except one, who was kept to satisfy\r\nthe cravings of his unhappy comrades. A shoal of flying-fish, in\r\npassing the raft, left a great number entangled between the spars. This\r\nafforded them a momentary relief from the shocking repast to which they\r\nhad of late been accustomed.\r\n\r\nThe fourth night was marked by another revolt. It was, however, soon\r\nquelled; two lives only being lost in the scuffle. Their number was now\r\nreduced to thirty; and it was calculated that the wine and fish which\r\nremained would be just enough to last four days; but in these four days\r\nthey also calculated that ships might arrive from St. Louis to save\r\nthem. Soon after this intimation was made, two soldiers were discovered\r\nbehind the cask of wine, through which they had bored a hole for the\r\npurpose of drinking it. It having been determined that the punishment\r\nof death should be inflicted on any one who should be guilty of such a\r\ncrime, they were immediately tossed into the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _At length the raft was discovered by a small brig,\r\nwhich was sent out in search of her._--P. 137.]\r\n\r\nTheir number was thus reduced to twenty-eight; and, as nearly one half\r\nof them were so worn out and emaciated, that it was in vain to expect\r\ntheir surviving till assistance could arrive, (but, as long as they did\r\nlive, they consumed part of the scanty stock of provisions,) a council\r\nwas held, and after deliberation, it was decided to throw overboard the\r\nweak and the sickly. This shocking resolution was immediately carried\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\nAt length the raft was discovered by a small brig, which had been\r\nsent out in search of it. Of the 150 who embarked, fifteen only were\r\nreceived on board the brig; and of these, six died shortly after their\r\narrival at St. Louis.\r\n\r\nOh dreadful, Uncle Thomas! It is indeed the most awful tale you have\r\nyet told us. Did the parties in the boats reach land safely?\r\n\r\nYes, Harry, they all reached the shore in safety, though several of\r\nthem afterwards fell victims to the combined effects of hunger, thirst,\r\nand the oppression of a burning sun. Shortly after their arrival, the\r\ngovernor, recollecting that the Medusa, at the time of her wreck, had\r\non board a large sum of money, despatched a vessel to try to recover\r\nit. From various causes, the ship was twice put back; and when she\r\nreached the wreck, fifty-two days after it was abandoned, she found\r\nthree miserable wretches still on board, and so reduced as to be just\r\non the point of expiring!\r\n\r\nWhere did they come from, Uncle Thomas?\r\n\r\nWhy, John, they had never quitted the ship. You will recollect that,\r\nwhen the boats left it, such was the scene of confusion, that the\r\nfewest provisions were put on board the raft, where there were the most\r\npassengers. Well, these men, along with fourteen others, had either\r\nconcealed themselves, or refused to leave the ship. They managed to\r\nsecure a quantity of provisions; and so long as these lasted, there\r\nappearing no danger of the wreck going to pieces, they remained quietly\r\nawaiting the arrival of assistance; but finding their provisions\r\nbegin to run short, twelve of the most determined constructed a raft;\r\nbut, setting off without either sail or oars, they were all drowned.\r\nAnother, who had refused to embark with them on the raft, resolved, a\r\nday or two after, to try to reach the shore, and, lowering a hen-coop\r\nfrom the deck, placed himself on it; but, before he had sailed half a\r\ncable's length, he sank, to rise no more. The other four determined to\r\nstick by the wreck; and one of them died before assistance reached them.\r\n\r\nDid the other three arrive in safety, Uncle Thomas?\r\n\r\nI believe they did, Frank; one of them was, however, shortly afterwards\r\nfound murdered in his bed. But I dare say you have had enough of\r\nhorrors for the evening; so, I believe I must stop.\r\n\r\nOh yes, Uncle Thomas, quite enough for one evening. We will therefore\r\nbid you good night.\r\n\r\nGood night, boys: I will be glad to see you again to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nUNCLE THOMAS TELLS ABOUT THE LOSS OF THE WINTERTON EAST INDIAMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood evening, boys. I am glad to see you so early. I have \"a long yarn\r\nto spin\" to-night, as the sailors say; though fortunately it contains\r\nfewer horrors than that of last evening. The strife of the elements is\r\nin deed as strong, but the angry passions of man--more dreadful than\r\nthe fiercest storm--form no part of the tale.\r\n\r\nI am glad of it, Uncle Thomas. The shocking conduct of the mutineers\r\non board the raft, after leaving the Medusa, of which you told us last\r\nnight, makes me shudder when I think of it.\r\n\r\nIntoxicating drinks, my boys, often make men mad. The tale which I am\r\ngoing to tell you this evening, is that of the loss of the Winterton,\r\nan East Indiaman, which was wrecked on the Island of Madagascar, on her\r\npassage to India. The Winterton sailed from England in the spring of\r\n1792, and arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in safety. On leaving the\r\nCape, it was Captain Dundas's intention to have taken what is called\r\nthe outer passage to India, but, encountering light, variable winds,\r\nhe was obliged to abandon his original design, and bore away for the\r\nMozambique Channel.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid a shoal, which he knew to be somewhat incorrectly\r\nlaid down in the charts, Captain Dundas steered east. Thinking he\r\nhad sufficiently accomplished this, he altered his course; but had\r\nscarcely sailed in this new direction for three hours, when the ship,\r\nwhich they supposed to be sixty miles distant from land, struck.\r\n\r\nThe boats were instantly got out, and on sounding they found deep water\r\nwithin fifty yards of the stern of the vessel.\r\n\r\nEvery exertion was made to get her off, but without avail. Day-light\r\nsoon disclosed to them the dangers of their situation. The ship had\r\nstruck on a reef of rocks, about six miles from land.\r\n\r\nAs the tide ebbed, the ship beat violently, and began to leak, and\r\nby-and-by the rudder was broken off, and the copper sheathing of the\r\nvessel came up alongside her; but as she lay comparatively quiet, hopes\r\nwere entertained that they might succeed in getting her off next tide.\r\nWith this view they proceeded to lighten her by every means, throwing\r\nthe guns overboard--carrying them to such a distance as to prevent\r\ntheir injuring the ship as she again rose with the tide. When, however,\r\nthey had succeeded in removing about half the number, the sea-breeze\r\nset in fresh, and prevented the boats from approaching the ship's side.\r\nThey continued, notwithstanding, to relieve her as much as possible, by\r\nthrowing overboard such heavy articles as the tide would carry away. At\r\nhigh water they renewed their exertions to heave the ship off; but were\r\nagain unsuccessful. The leak had by this time gained on the pumps, in\r\nspite of their utmost exertions.\r\n\r\nIt being evident that the ship was irrecoverably lost, the great\r\nobject now was to secure the safety of the passengers and crew. The\r\nmasts were cut away, in order to relieve the vessel, and such spars\r\nas the surf prevented being borne away by the tide, were secured for\r\nthe purpose of making rafts to assist in conveying the passengers on\r\nshore. In order to prevent such scenes of drunkenness as have sometimes\r\ndisgraced shipwrecks, every cask of spirits which could be reached was\r\nstaved.\r\n\r\nTowards evening, a party was sent on shore in the yawl, to prepare\r\na convenient place for landing; and the captain addressed the crew,\r\ndirecting them as to the proper course of procedure on reaching the\r\nshore, and stating his determination to abide by the ship till the\r\nsafety of every person on board was secured. This manly address\r\nreanimated the drooping courage of the crew.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the wind increased, and several of the boats were\r\ndashed in pieces by the violence of the surf. Thus deprived of the\r\nmeans of transporting themselves on shore, and the ship, in the\r\nmeantime, beating with such frightful violence against the rocks, as\r\nthreatened every instant to break her in pieces, they passed a night of\r\nthe greatest consternation and anxiety.\r\n\r\nAs soon as daylight set in, they began to construct rafts, of such\r\nmaterials as they could procure. Three or four of these constructions\r\nleft the ship, carrying about eighty persons, all of whom succeeded in\r\nreaching the shore. In the meantime the breeze continued to freshen,\r\ntill at length it became so violent, that the hawser which held the\r\nship's stern to the wind parted, and she drove with her broadside on\r\nthe rocks, the sea making a complete breach over her. She soon began to\r\nbreak up, when every one crowded to the-quarter-deck and poop, as the\r\nonly place which afforded any chance of safety: in a short time this\r\nretreat also failed, the vessel going completely in pieces. Some of\r\nthese were driven on shore in various places, bearing with them such of\r\nthe crew as had managed to secure a footing upon them; but the gallant\r\ncaptain fell a victim to the waves.\r\n\r\nFor several days, portions of the wreck continued to drift on shore,\r\ngenerally bringing with them some part of the crew. On gathering the\r\nsurvivers together, it was found that the captain, the first mate,\r\nthree young ladies, and forty-eight seamen, had perished. But the\r\ntrials of the survivers were not at an end. The natives, attracted by\r\nthe wreck, flocked to the shore, and, seizing on everything of value\r\nthat had either been saved or was cast on shore, threatened every one\r\nwho opposed them with instant death.\r\n\r\nAt length they reached Tulliar, the residence of the king of Baba, by\r\nwhom they were kindly received. The yawl, which you will recollect had\r\nbeen sent on shore on the evening previous to the breaking up of the\r\nvessel, was then equipped and despatched to Mozambique, to endeavor to\r\nprocure a ship to come to their rescue. After sailing for some days,\r\nthey reached the coast of Africa; but being unable to make head against\r\nthe northerly winds, they were forced to steer for Sofala, a Portuguese\r\nsettlement, where they arrived in safety.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, but a single vessel touched at the settlement in the\r\ncourse of the year; and it had sailed about a month before. Finding\r\nthat there was here no hope of obtaining relief for their companions,\r\nthey again set sail, intending to proceed to Delagoa bay, in the\r\nexpectation of falling in with some of the South Sea ships, which touch\r\nthere annually in considerable numbers. Contrary winds, however, and\r\nthe leaky state of their boat, soon forced them to return to Sofala.\r\nThe governor received them, this time, in a very different manner from\r\nthat which he had shown to them on their former visit, and with little\r\nceremony insisted on the whole party proceeding with his messengers to\r\nSenna, an inland settlement.\r\n\r\nFor five weeks they travelled through a miserable country, very\r\nthinly inhabited, and exposed to the intense heat of the sun, and\r\nmany dangers from the wild beasts with which the country abounds. The\r\nfatigue which they underwent on this journey was too much for several\r\nof the party, who died shortly after their arrival.\r\n\r\nAt length, five months after leaving Madagascar, two of the forty\r\nreached Mozambique. Here they freighted a vessel, and proceeded to\r\nthe rescue of their unfortunate comrades in misfortune. They found\r\nthem in a most melancholy plight. Disease and despair had been at work\r\namong them; nearly one half of those who were saved from the wreck had\r\nperished. The others, emaciated and worn out, were embarked, and, with\r\nthe exception of seven, who expired on the passage, reached Mozambique,\r\nwhere, in spite of every attention which was lavished on them by the\r\ngovernor and the inhabitants, about thirty of them died within two\r\nmonths of their arrival.\r\n\r\nWhen the others were so far recovered as to be able to proceed, they\r\nagain hired a vessel to carry them to Madras; but, before they reached\r\nit, the ship was captured by a French privateer. Part of the crew the\r\nprivateer took on board their own ship, and put a number of their men\r\ninto the captured vessel, with orders to proceed to the Mauritius\r\nwith all possible speed. The privateer then continued her cruise,\r\nand in a few days falling in with a Dutch East Indiaman, engaged\r\nwith her; but the Dutchmen proving victors, the remains of the crew\r\nof the unfortunate Winterton were once more set at liberty. They at\r\nlength reached Madras; whence they sailed for England in the Scorpion\r\nsloop-of-war.\r\n\r\nPoor fellows! they seem to have been very unlucky, Uncle Thomas. The\r\nrest of the crew, who were carried to the Mauritius, did they get home\r\nin safety also, Uncle Thomas?\r\n\r\nOh, I had almost forgotten to tell you about them, Frank. They never\r\nreached England; nor could the least intelligence be heard of them,\r\nthough the East India Company caused the most diligent inquiries to be\r\nmade after them.\r\n\r\nDo you think they were again shipwrecked, Uncle Thomas?\r\n\r\nThat I won't say: but I rather fear there was foul play somewhere.\r\nWithout some certain grounds to go upon, however, it is useless to\r\nconjecture. So I must bid you good night.\r\n\r\nGood night, Uncle Thomas!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nUNCLE THOMAS TELLS ABOUT THE LOSS OF THE ROYAL GEORGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerilous as is the life of a sailor, boys, during the raging of the\r\nstorm, or when far at sea in the middle of the trackless ocean, he\r\nis still exposed to danger even when his ship rides at anchor in the\r\nfancied security of some friendly port. I dare say you have all heard\r\nof the loss of the Royal George, one of the first-rate ships in the\r\nBritish navy, which sank off Spithead, fifty-six years ago. The sudden\r\nand unexpected event, and the vast number of persons who fell victims,\r\ncaused the greatest excitement at the time.\r\n\r\nI have often heard of the loss of the Royal George, Uncle Thomas, but\r\nI never could get any information about it. Will you have the goodness\r\nto tell us about it?\r\n\r\nWith pleasure, boys. The vessel had just returned from a cruise, in\r\nwhich it was found that she leaked more than usual, and as the leakage\r\ncontinued even after she came into harbor, an order was issued by\r\nthe Admiralty that she should go into dock to repair. After a strict\r\nsurvey, however, by the carpenter and others, it was found that the\r\nleak was not more than two feet below the watermark, and supposing it\r\nto be occasioned by the rubbing off of the copper sheathing, it was\r\nresolved, in order to save time, to lay her down at Spithead, by what\r\nis called a parliament heel; that is, by means of ropes attached to the\r\nmasts, to pull her over so much to one side as to expose the other\r\nabove water. In the meantime it was discovered that the pipe, which\r\noccasionally admitted the water to cleanse and sweeten the ship, was\r\nout of order, and that it was necessary to replace it with a new one.\r\nAs the vessel required to be heeled very much for this purpose, the\r\ngreater part of the guns were removed from one side to the other; but\r\nas she was not expected to heel so much as she did, they neglected to\r\nstop the scuppers of the lower decks, so that the water coming in on\r\ndeck, gradually gained upon them, and the vessel thus for some time\r\nstole down imperceptibly.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the greater part of the crew were at dinner; but\r\nthe carpenters and caulkers continued at their work, and had almost\r\nfinished it, when a sudden squall took the ship on the raised side,\r\nand the lower deck ports to leeward being open, the water rushed in.\r\nAs soon as the dangerous situation of the vessel was discovered, they\r\nbeat to arms to right the ship, but in vain: in less than eight minutes\r\nshe fell flat on one side, filled with water, and the guns, shot, &c.,\r\nfalling from the other side, accelerated her descent. She sunk to the\r\nbottom so rapidly that no signal of distress could be made; nor indeed\r\ncould any assistance have availed if there had, for after her lower\r\nports were fairly in the water, no power on earth could have prevented\r\nher from going to the bottom.\r\n\r\nAt this fatal moment there were nearly twelve hundred persons on board,\r\nincluding about two hundred and fifty women and several children,\r\nchiefly belonging to the seamen, who had been permitted to remain on\r\nboard until the order for sailing arrived. The people who formed the\r\nwatch upon deck, including their friends, amounting in all to about\r\ntwo hundred and thirty, were mostly saved by the boats, which the\r\nships lying near the Royal George manned and sent to their assistance,\r\nwith the utmost expedition, when they observed the vessel was sinking.\r\nTheir assistance was, however, for some time necessarily delayed, as\r\nthe swell occasioned by the sinking of such a large body produced a\r\ntemporary whirlpool, which rendered approach impossible; a victualling\r\nsloop indeed, which lay alongside the Royal George, was drawn into\r\nthe vortex, and seven of her crew were drowned. The boats also picked\r\nup about seventy more, who rose to the surface after the ship had\r\ndisappeared, among whom were four lieutenants, eleven women, and the\r\nremainder seamen.\r\n\r\nAmong the officers thus snatched from the brink of eternity, was\r\nLieutenant Durham, who, being officer of the watch, was upon deck at\r\nthe time when he observed the vessel going down. He had just time to\r\nthrow off his coat and scramble on the beam, from which he was washed\r\nas the ship sunk, and left floating about among men and hammocks. A\r\ndrowning marine caught him by the waistcoat, and held him so fast, that\r\nseveral times he was drawn under water. It was in vain to reason with\r\na man struggling for life; and conscious of the certainty of neither\r\nbeing saved, if he did not disentangle himself from his burden, he\r\nclung with his legs round a hammock, and with one hand unbuttoning\r\nhis waistcoat and sloping his shoulder, committed it, with the\r\nunfortunate marine, to the remorseless deep. He then got to some of the\r\ntop rigging, where a boat soon afterwards came to him, but he nobly\r\ndeclined the assistance offered, and pointing out to them where Captain\r\nWaghorne was in great danger, he desired them to go to his relief: the\r\ngallant youth was at length taken up and conveyed in safety to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nThe preservation of another young man, named Henry Bishop, was effected\r\nin a very extraordinary manner. He was on the lower deck at the time of\r\nthe fatal accident, and as the vessel filled, the force of the water\r\nhurried him, almost insensibly, up the hatchway, when, at the instant,\r\nhe was met by one of the guns which fell from the middle deck, which\r\nstriking him on his left hand, broke three of his fingers; in a few\r\nseconds, however, he found himself floating on the surface of the\r\nwater, and was providentially picked up by one of the boats.\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made by the boats of the fleet to save the crew; but\r\nthey were able to pick up only Captain Waghorne, a few officers, and\r\nabout three hundred people. By this dreadful and unlooked-for accident,\r\nnearly nine hundred persons lost their lives; among whom was Admiral\r\nKempenfelt, whose flag was then flying on board the Royal George, and\r\nwhose loss was universally lamented. Besides the Admiral, who was in\r\nhis cabin writing when the sudden disaster happened, every one who was\r\nbetween the decks perished with her. Captain Waghorne, the Admiral's\r\nfirst captain, was, fortunately, on deck; but his son, who was a\r\nlieutenant on board, was drowned.\r\n\r\nThe water must have been very deep, Uncle Thomas, to cover such a large\r\nvessel. But I suppose she lay on her side.\r\n\r\nNo, Harry, she did not: a great number of persons were saved by\r\nclimbing on the topsail yards, which remained above water after the\r\nvessel reached the bottom. She very soon righted herself, and the tops\r\nof her masts were visible so late as 1799; part of her hull even might\r\nthen be seen at low water.\r\n\r\nCould not the Royal George be got up again, Uncle Thomas? I should have\r\nthought that, being quite sound and in still water, she might have been\r\nweighed.\r\n\r\nSeveral attempts were made to weigh her, Frank; but they were all\r\nunsuccessful. Her anchor and some of her guns were, however, recovered\r\nby means of diving bells. Her anchor was the heaviest ever made--it\r\nweighed ninety-eight hundred weight.\r\n\r\nIn the churchyard at Portsea, an elegant monument was erected to the\r\nmemory of the brave Admiral Kempenfelt and his fellow-sufferers. On it\r\nis engraved this impressive admonition:--\r\n\r\n\"Reader! with solemn thought survey this grave, and reflect on the\r\nuntimely death of thy fellow-mortals; and whilst, as a man, a Briton,\r\nand a patriot, thou readest the melancholy narrative, drop a tear\r\nfor thy country's loss. On the twenty-ninth day of August, 1782, his\r\nMajesty's ship, the Royal George, being on the heel at Spithead,\r\noverset and sunk: by which fatal accident about nine hundred persons\r\nwere instantly launched into eternity; among whom was that brave and\r\nexperienced officer, Rear Admiral Kempenfelt. Nine days after, many\r\nof the bodies of the unfortunate floated; thirty-five of whom were\r\ninterred in one grave, near this monument, which is erected by the\r\nparish of Portsea, as a grateful tribute to the memory of that great\r\ncommander and his fellow-sufferers.\"\r\n\r\nGood night, Uncle Thomas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nUNCLE THOMAS TELLS ABOUT THE WRECK OF THE STEAMERS KILLARNEY AND\r\nFORFARSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood evening, boys! The sudden and unexpected disappearance of the\r\nRoyal George, though, from the size of the vessel, and the number of\r\nlives which were lost on the occasion, an event sufficiently appalling,\r\nis yet frequently outdone, in intensity of suffering, by cases of\r\nshipwreck which happen on our coasts. To-night, I am going to tell you\r\nabout the loss of two steam vessels, both of which afford remarkable\r\ninstances of extreme suffering.\r\n\r\nThe first is that of the Killarney, a small steamer of about two\r\nhundred tons burthen, which sailed between Cork and Bristol. She left\r\nthe quay at Cork, on the morning of Friday, January 19, 1838, having on\r\nboard twenty-one passengers, and twenty-two persons belonging to the\r\nvessel. Her cargo consisted of about one hundred tons of goods, and six\r\nhundred and fifty pigs, part of which were in the fore hold, and the\r\nrest on deck.\r\n\r\nSoon after she had left the harbor she encountered a gale, and the\r\nnumber of pigs causing her to dip considerably, she shipped several\r\nseas, which alarmed the passengers so much, that they prevailed on the\r\ncaptain to put back.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, the wind having somewhat moderated, the captain,\r\ncontrary to the wishes of the passengers, resumed his voyage. The\r\nvessel had, however, scarcely left the harbor, when the wind again\r\nrose, and kept increasing till it blew a gale. This continued until\r\nmidnight, the vessel rolling dreadfully, and every wave that struck\r\nher causing her to dip so deeply, that she shipped several seas. A\r\ngreat quantity of water poured down into the fore hold, the hatches\r\nhaving been left open in order to admit the air to the pigs which were\r\nconfined in it.\r\n\r\nAs matters began to wear a threatening aspect, the captain requested\r\nthat every person on board would assist in throwing overboard the pigs\r\nwhich were on deck, which crowded to the lee-side of the vessel so as\r\nalmost to render her unmanageable. They found this, however, a matter\r\nof great difficulty, and were able thus to dispose of a very small\r\nnumber only.\r\n\r\nThe sea, in the meantime, continued to wash over the deck, and to pour\r\ninto the hold. Up to four o'clock, on Saturday morning, they managed,\r\nby means of pumps which were worked by the engine, to get rid of this\r\nwater; but about that hour some small coal got into the pumps and\r\nchoked them. The water then rose rapidly, until it reached the level of\r\nthe engine-fire, when it rushed in, and at once extinguished it. The\r\nengine no longer moved, and all was given up for lost.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes of abandonment to despair, the sailors, and part\r\nof the passengers, seizing buckets, began to endeavor to lighten the\r\nvessel of some of the water in the hold, and after several hours of\r\nhard labor, they so far gained upon it as to enable them once more to\r\nlight the fire, and to get the steam partly up again. They were at this\r\ntime utterly ignorant of where they were, or whither they were going,\r\nfor the fog was so dense that no object was visible. They endeavored\r\nto keep the vessel's head to the wind, but, after some time, they\r\nfound they were going to leeward. The jibsail was then set, in order\r\nto keep her steady, but no sooner was it run out than it was blown\r\ninto ribbons. About three o'clock the fog cleared away, and they saw\r\nland behind them, but no one could tell with certainty what part of\r\nthe coast it was. It was then blowing a complete hurricane; the shore\r\nwas covered with rocks, and they saw that, if they drifted towards it,\r\ndestruction was inevitable. By the captain's orders, the mainsail was\r\nset, and the engine-men were directed to do their utmost to get up the\r\nsteam, in order to keep her off. The steam, unfortunately, was so weak\r\nas to be of no assistance--it scarcely moved the crank; and the sail\r\nhad to be hauled down, lest it should throw the vessel on her beam\r\nends. The staysail was then tried, in the hope that it would enable\r\nthem to round the point; but the storm was so violent that they could\r\nnot haul it out.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was in the meantime drifting nearer to the rock on which she\r\nultimately struck. After great exertions they succeeded in turning her\r\nround, to endeavor to make for a bay which promised a place of safety.\r\nJust as they had succeeded in getting her before the wind, she was,\r\nhowever, pooped by a tremendous sea, which carried away the taffrail,\r\nthe wheel, and the two men who worked it, the companion, the binnacle,\r\nand the breakwater. The men fortunately caught part of the rigging,\r\nand were saved; but the sea carried away the bulwarks, with some of\r\nthe steerage passengers who were standing near the funnel, and at once\r\ncleared the deck of all the pigs.\r\n\r\nWhen the vessel was nearing the rock, and before she put about, the\r\nsteward went down to call the cabin passengers on deck. They were\r\non their way up when the sea passed over the vessel. A second wave\r\nsucceeded almost immediately, and scarcely had two of them stepped on\r\nthe quarter-deck when they were hurried overboard. These two seas had\r\nthe effect of bringing the head of the vessel somewhat to windward\r\nagain, when a third wave rapidly succeeded, and drove her on the\r\nrock. It was then between four and five o'clock. The first stroke\r\nshe gave, the carpenter jumped on the rock; he was followed by one\r\nof the passengers, but the landing-place was so narrow that there\r\nwas not room for both, and the latter fell into the water and was\r\ndrowned. After striking, the vessel receded; she soon struck again, and\r\ncontinued receding and striking for some time, during which some of the\r\nsailors, the first mate, and the captain landed. When the latter got\r\non the rock, a rope was thrown to him and the mate, that they might\r\nendeavor to keep the vessel to the rock. Most of the sailors and some\r\nof the passengers were saved in this way, one only landing at a time.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the vessel, the steward scrambled along the deck to look\r\nfor Mrs. Lawe, one of the passengers, who had distinguished herself\r\nby her calmness, and the firm reliance she placed on a protecting\r\nProvidence. He found her near the funnel, calm and collected; with\r\nsome difficulty he brought her to the quarter-gallery, and loosing\r\nthe rope, he handed it to her, directing her to take hold of it, and,\r\nwhen the vessel next struck, to leap into the sea, and they would\r\ndrag her to the rock. She did so, and was drawn up part of the way,\r\nbut having quitted her hold of the rope, she was carried away by the\r\nreceding wave, and never seen again. The steward leaped almost at the\r\nsame moment, and was saved. The last persons who left the vessel were\r\na sailor and a woman--the latter supposed to be the stewardess. She\r\nappeared to be insensible; and the sailor, who seemed to have brought\r\nher from the cabin, had her in his arms. He leaped from the vessel, and\r\nreached the rock, the woman under one arm; but the footing was narrow,\r\nand the rock was shelving. He had room for little more than his toes,\r\nand was obliged to endeavor to hold on with the fingers of one hand,\r\nbut the weight of the woman inclining him backwards, they fell into the\r\nsea, and both were drowned.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which some of the lives were lost was peculiarly\r\naffecting. A medical gentleman, one of the passengers, had his little\r\nson in his arms, soothing and supporting him, and when the vessel\r\nstruck, he flung him with all his strength towards the rock. The child\r\nreached it in safety, though the violence of the effort nearly carried\r\nthe father overboard. When the latter gained the rock, he again took\r\nhim in his arms, and, by clasping him closely, endeavored to keep him\r\nwarm. \"Kiss me, papa,\" said the little fellow, \"we shall soon meet\r\nno more.\" The child was right. In a few minutes he got on his feet,\r\nventured a short distance from his father's side, and slipping from the\r\nrock, was at once swallowed up by the raging deep.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the steward loosed the rope to give it to Mrs. Lawe, the\r\nvessel having nothing to confine her, swung round, and the next sea\r\nthat struck her drove her against the rock; her deck opened, she\r\ndivided into two, fore and aft, and every one who remained on board\r\nperished. In an hour after, with the exception of the engine and the\r\npaddle-wheel, not a vestige of the vessel or of her machinery was\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nThere were now about twenty-five persons on the rock. The sailors had\r\ncontrived to clamber to a sheltered side, but the situation of the\r\npassengers was pitiable in the extreme. One who had on but a shirt and\r\nwaistcoat, was seated astride on a projection of the rock, his face\r\ntowards the sea. Under him was another, his back to the sea, his toes\r\nresting on a narrow ledge, and his fingers clinging in a crevice; while\r\nclose beside them were others equally exposed and equally helpless.\r\n\r\nThe persons on the side next the land observing some country\r\npeople--about eighteen or twenty--on the shore, shouted to them, hoping\r\nto attract their attention, but there was no answer. The probability\r\nis, that the sound never reached the land, as they saw the people\r\nsubsequently descend and carry off some of the pigs that had been\r\nwashed ashore. Night came on. About eleven o'clock the wind rose and\r\nblew terrifically, but, even amid the raging of the storm, a startling\r\nshriek was now and then heard, as one after another, unable longer to\r\nmaintain their hold, fell into the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen morning broke, the survivers clambered to the sheltered side of\r\nthe rock. As they had now been discovered by the people on shore,\r\ngreat exertions were made to relieve them; but, as the storm continued\r\nunabated, it was found impossible to reach the rock. Ducks with ropes\r\nfastened to them were sent out; only one arrived, and that they were\r\nunable to catch. Wire was attached to bullets, and rope to the wire,\r\nand sundry shots were fired; but this means also was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Sunday was spent in a variety of experiments to convey a\r\nrope to the rock, without success. The feelings of the sufferers it\r\nwould be impossible to describe, and their agony, when they saw the\r\nattempt to rescue them abandoned--when darkness settled down upon the\r\ndeep, and they could no longer distinguish the figures of the persons\r\non the cliff above them, it would not be easy to imagine. Their sole\r\nsustenance, during the two tedious days and nights which they had\r\npassed since the wreck, was a little salt water and the few scraps of\r\nseaweed that they could gather from one of the bleakest and most barren\r\nrocks on the coast. The night, however, was not so tempestuous as the\r\npreceding, and at daylight the shore was once more crowded by persons,\r\nall anxious to lend their assistance.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, Captain Manby's life-preserving apparatus was\r\nbrought to their assistance, but the same difficulty was experienced\r\nin reaching the rock with the rope. Shots were again fired from\r\nguns and small cannon brought for the purpose, but without success.\r\nAt length, a plan, which had been unsuccessful on the preceding day,\r\nsucceeded, and about eleven o'clock two loaves of bread, and a little\r\nwine and spirits, were lowered to them--the first they had partaken of\r\nsince Friday. After refreshing themselves, they were hauled up, one\r\nby one. Of the forty-three persons who embarked on Friday morning,\r\nthirteen only escaped, and of these one died soon after their rescue.\r\n\r\nDreadful, Uncle Thomas! I wonder they were not all starved to death,\r\nexposed as they were to the cold of two January nights.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed surprising, Harry, that any of them escaped. Some of them\r\nwere nearly destitute of clothing. I told you of one of the passengers\r\nwho was all but naked, and the woman who escaped passed the time on the\r\nrock with only her night-dress and a small handkerchief to cover her.\r\n\r\nThe other wreck, of which I promised to tell you this evening, is that\r\nof the Forfarshire, also a steamer, which sailed between Hull and\r\nDundee. She left Hull on the evening of Wednesday, September 5th, 1838,\r\nhaving on board a valuable cargo, and upwards of forty passengers. Her\r\ncrew consisted of twenty-one persons; the captain's wife accompanied\r\nhim on the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe Forfarshire had not proceeded far when a leak was discovered in\r\nthe boiler. This rendered it necessary to extinguish two of the fires,\r\nwhich were, however, relighted when the boiler had been partially\r\nrepaired. The vessel continued her course until the following evening,\r\nby which time she had proceeded as far as Berwick Bay, when the\r\nleak again appeared. It had now become so great, that the greatest\r\ndifficulty was experienced in keeping the boilers filled, the water\r\nescaping through the leak as fast as it was pumped in. The wind was\r\nblowing strong and the sea running high, and the leak increased so much\r\nfrom the motion of the vessel, that the fires were extinguished, and\r\nthe engines, of course, became entirely useless. It was now about ten\r\no'clock at night, and they were off St. Abbs' Head, a bold promontory\r\non the Scottish coast. There being great danger of drifting ashore, the\r\nsails were hoisted fore and aft, and the vessel put about in order to\r\nget her before the wind, and keep her off the land. She soon became\r\nunmanageable, and the tide setting strong to the south, she proceeded\r\nin that direction. It rained heavily during the whole time, and the fog\r\nwas so dense that it became impossible to tell the situation of the\r\nvessel. At length breakers were discovered close to leeward, and the\r\nFerne Lights, which about the same period became visible, put an end\r\nto all doubt as to the imminent peril of the unfortunate vessel. An\r\nattempt was made to run her between the Ferne Islands, but she refused\r\nto obey the helm, and at three o'clock on Friday morning, she struck\r\nwith tremendous force against the outer or Longstone Island.\r\n\r\nAt the moment the vessel struck, most of the passengers were below,\r\nand many of them asleep in their berths. One, alarmed by the shock,\r\nstarted up, and seizing his trousers only, rushed upon deck. When he\r\nreached it, he found everything in confusion, and seeing part of the\r\ncrew hoisting out a boat, he sprang into it. The raging of the sea\r\ninstantly separated it from the vessel, and though several of the other\r\npassengers attempted to reach it, they were unsuccessful, and perished\r\nin the attempt. The boat itself escaped by something little short of a\r\nmiracle. There was but one outlet by which it could avoid being dashed\r\nin pieces on the breakers by which it was surrounded. This outlet it\r\nprovidentially took without its crew being aware of it; and after being\r\nexposed to the storm all night, it was picked up by a sloop and carried\r\ninto Shields.\r\n\r\nIn less than five minutes after the vessel struck, a second shock\r\nseparated her into two parts--the stern, quarter-deck, and cabin\r\nbeing instantly borne away, through a passage called the Piper Gut,\r\nby a tremendous current, which runs with considerable violence even\r\nin temperate weather--with a rapidity of about six miles an hour--but\r\nwhich, when the weather is tempestuous, flows with a force truly\r\nterrific.\r\n\r\nThe fore part of the vessel, in the meantime, remained fast on the\r\nrock, and to it still clung the few passengers who remained, every\r\ninstant expecting to share the fate of their unfortunate companions,\r\nwhom they had seen swept away by the raging element. In this dreadful\r\nsituation their cries attracted the notice of Grace Darling, the\r\ndaughter of the keeper of the Outer Ferne Lighthouse. With a noble\r\nheroism, she immediately determined to attempt their rescue, in spite\r\nof the raging of the storm, and the all but certain destruction which\r\nthreatened to attend it.\r\n\r\nHaving hastily awakened her father, he launched his boat at day-break,\r\nand, with a generous sympathy worthy of the father of Grace Darling,\r\nprepared to proceed to their rescue. The gale, in the meantime,\r\ncontinued unabated, and the boiling of the waves threatened a speedy\r\ndestruction to their frail boat. It was therefore with a heart full\r\nof the most fearful forebodings, that he undertook the perilous\r\nenterprise. After watching the wreck for some time, they discovered\r\nthat living beings were still clinging to it, and the gallant young\r\nwoman, with matchless intrepidity, seized an oar and entered the\r\nboat. This was enough--her father followed; and, with the assistance\r\nof his daughter, conducted the frail skiff over the foaming billows\r\nto the spot where the wreck appeared. By a dangerous and desperate\r\neffort he was landed on the rock, and to preserve the frail boat from\r\nbeing dashed to pieces, it was rapidly rowed back among the awful\r\nabyss of waters, and kept afloat by the skilfulness and dexterity of\r\nthis noble-minded young woman. At length the whole of the survivers,\r\nconsisting of five of the crew and four of the passengers, were\r\ntaken from the wreck, and conveyed to the light-house, where she\r\nministered to their wants, and anxiously, for three days and three\r\nnights, waited on the sufferers, and soothed their afflictions. This\r\nperilous achievement, unexampled in the feats of female fortitude, was\r\nwitnessed by the survivers in silent wonder. The weather continued so\r\ntempestuous that the mainland could not be reached till Sunday, when\r\nthe nine persons, saved by the gallant heroism of the Darlings, were\r\nlanded in safety; thus making the entire number of persons saved from\r\nthe wreck eighteen. All the others perished.\r\n\r\nThose who found refuge on the rock on which the vessel struck, suffered\r\nseverely during the night from the cold and the heavy seas which, at\r\nintervals, washed over them. The female passenger, who escaped, sat\r\nwith her two children, a boy and a girl, the one eight and the other\r\neleven years of age, firmly grasped in each hand, long after the\r\nbuffetings of the waves had deprived them of existence. The captain and\r\nhis wife were washed from the wreck, clasped in each other's arms, and\r\nboth drowned.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a noble act, Uncle Thomas! I wonder she was not afraid\r\nthat her boat would share the fate of the steam-vessel, and be dashed\r\nin pieces on the rock.\r\n\r\nIt was an act of heroism, boys, to which you will find few parallels;\r\nnor has it been without its reward. Besides the satisfaction of saving\r\nnine fellow-creatures from certain destruction, the fame of the heroic\r\nact has spread far and wide, and its praise been on every tongue.\r\nPainters, of no mean power, have portrayed the scene, and its memory\r\nwill be thus preserved. Presents have besides poured in upon her and\r\nher father, and everything been done to mark the public sympathy and\r\napprobation of the daring and disinterested deed.\r\n\r\nA coroner's inquest was held on the bodies of four of the sufferers,\r\nwhich were washed ashore. The jury returned a verdict \"Wrecked on\r\nboard the Forfarshire steam-packet, by the imperfection of her boilers,\r\nand the culpable negligence of the captain in not putting back to port.\"\r\n\r\nWas the vessel completely destroyed, Uncle Thomas?\r\n\r\nThe only part of the vessel which remained, Harry, consisted of the\r\nforecastle, part of the engine, the paddle-wheels, and part of the\r\nrigging. One of the boilers was thrown upon the rock, the other\r\ndisappeared in the sea. Of the valuable cargo, a few boxes of soap only\r\nwere recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nUNCLE THOMAS TELLS ABOUT THE WRECK OF THE ALBION NEW YORK PACKET.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the tales of shipwrecks which have happened on our shores, are\r\nextremely distressing; none more so, perhaps, than that of the Albion\r\npacket, which was wrecked on the Irish coast, in 1822.\r\n\r\nThe Albion was one of the first-class packet ships between New York\r\nand Liverpool, and sailed from the former place on the first of April,\r\nhaving on board twenty-three cabin and six steerage passengers, her\r\ncrew consisting of twenty-five persons; making the entire number\r\nwho embarked fifty-four. For the first twenty days the voyage was\r\nprosperous and pleasant. About two o'clock on Sunday the 21st, they\r\nmade Cape Clear, and the weather, which had, during the earlier part of\r\nthe voyage, been moderate and favorable, now became thick and foggy,\r\nthe wind blowing fresh, with heavy squalls from the southward. The ship\r\nhad been carrying all her canvass, but as the gale increased they were\r\nobliged to shorten sail. At four o'clock, they were under double-reefed\r\ntopsails, foresail, and mainsail, when a sudden squall carried away the\r\nfore-yard and split the fore-topsail. They therefore got the broken\r\nyard down, and prepared to replace it by another.\r\n\r\nAs night came on, the decks were cleared for working the ship; the\r\nwind, however, lulled, and it was supposed that the storm of the day\r\nwas over. As they were near the coast, all hands flattered themselves\r\nthey should, in a short time, reach their destined harbor, and be once\r\nmore secure from the dangers of the deep. About nine o'clock, the ship\r\nwas struck by a tremendous sea, which threw her on her beam-ends, and\r\ncarried away the mainmast by the board, the heads of the mizenmast\r\nand fore-topmast, sweeping the deck clear of everything, including\r\nboats, caboose-house, and bulwarks, and staving in all the hatches, and\r\nstate-rooms, and nearly filling the cabin with water. It also carried\r\naway six of the crew and one of the cabin passengers, and, in short, so\r\ndestructive was its influence, that it left the Albion in the state of\r\na wreck.\r\n\r\nAs the ship now became unmanageable, and the sea continued to make a\r\ncomplete breach over her, both crew and passengers were obliged to\r\nlash themselves to the pumps, in order to keep themselves from being\r\nwashed away while working them. All who were unnecessary or unable to\r\nafford assistance on deck retired below, but the water was knee-deep in\r\nthe cabin, and the furniture floating about rendered their situation\r\ndangerous and dreadful. On deck they were in total darkness, and having\r\nno correct compasses, they could not tell how the ship's head lay.\r\n\r\nAbout one o'clock in the morning of the 22d, they made the light of\r\nthe Old Head of Kinsale, a light-house on the Irish coast, but could\r\nnot ascertain its bearing, and at two o'clock they found the ship\r\nembayed. All night long the wind had blown directly on shore, towards\r\nwhich the vessel was drifting at the rate of about three miles an\r\nhour. The complete hopelessness of their situation was known to few\r\non board; but to Captain Williams the coast was familiar, and he must\r\nhave seen, in despair and horror, throughout the night, the certainty\r\nof their fate. At length the noise of the ocean roaring and dashing\r\nupon the rocky and precipitous shore, spoke too plainly of the fate\r\nthat awaited them. The captain, seeing that the crisis was now close\r\nat hand, and that the wreck of the vessel was inevitable, summoned all\r\nthe passengers on deck, and briefly told them that each must prepare\r\nto save himself, as the ship must soon strike--it was impossible to\r\npreserve her. The scene was one of the most touching description; many\r\nof them had received considerable injury when the sea first struck the\r\nship, and were scarcely able to come on deck; others were completely\r\nexhausted from having been incessantly assisting at the pumps; and one\r\ngentleman, who had been extremely ill during the voyage, Mr. William\r\nEverhart, of Chester, Pennsylvania, was too feeble to crawl to the\r\ndeck without assistance, though, strange to say, he was the only cabin\r\npassenger who was saved.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the passengers on board the Albion was, at this\r\nmoment, one of peculiar agony, as they watched, without the power\r\nof resistance, the deadly and relentless blast impelling them to\r\ndestruction--the ship a wreck--and the raging of the billows against\r\nthe precipice on which they were driving, sending back from the\r\nrocky caverns the hoarse and melancholy warnings of death. In such a\r\nsituation, the stoutest heart must have quailed with utter despair.\r\n\r\nAs the morning dawned, the Albion struck on a reef, her upper-works\r\nbeat in over the rocks, and in about half an hour she parted midships,\r\nher quarter-deck drifting on the top of the inside ledge, immediately\r\nunder the cliffs. The perpendicular precipice of rocks, under which the\r\nunfortunate vessel struck, is nearly two hundred feet in height, in\r\nthe base of which, the sea beating for ages, has worn large caverns,\r\ninto which the waves rush violently, sending back a deep and hollow\r\nsound; after striking against the rock, they are thrown back in various\r\ndirections, forming whirlpools of great violence. For some distance\r\nfrom the precipice, rocks rise out of the water, broad at bottom, and\r\nsharp at top: on one of these the Albion first struck; the next wave\r\nthrew her farther on the rock, the third farther still, until, nearly\r\nbalanced, she swung round, and her stern was driven against another,\r\ncloser in shore.\r\n\r\nIn this perilous situation, every wave making a complete breach over\r\nher, many of the passengers and crew were drowned on deck. Captain\r\nWilliams, worn out with the extraordinary exertions which, up to the\r\nlast moment, he continued to make for the preservation of the lives of\r\nthe unfortunate passengers and crew, was, with several others, swept\r\naway soon after the vessel struck.\r\n\r\nA short time before she parted, the mate and six of the crew managed to\r\ngain a rock, but so exhausted were they by their previous exertions,\r\nand by the dashing of the waves, which every instant washed over\r\nthem, that the mate was washed off; fortunately, however, he regained\r\nhis position before the return of the sea. So exhausted was he,\r\nthat before he could attempt to climb the rock, which was nearly\r\nperpendicular, he was obliged to lie down to recover strength from\r\nthe severe bruises and contusions which he had received. One of the\r\npassengers also reached the rock alive, but, together with one of the\r\nstewards, he was washed off and drowned.\r\n\r\nPerceiving that the stern was higher out of water than the fore part\r\nof the wreck, and the sea had less power in its sweep over it, Mr.\r\nEverhart went aft. He now saw that the bottom had been broken out\r\nof the ship. The heavy articles must have sunk, and the cotton and\r\nlighter articles were floating around, dashed by every wave against the\r\nrocks. Presently the ship broke in two, and all who remained near the\r\nbow were lost. Several had got on the side of the precipice from the\r\nstern of the ship, and were hanging by the crags. Although weakened by\r\nprevious sickness and present suffering, Mr. Everhart made an effort\r\nand got upon the rock, and stood upon one foot, which was the only\r\nhold he could obtain. He saw several of his fellow-sufferers around\r\nhim, and, among the rest, Colonel Prevost, who, on seeing him take his\r\nstation, remarked, \"Here is another poor fellow,\" But the waves rolling\r\nheavily against them, and often dashing the spray fifty feet above\r\ntheir heads, gradually swept them away, one after another. One of the\r\nsailors, losing his hold, attempted to grasp Mr. Everhart's leg, and\r\nnearly pulled him from his place. Weak and ill as he was, however, he\r\ncontrived to retain his position, and stood for several hours on one\r\nfoot on a little crag, the billows dashing over him, and quite benumbed\r\nwith cold.\r\n\r\nBy day-light, the wreck having been discovered, as soon as the ebbing\r\nof the tide rendered it practicable, the country people descended the\r\nrocks as far as they could, and dropped Mr. Everhart a rope, which he\r\nfastened round his body, and was drawn up to a place of safety. Of\r\ntwenty-three cabin passengers he alone escaped.\r\n\r\nMany of the passengers who were lost in this melancholy shipwreck, held\r\ndistinguished stations in society. The most eminent sufferer was Gen.\r\nLefebvre Desnouettes, who, during a long series of years, had braved\r\ndeath in the field of battle, and escaped to perish at last in this\r\ncatastrophe, when his mind was, perhaps, less than at any other period\r\nof his life, reconciled to the stroke of fate. His situation was every\r\nway peculiar. It is well known that he had been one of the favorite\r\nand most distinguished of Napoleon's military generals, and that he\r\ntook part in the combination against Louis XVIII. On the landing of\r\nhis old commander from Elba, with headlong enthusiasm he joined him\r\nin his last campaign, and being proscribed by the royal government,\r\ntook refuge in the United States. Here his misfortunes, reputation,\r\nintelligence, and manly, unexceptionable deportment, rendered him an\r\nobject of universal esteem. To escape, as he used to remark, pity\r\nand curiosity, and to gratify the natural activity of his mind, he\r\nretired to the territory granted to the French exiles in the State of\r\nAlabama, where he labored in the fields, under the burning sun, with\r\na reckless exertion, which proved very injurious to his health. His\r\nwife, an amiable and accomplished woman, remained behind in France to\r\nlook after his interests there. Having begun his agricultural toil, he\r\nnever quitted it until his final departure from the country, except to\r\nvisit Washington on business. At length, he addressed a petition to the\r\nFrench government, praying to be allowed to return home. He received\r\ndirections to proceed to Holland, and there wait the final pleasure of\r\nthe king; and, on his way to Liverpool, met with a watery grave on the\r\nIrish coast.\r\n\r\nIt is a very affecting tale indeed, Uncle Thomas! How shocking to think\r\nthat, after crossing the Atlantic ocean in safety, they should perish\r\nwhen almost within sight of home!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nUNCLE THOMAS TELLS OF THE LOSS OF THE DODDINGTON EAST INDIAMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis evening, boys, I am going to tell you of the loss of the\r\nDoddington, which was wrecked on a barren, uninhabited rock, when\r\nnearly two hundred persons lost their lives.\r\n\r\nThe Doddington sailed from the Downs, April 23d, 1755, in company with\r\nfour others of the East India Company's ships. On the 20th of May, they\r\nmade Bonavista, one of the Cape de Verd Islands, and on the 21st got\r\ninto Port Prior Bay, for the purpose of taking in a supply of fresh\r\nwater. On the 27th, she proceeded on her voyage, in company with three\r\nof the vessels with which she had at first set out, leaving the other,\r\nwhich had not yet completed her refitment, in the roads. They continued\r\ntogether until the following day, when the Captain, thinking that their\r\ncourse was too easterly, ordered the Doddington to be kept south; and\r\nafter a fine run of seven weeks, she made the land of the Cape of Good\r\nHope.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of July, they took their departure from Cape Needles, and\r\nthe vessel having steered eastward about twenty-four hours, the Captain\r\nordered her to be kept E. N. E. In this course she continued till about\r\na quarter before one on the morning of Thursday the 17th of July, when\r\nshe struck.\r\n\r\nThe officer whose journal furnishes materials for the following\r\nnarrative, was, at the time of the accident, asleep in his cabin; but\r\nbeing suddenly awakened by the shock, he started up in the utmost\r\nconsternation, and hurried upon deck. He found the sea rolling over the\r\nship with the utmost violence, and sweeping the men overboard, while\r\nthe beating of the surge upon the vessel threatened, every instant, to\r\ndash her in pieces. On reaching the larboard side of the deck, which\r\nlay highest out of the water, he encountered the Captain, who told\r\nhim in a very little time they must all perish; in a few minutes a\r\nsea parted them, and he saw him no more. He managed, by dint of great\r\nexertion, to get back to the quarter-deck, though he was much bruised\r\nand had the small bone of his left arm broken; the other portion of\r\nthe ship was, in the meantime, overwhelmed by the waves and completely\r\nshattered in pieces.\r\n\r\nIn this dreadful situation, when every minute he expected would be the\r\nlast of all who still clung to the wreck, he heard the welcome cry\r\nof \"Land!\" and looked eagerly about him; but though he saw something\r\nwhich he supposed had been taken for land, he believed that it was\r\nonly the bursting of the surge on the other side of the breakers. At\r\nthis instant, the sea broke over him with such fury, that it not only\r\nforced him from his hold, but such was the violence of the blow, that\r\nhe was stunned, and lay insensible till after daylight. On recovering,\r\nhe found himself fixed to a plank by a nail that had been forced into\r\nhis shoulder. Besides the pain of his wound, and the many bruises which\r\nhe had sustained, he was so benumbed with cold that he could scarcely\r\nmove. He now observed that several of the crew had got on the rocks\r\nwhich were near, and called out to them as loud as he could; but they\r\nwere not able to give him any assistance, so that a considerable time\r\nelapsed before he was able to disengage himself from the wreck and get\r\non shore.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the rock, he found twenty-three of his companions, which\r\nwere all that had been able to save themselves out of two hundred and\r\ntwenty individuals that were on board when the ship struck. Their\r\nfirst care was to search among the things that had been thrown on the\r\nrocks from the wreck, for something to cover them from the weather,\r\nand in this they succeeded almost beyond their expectations; but the\r\nattainment of fire was not so easily accomplished. Some of them made\r\nan unsuccessful attempt to kindle two pieces of wood by rubbing\r\nthem together, while others diligently searched the rocks in anxious\r\nendeavors to find a substitute for flint and steel. After some time\r\nthey found a box containing a couple of gun-flints and a broken file,\r\nwhich was a most joyful acquisition, though they still wanted tinder.\r\nAfter a further search, they discovered a cask of gunpowder, which, to\r\ntheir great disappointment, proved to be wet; but, on a more narrow\r\ninspection, they found a small quantity at the bottom that had suffered\r\nno damage. Some of this bruised on a linen rag, served their purpose\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\nHaving at length succeeded in lighting a fire, the bruised and wounded\r\ncollected round it, while the others went in search of further\r\nnecessaries. A box of wax candles and a case of brandy were the first\r\nbrought in, and soon afterwards another party returned, stating that\r\nthey had discovered a cask almost full of fresh water, which was of\r\ngreater consequence than the spirits, as there was no fresh water to be\r\nfound on the island. They could also see at some distance several casks\r\nof water, flour, and beer; but it was not possible to get at them over\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nIt now became necessary to provide some shelter for the approaching\r\nnight; all hands were therefore employed in making a tent of some\r\ncanvass that had been cast ashore; but the quantity was so small that\r\nthe tent would not hold them all, and for fear of being overflowed,\r\nthey were obliged to erect it on the highest part of the island. Here\r\nthey were so much exposed to the storm that their frail encampment was\r\nin danger of being blown away; their fire was scattered, and before\r\nthey could collect the embers the rain extinguished them. On renewing\r\ntheir search in the morning, they found, to their great mortification,\r\nthat all the casks which they had seen the preceding night, with the\r\nexception of one of flour and another of beer, had been staved against\r\nthe rocks. These, however, they secured; but the tide flowing up\r\nsoon after, interrupted their proceedings. As, in their desolate and\r\nforlorn situation, their thoughts naturally hurried from one subject\r\nto another in quest of some source of comfort, it was suggested by\r\none of them that, as the carpenter was among them, he might build a\r\nvessel to carry them to a port of safety, provided they could obtain\r\nsome tools and materials. The attention of every one was immediately\r\ndirected towards the carpenter, who declared his belief that if tools\r\nand materials could be found, he should be able to build a bark; and\r\nthough at that time there was no prospect of procuring either, yet no\r\nsooner had they thought their deliverance but one remove beyond total\r\nimpossibility, than they seemed to think it neither impossible nor\r\ndifficult. The boat engrossed their whole conversation, and they not\r\nonly debated on her size and rigging, but to what port they should\r\nsteer when she was fairly afloat. Some of them immediately dispersed\r\nin search of materials for their projected vessel, but they did not\r\nsucceed in finding any. On the following day, however, they secured\r\nfour butts of water, one cask of flour, one hogshead of brandy, and\r\na small boat, which had been thrown up by the tide in a shattered\r\ncondition; but no tools were found, with the exception of a scraper.\r\nNext day they had the good fortune to discover a box containing files,\r\ngimlets, sail-needles, and an azimuth compass-card; they also found\r\ntwo quadrants, a carpenter's adze, a chisel, three sword-blades, and a\r\nchest of treasure.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 20th of July, they recovered some more provisions, and\r\nalso some timber-plank, canvass, and cordage, which they joyfully\r\nsecured for their projected vessel, though still in want of many\r\nimplements indispensable for the carpenter to proceed with his work. It\r\nhappened, however, that one of the seamen, Hendrick Scanty, a native of\r\nSweden, who had originally been a smith by profession, having picked\r\nup an old pair of bellows, told his companions that, by the aid of\r\na forge, which they could build by his directions, he could furnish\r\nthe carpenter with all necessary tools as well as nails, as plenty\r\nof iron could be obtained by burning it out of pieces of the wreck\r\ndriven ashore. He began immediately to mend the bellows, and the three\r\nfollowing days were occupied in building a tent and forge, and in\r\ncollecting timber for the use of the carpenter, who was also employed\r\nin preparing the few tools already in his possession, that the boat\r\nmight be begun as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the carpenter began to work on the keel of the vessel,\r\nwhich, it was determined, should be a sloop, thirty feet in length\r\nby twelve in width. The smith also finished his forge, and he and\r\nthe carpenter continued thenceforward to work with indefatigable\r\ndiligence, except when prevented by the weather. The smith, having\r\nfortunately found the ring and nut of a bower-anchor, which served him\r\nfor an anvil, supplied chisels, axes, hammers and nails, as they were\r\nrequired, and the carpenter used them with great dexterity and despatch.\r\n\r\nAfter having been nearly seven weeks upon the rock, during which\r\ntime they had frequently seen a great smoke upon the main land,\r\nthey determined to send the boat which had been recovered from the\r\nwreck, which the carpenter had so patched up as to fit it for sea, to\r\nascertain what assistance could be obtained. For this purpose, three\r\nmen set out on a voyage of discovery, the people making a great fire at\r\nnight on the highest part of the rock, as a signal to them.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting three days, the return of the boat was impatiently\r\nexpected; but nothing being seen of it by noon they became very uneasy.\r\nAt length, however, they discovered it approaching, but it was rowed by\r\nonly one man, who plied both oars, and they consequently concluded that\r\nthe other two had been lost or detained. Presently, however, another\r\nwas seen to rise from the bottom of the boat, and their speed was a\r\nlittle increased.\r\n\r\nTheir interest and curiosity were wound up to the highest pitch, when\r\nthe two men, jumping from the boat, threw themselves on the ground,\r\nand returned thanks to the Almighty for their deliverance. They were,\r\nhowever, so exhausted by the exertions which they had made, that they\r\nnow sank on the ground and could not rise without assistance. When\r\nsufficiently recovered, they related their adventures since they left\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nOn the day of their departure, after sailing about six leagues to the\r\neastward, they got round a point of land, and ventured to pull for\r\nthe shore; but the moment they got into the surf, the boat was upset,\r\nby which their companion was unfortunately drowned. They managed,\r\nhowever, to reach the land, though in a very exhausted condition. On\r\nrecovering a little, they crawled along the shore in search of the\r\nboat, as they had no other shelter from wild beasts, which might be\r\nexpected to come abroad in the night, and after some search found her;\r\nbut they were too weak to get her up, and were obliged to lie down on\r\nthe sand, with no other covering than the branches of a tree. In the\r\nmorning they again searched for the boat, which the surf had driven\r\nfrom the place where they left her, and in walking along the coast saw\r\na man, who, on their approach, ran away into the woods. Soon afterwards\r\nthey discovered the body of their unfortunate companion, which had\r\nbeen dragged some distance from the shore, and mangled by some wild\r\nbeast, which so terrified them, that rather than undergo the dread of\r\npassing another night on shore, they resolved to return immediately.\r\nEncountering a gale from the west, the boat was once more upset, but\r\nafter much struggling and swimming, they got safe to land, exhausted by\r\ntheir exertions and faint with hunger. Having managed to get the boat\r\non shore, they turned it keel upwards and crept under it to sleep.\r\n\r\nWearied by their late exertions, they slept till the dawn of day,\r\nwhen, peeping out from under the edge of the boat, they saw the feet of\r\nseveral animals, which they supposed to be tigers, which induced them\r\nto remain under the boat till the day had well broke, when once more\r\nlooking out they saw the feet of a man. On this discovery, they crept\r\nout, to the great amazement of a poor savage and two other men and a\r\nboy, who were at some distance. When they were a little recovered from\r\ntheir surprise, the savages made signs for them to go away, which they\r\nendeavored to do, though they began to move very slowly: but they had\r\nnot got far when a considerable number of the natives ran down upon\r\nthem with their lances, and took them prisoners.\r\n\r\nThey then rifled the boat, and took away all the rope they could find,\r\nand began to knock the boat in pieces, for the iron which they saw\r\nabout it. With the exception of absolute destruction to these hapless\r\nmariners, this was the greatest calamity they could sustain; and,\r\nrough as they were, they burst into tears, and entreated the savages\r\nto desist, with such agony and distress, that they suffered the boat\r\nto remain without further injury. On the following morning, taking an\r\nopportunity of eluding the vigilance of the savages, they launched the\r\nboat for the third time, and returned to their companions on the rock.\r\n\r\nThis narrative was far from encouraging; nevertheless the carpenter\r\ncontinued his work with the greatest assiduity, and with such success,\r\nthat, imperfect as were the tools with which he worked, on the 17th\r\nFebruary 1756, they launched their little vessel, and bade adieu to\r\nthe rock on which they had lived seven months. They weighed anchor at\r\none in the afternoon, and set sail, with a light breeze from the west,\r\nfor the river St. Lucia, on the coast of Natal; but misfortune still\r\nseemed to attend them. For twenty-five days they met with nothing\r\nbut adversity; their provisions were almost exhausted, and the rapid\r\ncurrents carried them so far out of their course, that a favorable wind\r\nwas of but little service to them. Despairing at last of being able to\r\nmake the river St. Lucia, they resolved to change their course for the\r\nCape of Good Hope, and accordingly, on the 2d of March, bore away for\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\nThe three following days the wind increased to such prodigious violence\r\nthat it blew a furious storm, and their frail bark shipped such heavy\r\nseas, that they expected each wave, as it rolled over, to dash her in\r\npieces. On the morning of the 5th, however, fine weather ensued, and\r\non the 7th it was a perfect calm, when they cast anchor about three\r\nquarters of a mile from the shore, where they observed several natives\r\ncoming down from the mountains towards them.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this sight, they attempted to land, and Arnold, the black\r\nservant, was sent on shore, accompanied by two seamen, with a string\r\nof amber beads as a present to the Indians. After a mutual interchange\r\nof civilities, he obtained some Indian corn, fruit, and water, in a\r\ncalabash, with a promise of sheep, oxen, and other necessaries; but\r\nthe wind continuing westerly, the boat returned with a supply only\r\nsufficient for four days.\r\n\r\nThey continued to coast along, occasionally landing to barter with the\r\nnatives, who everywhere thronged to the shore and received them with\r\nkindness. At length, on the 6th April, they arrived at St. Lucia.\r\n\r\nHaving landed, they signified to the natives their wish to trade with\r\nthem; but the Indians intimated that they wanted nothing but small\r\nbeads: however, on being shown some copper buttons, they brought\r\nbullocks, fowls, potatoes, gourds, and other provisions. No bullocks\r\ncould be purchased; for the natives wanted copper rings large enough\r\nfor collars, in exchange. Of the fowls, they gave five or six for a\r\nsmall piece of linen, and the other things in proportion.\r\n\r\nThey remained here three weeks, being engaged in traversing the\r\ncountry, and endeavoring to obtain such articles as they wanted. The\r\nIndians set a great value on copper, and on being shown the handle\r\nof an old box, offered two bullocks for it, which were immediately\r\naccepted and driven on board the vessel.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of May, a favorable breeze springing up from the west,\r\nattended with good weather, they weighed anchor at seven in the morning\r\nand set sail. Two days afterwards they arrived in Lagoa Bay, where they\r\nfound the Rose, a trading vessel, in which some of them requested a\r\npassage to Bombay.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of May, the Rose sailed for Madagascar, where, happening to\r\nfall in with one of the East India Company's ships, bound for Madras,\r\nthe packets of treasure were transferred to it, and in about a month\r\narrived in safety at their destination.\r\n\r\nI must now bid you good bye, boys--not that I have exhausted my \"Tales\r\nof Shipwrecks,\" but my space being filled up, I must stop for the\r\npresent. I hope we shall soon meet again. Our present meetings have\r\nnot, I trust, been without profit as well as amusement. The various\r\nnarratives of suffering have awakened our sympathies, and taught us\r\nto feel how much we owe to the intrepidity of the adventurous seamen,\r\nwho, bidding defiance to the perils of the deep, bear the blessings of\r\ncommerce and civilization to the farthest corners of the earth. Nor\r\nought our conversations to have been void of instruction--opening up\r\nto us, as they have done, the mighty works of God and his mysterious\r\ndealings with mankind. \"They that go down to the sea in ships,\" says\r\nthe Psalmist, \"that do business in great waters--these see the works\r\nof the Lord, and his wonders in the deep. For he commandeth and raiseth\r\nthe stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to\r\nthe heavens, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted\r\nbecause of trouble. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken\r\nman, and are at their wit's end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their\r\ntrouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses. He maketh the\r\nstorm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still. Then are they glad\r\nbecause they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven. O,\r\nthat men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful\r\nworks to the children of men!\"\r\n\r\nGood bye, Uncle Thomas!",
