Besides drawing\r\nfreely on a number of authorities, the author has used his practical\r\nexperience to indicate such tests as an amateur can readily make.\r\nSpecific gravity, hardness, and dichroism are tests which are easily\r\nmastered, and a thorough understanding of these three properties will\r\nassist in classifying doubtful gems.\r\n\r\nSuch stones have been dealt with principally as are used in commerce\r\nfor jewelry and ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nThe attention of the writer has often been called to the general lack\r\nof knowledge among the jewelers regarding precious stones other than\r\ndiamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds.\r\n\r\nAs there are so many other beautiful and rare gems which nature yields\r\nto man, and which are worthy of the jewelers’ art, the author trusts\r\nthat his book will awaken a new interest in the fascinating study of\r\nmineralogy as applied to precious stones, and that at some future day\r\nhe may feel encouraged to enlarge upon this treatise.\r\n\r\n                                         M.

ROTHSCHILD.\r\n    41 and 43 MAIDEN LANE,\r\n          NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAND-BOOK OF PRECIOUS STONES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE PRECIOUS STONES?\r\n\r\nThe mineral to which the term “precious stone” is applied, must be\r\nadaptable for jewelry or ornamental purposes and must possess beauty,\r\nhardness, and rarity.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of a precious stone or gem consists of its color or\r\ncolorlessness, brilliancy or softness of lustre, and transparency.\r\nTo take a high and lasting polish, a mineral must be hard,—and many\r\nstones that would otherwise be highly valued are low in the estimate of\r\nworth because they do not possess of sufficient hardness to make them\r\nendure the wear and friction to which a precious stone is subjected\r\nwhen used in the form of jewelry. The rareness of precious stones\r\nhas a decided effect in determining their values. For instance, the\r\ncrocidolite, commercially known as tiger-eye, was sold by the carat\r\nsome years ago, and was largely used in the making of fine jewelry.\r\nTo-day, this material is so plentiful that it is no longer classed\r\namong the higher gems, but serves for cameos and intaglios like\r\nchalcedony and onyx.\r\n\r\nThe changes of fashion have much to do with determining the market\r\nvalue of precious stones. Amethysts, topazes, cat’s-eyes, aquamarines,\r\nalexandrites, and even emeralds and opals have been eagerly sought for\r\nat times and then again neglected for other gems, causing a sensible\r\ndifference in the value of these stones.\r\n\r\nThere are all degrees of precious stones, from the valuable diamond and\r\ncorundums to the humbler quartz, amethyst, and topaz.\r\n\r\nIt has been a mooted question as to the proper dividing line between\r\nstones that deserve the title “precious,” and those which should be\r\nplaced in a so-called semi-precious or lower category. To draw such a\r\nline is hardly possible, as neither hardness, rareness, nor value would\r\nbe a positive test—some of the hard stones, like zircon and almandines\r\nbeing less valuable than the softer opal, while the diamond, one of the\r\nmost plentiful of precious stones, is at the same time, one of the most\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nNeither can price be taken as a complete test, because fashion makes a\r\nturquois, an opal, or an emerald much more valuable at one time than\r\nat another. All precious minerals used for ornamental purposes, from\r\nthe diamond to quartz, or chalcedony, may properly be termed precious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRYSTALLIZATION.\r\n\r\nPrecious stones are found either in crystallized or amorphous\r\nconditions. The forms of crystallization are:\r\n\r\n    1 Isometric or Cubic; having the axes equal.\r\n    2 Tetragonal or Pyramidal     } having only the\r\n    3 Hexagonal or Rhombohedral   } lateral axes equal.\r\n    4 Orthorhombic or Trimetric    }\r\n    5 Monoclinic or Oblique        } having the axes\r\n    6 Triclinic or Anorthic        }    unequal.\r\n\r\nMost precious stones crystallize, but the specimens that have the\r\ncrystallization clearly defined are seldom found. The amorphous\r\ncondition includes the turquois, opal, and obsidian, which minerals are\r\nfound in masses or veins surrounded by a matrix.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEAVAGE.\r\n\r\nMany minerals can be separated readily in one direction by simply\r\nmaking a small indentation with a harder mineral, then introducing the\r\nblade of a knife into the scratch and striking it a sharp blow,—this\r\nseparates the crystal. There are certain planes at right angles where\r\nthe crystal can be separated; this property is called cleavage and the\r\nplanes, cleavage planes.\r\n\r\nIn some minerals cleavage is difficult to produce, while in others such\r\nas mica and rock-salt, cleavage is highly perfect and the number of\r\nseparations produced is only limited by the thickness of the blade used\r\nin separating the planes.\r\n\r\nThe property of cleavage is very useful and of great assistance to the\r\nlapidary, as it enables him to shape a diamond or other hard stone\r\nnearly to the size he desires, and at the same time to save the extra\r\nmaterial cleaved off, which can be used for smaller gems, and which\r\nunder other conditions would have to be ground away.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURE.\r\n\r\nFracture surfaces are the result of the breaking of a crystal otherwise\r\nthan by cleaving, and in a different direction from the cleavage planes.\r\n\r\nWhen the form of fracture is composed of concave and convex surfaces it\r\nis called conchoidal; when free from inequalities it is known as even\r\nor smooth, and when covered by small splinters, splintery or uneven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPTICAL PROPERTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFRACTION.\r\n\r\nWhen a ray of light passes from one medium to another, or from the air\r\nto a crystal it is bent or refracted; this is called single refraction\r\nand takes place in the diamond, spinel, and garnet.\r\n\r\nMost of the other transparent precious stones possess double\r\nrefraction—that is, the ray of light enters the crystal and divides\r\ninto two parts, one following the ordinary laws of refraction, while\r\nthe other part or extraordinary ray does not obey the usual law.\r\n\r\nThere are precise methods for measuring the indices of refraction, but\r\nthey are not applicable to polished gem stones.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLARIZATION OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nPolarization is a peculiar modification which, under certain\r\nconditions, a ray of light undergoes. This property is easier to\r\nobserve than double refraction.\r\n\r\nIf from a transparent prism of tourmaline two thin plates are cut,\r\nparallel to its axis, they will transmit light when they are placed\r\nabove each other with the chief axis of each in the same direction.\r\n\r\nWhen one of the plates is turned at right angles to the other, no\r\nlight, or but very little, is transmitted, so that the plates appear\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nIn passing through the first slip, the rays of light have acquired a\r\npeculiar property, which renders them incapable of being transmitted\r\nthrough the second, except when the two are held in a parallel\r\nposition, and the rays are then said to be polarized.\r\n\r\nIn some doubly refracting crystals the two oppositely polarized beams\r\nare of different colors, so upon double refraction and polarization\r\ndepends the property of many gems which is called pleiochroism.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEIOCHROISM.\r\n\r\nThe dichroiscope is a handy little optical instrument, that will\r\nreadily serve to distinguish the diamond, spinel, or garnet (all\r\nsingly refracting minerals) from the ruby, beryl, or any of the doubly\r\nrefracting stones. This instrument consists of a cleavage rhombohedron\r\nof Iceland spar, fastened in a brass tube about 2½ inches long, and ¾\r\nof an inch in diameter. A sliding cap at one end has a perforation ⅛\r\nof an inch square, and at the other end is a lens which will show a\r\ndistinct image of the square opening when the cap is pulled out about ¼\r\nof an inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe pleiochroism of many stones can be determined at a glance with the\r\ndichroiscope.\r\n\r\nWhen a stone is examined by means of the dichroiscope, it will show two\r\nimages of the same hue, or of different hues, these square images (fig.\r\n1, A) forming a right angle and being more distinct when viewed from\r\none part of the stone than from another.\r\n\r\nWhen the images are identical in color, the specimen may be a diamond,\r\ngarnet, spinel, or glass. Should a red or ruby spinel approach the\r\nruby in color, a quick and satisfactory test can be made with the\r\ndichroiscope, as the spinel will show two images of one color, while\r\nthe ruby will show one image of aurora red and one of carmine red.\r\n\r\nThe dichroiscope is inexpensive, costing but a few dollars, and is very\r\nuseful for rapidly deciding the species of many stones. The following\r\nis a partial list of doubly refracting stones and their twin colors.\r\n\r\n    ───────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────\r\n         NAME OF STONE.    │           TWIN COLORS.\r\n    ───────────────────────┼─────────────────┬────────────────\r\n    Sapphire (blue)        │ Greenish straw  │ Blue\r\n    Ruby (red)             │ Aurora red      │ Carmine red\r\n    Tourmaline (red)       │ Salmon          │ Rose pink\r\n      \" (brownish red)     │ Umber brown     │ Columbine pink\r\n      \" (brown)            │ Orange brown    │ Greenish yellow\r\n      \" (green)            │ Pistachio green │ Bluish green\r\n      \" (blue)             │ Greenish gray   │ Indigo blue\r\n    Emerald (green)        │ Yellowish green │ Bluish green\r\n    Topaz (sherry)         │ Straw yellow    │ Rose pink\r\n    Peridot (pistachio)    │ Brown yellow    │ Sea green\r\n    Aquamarine (sea green) │ Straw white     │ Gray blue\r\n    Beryl (pale blue)      │ Sea green       │ Azure blue\r\n    Chrysoberyl (yellow)   │ Golden brown    │ Greenish yellow\r\n    Iolite (lavender)      │ Pale buff       │ Indigo blue\r\n    Amethyst (purple)      │ Reddish purple  │ Bluish purple\r\n    ───────────────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORS.\r\n\r\nThe following is a partial list of the colors of precious stones:\r\n\r\n_Shades of White._—Quartz, opal, chalcedony.\r\n\r\n_Shades of Gray._—Labrador, smoky topaz, chalcedony, zircon.\r\n\r\n_Black._—Obsidian, tourmaline, jet.\r\n\r\n_Shades of Blue._—Lapis-lazuli, amethyst, chalcedony, spinel, zircon,\r\nsapphire, cyanite, tourmaline, turquois, odontolite, fluor spar.\r\n\r\n_Shades of Green._—Amazon stone, turquois, prase, beryl, blood-stone,\r\nepidote, emerald, malachite, chrysoprase, chrysolite, idocrase,\r\nolivine, garnet, chrysoberyl.\r\n\r\n_Shades of Yellow._—Opal, amber, topaz, beryl, jasper.\r\n\r\n_Shades of Red._—Garnet, carnelian, chalcedony, rose quartz, corundum,\r\ntourmaline, spinel, ruby.\r\n\r\n_Shades of Brown._—Zircon, garnet, smoky topaz, axinite, jasper.\r\n\r\n_Colorless._—Diamond, sapphire, spinel, zircon, topaz, rock crystal,\r\nmoonstone.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUSTRE.\r\n\r\nWell polished precious stones display a decided lustre, which assists\r\nin determining their species.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of some precious stones and their lustre:\r\n\r\n_Adamantine._—Diamond, zircon.\r\n\r\n_Resinous._—Garnet.\r\n\r\n_Vitreous._—Emerald, ruby, spinel.\r\n\r\n_Waxy._—Turquois.\r\n\r\n_Pearly._—Moonstone, opal.\r\n\r\n_Silky._—Crocidolite, quartz cat’s-eye.\r\n\r\n_Metallic._—Hematite.\r\n\r\n_Greasy._—Olivine.\r\n\r\nSome stones vary in lustre, from vitreous to pearly, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTREAK.\r\n\r\nThe streak of a mineral is the color of its powder.\r\n\r\nThis powder varies in color, and may be white, gray, red, etc. It is\r\nobtained by scratching the mineral with a sharp file, or by rubbing the\r\nmineral on the back of an unglazed porcelain plate, when the color of\r\nthe powder will appear on the plate.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the streak of the diamond is gray to\r\ngrayish-black, while that of the ruby is colorless or white.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARDNESS.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important and distinguishing qualities of a gem stone\r\nis the property of enduring, resisting wear,—in short, hardness.\r\nTo test the hardness of precious stones that have not been cut or\r\npolished, the following scale of ten minerals has been devised by Moh,\r\na German mineralogist:\r\n\r\n    No. 1. Talc. Very soft; is easily broken or scratched\r\n        with the finger-nail.\r\n\r\n    No. 2. Rock-salt. Soft; scratched with difficulty with\r\n        finger-nail; readily cut with a knife.\r\n\r\n    No. 3. Calcite. Low degree of hardness; not to be\r\n        scratched with finger-nail; easily scratched with a\r\n        knife.\r\n\r\n    No. 4. Fluor spar. Fairly hard; is slightly scratched\r\n        by a knife, but easily attacked with a file.\r\n\r\n    No. 5. Apatite. Medium hardness; does not scratch\r\n        glass, or only faintly; does not give out sparks\r\n        against steel; easily attacked with a file.\r\n\r\n    No. 6. Felspar. Easily scratches glass; is attacked by\r\n        a file, and gives some sparks against steel.\r\n\r\n    No. 7. Quartz. Quite hard; is only slightly attacked by\r\n        file; gives sparks readily against steel.\r\n\r\n    No. 8. Topaz. Very hard; is not attacked by a file.\r\n\r\n    No. 9. Sapphire. Hardest of all minerals but the\r\n        diamond; attacks all other minerals.\r\n\r\n    No. 10. Diamond. Attacks all minerals; is not attacked\r\n        by any.\r\n\r\nTo find the hardness of a stone, begin to test with the softest\r\nmineral, so that when the number is reached which will scratch the\r\nstone, there has been no injury to the specimen under examination. Half\r\nnumbers are determined by the ease or difficulty with which a stone is\r\nscratched. For example, a stone which will resist No. 7 (quartz) and\r\nwhich is only faintly attacked by No. 8 (topaz) may be safely put down\r\nas 7.5, while a stone which resisted No. 7 and yielded easily to No. 8\r\nis to be classed as 7 in hardness.\r\n\r\nThese tests are readily applied to crystals or unpolished gems. With\r\nthe polished stone greater care must be observed, and while a file\r\ntest is often satisfactory, there is always the danger of striking the\r\ncleavage and breaking off a small piece of the stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC GRAVITY.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important tests which can be applied to a polished\r\nstone is that of specific gravity. Many stones, like the ruby and the\r\nspinel, the blue tourmaline and the sapphire, etc., look alike, but\r\nthere is a sensible difference in their respective weights that a\r\nspecific-gravity test will readily establish.\r\n\r\nThe weight of an object which is free to seek the centre of gravitation\r\nis called absolute weight, while the weight of an object compared with\r\nthat of another containing the same volume of matter is called the\r\nspecific weight.\r\n\r\nIf a stone weighing 16 carats is placed in a vessel filled to the brim\r\nwith distilled water and the stone displaces 6 carats of water, the\r\nspecific gravity of the stone would be 16 ÷ 6, or 2.66, the specific\r\ngravity of quartz.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the stone would weigh 16 carats in the air and only 10\r\ncarats in the distilled water, showing a loss of 6 carats, which is the\r\nweight of the volume of water equal in bulk to the stone;—or absolute\r\nweight, 16 carats; specific weight, 10 carats; loss, 6 carats; 16 ÷ 6 =\r\n2.66, specific gravity.\r\n\r\nThere are several methods of ascertaining the specific gravity of a\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nFirst, by placing it in liquids of known specific gravity.\r\n\r\nSecond, by weighing the stone in air and then in distilled water or\r\nalcohol, and thus learning the weight of an equal bulk of water.\r\n\r\nThird, by measuring or weighing the water which the stone displaces\r\nwhen immersed in a small vessel of known capacity.\r\n\r\nFourth, by means of the Nicholson hydrometer, a simple instrument\r\nconsisting of a hollow glass cylinder, two dishes, and a glass vessel.\r\n\r\nAs the jewelers’ balances are well adapted for the ordinary work of\r\ntaking specific gravity, or can be easily adapted for such work, the\r\nsecond method will usually be the more practical to follow.\r\n\r\nThe author has had very satisfactory service from a $30 balance, and\r\nany well adjusted balance will give fair results.\r\n\r\nThe following accessories are necessary to take the specific gravity of\r\na stone:\r\n\r\nDistilled water about 60° Fahr.\r\n\r\nA very fine thread of platinum wire with which to suspend the stone\r\n(fig. 4).\r\n\r\nA glass-beaker for the water (fig. 3, C).\r\n\r\nA bench to hold the beaker over the pan (fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _FIG. 4_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _FIG. 2_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe distilled water is easily obtainable from any druggist. The\r\nplatinum wire should be bent to hook into the top of the balance frame,\r\n(fig. 3, B) and for ordinary small stones it will be convenient to\r\ntwist the other end into a cork-screw shape or receptacle (fig. 4, A).\r\n\r\nThe beaker can be a small, thin glass cup of any kind, and the bench\r\nis easily produced from wood (fig. 2) or of metal with three supports\r\n(fig. 3, A).\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the specific gravity, attach the platinum wire to the\r\nbalance frame, (fig. 3, B) and allow the lower end to rest in the\r\nwater; then balance this carefully by adding weights to the other side\r\n(fig. 3, D) until the balance is exact.\r\n\r\nThe stone to be weighed in water is a ruby, and weighs two carats in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nClean the stone carefully with water to free it from air bubbles; then\r\nplace it in the screw of the wire (fig. 4, A) and weigh carefully. If\r\nthe stone weighs 1½ carats it will have displaced ½ ct. of water: or,\r\nweight in air, 2 carats; weight in water, 1½ carats; loss, ½ carat; 2 ÷\r\n½ = 4, which will be the specific gravity of the ruby.\r\n\r\nThe Jolly spiral balance can also be used for taking specific gravity,\r\nbut it is not so practical or accurate for small stones as for the\r\nlarger ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe valuable precious stones are bought and sold by the carat. This\r\nweight is equal to about 3.17 grains or about .205 milligrams.\r\n\r\nThe carat is divided into fractions of ½, ¼, ⅛, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, and\r\nalso arbitrarily into four grains; that is, each quarter of a carat is\r\ncounted one grain, thus forming the basis for the calculation of pearls.\r\n\r\nIn commerce, a carat diamond is sometimes called a four-grain stone,\r\nand a carat-and-a-half stone is six grains, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the carat being arbitrary, it varies in different\r\ncountries, some being heavier and others lighter than .205 milligrams.\r\n\r\nThe writer wrote to three prominent balance-makers in the United\r\nStates some months ago for their carat standards and was surprised to\r\nfind that they all differed. This will account for discrepancies in\r\nweight resulting between the balances of different makers. Of late\r\nthere has been a decided movement in Europe, headed by the French\r\nChambre Syndicale of jewelers, in favor of the unification of the\r\ncarat, so that the weight of a French or Dutch carat will equal that\r\nof an English, American, or any other carat. This reform will probably\r\nbe accompanied by the adoption of the decimal system of dividing the\r\ncarat, and the discarding of the complicated fractional system.\r\n\r\nAfter having tried the decimal weights for many months, the author can\r\ntestify to a decided gain in time and accuracy from their use.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUSIBILITY.\r\n\r\nThe blow-pipe or dry test for minerals is convenient to apply to small\r\nbits or splinters of a stone.\r\n\r\nThe mineral is either held by a pair of platina-pointed forceps, or\r\npowdered and placed on a metal plate or in a glass tube.\r\n\r\nBefore the blow-pipe, some minerals change color, but do not melt,\r\nwhile others retain their color, or swell up, or break into small\r\nparticles, or melt into colorless or colored glasses.\r\n\r\nThe following is the scale of minerals used to test the different\r\ndegrees of fusibility:\r\n\r\n    1. Gray Antimony. Fusible in coarse splinters in\r\n        summit of candle flame without the blow-pipe.\r\n\r\n    2. Natrolite. Fusible in fine splinters in the summit\r\n        of a candle flame without the blow-pipe.\r\n\r\n    3. Almandite. Does not fuse in candle flame; fuses\r\n        easily before the blow-pipe in obtuse pieces.\r\n\r\n    4. Green Actinolite. Fusible before the blow-pipe in\r\n        coarse splinters.\r\n\r\n    5. Orthoclase. Fusible before the blow-pipe in fine\r\n        splinters.\r\n\r\n    6. Bronzite. Before the blow-pipe becomes rounded only\r\n        on the sharp edges.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNETISM.\r\n\r\nThere are but few precious stones that possess the power to act on\r\nthe magnetic needle; among them are the chrysolite, cinnamon stone,\r\nalmandine, pyrope, and garnet.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSPARENCY.\r\n\r\nPrecious stones are, on the basis of their relative transparency,\r\ndivided into four classes, as follows: _Transparent_, or admitting\r\nlight freely and clearly; defining objects when used as a lens.\r\n_Semi-transparent_, admitting light, but only partially defining\r\nobjects. _Translucent_, admitting light faintly. _Opaque_, not\r\nadmitting light.\r\n\r\nThe more valuable precious stones, excepting opals and turquoises, are\r\ngenerally transparent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORESCENCE.\r\n\r\nSome precious stones display a distinct phosphorescence after exposure\r\nto the sunlight, and also upon the application of artificial heat, and\r\nthrough mechanical and electrical means.\r\n\r\nMany diamonds, when taken to a dark room, appear quite luminous; this\r\nis also true of topaz, fluor spar, and other minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nMinerals acquire electricity through friction or heating, and in this\r\nstate readily attract or repel small bits of paper and other light\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nAll minerals are electric, some displaying positive and others negative\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nThe electric test of a precious stone refers to the length of time that\r\na stone will retain electricity after friction or heating.\r\n\r\nSome stones lose this quality in a few minutes, while others retain it\r\na long time. The tourmaline is noted for its electrical properties,\r\nwhile the Brazilian topaz rendered electric by heating or rubbing has\r\nbeen known to affect the electric needle after 32 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTTING AND POLISHING.\r\n\r\nAlthough a finely developed diamond, ruby, or other crystal is\r\nsometimes found and used for jewelry, the beauty of a precious stone\r\ngenerally remains hidden within a rough and unsightly exterior until\r\nthe lapidary’s art reveals the gem.\r\n\r\nAccording to well known rules, there is one kind of cutting or faceting\r\nfor the diamond or colorless gems and another for colored gems.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant cut, figs. 5 and 6, consists of an arrangement of\r\nfifty-six facets, exclusive of the table and culet. This cut is\r\nsometimes improved by the addition of eight star facets around the\r\nculet, which brings the number of facets up to sixty-four.\r\n\r\nThe following are the proportions of a well cut diamond or colorless\r\ngem:\r\n\r\n    ⅓ above the girdle, fig. 6, A.\r\n    ⅔ below  \"     \"     \"   6, B.\r\n    The table 2/5 of the breadth of the stone, fig. 6, C.\r\n    The culet ⅙ of the size of the table, fig. 6, D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nThese proportions do not refer to colored gems, which are cut thick or\r\nshallow to deepen or diminish the color of the stone. The step cut,\r\nfig. 7, now principally used for emeralds, can be advantageously used\r\nfor other colored stones.\r\n\r\nThe crowned rose cut, fig. 8, is applied to small diamonds, and\r\noccasionally to colored gems. This cut consists of twenty-four facets,\r\nand a well proportioned rose is one half of its diameter in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nTo the smaller and more common roses only twelve facets are given.\r\n\r\nBesides the above-mentioned forms, there are the:\r\n\r\n    Huitpan, or single cut.\r\n    16 facet  \" double  \"\r\n    24   \"    \" single brilliant.\r\n    Cabochon  \" carbuncle.\r\n    Star cut, fig. 9.\r\n    Degree or rose cut, fig. 10.\r\n\r\nThe last two beautiful forms of cutting are frequently given to fine\r\npaste or imitation diamonds.\r\n\r\nOf late years nearly all gems have been cut quite round, and in many\r\ninstances with a sacrifice of size and brilliancy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAMOND.\r\n\r\nThe diamond is one of the most precious minerals, and yet it consists\r\nof pure carbon, the most common substance that is known, a substance\r\nthat is present in all animal and vegetable bodies and in the larger\r\nnumber of minerals. When carbon is crystallized the result is the\r\ndiamond, which is always found in detached crystals, either octahedrons\r\nor rhombic dodecahedrons, the planes of the angles being often convex\r\nor rounded,—this curving crystal being peculiar to the diamond.\r\n\r\nThe cleavage is perfect, and, parallel to the faces of the octahedron,\r\nthe fracture is conchoidal or curved. The diamond is not acted upon by\r\nacids or alkalies, is infusible but combustible, and burns under heat\r\nof a very high temperature. Diamond powder burns readily, but larger\r\npieces are not affected by the blow-pipe.\r\n\r\nThe diamond is a non-conductor of electricity, but acquires positive\r\nelectricity when rubbed, and retains it for half an hour. After\r\nbeing exposed to the solar rays, the diamond presents a distinct\r\nphosphorescence in the dark. It possesses single refraction, but\r\nbelongs to those bodies which reflect light most strongly, and its\r\nmagnifying power is much greater than that of glass; it does not\r\npolarize light; its lustre is adamantine, and specific gravity 3.5 to\r\n3.6. The diamond is the hardest of all known minerals, ranking No. 10\r\nin Moh’s scale of hardness.\r\n\r\nWhite, and the different shades from very light yellow to dark yellow\r\nor canary, comprise, according to the popular idea, the colors of the\r\ndiamond. Yet the diamond is found in green, red, blue, brown, olive,\r\norange, and black, and also in the various shadings of these colors and\r\nin opalescent tints.\r\n\r\nAs the limpid or white diamond surpasses all other white stones in the\r\npower of its lustre and the magnificence of its fire, so do the colored\r\ndiamonds outrank the emerald, ruby, sapphire, and other gems of like\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\nColored diamonds, excepting light yellow and brown, are rare, and hence\r\nare the most valuable of precious stones. The limpid or perfectly white\r\nand the white with a bluish tint are the most sought after, while fine\r\ndeep golden yellow or canaries and pronounced fancy colors always find\r\na ready market.\r\n\r\nDiamonds come principally from the mines in South Africa; some are\r\nfound in Brazil and India, and fewer in Sumatra, Borneo, the Ural\r\nMountains, and Australia. Crystals have also been found in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe amorphous or carbon diamond is found only in Brazil. The pebbles or\r\nmasses are opaque, steel-gray to black in color, and sometimes weigh\r\n1,000 carats.\r\n\r\nThis carbonate is principally used to point rock-drills and for other\r\nengineering purposes. The coarse variety of crystallized diamonds\r\nis called bort, and as this is unfitted for gem purposes because of\r\nimperfections, it is ground into powder and used for cutting and\r\ndrilling precious stones.\r\n\r\nWhite sapphires, white zircons, white topaz, and rock-crystal sometimes\r\npass for diamonds. The first two are heavier, the topaz lacks\r\nbrilliancy, and the crystal is lighter than the diamond.\r\n\r\nIt is also the case that these four stones, especially the crystal, are\r\neasily scratched by a diamond.\r\n\r\nThe best style of cutting for a diamond is the brilliant, of 66 facets,\r\nincluding the table and culet. The proper proportions of a well cut\r\nbrilliant is ⅓ for the crown and ⅔ for the culet. The table and culet\r\nmust also be in proportion to the size of the stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORUNDUM.\r\n\r\nThis many-colored mineral, composed of nearly pure alumina, produces\r\ngems which in some cases are more valuable even than diamonds. The\r\nruby, sapphire, Oriental emerald, Oriental topaz, Oriental amethyst,\r\nOriental aquamarine, Oriental chrysolite, Oriental hyacinth, star ruby,\r\nstar sapphire, star topaz, and ruby and sapphire cat’s-eyes are all\r\ncorundums of different colors. The ruby is a red sapphire, and the\r\nOriental topaz a yellow sapphire, while the Oriental emerald is a green\r\nsapphire, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nIn hardness corundum ranks next to the diamond, ranking No. 9 in Moh’s\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity is 3.9 to 4.1, the crystallization rhombohedral,\r\nand cleavage basal, the crystals breaking across the prism with nearly\r\na flat surface.\r\n\r\nIn lustre, the corundum is vitreous, its refraction double but not to\r\na high degree, and it is susceptible of electricity by friction, which\r\nthe polished specimens especially retain for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nCorundum is unaffected by chemicals, and is infusible alone, but in\r\ncombination with a flux it melts with difficulty into a clear glass.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of precious corundum is:\r\n\r\n    Alumina           98.5\r\n    Oxide of iron      1.0\r\n    Lime               0.5\r\n                     ─────\r\n                     100.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that corundum is composed almost wholly of\r\nalumina,—one of the constituents of common clay, which, when colored\r\nby traces of metallic oxides, chrome, etc., produces a greater variety\r\nof precious stones of a high rank than any other mineral.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RUBY.\r\n\r\nThe red sapphire or ruby is the most valuable of the corundum family,\r\nand when found of a good color, pure and brilliant, and in sizes of one\r\ncarat and larger, it is much more valuable than a fine diamond of the\r\nsame size.\r\n\r\nFine rubies larger than 1½ to 2 carats are very rare, and when a fine\r\nstone from 3 to 5 carats is offered for sale, the price mounts into the\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nThe color varies from the lightest rose tint to the deepest carmine;\r\nthat color, however, which has the greatest value is known in commerce\r\nas pigeon’s blood, and is the color of arterial blood, or of the very\r\ncentre of the red ray in the solar spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe imperfections in rubies, as in all corundums, consist largely of\r\nclouds, milky spots, and cracks. A perfect ruby is rarely met with,\r\nand a stone possessing brilliancy and the true color, even if slightly\r\ndefective, is considered more valuable than an absolutely perfect ruby\r\nof an inferior color.\r\n\r\nRubies are found in Siam, Ceylon, Burmah, Brazil, Hindustan, Borneo,\r\nSumatra, Australia, France, and Germany.\r\n\r\nWhere rubies and sapphires are met with it is said that gold is almost\r\nsure to be present.\r\n\r\nChemists have succeeded in producing minute crystals of rubies\r\nand sapphires which, under the microscope, presented the true\r\ncrystallization of corundums, and upon being tested proved to be of the\r\nsame hardness as rubies and sapphires; but these specimens were small,\r\nand cost very much more to produce than their commercial value.\r\n\r\nRuby spinels, garnets, hyacinths, red quartz, burnt Brazilian or rose\r\ntopaz, and red tourmaline are sometimes passed off for the ruby.\r\n\r\nThe true ruby will scratch all of these stones readily, the spinel\r\nis lighter in specific gravity, and has generally a slight tinge of\r\nyellow, even in the most pronounced red specimens.\r\n\r\nThe ruby will turn green under the flames of a blow-pipe, but when\r\ncooled off, resumes its original color.\r\n\r\nThe garnet and topaz are easily scratched by the ruby, the hyacinth is\r\nheavier, and quartz and tourmaline lighter than the ruby. Some\r\nso-called reconstructed rubies, recently offered for sale, are of a\r\nvery fine color, and closely resemble the Oriental gems.\r\n\r\nThe hardness and specific gravity are the same, but they differ in one\r\nvery important point, namely: they lack the brilliancy of the true\r\nruby. In addition to this lack of fire, a microscopical test discloses\r\nformations which will distinguish the manufactured from the natural\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAPPHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe blue corundum, ranging in color from the lightest blue to deep blue\r\nand black, is the same stone as the ruby, the only difference being in\r\nthe color.\r\n\r\nThe choicest color is the soft velvety blue, approaching the\r\ncorn-flower in shade and exhibiting that color vividly by artificial as\r\nwell as by natural light.\r\n\r\nThe deeper-colored stones are known as male, and the light-colored ones\r\nas female sapphires.\r\n\r\nAlthough choice sapphires are rare, a much greater quantity of good and\r\nlarge stones are to be had than of rubies, and therefore the price of a\r\nlarge sapphire does not advance in the same proportion as the price of\r\na large ruby.\r\n\r\n\r\nFANCY SAPPHIRES.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental emerald or green sapphire does not approach the beryl or\r\ntrue emerald in depth of color, but because of its superior hardness\r\nand brilliancy, added to its extreme rarity, it is the most valuable of\r\ngreen gems. The Oriental amethyst or purple sapphire sometimes reflects\r\na red color by artificial light, and is valued highly as a gem stone;\r\nthe common amethyst is softer, less brilliant, and loses by artificial\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe various other colored sapphires, such as yellow or Oriental topaz,\r\nlight green or Oriental aquamarine, greenish-yellow or Oriental\r\nchrysolite, and aurora-red or Oriental hyacinth, are all valuable as gem\r\nstones when they are pure, well cut, and have pronounced colors—in\r\nfact, the name Oriental is given to distinguish the corundums from\r\nthe less valuable minerals of the same colors which they resemble,\r\nbut which they greatly surpass in beauty and value because of their\r\nbrilliancy and superior hardness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAR SAPPHIRES.\r\n\r\nAsterias or star stones are corundums of three different colors; the\r\nstar sapphire proper is a grayish blue, the star ruby red, and the star\r\ntopaz yellow.\r\n\r\nThese stones are usually cut cabochon or convex, and display under the\r\nrays of the sun, or when exposed to one candle or other artificial\r\nlight, a beautiful star with six points.\r\n\r\nThis star is produced by foreign substances in the corundum, and the\r\nlapidary brings about the regular effect by cutting a pointed carbuncle\r\nso that the centre of the star begins at the apex, and the six bright\r\nstripes radiate to the base of the stone.\r\n\r\nThe bright lines of the star following the light move over the surface\r\nof the stone and produce a remarkable effect. These stones are amongst\r\nthe most wonderful of mineral productions, and good specimens are very\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nThe corundum cat’s-eye, called Oriental girasol or sunstone, has a\r\nbluish, reddish, or yellowish reflection of light of a lighter shade\r\nthan the stone itself, and which moves on the convex surface of the\r\nstone like the lines of a star stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINEL.\r\n\r\nIt is only during the past century that mineralogists make a\r\ndistinction between the minerals spinel and corundum.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the spinel was discovered towards the end of the\r\nlast century, and was found to be about seventy per cent. alumina,\r\ntwenty-five per cent. magnesia, and small parts of oxide of chrome,\r\nsilica, and protoxide of iron.\r\n\r\nUp to that time, red spinels had always been confounded with rubies,\r\nand many celebrated so-called rubies have been shown to be spinels by\r\nmodern mineralogists.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful mineral is found in many colors, from pink to rose-red,\r\ncarmine, cochineal, blood-red, hyacinth, pale to dark blue, violet and\r\nindigo blue, grass-green to blackish green, and sometimes colorless.\r\nThere is also a black variety called pleonaste or ceylonite. Spinels\r\ncrystallize in octahedrons and their modifications, the fracture is\r\nconchoidal, specific gravity 3.5 to 3.6, and hardness No. 8 in Moh’s\r\nscale; only the diamond, corundum and chrysoberyl will scratch the\r\nspinel.\r\n\r\nIts refraction is single, the lustre highly vitreous, and it does not\r\neasily acquire electricity.\r\n\r\nAcids do not attack the spinel, nor has the blow-pipe any effect on\r\nthis mineral, except to change the red to a brownish or colorless\r\nstate, but the original color returns when the stone cools.\r\n\r\nFlawed or imperfect stones are liable to crack or split if heated\r\ntoo much. With borax or salt of phosphorus the spinel melts into a\r\ncolorless or green-tinted glass.\r\n\r\nSpinels are found in clay and in the sands of rivers, in East India,\r\nHindustan, the province of Mysore, Farther India, Pegu, Ceylon, North\r\nAmerica, Sweden, Bohemia, and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe red spinel, and especially those tints which approach the red\r\ncorundum or true ruby in color, are the most valuable, and are known as\r\nruby spinels.\r\n\r\nVery fine specimens of ruby spinels of one carat and larger are quite\r\nrare and command good prices.\r\n\r\nRose-colored spinels are known as balas-rubies, pale-blue spinels as\r\nsapphirines, and the hyacinth-red, yellowish-red, and orange-yellow\r\nspinels are called rubicelles.\r\n\r\nAll these different-colored spinels, if pure and of great brilliancy,\r\nare valuable as gem stones, being only surpassed in hardness and\r\nbrilliancy by the diamond and corundums.\r\n\r\nThe white spinel, which is seldom found, is sometimes confounded with\r\nthe diamond, having the same specific gravity and single refraction,\r\nbut as it lacks the fire and is easily scratched by the diamond, the\r\ndanger of mistaking one for the other is slight. Burnt amethyst, which\r\noften resembles the spinel, is lighter and softer, while burnt topaz,\r\nalthough it is identical with the spinel in hardness, is somewhat\r\nlighter and possesses remarkable electric powers, becoming electric by\r\neither rubbing, heating, or pressure, and retaining electricity for\r\nupwards of twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe zircon is easily distinguished from the spinel because of its much\r\ngreater specific gravity. It is also doubly refractive and softer.\r\n\r\nGarnets are softer, lack the play of color and brilliancy, and fuse\r\neasily into a light-brown or black glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERYL.\r\n\r\nThe beryl is a mineral belonging to the primitive formation, and is\r\nfound in quartz veins and granite.\r\n\r\nIt crystallizes in six-sided prisms and is composed largely of silica,\r\nthe third most common of earth’s productions. The beryl is 7.5 to 8 in\r\nhardness, scratching quartz, but is scratched by topaz.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity is 2.67 to 2.73, making it one of the light\r\nminerals. Its lustre is vitreous and refraction double to a slight\r\ndegree; its cleavage is imperfectly basal, and it becomes electric by\r\nrubbing.\r\n\r\nAcids do not attack the beryl, but it melts with borax and is soluble\r\nin salts of phosphorus.\r\n\r\nThis stone is found in various colors, grass-green, pale-green,\r\nlight-blue, greenish-blue, greenish-yellow, yellow, and sometimes pink.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these colors is the grass-green, which forms a\r\nseparate division of the beryl family, and is known as the emerald.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMERALD.\r\n\r\nThe emerald or green beryl is one of the most highly prized of the gem\r\nstones. Its magnificent color has rightly been compared to the color of\r\nthe fresh grass in spring, and in brilliancy this stone far exceeds all\r\nother green gems, excepting only the very rare green corundum or green\r\nsapphire.\r\n\r\nThe emerald is said to be very soft when first withdrawn from the mine,\r\nbut it hardens by exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nA perfect emerald of fair size is a rarity, so that the saying “an\r\nemerald without a flaw” has passed into a proverb.\r\n\r\nThis stone is so light, compared to a diamond or sapphire, that a carat\r\nemerald will be very much larger than either of the above stones.\r\n\r\nThe emerald is composed of:\r\n\r\n          Silica                68.50\r\n          Alumina               15.75\r\n          Glucina               12.50\r\n          Peroxide of iron       1.\r\n          Lime                   0.25\r\n          Oxide of chrome        0.30\r\n      And traces of magnesia, of lime, and of soda.\r\n\r\nThe vivid green color of the emerald is supposed to come from the oxide\r\nof chrome, as the other beryls do not contain chrome.\r\n\r\nEmeralds are found in New Granada, near Bogota, Egypt, East India,\r\nBurmah, Ural in Europe; Salzburg, Austria; Mt. Remarkable, South\r\nAustralia; and North America. Some of the finest come from the mines of\r\nMuza, near Bogota, and the best stones are called Peruvian emeralds.\r\nDuring the conquest of Peru by the Spaniards, many very fine emeralds\r\nwere destroyed by the invaders, who tested them by grinding and\r\npounding, and concluded that the emeralds were worthless, because they\r\nwere not as hard as the diamonds or sapphires.\r\n\r\nIn 1587, Joseph D’Acosta returned to Spain with two cases of emeralds,\r\neach case weighing one hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nGreen tourmaline sometimes passes for the emerald, but it is somewhat\r\nsofter and considerably heavier.\r\n\r\nOlivines or chrysolites, if of a fine green color, sometimes resemble\r\nthe emerald, but they are much heavier than the emerald and have a\r\nfatty lustre. Green spinels are heavier and harder than emeralds.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERYL.\r\n\r\nThe second and less valuable division of the beryl family comprises the\r\nfollowing colors:\r\n\r\nClear light sky-blue, called by lapidaries aquamarine; very light\r\ngreenish-blue, known as Siberian aquamarine; and a greenish-yellow\r\nvariety, called aquamarine chrysolite.\r\n\r\nThese three kinds are usually very brilliant, and especially so by\r\nartificial light, in which respect the beryl is superior to many of the\r\nmore valuable gem stones. Beryls of very large size have been found\r\nin New Hampshire, one of which has been estimated to weigh over two\r\ntons. While the large specimens are worthless for gem stones, some very\r\nhandsome aquamarines and golden-yellow beryls have been found during\r\nthe past few years in New Hampshire and Connecticut. These stones, when\r\ncut, compare favorably with the best of their kind.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRYSOBERYL.\r\n\r\nThe name chrysoberyl is derived from two Greek words signifying\r\ngolden-beryl. This name is well suited to the golden-yellow variety,\r\nbut the chrysoberyl also includes many other colors: such as green,\r\ngreenish-yellow, brownish-yellow, white, and dark-brown to black.\r\n\r\nThree varieties of chrysoberyls are known as cat’s-eyes, cymophanes,\r\nand alexandrites.\r\n\r\nThe chrysoberyl crystallizes in the trimetric or rhombic system; the\r\ncleavage is imperfect; fracture conchoidal; hardness, 8.5, being the\r\nthird hardest stone; specific gravity, 3.65 to 3.8; and lustre vitreous\r\nto greasy.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the chrysoberyl is: alumina, 80.2; glucina, 19.8;\r\nwith traces of protoxide of iron and oxides of lead and copper. The\r\nchrysoberyl is doubly refractive to a high degree, acquires positive\r\nelectricity lasting several hours, is infusible alone, but melts with\r\nborax or salts of phosphorus to a clear glass, though with difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe chrysoberyl is unaffected by acids, but with a solution of cobalt\r\nnitrate the powdered mineral becomes blue.\r\n\r\nTransparent greenish-yellow chrysoberyls are sometimes called Oriental\r\nchrysolites. These, and the brownish-yellow stones are the gems most\r\nused in jewelry.\r\n\r\nThe chrysoberyl cat’s-eye, or Ceylon cat’s-eye, is found in various\r\nshadings of yellow, brown, and green, and sometimes nearly black. These\r\nstones are translucent to opaque, and have a bright band of light\r\nrunning through the centre. This band is nearly always white, and in\r\nfine specimens is sharply defined, not too wide, and is in the centre\r\nof the stone.\r\n\r\nThe cat’s-eye chrysoberyls are always cut convex or cabochon shape, and\r\nas the stone is moved from side to side the band of light moves over\r\nits surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYMOPHANE.\r\n\r\nThe cymophane, or floating light, as the name denotes, is a chrysoberyl\r\nwith a bright spot of light which seems to float over the surface as\r\nthe stone is moved. The cymophane is also cut cabochon.\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDRITE.\r\n\r\nOn the day that the Emperor Alexander of Russia attained his majority\r\nthe Ural chrysoberyl, of a dark-green color, was found in the emerald\r\nmines of Takowaja in the Catherine Mountains.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful stone is emerald-green to dark-green in color, with\r\noften a slight red tint, but by artificial light the green of good\r\nspecimens changes to a beautiful columbine-red.\r\n\r\nAs the colors green and red are the national colors of Russia, and the\r\ndate of discovery of this stone in Russia occurred on the Emperor’s\r\nbirthday, the name alexandrite was given to this species of chrysoberyl.\r\n\r\nThe alexandrite is found in large pieces, but is nearly always flawed\r\nand cracked. This is a much-sought-after gem stone, and specimens of\r\nfrom one to five carats command good prices. Up to the present time,\r\nhowever, good alexandrites have been rare, and the demand has always\r\nexceeded the supply.\r\n\r\nCat’s-eyes and cymophanes are found in Brazil in alluvial deposits of\r\nrivers, and consequently in rolled and rubbed masses.\r\n\r\nChrysoberyls are also found in Russia, Germany, America, Borneo, Pegu,\r\nand Moravia.\r\n\r\nChrysolites and topazes are sometimes passed off for chrysoberyls. The\r\nchrysolite is, however, lighter and softer, while the topaz becomes\r\nelectric from heating, and is softer.\r\n\r\nQuartz cat’s-eyes, which are mistaken for chrysoberyl or Oriental\r\ncat’s-eyes, have a specific gravity of about 2.65, hardness of 6 to\r\n6.5, and are soluble in fluoric acid, besides melting with soda into a\r\nclear glass.\r\n\r\nThey lack the bright, hard polish of the chrysoberyl cat’s-eye, and\r\nthere should be no difficulty in discovering the difference between the\r\ngem and the inferior stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nZIRCON.\r\n\r\nThe zircon, hyacinth, jacinth, or jargoon belong to the tetragonal\r\nsystem of crystallization. The cleavage is imperfect, fracture\r\nconchoidal, and specific gravity 4.4 to 4.7, the stone being much\r\nheavier than any other gems. Its hardness is 7.5 and lustre vitreous to\r\nadamantine, and refraction double to a high degree.\r\n\r\nThe zircon is phosphorescent when heated; before the blow-pipe it\r\nis infusible, but loses its color; and with borax it melts into\r\na transparent glass. Sulphuric acid affects this gem after long\r\nmaceration.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the zircon is: zirconia, 66.3; silica, 33.7; with a\r\ntrace of peroxide of iron.\r\n\r\nUnder the microscope, the texture of these gems presents a watery\r\nappearance, called by the French _ratiné_, and which looks like a\r\nliqueur poured into water. This is a strong distinguishing point in the\r\nzircon.\r\n\r\nThe zircon, hyacinth, jargoon, and jacinth are the same gems but of\r\ndifferent colors.\r\n\r\nThe brown, violet, and green colors are known as zircons, the red as\r\nhyacinth, the yellow as jacinth, and the grayish-white and white as\r\njargoons.\r\n\r\nThe jargoon has often been palmed off as a diamond because of its\r\ntransparent color and adamantine lustre.\r\n\r\nThe zircon is found in Ceylon, Germany, France, Bohemia, America, and\r\nin fact in nearly all parts of the earth, as many as 120 localities\r\nhaving been noted where specimens of the mineral have been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe zircon can be distinguished from the garnet by its peculiar\r\ndiamond-like brilliancy and its specific gravity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURQUOIS.\r\n\r\nThe turquois is never found in crystals, but in reniform or stalactitic\r\nmasses. The color varies from pea- and apple-green to greenish-blue,\r\nsky-blue and dark-blue.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of the turquois is 6., specific gravity 2.6 to 2.8, lustre\r\nwaxy, and condition opaque to slightly translucent.\r\n\r\nBefore the reducing flame of the blow-pipe, the turquois does not melt,\r\nbut becomes brown and colors the flame green. With borax and salts\r\nof phosphorus the turquois melts to a clear glass, while it is also\r\nsoluble in hydrochloric acid. Oriental or mineral turquois is composed\r\nof:\r\n\r\n    Alumina                 47.45\r\n    Phosphoric acid         27.34\r\n    Water                   18.18\r\n    Oxide of copper          2.02\r\n    Iron                     1.10\r\n    Oxide of manganese       0.50\r\n    Phosphate of lime        3.41\r\n                           ──────\r\n                           100.00\r\n\r\nThe best color is a clear deep sky-blue, and in the true turquois this\r\ncolor improves by artificial light; imitation turquoises, however, lose\r\ntheir fine color under the same conditions.\r\n\r\nThe finest gem turquoises come from the northeastern part of Persia,\r\nbetween Nishapoor and Meshed. Here they are mined and partly cut, and\r\nthen the Persian merchants carry them to Russia, where they are sold\r\nat the great annual fair of Nijni-Novgorod and in Moscow. Mineral\r\nturquoises are also found in New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada, but not\r\nof sufficient size or sufficiently good color to make gem stones,\r\nalthough they are prized for collections. Specimens are also found in\r\nBurmah, Khorassan, Thibet, China, Silesia, Saxony, and on the Isthmus\r\nof Suez. The stones from these places have, as a rule, but little\r\nvalue, as the color fades or turns green from exposure to the light.\r\nOf late however, some very good turquoises have come from Egypt. The\r\ncolor of a faded Persian turquois can sometimes be restored by simply\r\nrepolishing the stone.\r\n\r\nOccidental or bone turquoises called new rock or odontolites, to\r\ndistinguish them from the Persian or old rock stones, are of organic\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThey are cut from the teeth of mammoths, mastodons, dinotheriums, etc.,\r\nand are found near the town of Simor, in Lower Languedoc, France.\r\n\r\nThese teeth, the enamel of which is nearly as hard as the mineral\r\nturquois, are colored by contact with phosphate of iron and copper,\r\nwhich gives them a dark-blue, light-blue, and bluish-green color. They\r\nare easily attacked by a file, and totally destroyed by aqua-fortis.\r\n\r\nWhen heated, the fossil turquois or odontolite gives an offensive odor,\r\nowing to the decomposition of animal matter.\r\n\r\nThe odontolite is lighter than the mineral turquois, changes color by\r\nartificial light, loses color in distilled water and alcohol, and is\r\ntranslucent on the edges.\r\n\r\nThis fossil turquois does not fade like the mineral turquois, but by\r\nartificial light appears of a dirty grayish-blue.\r\n\r\nTurquoises are sometimes artificially stained, but this can be detected\r\nby applying a drop of ammonia to the back of the stone, and if the\r\ncolor is artificial the ammonia will eat it off, leaving a green spot.\r\nAmmonia does not affect the color of the Persian turquois. The so-called\r\n“reconstructed” turquoises are very close imitations of the real, but\r\nare easily distinguished, as they change rapidly to a deeper blue when\r\nimmersed in water, and while wet the surface of the stone shows cracks\r\nin every direction. These stones become softer through soaking in water\r\nor alcohol. The original color, however, returns when the stone is dry,\r\nbut the cracks remain in faint outline.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURMALINE.\r\n\r\nThe tourmaline or precious schorl is known under many different names,\r\nand no other mineral has such a suite of colors.\r\n\r\nThe colorless variety is known as achroite; the red, as rubellite\r\nor siberite; the blue, indicolite or Brazilian sapphire; the green,\r\nBrazilian emerald; and the yellowish-green, Ceylon chrysolite or Ceylon\r\nperidot. Besides the above colors and their shadings, the tourmaline\r\noccurs in black and brown.\r\n\r\nThe crystallization is obtuse rhomboid, and generally forms six-,\r\nnine-, and twelve-sided prisms.\r\n\r\nSome of the crystals are very large, specimens over eight inches long\r\nhaving been mined.\r\n\r\nThe tourmaline crystals are remarkable for their varied and beautiful\r\ngroupings of colors. Some are internally blue or brown, surrounded by\r\na bright carmine red or dull yellow; others are red internally and\r\nare enveloped by a green exterior; crystals are sometimes pink at the\r\nsummit and light green at the base, or crimson tipped with black, or\r\nwhite at one end shading into green and finally into red at the other\r\nend. The hardness of the tourmaline is 7 to 7.5, specific gravity 3 to\r\n3.1, and lustre vitreous.\r\n\r\nThe tourmaline becomes decidedly electric by heating or rubbing, and\r\nwill readily attract small pieces of paper and other small objects. The\r\nrubellite or red tourmaline is composed of:\r\n\r\n    Silica                   42.13\r\n    Alumina                  36.43\r\n    Boracic acid              5.74\r\n    Oxide of manganese        6.32\r\n    Lime                      1.20\r\n    Potash                    2.41\r\n    Lithia                    2.04\r\n\r\nThe green tourmaline is composed of\r\n\r\n    Silica                   40.\r\n    Alumina                  39.16\r\n    Lithia and potash         3.59\r\n    Protoxide of iron         5.96\r\n    Protoxide of manganese    2.14\r\n    Boracic acid              4.59\r\n    Volatile matter           1.58\r\n\r\nThe tourmaline possesses double refraction to a high degree, and its\r\npower of polarizing light is so great that, cut into slices, it is used\r\nin the polariscope for analyzing other minerals.\r\n\r\nIf two slices of tourmaline, cut parallel to their axis, be laid one on\r\nthe other in one direction, both are transparent; if laid in another\r\ndirection they become opaque, and if a doubly refracting crystal be\r\nplaced between the two plates of tourmaline, the part covered by the\r\ncrystal is transparent while the other is opaque.\r\n\r\nTourmaline melts with borax into a transparent glass; the rubellite\r\nturns white, and the indicolite and green tourmalines turn black, under\r\nthe blow-pipe.\r\n\r\nTourmalines can be distinguished from other gems by their specific\r\ngravity, but principally by their property of assuming polaric\r\nelectricity after being heated, one end becoming positive and the other\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\nThe history of the discovery of the tourmaline and its electric\r\nproperty is a curious one.\r\n\r\nOn a warm summer day, early in the eighteenth century, some children\r\nwere playing in a courtyard in Amsterdam. Amongst their playthings\r\nwere some precious stones which the Dutch navigators had brought from\r\nCeylon. Some of the stones seemed to be possessed of the strange power\r\nof attracting and repelling small bits of straw, ashes, and other light\r\nsubstances. The little ones called their parents to witness this\r\nstrange phenomenon, and the stolid Dutch lapidaries, themselves puzzled\r\nat the sight, called the stones _aschentreckers_ or ash-drawers.\r\n\r\nA number of years afterwards, careful experiments disclosed the\r\nwonderful electric powers of the aschentreckers or tourmalines. Purple,\r\ngreen, and blue tourmalines are found in Brazil. In Ceylon the stones\r\nare found in gravel beds. Rubellites or siberites are found in Siberia.\r\n\r\nTourmalines are also found in Moravia, the island of Elba, Sweden,\r\nBurmah, Tyrol, Canada, and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first tourmaline deposits known in the United States were\r\ndiscovered at Paris, Maine, in 1820. Another wonderful deposit was\r\nfound at Mt. Apatite in Maine in 1882, and up to the present time the\r\nfinest tourmaline crystals have been discovered in the United States.\r\n\r\nReally fine specimens of red, blue, or green tourmalines are uncommon\r\nand command very good prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPAL.\r\n\r\nThe precious or noble opal, fire opal, common opal, hydrophane, and\r\ncachelong are different varieties of a mineral that is composed of\r\nabout nine parts silica and one part water.\r\n\r\nThe colors vary from chalky-white to bluish-white, from yellow to red,\r\nand from a slight play of colors to the beautiful mingling of green,\r\nblue, and red with the most remarkable kaleidoscopic effects.\r\n\r\nThe opal is 5.5 to 6 in hardness, specific gravity 2 to 2.1, lustre\r\nglassy, and translucent from a slight to a very high degree.\r\n\r\nThe opal is found in an amorphous state and never crystallizes; in fact\r\nfrom the condition of the pockets in which this mineral is found, the\r\nindications are that the substance was once a fluid.\r\n\r\nUnder the blow-pipe the opal loses its translucency and cracks but does\r\nnot melt. Sulphuric acid will cause it to turn black, and in a cold\r\nsolution of caustic potash the opal is almost entirely soluble.\r\n\r\nThe precious or noble opal is found chiefly in the mines of\r\nCzernowitza, between Kaschau and Eperies, in Hungary, and in Gracias á\r\nDios, a province in Honduras.\r\n\r\nIn olden times, the Greek and Turkish merchants carried opals from\r\nHungary to the Orient, and then they were shipped to Holland and sold\r\nin Europe as Oriental opals.\r\n\r\nThe fire opal is of a yellowish-red color, and is found chiefly\r\nin Mexico, although it also occurs in Hungary, the Faroe Islands,\r\nHonduras, and Guatemala.\r\n\r\nThe common opal is found in Ireland, Denmark, Frankfurt, Guatemala,\r\nand South Australia, and also in Hungary and Mexico. These opals are\r\ntranslucent without fire or reflection.\r\n\r\nThe hydrophane is an opal that has lost color and brilliancy by reason\r\nof the evaporation of its water. If placed in water or alcohol, this\r\nstone becomes transparent, only to lose this quality when the water or\r\nalcohol has evaporated.\r\n\r\nThe hydrophane becomes transparent more quickly in warm than in cold\r\nwater, but most rapidly in alcohol. If boiled in oil, the hydrophane is\r\nsaid to retain its brilliancy for years.\r\n\r\nThe cachelong is milky-white, and nearly opaque, and is found in small\r\nmasses in the river Cach, in Bucharia, and also in Iceland.\r\n\r\nAlthough one of the most magnificent of the gem stones, the opal for\r\nmany years was under the ban of superstition. Now, this splendid stone\r\nonce more commands a foremost place in the jewelers’ art, and the opal\r\nmines of Hungary and Queensland are being worked to their fullest\r\nextent to supply the demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEARL.\r\n\r\nAlthough an organic product, the pearl is always ranked amongst the\r\nmost precious of gems, and is distinguished by being the only gem that\r\ndoes not require the lapidary’s touch to bring out its beauties.\r\n\r\nAncient writers have accounted for the origin of pearls by saying\r\nthat they were formed of angels’ tears, or drops of dew from heaven,\r\nwhich, during the midsummer nights, fell into the gaping mouths of the\r\npearl-oysters.\r\n\r\nAccording to modern scientific investigation, the formation of the\r\npearl does not seem to be the result of healthy natural causes, but\r\ncomes from the efforts of the oyster to rid itself of some foreign\r\nsubstance, like a grain of sand, a bit of shell or vegetation, or some\r\nunwelcome visitor in the shape of a small water insect.\r\n\r\nWhen annoyed by an intruding substance, the oyster begins to deposit\r\nits nacre, or mother-of-pearl, in regular concentric layers around\r\nthe intruder, these layers gradually increasing in circumference\r\nand forming the pearl. Thus, like an onion, the pearl is merely a\r\nsuccession of layers or skins, starting from a small core, or nucleus,\r\nwhich is always present, though often only of microscopical size.\r\n\r\nPearls have sometimes been found where the outer layer, or skin, as it\r\nis technically called, has been discolored or otherwise injured, and\r\nwhen this top skin has been carefully removed the result was a somewhat\r\nsmaller but perfect pearl.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is a very delicate operation, and at the pearling\r\ngrounds is only resorted to by men of experience. The composition of\r\nthe pearl is carbonate of lime, with a small proportion of organic\r\nmatter, and the specific gravity 2.5 to 2.7.\r\n\r\nThe pearl is affected by acids, and is easily calcined on exposure to\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nIn color, the pure white, slightly transparent, is the most highly\r\nprized; while in India and China the bright yellow colors are sought\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nDecided colors, however, such as black, pink, and golden-yellow bring a\r\nhigh price, and, in fact, black pearls, if perfect in color and shape,\r\nare at present more valuable than any other kind.\r\n\r\nThe beauty and value of a pearl depend on form, quality of texture or\r\nskin, color, transparency or water, and lustre or orient.\r\n\r\nIn form, the perfectly round shape comes first in value, then a finely\r\nformed drop or pear shape, and lastly the oval or egg shape.\r\n\r\nPearls that are flat on one side and rounded on the other are called\r\nboutons or button pearls. These are frequently found attached to the\r\nshell, and are cut out and the bottom part smoothed and polished.\r\n\r\nIt is easy, however, to detect this class of pearls by the lack of\r\npearly lustre on the side that was attached to the shell.\r\n\r\nWhen a pearl is rough and odd-shaped it is called a baroque, and some\r\nextremely fantastic shapes are found, especially in fresh-water oysters.\r\n\r\nThe texture or skin of a fine pearl should be perfectly smooth and free\r\nfrom all spots, indentations, wrinkles, or scratches.\r\n\r\nPure white is the desirable color for a gem pearl, but many others that\r\nare slightly tinted with blue, pink, or yellow will pass for gems if\r\nthey are otherwise perfect.\r\n\r\nThe transparency or “water” of a pearl, while not existing in fact,\r\nis still one of the requisites of a fine pearl; there must be an\r\nappearance of transparency, which adds to the beauty of the gem.\r\n\r\nTo describe the lustre or orient of the pearl, the author can\r\nonly use the term pearly, as there is no other substance that\r\napproaches the brilliancy and color of a pearl, excepting, of course,\r\nmother-of-pearl—the nacre in the pearl-oyster.\r\n\r\nWithout orient or lustre, the pearl of finest form and color has but\r\nlittle value.\r\n\r\nLustre is to the pearl what brilliancy is to the diamond; when the\r\norient is absent there is no life, no beauty.\r\n\r\nPearls are principally supplied by two groups of pearl-oysters or\r\nmussels: the marine or meleagrina margaritifera, a round-cornered\r\nsquare shell with very thick sides, measuring six to eight inches in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe color of this shell is mostly blackish-green, but it is also\r\nsometimes yellowish; the edges of the inner part of the shell are\r\nblack, but the rest of the interior is the beautiful mother-of-pearl.\r\n\r\nThe oyster itself is small for the size of the shell.\r\n\r\nThis specimen is found on the coast of Ceylon, Persian Gulf, Japanese,\r\nMexican and California coasts, the western shores of South America,\r\nBrazil, West Indian Islands, Panama, Sooloo Archipelago, and the\r\nnortheast and northwestern coast of Australia.\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water or unio margaritifera is an even, egg-shaped mussel\r\nfound in brooks, rivers, and lakes in temperate zones in nearly all\r\nparts of the world.\r\n\r\nSome fine river pearls have been found in the United States, but most\r\nof the American pearls are of a button or elongated shape, or are\r\nbaroques or fancy-shaped.\r\n\r\nIn China many people engage in the business of making small pellets of\r\nclay or metal images, which in the month of May are introduced into the\r\nriver mussels (mytilus cygneus).\r\n\r\nThe mussels are replanted, and in November they are taken up again.\r\nSome of the oysters die, but most of them are found to have been\r\nactively at work covering the little pellets or metal figures with\r\nnacre, and while no strictly first-class pearls are formed in this way,\r\nmany curious little pearl figures or gods are made and sold to the\r\ncurious or devout.\r\n\r\nPink or conch pearls are found in the Gulf of California and coasts\r\nof Mexico, Bahama Islands, West Indian Islands, and in some rivers in\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nThey seldom occur in regular shapes, and although they are termed pink\r\npearls, they range in color from red to pale yellow, and are often\r\nfound of a china-white color.\r\n\r\nThe pink pearl displays a wavy appearance and a peculiar sheen,\r\nsomething like watered silk. As the pink pearl is seldom found\r\nperfectly round and of a good color, such a specimen is very valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRYSOLITE.\r\n\r\nThe chrysolite, peridot, and olivine differ in color, but are\r\npractically of the same composition.\r\n\r\nThe chrysolite proper is of a pale greenish-yellow color, the peridot a\r\ndeep olive-green, and the olivine of a yellowish or light olive-green\r\ncolor; these stones also shade into brown. They crystallize on the\r\nrhombic system, are transparent to translucent, 6.5 to 7. in the scale\r\nof hardness, and 3.3 to 3.5 in specific gravity.\r\n\r\nThe cleavage is distinct, fracture conchoidal, refraction double, and\r\nlustre vitreous, and in the olivines somewhat greasy.\r\n\r\nThese stones are easily affected by sulphuric acid, but are infusible\r\nbefore the blow-pipe, excepting some kinds containing much iron.\r\n\r\nWith borax, they melt to a pale-green transparent glass.\r\n\r\nChrysolites are composed of silica, magnesia, and oxide of iron.\r\n\r\nPerfectly crystallized chrysolites are brought from Constantinople, but\r\nthe exact locality where they are found is unknown.\r\n\r\nLess distinct specimens occur at Vesuvius, Mexico, the isle of Bourbon,\r\nAuvergne, Egypt, Natolia, Brazil, Germany, Pegu, Ceylon, Switzerland,\r\nand North America.\r\n\r\nPeridots are distinguished by being the only precious stones that have\r\nliterally dropped from heaven, as they have been found in meteorites.\r\n\r\nThe Oriental chrysolite of commerce is true chrysoberyl, and is harder\r\nand heavier than chrysolite, and the stone called Ceylon chrysolite is\r\na greenish-yellow tourmaline, which is easily distinguished, as it is\r\nalso harder while considerably lighter than the chrysolite.\r\n\r\nThe green garnet is of a pronounced green color, and is harder and\r\nheavier than the olivine or chrysolite. Although suitable for mounting\r\nin brooches and other ornaments, these stones are not sufficiently hard\r\nfor the rough usage as ring-stones.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARNET.\r\n\r\nAlmandine, almandite, Syrian garnet, essonite, cinnamon-stone, pyrope,\r\nBohemian garnet, vermeille, Cape garnet, Cape ruby, Arizona ruby,\r\nAmerican ruby, carbuncle, uwarowite, demantoide, grossularite, and\r\nBobrowska garnet are some of the scientific and commercial names for\r\ndifferent species and colors of the garnet group.\r\n\r\nThe crystallization of the garnet is isometric, refraction single,\r\nspecific gravity 3.15 to 4.3, hardness 5 to 8, lustre vitreous,\r\nfracture uneven, colors red, violet, brown, yellow, green, and white,\r\nand the various shadings of these colors.\r\n\r\nMost varieties fuse easily to a brown or black glass; the uwarowite\r\nfuses with borax to a clear chrome-green glass.\r\n\r\nSyrian, almandine, almandite, and carbuncle are different names for the\r\niron-alumina garnet.\r\n\r\nIn colors, these stones shade from deep-red to violet and brownish-red,\r\nand are composed of:\r\n\r\n    Silica                 36.01\r\n    Alumina                20.06\r\n    Protoxide of iron      43.03\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity is 4. to 4.2, and hardness 7.5.\r\n\r\nThis garnet, sometimes called the precious garnet, is found in Ceylon,\r\nPegu, Brazil, Greenland, Hindustan, Bohemia, Tyrol, Œtzthal, Carinthia,\r\nStyria, Switzerland, Ariolo, Canaria, Maggia, Hungary, Sweden, Norway,\r\nScotland, Spain, and the United States.\r\n\r\nGrossularite, or lime-alumina garnet, is known in commerce as essonite,\r\nor cinnamon-stone. The color is yellow, of various shades; specific\r\ngravity 3.5 to 3.65, and hardness 6.5.\r\n\r\nThese stones are sometimes sold for jacinths, but they are softer than\r\nthe jacinth, and melt easily before the blow-pipe. Essonites come\r\nprincipally from Ceylon, but are also found in other places.\r\n\r\nPyrope or Bohemian garnet is the magnesia-alumina variety, and is of\r\na uniform dark blood-red color. This stone is found in Bohemia, and\r\nalthough quantities of small pieces are found, large specimens are\r\nrare, and a piece that will cut into a four- or five-carat stone is\r\nseldom met with and commands a high price.\r\n\r\nThese garnets are found at Stiefelburg by Meronitz, Triblitz,\r\nPodsedlitz, and Neupaka.\r\n\r\nThe pyrope turns black under the blow-pipe, then red again, and melts\r\nwith difficulty into a black glass. With borax it melts to an\r\nemerald-green glass. The specific gravity of this garnet is 3.69 to\r\n3.78, and hardness 7.5.\r\n\r\nVermeille is a name given to the orange-red almandine, Cape garnet to\r\nthe bright red-yellow variety, Cape ruby to the pyrope, and American\r\nruby to the blood-red kind found in New Mexico, Montana, and Arizona.\r\nCarbuncle is a term applied _to all_ garnets cut with a smooth rounding\r\ntop, sometimes called, after the French, cabochon.\r\n\r\nUwarowite or lime-chrome garnet is one of the rarest and most beautiful\r\nof the garnet group.\r\n\r\nThe color of this stone is emerald-green, hardness 7.5, and specific\r\ngravity 3.41 to 3.52. Uwarowites are found near Bissersk in the Urals\r\nof Russia, but rarely in specimens of sufficient size to cut into gems.\r\n\r\nThis garnet is heavier and harder than the true emerald.\r\n\r\nDemantoide or Bobrowska garnet is a soft garnet, olive-green to brown\r\nand blackish-green in color, sometimes light green. It is found in\r\nthe Bobrowska River in the Urals. The specific gravity is 3.85,\r\nand hardness about 6, its softness making it undesirable for many\r\nornaments. Before the blow-pipe it fuses into a black bead.\r\n\r\nThese garnets are often sold as olivines; they are heavier than\r\nolivines and softer.\r\n\r\nDemantoide is composed of:\r\n\r\n    Silica                   35.44\r\n    Lime                     32.85\r\n    Sesquioxide of iron      32.85\r\n    Magnesia                   .20\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPAZ.\r\n\r\nTopaz belongs to the rhombic system of crystallization. Its cleavage\r\nis basal and perfect, fracture uneven, hardness 8, scratching quartz\r\ndistinctly, specific gravity 3.4 to 3.6, lustre vitreous, refraction\r\ndouble, and colors ranging from colorless or white to bluish-white,\r\nlight blue, wine-yellow, straw-yellow, golden-yellow, greenish- and\r\npale-red to pink.\r\n\r\nTopaz becomes electric from rubbing or pressure, and retains\r\nelectricity for twenty-four hours. Before the blow-pipe topaz partly\r\nloses color, but does not melt, and with borax it fuses slowly to a\r\nwhite bead.\r\n\r\nTopaz is partially attacked by sulphuric acid, and dissolves in salts\r\nof phosphorus.\r\n\r\nThe composition of topaz is:\r\n\r\n    Silicon        15.05\r\n    Aluminium      30.02\r\n    Oxygen         36.08\r\n    Fluorine       17.05\r\n\r\nGoutte d’eau or colorless topaz, sometimes called “slaves diamond,”\r\nSiberian or bluish-white, Brazilian or golden to reddish-yellow, Saxony\r\nor pale-wine yellow, Brazilian ruby or pink, Brazilian sapphire or\r\nlight blue, and aquamarine or greenish, are the various commercial\r\nnames for topaz.\r\n\r\nMost of the Brazilian rubies or pink topazes are produced by heating\r\nthe reddish or dark-yellow variety, either in a crucible or by\r\nenveloping the stone in German tinder and setting fire to the tinder.\r\nIf heated too much, the stone is apt to become colorless, and if\r\nsuddenly cooled it may crack.\r\n\r\nColorless or white topaz takes a very high polish, and is wonderfully\r\nclear and transparent.\r\n\r\nThe great Portuguese diamond, “The Braganza,” of about 1,680 carats, is\r\nsupposed to be a white topaz.\r\n\r\nTopaz is found in the Urals, Kamschatka, Alabaschka, Miask,\r\nNestschinsk, Adun Tschilon, Villa Rica, Boa Vista, Capao, Lana, Minas\r\nNovas, Cairngorm Mts., Schlackenwald, Zinnwald, Schneckenstein,\r\nEhrenfriedensdorf, Altenburg, Orenburg, Mourne Mts.—Ireland,\r\nAustralia, New South Wales, Ceylon, Mexico, and the United States.\r\nFalse topaz, or the ordinary topaz of commerce, is yellow quartz\r\nresembling yellow topaz, but lacking its brilliancy and hardness; it is\r\nalso very much lighter, being only 2.5 to 2.7 in specific gravity.\r\n\r\nBeryl and chrysolite are often mistaken for topaz, but as they are\r\nsofter and beryl is much lighter, they are easily distinguished\r\nfrom the topaz. The strong electric property of the topaz is also a\r\nconclusive test.\r\n\r\nOriental topaz, or yellow corundum, is harder and heavier than the\r\noccidental or true topaz.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPATITE.\r\n\r\nApatite, which is seldom used as a gem stone, sometimes resembles the\r\nberyl and emerald, but is much softer and rarely has the color and\r\nbrightness combined of the former gems.\r\n\r\nThis mineral, composed principally of subsesquiphosphate of lime,\r\nis 4.5 to 5. in hardness, has the specific gravity of 2.95 to 3.25,\r\nis transparent to opaque, vitreous in lustre, infusible before the\r\nblow-pipe, and dissolves slowly in nitric acid. In colors, apatite\r\nvaries from colorless to sea-green, bluish-green, violet-blue, gray,\r\nyellow, red, and brown.\r\n\r\nApatite is found in Saxony, the Hartz Mts., Bohemia, Norway, Bavaria,\r\nEngland, St. Gothard in Switzerland, and in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELSPAR.\r\n\r\nFour varieties of felspar are used as gem stones—moonstone or\r\northoclase, sunstone or avanturine felspar, Amazon stone or green\r\nfelspar, and Labrador or Labrador spar.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOONSTONE.\r\n\r\nThis variety of felspar is called orthoclase, adularia, and orthose,\r\nbesides the commercial names of fish-eye, Ceylon or water opal, and in\r\nthe yellow and red tints sunstone. Moonstone occurs in crystals and\r\ncrystalline fragments, also massive and granular; its hardness is 6. to\r\n6.5, specific gravity 2.4 to 2.6, refraction double, is not attacked by\r\nacids, and is composed of:\r\n\r\n    Silica              64.5\r\n    Alumina             18.5\r\n    Potash              17.\r\n    With traces of soda.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful stone is the clearest of all varieties of felspar. It\r\nis colorless, or only slightly tinted with blue, green, yellow, and\r\nflesh-red, and is transparent to translucent.\r\n\r\nThe lustre is vitreous, and a brilliant pearly streak of white light\r\nplays from side to side.\r\n\r\nThe yellowish- and reddish-tinted specimens are called sunstones,\r\nand are quite rare. These sunstones must not be confounded with the\r\navanturine or felspar sunstone.\r\n\r\nMoonstones are found principally in Ceylon and on the St. Gothard in\r\nSwitzerland, but also occur in Bavaria, Greenland, Tyrol, Dauphine,\r\nNorway, and the United States.\r\n\r\nDuring the past few years, large quantities of moonstone balls, cut\r\nlike whole pearls, have been used for jewelry—the stones being much\r\nsought as well because of their beauty as on the ground of the popular\r\nsuperstition that they will bring good luck to the wearer.\r\n\r\nSmall pieces or balls are not very valuable, but large perfect\r\nspecimens command a good price.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNSTONE.\r\n\r\n(AVANTURINE FELSPAR.)\r\n\r\nSunstone or avanturine felspar is a variety of oligoclase;\r\ngrayish-white to reddish-gray in color, usually the latter; containing\r\nminute crystals of hematite, göthite or mica, which are imbedded and\r\nscattered through the stone, and give forth golden-yellow, reddish, or\r\nprismatic reflections. The hardness is 6 to 7, specific gravity 2.56 to\r\n2.72, and lustre pearly or waxy to vitreous.\r\n\r\nSunstones are found near Stockholm, in Finland, the Urals, Ceylon, the\r\nAlps, Iceland, the United States, and other places.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMAZON STONE.\r\n\r\n(GREEN FELSPAR.)\r\n\r\nThe Amazon stone is a green variety of felspar, which was first found\r\non the banks of the Amazon River, but now comes from Siberia and the\r\nUnited States. This stone consists of potash, alumina, and silex—is\r\ngreen in color but rarely clean, being discolored in places and usually\r\ncovered with small white spots.\r\n\r\nThe Amazon stone is harder than glass, but is scratched by rock\r\ncrystal. Its specific gravity is 2.5 to 2.6; acids do not affect it,\r\nand it melts with difficulty before the blow-pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABRADORITE.\r\n\r\nLabrador stone or labradorite is sometimes known as opaline felspar,\r\nand was first discovered on the island of St. Paul on the coast of\r\nLabrador.\r\n\r\nLabradorite is translucent to opaque, gray-green or brown in color, and\r\nhas beautiful chatoyant reflections of brilliant blue, sea-green,\r\nand sometimes red and yellow, changing from one color to another.\r\nLabradorite is 6 in hardness, has a specific gravity of 2.62 to 2.76; a\r\nvitreous to pearly lustre, is brittle, fuses with difficulty before the\r\nblow-pipe, and is decomposed by muriatic acid. It is composed of:\r\n\r\n    Silica       52.9\r\n    Alumina      30.3\r\n    Lime         12.3\r\n    Soda          4.5\r\n\r\nLarge masses of this stone are found on the coast of Labrador. It\r\nis also found in Finland, Russia, and the United States. Because of\r\nthe dark chatoyant appearance the name of œil de bœuf or ox-eye is\r\nsometimes applied to labradorite. Handsome specimens, cut cabochon,\r\nform pretty ring stones, and many effective engraved cameos have been\r\nproduced by using the bright portion for the relief work and the gray\r\ndead part for the base.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYANITE.\r\n\r\nThis stone is the transparent variety of disthene, and is sometimes\r\ncommercially known as sappare. Cyanite is colorless to bluish-white,\r\nsky-blue, berlin blue, yellowish- and reddish-white, gray, and green.\r\n\r\nThe hardness is 5 to 7, specific gravity 3.45 to 3.70, lustre vitreous\r\nand pearly; it is infusible before the blow-pipe, but fuses with borax;\r\nis not attacked by acids, and is composed of:\r\n\r\n    Silica       36.8\r\n    Alumina      63.2\r\n\r\nCyanite is found in Switzerland, the Tyrol, Styria, Carinthia, Bohemia,\r\nNorway, Finland, France, South America, Scotland, Ireland, Siberia, the\r\nEast Indies, and the United States. Clean specimens are not plentiful,\r\nand fine blue pieces have frequently been sold for sapphires. The\r\ncyanite can be distinguished from the sapphire by its inferior hardness\r\nand lighter weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAPIS LAZULI.\r\n\r\nLapis lazuli, the sapphire of the ancients, is a mineral, translucent\r\nto opaque, ranging in color from colorless to an azure-blue,\r\nviolet-blue, green, and red.\r\n\r\nThe principal color, however, is a rich, azure blue, sometimes shading\r\ninto green, and having a vitreous to greasy lustre.\r\n\r\nIts hardness is 5 to 5.5, specific gravity 2.38 to 2.42; it is\r\ndecomposed by muriatic acid, and fuses before the blow-pipe to a white\r\nglass. It is rarely found clean, but has usually a number of veins and\r\nspots of a metallic nature. It is composed of:\r\n\r\n            Silica                45.\r\n            Alumina               31.76\r\n            Soda                   9.09\r\n            Lime                   3.52\r\n            Sulphuric acid         5.89\r\n   and traces of iron, soda, and potash.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is found in Siberia, Transylvania, Persia, China, Thibet,\r\nTartary, South America, India, and Brazil.\r\n\r\nLapis lazuli is sometimes employed for jewelry, and was for some\r\ncenturies ground up and used to make the mineral paint known as genuine\r\nultramarine. This paint is now produced chemically, and the more costly\r\nmineral compound is rarely used.\r\n\r\nThe imitation of lapis lazuli for jewelry purposes is also very easy,\r\nas metal filings can be readily introduced into the azure blue glass,\r\nand thus an imitation of the genuine stone produced, which is perfect\r\nexcepting in hardness.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDDENITE.\r\n\r\nThe hiddenite is a variety of spodumene that has only been found in one\r\nlocality, namely, Alexander County, North Carolina. This mineral was\r\ndiscovered by W. E. Hidden, and has been named after him.\r\n\r\nThe hiddenite is perfectly transparent, and varies from a pale\r\nyellowish- to a deep emerald-green, being very brilliant, and\r\napproaching the emerald in color. As this stone is rarely found large\r\nenough for cutting into gems, it is highly prized, and good specimens\r\ncommand a large price.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of the hiddenite is 6.5 to 7, and specific gravity 3.13\r\nto 3.19; before the blow-pipe it melts to a clear glass, and it is\r\nattacked by salts of phosphorus. It is composed of:\r\n\r\n          Silica             64.35\r\n          Alumina            26.58\r\n          Lithia              7.05\r\n     with traces of iron and soda.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPODUMENE.\r\n\r\nSpodumene is sometimes cut and polished as a gem, but its peculiar\r\ncleavage makes it a bad stone for the lapidary to cut and the jeweler\r\nto mount.\r\n\r\nIts hardness is 6.5 to 7, specific gravity 3.13 to 3.19, and lustre,\r\nvitreous to pearly.\r\n\r\nGrayish-green, greenish-white, and sometimes yellow or faint red are\r\nthe colors. Its composition is:\r\n\r\n    Silica       64.2\r\n    Alumina      29.4\r\n    Lithia        6.4\r\n\r\nAcids do not attack spodumene, and under the blow-pipe it fuses to a\r\nwhite glass.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is found in Sweden, the Tyrol, Ireland, Scotland, and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\nDICHROITE.\r\n\r\nDichroite is sometimes known under the mineralogical names of\r\ncordierite and iolite, and commercially as _saphir d’eau_, or water\r\nsapphire. This stone is remarkable for pleichroism, sometimes showing\r\nthree different colors in as many directions, and when properly cut has\r\noften the star formation of the corundum star-stones.\r\n\r\nWater sapphire, as the blue specimens are called, is 7 to 7.5 in\r\nhardness, specific gravity 2.56 to 2.67, transparent to translucent,\r\nand frequently full of flaws. It is partially decomposed by acids,\r\nmelts with difficulty before the blow-pipe, is vitreous to greasy in\r\nlustre, and is composed of:\r\n\r\n    Silica            49.\r\n    Alumina           32.\r\n    Ferrous oxide      7.\r\n    Magnesia           9.\r\n\r\nBesides the _saphir d’eau_, which is blue, dichroite occurs colorless,\r\nbluish-white, yellowish-white, yellowish-gray to yellowish-brown,\r\nindigo to blackish-blue, and violet. This mineral is found in Ceylon,\r\nSpain, Norway, Sweden, Tuscany, Greenland, and Bavaria. Sapphire is\r\nharder and much heavier than dichroite.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDOCRASE.\r\n\r\nIdocrase or vesuvianite was first found amongst the ancient ejections\r\nof Vesuvius, and it is still found at Vesuvius in hair-brown to\r\nolive-green colors.\r\n\r\nVesuvianite is 6.5 in hardness, 3.35 to 3.45 in specific gravity,\r\ntransparent to opaque, lustre vitreous to greasy. It possesses strong\r\ndouble refraction, is attacked by acids, and melts readily under the\r\nblow-pipe. Vesuvianite consists of:\r\n\r\n    Silica                  37.75\r\n    Alumina                 17.23\r\n    Sesquioxide of iron      4.43\r\n    Magnesia                 3.79\r\n    Lime                    37.35\r\n\r\nIn colors, this mineral shades from brown to black, yellow, pale-blue,\r\nand green, and it is found at Vesuvius, Alps, Piedmont, Mt. Somma,\r\nEtna, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Hungary, Urals, and the United States.\r\n\r\nTransparent or strongly translucent specimens, in handsome green or\r\nbrown varieties, are used for jewelry, principally, however, in Turin\r\nand Naples.\r\n\r\nChrysolite and green garnet are sometimes substituted for vesuvianite.\r\nThe first has a greater specific gravity and is more vivid in color,\r\nand the latter is also heavier and harder.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUCLASE.\r\n\r\nEuclase is very brittle, and therefore is rarely used as an ornamental\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nThis mineral has the hardness of 7.5; specific gravity, 3.1; lustre,\r\nvitreous to pearly; it is transparent to semi-transparent, doubly\r\nrefractive, is not acted upon by acids, fuses under the blow-pipe to a\r\nwhite enamel, and is composed of:\r\n\r\n    Silica       41.2\r\n    Alumina      35.2\r\n    Glucina      17.4\r\n    Water         6.2\r\n\r\nEuclase occurs in Brazil, in the neighborhood of Villa Rica, and also\r\nin the Urals, in colorless, pale green, blue, pale yellow, and white\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPHENE.\r\n\r\nSphene or titanite is also a brittle mineral, 5 to 5.5 in hardness;\r\nspecific gravity, 3.4 to 3.56; transparent, doubly refractive; lustre,\r\nadamantine to resinous; colors, brown, gray, yellow, green, black, and\r\ncolorless; and composition:\r\n\r\n    Silica              31\r\n    Titanium oxide      41\r\n    Lime                27\r\n    Ferrous oxide        1\r\n\r\nWhen transparent in colorless, greenish, or yellow colors, this mineral\r\npresents an appearance like the fire opal.\r\n\r\nSphene is found in Switzerland, the Urals, Tyrol, Finland, Wales,\r\nIreland, Germany, Canada, and the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHENACITE.\r\n\r\nThis mineral, rarely used as a gem stone, is 7.5 to 8 in hardness;\r\nspecific gravity, 2.96 to 3; lustre, vitreous; transparent to\r\nsemi-translucent, doubly refractive, it does not melt before the\r\nblow-pipe, and contains:\r\n\r\n    Silica        54.2\r\n    Glucina       45.8\r\n\r\nPhenacite occurs colorless, and also bright wine-yellow inclining to\r\nred, and brown. This stone is found in Russia, Mexico, and Alsace.\r\n\r\nThe colorless or transparent variety approaches the diamond in\r\nbrilliancy, especially under artificial light.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPIDOTE.\r\n\r\nEpidote usually occurs in a peculiar yellowish-green, called pistachio\r\ngreen, a color that is seldom found in other minerals. Besides\r\nthis color, olive, brownish-green, greenish-black and black, red,\r\nyellow-gray, and grayish-white occur. The hardness of epidote is 6\r\nto 7; specific gravity, 3.32 to 3.50; lustre, vitreous to pearly;\r\nrefraction, double. The stone is transparent to opaque, is attacked by\r\nacids, and is slightly affected by the blow-pipe. It is composed of:\r\n\r\n    Silica            38\r\n    Alumina           22\r\n    Ferric oxide      15\r\n    Lime              23\r\n    Water              2\r\n\r\nEpidote is found in Norway, Saxony, Siberia, Brazil, on the St.\r\nGothard, in Switzerland, in the Tyrol, and in the Hartz.\r\n\r\n\r\nAXINITE.\r\n\r\nAxinite is a brittle mineral which has occasionally furnished some\r\npretty gem stones.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of this stone is 6.5 to 7; specific gravity, 3. to 3.3;\r\nlustre, vitreous. It is transparent to translucent, is not attacked by\r\nacids, and melts readily before blow-pipe. It is composed of:\r\n\r\n    Silica                  43\r\n    Lime                    20\r\n    Alumina                 16\r\n    Ferric oxide            10\r\n    Boron trioxide           5\r\n    Manganese dioxide        3\r\n    Magnesia                 2\r\n    Potash                   1\r\n\r\nAxinite occurs in clove-brown, plum-blue, and pearl-gray, and exhibits\r\ntrichroism. The best specimens come from St. Christophe in Dauphiny,\r\nbut it is also found at Santa Maria, and in Switzerland, Sweden,\r\nEngland, Chili, Saxony, the Hartz Mountains, and the United States.\r\n\r\nAxinite is usually cut, like the opal, cabochon, but is rarely used as\r\na gem stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIOPSIDE.\r\n\r\nDiopside is cut and sometimes sold in Turin and in Chamouny as a gem\r\nstone, but no great quantity of this mineral is used for ornamental\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of diopside is 5 to 6; specific gravity, 2.9 to 3.5;\r\nlustre, vitreous to greasy. It is transparent to translucent, brittle,\r\ncannot be dissolved by acids, and melts before the blow-pipe. It is\r\ncomposed of:\r\n\r\n    Silica               54\r\n    Lime                 24\r\n    Magnesia             18\r\n    Ferrous oxide         4\r\n\r\nThis mineral is grayish-white to pearl-gray, and greenish-white to\r\ngreenish-gray. The best green transparent specimens are from the Mussa\r\nAlp and Zillerthal, but it is also found in the Urals and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLUOR SPAR.\r\n\r\nThis mineral occurs in many colors, often approaching the finer gems\r\nin appearance, and bearing the commercial names of false ruby, false\r\nemerald, false topaz, etc., etc., according to its color.\r\n\r\nFluor spar is brittle, 4 in hardness, has the specific gravity of 3.1\r\nto 3.2, single refraction, is transparent to translucent, has a\r\nvitreous lustre, phosphoresces when heated, is attacked by acids, and\r\nmelts before the blow-pipe. It is composed of:\r\n\r\n    Fluorine         48.7\r\n    Calcium          51.3\r\n\r\nWhite, yellow, green, rose- and crimson-red, violet-blue, sky-blue,\r\nand brown, wine-yellow, greenish-blue, and gray are the colors of this\r\nmany-tinted mineral.\r\n\r\nFluor spar is found in England, Norway, Baden, Nova Scotia, Thuringia,\r\nthe Alps, Saxony, and the United States.\r\n\r\nLarge pieces of this mineral are made into beautiful vases and\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPERSTHENE.\r\n\r\nHandsome specimens of hypersthene or Labrador hornblende are used for\r\nornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is found in crystalline masses, has the hardness of\r\n6, specific gravity 3.3 to 3.4, lustre pearly to metallic. It is\r\ntranslucent to opaque, brittle, and fuses before the blow-pipe. It\r\nconsists of:\r\n\r\n    Silica                    54.2\r\n    Magnesia                  24.1\r\n    Protoxide of iron         21.7\r\n\r\nHypersthene occurs in dark-brown, green, grayish-black, greenish-black,\r\nand jet-black colors, and is found in the isle of Skye, the Hartz\r\nMountains, Saxony, Labrador, Greenland, Norway, Sweden, Bohemia,\r\nThuringia, and the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUARTZ.\r\n\r\nThe quartz group is the largest and most diversified among precious\r\nstones. Quartz occurs _massive_, in concretions, and in confused\r\ncrystalline masses.\r\n\r\nOn account of the abundance of the massive kinds, such as jasper,\r\nagates, onyx, etc., some writers place the quartz group under the\r\nhead of semi-precious stones, and lately the United States customs\r\nauthorities have gone further in that direction, and have ruled that\r\n“because of the abundance and comparative cheapness of agates, onyxes,\r\netc., they were no longer precious stones.” This position, however, the\r\ncustom-house speedily abandoned, and, for dutiable purposes at least,\r\nthe quartz family, in all its ramifications, is recognized as belonging\r\nto the precious stones.\r\n\r\nHarder than the tourmaline, turquois, or opal, as hard as the\r\nchrysolite, and nearly as hard as the garnet or emerald, there is no\r\nreason why the crystallized varieties, such as amethyst, cairngorm,\r\nfalse topaz, chrysoprase, and even the cat’s-eye and finer onyxes,\r\nshould not be classed among the precious stones.\r\n\r\nSome more plentiful and less beautiful varieties of quartz are not\r\nvaluable, and they take the same position in the quartz family that the\r\nhuge imperfect crystals do in the beryl group. Whenever the specimen is\r\nsufficiently beautiful to be cut and polished for setting in jewelry,\r\nit should be included under the precious stones.\r\n\r\nQuartz crystallizes in the rhombohedral system, and many varieties are\r\nfound massive and compact. The cleavage is indistinct but can sometimes\r\nbe found by plunging a heated crystal into cold water. The hardness of\r\nquartz is 7; specific gravity 2.5 to 2.8, the purest kinds being 2.65;\r\nthe lustre is vitreous to resinous, and fracture conchoidal.\r\n\r\nQuartz is tough, brittle, and feels cold; it becomes positively\r\nelectric by rubbing, shows phosphorescence in the dark, and gives\r\nsparks if struck with another piece of quartz or with steel.\r\n\r\nQuartz is transparent to translucent, semi-translucent to opaque,\r\ndoubly refractive, and does not melt before the ordinary blow-pipe, but\r\nmay be melted with the oxyhydrogen blow-pipe. It also melts with soda\r\nto a clear glass, and is soluble in fluohydric acid.\r\n\r\nQuartz is composed of pure silica\r\n\r\n    Oxygen          53\r\n    Silicon         47\r\n\r\nSome of the impure varieties contain oxide of iron, carbonate of lime,\r\nclay, and other minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRYSTALLIZED QUARTZ.\r\n\r\nColorless quartz or pure rock-crystal is found in many parts of the\r\nworld, notably in Switzerland, Dauphiny, Piedmont, the Carrara quarries\r\nin Italy, Canada; in Herkimer County, New York, and on the shores of\r\nLake George, in the same place; at Hot Springs, Arkansas; and along the\r\nbeach of Long Branch, Cape May, and many other places.\r\n\r\nRock-crystal, commercially known as Bohemian diamond, occidental\r\ndiamond, Lake George diamond, rhinestone, pebble, etc., etc., is\r\ncolorless and transparent. This stone is largely used for optical\r\npurposes, and is also sometimes cut into brilliants to imitate the\r\ndiamond.\r\n\r\nWhile rock-crystal is considerably harder than strass or paste, it\r\nlacks, however, the brilliancy of the fine-composition imitation\r\ndiamond.\r\n\r\nBesides being much softer, the paste is often heavier than the crystal,\r\nbecause of the quantity of lead and other minerals used in its\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMETHYST.\r\n\r\nAmethystine quartz or amethyst varies in color from light to clear-dark\r\npurple, sometimes nearly black, and from light to dark bluish-violet.\r\nThe coloring of the stone is supposed to be due to manganese.\r\n\r\nThe best amethysts come from Brazil and Ceylon, but good specimens are\r\nfound in India, Persia, Botany Bay, Transylvania, near Cork and the\r\nisland of May in Ireland, at Oberstein, in Saxony, in Hungary, Siberia,\r\nNova Scotia, Sweden, Bohemia, Canada, and in the States of Maine,\r\nPennsylvania, Colorado, Georgia, Virginia, and Michigan.\r\n\r\nUnder heat, the amethyst turns first yellow, then green, and finally\r\nbecomes colorless. The value of an amethyst depends upon the fashion,\r\nand the time has been when these stones ranked among the most valuable\r\nof precious stones. At present, a fine amethyst can be bought for very\r\nlittle money, but should the stone become fashionable again, the best\r\nspecimens will command good prices.\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW QUARTZ.\r\n\r\nYellow quartz, known as false topaz, Bohemian, occidental, Indian,\r\nor Spanish topaz, resembles the real topaz in color, but is softer,\r\nlighter, different in crystallization and cleavage, and in electrical\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nIn color, this stone varies from the lightest yellow to orange-red and\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nMost of the yellow quartz comes from Brazil, and much of it is changed\r\nto yellow by burning amethyst and smoky quartz.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAIRNGORM, ETC.\r\n\r\nSmoky yellow to smoky brown, often gray and black, are the tints of the\r\ncairngorm. This species of transparent quartz takes its name from\r\nCairngorm in Invernessshire, in Scotland, a locality where some of the\r\nbest specimens have been found. Pike’s Peak, Arkansas, and certain\r\ndistricts in North Carolina have also produced some very fine smoky\r\ntopazes.\r\n\r\nThe cairngorm is used for seals, beads, and some of the cheaper jewels,\r\nand is largely sold at watering-places in Switzerland, and in the\r\nWestern United States.\r\n\r\nThe stone is very popular in Scotland. Hair or needle stones is the\r\nname given to these varieties of crystallized quartz when they contain\r\nforeign substances, such as rutile, manganese, chlorite, etc., in hair\r\nor needle formation.\r\n\r\nThese stones are cut to represent the needle enclosures in an upright\r\nposition, and are called sagenite or Venus hair stones or love arrows.\r\n\r\nIridescent or rainbow quartz is the variety of rock-crystal containing\r\ncracks and fissures which reflect all the colors of the rainbow. Quartz\r\ncan also be artificially colored by rapidly cooling a heated specimen\r\nand then dipping the piece into a coloring preparation; the minute\r\ncracks in the quartz absorb the coloring matter, and the result is a\r\nred-, blue-, or green-tinted stone.\r\n\r\nThe massive varieties of quartz embrace the rose quartz, avanturine,\r\ncat’s-eye, crocidolite, heliotrope, chrysoprase, prase, plasma,\r\nchalcedony, agates, onyx, carnelian, jasper, hornstone, and flint.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE QUARTZ.\r\n\r\nRose quartz occurs in a massive form, usually very imperfect and\r\ncracked, and varying in color from rose-red to pink. The color is\r\nsupposed to be due to titanic acid, and often becomes paler on exposure.\r\n\r\nThis stone is nearly opaque and semi-transparent on the edges, has a\r\ngreasy lustre, and specific gravity of 2.65 to 2.75. Rabenstein near\r\nZwiesel in Bavaria, the United States, Brazil, France, Ceylon, Finland,\r\nand Siberia are places where rose quartz has been found.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVANTURINE.\r\n\r\nAvanturine is an opaque, yellow, brown, or red quartz, spangled with\r\nminute scales of mica or some other mineral, and found principally near\r\nMadrid, in Spain. It is also found in France, Scotland, Bavaria, the\r\nUrals, and Styria.\r\n\r\nA beautiful imitation of avanturine, called goldstone, is manufactured\r\nof glass into which metal filings are introduced. This goldstone\r\nis superior to avanturine in every point except that of hardness.\r\nAvanturine and its imitation, but largely the latter, are used for the\r\ncheaper kinds of jewelry, and were very popular in the United States\r\nsome years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAT’S-EYE.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarian, occidental, or quartz cat’s-eye is found on the coast of\r\nMalabar, Ceylon, Hartz Mountains, and Bavaria.\r\n\r\nThis stone is translucent to opaque, gray, green, brown, red, and the\r\nshadings of these colors, but usually a greenish-gray, with a mass of\r\nfine white lines in the centre, which give to the stone a chatoyant\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe cat’s-eye is usually cut cabochon or carbuncle-shaped, and the\r\nlines (which are due to the fibres of asbestos) are kept in the centre\r\nof the stone, and play like the eye of a cat when the stone is moved.\r\n\r\nThe quartz cat’s-eye is easily distinguished from the oriental of\r\nchrysoberyl cat’s-eye, as it is softer and much lighter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROCIDOLITE.\r\n\r\nCrocidolite or tiger-eye is a light-brown, brownish-yellow to\r\ndark-green, and greenish-blue quartz, which has the same chatoyant\r\nqualities as the cat’s-eye. When cut cabochon, the crocidolite is\r\ncalled tiger-eye.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful mineral was very rare some years ago, and good specimens\r\nwere sold by the carat.\r\n\r\nGreat quantities, however, have lately been found in South Africa, and\r\nalthough the finest pieces are still used for cameos and intaglios,\r\nmany objects, such as paperweights, umbrella handles, match-safes,\r\netc., are now cut from this stone.\r\n\r\nCrocidolite is often artificially colored to very closely imitate some\r\nof the finest shades of the oriental cat’s-eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELIOTROPE.\r\n\r\nHeliotrope or blood-stone, as this variety is commonly called, is a\r\ndark-green quartz, translucent to opaque, and covered with small red\r\nspots or blood-colored blotches, from which the stone derives the name\r\nof blood-stone.\r\n\r\nThis stone has long been used for seal and signet purposes, and many\r\nfine intaglios and cameos carved in blood-stone are in existence.\r\n\r\nBucharia, Tartary, Siberia, East India, China, the island of Rum in the\r\nHebrides, the United States, and Canada are some of the places where\r\nthe heliotrope is found.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRYSOPRASE.\r\n\r\nThe chrysoprase is an apple-green chalcedony, sometimes olive- or\r\nwhitish-green. It is translucent, scratches glass, and has the specific\r\ngravity of 2.56.\r\n\r\nThe color is due to the presence of oxide of nickel. This stone is\r\nfound principally in Silesia, but also in Siberia and the United States.\r\n\r\nLarge pieces of chrysoprase are rare, and even the best specimens lose\r\ntheir color in course of time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRASE.\r\n\r\nA translucent, spotted leek-green, green quartz, which loses its polish\r\non exposure to the air, is known as prase.\r\n\r\nThis stone is found principally in the iron mines of Brietenbaum,\r\nSaxony, and also in Brittany, the Tyrol, Scotland, Salzburg, Finland,\r\nand the United States.\r\n\r\nPrase is sometimes known commercially as “mother of emerald,” and a\r\ngreenish crystalline quartz is also often called prase.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLASMA.\r\n\r\nPlasma is a dark grass-green quartz, feebly translucent, and is\r\nsometimes covered with white or yellow spots. Plasma is somewhat\r\nlighter in weight than the heliotrope and does not take as fine a\r\npolish.\r\n\r\nThis stone is found in India, China, and in the Black Forest, Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHALCEDONY.\r\n\r\nChalcedony is cloudy or translucent, white, yellowish-gray,\r\nblackish-brown, light to dark-blue, milky-white, and black.\r\n\r\nThis quartz is sometimes nearly transparent, waxy in lustre, and in\r\nsome varieties has a light gray and transparent base with dark cloudy\r\nspots. This last variety is called “cloudy chalcedony”. Another kind,\r\nwith gray and white stripes alternating, is known as chalcedonyx.\r\n\r\nIceland, the Faroe Islands, Hüttenberg, Loben, Saxony, Hungary,\r\nNubia, Nova Scotia, Oberstein, Ceylon, India, Siberia, Carinthia, the\r\nHebrides, the United States, and Canada are places where chalcedony is\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGATES.\r\n\r\nAgate is an improved variety of chalcedony and comprises the following\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nBanded or ribbon agate, running in delicate parallel layers.\r\n\r\nEye agate, forming concentric rings with a dark centre, giving the\r\nappearance of a human eye.\r\n\r\nFortification agate, running in circular parallel zigzag lines like the\r\nwalls of a fortress.\r\n\r\nRainbow agate is a thin or concentric structure which when cut across\r\nand held towards the light shows an iridescence.\r\n\r\nMoss agate, light-gray to white and translucent to opaque agates,\r\ndisplay black tracings like fine moss or trees. Mocha or tree agates\r\nare covered with black, brown, or red figures, as of trees and plants.\r\n\r\nBeckite or silicified coral shells, silicified wood, wood agate, wood\r\nopal, cloudy agate, and agate jasper are some of the many varieties of\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nThe common carnelians, blood-stones, and onyxes are usually counted\r\namong the agates.\r\n\r\nUruguay, Brazil, Oberstein, Silesia, Surinam, India, Arabia, Saxony,\r\nScotland, the United States, and Canada are the principal places where\r\nagates are found.\r\n\r\n\r\nONYX OR AGATE ONYX.\r\n\r\nOnyx is a variety of chalcedony in bands or strata of white, gray, and\r\nblack, translucent to opaque, and generally found where agates abound.\r\n\r\nThe layers or bands are in even planes, and the colors, white and\r\nblack, white and brown, or brown, white, and black, alternate. This\r\nstone is largely used for cameos, the base being usually of black or\r\nbrown, and the engraved or upper part white- or cream-colored.\r\n\r\nWhen one or more layers are of carnelian or sard, the stone is called\r\nsard-onyx. Sard is a rich brown color inclining to red, and when held\r\nagainst the light shows a red hue.\r\n\r\nOnyx and sard-onyx are often artificially improved by boiling the\r\nstones in honey, oil, or sugar water, and then in sulphuric acid. The\r\nacid carbonizes the sugar or oil which the stone has absorbed and gives\r\nit a deeper color.\r\n\r\nFor red, protosulphate of iron is added, and for a blue color to\r\nimitate lapis lazuli, yellow prussiate of potash is added to the\r\nprotosulphate of iron.\r\n\r\nOnly the porous parts of the stones, usually the dark parts, absorb the\r\nsugar or oil, and so aid the contrast of the colored with the white\r\nlayers.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARNELIAN.\r\n\r\nCarnelian is a clear red translucent chalcedony, and is usually of a\r\ngray or grayish-red color. Several weeks of exposure to the sun’s rays\r\nand subsequent heating in earthen pots enhances and deepens the color.\r\n\r\nThe brownish-red or dark-brown carnelian is called sardoine or sard;\r\nthe blood-red to pink varieties, with an upper layer of white onyx, are\r\ncalled carnelian onyx, and the stones with a brown or sard base and a\r\nwhite top are called sard-onyx.\r\n\r\nCarnelians are sometimes of a yellowish-brown or yellow color, but red\r\nto brown are the principal colors.\r\n\r\nThe secret of coloring agates was discovered in the early part of this\r\ncentury, and about the same time agates became scarce in Oberstein,\r\nwhile large finds were made in Brazil and Uruguay, especially of agates\r\nwith red layers. This variety comes chiefly from Brazil.\r\n\r\nBesides Uruguay and Brazil, carnelian is found in Arabia and India. The\r\nmost beautiful specimens of intaglios are engraved on sardoine, and\r\nsome of the finest cameos extant are of sard and carnelian onyx.\r\n\r\n\r\nJASPER.\r\n\r\nJasper is an impure opaque quartz, usually containing more iron than\r\nagate, and lacking the quality of translucency. Jasper occurs in red,\r\nbrown, ochre-yellow, dark green, brownish-green, grayish-black, and\r\ngrayish-blue; sometimes containing bands or spots or quartz formations,\r\nand often found with regular zones or bands of various colors.\r\n\r\nEgyptian jasper or Egyptian pebbles are names given to varieties that\r\nare usually brown with inner bands of lighter hue, approaching cream in\r\ncolor, and sometimes having dark bands with spots or markings.\r\n\r\nEgyptian jasper is found near Grand Cairo, and other varieties are\r\nfound in the Urals, Saxony, Devonshire, Nova Scotia, Canada, and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of jasper varies from 2.31 to 2.67; it scratches\r\nglass, but yields to rock-crystal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALSE LAPIS.\r\n\r\nFalse lapis is jasper or agate artificially colored blue to imitate the\r\ntrue lapis. Lapis lazuli is softer than false lapis, being only 5 to\r\n5.5 in hardness.\r\n\r\nSappharine or siderite is a sapphire or sky-blue chalcedony occurring\r\nin Salzburg.\r\n\r\nNicolo is a variety of onyx with a black or brown base and a band or\r\nlayer of bluish-white on top. The upper layer is not flat, but convex,\r\nand is always thicker than the lower one.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMATITE.\r\n\r\nHematite was once largely used to engrave upon, many of the ancient\r\nintaglios being on this mineral. It is now cut to simulate black\r\npearls, and is also used in the cheaper jewelry, both engraved and cut\r\ncabochon.\r\n\r\nHematite has the hardness of 5.5 to 6.5, and specific gravity, 4.2\r\nto 5.3; it is opaque, and shows a red streak when scratched. It is\r\ncomposed of:\r\n\r\n    Iron           70\r\n    Oxygen         30\r\n\r\nThe colors of hematite are dark-steel gray to iron-black, and sometimes\r\nbrownish- to blood-red. The lustre is highly metallic, with slight\r\niridescence.\r\n\r\nThe island of Elba, France, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Sweden,\r\nBohemia, England, Brazil, Chili, Canada, Spain, and the United States\r\nare places where hematite is found. The Germans call this mineral\r\n“blood-stone,” and it is also known as specular iron ore and iron\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSIDIAN.\r\n\r\nObsidian, or volcanic glass, does not occupy a high position as a gem\r\nor as an ornamental stone, but its antiquity and occasional use among\r\nthe agates and semi-precious stones will justify its mention.\r\n\r\nThis mineral is a melted lava, and consists of silex, alumina,\r\nand a little potassa, soda, and oxide of iron. Obsidian is 6 to 7\r\nin hardness, has a specific gravity of 2.25 to 2.8, is sometimes\r\ntransparent but mostly translucent to opaque, and is vitreous to\r\nmetallic in lustre. It is brittle and not easily attacked by acids. It\r\nmelts before the blow-pipe and takes a high polish.\r\n\r\nObsidian comes from volcanoes, and is found in Iceland, Teneriffe,\r\nLepare islands, Peru, Mexico, Sicily, and on all volcanoes. The\r\ncolor is velvety-black to gray, brown, greenish-black, yellow, blue,\r\nbottle-green, and white, seldom red, and often with black or yellow\r\nspots or veinings.\r\n\r\nIceland agate lava, volcanic lava, and royal agate are all obsidian.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALACHITE.\r\n\r\nMalachite although sometimes used for jewelry, is now more largely\r\nemployed for mosaic work and ornamental vases, and is sufficiently\r\ncostly and rare to be classed amongst the precious stones.\r\n\r\nMalachite is 3.5 to 4 in hardness; has a specific gravity of 3.6 to 4;\r\nis translucent to opaque; the lustre is vitreous to adamantine. It is\r\nattacked by acids, and melts before the blow-pipe. It is composed of:\r\n\r\n    Carbonic acid               20.\r\n    Protoxide of copper         71.8\r\n    Water                        8.\r\n\r\nMalachite occurs in emerald or verdigris green color, sometimes in\r\nalternating stripes of different shades of green, and occasionally in\r\nleek- to blackish-green.\r\n\r\nMalachite is found in Russia, France, the Tyrol, England, Scotland,\r\nIreland, Germany, Africa, Chili, Australia, and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe finest specimens are found in the Urals—a block three and a half\r\nfeet square, being valued at 525,000 roubles.\r\n\r\n\r\nJET.\r\n\r\nThe making of jet or mourning jewelry was once a very large industry in\r\nFrance and England, and even now Whitby jet is well known in commerce.\r\n\r\nJet is a species of bituminous coal (cannel coal) which can be cut with\r\na knife. The hardness is 1 to 2.5; specific gravity, 1.35; its lustre\r\nis not very high, and color pitch-black.\r\n\r\nIt is found in England, France, Hesse, Spain, Italy, and Prussia.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBER.\r\n\r\nAmber is a fossil, and is not to be classed amongst minerals, but this\r\nmaterial has always been used as an ornament, and a few notes will not\r\nbe out of place here.\r\n\r\nThis vegetable fossil, which has been known to the world for ages, the\r\nGreeks called electron.\r\n\r\nIt is very light, having a specific gravity of 1.065 to 1.08, and is 2\r\nto 2.5 in hardness.\r\n\r\nThe principal color is yellow, in various shades, sometimes running\r\ninto white or reddish-brown and black.\r\n\r\nAmber is transparent to translucent, possesses single refraction, a\r\nresinous lustre to a high degree, becomes electric by rubbing, and\r\nburns readily before the blow-pipe.\r\n\r\nAmber when heated becomes soft and pliable.\r\n\r\nAmber is composed of:\r\n\r\n    Carbon           79.\r\n    Hydrogen         10.5\r\n    Oxygen           10.5\r\n\r\nAmber is imitated by gum copal, and even the insect enclosures which\r\noccur in real amber are copied.\r\n\r\nThese imitations can be detected by placing the specimen in water or\r\nalcohol. This is also a good test for pieces of real amber that have\r\nbeen melted or glued together.\r\n\r\nAmber is thrown up by the sea, in rivers near the sea, or on the\r\nsea-shore, and has been found in nearly all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Russian, Baltic, and Sicilian coasts have yielded the larger\r\nportion of the production, but supplies come also from Galizia, the\r\nUrals, Poland, China, and the United States.\r\n\r\nFor ornamental purposes the faceted amber beads are largely used, but\r\nof late years these have been closely imitated in glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORAL.\r\n\r\nCoral, although not a precious stone, has been largely used in jewelry,\r\nand as some of this beautiful substance is very valuable, a few words\r\nwill not come amiss.\r\n\r\nRed or precious coral is the work of a family of zoöphytes which live\r\nmostly in cavities of rock in the sea.\r\n\r\nThese polyps build their homes at a depth of two to seven hundred feet\r\nunder the surface of the sea, and although the single groups of coral\r\nare sometimes several feet long, the usual size is about twelve inches\r\nhigh, and about one inch at the thickest part of any single branch.\r\n\r\nCoral is usually red, and rarely white or black, while the pale\r\nrose-pink is the most esteemed color.\r\n\r\nCoral is mostly found at Calle, off the coast of Africa, but also on\r\nthe coasts of Tunis, Algiers, Corsica, Barbary, Majorca, and Minorca.\r\n\r\nCoral fishing-vessels leave Italy the beginning of March and return\r\nfrom the African coast in October; at one time as many as four hundred\r\nvessels were engaged in this industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF HARDNESS AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ────────────────────┬───────────┬──────────────\r\n                        │
