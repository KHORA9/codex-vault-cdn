The recent activity among\r\nbeekeepers toward specialization, which necessitates the establishing\r\nof out-apiaries, and the rapidly increasing demand for extracted\r\nhoney are among the factors bringing about this condition. Enormous\r\nquantities of honey are now used for manufacturing purposes, and this\r\ndemand is, of course, solely for extracted honey.\r\n\r\nIf the general public finally becomes convinced of the purity and\r\nwholesomeness of extracted honey, this will become a staple article\r\nof food. Comb honey to command the higher price--proportionate to\r\nthe greater cost of production--must justify the extra cost to the\r\nconsumer by its finer appearance. The consumer of extracted honey\r\nis not concerned as to the straightness or finish of the combs in\r\nwhich it was originally stored, but by virtue of its appearance there\r\nwill probably always be a good demand for the finest grade of comb\r\nhoney where appearance is the chief consideration. Present tendencies\r\ntherefore emphasize the desirability of producing comb honey of the\r\nmost attractive appearance possible.\r\n\r\nWell-filled sections of comb honey with delicate white comb and perfect\r\ncappings are obtainable only during a rapid honey flow of sufficient\r\nduration to insure their completion. The production of comb honey, the\r\nappearance of which is sufficient to justify its extra cost, requires\r\na combination of conditions that are peculiar to rather limited areas,\r\noutside of which the beekeeper will find it decidedly advantageous to\r\nproduce extracted honey.\r\n\r\nComb-honey production should not be attempted in localities where the\r\nhoney flow is very slow or intermittent, where the character of the\r\nhoney is such that it granulates quickly in the comb while it is on the\r\nmarket, where the honey is dark or \"off color,\" or where honeys from\r\nvarious sources are mixed if these different sources produce honey of\r\ndifferent colors and flavors. Local market conditions may of course in\r\nsome instances be such as to make it seem advisable to produce comb\r\nhoney in limited quantities in a locality that is not well suited to\r\ncomb-honey production, but the beekeeper who produces comb honey for\r\nthe general market should first be sure that his is a comb-honey\r\nlocality. Even in the best localities during an occasional season\r\nconditions are such that it is not possible to produce comb-honey of\r\nfine appearance. Some comb-honey specialists find it profitable to\r\nprovide an equipment for extracted honey for such an emergency. In some\r\ncases comb honey is produced only during the height of the season, when\r\nconditions are most favorable, extracting supers being used both at the\r\nbeginning and close of the honey flow.\r\n\r\nWhile the professional beekeeper is thus curtailing the production of\r\nindifferent grades of comb honey, bee diseases are rapidly eliminating\r\nthe careless producers. From the present indications, therefore, it\r\nwould seem certain that there must be a gradual elimination from the\r\nmarkets of all inferior and indifferent comb honey--grades that must\r\ncompete directly with extracted honey. This should mark a new era in\r\nthe production of the beat grades of comb honey in the localities that\r\nare peculiarly adapted to comb-honey production. The beekeeper who is\r\nthus favorably located will do well to consider the possibilities of\r\nfuture market conditions for a fancy grade of comb honey.\r\n\r\nTho following discussion is necessarily but a brief outline of modern\r\napparatus and methods and of course can not in any sense take the\r\nplace of the broad experience necessary in profitable comb-honey\r\nproduction. It is assumed that the reader is more or less familiar with\r\nthe more general phases of beekeeping. (See Farmers' Bulletin No. 447.\r\nThis bulletin also contains a complete list of publications of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture on beekeeping.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=APPARATUS FOR COMB-HONEY PRODUCTION.=\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shop and Honey House.=\r\n\r\nA building containing storage space for apparatus, a well-lighted\r\nand ventilated workshop as well as a honey room, is a necessity in\r\ncomb-honey production. The arrangement and location of the shop and\r\nhoney house will depend upon local conditions and circumstances. Tho\r\nusual mistake is in constructing those too small. In the North the\r\nshop and honey house is usually built over the wintering repository or\r\ncollar. Since rats or mice would do great damage to the contents of\r\nsuch a storehouse, the construction should be such as to exclude them.\r\nIf a concrete foundation is used and the sills are embedded in a layer\r\nof \"green\" mortar, no trouble of this kind should be experienced. If a\r\nseries of out-apiaries are operated for comb honey, the supers, extra\r\nhives, etc, are usually kept in one building located near the home of\r\nthe beekeeper. This serves as a central station and storehouse, the\r\nsupplies being hauled to and from the apiaries as needed. This building\r\nmay be supplemented by a very small building at each apiary, though in\r\ncomb-honey production this is not really necessary.\r\n\r\nThe honey room should be so located that it will receive the heat from\r\nthe sun, preferably an upstairs room immediately under the roof. When\r\nso located a small hand elevator should be installed for taking the\r\nhoney up and down. The room should be papered or ceiled inside to keep\r\nout insects and to permit fumigation if necessary and should contain\r\nfacilities for artificially heating in case continued damp or freezing\r\nweather should occur before the honey is marketed. The honey room\r\nshould be provided with ample floor support for the great weight that\r\nmay be placed upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hives.=\r\n\r\nA beehive must serve the dual purpose of being a home for a colony\r\nof bees and at the same time a tool for the beekeeper. Its main\r\nrequirements are along the line of its adaptation to the various\r\nmanipulations of the apiary in so far as these do not materially\r\ninterfere with the protection and comfort it affords the colony of\r\nbees. Since rapid manipulation is greatly facilitated by simple and\r\nuniform apparatus, one of the fundamental requirements of the equipment\r\nin hives is that they be of the same style and size, with all parts\r\nexactly alike and interchangeable throughout the apiary. While the\r\nhives and equipment should be as simple and inexpensive as possible,\r\nconsistent with their various functions, a cheap and poorly constructed\r\nbeehive is, all things considered, an expensive piece of apparatus.\r\n\r\nIn this country the Langstroth (or L) frame (9-1/8 by 17-5/8 inches)\r\n(fig. 1) is the standard frame and throughout this paper frames of\r\nbrood will be discussed in terms of this size of frame. The advantages\r\nof standard frames and hives are so great that the beekeeper can not\r\nafford to ignore them for the sake of some slight advantage of another\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a wide difference of opinion as to the number of\r\nframes that should be used in a single hive body. The wide variation\r\nin the building up of colonies previous to the honey flow in different\r\nlocalities and seasons, the race of bees, and the skill of the\r\nbeekeeper are all factors entering into this problem, which make it\r\nimprobable that beekeepers will ever fully agree on this point. The\r\nraces that build up more rapidly in the spring are, of course, other\r\nthings being equal, able to use to advantage a larger brood chamber\r\nthan the races that are more conservative in brood rearing. It is also\r\nnoticeable that within certain limits as the beekeeper's skill in\r\nbuilding up his colonies for the flow increases, so the size of the\r\nbrood chamber best adapted to his purpose increases. In other words,\r\nwhile the careful and skillful beekeeper may succeed in having large\r\nbrood chambers well filled with brood at the beginning of the honey\r\nflow, the less skillful beekeeper under similar conditions may be doing\r\nwell to approximate this condition with a much smaller brood chamber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--A 10-frame hive with comb-honey super\r\nand perforated zinc queen excluder. (From Phillips.)]\r\n\r\nFor comb-honey production the brood chamber should be of such a size\r\nthat by proper management it may be well filled with brood at the\r\nbeginning of the honey flow, so that the brood and surplus apartments\r\nmaybe definitely separated. A brood chamber may be considered too large\r\nif by proper management it is not on an average fairly well filled with\r\nbrood at the beginning of the honey flow, and too small if it provides\r\nan average of less room than the colony is able to occupy with brood\r\nprevious to the honey flow. Unless the beekeeper practices feeding, a\r\nbrood chamber that does not contain sufficient room for both winter\r\nstores and brood rearing during late summer and autumn may also be\r\nconsidered too small. It may be well to note that by this standard\r\nif the brood chamber seems to be too large the fault may lie in the\r\nmanagement during the previous autumn, winter, or spring. Of course the\r\nbrood chamber that is barely large enough for one colony will be too\r\nlarge for another in the same apiary or the character of the season may\r\nbe such that all brood chambers may be too large for best results one\r\nseason and too small the next, so an average must be sought. While by\r\nmanipulation good results may be secured by the use of any of the sizes\r\nin common use, any great departure in either direction from the size\r\nbest suited to conditions of a given locality necessitates an excessive\r\nincrease in labor to give best results. There is at the present\r\ntime a strong tendency toward the use of the 10-frame hive body as\r\na medium-sized brood chamber which may be used as a unit of a larger\r\nelastic brood chamber when necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Perforated zinc queen excluder. (From\r\nPhillips.)]\r\n\r\nThe comb-honey producer is more exacting as to certain details of\r\nconstruction of hives than is the producer of extracted honey since\r\nit is more necessary for him to handle individual brood frames during\r\nthe honey flow. The spaces[1] above and between the top bars of the\r\nbrood frames must be accurate or they will be bridged with burr and\r\nbrace combs and these filled with honey. Burr and brace combs make the\r\nremoval and readjustment of the super and the manipulation of frames a\r\nslow and disagreeable task, to say nothing of the waste of material,\r\nwhich should have been placed in the sections in the beginning. The\r\nuse of the slatted honey board (fig. 2), while preventing brace combs\r\nbetween itself and the super, does not prevent the building of burr and\r\nbrace combs between and above the top bars of the frames. This trouble\r\nis largely eliminated by proper spacing. Most hive manufacturers are at\r\npresent making the top bars of the brood frames of such a width that\r\nthe spaces between them is from one-fourth to five-sixteenths inch with\r\nthe same spacing above them. The difficulty, however, is in maintaining\r\nthis spacing with any great degree of accuracy. Self-spacing frames[2]\r\nare a partial solution of this difficulty. In some localities, however,\r\nthe ordinary self-spacing frames are so badly propolized as to render\r\ntheir removal from the brood chamber difficult as well as materially\r\nto interfere with the proper spacing. The advantages of such frames\r\nare then nullified, while their disadvantages are retained or even\r\nintensified. In such localities metal spacers having but small surfaces\r\nof contact are sometimes used. Some beekeepers prefer omitting the\r\nspacers entirely. However, some of the difficulties arising from the\r\nuse of self-spacing frames are the result of carelessness on the part\r\nof the operator in not crowding the frames together properly when\r\nclosing the hive after having handled the frames.\r\n\r\n[1] A bee space, or that space to which bees are least inclined to\r\nput comb or propolis, is perhaps a scant one-fourth inch. In hive\r\nconstruction one-fourth or five-sixteenths inch is usually used.\r\n\r\n[2] These are so constructed that the end bars are one-fourth or\r\nfive-sixteenths inch wider than the top bars throughout a portion of\r\ntheir length or furnished with projections of metal fitted to the edges\r\nof the frame. In either case the adjustment is such that when the\r\nframes are crowded together in the hive the spaces between the top bars\r\nwill be correct.\r\n\r\n=SECTIONAL HIVES.=\r\n\r\nThe sectional hive in which the brood chamber is composed of two or\r\nmore shallow hive bodies, making it horizontally divisible, offers\r\nsome advantages, especially to the comb-honey specialist. Most of the\r\nordinary manipulations can be performed readily with such hives without\r\nremoving the frames. One of their greatest advantages in comb-honey\r\nproduction is the rapidity with which the apiarist can examine the\r\ncolonies for queen cells if natural swarming is to be controlled by\r\nmanipulation. They are also very elastic, the units or sections usually\r\nbeing of 5-L frame capacity, permitting a brood chamber capacity of 5\r\nor any multiple of 5-L frames. Among the disadvantages of these hives\r\nare the extra cost owing to the greater number of parts necessary in\r\ntheir construction and the difficulty in maintaining proper spacing\r\nwithout the use of top bars on the frames heavier than would seem\r\nadvisable in the middle of the brood nest.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sections and Supers.=\r\n\r\nThere is a wide variation in the style of sections and the supers\r\ndesigned to contain them. This, whole to some extent brought about\r\nby different local conditions, is largely due merely to the notions\r\nof individual beekeepers. Comb-honey apparatus could probably be\r\nstandardized without sacrificing any really vital features.\r\n\r\n=BEEWAY _v._ PLAIN SECTIONS.=\r\n\r\nThere are two general styles of sections in common use differing in the\r\nmethod of spacing--the beeway section in which the spacer is a part\r\nof the section itself (fig. 5), and the plain in which the spacer is a\r\npermanent part of the separator (fig. 4). Each style has its advocates\r\nand each offers some advantages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Beeway and plain sections, unfolded.\r\n(Original.) ]\r\n\r\nSome of the advantages of the plain (fig. 3) over the beeway sections\r\nare: (1) They are simpler in construction, therefore costing less.\r\n(2) The edges being plain with no insets, the plain sections are more\r\neasily cleaned of propolis when being prepared for market and are\r\nespecially adapted to cleaning by machinery. (3) By leaving the spacers\r\nin the super, sections of the same honey content occupy less space in\r\nthe shipping case, thus reducing the cost of packages. (4) The plain\r\nsection is adapted to an arrangement permitting freer communication\r\nlengthwise of the row of sections, especially at the corners (p. 15).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Plain section In super, showing method\r\nof spacing. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nSome of the advantages of the beeway sections (fig. 3) are: (1) The\r\nhoney is somewhat less liable to injury by handling. (2) Being wider at\r\nthe corners where folded, they are stronger. (3) Some markets, being\r\naccustomed to the larger cases necessary to contain a given number of\r\nbeeway sections, object to the smaller package containing the same\r\nnumber of plain sections, simply because it is smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Beeway section In super, showing\r\nmethod of spacing. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n=DIMENSIONS OF SECTIONS.=\r\n\r\nSections of various dimensions are in use by beekeepers, but the sizes\r\nin general use are the 4-1/4 inches square and the 4 by 5 inches. Some\r\nproducers prefer the 4 by 5 sections because of the more pleasing\r\nappearance of the oblong package (fig. 6). The standard widths of the\r\n4-1/4 by 4-1/4 inches section are 1-7/8 inches in the beeway style\r\nand 1-1/2 inches in the plain section. The extra width in the beeway\r\nstyle is for the purpose of spacing and does not add to the thickness\r\nof the comb. The 4 by 5 is 1-3/8 or 1-1/2 inches wide in the plain\r\nstyle and not much used in the beeway style. The 1-3/8 width of the 4\r\nby 5 section contains practically the same amount of honey when filled\r\nas the 4-1/4 by 4-1/4 by 1-1/2 plain or the 4-1/4 by 4-1/4 by 1-7/8\r\nbeeway, assuming of course that all are used with separators and filled\r\nunder like conditions. Since there are well-defined limits as to the\r\nthickness of the combs most profitable to produce, the area of one comb\r\nsurface in a section weighing about a pound is usually from 16 to 20\r\nsquare inches, the exact size and shape being an adaptation to given\r\nspace in the super. The thinner combs, showing more comb surface, have\r\nthe appearance of being larger and a greater number can be accommodated\r\non a given hive. Honey in such combs may also be ripened sooner and\r\npossibly better than in thicker combs. They, however, require more\r\nfoundation for each pound of honey produced and a slightly greater\r\namount of wax, in proportion to the honey, to complete them. Also\r\nthe thinner the comb, the greater the difficulty with the sheets of\r\nfoundation swinging to one side on account of uneven work on the two\r\nsides or because the hives do not stand level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Square and oblong sections.\r\n(Original.)]\r\n\r\n=SUPERS.=\r\n\r\nThe main points of difference between the various types of comb-honey\r\nsupers are in (1) the method of supporting the sections, (2) the amount\r\nof protection afforded to the outside of the section and (3) the degree\r\nof free communication from section to section within the super.\r\n\r\n=The Method of Support.=\r\n\r\nSections are supported either by means of cross supports under the\r\nends of the sections or by a slat of proper width supporting each\r\nrow of sections. The T super (fig. 7), so called from the shape of\r\na cross section of the strip of tin used to support the sections is\r\nillustrative of the first, while the supporting slats, section holders\r\n(figs. 8, 9 and 10), and wide frames (fig. 11) are illustrative of the\r\nsecond type of support.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--The T super. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n=Protection.=\r\n\r\nThe T super and others of this type offer no protection against\r\npropolizing to either the top or bottom of the sections, the section\r\nholder or slat (figs. 8, 9, and 10) protects the bottom, while in\r\nthe wide frame (fig. 11) the entire outer surface of the sections is\r\nprotected except at the edges. The greater the protection afforded\r\nthe section, the more complicated and expensive the super, and the\r\nmore complicated supers require more labor in cleaning of propolis and\r\nfilling with sections. On the other hand, sections of honey produced in\r\nproperly constructed wide-frame supers are much more easily cleaned of\r\npropolis, and ordinarily present a neater appearance when packed for\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Super with section holder for beeway\r\nsections. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n=Free Communication Within the Super.=\r\n\r\nThe use of closed-top sections (1-beeway) and solid separators, making\r\neach section a separate compartment with openings for the bees at the\r\nbottom only, illustrates one extreme; while the sections with openings\r\non all four sides (4-beeway) used without separators illustrate the\r\nother extreme as to free communication; and between these extremes are\r\nvarious intermediate types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Super with section holder for square\r\nplain sections. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Super with section holder for oblong\r\nplain sections. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable so to adjust the sections that when filled\r\nwith honey a row of them would, so far as the bees are concerned,\r\nbe equivalent to a single comb, that the bees might have the same\r\nfree access to the outside row of cells from all sides as they do\r\nthe other cells and might pass up or down from any section and the\r\nfull length of the row, as well as around the ends. While, under the\r\nsame conditions, such free access to the outside row of cells from\r\nall sides would result in the sections being slightly better filled\r\nthan with the ordinary adjustments, such an arrangement presents some\r\nmechanical difficulties and would add considerable to the first cost\r\nof the supers. If separators were not necessary, such an adjustment of\r\nsections could be readily accomplished. In Europe a type of separator\r\nhaving transverse openings corresponding to the upright edges of the\r\nsections is used to give free communication lengthwise of the row of\r\nsections. In this country some such separators are used as well as a\r\nseparator made of wire cloth so spaced between the rows of sections as\r\nto give free communication along the rows, as well as from one row to\r\nanother. These, however, are not widely used in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Combination super with wide frames\r\nfor oblong plain sections. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nThe plain section, when used in connection with the \"fence\" separator\r\n(fig. 4), having the upright posts considerably shorter than the height\r\nof the section, offers a fair compromise as to free communication\r\nwithin the super. Most of the comb honey produced in this country,\r\nhowever, is produced in sections which offer no communication from\r\nsection to section lengthwise of the super, being produced in the\r\nregular 2-beeway section, having openings at the top and bottom only\r\n(figs. 7 and 8).\r\n\r\n=THE USE OF SEPARATORS.=\r\n\r\nSeparators are made of strips of tin or wood and are used between the\r\nrows of sections to compel the tees to build the combs straight and\r\nall within the section. The thicker the combs the greater becomes the\r\nnecessity for separators. While an expert can produce very uniform\r\ncomb honey without separators during a heavy honey flow by using very\r\nnarrow sections, it is usually not advisable to do so on account of\r\nthe resulting large percentage of imperfect combs, especially during\r\npoor and indifferent seasons and at the close of any season. The use of\r\nseparators results in a much more uniform product.\r\n\r\n=SHALLOW EXTRACTING SUPERS.=\r\n\r\nSome comb-honey producers add to their equipment one shallow extracting\r\nsuper for each colony. These are a great convenience in a comb-honey\r\napiary and may be used for the following purposes: (1) To keep the\r\nbrood chamber free of honey before the beginning of the main honey\r\nflow; (2) to use at the beginning of the honey flow to induce the bees\r\nto begin work promptly in the supers; (3) to use at the close of the\r\nhoney flow instead of the last comb-honey super; (4) to use during any\r\nflow of inferior honey or honeydew; (5) to use during very poor seasons\r\nwhen first-class comb honey can not be produced.\r\n\r\n=COMBINATION SUPERS.=\r\n\r\nOther comb-honey producers provide each comb-honey super with two\r\nshallow extracting combs. These are placed one on each side of the\r\nsuper with the sections between them (fig. 11). The purpose of this\r\narrangement is to induce the bees to begin work in the super promptly\r\nwithout the use of \"bait sections\" (sections containing comb previously\r\ndrawn) or an extracting super and also to do away with the usual poorly\r\nfinished sections in the corners and outside rows. One great advantage\r\nof this system over the use of an extracting super to start early super\r\nwork is that the combs are not removed. When shallow extracting supers\r\nare used for this purpose, they are removed as soon as the bees have\r\nstarted well in them and a comb-honey super substituted. This brings\r\nback much the same conditions existing before giving the extracting\r\nsuper, and while some colonies will begin work in the sections promptly\r\nwhen the change is made, many colonies hesitate about beginning the\r\nnew work almost as though the extracting super had not been used. Such\r\ncolonies are thus thrown out of \"condition\", (p. 19) and may begin\r\npreparations to swarm. The use of these combs in supers that are added\r\nsubsequently allows the apiarist to place the empty super over the one\r\nalready on the hive until the bees begin work therein without seriously\r\ncrowding the super room, because each super thus added contains room in\r\nthe form of empty comb into which the new nectar may be stored at once\r\n(see p. 42).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Apparatus.=\r\n\r\nAmong the other apparatus needed in commercial comb-honey production\r\nare a honey extractor, wax press, bee-escapes, and escape boards (fig.\r\n12), queen-excluding honey boards (fig. 2), feeders, tools, etc. It is\r\nnot necessary to provide queen-excluding honey boards for each colony\r\nunless some special system is followed, yet a few excluders are very\r\ndesirable for various special manipulations. Good feeders may be had by\r\nusing tin pans in connection with an empty super. A handful of grass\r\nshould be placed on the sirup to prevent the bees from drowning. In\r\naddition to these appliances in the northern States, if the hives are\r\nsingle walled, some means of protection is necessary if the colonies\r\nare wintered out of doors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Bee-escape board for removing bees\r\nfrom supers. (From Phillips.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Preparing Supers.=\r\n\r\n=FOLDING SECTIONS.=\r\n\r\nSection presses and foundation fasteners are sometimes combined in\r\none machine by which the section is pressed together square and the\r\nfoundation is fastened by a single operation. Usually, however,\r\nthey are separate machines requiring that each section be handled\r\ntwice before it is ready to be placed into the super. Ordinarily the\r\none-piece sections must be dampened before folding, as otherwise\r\nthe breakage is considerable and the sections are greatly weakened\r\nby folding. A crate of sections as it comes from the factory may be\r\ndampened by removing one side so as to expose the V-shaped grooves,\r\nthen directing a small stream of hot water into these grooves. Care\r\nshould be taken that only the thin portion where the section is folded\r\nbe dampened. Another very satisfactory method of dampening sections is\r\nto wrap the crates containing them in a wet blanket the day before they\r\nare to be folded.\r\n\r\n=FASTENING FOUNDATION IN SECTIONS.=\r\n\r\nThe use of comb foundation in full sheets filling each section as\r\nnearly as possible is considered a necessity in the production of fancy\r\ncomb honey. This foundation should be as thin as can be used without\r\nbeing gnawed or torn down by the bees. The sheet of foundation is\r\nusually fastened centrally at the top of the section, leaving only\r\nenough space at the sides to allow it to swing freely without binding\r\nand about three-sixteenths to one-fourth inch at the bottom to allow\r\nfor stretching while being drawn out. To secure better attachment\r\nof the comb to the bottom of the section, a bottom starter about\r\nfive-eighths inch wide may be used. In this case the top starter should\r\nreach to within three-sixteenths to one-fourth inch of the bottom\r\nstarter. In some localities the character of the flow is such that\r\nbut little is gained by the use of the bottom starter, while in other\r\nlocalities it is difficult to produce honey that will stand shipment\r\nwell without it.\r\n\r\nThe various types of apparatus usually used for fastening foundation\r\nin the sections make use of a heated metal plate which, after melting\r\nthe edge of the sheet of foundation, is withdrawn, allowing the melted\r\nedge to be brought quickly in contact with the section. This fastens\r\none edge of the sheet of foundation firmly to the wood. Foundation\r\nfasteners employing this principle may be simply a hand apparatus\r\nconsisting of a metal plate of proper size provided with a handle, the\r\noperator transferring the tool from the source of heat to the edge\r\nof the foundation. Or the principle may be incorporated in a more or\r\nless complex machine which provides for the maintenance of the proper\r\ntemperature of the heated plate, its movement to melt the edge of the\r\nfoundation and a proper support for the section and foundation during\r\nthe process. For the purpose of securing better filled sections of\r\nhoney various methods of attaching the sheet of foundation to the\r\nsides as well as the top of the section have been devised, but are not\r\nextensively used by producers. Among these methods are fitting the\r\nsheet of foundation in place, then directing a fine stream of melted\r\nwax along its edges, or the use of split sections in which a sheet of\r\nfoundation is continuous through a row of sections, extending through\r\ntheir sides and top.\r\n\r\nSome super construction is such that the sections may be placed\r\ndirectly into the super by the operator who puts in the foundation.\r\nThis work is usually done during the winter months when the bees\r\nrequire no special attention. Enough supers should be provided to take\r\ncare of the largest possible crop, even though it is not often that\r\nall are used the same season. The beekeeper who is operating several\r\napiaries can not afford to take time to prepare supers for the bees\r\nduring a good honey flow. Supers of sections thus prepared in advance\r\nshould be kept clean by storing them in piles and keeping the piles\r\ncovered from dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=MANIPULATION OF THE BEES.=\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that there are four essential factors entering\r\ninto the securing of a crop of honey: (1) A sufficient amount of bloom\r\nof healthy and well-nourished nectar-secreting plants growing in sou\r\nto which they are adapted and within range of the apiary. (2) Weather\r\nconditions favorable to nectar secretion and bee flight. (3) A large\r\nnumber of workers in excess of those needed for the routine work of\r\nthe colony. (4) Conditions of the colony making the storing instinct\r\ndominant. If any one of these factors is absent, the effect of the\r\nother three is immediately nullified, and the amount of honey secured\r\nwill vary as these factors are present at the same time in greater or\r\nless degree or as the time during which they are all present is longer\r\nor shorter. It is therefore possible to have each of these factors\r\npresent at some time during the season without securing a crop of honey\r\nand the period of time during which they are all present at the same\r\ntime is usually quite short.\r\n\r\nGrouping the first and second factors we have a combination usually\r\nspoken of as the locality and season. These factors are largely beyond\r\nthe control of the beekeeper except as he may choose a location in\r\nwhich both are usually present at some time or times during the season,\r\nmay take advantage of the plants of several locations by practising\r\nmigratory beekeeping, or may improve a given locality by directly or\r\nindirectly increasing the amount of nectar-secreting plants, such as\r\nbuckwheat, alsike clover, sweet clover, or alfalfa.\r\n\r\nGrouping the third and fourth factors we have conditions capable of\r\nbeing brought about by manipulation and for which the beekeeper is\r\nmore directly responsible. The beekeeper's skill therefore lies in\r\nsupplying and maintaining these factors throughout the short period\r\nduring which the bees may store more than they consume. He should know\r\nwhich plants may be expected to furnish the nectar for his crop of\r\nhoney, that his various manipulations may be properly timed. It should\r\nbe noted that the shorter the duration of the honey flow, the greater\r\nbecomes the necessity of having the colonies in proper condition at its\r\nbeginning and keeping them so until its close. However lavish nature\r\nmay be with the secretion of nectar and fine weather, it is of little\r\navail if the beekeeper fails to secure a large force of workers to\r\ngather and store his crop or, even having provided workers, if he fails\r\nto keep his forces together and contented, bending all their energy\r\nin the one direction of gathering and storing honey. It is a common\r\noccurrence among inexperienced beekeepers to have the colonies become\r\nstrong enough to work in the supers only after the flowers have ceased\r\nblooming or to see strong colonies during a good honey flow doing\r\nnothing in the supers simply because conditions are not such as to make\r\nthe storing instinct dominant.\r\n\r\nSo far as the skill of the beekeeper is concerned in the production of\r\nthe crop of honey in a given location, every manipulation of the season\r\nshould be directed (1) toward securing the greatest possible number of\r\nvigorous workers at the proper time, and (2) keeping the entire working\r\nforce of each colony together and contentedly at work throughout the\r\ngiven honey flow.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Securing Workers for the Honey Flow.=\r\n\r\nOf course, the shorter the period for brood rearing previous to the\r\nhoney flow, the more serious the problem of getting the colonies strong\r\nenough. Adverse weather conditions greatly retard brood rearing and\r\nthus have the effect of shortening this period. On the other hand, in\r\nsome localities the main honey flow comes so late in the season that\r\nthe colonies may even be divided and both divisions built up.\r\n\r\nIn most comb-honey localities the season is short and there is usually\r\nduring the season only one honey flow that furnishes any considerable\r\nsurplus suitable for comb honey, with perhaps other honey flows either\r\nvery meager or furnishing honey unsuitable in color. The early minor\r\nflows are in such localities utilized in brood rearing in preparation\r\nfor the main flow, and those occurring after the main flow may be\r\nutilized for winter stores, or if sufficient in quantity some surplus\r\nmay be secured. In localities where the season is made up of a series\r\nof honey flows of almost equal importance and with sometimes a long\r\ninterval between, the problem of securing workers for the harvest is\r\nrendered more complex, since the process must be repeated for each crop\r\nor the colonies kept very strong throughout the season. As a rule such\r\nlocalities are not the best for comb-honey production.\r\n\r\nThe workers that gather and store the crop of honey are those that\r\nemerge during the few weeks preceding and during the first part of the\r\nhoney flow. Unless it is of unusual duration, the eggs that produce\r\nthese workers are all laid before the honey flow begins, since those\r\nwhich develop from eggs laid later are not ready for work until after\r\nthe close of the flow. On the other hand, the workers that emerge six\r\nweeks or more before the honey flow will have died of old age or be too\r\nold to be of much value during the flow. Their services, however, are\r\nof great value provided they expend their energy to the best possible\r\nadvantage in rearing brood. If brood rearing ceases or is greatly\r\nrestricted during this period, a colony that has been strong earlier in\r\nthe season is rendered almost worthless as gatherers, since it begins\r\nthe harvest with old and worn-out workers. This is exactly what often\r\nhappens unless the beekeeper is alert and provides conditions such\r\nthat brood rearing is not restricted during this period. In the clover\r\nbelt, for example, it frequently happens that there is a scarcity of\r\nnectar during the period when the workers for the harvest should be\r\nreared and, unless the colonies are abundantly supplied with stores,\r\nbrood rearing is greatly restricted. This may to some extent justify\r\nthe saying among beekeepers that if the early flowers yield well the\r\nseason will be good. The progressive beekeeper, however, provides\r\nconditions favorable to brood rearing even though the early flowers\r\nfail to yield nectar. It is therefore highly important (1) that each\r\ncolony be in a normal condition at a period six or eight weeks previous\r\nto the honey flow, and (2) that brood rearing be at its maximum for the\r\nentire period of six or eight weeks during which the brood is reared to\r\nproduce workers available for the honey flow.\r\n\r\n=BUILDING UP THE COLONY IN THE EARLY SPRING.=\r\n\r\nThe condition of the colonies in the early spring depends upon many\r\nfactors not all of which are under the control of the beekeeper. In\r\nthe white-clover belt for instance, where the honey flow comes early,\r\na large percentage of strong colonies in early spring means of course\r\nthat they have wintered well, which in turn is largely dependent\r\nupon proper conditions the previous late summer and autumn. The\r\nmanipulations having for their purpose the rapid upbuilding of the\r\ncolony may therefore have their beginning at or even before the close\r\nof the honey flow of the previous year, including late summer and fall\r\nmanagement and wintering. Good queens, preferably young, with enough\r\nroom for breeding purposes and a supply of stores during the previous\r\nlate summer and autumn are among the factors favoring good wintering.\r\nDuring the winter the central idea is the conservation of the energy\r\nof the bees, the complex details of which can not be presented in this\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the colonies build up in early spring depends\r\nupon a number of conditions, some of which are: (1) The number and\r\nvitality of the workers; (2) the age and fecundity of the queen;\r\n(3) the supply and location of stores within the hive; (4) weather\r\nconditions; (5) the supply of new pollen, nectar, and water; (6) the\r\nconservation of heat within the brood nest; (7) the race of bees; (8)\r\nthe character of the brood combs, etc. Most of these conditions are to\r\na great extent within the control of the beekeeper. By supplying each\r\ncolony with a young queen the previous autumn, or at least supplanting\r\nall undesirable ones, a greater number of young and vigorous workers\r\nare reared late in the season, which usually means greater vitality\r\nand numbers the next spring. Young queens reared the previous summer\r\nor autumn should be in prime condition the next spring. If to this\r\ncombination is added an abundance of stores within the hives, brood\r\nrearing should progress rapidly, even in spite of adverse weather\r\nconditions. It is now the general practice among beekeepers to supply\r\nenough stores the previous autumn not only for winter stores but for\r\nbrood-rearing purposes the next spring. Since the amount consumed\r\nduring the winter varies considerably with different colonies, an\r\nearly examination to determine the amount of stores may be necessary.\r\nUnder some conditions it may be found profitable to stimulate brood\r\nrearing early in the spring by slowly feeding diluted sugar sirup to\r\neach colony, by spreading brood, or by doing both, but any very early\r\nstimulation of this kind should be used with caution. Among extensive\r\nbeekeepers the tendency is decidedly toward letting the bees alone\r\nuntil the weather is more settled, simply making sure that they have\r\nsufficient stores. The apiary should, if possible, be so located that\r\nthe bees may have access to water without the necessity of exposure of\r\na long flight during bad weather. In localities that do not furnish\r\nnatural pollen, it may be necessary to feed an artificial substitute,\r\nsuch as rye meal. A good hive that will conserve the heat of the\r\ncluster is also a great help in early brood rearing. Some beekeepers\r\nwho winter their colonies in the cellar in single-walled hives find\r\nit profitable to give them some additional protection after they have\r\nbeen removed from the cellar. In the northern States double-walled\r\nhives are especially advantageous during the spring. A protected\r\nlocation for the apiary in some instances makes a great difference in\r\nearly brood rearing. Some races breed up more rapidly in the spring\r\nthan others. The Italians are somewhat conservative in this respect,\r\nbut have so many excellent traits that they are generally used in this\r\ncountry. In localities having intermittent honey flows Italian bees may\r\nnot give the best results because of their tendency to restrict brood\r\nrearing during the honey flow by crowding the queen and to curtail the\r\nproduction of brood during a scarcity of nectar. Drone comb within the\r\nbrood nest in early spring is a decided barrier to rapid brood rearing.\r\nMany brood combs considered by the average beekeeper to be perfect\r\ncontain, especially in the upper portion, a large percentage of cells\r\nwhich can not be used for rearing worker brood because of imperfections\r\nin shape and size due to the stretching of this portion of the combs\r\nduring hot weather. This suggests the advisability of the use of a\r\nheavier grade of foundation or some method of using vertical wires or\r\nwooden splints in the upper half of the sheet of foundation.\r\n\r\n=THE PRODUCTION OF GATHERING BEES.=\r\n\r\nDuring the six or eight weeks just preceding the honey flow every\r\ncolony should be encouraged to rear the greatest possible amount\r\nof brood. Brood rearing during this period is often restricted by\r\ninsufficient stores or by insufficient room. It is therefore of great\r\nimportance that both stores and available brood-rearing space be\r\nsupplied in abundance. If stimulative feeding or spreading the brood is\r\npracticed, this is the time it should be done.\r\n\r\n=Providing Sufficient Stores.=\r\n\r\nIf feeding is not practiced during this critical period, the beekeeper\r\nshould see that each colony is at all times supplied with a reserve\r\nof stores, for surprisingly large quantities are consumed when brood\r\nrearing is going on rapidly. If any colonies should run short, brood\r\nrearing will be carried on sparingly and the colony so severely\r\ncrippled that it may not recover its strength until after the honey\r\nflow is over.\r\n\r\nWhether stimulative feeding or supplying each colony with an abundance\r\nof reserve stores is the more profitable depends upon circumstances and\r\nmust be decided by each beekeeper for his own conditions. Stimulative\r\nfeeding, if properly done, will undoubtedly result in the rearing of\r\nmore bees for the harvest. When the beekeeper is operating several\r\napiaries and must travel some distance to reach them the labor involved\r\nis considerable, and the question to be decided is whether this labor\r\nwould yield greater returns if expended in stimulative feeding or in\r\noperating a larger number of colonies. If the brood chamber is large\r\nand well provisioned or if the flowers furnish some nectar in early\r\nspring the colonies may have sufficient stores for this period of heavy\r\nbrood rearing. Some beekeepers save combs of honey of the previous year\r\nto supply food for this period. This is one of the most convenient and\r\nsatisfactory methods of feeding.\r\n\r\n=Providing Available Brood-Rearing Space.=\r\n\r\nThere should be no restriction whatever in the room for brood rearing\r\nup to the time of putting on the supers, just previous to the honey\r\nflow, for a crowded brood nest at this time tends to diminish the\r\nnumber of workers available for the honey flow as well as to encourage\r\nswarming.\r\n\r\nIf the space for brood rearing should be restricted by too much early\r\nhoney in the brood chamber some of the heaviest combs should be removed\r\nand empty ones given instead, or an extra brood chamber containing\r\nempty combs may be given. In localities where considerable early honey\r\nis gathered the brood chamber may be kept almost free of honey by\r\nplacing an extracting super over each colony at the beginning of such a\r\nflow. This super should not be removed until the comb-honey supers are\r\ngiven, for the honey may be needed later in brood rearing.\r\n\r\nShould the brood nest be restricted by a small brood chamber the\r\ncolonies may be equalized by removing some frames of brood from the\r\nstronger colonies, exchanging them for empty combs taken from weaker\r\ncolonies, or another brood chamber filled with empty combs may be\r\ngiven, thus building the colonies up individually. The former method\r\nhas the following advantages: (1) After being built up to approximately\r\nthe same strength, most of the colonies will be ready for a given\r\nmanipulation at the same time, thus facilitating the work. (2) It\r\nrequires a smaller stock of extra brood chambers and combs, at least\r\nprevious to the honey flow. (3) The brood is in a more compact form,\r\nwhich is a very desirable condition in comb-honey production. (4) When\r\nproperly done, the total number of young bees reared in a given time\r\nis probably considerably greater, owing to the fact that none of the\r\ncolonies is strong beyond the capacity of the queen, the workers of the\r\nentire apiary being so distributed that all the queens are utilized\r\nto the best possible advantage. (5) When the honey flow begins the\r\ncolonies are ready for the supers without additional manipulation,\r\nsuch as removing extra brood chambers, sorting combs of brood, etc.\r\nIn equalizing colonies combs of hatching brood with the adhering\r\nworkers, _without the queen_, are usually drawn from the strongest\r\ncolonies and given to colonies less strong, but _never to very weak\r\ncolonies_. The weakest colonies are left until the last, then built\r\nup quickly, provided there is time enough to have all the hives well\r\nfilled with brood. If this is not possible the very weak colonies can\r\nmore profitably be used for purposes other than comb-honey production.\r\nAnother plan of equalizing is that of shaking bees from combs taken\r\nfrom strong colonies at the entrance of colonies less strong. The older\r\nbees at once take wing and return to their hives, while the younger\r\nbees enter the weaker colony. The operator must, of course, be sure\r\nthat the queen is not on the comb thus shaken.\r\n\r\nSome of the advantages of building up the colonies as individuals\r\nare: (1) The labor required is considerably less, fewer visits being\r\nrequired, so that this method is particularly adapted to out-apiary\r\nconditions. (2) It is possible to determine with much greater accuracy\r\nwhich colonies show the most desirable traits for breeding purposes.\r\n(3) It can be more safely practiced if brood diseases are imminent.\r\n\r\n=SUMMARY.=\r\n\r\n(1) The workers that take part in storing a crop of honey from any\r\ngiven honey flow are usually those reared within the period of six or\r\neight weeks just preceding the honey flow. The workers reared previous\r\nto this period are too old to be of much value as gatherers while those\r\nreared after this period mature after the flow has ceased.\r\n\r\n(2) It is necessary that the beekeeper know what plants are likely to\r\nfurnish the surplus honey and their approximate period of bloom so that\r\nhe can determine the limits of the heavy brood-rearing period in order\r\nto secure the largest possible working force for the honey flow.\r\n\r\n(3) Colonies should be in a normal condition at the beginning of\r\nthis period. (_a_) If the surplus is from an early flow, this normal\r\ncondition can be obtained only by proper management the previous\r\nlate summer and autumn, together with good wintering. Good queens,\r\npreferably young, together with sufficient room for brood rearing and\r\nwinter stores, are important conditions during late summer and autumn.\r\n(_b_) Stores and protection are important factors in early brood\r\nrearing. (_c_) The character of the brood combs and the race of bees\r\neach have some influence upon brood rearing.\r\n\r\n(4) During the time that workers for the harvest should be reared brood\r\nrearing should be constantly accelerated.\r\n\r\n(5) Brood rearing is often restricted during this period (_a_) because\r\nof limited stores and (_b_) because of limited room in the brood\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Using Available Workers to Best Advantage During the Honey Flow.=\r\n\r\nBrood rearing, which is of primary importance during the preceding\r\nperiod, becomes of secondary consideration at about the beginning of\r\nthe honey flow, because this is nearing the limit beyond which time the\r\nresulting bees develop too late to take part in gathering and storing\r\nthe crop of honey. At this time, therefore, there is a radical change\r\nin purpose of the manipulations. Instead of continuing the expansion of\r\nthe brood chamber, the policy of the beekeeper should now be rather a\r\nconcentration of the workers and brood. There is perhaps a limit to the\r\nnumber of workers that can be profitably kept in a single hive and set\r\nof supers, but this limit is seldom reached, the usual mistake being in\r\nhaving too few. Each colony should have its brood chamber well filled\r\nwith brood in a compact form and be so crowded with young and vigorous\r\nworkers that they will immediately occupy the supers when the honey\r\nflow actually begins. The brood chamber of colonies occupying more\r\nthan one hive body should at this time be reduced to one, any extra\r\nbrood being used in colonies having less than one brood chamber full of\r\nbrood. After this operation, should there still be some colonies left\r\nwith the brood chamber but partly filled with brood, they should be\r\nfilled with combs of brood and adhering bees (without the queen) drawn\r\nfrom some colony or colonies too weak to work well in comb-honey supers.\r\n\r\nIt may be advisable to unite the weaker colonies in order to secure\r\nthe proper strength for the best work. This massing of the workers\r\nin strong colonies, so essential to the production of a fancy grade\r\nof comb honey, renders necessary extremely careful and skillful\r\nmanagement, since the efforts of the beekeeper may still be nullified\r\nin either of two ways: (1) The bees may divide their forces by swarming\r\ninto two or more parts, neither of which would be ready to work in the\r\nsupers until the season is much advanced or perhaps closed entirely,\r\nor (2) being balked in their desire to swarm or from lack of convenient\r\nstorage space, etc., they may do very poor work even during a good\r\nhoney flow simply because the conditions of the colony are such that\r\nthe storing instinct is not dominant. _To bring about the best results\r\nin comb honey, the entire working force of each colony must be kept\r\nundivided and the means employed in doing so must be such that the\r\nstoring instinct remains dominant throughout any given honey flow._\r\nAny increase made before or during the flow[3] is made at the expense\r\nof the surplus honey unless it be made with brood that would emerge\r\ntoo late for the young bees to be of use during the honey flow (p.\r\n31). In general, however, increase may be made at much less expense by\r\nsetting aside some of the colonies for that purpose. To keep the forces\r\ntogether and satisfied, with the storing instinct dominant during a\r\ngood flow, is the most difficult problem with which the producer of\r\ncomb honey must deal.\r\n\r\n[3] In localities where the main honey flow is so late that colonies\r\nmay be divided long enough before the flow so that both colonies may be\r\nbuilt up to proper strength in time to take advantage of it, of course\r\nincrease previous to the flow would be advisable. This condition is\r\nrare in comb-honey localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Swarming.=\r\n\r\nAll colonies do not behave alike as to swarming. (1) There are certain\r\ncolonies that go through the season with apparently no thought of\r\nswarming. Such colonies do the very best work in the supers, and their\r\nnumber can be increased by skillful management. (2) Other colonies\r\nstart queen cells preparatory to swarming, but can be persuaded to give\r\nit up by such mild measures as destroying the queen cells and perhaps\r\nremoving a few frames of brood. (3) Certain colonies are determined to\r\nswarm and, unless the flow ceases, nothing short of swarming or some\r\nradical manipulation will satisfy them. (4) A certain percentage of\r\nqueens fail during the honey flow and swarming may occur in connection\r\nwith the supersedure. Such colonies usually do very poor work in\r\ncomb-honey supers.\r\n\r\nThe beekeeper can do much (1) toward increasing the percentage in\r\nthe first group and discouraging those of the second--_preventive\r\nmeasures_, and (2) toward making the most of the colonies under the\r\nthird and fourth groups--_control measures_.\r\n\r\n=PREVENTIVE MEASURES.=\r\n\r\nSome effort has been made toward the final elimination of swarming by\r\nbreeding from colonies showing the least disposition to swarm. Although\r\nafter years of selection bees continue to swarm when conditions are\r\nfavorable, many practical beekeepers testify to having greatly reduced\r\nthe percentage of swarming colonies by years of careful selection and\r\nbreeding. It would certainly seem advisable to replace the queens of\r\nall colonies which persist in swarming with young queens reared from\r\ncolonies less inclined to swarm. The swarming problem has also been\r\nattacked from the standpoint of the hive and mechanical attachments,\r\nfinally resulting in the invention of a \"nonswarming\" hive. More\r\nattention has, however, been paid to the prevention and control\r\nof swarming by manipulation than along either of the other fines,\r\nprobably because proper manipulation gives immediate results and is\r\nnow available as a means of preventing the losses due to swarming. The\r\nsuccess in swarm control attained by the best beekeepers is a result of\r\nsome effort along all three of the above fines at the same time.\r\n\r\nAmong the manipulations that tend to discourage swarming are (1) the\r\nintroduction of young queens (preferably reared from selected stock);\r\n(2) an abundance of empty comb in the brood chamber at all times\r\nprevious to the honey flow; (3) prompt work in the supers at the\r\nbeginning of the flow induced by using \"bait sections\" or extracting\r\ncombs in the first super given, thus tiding the colony over one of the\r\ncritical periods; (4) a judicious manipulation of the supers during the\r\nhoney flow (p. 41); (5) the use of more nearly perfect worker combs\r\nin the brood chamber, since drone comb and imperfect cells (p. 22)\r\nhave the effect of contracting the brood chamber, thus bringing about\r\na crowded condition; (6) an abundance of ventilation during the honey\r\nflow, obtained by means of a large entrance or by raising the hive\r\nabove the bottom board by means of small blocks; (7) protection of the\r\nhive from direct rays of the sun during the hottest portion of the day\r\nby some such means as a double cover or shade board; (8) the removal\r\nof one or two frames of brood and the substitution therefor of empty\r\ncombs or sheets of foundation; (9) the destruction of all queen cells\r\nprovided they contain only eggs or very small larvæ.\r\n\r\nIf queen cells are well advanced, their destruction usually has little\r\nor no effect as a swarm preventive measure. While destroying queen\r\ncells in their early stages can not be relied upon as a preventive of\r\nswarming, beekeepers who practice examining the brood chambers once a\r\nweek for queen cells during the swarming season are usually surprised\r\nat the number of colonies that can be induced to give up swarming and\r\nturn their attention to storing in this way. Such a result at least\r\npartly compensates for the large amount of labor required for these\r\nweekly examinations.\r\n\r\n=CONTROL MEASURES.=\r\n\r\nAfter having taken all precautions as to preventive measures there\r\nwin still be some colonies that will attempt to swarm when producing\r\ncomb honey. During poor seasons of course the percentage may be\r\nquite low, but during good seasons the conditions are sometimes such\r\nthat a majority of the colonies may make an effort to swarm. Swarming\r\ncolonies, however, may be controlled in such a manner that practically\r\nas much surplus honey is secured as if the colony made no attempt to\r\nswarm. If but a single apiary is being operated and the beekeeper is\r\npresent during the swarming season, the bees may be permitted to swarm\r\nnaturally without loss to the beekeeper; but if several apiaries are\r\nbeing operated, it is more economical to employ some method by which\r\nswarming may be controlled by visiting each apiary at given intervals\r\nduring the swarming season, rather than to have an attendant at each.\r\n\r\n=Control of Natural Swarms.=\r\n\r\nNatural swarms may be managed (1) by allowing them to cluster\r\nnaturally, then hiving them in the ordinary manner; (2) by the clipped\r\nqueen method; (3) by the use of queen traps (fig. 13; see Farmers'\r\nBulletin No. 447, pp. 29-30); or (4) by use of the swarm catcher.[4]\r\n\r\n[4] This is simply a wire-cloth cage large enough to be set over the\r\nhive or be fitted over the entrance. If the attendant is provided with\r\na number of these catchers he can avoid the usual confusion ordinarily\r\noccurring when several swarms issue at about the same time. After being\r\ncaught in this manner the swarms may be hived at the convenience of the\r\nbeekeeper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Drone and queen trap on hive\r\nentrance. (From Phillips.)]\r\n\r\nTo keep the forces together (1) the swarm without the queen may be\r\nreturned to its hive, the queen cells destroyed a week later, and the\r\ncolony afterwards requeened (p. 36); or (2) the brood may be removed\r\nfrom the hive while the swarm is out, after which the swarm with the\r\nqueen is returned. The former method is useful under some conditions\r\n(p. 37), but the latter is the one usually preferred.\r\n\r\nWhen the swarm is hived back without the brood on its old location in\r\nthis manner, the colony does not lose any of its flying bees and is\r\nback at work with renewed energy in the same set of supers it was but a\r\nfew minutes before so eagerly deserting. Instead of removing the combs\r\nfrom the brood chamber the usual practice is the removal of the entire\r\nbrood chamber and the substitution of another whose external appearance\r\nis the same. This method of swarm management keeps the bees, queen,\r\nand supers together and is one of the most satisfactory known. It is\r\nnot, however, adapted to out-apiaries or any apiaries not having an\r\nattendant, and requires considerable time in watching for and hiving\r\nswarms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Colony before swarming; supers in\r\nplace. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n=USING THE REMOVED BROOD TO BEST ADVANTAGE.=\r\n\r\nThe disposition of the brood that is left when a swarm issues should be\r\nsuch that (1) no \"after-swarms\" (swarms resulting from the emergence of\r\na plurality of virgin queens) are permitted to issue and (2) that the\r\nemerging workers may be used to the best advantage.\r\n\r\n\"After-swarming\" may be prevented by (1) breaking up the parent colony\r\nbefore any of the young queens emerge, using the unhatched brood\r\nelsewhere, (2) by destroying all queen cells but one before any young\r\nqueens emerge, or (3) by greatly reducing the population of the parent\r\ncolony[5] just before the young queens emerge.\r\n\r\n[5] The term \"parent colony\" applies to the one in the hive from which\r\nthe swarm issues and is in common use, though the correctness of the\r\nterm is questionable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Brood placed in hive turned 90\r\ndegrees from old entrance. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nIf swarming occurs at a time when the resulting young bees can take\r\npart in gathering and storing the crop of honey, the usual practice\r\nis to allow the brood to emerge in a separate hive and later to add\r\nthese young bees to the colony from which it was taken. Under such\r\ncircumstances this reenforcement of the swarm is especially desirable,\r\nsince otherwise its forces are constantly diminishing during the 21\r\ndays (the time required for worker brood to develop) immediately\r\nfollowing the removal of all its brood. The brood, however, may be used\r\nanywhere in the apiary and should be placed where the resulting bees\r\nwill be most needed. The plans given below make use of at least a part\r\nof the emerging bees in reenforcing the swarm from which the brood was\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nWhen hiving natural swarms on the old location as suggested above,\r\nthe old brood chamber is provided with a bottom and cover and set\r\naside, usually with its entrance turned away about 90° from its former\r\nposition (figs. 14, 15). This is to prevent any field bees returning\r\nto the parent colony. A day or so later it is turned about 45° toward\r\nits former position (fig. 16) and as soon as the bees have this\r\nlocation of the entrance well marked the hive is placed parallel to the\r\nhive on the old stand (fig. 17). So far as the bees returning from the\r\nfield are concerned, these two colonies are now on the same stand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Hive with brood turned back to 45\r\ndegrees from old entrance. (Original.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Hive with brood turned parallel to\r\nold entrance. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nThe further disposition of the remnant of the brood and young bees\r\nmay be by any one of the following methods: (1) One week after the\r\nswarm issues, or just before the parent colony would cast a second or\r\n\"after-swarm,\" it may, when the bees are well at work in the fields, be\r\nremoved and given a new location. This throws the entire flying force\r\ninto the colony having the supers, where they are of greatest service,\r\nand so depletes the other colony of its flying bees just when the\r\nyoung queens are emerging that \"after-swarming\" is usually prevented.\r\n(2) Before moving it, away the parent colony may be more thoroughly\r\ndepleted of its young bees by shaking most of them from their combs,\r\nadding them of course to the colony with the supers. The comb\r\ncontaining the finest queen cells should not be shaken, since to do so\r\nwill probably injure the immature queens. Two or three frames should\r\nbe left with their adhering bees in order that the parent colony will\r\nstill contain enough workers to care for the remaining unemerged brood.\r\n(3) Instead of moving the parent colony away as in (1) above, the bees\r\nmay all be added to the swarm by shaking them from their combs, and the\r\ncombs then distributed among nuclei previously prepared. By successive\r\nadditions of frames of brood these nuclei are finally built up into\r\nfull colonies and \"after-swarming\" is prevented. (4) Instead of giving\r\nthe parent colony a new location, as in (1) above, it may be shifted\r\nto the opposite side of the swarm on the old stand (fig. 18) and by\r\nthus shifting it from one side to the other at intervals of several\r\ndays the young bees as they hatch and learn to fly will finally all be\r\nadded to the colony with the supers. Few beekeepers, however, go to\r\nthis extreme, as the season usually closes before the latest emerging\r\nyoung bees are thus transferred to the colony with the supers and these\r\nlater-emerging bees may be used for increase at little if any expense\r\nin surplus honey. (5) If increase is not desired, the bees may be added\r\nto the swarm on the old stand as before, and after 10 or 15 days the\r\ncombs of the parent colony still containing some unhatched brood may be\r\nused on which to hive another swarm. Before being used for this purpose\r\nthe bees are of course shaken from these combs and added as before to\r\nthe swarm on the old stand. (6) If the honey flow is of long duration\r\nor conditions otherwise such that the storing colony may prepare to\r\nswarm again, the brood chamber of the parent colony may be left by\r\nthe side of the swarm (fig. 18) until the young queen begins to lay,\r\nthen restored to its original position on the old stand and the supers\r\ntransferred to it. The brood chamber containing the old queen is moved\r\nto one side, its flying bees thus induced to enter the hive containing\r\nthe young queen. The two colonies may afterwards be united or the one\r\ncontaining the old queen may finally be moved to a new location for\r\nincrease. If, when using this plan, a virgin queen or a ripe queen cell\r\nis given the parent colony just after the swarm issues, this colony is\r\nready to be restored to its original position on the old stand about a\r\nweek earlier than if left to requeen itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Hive with brood placed on other side\r\nof old entrance. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nIn case the emerging bees are not to be added to the storing colony the\r\nbrood and young bees may be used in one of the following ways:\r\n\r\n(1) They may be used immediately after the swarm issues to build up\r\nsuch colonies as are not strong enough to work in the supers or to\r\nbuild up previously prepared nuclei, as in (3) above. Before being used\r\nin these ways the adhering bees are usually added to the swarm.\r\n\r\n(2) The parent colony may be placed at once on a new stand and given\r\na laying or virgin queen. To allow such a colony to requeen itself\r\nusually results in its casting an \"after-swarm,\" since it becomes\r\nquite populous again before the young queens emerge. This plan does\r\nnot make immediate use of the emerging bees but may be useful under\r\nsome conditions. (3) If the honey flow is of long duration or is\r\nfollowed closely by a second, two parent colonies, as in (2) above, may\r\nbe placed upon the same stand, one of which is given a queen but with\r\nthe queen cells destroyed in the other. After two or three weeks the\r\nbees may be shaken from the queenless colony in with the queen-right\r\none. Such colonies are in excellent condition for rapid work in the\r\nsupers.\r\n\r\n=WHAT TO USE IN THE BROOD CHAMBER WHEN HIVING SWARMS.=\r\n\r\n(1) The use of narrow strips of foundation 1 inch or less in width in\r\nthe brood chamber offers some advantages. (_a_) When the brood chamber\r\ncontains only these narrow \"starters\" and supers of partly filled\r\nsections are transferred from the parent colony to the new swarm at\r\nthe time of hiving, there being no cells below in which to store the\r\nhoney, it is taken to the supers. Under these conditions work in the\r\nbrood chamber goes on slowly, the work of the colony being largely in\r\nthe supers. (_b_) Colonies that are thus required to construct a set of\r\nnew combs in the brood chamber and that are supplied with sufficient\r\nstorage room seldom attempt to swarm again during the same season,\r\neven though the flow be of long duration. (_c_) The treatment of brood\r\ndiseases may be combined with swarm control. (See Farmers' Bulletin No.\r\n442, p. 14.) The greatest objection to their use is in the excessive\r\namount of drone comb usually built when anything less than full sheets\r\nof foundation are used, especially if the queen is old or the brood\r\nchamber large in proportion to the size of the swarm.\r\n\r\n(2) The use of full sheets of foundation in the brood frames has the\r\ndecided advantage of resulting in straight combs having the maximum\r\nnumber of cells of the worker size, but is more expensive than the\r\nnarrow strips and allows a more rapid building of comb in the brood\r\nchamber, which under some conditions is considered a disadvantage.\r\n\r\n(3) The exclusive use of either narrow strips or full sheets of\r\nfoundation in the brood chamber when hiving swarms necessitates the\r\nuse for a short time of a queen excluder (fig. 2) if the supers are\r\ntransferred from the parent colony to the swarm at the time of hiving,\r\nsince otherwise the queen would probably enter the sections and a brood\r\nnest be established there. To avoid the use of queen excluders for this\r\npurpose, one or more empty combs maybe used in each brood chamber,\r\nthe remaining frames containing full sheets of foundation. This empty\r\ncomb also serves as a storage place for pollen that may be gathered\r\nbefore the other combs of the brood chamber are constructed. Otherwise\r\nthis pollen may be stored in the sections (p. 46). It is also\r\nprobable that fewer colonies will \"swarm out\" or desert their hives\r\nif hived in a brood chamber containing one or more empty combs than\r\nif foundation only is used. A disadvantage of this plan is that the\r\ncells near the top bar of the comb may be so elongated as to interfere\r\nwith the complete drawing out of the foundation in the adjacent frame.\r\nEmpty combs can not well be used in connection with narrow strips of\r\nfoundation, since their use favors the construction of drone comb.\r\n\r\n(4) Empty combs are sometimes used with the idea of saving the bees the\r\nwork of constructing a new set of combs. Under same conditions this is\r\nfalse economy and gives poorer results than starters or foundation.\r\nWith very strong colonies, or with the brood chamber contracted to five\r\nor six frames, empty combs in the brood chamber may give good results.\r\nMedium colonies on a full set of empty combs are included to store the\r\nhoney in the brood chamber and neglect the supers.\r\n\r\n(5) Combs of honey are sometimes used on which to hive swarms. In some\r\ninstances the beekeeper uses frames of foundation or empty combs above\r\nthe brood chamber previous to and during the first few days of the\r\nhoney, flow for the purpose of discouraging swarming and afterwards\r\nuses these partly filled combs on which to hive swarms. In order to\r\nmake room for the queen, this honey is rapidly carried above, and\r\nstored in the sections.\r\n\r\n(6) Combs of sealed brood in which no eggs have been laid during\r\nthe previous 10 days or 2 weeks may be used. Such combs are usually\r\navailable toward the close of the swarming season from colonies that\r\nhave swarmed 10 days or 2 weeks before. This plan is especially\r\ndesirable when the beekeeper runs short of hives during the swarming\r\nseason. In some localities, however, the character of the flow is such\r\nthat the colonies may later again prepare to swarm when hived on either\r\nempty combs or combs of sealed brood.\r\n\r\n=EXTREME CONTRACTION OF THE BROOD CHAMBER WHEN HIVING SWARMS.=\r\n\r\nSome beekeepers contract the brood chamber, when hiving swarms, to five\r\nor six frames, the remaining space being filled by means of division\r\nboards or \"dummies.\" This reduction in the capacity of the brood\r\nchamber results in practically all the honey being stored in the supers\r\nand also restricts brood rearing at a time when the resulting bees\r\ndevelop too late to become gatherers. This is especially adaptable to\r\nlocations furnishing an early flow of white honey followed by a later\r\nflow of darker honey. The white or more marketable honey is stored in\r\nthe supers and later the brood chamber is expanded and provisioned for\r\nwinter with the less desirable honey. Some beekeepers accomplish a\r\nsomewhat similar result by hiving two swarms together in a single hive\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nWhen practicing contraction it is best to give the full amount of\r\nroom at the time of hiving the swarm and to reduce the space three or\r\nfour days later, as otherwise the bees are apt to \"swarm out\" because\r\nof their cramped quarters. Since contraction of the brood chamber is\r\nbut a temporary expedient, it should not be continued beyond the time\r\nthat its use is of advantage. If there should be a later honey flow,\r\nthe brood chamber should be expanded in time to rear the bees for it.\r\nIn any event, contraction should not continue so long as to interfere\r\nwith securing the proper conditions of the colonies for winter (p. 21).\r\nFrames of foundation, empty combs, frames of brood or honey may be used\r\nto complete the set of combs when expanding the brood chamber, and\r\nthese are usually given just before or at the close of the honey flow.\r\nContraction of the brood chamber to less than one hive body, except in\r\nhiving swarms, is not usually advisable.\r\n\r\n=Swarm Control by Manipulation.=\r\n\r\nSwarm control by manipulation enables the beekeeper to operate a series\r\nof apiaries by visiting each at certain intervals, thus eliminating\r\nthe necessity of an attendant in each apiary during the swarming\r\nseason. The fact that bees usually, by the construction of queen cells,\r\nindicate about a week in advance their intention to swarm, enables the\r\nbeekeeper to control swarming by examining each colony once a week\r\nduring the swarming period and forestalling the colonies that are\r\nmaking preparations to swarm. It is also possible to manipulate all the\r\ncolonies before any swarming occurs so that most of them go through the\r\nhoney flow without swarming, thus eliminating the weekly examinations.\r\n\r\nAny manipulation for swarm control, whether applied after the colony\r\nhas acquired the \"swarming fever\" or applied to all colonies alike\r\nprevious to the swarming season, is based upon the single principle--_a\r\ntemporary disturbance in the continuity of the daily emergence of\r\nbrood_. This disturbance should occur just previous to or during the\r\nswarming season. In natural swarming the brood and the swarm are\r\nseparated, the swarm being without hatching brood during a period of\r\nthree weeks. The brood from which the swarm came may be allowed to\r\nemerge in a separate hive and the resulting bees may then be returned\r\nto the swarm (p. 29). In this way the swarming instinct is satisfied,\r\nat least temporarily, without materially decreasing the population of\r\nthe colony. The beekeeper may anticipate swarming by removing the brood\r\nfrom the hive, allowing it to emerge in a separate hive and finally\r\nreturning these young bees to the colony in the same manner as is\r\ndone with the natural swarm. Under the same conditions the subsequent\r\nbehavior of a colony treated in this way is similar to that of a\r\nnatural swarm. In either case there has been a break in the continuity\r\nof the emergence of young bees in the hive during a period of three\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nInstead of hiving a natural swarm upon empty combs or frames of\r\nfoundation, combs of emerging brood (without queen cells) taken from\r\na colony that has been queenless during a period of 10 to 15 days may\r\nbe used (p. 33) and a similar condition may be had without swarming\r\nby removing all of the brood and substituting such combs of emerging\r\nbrood, thus at least temporarily avoiding swarming. In these cases\r\nthere is a break of 10 to 15 days in the continuity of the daily\r\nemergence of bees.\r\n\r\nA similar interruption of brood rearing may be accomplished by removing\r\nthe queen from the hive or caging her within the hive during a period\r\nof 10 days or 2 weeks, then returning her to the combs. In this case no\r\nqueen cells must of course be allowed to mature. A condition similar to\r\nthis may be obtained without removing the queen by dividing the brood\r\nchamber into two parts with queen-excluding metal, for a period of 10\r\nto 15 days. The brood from the division containing the queen is then\r\nremoved and the bees, together with the queen, shaken into the other\r\n(queenless) division, the queen cells if any being first destroyed.\r\nThe brood thus removed may later be returned to the colony in the form\r\nof young bees in the usual manner (p. 29). Even the destruction of\r\nthe sealed brood by uncapping it has been advised as a means of swarm\r\ncontrol. This gives a period of about 12 days during which few or no\r\nyoung bees emerge.\r\n\r\nThese methods are illustrative of the principle employed in the various\r\nmethods of control by manipulation, which may be classified under three\r\ngeneral headings: (1) Taking the queen from the hive. (2) Taking the\r\nbrood from the hive. (3) Separating the queen and brood within the hive.\r\n\r\nThe following methods of swarm control are given for the purpose of\r\nillustrating the various types of control by manipulation. It is not\r\nto be understood that all the methods given are equally adaptable to\r\nany locality or season, but it is hoped that, presented in this way,\r\nthe beekeeper may more readily see the principle underlying each plan\r\nas well as the basic principle underlying all the plans and thereby be\r\nbetter enabled to elaborate a system of control to meet his particular\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n=TAKING THE QUEEN FROM THE HIVE.=\r\n\r\nThe temporary removal of the queen from the colony for the required\r\ntime (p. 36) and the return of the same queen is a method which has\r\nbeen used in swarm control. Of course, no queen cells should be\r\npermitted to develop in the meantime. Such colonies may prepare to\r\nswarm again, especially if the period of queenlessness is not more than\r\n10 days. The method is a valuable one, however, and may be used at any\r\ntime during the season on colonies making preparations to swarm.\r\n\r\n=Dequeening in connection with requeening.=--Requeening each\r\ncolony with a young queen early in the season may greatly reduce the\r\npercentage of colonies that attempt to swarm but can not be relied upon\r\nas a method of complete control since during a good and prolonged honey\r\nflow quite a number of such colonies prepare to swarm. If each colony\r\nis requeened with a young queen at the beginning of the honey flow,\r\n_after having been queenless for 10 or 15 days_, there will probably be\r\nvery little if any swarming during an ordinary season. This method is\r\nnot in general use among beekeepers, largely because of the difficulty\r\nin so timing the operation that there will be no loss. The following\r\nare illustrative of the various adaptations of requeening in connection\r\nwith a period of no brood rearing.\r\n\r\n(1) Just previous to the honey flow and at about the time that heavy\r\nbrood rearing is no longer desirable, remove the queen from each\r\ncolony, (_a_) Eight or ten days later destroy all queen cells but one\r\nand allow the colony to requeen itself, or (_b_) destroy _all_ queen\r\ncells 8 or 10 days after removing the queen, then after 3 to 6 days\r\nsupply each colony with a \"ripe\" queen cell (one in which the queen\r\nis ready to emerge), a virgin queen, or a young laying queen. It is\r\nusually desirable that the interval of queenlessness be as short as\r\npossible without defeating its purpose. Some beekeepers give a young\r\nlaying queen 10 days after removing the old one, or a virgin or ripe\r\ncell considerably earlier, sometimes even at the time the old queen is\r\nremoved, while others prefer a period of at least 14 days before giving\r\neither a laying or a virgin queen. However, colonies with virgin queens\r\nsometimes swarm even though no other queen cells or larvæ from which to\r\nrear a queen are present. Another objection to the use of queen cells\r\nor virgin queens for this purpose is that some of the queens fail to\r\nemerge and some virgin queens fail to mate, thus leaving the colony\r\nhopelessly queenless. For these reasons, some prefer to have the young\r\nqueens mate and begin to lay in \"nuclei\" (very small colonies) before\r\nintroducing[6] them in the strong colonies. This method may be used\r\nfor the entire apiary at the beginning of the honey flow or it may be\r\napplied only to those colonies making preparations to swarm.\r\n\r\n[6] The young laying queens may be introduced Into the colony by the\r\nordinary indirect or caging method (Farmers' Bulletin No. 447, p. 44)\r\nor together with a comb of brood and adhering from the nucleus from\r\nwhich she was mated.\r\n\r\n(2) Use two hive bodies as a brood chamber before the honey flow,\r\nuniting if necessary to secure strong colonies. At the beginning of\r\nthe honey flow divide each colony, leaving the field bees and most\r\nof the brood on the old stand in one hive body, placing the queen,\r\nremaining brood, and enough bees to care for it in the other hive body\r\nwhich is set beside the first. The supers are of course given to the\r\nqueenless colony on the old stand, which after the proper interval\r\nof queenlessness is allowed to requeen itself or is requeened by the\r\nbeekeeper as in (1) above. The colony containing the old queen may be\r\nused to strengthen the storing colony by shifting its position from one\r\nside of it to the other (p. 31), or used for increase.\r\n\r\n(3) Ten days before the honey flow is expected to begin, put most of\r\nthe brood into a single hive body, on this a queen excluder, and over\r\nthis a second hive body with a frame of brood and the queen, the other\r\ncombs of this set being empty except perhaps a little brood and honey.\r\nNine or ten days later remove the upper story, supply it with a bottom\r\nboard, and place it close beside the original hive. Destroy queen cells\r\nif any are present in the queenless portion which remains on the old\r\nstand, give a ripe queen cell, virgin queen, or a young laying queen,\r\nand put on the supers. The brood chamber containing the old queen may\r\nbe used to make increase or its flying bees may be united with the\r\nstoring colony (p. 31).\r\n\r\nBy any of these methods there is a break of 10 to 15 days in the\r\ncontinuity of brood emergence in the brood chamber left on the old\r\nstand and the colonies are requeened with young queens--each a strong\r\nfactor in swarm control and when combined should with rare exceptions\r\nresult in no swarming.\r\n\r\n=REMOVING THE BROOD FROM THE HIVE.=\r\n\r\nSince removing the brood brings about conditions quite similar to that\r\nof natural swarming (p. 28), such a management of the colonies is\r\npractically identical with that of natural swarming. The use of the\r\nbrood that is removed (p. 29), the question of what should be used in\r\nthe brood chamber instead of the removed brood (p. 32), the contraction\r\nof the brood chamber (p. 33), etc., have been discussed under natural\r\nswarming and need not be repeated here. While some of the plans using\r\nthis principle may be applied to all the colonies in the apiary before\r\nswarming actually begins, the usual practice is to apply them only to\r\nsuch colonies as are making preparations to swarm. It should not be\r\nused on weak colonies, on colonies having a small percentage of sealed\r\nand emerging brood and few young bees, on colonies in which the queen\r\nis failing, or on any colonies during a very poor season. Under any\r\nof these conditions it is usually better to discourage swarming by\r\ndestroying queen cells (p. 27), by removing one or two frames of brood,\r\nor, if some control measure is finally necessary, by requeening such\r\ncolonies after an interval of queenlessness. On the other hand, for\r\nstrong colonies having a high percentage of sealed and emerging brood\r\nand a good queen the method usually gives excellent results, since\r\nby its use the workers, queen, and supers are kept together during\r\nthe flow. The following are some of the various plans employing this\r\nprinciple of swarm control:\r\n\r\n(1) Find the queen and put the comb on which she is found to one side,\r\nthen shake the bees from most of the other combs into or in front of\r\ntheir hive. As the combs of brood are removed put frames containing\r\neither narrow strips or full sheets of foundation or combs into the\r\nhive and replace the supers. When most of the shaken bees are in the\r\nhive, place the queen among them. Put all the brood and the few bees\r\nremaining thereon into another hive close beside the shaken colony\r\n(fig. 17). Enough bees should be left on the combs of brood to care for\r\nit; usually two combs are not shaken at all, but placed in the other\r\nhive with all the adhering bees. For further disposition of the brood\r\nsee page 29.\r\n\r\n(2) In order to avoid the trouble of finding the queen, the above plan\r\nmay be varied by shaking and brushing _all_ the bees from the combs so\r\nas to be sure that the queen is among them. In this case the brood may\r\nbe utilized by one of the following plans: (_a_) Use it to build up\r\nweaker colonies (p. 31) or (_b_) place it in a hive body over a queen\r\nexcluder on top of the forced swarm or some colony not being used for\r\ncomb-honey production that can spare enough bees to care for it. In a\r\nshort time bees will pass through the excluder and cover the brood,\r\nafter which the hive body containing it is removed, supplied with a\r\ncover and bottom board, and placed at one side of the forced swarm so\r\nthat the emerging bees may later be added to the swarm. Or (_c_) after\r\nthe shaking is complete, remove the forced swarm and put the hive body\r\ncontaining the brood temporarily back on the original stand to induce\r\nfield bees to enter it. Then in the evening set it aside and restore\r\nthe swarm to its position on the old stand. These field bees will\r\nbe able to prevent the brood being chilled during the night but in\r\nreturning from the fields the next day will enter the hive on the old\r\nstand. In the meantime enough young bees will have emerged to care for\r\nthe brood.\r\n\r\n(3) Removing all the brood and substituting frames containing narrow\r\nstrips or full sheets of foundation sometimes results in the colony\r\nswarming out the next day. This may be avoided by removing the brood\r\nin two installments with an interval of a few days between the\r\ntwo operations. When the brood is not all removed, full sheets of\r\nfoundation or empty combs should be used or an excessive amount of\r\ndrone comb will be built.\r\n\r\nWith sectional hives, stand the brood chamber on end, smoke the bees\r\nout of the lower section, and remove it. Destroy queen cells in the\r\nupper hive section. These will almost universally be found projecting\r\ninto the space between the two sections of the brood chamber.\r\nSubstitute a new hive section containing empty combs or foundation for\r\nthe removed section. After, a few days remove the supers, smoke the\r\nbees out of the upper section, remove it, and add it to the section\r\nthat was removed before, which at the time of its removal was given the\r\nusual position beside the colony (fig. 17).\r\n\r\n(4) Use two hive bodies as a brood chamber throughout the year except\r\nduring the honey flow. Have both as well filled with brood as possible\r\nprevious to the flow. About 10 days before the honey flow is expected\r\nto begin, insert a queen-excluding honey board (fig. 2) between the\r\ntwo hive bodies. The queen is now confined to a single one of the hive\r\nbodies. After 10 days transfer the queen[7] to the other hive body\r\nplaced on the old stand and put on the supers. Remove the hive body\r\nin which the queen has been confined to one side of the colony on the\r\nold stand and supply it with a ripe queen cell (in a protector) or a\r\nvirgin queen. When the young queen begins to lay, exchange places with\r\nthe two hive bodies so that the one containing the young queen now\r\nbecomes the storing colony, giving it the supers and field bees. Shift\r\nthe hive containing the old queen from one side to the other of the\r\ncolony on the old stand about once a week, so that the entire flying\r\nforce of both are at work in the hive with the supers (p. 31). At the\r\nclose of the honey flow the old queen may be killed unless she is\r\nespecially valuable and the two divisions may be reunited. The period\r\nof 10 days during which no eggs are laid in the hive body used by the\r\nstoring colony at the beginning of the honey flow should delay swarming\r\nat least until the young queen begins to lay. When the other hive body\r\nwith the young queen is substituted, it has had a similar period of\r\nno egg laying in addition to having a young laying queen, making a\r\ndesirable combination.\r\n\r\n[7] It is not necessary to find the queen, since the presence of\r\nunsealed brood indicates In which hive body she is confined. She may\r\nbe transferred to the other hive body by shaking all the bees from the\r\ncombs she is known to occupy in with the bees of the other hive body.\r\nIn this case some bees are returned to the shaken combs (p. 38) before\r\nthis brood is set aside, to prevent its being chilled.\r\n\r\n=Mechanical devices.=--A number of mechanical devices have been\r\ndescribed for shifting bees from one brood chamber to another. These\r\npermit the bees to leave the hive when going to the fields and are\r\nso arranged that the returning bees are led to enter the new brood\r\nchamber. This is accomplished by means of switches in the bottom board\r\nor by a chute or tube so attached that the entrance to the old brood\r\nchamber is closed, allowing exit only through the tube which opens near\r\nthe entrance of the new brood chamber. In either case the hives are so\r\narranged that the bees returning from the field readily enter the new\r\nbrood chamber. The queen is found and together with a comb of brood and\r\nadhering bees is put into the new brood chamber, and the supers are\r\ntransferred from the old to the new brood chamber. The young bees as\r\nthey learn to fly are added to the swarm by the same device. Otherwise\r\nthe manipulation is the same as the other methods described.\r\n\r\n=SEPARATING THE QUEEN AND BROOD WITHIN THE HIVE.=\r\n\r\nIn some swarm-control methods neither the queen nor the brood is\r\nremoved from the hive, but these are temporarily separated within\r\nthe hive. These methods are ordinarily used only on colonies making\r\npreparations to swarm and are practically equivalent to the dequeening\r\nplan. The following methods make use of this principle of swarm control:\r\n\r\n(1) The queen may be placed in a wire-cloth cage within the hive or may\r\nbe confined to a small comb surface within the brood chamber by means\r\nof queen-excluding zinc. No queen cells are permitted to mature, and\r\nthe queen is liberated after 10 to 15 days.\r\n\r\n(2) The queen together with a comb containing a small amount of brood\r\nis placed in a lower hive body containing no other frames or combs.\r\nAfter destroying all queen cells the brood is placed in a second hive\r\nbody, the two hive bodies being separated by a queen-excluding honey\r\nboard and the supers adjusted above the brood as before. The queen,\r\nbeing separated from the brood by means of the excluder, lays few eggs\r\nin the comb on which she is confined during this period of separation.\r\nAfter a week or 10 days the queen cells are again destroyed, and the\r\nbrood and queen are put back into a single hive body as before. This\r\nmethod gives results quite similar to the dequeening method (p. 35).\r\n\r\nIf every season were alike in a given locality the beekeeper could\r\nwork out a manipulation to be applied to each colony just before or at\r\nthe beginning of the honey flow, which would result in practically no\r\nswarming. The wide variation in the seasons, however, renders it next\r\nto impossible to adopt a swarm-control measure that will prove most\r\nprofitable every year. The means of control adopted must be such as\r\nto favor the domination of the storing instinct. Probably the plan of\r\nmaking weekly visits is the most widely used system of swarm control\r\nby manipulation. When a colony is found preparing to swarm, the brood\r\nis removed if conditions are such as to justify doing so (p. 37).\r\nOtherwise the removal of the queen is resorted to.\r\n\r\nWith any of these methods of control the colony may rapidly restore\r\nformer conditions, and even though it has been diverted from swarming\r\nmay later again prepare to swarm and require a second manipulation.\r\nGenerally speaking, when the honey flow is short, less radical measures\r\nare required. Colonies that have been supplied with young queens after\r\na period of queenlessness have one factor (the queen) changed with at\r\nleast some degree of permanency. Colonies that have been compelled to\r\nconstruct a new set of brood combs from narrow strips of foundation\r\nhave the most radical change of conditions as to brood rearing. Either\r\nof these changes alone is usually sufficient to insure no further\r\npreparations to swarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manipulation of the Supers.=\r\n\r\nProper manipulation of the comb-honey supers is not only a strong\r\nfactor in the prevention of swarming but is also a stimulus to\r\nstoring. The amount of room the colonies should have in the surplus\r\napartment varies so much that the ordinary standard super is simply\r\na unit in a large and flexible surplus apartment. If enough surplus\r\nroom is given at the beginning of the season for the storage of the\r\nentire crop of honey, the space so given is too great for best results\r\nat the beginning of the honey flow, and little of it is needed at\r\nall if the season is poor. If, on the other hand, a single super is\r\ngiven and no other added until the first is completed, the room in\r\nthe surplus apartment decreases from the time the super is given\r\nuntil the combs are completely drawn out, when there is little space\r\nleft between the combs, the bees being practically crowded out. Thus\r\nwhile the population of the colony is increasing their room is being\r\ndiminished--a condition highly conducive to swarming and less energetic\r\nwork. After the super is filled, it is some time before the honey is\r\nripened and sealed, ready to be removed. During this interval, if no\r\nother supers are given, there is no place for storage of the incoming\r\nnectar, and the comb builders must remain idle or waste their wax in\r\nbuilding burr and brace combs. To avoid loss in this way, empty supers\r\nare added as they are needed, and the comb builders move from one super\r\nto another as their work in each is completed. The surplus apartment,\r\nwhether consisting of a single super or several supers, should at all\r\ntimes contain some space for the comb builders.\r\n\r\nIf the honey flow is heavy and promises to continue, it is desirable\r\nto furnish not only sufficient room but to induce the bees to begin\r\nwork in as many sections as possible, giving large comb surface for\r\nthe storage and evaporation of the thin nectar, thus in a measure\r\napproximating extracted honey conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is a danger, however, that if the bees are induced to extend\r\ntheir work through too many supers, the sections when completed will be\r\nless well filled and therefore lighter in weight. Also, if the honey\r\nflow should not continue as expected a rapid expansion of the surplus\r\napartment results in a large number of unfinished sections.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of the expansion of work in the supers may to some extent\r\nbe regulated by the position of each newly added super. If a rapid\r\nexpansion is desirable, the empty super is placed below the supers\r\nalready on the hive, while if it seems best to crowd the bees somewhat\r\nthe empty super is placed above those already on the hive. When the\r\nempty super is placed above the partly finished ones, the bees do not\r\nbegin work therein unless they need the room. This practice is always\r\ndesirable during a slow honey flow or toward the close of any honey\r\nflow, but when nectar is coming in rapidly does not result in a rapid\r\nexpansion of comb building sufficient to avoid a more or less crowded\r\ncondition, which in turn causes a loss of honey and increases the\r\nprobability of swarming. If each super is supplied with one or two\r\nextracting combs (p. 16), this disadvantage of the practice of placing\r\nthe empty super on top largely disappears, since the extracting combs\r\nare immediately available for the storage of nectar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Arrangement of supers. (Original.)]\r\n\r\nWhen the empty supers are placed under the partly filled ones, work\r\nin them is commenced promptly, but this may be at the expense of the\r\nnearly completed sections, which by this plan are moved farther from\r\nthe brood chamber as each empty super is added. In the case of the\r\nsuper in which the honey is being sealed this distance is an advantage\r\nin so far as the whiteness of the cappings is concerned, but it may\r\nretard the completion of the work. An arrangement of the supers that\r\nto some extent avoids this difficulty is as follows: Except toward the\r\nclose of the season, place each newly added super next to the brood\r\nchamber and keep the one nearest completion just above it with all\r\nothers arranged above these two, the one in which least progress has\r\nbeen made being on top (fig. 19). Thus super No. 1 is raised up and\r\nNo. 2 placed beneath it. When No. 3 is given, it is placed next to the\r\nbrood chamber, while above it is No. 1 with No. 2 on top. If No. 4 is\r\ngiven, it is placed next to the brood chamber with Nos. 1, 2, and 3 in\r\norder above it. By this arrangement, if conditions justify doing so,\r\nstrong colonies may be induced to expand their surplus apartment with\r\ngreat rapidity, since as soon as the foundation is well drawn in each\r\nnewly added super it may be transposed to the top and an empty one put\r\nin its place. Such rapid expansion of work in the supers should not be\r\nattempted, however, except during a heavy honey flow.\r\n\r\nIf early in the honey flow the bees are storing rapidly, strong\r\ncolonies should be given a second super as soon as work has been fairly\r\nbegun in the first. Colonies of medium strength may of course be\r\nallowed to do considerable work in the first super before the second is\r\ngiven, while a weak colony may have sufficient room for comb building\r\nuntil the first super is almost completed. The first super should\r\ncontain some empty comb when given to the colony, and each succeeding\r\nsuper should be given in advance of the time when the bees would be\r\nin any way crowded without it. At no time should all the sections be\r\nremoved and new supers containing only foundation be given, but the\r\nsurplus apartment should contain sections in all the various stages of\r\ndevelopment. In this way there is no break in the work in the supers,\r\nand the critical periods, so far as the super room bears upon the\r\nproblems of swarming and energetic work, are largely eliminated.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the honey flow the reasons for further\r\nexpansion of the surplus apartment in excess of the immediate needs of\r\nthe colonies (p. 41) no longer exist. At the beginning of a good honey\r\nflow the maximum of new work consistent with well-filled sections is\r\ndesirable, while toward the close of the flow the beekeeper desires\r\nthe minimum of new work consistent with sufficient room. The precise\r\nperiod when further expansion of the surplus apartment is no longer\r\ndesirable and a concentration of the work already begun should take\r\nplace is sometimes difficult to determine, and to do so requires a\r\nthorough knowledge of the locality and good judgment on the part of the\r\nbeekeeper.\r\n\r\nIt is usually desirable to remove the honey as soon after it is\r\nfinished as can well be done. If it is left on the hives too long after\r\nit is finished, it is likely to become discolored or \"travel stained,\"\r\nwhile if it is taken off too soon some of the sections are not\r\ncompleted. It is desirable that the honey be removed by entire supers\r\ninstead of by individual sections, therefore conditions should be made\r\nas favorable as possible for the completion of all the sections in a\r\nsuper without the more advanced ones becoming \"travel stained.\" The\r\nbees are more inclined to stain the white surface of the combs toward\r\nthe close of the honey flow or during very slow flows. Trouble from\r\nthis source is at such time intensified because of the uneven progress\r\nof work in the different sections, the more advanced sections therefore\r\nbeing sealed some time before the super is sufficiently advanced to\r\njustify its removal. Another form of discoloration is brought about by\r\nthe honey being sealed in close proximity to old and dark brood combs,\r\nin which case some of the darker wax from the old combs is sometimes\r\napparently used for capping the honey.\r\n\r\nDuring a good honey flow all except the last supers may be left upon\r\nthe hives until all or nearly all of the sections of honey are sealed,\r\nsince (1) there is little trouble from \"travel stain\" when work is\r\nprogressing rapidly, (2) all the sections in the super are ready to be\r\nsealed at about the same time, and (3) when there are several supers on\r\neach hive the one in which the honey is being sealed is at least one\r\nsuper removed from the brood combs.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the honey flow all supers having most of their\r\nsections finished should be removed and the sections sorted. The\r\nunfinished sections should be graded according to the degree of\r\ncompletion, the various grades placed in supers and given to such\r\ncolonies as are most likely to finish them. Every effort should be made\r\nat this time to contract the surplus apartment, concentrating the work\r\nupon the sections nearest completion. All supers in which work has not\r\nyet been started should be removed and as soon as possible the surplus\r\napartment of each colony should be reduced to one super. Though little\r\nroom is necessary during the close of the honey flow, there should\r\nalways be some room for the storage of new nectar until it is ripened.\r\nFor such conditions extracting combs are valuable, since, instead of\r\ngiving the last comb-honey super in which little work would be done, a\r\nset of extracting combs may be placed over the sections to afford room\r\nfor the incoming nectar and comb surface for its ripening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=CARING FOR THE CROP.=\r\n\r\n\r\n=Removing the Honey from the Hives.=\r\n\r\nIf the honey flow is of considerable duration the major portion of the\r\ncrop is removed before the flow ceases. At this time the removal of the\r\nfinished supers is comparatively easy because the bees can readily be\r\ndriven from them and also because the operator is not hindered in his\r\nwork by robbing bees. At the close of the honey flow all the supers\r\nremaining upon the hives should be removed promptly, since to leave\r\nthem on would result not only in some of the honey being carried down\r\ninto the brood chamber but also in badly propolized sections. After\r\nthe honey flow has ceased, great care should be exercised to keep bees\r\nfrom robbing. The use of bee-escapes (fig. 12) greatly facilitates the\r\nremoval of the honey at any time, but their use is especially desirable\r\nin removing the honey remaining on the hives at the close of the honey\r\nflow. By their use the honey may be removed and stored in the honey\r\nhouse with little disturbance or excitement among the bees. The supers\r\nof honey should of course be taken directly to the honey house or kept\r\nwell covered[8] from robbers.\r\n\r\n[8] Honey from out-apiaries should be loaded for transportation in\r\nsuch a manner that the bees can not get at it, then before the horse\r\nis hitched to the wagon the load of honey should be drawn by hand some\r\ndistance from the apiary if the slope of the ground will permit doing\r\nso. If this is not possible the horse may be attached by means of a\r\nlong rope and the load drawn to a safe distance before the horse is\r\nhitched to the wagon.\r\n\r\nBefore finally storing the supers of honey in the honey room those that\r\nare but partly filled may have their sections removed and sorted. The\r\nunfinished sections that can not be disposed of at a profit locally\r\nare usually put back into supers and the honey they contain is fed to\r\nthe bees. This feeding is done by simply exposing the supers where the\r\nflying bees can have access to them. If there are few supers compared\r\nwith the number of colonies they should be placed in piles and only\r\na small entrance allowed, since if free access were given to a large\r\nnumber of bees they would tear the combs to pieces. When the bees have\r\nfinished removing the honey from these unfinished sections the latter\r\nmay be stored for future use as \"bait\" sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Care of Comb Honey.=\r\n\r\nIn the honey room the supers of honey should be placed in piles in such\r\na manner as to allow a free circulation of air between them. This may\r\nbe done by \"sticking them up\" as lumber is piled to dry or by placing\r\nalternate supers crosswise. The air in the honey room should be kept\r\nas dry as possible. This is usually accomplished by means of a high\r\ntemperature, the honey room being located on the sunny side of the\r\nbuilding or directly under the roof. The windows should be opened only\r\nduring dry weather. Ventilation of the honey room is of no value except\r\nwhen the air that is admitted contains less moisture than that already\r\npresent. Otherwise ventilation may be a positive detriment. If a\r\nprotracted period of rainy or damp weather should occur while the honey\r\nis in this storage it may be necessary to use artificial heat to dry\r\nthe air in the honey room. Any great variation in temperature should be\r\navoided, since it may cause a condensation of moisture on the surface\r\nof the cappings which will be absorbed by the honey.\r\n\r\nSome beekeepers find it necessary to fumigate comb honey to prevent\r\ndamage by the larvæ of the wax moth. For this purpose sulphur fumes or\r\nbisulphid of carbon may be used. If bisulphid of carbon is used, great\r\ncare should be taken not to bring it near a flame, as it is highly\r\ninflammable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Scraping Propolis from Sections.=\r\n\r\nBefore being packed for market the sections of honey should be removed\r\nfrom the supers and the wood scraped free of propolis. A convenient\r\nbench should be provided for this work, with a large shallow box or\r\ntray to catch the propolis as it is scraped from the sections. This\r\nwork is usually done by hand, though a few producers have designed and\r\nare using machines for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Grading Comb Honey.=\r\n\r\nThe importance of properly grading and packing comb honey does not seem\r\nto be well understood by the average beekeeper. Some extensive buyers\r\nof comb honey find it profitable to regrade and repack practically all\r\nthe comb honey they receive before sending it out to their trade. The\r\nproducer of this honey of course bears this extra expense by receiving\r\na lower price for his honey. The lack of uniformity of grading is to\r\nsome extent a result of differences of opinion as to what should be the\r\nstandard for the various grades. Grading rules have been of material\r\naid toward greater uniformity, but various producers may use the same\r\nset of grading rules with very different results. It would be well if\r\na single set of rules were in use, since honey from various localities\r\nmay be sent to the same market. The grading rules in most common use\r\nare given in Farmers' Bulletin 447, page 39.\r\n\r\nAfter scraping the propolis from the wood, each section of honey may\r\nbe placed in a pile with others of its grade. Some put the sections\r\ndirectly into the shipping cases as fast as they are scraped, but\r\nbetter grading can be done if each grade is put in a separate pile\r\nand the final grading all done by one person. By thus having a large\r\nnumber of sections in each grade from which to select there is greater\r\nopportunity for making the sections of honey in each case more nearly\r\nuniform as to weight and the various shades of finish. Such uniformity\r\nis especially desirable from the standpoint of the retailer. Sections\r\ncontaining only a few cells of pollen should be placed in a lower grade\r\nor sold as culls, while those containing a considerable amount of\r\npollen should not be marketed in the form of comb honey. An excessive\r\namount of pollen in the sections is usually caused by the use of very\r\nshallow brood combs, extreme contraction of the brood chamber, or\r\nhiving swarms on narrow strips of foundation in the brood frames with\r\npartly drawn comb in the sections (p. 32).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Packages for Comb Honey.=\r\n\r\nComb honey is usually packed in cases holding 24 sections (fig. 20).\r\nOther sizes are sometimes used to meet special market requirements. The\r\nmarkets have become accustomed to cases with glass fronts, by means\r\nof which the contents are displayed to advantage. However, in keeping\r\nwith present practice in other package goods, considerable comb honey\r\nis now placed on the market having each section inclosed in a carton.\r\nThis practice, while losing the advantage of displaying the honey, has\r\na decided advantage in insuring security from dust and insects while\r\nin the markets as well as greater safety to the fragile comb when the\r\npackage is finally delivered to the consumer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Shipping cases for comb honey. (From\r\nPhillips.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Marketing.=\r\n\r\nMany beekeepers are able to dispose of their entire output of honey\r\nin their local markets, sometimes, creating quite a demand for their\r\nproduct by advertising and demonstrating. Comb honey that is to be\r\nsent to a distant market should be shipped before cold weather, since\r\nthe combs become extremely fragile when cold. Small lots should be\r\ncrated in \"carriers\" holding several cases to prevent breakage by rough\r\nhandling of individual cases, while in larger shipments the cases are\r\nsimply packed in the car in such a manner that the individual cases can\r\nnot be thrown about by the movement of the car.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Notes\r\n\r\n\r\nAll illustrations were moved so as to not split paragraphs.\r\nIrregularity in hyphenation (for comb-honey vs. comb honey and some\r\nothers) has been retained.",
