Kingston.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nThe \"Steadfast\" is a whaling vessel, based on Liverpool.  The whaling\r\ngrounds are in the Pacific, so each voyage involves a long time away\r\nfrom home.  The story opens with the owner-captain's wife and daughter\r\nsitting at home during a great storm, in which a vessel is wrecked very\r\nnear their house.\r\n\r\nOn board the ship are Harry Graybrook, the skipper's son, and another\r\nyoungster called Dickey Bass.  Leonard Champion is the mate, and is also\r\nin love with the captain's daughter, whom we met in Chapter One.  There\r\nis an incident with a whale which results in the \"Steadfast\" being\r\nseparated from a small boat containing the above, as well as an old\r\nseaman known as \"old Tom\", and several other seamen.  They try to regain\r\ncontact with the mother ship, but fail.  They run out of food and water,\r\nbut land on an island where they are catching fish and filling their\r\nwater containers, when they are attacked by a hostile band of natives\r\nwho kill some of the seamen.  After a long time at sea with very little\r\nwater and food they are picked up by another whaling vessel, but are\r\ntreated very badly by her moody and eccentric captain.\r\n\r\nShipwrecked again, and after various adventures, they meet up with some\r\nmissionaries.  Eventually contact is made again with the \"Steadfast\",\r\nand back they go to England, where Leonard Champion marries the\r\ndaughter, and takes command of the ship on old Graybrook's retirement.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nTHE VOYAGE OF THE \"STEADFAST\"--THE YOUNG MISSIONARIES IN THE PACIFIC,\r\nBY W.H.G. KINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN GRAYBROOK'S HOME.\r\n\r\nA heavy gale was blowing, which shook the windows of the little\r\ndrawing-room in which Mrs Graybrook and her daughter Hannah were seated\r\nat their work.\r\n\r\nTheir cottage was situated close to the sea on the north coast of Wales,\r\nso that from it, on a clear day, many a tall ship bound for Liverpool,\r\nor sailing from that port, could be seen through the telescope which\r\nstood ever ready pointed across the water.\r\n\r\nA lamp burning on the table, for it was night, shed its light on the\r\ncomely features and matronly figure of the elder lady, as she busily\r\nplied her needle, while it showed that those of Hannah, a fair and\r\ninteresting-looking girl just growing into womanhood, were unusually\r\npale.  Every now and then she unconsciously let her work drop on her lap\r\nwhile, with her eyes turned towards the window and lips apart, she\r\nseemed to be listening for some sound which her mother's ear had not\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nA glance into the little room might have shown why both mother and\r\ndaughter should feel anxious when tempests were raging and the sea was\r\ntossing with angry waves.\r\n\r\nThe mantel-piece was ornamented with some beautiful branches of coral,\r\nseveral large and rare shells, and two horns of the narwhal, or\r\nsea-unicorn, fixed against the wall, and above it was the picture of a\r\nship under all sail, with boats hoisted up along her sides, and flags\r\nflying at her mastheads and peak.  On the top of a bookcase stood the\r\nperfect model of a vessel; another part of the wall was adorned with\r\nIndian bows and spears and clubs, arranged in symmetrical order; while\r\none side of the room was hung with pictures, in which boats in chase of\r\nthe mighty monsters of the deep formed the chief subjects, or which\r\nrepresented scenes on the coasts of far-distant lands.\r\n\r\nHannah had more than once risen and gone to the window, across which--\r\nfor the weather was still warm--the curtain had only partially been\r\ndrawn.\r\n\r\nAnother fierce blast shook the whole house.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mother, what a dreadful night it is!\" she exclaimed, at length.  \"I\r\nfancied I heard the sound of a distant gun; it must come from some ship\r\nin distress.  What can she do if embayed off our shore in this terrific\r\ngale?\"\r\n\r\nMrs Graybrook looked up from her work.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking, my child, how thankful we should be that the\r\n_Steadfast_ has long ago been far away from this.  Your father and Harry\r\nare enjoying, I hope, smooth seas and gentle breezes, and may such, I\r\npray, follow them wherever they go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust that they are, mother; but still I cannot help feeling anxious\r\non such a night as this, with the wind howling and raging round us, when\r\nI think in what condition a ship must be placed, exposed on the wild sea\r\nto its fury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father has often said that he cares little for the heaviest gale,\r\nprovided he has plenty of sea-room; and a better-found ship and\r\nstauncher crew than his, he declares, does not sail out of the port of\r\nLiverpool.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that he has great faith in the _Steadfast's_ good qualities; but\r\neven the finest ship may meet with accidents; and oh, how many are the\r\ndangers she must have to run before she returns home!\" said Hannah, with\r\na sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Your father is a careful navigator, my dear, and he has vigilant\r\nofficers.  His first mate is a tried hand, and he considers Leonard\r\nChampion, his second mate, young as he is, an excellent seaman and fully\r\ncapable of taking charge of a ship; he hopes, indeed, to get him the\r\ncommand of one when he returns, though he would be sorry to lose him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that, mother; and I am wrong to express my fears,\" answered\r\nHannah.  \"Still I cannot help feeling for the poor seamen who may be\r\nbattling with the tempest to-night; and that makes me more anxious,\r\nperhaps, about those who are far away, and of the dangers to which they\r\nmay be exposed.  Surely there was another gun!\"\r\n\r\nShe again went to the window, and, throwing it open, looked out into the\r\ndarkness.  The fierce wind coming in made the curtains flutter, and\r\nalmost blew out the lamp.\r\n\r\n\"I saw the flash of a gun, mother.  It is in the direction of those dark\r\nrocks which lift their heads above the water!\" exclaimed Hannah.  \"Ah!\r\nI heard the sound also.  There is another flash!  They must have come\r\nfrom some unfortunate ship.  Perhaps she is already on the rocks.  Can\r\nany boat venture out to her assistance in a storm like this?  I will\r\nshut the window directly, mother,\" she added, looking round, and trying\r\nto catch the fluttering curtains.\r\n\r\nAgain she looked out.  \"I cannot be mistaken!\" she exclaimed, the tone\r\nof her voice showing her anxiety.  \"There is another gun.  The ship must\r\nbe in fearful peril!  Can nothing be done to help the poor people?\"\r\n\r\nMrs Graybrook, convinced that Hannah was right in her conjecture, came\r\nto the window, and mother and daughter stood gazing out for some\r\nminutes, and trying to penetrate the thick gloom which hung over the\r\nwild, tempestuous sea raging below them.\r\n\r\nA fiercer blast than before, which drove the rain and spray against\r\ntheir faces, compelled them to close the window; yet Hannah could not\r\nwithdraw herself from it, for she still caught an occasional flash, and\r\ncould distinguish the roar of the guns even amidst the howling of the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\n\"What help can we render to them?\" she again asked.\r\n\r\n\"We may give them aid--all the aid which we have the power to give,\"\r\nsaid Mrs Graybrook, placing her work on the table.  \"We can pray for\r\nthem as we pray for those who are far away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never cease to pray for those dear ones, mother, morning and evening,\r\nand every hour of the day,\" said Hannah.  \"Oh, that they had learned to\r\npray for themselves,\" she murmured; \"to seek that aid in time of need\r\nwhich will never be withheld!\"\r\n\r\nTogether the mother and daughter knelt, and offered up their prayers to\r\nthe throne of grace, that help might be sent to those near at hand,\r\nwhile their petitions went up also for those loved ones at a distance.\r\nThey knew that the all-seeing eye of the God of mercy could follow them,\r\nthat His far-reaching hand could protect them, and that, feeble as were\r\ntheir petitions, He heard and would grant them if He saw fit.\r\n\r\nThey rose with hearts cheered and comforted.\r\n\r\n\"I should indeed be happier if Harry had known and accepted the truth,\"\r\nsaid Mrs Graybrook, continuing the conversation just before begun.  \"He\r\nis so light-hearted, and, enjoying health and strength, so confident in\r\nhimself, that his mind has hitherto appeared incapable of attending to\r\nspiritual things; though, when I have spoken to him, he has respectfully\r\nlistened with a grave countenance; but the subject has evidently not\r\nbeen to his taste.  My grief is, also, that your father so admires his\r\nbold and daring spirit, that he encourages him to think more of the\r\nthings of this world than of the future.  Excellent as your father is,\r\ntoo, he has not had the same advantages of receiving religious\r\ninstruction which we have possessed, and is therefore unable to impart\r\nit to Harry.  This made me very unwilling that your brother should go to\r\nsea before he was a confirmed Christian; but your father was so\r\ndetermined to take him that I was compelled to consent.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Graybrook would not have spoken thus to Hannah of her father's want\r\nof religious principle, but that she knew her daughter was well aware of\r\nit, and mourned for it with her, while she had often joined with her in\r\nprayer that he might be brought to know the truth.  Mrs Graybrook had\r\nfar too much delicacy and sense of what is right, under other\r\ncircumstances, to have spoken to her daughter in any way which might\r\nhave appeared disrespectful of Captain Graybrook, for whom they both\r\nentertained the deepest affection.  Her true and faithful love for her\r\nhusband made her feel as she did; for, having learned the value of her\r\nown soul, she was anxious about his and that of her dear boy.\r\n\r\n\"I at first had hoped that Leonard Champion would have proved an\r\nadvantageous companion to Harry,\" continued Mrs Graybrook.  \"But, if\r\nnot inclined to laugh at religion, he is, I fear, ignorant of its vital\r\ntruths or indifferent to them, and Harry therefore cannot be benefited\r\nthrough his means.\"\r\n\r\nHannah sighed.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, mamma; Mr Champion cannot lead Harry to the fountain in\r\nwhich he does not see the need of being washed himself.  I spoke to him\r\nearnestly on the subject, but without avail, though he accepted some\r\nbooks which I offered him, and promised to read them when he had time.\"\r\n\r\nThe two ladies had, since they settled in Wales, enjoyed the ministry of\r\none of those gifted servants of God, to whom the honour has been given\r\nof winning souls to Christ by their preaching and private exhortations.\r\nHe had been a frequent visitor at the cottage; and mother and daughter,\r\nhaving accepted the truth, had been built up in their faith, becoming\r\nearnest yet humble Christians.\r\n\r\nThis was after Harry went to school.  During his short holidays, though\r\nhis mother and sister had often earnestly and lovingly spoken to him,\r\nthey had made no apparent impression on his mind, all his thoughts being\r\nset on going to sea.  His mother had now deeply to regret that she\r\nherself, ignorant of the truth during his childhood's days, had been\r\nunable to instruct him while his young mind was ready to receive the\r\nreligious knowledge she might have imparted.\r\n\r\nHow many a mother must feel as she did!\r\n\r\nCaptain Graybrook had been constantly at sea, and when he came home for\r\na brief visit, though he remarked the change in his wife and daughter,\r\nand found that they were unwilling to engage in any of the frivolous\r\namusements of society, he looked upon the opinions they expressed as\r\nmere passing fancies, and begged to be excused from listening to the\r\npreacher of whom they spoke so highly.\r\n\r\n\"Those sort of things are very good, my dear wife, for some people,\" he\r\nanswered, carelessly; \"but sailors have no time to attend to them; I, at\r\nall events, have not, for I have to see to the refitting of the ship;\r\nand you must acknowledge that I have been a good husband and father.  I\r\nhave done my duty; and what more can you want of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"The best of human beings are sinful by nature, and have committed\r\nnumberless sins, and require to be washed in the blood of Jesus to fit\r\nthem to enter into the presence of a pure and holy God,\" answered Mrs\r\nGraybrook, gently.\r\n\r\n\"I dare say it is all true,\" said the captain, kissing his wife.  \"You\r\nare a good creature, and mean well; but I have not time to listen now,\r\nand must be off; so good-bye, Betty, good-bye!\" and he hurried away.\r\n\r\nHannah had entertained hopes of inducing her father's young mate,\r\nLeonard Champion, to listen to the subject which occupied her thoughts.\r\nHe had been a frequent visitor at the house while the ship was\r\nundergoing repairs in the dockyard, for he was an especial favourite of\r\nher father.\r\n\r\nHe was a young man of superior attainments, not having gone to sea till\r\nhe had completed his education at school and had entered college.  At\r\nthat time, his father, who was a merchant, dying just as his firm, by\r\nunforeseen circumstances, had become bankrupt, Leonard was left\r\ndestitute.  He had always had a predilection for the sea, and Captain\r\nGraybrook, an old friend of his father, at once offered, in the most\r\nliberal way, to give him an outfit and to receive him on board his ship.\r\n\r\nLeonard thankfully accepted the offer, and, devoting all his energies\r\nand talents to acquire a knowledge of the profession he had entered,\r\nsoon became an excellent navigator and a first-rate seaman.  Delighting\r\nin his new calling, generous and good-natured as he was cool and daring\r\nin danger, he won the confidence of his captain, and was beloved and\r\nwillingly obeyed by the crew.\r\n\r\nHe had not seen the captain's daughter till the last time the ship\r\nreturned home, and had not expected to find her so engaging and refined\r\na girl.  He was, in her sight, superior to any one she had ever met, and\r\nher affections were engaged before she was aware of the state of her own\r\nfeelings.  He did not conceal his, and, little versed in the ways of the\r\nworld, while utterly free from deceit, he expressed his opinions with a\r\nfreedom which many persons under the circumstances would not have done.\r\nHannah, though admiring his many fine qualities, could not forget that\r\nhe was destitute of the most important of all things--sound religious\r\nprinciple.  Not denying the interest she felt in him, she distinctly\r\ntold him that she would never engage herself to marry one who did not\r\ndesire faithfully to serve the same God and Master whom she did.\r\n\r\nLeonard did not clearly understand her meaning, as, indeed, no one still\r\nfollowing the ways of the world can comprehend the spiritually minded.\r\n\r\nIn vain she spoke to him.  Perhaps not till he had sailed did she\r\ndiscover how completely, in spite of her resolutions, she had given him\r\nher heart.  All she could now do was to pray that the young sailor might\r\nbe brought to a knowledge of the truth.\r\n\r\nThat evening, while the storm was raging, her mind had been far away on\r\nboard the _Steadfast_, and her heart sickened as she remembered the\r\ndangers to which he might be exposed, and the hazardous pursuit in which\r\nhe was engaged.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps Mr Champion may give Harry some of the books to read which he\r\ntook with him,\" observed Hannah.  \"I chose such as I thought most likely\r\nto interest him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear Harry is very little addicted to reading,\" answered Mrs\r\nGraybrook.\r\n\r\n\"Is there no one else on board likely to speak to Harry on religious\r\nsubjects, mother?  Are none of the other mates Christians?\" asked\r\nHannah, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"I fear not,\" said Mrs Graybrook.  \"There is, however, old Tom Hayes,\r\nwho has sailed for many years with your father, and has frequently been\r\nat our house.  I have at times heard him let drop expressions which\r\ninduced me to believe that he is a Christian man.  Your father has\r\nspoken of him as a Methodist, and observed that, though he did not think\r\nmuch of his opinions, he was the most sober and steady man he ever had\r\nwith him, and one of his best boat-steerers and harpooners.  I remember\r\nbeing struck by the old man's calm and intelligent countenance and his\r\ngentle and unassuming manners, which true and simple religious faith\r\ncould alone impart.  When we were last on board the ship he expressed\r\nhimself more openly to me than he had ever before done.  I spoke to him\r\nabout Harry, and he assured me that he would do his best to look after\r\nhim and keep him out of danger.  He was going to say more, when he was\r\ncalled away to attend to some duty, and I had no other opportunity of\r\nspeaking to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember the old sailor,\" said Hannah.  \"How I wish that I had\r\nthought of talking with him!  But I am afraid that Harry will not be\r\ninclined to listen to anything which a person whom he will look upon as\r\nhis inferior may say to him.  Still the old man may be able to speak to\r\nhim, and if he is, as you think, a true Christian, he will certainly\r\nendeavour to do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"After all, dear Hannah, while we rest assured that God will hear our\r\npetitions, we must remember that He knows best how to answer them,\"\r\nobserved Mrs Graybrook.  \"Confiding in His love, let our hearts be\r\ncomforted.\"\r\n\r\nMore than once the conversation of the mother and daughter had been\r\ninterrupted by the loud uproar of the storm, and Jane, their\r\nmaid-servant, who had been sitting by herself in the kitchen, came\r\nrunning in, exclaiming that she was afraid the whole house would be\r\nblown away.\r\n\r\n\"It has stood many a severer gale than this, Jane,\" answered her\r\nmistress.  \"But bring your work in here, as you are alarmed at being\r\nalone,\" she added, kindly.  \"We should be worse off if we were to run\r\nout into the garden.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl thankfully took advantage of Mrs Graybrook's permission to sit\r\nin the drawing-room; and her presence prevented the two ladies from\r\nspeaking further on the subject which occupied their thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe usual time for their evening prayers arrived.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Hannah, even while they were on their knees, that the gale\r\nblew with less fury than before.  It was, indeed, one of those storms\r\nwhich occasionally, during the equinox, sweep along the coast, and,\r\nthough brief, cause much damage to vessels caught near the shore,\r\nespecially to such as are ill-found and ill-manned.  So do the trials of\r\nlife wreck those persons destitute of sound faith and religious\r\nprinciple, while those who are resting on Jesus are carried through them\r\nand preserved.\r\n\r\nNext morning the wind had ceased, and the sun shone forth.\r\n\r\nHannah anxiously looked through the telescope in the direction she had\r\nseen the flashes of the guns.  There lay a large ship on the rocks, but\r\nher masts were standing, and boats were passing to and fro from the\r\nshore.  She was greatly relieved when she soon afterwards heard that,\r\nthough the ship had received much damage, no lives had been lost.\r\n\r\n\"I was wrong last night in giving way to my faithless fears and running\r\nthe risk of alarming you, my dear mother,\" she said, with a smile.  \"I\r\nfeel my heart happier this morning, and believe that God will protect\r\nthose we love, and that we shall yet see the _Steadfast_, with a full\r\ncargo, sailing back towards the Mersey, and, better still, that father\r\nand Harry\" (she could not bring herself to utter the name of Leonard\r\nChampion aloud) \"may have accepted the truth, and then--\" and she looked\r\nupwards--\"when we are called upon to part, we may know that we shall\r\nmeet together to enjoy the glorious happiness which our gracious Saviour\r\nhas prepared for all those who love Him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nWHALING IN THE PACIFIC.\r\n\r\nThe _Steadfast_, South Sea whaler, having doubled Cape Horn, was\r\ntraversing the broad waters of the Pacific.  Royals and studding-sails\r\nwere set to catch the light breeze which sent her gliding majestically\r\nalong over the calm ocean; her six whaleboats, with stem and stern\r\nalike, hung from the davits above her black sides.  A tropical sun shone\r\ndown on her deck, making the pitch hiss and bubble in the seams, and\r\ndriving all on deck whose duty did not compel them to keep elsewhere,\r\ninto such shade as the sails and bulwarks afforded.\r\n\r\nCaptain Graybrook, a fine-looking man, with an open, intelligent\r\nexpression of countenance, stood aft, sextant in hand, prepared to take\r\na meridional altitude.  Near him was his second mate, Leonard Champion,\r\nwith two boys, one of whom also held a sextant.\r\n\r\n\"You can now, Harry, take an observation as well as I can, and before\r\nlong, if you pay attention, you will become a good navigator,\" observed\r\nthe young mate.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for teaching me, Mr Champion; that's just my wish,\" answered\r\nHarry.\r\n\r\n\"Where there's a will there's a way; and you, Mr Bass,\" said the mate,\r\nturning to the other boy, \"ought to do as well as Harry by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dickey is fonder of skylarking than shooting the stars,\" remarked\r\nHarry, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Not fonder than you are, Harry,\" retorted Dickey Bass, who was the son\r\nof a former shipmate of Captain Graybrook, and brought by him to sea\r\nthrough regard for the boy's father.  \"I don't happen to understand sums\r\nas well as you do, and so I don't always get my day's work done as\r\ncorrectly as yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Always! why, if we were to go by your reckoning, Dickey, we should have\r\nbeen in the middle of the forests of South America, or on the top of the\r\nAndes, before now.  When did you ever make a right calculation?\" asked\r\nHarry, who delighted in bantering Dickey, though they were really great\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\"Why, for the last fortnight I don't suppose I have been more than eight\r\nor ten degrees out at the utmost.\"\r\n\r\nMr Champion and Harry laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Rather a serious error, Mr Bass.\"\r\n\r\n\"I meant minutes,\" said Dickey, \"or perhaps seconds; I always forget\r\nwhich is which.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Captain Graybrook lifted his instrument to his eye, and\r\nthe mate and Harry followed his example.\r\n\r\n\"The sun has dipped; make it noon,\" said the captain; and the ship's\r\nbell was struck.\r\n\r\nHaving written off their observations and quickly made their\r\ncalculations, the ship was found to be about seventeen degrees south of\r\nthe line, off the coast of Peru.\r\n\r\nLook-out men were sent aloft, for they were now approaching a part of\r\nthe ocean where whales were in those days likely to be found.  As they\r\nlooked over the side, many polypi, medusae, and squid were observed\r\nfloating on the surface; and occasionally a covey of flying-fish, rising\r\nfrom the water, darted rapidly over it, quickly again, as their\r\nbrilliant wings dried, to sink down and become the prey of their\r\nenemies, the dolphin or bonito.  A seaman had just hauled a bucket of\r\nwater on deck.  Within it was a gelatinous-looking mass.  The mate and\r\nhis young companions examined it.\r\n\r\n\"That is part of a squid,\" he observed, \"the whale's food.  Probably the\r\nremainder is down the monster's maw.  We shall sight a whale before the\r\nday is over, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so too,\" said Harry.  \"I long to see one killed and brought\r\nalongside.  We have had a dull time of it since we touched at\r\nValparaiso.  I thought we should have captured a dozen or more before\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will have to learn patience at sea, my boy,\" observed the mate.\r\n\"We have three years to remain out, and may consider ourselves fortunate\r\nif we get a full ship at the end of that time.\"\r\n\r\nThe sextants had been returned to their cases in the cabin, and Harry\r\nand his chum, Dickey Bass, finding it very hot, seated themselves in the\r\nshade by the side of a gun, of which the _Steadfast_ carried eight,\r\nbesides a good supply of muskets and cutlasses and other weapons; for,\r\nhaving to visit regions inhabited by fierce and savage tribes, she was\r\nwell armed.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Harry, what was old Tom talking to you about in your watch last\r\nnight, and what made you look so grave this morning?  I could not tell\r\nwhat had come over you,\" said Dickey Bass.\r\n\r\n\"He asked me whether I was prepared to die.  I thought it an odd\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think it was,\" said young Bass.  \"What did you say in return?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told him that I had not thought about it, and that, as I enjoyed\r\nlife, I had no intention of leaving it,\" answered Harry.  \"He then\r\nreminded me that I might fall overboard any day, or the ship might be\r\nlost with all hands, or the boat in which I happened to be might be\r\ncapsized, or I might die of fever, or be cut off by savages, or that I\r\nmight lose my life in a number of other ways.  He asked me, if any of\r\nthese disagreeable things were to happen, where I expected to go.  I\r\ntold him, of course, that I wished to go to heaven; and he then inquired\r\nwhat right I had to go there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think he had any right to ask you any such questions,\"\r\nobserved Harry's companion.  \"I should have told him to mind his own\r\nbusiness.  I do not like to be bothered by that sort of questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not answer him in that way,\" replied Harry, \"for he spoke very\r\nkindly.  He is, besides, an old man, and has been for a number of years\r\nwith my father, who thinks highly of him, for I have heard him say so.\r\nBesides, he has taken great pains to teach me seamanship, always tells\r\nme anything I ask him; and if it were not for him I should not know half\r\nas much as I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, I do not see why he should try to frighten you about dying, or\r\nask you where you expect to go if you do.  It looks as if he doubted\r\nthat you would go to heaven,\" said Dickey.\r\n\r\n\"He told me very distinctly that I had no claim whatever to go there,\r\nand that unless my sins were washed away, the Bible says that I should\r\nbe unfit to go there; that heaven is a pure and holy place, and that all\r\npeople are impure and unholy,\" said Harry, in a graver tone than usual.\r\n\r\n\"But I suppose he wants you to become religious, and read good books,\r\nand give up laughing and singing and being the capital jolly fellow you\r\nare now, Harry,\" interrupted Dickey Bass.  \"If I were you, I would not\r\nlisten to him; neither your father nor Mr Champion ever speaks to us in\r\nthat way.  Just forget all he said, and drive dull care away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already forgotten, I am afraid, a great deal that he said,\"\r\nanswered Harry; \"but he seemed, at all events, very much in earnest, and\r\nI cannot help remembering some of the things.  Besides, Mr Champion has\r\nlately spoken to me more seriously than he has ever done before; and\r\nonly last Sunday he gave me a book to read, and told me that he thought\r\nit would do me good.  As I found my sister Hannah's name in it, I\r\nsuppose she asked him to give it to me, and that he had forgotten to do\r\nso till then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw you with one in your hand.  Did you read it?\" asked young Bass.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed very dry, and I fell asleep over it, so that I cannot say I\r\nknow much about it,\" answered Harry.\r\n\r\n\"The best thing you could have done,\" remarked Dickey.  \"Whatever you\r\ndo, Harry, don't turn Methodist.  I cannot say that I admire old Tom,\r\nand do not want you to become like him.  To my mind he is a dull, stiff\r\nold fellow, with a very good opinion of himself, and I have never felt\r\ninclined to be intimate with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not at first; but he seemed so anxious to help me, and to put me\r\nup to all sorts of things, that I could not help liking him, though I\r\nown that I would rather he did not talk to me about religion.  The next\r\ntime he does so I shall try to get him to change the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you must,\" said Dickey Bass.  \"It's all very well for parsons\r\nand ministers, but an old boat-steerer has no business to trouble one\r\nwith such things.  Why, I only yesterday heard him lecturing Rob Burton\r\nthere, the merriest, happiest fellow in the ship;\" and he pointed to a\r\nfine, active-looking young seaman at work on the other side of the deck.\r\n\"I have a notion that he was talking to him about his soul and death,\r\nas if he was not likely to live as long as any one on board, and longer\r\ntoo than most of the old hands.  Why should he put melancholy thoughts\r\ninto his head, and take the pluck out of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he thought Rob Burton careless about religious matters, and\r\nwanted to get him to read his good books and tracts,\" observed Harry.\r\n\"Old Tom means well, at all events.\"\r\n\r\n\"He may mean well, but for my part I don't like those well-meaning\r\nfellows,\" answered Dickey.  \"If I catch him lecturing you I will join\r\nin, and we will soon put a stop to his preaching.\"\r\n\r\nThe thoughtless lads talked on for some time in the same strain, till\r\nany good effect which the conversation Tom Hayes had held with Harry\r\nmight have produced on him was completely eradicated.\r\n\r\nThey were interrupted by a startling cry from the masthead, so welcome\r\nto a whaler's ears, of \"There she spouts!\" and in a moment the crew,\r\nhitherto so lethargic, were aroused into action.  Some flew to the\r\nfalls, to lower a couple of boats, others sprang up the shrouds, to\r\nobserve the position of the whale; and soon afterwards the boats, of\r\nwhich the first and second mates had the command, shoved off from the\r\nship's side.  Another cry came of \"There again!\" indicating that the\r\nwhale had once more come to the surface, and was spouting.  The monster\r\nwas at no great distance.  Mr Gibson, the first mate, took the lead,\r\npulling the bow oar of his boat, that he might be ready to strike the\r\nharpoon into the animal as soon as it was reached.\r\n\r\nHarry and his friend were in the rigging watching the proceedings.\r\n\r\nQuitting his oar, the mate stood up, harpoon in hand; it flew from his\r\ngrasp just in time to strike the monster, which was about to \"sound,\" or\r\ndive.  The line attached to the weapon led aft to a tub, in which it lay\r\ncoiled at the bottom of the boat.  The mate, who acted as boat-steerer,\r\nnow came to his proper place in the stern, where he guided the boat by\r\nan oar passed through a ring called a grummet, while the headsman, who\r\nhad before been steering, took his place in the bow, armed with several\r\nlances, ready to plunge into the body of the whale the instant it again\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nAfter some minutes, up came the monster, lying somewhat exhausted with\r\nits exertions to escape and the effects of the harpoon in its body.  The\r\nboat pulling close up to it, the headsman thrust first one lance and\r\nthen another into its body, near the fin, shouting as he did so, \"Stern\r\nall.\"  Instantly the boat backed away as fast as the crew could use\r\ntheir oars, only just in time to avoid the violent movements of the\r\nmonster, which now reared its tail, lashing the water into foam, and,\r\nlifting its enormous head, threatened destruction to its assailants with\r\nits formidable jaws.  Suddenly its movements ceased, and the\r\nboat-steerers, believing that its last struggles were over, and eager to\r\nsecure their victim, urged their men to give way towards it.\r\n\r\nThe first mate's boat still took the lead, and approached with less\r\ncaution than usual.  The apparently vanquished monster, as it saw her,\r\nwithout a moment's warning whirled round its enormous tail, which,\r\nstriking her, sent the boat flying into the air, scattering her crew on\r\neither side in the blood-stained water, when it rushed forward with open\r\nmouth to attack Mr Champion's boat.  He narrowly avoided the fierce\r\nassault, and then boldly steered to the assistance of his shipmates, who\r\nwere struggling for their lives.  Once more the whale turned, dragging\r\nthe boat after it, swimming directly through the midst of the men in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe accident had been clearly seen from the ship.  Several had been\r\npicked up.  Mr Champion then steered towards the whale, which was in\r\nits death struggle a short distance off.  Another boat had been lowered\r\nto go to his assistance, under the command of Tom Hayes.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, the first mate's boat having been righted, all three\r\nwere seen returning.\r\n\r\n\"Any one hurt, Mr Gibson?\" inquired the captain, as the whale was\r\nbrought alongside.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to say, sir, that Rob Burton has gone,\" was the answer.  \"Either\r\nthe whale or the boat struck him, and he went down like a shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Rob Burton!\" exclaimed several voices.  \"The gayest and\r\nbest-hearted fellow aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dickey, you said he was likely to live as long as any of us,\" remarked\r\nHarry, very much shocked.  \"I wonder whether he listened to what old Tom\r\nsaid to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not a subject I like to think about,\" answered Dickey.  \"I wish it\r\nhad not happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I.  But our wishes cannot bring poor Burton to life again,\"\r\nobserved Harry.  \"I cannot help thinking that old Tom must be right; and\r\nwhen he speaks to me I think I ought to listen to what he says.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Harry, don't let this thing make you turn Methodist!\" exclaimed\r\nBass, after a silence of some minutes.  \"It is very shocking, of course;\r\nbut that's no reason why we should mope and grow serious, and fancy that\r\nthe same is going to happen to us.  I don't feel quite comfortable\r\nmyself, I own; but we shall get over it in a few days, and all hands\r\nwill be as merry as ever.\"\r\n\r\nSuch, indeed, was the case.  Poor Burton's clothes were put up to\r\nauction and disposed of among the crew, and his name was seldom or never\r\nmentioned afterwards.  Too often the same thing happens on board ship\r\nwhen a seaman is lost, much as his shipmates may mourn for him at the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOld Tom did not, however, fail to speak to Harry about Burton.\r\n\r\n\"I was talking to him on the state of his soul only just two or three\r\ndays before he had to go and stand in the presence of his Maker, and\r\ngive an account of the deeds done in the body,\" said the old man.  \"I\r\nasked him whether he knew that it was washed in the blood of the\r\nSaviour, or whether he had his sins still clinging to him.  He did not\r\nknow, poor lad, that his soul needed cleansing; and when I said that it\r\nwas vile and foul, and loaded with sin, and that unless it was washed he\r\ncould not enter heaven and stand before the all-righteous Judge, he\r\nasked me how that was to be done.  So I told him the way God has\r\nappointed--the only way by which it could be done--through faith in the\r\nblood of the risen Saviour shed for us on Calvary.  And I tell you,\r\nHarry, that it gives me great joy to think that his answer was, `I do\r\nbelieve Jesus died for me.  May God in His mercy help my unbelief.'  I\r\ntold him to pray, and that he might be sure God would answer his prayer.\r\nHe said he would that very night; and next morning he told me that he\r\nhad prayed, and that he felt happier than he had ever done before.  I\r\nhad not another word with him after that; but I only wish that you and\r\nevery one in the ship were like Rob Burton.  I know little more about\r\nhim than what I have told you, but that is enough to give me comfort;\r\nand if I ever get home and can visit his mother, it will give her\r\ncomfort too, for she is a Christian woman, and had taught him to pray,\r\nand had never ceased praying for him, he said.  Of that he was sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then do you think he has gone to heaven?\" asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered old Tom; \"for God has promised that He will receive all\r\nwho trust in Jesus.  Whatever are their sins, He will put them as far\r\nfrom Him as the east is from the west; that though they be red like\r\nscarlet, they shall become white as wool.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish that I understood these things better than I do,\" said Harry,\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n\"You have your Bible, Harry; read that, with prayer for grace to\r\nunderstand it.\"\r\n\r\nHarry said he would try and find time; and he actually took out a small\r\nBible which his mother had put into his chest, and carried it in his\r\npocket; but he did not like reading it when Dickey was looking on, and\r\nsomehow or other never found the time he expected.\r\n\r\nDickey tried his best to do away with the impression old Tom had made on\r\nHarry's mind; and the thoughtless boys soon, like the rest of the crew,\r\nforgot the fate of poor Burton.  All hands were, indeed, kept actively\r\nemployed.  Numerous whales appeared, several of which were captured, and\r\nnight after night the crew were engaged in \"cutting in\" and \"trying\r\nout\"--that is, cutting the blubber off the body of the animal and\r\nboiling it in huge cauldrons on deck.  The bright glare falling on the\r\nmasts and rigging, and the sturdy frames of the sailors, as they stirred\r\nup the cauldrons, placed on tripods, with their forks, gave them the\r\nwildest and most savage appearance.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think my mother and sister would recognise the ship if they\r\nwere to see us now,\" observed Harry to his companion, as they stood aft,\r\nready to cast off the carcase of a whale which had been stripped of its\r\nblubber, and had an opportunity of observing the scene going on beyond\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"They would think we were a set of spirits from the lower world busy\r\nover some diabolical work, I suspect,\" said Dickey.\r\n\r\nThe business was not exactly pleasant, but as there was no disagreeable\r\nsmell, Harry did not mind it; and even Mr Champion, whom he looked upon\r\nas very refined, was so accustomed to the work that he took it as a\r\nmatter of course.\r\n\r\nAfter the oil was thus extracted, it was ladled into casks, which were\r\nstowed below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nADVENTURE WITH SEA-LIONS.\r\n\r\nThe _Steadfast_ had made so successful a commencement of her voyage that\r\nall hands hoped she would get full much sooner than many had expected,\r\nand be able to return home.  The whales, however, having disappeared\r\nfrom the fishing-ground where she had been engaged, she was about to\r\nproceed to the western part of the Pacific, when a mass of rugged rocks\r\nwas sighted out of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"An awkward spot to run against on a dark night,\" observed Harry, as\r\nthey approached them.  \"Hark! what is that strange roaring noise?  I\r\ncould fancy that a thousand lions or more were assembled together\r\nholding a concert.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are sea-lions, Master Harry,\" observed old Tom; \"the whole rock is\r\ncovered with them and their cubs.  If we could manage to get hold of\r\nsome of them, we should find their skins very useful.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Graybrook was of this opinion, and as the wind was light and\r\nthere was no dangerous current running, the ship was hove to, and he\r\nordered two of the boats to be got ready to capture some of the\r\nsea-lions, the ordinary species of seal found in the southern seas.  Mr\r\nChampion took command of one boat and old Tom of the other, and the boys\r\ngot leave to accompany the second mate.\r\n\r\nThey pulled away towards the rocks.  As a heavy surf broke on the rocks,\r\nrushing up some distance with great force and then back again, which\r\nwould have dashed the boats to pieces, had they got within its\r\ninfluence, they were compelled to pull a considerable distance round\r\nbefore a spot was found on which a landing could be effected with any\r\ndegree of safety.  Even there, those who were to land had to watch for\r\nan opportunity, as the boat was sent forward on the crest of a breaker,\r\nto leap out and spring up the rocks, while the boats, with a couple of\r\nhands in each, were pulled back again out of danger.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the party scrambled up the rocks than the seals, alarmed\r\nat their approach, made towards the water, rushing down impetuously, and\r\nworking themselves along by means of their fins--their heads and manes\r\ngiving them the appearance of lions.  Their threatening aspect, and the\r\nloud roars they uttered, were enough to daunt any one not accustomed to\r\nencounter them.\r\n\r\n\"I wish that I had remained on board,\" cried Dickey.  \"See, here comes a\r\nfellow; he will knock us over to a certainty.  What shall we do?\"\r\n\r\nThe men, however, had brought heavy clubs, with which they struck right\r\nand left as the monsters, with glistening fangs, rushed down on them,\r\nsnapping their jaws, powerful enough to bite off a limb in an instant.\r\nThe position of the party was dangerous in the extreme as the monsters\r\ncame rolling and sliding down the rocks.  To avoid them, the men were\r\ncompelled to climb over the bodies of those which had been stunned; but\r\nstill more met them, and Harry would have been knocked over by a big\r\nseal, and probably carried into the sea, had not Mr Champion, close to\r\nwhom he kept, struck the creature on the head and dragged Harry out of\r\nthe way.  Old Tom saved Dickey in the same way.\r\n\r\nThough most of the seals which had not been killed had made their\r\nescape, a few remained on the higher ground, among which was an enormous\r\nmale seal.  The monster seemed determined to give battle to his\r\nassailants, and came down the rocks towards them shaking his mane and\r\nextending wide his jaws armed with sharp tusks.  Old Tom, who boldly\r\nwent forward to meet the creature, inflicted a tremendous blow with his\r\nclub on its head, but without stopping its career.  Wishing to secure\r\nit, he took a harpoon which one of the men, by his orders, had carried\r\nwith a line attached to it, and plunged it into the animal, trying to\r\nmake fast the line to a jutting point of rock.  The seal, however,\r\nrendered only more furious from its wounds, rushed into the midst of the\r\nparty, dragging the rope, which, as Mr Champion sprang forward to meet\r\nit, became entangled around his leg.  Before any one could rescue him,\r\nhe was carried away into the midst of the wild surf dashing up against\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nA cry of horror and dismay rose from all the party as they saw the young\r\nmate buried beneath the waves.  Old Tom and several of the men sprang\r\nforward in a vain attempt to seize him, and were nearly swept away.\r\n\r\nThe boats were at too great a distance to render assistance.  The next\r\ninstant Leonard Champion was seen struggling amid the curing crest of a\r\nbreaker; but, alas! much too far off to be reached.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he is gone! he is gone!\" cried Harry, wringing his hands.\r\n\r\nLittle did he think of the agony his gentle sister would have suffered\r\ncould she have witnessed the scene.  Happily, those at home are not\r\naware of the dangers to which their loved ones are exposed till they are\r\nover.  When ending fatally there comes, it is true, the unavoidable\r\nsorrow; but even that does not equal the intense suffering of mind which\r\nis endured when the peril is witnessed and no help can be sent.\r\n\r\nAgain the young mate disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"There, there he is!\" cried Harry, as he was seen struggling on the\r\nsnowy summit of an enormous roller.\r\n\r\nOnward he was borne.  His shipmates, clasping each other's hands, formed\r\na line, the strongest bravely dashing in towards him.  He was already\r\nalmost senseless; one outstretched hand was seized.  Exerting all their\r\nstrength, the men worked their way up the rock, and then, two of them\r\nclasping him in their arms, he was borne in triumph out of the power of\r\nthe greedy waves.  Harry threw himself down by his side overcome by his\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\n\"You are safe, Mr Champion!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for it!\" answered the young man, pressing Harry's hand; but\r\nhe could say no more.\r\n\r\nThe task of embarking was a hazardous one.  The mate was first placed in\r\nhis boat, when the seal-skins, which had been quickly stripped off, were\r\nthrown on board; and, thankful to escape from the treacherous rocks, the\r\nparty returned to the ship.\r\n\r\nLeonard Champion was for several days confined to his cabin.  He thought\r\nmuch, and he was constantly reading.  Harry recognised the books which\r\nhad been his sister's.  \"You must find them very interesting, Mr\r\nChampion,\" he observed.\r\n\r\n\"I wish that I had begun reading them sooner, Harry,\" was the answer.\r\n\"I feel that I have been rescued from the jaws of death through God's\r\nmercy; and how unprepared I was to die.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I hope you will not be exposed to the same danger again, Mr\r\nChampion.\"\r\n\r\n\"I pray not, for it was terrible--I can scarcely make you understand how\r\nterrible.  I cannot help seeing that I should be indeed ungrateful if I\r\ndid not acknowledge the loving mercy of God, who preserved my life, and\r\nendeavour from henceforth to serve Him faithfully, instead, as I have\r\nhitherto done, of rebelling against Him.  Yet I am sure that we should\r\naccept the offers of God, and serve Him from love and gratitude, and not\r\nfrom fear of death; I do not mean simply the death of the body, but\r\neternal death--the doom of all who die unreconciled, and therefore at\r\nenmity with God.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that what Hannah's books say?\" inquired Harry, in perfect sincerity.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and much more.  You would have found what I now say in the book I\r\nlent you,\" observed the mate.\r\n\r\n\"I have not yet read it, but I will try and do so,\" said Harry; \"still,\r\nexcept on a Sunday, I have not much time, as you know, and the book\r\nappeared to me very dull.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not surprised at that, for I thought it so myself, though I read\r\nit.  But now, Harry, that I have had time for reflection, and feel how\r\nnearly I was lost, I see its value,\" said Mr Champion.  \"Let me ask you\r\nto read it, Harry, even although you do find it dull.\"\r\n\r\nHarry promised that he would, and fully intended to read it.\r\n\r\nCaptain Graybrook observed the change which had come over his mate, but\r\nhe forbore to ask him questions; he could scarcely suppose, however,\r\nthat a peril to which seamen are so constantly exposed should have\r\nproduced the change.\r\n\r\n\"I thought Mr Champion was as brave as any fellow in the ship,\"\r\nobserved Dickey Bass to Harry.  \"It seems to me that he must have been\r\nin a terrible fright, being carried off by the seal, or he would not\r\nlook so grave and down-hearted as he seems.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it was fear, for I am very sure he is as brave as any man\r\nalive,\" answered Harry; but he made no other remark, for of late he had\r\nbecome less willing than formerly to talk to Bass on such a subject,\r\nsuspecting as he did the real cause of the change which his young\r\nshipmate had observed in the second mate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nA NIGHT ADVENTURE.\r\n\r\nThe _Steadfast_ now steered westward across the Pacific.  Leonard\r\nChampion was indeed much changed.  He no longer took pleasure in the\r\nlight reading and frivolous conversation in which he had previously\r\nindulged.  He knew that he was a sinner, and he believed that Jesus\r\nChrist died to save sinners; but he had not discovered that by simple\r\nfaith in the all-sufficient atonement of the Saviour's precious blood\r\nshed on Calvary, his sins were already washed away, and that he might\r\nlive rejoicing in the love of God, and go to Him as a child goes to an\r\naffectionate parent, with the certainty of obtaining all he asks for, if\r\nit is for his good.\r\n\r\nLeonard, however, took every opportunity of talking to Harry.  Harry\r\nlistened respectfully; but he thought that the mate was ill and out of\r\nspirits, and he did not feel, therefore, that he need be much influenced\r\nby what was said.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks passed, and once more the cheering cry of \"There she\r\nspouts!\" was heard, and several whales were captured.\r\n\r\nThe ship was in sight of a rocky island.  Three of the boats had already\r\ngone away in pursuit of a whale in an opposite direction from the\r\nisland, the captain himself being in one of them, when another was seen\r\nspouting towards the land.  The boat of which old Tom had charge was\r\nimmediately lowered.  Harry and Dickey, who had long been eager to go in\r\nchase of a whale, slipped down just as she was shoving off.  The first\r\nmate, who remained in charge of the ship, hailed them to come back.\r\n\r\n\"The captain promised to let us go some day, and we could not have a\r\nbetter opportunity,\" shouted Bass.\r\n\r\nThe mate, understanding that the captain had given them leave, told them\r\nthat they might go; and old Tom, who had been busy arranging his\r\nharpoons, was under the same impression.\r\n\r\nThe crew giving way, the boat was soon at a distance from the ship.\r\nBefore she got up to the whale, the monster had sounded; but from the\r\ndirection it had taken old Tom felt certain that it would rise again\r\nstill nearer the island.  The boat accordingly pulled on.  He was not\r\nmistaken, but the whale was still some way off.  Once more the men bent\r\nto their oars.  The monster, unconscious of danger, was still above\r\nwater.  As the boat drew near, old Tom was standing up in the bow,\r\nharpoon in hand, ready to plunge it into the whale's side.  Its flukes\r\nwere just going up as, with unerring aim, he darted his weapon, which\r\nsunk deep into its side.  With rapid strokes the boat was backed away,\r\nand old Tom returned aft to manage the line, now running rapidly out as\r\nthe whale sounded.  The second line was got ready and made fast to the\r\nfirst, that had almost run out before it began to slacken, as the whale\r\nreturned to the surface.  The crew were hauling it in when the monster\r\nappeared.  They had just time to make it fast round the bollard, when\r\nthe whale darted off, towing the boat at a rapid rate towards the\r\nisland.  It seemed in no way disposed to slacken its speed; but old Tom\r\nknew that if the harpoon held they would at length come up with it.\r\n\r\nThe ship had in the meantime been standing after the other boats, and\r\nwas now almost hull down; still, as the island would mark their\r\nposition, they had little fear of not being picked up after the other\r\nwhales were captured.\r\n\r\nThe sun was by this time near the horizon, and the wind had increased\r\nconsiderably since they left the ship, but, as it blew off the shore,\r\nthe sea was tolerably smooth.\r\n\r\nAt length the monster, growing weary, slackened its speed, and the line\r\nwas hauled in.  The boat had got nearly up to it when it again sounded,\r\nbut only for a short time.  On its return to the surface, old Tom was\r\nable to plunge several lances into its body, and then, the boat backing\r\naway from it, after it had struggled and lashed the water with its tail\r\nfor a few minutes, it turned over on its side, and a shout proclaimed\r\nthat the crew were victors.  They now prepared to tow their prize\r\ntowards the ship; but darkness had come on, and when they looked out for\r\nher she was nowhere to be seen.  Still, as they knew the direction in\r\nwhich she was to be found, they hoped to get alongside before midnight,\r\nand bending lustily to their oars, pulled away.  They had not gone far\r\nbefore they had to meet the wind, which had hitherto come off the shore,\r\nand was in their favour; and the sea rising rapidly, they made but slow\r\nway with the whale in tow.  No sound was heard but the roaring of the\r\nsurf on the rocky island and the breaking of the sea-caps, which ever\r\nand anon leaped on board.  Harry and Dickey heartily wished themselves\r\nsafe on board again, while old Tom, as he stood up steering with his\r\noar, looked out anxiously ahead, in the hope of seeing a light from the\r\nship.  The sea-caps, however, came tumbling on board faster than ever.\r\n\r\n\"There is work for you, boys,\" he observed.  \"We must get rid of some of\r\nthis water, or else we shall have more than enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys turned to and bailed with might and main; but their efforts\r\nwere not sufficient, and one of the men was obliged to assist them.\r\n\r\n\"There is the light, lads!\" cried old Tom; \"but it's a long way off,\" he\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\nFar away, just above the breaking seas ahead, could be seen the glare of\r\na blue light; it seemed to come out of the water, and showed that the\r\nship was indeed a long way off.\r\n\r\n\"We shall not get alongside with the whale to-night,\" observed old Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Neither with it nor without it,\" answered one of the men.\r\n\r\n\"It will be lucky if we get anywhere,\" said another.\r\n\r\nThe sea had now risen still more than at first, and dark heavy masses\r\ncrested with foam came rolling on towards the boat.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to hang on to the whale, and wait till the ship stood\r\ntowards them.  The boat was made fast under the lee of the monster's\r\nbody, which served somewhat to break the force of the seas.\r\n\r\nAgain a pale blue light was seen, but it was evidently only the upper\r\nrays, showing that the ship was hull down.  The captain might not dare\r\nto venture so near a rocky coast, off which unknown reefs might lie hid,\r\neven to save their lives.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the body of the whale scarcely afforded them shelter,\r\nand the seas, rolling over it, broke on board.  The crew cried out that\r\nthey should be swamped, and proposed pulling for the island and landing\r\non the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have a chance of saving our lives, and it will be better than\r\nbeing swamped out here!\" exclaimed the man who had first spoken.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have but a poor chance if we attempt to land on the rocks, I\r\ntell you that, lads,\" said old Tom.  \"I would rather keep hold of the\r\nwhale.\"\r\n\r\nStill the men declared that they would, at all events, rather chance it.\r\n\r\nJust as they were speaking, the clouds to windward appeared to open, and\r\na bright light darted from the sky.  This decided old Tom, for he knew\r\nthat it was the sign of a still further increase of wind.\r\n\r\n\"I hope we shall not have to run on the rocks,\" he said; \"just, however,\r\nas we made fast to the whale, I observed an opening in the surf.  It was\r\na very narrow one, though.  If we can find it we will attempt to run\r\nthrough, for there is sure to be a harbour inside, and we have no other\r\nhope of saving our lives that I can see.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat was accordingly cast off from the whale, and her head being\r\nkept to the seas, to prevent her from being swamped, the crew exerted\r\nall their strength to gain the land.  Ahead appeared a long line of\r\nroaring, foaming breakers, with a rocky shore beyond, and the dim\r\noutline of the dark hills farther on.  For an hour or more they pulled\r\non, but no opening in the mass of foaming breakers could be discerned.\r\nThey were beginning to despair, when old Tom said that he could see the\r\nplace he was in search of, for he had remarked the peculiar shape of the\r\nhills at that spot.  He accordingly steered in for the shore.  Harry and\r\nDickey, however, could see nothing but the threatening breakers.\r\n\r\n\"It's very awful!\" observed Dickey to his companion.  \"I wish I was\r\nprepared to die.  It's bad enough now, and if the boat once gets caught\r\nin those breakers it will be all over with us.  Harry, can you say any\r\nprayers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am trying to do so,\" said Harry, who saw the danger as well as\r\nDickey.\r\n\r\nOld Tom was too much occupied to make any remark.  He kept his eye\r\nsteadily fixed on a dark patch of water which appeared in the white line\r\nof foam, and he steered towards it.  The roaring sound of the surf as it\r\ndashed against the wild rocks grew louder and louder.  Still old Tom\r\nurged the men to pull as hard as they could.  Many of them thought,\r\nhowever, that they were only pulling to meet destruction the sooner.\r\n\r\n\"I see the passage now!\" exclaimed Harry, as he looked up for a moment\r\nwhile bailing the water out.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, lad,\" said old Tom.  \"Steady, lads! there is One above\r\nwho will protect us.  We will do our best, and trust to Him.\"\r\n\r\nThe men gave way.  They knew well that in a few minutes more they should\r\nbe safe, or struggling helplessly among the foaming waters.  The loud\r\nroar of the breakers sounded in their ears.  They bent to their oars;\r\nthe boys bailed as hard as they could.  Old Tom kept his eye ahead.  A\r\nhuge wave lifted up the boat, and seemed about to heave her into the\r\nmidst of the boiling surf.  Onwards she was borne; now she was between\r\ntwo walls of white hissing foam, which flew in thick masses over her;\r\nbut still she went on, and, gliding downwards with the rapidity of an\r\narrow, in a few seconds she shot into smooth water, leaving the dark\r\nrocks and the roaring breakers astern.  The wind blew fiercely, the\r\nthunder roared, and the lightning flashed vividly; but she was now safe\r\nwithin the shelter of a deep bay.  By the glare of the lightning it\r\ncould be seen that there were cliffs on either side.  The crew pulled\r\nsteadily up the centre till they reached a sandy beach at the farther\r\nend, where they landed, and hauled their boat up.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, let us return thanks to God for preserving us from the\r\ngreatest danger I have ever been in, or any of you either, probably,\"\r\nsaid old Tom.  \"If we had not been guided into the passage when we were,\r\nit is my belief that the boat would in a few minutes have gone to the\r\nbottom, for the gale is blowing nearly twice as hard as it did when we\r\ncast off from the whale.\"\r\n\r\nThough most of the men had refused to join with old Tom in prayer on\r\nboard ship when in safety, no one now declined to do as he suggested;\r\nand, led by him, they knelt down on the sands, and offered up\r\nthanksgivings for their preservation from the danger in which they had\r\nbeen placed.  Even Dickey Bass uttered a fervent \"Amen,\" and Harry felt\r\nthat God had indeed been merciful to him.\r\n\r\n\"Where should we have been now, Bass, if we had missed the passage?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Dickey; \"but I am very thankful that we are\r\nsafe.\"\r\n\r\nIt was too dark to enable them to go in search of shelter, if shelter\r\nwas to be found; so they stretched the boat's sail out from her side,\r\nand formed a low tent, beneath which they lay down to shelter themselves\r\nfrom the storm till the return of daylight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nON THE DESERT ISLAND.\r\n\r\nThe storm raged furiously all night, the thunder roared, the lightning,\r\ndarting forth from the dark sky, flashed ever and anon, in a zigzag\r\ncourse, from side to side of the cliffs around the bay, and the howling\r\nwind threatened frequently to tear off the sail and carry it away.\r\nStill the weary seamen slept, although Harry and young Bass did not for\r\na long time close their eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I feel, Harry, that old Tom is right; and next time he speaks to me I\r\nwill listen to him,\" said the latter.  \"He was as cool and collected\r\nfrom the beginning of the storm as if there had been no danger.  If it\r\nhad not been for him, I do not think we should have been where we are.\"\r\n\r\nHarry agreed with his companion, and urged him not to forget his good\r\nresolutions should they ever again get on board the ship.  What had\r\nbecome of her they could not tell, and they felt very anxious about her\r\nfate.  She might have been cast on some of the numerous reefs which lay\r\nthereabouts, or have been driven far away from the island.\r\n\r\n\"At all events, the captain will probably suppose that the boat is lost,\r\nand not think it worth while to come and look for us,\" observed Dickey.\r\n\r\n\"I am very sure my father won't give us up, if he thinks there is a\r\nchance of finding us,\" answered Harry.\r\n\r\n\"But what if the ship is lost?\" said Dickey, thoughtlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! do not talk of anything so dreadful!\" exclaimed Harry; \"I could not\r\nbear to think that we are not again to see my father and Mr Champion\r\nand the rest.  My father is a good seaman, and our ship is stout enough\r\nto weather out the worst gale that ever raged.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" said Dickey, in a mournful voice; \"but it blows a regular\r\nhurricane; and, oh! what a fearful crash of thunder that last was!  See,\r\nsee!  The lightning seems to stir up the very water of the harbour; and\r\noh! there is another peal!  I cannot help feeling as if the sky itself\r\nwas coming down upon us.\"\r\n\r\nThe last peal was succeeded by a loud rending and crashing sound, as if\r\na number of trees had been torn up by their roots or the stout branches\r\nwrenched off from the stems.\r\n\r\n\"Lie down, boys, and try and get some sleep.\"  It was old Tom who spoke.\r\nThey were not aware that he was awake and overheard them.  \"God will\r\ntake care of us, for we can do nothing more to take care of ourselves.\r\nWe are safer here than we should be farther inland among the trees.\"\r\n\r\nIt was some time, however, before they followed his advice.  At length\r\nthere was a lull, and they both lay down.  Scarcely had they placed\r\ntheir heads on the ground, than they were lost in forgetfulness, and\r\ntook no more notice of the storm than the seamen who had slept through\r\nit all.\r\n\r\nWhen morning dawned all hands awakened.  The fury of the gale was over.\r\nThe sun arose, and, bursting through the clouds, his rays soon dried\r\ntheir damp clothing.\r\n\r\nThe ground rose slightly from the head of the bay, and on the lower\r\nportion grew a grove of cocoa-nut trees loaded with fruit.  One of the\r\nmen, by means of a belt round his waist and the trunk, soon managed to\r\nclimb to the top of one of them, when he threw down a number of nuts,\r\nwhich were eagerly seized by the rest.  The outer husks were quickly\r\ntorn off, and a nut was given to Harry, the eye being pierced.  He\r\ndeclared that he had never tasted so delicious a draught of milk.  The\r\nmeat served the party for food, but did not satisfy their hunger, as\r\nthey had eaten nothing since leaving the ship.\r\n\r\n\"This is better than nothing, but it won't keep body and soul together,\"\r\nsaid one of the men, in a grumbling tone.\r\n\r\n\"Lad, we should be thankful that God has sent us where we can find such\r\nwholesome food, instead of complaining that we have not better,\" said\r\nold Tom.  \"Maybe, too, there are shell-fish and crabs to be got, and\r\nperhaps other food besides; and see, there is a rill of fresh water.  We\r\nshould be thankful for that.  We have an axe and our knives, and if we\r\nare obliged to live here we may build ourselves a hut, though we need\r\nnot think about that, as I hope the ship has escaped and will come to\r\nlook for us before long.\"\r\n\r\nStill the men grumbled.  They were all out of spirits, and had made up\r\ntheir minds that the ship was lost.  They had begun to wander about, as\r\nsailors generally do under such circumstances, one in one direction and\r\none in another, when Harry, who had gone to the boat, exclaimed, \"See,\r\nhere are some fishing-lines.  Who put them there I do not know, but we\r\nshall not be in want of a dinner if we make use of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a godsend,\" observed Dickey.\r\n\r\n\"Everything good is sent by God,\" said old Tom; and he called to the men\r\nto come and assist him in launching the boat.\r\n\r\nA short search along the shore enabled them to find mussels and other\r\nshell-fish, which they hoped would serve for bait; and, shoving off,\r\nthey went down towards the mouth of the harbour, where they quickly\r\ncaught as many fine fish as they could eat.  Returning to the beach,\r\nsticks were collected, and a tinder-box, which was in the tub with other\r\narticles always carried in a whale-boat, enabled them to light a fire.\r\n\r\nAn ample meal raised their spirits.  They once more embarked and pulled\r\ndown to the mouth of the harbour, in the hope of seeing the ship\r\nstanding towards the island.  The heavy surf which rolled in, however,\r\nmade it impossible for them to get out.  Old Tom and the two boys,\r\ntherefore, landed and climbed to the summit of a high cliff overlooking\r\nthe ocean.  Hence they gazed round in every direction, but no ship was\r\nin sight.  In the far distance they could discern here and there some\r\ndark rocks, over which the sea broke in masses of foam.  Harry's heart\r\nsank within him as he thought that possibly the _Steadfast_ might have\r\nbeen driven upon those fearful rocks, when, as he knew too well, she\r\nmust speedily have gone to pieces without a chance of any one on board\r\nescaping.  He scarcely liked to ask Tom Hayes what he thought, but he\r\nobserved that the old man looked unusually grave as his eye turned in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\n\"This is no place for us to build our hut on, though it is the best spot\r\nfor a look-out,\" observed old Tom, as he surveyed the rough broken\r\nground all around them.  \"We must take it by turns, however, to spend\r\nthe day here, though it will be best to take up our quarters near where\r\nwe first landed.\"\r\n\r\nThey waited for some time watching the dark, heaving sea, which still\r\nrolled and tumbled in huge billows before them; but not even a speck\r\nwhich might be the topsails of the _Steadfast_ appeared above the\r\nhorizon.  At length they returned to the boat.\r\n\r\nThe men had, in the meantime, caught a large supply of fish, and, in\r\nbetter spirits than before, they pulled back to the head of the bay.\r\n\r\nOld Tom advised that they should put up some shelter for the night; and\r\nwhile one of the men cooked the fish, the remainder cut down some young\r\ntrees and a quantity of boughs, with which they formed a tolerably\r\nsubstantial arbour, while some dried leaves and smaller boughs supplied\r\nthem with as good beds as they required.\r\n\r\n\"If we had a good stock of grog, and some bread and potatoes, we should\r\nbe as happy as princes,\" observed one of the men.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Ned,\" said another.  \"For my part, I do not care how\r\nlong we stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"What if there should be savages on the island!  Most of them are\r\ncannibals in these parts, I have heard say; and, as we have no arms to\r\ndefend ourselves, we should look foolish,\" remarked a third.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen no signs of any natives, so I do not think we should make\r\nourselves unhappy about them,\" said old Tom.  \"If there are any we must\r\nmake friends with them, and it's more than likely that they will give us\r\nhelp and show us where we can obtain food.\"\r\n\r\nThus old Tom did his utmost to keep up the spirits of the men, and to\r\nprevent them from falling into despondency.  Harry, however, could not\r\nhelp feeling sad as he thought of the possible loss of the ship.  He\r\neagerly set off the next morning to look out for her, and while two of\r\nthe men who pulled the boat remained fishing below he and Dickey climbed\r\nthe cliff.  The gale had considerably abated, but the ocean still\r\nswelled and broke with the effects of the gale.  They returned with an\r\nunsatisfactory report.\r\n\r\nThe men who had remained in the camp had, in the meantime, been looking\r\nout for traces of natives.  None had been discovered.  They had also\r\nbegun to build a hut.  As they had only one axe, this was a slow\r\nprocess.  They had cut out a couple of rude spades with which to dig the\r\nholes for the foundation, and, as all hands worked hard, by the close of\r\nthe day they had made some progress.  The cocoa-nut fibre, twisted into\r\nrope, enabled them to bind the rafters together, and the long leaves of\r\nsome palms, which grew farther inland, served for thatch.  Old Tom\r\nencouraged them to proceed, though he had lost all hopes that the ship\r\nwould return.\r\n\r\nAs had been agreed on, one man went down and remained on the look-out\r\nduring the first part of the day, and a second took his place in the\r\nafternoon.  Thus all were employed.\r\n\r\nHarry took the afternoon of the second day.  Climbing to the top of the\r\nhill, he gazed, as before, anxiously round the horizon.  A sigh escaped\r\nhim when no sail appeared.  Sitting down, he remembered his Bible, which\r\nhe had always carried since he formed the resolution of doing so.  He\r\ntook it out.  From its sacred pages he drew that comfort which it always\r\naffords.  Never before had he read it with so much satisfaction, for he\r\nprayed earnestly that his mind might be enlightened; and he now was\r\nenabled to see many of the important truths he had never before\r\ncomprehended.  He read and read on, page after page.\r\n\r\n\"I would rather have this than every book on board!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised when he heard a hail from below, and found that the\r\nboat had come for him.\r\n\r\nSunday came round, and old Tom urged his companions to make it a day of\r\nrest.  Harry now produced his Bible, greatly to old Tom's delight.\r\nMorning and evening Tom had offered up a prayer, Harry and Bass and one\r\nor two of the seamen joining him, though others showed no inclination to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nHarry offered to read from his Bible, to which the men agreed; but\r\nthough they sat quiet and listened, some did so with apparent\r\nindifference.  He, however, selected such portions as he thought that\r\nthey would best understand.  By degrees they became interested.  He was\r\nreading the fourteenth chapter of Matthew--the account of our Lord's\r\nfeeding five thousand men, besides women and children; followed by that\r\nof Peter walking on the sea, when, through want of faith, he began to\r\nsink, and the Lord stretched forth His hand and saved him, saying, \"O\r\nthou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?\"\r\n\r\n\"So, lads,\" observed old Tom, \"you see how Jesus Christ fed the\r\nmultitudes when they were hungering, and saved Peter when in danger,\r\nthough his faith was weak.  We have been fed, you will all allow, when\r\nwe thought we had reached a barren island where no food was to be found;\r\nand in the same way, though I fear our faith is weak, He will take care\r\nof us.  Then it seems to me that we must give Him our hearts, just as\r\nPeter stretched out his hands to Christ for safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Tom speaks the truth, it seems to me,\" observed one of the men to a\r\ncompanion, in an undertone.  \"If I thought that Jesus would hold out His\r\nhand as He did to Peter, I should not despair; but I am such a terrible\r\nbad fellow, that I am sure I could not keep straight by myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus is ready, not only to grasp the hand of every one who cries for\r\nhelp, but when once He has got the man's hand in His He does not let it\r\ngo,\" said old Tom, who had overheard the remark.\r\n\r\nWhen evening closed and the boat's crew lay down in their hut, several\r\nof them acknowledged that they had never spent so happy a Sunday in\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nIN AN OPEN BOAT.\r\n\r\nA fortnight had elapsed, still the _Steadfast_ did not return.  The\r\nwhole island had been explored.  It was found not to be more than a\r\ncouple of miles long, and scarcely half a mile in width, the greater\r\nportion consisting of black volcanic rocks thrown up by some mighty\r\nconvulsion of nature.  No other harbour was discovered; indeed, there\r\nwas not a spot besides the bay they had entered on which a landing could\r\nbe effected without danger.  They probably were the first people who had\r\nentered the bay, for there were no signs of the island ever having been\r\ninhabited.  There was but a very small portion of ground fit for\r\ncultivation; the only trees were those which clothed the side of the\r\nvalley and the little cocoa-nut grove on the shore of the bay; while no\r\nother stream of water was discovered besides that near which they had\r\nformed their camp.\r\n\r\nAs the trees could not be perceived from the sea, Harry thought that,\r\neven if the island was marked on the chart, it was probably set down as\r\na barren rock on which no one could land.\r\n\r\n\"My father, depend upon it, thought that our boat was swamped in\r\nattempting to regain the ship, or else that she was driven on the rocks,\r\nwhen he might well suppose that none of us could have escaped.  He would\r\notherwise, I am sure, have come back before this,\" he observed to old\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n\"I hope that is the reason why he has not come back,\" was the answer;\r\nfor old Tom had come to the conclusion that the ship, with all hands,\r\nhad been lost, though he did not like to say so to Harry.\r\n\r\nThe men were beginning to get very impatient at their long detention on\r\nthe island.  Old Tom did his best to keep them employed; but it was\r\ndifficult to find work for them.  It was evident, too, that the\r\ncocoa-nuts would not last for ever; and when they had come to an end,\r\nwhat would they do for food? the men inquired.  They might live on fish;\r\nbut three or four of their hooks had already been lost, and in time they\r\nmight be unable even to catch fish.\r\n\r\n\"One thing is clear, lads,\" observed Tom; \"if we are to get away, we\r\nmust carry water with us as well as food.  Our small breaker will only\r\nhold enough for two or three days on short allowance, and, though we may\r\ncarry some in the tubs, it will be difficult to keep that from being\r\nspilled.  My advice is, that we set to work and scoop out a number of\r\ncocoa-nuts--they will hold a good supply--and we must try and smoke or\r\nsalt some fish.  I calculate that we can carry enough to last us three\r\nor four weeks, and in that time we may be able to reach a more fertile\r\nisland than this is--one likely to be visited by whalers--if we are not\r\nso fortunate as to be picked up by a ship first.\"\r\n\r\nThe men were eager to be off, and set to work readily to prepare for the\r\nvoyage.  Harry would rather have remained, still believing that the ship\r\nwould come back to look for them.  Some time, however, was occupied in\r\ncatching fish, and in drying and salting them, for it was necessary\r\nfirst to erect a building of stone for the former operation, and they\r\nhad to collect the salt in the holes of the rock along the shore.\r\n\r\nA lovely day, just a month after they landed, found them ready, with the\r\ncocoa-nut bottles and tubs full of water, and as many whole cocoa-nuts\r\nand as much dried and salt fish as they could stow away.\r\n\r\n\"Before we shove off, lads, let us return thanks to God for bringing us\r\nsafely here and giving us food to eat, and then let us pray that He will\r\ntake care of us in the voyage we are about to make,\" said old Tom.  \"I\r\ntell you that we shall meet with many dangers, from which He alone can\r\npreserve us.\"\r\n\r\nThe men agreed to old Tom's proposal; and then in good spirts they\r\npulled down the harbour and glided out into the open ocean, now shining\r\nin the bright sun of the early morning.  The surf, which broke on the\r\nrocks on either side in a gentle murmur, glittered brightly, presenting\r\na very different appearance to the wild fury it exhibited when they took\r\nrefuge within the bay.  A light breeze springing up from the northward,\r\nthe sail was hoisted, and the whale-boat stood to the south, away from\r\nthe dark, forbidding-looking island.  The small compass which is usually\r\ncarried in a whale-boat enabled them to steer in a tolerably direct\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads,\" said old Tom, \"we may reach land in about a fortnight; but\r\nit may be a month or six weeks before we fall in with an island where\r\nprovisions are to be found.  It will be well, therefore, to put\r\nourselves on an allowance both of water and food.  Remember that God\r\nhelps those who help themselves, and if we take more than we require to\r\nkeep up our strength, we cannot expect Him to send us a fresh supply.\"\r\n\r\nHarry and Dickey were always ready to support him, and the men, without\r\nmurmuring, agreed to do as he advised.\r\n\r\nThe crew having been divided into watches, old Tom taking charge of one\r\nand Harry of the other, and all other arrangements being made, old Tom\r\nlay down to rest, saying that he would keep the first night-watch.\r\n\r\nThey had a few candles for their lanterns, which had been carefully\r\nhusbanded; these were kept to be used should any night prove\r\nparticularly dark and cloudy, and the compass be required, for when the\r\nstars were shining they were sufficient to steer by.\r\n\r\nFor several days the boat sailed on over the tranquil ocean.  Sometimes\r\nit fell calm, when the men took to their oars.  The rest of the day they\r\nspent lying along the thwarts.  Morning and evening, however, Tom\r\noffered up prayer, and Harry read some chapters in the Bible, to which\r\nmost of the men listened attentively.\r\n\r\n\"What we should have done without your Bible, Mr Harry, I do not know,\"\r\nobserved old Tom.  \"I believe it has mainly contributed to keep the men\r\ncontented and happy; I only hope that they will remain in the same\r\ntemper.\"\r\n\r\n\"I at all events will read the Bible to them,\" said Harry.  Harry kept\r\nto his resolution.  Dickey was one of the most attentive of the\r\nlisteners.\r\n\r\n\"Harry,\" he said, one day, \"I confess that I did not before know what\r\nwas in the Bible when I used to sneer at old Tom for being religious,\r\nand was afraid that he would make you so.  I wish that he would make me\r\nlike himself or like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"God's Holy Spirit can alone make you, Mr Bass, what you ought to be,\"\r\nobserved old Tom, who had been listening to the boys' conversation.\r\n\"But you have to seek His grace, and to trust in Jesus, according to the\r\nteaching of His word; for we are there told that faith cometh by\r\nhearing, and hearing by the word of God.  I never yet met an infidel or\r\ncareless, bad fellow who really had read the Bible with prayer.  It is\r\nonly thus that we can benefit by it.  Many complain that they have no\r\nfaith, and that it is no fault of theirs--and yet they will not do the\r\nvery thing that God tells us to do; so you see that it is not God's\r\nfault if a man does not believe, but the man's own fault.  Do you read\r\nand pray earnestly and faithfully, and depend upon it God's Holy Spirit\r\nwill do His part and help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try, Tom, indeed I will,\" said Dickey; \"and will you and Harry\r\npray for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"That we will, Mr Bass, because God has said that earnest, believing\r\nprayer availeth much; but you must pray for yourself--you must not trust\r\nto others praying instead of you.  God will hear your prayers, though\r\nthey may be very weak and imperfect, just as He heard the prayer of the\r\npoor publican who smote on his breast and said, `God be merciful to me a\r\nsinner.'\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that all in the boat listened to Harry when he read\r\nthe Bible, or to old Tom when he spoke, or followed their example.\r\n\r\nWhile the weather remained fine and they had enough to eat, they kept up\r\ntheir spirits, and began to talk of what they would do when they got on\r\nshore.  Two or three of them indeed declared that they had had enough\r\nknocking about at sea, and that if they should land on a pleasant island\r\nwith good-natured natives, they would take up their quarters there and\r\nmarry wives and live a life of ease.\r\n\r\n\"If you do so, lads, you will run the risk of becoming heathens like\r\nthem, and forget God and all His benefits,\" observed old Tom.\r\n\"Remember, if we do land safely, it will not be our own right arm or our\r\nown strength which will have preserved us, but His merciful kindness;\r\nand I tell you, you will be ungrateful fellows if you do as you\r\npropose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Tom is always preaching,\" muttered one of the men to whom he spoke.\r\n\"I don't see why we have not a right to please ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nOld Tom did not hear this remark, and he probably would not then have\r\nanswered even if he had.\r\n\r\nFor ten days or so the voyage had continued without any change in the\r\nweather.  The sun was very hot, and the fish, which they thought had\r\nbeen well salted and smoked, began to taste very strong.  Harry and\r\nDickey could only eat very small pieces at a time, with the help of some\r\ncocoa-nut and a sip of water between each mouthful.  Next day a perfect\r\ncalm came on, and the sun beat down with intense force on the boat.\r\nAlthough their provisions were covered up and kept as cool as possible,\r\nthe fish grew worse and worse.  Several of the men, when it was served\r\nout to them, threw it overboard with disgust, declaring that they could\r\neat it no longer.\r\n\r\n\"Seeing we have nothing else to live upon, we should be thankful that we\r\nhave got that, and not throw it from us,\" observed old Tom.  \"It's\r\nbad-tasted, I'll allow; but as long as we can manage to get it down it\r\nwill help to support life, and we should try to eat it.\"\r\n\r\nHarry and Bass did as he advised, and as yet they did not find their\r\nstrength much diminished.\r\n\r\nMost of the men, however, began to complain of pains and aches, and\r\nunwillingly got out their oars.  Tom urged them to pull on, in the hope\r\nthat they might in a day or two reach some island which Harry thought\r\ncould not be far off.\r\n\r\nDay after day they had gone on, ever appearing to be in the midst of the\r\nsame circle where sky and sea met, without sighting land or a distant\r\nsail.  At night, while one watch rowed the other slept.\r\n\r\nAnother morning came, but still the glass-like ocean showed no signs of\r\na coming breeze.  They had put in their oars, and were munching their\r\nshare of cocoa-nut and such small pieces of the fish as they could still\r\neat, when suddenly, at a little distance, the surface of the water was\r\nbroken, and a covey of flying-fish darted through the air towards them.\r\nA dozen or more fell into the boat, and were eagerly seized and killed\r\nby the famishing crew.\r\n\r\n\"Let us thank God, who sent them to us,\" said Tom, as several of the men\r\ngreedily began to bite at the fresh, tempting-looking morsels.\r\n\r\nHalf the number were cut up, and the remainder Tom advised should be\r\nreserved for dinner.\r\n\r\nThe food somewhat restored the men's spirits, and they pulled on for\r\nsome hours without murmuring.\r\n\r\nAnother and another day passed by, and then a breeze sprang up, and the\r\nsail was hoisted, and they ran on before the wind.  All felt that unless\r\nthey should shortly reach land or be picked up by a ship their fate was\r\ncertain.  Their cocoa-nuts and water were nearly exhausted, and even old\r\nTom could with difficulty manage to eat a small portion of fish.  Still\r\nhe appeared calm and happy, and did his best to encourage his\r\ncompanions; he sat at the steering oar for the greater part of the day\r\nand night, taking but little rest.  When he lay down he charged those\r\nwho were on the watch to keep a bright look-out for land, while he\r\nhimself, when awake, had his eyes moving round the horizon in the hope\r\nof discovering it.\r\n\r\nAt length all the water was gone, and not a piece of cocoa-nut remained.\r\nOne of the crew, who had long been complaining, had lain down in the\r\nbow, saying he should go to sleep.  When it was his turn to keep watch,\r\nJack Harding, one of the men, tried to arouse him.  Jack lifted his arm,\r\nwhich fell down by his side.\r\n\r\n\"Bill has slipped his cable, I am afraid,\" said Jack, in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\nHarry went forward to ascertain if such was the case.  Bill was indeed\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n\"Lads,\" said old Tom, \"I don't know which of us will go next, but this I\r\nknow, that the case of those who are not trusting in Christ is a very\r\nterrible one.  I won't say anything about poor Bill, but I speak to you\r\nas a dying man to dying men.  The day of grace has not yet passed--\r\nto-morrow it may have gone by for some, if not for all those who are\r\nstill unreconciled to God.  I said this before to you when you were in\r\nhealth; God in His mercy has allowed you to suffer from starvation and\r\nsickness, that He might lead you to Himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"We dare say you speak the truth, Mr Hayes,\" answered one of the men;\r\n\"but it's hard to believe that God, if He is as kind as you say, should\r\nallow us to suffer as we are doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"He allowed His faithful apostles of old, and many thousands of\r\nChristians since then, to suffer far more than we are doing; and yet\r\nthey acknowledged to the last that He does all things well,\" answered\r\nold Tom.  \"I have just told you why He allows you to suffer; and\r\nremember what Saint Paul says, `The sufferings of this present time are\r\nnot worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in\r\nus.'\"\r\n\r\nTom's address served as the funeral sermon of poor Bill, who was shortly\r\nafterwards lifted overboard by his sorrowing companions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nSAVAGES AND MISSIONARIES.\r\n\r\nIt was again night.  For the greater part of it old Tom sat at the helm,\r\nwhile a gentle breeze wafted them on.  Once more the sun rose.  It was\r\nHarry's watch.  As he glanced round the horizon, he caught sight of a\r\nblue undulating line to the south-west.  At first he thought that it was\r\na bank of clouds, but at length he was convinced that it was land he\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\n\"Land! land!\" he cried out.\r\n\r\nHis shouts aroused all the sleepers.\r\n\r\n\"Land it is! there is no doubt about that!\" said old Tom, taking his\r\nseat at the helm and steering towards it.\r\n\r\nAs they approached they saw it was an island of some extent, with hills\r\ncovered with trees, but a coral reef intervened.  A passage, however,\r\nwas at length discovered.  How eagerly the famished crew longed to get\r\non shore to quench their burning thirst and satisfy their hunger!\r\n\r\nThe first object which met their sight, as they pulled into a small\r\npicturesque bay, was a stream of water, which came sparkling and foaming\r\ndown the side of the hill.  Not far off was a grove of cocoa-nut palms,\r\nnear which were several other fruit-bearing trees.  Without stopping to\r\nascertain whether any natives, were in the neighbourhood, they pulled to\r\nthe shore, and leaping out, rushed forward to quench their thirst at the\r\nnearest point of the stream which they could reach.  Some cocoa-nuts\r\nwere also quickly obtained, and sitting down, they soon emptied the\r\ncontents of the shells of several.\r\n\r\n\"If we had fallen in with this island two or three days ago, poor Bill,\r\nmaybe, would have been alive and merry now,\" observed one of the men.\r\n\r\n\"It might have been so, lads,\" said Tom; \"but one thing I know, that we\r\nshould be thankful for God's mercy in bringing us thus far in safety.\"\r\n\r\nThe strength of all the party was revived by the food and water.  By\r\nTom's advice they refilled the casks and cocoa-nut bottles.  He then\r\nproposed that they should push off into the bay, and try and catch some\r\nfish.  Two of the men replied that they had had food enough, and\r\npreferred remaining in the shade under the trees; the rest, however,\r\nagreed to accompany him.  Some crabs and shell-fish, as before, served\r\nthem as bait.\r\n\r\nThey had been fishing for some time with good success, and were\r\ncontemplating returning to the shore to cook the fish and to rest for\r\nthe night, when they caught sight among the trees, at some distance from\r\nthe beach, of several savages, who had apparently been watching them.\r\nThese were joined by others, who began flourishing their weapons and\r\nshouting.  The two men who had been left on shore, on hearing their\r\nvoices, started up, and, observing their menacing attitude, ran towards\r\nthe beach.  The crew of the boat, seeing the danger of their companions,\r\npulled in as fast as they could bend to their oars, in the hope of\r\nrescuing them.  The distance was considerable.  Neither of the poor\r\nfellows could swim.  They rushed into the water up to their necks.  The\r\nnatives came on yelling towards them.  Long before the boat could get up\r\nto them they were dragged back, and in another instant dispatched by the\r\nclubs of the savages.\r\n\r\n\"It's too late, lads!\" cried old Tom, who saw what had occurred; \"we\r\nshall be treated as they have been if we let the savages get hold of us.\r\nWe must make the best of our way out of the bay.  It's a mercy that we\r\nhave got the water and food.\"\r\n\r\nThere was indeed no time to be lost, for at that moment another party of\r\nsavages were seen bringing several canoes down to the beach.  Old Tom\r\ntold Harry to take the helm, while he and the three remaining men pulled\r\naway out to sea.  Happily, just as they got near the passage through the\r\nreef, a breeze sprang up, and they were able to hoist the sail.  At that\r\ninstant four canoes were seen paddling out of the bay.  It still seemed\r\ndoubtful whether they would escape.  The breeze, however, freshened, and\r\nthe whale-boat darting ahead, soon distanced her pursuers.\r\n\r\nTom urged his companions not to despair.\r\n\r\n\"We may still reach another island where the natives will treat us more\r\nkindly than these have done,\" he observed.\r\n\r\nHarry thought that there were other islands to the southward, the\r\nnatives of which were well spoken of.  That was all he could say on the\r\nsubject.  How far off they were he could not tell.\r\n\r\nThey had now a good supply of water; but they had put only a few\r\ncocoa-nuts into the boat, and though they had several fish, they would\r\nvery soon be unfit to eat.\r\n\r\n\"He who has brought us thus far will still take care of us, lads, if we\r\nwill but trust Him,\" said old Tom.\r\n\r\nThis was the burden of his address day after day.\r\n\r\nThe fish they were still able to eat on the second day, so that they\r\ncould reserve their cocoa-nuts.\r\n\r\nThey had been living on the latter, with some water, for two days\r\nlonger, when again a covey of flying-fish passed over the boat, nearly a\r\ndozen falling into her.  This afforded them the means of subsistence for\r\ntwo days more, then again they had to resort to the remainder of the\r\ncocoa-nuts.  These were, however, at length finished.\r\n\r\nDay after day they sailed on, no land appearing in sight.  Even should\r\nthey reach shore, they were aware that they might be received in the\r\nsame hostile way that they were before.\r\n\r\nThe last cocoa-nut was eaten, the last drop of water exhausted.  The\r\nhapless wanderers gazed with lack-lustre eyes in each other's faces.\r\nWhat would next happen?\r\n\r\n\"All we can now do is to lay ourselves down and die,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, lad; trust still in God,\" answered old Tom.  \"He has preserved\r\nus hitherto.  If He thinks fit He can still carry us safe to shore.  See\r\naway there over the starboard bow--what do you make out?\"\r\n\r\nHarry and Dickey lifted their heads and gazed in the direction in which\r\nold Tom pointed.\r\n\r\n\"My old eyes are sharper than your young ones,\" he observed, when they\r\nmade no reply.\r\n\r\n\"I make out the top of a mountain rising above the horizon.  We shall\r\nsee more of it before nightfall if the wind holds; let us pray that it\r\nmay.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the people would not believe old Tom, and declared that he\r\nwas mistaken; but he persisted in his assertion that land was ahead, and\r\nurged them to keep up their spirits.\r\n\r\nBefore nightfall land appeared clearly in view, but still at a great\r\ndistance.  All night long they ran on, old Tom sitting at the helm, for\r\nhe would trust no one else, while Harry and Dickey did their best to\r\nkeep a look-out ahead, for, young as they were, they endured their\r\nsufferings better than the older men, who lay stretched out on the\r\nthwarts.\r\n\r\nWhen morning dawned a beautiful island, with rocks and trees and\r\nmountains in the centre, appeared about two miles ahead; but it was\r\nsurrounded by a reef, over which the sea dashed in masses of foam,\r\nbarring their approach to the shore.\r\n\r\n\"Never fear, boys, we shall find a passage through it,\" said old Tom.\r\n\r\nThey sailed on, and in a short time the expected passage was seen, the\r\nwater shining calm and blue within it.\r\n\r\nThey glided on towards a bay, beyond which a valley opened up into the\r\ninterior of the country.  On one side, on the slope of a hill, appeared\r\na few neat cottages, and among them a building of larger size.\r\n\r\n\"If my eyes don't deceive me, that's a chapel!\" exclaimed old Tom; \"and\r\nwhere there is a chapel there will be Christians, and we shall be\r\nreceived by them as friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe men roused up on hearing this, for in their despair they believed\r\nthat on landing they should be murdered like their companions.\r\n\r\nOld Tom steered without hesitation towards the cottages.  As they\r\napproached, several persons were seen coming down to the beach.  Two\r\nwere in European costume, one of whom was a woman, while most of the\r\nrest were dressed in shirts and trousers.  Before the boat's keel had\r\ntouched the shore, several of the latter came rushing forward into the\r\nwater; and, seeing the condition of those on board, they carefully\r\nlifted them out, and bore them to the shore in their arms.  The white\r\npeople, who were at once recognised by old Tom as missionaries, kindly\r\npressing his hand, invited him and his companions to their house.\r\n\r\n\"We will not ask questions now,\" they said; \"your appearance shows the\r\nsufferings you have endured.\"\r\n\r\nThe natives, receiving directions from the missionary, again lifted them\r\nup, and followed him, while his wife hastened on with two native girls\r\nto make preparations for their reception.\r\n\r\nFood and water were, however, what they most required.\r\n\r\n\"I can allow you to partake of them but sparingly at first,\" observed\r\nthe missionary.  \"God's greatest blessings are too often abused by being\r\nenjoyed in excess.\"\r\n\r\nHarry and old Tom thanked him, and said they did not wish for more than\r\nwould be beneficial; but the men grumbled at not being allowed to have\r\nas much as they could devour, when they were so hungry.  Poor Dickey was\r\nunable to speak, and could scarcely eat the food given to him.\r\n\r\nThe missionary, who told them that his name was Hart, and that he and\r\nhis wife had resided scarcely a year on the island, showed them the\r\ngreatest sympathy and kindness.  Mrs Hart took poor Dickey under her\r\nespecial care, and gave him nourishing food in small quantities till she\r\nsaw that his strength was returning, and that his pulse was beating more\r\nregularly.  He could not help feeling, indeed, that it was mainly owing\r\nto her care that his life was preserved.\r\n\r\nIn the course of two or three days the strength of all the party was\r\nmuch restored, and Harry and old Tom were able to get up and join Mr\r\nand Mrs Hart at their meals.  They then gave an account of their\r\nadventures.  \"You have indeed been mercifully preserved,\" observed Mr\r\nHart.  \"What confidence does it give us when we know that we are under\r\nthe protection of our Heavenly Father!  Were it not for that, my wife\r\nand I could not live as we do in this island, surrounded by hostile\r\nsavages, far away from other Europeans.  It is true that we have with us\r\na small band of Christian natives; but their numbers are insufficient\r\nfor our defence, even if we wished them to fight.  We have often been\r\nthreatened, but hitherto the heathens have been restrained from\r\nattacking us.  Many, indeed, have come to listen to the doctrines we\r\npreach, and now one and now another has acknowledged Jehovah to be the\r\ntrue God.  The more progress we have made, the greater has been the\r\nanimosity of the heathens, and of late, instigated by their priests,\r\nthey have threatened our destruction.  Still we persevere, in the hope,\r\nwhatever may happen, of gaining more souls for Christ's kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nHarry was surprised to hear Mr Hart speak so calmly of the dangers\r\nwhich surrounded him, and to observe that Mrs Hart did not appear in\r\nany way alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"But if the heathen party attack you, what do you propose doing?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"We know that our friends will protect us as long as they have the power\r\nto do so,\" answered the missionary.  \"We are perfectly resigned to\r\nwhatever God, in His providence, may allow.  Should the heathens have\r\nresolved to put us to death, we are sure that if God allows them to\r\nsucceed He has an important object in view, and that our death will\r\nultimately tend to His honour and glory.  At the same time, should means\r\nof escape be afforded us, we should consider it our duty to take\r\nadvantage of them.  Our friends know of some hiding-places in the\r\nmountains to which they have promised to take us, should they obtain\r\ntimely notice of an intended attack on the station; but we suspect that,\r\neven should we succeed in reaching a place of concealment, it may be\r\ndiscovered by our enemies, and we have little expectation of being in\r\nsafety even there.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Hart spoke to the same effect, but expressed a hope that the enmity\r\nof the heathens might abate, or that friends might arrive who would turn\r\nthem from their purpose.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the threatening aspect of affairs, Mr and Mrs Hart\r\nattended zealously to their missionary duties.  Mr Hart not only\r\npreached the gospel, but held a school for men and boys, whom he\r\ninstructed in various branches of knowledge, while Mrs Hart taught the\r\nwomen and girls and young children.  Mr Hart also instructed them in\r\nseveral mechanical arts, and showed them improved methods of cultivating\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nWith their assistance he had built the house he inhabited, and had\r\nmanufactured most of the furniture it contained, as also the\r\nschool-house and chapel, and many of the natives had erected neat\r\ncottages after the same model.  Indeed, the whole place already wore an\r\nair of civilisation and comfort, which contrasted greatly with the\r\nheathen portion of the island.\r\n\r\nThe missionary and his wife were employed from morning till night among\r\ntheir converts, and much of the time spent in their own house was\r\ndevoted to study.  They enjoyed, indeed, none of that luxurious ease\r\nwhich some people in England suppose falls to the lot of missionaries in\r\nthe sunny isles of the Pacific, but, harassed by numerous cares and\r\nanxieties, their days were spent in toil, while they knew that their\r\nlives were in constant danger.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Harry and old Tom were able to move about, they begged that\r\nMr Hart would allow them to assist him in his labours.  Harry would\r\ngladly have tried to teach the natives, but his ignorance of their\r\nlanguage prevented him being of use in that way.  They both, however,\r\ncould carpenter and dig, and accordingly helped in fitting up the\r\nschool-house, which had just been erected.\r\n\r\nDickey was soon able to join them.  Two days afterwards the three men\r\nhad sufficiently recovered to take their share of the work.\r\n\r\nAgain a rumour reached the settlement that the heathens were about to\r\nattack it.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what, Harry,\" said old Tom, when they happened to be\r\nalone together.  \"There is one thing we ought to do, and that is to get\r\nthe boat ready for use.  I don't fancy Mr and Mrs Hart hiding away in\r\nthe mountains.  They are pretty sure to be starved to death, if the\r\nsavages don't get hold of them, which I fear it is very likely they will\r\ndo.  And as to fighting to defend them, though we should be ready enough\r\nto risk our lives, yet as we have no arms we cannot hope to succeed.  If\r\nwe had had half a dozen muskets we might have thrown up a fortification\r\nand defended our friends, but without them the naked savages are our\r\nsuperiors when it comes to fighting; besides, Mr Hart does not wish to\r\nfight.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is, I suspect, right on that point,\" said Harry.  \"He wishes to show\r\nthe savages that the religion of the gospel is one of love and mercy and\r\nlong-suffering; and musket bullets, even if we had arms, would not\r\ncontribute to do that.  I agree with you, however, that the sooner we\r\ncan get the boat ready the better.\"\r\n\r\nOld Tom on this called the other men, and they all set to work to\r\nprepare the boat for sea.  Harry also informed the missionary and his\r\nwife of their intentions, and urged Mrs Hart to get ready such a stock\r\nof provisions as she could collect.\r\n\r\n\"For your sakes I will do so,\" she answered; \"but if my husband still\r\nthinks it right that we should remain, I cannot try to persuade him to\r\nfly.  We ought to stop and share the lot of the poor converts.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would, I think, by remaining, only increase their danger,\" observed\r\nHarry.  \"They might, if alone, escape to the mountains and hide\r\nthemselves; but if they have you to attend to, they would run a much\r\ngreater risk of being discovered.  Whereas if you accompany us, and our\r\nlives are preserved, you may return when the rage of the heathens is\r\nabated, and re-establish the mission.\"\r\n\r\nThese arguments seemed to have considerable effect on Mrs Hart, and\r\nHarry hoped that she and her husband would no longer hesitate to embark,\r\nshould the heathens seriously threaten to attack the station.\r\n\r\nThings, however, went on much as usual for several days.  The boat was\r\nmade ready for sea, while as much water and provisions as she could\r\ncarry were prepared to be put on board at a moment's notice.\r\n\r\nThe three men had by this time grown weary of the monotonous life they\r\nwere compelled to live at the station, and, notwithstanding the dangers\r\nthey had gone through, they were anxious again to be off in search of\r\nsome other island, where they could live at their ease among the\r\nnatives, without running the risk of being murdered, as they were\r\nassured they would be should they wander away among the heathens.  Old\r\nTom and the two boys did their best to persuade them to remain\r\ncontentedly where they were; but, from some remarks overheard by Bass,\r\nHarry was afraid that they contemplated running off with the boat,\r\nshould they be detained much longer.\r\n\r\n\"If they make the attempt they will lose their lives to a certainty,\"\r\nobserved old Tom, when Harry told him.  \"But I think better of them.  We\r\nwill make them understand that we remain for the sake of the poor lady\r\nand gentleman who have left their home in England to try and benefit the\r\nignorant savages, and that while they are in danger we should be cowards\r\nto desert them.\"\r\n\r\nThe men acknowledged, when Tom spoke to them, that he was right, and\r\npromised to remain contentedly to assist the missionary and his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nATTACK AND FLIGHT.\r\n\r\nOld Tom and the three men had built a hut for themselves at a short\r\ndistance from the missionary's house, that they might not incommode him\r\nand his wife.  He, however, kindly insisted that the two lads should\r\ncontinue their guests.\r\n\r\nThe more Harry saw of Mr Hart, the more anxious he became to assist\r\nhim, and in order to do so he commenced studying the language of the\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder you take so much trouble, Harry,\" observed his companion Bass;\r\n\"it seems to me like labour lost, when we may at any moment be compelled\r\nto run away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I hope, if we do, we shall be able to return,\" said Harry.  \"I\r\nthink, of all the works in which man can engage, that of converting the\r\nheathen, and instructing them in the truths of the gospel, is the first\r\nand noblest.  I would rather be employed in it than in any other.  We\r\nlook with respect on a man who has saved the life of a fellow-creature;\r\nbut surely, as the soul is of infinitely more value than the body, it\r\nmust be infinitely more noble to be the means of saving souls.  If it\r\nwere not for my mother and sister, I would rather remain out here and\r\nlabour with Mr Hart than return home.  But still I feel that it is my\r\nfirst duty to try and go back to England, that I may comfort my mother\r\nand sister, should, as I fear is the case, the _Steadfast_ and all hands\r\nhave been lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Each man to his task,\" answered Dickey; \"but I should have thought that\r\nyou, who have a good chance of some day getting the command of a ship,\r\nwould have preferred remaining at sea, even should the _Steadfast_ be\r\nlost.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not given up all hopes of her even yet,\" answered Harry; \"though\r\nI cannot account for her not coming to look for us.\"\r\n\r\nHarry was soon able to speak a few words to the natives, and, as they\r\nwere anxious to learn English, they took pains to teach him their own\r\ntongue in return for the instruction he gave them, and he and they were\r\nthus able to understand each other on ordinary subjects.\r\n\r\nRumours that the heathens were meditating an attack again reached the\r\nstation.  A large body of savages had been seen on the hills a short\r\ndistance off flourishing their weapons, and making fierce and\r\nthreatening gestures.  Perhaps they had been deterred from their purpose\r\nby the arrival of the boat, and, believing that all white men were\r\npossessed of firearms, been unwilling to encounter them.  As, however,\r\nheathens were constantly coming to the village and going away again,\r\nsome of them would probably report that they had seen no muskets, and\r\nthat the number of white men was very small.\r\n\r\nOne evening, after prayers had been offered up in the missionary's\r\nhouse, and old Tom and his companions had returned to their hut, just as\r\nHarry and Bass were about to go to bed, a knocking was heard at the\r\ndoor, Harry opened it, when a native appeared, and, in an agitated\r\nvoice, told them that a friend who still lived among the heathens had\r\njust stolen into the village with the intelligence that a large band of\r\nsavages, led on by one of their priests, was approaching at a rapid\r\nrate, having vowed to destroy all the Christians before the morning.\r\n\r\nHarry at once told Mrs Hart, who was at first inclined to believe that\r\nit was only another false report, such as had often before reached them.\r\nThe native, however, was positive that his friend was not mistaken, and\r\ndeclared that if their dear missionary and his wife would not fly, he\r\nand the other converts would carry them off by force to the mountains.\r\nHarry proposed that scouts should be sent out to ascertain the fact, and\r\nentreated Mr and Mrs Hart to embark at once, and to wait in the boat\r\ntill the return of the scouts.  In the meantime he sent Bass to summon\r\nTom and his companions.  Several of the converts were ready to act as\r\nscouts, though they declared that there was no doubt of the truth of the\r\nreport, and that it would be wiser to escape at once to the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe whole population now gathered round the mission-house, and urged Mr\r\nand Mrs Hart to go on board the boat, which had been sent, they\r\nasserted, on purpose to preserve their lives.  The missionary and his\r\nwife at length agreed to act as they were advised, though still loth to\r\nleave the converts.  The people, though they knew the danger they\r\nthemselves ran by remaining, would not commence their flight till they\r\nhad seen their white friends, whom they hurried down to the beach, safe\r\non board.  At the same time, some of them carried the provisions which\r\nhad been prepared on board, while others brought from their own stores a\r\nstill further supply, and would have added more, had not old Tom assured\r\nthem that the boat was already overloaded.  She had just been launched\r\ninto deep water, when one of the scouts came hurrying back with the\r\nintelligence that the savages were close to the village, and that there\r\nwas but little time for their countrymen to make their escape.  While\r\nthe Christian natives hurried off in the direction of the mountains, the\r\nboat pulled away from the shore towards the passage which led into the\r\nopen sea.\r\n\r\nThe night was cloudy and dark, but a strong breeze was blowing, which\r\nsent the surf high over the reef, so that the passage could easily be\r\ndistinguished.  Mr Hart, even to the last, was very unwilling to desert\r\nhis station, and begged old Tom to remain inside the lagoon till they\r\ncould see what would happen.  They were not left long in doubt, for a\r\nfew minutes only had elapsed after they had quitted the beach when\r\nfearful shouts and yells rent the air.  The savages, expecting to entrap\r\ntheir victims, had evidently surrounded the village, and were rushing\r\nforward with the intention of putting all within it to death.\r\n\r\nIn a short time torches which they had lighted were seen flaring up,\r\ntheir glare being cast on the tall trees and rocks and the sides of the\r\nhills, as they rushed forward to throw them into the buildings.  In a\r\nfew seconds more the whole village was in a blaze, and burning\r\nfuriously.  The dark figures of the savages could be seen as they stood\r\nready with uplifted weapons to strike those whom they expected to issue\r\nforth.  Their rage and disappointment must have been great when no one\r\nappeared.  The delay, however, it was hoped, would enable the fugitives\r\nto escape to their proposed hiding-places.  As the bright light from the\r\nburning buildings shed a glare over the water, at length the savages\r\nperceived the boat, and rushed down to the beach, shouting loudly to\r\nthose in her to return, some darting their spears, and others shooting\r\narrows towards her.  She was happily too far off for the weapons to\r\nreach her.\r\n\r\n\"The heathens have been allowed to triumph for a time,\" said Mr Hart.\r\n\"I pray that our poor converts will escape their fury.  We must now\r\ntrust to the protection of Him who is able to guide us over the stormy\r\nocean to a haven of rest.  His will be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sooner we are out of the reach of those savages the better, or they\r\nwill be coming after us in their canoes,\" observed old Tom.  \"When we\r\nare outside we shall be able to make sail and stand to the eastward.  If\r\nthe wind favours us we shall reach a Christian island in the course of a\r\nweek, where we are sure to meet a hearty welcome.  We have provisions\r\nenough on board to last us a month, so we need have no fear of starving,\r\nwhatever happens.\"\r\n\r\nThis address encouraged the men, who pulled away in good spirits, Harry\r\nand Bass, who had each an oar, setting them an example.  Mr Hart\r\noffered to row.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, sir,\" answered old Tom.  \"You are not accustomed to the sort of\r\nlife we shall have to lead for the next few days, and you will have\r\nenough to do to look after your poor wife.  We all feel more for her\r\nthan for ourselves, and will do our best to make her as comfortable as\r\nwe can.\"\r\n\r\nMrs Hart thanked old Tom, and assured him that she was resigned to\r\nwhatever might happen, and felt no alarm, notwithstanding the fearful\r\nscene they had witnessed.\r\n\r\nThe boat now reached the passage, and passing between the two walls of\r\nfoam which rose up on either hand, was soon tossing on the wild sea\r\noutside.  Harry, as he pulled away, had watched the shore anxiously, and\r\nwas thankful to find that they were not as yet pursued.  He had little\r\ndoubt, however, that, as soon as the savages could reach their canoes,\r\nthey would put off in chase, they not supposing that so small a boat\r\nwould venture out into the open sea on so stormy a night.\r\n\r\n\"Now, lads, we will set up the mast and make sail,\" said old Tom, after\r\nthe boat had got some distance from the reef.  \"You need not be alarmed,\r\nmarm,\" he continued, addressing Mrs Hart; \"this whale-boat of ours is\r\nstrong, and will go through twice as much sea as we have now.\"\r\n\r\nOld Tom did not over-estimate the good qualities of the boat.  Though\r\nthe dark seas rose up capped with foam around her, she sprang lightly\r\nover them, guided by his experienced hands, scarcely shipping a drop of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThus she went on during the night.\r\n\r\nWhen morning dawned she had run the island out of sight.  As the wind\r\nhad been gradually decreasing, and the sea going down, they were able to\r\nre-stow the boat.\r\n\r\nBy Harry's forethought several articles had been put on board which\r\nmight conduce to Mrs Hart's comfort.  Among them was a small mattress\r\nand a tarpaulin, which had served to protect their luggage when they\r\nfirst landed.  With this a cabin was fitted in the stern of the boat,\r\nwhich, though narrow and confined, afforded her the shelter she so much\r\nneeded.  Within, shaded from the rays of the sun, she could recline\r\nduring the heat of the day, while by lifting up the edges, sufficient\r\nair was admitted.  Not a murmur escaped her lips, while she warmly\r\nexpressed her thanks for the attention bestowed on her.\r\n\r\n\"We should be very ungrateful, marm, if we did not do our best to make\r\nyou comfortable; for if it had not been for you and Mr Hart, I am\r\npretty sure none of us would have been now alive.  If we had landed on\r\nanother part of the island, the savages, judging from the way they\r\nbehaved last night, would have knocked us all on the head.  I am sure,\r\nlads, I say what you all feel.\"\r\n\r\nThe men acknowledged that old Tom spoke the truth, and promised to do\r\ntheir best to take care of the missionary and his wife.\r\n\r\nMr Hart began the day by offering up a prayer for protection, and\r\nthanking their Father in heaven for preserving their lives from the fury\r\nof the savages.  Then, opening his Bible, he read several portions\r\nshowing how full of loving-kindness and mercy God is; at the same time,\r\nbeing just, He can by no means overlook iniquity.  On this account it\r\nwas that He gave us the inestimable gift of His Son, the Lamb without\r\nspot or blemish, to die instead of sinful man.  And He requires now that\r\nmen should believe that Christ thus died for their sakes, that His blood\r\natones for all their sins, that God receives them, rebels though they\r\nhave hitherto been, as His dear children, and makes them holy by His own\r\ngood Spirit, fitted to enter the glorious heaven which He has prepared\r\nfor all those who love Him.\r\n\r\nAgain and again, with earnest prayer that they might receive it, Mr\r\nHart impressed these truths on his hearers.  They had heard them before;\r\nbut their minds were so dull, and their hearts so hard even now, that\r\nbut slight impression appeared to have been made on them.  Young Bass\r\nalone at length murmured, \"I do believe, and desire to give my heart to\r\nJesus; pray for me, Mr Hart, for I am afraid if I were to get back\r\namong careless companions, that I should again become as they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"From that God will assuredly guard you, my young friend, if you\r\nearnestly seek for His guidance; and our prayers, as well as yours, will\r\nbe heard at the throne of grace.\"\r\n\r\nDay after day went by, the boat making but slow progress, for it was an\r\nalmost perfect calm; and, though the oars were got out, and kept going,\r\nthe men either could not, or would not, make much exertion in rowing.\r\nMr Hart, and Harry and Bass, and old Tom, took their turns at the oars,\r\nand endeavoured to encourage the men.  Still no land appeared in sight.\r\nThe men grumbled, and declared that they would rather have a gale than\r\nthis long continuance of calm.\r\n\r\n\"Let us rather be thankful, my friends, for the fine weather; and,\r\nthough our voyage is prolonged, we may still hope to reach a haven of\r\nsafety,\" observed Mr Hart.\r\n\r\nThe gale the men were wishing for came, however, with more fury than\r\nthey desired.  Once more the boat was tossing on the foaming waves, when\r\nthe sea, breaking over her, washed away a portion of their provisions,\r\nand compelled them to be constantly bailing to keep her afloat.  She was\r\ndriven, too, far out of her course, and often it seemed as if she could\r\nnot live amid the raging seas which rose up around her.  Old Tom,\r\nhowever, sat at the helm, calm and undismayed, steering with his\r\naccustomed skill.  All knew well that their lives depended, under\r\nProvidence, on him.\r\n\r\nStill the tempest was increasing.  In spite of the admirable way old Tom\r\nmanaged the boat, another sea broke on board, washing out of her more of\r\nthe provisions, and almost carrying away one of the men as he lay asleep\r\nin the bows.  He was caught by the man next to him, and hauled in, and\r\nall hands had instantly to set to work to bail out the water.\r\n\r\n\"It looks to me as if this hurricane was never going to cease!\" cried\r\nthe chief grumbler of the party.  \"We might as well have stopped and\r\nfought the savages, and if they had killed us there would have been an\r\nend of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend, God will cause the hurricane to cease when He thinks fit,\"\r\nsaid Mr Hart, solemnly.  \"Be thankful rather that you are yet alive,\r\nand that the day of grace still lasts.  You had not then accepted\r\nChrist, and heaven would never have been your home.  Have you done so\r\nnow?  God is still willing to receive you; and He shows it by having\r\npreserved you hitherto from the perils by which we have been\r\nsurrounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, sir,\" answered the man, at length touched; \"I am an\r\nungrateful fellow, God be merciful to me a sinner!  I will never\r\ncomplain again.\"\r\n\r\n\"God is always merciful, my friend; He has offered you the means by\r\nwhich you may be saved.  He has not thought fit to establish any other\r\nmeans, or opened up any other way by which you can enter heaven but that\r\none single way, and He says, `Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou\r\nshalt be saved.'  Believe, my dear friend; think how precious your soul\r\nis.  Remember the thief on the cross; and if, like him, you can truly\r\nsay, `I believe,' should the boat be overwhelmed the next minute, you\r\nwill be where he is, with Jesus in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThe storm at length ceased, and the sorely battered boat was left\r\nfloating calmly on the water; but nearly all the provisions were gone,\r\ntwo of the oars had been washed overboard, and there was a leak in her\r\nside which it was found impossible altogether to stop, while the crew\r\nwere well-nigh worn out.\r\n\r\nMr Hart sat with his beloved wife in his arms, feeling that it might be\r\nGod's will that they should not again see land.  They were prepared for\r\nwhatever He might decree, and they felt more for their two young\r\ncompanions, and for Harry's mother and sister, of whom he had been\r\nspeaking to them, than for themselves.  As they gazed at the haggard\r\nfaces of the two boys and the old man, it seemed to them that before\r\nlong one or the other would be called away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nSAVED AND WRECKED.\r\n\r\nWell might the unhappy fugitives have despaired.  The larger portion of\r\ntheir provisions had been washed overboard; the remainder were almost\r\nexhausted; their boat was battered and leaky, the seamen were apparently\r\ndying, and unable to determine in what direction to seek for land.  For\r\nweeks they might sail on and not find it.  Still the missionary and his\r\ncompanions placed their trust in Him who is able to save them.\r\n\r\nA light breeze once more sent the boat through the water.  They were\r\ngliding on when Harry observed that old Tom's eye was intently gazing\r\ntowards the south-west, yet he did not speak.  Harry looked in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"What do you see, lad?\" asked old Tom.\r\n\r\nHarry rubbed his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is.  A sail! a sail!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so, but feared that my hopes might have deceived me,\" said\r\nold Tom.  \"She is standing this way, and is close-hauled.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat was steered so as to intercept the stranger.  Harry kept his\r\ngaze fixed on her.  She was evidently a whaler.\r\n\r\n\"Can she be the _Steadfast_?\" exclaimed Dickey, who was also earnestly\r\nlooking at her.\r\n\r\n\"I was in hopes that she might be,\" exclaimed Harry.\r\n\r\n\"The _Steadfast_ would be deeper in the water, and has a new cloth on\r\nher foretopsail, and that ship has not,\" observed old Tom.\r\n\r\n\"We should be thankful, whatever she is,\" said Mr Hart.  \"Let us return\r\nthanks to God for sending her to rescue us.\"\r\n\r\nThe men roused up on hearing that a ship was approaching, and managed\r\neven to get their oars out to pull alongside her.\r\n\r\nAs they drew near they saw clearly that she was not the _Steadfast_.\r\n\r\nThe stranger hove to.  A person, whom they supposed to be the captain,\r\nasked whence they had come and what they wanted.\r\n\r\n\"We are escaping from savages, and entreat you to receive us on board,\r\nfor we are almost starved,\" answered Mr Hart.\r\n\r\n\"You may come on deck, then,\" said the captain; but that was more than\r\nany one in the boat unassisted could do.  Even old Tom, the strongest of\r\nthe party, could not manage to clamber up the side.  A ladder was\r\ntherefore let down, and two seamen descending carried up Mrs Hart and\r\nthen her husband.  The boys followed, old Tom being the last to leave\r\nthe boat, which was then hoisted up, but almost fell to pieces in the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\"You people have had a narrow escape,\" observed the captain, as he\r\nexamined the boat.  \"You and your wife can have a cabin, though I am not\r\nfond of missionaries, I tell you,\" he observed, turning to Mr Hart.\r\n\"The rest can manage to shift for'ard among the men.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be grateful for any accommodation you will afford my wife and\r\nme,\" said Mr Hart.  \"You see how much she requires attention;\" and he\r\npointed to his wife, who was seated on a hencoop almost fainting.  \"I\r\nwould ask you, too, to allow those two young gentlemen to live in the\r\ncabin; one is a captain's son, the other an apprentice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they can shift for themselves well enough forward,\" answered the\r\ncaptain, gruffly.  \"We are bound for the Sandwich Islands, which I hope\r\nto make in the course of a couple of weeks, and we shall then part\r\ncompany, as you will then be able to find a vessel to carry you wherever\r\nyou may wish to go.  I cannot undertake charge of you for a longer\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"All I can say is that we shall be grateful to you for preserving our\r\nlives; for I believe, humanly speaking, we should have perished before\r\nmany days had elapsed,\" said Mr Hart.  \"I do not at present see how we\r\ncan repay you, but if I have the power be assured I will gladly do so.\"\r\n\r\nThe crew, though rough in appearance and rough spoken, paid every\r\nattention in their power to old Tom and his companions, and put them\r\ninto their berths, where they all in a few minutes fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nNext day Harry and Bass, having somewhat recovered, crawled on deck.\r\nThey learned that the ship was the _Swordfish_; that Captain Boucher,\r\nthe master, was an odd-tempered man, and that, as she had been out more\r\nthan a year and caught but few whales, and had of late had nothing but\r\nill-luck, he was in an especial bad humour.  The captain was walking up\r\nand down, abusing the officers, who behaved in the same way towards the\r\nmen, while the latter growled in return and performed their work in a\r\nsulky way.\r\n\r\nHarry was afraid that poor Mr and Mrs Hart would be neglected, and,\r\nwaiting till the captain was quiet, humbly asked leave to be allowed to\r\ngo down and pay them a visit.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want with them?\" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n\"They are my friends,\" said Harry, \"and I wish to see if they require\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you go below you shall wait upon them and on me too, youngster.  My\r\ncabin-boy fell overboard the other day, and I want another.\"\r\n\r\n\"While I remain on board I will do as you wish,\" answered Harry, glad to\r\nhave the means of being of service to his friends.\r\n\r\nHe found them in a small cabin--poor Mrs Hart still very weak and ill,\r\nand Mr Hart seated by her side, though much requiring rest himself.\r\n\r\nOne of the men who had taken in the captain's breakfast had brought them\r\nsome, but they had received no other attention, while they had heard the\r\ncaptain abusing missionaries as a useless, idle set who never did any\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nHarry set about the duty he had undertaken with alacrity, though for\r\nsome days he had great difficulty in moving about.  He said nothing when\r\nthe captain abused him as an idle young dog, but did his best to do as\r\nhe was required.  He spread the table as he had seen it arranged on\r\nboard the _Steadfast_, and tried to keep the cabin in good order.  He\r\nwas constant in his attendance on Mr and Mrs Hart, though he had often\r\na difficulty in obtaining proper food for them from the cook.\r\n\r\nDickey was anxious to assist him, and proposed to ask the captain's\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure he would not grant it,\" said Harry; \"he would only say that\r\none boy is more than enough, and that we should be playing tricks\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nHarry could not help acknowledging that he had an uncomfortable life of\r\nit; but he willingly bore all the captain's abuse for the sake of his\r\nfriends, and his chief consolation was to remain in their cabin and to\r\nlisten to Mr Hart's conversation.  The captain, however, who at length\r\none day found he was there, ordered him on deck.\r\n\r\n\"What are you and that man plotting about?\" he asked, abusing him as an\r\nidle young dog.  \"I'll give you work to do;\" and Harry was sent to\r\nassist Bass in blacking down the rigging.\r\n\r\nAfter that the captain kept him constantly employed in the dirtiest work\r\nabout the ship.\r\n\r\nHarry bore this treatment without murmuring.\r\n\r\n\"I only wish that the voyage was over,\" he remarked to Bass.  \"Still,\r\nwhatever he does, we should be thankful to him for saving our lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not so certain that he will let us go free, even when we reach the\r\nSandwich Islands,\" answered Bass.  \"The men say he will swear we are\r\napprentices, and keep us on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't let him suppose that you think so.  If we have our wits about us\r\nwe may make our escape,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\nDay after day the wind continued light, and the voyage was prolonged.\r\nThe captain treated the boys in the same tyrannical way as at first.\r\nHarry could only exchange a few words with his friends when he took them\r\ntheir meals; he was thankful that the captain had not deprived him of\r\nthe opportunity of doing so.\r\n\r\n\"It is our duty, my dear Harry, to bear with ill-treatment,\" observed\r\nMr Hart.  \"It is hard to do so, but let us pray for grace, and we shall\r\nnot seek it in vain.\"\r\n\r\nAt length the Island of Oahu, in which the capital Honolulu is situated,\r\nwas sighted.  As the ship approached the harbour, and Harry and Bass\r\nwere congratulating themselves that their emancipation drew near, the\r\ncaptain ordered them to go down into the cabin.  When there they found\r\nthemselves suddenly seized by two of the mates, who thrust them into a\r\nsmall side cabin.\r\n\r\n\"You will remain there; and take care that you make no noise,\" said one\r\nof the mates.  \"When we are at sea again you will be let out.\"  The poor\r\nboys expostulated in vain.  The door was locked upon them, and they were\r\nleft in almost total darkness.\r\n\r\n\"I told you so,\" said Bass.  \"I was sure he meant us mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very sure that Mr Hart will make every effort to obtain our\r\nrelease,\" observed Harry.  \"So will old Tom; and I should think the\r\ncaptain would scarcely venture to detain him.\"\r\n\r\nIn a short time they heard the anchor let go, and they knew that the\r\nship had entered the harbour.  They waited in the hope that Mr Hart\r\nwould discover where they were and come at least to speak to them, but\r\nnight came on and they were left alone.  They had to coil themselves up\r\nand go to sleep.\r\n\r\nNext morning the first mate opened the door and put in some breakfast,\r\nsaying that it would be worse for them if they made any noise.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed by and they were thus kept in durance.  They heard\r\nat different times voices in the cabin; but not knowing who the speakers\r\nwere, they were afraid of crying out.  At last they knew by the\r\nmovements of the ship that she was once more under way; and shortly\r\nafterwards the mate came to the door and told them that they might go on\r\ndeck to attend to their duty.  Greatly to their satisfaction, they saw\r\nold Tom.  He made a sign to them not to speak to him and turned away.\r\n\r\nThey waited till it was dark.  He then came up to them as they were\r\nstanding together.\r\n\r\n\"I discovered that the captain had shut you up,\" he said; \"and I did all\r\nI could to get him to allow you to go on shore, but he said that he had\r\na right to detain you, and I of course would not leave the ship without\r\nyou.  We must therefore watch for an opportunity of getting on shore at\r\nsome place where English authority is established, and we can make\r\ncomplaints of the way you have been treated.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather land among savages than remain on board,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"And so would I,\" exclaimed Bass.  \"And if you will come with us we will\r\ntry to escape at the first place we touch at.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must learn what sort of a place it is first,\" said old Tom, \"or we\r\nmay be worse off than we are on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will talk about that by-and-by,\" said Harry.  \"I am very anxious to\r\nknow what has become of Mr and Mrs Hart.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thankful to say they are among friends,\" answered old Tom.\r\n\"Missionaries have been for some time settled in these islands, and the\r\nking and a considerable number of his people have become Christians.\r\nMr Hart did not forget you either, and he came on board to try and\r\nlearn what had become of you.  The captain must have deceived him, and\r\npersuaded him that you were no longer in the ship.  He was coming off\r\nagain just as we were getting under way, and the captain would not then\r\nallow him to come up the side.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thankful, at all events, to hear that our friends are safe,\" said\r\nHarry; \"and we must try to make the best of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a wise resolution, Harry,\" said Tom.  \"Even though the captain\r\nshould continue to ill-treat you, behave as you have hitherto done, and\r\neven his hard heart may be softened.  However, we must not be found\r\ntalking together, so now go and turn into your berths, and try and get a\r\nbetter night's rest than you could have had in that close cabin.\"\r\n\r\nHarry and Bass followed old Tom's advice; and next morning when they\r\ncame on deck they found that the ship was off the magnificent coast of\r\nthe large island of Hawaii, with the two lofty mountains, Mouna Kea and\r\nMouna Roa, rising far off.\r\n\r\nThe weather looked threatening, and in a short time a heavy gale began\r\nto blow.  The wind increased in fury till it became a perfect hurricane.\r\nThe sails were closely reefed.  The captain endeavoured to beat out to\r\nsea, as there was no port under his lee into which he could run.\r\nNotwithstanding all the efforts made to keep off the land, the ship\r\ndrove closer and closer to it.  A terrific line of breakers could be\r\nseen dashing on the shore.  Should the ship be driven among them, her\r\ndestruction would be certain; and there was little hope of an anchor a\r\nholding to save her from her impending fate.  To avoid this, sail was\r\nkept on the ship, though, under any other circumstances, with an open\r\nsea before her, she would have been running under bare poles.\r\n\r\nHarry and Bass were standing together.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of it, Tom?\" asked Harry, as the old man came up to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Badly enough, as far as this world is concerned,\" answered old Tom.\r\n\"Happy are those who are prepared to enter another world, as I know you\r\nare, and I hope Mr Bass is too.  He who died for us is ready to welcome\r\nus there, if we are trusting to Him alone down here, and not to our own\r\nstrength and doings, however good our fellow-men may think us.  That's\r\nmy comfort, whatever happens, though for your sakes, and that of the\r\npoor fellows aboard, I pray we may escape.  I cannot say, however, that\r\nI see much prospect of it.  If the worst comes, do you boys stick by me,\r\nand I will do my best to save your lives.\"\r\n\r\nThe ship drifted nearer and nearer the shore.  The captain and mates,\r\nhardy and bold as they were, looked pale and anxious, now gazing up at\r\nthe bending masts, now at the shore under their lee.\r\n\r\n\"If we get a slant of wind we may do it yet,\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"But if not?\" observed the first mate.\r\n\r\n\"We must let go our anchors, and cut away the masts.  There is nothing\r\nelse to be done,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nThe hoped-for change of wind did not come.\r\n\r\n\"Let go the best bower,\" shouted the captain.  \"Stand by with the axes.\"\r\n\r\nThe order was obeyed.  The ship for a moment rode head to wind.  At the\r\nsame instant the men, with gleaming axes in their hands, were seen\r\ncutting away at the masts.\r\n\r\nTom led his young friends under shelter of the poop deck.\r\n\r\nDown came the masts with a crash.  Not a hundred fathoms astern the sea\r\nin wild masses was breaking furiously.  The next instant the anchor\r\nparted; another was let go, but it scarcely held for a moment; and then\r\nthe ship drove broadside into the midst of the wild, raging tumult of\r\nwaters.  Now she rose for a moment on the summit of a huge wave, now\r\nborne onwards she sank into a hollow between the waves.  The next sea\r\nswept her decks, carrying many of the hapless crew overboard, and\r\nwashing away the caboose and a large portion of the bulwarks.\r\n\r\nBy Tom's advice Harry and Bass clung to a stanchion near which they had\r\ntaken their post.  Tom held on to another near them.\r\n\r\nAnother sea struck the devoted ship, and threw her with tremendous force\r\non the coral rocks, crushing in her bottom and sides.  Others of the\r\ncrew were carried off as the seas continued to strike her.  Now portions\r\nof her bows, now the remainder of her bulwarks, were swept away, while\r\non each occasion the fearful crashing and rending of timbers showed that\r\nshe was rapidly breaking up.\r\n\r\n\"What had we best do?\" asked Bass.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on to the last,\" answered Harry; \"perhaps the gale may abate, and\r\nwe may yet reach the shore.\"\r\n\r\nThere seemed, however, but little hope of their doing this.  Every\r\ninstant larger portions of the wreck were carried away.  It was evident\r\nthat in a short time she would break up completely.  Tom handed to each\r\nof the boys a length of rope.\r\n\r\n\"Make yourselves fast to any piece of timber you can get hold of,\" he\r\nsaid; \"it will give you the best chance of safety.\"\r\n\r\nFew of the people had by this time escaped, and every sea which broke\r\nover the wreck carried one or more away.\r\n\r\nAt length another tremendous sea came rolling towards them.  A fearful\r\ncrash followed.  Harry and Bass found themselves floating together amid\r\nthe boiling waters, with pieces of wreck tossed to and fro near them, a\r\nblow from which would have proved fatal, but not one struck them.  Not\r\nfar off they caught sight of Tom clinging to a portion of the poop deck.\r\nA sea carried them towards him.  He hauled them up, and they made\r\nthemselves fast to some ring-bolts.  Though the seas washed over them,\r\nand they felt as if the breath would be knocked out of their bodies,\r\nthey were not carried off; and they found that their raft was being\r\ndriven rapidly towards the shore, now scarcely a quarter of a mile from\r\nthem.  Every instant they expected the raft to be turned over and over,\r\nbut it floated as before, and, now lifted high on the summit of a\r\nbreaker, and now sunk down into the hollow of the sea, went on and on\r\ntill they felt it ground on the beach.\r\n\r\nTom told them to cast themselves adrift, when, seizing each by the arm,\r\nhe dragged them forward, and in another instant they were on dry ground.\r\n\r\n\"Praise God for His mercy!  We are safe!\" cried Tom.  \"But now, boys,\r\nlet us see if we can help any of our shipmates.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked along the beach on either hand, but for some minutes they\r\ncould discover no one.\r\n\r\n\"There is a man!\" at length cried Tom.  \"I caught sight of his head and\r\nhand among the foam.\"\r\n\r\nThey ran in the direction Tom pointed, waiting anxiously, in the hope of\r\ndragging the man out of the surf as it broke on the shore.  Tom rushed\r\nin and seized him, as for an instant he was thrown on the beach, or the\r\nreceding waves would have carried him back.  The boys assisted Tom.\r\nThey recognised the features of the captain, but the hue of death was on\r\nhis face.  His arms fell down as they placed him on the ground.\r\n\r\n\"He has gone!\" cried Tom.\r\n\r\nThey did what they could to revive him, but life was extinct.\r\n\r\nTwo other bodies were washed up, but not a human being besides\r\nthemselves reached the shore alive.  They looked around them.  The whole\r\nbay into which they had been thrown presented a scene of barren wildness\r\nand grandeur.  A valley opened up from it, and in the distance rose the\r\nsummit of a lofty volcano, the stream of lava from which had caused the\r\ndesolation they saw around.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad we have got ashore alive; but I am afraid we shall die of\r\nhunger if we cannot manage to get out of this soon,\" said Bass.\r\n\r\n\"He who brought us on shore will take care of us,\" observed Tom.  \"But\r\nwe must do our best.  The sooner we set off to look for some natives the\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\n\"If there are any Christians about here, we are sure, if we can find\r\nthem, to be treated kindly.\"\r\n\r\nHaving examined the coast as far as they could see on either hand, they\r\nagreed to move to the east, in which direction some green shrubs and\r\ntrees were distinguishable.  As they all felt weak and exhausted, there\r\nwas no time to be lost.\r\n\r\n\"Won't it be well to get hold of something to defend ourselves if we are\r\nattacked?\" said Bass.  \"I should like to have a club to fight with.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be no use, Mr Bass,\" answered Tom.  \"We must try to make\r\nfriends with the natives; I have no fear about the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor have I,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\nTom and the two boys made their way along the shore.  Sometimes they had\r\nto climb over rocks, sometimes to wade through black sand.  At length\r\nthey reached a firmer beach, and got on better than at first.\r\n\r\nThe day was wearing on.  They had had nothing to eat or drink since the\r\nprevious evening.  They all felt faint and hungry.\r\n\r\nAt length they caught sight of a stream of sparkling water trickling\r\ndown the rocks.  How eagerly they drank of it!  It revived them, and\r\nthey pushed on.  They were anxious to fall in with natives before dark\r\nwho might give them food and shelter.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the country rapidly improved.  At last, after climbing\r\nsome rocks, they found themselves looking down into a beautiful bay, on\r\nthe shore of which a number of women and girls were collected, who, from\r\nthe way they were employed in combing their dark hair or dressing their\r\nheads with flowers, had apparently just come out of the water.\r\n\r\nOn seeing the three strangers several of the girls shrieked out.  Among\r\nthem was a tall, dignified-looking person, who, on observing Tom and the\r\nboys approaching, rose from the ground on which she had been seated and\r\nadvanced towards them.  To their surprise, she addressed them in broken\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n\"Who you? where you come from?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nTom replied that they were English, and had escaped from their ship,\r\nwhich had been wrecked some way along the coast.\r\n\r\n\"And, please, marm,\" he added, \"we are very hungry, especially these two\r\nboys, and shall be thankful if you will give us some food as soon as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not more hungry than he is,\" said Harry; \"but he always thinks\r\nmore of us than of himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady smiled and made signs to them to accompany her, evidently\r\nunderstanding what they said, though she herself had soon apparently\r\nexhausted her stock of English words.  She led the way, followed by her\r\nmaidens.\r\n\r\nClimbing the rocks, which were easily surmounted, they found themselves\r\nin a level country with trees growing luxuriantly, while plantations of\r\nvarious descriptions were seen in every direction.  At a little distance\r\nwas a cottage, which, though built after the native fashion, was of\r\nconsiderable size.\r\n\r\n\"There is my house,\" said the lady, pointing to it.  \"You welcome food,\r\nplenty sleep till to-morrow, and praise Jehovah.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! marm, if I may make so bold to ask, are you a Christian?\"\r\nexclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\nThe lady nodded and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"You Christian too, I hope?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"That I am, marm, and so are these boys,\" answered Tom.\r\n\r\n\"I told you all would be right, Harry,\" he added.  \"You see we could not\r\nhave fallen into better hands.\"\r\n\r\nOn reaching the house, the girls, by the directions of their mistress,\r\nhurried to prepare food, and several dishes of fish and fruits were soon\r\nplaced on mats on the floor.  Before bidding her guests to eat, the\r\nlady, who had been sitting, rose and said a grace in her own language,\r\nadding a few words of English.  Tom and the boys uttered \"Amen,\" at\r\nwhich she seemed pleased, and she then served each of them with her own\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she saw that her guests had eaten enough, she assembled her\r\nfamily and attendants, who seated themselves before her; she read to\r\nthem the Bible in her own language, and then offered up a prayer.  After\r\nthis, she leading, the rest joined in singing a hymn, the tune of which\r\nTom recognised, though the words were strange to him.  The evening's\r\ndevotions being thus concluded, she led them to a part of the house\r\nscreened off by mats, and bidding them enter, pointed to three beds,\r\nalso covered with matting, which her maidens had in the meantime\r\nprepared for them.\r\n\r\nTheir clothes had been thoroughly dried during their journey.  She\r\nshowed that she had thought of their comfort by presenting each of them\r\nwith some cotton garments, and making them understand that their own\r\nclothes, saturated with the salt water, should be washed and ready for\r\nthem the next day.\r\n\r\n\"We have indeed fallen into good hands, as you say, Mr Hayes,\" observed\r\nHarry, after they had all three knelt down and said their prayers.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt about that,\" answered old Tom.  \"We shall find that a\r\nmissionary has been here; and I hope by his means to gain tidings of our\r\nfriends and be able to rejoin them.\"\r\n\r\nWith this pleasant thought they lay down to rest.  Harry hoped not only\r\nto meet Mr and Mrs Hart again, but to be able to find a ship returning\r\nto England.  He longed once more to be with his dear mother and sister,\r\nand to comfort them in their affliction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nKAPOIOLANI.\r\n\r\nAfter a long sleep, produced by weariness, Tom and the two boys dressed,\r\nand made their appearance before their hostess.  They found an ample\r\nmeal provided for them.  She told them that her name was Kapoiolani,\r\nthat she was the wife of one of the chief men of the island, who had\r\ngone away on a preaching tour with the missionary by whose means she and\r\nher husband had been taught the truth, and begged Tom and the boys to\r\nremain till their return.  This they were very glad to do, as they still\r\nfelt weary, and Bass complained of aches in all his limbs.\r\n\r\nAt every hour of the day people were coming in to receive instructions\r\nfrom Kapoiolani, who was evidently better acquainted with the truths of\r\nChristianity than her neighbours.  She had for some time accepted the\r\ngospel, and showed the deepest earnestness and zeal in making it known\r\nto others.\r\n\r\n\"If people at home, who profess to be true Christians, were as anxious\r\nas this lady is to teach others, there would not be so many poor men and\r\nwomen who sink into their graves without ever having heard of the love\r\nof Christ for sinners,\" observed old Tom.  \"She puts many civilised\r\npeople to shame.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in England there are regular ministers to do that sort of work,\"\r\nobserved Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Every one who loves Christ is a regular minister, to my mind,\" answered\r\nTom; \"and is bound, when he can find the opportunity, to tell others\r\nthat Christ died for them, and that His blood cleanseth from all sin.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope that I may be able to find opportunities when I get home; though\r\nI don't think I shall be able to preach,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\n\"You must make opportunities,\" answered Tom.  \"You can preach in your\r\nlife and daily conversation, in gently speaking a word to those among\r\nwhom you mix.  Souls are won to Christ as much by that as by preachers\r\nin their pulpits; and the only object of preaching is to win souls.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days passed by, when the chief, Kapoiolani's husband, returned,\r\nsaying that the missionary had gone on with some other friend to a\r\ndistant part of the island.\r\n\r\nNaihi, the chief, seemed as zealous and earnest as his wife; and as he\r\nspoke more English than she could, he was able to give his guests a\r\nconsiderable amount of information about the island.  He told them that\r\nthe larger portion of the inhabitants were still heathens, and\r\nworshippers of their great goddess, Pele, whose abode, he said, they\r\nsupposed was in the lofty volcano.\r\n\r\n\"There is need without delay to preach the gospel to them, for our\r\npeople are rapidly passing away; and unless we hasten they may sink into\r\ntheir graves still ignorant heathens as they now are,\" he observed, in a\r\nsolemn and sad tone.\r\n\r\nNaihi, after remaining at home two days, again set off to join his\r\nfriend the missionary.\r\n\r\nTom and the boys wished to accompany him, but he advised them to remain\r\nwith his wife, telling them that the journey was fatiguing; and as they\r\ncould not speak the language of the people, they could be of no use,\r\nwhereas if they remained with Kapoiolani, they might assist her in\r\nacquiring a knowledge of English, which she was anxious to do, so that\r\nshe might read books in that language.  Harry was her chief instructor;\r\nand never was there a more attentive pupil.  He was surprised at the\r\nrapidity with which she learned to read.\r\n\r\nSome time had thus been spent, when there was a commotion in the\r\nvillage, and it was announced that a person of importance was\r\napproaching, no less than the high-priestess of Pele, if not Pele\r\nherself, as the heathen inhabitants asserted.\r\n\r\n\"She is an impostor, and I will prove her to be so!\" exclaimed\r\nKapoiolani, when she heard of it; and, attended by a band of Christians,\r\nshe went out to meet the priestess.\r\n\r\nA woman appeared descending from the hills, dressed in a fantastic way,\r\nwith her robes scorched and partially consumed by fire.  She was\r\nfollowed by a band of women and girls, dressed in the same manner.  As\r\nshe drew near, she shouted with a loud voice that she was come to warn\r\nthe followers of the new faith to be prepared for the fearful punishment\r\nshe was about to inflict on them for deserting their ancient gods.\r\n\r\n\"You are but a miserable woman, and a wretched impostor!\" answered\r\nKapoiolani, in an authoritative tone.  \"The worshippers of Jehovah are\r\nnot to be frightened by your foolish threats.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this the pretended Pele became very indignant, and, drawing a\r\ndocument written on native cloth from her bosom, declared that it would\r\nprove her authority.\r\n\r\n\"It will prove that you yourself cannot write, but some one else has\r\nassisted you in your imposture, and that is all it will prove, foolish\r\nwoman!\" exclaimed Kapoiolani.  \"I have a book which announces that there\r\nare many false gods, among whom is the one you serve, but that there is\r\nonly one true God, Jehovah, whom I serve.  Let me advise you to throw\r\naway your idols, and to turn to Him, I know Pele can do me no harm,\r\nbecause Pele does not really exist, and to prove it I intend to ascend\r\nthe mountain where you say she resides, and to eat the berries which you\r\nhold sacred to her, that when I come back, as I know I shall do,\r\nuninjured, my people may see their folly and turn to the true God.  I\r\nadvise you in the meantime to give up your follies, and to labour\r\nindustriously for your support.\"\r\n\r\nThe pretended priestess and her followers appeared very indignant at\r\nthis; but when Kapoiolani offered them food they gladly partook of it,\r\nthe priestess of Pele herself joining in the feast.  Kapoiolani pointed\r\nher out to her people, remarking, \"If she were a goddess she would not\r\nrequire food; but see, she eats as greedily as any one.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning Kapoiolani, who had long resolved to visit the volcano\r\nKilauea, the supposed abode of Pele, was ready to set out.  She sent\r\nword to her husband and the missionary of her intention, saying that it\r\nwas necessary to do so at once, in order to convince the people of the\r\nimposture of the pretended priestess, and that they might understand\r\nthat Jehovah was the only true God.\r\n\r\nWith this laudable object in view, she was ready to undergo the fatigue\r\nof the journey.  She did not object to old Tom and the two boys\r\nattending her.\r\n\r\n\"My people,\" she said, \"believe that any strangers approaching the\r\ncrater will meet with certain destruction; your going will more easily\r\nconvince them of their folly.\"\r\n\r\nKapoiolani performed her journey on foot, as there were at that time no\r\nhorses in the island, and she objected to be carried by her people.  She\r\nwas attended by a number of persons, with baskets of provisions, who\r\nwere to proceed to the foot of the mountain, while she, with a select\r\nband, proposed mounting to the summit.\r\n\r\nThe country through which they passed was wild and savage in the\r\nextreme.  In some places they had to penetrate through thick woods, in\r\nothers over wide fields of lava.\r\n\r\nAfter many days' journey the base of the mountain was reached.  Resting\r\nfor the night, the next morning at daybreak Kapoiolani and her\r\nattendants, aided by long poles, commenced the ascent.  Some carried\r\nprovisions and others materials for building a hut for the accommodation\r\nof the chieftainess.\r\n\r\nIt was past noon before the edge of the crater was reached, near which\r\ngrew the bushes bearing the supposed sacred berries.  It seemed\r\nsurprising that any vegetation could be produced on such a spot.\r\n\r\nThey now stood on the edge of a vast basin upwards of seven miles in\r\ncircuit and nearly a thousand feet deep.  At the bottom was a level\r\nfloor two miles in length, in the centre of which was a vast lake of\r\nliquid lava, out of which rose numerous cones sending forth jets of\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\nHarry had not imagined the existence of so wild and terrible a scene,\r\nand he was not surprised that the ignorant inhabitants should have\r\nbelieved it the abode of a goddess delighting in fire and heat.\r\n\r\nKapoiolani told him that at times the lake which they saw below them\r\nrose up high above the cones, filling the whole space within a hundred\r\nfeet of the edge with a sea of liquid lava, and that it occasionally\r\nburst its way through the edges, carrying destruction in its course,\r\ntowards the ocean, while at other times new cones arose in the side of\r\nthe mountain, through which the lava burst its way, flowing down in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nHaving plucked some of the berries, Kapoiolani ate them, and desired her\r\nattendants to do the same.\r\n\r\n\"Now watch the lake!\" she exclaimed, extending her hand towards it.\r\n\"Does it rise because we few poor mortals have eaten the fruit which God\r\nallows to grow here?  No!\" she said, lifting her hand, and pointing\r\ntowards heaven.  \"He who lives there, the great Jehovah, has ordained\r\nthat these things should be, for a wise purpose.  There is no such\r\nperson as Pele, whom, in their ignorance, our fathers have worshipped.\r\nYou now understand, my friends, that we have nothing therefore to fear.\"\r\n\r\nWhile some of her attendants were building the hut, Kapoiolani, with old\r\nTom and the boys, and a few other persons, descended the side of the\r\ncrater, where it sloped sufficiently to enable them to make their way.\r\n\r\nThe scene around was wild and sombre in the extreme.  Mighty cliffs of\r\njet black rock were on every side, with the lake of shining lava below\r\nthem, though relieved by the blue sky overhead, to which Kapoiolani\r\nlooked up and pointed.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" she said, \"above us is the glorious heaven, which is to be the\r\nfuture home of believers; below, the dark pit, the dwelling-place of\r\nthose who reject the Lord of light and love.\"\r\n\r\nOn regaining the edge of the crater, they saw several persons\r\napproaching, among whom, to Kapoiolani's great satisfaction, was the\r\nmissionary, accompanied by her husband.\r\n\r\nThe people who followed her, as soon as they saw them, set up a loud\r\nshout of joy; for many of them till then had fully believed that their\r\nchieftainess would have been destroyed by the vengeance of Pele.\r\n\r\nThe missionary now offered up a prayer, and having addressed the people,\r\na hymn was sung.\r\n\r\nThe party remained on the summit of the mountain during the night.  The\r\nearly portion of it was passed by Tom and the boys seated round the fire\r\nwith the missionary, who told them that they would find little\r\ndifficulty in returning to Honolulu, where they would soon, probably,\r\nfind a ship sailing for England.\r\n\r\nWhile they were speaking they were aroused by a brighter light than\r\nusual, and on going to the edge of the crater they perceived that the\r\nnumerous cones, in the centre were now in violent action, some emitting\r\nflame, which darted upwards to a height of fifty and a hundred feet,\r\nwhile boiling lava flowed down the sides of others into the lake, out of\r\nwhich they arose like so many islands.\r\n\r\nKapoiolani came out of the hut to witness the scene.  She remained calm\r\nas before, and quieted the fears of her attendants by observing--\r\n\r\n\"I know in whom I trust.  Even should the lava continue flowing, many\r\ndays must elapse before the crater is full, and long before it is so we\r\nshall be in safety.  Pele has nothing to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nHaving watched the eruption for some time, Kapoiolani and her female\r\nattendants returned to their hut, while the rest of the party gathered\r\nround their camp fires to spend the remainder of the night.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, having plucked more of the berries and again descended\r\nthe crater, they proceeded down the mountain.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the camp where the chief body of her attendants had\r\nremained, she addressed them, and urged them from henceforth to dismiss\r\nall thoughts of the pretended Pele, and other false deities, from their\r\nminds, and to trust alone to Jehovah, the only true God, and His Son\r\nJesus Christ, whom He had sent into the world to die instead of them,\r\nand to reconcile them, His outcast children, to Himself.  With one voice\r\nthe people shouted out, \"There is no such being as Pele; Jehovah is the\r\nonly true God; we will serve Him!\"\r\n\r\nThe news of the pious and heroic Kapoiolani's visit to the mountain of\r\nPele was carried through the island; and the people from henceforth\r\nacknowledged that they had been foolishly frightened by believing in a\r\nbeing who had no existence, and were everywhere ready to listen to the\r\naddresses either of the missionaries or of their own chiefs who had\r\nturned from idols.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable circumstance that in the Sandwich Islands the chiefs\r\nset the example of overturning their idols, and were generally the first\r\nto accept the truth.\r\n\r\nAfter visiting several places on the coast, Kapoiolani and her\r\nattendants, accompanied by Tom and the boys, returned to her village.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nHAPPY RE-UNIONS.\r\n\r\nSeveral weeks passed away, and no vessel appeared in which the voyagers\r\ncould obtain a passage to Honolulu.  They were rapidly acquiring a\r\nknowledge of the language of the island, and Harry and Tom employed much\r\nof their time in instructing the natives.  Bass did not make so much\r\nprogress as the rest, and began to grow very weary of the life he led.\r\n\r\n\"The truth is, Dickey,\" observed Harry to him one day, \"your heart is\r\nnot in the matter.  I wish to reach home, I confess; but if it were not\r\nfor the dear ones there, I should be content to labour on as I am now\r\ndoing.  I never find the day too long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I were like you,\" said Bass; \"but I cannot bring myself to care\r\nabout the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Dickey,\" said Harry, \"you must pray for grace, then, to do what\r\nyou know to be right.  Think of the great value of human souls, and of\r\nthe inestimable price which was paid that they might enjoy the happiness\r\nof heaven, and then you will become more anxious to win them.\"\r\n\r\nBass tried to do as his friend advised, and in a short time he was\r\nalmost as eager as Harry to instruct the natives, and found himself\r\nrapidly acquiring their language to enable him to do so.\r\n\r\nOne day Tom and the two boys set off to visit a village at some distance\r\nalong the coast.  After going some way they saw, by the appearance of\r\nthe sky, that a storm was threatening, but they hoped to reach their\r\ndestination before it broke.  It came on, however, more rapidly than\r\nthey had expected.\r\n\r\nAs they doubled a headland they caught sight of a ship close in with the\r\nland, in nearly the same dangerous position that the _Swordfish_ had\r\nbeen.  Tom stopped and looked at her.\r\n\r\n\"She appears to be a whaler, and pretty full,\" observed Harry.\r\n\r\n\"A whaler she is; there is no doubt about that,\" answered Tom.  \"Just do\r\nyou scan her narrowly, and tell me if you have ever seen a ship like\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Harry, shading his eyes, and gazing at her earnestly.\r\n\"Do you really think she is the _Steadfast_?  She is wonderfully like\r\nher, as far as I can judge at this distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know every yard in her canvas, and the _Steadfast_ she is, I am\r\nnearly as certain as that we three stand here!\" said old Tom, his voice\r\nshowing the unusual agitation he felt.\r\n\r\n\"If she is not, she is very like her,\" observed Bass.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she is--I am certain that she is the _Steadfast_!\" cried Harry.\r\n\"But I wish she were farther off the coast, or she may be driven on the\r\nrocks and lost after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a deep bay two miles on,\" said Tom, \"with a good entrance.  It\r\nmust be down on the chart, and it's my belief the ship is standing for\r\nit.  If the wind holds as it is now she will be safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I pray that the wind will hold, then!\" cried Harry.  \"Oh, my dear\r\nfather!  I little thought to see him again, and Mr Champion, and the\r\nrest.  I cannot believe that they will be lost, now that we are about to\r\nmeet them.\"\r\n\r\n\"God knows what is best--you must always remember that, Harry,\" observed\r\nTom.  \"It is our business, however, to pray for them.  If He thinks fit\r\nHe will grant our prayers; and even though He does not as we may wish,\r\nwe must not doubt His justice and mercy.\"\r\n\r\nRight earnestly Tom and his young companions, as they knelt on the\r\nground, offered up their prayers for the safety of the ship, and then\r\nhurried on towards the harbour of which Tom had spoken.\r\n\r\nThe wind continued increasing.  They saw first one sail and then another\r\nfurled till the ship stood on under close-reefed topsails.  They hurried\r\nforward, every now and then getting a glimpse of her as they reached\r\nsome elevation overlooking the sea.\r\n\r\nThey met several natives, who seemed to sympathise in their anxiety, and\r\naccompanied them towards the harbour.\r\n\r\nThe ship heeled over to the blast.  Still her canvas stood.  Every\r\nmoment, however, they expected to see it blown from the bolt-ropes.\r\n\r\nAt last they were obliged to leave the coast to reach the shore of the\r\nharbour, and now came the most anxious time of all, when they could not\r\nwatch the progress of the ship.  Hurrying on, they arrived at length at\r\na point of land which projected out into the harbour, and made their way\r\nover the rough rocks towards the end.\r\n\r\n\"There she is! there she is!\" shouted Harry, as at that moment he caught\r\nsight of the ship, with her yards squared away, running into the\r\nharbour.\r\n\r\nThe natives, who had accompanied them, got a canoe ready, and Tom and\r\nthe boys jumping into her, their friends paddled away to show the\r\nstranger the best spot for anchoring.  Their signals were understood by\r\nthose on board, and the sails being quickly furled and the anchor let\r\ngo, she rode in safety.\r\n\r\n\"Harry,\" exclaimed old Tom, \"there is no doubt about her being the\r\n_Steadfast_.  I caught sight of Mr Champion on the forecastle, with\r\nmany another well-known face, though I don't think any one recognised\r\nus.  Let me go up the side first, and learn if it is all well with your\r\nfather, and if so tell him that you are safe.  You know we must always\r\nbe ready to say `God's will be done,' and you must be prepared for\r\nwhatever He has ordered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do as you think best, Tom,\" answered Harry.  \"I am sure that is right.\"\r\n\r\nTom climbed up the side.  Directly after reaching the deck he stepped\r\nback and beckoned to the boys.  They quickly climbed up after him.\r\nHarry caught sight of his father talking to Tom.  In another instant he\r\nwas in Captain Graybrook's arms.  Bass, also, was warmly welcomed.  Mr\r\nChampion shortly afterwards came aft, and the three castaways were soon\r\nsurrounded by the remainder of the officers and crew.\r\n\r\nThey had much to recount to each other.  Harry, as clearly as he could,\r\ntold his father all that had happened to them.\r\n\r\n\"We have indeed mourned for you and your companions, Harry, as lost,\"\r\nsaid Captain Graybrook.  \"The ship was almost knocked to pieces, and\r\nafter striking on a reef and having our sails blown to ribbons, we\r\ndrove, with a fearful leak, hardly able to keep the ship afloat, many\r\nhundred leagues to the southward.  At last, mercifully preserved, we\r\nwere able to get safely into a harbour in one of the Samoan islands.  As\r\nsoon as the ship was repaired we made sail to the northward to look for\r\nyou.  On reaching the island off which your boat had last been seen, we\r\nsearched every part of the coast, and went up the only harbour in it,\r\nwhere we hoped that you might have taken shelter, but finding no traces\r\nof you, we at length gave you up for lost.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I should have died of grief, but my friend Champion afforded\r\nme comfort from a source of which, till then, I was ignorant.  He told\r\nme of the love of Jesus, and that he felt sure that you had accepted the\r\noffers of salvation, and if it had been God's will to take you to\r\nHimself, that you were safe with Him in heaven, where you were free from\r\nall the troubles and trials of life, and that I might look forward to\r\nthe certainty of meeting you there, with your dear mother and sister, if\r\nI, too, would yield my stubborn heart to Him.  My friend spoke\r\nfaithfully and firmly, and at length, by grace, through faith in the\r\nblood of Jesus Christ, I became reconciled to that loving God, and\r\nassured that He orders all things for the best.\r\n\r\n\"We have lately been very successful in fishing, and, having got a full\r\nship, were about to return home, but, requiring fresh provisions, I\r\ndetermined to touch at the Sandwich Islands for the sake of obtaining\r\nthem, little dreaming of the surprise in store for me.\r\n\r\n\"When writing to your poor mother I had not the heart to tell her that I\r\nhad given up all hope of finding you, though it was necessary to prepare\r\nher for the worst, and I have told her of your boat being driven away\r\nfrom the ship.  I have dreaded the time when I must tell her the sad\r\nnews that you were, as I supposed, lost to us.  What joy it will be to\r\ntake you back with me, and to set the minds of your dear mother and\r\nsister at rest about your safety!\"\r\n\r\nWhat Harry said in return need not be repeated.  He told his father,\r\nhowever, that he was anxious, before returning home, to let Mr and Mrs\r\nHart know of his and Tom's and Bass's safety, and to thank Kapoiolani\r\nand her husband for their kindness.\r\n\r\nAs the gale threatened to keep the ship in harbour for some days, Tom\r\noffered to go back with a message to their native friends, and set off\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nAs a sufficient supply of provisions, and especially certain stores,\r\ncould best be obtained at Honolulu, Captain Graybrook, greatly to\r\nHarry's satisfaction, had determined to touch there before commencing\r\nthe homeward voyage.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards several canoes were seen coming off to the ship.  In\r\none of them were Kapoiolani and Naihi.\r\n\r\nThey came, they said, to beg that the captain would bear a message to\r\nthe missionary, Mr Hart, and his wife, requesting that they would come\r\nand reside with them, that they might instruct their people in the\r\ngospel.  A house should be built for them, and a church and schools, and\r\nthey should be amply provided with food and all things they might\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\n\"We have wealth in abundance,\" observed Kapoiolani, \"and we cannot\r\nemploy that wealth so well as in supporting those who are working to\r\nmake known the truth to our perishing fellow-countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Graybrook gladly undertook to carry the message, promising, if\r\npossible, to bring Mr and Mrs Hart to the island.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Honolulu, which the _Steadfast_ did in a few days\r\nafterwards, Harry was delighted to find that his friends were willing to\r\naccept the invitation; and the stores and provisions being soon\r\nobtained, the ship returned with them on board to Hawaii.\r\n\r\nOn landing at Kapoiolani's village, Mr and Mrs Hart found that a house\r\nwas already prepared for their reception, and that a church was\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nOld Tom said that he felt very much inclined to remain with them; but\r\nthe ship was short-handed.\r\n\r\n\"It's my duty to stay on board; there is no doubt about that,\" he\r\nobserved; \"and I am sure that a man does no good when he deserts his\r\nfirst duty for the sake of doing anything else, however right that may\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough several natives had been engaged, the addition of the two lads\r\nand Tom to the strength of the crew was very welcome.\r\n\r\nHarry and his companion, having bidden farewell to the Christian chief\r\nand his wife, and their many other friends, prepared to embark.  Mr\r\nHart accompanied them to the beach.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Harry,\" he said, \"I trust that, when far away from this place,\r\nyou will not forget the long-benighted savages inhabiting the numberless\r\nislands of the vast Pacific.  You will have many opportunities of\r\ntelling people at home of their condition, and perhaps may be the means\r\nof inducing some fitted for the task to come out and labour in the\r\nglorious work of making known the gospel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I will, Mr Hart,\" answered Harry; \"and, if my father will\r\npermit me, I will return here as soon as possible myself.  I love a sea\r\nlife, but would thankfully employ myself, when I possess more knowledge,\r\nin spreading the gospel among the islanders.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may possibly combine both objects,\" answered Mr Hart.  \"Missionary\r\nships to convey missionaries from place to place, and to visit them as\r\noften as practicable, are much required, and it is most important that\r\nthey should be officered by Christian men; and you may be doing good\r\nservice if you obtain a berth on board one, and ultimately be able to\r\ntake the command.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is exactly what I feel I ought to do,\" said Harry, as he pressed\r\nhis friend's hand; \"I will pray that I may be directed aright in the\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\nAway the _Steadfast_ sailed on her homeward voyage.  Harry, to his great\r\nsatisfaction, soon found that Mr Champion had resolved to try to induce\r\nhis friends at home, or one of the missionary societies, to send out a\r\nmission ship, of which he purposed offering to take the command.\r\n\r\n\"And I will go with you as mate,\" exclaimed Harry.  \"That will indeed be\r\ndelightful, and I am sure my father will agree to it; and, from what he\r\nhas said to me lately, I do not think he intends to come to sea again.\"\r\n\r\nOn speaking to his father, Harry found that he was right in his\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\n\"I had, however, intended giving the command of the _Steadfast_ to\r\nChampion, as I have long known he wishes to make your sister Hannah his\r\nwife; and allowing her to accompany him, with you as his second mate, as\r\nI feel sure she and the ship will be well taken care of.  However,\r\nthough there is no doubt that Champion would make a much better income\r\nin command of the _Steadfast_ than as captain of a mission ship, yet I\r\nwill not thwart his views, if he resolves to do as you tell me he\r\nwishes.\"\r\n\r\nFrequently during the voyage the subject was discussed; and though\r\nformerly Captain Graybrook would have thought his young mate mad to\r\nentertain such a notion, he now cordially entered into his views, and it\r\nwas settled that Hannah should decide what was to be done.\r\n\r\nAt length the _Steadfast_, freighted with the richest cargo Captain\r\nGraybrook had ever brought into port, was safely at anchor.  As soon as\r\nhe could leave the ship, accompanied by Harry, he hastened home.\r\n\r\nThe deep anxiety Mrs Graybrook and Hannah long had felt was set at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nMr Champion, directly his duties allowed him, joined them.  Hannah\r\ndiscovered the all-important change which had taken place in his mind.\r\nShe no longer hesitated to promise him her hand.\r\n\r\nHe told her of the heathen state of the people inhabiting the countless\r\nisles of the Pacific, of the earnest wish he entertained of being\r\ninstrumental in carrying the gospel among them, of the offer her father\r\nhad made to him of the command of the _Steadfast_, and of his own wish\r\nto command a missionary ship, or to engage still more directly in the\r\nglorious work by going out as a minister of the gospel.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that you may be as usefully employed in following your\r\nprofession as in the latter work, but on whichever you decide I am ready\r\nto accompany you,\" was Hannah's answer.\r\n\r\nAs no missionary vessel was ready, Leonard Champion, soon after his\r\nmarriage, took command of the _Steadfast_, and, accompanied by his wife,\r\nwith Harry and Dickey Bass as his mates, and Tom Hayes as boatswain,\r\nmade two voyages to the Pacific; and while acting as the father of his\r\ncrew, and bringing many to a knowledge of the truth, he was the means,\r\nby touching whenever he could at missionary stations, of rendering much\r\nassistance to those engaged in the most glorious of enterprises; while,\r\nby the example he and his crew set, and by the efforts he made at every\r\nheathen place at which he touched, he gained the goodwill of the\r\ninhabitants, and disposed them to think favourably of Christianity.\r\n\r\nAt length, having given up the _Steadfast_, he obtained the command of a\r\nmission ship, though he had in the meantime succeeded to a good\r\nproperty; and conveyed many missionaries to the stations to which they\r\nwere appointed.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Captain and Mrs Graybrook, he and his wife settled in\r\none of the larger islands of the Pacific, where, with Harry and Bass,\r\nwho shortly afterwards joined them, they have laboured faithfully on\r\ntill they have seen most of the inhabitants converted to the truth.\r\n\r\nOld Tom resided with them, labouring devotedly to the last, till he was\r\ncalled away to hear the words, \"Well done, thou good and faithful\r\nservant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee\r\nruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Voyage of the \"Steadfast\", by W.H.G.
