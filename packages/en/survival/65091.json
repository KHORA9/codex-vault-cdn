Lat. 47·45, and about 85 miles north of the town\r\nof Sudbury. It includes an area of 350 square miles, most of which lies\r\nbetween the two large branches of the Montreal river, which empties into\r\nLake Timiskaming on the west side.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           STATEMENT OF WORK.\r\n\r\nThe Algoma-Nipissing boundary line was run in 1897 by Alexander Niven,\r\nO.L.S. These surveys, with representations of some of the larger lakes,\r\nhad been compiled by the Geological Survey of Canada on a scale of 16\r\nmiles to one inch;[1] and on a scale of eight miles by the Crown Lands\r\nDepartment of Ontario. With these as a guide and summary of the existing\r\ngeographical knowledge it was decided to make a micrometer and prismatic\r\ncompass survey of both branches.\r\n\r\nDuring the past season a prismatic compass and micrometer survey was\r\nmade of both branches of the Montreal river and all navigable waters\r\nadjoining them. This work was done by Messrs. T. Firth, J. R. Marshall\r\nand A. B. Moffatt. Most of the small ponds lying some distance from a\r\ncanoe route were located by rapid chain and compass methods, and in a\r\nfew instances west of Duncan lake by a compass triangulation from\r\nhilltops; the larger ones have been measured by pacing or chaining, the\r\nsmaller ones sketched. Some of the more prominent hills were located by\r\ntriangulation, and their heights ascertained by aneroid determinations.\r\nThe water levels were obtained in the same way, but cannot as yet be\r\nreferred to sea-level.\r\n\r\nThe geological work was performed by the writer, assisted by Mr. Firth.\r\nBesides a thorough examination of all the surveyed routes, a systematic\r\nexamination of the intervening country was carried out as closely as the\r\ntime and varied requirements of the area would permit. As this was the\r\nfirst season spent in the district and a continuation of the work is\r\nanticipated, the present results are offered as incomplete and subject\r\nto revision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENT.\r\n\r\nSince the discovery of silver cobalt ores at Cobalt in 1903, exploration\r\nhas shown the adjacent country to be locally enriched by mineral veins\r\nof the same character and genesis. At the close of 1907 an area 65 miles\r\nlong in a north and south direction, and about 45 miles wide, extending\r\nfrom Lake Timiskaming and the Ontario-Quebec boundary westward, was\r\nknown to include at least ten mineralized districts besides the\r\nprincipal one at Cobalt, of which the most recently found lie near the\r\nMontreal river. It has also become known gradually that these deposits\r\nare closely connected with the post-Huronian quartz diabase of the\r\nregion. This diabase was known to extend for a very considerable\r\ndistance farther west, leading to the inference that more discoveries\r\nwere to be expected in that direction. The spring of 1908 saw interest\r\ncentred upon the Montreal River finds, and early in the season active\r\nexploration had commenced. The Montreal river, up to that time, had not\r\nbeen regarded with special favour, the diabase being considered of no\r\neconomic importance, but with the new conceptions gained by exploitation\r\nof the silver-cobalt district, this formation in the west began to\r\nattract attention. At the beginning of the field work, early in July, a\r\nconsiderable number of prospecting parties were on the ground, as far\r\nwest as Duncan and Pigeon lakes. During July and August this movement,\r\nencouraged by the succession of mineral discoveries that were being made\r\nnear Bloom and Everett lakes, increased steadily, in spite of the\r\nscarcity of available topographical and geological information dealing\r\nwith the region.\r\n\r\nEarly in August discoveries of native silver were made almost\r\nsimultaneously by Messrs. Mann and associates, and by Messrs. Crawford\r\nand Dobie on the west side of Gowganda lake, but were not made public\r\nuntil the first week in September when the claims were recorded at Elk\r\nLake and specimens were exhibited. Twenty-four hours later the leading\r\ncanoes of an inrushing body of prospectors had reached the new field,\r\nand within two weeks most of the promising country between Gowganda and\r\nElkhorn lakes and northward had been staked, regardless of the mineral\r\ndiscoveries necessary to validate the claims. Since then numerous\r\ndiscoveries have been made, and the news of a new silver field, until\r\nrecently confined to the Montreal River and Cobalt districts, has spread\r\nwidely. As a consequence, a mid-winter rush is now in progress, and\r\nhundreds of prospectors, regardless of deep snow and severe cold, are\r\nentering the country. Much inadvisable staking will be done, no doubt,\r\nbefore spring, but the disappearance of the snow and reopening of river\r\nnavigation will certainly be followed by an increased rush of\r\nprospectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results obtained from the field work indicate that the Montreal\r\nRiver district does not differ essentially from the Cobalt or other\r\nneighbouring districts. The surface has the same rugged monotony of the\r\npre-Cambrian peneplain, relieved somewhat by ridges of Huronian, which\r\nstand from 300 to 550 feet above the general level. The country is well\r\nwatered, and offers exceptional facilities for canoe travel. Pleistocene\r\ndeposits are thin, and nearly everywhere the rock formations are well\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nA basement complex underlies the entire region, either appearing at the\r\nsurface or hidden beneath areas of Huronian sediments. This basement\r\nconsists largely of Laurentian biotite and hornblende gneisses, with\r\npatches of vertically foliated, Keewatin schists caught up in the\r\nformer; the intervening contacts forming indefinite zones, in which\r\nintrusive action is manifested. In this report, for convenience, this\r\ncomplex will be referred to as the Archæan. The Archæan possessed a\r\npeneplanated surface, not greatly different from the present one, which\r\nis well preserved where overlain by erosion remnants of Huronian\r\nsedimentary rocks, but which at other points has been further denuded.\r\nThe Lower Huronian rocks are of clastic nature, consisting in ascending\r\norder, of conglomerate, greywacke, slate and quartzite, which pass\r\nconformably into an upper conglomerate; while a granite-like, arkose\r\nmember is believed from its similarity to rocks of the same character in\r\nthe Cobalt area, to be possibly of later, Middle Huronian age. They are\r\nremarkably well preserved, and show only slight indication of\r\ndisturbance. A later intrusion of quartz diabase has developed a system\r\nof dikes in the Archæan and large tongue-shaped areas in the Huronian\r\nbelieved to represent sills of several hundred feet thickness, lying in\r\nthe bedding planes of the Huronian sediments. The diabase magma has been\r\nnotably differentiated, giving rise to forms ranging from gabbroid to\r\nsyenitic in composition, and to younger aplite dikes. With the diabase\r\nis associated a group of veins containing an association of cobalt and\r\nsilver ore identical with that of Cobalt and vicinity. The veins cut\r\nboth diabase and aplite as well as the Huronian, and are therefore\r\nyounger, but probably not much younger than the aplite, since it\r\ncontains some of the minerals found in them. The distribution of the\r\nveins so far as known is confined to the larger diabase areas, the dikes\r\nand smaller bodies being undifferentiated and unmineralized; but the\r\nHuronian adjacent to the diabase also contains veins, somewhat more\r\nsiliceous, yet evidently of the same age as the others. Alteration and\r\nimpregnation of the country rock has taken place to an unknown, but,\r\npresumably, limited extent. Some of the veins are remarkably rich, and\r\nmany of them occupy persistent, well defined fissures. The cause of\r\nthese fissures is not yet known, but they appear to be too large and\r\ncontinuous to have resulted from contraction alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     GENERAL CHARACTER OF DISTRICT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MEANS OF ACCESS.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 the most used route to the Montreal River district started from\r\nLatchford, a station on the Timiskaming and Northern Ontario railway, 93\r\nmiles north of North Bay. From this village, situated on the Montreal\r\nriver, a line of small steamers made daily trips up the river for 56\r\nmiles to Elk lake. This up-river terminus was then a rapidly growing\r\nvillage. In the spring of 1907 it consisted of a single shack and a\r\ncluster of prospectors’ tents; when seen in October, 1908, it had a\r\npopulation of over 200 people and all the conveniences of a village of\r\nthat size, including a post office with regular mail service, a mining\r\nrecorder’s office, lately removed from Latchford, general stores,\r\nhotels, etc.\r\n\r\nFrom this point, which forms the headquarters and point of departure for\r\nMontreal River prospecting parties, a variety of routes lead westward.\r\nThe Montreal river may be ascended to the Forks, where its two branches\r\nunite, but the stream is rapid, and, especially in high water, difficult\r\nof ascent, besides offering a very indirect route to the most frequented\r\ndistricts. The Bloom Lake route, a map of which accompanies the Report\r\nof the Bureau of Mines, Ontario, 1907, was, during 1908, very commonly\r\nused. This route, 9 miles in length and consisting of a chain of small\r\nlakes and portages, leads, from a point on the main river 11 miles above\r\nElk Lake, directly west to the East branch. From the East branch a\r\nmultiplicity of courses are open. Both East and West branches are easily\r\nnavigable, being for the most part lake-like and sluggish, broken by\r\noccasional swift river-like stretches in which rapids occur. Good\r\nportages exist at all these places so that travel either up or down\r\nstream presents no difficulty. Numerous good canoe routes connect the\r\ntwo branches and Duncan and Pigeon lakes, and allow of easy access to\r\nthe country in the west.\r\n\r\nBut since the writer left the field the great influx of prospectors has\r\ncaused marked improvements in the connexion of the area, especially the\r\nGowganda district, with outside railway points. A sleigh road has been\r\nopened from Charlton on the Timiskaming and Northern Ontario railway to\r\nElk Lake, and thence about 32 miles south-westward to the east shore of\r\nGowganda lake. It is understood that heavy grades make travel somewhat\r\narduous, but the trip from Elk Lake is made easily in a day.\r\n\r\nOn February 4, a sleigh road about 65 miles long was completed between\r\nGowganda and Sellwood, the present terminus of the northern extension\r\nfrom Sudbury of the Canadian Northern railway. A regular stage route now\r\nconnects Sellwood, Phoenix, Burwash lake, Elkhorn lake, and Gowganda.\r\nHowever, neither the road to Elk Lake nor that to Sellwood are yet\r\nsuitable for summer use, so that with the coming of spring, canoe travel\r\nmust be again resorted to. It is also reported that preliminary surveys\r\nfor the extension of the railway to Gowganda are in progress. Meanwhile\r\na business centre is springing up on the east side of Gowganda lake. A\r\nsawmill was put in operation on February 3, but has since been stopped\r\nowing to its location within a government timber reservation. A town\r\nplot has been laid out at the foot of the lake and lots are now\r\npurchasable from the Ontario Department of Lands, Forests and Mines.\r\nBuildings are being erected as rapidly as the supply of material\r\npermits. A branch of the Royal Bank of Canada has been opened, and the\r\nCanadian Bank of Commerce and others propose to be on the ground within\r\na short time. Postal connexions have been established via Sellwood, and\r\nas soon as possible a mining recorder’s office is to be opened. So\r\nswiftly are events transpiring that before the present report takes\r\nprinted form, this paragraph will be in need of revision. However, only\r\nthe developments of a permanent nature and of essential interest to\r\nprospective visitors to that region have been given. For the 1909 field\r\nseason Gowganda will probably be the headquarters for prospecting\r\nparties in the neighbourhood of the East and West branches and Wapus\r\ncreek.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TOPOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nAttention is given here rather to the details than the general aspect of\r\nthe country. It exhibits the usual monotonous succession of low rocky\r\nhills and lake-containing depressions, the even horizon seen from the\r\nsummit of any large hill, being only rarely notched by a prominence of\r\nunusual height. In the spring of 1908 virtually the whole area was\r\nforested, but during September the extreme dryness of the country and\r\nthe unusually large number of camping parties combined to cause bush\r\nfires over much of the country between the East and West branches. The\r\nvegetable loam has been removed from extensive tracts leaving the rock\r\nformations exposed, but the charred tree trunks have fallen so as to\r\ncover the burnt districts with a ‘slash,’ which greatly impedes\r\ncross-country travel, so that what has been gained in one respect is\r\nmore than counterbalanced in another. Especially is this the case in the\r\ncountry west of Gowganda and Obushkong lakes, and near the Forks.\r\n\r\nThe general surface may be characterized as of comparatively low-relief,\r\nthe hills not often rising over 200 feet, but here and there over the\r\ncountry are conspicuous elevations, visible at long distances, which\r\nform useful landmarks and from whose summits comprehensive birds-eye\r\nimpressions of the surrounding country are possible. Structurally they\r\nappear to be, in a few cases, resistant knobs of Keewatin, which project\r\nwell above the general peneplain level, but more commonly they are\r\ntilted ridges of Huronian. A characteristic representative of the latter\r\ntype forms a long ridge beginning a mile and a quarter north-east of\r\nDuncan lake and extending thence for several miles in a north-easterly\r\ndirection. The south-east side of this ridge slopes gently at an angle\r\ncorresponding with the dip of the beds, but the north-west face is an\r\nabrupt cliff dropping almost perpendicularly for about 400 feet to a\r\nflat sandy plain which extends westward and northward for several miles,\r\nbeyond which are other monadnock-like knobs. The accompanying diagram is\r\nintended to represent the structure in vertical cross-section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.—Vertical section across Huron Ridge, North of\r\nDuncan Lake.]\r\n\r\nAnother ridge of similar character, standing 550 feet above the level of\r\nDuncan lake, is visible from the ridge just described and from points on\r\nDuncan and Otto lakes, and adjoining country. Its position as indicated\r\non the map is about four miles north of the large island in the middle\r\nof Duncan lake, a view of it from this point being shown in fig. 4. In\r\nthis case the east face is perpendicular. A prominent hill of the same\r\nkind is visible from Obushkong lake, lying a short distance to the\r\nnorth-west of that body. Just west of Mosher lake as represented in fig.\r\n5, two round hills of about equal size rise 300 feet above the water\r\nlevel. The more southerly of the two is of Keewatin, while that to the\r\nnorth is composed wholly of diabase, Huronian lying around the base of\r\neach. Bold, but less individualized elevations are common in the\r\nneighbourhood of Kenisheong lake, and other localities. All these hills\r\nare markedly rocky and free from soil.\r\n\r\nLess conspicuous than these great masses are certain minor, but\r\npersistent features which are directly referable to geological\r\nconditions. Within Huronian areas there is a distinct tendency toward\r\nthe development of a system of parallel ridges similar in structure and\r\nmode of origin to the hill at the north-east of Duncan lake. This\r\nfeature is developed with special regularity in the southern part of the\r\nwedge between Duncan lake and the West branch, where a succession of\r\nnorth and south ridges alternate with strips of swampy ground. The\r\nwestern faces of the ridge are bare and cliff-like, while the eastern\r\nslopes are gentle, well soil-covered and forested.\r\n\r\nThe post-Huronian diabase is an equally potent topographical factor. Its\r\nsurface is one of marked irregularity, but the peculiarly distinctive\r\nfeatures occur at its contacts with the Huronian. These contacts appear\r\nto be zones of low erosive resistance, and are commonly coincident with\r\nravines, walled on one side by diabase, on the other by Huronian. Small\r\nlakes may occur at intervals along them as, for example, between Firth\r\nlake and the West branch. This erosion feature is well shown by the\r\nconfiguration of Gowganda lake, where diabase bodies are unusually\r\nabundant; both of the long arms to the north-west lie in trough-like\r\ndepressions marking the edges of the eastern diabase mass. The same\r\ntendency in an incipient condition is observable on the east side of the\r\nlarge peninsula where a series of three land-locked bays extend along\r\nthe contact between the eastern diabase mass and the Huronian. Near the\r\nmiddle of Duncan lake, a diabase-Huronian contact which crosses the lake\r\ndiagonally is marked by two deep bays, one extending to the north, the\r\nother southward. While this tendency is an evident one it is not to be\r\nunderstood as invariable; the large island in Duncan lake between the\r\ntwo above-mentioned bays is sufficient to indicate that contacts may lie\r\nin high ground, yet even here there are minor features indicating the\r\ncontact zone to be structurally weak.\r\n\r\nAnother less explicable topographic peculiarity becomes apparent only\r\nupon scrutiny of the drainage system. A brief consideration of the map\r\nshows that both East and West branches follow peculiar zig-zag courses\r\nrunning north for a short distance, then turning abruptly east, this\r\nfeature recurring repeatedly. In some instances the east-west portion of\r\nboth branches lies in the same line. In the case of Zigzag lake and\r\nadjacent portions of the West branch this feature is repeated with an\r\nalmost conventional regularity, which precludes attributing it to chance\r\ncauses. Many of the smaller lakes—Foot lake, for instance—exhibit the\r\nsame character on a small scale. This abnormality has been commented\r\nupon by investigators in the country to the east, the courses there,\r\nhowever, being N.E.-S.W. and N.W.-S.E. Regional faulting is suggested in\r\nexplanation. The canyon-like east and west walls of Zigzag lake suggest\r\nsuch conditions, but a discussion of the matter must be deferred until\r\nfurther data can be collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DRAINAGE.\r\n\r\nAll the drainage water escapes by way of the Montreal river, whose two\r\nchief tributaries are the East and West branches, the latter being\r\nconsiderably the larger. The East branch is without feeders of important\r\nsize, but the West branch receives a large creek, the Wapus, from the\r\nsouth, and a considerable volume of water enters through Duncan lake.\r\n\r\nIn common with most rivers traversing the pre-Cambrian region, this\r\nwater system is marked by a volume of dormant water enormously greater\r\nthan that being transported at any given moment. With few exceptions the\r\nmany small tributary brooks rise in lakes or groups of lakes\r\nsurprisingly large in size, compared with the volume of the out-flowing\r\nstreams; Otto and Lehmann lakes are drained by a rather sluggish rivulet\r\n8 feet wide and 6ʺ deep, although their combined area is about two\r\nsquare miles. The larger streams themselves are only successions of\r\nirregular lake expansions which empty from one to another by short,\r\nriver-like portions containing rapids and falls. The descent is\r\ntherefore accomplished by a succession of abrupt steps rather than an\r\nevenly graded slope. This juvenile condition is directly ascribable to\r\nthe geological character of the country; soil deposits are insignificant\r\nin quantity, leaving exposed a resistant and uneven rock floor in which\r\nthe streams are unable to carve channels for themselves. Failing to do\r\nso they select the readiest egress by filling up impervious rock basins\r\nand spilling over at the lowest points into lower ones. In consequence\r\nof the scantiness of soils and frequency of natural settling basins, the\r\nwaters of the whole system are free from suspended matter, and hence\r\nlack of an effective graving instrument. Exceptions to this general\r\ncharacter occur in the extensive sand plain to the north and west of\r\nDuncan lake, where the several small creeks that traverse it are of\r\nordinary fluvial form and gradation, and the waters of which transport\r\nlarge quantities of sand to Duncan lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FLORA AND FAUNA.\r\n\r\nWhere not recently burned the country is fairly well forested, the\r\ndensity and character of growth being dependent upon soil and drainage.\r\nThe best timber is in low ground and near watercourses where conditions\r\nfor growth are most favourable and the probability of fire least. Recent\r\nfires have done much damage around Nest, Obushkong and Gowganda lakes.\r\nProbably the best timber lies near Duncan lake. Trees do not grow very\r\nlarge as a rule and are not especially good for making lumber, but\r\nprovide an abundant supply of materials for pulpwood, railway ties, fuel\r\nand for mine use.\r\n\r\nWhite pine is the most valuable species, but although individuals attain\r\nthicknesses of 20ʺ to 40ʺ they are too scarce to render this timber\r\nworth the search. Good red pine is more abundant. Jack pine is a very\r\ncommon tree, especially in sandy districts, _e.g._, north-west of Duncan\r\nlake; but is small and worthless. The common and most widely distributed\r\nspecies are spruce, balsam, cedar, poplar, white and yellow birch.\r\nTamarack is not abundant. Clumps of small red maples were seen to the\r\nsouth-west of Pigeon lake.\r\n\r\nThe East and West branches are not well suited for carrying logs as\r\nthere are extensive lake expansions without current on each and the\r\nrapids are shallow. Excellent water-power is obtainable at the 40 foot\r\nfall on the West branch above Fort Matachewan.\r\n\r\nWild animals are not abundant, and will probably become less so as the\r\ncountry is occupied by prospecting and mining camps. Moose were\r\nplentiful in 1908 and some black bears were seen. As a source of food\r\nthe abundance of pickerel and pike is of much greater importance. Brook\r\ntrout do not occur in the Montreal River waters, but are caught farther\r\nto the west and north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GENERAL GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     OUTLINE OF GEOLOGICAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\nThough the geology of the region presents considerable complexity of\r\ndetail, the general historical facts are distinct and go to show that\r\nthe whole complex of formations and systems is capable of separation\r\ninto four major divisions widely different from one another. The mutual\r\nrelationships of these divisions, a knowledge of which is essential to a\r\nthorough comprehension of the geology, are succinctly expressed by the\r\naccompanying diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.—Diagram illustrating geological relationships of\r\nMontreal River district.]\r\n\r\nThe oldest division, the Keewatin, comprises a complex association of\r\nmetamorphosed rocks, principally eruptive, characterized by\r\nwell-developed, secondary schistosity and prevalently dark colours. They\r\ndip at angles approaching 90° and range in texture from soft, fissile,\r\nchorite schists to fine-grained gneisses or altered diabases. In the\r\nMontreal River district the Keewatin areas are not entirely visible,\r\nbeing overlain by other rocks, but they are thought to represent the\r\nbottoms of trough-like folds, produced by the upward intrusion of\r\nigneous matter which now constitutes the Laurentian. The latter forms\r\nthe second division, its origin being apparent from the foregoing\r\nstatement. It is wholly igneous, consisting of granite and allied\r\ncoarsely crystalline rocks essentially pale-coloured owing to their\r\nrichness in quartz and feldspars. Gneissic structure has been developed\r\nin varying degrees, so that all gradations between granite and gneisses\r\nexist; but it never attains the perfection found in the Keewatin. Near\r\ntheir contacts with the Keewatin, the gneisses are apt to contain dark\r\nbands and ribbons of the latter so highly crystalline as to conceal\r\ntheir identity.\r\n\r\nWherever visible the surface of the Keewatin and Laurentian presents an\r\nirregular, deeply worn appearance, the result of extremely protracted\r\nexposure to erosive agencies. To the best of geological knowledge the\r\nsame conditions hold where they lie buried under the Huronian,\r\nindicating that a great period of denudation separates the latter from\r\nthe Archæan. The combined Keewatin and Laurentian, or Archæan system, is\r\ntherefore to be conceived as forming at all points in the district an\r\nancient denuded foundation or floor upon which rests the much younger\r\nHuronian system.\r\n\r\nThis third division is, in the Montreal River district, wholly\r\nsedimentary and easily distinguished from the other rocks by its bedded\r\nstructure and clastic nature. As it is the only sedimentary system\r\nrepresented, its members are not easily confused with any other,\r\nespecially as their original structure is not obscured by metamorphic\r\nalteration. Locally this is not strictly true; in the vicinity of\r\ndiabase intrusions they have been hardened and shattered so as to\r\nsimulate the Keewatin, but the zones of alteration are narrow and\r\nreadily identified by their gradation into adjacent areas of less\r\naltered types. At present the Huronian forms a discontinuous rock mantle\r\nover the Archæan, formerly more complete, but now worn through in places\r\nso as to expose portions of the crystalline basement.\r\n\r\nThe fourth division includes all eruptives known to be younger than the\r\nHuronian. Owing to the discontinuity of the latter it is not always easy\r\nto decide what rocks should be included in this group, for in some cases\r\nrather fresh-looking eruptives occur in the Keewatin which probably\r\nwould also intrude the Huronian were it present; lacking the necessary\r\ninformation their chronological position can be only loosely fixed. By\r\nfar the most extensive and important of the post-Huronian eruptives is\r\nthe diabase with which the silver deposits are associated. This\r\npenetrates both Archæan and Huronian, but is ordinarily distinguishable\r\nby its unusual freshness, dark colour, and crystalline appearance. In\r\ncertain cases, to be described subsequently, it may be confused with\r\ncertain other diabases. Magmatic differentiative processes have evolved\r\ndiabase types of very dissimilar appearance and mineralogical\r\ncomposition, of which a pink aplite occurring in dike form is the most\r\nextreme. Olivine diabase dikes are also present in the region, but in\r\nfar less abundance.\r\n\r\nOf little importance are the sands and gravels of glacial origin which\r\nlie thinly in the depressions and lower lands of the present glaciated\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TABLE OF FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe geological events may be briefly enumerated in ascending order as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\nDeposits of glacial débris and weathering products of present surface.\r\n\r\nErosive period with glaciation.\r\n\r\nDiabase intrusions.\r\n\r\nHuronian sedimentation.\r\n\r\nErosion period.\r\n\r\nLaurentian intrusion.\r\n\r\nKeewatin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               KEEWATIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _General Features._\r\n\r\nThis system is considered as a complex assemblage of metamorphosed\r\nigneous rocks whose common and marked characteristics are pronounced\r\nalteration and deformation, accomplished in pre-Huronian times. A\r\nlimited amount of sedimentary material, such as the iron ore formation,\r\nis also represented. These old diabases, porphyries and related types\r\nare much altered and have developed a more or less uniform schistosity\r\nthrough the secondary development of micaceous minerals, but in other\r\nrespects the complex shows extreme inconstancy and variety from point to\r\npoint. For this reason the various localities are separately described.\r\nBy inspection of the map three fairly well defined areas are\r\ndistinguishable, in addition to which are portions of several others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Obushkong area._\r\n\r\nMuch of the country between Obushkong and Firth lakes is underlain by\r\nKeewatin. On the east, south and west sides, these rocks disappear\r\nbeneath the Huronian or are interrupted by masses of diabase, but on the\r\nnorth they merge into Laurentian gneiss, the contact with which is\r\nill-defined. Although some of them retain much of their original massive\r\ncharacter, well defined schistosity is the dominant feature. The schists\r\nstand vertically or at angles little less than 90° and trend in a\r\ngeneral east and west direction. A series of compass observations made\r\nat points over the whole area show the strike to vary from N. 65° E. to\r\nS. 75° E.\r\n\r\nOne of the most abundant rock types is a stratiform, finely speckled\r\nhornblende gneiss or schist, the black hornblende cleavage faces giving\r\nit a glistening appearance on newly broken surfaces. It is quite fresh,\r\nperfectly crystalline and usually eminently fissile, but sometimes\r\ngrades into a nearly massive dioritic form of undoubted igneous nature.\r\nExtensive exposures occur around Gould lake where the gneiss is\r\ntraversed by numerous stringers of quartz, rusty in colour from the\r\noxidation of pyrite. It is also well exposed near McLaughlin and\r\nMcIntosh lakes and to the east and south-east of Foot lake. A fine\r\ngrained chlorite schist of dull greenish black colour is common in this\r\nand all the other areas in the district. To the north-east of Serpentine\r\nlake it appears as a sheared phase of a weathered diabase, but it has\r\nalso been derived from porphyry, exposures being seen between Foot and\r\nObushkong lakes, where feldspar phenocrysts appear on weathered surfaces\r\nof the schist as pale, oblong spots. What is probably iron formation was\r\nobserved at points 25 chains south of Gould lake, and 10 chains south of\r\na little pond just east of Serpentine lake. Both outcrops consist of\r\nbanded, grey quartzite interlaminated with chlorite schist, but\r\nmagnetite-bearing bands were not found. Occasionally, narrow bands of\r\npale grey, felsitic schists may be seen among the more common darker\r\nrocks. From evidence obtained at various points, these appear to have\r\nresulted from the decomposition and shearing of granite porphyry dikes\r\nprobably connected with the Laurentian, and which penetrated the\r\nKeewatin during the time of Laurentian intrusion. Serpentine was\r\nobserved between Foot lake and Obushkong at 20 chains from the latter.\r\nThe surface is covered by a loose network of fine seams of asbestos\r\nwhich weather white and render the rock somewhat conspicuous. Its\r\nrecognition is further simplified by the dull green, amorphous\r\nappearance of fresh surfaces, the slight translucence of thin edges and\r\nthe glistening green seams of asbestos which traverse it abundantly. The\r\nsame rock is more extensively exposed on the south-west of Serpentine\r\nlake and on Firth lake half a mile north of the portage leading to the\r\nformer, also at less than a quarter of a mile south of this portage. It\r\nis associated with and derived from a dark green massive rock to which\r\nthe name wehrlite is applicable, and a more detailed description of\r\nwhich appears later.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Duncan Lake Area._\r\n\r\nA Keewatin area of considerable extent lies between Duncan lake and the\r\nWest branch in the vicinity of L’Africain and Beaverhouse lakes. Unlike\r\nthe Obushkong area, the prevalent strike of the schists is nearly north\r\nand south, the greatest divergence noted being 25° W. In the former case\r\nLaurentian lies to the north, while in the present one it occurs on the\r\neast; in both cases the schistosity coincides approximately with the\r\ndirection of the line of contact. On account of the swampy character of\r\nthe country just west of the river and the scarcity of outcrops, this\r\narea was not completely explored, but wherever examined the Keewatin, as\r\nin the Obushkong area, consists predominantly of hornblende and chlorite\r\nschists, greenstone and decomposed diabase; but serpentine was not\r\nfound. A nearly black diabase containing small grains of pyrite was\r\nobserved 20 chains south-east of the southerly extending bay on Duncan\r\nlake, and outcrops of the same material were traced for about half a\r\nmile northward. Probably the same type was encountered just north of\r\nBeaverhouse lake and at some other points. Its unfoliated condition and\r\nfresher appearance than the adjacent rocks lead to the opinion that it\r\nis really post-Keewatin and intrusive, but the absence of younger rocks\r\nwith which to correlate it, renders its exact age indeterminable. This\r\nrock exhibits enough resemblance to fractured contact edges of the\r\npost-Huronian diabase to make their distinction in the field rather\r\ndifficult. At half a mile east of the south end of L’Africain lake is\r\ndiabase which from lack of sufficient data has been mapped as Keewatin,\r\nalthough it may be identical with the post-Huronian variety. L’Africain\r\nlake lies in glistening hornblende gneiss with which are associated\r\nribbons of a coarser hornblende gneiss belonging to the Laurentian of\r\nthe area farther east. Greenstone and chlorite schists are the principal\r\nrocks around Beaverhouse lake. Associated with them and to the\r\nnorthward, are dikes of light coloured, granite porphyry, usually only a\r\nfew feet wide, in some of which the original massive structure remains,\r\nwhile others show various gradations toward a felsitic, sericite-bearing\r\nschist. The isolated patch of Keewatin indicated on the map as occurring\r\nabout half a mile east of the wide portion of Duncan lake, is a well\r\nfoliated green schist in which oval white spots represent squeezed\r\nfeldspar phenocrysts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. View looking north from middle of Duncan Lake,\r\n550ʹ hill in distance.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Pigeon Lake Area._\r\n\r\nWest of Pigeon lake and the Montreal river, much of the country examined\r\nis underlain by Keewatin. Schistosity is less developed than in either\r\nof the preceding areas. The rocks are chiefly diabases and porphyry much\r\ndecomposed and locally squeezed. Diabase occurs on both sides of Pigeon\r\nlake near its central islanded part and along the bay which extends\r\nsouth to Brush lake. An original diabase structure is sufficiently well\r\npreserved to show lath-like feldspars in hand specimens, but frequently\r\nthe rock is altered to a chloritic mass. Around the bay extending toward\r\nBrush lake, this old diabase forms a rude wall intersected by a\r\nreticulating system of fractures filled with calcite, the resultant\r\nstructure simulating that of a breccia. Shear zones seen on the east\r\nshore exhibit a pseudo-conglomeratic structure, the more resistant\r\npieces of diabase having been partially rounded by the shearing movement\r\nand embedded in a matrix of finely pulverized rock matter. The same\r\ndiabase apparently occurs all along the Montreal river where it follows\r\nthe Algoma-Nipissing line. About half a mile above Pigeon lake it forms\r\na 90 foot cliff on the west side of the river, near the top of which is\r\na fresher looking, unfoliated eruptive. The form of this body was not\r\nascertained, but microscopic examination of the specimen taken,\r\ndetermines it to be a hornblende lamprophyre, so probably it is a dike\r\nor thin sheet. The rock is fine-grained, dark green in colour and\r\ncharacterized by stout prisms of hornblende about one-quarter of an inch\r\nlong, embedded in a finer, microcrystalline ground mass. Under the\r\nmicroscope it appears much decomposed. This rock was also observed near\r\nmile post 67 of the Algoma-Nipissing boundary, near the east end of the\r\n63 chain portage leading to Breese lake and at other points, in all\r\ncases the exposures being of small extent.\r\n\r\nIn the last mentioned locality the predominant rock is an altered\r\nporphyry of ash grey colour. Around Porphyry lake it occurs in a fairly\r\nmassive, easily recognizable condition, the feldspars showing as square\r\nwhite spots one-quarter of an inch in diameter in a grey, ground mass.\r\nOn Breese lake it has been squeezed to a felsite schist, striking N. 20°\r\nW. In small amounts it is associated with post-Huronian diabase on the\r\nhills lying near the Montreal river and just south of the 63 chain\r\nportage.\r\n\r\nThe 300 foot hill south-west of Mosher lake is composed of a fine\r\nKeewatin greenstone whose surface is curiously weathered so as to\r\nsuggest a spheroidal structure. It is marked off into round areas a foot\r\nor more in diameter by a sinuous network of weathered-out grooves. The\r\nmain body of the rock is ordinary fine-grained greenstone, but the\r\nenclosing grooves have been formed in porphyritic zones about an inch in\r\nwidth. Among other types of less abundant distribution is an actinolite\r\nrock seen by the unassisted eye to consist of a felty mass of acicular\r\ncrystals of actinolite, sometimes half an inch long. This rock was\r\nobserved 12 chains east of the islanded part of Pigeon lake; also at\r\npoints west of Montreal river below Pigeon lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Unfinished Areas._\r\n\r\nThe Keewatin formation occupies the space between Near lake and the West\r\nbranch, only part of which has been mapped. The rocks of this area are\r\nwell foliated, standing as usual, vertically, and striking about N. 60°\r\nE. The exposures on the east shore of Near lake are entirely of fissile,\r\nchlorite schist, abundantly traversed by small barren quartz veins.\r\nFarther east the chlorite schist gives place to glistening, stratiform\r\n(laminated) hornblende gneiss with which are associated bands of a\r\ncoarser hornblende gneiss, evidently the equivalent of granite. In one\r\nlocality the stratiform rock contains subangular fragments of the\r\ncoarser variety, quartz and a greyish eruptive rock, the resultant\r\nstructure resembling that of a metamorphosed conglomerate or breccia. As\r\nsome of the brecciated fragments occur near by in continuous bands\r\nwithin the stratiform gneiss, the clastic structure is to be ascribed to\r\ndeformative movement instead of original sedimentation. A number of\r\nfine-grained quartz diabase dikes occur in the immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the east shore of Kenisheong lake consists of\r\nhigh, bare Keewatin hills, composed largely of chloritic schists,\r\nvertically inclined and striking east and west. Secondary calcite is\r\nrichly disseminated, causing free effervescence when the rock is treated\r\nwith acid. Pyrite is also abundant, sometimes segregated to form a lean\r\nore, and at several points weathered superficially to limonite,\r\ncolouring the cliffs dull red. Much-altered diabase like that on Pigeon\r\nlake is also present in subordinate amount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. West Branch Montreal River, near Mosher Lake.]\r\n\r\nKeewatin rocks also occur just east of Gowganda lake. A single brief\r\nvisit was paid for the purpose of observing the iron formation which\r\nappears at this place, and further mention of which is made on a\r\nsubsequent page.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              LAURENTIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _General Features._\r\n\r\nPractically all the Laurentian lies in a continuous area, east of the\r\nWest branch and extending beyond the limits of the map sheet. A smaller\r\nbody occurs just west of Pigeon lake. The foliation in the Laurentian is\r\nless distinct than in the Keewatin and much less perfect. Its component\r\nrocks are mainly granite and allied plutonic types which pass by easy\r\ngradations into well-defined gneisses. Two principal granites are\r\ndistinguishable; one containing black mica as its chief coloured\r\nconstituent, the other hornblende. Both exhibit local variations in\r\ncomposition and crystalline texture, but are always pale grey rocks of\r\nordinary granitic appearance.\r\n\r\nThe hornblende granite is a medium grained, fresh looking rock of\r\nspeckled appearance, owing to the black hornblende crystals which lie\r\nscattered through the main mass of light grey feldspar and quartz. It is\r\nof uniform aspect, local variations of colour and texture being\r\ninsignificant. As revealed under the microscope by a single thin\r\nsection, it is an ordinary hornblende granite verging towards a syenite.\r\nCommon green hornblende of idiomorphic prismatic habit, and usually\r\ntwinned parallel to 100, is the principal ferromagnesian mineral. It is\r\nquite fresh, hence a few flakes of chlorite in the section were taken to\r\nrepresent an original small content of biotite; an acid oligoclase and\r\northoclase are the most abundant constituents; quartz is subordinate.\r\nApatite, zircon and iron ore, probably magnetite, are accessory.\r\n\r\nHornblende granite is the commonest Laurentian rock in the neighbourhood\r\nof L’Africain and Sedge lakes, where it is in contact with the Keewatin.\r\nIt also occurs on the East branch just below Obushkong lake. The area\r\nwest of Pigeon lake seems to be composed wholly of this rock, outliers\r\nof which extend to Brush lake, and the islands and east shore of Pigeon\r\nlake. Here, however, it is distinctly syenitic, quartz being subordinate\r\nor absent. A distinctly porphyritic structure is apparent on Pigeon\r\nlake; the feldspars being well crystallized and lying in a finer\r\ngrained, holocrystalline ground mass.\r\n\r\nBiotite granite and gneiss are most prevalent in the northern and\r\neastern portions of the area. No microscopic examination of these rocks\r\nhas been made by the writer, consequently, little can be said regarding\r\ntheir composition. They are of much the same texture as the hornblende\r\ntype, but show a somewhat higher degree of gneissification. Biotite is a\r\nfairly abundant constituent, but is more or less altered to chlorite.\r\nSometimes, as may be seen on the East branch, two miles below Obushkong\r\nlake, chloritized mica forms enclosing films about the large feldspar\r\ngrains, developing a slight ‘augen’ structure. Stockwork-like quartz\r\nveins are frequent, particularly on the West branch between Near and\r\nSedge lakes and at the south end of Kenisheong lake. At the latter point\r\nthe biotite gneiss is well foliated and steeply tilted. A body of deep\r\nred, biotite granite of undetermined extent and relationship was\r\nobserved on the east side of Kenisheong lake. Pegmatite dikes almost\r\ncertainly occur in this region, although not actually observed. Near\r\nCrotch lake the granite is locally of unusually coarse texture, although\r\nnot truly pegmatitic.\r\n\r\nAlthough the two granites described appear to be the essential\r\nconstituents of the Laurentian they usually contain a variable\r\nproportion of other material, some of which at least is not really\r\nLaurentian. Over the entire area, but more noticeably in the vicinity of\r\ncontacts with the Keewatin, they include narrow ribbons or lenses of a\r\nglistening stratiform hornblende gneiss, closely resembling the gneiss\r\nof this sort described under the Keewatin system. In some cases these\r\nbands are portions of the Keewatin caught up by the Laurentian material\r\nat the time of its intrusion and highly metamorphosed by it. Excellent\r\nexamples of this may be seen on the East branch at the foot of the\r\nmarshy stretch two miles below Obushkong lake. These inclusions are\r\nmapped as Laurentian, being an almost constant feature, and for map\r\npurposes inseparable from it. They are to be distinguished—a difficult\r\nmatter—from other dark inclusions believed to be drawn out, basic\r\nsegregations of Laurentian magmas; the latter are commonly less sharply\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nLike the other formations of the region, the Laurentian is cut by\r\ndiabase dikes of post-Huronian age which, owing to their dark colour,\r\nare conspicuous among the lighter granite rocks. In the neighbourhood of\r\nZigzag lake they are abundant, and are usually from twenty to sixty feet\r\nor more in width, the smaller of which are not large enough to map.\r\n\r\nThe relationships of the Laurentian to the other systems of the region\r\nare expressed by the contacts with them. Between Obushkong and Firth\r\nlakes and toward L’Africain lake it is largely in contact with Keewatin.\r\nThis contact is a vaguely defined zone rather than a line, the\r\nformations being separated by the intermediate strip containing mingled\r\nportions of both. Proceeding across this strip from the Laurentian to\r\nthe Keewatin, the gneisses of the former become charged with ribbons of\r\nhighly crystalline schist, already described. Near the Keewatin edge\r\nthese increase in quantity and sometimes appear as tongue-like\r\nprotrusions of that system. This condition exists along the east of\r\nL’Africain lake; on the shores of the lake the formation is dominantly\r\nKeewatin, but the stratiform hornblende gneiss is traversed along the\r\nstrike by thin bands of Laurentian hornblende gneiss. A few chains\r\neastward the gneiss bands are wider, and, at a distance of 10 chains,\r\nhornblende granite is continuous.\r\n\r\nWhere terminated by diabase the contact is definite and not marked by\r\nnotable alteration on either side. Contacts with the Huronian are\r\nequally sharp and unconformable, in every case the Laurentian\r\ndisappearing beneath the sedimentary formation; at the south end of\r\nKenisheong lake the Huronian has been trenched to a depth sufficient to\r\nexpose the underlying gneissic floor near the water’s edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HURONIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _General Features._\r\n\r\nMuch of the area mapped, especially the north-western portion, is\r\ncomposed of Huronian rocks. Originally they must have been much more\r\nextensive, probably continuous, but erosion has removed them partially\r\nor entirely, leaving irregular remnants distributed over the Archæan.\r\nThe top of the series is gone; consequently complete vertical sections\r\ncannot be found. In other respects they are little changed and preserve\r\nalmost perfectly their bedding and clastic structure. Even their\r\npositions assumed at the time of deposition have changed little for the\r\npresent strata seldom dip more steeply than 30°. They are overlain only\r\nby unconsolidated Pleistocene materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Basal Conglomerate._\r\n\r\nThe basal member of this system is a conglomerate, the areal exposure of\r\nwhich is inconsiderable for the whole region or for any part, but\r\nerosional sculpturing has brought it to light at many points. Both top\r\nand bottom and probably all intermediate portions are visible, but a\r\ncomplete section from which to determine the thickness could not be\r\nfound. The greatest continuous vertical section observed, in a hill\r\nlying one mile south of the 550 foot hill north-west of Duncan lake, is\r\nabout 200 feet, but neither upper nor lower terminations were seen. In\r\nthe neighbouring Cobalt district an estimated thickness of 500 feet has\r\nbeen assigned.\r\n\r\nFrom a study of the pebbles contained, this conglomerate appears to be\r\ncomposed largely, or entirely, of Archæan materials, the majority of\r\nwhich are rock types occurring in situ at many places in the district.\r\nBoth the hornblende and biotite granite and their gneissic phases are\r\nabundant. Pegmatite pebbles are sometimes found, but more usually that\r\nrock is represented by fragments of feldspar. Pieces of glistening\r\nstratiform hornblende gneiss and similar stratiform mica gneiss or\r\nschist, greenstone, fine-grained porphyroids and sheared basic rocks\r\nrepresent the Keewatin. Vein quartz is also present, sometimes\r\nmineralized. In addition to these some pebbles were observed which\r\nclosely resembled slate, and one which is undoubtedly conglomeratic. A\r\nthin section of this pebble exhibits distinct clastic structure, and the\r\nassembled fragments are heterogeneous, so far as distinguishable,\r\nincluding an actinolite rock resembling that found in the Keewatin near\r\nPigeon lake, and a quartzitic type composed of a colourless,\r\nmicrocrystalline mosaic. The cement has been altered largely to\r\nchlorite, but small grains of quartz are discernible in it. It would\r\nseem, therefore, that sedimentary deposits antedate the basal\r\nconglomerate and supply a portion of its materials; most of these,\r\nhowever, are recognizable as igneous members of the Archæan, such as\r\noccur in the vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe pebbles of the conglomerate exhibit remarkable variety in form, size\r\nand abundance, as well as composition. Normally they are well rounded\r\nand owe their form evidently to water action. But along with these are\r\nothers which are angular or sub-angular. The exposure near the north end\r\nof Shallow lake shows all these forms, the materials also being quite\r\ndiverse. Ordinarily the pebbles range in size between 2ʺ and 3ʺ\r\ndiameter, frequently more, and are abundant; but, at points on Duncan\r\nlake, on Wapus creek and the West branch, the conglomerate nature is\r\nindicated only by occasional well-rounded pebbles, embedded in greywacke\r\ncement at intervals of several feet or even yards. These isolated\r\npebbles are often 6ʺ or more in diameter, and in striking contrast with\r\nthe uniformly fine grain of the matrix. Sometimes the enclosed bodies\r\nattain the dimensions of boulders; on an island in Duncan lake, 2-1/2\r\nmiles from the foot, a granite boulder nearly 5 feet in diameter was\r\nobserved, the associated materials being of very much smaller size.\r\n\r\nThe cementing material also presents some variety. Usually it ranges\r\nfrom coarse grit to greywacke. The coarser material is less abundant\r\nthan cement of a finer type; near the foot of Pigeon lake, also at the\r\nsouth end of Kenisheong lake the conglomerate is quite porous, the\r\ninterstices between the pebbles being incompletely filled. In the latter\r\ninstance these spaces are occupied by hematite. In other cases; a good\r\nexample of which occurs on the east side of Pigeon lake, half a mile\r\nfrom its north end, the cementing substance is a fine black shale. On\r\nthe whole there appears to be little relationship between the texture of\r\nenclosing and enclosed matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Greywacke Slate and Quartzite._\r\n\r\nBy the disappearance of pebbles the basal conglomerate changes into a\r\ngreywacke or a shale according as the cement is one or the other.\r\nFrequently this transition is marked by an alternation of lenticular\r\nbeds of conglomerate with the greywacke, probably indicating varying\r\nconditions of depth or current in the water in which they were\r\ndeposited. With the greywacke and shale is associated an impure\r\nquartzite or arkose, the whole forming a thick series whose members are\r\nnot sharply separable one from another and do not occupy definite\r\nrelative positions. For the well laminated finer grained beds the term\r\nslate is in general use, although a secondary cleavage by which this\r\nkind of rock is distinguished from shale does not exist. Nearly all the\r\nprominent hills in the north-western part of the area are composed of\r\nthis series.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Upper Conglomerate._\r\n\r\nThe greywacke-slate-quartzite series passes conformably upward into a\r\nconglomerate differing little from that at the base. Indeed, where\r\nconglomerate outcrops are small and isolated a distinction between the\r\ntwo cannot be made with certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               _Arkose._\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above there is an arkose forming at least two well\r\ndefined areas, whose relations with the rest of the Huronian are in some\r\ndoubt. This rock is of distinctive appearance, resembling at first\r\nglance an ordinary granite, but on closer inspection it is seen to\r\nconsist of clastic materials such as would result from the\r\ndisintegration of a granite. Occasional conglomerate streaks in which\r\npebbles of quartz and greenstone are recognizable, demonstrate its\r\nbedded character, but ordinarily it is massive looking. Part of the\r\nlarge island in the middle of Duncan lake and the shore to the south are\r\nof this formation. It is much more widespread on Obushkong and Gowganda\r\nlakes, the bedding being unusually well shown on the large island in the\r\nlatter body of water.\r\n\r\nFrom its apparent relationship in either of these localities it might be\r\ntaken to be a member of the Lower Huronian series just described, and\r\nequivalent to the basal conglomerate. In the Obushkong area it is\r\nprobably underlain by Laurentian, for it lies nearly horizontally, and\r\nLaurentian is known to occur a short distance east of the lake. In the\r\nneighbourhood of Lake Timiskaming it is said to grade imperceptibly into\r\ngranite, and is believed to be derived from the latter by detrition in\r\nsitu. Arkose, apparently identical with that under consideration, occurs\r\nin the Cobalt district, and is thought to lie unconformably with the\r\ngreywacke, and for this reason is classified as Middle Huronian. In\r\nthese pages it is given no definite position in the formational\r\nsuccession, and as there is no field evidence of its Middle Huronian\r\nposition, is not differentiated from the lower series.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Structural Features and Disturbances._\r\n\r\nThe Huronian has been subjected to no very severe disturbance, judging\r\nby its present condition and attitude. Frequently the strata lie almost\r\nhorizontally, as for instance at the south end of Firth lake, and in the\r\nvicinity of Lake Lehmann, but over the most of the region they rest at\r\ninclinations as high as 30°, this attitude remaining constant over\r\nextensive areas, and developing a characteristic topographical feature.\r\nFrom Pigeon lake eastward the dip is uniformly to the east at angles\r\nranging between 15 and 30 degrees and the beds overlap one another after\r\nthe fashion of slates on a roof, the resultant topographical expression\r\nof which is a succession of north and south ridges with gentle eastern\r\nslopes, while the western sides form escarpments. This condition appears\r\nconstant over all the Huronian east of a line midway between Pigeon and\r\nDuncan lakes. To the extreme north-west, however, a westerly dip was\r\nobserved; the strata forming the 550 foot hill west of Duncan lake are\r\nalso either horizontal or dip gently to the west. A confident statement\r\ncannot be made until further work has been performed, but the condition\r\njust outlined suggests a large anticlinal structure whose arch lies a\r\nlittle west of Duncan lake. However, there seems reason to believe that\r\nthe structure is more complicated than would result from simple arching\r\nand erosion. If the present overlapping system represents the original\r\nsuccession of strata a total thickness of over two miles would be\r\nnecessary, and there would be not two but several conglomerate horizons,\r\nwhich is improbable. A satisfactory solution is hindered by the general\r\nfact that planes of possible dislocation occur in low ground and are\r\nobscured by swamp or water, but it seems evident that tilting was\r\naccompanied by lateral or vertical displacements.\r\n\r\nCertain abrupt disturbances of the general uniform attitude suggest\r\ndifferential movements. Along the West branch below Wapus creek the dip\r\nand strike of the shale and greywacke are constant, until where the\r\nriver’s course changes to due east. Along the shores of this stretch the\r\nrocks are mostly hidden by swamp, but where they do outcrop they are\r\nstanding vertically or dipping steeply to the south, and the strike\r\ncorresponds with the course of the stream; that is, their positions are\r\nat right angles to those farther south. Disturbances of this sort are\r\nknown, due to the contiguity of igneous intrusions, but at this point no\r\nsuch intrusive is known. It will also be seen from the map that exactly\r\nin the same line the East branch makes a similar abrupt change in\r\ncourse. Whether a line of low relief is continuous across the interval\r\nbetween the two streams at this point is not easily determined; however,\r\nas a possible explanation of the conditions stated, faulting along this\r\nline is suggested. A similar abrupt change from conditions of\r\napproximate horizontality to a dip S. 60 W., < 80° and strike of S. 30°\r\nE. was noted on the west side of Firth lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Relations to other Formations._\r\n\r\nThe intrusion of the quartz diabase into the Huronian was gently\r\naccomplished at most points, and the beds of the latter, both above and\r\nbelow the intrusives, are inclined only a few degrees more steeply than\r\nin localities where no diabase can be found. Evidence of intrusion,\r\nhowever, is common, and at some points the Huronian next to the diabase\r\nhas suffered local but intense physical change. Near the middle of the\r\neast shore of Firth lake a rocky islet only a few square yards in extent\r\nconsists of coarse diabase and conglomerate in intimate contact, little\r\ntongues of the former being protruded into the sedimentary rock and\r\nperipherally chilled. Most remarkable, however, is the change in\r\ncondition of the conglomerate; a few chains away on the main shore it is\r\nof ordinary character, but on the islet the pebbles lie within a fairly\r\nwell foliated schist, standing vertically and striking about east and\r\nwest. An identical condition exists at the south end of a little pond\r\nlying 40 chains west of Mosher lake. The vertical foliation of the\r\nconglomerate suggests the neighbouring diabase intrusion to have been by\r\nvertical ascension rather than lateral spread, so that these points may\r\nrepresent portions of vents through which the diabase magma ascended,\r\nand for that reason are more affected than where sills have been quietly\r\ninjected.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily these contacts occur in low ground, usually ravines, the\r\nbottoms of which are soil filled and consequently unfavourable for\r\ngeological observation, but at some points on Duncan lake the contacts\r\nare exposed and the Huronian is seen to be much fractured across a zone\r\nextending many feet from the diabase. In addition to the fracturing the\r\ngreywacke is hardened and the bedding planes rendered obscure, the total\r\neffect being to weaken its power of resistance to erosion.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of these contacts the Huronian is well supplied\r\nwith quartz veins whose ‘comb’ structure and chalcopyrite-galena\r\nmineralization identify them with similar veins in the diabase. Also the\r\nsediments exhibit certain mineralogical alterations referable to action\r\nof the diabase. West of Gowganda, on the West branch below Duncan lake\r\nand at other places the greywacke for a width of about two feet from the\r\ndiabase has been hardened, bleached a light grey colour and filled with\r\ncircular black spots 1/16ʺ in diameter. Microscopic examination shows\r\nthe main portion to consist of a mosaic of small quartz, orthoclase and\r\nacid plagioclase grains, through which are distributed patches of\r\nchlorite. This spotted phase of the greywacke evidently represents an\r\nearly stage in the development of adinole, a characteristic contact\r\nproduct of shales, intruded by basic rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Fifth Portage on the West Branch of Montreal\r\nRiver, showing Huronian Slate.]\r\n\r\nThe relations of the Huronian to the Archæan, exhibited in larger as\r\nwell as minor features, indicate that the surface of the latter had been\r\ncarved into a condition not greatly unlike the present topography,\r\nbefore its submergence and sedimentation in Huronian times. Some of the\r\nhills of this ancient land have been uncovered by the removal of their\r\nsedimentary blanket, leaving vestiges of the latter around their bases\r\nas in the case of the hills south-west of Mosher lake. There the dip of\r\nthe sedimentary beds is much less than the slope of the hills, so that\r\nthe latter must project up through them as cores. In the bay on the east\r\nside of Pigeon lake Huronian shales dipping with an angle of about 15°\r\nabut against the side of an Archæan hill composed of hornblende granite\r\nand green schist. At almost any part of the region where both Huronian\r\nand Archæan occur together, similar evidence is available concerning the\r\nunevenness of the pre-Huronian land surface. The amount of topographical\r\nrelief cannot be estimated with any degree of accuracy, for tops of the\r\nKeewatin hills now exposed have probably been removed by post-Huronian\r\nerosion, the lowest depressions are still filled by Huronian and the\r\nwhole may have been disarranged by post-Archæan faulting. However, near\r\nMosher lake there was a minimum relief of 300 feet.\r\n\r\nThis old pre-Huronian surface is not often accessible for study, the\r\ncontacts being vertical or hidden by soils and vegetation. At one point,\r\nhowever, at the end of the portion of Wapus creek shown on the map,\r\nexceptionally favourable circumstances were encountered. Here glaciation\r\nhas developed a rounded knoll of mixed Keewatin and Laurentian rocks\r\nupon which are tightly fastened a few scale-like vestiges of Huronian\r\nconglomerate. A few square feet of the original Archæan surface exposed\r\nby chiseling away the Huronian, was found to be much more highly\r\npolished than the immediately adjoining, recently glaciated surface\r\nwhich had been exposed to the atmosphere. The protected material seemed\r\nto be of about the same freshness as that exposed. This pre-Huronian\r\nsurface is evidently a water-worn one, or the result of Huronian\r\nglaciation, but no characteristic markings were observed upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Origin and Correlation._\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing consideration of the Huronian as seen in the Montreal\r\nRiver region it will be plain that it is composed at all points of\r\nclastic sedimentary deposits. Fossils have never been found, so the\r\ncorrelation of these rocks in various areas is based upon their\r\nlithological similarities and continuity. Upon these grounds the\r\nHuronian of the present district is considered to be equivalent to the\r\nsame formations in the Cobalt, Larder Lake, and other neighbouring\r\ndistricts, known as the Lower Huronian. The succession and physical\r\ncharacter of the different formations are essentially identical. It is\r\nnot necessary to review the facts upon which the decision to so place\r\nthese formations is based, the evidence being the harmonious results of\r\nyears of investigation by capable geologists. Accepting their\r\nconclusion, and calling the main sedimentary series of the Montreal\r\nRiver district, Lower Huronian, it is of interest to note indication of\r\nsedimentary materials still older. The conglomerate pebble found in the\r\nbasal conglomerate on Pigeon lake must have originated by the\r\ndestruction of a pre-Huronian conglomerate formation.\r\n\r\nIt has also been stated that ground for differentiating between a Lower\r\nand Middle Huronian in this area has not been obtained, although the\r\nsimilarity of the arkose to a formation in the Cobalt district believed\r\nto belong to the Middle Huronian suggests it to be of the same age. It\r\nis, therefore, thought desirable to apply to the whole the term\r\nHuronian. No clearness or additional truth would be gained by making a\r\ndistinction between Lower and Middle divisions in this district, and so\r\nfar as the economic exploitation of the district is concerned the arkose\r\nseems to be as much a part of the Lower Huronian as the conglomerate or\r\ngreywacke.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        POST-HURONIAN ERUPTIVES.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of diabase known in the district, one of which\r\ngreatly exceeds the other in extent and economic importance. This\r\ndisparity is tacitly recognized by the common use of the generic term\r\ndiabase for the important quartz diabase, the other member of the family\r\nbeing ignored or unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Quartz Diabase._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Inclined Huronian Beds, Duncan Lake.]\r\n\r\n_Character of contacts and distribution._—Bodies of this rock are not\r\nrestricted to any one formation or locality; but, as may be seen by\r\nreference to the map, occur with various dimensions over the whole area,\r\nwith the exception of the country lying north-west of Duncan lake. It\r\nmay be noted that virtually all the large areas are enclosed by\r\nHuronian, the bodies within the Archæan being numerous but small. It is\r\nnot proposed to apply this distinction generally, but in the Montreal\r\nRiver region it seems to be more than an expression of the law of\r\nprobability. In the Archæan practically all of the observed diabase\r\nbodies are dikes, in approximately vertical positions, seldom 100 feet\r\nin width and of undetermined length. A knowledge of all those in the\r\nHuronian could not be obtained, but in some cases they are sills, whose\r\ngreater exposed dimensions are parallel to the bedding planes of the\r\nenclosing sedimentaries.\r\n\r\n_Macroscopic character._—It is fortunate for the easy recognition of the\r\ndiabase that it is more or less continuously exposed, and that there are\r\nnot many other igneous rocks of similar character in its proximity, for\r\nit presents a variety of types such that a representative collection of\r\nhand specimens presents surprisingly great petrological differences.\r\nDuring the process of solidification, magmatic differentiation evolved\r\nfrom the cooling material a group of forms of different mineralogical\r\ncomposition and physical appearance, the end members of which are very\r\nunlike.\r\n\r\nThe common type is a dark green massive diabase, ranging in texture from\r\none in which the individual minerals are barely distinguishable to\r\nothers containing amphibole crystals an inch in length. The combination\r\nof black amphibole—an alteration product of augite—and grey or\r\nflesh-coloured plagioclase give the surface of ordinary textured phases\r\na colouration of sufficient determinative value. In a large diabase body\r\nthe coarseness is equal to that of ordinary granite, and the diabasic\r\nstructure is not readily perceptible. At the edge of the large dikes and\r\nthroughout the smaller ones the rock is black in colour and much finer\r\ngrained on account of its more rapid solidification.\r\n\r\nIn the dikes the mineralogical composition is tolerably constant, and\r\nspecimens selected from different points show no notable difference\r\nexcept that they are usually less decomposed than the coarse grained\r\nvarieties. Within the larger bodies, where cooling may be considered to\r\nhave been slower, a series of rock types differing from one another in\r\nmineral composition, and consequently in physical appearance, are\r\nassociated. At many localities these differentiated varieties are\r\nintimately intermingled, so that within an area of a few square yards\r\nalmost the whole series may be found. Conditions of this sort were first\r\nand best observed in the Lett properties on Wapus creek, where the\r\nextensive stripping and trenching greatly facilitated geological study.\r\nA suite of specimens was obtained which exhibit an unbroken gradation\r\nfrom ordinary gabbro to the fine grained pink rock known as aplite. With\r\na decreasing pyroxene content and increasing abundance of feldspar the\r\nrock grades from a dark green diabase at the basic end through a reddish\r\nphase into a type which, in the field, might be termed a syenite, being\r\nof granitic texture, red colour, and without visible quartz. These\r\nphases are cut by aplite dikes which at first glance do not very closely\r\nresemble them, but their comparison has shown that they too include a\r\ngroup whose coarsest and most basic form does not differ greatly from\r\nthe syenitic type of the diabase series. From a pale flesh-coloured rock\r\nof fine granitic texture in which a little dark mineral is visible, the\r\nsuccessive phases of the aplite graduate toward a dike material of light\r\npink colour and saccharine texture almost devoid of ferromagnesian\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n_Microscopic character._—The consanguinity of diabase and aplite is\r\nfurther established by microscopic study. It was intended to make a\r\nsomewhat complete comparative study; but, at the outset, the materials,\r\nalthough fresh looking in the hand specimens, were found to be much\r\ndecomposed, sometimes so completely that the original composition could\r\nnot be satisfactorily inferred, and an outline must suffice therefore\r\nuntil fresher material is secured.\r\n\r\nThe common gabbro type consists essentially of long prisms of\r\nplagioclase embedded in light reddish augite. This ophitic structure,\r\nupon which the distinction between diabase and gabbro depends, is well\r\ndeveloped, but does not show in hand specimens, so that for field use\r\nthe distinction is impracticable; ordinarily the term gabbro is applied\r\nto the coarse grained, and diabase to the medium and finer grained\r\nvarieties. The plagioclase of the coarse grained specimens could not be\r\nidentified, being entirely altered to a coarse saussurite in which the\r\nepidote was aggregated into large grains. The augite is almost equally\r\nchanged to strongly pleochroic hornblende possessing green and blue\r\ngreen pleochroic tints. This hornblende is not a fibrous variety but\r\nforms compact individuals, hence in the specimens studied it could not\r\nbe certain that some of it was not primary. In some cases it is further\r\naltered to chlorite. Reaction between plagioclase and pyroxene seems to\r\nhave taken place, for chlorite occurs among the plagioclase\r\ndecomposition products as well as those of the pyroxene. Next to these,\r\nilmenite is the most abundant constituent, occurring as irregular masses\r\nlargely altered to leucoxene in which the original ‘gridiron’ structure\r\nis distinct. Quartz is present in subordinate amounts usually in\r\nmicrographic intergrowth with the plagioclase. Small, well defined\r\nhexagonal rods of apatite, titanite crystals, and rare zircons are also\r\npresent. The structure and mineral constitution render the term\r\nquartz-diabase appropriate. Finer grained specimens secured from dikes\r\nwere found to be much fresher than the coarser types and yielded more\r\nsatisfactory thin sections; the ophitic structure is more pronounced,\r\nbut the mineral composition is the same. The plagioclase laths of one\r\nsection were determined optically to be an intermediate labradorite.\r\nSmall flakes of biotite partially altered to chlorite occur accessorily.\r\n\r\nThe aplite is also so much weathered that doubt sometimes exists as to\r\nits original composition. Thin sections consist very largely of\r\nplagioclase and quartz, coloured constituents being small in quantity.\r\nThe plagioclase is twinned according to albite, pericline, and carlsbad\r\nlaws, and in one case a baveno twin was observed; optically it behaves\r\nas almost pure albite and is decomposed to sericite instead of epidote.\r\nA poikilitic arrangement is more or less distinct; the feldspar is also\r\nmicrographically intergrown with quartz. No orthoclase could be\r\nidentified in any of the specimens. Quartz does not appear to be much\r\nmore abundant than in the diabase. The only recognizable ferro-magnesian\r\nmineral is a strongly pleochroic reddish brown biotite, which occurs\r\nsparingly in small ragged flakes, partly altered to chlorite. Leucoxene\r\nrepresenting ilmenite is surprisingly abundant considering the scarcity\r\nof iron bearing silicates. Apatite is an abundant accessory mineral,\r\nforming small prisms, while zircon crystals are rare. The rock in the\r\nspecimens examined is remarkably rich in calcite, which in amount ranks\r\nnext to the plagioclase.\r\n\r\nComparison of sections from specimens intermediate between the aplite\r\nand the ordinary diabase brings out some features of the differentiating\r\nprocess. The governing changes are in the proportion of pyroxene, and in\r\nthe composition of the plagioclase. A specimen somewhat paler in colour\r\nthan the typical diabase was found to contain considerably less augite\r\nand more abundant plagioclase, the other constituents remaining fairly\r\nconstant. The plagioclase was an acid andesine of the composition (Ab 65\r\nAn 35). A still lighter coloured type possessed oligoclase (Ab 72 An 28)\r\nand a small amount of blue green hornblende, representing the wholly\r\naltered pyroxene. Orthoclase could not be found in any of the sections,\r\nso that none of these rocks can be properly called syenite or granite.\r\n\r\n_Local description._—Diabase is most abundantly exposed in the area\r\nbetween Gowganda lake and the portage route connecting Firth and Elkhorn\r\nlakes, where it forms three parallel tongues of approximately equal\r\ndimensions. Coarse grained types prevail in which the differentiation of\r\nacid phases is pronounced. Aplite dikes up to 10 feet in width, fairly\r\ncoarse grained and sometimes tolerably rich in dark constituents, are\r\nabundant. The rugged surface of this part of the country is largely due\r\nto the presence of the diabase, the peculiar arrangement of which has\r\nproduced a constant system of north and south ridges. The contacts with\r\nthe Huronian occupy the bottoms of gullies, with the main body of\r\ndiabase forming high ground. This highly relieved and consequently well\r\nexposed surface has greatly facilitated the exploitation of this area,\r\nas indeed is the case for the whole district. Terminally each of the\r\nthree bodies tapers out or forks, but these details were not closely\r\nmapped. In the case of the most easterly one the portions reaching the\r\neast side of Firth lake are darker and more decomposed than the ordinary\r\ndiabase, and during the field operations were considered of other\r\ncharacter. Laboratory study of the specimens shows them, however, to be\r\nbasic diabase in which hornblende has completely replaced the pyroxene.\r\nIn consequence of this misconception the connexions of the exposures on\r\nFirth lake were not well worked out, but they almost certainly lie as\r\nshown in the map and may form a continuous connexion with the large\r\ndiabase body farther north. The two areas north-east of Firth lake\r\npresent much the same appearance as those of the Gowganda district.\r\n\r\nThe most extensive body is that which coincides in direction with Duncan\r\nlake, resembling a great hook, the shank of which is traceable for\r\ntwelve miles, the crooked end lying about midway between the West branch\r\nand Firth lake. Neither termination was found, on account of the swampy\r\nor sandy character of the country, so that the present representation\r\nmay not be complete. Just east of L’Africain lake there are some\r\ndiabases which may be continuations of it, but owing to their altered\r\nappearance they could not be distinguished with certainty in the field\r\nfrom similar Keewatin forms. Along Duncan lake it appears to represent\r\nthe edge of a sill about 300 feet thick lying in the bedding plane of\r\nthe Huronian sediments which lie both above and beneath it. From the\r\nattitude of the latter the sill is believed to dip eastward at an angle\r\nof 30 or 40 degrees. The exposed width is usually less than in the\r\nGowganda area and its composition is more homogeneous, but at the wider\r\nportions the same intermingling of basic and acid phases and aplite\r\ndikes obtains, as for example where it crosses Wapus creek. The full\r\nextent of that portion which extends north-westward from Mosher lake is\r\nnot known. The formation at that point is obscured by gravelly soil; it\r\nappears, however, to be unusually wide and well differentiated. An\r\napparently large body of diabase lies between the north part of Duncan\r\nlake and the West branch. The mapping of this was left incomplete, so\r\nthat its total southern extent cannot be given. Its northern part\r\npresents nothing unusual, but about Vipond lake a syenitic phase is\r\ndeveloped, probably indicating a mingling of differentiated rock\r\nvarieties as at Gowganda lake or Wapus creek.\r\n\r\nThe remaining diabase bodies are dikes. Probably these are very numerous\r\nand widespread, but this can only be determined by work of much more\r\nwidespread nature than the economic possibilities of such an\r\ninvestigation warrant at present. They are most frequently seen in the\r\nLaurentian, probably not so much because they are more numerous there,\r\nbut because they are more conspicuous in the granites than in the\r\nKeewatin schists and Huronian, from which they differ less in colour.\r\nThey attain widths of 60, 100 or more feet, in which cases the texture\r\nis like that of the large masses, but differentiated types and aplite\r\ndikes do not seem to accompany them. The smaller dikes, diminishing to a\r\nwidth of 1 foot, are compact black rocks of microcrystalline habit, but\r\nlike the gabbroid varieties mineralogically.\r\n\r\n_Age._—The time of intrusion of these rocks can only be defined as\r\npost-Huronian or post Middle Huronian, there being no younger formations\r\nwith which to correlate them. They are identical with the diabase in\r\nother parts of the Montreal River region and of Cobalt. As already noted\r\nthe larger masses have produced very limited metamorphic changes in the\r\nadjoining rocks, developing incipient adinole zones in the Huronian\r\ngreywackes, besides hardening and fracturing them. Usually the contact\r\nedge of the diabase has been deeply eroded along with the adjoining rock\r\nto form narrow ravines, but wherever it persists a slight chilling is\r\nperceptible. The fine grained edges are much more apparent in dikes\r\nwhere the mass of hot material being much less was more susceptible to\r\nthe influence of cold surroundings. The intrusive nature is also\r\ndemonstrated by angular blocks of Huronian materials enclosed within the\r\ndiabase, instances of which may be seen on Wapus creek.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Olivine Diabase._\r\n\r\nAt the first rapid above Kenisheong lake the Huronian is cut by a broad\r\ndike of different character from those belonging to the quartz-diabase\r\nintrusion. It is a remarkably fresh compact rock of dark grey colour and\r\nmedium texture in which an ophitic structure is prominent, acicular\r\nprisms of glassy feldspar penetrating the dark main mass. Its density is\r\n2·991. Under the microscope it is holocrystalline and the constituent\r\nminerals occur in only one generation. The constituents as determined by\r\nlinear measurements were found to be plagioclase, 67·5 per cent;\r\nolivine, 14 per cent; augite, 1·5 per cent; iron ore, probably ilmenite,\r\n5 per cent; apatite, 1·8 per cent; biotite, 1·3 per cent; and zircon,\r\n0·03 per cent. The rock is remarkably fresh, even the olivine showing no\r\nsigns of decomposition. The plagioclase was determined by optical\r\nmethods to be a labradorite of the composition Ab 1 An 1. It forms\r\nlaths, twinned according to albite, pericline and carlsbad laws, which\r\npenetrate the ferromagnesian minerals. A few large crystals show fine\r\nzonary lamellation. Olivine is in idiomorphic or rounded grains,\r\noccasionally bordered by a little rim of biotite, possibly a product of\r\nreaction during the period of crystallization. The augite is reddish\r\nbrown in colour and later than either olivine or plagioclase, filling\r\nthe interstices between the feldspar laths. Irregular masses of black\r\niron ore, probably ilmenite, are scattered throughout the section, in\r\nsome cases showing good crystal forms. A deep brown strongly pleochroic\r\nbiotite with a very small optical angle occurs accessorily in small\r\nshreds. Apatite is mostly in slender but sometimes stout hexagonal\r\nprisms. Minute crystals of zircon are rare.\r\n\r\nThe rock may be designated an olivine diabase of markedly fresh aspect.\r\nIt penetrates the Huronian, but judging by its unusually fresh condition\r\nit must be comparatively young.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PLEISTOCENE.\r\n\r\nThe present glaciated pre-Cambrian surface is scantily covered by\r\nunconsolidated glacial sands and gravel which are being collected by\r\nnatural agencies from the hills and more elevated parts into the\r\ndepressions. As a consequence the hills are bare, while the valleys and\r\nravines are soil-filled and support a strong forest growth. Neither sand\r\nnor gravel show signs of stratified arrangement. They play an\r\nunimportant part in the topographical appearance of the country; the\r\nonly elevation composed of such materials being a small gravel hill to\r\nthe east of Porphyry lake. Between that point and the hills near Mosher\r\nlake is a considerable extent of flat sandy country, the gentle contour\r\nof which contrasts with that of the surrounding hills.\r\n\r\nA rather peculiar low apron of sand occupies the very end of the\r\npeninsula between Duncan lake and the West branch. It is of small\r\nextent, and is probably due to river deposition, the West branch at this\r\npoint being sluggish and the surface of the sand showing indications of\r\nshifting stream beds.\r\n\r\nAn extensive area of sand lies at the end of Duncan lake, from whence it\r\nextends northward for several miles, also westward and south-westward\r\ntoward the 550 foot hill shown on the map. Seen from any neighbouring\r\nhill this plain appears flat in comparison with the ordinary surface of\r\nthe country. It consists of a fine, yellowish, unstratified sand. The\r\nseveral brooks crossing it are distinguished from those of other parts\r\nof the country by their tortuous courses which are constantly changing,\r\nand which render them unfit for canoe travel. The shallow character and\r\nsandy shores at the north end of Duncan lake have been caused largely by\r\nthe transportation of sand into it by these brooks.\r\n\r\nGlacial boulders are scattered over the whole district.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ECONOMIC GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SILVER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\nWith the knowledge acquired from exploitation of James township, and\r\nother of the more recently discovered silver-cobalt camps, prospectors\r\nin the Montreal River district gave exclusive attention to the diabase\r\nformation, recognizing it to be closely connected with mineralizations\r\nof this kind. Some work was done in 1907 and more in the following\r\nseason, with the result that on August 4, the first native silver\r\ndiscoveries were made, almost simultaneously and at short distances\r\napart, by Messrs. Mann and Dobie, in the diabase just west of Gowganda\r\nlake. The remarkably rich surface showings at once attracted the\r\nattention of the whole prospecting body in the Elk Lake country, and an\r\nactivity began which, since the spreading of information to outside\r\npoints, has developed into a ‘rush’ of large dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe known silver bearing area is restricted as yet to about ten square\r\nmiles lying between Gowganda lake and the portage route from Elkhorn to\r\nFirth lakes, and is commonly known as Gowganda. Extensive prospecting\r\nonly commenced in September, about the close of the field season, so\r\nthat only the earlier discoveries are known to the writer, and a\r\nknowledge of the surface details could only be derived by examination of\r\nthe few beginnings of patient and continued exploration by claim owners.\r\nThe present account must accordingly be accepted as incomplete and by no\r\nmeans representing the present status of the Gowganda camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SURFACE INDICATIONS.\r\n\r\nConditions in the region are such as to demand exploration of the\r\nclosest and most intensive order, for the indications of mineralization\r\nare negative rather than positive in character. The Gowganda area was\r\nentirely forested at the beginning of 1908, and a carpet of moss and\r\nvegetable mould covered most of the rock surface. Glacial materials are\r\nalso fairly abundant, and sometimes thick enough to render surface\r\nexploration arduous and expensive. Added to this the veins are eroded\r\nmore deeply than the country rock, and are represented at the surface by\r\ncrevices filled with soil, and thereby rendered inconspicuous. Were the\r\ncountry a flat one the difficulties in the way of successful prospecting\r\nwould be very serious, but fortunately it is rugged, especially near the\r\ndiabase. Steep ridges of this material are a regular topographical\r\nfeature. The sides of these ridges are bare or readily exposed and offer\r\nfine opportunities for examination. It is significant that the first\r\nsilver discoveries were made in the sides of such rock walls. The pink\r\nbloom found at the surfaces of the veins and the adjacent country rock\r\nis also an indicator whose value is fully understood by those working in\r\nthe region.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          STRUCTURE OF VEINS.\r\n\r\nThe deposits are in the form of well-defined veins occupying fissures in\r\nthe diabase. The amount of surface work done in September was not enough\r\nto throw much light on the continuity of the veins, but a few had been\r\ntraced for distances of 300 or 400 feet, and in one case across several\r\ncontiguous mining claims, so that they may be said to occupy persistent\r\nfissures. They vary in width from 1ʺ up to 20ʺ. Little could be learned\r\nconcerning their attitudes except where they traverse hillsides; in such\r\ncases they are approximately vertical. It is not yet known whether any\r\nregularity exists in their arrangement, but some extend east and west\r\nwhile others are north and south. The diabase shows no signs of\r\nextensive deformation, all geological evidence indicating that since its\r\nsolidification its history has been uneventful, yet the cracks which the\r\nveins occupy appear too persistent to be the result of contraction by\r\ncooling. Besides the strong veins there are others of the gash type, but\r\nthe latter are small, not very continuous and poorly or not at all\r\nmineralized.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         COMPOSITION OF VEINS.\r\n\r\nFrom comparison of veins at Gowganda, Duncan lake, and Wapus creek a\r\ngeneral uniformity of structure, though not of mineralization, is found\r\nto obtain. The whole mineral association is not found in any one vein,\r\nnor are the relative proportions either of ore or gangue at all\r\nconstant. The gangue minerals are quartz and calcite, always mutually\r\narranged in definite manner. The sides of the veins are composed of\r\nwhite quartz, which may form only an insignificant coating on the walls\r\nor may occupy nearly the whole space, but in all cases there remains a\r\ncentral cavity into which the pointed ends of quartz crystals project\r\nfreely. At the surface this central portion is empty owing to\r\nweathering, but farther down it is filled by calcite. Veins with\r\npredominant quartz filling seem especially abundant in the Huronian\r\nadjacent to the diabase. The rich veins near Gowganda, so far as\r\nascertainable, are poor in quartz.\r\n\r\nPractically all of them carry chalcopyrite either as diffuse grains or\r\nin considerable amounts. Pyrite is equally abundant but less constant.\r\nGalena is not uncommon. All these occur with the quartz; their presence\r\nin the calcite is not certainly known. Many of the veins show diffuse\r\nstains of reddish pink colour due to cobalt bloom, which though not in\r\nitself of value is important as a sign of the existence of smaltite from\r\nwhich it is formed by oxidation. The minerals enumerated thus far are\r\nwidespread, but economically insignificant; the silver-cobalt\r\nassociation is present in some cases, however. Little opportunity\r\nexisted in 1908 for favourable study of these minerals, so that only a\r\nlist of those found at the surface can be given. There native silver,\r\nargentite, smaltite and cobalt bloom have been found, and a few feet\r\ndown small lumps of native bismuth. Because they occur either in calcite\r\nor in loose decomposition materials filling the space which the calcite\r\nformerly occupied they are believed to be associated with that gangue.\r\nInfrequently gangue minerals are almost absent and the vein filled by\r\nmassive ore.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LOCAL DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\nValuable argentiferous veins were known in 1908 only in the Gowganda\r\ndistrict, and, so far as yet known, discoveries have been confined to\r\nthe diabase west of that lake. Most of them occur in the southern\r\nportion of the central diabase strip which lies a short distance from\r\nthe shore and extends northward for about seven miles from Elkhorn lake.\r\nOn one of the Mann claims (T.R. 1966), now owned by Messrs. Foster, an\r\neast and west vein averaging 4ʺ or 5ʺ in width had been traced for 300\r\nfeet, the original discovery being made in the exposed face of a low\r\ndiabase wall. At its surface the vein material had been weathered out\r\nfor a depth of about 15ʺ and the cavity filled by a brownish mass of the\r\ndecomposed matter mixed with vegetable mould and sand. Nuggets of mossy\r\nor arborescent silver were scattered richly through this dirt, and a\r\nfairly continuous spine of the same metal, sometimes an inch thick,\r\nextended along the middle of the crevice. A test pit sunk about 8 feet,\r\nbut barricaded at the time of the writer’s visit, had exposed, according\r\nto Mr. Mann, silver and smaltite in a calcite vein. On the adjoining\r\nclaim (T.R. 1982), a vein of massive smaltite about 1ʺ wide was seen; a\r\nlittle silver had been found at its surface and streaks of argentite and\r\ndisseminated grains of smaltite were seen in the wall rock. Aplite dikes\r\non another claim were found to be stained by cobalt bloom, and full of\r\ndisseminated chalcopyrite.\r\n\r\nThe properties owned by Messrs. Crawford and Dobie about half a mile\r\nfarther south were not visited, but were generally reported to be of\r\nabout the same richness as that in T.R. 1966. Immediately north of\r\nHanging-stone lake Mr. F. A. McIntosh was conducting active prospecting\r\nin a coarse gabbroid, locally syenitic, form of the diabase, intersected\r\nby aplite dikes. A discovery of native silver has been made since then\r\nand the property sold to Messrs. F. R. Bartlett & Co., of Toronto,\r\ntogether with other claims located between the north-east and north-west\r\narms. Other discoveries are reported just south-east, also a short\r\ndistance north of Milne lake.\r\n\r\nNo silver had been obtained in the eastern diabase strip, although the\r\ngeological conditions appear identical and calcite veins are abundant.\r\nAn exceptionally large vein, about 18ʺ wide, and traceable across two\r\nadjoining claims was seen on the property of Messrs. McLaughlin and\r\nMcIntosh, about half a mile north-east of the north-west arm.\r\nMineralization in it near the surface was very slight. Several veins\r\ncarrying small amounts of chalcopyrite, pyrite, bloom and smaltite were\r\nseen on the properties of Messrs. Elstone and Reilly (T.R. 1961, 1962\r\nand 1903). In one of them small amounts of bismuth are present; another\r\ncontains an unusually heavy black substance which proved to be calcite\r\nfilled with minute crystals of magnetite.\r\n\r\nIn the western strip less exploration had been performed and little\r\ncould be learned about the ore deposits. Loose pieces of native silver\r\nhad been found by W. H. Margueratt in narrow fissures on M.R. 1798, but\r\nthe vein material was not exposed.\r\n\r\nOutside the Gowganda area systematic prospecting was in progress at only\r\none point—Wapus creek. Under the management of Mr. Robert Lett a group\r\nof nine claims was being stripped and trenched, with the result that\r\nnumerous calcite veins had been traced through a diabase showing the\r\nsame complex intermingling of basic and acid phases and aplite dikes as\r\nat Gowganda. Chalcopyrite and cobalt bloom were abundant, and smaltite\r\nhad been found as disseminations in the wall rock. Lumps of native\r\nbismuth weighing several ounces had been taken from a fissure in an\r\naplite dike, analyses of which showed it to contain silver.\r\n\r\nTentative exploration was being conducted along Duncan lake and east of\r\nFirth lake, but not with the closeness and persistence which the\r\ntopography of these veins require. In general the veins seen on Duncan\r\nlake are exceptionally rich in quartz, and gash veins are common.\r\nChalcopyrite, pyrite and galena are the most noticeable metalliferous\r\nminerals, but cobalt bloom stains are frequently observable. So far as\r\nknown no attention has been given to the large diabase body between\r\nDuncan lake and the West branch, although its size and varied\r\ncomposition are thought to make it a desirable prospecting ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FUTURE POSSIBILITIES.\r\n\r\nThe present knowledge of the Gowganda area indicates it to be highly\r\nmineralized, at least in so far as number of veins and surface showings\r\nare concerned. The number of discoveries within its area of ten square\r\nmiles is steadily increasing. The area, character of the mineral\r\nassociation and the richness of the surface showings are comparable with\r\nthose of Cobalt. There is a general similarity in the geological\r\nconditions. The mineralized veins in Gowganda occur in the diabase as do\r\nsome of the good Cobalt veins. There are, it is true, local differences,\r\nbut the resemblances are more pronounced than the differences and lead\r\nto the hope that exploitation will reveal similar underground\r\nconditions. The well mineralized veins are sufficiently long and uniform\r\non the surface to suggest similarly persistent vertical dimensions.\r\nFurther geological work may reveal something definite concerning the\r\ncharacter and size of the diabase bodies which form the country rock,\r\nand thus afford a basis for predicting their subterranean distribution.\r\nWhile there are grounds for hoping that the veins will persist in depth,\r\nthis has not yet been proved, nor, if this is the case, that the\r\nmineralization and values are also persistent.\r\n\r\nThe relative importance of Gowganda is therefore a matter of uncertainty\r\nas yet, but it may be confidently affirmed that for its state of\r\ndevelopment the outlook is very favourable, and the number of veins,\r\narea of mineralization and rich surface showings afford good grounds for\r\nhoping that some at least of the veins will be found to be commercially\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nThe details of igneous intrusion, differentiation and mineralization may\r\nnever be sufficiently understood to allow of accurate prediction\r\nregarding the location of silver deposits, but a general conception of\r\nthe sequence of events culminating in their formation does permit of the\r\nformulation of certain criteria useful in the search for ores. Evidence\r\nis accumulating to show that the silver-cobalt mineralizations in the\r\nTimiskaming region are connected with a late stage of differentiation in\r\nthe magma which supplied the quartz diabase and aplite. It seems\r\nreasonable, therefore, to anticipate ore deposits in or near such\r\nbodies, especially if they are of large size and have undergone\r\nimportant chemical differentiation, that is, if they contain a varied\r\nand extensive association of basic and acid phases of the diabase.\r\nPre-existing channels to receive the mineralizers are also necessary and\r\ntheir distribution a matter of vital importance, but in this region they\r\nappear to have been everywhere abundant.\r\n\r\nThese conditions appear to exist quite as fully at several other\r\nlocalities besides Gowganda. At Wapus creek they seem identical and,\r\nindeed, results obtained thus far indicate that some mineralization of\r\nthe silver-cobalt type exists. Between Duncan lake and the West branch\r\nthe conditions require further study, but, as now known, are not\r\ndiscouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                COPPER.\r\n\r\nThe chalcopyrite, which seems a much more constant constituent of the\r\nveins associated with the quartz diabase, is sometimes aggregated into\r\nbunches which yield ore specimens of such excellent appearance as to\r\narouse interest. The ore is, however, confined to veins a few inches in\r\nwidth and so scattered as to render them valueless. Occurrences of this\r\nkind characterize most of the great diabase bodies, examples of which\r\noccur on Mosher lake, between the North-east and North-west arms of\r\nGowganda lake and elsewhere. The chalcopyrite is sometimes superficially\r\naltered to malachite and azurite.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               IRON ORE.\r\n\r\n_Hematite._—Excellent specular and kidney ore is known to exist a short\r\ndistance east of Nest lake, but the locality was not visited owing to\r\nthe more urgent requirements of other portions of the district.\r\nSpecimens of the ore obtained, however, proved to be of excellent\r\ncharacter, with little admixture of silica or other foreign matter. The\r\nore body is thought to be of vertical tabular form, occupying a\r\nfissure-like space. Its limits are not known, consequently nothing can\r\nbe yet stated regarding the commercial possibility of the deposit.\r\n\r\nSpecular ore was seen on mining claim T.R. 2009, near the north-east end\r\nof Firth lake, occupying a fissure in the Keewatin. The ore is of good\r\nquality, but the outcrop is of insignificant size, the fissure being\r\nonly about 2 feet wide, and no ore occurring in either the chlorite\r\nschist or reddish granite which lie on either side.\r\n\r\nSpecular ore also occurs in the basal conglomerate of the Huronian\r\nseries, filling the interstices between the pebbles where an original\r\ncement was deficient. At the south end of Kenisheong lake the\r\nconglomerate appears at the water’s edge, and the hematite may be\r\nobserved while paddling near shore. The same thing occurs at the narrows\r\non Duncan lake, just south of the central expansion. In neither case is\r\nthe ore in commercially valuable quantity.\r\n\r\n_Magnetite._—Keewatin iron formation exists about one-half mile to the\r\nnorth-east of Gowganda lake. A brief visit was paid to some claims\r\nbelonging to Mr. Cryderman where the formation is well exposed. The\r\nKeewatin, which is partially overlain by Huronian and traversed by\r\ndiabase, consists of dark grey or black, banded chert or quartzite\r\nassociated with chlorite schist. The dark bands, usually only a few\r\ninches in width, are full of disseminated magnetite grains. No\r\nconcentrations were noticed and the richest bands would probably yield\r\nless than 30 per cent metallic iron, consequently the present showings\r\ncannot be considered valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ASBESTOS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Distribution._\r\n\r\nIn the Keewatin area between Firth and Obushkong lakes there occur\r\nmasses of a basic igneous rock through whose decomposition serpentine\r\nand asbestos have been developed. The localities given in connexion with\r\nthe description of the Keewatin may be briefly restated. Two bodies were\r\nfound. One of these, lying east of Foot lake and 20 chains from\r\nObushkong was traced for a width of 4 chains, but nothing learned of its\r\nnorth and south extent. It consists very largely of green serpentine\r\ntraversed by a network of fine, white weathering veins of asbestos. More\r\nextensive outcrops exist along the east shore of Firth lake. At somewhat\r\nmore than a mile from the foot of the lake and near a small log shack at\r\nthe water’s edge a considerable mass of partially decomposed wehrlite,\r\nserpentine, and asbestos is visible. The main mass is of dark green\r\ncolour, the asbestos traversing it abundantly as a series of glistening\r\nbright green threads. The seams are small, none being found more than\r\n1/4ʺ in width, but the asbestos fibres are fine and elastic. The\r\nserpentine is often coarsely fibrous but brittle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ORIGIN.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic examination shows the serpentine and asbestos to be the\r\nproduct of decomposition of the wehrlite, a nearly black medium grained\r\nigneous type. Alteration has obscured its original character, but\r\nsufficient of the primary constituents remain to admit of its\r\ndetermination. It consisted of olivine, diallage, and common hornblende,\r\nwith considerable ilmenite and apatite, but plagioclase is apparently\r\nabsent. Hornblende and diallage form the basis of the section in which\r\nlie abundant rounded or idiomorphic grains of olivine. The latter is\r\ncompletely altered to a matted intergrowth of fibrous serpentine\r\ncontaining scattered grains of black iron ore. Diallage persists as\r\ncolourless bi-refringent remnants enclosed by a felted mass of\r\ndecomposition products, chiefly long scales of talc. The hornblende is\r\nfresher and strongly pleochroic, the tints being green; its alteration\r\nbegins by bleaching, followed by development of colourless fibres of low\r\nbi-refringence, possibly serpentine. Primary ilmenite is replaced by\r\nirregular patches of leucoxene, showing gridiron structure. The final\r\nproduct of alteration is a soft green serpentine rock composed almost\r\nwholly of that mineral.\r\n\r\nThe limits of these masses are exceedingly difficult to define, owing to\r\nthe fact that they are associated with other Keewatin rock and basic\r\nforms of the post-Huronian diabase, to which it presents considerable\r\nresemblance. The asbestos actually seen is probably too short and small\r\nin amount to be valuable, but the high commercial value of this material\r\nrenders delimitation of the wehrlite masses advisable. Asbestos of very\r\ngood quality has been found by Mr. George Rahn in the vicinity of\r\nSinclair mountain, so that this mineral may be one of the district’s\r\nlatent resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CANADA\r\n\r\n                          DEPARTMENT OF MINES\r\n\r\n                        GEOLOGICAL SURVEY BRANCH\r\n\r\n    HON.
