Several of them, however, merit citation. Among\r\nthe galvanometers, we remarked an apparatus that was exhibited by\r\nProf. Zenger, of Prague. The construction of this reminded us of that\r\nof other galvanometers, but it was interesting in that its inventor\r\nhad combined in it a series of arrangements that permitted of varying\r\nits sensitiveness within very wide limits. This apparatus, which Prof.\r\nZenger calls a \"Universal Rheometer\" (Fig. 1), consists of a bobbin\r\nwhose interior is formed of a piece of copper, whose edges do not\r\nmeet, and which is connected by strips of copper with two terminals.\r\nThis internal shell is capable of serving for currents of quantity,\r\nand, when the two terminals are united by a wire, it may serve as a\r\ndeadener. Above this copper shell there are two identical coils of\r\nwire which may, according to circumstances, be coupled in tension or\r\nin series, or be employed differentially. Reading is performed either\r\nby the aid of a needle moving over a dial, or by means of a mirror,\r\nwhich is not shown in the figure. Finally, there is a lateral scale,\r\nR, which carries a magnetized bar, A, that may be slid toward the\r\ngalvanometer. This magnet is capable of rendering the needle less\r\nsensitive or of making it astatic. In order to facilitate this\r\noperation, the magnet carries at its extremity a tube which contains a\r\nbar of soft iron that may be moved slightly so as to vary the length\r\nof the magnet. Prof. Zenger calls this arrangement a magnetic vernier.\r\nIt will be seen that, upon combining all the elements of the\r\napparatus, we can obtain very different combinations; and, according\r\nto the inventor, his rheometer is a substitute for a dozen\r\ngalvanometers of various degrees of sensitiveness, and permits of\r\nmeasuring currents of from 20 amperes down to 1/50000000 an ampere.\r\nThe apparatus may even be employed for measuring magnetic forces, as\r\nit constitutes a very sensitive magnetometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--ZENGER'S UNIVERSAL RHEOMETER.]\r\n\r\nProf. Zenger likewise had on exhibition a \"Universal Electrometer\"\r\n(Fig. 2), in which the fine wire that served as an electrometric\r\nneedle was of magnetized steel suspended by a cotton thread. In this\r\ninstrument, a silver wire, t, terminating in a ball, is fixed to a\r\nsupport, C, hanging from a brass disk, P, placed upon the glass case\r\nof the apparatus. It will be seen that if we bring an electrified body\r\nnear the disk, P, a deviation of the needle will occur. The\r\nsensitiveness of the latter may be regulated by a magnetic system like\r\nthat of the galvanometer. Finally, a disk, P', which may be slid up\r\nand down its support, permits of the instrument being used as a\r\ncondensing electrometer, by giving it, according to the distance of\r\nthe disks, different degrees of sensitiveness. One constructor who\r\nfurnished much to this part of the exhibition was Mr. Th. Edelmann of\r\nMunich, whose apparatus are represented in a group in Fig. 3. Among\r\nthem we remark the following: A quadrant electrometer (Fig. 4), in\r\nwhich the horizontal 8-shaped needle is replaced by two connected\r\ncylindrical surfaces that move in a cylinder formed of four parts; a\r\nVon Beetz commutator; spyglasses with scale for reading measuring\r\ninstruments (Fig. 3); apparatus for the study of magnetic variations,\r\nof Lamont (Fig. 3) and of Wild (Fig. 5); different types of the\r\nWiedemann galvanometer; an electrometer for atmospheric observations\r\n(Fig. 6); a dropping apparatus (Fig. 7), in which the iron ball opens\r\none current at a time at the moment it leaves the electro-magnet and\r\nwhen it reaches the foot of the support, these two breakages producing\r\ntwo induction sparks that exactly limit the length to be taken in\r\norder to measure the time upon the tracing of the chronoscope\r\ntuning-fork; an absolute galvanometer; a bifilar galvanometer (Fig. 8)\r\nfor absolute measurements, in which the helix is carried by two\r\nvertical steel wires stretched from o to u, and which is rendered\r\ncomplete by a mirror for the reading, and a second and fixed helix, so\r\nthat an electro-dynamometer may be made of it; and, finally, a\r\ngalvanometer for strong currents, having a horseshoe magnet pivoted\r\nupon a vertically divided column which is traversed by the current,\r\nand a plug that may be arranged at different heights between the two\r\nparts of the column so as to render the apparatus more sensitive (Fig.\r\n9).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--ZENGER'S UNIVERSAL ELECTROMETER.]\r\n\r\nWe may likewise cite the exhibit of Mr. Eugene Hartmann of Wurtzburg,\r\nwhich comprised a series of apparatus of the same class as those that\r\nwe have just enumerated--spyglasses for the reading of apparatus,\r\ngalvanometers, magnetometers, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--EXHIBIT OF TH. EDELMANN.]\r\n\r\nSpecially worthy of remark were the apparatus of Mr. Kohlrausch for\r\nmeasuring resistances by means of induction currents, and a whole\r\nseries of accessory instruments.\r\n\r\nAmong the objects shown by other exhibitors must be mentioned Prof.\r\nVon Waltenhofen's differential electromagnetic balance. In this, two\r\niron cylinders are suspended from the extremities of a balance. One of\r\nthem is of solid iron, and the other is of thin sheet iron and of\r\nlarger diameter and is balanced by an additional weight. Both of them\r\nenter, up to their center, two solenoids. If a strong current be\r\npassed into these latter, the solid cylinder will be attracted; but\r\nif, on the contrary, the current be weak, the hollow cylinder will be\r\nattracted. If the change in the current's intensity occur gradually,\r\nthere will be a moment in which the cylinders will remain in\r\nequilibrium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--EDELMANN'S QUADRANT ELECTROMETER.]\r\n\r\nProf. Zenger's differential photometer that we shall finally cite is\r\nan improvement upon Bunsen's. In the latter the position of the\r\nobserver's eye not being fixed, the aspect of the spot changes\r\naccordingly, and errors are liable to result therefrom. Besides,\r\nbecause of the non-parallelism of the luminous rays, each of the two\r\nsurfaces is not lighted equally, and hence again there may occur\r\ndivergences. In order to avoid such inconveniences, Prof. Zenger gives\r\nhis apparatus (Fig. 10) the following form: The screen, D, is\r\ncontained in a cubical box capable of receiving, through apertures,\r\nlight from sources placed upon the two rules, R and R'. A flaring\r\ntube, P, fixes the position of the eye very definitely. As for the\r\nscreen, this is painted with black varnish, and three vertical\r\nwindows, about an inch apart, are left in white upon its paper. Over\r\none of the halves of these parts a solution of stearine is passed. To\r\noperate with the apparatus, in comparing two lights, the central spot\r\nis first brought to invisibility, and the distances of the sources are\r\nmeasured. A second determination is at once made by causing one of the\r\ntwo other spots to disappear, and the mean of the two results is then\r\ntaken. As, at a maximum, there is a difference corresponding to 3/100\r\nof a candle between the illumination of the two neighboring windows,\r\nin the given conditions of the apparatus, the error is thus limited to\r\na half of this value, or 2 per cent. of that of one candle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--WILD'S APPARATUS FOR STUDYING MAGNETIC\r\nVARIATIONS.]\r\n\r\nAmong the apparatus designed for demonstration in lecture courses, we\r\nremarked a solenoid of Prof. Von Beetz for demonstrating the\r\nconstitution of magnets (Fig. 11), and in which eight magnetized\r\nneedles, carrying mica disks painted half white and half black, move\r\nunder the influence of the currents that are traversing the solenoid,\r\nor of magnets that are bought near to it externally. Another apparatus\r\nof the same inventor is the lecture-course galvanometer (Fig. 3), in\r\nwhich the horizontal needle bends back vertically over the external\r\nsurface of a cylinder that carries divisions that are plainly visible\r\nto spectators at a distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--ELECTROMETER FOR ATMOSPHERIC OBSERVATIONS.]\r\n\r\nFinally, let us cite an instrument designed for demonstrating the\r\nprinciple of the Gramme machine. A circular magnet, AA', is inserted\r\ninto a bobbin, B, divided into two parts, and moves under the\r\ninfluence of a disk, L, actuated by a winch, M. This system permits of\r\nstudying the currents developed in each portion of the bobbin during\r\nthe revolution of the ring (Fig. 12).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--WIEDEMANN'S CURRENT BREAKER.]\r\n\r\nTo end our review of the scientific apparatus at the exhibition we\r\nshall merely mention Mr. Van Rysselberghe's registering\r\nthermometrograph (shown in Figs. 13 and 14), and shall then say a few\r\nwords concerning two types of registering apparatus--Mr. Harlacher's\r\nwater-current register and Prof. Von Beetz's chronograph.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--WIEDEMANN'S BIFILAR GALVANOMETER.]\r\n\r\nMr. Harlacher's apparatus was devised by him for studying the deep\r\ncurrents of the Elbe. It is carried (Fig. 15) by a long, vertical,\r\nhollow rod which is plunged into the river. A cord that passes over a\r\npulley, P, allows of the apparatus, properly so called, being let down\r\nto a certain depth in the water. What is registered is the velocity of\r\nthe vanes that are set in action by the current, and to effect such\r\nregistry each revolution of the helix produces in the box, C, an\r\nelectric contact that closes the circuit in the cable, F, attached to\r\nthe terminals, B. This cable forms part of a circuit that includes a\r\npile and a registering apparatus that is seen at L, outside of the box\r\nin which it is usually inclosed. In certain cases, a bell whose sound\r\nindicates the velocity of the current to the ear is substituted for\r\nthe registering apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--WIEDEMANN'S GALVANOMETER FOR STRONG CURRENTS.]\r\n\r\nFig. 16 represents another type of the same apparatus in which the\r\nmechanism of the contact is uncovered. The supporting rod is likewise\r\nin this type utilized as a current conductor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--ZENGER'S DIFFERENTIAL PHOTOMETER.]\r\n\r\nIt now remains to say a few words about Prof. Von Beetz's chronograph.\r\nThis instrument (Fig. 17) is designed for determining the duration of\r\ncombustion of different powders, the velocity of projectiles, etc. The\r\nregistering drum, T, is revolved by hand through a winch, L, and the\r\ntime is inscribed thereon by an electric tuning fork, S, set in motion\r\nby the large electro-magnet, E F. Each undulation of the curves\r\ncorresponds to a hundredth of a second. The tuning-fork and the\r\nregistering electro-magnets, G and H, are placed upon a regulatable\r\nsupport, C, by means of which they may be given any position desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--VON BEETZ'S SOLENOID FOR DEMONSTRATING THE\r\nCONSTITUTION OF MAGNETS.]\r\n\r\nThe style, c, of the magnet, C, traces a point every second in order\r\nto facilitate the reading. The style, b, of the electro-magnet, H,\r\nregisters the beginning and end of the phenomena that are being\r\nstudied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--APPARATUS FOR DEMONSTRATING THE PRINCIPLE OF\r\nTHE GRAMME MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is arranged in such a way that indications may thus be\r\nobtained upon the drum by means of induction sparks jumping between\r\nthe style and the surface of the cylinder. To the left of the figure\r\nis seen the apparatus constructed by Lieutenant Ziegler for\r\nexperimenting on the duration of combustion of bomb fuses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--VAN RYSSELBERGHE'S REGISTERING\r\nTHERMOMETROGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nShortly after the drum has commenced revolving, the contact, K, opens\r\na current which supports the heavy armature, P, of an electro-magnet,\r\nM. This weight, P, falls upon the rod, d, and inflames the fuse, Z, at\r\nthat very instant. At this precise moment the electro-magnet, H,\r\ninscribes a point, and renews it only when the cartridge at the\r\nextremity of the fuse explodes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--VAN RYSSELBERGHE'S REGISTERING\r\nTHERMOMETROGRAPH.]\r\n\r\nThis apparatus perhaps offers the inconvenience that the drum must be\r\nrevolved by hand, and it would certainly be more convenient could it\r\nbe put in movement at different velocities by means of a clockwork\r\nmovement that would merely have to be thrown into gear at the desired\r\nmoment. As it is, however, it presents valuable qualities, and,\r\nalthough it has already been employed in Germany for some time, it\r\nwill be called upon to render still more extensive services.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--HARLACHER'S APPARATUS FOR STUDYING DEEP\r\nCURRENTS IN RIVERS.]\r\n\r\nWe have now exhausted the subject of the apparatus of precision that\r\nwere comprised in the Munich Exhibition. In general, it may be said\r\nthat this class of instruments was very well represented there as\r\nregards numbers, and, on another hand, the manufacturers are to be\r\ncongratulated for the care bestowed on their construction.--_La\r\nLumiere Electrique_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--HARLACHER'S APPARATUS FOR STUDYING DEEP\r\nCURRENTS IN RIVERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--VON BEETZ'S CHRONOGRAPH.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER VOLTAMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Hammerl, of the Vienna Academy of Sciences, has made some\r\nexperiments upon the disturbing influences on the correct indications\r\nof a copper voltameter. He investigated the effects of the intensity\r\nof the current, the distance apart of the plates, and their\r\npreparation before weighing. The main conclusion which he arrives at\r\nis this: That in order that the deposit should be proportional to the\r\nintensity of the current, the latter ought not to exceed seven ampères\r\nper square decimeter of area of the cathode.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of steel ropes as transmitters of power, Professor Osborne\r\nReynolds says these have a great advantage over shafts, for the stress\r\non the section will be uniform, the velocity will be uniform, and may\r\nbe at least ten to fifteen times as great as with shafts--say 100 ft.\r\nper second; the rope is carried on friction pulleys, which may be at\r\ndistances 500 ft. or 600 ft. so that the coefficient of friction will\r\nnot be more than 0.015, instead of 0.04.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW OXIDE OF COPPER BATTERY.\r\n\r\nBy MM. F. DE LALANDE and G. CHAPERON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have succeeded in forming a new battery with a single liquid and\r\nwith a solid depolarizing element by associating oxide of copper,\r\ncaustic potash, and zinc.\r\n\r\nThis battery possesses remarkable properties. Depolarizing electrodes\r\nare easily formed of oxide of copper. It is enough to keep it in\r\ncontact with a plate or a cell of iron or copper constituting the\r\npositive pole of the element.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents a very simple arrangement. At the bottom of a glass\r\njar, V, we place a box of sheet iron, A, containing oxide of copper,\r\nB. To this box is attached a copper wire insulated from the zinc by a\r\npiece of India rubber tube. The zinc is formed of a thick wire of this\r\nmetal coiled in the form of a flat spiral, D, and suspended from a\r\ncover, E, which carries a terminal, F, connected with the zinc; an\r\nIndia-rubber tube, G, covers the zinc at the place where it dips into\r\nthe liquid, to prevent its being eaten away at this level.\r\n\r\nThe jar is filled with a solution containing 30 or 40 per cent. of\r\npotash. This arrangement is similar to that of a Callaud element, with\r\nthis difference--that the depolarizing element is solid and insoluble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nTo prevent the inconveniences of the manipulation of the potash, we\r\ninclose a quantity of this substance in the solid state necessary for\r\nan element in the box which receives the oxide of copper, and furnish\r\nit with a cover supported by a ring of caoutchouc. It suffices then\r\nfor working the battery to open the box of potash, to place it at the\r\nbottom of the jar, and to add water to dissolve the potash; we then\r\npour in the copper oxide inclosed in a bag.\r\n\r\nWe also form the oxide of copper very conveniently into blocks. Among\r\nthe various means which might be employed, we prefer the following:\r\n\r\nWe mix with the oxide of copper oxychloride of magnesium in the form\r\nof paste so as to convert the whole into a thick mass, which we\r\nintroduce into metal boxes.\r\n\r\nThe mass sets in a short time, or very rapidly by the action of heat,\r\nand gives porous blocks of a solidity increasing with the quantity of\r\ncement employed (5 to 10 per cent.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nFig. 2 represents an arrangement with blocks. The jar V, is provided\r\nwith a cover of copper, E, screwing into the glass. This cover carries\r\ntwo vertical plates of sheet-iron, A, A', against which are fixed the\r\nprismatic blocks, B, B, by means of India rubber bands. The terminal,\r\nC, carried by the cover constitutes the positive pole. The zinc is\r\nformed of a single pencil, D, passing into a tube fixed to the center\r\nof the cover. The India rubber, G, is folded back upon this tube so as\r\nto make an air-tight joint.\r\n\r\nThe cover carries, besides, another tube, H, covered by a split\r\nIndia-rubber tube, which forms a safety valve.\r\n\r\nThe closing is made hermetical by means of an India rubber tube, K,\r\nwhich presses against the glass and the cover. The potash to charge\r\nthe element is in pieces, and is contained either in the glass jar\r\nitself or in a separate box of sheet-iron.\r\n\r\nApplying the same arrangement, we form hermetically sealed elements\r\nwith a single plate of a very small size.\r\n\r\nThe employment of cells of iron, cast-iron, or copper, which are not\r\nattacked by the exciting liquid, allows us to easily construct\r\nelements exposing a large surface (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe cell, A, forming the positive pole of the battery is of iron plate\r\nbrazed upon vertical supports; it is 40 centimeters long by 20\r\ncentimeters wide, and about 10 centimeters high.\r\n\r\nWe cover the bottom with a layer of oxide of copper, and place in the\r\nfour corners porcelain insulators, L, which support a horizontal plate\r\nof zinc, D, D', raised at one end and kept at a distance from the\r\noxide of copper and from the metal walls of the cell; three-quarters\r\nof this is filled with a solution of potash. The terminals, C and M,\r\nfixed respectively to the iron cell and to the zinc, serve to attach\r\nthe leading wires. To avoid the too rapid absorption of the carbonic\r\nacid of the air by the large exposed surface, we cover it with a thin\r\nlayer of heavy petroleum (a substance uninflammable and without\r\nsmell), or better still, we furnish the battery with a cover. These\r\nelements are easily packed so as to occupy little space.\r\n\r\nWe shall not discuss further the arrangements which may be varied\r\ninfinitely, but point out the principal properties of the oxide of\r\ncopper, zinc, and potash battery. As a battery with a solid\r\ndepolarizing element, the new battery presents the advantage of only\r\nconsuming its element, in proportion to its working; amalgamated zinc\r\nand copper are, in fact, not attacked by the alkaline solution, it is,\r\ntherefore, durable.\r\n\r\nIts electromotive force is very nearly one volt. Its internal\r\nresistance is very low. We may estimate it at 1/3 or 1/4 of an ohm for\r\npolar surfaces one decimeter square, separated by a distance of five\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\nThe rendering of these couples is considerable; the small cells shown\r\nin Figs. 1 and 2 give about two amperes in short circuit; the large\r\none gives 16 to 20 amperes. Two of these elements can replace a large\r\nBunsen cell. They are remarkably constant. We may say that with a\r\ndepolarizing surface double that of the zinc the battery will work\r\nwithout notable polarization, and almost until completely exhausted,\r\neven under the most unfavorable conditions. The transformation of the\r\nproducts, the change of the alkali into an alkaline salt of zinc, does\r\nnot perceptibly vary the internal resistance. This great constancy is\r\nchiefly due to the progressive reduction of the depolarizing electrode\r\nto the state of very conductive metal, which augments its conductivity\r\nand its depolarizing power.\r\n\r\nThe peroxide of manganese, which forms the base of an excellent\r\nbattery for giving a small rendering, possesses at first better\r\nconductivity than oxide of copper, but this property is lost by\r\nreduction and transformation into lower oxides. It follows that the\r\ncopper battery will give a very large quantity of electricity working\r\nthrough low resistances, while under these conditions manganese\r\nbatteries are rapidly polarized.\r\n\r\nThe energy contained in an oxide of copper and potash battery is very\r\ngreat, and far superior to that stored by an accumulator of the same\r\nweight, but the rendering is much less rapid. Potash may be employed\r\nin concentrated solution at 30, 40, 60 per cent.; solid potash can\r\ndissolve the oxide of zinc furnished by a weight of zinc more than\r\none-third of its own weight. The quantity of oxide of copper to be\r\nemployed exceeds by nearly one-quarter the weight of zinc which enters\r\ninto action. These data allow of the reduction of the necessary\r\nsubstances to a very small relative weight.\r\n\r\nThe oxide of copper batteries have given interesting results in their\r\napplication to telephones. For theatrical purposes the same battery\r\nmay be employed during the whole performance, instead of four or five\r\nbatteries. Their durability is considerable; three elements will work\r\ncontinuously, night and day, Edison's carbon microphones for more than\r\nfour months without sensible loss of power.\r\n\r\nOur elements will work for a hundred hours through low resistances,\r\nand can be worked at any moment, after several months, for example. It\r\nis only necessary to protect them by a cover from the action of the\r\ncarbonic acid of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe prefer potash to soda for ordinary batteries, notwithstanding its\r\nprice and its higher equivalent, because it does not produce, like\r\nsoda, creeping salts. Various modes of regeneration render this\r\nbattery very economical. The deposited copper absorbs oxygen pretty\r\nreadily by simple exposure to damp air, and can be used again. An\r\noxidizing flame produces the same result very rapidly.\r\n\r\nLastly, by treating the exhausted battery as an accumulator, that is\r\nto say, by passing a current through it in the opposite direction, we\r\nrestore the various products to their original condition; the copper\r\nabsorbs oxygen, and the alkali is restored, while the zinc is\r\ndeposited; but the spongy state of the deposited zinc necessitates its\r\nbeing submitted to a process, or to its being received upon a mercury\r\nsupport. Again, the oxide of copper which we employ, being a waste\r\nproduct of brazing and plate works, unless it be reduced, loses\r\nnothing of its value by its reduction in the battery; the\r\ndepolarization may therefore be considered as costing scarcely\r\nanything. The oxide of copper battery is a durable and valuable\r\nbattery, which by its special properties seems likely to replace\r\nadvantageously in a great number of applications the batteries at\r\npresent in use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARCOT'S SIX HORSE POWER STEAM ENGINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis horizontal steam engine, recently constructed by Mr. E.D. Farcot\r\nfor actuating a Cance dynamo-electric machine, consists of a cast iron\r\nbed frame, A, upon which are mounted all the parts. The two jacketed,\r\ncylinders, B and C, of different diameters, each contains a\r\nsimple-acting piston. The two pistons are connected by one rod in\r\ncommon, which is fixed at its extremity to a cross-head, D, running in\r\nslides, E and F, and is connected with the connecting rod, G. The head\r\nof the latter is provided with a bearing of large diameter which\r\nembraces the journal of the driving shaft, H.\r\n\r\nThe steam enters the valve-box through the orifice, J, which is\r\nprovided with a throttle-valve, L, that is connected with a governor\r\nplaced upon the large cylinder. The steam, as shown in Fig. 2 (which\r\nrepresents the piston at one end of its travel), is first admitted\r\nagainst the right surface of the small piston, which it causes to\r\neffect an entire stroke corresponding to a half-revolution of the\r\nfly-wheel. The stroke completed, the slide-valve, actuated by an\r\neccentric keyed to the driving shaft, returns backward and puts the\r\ncylinders, B and C, in communication. The steam then expands and\r\ndrives the large piston to the right, so as to effect the second half\r\nof the fly-wheel's revolution. The exhaust occurs through the valve\r\nchamber, which, at each stroke, puts the large cylinder in connection\r\nwith the eduction port, M.\r\n\r\nThe volume of air included between the two pistons is displaced at\r\nevery stroke, so that, according to the position occupied by the\r\npistons, it is held either by the large or small cylinder. The\r\nnecessary result of this is that a compression of the air, and\r\nconsequently a resistance, is brought about. In order to obviate this\r\ninconvenience, the constructor has connected the space between the two\r\npistons at the part, A', of the frame by a bent pipe. The air, being\r\nalternately driven into and sucked out of this chamber, A', of\r\nrelatively large dimensions, no longer produces but an insignificant\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FARCOT'S SIX H.P.

The motor being a single acting one, a\r\nsingle valve-plate suffices. This latter is, during its travel,\r\narrested at one end by a stop and at the other by a cam actuated by\r\nthe governor. Upon the axis of this cam there is keyed a gear wheel,\r\nwith an endless screw, which permits of regulating it by hand.\r\n\r\nThis engine, which runs at a pressure of from 5 to 6 kilogrammes,\r\nmakes 150 revolutions per minute and weighs 2,000 kilogrammes.\r\n--_Annales Industrielles_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOT LATHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe illustrate a foot lathe constructed by the Britannia Manufacturing\r\nCompany, of Colchester, and specially designed for use on board ships.\r\nThese lathes, says _Engineering_, are treble geared, in order that\r\nwork which cannot usually be done without steam power may be\r\naccomplished by foot. For instance, they will turn a 24 inch wheel or\r\nplate, or take a half-inch cut off a 3 inch shaft, much heavier work\r\nthan can ordinarily be done by such tools. They have 6 inch centers,\r\ngaps 7½ inches wide and 6½ inches deep, beds 4 feet 6 inches long by\r\n8¾ inches on the face and 6 inches in depth, and weigh 14 cwt. There\r\nare three speeds on the cone pulley, 9 inches, 6 inches, and 4 inches\r\nin diameter and 1½ inches wide. The gear wheels are 9/16 inch pitch\r\nand 1½ inches wide on face. The steel leading screw is 1½ inches in\r\ndiameter by ¼ inch pitch. Smaller sizes are made for torpedo boats and\r\nfor places where space is limited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LATHE FOR USE ON SHIPBOARD.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDLESS TROUGH CONVEYER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe endless trough conveyer is one of the latest applications of\r\nlink-belting, consisting primarily of a heavy chain belt carried over\r\na pair of wheels, and in the intermediate space a truck on which the\r\ntrain runs. This chain or belt is provided with pans which, as they\r\noverlap, form an endless trough. Power being applied to revolve one of\r\nthe wheels, the whole belt is thereby set in motion and at once\r\nbecomes an endless trough conveyer. The accompanying engraving\r\nillustrates a section of this conveyer. A few of the pans are removed,\r\nto show the construction of the links; and above this a link and\r\ncoupler are shown on a larger scale. As will be seen, the link is\r\nprovided with wings, to form a rigid support for the pan to be riveted\r\nto it. To reduce friction each link is provided with three rollers, as\r\nwill be seen in the engraving. This outfit makes a fireproof conveyer\r\nwhich will handle hot ore from roasting kiln to crusher, and convey\r\ncoal, broken stone, or other gritty and coarse material. The Link Belt\r\nMachinery Company, of Chicago, is now erecting for Mr. Charles E.\r\nCoffin, of Muirkirk, Md., about 450 ft. of this conveyer, which is to\r\ncarry the hot roasted iron ore from the kilns on an incline of about\r\none foot in twelve up to the crusher. This dispenses with the\r\nbarrow-men, and at an expenditure of a few more horsepower becomes a\r\nfaithful servant, ready for work in all weather and at all times of\r\nday or night. This company also manufactures ore elevators of any\r\ncapacity, which, used in connection with this apparatus, will handle\r\nperfectly anything in the shape of coarse, gritty material. It might\r\nbe added that the endless trough conveyer is no experiment. Although\r\ncomparatively new in this country, the American _Engineering and\r\nMining Journal_ says it has been in successful operation for some time\r\nin England, the English manufacturers of link-belting having had great\r\nsuccess with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENDLESS TROUGH CONVEYER.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILROAD GRADES OF TRUNK LINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the West Shore and Buffalo road its limit of grade is 30 feet to\r\nthe mile going west and north, and 20 feet to the mile going east and\r\nsouth. Next for easy grades comes the New York Central and Hudson\r\nRiver road. From New York to Albany, then up the valley of the Mohawk,\r\ntill it gradually reaches the elevation of Lake Erie, it is all the\r\ntime within the 500 foot level, and this is maintained by its\r\nconnections on the lake borders to Chicago, by the \"Nickel Plate,\" the\r\nLake Shore and Michigan Southern, and the Canada Southern and Michigan\r\nCentral.\r\n\r\nThe Erie, the Pennsylvania, and the Baltimore and Ohio roads pass\r\nthrough a country so mountainous that, much as they have expended to\r\nimprove their grades, it is practically impossible for them to attain\r\nthe easy grades so much more readily obtained by the trunk lines\r\nfollowing the great natural waterways originally extending almost from\r\nChicago to New York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH EXPRESS TRAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Journal of the Statistical Society_ for September contains an\r\nelaborate paper by Mr. E. Foxwell on \"English Express Trains; their\r\nAverage Speed, etc. with Notes on Gradients, Long Runs, etc.\" The\r\nauthor takes great pains to explain his definition of the term\r\n\"express trains,\" which he finally classifies thus: (a) The general\r\nrule; those which run under ordinary conditions, and attain a\r\njourney-speed of 40 and upward. These are about 85 per cent. of the\r\nwhole. (b) Equally good trains, which, running against exceptional\r\ndifficulties, only attain, perhaps, a journey speed as low as 36 or\r\n37. These are about 5 per cent. of the whole. (c) Trains which should\r\ncome under (a), but which, through unusually long stoppages or similar\r\ncauses, only reach a journey speed of 39. These are about 10 per\r\ncent.[1] of the whole.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: 10 per cent. of the number, but not of the mileage,\r\n  of the whole; for most of this class run short journeys.]\r\n\r\nHe next explains that by \"running average\" is meant: The average speed\r\nper hour while actually in motion from platform to platform, i.e., the\r\naverage speed obtained by deducting stoppages. Thus the 9-hour (up)\r\nGreat Northern \"Scotchman\" stops 49 minutes on its journey from\r\nEdinburgh to King's Cross, and occupies 8 hours 11 minutes in actual\r\nmotion; its \"running average\" is therefore 48 miles an hour, or,\r\nbriefly, \"r.a.=48.\" The statement for this train will thus appear:\r\nDistance in miles between Edinburgh and King's Cross, 392½; time, 9 h.\r\n0 m.; journey-speed, 43.6; minutes stopped, 49; running average, 48.\r\n\r\nMr. Foxwell then proceeds to describe in detail the performances of\r\nthe express trains of the leading English and Scottish railways--in\r\nIreland there are no trains which come under his definition of\r\n\"express\"--giving the times of journey, the journey-speeds, minutes\r\nstopped on way, and running averages, with the gradients and other\r\ncircumstances bearing on these performances. He sums up the results\r\nfor the United Kingdom, omitting fractions, as follows:\r\n\r\n  =========================================================================\r\n  Extent of|                   |           | Average  |         |         |\r\n  System   |                   | Distinct  | Journey- | Running | Express |\r\n  in Miles.|                   | Expresses.|  speed.  | Average.| Mileage.|\r\n  ---------+-------------------+-----------+----------+---------+---------+\r\n    1773   | North-Western     |   {54} 82 |    40    |    43   |  10,400 |\r\n           |                   |   {28}    |          |         |         |\r\n    1260   | Midland           |    66     |    41    |    45   |   8,860 |\r\n     928   | Great Northern    |   {48} 67 |    43    |    46   |   6,780 |\r\n           |                   |   {19}    |          |         |         |\r\n     907   | Great Eastern     |    34     |    41    |    43   |   3,040 |\r\n    2267   | Great Western     |    18     |    42    |    46   |   2,600 |\r\n    1519   | North-Eastern     |    19     |    40    |    43   |   2,110 |\r\n     290   | Manch., Sheffield,|    49     |    43    |    44   |   2,318 |\r\n           |   and Lincoln     |           |          |         |         |\r\n     767   | Caledonian        |    16     |    40    |    42   |   1,155 |\r\n     435   | Brighton          |    13     |    41    |    41   |   1,155 |\r\n     382   | South-Eastern     |    12     |    41    |    41   |     940 |\r\n     329   | Glasgow and       |     8     |    41    |    43   |     920 |\r\n           |   South-Western   |           |          |         |         |\r\n     796   | London and        |     3     |    41    |    44   |     890 |\r\n           |   South-Western   |           |          |         |         |\r\n     984   | North British     |    11     |    39    |    41   |     830 |\r\n     153   | Chatham and Dover |     9     |    42    |    43   |     690 |\r\n                               +-----------+----------+---------+---------+\r\n                               |   407     |    41    |    44   |  42,683 |\r\n  =========================================================================\r\n\r\nA total of 407 express trains, whose average journey-speed is 41.6,\r\nand which run 42,680 miles at an average \"running average\" of 44.3\r\nmiles per hour.\r\n\r\nIf we arrange the companies according to their speed instead of their\r\nmileage, the order is:\r\n\r\n                                   Average\r\n                                     r.a.

From four to six bags was the utmost that could\r\nbe got into the press at one time, and the cakes were pressed between\r\nwrappers of horsehair on similar material. All this involved a good\r\ndeal of manual labor, a cumberstone plant, and a considerable expense\r\nin the frequent replacing of the horsehair wrappers, each of which\r\ninvolved a cost of about £4. The modern requirements of trade have in\r\nevery branch of industry ruthlessly compelled the abandonment of the\r\nslow, easy-going methods which satisfied the times when competition\r\nwas less keen. Automatic mechanical arrangements, almost at every\r\nturn, more effectually and at greatly increased speed, complete\r\nmanufacturing operations previously performed by hand, and oil-seed\r\ncrushing machinery has been no exception to the general rule. The\r\nillustrations we give represent the latest developments in improved\r\noil-mill machinery introduced by Rose, Downs & Thompson, named the\r\n\"Colonial\" mill, and recently we had an opportunity of inspecting the\r\nmachinery complete before shipment to Calcutta, where it is being sent\r\nfor the approaching exhibition. As compared with the old system of\r\noil-seed crushing, Messrs. Rose, Downs & Thompson claim for their\r\nmethod, among other advantages, a great saving in driving power,\r\neconomy of space, a more perfect extraction of the oil, an improved\r\nbranding of the cakes, a saving of 50 per cent. in the labor employed\r\nin the press-room, with also a great saving in wear and tear, while\r\nthe process is equally applicable to linseed, cottonseed, rapeseed, or\r\nsimilar seeds. In addition to these improvements in the system, the\r\n\"Colonial\" mill has been specially designed in structural arrangement\r\nto meet the requirements of exporters. The machinery and engine are\r\nself-contained on an iron foundation, so that there is no need of\r\nskilled mechanics to erect the mill, nor of expensive stone\r\nfoundations, while the building covering the mill can, if desired, be\r\nof the lightest possible description, as no wall support is required.\r\nThe mill consists of the following machinery: A vertical steel boiler,\r\n3 ft. 7 in. diameter, 8 ft. 1½ in. high, with three cross tubes 7½ in.\r\ndiameter, shell 5/16 in. thick, crown 3/8 in. thick, uptake 9 in.\r\ndiameter, with all necessary fittings, and where wood fuel is used\r\nextra grate area can be provided. This boiler supplies the steam not\r\nonly for the engine, but also for heating and damping the seed in the\r\nkettle. The engine is vertical, with 8 in. cylinder and 12 in. stroke,\r\nwith high speed governors, and stands on the cast iron bed-plate of\r\nthe mill. This bed-plate, which is in three sections, is about 30 ft.\r\nlong, and is planed and shaped to receive the various machines, which,\r\nwhen the top is leveled, can be fixed in their respective places by\r\nany intelligent man, and when the machines are in position they form a\r\nsupport for the shafting. The seed to be crushed is stored in a wooden\r\nbin, placed above and behind the roll frame hopper. The roll frame has\r\nfour chilled cast iron rolls, 15 in. face, 12 in. diameter, so\r\narranged as to subject the seed to three rollings, with patent\r\npressure giving apparatus. These rolls are driven by fast and loose\r\npulleys by the shaft above. After the last rolling the seed falls\r\nthrough an opening in the foundation plate in a screen driven from the\r\nbottom roll shaft by a belt. This conveys the seed in a trough to a\r\nset of elevators, which supply it continuously to the kettle. This\r\nkettle, which is 3 ft. 6 in. internal diameter and 20 in. deep, is\r\nmade of cast iron and of specially strong construction. There is only\r\none steam joint in it, and to reduce the liability of leakage this\r\njoint is faced in a lathe. The inside furnishings of the kettle are a\r\ndamping apparatus with perforated boss, upright shaft, stirrer, and\r\ndelivery plate, and patent slide. The kettle body is fitted with a\r\nwood frame and covered with felt, which is inclosed within iron\r\nsheeting. The crushed seed is heated in the kettle to the required\r\ntemperature by steam from the boiler, and it is also damped by a jet\r\nof steam which is regulated by a wheel valve with indicating plate.\r\nWhen the required temperature has been obtained, the seed is withdrawn\r\nby a measuring box through a self-acting shuttle in the kettle bottom,\r\nand evenly distributed over a strip of bagging supported on a steel\r\ntray in a Virtue patent moulding machine, where it undergoes a\r\ncompression sufficient to reduce it to the size that can be taken in\r\nby the presses, but not sufficient to cause any extraction of the oil.\r\nThe seed leaves the moulding machine in the form of a thick cake from\r\nnine to eleven pounds in weight, and each press is constructed to take\r\nin twelve of these cakes at once. The press cylinders are 12 in.\r\ndiameter and are of crucible cast steel. To insure strength of\r\nconstruction and even distribution of strain throughout the press, all\r\nthe columns, cylinders, rams, and heads are planed and turned\r\naccurately to gauges, and the pockets that take the columns, in the\r\nplace of being cast, as is sometimes usual, with fitting strips top\r\nand bottom, are solid throughout, and are planed or slotted out of the\r\nsolid to gauges. The pressure is given by a set of hydraulic pumps\r\nmade of crucible cast steel and bored out of the solid. One of the\r\npump rams is 2½ in. diameter, and has a stroke of 7 in. This ram gives\r\nonly a limited pressure, and the arrangements are such as to obtain\r\nthis pressure upon each press in about fourteen seconds. This pump\r\nthen automatically ceases running, and the work is taken up by a\r\nsecond plunger, having a ram 1 in. diameter and stroke of 7 in., the\r\nsecond pump continuing its work until a gross pressure of two tons per\r\nsquare inch is attained, which is the maximum, and is arrived at in\r\nless than two minutes. For shutting off the communication between the\r\npresses, the stop valves are so arranged that either press may be let\r\ndown, or set to work without in the smallest degree affecting the\r\nother. The oil from the presses is caught in an oil tank behind, from\r\nwhich an oil pump, worked by an eccentric, forces it in any desired\r\ndirection. The cakes, on being withdrawn from the press, are stripped\r\nof the bagging and cut to size in a specially arranged paring machine,\r\nwhich is placed off the bed-plate behind the kettle, and is driven by\r\nthe pulley shown on the main shaft. The paring machine is also fitted\r\nwith an arrangement for reducing the parings to meal, which is\r\nreturned to the kettle, and again made up into cakes. The presses\r\nshown have corrugated press plates of Messrs. Rose, Downs & Thompson's\r\nlatest type, but the cakes produced by this process can have any\r\ndesired name or brand in block letters put upon them. The edges on the\r\nupper plate, it may be added, are found of great use in crushing some\r\nclasses of green or moist seed. The plant, of which we give\r\nillustrations opposite, is constructed to crush about four tons of\r\nseed per day of eleven hours, and the manual labor has been so reduced\r\nto a minimum that it is intended to be worked by one man, who moulds\r\nand puts the twenty-four cakes into the presses, and while they are\r\nunder pressure is engaged paring the cakes that have been previously\r\npressed. In crushing castor-oil seed, a decorticating machine or\r\nseparator can be combined with the mill, but in such a case the engine\r\nand boiler would require to be made larger.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ENGLISH ADAPTATION OF THE AMERICAN OIL MILL.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR SEPARATING SUBSTANCES CONTAINED IN THE WASTE WATERS OF\r\nPAPER MILLS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor extracting such useful materials as are contained in the waste\r\nwaters of paper mills, cloth manufactories, etc., and, at the same\r\ntime, for purifying such waters, Mr. Schuricht, of Siebenlehn, employs\r\na sort of filter like that shown in the annexed Figs. 1 and 2, and\r\nunderneath which he effects a vacuum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHURICHTS FILTERING APPARATUS. Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus, A, is divided into two compartments, which are\r\nseparated by a longitudinal partition. Above the stationary bottom, a,\r\nthere is arranged a lattice-work grating or a strong wire cloth, b,\r\nupon which rests the filtering material, c, properly so called. The\r\nreservoir is divided transversely by several partitions, d, of\r\ndifferent heights. The liquor entering through the leader, f,\r\ntraverses the apparatus slowly, as a consequence of the somewhat wide\r\nsection of the layer. But, in order that it may traverse the filtering\r\nmaterial, it is necessary that, in addition to this horizontal motion,\r\nit shall have a downward one. As far as to the top of the partitions,\r\nd, there form in front of the latter certain layers which do not\r\nparticipate in the horizontal motion, but which can only move\r\ndownward, as a consequence of the permeability of the bottom. It\r\nresults from this that the heaviest solid particles deposit in the\r\nfirst compartment, while the others run over the first partition, d,\r\nand fall into one of the succeeding compartments, according to their\r\ndegree of fineness, while the clarified water makes its exit through\r\nthe spout, g.

PARSONS, JR., C.E.\r\n\r\n\r\nI send you a description of a device that I got up for the N.Y., L.E.,\r\nand W.R.R. division office at Port Jervis, by which I overcame the\r\ndifficulties incident to large glasses. The glass was 58 inches long,\r\n84 inches wide, and 3/8 inch thick. It was heavily framed with ash. In\r\norder to keep the back from warping out of shape, I had it made of\r\nthoroughly seasoned ash strips 1\" x 1\". Each strip was carefully\r\nplaned, and then they were glued and screwed together, while across\r\nthe ends were fastened strips with their grain running transversely.\r\nThis back was then covered on side next to the glass with four\r\nthicknesses of common gray blanketing. Instead of applying the holding\r\npressure by thumb cleats at the periphery, it was effected by two long\r\npressure strips running across the back placed at about one quarter\r\nthe length of the frame from the ends, and held by a screw at the\r\ncenter. The ends of these strips were made so as to fit in slots in\r\nthe frame at a slight angle, so that as the pressure strips were\r\nturned it gave them a binding pressure at the same time. In other\r\nwords, it is the same principle as is commonly used to keep backs in\r\nsmall picture frames. This arrangement, instead of holding the back at\r\nthe edges only, and so allowing the center to fall away from the\r\nglass, distributed it evenly over the whole surface and always kept it\r\nin position. The frame was run in and out of the printing room on a\r\nlittle railway on which it rested on four grooved brass sheaves, one\r\npair being at one end, while the other was just beyond the center, so\r\nthe frame could be revolved in direction of its length without\r\ntrouble. In order to raise the heavy back, I had a pulley-wheel\r\nfastened to the ceiling, through which a rope passed, with a ring that\r\ncould be attached to a corresponding hook at the side of the back, in\r\norder to hoist it or lower it. Although that is an extremely large\r\napparatus, yet by means of the above device it was worked easily and\r\nrapidly, and gave every satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe solution used was of the same proportions as had been adopted in\r\nthe other engineering offices of the road:\r\n\r\n  Citrate iron and ammonium      1-7/8 oz.\r\n  Red prussiate potash (C.P.)    1-1/4 oz.\r\n\r\nDissolve separately in 4 oz. distilled water each, and mix when ready\r\nto use. But by putting mixture in dark bottle, and that in a tight box\r\nimpervious to light, it can be kept two or three weeks.\r\n\r\nIn some frames used at the School of Mines for making large blue\r\nprints a similar device has been in use for several years. Instead,\r\nhowever, of the heavy and cumbrous back used by Mr. Parsons, a light,\r\nsomewhat flexible back of one-quarter inch pine is employed, covered\r\nwith heavy Canton flannel and several thicknesses of newspaper. The\r\npressure is applied by light pressure strips of ash somewhat thicker\r\nat the middle than at the ends, which give a fairly uniform pressure\r\nacross the width of the frame sufficient to hold the back firmly\r\nagainst the glass at all points. This system has been used with\r\nsuccess for frames twenty-seven by forty-two inches, about half as\r\nlarge as the one described by Mr. Parsons. A frame of this size can be\r\neasily handled without mechanical aids. Care should be taken to avoid\r\ntoo great thickness and too much spring in the pressure strips, or the\r\nplate glass may be broken by excessive pressure. The strips used are\r\nabout five-eighths of an inch thick at the middle, and taper to about\r\nthree-eighths of an inch at the ends.\r\n\r\nThe formulæ for the solution given by Whittaker, Laudy, and Parsons\r\nare practically identical so far as the proportions of citrate of iron\r\nand ammonia and of red prussiate of potash, 3 of the former to 2 of\r\nthe latter, but differ in the amount of water. Laudy's formula calls\r\nfor about 5 parts of water to 1 of the salts, Whittaker's for 4 parts,\r\nand Parson's for a little more than 2 parts. The stronger the solution\r\nthe longer the exposure required. With very strong solutions a large\r\nportion of the Prussian blue formed comes off in the washwater, and\r\nwhen printing from glass negatives the fine lines and lighter tints\r\nare apt to suffer. The blue color, however, will be deep and the\r\nwhites clear. With weak solutions the blues will be fainter and the\r\nwhites bluish. Heavily sized paper gives the best results. The\r\naddition of a little mucilage to the solution is sometimes an\r\nadvantage, producing the same results as strength of solution, by\r\nincreasing the amount adhering to the paper. With paper deficient in\r\nsizing the mucilage also makes the whites clearer.--_H.S.M., Sch. of\r\nM.

In a camp you have the\r\nsimplest form of dealing with these matters. The water supply is\r\nlimited. Waste water and liquid ejection are absorbed by the ground;\r\nbut a camp unprovided with latrines would always be in a state of\r\ndanger from epidemic disease. One of the most frequent causes of an\r\nunhealthy condition of the air of a camp in former times has been\r\neither neglecting to provide latrines, so that the ground outside the\r\ncamp becomes covered with filth, or constructing the latrines too\r\nshallow, and exposing too large a surface to rain, sun, and air. The\r\nQuartermaster-General's regulations provide against these\r\ncontingencies; but I may as well here recapitulate the general\r\nprinciples which govern camp latrines. Latrines should be so managed\r\nthat no smell from them should ever reach the men's tents. To insure\r\nthis very simple precautions only are required:\r\n\r\n1. The latrines should be placed to leeward with respect to prevailing\r\nwinds, and at as great a distance from the tents as is compatible with\r\nconvenience. 2. They should be dug narrow and deep, and their contents\r\ncovered over every evening with at least a foot of fresh earth. A\r\ncertain bulk and thickness of earth are required to absorb the\r\nputrescent gas, otherwise it will disperse itself and pollute the air\r\nto a considerable distance round. 3. When the latrine is filled to\r\nwithin 2 ft. 6 in. or 3 ft. of the surface, earth should be thrown\r\ninto it, and heaped over it like a grave to mark its site. 4. Great\r\ncare should be taken not to place latrines near existing wells, nor to\r\ndig wells near where latrines have been placed. The necessity of these\r\nprecautions to prevent wells becoming polluted is obvious. Screens\r\nmade out of any available material are, of course, required for\r\nlatrines. This arrangement applies to a temporary camp, and is only\r\nadmissible under such conditions.\r\n\r\nA deep trench saves labor, and places the refuse in the most\r\nimmediately safe position, but a buried mass of refuse will take a\r\nlong time to decay; it should not be disturbed, and will taint the\r\nadjacent soil for a long time. This is of less consequence in a merely\r\ntemporary encampment, while it might entail serious evils in\r\nlocalities continuously inhabited. The following plan of trench has\r\nbeen adopted as a more permanent arrangement in Indian villages, with\r\nthe object of checking the frightful evil of surface pollution of the\r\nwhole country, from the people habitually fouling the fields, roads,\r\nstreets, and watercourses. Long trenches are dug, at about one foot or\r\nless in depth, at a spot set apart, about 200 or 300 yards from\r\ndwellings. Matting screens are placed round for decency. Each day the\r\ntrench, which has received the excreta of the preceding day, is filled\r\nup, the excreta being covered with fresh earth obtained by digging a\r\nnew trench adjoining, which, when it has been used, is treated in the\r\nsame manner. Thus the trenches are gradually extended, until\r\nsufficient ground has been utilized, when they are plowed up and the\r\nsite used for cultivation. The Indian plow does not penetrate more\r\nthan eight inches; consequently, if the trench is too deep, the lower\r\nstratum is left unmixed with earth, forming a permanent cesspool, and\r\nbecomes a source of future trouble. It is to be observed, however,\r\nthat in the wet season these trenches cannot be used, and in sandy\r\nsoil they do not answer. This system, although it is preferable to\r\nwhat formerly prevailed--viz., the surface defilement of the ground\r\nall round villages and of the adjacent water courses--is fraught with\r\ndanger unless subsequent cultivation of the site be strictly enforced,\r\nbecause it would otherwise retain large and increasing masses of\r\nputrefying matter in the soil, in a condition somewhat unfavorable to\r\nrapid absorption. These arrangements are applicable only to very rough\r\nlife or very poor communities.\r\n\r\nThe question of the removal of kitchen refuse, manure, etc., from\r\nbarracks next calls for notice. The great principle to be observed in\r\nremoving the solid refuse from barracks is that every decomposable\r\nsubstance should be taken away at once. This principle applies\r\nespecially in warm climates. Even the daily removal of refuse entails\r\nthe necessity of places for the deposit of the refuse, and therefore\r\nthis principle must be applied in various ways to suit local\r\nconvenience. In open situations, exposed to cool winds, there is less\r\ndanger of injury to health from decomposing matters than there would\r\nbe in hot, moist, or close positions. In the country generally there\r\nis less risk of injury than in close parts of towns. These\r\nconsiderations show that the same stringency is not necessarily\r\nrequired everywhere. Position by itself affords a certain degree of\r\nprotection from nuisance. The amount of decomposing matter usually\r\nproduced is also another point to be considered. A small daily product\r\nis not, of course, so injurious as a large product. Even the manner of\r\naccumulating decomposing substances influences their effect on health.\r\nThere is less risk from a dung heap to the leeward than to the\r\nwindward of a barrack. The receptacles in which refuse is temporarily\r\nplaced, such as ash pits and manure pits, should never be below the\r\nlevel of the ground. If a deep pit is dug in the ground, into which\r\nthe refuse is thrown in the intervals between times of removal, rain\r\nand surface water will mix with the refuse and hasten its\r\ndecomposition, and generally the lowest part of the filth will not be\r\nremoved, but will be left to fester and produce malaria. In all places\r\nwhere the occupation is permanent the following conditions should be\r\nattended to:\r\n\r\n1. That the places of deposit be sufficiently removed from inhabited\r\nbuildings to prevent any smell being perceived by the occupants. 2.\r\nThat the places of deposit be above the level of the ground--never dug\r\nout of the ground. The floor of the ash pit or dung pit should be at\r\nleast six inches above the surface level. 3. That the floor be paved\r\nwith square sets, or flagged and drained. 4. That ash pits be covered.\r\n5. That a space should be paved in front, so as to provide that the\r\ntraffic which takes place in depositing the refuse or in removing it\r\nshall not produce a polluted surface.\r\n\r\nIn towns those parts of the refuse which cannot be utilized for manure\r\nor otherwise are burned. But this is an operation which, if done\r\nunskillfully, without a properly constructed kiln, may give rise to\r\nnuisance. One of the best forms of kiln is one now in operation at\r\nEaling, which could be easily visited from London.\r\n\r\n_The removal of excreta from houses._--The chief object of a perfect\r\nsystem of house drainage is the immediate and complete removal from\r\nthe house of all foul and effete matter directly it is produced. The\r\nfirst object--viz., removal of foul matter, can be attained either by\r\nthe water closet system, when carried out in this integrity; but it\r\ncould, of course, be attained without drains if there was labor enough\r\nalways available; and the earth closet or the pail system are\r\nmodifications of immediate removal which are safe. Cesspools in a\r\nhouse do not fulfill this condition of immediate removal. They serve\r\nfor the retention of excremental and other matters. In a porous soil\r\nit endangers the purity of the wells. The Indian cities afford\r\nnumerous examples of subsoil pollution. The Delhi ulcer was traced to\r\nthe pollution of the wells from the contaminated subsoil; and the soil\r\nin many cities and villages is loaded with niter and salt, the\r\nchemical results of animal and vegetable refuse left to decay for many\r\ngenerations, from the presence of which the well water is impure.\r\nThere are many factories of saltpeter in India whose supplies are\r\nderived from this source; and during the great French wars, when\r\nEngland blockaded all the seaports of Europe, the First Napoleon\r\nobtained saltpeter for gunpowder from the cesspits in Paris. Cesspools\r\nare inadmissible where complete removal can be effected. Cesspits may,\r\nhowever, be a necessity in some special cases, as, for instance, in\r\ndetached houses or a small detached barrack. Where they cannot be\r\navoided, the following conditions as to their use should be enforced:\r\n\r\n1st. A cesspit should never be located under a dwelling. It should be\r\nplaced outside, and as far removed from the immediate neighborhood of\r\nthe dwelling as circumstances will allow. There should be a ventilated\r\ntrap placed on the pipe leading from the watercloset to the cesspit.\r\n2d. It should be formed of impervious material so as to permit of no\r\nleakage. 3d. It should be ventilated. 4th. No overflow should be\r\npermitted from it. 5th. When full it should be thoroughly emptied and\r\ncleaned out; for the matter left at the bottom of a cesspit is liable\r\nto be in a highly putrescible condition.\r\n\r\nWhere a cesspit is unavoidable, perhaps the best and least offensive\r\nsystem for emptying it is the pneumatic system. This is applicable to\r\nthe water closet refuse alone. The pneumatic system acts as follows: A\r\nlarge air-tight cylinder on wheels, or, what answers equally, a series\r\nof air-tight barrels connected together by tubes about 3 in. diameter,\r\nplaced on a cart, brought as near to the cesspit as is convenient; a\r\ntube of about the same diameter is led from them to the cesspit; the\r\nair is then exhausted in the barrels or cylinder either by means of an\r\nair pump or by means of steam injected into it, which, on\r\ncondensation, forms a vacuum; and the contents of the cesspit are\r\ndrawn through the tube by the atmospheric pressure into the cylinder\r\nor barrels. A plan which is practically an extension of this system\r\nhas been introduced by Captain Liernur in Holland. He removes the\r\nfæcal matter from water closets and the sedimentary production of\r\nkitchen sinks by pneumatic agency. He places large air-tight tanks in\r\na suitable part of the town, to which he leads pipes from all houses.\r\nHe creates a vacuum in the tanks, and thus sucks into one center the\r\nfæcal matter from all the houses. Various substitutes have been tried\r\nfor the cesspit, which retain the principle of the hand removal of\r\nexcreta. The first was the combination of the privy with an ashpit\r\nabove the surface of the ground, the ashes and excreta being mixed\r\ntogether, and both being removed periodically. The next improvement\r\nwas the provision of a movable receptacle. Of this type the simplest\r\narrangement is a box placed under the seat, which is taken out, the\r\ncontents emptied into the scavenger's cart, and the box replaced. The\r\ndifficulty of cleansing the angles of the boxes led to the adoption of\r\noval or round pails. The pail is placed under the seat, and removed at\r\nstated intervals, or when full, and replaced by a clean pail. In\r\nMarseilles and Nice a somewhat similar system is in use. They employ\r\ncylindrical metal vessels furnished with a lid which closes\r\nhermetically, each capable of holding 11 gallons. The household is\r\nfurnished with three or four of these vessels, and when one is full\r\nthe lid is closed hermetically, the vessel thus remaining in a\r\nharmless condition in the house till taken away by the authorities and\r\nreplaced by a clean one. The contents are converted into manure. In\r\nconsequence of the offensiveness of the open pail, the next\r\nimprovement was to throw in some form of deodorizing material daily.\r\nIn the north of England the arrangement generally is that the ashes\r\nshall be passed through a shoot, on which they are sifted--the finer\r\nfall into the pail to deodorize it, the coarser pass into a box,\r\nwhence they can be taken to be again burned--while a separate shoot is\r\nprovided for kitchen refuse, which falls into another pail adjacent.\r\n\r\nProbably the best known contrivance for deodorizing the excreta is the\r\ndry earth system as applied in the earth closet, in which advantage is\r\ntaken of the deodorizing properties of earth. Dry earth is a good\r\ndeodorizer; 1½ lb. of dry earth of good garden ground or clay will\r\ndeodorize such excretion. A larger quantity is required of sand or\r\ngravel. If the earth after use is dried, it can be applied again, and\r\nit is stated that the deodorizing powers of earth are not destroyed\r\nuntil it has been used ten or twelve times. This system requires close\r\nattention, or the dry earth closet will get out of order; as compared\r\nwith water closets, it is cheaper in first construction, and is not\r\nliable to injury by frost; and it has this advantage over any form of\r\ncesspit--that it necessitates the daily removal of refuse. The cost of\r\nthe dry earth system per 1,000 persons may be assumed as follows: Cost\r\nof closet, say, £500; expense of ovens, carts, horses, etc., £250;\r\ntotal capital, £750, at 6 per cent. £37 10_s._ interest. Wages of two\r\nmen and a boy per week, £1 12_s._; keep of horses, stables, etc., 18_s._;\r\nfuel for drying earth, 1_s._ 6_d._ per ton dried daily, £1 10_s._; cost of\r\nearth and repairs, etc., 14_s._; weekly expenses, £4 14_s._ Yearly\r\nexpenses, £247 (equal to 4_s._ 11_d._ per ton per annum); interest, £37\r\n10_s._--total, £284 10_s._, against which should be put the value of the\r\nmanure. But the value of the manure is simply a question of carriage.\r\nIf the manure is highly concentrated, like guano, it can stand a high\r\ncarriage. If the manuring elements are diffused through a large bulk\r\nof passive substances, the cost of the carriage of the extra, or\r\nnon-manuring, elements absorbs all profit. If a town, therefore, by\r\nadding deodorants to the contents of pails produces a large quantity\r\nof manure, containing much besides the actual manuring elements--such\r\nas is generally the case with dry earth--as soon as the districts\r\nimmediately around have been fully supplied, a point is soon reached\r\nat which it is impossible to continue to find purchasers. The dry\r\nearth system is applicable to separate houses, or to institutions\r\nwhere much attention can be given to it, but it is inapplicable to\r\nlarge towns from the practical difficulties connected with procuring,\r\ncarting, and storing the dry earth.\r\n\r\nWith the idea that if the solid part of the excreta could be separated\r\nfrom the liquid and kept comparatively dry the offensiveness would be\r\nmuch diminished, and deodorization be unnecessary, a method for\r\ngetting rid of the liquid portion by what is termed the Goux system\r\nhas been in use at Halifax. This system consists in lining the pail\r\nwith a composition formed from the ashes and all the dry refuse which\r\ncan be conveniently collected, together with some clay to give it\r\nadhesion. The lining is adjusted and kept in position by a means of a\r\ncore or mould, which is allowed to remain in the pails until just\r\nbefore they are about to be placed under the seat; the core is then\r\nwithdrawn, and the pail is left ready for use. The liquid which passes\r\ninto the pail soaks into this lining, which thus forms the deodorizing\r\nmedium. The proportion of absorbents in a lining 3 in. thick to the\r\ncentral space in a tub of the above dimensions would be about two to\r\none; but unless the absorbents are dry, this proportion would be\r\ninsufficient to produce a dry mass in the tubs when used for a week,\r\nand experience has shown that after being in use for several days the\r\nabsorbing power of the lining is already exceeded, and the whole\r\ncontents have remained liquid. There would appear to be little gain by\r\nthe use of the Goux lining as regards freedom from nuisance, and\r\nthough it removes the risk of splashing and does away with much of the\r\nunsightliness of the contents, the absorbent, inasmuch as it adds\r\nextra weight which has to be carried to and from the houses, is rather\r\na disadvantage than otherwise from the manurial point of view.\r\n\r\nThe simple pail system, which is in use in various ways in the\r\nnorthern towns of England, and in the permanent camps to some extent\r\nat least, and of which the French \"tinette\" is an improved form, is\r\nmore economically convenient than the dry earth system or the Goux or\r\nother deodorizing system, where a large amount of removal of refuse\r\nhas to be accomplished, because by the pail system the liquid and\r\nsolid ejections may be collected with a very small, or even without\r\nany, admixture of foreign substances; and, according to theory, the\r\nmanurial value of dejections per head per annum ought to be from 8_s._\r\nto 10_s._ The great superiority, in a sanitary point of view, of all the\r\npail or pan systems over the best forms over the old cesspits or even\r\nthe middens is due to the fact that the interval of collection is\r\nreduced to a minimum, the changing or emptying of the receptacles\r\nbeing sometimes effected daily, and the period never exceeding a week.\r\nThe excrementitious matter is removed without soaking in the ground or\r\nputrefying in the midst of a population.\r\n\r\nThese plans for the removal of excreta do not deal with the equally\r\nimportant refuse liquid--viz., the waste water from washing and\r\nstables, etc. As it is necessary to have drains for the purpose of\r\nremoving the waste water, it is more economical to allow this waste\r\nwater to carry away the excreta. In any case, you must have drains for\r\nremoving the fouled water. Down these drains it is evident that much\r\nof the liquid excreta will be poured, and thus you must take\r\nprecautions to prevent the gases of decomposition which the drains are\r\nliable to contain from passing into your houses.\r\n\r\nThere is a method which you might find useful on a small scale to\r\nwhich I will now draw your attention, as it is applicable to detached\r\nhouses or small barracks--viz., the plan of applying the domestic\r\nwater to land through underground drains, or what is called subsoil\r\nirrigation. This system affords peculiar facilities for disposing of\r\nsewage matter without nuisance. There are many cases where open\r\nirrigation in close contiguity to mansions or dwellings might be\r\nexceedingly objectionable, and in such cases subsoil irrigation\r\nsupplies a means of dealing with a very difficult question. This\r\nsystem was applied some years ago by Mr. Waring in Newport, in the\r\nUnited States. It has recently been introduced into this country.\r\n\r\nThe system is briefly as follows: The water from the house is carried\r\nthrough a water-tight drain to the ground where the irrigation is to\r\nbe applied. It is there passed through ordinary drain pipes, placed 1\r\nft. below the surface, with open joints, by means of which it\r\npercolates into the soil. Land drains, 4 ft. deep, should be laid\r\nintermediately between the subsoil drains to remove the water from the\r\nsoil. The difficulty of subsoil irrigation is to prevent deposit,\r\nwhich chokes the drains; and if the foul domestic water is allowed to\r\ntrickle through the drains as it passes away from the house it soon\r\nchokes the drains. It is, therefore, necessary to pass it in flushes\r\nthrough the drains, and this can be best managed by running the water\r\nfrom the house into one of Field's automatic flush tanks, which runs\r\noff in a body when full.\r\n\r\nWhen you have water closet and drainage, the great object to be\r\nattained in house drainage is to prevent the sewer gas from passing\r\nfrom the main sewer into the house drain. It was the custom to place a\r\nflap at the junction of the house drain with the sewer; but this flap\r\nis useless for preventing sewer gas from passing up the house drain.\r\nThe plan was therefore adopted of placing a water trap under the water\r\ncloset basin or the sink, etc., in direct communication with the\r\ndrain. The capacity of water to absorb sewer gas is very great,\r\nconsequently the water in the trap would absorb this gas. When the\r\nwater became warm from increase of temperature, it would give out the\r\ngas into the house; when it cooled down at night, it would again\r\nabsorb more gas from the soil pipe, and frequent change of temperature\r\nwould cause it to give out and reabsorb the gas continually.\r\n\r\nThese objections have led to the present recognized system--viz., 1st,\r\nto place a water trap on the drain to cut off the sewer gases from the\r\nfoot of the soil pipe; and, next, to place an opening to the outer air\r\non the soil pipe between the trap and the house to secure efficient\r\ndisconnection between the sewer and the house. It is, moreover,\r\nnecessary to produce a movement of air and ventilation in the house\r\ndrain pipes to aerate the pipe and to oxidize any putrescible products\r\nwhich may be in it. To do this, we must insure that a current of air\r\nshall be continually passing through the drains; both an inlet and an\r\noutlet for fresh air must be provided in the portions of the house\r\ndrain which are cut off from the main sewer, for without an inlet and\r\noutlet there can be no efficient ventilation. This outlet and inlet\r\ncan be obtained in the following manner: In the first place, an outlet\r\nmay be formed by prolonging the soil pipe at its full diameter, and\r\nwith an open top to above the roof, in a position away from the\r\nwindows, skylights, or chimneys. And, secondly, an inlet may be\r\nobtained by an opening into the house drain, on the dwelling side of\r\nand close to the trap, by means of the disconnecting manhole or\r\nbranch-pipe before mentioned, or where necessary by carrying up the\r\ninlet by means of a ventilating pipe to above the roof. The inlet\r\nshould be equal in area to the drain pipe, and not in any case less\r\nthan 4 in. in diameter. If it were not for appearance and the\r\ndifficulty of conveying the excreta without lodgments, an open gutter\r\nwould be preferable to a closed pipe in the house. This arrangement is\r\nbased on the principle that there should be no deposit in the house\r\ndrains. Therefore the utmost care should be taken to lay the house\r\ndrains in straight lines, both in plan and gradient, and to give the\r\nadequate inclination.\r\n\r\nThe following are desirable conditions to observe in house drains: 1.\r\nAs to material of pipes. House drains should be made either of glazed\r\nstoneware pipes or fireclay pipes with cement joints, or preferably of\r\ncast iron pipes jointed with carefully-made lead joints, or with\r\nturned joints and bored sockets. I say preferably of cast iron. In New\r\nYork the iron soilpipe, with joints made with lead, is now required by\r\nthe municipal regulations. It is a stronger pipe than a rainwater\r\npipe. The latter will often be found to have holes. A lead joint\r\ncannot be made properly in a weak pipe, therefore the lead joint is to\r\nsome extent a guarantee of soundness. Lead pipes will be eaten away by\r\nwater containing free oxygen without carbonic acid, therefore pure\r\nrainwater injures lead pipes. An excess of carbonic acid in water will\r\nalso eat away lead. You will find that in many cases pinholes appear\r\nin a soilpipe, and when inside a house that allows sewer gas to pass\r\ninto the house. Moreover, lead is a soft material; it is subject to\r\nindentations, to injury from nails, to sagging. A cast-iron pipe, when\r\ncoated with sewage matter, does not appear to be subject to decay; and\r\nif of sufficient substance it is not liable to injury. When once well\r\nfixed, it has no tendency to move. I would, therefore, advocate cast\r\niron in lieu of lead soilpipes. In fixing the soilpipe which is to\r\nreceive a water-closet, the trap should form part of the fixed pipe;\r\nso that if there is any sinking the down pipe will not sink away from\r\nthe trap. It is, however, not sufficient to provide good material.\r\nThere is nothing which is more important in a sanitary point of view\r\nthan good workmanship in house drainage. In this matter, it is on\r\ndetails that all depends. Just consider; the drain pipes under the\r\nbest conditions of aeration contain elements of danger, and those\r\npipes are composed of a number of parts, at the point of junction of\r\nany one of which the poison may escape into the house. You thus\r\nperceive how necessary it is first to reduce the poison to a minimum\r\nby cutting off the sewer gas which might otherwise pass from the\r\nstreet sewer to the house drain, and in the next place being most\r\ncareful in the workmanship of every part of your house drains and\r\nsoilpipes. Reduce your danger where you can by putting your pipes\r\noutside. But you cannot always do that--for instance, at New York and\r\nin Canada they would freeze.\r\n\r\nAll drain pipes should be proved to be watertight by plugging up the\r\nlower end of the drain pipe and filling it with water. In no case\r\nshould a soilpipe be built inside a wall. It should be so placed as to\r\nbe always accessible. 2. The pipes should be generally 4 in. diameter.\r\nIn no instance need a drain pipe inside a house exceed 6 in. in\r\ndiameter. 3. Every drain of a house or building should be laid with\r\ntrue gradients, in no case less than 1/100, but much steeper would be\r\npreferable. When from circumstances the drain is laid at a smaller\r\ninclination, a flush tank should be provided. They should be laid in\r\nstraight lines from point to point. At every change of direction there\r\nshould be reserved a means of access to the drain. 4. No drain should\r\nbe constructed so as to pass under a dwelling house, except in\r\nparticular cases when absolutely necessary. In such cases the pipe\r\nshould be of cast iron, and the length of drain laid under the house\r\nshould be laid perfectly straight--a means of access should be\r\nprovided at each end; it should have a free air current passing\r\nthrough it from end to end, and a flush tank should be placed at the\r\nupper end. 5. Every house drain should be arranged so as to be\r\nflushed, and kept at all times free from deposit. 6. Every house drain\r\nshould be ventilated by at least two suitable openings, one at each\r\nend, so as to afford a current of air through the drain, and no pipe\r\nor opening should be used for ventilation unless the same be carried\r\nupward without angles or horizontal lengths, and with tight joints.\r\nThe size of such pipes or openings should be fully equal to that of\r\nthe drain pipe ventilated. 7. The upper extremities of ventilating\r\npipes should be at a distance from any windows or openings, so that\r\nthere will be no danger of the escape of the foul air into the\r\ninterior of the house from such pipes. The soilpipe should terminate\r\nat its lower end in a properly ventilating disconnecting trap, so that\r\na current of air would be constantly maintained through the pipe. 8.\r\nNo rainwater pipe and no overflow or waste pipe from any cistern or\r\nrainwater tank, or from any sink (other than a slop sink for urine),\r\nor from any bath or lavatory, should pass directly to the soilpipe;\r\nbut every such pipe should be disconnected therefrom by passing\r\nthrough the wall to the outside of the house, and discharging with an\r\nend open to the air. I may mention here that the drainage arrangements\r\nof this Parkes Museum in which we are assembled were very defective\r\nwhen the building was first taken. Mr. Rogers Field, one of the\r\ncommittee, was requested to drain it properly, and it has been very\r\nsuccessfully accomplished.\r\n\r\nI would now draw your attention to some points of detail in the\r\nfittings for carrying away waste water.\r\n\r\nFirst, with regard to lavatories. As already mentioned, every waste\r\npipe from the sink should deliver in the open air, but it should have\r\nan opening at its upper end as well as at its lower end, to permit a\r\ncurrent of air to pass through it; and it should be trapped close to\r\nthe sink, so as to prevent the air being drawn through it into the\r\nhouse; otherwise you will have an offensive smell from it. I will give\r\nyou an instance: At the University College Hospital there are some\r\nfire tanks on the several landings. The water flows in every day, and\r\nsome flows away through the waste pipes; these pipes, which carry away\r\nnothing but fresh London water to empty in the yard, got most\r\noffensive simply from the decomposition of the sediment left in them\r\nby the London water passing through them day after day. A small waste\r\npipe from a bath or a basin is a great inconvenience. It should be of\r\na size to empty rapidly--for a bath 2 inches, a basin 1½, inches.\r\nThere are other points connected with fittings to which I would call\r\nyour attention. The great inventive powers which have been applied to\r\nthe w.c. pan are an evidence of how unsatisfactory they all are. Many\r\nkinds of water-closet apparatus and of so-called \"traps\" have a\r\ntendency to retain foul matter in the house, and therefore, in\r\nreality, partake more or less of the nature of small cesspools, and\r\nnuisances are frequently attributed to the ingress of \"sewer gas\"\r\nwhich have nothing whatever to do with the sewers, but arise from foul\r\nair generated in the house drains and internal fittings. The old form\r\nwas always made with what is called a D-trap. Avoid the D-trap. It is\r\nsimply a small cesspool which cannot be cleaned out. Any trap in which\r\nrefuse remains is an objectionable cesspool. It is a receptacle for\r\nputrescrible matter. In a lead pipe your trap should always be smooth\r\nand without corners. The depth of dip of a trap should depend on the\r\nfrequency of use of the trap. It varies from ½ inch to 3½ inches. When\r\na trap is rarely used, the dip should be deeper than when frequently\r\nused, to allow of evaporation. In the section of a w.c. pan, the\r\nobject to be attained is to take that form in which all the parts of\r\nthe trap can be easily examined and cleaned, in which both the pan and\r\nthe trap will be washed clean by the water at each discharge, and in\r\nwhich the lever movement of the handle will not allow of the passage\r\nof sewer gas.\r\n\r\nAnd now just a few personal remarks in conclusion. I have had much\r\npleasure in giving to my old brother officers in these lectures the\r\nresult of my experience in sanitary science. In doing so, I desired\r\nespecially to impress on you who are just entering your profession the\r\nimportance of giving effect to those principles of sanitary science\r\nwhich were left very much in abeyance until after the Crimean war. I\r\nhave not desired to fetter you with dogmatic rules, but I have sought,\r\nby general illustrations, to show you the principles on which sanitary\r\nscience rests. That science is embodied in the words, pure earth, pure\r\nair, pure water. In nature that purity is insured by increasing\r\nmovement. Neither ought we to stagnate. In the application of these\r\nprinciples your goal of to-day should be your starting-post for\r\nto-morrow. If I have fulfilled my object, I shall have interested you\r\nsufficiently to induce some of you at least to seize and carry forward\r\nto a more advanced position the torch of sanitary science.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTEUR'S NEW METHOD OF ATTENUATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe view that vaccinia is attenuated variola is well known, and has\r\nbeen extensively adopted by English physicians. If the opinion means\r\nanything, it signifies that the two diseases are in essence one and\r\nthe same, differing only in degree. M. Pasteur has recently found that\r\nby passing the bacillus of \"rouget\" of pigs through rabbits, he can\r\neffect a considerable attenuation of the \"rouget\" virus. He has shown\r\nthat rabbits inoculated with the bacillus of rouget become very ill\r\nand die, but if the inoculations be carried through a series of\r\nrabbits, a notable modification results in the bacillus. As regards\r\nthe rabbits themselves, no favorable change occurs--they are all made\r\nvery ill, or die. But if inoculation be made on pigs from those\r\nrabbits, at the end of the series it is found that the pigs have the\r\ndisease in a mild form, and, moreover, that they enjoy immunity from\r\nfurther attacks of \"rouget.\" This simply means that the rabbits have\r\neffected, or the bacillus has undergone while in them, an attenuation\r\nof virulence. So the pigs may be \"vaccinated\" with the modified virus,\r\nhave the disease in a mild form, and thereafter be protected from the\r\ndisease. The analogy between this process and the accepted view of\r\nvaccinia is very close. The variolous virus is believed to pass\r\nthrough the cow, and there to become attenuated, so that inoculations\r\nfrom the cow-pox no longer produce variola in the human subject, but\r\ncow-pox (vaccinia). As an allied process, though of very different\r\nresult, mention may be made of some collateral experiments of Pasteur,\r\nalso performed recently. Briefly, it has been discovered that the\r\nbacillus of the \"rouget\" of pigs undergoes an increase of virulence by\r\nbeing cultivated through a series of pigeons. Inoculations from the\r\nlast of the series of pigeons give rise to a most intense form of the\r\ndisease. It will be remembered that the discovery of the bacillus of\r\n\"rouget\" of pigs was due to the late Dr. Thuillier.--_Lancet._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nVery few persons realize the necessity of cultivating an equable\r\ntemper and of avoiding passion. Many persons have met with sudden\r\ndeath, the result of a weak heart and passionate nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONVENIENT VAULTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a subject which will bear line upon line and precept upon\r\nprecept. Many persons have availed themselves of the cheap and easy\r\nmeans which we have formerly recommended in the shape of the daily use\r\nof absorbents, but a larger number strangely neglect these means, and\r\nfoul air and impure drainage are followed by disease and death. Sifted\r\ncoal ashes and road dust are the remedy, kept in barrels till needed\r\nfor use. A neat cask, filled with these absorbents, with a\r\nlong-handled dipper, is placed in the closet, and a conspicuous\r\nplacard directs every occupant to throw down a dipper full before\r\nleaving. The vaults, made to open on the outside, are then as easily\r\ncleaned twice a year as sand is shoveled from a pit. No drainage by\r\nsecret, underground seams in the soil can then poison the water of\r\nwells; and no effluvia can arise to taint the air and create fevers.\r\nOn this account, this arrangement is safer and better than\r\nwater-closets. It is far cheaper and simpler, and need never get out\r\nof order. There being no odor whatever, if properly attended to, it\r\nmay be contiguous to the dwelling. An illustration of the way in which\r\nthe latter is accomplished is shown by Fig. 1, which represents a neat\r\naddition to a kitchen wing, with hip-roof, the entrance being either\r\nfrom the kichen through an entry, or from the outside as shown by the\r\nsteps. Fig. 2 is a plan, showing the double walls with interposed\r\nsolid earth, to exclude any possible impurity from the cellar in case\r\nof neglect. The vaults may be reached from the outside opening, for\r\nremoving the contents. In the whole arrangement there is not a vestige\r\nof impure air, and it is as neat as a parlor; and the man who cleans\r\nout the vaults say it is no more unpleasant than to shovel sand from a\r\npit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nThose who prefer may place the closet at a short distance from the\r\nhouse, provided the walk is flanked on both sides with evergreen\r\ntrees; for no person should be compelled to encounter drifting snows\r\nto reach it--an exposure often resulting in colds and sickness. A few\r\ndollars are the whole cost, and civilization and humanity demand as\r\nmuch.--_Country Gentleman_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONOUS SERPENTS AND THEIR VENOM.\r\n\r\nBy Dr. G. ARCHIE STOCKWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemistry has made astounding strides since the days of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, when Italian malice and intrigue swayed all Europe, and\r\npoisons and poisoners stalked forth unblushingly from cottage and\r\npalace; when crowned and mitered heads, prelates, noblemen, beneficed\r\nclergymen, courtiers, and burghers became Borgias and De Medicis in\r\nhideous infamy in their greed for power and affluence; and when the\r\ncivilized world feared to retire to rest, partake of the daily repast,\r\ninhale the odors of flower or perfume, light a wax taper, or even\r\napproach the waters of the holy font. These horrors have been laid\r\nbare, their cause and effect explained, and tests discovered whereby\r\nthey may be detected, providing the law with a shield that protects\r\neven the humblest individual. Great as the science is, however, it is\r\nyet far removed from perfection; and there are substances so\r\nmysterious, subtle, and dangerous as to set the most delicate tests\r\nand powerful lenses at naught, while carrying death most horrible in\r\ntheir train; and chief of these are the products of Nature's\r\nlaboratory, that provides some sixty species of serpents with their\r\ndeadly venom, enabling them in spite of sluggish forms and retiring\r\nhabits to secure abundant prey and resent mischievous molestation. The\r\nhideous _trigonocephalus_ has forced the introduction and acclimation\r\nof the mongoose to the cane fields of the Western tropics; the tiger\r\nsnake (_Heplocephalus curtus_) is the terror of Australian plains; the\r\nfer de lance (_Craspedocephalus lanceolatus_) renders the paradise of\r\nMartinique almost uninhabitable; the tic paloonga (_Daboii russelli_)\r\nis the scourge of Cinghalese coffee estates; the giant ehlouhlo of\r\nNatal (unclassified) by its presence secures a forbidding waste for\r\nmiles about; the far famed cobra de capello (_Naja tripudians_)\r\nravages British India in a death ratio of one-seventh of one per cent.\r\nof the dense population, annually, and is the more dangerous in that\r\nan assumed sacred character secures it largely from molestation and\r\nretributive justice; and in Europe and America we have vipers,\r\nrattlesnakes, copperheads, and moccasins (_viperinæ_ and _crotalidæ_),\r\nthat if a less degree fatal, are still a source of dread and\r\nannoyance. All these forms exhibit in general like ways and like\r\nhabits, and if the venom of all be not generically identical, the\r\nphysiological and toxicological phenomena arising therefrom render\r\nthem practically and specifically so. Indeed, their attributes appear\r\nto be mere modifications arising from difference in age, size,\r\ndevelopment, climate, latitude, seasons, and enforced habits, aided\r\nperhaps by idiosyncrasies and the incidents and accidents of life.\r\n\r\nIn delicacy of organism and perfection in mechanism and precision, the\r\ninoculatory apparatus of the venomous reptile excels the most\r\nexquisite appliances devised by the surgical implement maker's art,\r\nand it is doubtful whether it can ever be rivaled by the hand of man.\r\nThe mouth of the serpent is an object for the closest study,\r\npresenting as it does a series of independent actions, whereby the\r\nbones composing the upper jaw and palate are loosely articulated, or\r\nrather attached, to one another by elastic and expansive ligaments,\r\nwhereby the aperture is made conformatory, or enlarged at will--any\r\none part being untrammeled and unimpeded in its action by its fellows.\r\nThe recurved, hook-like teeth are thus isolated in application, and\r\neach venom fang independent of its rival when so desired, and it\r\nbecomes possible to reach points and recesses seemingly inaccessible.\r\n\r\nThe fangs proper, those formidable weapons whose threatening presence\r\nquails the boldest opponent, inspires the fear of man, and puts to\r\nflight the entire animal kingdom--lions, tigers, and leopards, all but\r\nthe restless and plucky mongoose--and whose slightest scratch is\r\nattended with such dire results, are two in number, one in each upper\r\njaw, and placed anteriorly to all other teeth, which they exceed by\r\nfive or six times in point of size. Situated just within the lips,\r\nrecurved, slender, and exceeding in keenness even the finest of\r\ncambric needles, they are penetrated in their longitudinal diameter by\r\na delicate, hair-like canal opening into a groove at the apex,\r\nterminating on the anterior surface in an elongated fissure. As the\r\ncanal is straight, and the tooth falciform, a like groove or\r\nlongitudinal fissure is formed at the base, where it is inclosed by\r\nthe aperture of the duct that communicates with the poison apparatus.\r\n\r\nAt the base of each fang, and extending from a point just beneath the\r\nnostril, backward two-thirds the distance to the commissure of the\r\nmouth, is the poison gland, analogous to the salivary glands of man,\r\nthat secretes a pure, mucous saliva, and also a pale straw-colored,\r\nhalf-oleaginous fluid, the venom proper. Within the gland, venom and\r\nsaliva are mingled in varying proportions coincidently with\r\ncircumstances; but the former slowly distills away and finds lodgment\r\nin the central portion of the excretory duct, that along its middle is\r\ndilated to form a bulb-like receptacle, and where only it may be\r\nobtained in perfect purity.\r\n\r\nWhen the reptile is passive, the fangs are arranged to lie backward\r\nalong the jaw, concealed by the membrane of the mouth, and thus offer\r\nno impediment to deglutition. Close inspection, however, at once\r\nreveals not only their presence, but also several rudimentary ones to\r\nsupply their place in case of injury or accident. The bulb of the\r\nduct, too, is surrounded by a double aponeurotic capsule, of which the\r\noutermost and strongest layer is in connection with a muscle by whose\r\naction both duct and gland are compressed at will, conveying the\r\nsecretion into the basal aperture of the fang, at the same time\r\nrefilling the bulb.\r\n\r\nWhen enraged and assuming the offensive and defensive, the reptile\r\ndraws the posterior portion of its body into a coil or spiral, whereby\r\nthe act of straightening, in which it hurls itself forward to nearly\r\nits full length, lends force to the blow, and at the same instant the\r\nfangs are erected, drawn forward in a reverse plane, permitting the\r\npoints to look outward beyond the lips. The action of the compressor\r\nmuscles is contemporaneous with the blow inflicted, the venom being\r\ninjected with considerable violence through the apical outlets of the\r\nfangs, and into the bottom of the wound. If the object is not\r\nattained, the venom may be thrown to considerable distances, falling\r\nin drops; and Sir Arthur Cunynghame in a recent work on South Africa\r\nrelates that he was cautioned not to approach a huge cobra of six feet\r\nor more in length in its death agony, lest it should hurl venom in his\r\neyes and create blindness; he afterward found that an officer of Her\r\nMajesty's XV. Regiment had been thus injured at a distance of\r\n_forty-five feet_, and did not recover his eyesight for more than a\r\nweek.[1]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: Presumably the Natal ombozi, or spitting cobra, _Naja\r\n  hæmachites_, who is fully equal to the feat described.]\r\n\r\nWith the infliction of the stroke and expression of its venom, the\r\ncreature usually attempts to reverse its fangs in the wound, thereby\r\ndragging through and lacerating the flesh; an ingenious bit of\r\ndevilishness hardly to be expected from so low a form of organism; but\r\nits frequent neglect proves it by no means mechanical, and it\r\nfrequently occurs that the animal bitten drags the reptile after it a\r\nshort distance, or causes it to leave its fangs in the wound. Some\r\nserpents also, as the fer de lance, black mamba, and water moccasin,\r\nare apparently actuated by most vindictive motives, and coil\r\nthemselves about the part bitten, clinging with leech-like tenacity\r\nand resisting all attempts at removal. Two gentlemen of San Antonio,\r\nTexas,[2] who were bitten by rattlesnakes, subsequently asserted that\r\nafter having inflicted all possible injury, the reptiles scampered\r\naway with unmistakable manifestations of pleasure. \"Snakes,\" remarked\r\none of the victims, \"usually glide smoothly away with the entire body\r\nprone to the ground; but the fellow I encountered traveled off with an\r\nup and down wave-like motion, as if thrilled with delight, and then,\r\ngetting under a large rock where he was safe from pursuit, he turned,\r\nand raising his head aloft waved it to and fro, as if saying. 'Don't\r\nyou feel good now?' It would require but a brief stretch of the\r\nimagination to constitute that serpent a veritable descendant of the\r\nold Devil himself.\"\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: On the authority of N.A. Taylor and H.F. McDaniels.]\r\n\r\nAs the first blow commonly exhausts the receptacle of the duct, a\r\nsecond (the venom being more or less mingled and diluted by the\r\nsalivary secretion) is comparatively less fatal in results; and each\r\nsuccessive repetition correspondingly inoffensive until finally\r\nnothing but pure mucus is ejected. Nevertheless, when thoroughly\r\naroused, the reptile is enabled to constantly hurl a secretion, since\r\nboth rage and hunger swell the glands to enormous size, and stimulate\r\nto extraordinary activity--a fortuitous circumstance to which many an\r\nunfortunate is doubtless indebted for his life. The removal of a fang,\r\nhowever, affects its gland to a degree that it becomes almost\r\ninoperative, until such a time as a new tooth is grown, and again\r\ncalls it into action, which is commonly but a few weeks at most; and a\r\nperson purchasing a poisonous serpent under the supposition that it\r\nhas been rendered innocuous, will do well to keep watch of its mouth\r\nlest he be some time taken unaware. It may be rendered permanently\r\nharmless, however, by first removing the fang, and then cauterizing\r\nthe duct by means of a needle or wire, heated to redness; when for\r\nexperimental purposes the gland may be stimulated, and the virus drawn\r\noff by means of a fine-pointed syringe.\r\n\r\nIn what the venom consists more than has already been described, we\r\nare not permitted to know. It dries under exposure to air in small\r\nscales, is soluble in water but not in alcohol, slightly reddens\r\nlitmus paper, and long retains its noxious properties. It has no acrid\r\nor burning taste, and but little if any odor; the tongue pronounces it\r\ninoffensive, and the mucous surface of the alimentary track is proof\r\nagainst it, and it has been swallowed in considerable quantities\r\nwithout deleterious result--all the poison that could be extracted\r\nfrom a half dozen of the largest and most virile reptiles was\r\npowerless in any way to affect an unfledged bird when poured into its\r\nopen beak. Chemistry is not only powerless to solve the enigma of its\r\naction, and the microscope to detect its presence, but pathology is at\r\nfault to explain the reason of its deadly effect; and all that we know\r\nis that when introduced even in most minute quantities into an open\r\nwound, the blood is dissolved, so to speak, and the stream of life\r\nparalyzed with an almost incredible rapidity. Without test or\r\nantidote, terror has led to blind, fanatical empiricism, necessarily\r\nattended with no little injury in the search for specifics, and it may\r\nbe reasonably asserted that no substance can be named so inert and\r\nworthless as not to have been recommended, or so disgusting as not to\r\nhave been employed; nor is any practice too absurd to find favor and\r\nadherents even among the most enlightened of the medical profession,\r\nwho have rung all the changes of the therapeutical gamut from\r\nserpentaria[3] and boneset to guaco, cimicifugia, and _Aristolochia\r\nIndia_ to curare, alum, chalk, and mercury to arsenic; and in the way\r\nof surgical dressings and appliances everything from poultices of\r\nhuman fæces,[4] burying the part bitten in fresh earth,[5] or\r\nthrusting the member or entire person into the entrails of living\r\nanimals, to cupping, ligatures, escharotics, and the moxa.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 3: Serpentaria derives its name from its supposed\r\n  antidotal properties, and guaco and _Aristolochia India_ enjoyed\r\n  widely heralded but rapidly fleeting popularity in the two Indias\r\n  for a season. Tanjore pill (black pepper and arsenic) is still\r\n  extensively lauded in districts whose serpents possess little\r\n  vitality, but is every way inferior to iodine.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 4: A Chinese remedy--as might be imagined.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 5: Still extensively practiced, the first in Michigan,\r\n  the latter in Missouri and Arkansas, and inasmuch as one is\r\n  cooling and soothing, and the other slightly provocative of\r\n  perspiration in the part, are not altogether devoid of\r\n  plausibility.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the wounds of venomous serpents are frequently attended with\r\nfatal results, such are not necessarily invariable. There are times\r\nand seasons when all reptiles are sluggish and inactive, and when they\r\ninflict comparatively trifling injuries; and the poison is much less\r\nvirulent at certain periods than others--during chilling weather for\r\ninstance, or when exhausted by repeated bites in securing sustenance.\r\nYoung and small serpents, too, are less virile than large and more\r\naged specimens, and it has likewise been observed that death is more\r\napt to follow when the poison is received at the beginning or during\r\nthe continuance of the heated term.\r\n\r\nThe action of the venom is commonly so swift that its effects are\r\nmanifested almost immediately after inoculation, being at once\r\nconveyed by the circulatory system to the great nervous centers of the\r\nbody, resulting in rapid paralysis of such organs as are supplied with\r\nmotive power from these sources; its physiological and toxicological\r\nrealizations being more or less speedy accordingly as it is applied\r\nnear or remote from these centers, or infused into the capillary or\r\nthe venous circulation. Usually, too, an unfortunate experiences,\r\nperhaps instantaneously, an intense burning pain in the member\r\nlacerated, which is succeeded by vertigo, nausea, retching, fainting,\r\ncoldness, and collapse; the part bitten swells, becomes discolored, or\r\nspotted over its surface with livid blotches, that may, ultimately,\r\nextend to the greater portion of the body, while the poison appears to\r\neffect a greater or less disorganization of the blood, not by\r\ncoagulating its fibrine as Fontana surmised, but in dissolving,\r\nattenuating, and altering the form of its corpuscles, whose integrity\r\nis so essential to life, causing them to adhere to one another, and to\r\nthe walls of the vessels by which they are conveyed; being no longer\r\nable to traverse the capillaries, oedema is produced, followed by the\r\npeculiar livid blush. Shakespeare would appear to have had intuitive\r\nperception of the nature of such subtle poison, when he caused the\r\nghost to describe to Hamlet\r\n\r\n  \"The leprous distillment whose effect\r\n   Bears such an enmity to the blood of man\r\n   That swift as quicksilver, it courses through\r\n   The natural gates and alleys of the body\r\n   And with sudden vigor it doth posset\r\n   And curd like eager droppings into milk,\r\n   The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine\r\n   And a most instant tetter marked about\r\n   Most lazar like, with vile and loathsome crust\r\n   All my smooth body.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed, however, that all or even a major portion of\r\nthe blood disks require to be changed or destroyed to produce a fatal\r\nresult, since death may supervene long before such a consummation can\r\nbe realized. It is the capillary circulation that suffers chiefly,\r\nsince the very size and caliber of the heart cavities and trunk\r\nvessels afford them comparative immunity. But of the greatly dissolved\r\nand disorganized condition of the blood that may occur secondarily, we\r\nhave evidences in the passive hæmorrhages that attack those that have\r\nrecovered from the immediate effects of serpent poisoning, following\r\nor coincident with subsidence of swelling and induration; and, as with\r\nscurvy, bleeding may occur from the mouth, throat, lungs, nose, and\r\nbowels, or from ulcerated surfaces and superficial wounds, or all\r\ntogether, defying all styptics and hæmastatics. In a case occurring\r\nunder the care of Dr. David Brainerd in the Illinois General\r\nHospital,[6] blood flowed from the gums in great profusion, and on\r\nexamination was found destitute, even under the microscope, of the\r\nfaintest indications of fibrine--the principle upon which coagulation\r\ndepends. The breath, moreover, gave most sickening exhalations,\r\nindicative of decomposition, producing serious illness in those\r\nexposed for any length of time to its influence. We may add, among\r\nother sequelæ, aside from death produced through primary and secondary\r\neffects, paralysis, loss of nerve power, impotence, hæmorrhage, even\r\nmortification or gangrene.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 6: _Medical Independent_, 1855.]\r\n\r\nThe failure in myotic power of the heart and in the muscles of\r\nrespiration through reflex influence of par vagum and great\r\nsympathetic nerves, whereby pulmonary circulation is impeded, are\r\namong the earliest of phenomena. Breathing becoming retarded and\r\nlaborious, the necessary supply of oxygen is no longer received, and\r\nblood still venous, in that it is not relieved of its carbon, is\r\nreturned through the arteries, whereby the capillaries of the brain\r\nare gorged with a doubly poisoned circulation, poisoned by both venom\r\nand carbon. In this we have ample cause for the attending train of\r\nsymptoms that, beginning with drowsiness, rapidly passes into stupor\r\nfollowed by profound coma and ultimate dissolution--marked evidence of\r\nthe fact that a chemical agent or poison may produce a mechanical\r\ndisease; and autopsical research reveals absolutely nothing save the\r\ngeneral disorganization of blood corpuscles, as already noted.\r\n\r\nTaking circumstantial and pathological evidences into consideration,\r\nthe hope of the person thus poisoned rests solely upon lack of\r\nvitality in the serpent and its venom, and in his personal\r\nidiosyncrasies, habits of life, condition of health, etc., and the\r\nvaried chapters of accidents. _To look for a specific, in any sense of\r\nthe word, is the utmost folly!_ The action of the poison and its train\r\nof results follow inoculation in too swift succession to be overtaken\r\nand counteracted by any antidote, supposing such to be a possible\r\nproduct, even if administered hypodermically. We have evidence of this\r\nin iodic preparations, iodine being the nearest approach to a perfect\r\nantidote that can be secured by mortal skill, inasmuch, if quickly\r\ninjected into the circulation, it retards and restrains the\r\ndisorganizing process whereby the continuity of the blood corpuscles\r\nis lost; moreover, it is a marked antiseptic, favors the production of\r\nadhesive inflammation, whereby lymph is effused and coagulated about\r\nthe bitten part, and absorption checked, and the poison rendered less\r\ndiffusible. But when a remedy is demanded that shall restore the\r\npristine form, functions, and energy of the disorganized globules, man\r\narrogates to himself supernal attributes whereby it becomes possible\r\nnot only to save and renew, _but to create life_; and we can scarce\r\nexpect science or even accident (as some expect) to even rival Nature\r\nand set at defiance her most secret and subtle laws. Such, however, is\r\nthe natural outcropping of an ignorant teaching and vulgar prejudice\r\nthat feeds and clothes the charlatan and ascribes to savage and\r\nuncultured races an occult familiarity with pathological,\r\nphysiological, and remedial effect unattainable by the most advanced\r\nsciences; and whereby the Negro, Malay, Hindoo, South Sea Islander,\r\nand red man are granted an innate knowledge of poisons and their\r\nantidotes more than miraculous. A reward of more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury's standing, and amounting to several thousand pounds, is\r\noffered by the East India Government for the discovery of a specific\r\nfor the bite of the cobra, and for which no claims have ever been\r\nadvanced; and the \"snake charmers\" or jugglers in whom this superior\r\nknowledge is supposed to center are so well aware of the futility of\r\nspecifics, and the risk to which they are subjected, that few venture\r\nto ply their calling without a broad-bladed, keen-edged knife\r\nconcealed about the person as a means of instant amputation in case of\r\naccident. Medical and scientific associations of various classes, in\r\nEurope, Australia, America, even Africa, and the East and West Indies,\r\nhave repeatedly held out the most tempting lures, and indulged in\r\nexhaustive and costly experimentation in search of specifics for the\r\nwounds of vipers, cobras, rattlesnakes, and the general horde of\r\nvenomous reptiles; and all in vain. Even the saliva of man, as well as\r\ncertain other secretions, is at times so modified by anger as to rival\r\nthe venom of the serpent in fatality, and it has no specific; and a\r\ncareful analysis of the pathological relations of such poison proves\r\nthat further experimentation and expectation is as irrational as the\r\npursuit of the \"philosopher's stone.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an indisputable fact, however, that there are individuals whose\r\nnatural or acquired idiosyncrasies permit them to be inoculated by the\r\nmost venomous of reptiles without deleterious or unpleasant results,\r\nand Colonel Matthews Taylor[7] knew several persons of this character\r\nin India, and who regarded the bite of the cobra or tic paloonga with\r\nnearly as much indifference as the sting of a gnat or mosquito. Again,\r\nin 1868, Mr. Drummond, a prominent magistrate of Melbourne,\r\nAustralia,[8] met with untimely death under circumstances that\r\nattracted no little attention. An itinerant vender of nostrums had on\r\nexhibition a number of venomous reptiles, by which he caused himself\r\nto be successively bitten, professing to secure immunity by reason of\r\na secret compound which he offered for sale at a round figure.\r\nConvinced that the fellow was an imposter, and his wares valuable only\r\nas a means of depleting the pockets of the credulous, Mr. Drummond\r\nloudly asserted the inefficacy of the nostrum, as well as the\r\ninnocuousness of the reptiles, which he assumed to be either naturally\r\nharmless, or rendered so by being deprived of their fangs; and in\r\nproof thereof insisted upon being himself bitten. To this experiment\r\nthe charlatan was extremely averse, offering strenuous objections, and\r\nfinally conveyed a point blank refusal. But Mr. Drummond's demands\r\nbecoming more imperative, and observing that his hesitancy impressed\r\nthe audience as a tacit acknowledgment of the allegations, he finally\r\nconsented, and placed in the hands of the magistrate a tiger snake,\r\nwhich he deemed least dangerous, and which instantly struck the\r\ngentleman in the wrist. The usual symptoms of serpent poisoning\r\nrapidly manifested themselves, followed by swelling and lividity of\r\nthe part, obstructed circulation and respiration, and coma; and in\r\nspite of the use of the vaunted remedy and the attentions of\r\nphysicians the result was most fatal. The vender subsequently conceded\r\nthe worthless character of his nostrum, declaring that be enjoyed\r\nexemption from the effects of of serpent poison by virtue of recovery\r\nfrom a severe inoculation in early life; and he further added he knew\r\n\"some people who were born so,\" who put him \"up to this dodge\" as a\r\nmeans of gaining a livelihood.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 7: _Vide_ report to Prof. J. Henry Bennett.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 8: London _Times_.]\r\n\r\nIt is a general supposition that such immunity, when congenital, is\r\nacquired _in utero_ by the inoculation of the parent, and Oliver\r\nWendell Holmes' fascinating tale of \"Elsie Venner\" embodies many\r\ninteresting features in this connection. Admitting such inoculation\r\nmay secure immunity, recent experiments in the action of this as well\r\nas kindred poisons give no grounds for believing it at all universal\r\nor even common, but as depending upon occult physiological or\r\naccidental phenomena. For instance, the writer and his father are\r\nequally proof against the contagion and inoculation of vaccination and\r\nvariola, in spite of repeated attempts to secure both, while their\r\nrespective mothers suffered terribly with smallpox at periods\r\nsubsequent to the birth of their children; and it is well understood\r\nthat there are striking analogies between the poisons of certain\r\ncontagious fevers and those of venomous serpents, inasmuch as one\r\nattack conveys exemption from future ones of like character. In other\r\nwords, many animal poisons, as well as the pathological ones of\r\nsmallpox, measles, scarlatina, whooping cough, etc., have the power of\r\nso modifying the animal economy, when it does not succumb to their\r\nprimary influence, as to ever after render it all but proof against\r\nthem. Witness, for instance, the ravages of the mosquito, that in\r\ncertain districts punishes most terribly all new comers, and who after\r\na brief residence suffer little, the bite no longer producing pain or\r\nswelling.\r\n\r\nRegarding the supposed correlation of serpent poison and the septic\r\nferments of certain tropical and infectious fevers, they are not\r\nnecessarily always contagious. It may be interesting to note that one\r\nDoctor Humboldt in 1852,[9] in an essay read before the Royal Academy\r\nof Medical Sciences at Havana, assumed their proximate identity, and\r\nadvocated the inoculation of the poison of one as a prophylactic of\r\nthe other. He claimed to have personally inoculated numberless persons\r\nin New Orleans, Vera Cruz, and Cuba with exceedingly dilute venom,\r\nthereby securing them perfect immunity from yellow fever. Aside from\r\nthe extraordinary nature of the statement, the fact that the doctor\r\naffirmed, he had never used the virus to an extent sufficient to\r\nproduce any of its toxic symptoms, cast discredit over the whole, and\r\nproofs were demanded and promised. This was the last of the subject,\r\nhowever, which soon passed into oblivion, though whether from failure\r\non the part of the medico to substantiate his assertions, or from the\r\ninanition of his colleagues, it is difficult to determine, though the\r\npresumption is largely in favor of the former. Nevertheless, it is\r\nworthy of consideration and exhaustive experimentation, since it is no\r\nless plausible than the theory which rendered the name of Jenner\r\nfamous.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 9: London _Lancet_.]\r\n\r\nOutside of the transfusion of blood, for which there are strong\r\nreasons for believing would be attended with happy results, the sole\r\nremedies available in serpent poisoning are measures looking to the\r\nprompt cutting off of the circulation of the affected part, and the\r\ndirect stimulation of the heart's action and the respiratory organs,\r\nuntil such a time as Nature shall have eliminated all toxical\r\nevidences; and these must necessarily be mechanical. Alcoholic\r\nstimulants are available only as they act mechanically in sustaining\r\ncardiac and pulmonary activity, and where their free use is prolonged\r\nefficacy is quickly exhausted, and they tend rather to hasten a fatal\r\nresult. They are devoid of the slightest antidotal properties, and in\r\nno way modify the activity of the venom; and an intoxicated person, so\r\nfar from enjoying the immunity with which he is popularly credited, is\r\nfar more apt to succumb to the virus than him of unfuddled intellect.\r\nThe reasons are obvious. Theoretically, for purely physiological and\r\ntherapeutic reasons _amyl nitrite_ should be of incalculable value,\r\nthough I have no knowledge of its use in this connection, since its\r\nvapor when inhaled is a most powerful stimulator of cardiac action,\r\nand when administered by the mouth it is unapproached in its control\r\nof spasmodically contracted vessels and muscles. The relief its vapor\r\naffords in the collapse of chloroform anæsthesia, in which dissolution\r\nis imminent from paralyzed heart's action, is instantaneous, and its\r\neffect upon the spasmodic and suffocative sensations of hydrophobia\r\nare equally prompt. Moreover, without further discussing its\r\nphysiological functions, it is the nearest approach to an antidote to\r\ncertain zymotic poisons, and especially valuable in warding off and\r\naborting the action of the ferment that gives rise to pertussis, or\r\nwhooping cough. _Iodide of ethyl_ is another therapeutical measure\r\nthat is worthy of consideration; and _iodoform_ in the treatment of\r\nthe sequelæ incident to recovery.\r\n\r\nThe native population of India, in spite of the contrary accepted\r\nopinion, are remarkably free from resort to nostrums that lay claim to\r\nbeing antidotes. The person inoculated by the cobra is at once seized\r\nby his friends, and constant and violent exercise enforced, if\r\nnecessary at the point of stick, and severe and cruel (but\r\nnevertheless truly merciful) beatings are often a result. In this we\r\nsee a direct application, without in the least understanding them, of\r\nthe rules laid down to secure certain physiological results, as for\r\nthe relief of opium and morphia narcosis, which serpent poisoning\r\nalmost exactly resembles. The late Doctor Spillsbury (Physician-General\r\nof Calcutta),[10] while stationed at Jubulpore, Central India, was\r\ninformed late one evening that his favorite horse keeper had just been\r\ndangerously bitten by a cobra of unusual size, and therefore more than\r\nordinarily venomous. He at once ordered his gig, and in spite of the\r\nwails and protestations of the sufferer and his friends, with whom a\r\nfatal result was already a foregone conclusion, the doctor caused his\r\nwrists to be bound firmly and inextricably to the back of the vehicle;\r\nthen assuring the man if he did not keep up he would most certainly be\r\ndragged to death, he mounted to his seat and drove rapidly away. Three\r\nhours later, or a little more, he returned, having covered nearly\r\nthirty miles without cessation or once drawing rein. The horse keeper\r\nwas found bathed in profuse perspiration, and almost powerless from\r\nexcessive fatigue. _Eau de luce_, an aromatic preparation of ammonia,\r\nwas now administered at frequent and regular intervals as a diffusible\r\nstimulant, and moderate though constant exercise enforced until near\r\ndawn, when the sufferer was found to be completely recovered.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 10: London _Lancet_.]\r\n\r\nThe value of violent and profuse cutaneous transpiration, thereby\r\nsecuring a rapidly eliminating channel for discharging poison from the\r\nsystem, is well known; in no other way can action be had so thorough,\r\nspeedy, and prompt. Captain Maxwell[11] tells us it was formerly the\r\ncustom among the Irish peasantry of Connaught, when one manifested\r\nunmistakable evidences of hydrophobia, to procure the death of the\r\nunfortunate by smothering between two feather beds. In one instance,\r\nafter undergoing this treatment, the supposed corpse was seen, to the\r\nhorror and surprise of all who witnessed it, to crawl from between the\r\nbolsters, when he was found to be entirely free from his disorder; the\r\nbeds, however, were saturated through and through with the\r\nperspiration that escaped the body in the intensity of his mortal\r\nagony. More recently a French physician,[12] recognizing the incubatory\r\nstage of rabies in his own person, resolved upon suicide rather than\r\nundergo its attendant horrors. The hot bath was selected for the\r\npurpose, with a view of gradually increasing its temperature until\r\nsyncope should be induced, which he hoped would be succeeded by death.\r\nTo his surprise, however, as the temperature of the water rose, his\r\nsensations of distress improved; and the very means chosen for\r\nterminating life became instead his salvation, restoring to perfect\r\nhealth. Again, Dr. Peter Hood[13] relates that a blacksmith residing in\r\nthe neighborhood of his country house was in high repute for miles\r\nabout by reason of his cures of rabies. His remedy consisted simply in\r\nforcing the person bitten to accompany him in a rapid walk or trot for\r\ntwenty miles or more, after which he administered copious draughts of\r\na hot decoction of broom tops, as much for its moral effect as for its\r\nvalue in sustaining and prolonging established diaphoresis.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 11: Wild Sports or the West.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 12: _L'Union Medicale_--name withheld by request of the\r\n  gentleman.]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 13: London _Lancet_.]\r\n\r\nThough the pathological conditions of hydrophobia and serpent\r\npoisoning are by no means parallel, the _rationale_ of the methods\r\nemployed in opening the emunctories of the skin are the same; and were\r\nit not for its powerful protracting effect and depressing action upon\r\nthe heart, we might perhaps secure valuable aid from jaborandi\r\n(_pilocarpus_), since it stimulates profusely all the secretions; as\r\nit is, more is to be hoped for in the former disorder than in the\r\nlatter. It would be desirable also to know what influence the Turkish\r\nbath might exert, and it would seem worthy at least of trial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FIND THE TIME OF TWILIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Scientific American_:\r\n\r\nGiven latitude N. 40° 51', declination N. 20° 25', sun 18° below the\r\nhorizon. To find the time of twilight at that place. In the\r\naccompanying diagram, E Q = equinoctial, D D = parallel of\r\ndeclination, Z S N a vertical circle, H O = the horizon, P = North\r\npole, Z = zenith, and S = the sun, 18° below the horizon, H O,\r\nmeasured on a vertical circle. It is seen that we have here given us\r\nthe three sides of a spherical triangle, viz., the co-latitude 49° 9',\r\nthe co declination 69° 35', and the zenith distance 108°, with which\r\nto compute the angle Z P S. This angle is found to be 139° 16' 5.6\".\r\nDividing this by 15 we have 9 h. 16 m. 24.4 s., from noon to the\r\nbeginning or termination of twilight. Now, in the given latitude and\r\ndeclination, the sun's center coincides with the horizon at sunset\r\n(allowance being made for refraction), at 7 h. 18 m. 29.3 s. from\r\napparent noon. Then if we subtract 7 h. 18 m. 29.3 s. from 9 h. 16 m.\r\n24.4 s., we shall have 1 h. 57 m. 55.1 s. as the duration of twilight.\r\nBut the real time of sunset must be computed when the sun has\r\ndescended about 50' below the horizon, at which point the sun's upper\r\nlimb coincides with the line, H O, of the horizon. This takes place 7\r\nh. 16 m. 30.8 s. mean time. It is hoped the above will be a sufficient\r\nanswer to L.N. (See SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN of Dec. 1, 1883, p. 346.)\r\n\r\nB.W.

De Quatrefages has recently spoken\r\nbefore the Academy of Sciences in Paris, and we extract from his\r\ndiscourse on \"Fossil Man and Savages\" some notes reported in the\r\n_Journal d'Hygiene_: \"It is in Oceanica and above all in Melanesia and\r\nin Polynesia where I have looked for examples of savage races. I have\r\nscarcely spoken of the Malays except to bring to the surface the\r\nfeatures which distinguish them among the ethnic groups which they at\r\ntimes touch, and which in turn frequently mingle with them. I have\r\nespecially studied the Papuans and Negritos. The Papuans are an\r\nexclusively Pelasgic race, that many anthropologists consider as\r\nalmost confined to New Guinea and the neighboring archipelago. But it\r\nbecomes more and more manifest that they have had also periods of\r\nexpansion and of dissemination.\r\n\r\n\"On one side they appear as conquerors in some islands of Micronesia;\r\non the other we have shown--M. Hamy and myself--that to them alone can\r\nbe assigned the skulls found in Easter Island and in New Zealand. They\r\nhave hence touched the east and south, the extremities of the maritime\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\"The Negritos, scarcely known a few years ago, and to-day confounded\r\nwith the Papuans by some anthropologists, have spread to the west and\r\nnorthwest.\r\n\r\n\"They have left unmistakable traces in Japan; we find them yet in the\r\nPhilippines and in many of the islands of the Malay archipelago; they\r\nconstitute the indigenous population of the Andaman Islands, in the\r\nGulf of Bengal. Indeed, they have formerly occupied a great part of\r\nthe two peninsulas of India, and I have elsewhere shown that we can\r\nfollow their steps to the foot of the Himalayas, and beyond the Indus\r\nto Lake Zerah. I have only sketched here the history of this race,\r\nwhose representatives in the past have been the type of the Asiatic\r\npygmies of whom Pliny and Ctesias speak, and whose _creoles_ were\r\nthose Ethiopians, black and with smooth hair, who figured in the army\r\nof Xerxes.\r\n\r\n\"I have devoted two long examinations to another black race much less\r\nimportant in numbers and in the extent of their domain, but which\r\npossess for the anthropologist a very peculiar interest and a sad one.\r\nIt exists no more; its last representative, a woman, died in 1877. I\r\nrefer to the Tasmanians.\r\n\r\n\"The documents gathered by various English writers, and above all by\r\nBouwick, give numerous facts upon the intellectual and moral character\r\nof the Tasmanians. The complete destruction of the Tasmanians,\r\naccomplished in at most 72 years over a territory measuring 4,400\r\nsquare leagues, raises a sorrowful and difficult question. Their\r\nextinction has been explained by the barbarity of the civilized\r\nEuropeans, and which, often conspicuous, has never been more\r\ndestructively present than in their dealings with the Tasmanians. But\r\nI am convinced that this is an error. I certainly do not wish to\r\napologize for or extenuate the crimes of the convicts and colonists,\r\nagainst which the most vigorous protests have been raised both in\r\nEngland and in the colony itself, but neither war nor social disasters\r\nhave been the principal cause of the disappearance of the Tasmanians.\r\nThey have perished from that strange malady which Europeans have\r\neverywhere transplanted in the maritime world, and which strikes down\r\nthe most flourishing populations.\r\n\r\n\"Consumption is certainly one of the elements of this evil. But if it\r\nexplains the increase of the death rate, it does not explain the\r\ndiminution of births. Both these phenomena are apparent. Captain Juan\r\nhas seen at the Marquesas, in the island of Taio-Hahe, the population\r\nfall in three years from 400 souls to 250. To offset this death-rate,\r\nwe find only 3 or 4 births. It is evident that at this rate\r\npopulations rapidly disappear, and it is the principal cause of the\r\ndisappearance of the Tasmanians.\"\r\n\r\nThe lecturer, after alluding to his studies in Polynesia, speaks of\r\nhis interest in the western representatives of these races and his\r\nspecial studies in New Zealand, and referring to the latter continues:\r\n\r\n\"One of the most important results of the labors in this direction has\r\nbeen to establish the serious value of the historical songs preserved,\r\namong the Maoris, by the _Tohungus_, or _wise men_, who represent the\r\n_Aiepas_ of Tahiti. Thanks to these living archives, we have been able\r\nto reconstruct a history of the natives, to fix almost the epoch of\r\nthe first arrival of the Polynesians in that land, so distant from\r\ntheir other centers of population, and to determine their point of\r\ndeparture.\"\r\n\r\nOther studies refer to peoples far removed from the preceding. One is\r\ndevoted to the Todas, a very small tribe of the Nilgherie Hills, who\r\nby their physical, intellectual, and social characteristics differ\r\nfrom all the other races of India. \"The Todas burn their dead, and we\r\npossess none of their skulls. But thanks to M. Janssen, who has lived\r\namong them, I have been able to fill up this gap.\"\r\n\r\nThe last subject referred to by the lecturer was the Finns of Finland,\r\nwhose study reveals the fact that they embrace two ethnic types, one\r\nof which, the _Tavastlanda_, belongs without doubt to the great\r\nFinnish family, spread over Asia as well as in Europe, and a second,\r\nthe Karelien, whose representatives possessed the poetic instinct,\r\nwhich causes M. Quatrefages to ally them with the Aryan race, \"to whom\r\nwe owe all our epics, from the Ramayana, Iliad, and Eneas to the poems\r\nof to-day.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGRECIAN ANTIQUITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONUMENT OF PHILOPAPPUS, ATHENS.]\r\n\r\nAlthough so much has been written about Athens, there is one striking\r\nfeature which has been little noticed. This is the beautiful colors of\r\nthe Parthenon and Erectheum, the soft mellow yellow which is due to\r\nage, and which gives these buildings when lighted by the setting sun,\r\nand framed by the purple hills beyond, the appearance of temples of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB FROM THE CERAMICUS, ATHENS.]\r\n\r\nUntil A.D. 1687 the Parthenon remained almost perfect, and then not\r\nage but a shell from the Venetians falling upon Turkish powder, made a\r\nrent which, when seen from below, makes it look like two temples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOWER OF THE WINDS, ATHENS.]\r\n\r\nThe Temple of Theseus is the best preserved and one of the oldest of\r\nthe buildings of ancient Athens. It was founded in B.C. 469, and is a\r\nsmall, graceful, and perfect Doric temple. Having served as a\r\nChristian church, dedicated to St. George, it escaped injury. It\r\ncontains the beautiful and celebrated tombstone of Aristion, the\r\nwarrior of Marathon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ACROPOLIS, ATHENS.]\r\n\r\nAll that remains of Hadrian's great Temple to Zeus (A.D. 132) are a\r\nfew standing columns in an open space, which are imposing from their\r\nisolated position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD CORINTH AND THE ACROCORINTHUS.]\r\n\r\nThe monument of Philopappus is thought to have been begun A.D. 110,\r\nand for a king in Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPLE OF JUPITER, ATHENS.]\r\n\r\nThe Tower of the Winds, erected by Andronicus Cyrrhestes about B.C.\r\n100, contained a weathercock, a sun dial, and a water clock. It is an\r\noctagonal building, with reliefs on the frieze, representing by\r\nappropriate figures the eight winds into which the Athenian compass\r\nwas divided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PANTHENON, ATHENS.]\r\n\r\nIn the Street of Tombs the monuments are lying or standing as they\r\nwere found; each year shows many changes in Athens, a tomb last year\r\nin the Ceramicus may be this year in a museum. There is a great\r\nsimilarity in all these tombstones; no doubt they were made\r\nbeforehand, as they seldom suggest the idea of a portrait. They\r\ngenerally represent an almost heroic leave-taking. The friends\r\nstanding in the act of saying farewell are receiving presents from the\r\ndead; often in the corner is a crouching slave, and frequently a dog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ERECTEUM, ATHENS.]\r\n\r\nBeyond the river Kephiesus, the hill of Colonus, and the groves of the\r\nAcademy, is the Pass of Daphne, which was the road to Eleusis, and\r\nalong which passed the annual sacred processions in the days of the\r\nMysteries. Cut there in the rock are the niches for the votive\r\nofferings. This dark Daphne Pass seems still to possess an air of\r\nmystery which is truly in keeping with the rites which were once\r\nobserved there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NICHES FOR VOTIVE OFFERINGS ON THE SACRED WAY TO\r\nELEUSIS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPLE OF CORINTH, FROM THE MONUMENT OF PHILOPAPPUS.]\r\n\r\nFrom several points in Athens, on very clear days, may be seen the\r\ngreat rock fort Acrocorinthus, which is directly above the site of\r\nancient Corinth. It is now a deserted fort; the Turkish drawbridge and\r\ngate stand open and unused. There are on it remains of a Turkish town;\r\nat one time it was one of the strongest and most important citadels in\r\nGreece. In the middle of the almost deserted, wretched, straggling\r\nvillage of Old Corinth stand seven enormous massive columns. These are\r\nall that remain of the Temple, and indeed of ancient Corinth. The\r\npillars, of the Doric order, are of a brown limestone, not of the\r\ncountry. The Turks and earthquakes have destroyed Old Corinth, and\r\ndriven the inhabitants to New Corinth, about one hour and a half's\r\ndrive from the Gulf.--_London Graphic_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEMPLE OF THESEUS, ATHENS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMBSTONE IN THE CERAMICUS, ATHENS.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPANISH FISHERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spanish Court at the late Fisheries Exhibition was large and well\r\nfurnished, there being several characteristic models of vessels. No\r\ncertain figures can be obtained of the results of the whole fishing\r\nindustry of Spain. It is, however, estimated that 14,202 boats, with a\r\ntonnage of 51,397 tons, were employed during the year 1882. They gave\r\noccupation to 59,974 men, and took about 78,000 tons of fish. The\r\nGovernment interfere in the fishing industry only to the extent of\r\ncollecting and distributing information to the fishermen on subjects\r\nthat are most likely to be of use to them in their calling. In\r\nconsequence, principally no doubt of this wise policy, we find in\r\nSpain a vigorous and self-reliant class of men engaged in the\r\nfisheries. Some of the most interesting features in the Spanish Court\r\nwere the contributions sent by the different fishermen's associations,\r\nand although the Naval Museum of Madrid supplied a collection of\r\narticles that would have formed a good basis in itself for an\r\nexhibition, yet in no other foreign court was the fishing industry of\r\nthe nation better illustrated by private enterprise than in that of\r\nSpain. The fishing associations referred to are half benefit societies\r\nand half trading communities. That of Lequeito has issued a small\r\npamphlet, from which we learn that this body consists of 600 members\r\ndivided into three classes, viz., owners of vessels, patrons or men in\r\ncharge, and ordinary fishermen. A board of directors, consisting of 22\r\nowners, and 24 masters of boats or ordinary fishermen, has the sole\r\ncontrol of the affairs of the society. The meetings are presided over\r\nby a majordomo elected triennially, and who must be the owner of a\r\nboat over 40 ft. long. This functionary receives a stipend of 8,000\r\nreales a year, a sum which sounds more modest when expressed as 80_l_.\r\nHe has two clerks, who are on the permanent staff, to help him. His\r\nduties are to keep the books with the assistance of the two clerks, to\r\ntake charge of the sales of all fish, recover moneys, and make\r\nnecessary payments. In stormy weather he gets up in a watch tower and\r\nguides boats entering the harbor. The _atalayero_ is an official of\r\nthe society, whose duty it is to station himself on the heights and\r\nsignal by means of smoke, to the boats at sea, the movements of\r\nschools of sardines and anchovies or probable changes of weather. It\r\nis also the duty of this officer to weigh all the bream caught from\r\nthe 1st November to the 31st of March, for which he receives a\r\n\"gratuity\" of 100 pesetas, or say 4_l._, sterling. Two other señeros,\r\nor signalmen, are told off to keep all boats in port during bad\r\nweather, and to call together the crews when circumstances appear\r\nfavorable for sailing. Should there be a difference of opinion between\r\nthese experts as to the meteorological probabilities, the patrons, or\r\nskippers of the fishing-boats, are summoned in council and their\r\nopinion taken by \"secret vote with black and white balls.\" The\r\ndecision so arrived at is irrevocable, and all are bound to sail\r\nshould it be so decided; those who do not do so paying a fine to the\r\nfunds of the association. The boats carrying the señeros fly a color\r\nby means of which they signal orders for sailing to the other vessels.\r\nThese señeros appear to be the Spanish equivalent to the English\r\nadmiral of a trawling fleet.\r\n\r\nThe boats used by these fishermen are fine craft; one or two models of\r\nthem were shown in the Exhibition. A first-class boat will be of about\r\nthe following dimensions: Length over all, 45 ft. to 50 ft.; breadth\r\n(extreme), 9 ft. to 10 ft. 3 in.; depth (inside), 3 ft. 10 in. to 4\r\nft. The keel is of oak 6 in. by 3½ in. The stem and stern posts are\r\nalso of oak. The planking is generally of oak or walnut--the latter\r\npreferred--and is 3 in. thick, the width of the planks being 4½ in.\r\nMany boats are now constructed of hard wood to the water line and\r\nNorway pine above.\r\n\r\nThe fastenings are galvanized nails 4½ in. long. The mast-partners and\r\nall the thwarts are of oak 1½ in. thick and 8 in. wide; the latter are\r\nfastened in with iron knees. Lee-board and rudder are of oak, walnut,\r\nor chestnut; the rudder extends 3½ ft. to 4 ft. below the keel, and,\r\nin giving lateral resistance, balances the lee-board, which is thrust\r\ndown forward under the lee-bow. The rig consists of two lags, the\r\nsmaller one forward right in the eyes of the boat; the mainmast being\r\namidships. The lug sails are set on long yards, the fair-weather rig\r\nconsisting of a fore lug with 120 square yards, and a main lug of 200\r\nsquare yards. There are six shifts of sail, the main being substituted\r\nfor the fore lug in turn as the weather increases, in a manner similar\r\nto that in which our own Mounts Bay boats reduce canvas. The fair\r\nweather rig requires two masts 42 ft. and 36 ft. long, and yards 28\r\nft. and 30 ft. long, respectively. The oars are 16 ft. long, and are\r\npulled double-banked. Such a boat will cost 90_l._ to 100_l._ fitted for\r\nsea, of which sum the hull will represent rather more than half. These\r\nvessels generally remain at sea for twelve hours, from about three to\r\nfour in the morning until the same time in the evening. Tunny, merluza\r\n(a species of cod), and bream are the principal fish taken. The\r\nfirst-named are caught by hook and line operated by means of poles\r\nrigged out from the boat much in the same way, apparently, as we drail\r\nfor mackerel on the southwest coast. A filament of maize straw is used\r\nfor bait. The boat sails to a distance of about 90 miles off the land\r\nand run back before the prevailing wind, until they are about nine\r\nmiles from the shore or until they lose the fish. When the fisherman\r\ngets a bite the wind is spilled out of the sail so as to deaden the\r\nboat's way. The fish is then got alongside, promptly gaffed, and got\r\non board. Tunny sells for about three halfpence a pound in Lequeito.\r\nThe season extends from June to November. Bream are taken in the\r\nwinter and spring, 9 to 12 miles off the coast. They are caught by\r\nhook and line in two ways. The first is worth describing. A line 50\r\nfathoms long has bent to it snoods with hooks attached, 16 in. apart.\r\nEach man handles three lines. On reaching the fishing ground the line,\r\nto the end of which a stone is attached, is gradually paid out until\r\nsoundings are taken; then another stone is attached and the operation\r\nrepeated. If a bite is felt the line is slacked away freely, and this\r\ngoes on until about 500 fathoms are overboard. When, by the lively and\r\ncontinuous jerking of the line, the fisherman concludes that he has a\r\ngood number of fish on the hooks, he will haul aboard and then prepare\r\nto shoot again.\r\n\r\nThe second method of taking the bream is by long lining; fifty of the\r\nlines we have just described being bent together and duly anchored and\r\nbuoyed. Spaniards do not much care for this way of fishing, as it is\r\ncostly in bait and the gear is often lost in bad weather. Bream sells\r\nat about 3½d. a pound. Cod are taken during the first six months of\r\nthe year, about 9 miles off shore, by hand lines. Sold fresh the price\r\nis about 6_d._ per lb. A small quantity is preserved in tins. Anchovy or\r\ncuttlefish is the bait used; sometimes the two are placed on one hook.\r\n\r\nA smaller description of boat, called traineras, is built especially\r\nfor taking sardine and anchovy, although in fine weather they often\r\nengage in the same fishery as the larger boats. The traineras are\r\nlight and shapely vessels, with a graceful sheer and curved stem and\r\nstern posts. The keel is much cambered, and the bottom is flat and has\r\nconsiderable hollow. The usual dimensions vary between: Length, 38\r\nfeet to 42 feet; beam, 7 feet to 7 feet 6 inches; depth, 2 feet 6\r\ninches to 2 feet 10 inches. The sails and gear are much the same as in\r\nthe larger boats, excepting that there are only four shifts in place\r\nof six. The largest main lug has an area of about 90 square yards and\r\nthe fore lug about 50 square yards. The other sails for heavier\r\nweather are naturally smaller. The largest masts for fine weather are\r\nrespectively 36 feet and 22 feet, long. The average cost of one of\r\nthese boats and gear is about £122, made up as follows: Hull, £32;\r\nsails, gear, and oars, £30; nets and gear attached, £60. The season\r\nfor anchovy fishing commences on the 1st of March and ends 30th of\r\nJune; it begins again on the 15th of September, and continues until\r\nthe end of the year. Most fish are taken at a distance of about 9\r\nmiles from the land, although they often come in much closer.\r\nAnchovies are sold fresh, or are salted to be sent away, some are used\r\nfor bait, and in times of great plenty quantities are put on the land\r\nfor manure. The greater part are, however, preserved in barrels or\r\ntins, and are exported to France or England.\r\n\r\nThe net used in the capture of anchovies is called _traina_ or _copo_.\r\nIt is in principle like the celebrated purse seine of the United\r\nStates, but in place of being 200 fathoms long, as are many of the\r\nnets, which, in American waters, will inclose a whole school of\r\nmackerel, it is but 32 to 40 fathoms long. The depth is 7 to 10\r\nfathoms, and the mesh ¾ inch. Sardine fishing commences on the 1st of\r\nJuly and lasts until December. The principal ground is 2 to 10 miles\r\noff shore. The price of sardines on the coast is about 2½d. per pound.\r\nWhen the sardines appear in shoals they are taken with the traina in\r\nthe same way as anchovies, a net of ½-inch mesh being used. Sardines\r\nare also taken by gill nets about 200 feet long and 18 feet wide. When\r\nused in the daytime the fish are tolled up by a bait consisting of the\r\nliver of cod. When the sardines have been attracted to the\r\nneighborhood of the net, bait is thrown on the other side of it. The\r\nfish in their rush for the bait become entangled in the mesh. These\r\nnets are sometimes anchored out all night, in which case no bait is\r\nused.\r\n\r\nA third class of boats of much the same character are of about the\r\nfollowing dimensions: Length, 28 feet to 35 feet; beam, 7 feet 6\r\ninches to 8 feet; depth, 2 feet 6 inches to 2 feet 8 inches. The two\r\nlugs will contain 16 and 30 square yards of canvas respectively. They\r\nare used for sardine catching, when they will carry a crew of four\r\nmen, or for taking conger and cod, in which case they will be manned\r\nby eight hands.\r\n\r\nTheir cost will average approximately as follows: Hull, £15; gear and\r\nsail, £10; nets and lines, £13; about £40. The conger season extends\r\nfrom March to June, and from October to November. The fish are taken\r\nby hook and line; sardine and fish known as berdel (which in turn is\r\ntaken by a hook covered with a feather) are used as bait.\r\n\r\nThere are other smaller fishing boats, among which may be noticed the\r\n_bateler_, a powerful little vessel, 13 feet to 16 ft. long, about 5½\r\nft. wide, and 2 ft. deep. They are sailed by one man, set a good\r\nspread of canvas, and are fast and handy. They are used for taking a\r\nspecies of cuttlefish which supplies a bait, and is caught by hook and\r\nline, the fishes being attracted by colored threads, at which they\r\nrush, when the hook will catch in their tentacles. There is a small\r\nwell in the middle of the boat for keeping the fish alive. None of the\r\nboats on the northern coast of Spain carry ballast. They have flat\r\nhollow floors, and set a large area of of canvas on a shallow draught.\r\nLobster fishing is pursued in much the same manner as in England, but\r\noften four or five miles from land, and in very deep water.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable objects in the Spanish court was a\r\nfull-sized boat about 25 ft. long, which had a square hole cut in the\r\nbottom amidships. Through this hole was let down a glass frame in\r\nwhich was placed a powerful paraffine lamp. The object of this was to\r\nattract the fish. It is said that tunny will be drawn from a distance\r\nof over a hundred yards, and will follow the boat so that they may be\r\nenticed into the nets. Sardines and other fish will follow the light\r\nin shoals. It is claimed that the boat will be useful in diving\r\noperations, for pearl or coral fishing, or for ascertaining the\r\ndirection of submarine currents, which can be seen at night by a lamp\r\nto a depth to 25 to 30 fathoms.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDUCK SHOOTING AT MONTAUK.\r\n\r\n\r\nMontauk Point, Long Island, is the most isolated and desolate spot\r\nimaginable during this weather. The frigid monotony of winter has\r\nsettled down upon that region, and now it is haunted only by sea fowl.\r\nThe bleak, barren promontory whereon stands the light is swept clean\r\nof its summer dust by the violent raking of cold hurricanes across it,\r\nand coated with ice from the wind-dashed spume of the great breakers\r\nhurled against the narrow sand spit which makes the eastern terminus\r\nof the island. The tall, white towered light and its black lantern,\r\nnow writhing in frosty northern blizzards, and again shivering in\r\neasterly gales, now glistening with ice from the tempest tossed seas\r\nall about it, and now varnished with wreaths of fog, is the only\r\nhabitation worthy of the name for many miles around. Keeper Clark and\r\nhis family and assistants are almost perpetually fenced in from the\r\noutside world by the cold weather, and have to hug closely the roaring\r\nfires that protect them in that desolation.\r\n\r\nBut for ducks and the duck hunter the lighthouse family would die of\r\ninanition. With the cold weather comes the ducks, and they continue to\r\ncome till the warmer blasts of spring drive them to the northward.\r\nMontauk Point is a favorite haunt for this sort of wild fowl. It is a\r\ngood feeding ground, is isolated, and there is nearly always a weather\r\nshore for the flocks to gather under. But year by year the point is\r\nbeing more and more frequented by sportsmen, and the reports of their\r\nsuccesses increase the applicants for lodgings at the light. Some 20\r\ngunners were out there last week with the most improved paraphernalia\r\nfor the sport, and did telling work. Flight shooting is the favorite\r\nmethod of taking them. The light stands very near the end of the\r\npoint, about a sixteenth of a mile to the west, and all migratory\r\nbirds in passing south seem to have it down in their log-book that\r\nthey must not only sight this structure, but must also fly over it as\r\nnearly as possible. Hence the variety and extent of the flocks which\r\nare continually passing is a matter of interest and wonder to a\r\nstudent of natural history as well as to the sportsman. Coots,\r\nwhistlers, soft bills, old squaws, black ducks, cranes, belated wild\r\ngeese, and, in fact, all sorts of northern birds make up this long and\r\nstrange procession, and the air is frequently so densely packed with\r\nthem as to be actually darkened, while the keen, whistling music of\r\ntheir whizzing wings makes a melody that comparatively few landsmen\r\never hear. Millions of the birds never hesitate at this point in their\r\nflight, although thousands of them do. These latter make the\r\nneighboring waters their home for the rest of the winter. Great flocks\r\nof ducks are continually sailing about the rugged shores, and the\r\nfrozen cranberry marshes of Fort Pond Bay, lying to the westward, are\r\ntheir favorite feeding-grounds. The birds are always as fat as butter\r\nwhen making their flight, and their piquant, spicy flavor leads to\r\ntheir being barbecued by the wholesale at the seat of shooting\r\noperations. One of the gunner's cabins has nailed up in it the heads\r\nof 345 ducks that have been roasted on the Point this winter.\r\n\r\nEarly morning is the favorite time for shooting. At daybreak the\r\nflights are heavy, and from that time until seven o'clock in the\r\nmorning they increase until it seems as though all the flocks which\r\nhad spent the night in the caves and ponds on the Connecticut shore\r\nwere on the wing and away for the south. By ten o'clock in the\r\nforenoon the flights grow rarer, and the rest of the day only\r\nstragglers come along. A good gunner can take five dozen of these\r\nbirds easily in a morning's work, provided he can and will withstand\r\nthe inclemency of the weather.\r\n\r\nKeeper Clark never shoots ducks. Scarcely a morning has dawned for two\r\nmonths but that several of the poor birds have been picked up at the\r\nfoot of the light house tower with the broken necks which have mutely\r\ntold the story of death, reached by plunging headlong against the\r\ncrystal walls of the dazzling lantern overhead the night before. There\r\nis a tendency with such migratory birds as are on the wing at night to\r\nfly very high. But the great, glaring, piercing, single eye of Montauk\r\nlight seems to draw into it by dozens, as a loadstone pulls a magnet,\r\nits feathered victims, and they swerve in their course and make\r\nstraight for it. As they flash nearer and nearer, the light, of\r\ncourse, grows brighter and brighter, and at length they dash into what\r\nappears a sea of fire, to be crushed lifeless by the heavy glass, and\r\nthey fall to the ground below, ready to be plucked for the oven.\r\nInside the lantern the thud made by these birds when they strike is\r\nreadily felt. Although they are comparatively small, yet so great is\r\ntheir velocity that the impact creates a perceptible jar, and the\r\nlantern is disfigured with plashes of their blood. Upon stormy and\r\nfoggy nights the destruction of birds is found to be greatest. When\r\nthe weather is clear and fair many smaller birds, like robins,\r\nsparrows, doves, cuckoos, rail, snipe, etc., will circle about the\r\nlight all night long, leaving only when the light is extinguished in\r\nthe morning. Large cranes show themselves to be almost dangerous\r\nvisitors.

There are nine species known to\r\nbotanists, most of them being middle-sized trees. In addition to those\r\nmentioned below, figures of which are herewith given, there are four\r\nspecies from Japan and one from the Himalayan region which do not yet\r\nseem to have found their way to this country; these five are therefore\r\nomitted. All are deciduous trees, and every one is thoroughly\r\ndeserving of cultivation. The origin of the English name is quaintly\r\nexplained by Gerard in his \"Herbal\" as follows: \"The wood,\" he says,\r\n\"in time, waxeth so hard, that the toughness and hardness of it may be\r\nrather compared to horn than unto wood, and therefore it was called\r\nhorne-beam or hardbeam.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARPINUS ORIENTALIS.]\r\n\r\n_Carpinus Betulus_,[1] the common hornbeam, as is the case with so\r\nmany of our native or widely cultivated trees, exhibits considerable\r\nvariation in habit, and also in foliage characters. Some of the more\r\nstriking of these, those which have received names in nurseries, etc.,\r\nand are propagated on account of their distinctive peculiarities, are\r\ndescribed below. In a wild state C. Betulus occurs in Europe from\r\nGothland southward, and extends also into West Asia. Although\r\napparently an undoubted native in the southern counties of England, it\r\nappears to have no claim to be considered indigenous as far as the\r\nnorthern counties are concerned; it has also been planted wherever it\r\noccurs in Ireland.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 1: IDENTIFICATION.--Carpinus Betulus, L., Loudon,\r\n  \"Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum,\" vol. iii., p. 2004; Encycl.\r\n  of Trees and Shrubs, 917.

In the sixteenth\r\ncentury the topiary art had reached its highest point of development,\r\nand was looked upon as the perfection of gardening; the hornbeam--and\r\nindeed almost every other tree--was cut and tortured into every\r\nimaginable shape. The \"picturesque style,\" however, soon drove the\r\ntopiarist and his art out of the field, yet even now places still\r\nremain in England where the old and once much-belauded fashion still\r\nexists on a large scale--a fact by no means to be deplored from an\r\narchæological point of view. Dense, quaintly-shaped hornbeam hedges\r\nare not unfrequent in the gardens of many old English mansions, and in\r\nsome old country farmhouses the sixteenth century craze is still\r\nperpetuated on a smaller scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARPINUS BETULUS, LEAF, CATKINS, AND FRUIT.]\r\n\r\nSir J.E. Smith, in his \"English Flora,\" after enumerating the virtues\r\nof the hornbeam as a hedge plant, gives it as his opinion that \"when\r\nstanding by itself and allowed to take its natural form, the hornbeam\r\nmakes a much more handsome tree than most people are aware of.\" Those\r\nwho are familiar with the fine specimens which exist at Studley Park\r\nand elsewhere will have no hesitation in confirming Sir J.E. Smith's\r\nstatement. The Hornbeam Walk in Richmond Park, from Pembroke Lodge\r\ntoward the Ham Gate, will recur to many Southerners as a good instance\r\nof the fitness of the hornbeam for avenues. In the walk in question\r\nthere are many fine trees, which afford a thorough and agreeable shade\r\nduring the summer months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARPINUS VIMINEA.]\r\n\r\nIn any soil or position the hornbeam will grow readily, except\r\nexceedingly dry or too marshy spots. On chalky hillsides it does not\r\ngrow so freely as on clayey plains. Under the latter conditions,\r\nhowever, the wood is not so good. In mountainous regions the hornbeam\r\noccupies a zone lower than that appropriated by the beech, rarely\r\nascending more than 1,200 yards above sea level. It is not injured by\r\nfrost, and in Germany is often seen fringing the edges of the beech\r\nforests along the bottom of the valleys where the beech would suffer.\r\nScarcely any tree coppices more vigorously or makes more useful\r\npollards on dry grass land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRANCH OF CARPINUS BETULUS.]\r\n\r\nOn account of its great toughness the wood of the hornbeam is employed\r\nin engineering work for cogs in machinery. When subjected to vertical\r\npressure it cannot be completely destroyed; its fibers, instead of\r\nbreaking off short, double up like threads, a conclusive proof of its\r\nflexibility and fitness for service in machinery (Laslett's \"Timber\r\nand Timber Trees\"). According to the same recent authority, the\r\nvertical or crushing strain on cubes of 2 inches average 14.844 tons,\r\nwhile that on cubes of 1 inch is 3.711 tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEAVES OF CARPINUS BETULUS QUERCOFOLIA.]\r\n\r\nA few years ago an English firm required a large quantity of hornbeam\r\nwood for the manufacture of lasts, but failed to procure it in\r\nEngland. They succeeded, however, in obtaining a supply from France,\r\nwhere large quantities of this timber are used for that purpose. It\r\nmay be interesting to state that in England at any rate lasts are no\r\nlonger made to any extent by hand, but are rapidly turned in enormous\r\nnumbers by machinery. In France _sabots_ are also made of hornbeam\r\nwood, but the difficulty in working it and its weight render it less\r\nvaluable for _sabotage_ than beech. For turnery generally, cabinet\r\nmaking, and also for agricultural implements, etc., this wood is\r\nhighly valued; in some of the French winegrowing districts, viz., Côte\r\nd'Or and Yonne, hoops for the wine barrels are largely made from this\r\ntree. It makes the best fuel and it is preferred to every other for\r\napartments, as it lights easily, makes a bright flame, which burns\r\nequally, continues a long time, and gives out an abundance of heat.\r\n\"Its charcoal is highly esteemed, and in France and Switzerland it is\r\npreferred to most others, not only for forges and for cooking by, but\r\nfor making gunpowder, the workmen at the great gunpowder manufactory\r\nat Berne rarely using any other. The inner bark, according to Linnæus,\r\nis used for dyeing yellow. The leaves, when dried in the sun, are used\r\nin France as fodder; and when wanted for use in water, the young\r\nbranches are cut off in the middle of summer, between the first and\r\nsecond growth, and strewed or spread out in some place which is\r\ncompletely sheltered from the rain to dry without the tree being in\r\nthe slightest degree injured by the operation.\" (Dict. des Eaux et\r\nForêts, art. Charme, as quoted by London).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEAVES OF CARPINUS BETULUS INCISA.]\r\n\r\nIt hardly seems necessary to dwell upon the value of the hornbeam as a\r\nhedge or shelter plant. In many nurseries it is largely used for these\r\npurposes, the russet-brown leaves remaining on the twigs until\r\ndisplaced by the new growths in spring.\r\n\r\n_Var. incisa_ (Aiton, \"Hortus Kewensis,\" v., 301; C. asplenifolia,\r\nHort.; C. laciniata, Hort.).--These three names represent two forms,\r\nwhich are, however, so near each other, that for all practical\r\npurposes they are identical. A glance at the accompanying figure will\r\nshow how distinct and ornamental this variety is.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORNBEAMS (ONE WITH INOSCULATED TRUNK).]\r\n\r\n_Var. quercifolia_ (Desf. tabl. de l'ecol. de bot. du Mus. d'hist.\r\nnat., 213; Ostrya quercifolia, Hort.; Carpinus heterophylla,\r\nHort.)--This form, as will be seen by the figure, is thoroughly\r\ndistinct from the common hornbeam; it has very much smaller leaves\r\nthan the type, their outline, as implied by the varietal name,\r\nresembling that of the foliage of the oak. It frequently reverts to\r\nthe type, and, as far as my experience goes, appears to be much less\r\nfixed than the variety incisa.\r\n\r\n_Var. purpurea_ (Hort.).--The young leaves of this are brownish red;\r\nit is well worth growing for the pleasing color effect produced by the\r\nyoung growths in spring. Apart from color it does not differ from the\r\ntype.\r\n\r\n_Var. fastigiata_ (Hort.).--In this variety the branches are more\r\nascending and the habit altogether more erect; indeed, among the\r\nhornbeams this is a counterpart of the fastigiate varieties of the\r\ncommon oak.\r\n\r\n_Var. variegata_, aureo-variegata, albo-variegata\r\n(albo-marmorata).--These names represent forms differing so slightly\r\nfrom each other, that it is not worth while to notice them separately,\r\nor even to treat them as distinct. In no case that I have seen is the\r\nvariegation at all striking, and, except in tree collections,\r\nvariegated hornbeams are hardly worth growing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FULL GROWN HORNBEAM IN WINTER. CARPINUS BETULUS (Full\r\ngrown tree at Chiswick, 45 ft. high in 1844).]\r\n\r\n_Carpinus orientalis_[2] (the Oriental hornbeam) principally differs\r\nfrom our native species in its smaller size, the lesser leaves with\r\ndowny petioles, and the green, much-lacerated bractlets. It is a\r\nnative of the south of Europe, whence it extends to the Caucasus, and\r\nprobably also to China; the Carpinus Turczaninovi of Hance scarcely\r\nseems to differ, in any material point at any rate, from western\r\nexamples of C. orientalis. According to Loudon, it was introduced to\r\nthis country by Philip Miller in 1739, and there is no doubt that it\r\nis far from common even now. It is, however, well worth growing; the\r\nshort twiggy branches, densely clothed with dark green leaves, form a\r\nthoroughly efficient screen. The plant bears cutting quite as well as\r\nthe common hornbeam, and wherever the latter will grow this will also\r\nsucceed. In that very interesting compilation, \"Hortus Collinsonianus,\"\r\nthe following memorandum occurs: \"The Eastern hornbeam was raised from\r\nseed sent me from Persia, procured by Dr. Mounsey, physician to the\r\nCzarina. Received it August 2, 1751, and sowed it directly; next year\r\n(1752) the hornbeam came up, which was the original of all in England.\r\nMr. Gordon soon increased it, and so it came into the gardens of the\r\ncurious. At the same time, from the same source, were raised a new\r\nacacia, a quince, and a bermudiana, the former very different from any\r\nin our gardens.\" This memorandum was probably written from recollection\r\nlong afterward, with an error in the dates, and the species was first\r\nentered in the catalogue as follows: \"Azad, arbor persica carpinus\r\nfolio, Persian hornbeam, raised from seed, anno 1747; not in England\r\nbefore.\" It appears, however, from Rand's \"Index\" that there was a\r\nplant of it in the Chelsea Garden in 1739. The name duinensis was given\r\nby Scopoli, because of his having first found it wild at Duino. As,\r\nhowever, Miller had previously described it under the name orientalis,\r\nthat one is adopted in accordance with the rule of priority, by which\r\nmust be decided all such questions in nomenclature.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 2: IDENTIFICATION.--Carpinus orientalis.

Emerson, in his \"Trees and Shrubs of Massachusetts,\" pays a\r\njust tribute to this tree from a decorative standpoint. He says: \"The\r\ncrimson, scarlet, and orange of its autumnal colors, mingling into a\r\nrich purplish red, as seen at a distance, make it rank in splendor\r\nalmost with the tupelo and the scarlet oak. It is easily cultivated,\r\nand should have a corner in every collection of trees.\" It has\r\npointed, ovate oblong, sharply double serrate, nearly smooth leaves.\r\nThe acute bractlets are three-lobed, halberd-shaped, sparingly\r\ncut-toothed on one side. Professor C.S. Sargent, in his catalogue of\r\nthe \"Forest Trees-of North America,\" gives the distribution, etc., of\r\nthe American hornbeam as follows: \"Northern Nova Scotia and New\r\nBrunswick, through the valley of St. Lawrence and Lower Ottawa Rivers,\r\nalong the northern shores of Lake Huron to Northern Wisconsin and\r\nMinnesota; south to Florida and Eastern Texas. Wood resembling that of\r\nostrya (hop hornbeam). At the north generally a shrub or small tree,\r\nbut becoming, in the Southern Alleghany Mountains, a tree sometimes 50\r\nfeet in height, with a trunk 2 feet to 3 feet in diameter.\" It will\r\nalmost grow in any soil or exposition in this country.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 3: IDENTIFICATION.--Carpinius caroliniana, Walter,\r\n  \"Flora Caroliniana,\" 236; C. americana, Michx. fl. bor.

Judging from\r\nthe height at which it grows, it would probably prove hardy in this\r\ncountry, and, if so, the distinct aspect and graceful habit of the\r\ntree would render it a decided acquisition. It is a moderate-sized\r\ntree, with thin gray bark, and slender, drooping warted branches. The\r\nblade of the smooth leave measures from 3 inches to 4 inches in\r\nlength, the hairy leaf-stalk being about half an inch long. It is a\r\nnative of Himalaya, where it occurs at elevations of from 5000 to 7000\r\nfeet above sea-level. As in our common hornbeam, the male catkins\r\nappear before the leaves, and the female flowers develop in spring at\r\nthe same time as the leaves. The hard, yellowish white wood--a cubic\r\nfoot of which weighs 50 lb.--is used for ordinary building purposes by\r\nthe natives of Nepaul.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 4: IDENTIFICATION.--Carpinus viminea, Lindl. in Wall.\r\n  Plant.

Its\r\nappearance is somewhat singular. It is very hard, and has a glazed\r\nappearance like that of porcelain. The color is pale green, except on\r\nthe exposed side, which is dull red. It is furrowed like a tomato, and\r\non the day after we received it the furrows opened and exposed three\r\nor four large mahogany-brown seeds embedded in hard pulp.--_The\r\nGarden._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRUIT OF CAMELLILA JAPONICA.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[SCIENCE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW RULE FOR DIVISION IN ARITHMETIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary process of long division is rather difficult, owing to\r\nthe necessity of guessing at the successive figures which form the\r\ndivisor. In case the repeating decimal expressing the _exact_ quotient\r\nis required, the following method will be found convenient:\r\n\r\n_Rule for division_.\r\n\r\n_First._ Treat the divisor as follows:\r\n\r\n  If its last figure is a 0, strike this off, and treat what is left\r\n  as the divisor.\r\n\r\n  If its last figure is a 5, multiply the whole by 2, and treat the\r\n  product as the divisor.\r\n\r\n  If its last figure is an even number, multiply the whole by 5, and\r\n  treat the product as a divisor.\r\n\r\nRepeat this treatment until these precepts cease to be applicable.\r\nCall the result the _prepared divisor_.\r\n\r\n_Second._ From the prepared divisor cut off the last figure: and, if\r\nthis be a 9, change it to a 1, or if it be a 1, change it to a 9;\r\notherwise keep it unchanged. Call this figure the _extraneous\r\nmultiplier_.\r\n\r\nMultiply the extraneous multiplier into the divisor thus truncated,\r\nand increase the product by 1, unless the extraneous multiplier be 7,\r\nwhen increase the product by 5. Call the result the _current\r\nmultiplier_.\r\n\r\n_Third._ Multiply together the extraneous multiplier and all the\r\nmultipliers used in the process of obtaining the prepared divisor. Use\r\nthe product to multiply the dividend, calling the result the _prepared\r\ndividend_.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ From the prepared dividend cut off the last figure, multiply\r\nthis by the current multiplier, and add the product to the truncated\r\ndividend. Call the sum the _modified dividend_, and treat this in the\r\nsame way. Continue this process until a modified dividend is reached\r\nwhich equals the original prepared dividend or some previous modified\r\ndividend; so that, were the process continued, the same figures would\r\nrecur.\r\n\r\n_Fifth._ Consider the series of last figures which have been\r\nsuccessively cut off from the prepared dividend and from the modified\r\ndividends as constituting a number, the figure first cut off being in\r\nthe units' place, the next in the tens' place, and so on. Call this\r\nthe _first infinite number_, because its left-hand portion consists of\r\na series of figures repeating itself indefinitely toward the left.\r\nImagine another infinite number, identical with the first in the\r\nrepeating part of the latter, but differing from this in that the same\r\nseries is repeated uninterruptedly and indefinitely toward the right\r\ninto the decimal places.\r\n\r\nSubtract the first infinite number from the second, and shift the\r\ndecimal point as many places to the left as there were zeros dropped\r\nin the process of obtaining the prepared divisor.\r\n\r\nThe result is the quotient sought.\r\n\r\n_Examples._\r\n\r\n1. The following is taken at random. Divide 1883 by 365.\r\n\r\n_First._ The divisor, since it ends in 5, must be multiplied by 2,\r\ngiving 730. Dropping the O, we have 73 for the prepared divisor.\r\n\r\n_Second._ The last figure of the prepared divisor being 3, this is the\r\nextraneous multiplier. Multiplying the truncated divisor, 7, by the\r\nextraneous multiplier, 3, and adding 1, we have 22 for the current\r\nmultiplier.\r\n\r\n_Third._ The dividend, 1883, has now to be multiplied by the product\r\nof 3, the extraneous multiplier, and 2, the multiplier used in\r\npreparing the divisor. The product, 11298, is the prepared dividend.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ From the prepared dividend, 11298, we cut off the last\r\nfigure 8, and multiply this by the current multiplier, 22.

These troubles are due to the quantity\r\nand complexity of the matter with which the mind has to be occupied at\r\nthe same time that the figures are recognized. The sums of pairs of\r\nnumbers from zero up to nine form fifty-five distinct propositions\r\nthat must be borne in memory, and the \"carrying\" is a further\r\ncomplication. The strain and consequent weariness are not only felt,\r\nbut seen, in the mistakes in addition that they cause. They are, in\r\ngreat part, the tax exacted of us by our decimal system of arithmetic.\r\nWere only quantities of the same value, in any one column, to be\r\nadded, our memory would be burdened with nothing more than the\r\nsuccession of numbers in simple counting, or that of multiples of two,\r\nthree, or four, if the counting is by groups.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to prove that the most economical way of reducing addition\r\nto counting similar quantities is by the binary arithmetic of\r\nLeibnitz, which appears in an altered dress, with most of the zero\r\nsigns suppressed, in the example below. Opposite each number in the\r\nusual figures is here set the same according to a scheme in which the\r\nsigns of powers of two repeat themselves in periods of four; a very\r\nsmall circle, like a degree mark, being used to express any fourth\r\npower in the series; a long loop, like a narrow 0, any square not a\r\nfourth power; a curve upward and to the right, like a phonographic\r\n_l_, any double fourth power; and a curve to the right and downward,\r\nlike a phonographic _r_, any half of a fourth power; with a vertical\r\nbar to denote the absence of three successive powers not fourth\r\npowers. Thus the equivalent for one million, shown in the example\r\nslightly below the middle, is 2^{16} (represented by a degree-mark in\r\nthe fifth row of these marks, counting from the right) plus 2^{17} +\r\n2^{9} (two _l_-curves in the fifth and third places of _l_-curves)\r\nplus 2^{18} + 2^{14} + 2^{6} (three loops) plus 2^{19} (the _r_-curve\r\nat the extreme left); while the absence of 2^{3}, 2^{2}, and 2^{1} is\r\nshown by the vertical stroke at the right. This equivalent expression\r\nmay be verified, if desired, either by adding the designated powers of\r\ntwo from 524,288 down to 64, or by successive multiplications by two,\r\nadding one when necessary. The form of characters here exhibited was\r\nthought to be the best of nearly three hundred that were devised and\r\nconsidered and in about sixty cases tested for economic value by\r\nactual additions.\r\n\r\nIn order to add them, the object for which these forty numbers are\r\nhere presented in two notations, it is not necessary to know just\r\n_why_ the figures on the right are equal to those on the left, or to\r\nknow anything more than the order in which the different forms are to\r\nbe taken, and the fact that any one has twice the value of one in the\r\ncolumn next succeeding it on the right. The addition may be made from\r\nthe printed page, first covering over the answer with a paper held\r\nfast by a weight, to have a place for the figures of the new answer as\r\nsuccessively obtained. The fingers will be found a great assistance,\r\nespecially if one of each hand be used, to point off similar marks in\r\ntwos, or threes, or fours--as many together as can be certainly\r\ncomprehended in a glance of the eye. Counting by fours, if it can be\r\ndone safely, is preferable because most rapid. The eye can catch the\r\nmarks for even powers more easily in going up and those for odd powers\r\n(the _l_ and _r_ curves) in going down the columns. Beginning at the\r\nlower right hand corner, we count the right hand column of small\r\ncircles, or degree marks, upward; they are twenty-three in number.\r\nHalf of twenty-three is eleven and one over; one of these marks has\r\ntherefore to be entered as part of the answer, and eleven carried to\r\nthe next column, the first one of _l_-curves. But since the curves are\r\nmost advantageously added downward, it is best, when the first column\r\nis finished, simply to remember the remainder from it, and not to set\r\ndown anything until the bottom is reached in the addition of the\r\nsecond column, when the remainders, if any, from both columns can be\r\nset down together. In this case, starting with the eleven carried and\r\ncounting the number of the _l_-curves, we find ourselves at the bottom\r\nwith twenty-four--twelve to carry, and nothing to set down except the\r\ndegree mark from the first column. With the twelve we go up the\r\nadjoining loop column, and the sum must be even, as this place is\r\nvacant in the answer; the _r_-curve column next, downward, and then\r\nanother row of degree marks. The succession must be obvious by this\r\ntime. When the last column, the one in loops to the extreme left, is\r\nadded, the sum has to be reduced to unity by successive halvings. Here\r\nwe seem to have eleven; hence we enter one loop, and carry five to the\r\nnext place, which, it must be remembered, is of _r_-curves. Halving\r\nfive we express the remainder by entering one of these curves, and\r\ncarry the quotient, two, to the degree mark place. Halving again gives\r\none in the next place, that of _l_-curves; and the work is complete.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that this work be gone over several times for\r\npractice, until the appearance and order of the characters and the\r\ndetails of the method become familiar; that, when the work can be done\r\nmechanically and without hesitation, the time occupied in a complete\r\naddition of the example, and the mistakes made in it, be carefully\r\nnoted; that this be done several times, with an interval of some days\r\nbetween the trials, and the result of each trial kept separate; that\r\nthe time and mistakes by the ordinary figures in the same example, in\r\nseveral trials, be observed for comparison. Please pay particular\r\nattention to the difference in the kind of work required by the two\r\nmethods in its bearing on two questions--which of them would be easier\r\nto work by for hours together, supposing both equally well learned?\r\nand in which of them could a reasonable degree of skill be more\r\nreadily acquired by a beginner? The answer to these questions, if the\r\ncomparison be a fair one, is as little to be doubted as is their high\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n_Example in addition by two notations_\r\n\r\n   77,823,876\r\n   14,348,907\r\n    8,654,912\r\n    5,764,801\r\n    4,635,857\r\n    1,594,323\r\n    6,417,728\r\n    4,782,969\r\n   83,886,075\r\n   34,012,224\r\n    2,903,111\r\n   48,828,125\r\n    1,724,826\r\n    7,529,536\r\n   43,344,817\r\n   10,000,000\r\n    8,334,712\r\n    1,953,125\r\n   11,308,417\r\n      759,375\r\n   21,180,840\r\n    9,765,625\r\n   18,643,788\r\n    1,000,000\r\n   44,739,243\r\n    1,889,568\r\n    2,517,471\r\n   40,353,607\r\n    4,438,414\r\n    1,679,616\r\n   23,708,715\r\n   11,890,625\r\n      945,754\r\n      823,543\r\n   15,308,805\r\n   60,466,176\r\n   30,685,377\r\n   10,077,696\r\n   19,416,381\r\n   43,046,721\r\n  ===========\r\n  740,685,681\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEight volunteer observers to whom this example has already been\r\nsubmitted showed wide difference in arithmetical skill. One of them\r\ntook but a few seconds over two minutes, in the best of six trials, to\r\nadd by the usual figures, and set down the sum, but one figure in all\r\nthe six additions being wrong; another added once in ten minutes\r\nfifty-seven seconds, and once in eleven minutes seven seconds, with\r\nhalf the figures wrong each time. The last-mentioned observer had had\r\nvery little training in arithmetical work, but perhaps that gave a\r\nfairer comparison. In the binary figures she made three additions in\r\nbetween seven and eight minutes, with but one place wrong in the\r\nthree. With four of the observers the binary notation required nearly\r\ndouble the time. These observers were all well practiced in\r\ncomputation. Their best record, five minutes eighteen seconds, was\r\nmade by one whose best record was two minutes forty seconds in\r\nordinary figures. The author's own best results were two minutes\r\nthirty-eight seconds binary, and three minutes twenty-three seconds\r\nusual. He thus proved himself inferior to the last observer, as an\r\nadder, by a system in which both were equally well trained; but a\r\ngreater familiarity (extending over a few weeks instead of a few\r\nhours) with methods in binary addition enabled him to work twice as\r\nfast with them. Of the author's nine additions by the usual figures,\r\nfour were wrong in one figure each; of his thirty-two additions by\r\ndifferent forms of binary notation, five were wrong, one of them in\r\ntwo places. One observer found that he required one minute\r\nthirty-three seconds to add a single column (average of five tried) by\r\nthe usual figures, and fifteen seconds to count the characters in one\r\n(average of six tried) by the binary. Though these additions were\r\nrather slow, the results are interesting. They show, making allowance\r\nfor the greater number of columns (three and a third times as many)\r\nrequired by the binary plan, a saving of nearly half; but they also\r\nillustrate the necessity of practice. This observer succeeded with the\r\nbinary arithmetic by avoiding the sources of delay that particularly\r\nembarrass the beginner, by contenting himself with counting only, and\r\nnot stopping to divide by two, to set down an unfamiliar character, or\r\nto recognize the mark by which he must distinguish his next column.\r\nOne well-known member of the Washington Philosophical Society and of\r\nthe American Association for the Advancement of Science, who declined\r\nthe actual trial as too severe a task, estimated his probable time\r\nwith ordinary figures at twenty minutes, with strong chances of a\r\nwrong result, after all.\r\n\r\nThese statistics prove the existence of a class of persons who can do\r\nfaster and more reliable work by the binary reckoning. But too much\r\nshould not be made of them. Let them serve as specimens of facts of\r\nwhich a great many more are to be desired, bearing on a question of\r\ngrave importance. Is it not worth our while to know, if we can, by\r\nimpartial tests, whether the tax imposed on our working brains by the\r\nsystem of arithmetic in daily use is the necessary price of a blessing\r\nenjoyed, or an oppression? If the strain produced by greater\r\ncomplexity and intensity of mental labor is compensated by a\r\ncorrespondingly greater rapidity in dealing with figures, the former\r\nmay be the case. If, on the contrary, a little practice suffices to\r\nturn the balance of rapidity, for all but a small body of highly\r\ndrilled experts, in favor of an easier system, the latter must be.\r\nThis is the question that the readers of _Science_ are invited to help\r\nin deciding. The difficulties attending a complete revolution in the\r\nprevalent system of reckoning are confessedly stupendous; but they do\r\nnot render undesirable the knowledge that experiment alone can give,\r\nwhether or not the cost of that system is unreasonably high; nor\r\nshould they prevent those who accord them the fullest recognition from\r\nassisting to furnish the necessary facts.\r\n\r\nThose who are willing to undertake the addition on the plan proposed\r\nor on any better plan, or who will submit it to such acquaintances,\r\nskilled or unskilled, as may be persuaded to take the trouble to learn\r\nthe mechanism of binary adding, will confer a great favor by informing\r\nthe writer of the time occupied, and number of mistakes made, in each\r\naddition. All observations and suggestions relating to the subject\r\nwill be most gratefully received.\r\n\r\nHenry Farquhar.\r\n\r\nOffice of U.S. Coast Survey, Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at\r\nthis office.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION, $5 A YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the\r\nUnited States or Canada.
