W. SEABROOK HULL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SEEKING ANSWERS\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorians of the future will record that man almost simultaneously\r\nunlocked the secret of atomic energy and ventured into new domains\r\nbeneath the closed doors of the world ocean, in one of the greatest\r\nexploration endeavors of all time.\r\n\r\nHistory may also show how these two efforts to benefit mankind became\r\nclosely interthreaded—how nuclear energy, in its many forms and\r\napplications, played a major role in the efforts to explore and exploit\r\n“the other three-quarters” of our planet, and moreover, how the very\r\ndevelopment of a nuclear technology enforced our need to know more about\r\nthe sea around us.\r\n\r\nNuclear energy is a fundamental physical phenomenon, like the actions of\r\nthe wheel, the lever, or the inclined plane. Like chemical combustion or\r\nelectricity, it is but another means for men to do useful work, whether\r\nthat work be in the interests of science, commerce, recreation, or war.\r\nTo this extent, nuclear energy is universal, as applicable in the sea as\r\nit is on land or in outer space. Wherever man goes and whatever he does,\r\nhe requires energy to get him there and energy for his work or play when\r\nhe arrives. Some of the places he now seeks to pioneer are hard to\r\ninvestigate by anyone encumbered with bulky traditional energy\r\nsources—coal, fuel oil, or storage batteries. The ocean in its full\r\nthree-dimensional scope is one of these places.\r\n\r\nThe atom is the most concentrated source of energy, and one of the most\r\ndiverse. Thus, not only are we able to do familiar things better with\r\nnuclear energy (the nuclear-powered submarine is a dramatic example),\r\nbut we are also able to do things never before possible (such as\r\nstudying the diffusion of dissolved salts in the open ocean or extending\r\nthe useful life of seafoods through irradiation).\r\n\r\nNuclear energy has at last enabled us to realize the predictions of\r\nJules Verne’s adventure tale, _Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea_,\r\nand to build a true submarine—a craft whose submerged existence is\r\nlimited only by the physiological and psychological endurance of its\r\nhuman crew. This fact in itself has added greatly to our need to learn\r\nmuch more about the ocean, for the sea is an opaque and strange\r\nenvironment in which the deadly game of hunt-and-be-hunted will be won\r\nby whoever knows the ocean best.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that we have nuclear energy means we have nuclear wastes;\r\nmany of these inevitably find their way into the ocean, as all things\r\ndo. We need to know more about the watery world before we can safely\r\nallow this inflow to continue.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _In 1900 the U. S. Navy commissioned its first\r\n    submarine, the USS_ Holland, _which was built by John P. Holland. It\r\n    is shown in dry dock at Perth Amboy, New Jersey, in 1898._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The USS_ Plunger, _named after an early John Holland\r\n    submarine, which is an example of the Navy’s present fleet of\r\n    nuclear submarines._]\r\n\r\nIn the waters of the seven seas are enough deuterium and tritium to\r\npower tomorrow’s thermonuclear power plants[1] for millions of years.\r\nThese rare, heavy varieties of hydrogen, enormously abundant in the\r\nvastness of the sea, comprise an energy source without limit for all\r\nnations, which need only develop the technological ability to extract\r\nthem and put them to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnergy for Exploration\r\n\r\nFor this exploration, men need to put instruments, navigation beacons\r\n(see figures on pages 46 and 47), and other devices on the deep ocean\r\nfloor, where they must operate for long periods of time unattended and\r\nwith no external source of power. Radioisotope-powered generators,\r\ncapitalizing on the energy of disintegrating radioactive atoms, are\r\nalmost the only devices capable of fulfilling these requirements.[2] Man\r\nalso wants to do productive work under the ocean, such as drilling\r\nseafloor oil wells, mining, and salvaging for profit some of the tens of\r\nthousands of cargoes lost at sea during thousands of years of ocean\r\ncommerce. Eventually, he even wants to farm the ocean floor.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _An artist draws (using pencil and frosted plastic\r\n    sheet) the position of objects in the wreck of a 7th century\r\n    Byzantine ship 120 feet down in the Aegean Sea. Nuclear power will\r\n    permit historians of the future to remain underwater for long\r\n    periods exploring shipwrecks or old cities far below the surface._]\r\n\r\nAll these activities require energy—energy in an environment where most\r\nsources cannot be applied. Above all, man wants to go down himself to\r\nexplore, to work, and perhaps to direct nuclear-powered robots to do\r\neven more work. This means that small, manned, nonmilitary submersibles\r\nwill be needed—vessels whose endurance should not be limited by the\r\nshort life of traditional power sources, but should draw on the\r\nfissioning atomic nucleus, harnessed in small reactors.[3]\r\n\r\nTo work effectively in any environment, we must first know and\r\nunderstand it. This is the job of science. In the quest for knowledge\r\nand understanding of the ocean, nuclear energy provides scientists with\r\nbetter instruments to put down into the depths and wholly new techniques\r\nfor the direct study of the many oceanic processes.\r\n\r\nFor example, take the role of radioisotope tracers: For the first time,\r\nthese telltale atoms permit us to study the metabolism of tiny\r\nplankters, the often microscopic drifting creatures of the sea that in\r\ntheir incredible abundance form the base of the entire marine food\r\nchain, including fish eaten by humans. Even fallout isotopes from\r\nnuclear tests enable us to trace important physical oceanographic\r\nevents, such as the ponderous process known as overturning, which\r\ntransports oxygen-rich surface water to the deeps and nutrient-rich\r\nbottom water to the surface. Radioisotope tracers also provide a tool\r\nfor studying the mechanics of littoral transport, which continually\r\ntears down some beaches and builds up others. They also enable us to\r\ndetermine if oceanic processes are likely to concentrate fallout\r\nparticles and deliver them in dangerous doses through the food chain to\r\nour dinner tables.[4]\r\n\r\nBy using other nuclear energy technology, we are better able to\r\nascertain the age and composition of deep ocean sediments and the rate\r\nat which they are deposited, how a tsunami (tidal wave) propagates\r\nacross vast distances, how tides operate in the open ocean, where the\r\nbrown shrimp of the Carolina coast go every fall, and the migration\r\npatterns of tuna, swordfish, and other valuable food fish.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Navy men preparing for undersea research by feeding\r\n    Tuffy, a friendly porpoise, which later carried messages for them\r\n    during the “Man-In-The-Sea” experiment._ (_Also see photos on page\r\n    12._)]\r\n\r\nThese are just a few of the answers we seek from the world ocean—answers\r\nimportant for more productive fisheries, more accurate long-range\r\nweather forecasting, possible control of hurricanes and typhoons,\r\npollution control, safer and more economical shipping, better\r\nrecreation, and numerous other matters that bear on our health,\r\nwell-being, and day-to-day lives.\r\n\r\nOn all these endeavors the ocean exerts a major influence. And in each,\r\natomic energy is helping assemble and interpret answers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE WORLD OCEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nBut what of this environment into which, armed with the atom, we plunge\r\nwith such enthusiasm and expectations? A portrait is in order, which\r\nmust be brief, for not all the books ever written about the sea have yet\r\ndescribed it fully.\r\n\r\nThe world ocean covers 70.8% of our planet. It contains 324,000,000\r\ncubic miles of seawater. Living in it are upwards of a million different\r\nspecies of plants and animals. They range from one-celled organisms that\r\ncan only be seen with a microscope to the largest creature ever to have\r\nlived on this earth—the giant blue (or sulfur-bottom) whale, captured\r\nspecimens of which have exceeded 90 feet in length and 100 tons in\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThe ocean’s depth ranges from 600 feet or less above continental shelves\r\nto more than 35,000 feet at the Marianas Trench. The mean depth is\r\n12,451 feet. Sea bottom topography includes wide plains, the world’s\r\nlongest mountain range, steeply rising individual truncated peaks called\r\n_guyots_ (pronounced gee-ohs), gentle slopes, narrow canyons, and\r\nprecipitous escarpments. Mountains higher than Everest rise from the\r\nocean floor and never pierce the surface.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Underwater mountain traced by the Woods Hole\r\n    Oceanographic Institution echo sounder in the Caribbean area. Depth\r\n    is determined by the time it takes the sound emitted by the\r\n    instrument to go to the bottom and return to the surface._]\r\n\r\n\r\nOcean Movements\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Six ships checking the Gulf Stream’s course through\r\n    the Atlantic Ocean over a 2-week period found the variations shown\r\n    above._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The infrared film photograph shows the edge of the\r\n    Gulf Stream. The visible line between the Gulf Stream, which is on\r\n    the right, and Labrador water is made by Sargassum weed concentrated\r\n    at the interface._]\r\n\r\nThe ocean is constantly in motion—not just in the waves and tides that\r\ncharacterize its surface but in great currents that swirl between\r\ncontinents, moving (among other things) great quantities of heat from\r\none part of the world to another. Beneath these surface currents are\r\nothers, deeply hidden, that flow as often as not in an entirely\r\ndifferent direction from the surface course.\r\n\r\nThese enormous “rivers”—quite unconstant, sometimes shifting, often\r\nbranching and eddying in a manner that defies explanation and\r\nprediction—occasionally create disastrous results. One example is El\r\nNiño, the periodic catastrophe that plagues the west coast of South\r\nAmerica. This coast normally is caressed by the cold, rich Humboldt\r\nCurrent. Usually the Humboldt hugs the shore and extends 200 to 300\r\nmiles out to sea. It is rich in life. It fosters the largest commercial\r\nfishery in the world and is the home of one of the mightiest game fish\r\non record, the black marlin. The droppings of marine birds that feed\r\nfrom its waters are responsible for the fertilizer (guano) exports that\r\nundergird the Chilean, Peruvian, and Ecuadorian economies.\r\n\r\nEvery few years, however, the Humboldt disappears. It moves out from\r\nshore or simply sinks, and a flow of warm, exhausted surface water known\r\nas El Niño takes its place. Simultaneously, torrential rains assault the\r\ncoast. Fishes and birds die by the millions. Commercial fisheries are\r\nclosed. The beaches reek with death. El Niño is a stark demonstration of\r\nman’s dependence on the sea and why he must learn more about it.\r\n\r\nThere are other motions in the restless sea. The water masses are\r\nconstantly “turning over” in a cycle that may take hundreds of years,\r\nyet is essential to bring oxygen down to the creatures of the deeps, and\r\nnutrients (fertilizers) up from the sea floor to the surface. Here the\r\nfloating phytoplankton (the plants of the sea) build through\r\nphotosynthesis the organic material that will start the nutrient cycle\r\nall over again. Enormous tonnages of these tiny sea plants, rather than\r\nbeing rooted in the soil, are separated from solid earth by up to\r\nseveral vertical miles of saltwater. Sometimes, too, there is a more\r\nrapid surge of deep water to the surface, a process known as upwelling.\r\n\r\nInternal waves, far below the surface, develop between water masses that\r\nhave different densities and between which there is relative motion.\r\nThese waves are much like the wind-driven waves on the surface, though\r\nmuch bigger: Internal waves may have heights of 300 feet or more and be\r\n6 miles or more in length!\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _A dividing cell of the diatom_ Corethron hystrix.\r\n    _Diatoms, one-celled photosynthetic plants, are the primary\r\n    producers of organic matter in fresh waters._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Ocean currents feed sand from nearby beaches into\r\n    this “sandfall”, which is about 30 feet high, in a submarine canyon\r\n    off Baja California._]\r\n\r\nAmong other motions of the sea there are landslides, or turbidity\r\ncurrents, which are great boiling mixes of mud, rock, sand, and water\r\nrushing down submarine mountainsides at speeds of a mile a minute. They\r\ndestroy everything in their paths and spread clouds of debris over the\r\nabyssal plains like a sandstorm, producing fanlike deposits radiating\r\nfar out from the base of the slope. And there are tsunamis, or seismic\r\nsea waves—popularly misnamed “tidal waves”—that transmit energy from\r\nundersea earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. At sea, these waves are only\r\na few inches high, but they may travel great distances at 500 miles an\r\nhour. As they approach the shoaling waters of a coast, they are slowed\r\nto about 30 miles an hour and build up great surface waves capable of\r\ndestroying harbor and coastal installations.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Mix of Elements\r\n\r\nThe sea is a chemistry, too. Over 60 elements have been discovered in\r\nmeasurable amounts in solution or in suspension in the ocean. Many of\r\nthese are in the form of salts, making seawater a highly efficient\r\nelectrolyte, and a most corrosive fluid. The study of corrosion and\r\ntechniques for combatting it is a continuous one in which nuclear energy\r\nalready has a principal role.\r\n\r\nBecause the sea is so much a chemistry, it is a potential source of\r\nminerals for the world’s growing industrial appetite. All of our\r\nmagnesium and most of our bromine already are extracted directly from\r\nseawater. Oil and sulfur are mined from the sea floor or beneath it, as\r\nare coal (United Kingdom and Japan), iron ore (Japan), tin (Thailand and\r\nUnited Kingdom), diamonds (Southwest Africa), and gold (Alaska). In the\r\nlayered sediments that cover the ocean-basin floors to depths of\r\nthousands of feet, geologists believe there also may be found some\r\nmissing chapters of earth history.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Nodules such as these containing manganese cover\r\n    millions of undersea acres on the ocean floor. Many nodules are rich\r\n    in nickel, cobalt, zirconium, and copper. Metallurgists are seeking\r\n    ways to recover the metals from these deposits._]\r\n\r\nThe ocean, by and large, is an opaque fluid through which light travels\r\nonly a few hundred feet and most other radiant energy not much more than\r\na few yards; yet through this same fluid, sound waves, by contrast, have\r\nbeen transmitted and received over distances of many thousand miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sea’s Interfaces\r\n\r\nWhat of the interfaces of the sea? Above three-quarters of the globe,\r\nwater and air are in constant contact, continually exchanging heat and\r\nmoisture. This is a major factor in the making of weather and climate.\r\nThe sea constantly feeds electricity into the atmosphere, primarily\r\nthrough the electron-scrubbing action of tiny popping bubbles at the sea\r\nsurface. It also lifts tiny crystals of salt and the remains of\r\nmicroscopic sea creatures into the air. Perhaps these are the nuclei on\r\nwhich moisture condenses to trigger hurricanes, since it is the latent\r\nheat of vaporization of air, made over-moist by long travel over the\r\ntropical sea, that provides a hurricane’s energy.\r\n\r\nAlong its land edges, the sea is constantly working on the\r\nshore—sometimes gently, sometimes violently—breaking down rock cliffs,\r\nopening bays and harbors, closing channels and inlets, smashing\r\nbreakwaters and seawalls, and moving sand up and down and to and from\r\nbeaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sea’s Resources\r\n\r\nIn summary, then, the ocean, the largest single geographical feature of\r\nour planet, is infinitely varied and infinitely complex. We are learning\r\nit bears on our day-to-day living in ways we never suspected. It is the\r\nlargest resource of food for our exploding population, the largest\r\nresource of minerals with which to support the world’s burgeoning\r\nindustries, the largest resource of energy, and, of course, it is the\r\nlargest supply of water. It is mankind’s largest dumping ground for the\r\nwastes of cities and industries. It is the source of much pleasure and\r\nrecreation.\r\n\r\nMen already have lived experimentally for weeks at a time on the bottom\r\nof the ocean. Both sea floor laboratories and military bases are being\r\nplanned or, in a few cases, installed. Sea floor mining complexes are in\r\nthe conceptual design stage. It is only a matter of time before\r\nrecreational “aquotels” are built safely below the sea’s restless\r\nsurface. Private sports submarines are an actual, though costly,\r\nreality. It is not inconceivable that in the not-too-distant future\r\nhuman beings may overflow the land into complete, self-sufficient\r\ncommunities below the oceans.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _In 1965 the U. S. Navy conducted a 45-day experiment\r\n    in its “Man-In-The-Sea” program in which 10 aquanauts lived and\r\n    worked 205 feet below the surface of the sea off La Jolla,\r\n    California. Their undersea base was Sealab II shown at her\r\n    christening._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Sealab II shown during final checkout before\r\n    descent. The aquanauts conducted experimental salvage operations,\r\n    marine research, and underwent a series of physiological and human\r\n    performance tests._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NUCLEAR ENERGY’S ROLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe role of nuclear energy in the study, exploration, and utilization of\r\nthe world ocean is best defined by citing the specific oceanographic\r\ninterests of the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC): Development of\r\nbetter instruments and devices for work and study in the ocean,\r\ndevelopment of ever-stronger national sea power, conversion of seawater\r\nto fresh water, possible modification of ocean boundaries, purely\r\nscientific studies to advance knowledge, and, indirectly at least,\r\nimproving the state of oceanographic engineering. Among the\r\ntechnological products of the nuclear age are radionuclides, neutron\r\nsources and other radiation sources, radioisotope heat and electric\r\ngenerators, and nuclear reactors. All these are applied to ocean-related\r\nendeavors.\r\n\r\nSeveral divisions of the AEC have important oceanic interests. These\r\nrange from pure oceanographic research to development of specific\r\ninstruments, nuclear reactors, radioisotopic power sources, and other\r\ndevices for use in or under the ocean.

Just how much\r\nradiation is introduced? In what form? Where geographically? How are\r\nthese radionuclides dispersed or concentrated physically, chemically,\r\nbiologically, and geologically? What is the net result in each case now,\r\nand what will it be many years hence?\r\n\r\nThese questions are not answered easily. There is, as yet, no\r\nsatisfactory laboratory substitute for the open ocean. Research for the\r\nmost part must be conducted at sea, where tests and measurements are\r\ndifficult at best, and where results therefore are often suspect.\r\nFurther, if we are to study the effects of man-induced changes in a\r\nnatural environment, it would have been advantageous to have known the\r\nnature of that environment before the changes were introduced—which, by\r\nand large, in the case of the ocean we do not. So we must start with a\r\ncontaminated environment and try to separate what we have put there\r\nourselves from what would have been there anyway. It isn’t an easy task\r\nto make the physical and biological observations that will make this\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\n   Table II CONCENTRATION AND AMOUNTS OF 42 OF THE ELEMENTS IN SEAWATER\r\n    Element     Concentration   Amount of element in    Total amount in\r\n                   (mg/l)       seawater (tons mile³)  the oceans (tons)\r\n\r\n  Chlorine     19,000.0        89.5 × 10⁶                    29.3 × 10¹⁵\r\n  Sodium       10,500.0        49.5 x-10⁶                    16.3 × 10¹⁵\r\n  Magnesium    1,350.0         6.4 × 10⁶                      2.1 × 10¹⁵\r\n  Sulphur      885.0           4.2 × 10⁶                      1.4 × 10¹⁵\r\n  Calcium      400.0           1.9 × 10⁶                      0.6 × 10¹⁵\r\n  Potassium    380.0           1.8 × 10⁶                      0.6 × 10¹⁵\r\n  Bromine      65.0            306,000                        0.1 × 10¹⁵\r\n  Carbon       28.0            132,000                       0.04 × 10¹⁵\r\n  Strontium    8.0             38,000                       12,000 × 10⁹\r\n  Boron        4.6             23,000                        7,100 × 10⁹\r\n  Silicon      3.0             14,000                        4,700 × 10⁹\r\n  Lithium      0.17            800                             260 × 10⁹\r\n  Rubidium     0.12            570                             190 × 10⁹\r\n  Phosphorus   0.07            330                             110 × 10⁹\r\n  Iodine       0.06            280                              93 × 10⁹\r\n  Barium       0.03            140                              47 × 10⁹\r\n  Indium       0.02            94                               31 × 10⁹\r\n  Zinc         0.01            47                               16 × 10⁹\r\n  Iron         0.01            47                               16 × 10⁹\r\n  Aluminum     0.01            47                               16 × 10⁹\r\n  Molybdenum   0.01            47                               16 × 10⁹\r\n  Selenium     0.004           19                                6 × 10⁹\r\n  Tin          0.003           14                                5 × 10⁹\r\n  Copper       0.003           14                                5 × 10⁹\r\n  Arsenic      0.003           14                                5 × 10⁹\r\n  Uranium      0.003           14                                5 × 10⁹\r\n  Nickel       0.002           9                                 3 × 10⁹\r\n  Vanadium     0.002           9                                 3 × 10⁹\r\n  Manganese    0.002           9                                 3 × 10⁹\r\n  Antimony     0.0005          2                               0.8 × 10⁹\r\n  Cobalt       0.0005          2                               0.8 × 10⁹\r\n  Caesium      0.0005          2                               0.8 × 10⁹\r\n  Cerium       0.0004          2                               0.6 × 10⁹\r\n  Silver       0.0003          1                                 5 × 10⁸\r\n  Cadmium      0.0001          0.5                             150 × 10⁶\r\n  Tungsten     0.0001          0.5                             150 × 10⁶\r\n  Chromium     0.00005         0.2                              78 × 10⁶\r\n  Thorium      0.00005         0.2                              78 × 10⁶\r\n  Lead         0.00003         0.1                              46 × 10⁶\r\n  Mercury      0.00003         0.1                              46 × 10⁶\r\n  Gold         0.000004        0.02                              6 × 10⁶\r\n  Radium       1 × 10⁻¹⁰       5 × 10⁻⁷                              150\r\n\r\n  Adapted from _The Mineral Resources of the Sea_, by John L. Mero,\r\n  American Elsevier Publishing Company, New York, 1964.\r\n\r\nMany sea creatures are efficient, selective concentrators of “trace\r\nelements”, which occur in seawater only in minute portions. These\r\nelements are difficult enough to detect qualitatively and all but\r\nimpossible to analyze quantitatively. Yet among the elements the sea’s\r\nplants and animals concentrate are the very materials with which we are\r\napt to be most concerned: Strontium, cesium, cerium, ruthenium, cobalt,\r\niodine, phosphorus, zinc, manganese, iron, chromium, and others.\r\nRadioisotopes[6] of all these elements occur as by-products of human\r\nnuclear activities. Many concentrating organisms are microscopic in size\r\nand are frequently impossible to raise in captivity. It is apparent that\r\nwe are faced with a research program of considerable challenge and\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nWe need to know _how_ each marine species concentrates. Is it from the\r\nfood it eats, by absorption from the water, or both? Does it concentrate\r\nan element by continuous accumulation, or is there a constant turnover\r\nof the material in the organism’s system? (In the first case, once the\r\ncreature became radioactive it would remain so throughout its life or\r\nuntil the radioactivity decayed. In the second case, however, the\r\nradioactivity might be a transient condition, assuming the creature\r\ncould find its way into uncontaminated water and were able to flush\r\nitself.) Obviously, both the cycling time of the radioisotope in the\r\norganism and its radioactive half-life[7] must be taken into account.\r\n\r\nEven if we should manage to identify all the marine concentrators and\r\ngain some insight into their metabolic processes, this would be only a\r\nfirst step. For example, one tiny form of planktonic protozoan,\r\n_acantharia_, concentrates up to 15% of its own weight of strontium,\r\nincluding the radioisotope strontium-90. It is eaten by larger\r\nzooplankton (animals), such as copepods, which are eaten by little fish,\r\nwhich, in turn, are eaten by bigger fish, etc. Somewhere along this food\r\nchain, perhaps, a fish will come along that is favored for human dinner\r\ntables. How much strontium-90 has _that_ fish accumulated through\r\nswallowing its prey and by absorption from the water? Is the\r\nradioactivity in its scales, bones, viscera, and other usually uneaten\r\nportions, or in its flesh?\r\n\r\nIt is probable, though as yet by no means proven, that among the million\r\nor so oceanic species of plant and animal life, there are concentrators\r\nof virtually all the 60 or more elements found in seawater. To identify\r\nand study them is an enormous undertaking, which is often possible only\r\nby using radioisotopes as tools.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the immediate and genetic effects of radiation on each\r\nspecies? Studies of reef fish in the nuclear testing area in the\r\nMarshall Islands have shown that radioiodine in the water caused thyroid\r\ngland damage long after the amount of radioiodine remaining in the water\r\nwas too low to be detected. Studies of salmon in the Columbia River have\r\nshown some physiological variations between those fish whose eggs and\r\nyoung were reared in radioactive waters and those that were not, though\r\nthese variations have not been determined to be statistically\r\nsignificant or different from variations caused by other contaminants.\r\n\r\nStudies are being made of the reproductive efficiency and patterns of\r\nsea creatures in a radiation-contaminated environment, compared with\r\nthose in an uncontaminated environment, to learn such things as the\r\nnumbers, survival rates, and sex ratios of the offspring, and any\r\ngenetic abnormalities or mutations. Many more studies are needed.\r\nAlways, the task is made difficult by insufficient detailed knowledge of\r\nthe original natural environment, the limitations of laboratory\r\nexperiments, and the mechanics of trying to follow the reproductive\r\ncycles of free-floating or swimming organisms in any statistically\r\nmeaningful manner through successive generations.\r\n\r\nOne obviously important kind of research deals with the rate, pattern,\r\nand means by which radionuclides are distributed into the sea from a\r\npoint source, such as the mouth of a river or a nuclear test site.\r\nTransport and diffusion of radioactivity can be, and are, influenced by\r\nphysical, chemical, biological, or geological means, separately or all\r\nat once. This has led the AEC to support scientific studies of currents,\r\nupwelling, downwelling, convergence, diffusion, mixing rates, air-sea\r\ninteractions, chemical and geological processes in the sea, and the\r\nhorizontal and vertical migrations of sea life.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _This sound instrument record reveals the layers of\r\n    planktonic sound scatterers on the continental slope east of New\r\n    England. Each peak originates from an individual group of\r\n    organisms._]\r\n\r\nIn much of the ocean there is an acoustic “floor”, known as the _deep\r\nscattering layer_ (because of what it does to sound waves), which is\r\nbelieved to consist primarily of zooplankton. Every 24 hours the layer\r\nmigrates up and down through several hundred feet of water. At night the\r\ncountless small animals graze in the rich sea-plant pastures near the\r\nsurface; during daylight, back at the lower level, they undoubtedly are\r\nheavily fed upon by larger animals. Over a period of time, the layer\r\naccounts for considerable vertical transport of materials. (See figure\r\nabove.) Other life forms may move materials still farther down, or, in\r\nsome instances, back up—as when the sperm whale descends to the depths\r\nto fight and best a giant squid, and then returns to the surface to eat\r\nit.\r\n\r\nConstantly drifting downward is a great volume of material—the dead\r\nbodies, skeletons, excrement, and other waste from sea life at all\r\ndepths. As it sinks there is a constant exchange of matter between it\r\nand the surrounding water through chemical, physical, and biological\r\nprocesses. Eventually, the molecules of material added to the bottom\r\nsediments may be returned to the water mass by bacteriological action or\r\nthe eating and living habits of sea floor animals.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _A school of skipjack tuna photographed from an\r\n    underwater observation chamber on the research vessel_ Charles H.\r\n    Gilbert.]\r\n\r\nBiological transport works in other ways, too. Most pelagic\r\n(free-swimming) fish are great travelers. They account for a tremendous\r\nmovement of material, namely themselves, from one place to another.\r\nTuna, swordfish, whales, porpoises, and sea birds may travel thousands\r\nof miles in a single year. Such migrations may serve, variously, as\r\nmechanisms for either dispersal or concentration of elements or\r\nnutrients. The anadromous (river-ascending) fishes, such as salmon,\r\nherring, sturgeon, and shad, concentrate in freshwater streams in untold\r\nnumbers to spawn. After hatching, the young seek the ocean and scatter\r\nwidely until they, too, feel the urge to return to the rivers and lakes\r\nwhence they came, to spawn and die there as did their ancestors.\r\n\r\nOcean currents may transport concentrations of radionuclides essentially\r\nundiluted for thousands of miles. Surface currents move at speeds of up\r\nto five knots (nautical miles per hour). Normally current waters do not\r\nmix readily with the water mass through which they pass. Because of the\r\nslowness of vertical circulation in the ocean, radionuclides deposited\r\non the surface of the ocean may take a thousand years to reach the\r\nbottom. But the vertical transport sometimes is much more rapid: When\r\nthe wind piles too much water against a coastline, the resultant\r\ndownwelling (sinking) may move radionuclides suddenly into the deeper\r\nocean. Or, conversely, when the wind and the rotation of the earth\r\ncombine to force the surface water _away_ from the coast, deep water may\r\nsuddenly rise to replace it, a process known as upwelling.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Mechanisms of nutrient turnover in the sea._]\r\n\r\n    Light energy\r\n    Dissolved gases\r\n    Birds and man\r\n    Rivers and ice\r\n    Wave action\r\n  Surface mixed layer 20-100m\r\n    Suspended matter\r\n    Elements in true solution\r\n    Plants phytoplankton\r\n    Animals\r\n  Deep water\r\n    Elements in true solution in deep water\r\n  Buried in sediment\r\n  Physical Processes\r\n    _Transport by wind_\r\n    _Transport by current_\r\n    _Turbulent mixing_\r\n    _Sedimentation_\r\n    _Transport_ by animals\r\n    _Volcanic action_\r\n    _Diffusion_\r\n  Chemical or Biological Processes\r\n    _Photosynthesis_\r\n    _Dissolving_\r\n    _Upwelling_\r\n    _Decomposition and respiration_\r\n    _Sorption_ by sediment surface\r\n    _Redissolving_ from sediment\r\n    _Chemical precipitation_\r\n  Combined Processes\r\n    _Sedimentation and decomposition_ by bacteria\r\n    _Scavenging_\r\n\r\nSome recent evidence indicates that the passage of a hurricane across\r\nthe ocean drives surface water out from the storm center in all\r\ndirections. This, too, produces upwelling. If radionuclides fall on the\r\nArctic ice pack or on the Greenland or Antarctic ice caps, it may be\r\nyears before they are released to the sea. In more or less stable\r\nconditions at sea, radionuclides may remain trapped above the\r\nthermocline (a layer of sharp temperature change usually less than 100\r\nmeters below the surface) for a considerable period. Then a severe storm\r\nmay destroy the thermocline and mix the waters to much greater depths.\r\nThe process of diffusion in the ocean is not well understood, due both\r\nto the difficulty of the measurements that have to be made and to the\r\nvariety of other factors affecting both vertical and horizontal\r\ntransport of materials. Here again, however, the existence of\r\nradionuclides, introduced artificially at a known time and place, is\r\nmaterially aiding these investigations by making a particular water mass\r\ndetectable and traceable.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Winds of 100 knots (about 115 mph) whip high waves\r\n    in the Caribbean Sea east of Guadeloupe Island during a hurricane._]\r\n\r\nIn chemical oceanography, the AEC is concerned with the fact that in\r\nsome instances our society is introducing elements, ions, and compounds\r\nthat have not been naturally found in the sea, as well as natural\r\nmaterials in greater concentration than is normal. These may combine\r\nwith other materials in the sea, changing into new forms or substances,\r\nor removing them from solution entirely. Any change in the chemical\r\ncomposition of the ocean is quite likely to have biological effects,\r\nsome of which may prove detrimental to man.\r\n\r\nA disturbance of the chemical balance of the sea is thought to be\r\nresponsible, at least in part, for the periodic, disastrous plankton\r\n“blooms” known as “red tides”. Such a sudden, explosive overpopulation\r\nof plankton is a natural phenomenon, but one that can be triggered by\r\nman-made pollution. When it occurs, plankton multiply so rapidly that\r\nthe oxygen in the water is depleted and many fish die from suffocation.\r\n\r\nFortunately, nuclear energy operations account for an extremely small\r\nportion of the chemical contamination of the sea, when contrasted with\r\nthe tremendous volume of poisons dumped daily into it in the form of\r\nother industrial and municipal waste and agricultural pesticides.\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch Projects\r\n\r\nThe AEC supports oceanographic research conducted by its own\r\nlaboratories and by other federal agencies, as well as by non-government\r\nresearch scientists. The Environmental Sciences Branch of the Division\r\nof Biology and Medicine has begun the long and complex task of\r\nunraveling the mystery of the fate of radionuclides in the ocean.\r\nValuable techniques have been developed for the intentional injection of\r\nradioisotopes into the sea for specific research. Scientists are now\r\nable to conduct investigations that were never before possible. In some\r\ninstances, traditional scientific concepts and theories have been\r\nshattered, or at least severely shaken, by new evidence gathered by\r\nradioisotope techniques.\r\n\r\nSince 70% of the earth’s surface is water, at least 70% of the\r\nradioactive debris lofted into the stratosphere during atmospheric\r\nnuclear weapons tests falls into the ocean. An additional small\r\nproportion finds its way into the sea as the run-off from the land. In\r\nthe case of tests at sea, the majority of radiation immediately falls\r\ninto the water nearby. For this reason, the ocean around the sites in\r\nthe Marshall Islands where U. S. tests were conducted has provided a\r\nunique opportunity to study the effect of large concentrations of\r\nradionuclides. Particularly significant studies have been conducted of\r\nthe absorption of radionuclides by plants and animals living on nearby\r\nreefs and islands, and of both lateral and vertical diffusion rates of\r\nelements in the open ocean.[8]\r\n\r\nThe 1954 nuclear test at Eniwetok Atoll produced heavier-than-expected\r\nlocal radioactive fallout. Since then, both American and Japanese\r\nscientists have studied water-mass movement rates, using the fallout\r\nradionuclides strontium-90 and cesium-137 themselves as tracer elements.\r\nThese nuclides produced in the test have been detected at depths down to\r\n7000 meters in the far northwestern Pacific in the vicinity of Japan.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Autoradiograph of a plankton sample collected from a\r\n    Pacific lagoon a week after a 1952 nuclear test, showing\r\n    concentration of radioisotopes (bright areas)._]\r\n\r\nIf this results from simple eddy diffusion, as some scientists believe,\r\nit is a case of diffusion at a very high rate. Other scientists suggest\r\nthat other factors may have contributed to the vertical transport of the\r\nradionuclides to these depths. Still others believe that the\r\nstrontium-90 and cesium-137 might not have originated with the U. S.\r\nPacific tests at all, but rather with Russian tests in the Arctic taking\r\nplace at about the same time. They propose the theory that a syphoning\r\neffect in the Bering Strait causes a current to flow out of the Arctic\r\nOcean and down under the surface waters of the western Pacific. In\r\nsupport of this, Japanese researchers cite a dissolved oxygen content\r\nwhere these measurements were made that is different from that of other\r\ndeep water in the area. If this theory should be proved correct, it\r\nwould be the first indication that such a current exists.\r\n\r\nSimilar investigations have been conducted of the variations in depth of\r\nstrontium-90 concentration in the Atlantic Ocean. In February 1962, when\r\nfallout from 1961 nuclear tests was high, tests south of Greenland\r\nshowed that mixing of fallout was fairly rapid through the top 800\r\nmeters of water. At greater depths a colder, saltier layer of water\r\ncontained only about half as much strontium-90, confirming other\r\nevidence that interchange between water masses of different physical and\r\nchemical properties is comparatively low.\r\n\r\nWork such as this has emphasized the difficulty in making meaningful\r\nmeasurements of man-made radiation in the ocean. One problem is to\r\nseparate the artificially produced radiation from the natural radiation,\r\nnamely that from potassium-40 (which accounts for 97% of oceanic\r\nradiation) and from the radionuclides, such as tritium, carbon-14,\r\nberyllium-7, beryllium-10, aluminum-26, and silicon-32, created in the\r\nstratosphere naturally by cosmic-ray bombardment.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _In 1955 a scientific team aboard the U. S. Coast\r\n    Guard vessel_ Roger B. Taney _conducted a survey of ocean fallout in\r\n    the western Pacific. They collected marine organisms and water\r\n    samples at various depths on their 17,500-mile, 7-week journey._]\r\n\r\nAnother problem is the sheer physical size of the water sample required\r\nto get any measurements at all. Up to now there has been no truly\r\neffective radiation counter that can be lowered over the side of a ship\r\nto the desired depth. It is often necessary to collect a sample of many\r\ngallons at great depths and return it to the surface without its being\r\nmixed by any of the intervening water. This is difficult at best, and\r\nonly rather primitive methods have been developed. None is more than\r\npartly satisfactory. A standard system is to lower a large, collapsed\r\npolyethylene bag to the desired depth, open it, fill it, and close it\r\nagain, all by remote control, and then gingerly and hopefully return it\r\nto the surface. Results do not always agree among samples taken at the\r\nsame location by different methods or by different scientists. There is\r\nstill no universal agreement among scientists as to the quantitative\r\nvalidity of any of the measurements, although as more and better data\r\nare gathered there tends to be a greater concurrence.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Fifty-gallon sampler ready to be lowered over the\r\n    side of the research vessel_ Atlantis II _in the North Atlantic.\r\n    Such devices are used to obtain samples at fixed intervals from the\r\n    sea surface to the bottom. The water is analyzed for radioisotope\r\n    content._]\r\n\r\nRecently, under an AEC contract, a detector for direct measurements of\r\ngamma radiation[9] in the deep ocean was developed for the Institute of\r\nMarine Sciences, University of Miami, by the Franklin GNO Corp. (See\r\nfigure above.) This unit incorporates two of the largest plastic\r\nscintillation counters[10] ever used in the ocean—each is 16 inches in\r\ndiameter by 12 inches thick. This apparatus may permit direct\r\nqualitative and quantitative measurement of radiation at great depths by\r\ntechniques that will be eminently more satisfactory than water sampling.\r\nAlready tests with the detector have disclosed the existence of\r\ncosmic-ray effects at much greater depths than heretofore known.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Scintillation counter for use in the deep ocean._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Constituent parts. The plastic discs are the\r\n    radiation detectors._]\r\n\r\nBiologists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts\r\nfor the first time have been able to measure the rate of excretion of\r\nphysiologically important fallout radionuclides by several species of\r\nzooplankton—_pteropods_, _pyrasomes_, _copepods_, and _euphausids_.\r\nRadioactive zinc and iodine, it was learned, are excreted as soluble\r\nions, while iron and manganese appear as solid particles. However, the\r\nextent to which the intake and excretion of radionuclides and the\r\nvertical migration of zooplankton contribute quantitatively to the\r\ntransport of radioactivity across the thermocline (and into the ocean\r\ndeeps) still can only be guessed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Zooplankton, mostly copepods, collected with\r\n    automatic underwater sampling equipment on board the nuclear\r\n    submarine_ Seadragon _while cruising under the Arctic ice_.]\r\n\r\nOther plankton research at Woods Hole uses radioactive carbon-14 and\r\nphosphorus-32 as tracers to evaluate rates of growth and nutrient\r\nassimilation by algae (floating green plants). These investigations have\r\nrevealed that the presence or absence of minute quantities of nutrient\r\nminerals in seawater affects the rate at which the algae produce oxygen\r\nby the process of photosynthesis. Since the energy of all living\r\nthings—including man—is also made available by photosynthesis, and since\r\nmost of the photosynthesis on earth is performed by algae afloat in the\r\noceans, it is apparent that this research is of more than academic\r\ninterest. Algae, the original energy-fixers of the “meadows of the sea”,\r\nare also the original food source for the billions of aquatic animals,\r\nand may some day prove a source of food for a mushrooming human\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn a project with more immediate application, extensive biological and\r\nenvironmental studies of the Eniwetok Atoll area in the Pacific were\r\nconducted prior to the first nuclear testing there in 1948, and these\r\nstudies have continued ever since. Early in the test series the\r\nJapanese, who were at first concerned with the possible contamination of\r\ntheir traditional marine food supplies, were invited to participate in\r\nthese studies. Fisheries radiological monitoring installations were\r\nestablished in Japan and the U. S. (The latter was established by the\r\nAEC and administered by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration.) Neither\r\nstation encountered any radiological contamination of tuna or other food\r\nfish, and the American unit has now been closed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _This shell of the giant clam_ Tridacna gigas _shows\r\n    the position of a layer of strontium-90 absorbed in 1958 (black\r\n    line) and in 1956 (white line). The inside of the shell (light\r\n    layers) was deposited in 1964 when the clam was collected at Bikini\r\n    Atoll by scientists from the University of Washington, Seattle._]\r\n\r\nGroups that have cooperated with the AEC in marine radiobiological\r\nresearch are the University of Hawaii, University of Connecticut,\r\nVirginia Fisheries Laboratory, University of Washington, U. S. Office of\r\nNaval Research, and U. S. Bureau of Commercial Fisheries.\r\n\r\nAt the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries Radiobiological Laboratory in\r\nBeaufort, North Carolina, a cooperative effort of the AEC and the BCF is\r\nconcerned with learning the effects of radioactive wastes on one of\r\nAmerica’s most valuable marine resources—the tidal marshlands and\r\nestuaries that are essential to the continued well-being of some of our\r\nimportant commercial fisheries.\r\n\r\n       Table III RADIOISOTOPES THAT MIGHT BE FOUND IN AN ESTUARINE\r\n                               ENVIRONMENT\r\n               Isotope                            Half-life\r\n\r\n  Iodine-131                          8.05 days\r\n  Barium-140—Lanthanum-140            12.8 days—40 hours\r\n  Cesium-141                          32.5 days\r\n  Ruthenium-103—Rhodium-103           10 days—57 minutes\r\n  Zirconium-95—Niobium-95             65 Days—35 days,\r\n  Zinc-65                             245 days\r\n  Cerium-144                          285 days\r\n  Manganese-54                        314 days\r\n  Ruthenium-106—Rhodium-106           1 year—30 seconds\r\n  Cesium-137                          30 years\r\n  Potassium-40                        1.3 × 10⁹ years\r\n\r\n  (Reprinted from _Radiobiological Laboratory Annual Report_, April, 1,\r\n  1964, page 50.)\r\n\r\nThe project has determined that radionuclides are removed from waters in\r\nan estuarine environment by several physical, chemical, and biological\r\nmeans. For example, radionuclides are absorbed in river-bed sediments at\r\na rate varying directly with sediment particle size. Mollusks, such as\r\nclams, marsh mussels, oysters, and scallops, not only assimilate\r\nradionuclides selectively, but do so in sufficient quantity and with\r\nsufficient reliability to be useful as indicators of the quantity of the\r\nisotopes present. Clams and mussels are indicators for cerium-144 and\r\nruthenium-106, scallops for manganese-54, and oysters for zinc-65 (most\r\nof which winds up in the oyster’s edible portions). It was learned that\r\nscallops assimilate more radioactivity than any other mollusk. Of the\r\ntotal radioactivity, manganese-54 accounts for 60%: The scallop’s kidney\r\ncontains 100 times as much manganese-54 as any of the other tissues and\r\n300 times as much as the muscle, the only part of the scallop usually\r\neaten in this country.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _On the left are mussels collected near the Columbia\r\n    River in an environment containing abnormal amounts of zinc-65._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Mussels suspended in seawater in research to\r\n    determine how fast they lose their zinc-65 radioactivity._\r\n    (_Photograph taken at low tide._)]\r\n\r\nIn a surprising unintended result, it was determined that one acre of\r\noyster beds, comprising 300,000 individual oysters, may filter out the\r\nradionuclides from approximately 10,000 cubic meters (18 cubic miles) of\r\nwater per week!\r\n\r\nThe Radiological Laboratory scientists also have found that plankton are\r\nhigh concentrators of both chromium-51 and zinc-65, and that zinc\r\napparently is an essential nutrient for all marine organisms. Some\r\nplants and animals appear to reach a peak of radionuclide accumulation\r\nquickly, which then tapers off even though the radiation concentration\r\nin the water is unchanged.\r\n\r\nWhile the AEC’s oceanographic research budgets have not been large, they\r\nhave contributed materially to knowledge of the oceanic environment.\r\nAEC-sponsored research at Scripps Institution of Oceanography has\r\ndetermined by a process known as neutron activation analysis[11] that\r\nthe concentration of rare earth elements in Pacific Ocean waters appears\r\nto be only about one hundredth of the level previously reported. By\r\nanalysis of naturally occurring radioisotopes, they have also discovered\r\nthat it takes from one million to 100 million years for lithium,\r\npotassium, barium, strontium, and similar elements introduced into the\r\nocean from rivers to be deposited in the bottom sediments. Aluminum,\r\niron, and titanium are deposited in from 100 to 1000 years. They have\r\nalso found that sedimentation occurs in the South Pacific at a rate of\r\nfrom 0.3 to 0.6 millimeter per thousand years, in the North Pacific at a\r\nrate several times that figure, and in the basins on either side of the\r\nMid-Atlantic Ridge at a rate of several millimeters per thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe University of Miami has successfully developed two methods for\r\ndetermining the ages of successive layers of deep ocean sediments based\r\non the relative abundances of natural radioelements, and thereby has\r\nestablished a chronology of climatic changes during the last 200,000\r\nyears during which the sediments were laid down.\r\n\r\nThe U. S. is not alone in its use of nuclear energy as a tool of\r\nscience. The United Kingdom has carried out radiological studies of the\r\nmarine environment for many years, particularly concentrating on the\r\neffects of radionuclides from nuclear power plants on the sea\r\nimmediately contiguous to the British Isles. Both the European Atomic\r\nEnergy Community and the International Atomic Energy Agency also\r\nencouraged marine radiological studies. Many laboratories and government\r\nagencies in Europe, North and South America, Africa, and the Middle East\r\nand Far East have well-established and productive programs under way.\r\n\r\nScientists in many parts of the world have used both natural and\r\nintentionally injected radiation to study the coastwise movement of\r\nbeach materials. British experimenters, for example, activate sand with\r\nscandium-46 and are thus able to follow its movement for up to four\r\nmonths. Pebbles (shingle) coated with barium-140 and lanthanum-140 are\r\nalso used as tracers and are good for 6 weeks. Scientists at the\r\nUniversity of California trace naturally occurring radioisotopes of\r\nthorium, which may be introduced from deposits of thorium sands along\r\nriver banks. These studies are of immediate practical importance, for\r\neach year the ocean moves billions of cubic yards of sand, gravel,\r\nshingle, and rock to and from beaches and along shores. This action\r\ndestroys recreational beaches, fills channels, blocks off harbors, and\r\nin general rearranges the terrain, often at considerable cost and\r\ninconvenience to mariners and other people who use the coast.\r\n\r\nIn another use of radioisotopes in marine research, studies at the AEC’s\r\nOak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee have revealed radioactivity\r\nin the scales of fish taken from waters affected by the laboratory’s\r\nradioactive waste effluent. It was suggested that this phenomenon might\r\nbe put to use as a tagging technique in fish-migration studies, and\r\nscientists are now working on a method using cesium-134 introduced into\r\nthe fishes’ natural diet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Isaacs-Kidd midwater trawl collects samples of\r\n    oceanic animals off the Oregon Coast. These animals are then\r\n    radioanalyzed to compare the quantity of radioisotopes associated\r\n    with animals from various depths. The recorder at the trawl mouth\r\n    indicates the volume of water filtered._]\r\n\r\nSome of the most extensive studies of a marine environment ever\r\nconducted are those by the AEC, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, and\r\nthe University of Washington in the Columbia River system and the nearby\r\nPacific Ocean. Operations at the AEC’s giant Hanford facilities some 300\r\nmiles upstream from the ocean result in the release of small amounts of\r\nradioactivity to the river and also in raising the river-water\r\ntemperature. This downstream research is to determine any effects of\r\nthese changes, including any that might be detrimental to man. The\r\nresearch encompasses studies of the variations and distributions of the\r\nfreshwater “plume”—the outflow from the rivermouth—extending into the\r\nnearby Pacific, sediment analyses, studies of the population dynamics of\r\nphytoplankton, and the transport of radionuclides through the food\r\nchain.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _This core sampler is used to obtain stream bed\r\n    samples up to 5 feet long in the Columbia River. The samples are\r\n    then analyzed for radioisotope content._]\r\n\r\nAs so often happens with basic programs, this research has produced\r\nimmediate benefits. New resources of marketable oceanic fish were\r\ndiscovered by the scientists at depths never before fished commercially\r\n(from the edge of the continental shelf to depths of 500 fathoms and\r\ngreater). Similarly, commercial quantities of one species of crab have\r\nbeen discovered in the deeper ocean. Other findings indicate that crab\r\npopulations may have seasonal up-and-down migrations that vary according\r\nto sex. It appears, in fact, that, except while mating and as juveniles,\r\nthe male and female crab populations lead separate lives. This\r\ninformation is important both for more efficient fisheries and for\r\nimproved conservation of the crab as a food resource.\r\n\r\nThe AEC is, in short, concerned with virtually every facet of basic\r\noceanography, and with study of the sea as a whole, for radionuclides,\r\nlike their nonradioactive counterparts, can and do become involved in\r\nevery phase of the vast and complex ocean ecology. In the process of\r\npursuing its research interests, it also provides oceanographers with a\r\nwhole new family of tools for study. Let us now see how atomic\r\ninstruments contribute to the growing knowledge of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nOceanographic Instruments\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _This radioisotope powered swimsuit heater uses\r\n    plutonium-238 to produce 420 watts of heat. Water, heated by the\r\n    decay of ²³⁸Pu, is pumped through plastic veins partially visible in\r\n    the undergarment. The cylinder under the diver’s arm contains 4\r\n    capsules of ²³⁸Pu, and a battery-pump assembly is contained in the\r\n    box at his feet. After preliminary tests at the Naval Medical\r\n    Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, the unit will be used in\r\n    Sealab III, the Navy’s underwater research laboratory. The heater\r\n    was developed by the AEC Division of Isotopes Development._]\r\n\r\nThe ocean is both a complex and a harsh environment and its study has\r\nalways demanded that designers of seaworthy instruments and sampling\r\ndevices be both ingenious and experienced in shipboard requirements.\r\nUntil recently, these devices tended to be rugged and simple, if not\r\nindeed crude. More refined, electronic instrumentation has begun to\r\nappear in recent years, but most designs still fail to pass the test of\r\nuse at sea. Even among those that do pass, there is persistent\r\ndifficulty in separating desired information-carrying signals from\r\nbackground and system-induced “noise”. This has been a specific problem\r\nwith current meters designed to be moored in the open ocean and also\r\nwith one quite sophisticated gamma-ray detector.\r\n\r\nTo meet the clear need for improved devices, as well as to support its\r\nown research and increase utilization of nuclear materials and\r\ntechniques, the AEC Division of Isotopes Development encourages the\r\ndevelopment of oceanographic instrumentation. This comparatively young\r\ntechnology already has produced exciting results. The future may be even\r\nmore revealing as nuclear energy is applied more and more to the study,\r\nexploration, and exploitation of the ocean.\r\n\r\nInstruments that have been developed under the AEC program include a\r\ncurrent meter, a dissolved-oxygen-content analyzer, and a\r\nsediment-density meter. A new, fast method for determining the mineral\r\ncontent of geological samples also has been perfected.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe DEEP WATER ISOTOPIC CURRENT ANALYZER (DWICA) was developed under a\r\ncontract with William H. Johnson Laboratories, Inc. It relies on\r\nradioisotope drift time over a fixed course to measure seawater flow\r\nrates ranging from 0.002 to 10.0 knots. The device embodies 12 radiation\r\nsensors spaced equally in a circle around a radioisotope-injection\r\nnozzle. Current direction can be determined to within 15 degrees. The\r\nmass of tracer isotope injected is very small—less than 10 picograms[12]\r\nper injection—and the instrument can store enough tracer material to\r\noperate for a year. The tracer can be injected automatically at\r\nintervals from 2 to 20 minutes, depending on the current. The device\r\nsits on the sea floor, where its orientation to magnetic north can be\r\ndetermined within 2.5 degrees.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The Deep Water Isotopic Current Analyzer._]\r\n\r\n  Isotope Reservoir and equipressure system\r\n  Electric logic circuitry\r\n  Pressure protective case\r\n  Compass\r\n  Sensor ring\r\n  Flow baffle plate\r\n  Isotope injection point\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Deep Water Isotopic Current Analyzer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA SEDIMENT DENSITY PROBE, developed under an AEC contract by Lane-Wells\r\nCompany, employs gamma-ray absorption and backscatter properties[13] to\r\ndetermine the density of the sediments at the bottom of lakes, rivers,\r\nor the ocean, without the necessity of returning a sediment sample to\r\nthe surface. It is expected that it can be modified to sense the water\r\ncontent of the sediments. These determinations are valuable not only for\r\nresearch, but also for activity that requires structures on the ocean\r\nfloor, such as petroleum exploration and naval operations.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The Sediment Density Probe. The drawing shows the\r\n    complete probe._]\r\n\r\nThe unit consists of a rocket-like tube 26 feet long and about 4 inches\r\nin diameter, containing a gamma-ray-emitting cesium-137 source, a lead\r\nshield, and a radiation detector. The device is lowered over the side of\r\na ship and allowed to penetrate the sediment. Once in place, the gamma\r\nray source, shield, and detector move together up and down, inside the\r\nprobe, for a distance of 11 feet, stopping every 24 inches for 4 minutes\r\nto take a measurement. Gamma rays are absorbed in any material through\r\nwhich they pass, according to its density. A low radiation count at the\r\ndetector indicates a high-density sediment: More radiation is absorbed\r\nand less is reflected back to the detector. Conversely, a high count\r\nindicates low density. Data are recorded on special cold-resistant film.\r\nA number of different sediment measurements can be made in several\r\nlocations before the unit must be returned to the surface.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Oxygen analyzer equipment includes the deep-sea\r\n    probe (large device, center, including a special Geiger counter, the\r\n    electronic assembly, a pump, and power supplies), cable for\r\n    transmission of Geiger counter signals (back), and portable scaler\r\n    (left)._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The latter is also shown aboard a research vessel\r\n    (inset) during tests made at sea._]\r\n\r\n\r\nOXYGEN ANALYZER The amount of dissolved oxygen in any part of the ocean\r\nis a basic quantity that must be determined before some kinds of\r\nresearch can be undertaken. For example, oxygen concentration is\r\nimportant in determining the life-support capability of seawater and in\r\nmeasuring deep-water mixing. In the past this measurement has had to be\r\ndetermined by laborious chemical methods that may subject the water\r\nsample to contamination by exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Under an AEC\r\ncontract, the Research Triangle Institute has developed a dissolved\r\noxygen analyzer that relies on the quantitative oxidation by dissolved\r\noxygen of thallium metal containing a known ratio of radioactive\r\nthallium-204.\r\n\r\nThe seawater sample passes through a column lined with thallium. The\r\nthallium is oxydized and goes into solution. It then passes between two\r\nfacing pancake-shaped radiation counters that record the level of beta\r\nradiation from the thallium-204. Since the rate of oxidation, and\r\ntherefore the rate of release of the thallium to solution, is\r\nproportional to the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water, it is\r\nsimple to calibrate the device to show oxygen content. The system is\r\nsensitive enough to detect one part of oxygen in 10 billion of water.\r\nAnd, the device can be towed and take readings at depths of up to one\r\nmile, an added advantage that obviates the chances of surface-air\r\ncontamination.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS Nuclear energy is contributing to the more\r\naccurate and more rapid analysis of minerals in the sea in at least two\r\ndifferent ways. The first employs neutron activation analysis, which we\r\nhave already mentioned. This method is valuable not only in analyzing\r\nsediments cored from the ocean floor, but also in the detection and\r\nquantitative analysis of trace elements in the water. Knowledge of the\r\nrole of all natural constituents in the ocean is essential to an\r\nunderstanding of the complex interrelationships of the ocean\r\nenvironment, as we have seen. Identification of trace elements also is a\r\nnecessary preliminary to determining the effects of purposely introduced\r\nradionuclides. Collection of the minute quantities of trace elements is\r\nvery difficult at best. Once they have been collected and concentrated,\r\nneutron activation analysis provides a means for their identification\r\nand measurement.\r\n\r\n\r\nX-RAY FLUORESCENCE is another technique, used to identify the mineral\r\ncontent of ore or sediment. This system was developed (for the purpose\r\nof spotting gold being smuggled through Customs) by Tracerlab Division\r\nof Laboratory for Electronics, Inc. (LFE), under an AEC contract.\r\nSimilar equipment was developed simultaneously in England for use by\r\nprospectors, geologists and mining engineers. It now may be used at sea\r\nin analyzing samples from the sea floor. As is often the case with\r\nisotope-based devices, its operation is really quite simple. When\r\nexcited by radiation from an isotope (or any other radiation source),\r\neach element produces its own unique pattern of X-ray fluorescence, that\r\nis, it radiates characteristic X rays. By varying filters and measuring\r\nthe count rate, oceanographers can detect and measure materials, such as\r\ntin, copper, lead, and zinc. The British unit is completely\r\ntransistorized, battery powered, and weighs only 16.5 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHODAMINE-B DYE The AEC also has improved oceanographic research in ways\r\nthat do not involve the use of nuclear energy. Some years ago under the\r\njoint sponsorship of the AEC Division of Reactor Development and\r\nTechnology and the Division of Biology and Medicine, the Waterlift\r\nDivision of Cleveland Pneumatic Tool Company developed instrumentation\r\nand techniques for detecting the presence of the red dye, rhodamine-B,\r\nin concentrations as low as one-tenth part per billion. This method is\r\nnow widely used both for groundwater studies and in the study of\r\ncurrents, diffusion, and pollution in rivers, lakes, and the ocean. In\r\nmany cases, rhodamine-B is a better tracer in water than radioisotopes,\r\ndue to the greater ease with which it is detected.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironmental Safety Studies\r\n\r\nThe AEC Division of Reactor Development and Technology has supported\r\nextensive environmental studies to assess the safety of isotopic power\r\nsources (to be discussed later) in oceanic environments. One of the most\r\nimportant of these is being conducted by the Naval Radiological Defense\r\nLaboratory at an ocean environmental testing complex near San Clemente\r\nIsland off the coast of California, which includes a shore installation\r\nand a floating ocean platform. These studies are to determine seawater\r\ncorrosion of containment alloys and fuel solubility in seawater; the\r\ndispersion of the fuel in the ocean; the effect of the radioactive\r\nmaterial on marine life; and the radiation hazard to man, when all\r\nsignificant exposure pathways are considered.\r\n\r\nIn another study the Chesapeake Bay Institute of Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity investigated potential hazards that might result if\r\nradioactive materials were released off the Atlantic Coast. Five areas\r\nalong the Continental Shelf were examined in detail for environmental\r\nfactors such as vertical diffusion. The same Institute made\r\nenvironmental and physical dispersion studies off Cape Kennedy, Florida,\r\nto predict the fate of any radioactive materials that might be released\r\nin aborted launchings of nuclear rockets or nuclear auxiliary power\r\ndevices for space uses. Fluorescent dye was released into offshore, surf\r\nzone, and inshore locations; the diffusion was observed, sampled, and\r\ncompared with existing diffusion theory. Mathematical models have been\r\ndeveloped that can now be used to predict the rate and extent of\r\ndiffusion in the Cape Kennedy area in the event of any radioactivity\r\nrelease from aborted test flights.\r\n\r\nSimilar studies have been carried out near the space launching site at\r\nPoint Arguello, California, by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.\r\nThese included collection of data on dispersion, marine sediments, and\r\nthe biological uptake of radioactive plutonium, polonium, cesium, and\r\nstrontium.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Atom at Work in the Sea\r\n\r\nNUCLEAR REACTOR PROPULSION\r\n\r\nThe transformation in undersea warfare tactics and national defense\r\nstrategy effected by the introduction of nuclear-powered submarines is\r\nnow well known. Navy submarines employing the latest reactors and fuel\r\nelements can stay at sea for more than 3 years without refueling.\r\n_Polaris_ submarines on patrol remain submerged for 60 to 70 days. The\r\nnuclear submarine _Triton_, tracing Magellan’s route of 400 years\r\nearlier, traveled 36,000 miles under water, moving around the world in\r\n83 days and 10 hours. Under-ice transits of the Arctic Ocean by nuclear\r\nsubmarines are now commonplace. These feats all are possible because of\r\nthe nuclear reactors and propulsion systems developed by the AEC\r\nDivision of Naval Reactors, which also developed the propulsion plants\r\nfor the Navy’s nuclear surface vessels.[14]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _USS_ Seadragon _and_ Skate _sit nose to nose on top\r\n    of the world after under-ice voyages from the Atlantic and Pacific\r\n    Oceans to the North Pole._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _A frogman from the Seadragon swims under the Arctic\r\n    ice in one of the first photographs made beneath the North Pole._]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEEP SUBMERGENCE RESEARCH VEHICLE On April 18, 1965, President Johnson\r\nannounced that the Atomic Energy Commission and Department of the Navy\r\nwere undertaking development of a nuclear-powered deep submergence\r\nresearch and engineering vehicle. This manned vehicle, designated the\r\nNR-1, will have vastly greater endurance than any other yet developed or\r\nplanned, because of its nuclear power. Its development will provide the\r\nbasis for future nuclear-powered oceanographic research vehicles of even\r\ngreater versatility and depth capability.\r\n\r\nThe NR-1 will be able to move at maximum speed for periods of time\r\nlimited only by the amount of food and supplies it carries. With a crew\r\nof five and two scientists, the vehicle will be able to make detailed\r\nstudies of the ocean bottom, temperature, currents, and other phenomena\r\nfor military, commercial, and scientific uses. The nuclear propulsion\r\nplant will give it great independence from surface support ships and\r\nessentially unlimited endurance for exploration.\r\n\r\nThe submarine will have viewing ports for visual observation of its\r\nsurroundings and of the ocean bottom. A remote grapple will permit\r\ncollection of marine samples and other objects. The NR-1 is expected to\r\nbe capable of exploring areas of the Continental Shelf, which appears to\r\ncontain the most accessible wealth in mineral and food resources in the\r\nseas. Exploratory charting of this kind may help the United States in\r\nestablishing sovereignty over parts of the Continental Shelf; a ship\r\nwith its depth capability can explore an ocean-bottom area several times\r\nlarger than the United States.\r\n\r\nThe reactor plant for the vehicle is being designed by the General\r\nElectric Company’s Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, Schenectady, New\r\nYork. The remainder of the propulsion plant is being designed by the\r\nElectric Boat Division, General Dynamics Corporation, Groton,\r\nConnecticut.\r\n\r\nScientists are already beginning to implant small sea floor\r\nlaboratories. In the future, when large permanent undersea installations\r\nfor scientific investigation, mining, or fish farming become a reality,\r\nnuclear reactors like the one designed for research submersibles or the\r\none already in use in Antarctica and other remote locations[15] will\r\nserve as their power plants.\r\n\r\nISOTOPIC POWER SOURCES\r\n\r\nThe ocean is a logistically remote environment, in the sense that\r\nconventional combustible fuels can’t be used underwater unless supplied\r\nwith their own sources of oxygen. It is usually extremely costly to take\r\nanything heavy or bulky into the deep ocean. Even if the two essential\r\ncomponents of combustion—fuel and oxygen—could be delivered economically\r\nto an undersea base or craft, the extreme back pressure of the depths\r\nwould present serious exhaust problems. Yet deep beneath the sea is just\r\nwhere we now propose to do large amounts of work requiring huge supplies\r\nof reliable energy. The lack of reliable and extended duration power\r\nsources is perhaps one of the most critical requirements for expansion\r\nof underwater and marine technology. For example, the pressing need for\r\nmeasurements of atmospheric and oceanic data to support scientific,\r\ncommercial, and military operations will in the future require literally\r\nhundreds of oceanographic and meteorological buoys deployed throughout\r\nthe world to take simultaneous measurements and time-series observations\r\nat specific sites.\r\n\r\nSome of these buoys will support and monitor up to 100 sensors each.\r\nThese devices record a variety of physical, chemical, and radiological\r\nphenomena above, at, or below the surface. Periodically the sensor data\r\nwill be converted to digital form and stored on magnetic tape for later\r\nretrieval by distant shore-based or shipboard radio command, by\r\nsatellite command (for retransmittal to ground stations), or by physical\r\nrecovery of the tapes. Individually, each buoy will not require a great\r\ndeal of energy to operate, but will have to operate reliably over long\r\nperiods of time. Conventional power sources are being used for the\r\nprototype buoys now under development and testing, but these robot ocean\r\nplatforms in the future will make excellent use of nuclear energy\r\nsupplied by isotopic power sources.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The world’s first nuclear-powered weather buoy\r\n    located in the center of the Gulf of Mexico.

Navy’s NOMAD system, is on a barge 10 feet × 20\r\n    feet, and is anchored in 12,000 feet of water._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: diagram]\r\n\r\n  RADIO ANTENNA\r\n  WEATHER SENSORS\r\n  WARNING BEACON\r\n  NUCLEAR GENERATOR\r\n\r\nThe SNAP-7D isotope power generator has been operating unattended since\r\nJanuary 1964 on a deep-ocean moored buoy in the Gulf of Mexico. This U.\r\nS. Navy NOMAD (Navy Oceanographic and Meteorological Automatic Device)\r\nbuoy is powered by a 60-watt, strontium-90 radioisotope source, which\r\nwas developed by the AEC Division of Reactor Development and Technology.\r\nThis weather station transmits data for 2 minutes and 20 seconds every 3\r\nhours. This data includes air temperature, barometric pressure, and wind\r\nvelocity and direction. Storm detectors trigger special hourly\r\ntransmissions during severe weather conditions. The generator operates\r\ncontinuously and charges storage batteries between transmissions. Some\r\npower is used to light a navigation beacon to alert passing ships.\r\n\r\nEnergy from the heat of radioisotope decay has been used on a\r\n“proof-of-principle” basis in several other instances involving ocean or\r\nmarine technology.\r\n\r\nAn experimental ⁹⁰Sr isotope-powered acoustic navigation beacon\r\n(SNAP-7E) now rests on the sea floor in 15,000 feet of water near\r\nBermuda. Devices such as these not only will enable nearby surface\r\nresearch or salvage vessels to locate their positions precisely\r\n(something very difficult to do at sea) and to return to the same spot,\r\nbut the beacons also will aid submarine navigation (see page 48).\r\n\r\nA U. S. Coast Guard lighthouse located in Chesapeake Bay has been\r\npowered by a 60-watt, ⁹⁰Sr power source, SNAP-7B, for 2 years without\r\nmaintenance or service. This unit was subsequently relocated for use in\r\nanother application (described below).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Engineers prepare to install the SNAP-7D\r\n    generator._]\r\n\r\nThe first commercial use of one of these “atomic batteries” began in\r\n1965 when the SNAP-7B 60-watt generator went into operation on an\r\nunmanned Phillips Petroleum Company offshore oil platform, 40 miles\r\nsoutheast of Cameron, Louisiana. The generator operates flashing\r\nnavigational lights and, in bad weather, an electronic foghorn (see page\r\n49). This unit will be tested for 2 years to determine the economic\r\nfeasibility of routinely using isotopic power devices on a commercial\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Acoustic pulses.]\r\n\r\n  Buoyancy tank\r\n  Sound amplifier\r\n  Nuclear-powered sound source\r\n  Ocean bottom\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The SNAP-7E isotopic generator powers an undersea\r\n    acoustic beacon, which produces an acoustic pulse once every 60\r\n    seconds.

As a result of the success of these tests,\r\na variety of potential oceanographic applications have been identified.\r\nA study, conducted by Aerojet-General Corporation in conjunction with\r\nGlobal Marine Exploration Company and Northwest Consultant\r\nOceanographers, Inc., described ocean applications including underwater\r\nnavigational aids, acoustic beacons, channel markers, cable boosters,\r\nweather buoys, offshore oil well controls along with innumerable\r\noceanographic research applications. This study was sponsored by the AEC\r\nDivision of Isotopes Development.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy the requirements for these and other applications,\r\nthe AEC has begun developing a series of compact and highly reliable\r\nisotope power devices that are designed to be economically competitive\r\nwith alternative power sources. Currently underway are two specific\r\nprojects, SNAP-21 and SNAP-23.\r\n\r\nSNAP-21 is a two-phase project to develop a series of compact\r\nstrontium-90 power systems for deep-sea and ocean-bottom uses\r\n(20,000-foot depths). The first phase of design and component\r\ndevelopment on a basic 10-watt system already has been completed, and a\r\nsecond phase development and test effort now under way will extend\r\nthrough 1970. A series of power sources in the 10- and 20-watt range\r\nwill be available for general purpose deep-ocean application.\r\n\r\nThe SNAP-23 project involves the development of a series of economically\r\nattractive strontium-90 power systems for remote terrestrial uses. This\r\nproject will result in 25-watt, 60-watt, and 100-watt units capable of\r\nlong-term operation in surface buoys, offshore oil platforms, weather\r\nstations, and microwave repeater stations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, effort is underway by the AEC to develop an\r\nisotope-fueled heater that will be used by aquanauts in the Navy’s\r\nSealab Program (see page 12). Future activities, now being planned, will\r\ninvolve the development of large isotope power sources (1-10 electric\r\nkilowatts) and small nuclear reactors (50-100 kilowatts) for use in\r\nmanned and unmanned deep-ocean platforms.\r\n\r\n\r\nOcean Engineering\r\n\r\nConsiderable engineering experience has been derived from the work of\r\nfederal agencies in development of the largest taut-moored instrumented\r\nbuoy system ever deployed in the deep ocean. Developed by Ocean Science\r\n81 Engineering, Inc., it is useful in observation and prediction of\r\nenvironmental changes.\r\n\r\nThe system embodies substantial advances in design. It incorporates,\r\namong other features, an acoustically commanded underwater winch for\r\nadjustment of the mooring depth after the buoy is deployed, and for\r\nrecovering a 16,000-pound submerged data-recording instrument canister.\r\nThis buoy system can survive being moored in up to 18,000-foot depths of\r\nthe open ocean for upward of 30 days.\r\n\r\nThe very first deep-ocean, taut-moored buoy system was developed for the\r\ngovernment in 1954, and has since become an important tool for\r\noceanographers and others who seek stable instrument platforms at sea.\r\nThe buoys have the advantage of minimizing horizontal movement due to\r\ncurrents, winds, and waves.\r\n\r\nThe National Marine Consultants Division of Interstate Electronics\r\nCorporation has developed for the government a system for measuring the\r\npropagation of seismic sea waves (tsunamis).\r\n\r\nWork of these sorts contributes materially to reliable ocean\r\nengineering. And the measurements made by these sophisticated\r\ninstruments contribute to our knowledge of ocean fluid dynamics and wave\r\nmechanics.\r\n\r\nCorrosion is a huge, ever-present problem plaguing oceanographic\r\nengineers, ship designers, mariners, operators of desalination plants,\r\npetroleum companies with offshore facilities, and, in fact, everyone who\r\nplaces structures in salt water to do useful work. While the basic\r\nmechanisms of corrosion are known, there are many detailed aspects that\r\nare not: For example, the precise role of bacteriological slimes in\r\ncausing corrosion on supposedly protected structures. Radioisotope\r\ntracers now are helping engineers follow the chemical, physical, and\r\nbiological actions in corrosion processes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFresh Water from Seawater\r\n\r\nIn 1960 the chairman of the board of a large U. S. corporation made a\r\nfundamental policy decision for his company: Since the greatest critical\r\nneed of man in the next decade would be fresh water, his company would\r\nbegin working to produce large volumes of fresh water—including the\r\ndevelopment of methods for desalting seawater. His pioneering analysis\r\nproved to be prophetic.\r\n\r\nThroughout the world, more people are using more water for more purposes\r\nthan ever before. Many areas of the world, including some that are\r\ndensely populated, have been parched since the dawn of history. In\r\nothers where water was once abundant, not only are natural sources being\r\ndepleted faster than they are replaced, but many rivers and lakes have\r\nbeen so polluted that they can now scarcely be used.\r\n\r\nThe world’s greatest resource of water is the ocean, but energy is\r\nrequired to remove the salt from it and make it potable or even useful\r\nfor agriculture and industry. The energy produced by nuclear reactors is\r\nconsidered economical in the large quantities that soon will be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe AEC and the Office of Saline Water of the Department of the\r\nInterior, after a preliminary study, have joined with the Metropolitan\r\nWater District of Southern California and the electric utility firms\r\nserving the area, to begin construction of a very large nuclear-power\r\ndesalting plant on a man-made island off the California coast. The\r\nplant, when completed in the 1970s, will have an initial water capacity\r\nof 50 million gallons per day and also will generate about 1,800,000\r\nkilowatts of electricity. Additional desalting capacity is planned for\r\naddition later to achieve a total water capacity of 150 million gallons\r\nper day.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Plans to construct a nuclear desalting plant in\r\n    California were announced in August 1966 by (from left) AEC\r\n    Commissioner James T. Ramey, Secretary of the Interior Stewart L.\r\n    Udall, Mayor Samuel Yorty of Los Angeles, and Joseph Jensen, Board\r\n    Chairman of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern\r\n    California._]\r\n\r\nPlans for other nuclear-powered desalting projects around the world are\r\nbeing discussed by the United States government, the International\r\nAtomic Energy Agency and the governments of many other nations. Some of\r\nthese also may be in operation during the early 1970s.[17]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Model of the nuclear power desalting plant to be\r\n    built on the coast of Southern California._]\r\n\r\nThese projects followed extended detailed studies, including one\r\n“milestone” investigation at the AEC’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory in\r\nTennessee, in which the economic feasibility of using very large nuclear\r\nreactors coupled to very large desalting equipment to produce power and\r\nwater was determined.\r\n\r\nThe significance of these studies was recognized by President Johnson in\r\n1964, when he told the Third International Conference on Peaceful Uses\r\nof Atomic Energy: “The time is coming when a single desalting plant\r\npowered by nuclear energy will produce hundreds of millions of gallons\r\nof fresh water—and large amounts of electricity—every day.”\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that today realization of that goal is much nearer.\r\n\r\nThe installation of new and larger desalting plants will in itself\r\nrequire extensive additional oceanographic research. By the nature of\r\ntheir operation these plants will be discharging considerable volumes of\r\nheated water with a salt content higher than that of the sea. Throughout\r\nthe ocean, but particularly in the estuaries, sea life is sensitive to\r\nthe concentration of ocean salts and temperature. Studies of the effect\r\nof such discharges will be an essential part of any large-scale\r\ndesalination program.\r\n\r\n\r\nRadiation Preservation of Seafood\r\n\r\nThe use of nuclear radiation for the preservation of food is a new\r\nprocess of particular importance for seafood. The ocean constitutes the\r\nworld’s largest source of animal protein food. Yet the harvests of the\r\nsea can be stored safely, even with refrigeration, for far shorter\r\nperiods than can most other foods. In many parts of the world, this\r\ntendency to spoil makes fish products available only to people who live\r\nnear seacoasts.\r\n\r\nMany types of seafood, however, when exposed to radiation from\r\nradioisotopes or small accelerators, can be stored under normal\r\nrefrigeration for up to four weeks without deterioration. The process\r\ndoes not alter the appearance or taste of the seafood; it merely\r\ndestroys bacteria that cause spoilage. This fact holds promise not only\r\nfor the world’s protein-starved populations, but also for the economic\r\nwell-being of commercial fishermen, whose markets would be much\r\nexpanded.\r\n\r\nIn support of this program, the AEC has built and is operating at\r\nGloucester, Massachusetts, a prototype commercial seafood irradiator\r\nplant capable of processing 2000 pounds of seafood an hour. The\r\nradiation is supplied by a cobalt-60 source. Private industry is\r\ncooperating with the AEC in the evaluation of this facility.[18]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The first shipboard irradiator was on The_ Delaware,\r\n    _a research fishing vessel. Fish, preserved through irradiation soon\r\n    after they are caught, have a refrigerated storage life two or three\r\n    times longer than nonirradiated fish._]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _The first shipboard irradiator._]\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Plowshare\r\n\r\nNuclear explosives are, among other things, large-scale, low-cost\r\nexcavation devices. In this respect, with the proper pre-detonation\r\nstudy and engineering, they are ideally suited for massive earth-moving\r\nand “geological engineering” projects, including the construction of\r\nharbors and canals. The western coasts of three continents, Australia,\r\nAfrica, and South America, are sparsely supplied with good harbors. A\r\nnumber of studies have been undertaken as to the feasibility of using\r\nnuclear explosives for digging deepwater harbors. Undoubtedly at some\r\ntime in the future, these projects will be carried out.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are many places in the world where the construction\r\nof a sea-level canal would provide shorter and safer routes for ocean\r\nshipping, expedite trade and commerce, or open up barren and\r\nunpopulated, but mineral-rich lands to settlers and profitable\r\ndevelopment. The AEC Division of Peaceful Nuclear Explosives operates a\r\ncontinuing program to develop engineering skills for such projects.[19]\r\nConstruction of a sea-level canal across the Central American isthmus is\r\none well-known proposal for this “Plowshare” program.\r\n\r\nThe use of nuclear explosives in this manner may one day change the very\r\nshape of the world ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\nA New _Fram_\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Fridtjof Nansen_]\r\n\r\nJust about 70 years ago, the oceanographer and explorer, Dr. Fridtjof\r\nNansen completed his famous voyage aboard the research vessel _Fram_,\r\nwhich remained locked in the Arctic ice pack for 3 years, drifting\r\naround the top of the world while the men aboard her studied the\r\noceanography of the polar sea. Now the National Science Foundation has\r\ntaken the first steps toward building a modern version of _Fram_ for\r\nArctic studies. This time the vessel will be an Arctic Drift Barge\r\ncontaining the best equipment modern technology can offer—including, it\r\nis proposed, a central nuclear power plant to guarantee heat and power.\r\nScheduled for completion sometime in the 1970s, this project represents\r\nyet another use of the atom in the study of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL OCEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ocean is no longer an area of isolated scientific interest, nor\r\nmerely a turbulent two-dimensional surface over which man conducts his\r\ncommerce and occasionally fights his wars.\r\n\r\nIn today’s world, the ocean has assumed its full third dimension. Men\r\nand women are going down into it to study, to play, to work, and, alas,\r\nsometimes to fight. As they go, they are taking atomic energy with them.\r\nIn many instances, only the harnessed power in the nuclei of atoms\r\npermits them to penetrate the depths of the mighty sea and there attain\r\ntheir objectives.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: _Artist’s conception of one of three proposed designs\r\n    for the National Science Foundation’s Arctic Drift Barge.

The first craft built by the United States as an\r\noceanographic research vessel, she traveled more than 1,200,000 miles\r\nacross the seven seas for a period of 30 years. She “ran” over 6000\r\nhydrographic stations and was used for innumerable dredging, coring,\r\nbiological, physical, and acoustical research operations. After she was\r\nretired from active service at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution\r\nin Massachusetts, she was sold to Argentina, where she has resumed her\r\nrole as an oceanographic research vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR\r\n\r\nE. W. SEABROOK HULL is an experienced writer and editor in technical and\r\nengineering fields. He is the author of _The Bountiful Sea_, published\r\nin 1964 by Prentice-Hall, and _Plowshare_, another booklet in this\r\nUnderstanding the Atom Series.
