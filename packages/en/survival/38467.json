JAMES RANKIN,\r\nPROPRIETOR.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur original motive in publishing this little book, was one of\r\nself-defense, to relieve ourselves, in a measure, of a correspondence\r\nwhich was becoming much too large for the time at our disposal. After\r\nreading from fifty to one hundred letters per day, from people, asking\r\nall manner of questions concerning the hatching, growing and marketing\r\nof ducks, in detail, there were not hours enough in the twenty-four to\r\nanswer them. This book was published to send out with our machines to\r\nmeet these queries and give our patrons our method of growing, supposing\r\nit would cover all the points in duck-culture, but it does not as yet\r\nanswer the ends. The questions still come in far beyond our ability to\r\nanswer, and as our fourth edition is about exhausted, we now publish a\r\nfifth, revised, enlarged and illustrated; also adding a Question Bureau,\r\nwhich will answer many of the questions which have reached us during the\r\npast few years concerning the growing, as well as the diseases to which\r\nthe Pekin duck is subject. Though we have been in this business for\r\nnearly forty years, and have been eminently successful, we do not claim\r\nto know all about it; but by persistent effort, careful selection and\r\nbreeding, have succeeded in developing a mammoth strain of Pekin ducks,\r\nwhich, for symmetry, precocity and fecundity (experts who have visited\r\nour place from all parts of the country tell us), stand unrivalled on\r\nthis continent.\r\n\r\nMany of our customers write us that their birds average from 150 to 165\r\neggs per season. We would say that there is no domestic bird under so\r\nperfect control, so free from diseases of all kinds, or from insect\r\nparasites as the Pekin duck. From the time the little bird is hatched\r\nuntil it is full grown and ready to reproduce its own species, it is\r\nunder the perfect control of the intelligent operator, who can produce\r\nfeathers, flesh or bone at will, and even mature the bird and compel it\r\nto lay at four-and-a-half months old. There is no bird in existence that\r\nwill respond to kind treatment, generous care and feed as the Pekin\r\nduck. On the other hand, there is no bird more susceptible to improper\r\nfeed or neglect, and a sad mortality is sure to follow among the little\r\nones, where proper food and system are wanting. It may surprise some one\r\nto know that the predisposition to disease may exist in the egg from\r\nwhich the little bird is hatched, or even in the condition of the parent\r\nbird which produces the egg. Strong physique in animal life, as in man,\r\nare like exotics, requiring the most assiduous care and cultivation, and\r\nare the most difficult to transmit.\r\n\r\nDefects, like weeds, seem indigenous to the soil and will reproduce with\r\nunerring regularity, and will often crop out in all directions,\r\ngenerations after you think you have wiped it all out. So it is one\r\nthing to produce an egg from good, strong, vigorous stock during the\r\nwinter in inclement weather, when all nature is against you, and so\r\npoorly fertilized that if it hatches at all, will hatch a chick so\r\nenfeebled in construction that no amount of petting or coaxing can\r\ninduce it to live, but quite another to produce an egg so highly\r\nvitalized, that it will be sure to hatch a healthy young bird, bound to\r\nlive under all circumstances. But this is not all the danger. The\r\noperator, though he may have good eggs, may be neglectful or ignorant,\r\nand the health of the young birds seriously injured during the hours of\r\nincubation; or he may have a defective machine which under no condition\r\ncan turn out healthy birds. With healthy, vigorous parent stock,\r\njudicious care and food, there is no reason why good hatches of strong,\r\nhealthy young birds may not be obtained, and the same matured with very\r\nlittle loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural and Artificial Duck Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is only within a few years that the public at large have become awake\r\nto the importance of the poultry interests in the country. Formerly it\r\nwas supposed to be of insignificant proportions compared to the beef and\r\npork product. But recent statistics show that the poultry interests in\r\nmagnitude not only exceed either of the above, but are vastly on the\r\nincrease year by year. Yet, strange to say, the supply, enormous as it\r\nis, does not keep pace with the demand. As a natural consequence, we are\r\nobliged to import millions of dozens of eggs from Europe, and carloads\r\nof poultry of all descriptions from Canada. (December 21, 1888, a train\r\nof twenty refrigerator cars loaded with dressed poultry, aggregating 200\r\ntons, arrived in Boston from Canada,--$50,000 worth of dressed poultry\r\nat one shipment.) Still the demand goes on. Our large cities, which form\r\nthe principal market for poultry and eggs, are growing larger every\r\nyear. The rich men who inhabit them are growing richer and more\r\nnumerous, and are always ready to pay the poulterer a good round price\r\nfor a first-class article. Good poultry has not only become an every day\r\nnecessity to the well-to-do classes, but is a common article of diet at\r\nleast six months of the year on the workingman's table. It is everywhere\r\nrecognized by physicians as the best and most palatable, as well as the\r\nmost wholesome and nutritious, of all our flesh diets.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuck Culture an Important Industry.\r\n\r\nDuck culture now assumes a most important part in the poultry business,\r\nand yet, until within a few years, people did not suppose that ducks\r\nwere fit to eat. But now the public appetite is fast becoming educated\r\nto the fact that a nice, crispy, roasted duckling of ten weeks old is\r\nnot only a dish fit for an epicure, but is far ahead of either turkey,\r\nchicken or goose. As a natural consequence, the demand for good ducks is\r\nrapidly increasing. One of the principal poultry dealers in Boston\r\nassured me that his sales of ducks had nearly doubled each season for\r\nthe past five years. Twenty years ago, when growing less than 1500 ducks\r\nyearly, I was obliged to visit the city markets personally and tease the\r\ndealers to purchase my birds in order to secure anything like\r\nsatisfactory prices. Now, with a ranch capacity of nearly 20,000 ducks\r\nyearly, I cannot fill my orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nPond or Lake Not Necessary.\r\n\r\nThe reason is very plain. Formerly people supposed that ducks could not\r\nbe successfully grown without access to either pond, stream or coast\r\nline. As a natural consequence, a large share of the birds sold in the\r\nmarkets were grown on or near the coasts, fed largely on fish, partially\r\nfattened, and were anything but a tempting morsel. For years there have\r\nbeen large establishments on the Long Island shores devoted to\r\nduck-culture. Large seines and nets were used regularly to secure the\r\nfish on which the young birds were fed and fattened. These birds grew to\r\na large size and attained a fine plumage, but, as might be surmised,\r\ntheir flesh was coarse and fishy. Occasionally a person was found who\r\nrelished these birds, but the majority of people preferred to eat their\r\nfish and flesh separately. Now this is all changed.\r\n\r\nDuck-culture of today is quite a different thing from the days of yore.\r\nThen, the young birds were confided to the tender mercies of the old\r\nhen. Now, the business is all done artificially. The artificially-grown,\r\nscrap-fed duckling of the interior is a far different bird from his\r\nfishy-fed brother of the coast. He has been educated to a complete\r\nindifference to water except to satisfy his thirst. Taught to take on\r\nflesh and fat instead of feathers, his body is widened out and rounded\r\noff, and, when properly denuded of his feathers, is a thing of beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\nDucks In Great Demand for Food.\r\n\r\nThis sudden popularity of the duck in our markets, the great demand for\r\nthem on the tables of our epicures, together with the immense profits\r\nrealized from growing them, has naturally created quite an interest\r\namong poultry men; so much so that I am constantly flooded with letters\r\nfilled with inquiries as to which is the best variety to raise, which\r\nare the best layers, if they can be hatched in incubators, what kind of\r\nbuildings are necessary, the amount of profit realized,--in short,\r\nwishing me to give them the whole thing in detail, which, were one\r\nwilling, it would be completely out of one's power to do. As there seems\r\nto be no work published in the country to meet this case and answer\r\nthese queries, in pure self-defense, and through earnest persuasion of\r\nmany friends, I shall, to the best of my ability, through this little\r\ntreatise, endeavor to answer them, together with many other points which\r\nwill naturally suggest themselves.\r\n\r\nI shall confine myself almost entirely to an exposition of the\r\nartificial method, giving my own experience in the business for the last\r\nthirty years in detail. In doing this, the most approved buildings will\r\nbe (both for brooding and breeding) described in full, together with\r\ncuts of the egg in different stages of incubation, and the living and\r\ndead germ compared, and how to distinguish each, plainly told. Just here\r\nlet me say that a great deal of skepticism prevails among people in\r\ngeneral and farmers in particular. They do not believe in the success of\r\nartificial poultry growing, or, indeed, of growing it in large numbers\r\nin any other way. As a proof of their assertions they will tell you that\r\nmore than three-fourths of the people who attempt the business on a\r\nlarge scale make a complete failure of it. And it is the plain truth.\r\nThere are few communities in this country, large as it is, but that, at\r\nsome time in the past, has had a bogus incubator within its limits, or a\r\ngood one that has been badly managed. The unfortunate experience of\r\nthese men has spread for miles in all directions. There is but one\r\nverdict. The man is never condemned. The system is so denounced that a\r\nstrong prejudice exists against all incubators, which it is difficult to\r\ncombat. Every town, too, has had its representative poultry man who has\r\nerected extensive building's with a view to growing poultry on a large\r\nscale in the natural way. He, too, has met with disaster. Failure has\r\nattended his efforts, and the community is still more embittered against\r\nthe whole thing, and the emphatic \"It can't be done,\" meets you on every\r\nside.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a cause for all this. Where is it? In the men. They do not\r\ncomply with the conditions of success, and failure is the result. We\r\nwill endeavor to give some of the reasons why: Nearly three-fourths of\r\nthese people come from the city. Now, city people have unfortunately\r\nimbibed the impression that the necessary amount of brains and executive\r\nability required to successfully run a mercantile, manufacturing or\r\nbroker's business in the city is largely in excess of that required to\r\nrun a successful poultry or agricultural ranch in the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nRaising Poultry in the Country.\r\n\r\nMen who have impoverished themselves by repeated failures in the city\r\ncome out to retrieve their fortunes by raising poultry in the country.\r\nThey visit your place and see thousands of young ducklings of all sizes\r\nand ages, each one vieing with the other as to which will consume the\r\nmost food. They are completely carried away with the sight. They\r\nquestion you closely in regard to the profit derived from the business,\r\nand then openly avow their intention of doing the same thing themselves.\r\nYou advise beginning small, and meekly suggest the possibility of\r\nfailure through inexperience. The incredulous smile that plays over\r\ntheir features informs you that advice is wasted. \"Why, haven't I read\r\nup all the poultry journals and got the whole thing down fine?\"\r\n\r\nOthers, still, who, from close confinement at sedentary work in the\r\ncity, are anxious to engage in a business which promises equally to\r\nrestore their health as well as to provide them a livelihood. These\r\ninvalids come out with their exhausted energies and dilapidated\r\nconstitutions to engage in a business which, to insure success, requires\r\na minuteness of detail and intensity of application second to none. They\r\nare unequal to the six or eight hours required of them on a revolving\r\nstool in the counting-room in the city, but are equal to the fourteen\r\nand sixteen hours indispensable to the poultry business in the country.\r\nIs it strange that a large proportion of these men fail?\r\n\r\nOthers, still, come to us wishing to engage in the business, at the same\r\ntime candidly acknowledging their complete ignorance and inexperience.\r\nThey frankly state their circumstances. They are poor, with families to\r\nsupport, and are not afraid of work, throwing themselves, as it were,\r\nupon one's mercy. They seek a good, healthy and fairly profitable\r\noccupation in which they can cultivate the physique and morals of their\r\nchildren away from the temptations of city life. Now you take kindly to\r\nsuch men; readily forfeit any advantages which may accrue to yourself\r\nthrough want of candor on your part, gauge their calibre, and to the\r\nbest of your ability measure their chances of success, and give them the\r\nbest advice you can, which advice usually is to begin small,--say with\r\none machine, buildings in proportion, and increase their plant as their\r\nexperience and judgment dictates.\r\n\r\n\r\nRaise Ducks and Chicks.\r\n\r\nBut the reader will say: \"What has all this to do with duck-culture?\"\r\nSimply this: It is to give the would-be poultry enthusiast some idea of\r\nwhat he has to contend with before he begins. To convince him that this\r\nis no child's play--that the care of young ducks and chicks means early\r\nhours and late. The closest confinement and application is required for\r\nat least six months of the year, and if he is at all afraid of hard work\r\nor of soiling his fingers, he had better stop where he is. The theory\r\nthat the poultry business furnishes a good occupation for little boys\r\nand girls, superannuated old men and invalids, has long since exploded.\r\nWe advise people to secure a fair share of health before they begin and\r\nthen they will be sure to keep it. As an inducement to all, I would say\r\nthat there is nothing in the way of farm industry or any other\r\nlegitimate occupation which will at all compare with the profits\r\nobtained from poultry when artificially conducted. There are, however,\r\na few notable exceptions in favor of watered railroad stock, bogus\r\nmining shares, patent medicines, and the business done by our bank\r\ncashiers when guaranteed a safe transit through to Canada. I would\r\nadvise all contemplating the poultry business to combine the growing of\r\nducks and chicks together, for the reason that more profit can be\r\nrealized from both than from either alone, because they do not\r\nnecessarily interfere with each other, and the same buildings and\r\nmachinery can be utilized for both. The brooding-house should be filled\r\nwith chicks in November and December, which they will have outgrown by\r\nFebruary, when the building will be required for ducklings. The\r\nducklings, strange to say, though two months younger, will be ready for\r\nmarket as soon as the chicks (provided the latter are held for roasters,\r\nas they should be) and they will both be in the market in time to\r\ncommand the highest prices. This is what the poulterer should always\r\ncater for, and machinery alone will enable him to do it. He who expects\r\nto incubate with old hens during the winter will surely get left. But\r\nmore of this hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelect A Good Site.\r\n\r\nThe first thing for one to do (if he is not already located), is to\r\nselect a good site. It should have a gradual slope to the east or south,\r\nenough for natural drainage. No matter how poor the land, it will be\r\nrich enough before your fowls get through with it. I need not say that\r\nin those regions where snow lies upon the ground four or five months of\r\nthe year, the conditions are not as favorable for the poultry grower as\r\nnear the coast line, where snow, though a frequent visitor, remains but\r\na few weeks or days at a time. In the one case it means close\r\nconfinement to the fowls a great part of the winter, with want of\r\nexercise and consequent want of action in the digestive organs. The food\r\nis not assimilated, the fowls become debilitated, and though they may\r\ngive a fair share of eggs, these eggs can seldom be depended upon to\r\nhatch. It is true, the active poulterer may overcome this in a measure\r\nby clearing away the snow for ten or fifteen feet in front of his\r\nbuildings after each storm, and by a free use of barn chaff and chopped\r\nstraw induce his fowls to go out on sunny days, but all this increases\r\nhis work and makes the conditions against him. I simply mention these\r\nfacts, assuming that where a man has his choice of locations, these\r\nhints may have their proper weight in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages with Ducks.\r\n\r\nThe same rule holds good in a measure with breeding ducks, though not in\r\nso great a degree. For instance, your hen when closely confined seems to\r\nlose her ambition, and spends a large part of her time on the perches,\r\napparently indifferent to all sublunary things. Not so your duck. She is\r\nin constant motion, no matter how small her quarters. No meditation for\r\nher. Indeed, the days seem too short for her to exercise in, and so she\r\nkeeps it up through a great part of the night. Her greatest ambition\r\nseems to be to distribute the few quarts of water you have given her for\r\ndrink, evenly all over the pen you have just covered with dry,\r\nfinely-chopped straw, and make it as sloppy as possible, and it is\r\nastonishing in how short a space of time she will succeed in doing it.\r\nAgain, snow and ice are the aversion of the hen.\r\n\r\nShe cannot be induced to step in either except under pressure of\r\ncircumstances. Not so your duck. She likes nothing better than to be out\r\nin a snow bank during a thaw, and if she can only work it up into the\r\ncolor and consistency of mud it suits her exactly. She does not mind\r\nthe cold if she can only keep her feet warm. She is clothed with an\r\nimpenetrable coat of feathers and an equally thick coat of down. She\r\ndoes not take kindly to confinement in a building and will utter her\r\nconstant protest, and like the average school boy of ten prefers to\r\nsuffer from the cold outside to being comfortable in. Therefore, the\r\nmain point in breeding early ducks and erecting buildings for the same,\r\nnext to supplying them with the right kind of food, is to keep their\r\nfeet warm. Cold feet affect the winter laying of the duck the same as a\r\nfrozen comb affects the hen. It stops the egg production at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocate Near a Railroad.\r\n\r\nYour plant should be located on a line of railroad, in direct\r\ncommunication with one or more of our great city markets, and not too\r\nfar from the station, as you will necessarily be in frequent and close\r\ncommunication with that.\r\n\r\n\r\nArrange the Buildings.\r\n\r\nto secure good room in front, also good drainage, and especially with a\r\nview to reducing the labor to a minimum, both inside and out. Always\r\nremember that the labor is the most expensive part of the poultry\r\nbusiness. Now is the time for forethought and caution--save all the\r\nsteps, all the work you can. You will never suffer from want of\r\nexercise, if your fowls do. I never knew a case of gout in a man in the\r\npoultry business in my life. It is well, also, when arranging a poultry\r\nplant, to make provision for future contingencies, so that should one in\r\nthe course of time and experience wish to increase his plant and the\r\nsize of his buildings longitudinally he will have plenty of room to do\r\nit, by simply moving the end of his building out as far as he wishes\r\nand filling in between. I have been obliged to do this several times in\r\nthe course of my experience, and have the past Fall built a double\r\nbrooding house 250 feet long by 16 feet wide.\r\n\r\nOne important point in erecting poultry buildings is the difficulty in\r\nbuilding them,\r\n\r\n\r\nWarm, Cheap, and Rat-proof.\r\n\r\nFormerly I built stone foundations on which were placed the buildings,\r\ncementing the stone work to the sill carefully inside and out. This\r\nproved in the end not only an expensive but a very unsatisfactory\r\narrangement, for cement it as one would the action of the frost would\r\nalways part the sill from the foundation and admit the cold air from all\r\naround just where it should be kept warm. I have since hit upon a plan\r\nwhich has not only met the case but is comparatively inexpensive. Place\r\nposts, with one square side to them, about four feet apart, on which\r\nplace the 2x4 inch sill. Set these posts in the ground so that the tops\r\nrise but one inch above the surface, with the flat side exactly\r\nhorizontal and perpendicular to the inside of the sill. Then sink a\r\nhemlock board twelve or fourteen inches wide into the ground inside of\r\nthe building, and immediately in front of the two-inch sill, until the\r\nupper edge is flush with the upper side of the sill, nailing it firmly\r\nthereto, filling up inside nearly to a level of the top of the sill.\r\nThis gives a warm, cheap foundation on which the frost does not act.\r\nHemlock, too, seems to have an affinity for moisture and will last in\r\nthat condition from eight to ten years, when it can be easily renewed.\r\nThis arrangement is also comparatively rat-proof, as a hemlock board is\r\na rat's aversion. It does not agree with their teeth. They cannot\r\npossibly dig under during the frozen months of the year, and as it\r\naffords them no concealment they do not care to, during the warm season.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Outside Plan of a Breeding and Brooding House\r\n\r\nwith the exception of a little more glass in the latter, should be\r\nprecisely the same both for ducks and ducklings. The internal\r\narrangements can be made to suit. As I shall give a full description\r\nwith cuts of this building later, I will now merely give the manner in\r\nwhich it should be arranged as a good breeding-house for ducks. This\r\nbuilding should be fifteen feet wide and any length required. It should\r\nhave an uneven double roof, five-foot posts in the rear and four foot in\r\nfront. About one-quarter of this front should be glass. There should be\r\na walk the entire length of the building three and one-half feet wide.\r\nThe main body of the building should be divided into pens twenty feet\r\nlong, by either lath or wire two feet high.\r\n\r\nThe walk should be separated from the pens by laths three inches apart,\r\nto allow the birds to feed and water from the walk. This method\r\nsimplifies the labor very much, as it enables the operator to load his\r\nbarrow, travel the whole length of a 200-foot building and feed and\r\nwater 500 ducks in a few minutes. This arrangement has many other\r\nadvantages besides, as it permits the birds to feed and water readily\r\nfrom the walk without being able to waste either, or mix the contents of\r\nfood and water-dishes with filth. It also prevents the birds from\r\nsopping the straw in the bottom of their pens, or of soiling their white\r\nplumage, both of which they are bound to do if possible, and as the\r\nduck, especially the Pekin, is a very timid bird, this plan familiarizes\r\nher with the appearance of the attendant without bringing her into\r\nactual contact with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse Half the Pens for Feeding Purposes.\r\n\r\nOne-half or ten feet of the twenty-foot pens should be utilized for\r\nfeeding purposes. The lower board of this slat partition should not be\r\nmore than three inches wide and should rest upon the ground so the birds\r\ncan readily feed over it. As this ten-foot partition is but two feet\r\nhigh, the attendant can readily step over it to pick up a stray egg\r\noccasionally. Six feet of this partition should be portable and secured\r\nwith a groove or button so it can be easily removed to allow the\r\nentrance of a barrow in cleaning out the pens; this should be done when\r\nthe birds are out, never when they are in.\r\n\r\nThe remaining ten feet of the pen should be used for nest boxes, which\r\ncan be fifteen inches square and one foot high. A board four inches wide\r\nmay be fastened in front to prevent the nest material from being drawn\r\nout. This latter may be composed of finely cut hay or chaff. This must\r\nbe perfectly dry, as the duck while laying will work it all over and\r\ncover her eggs carefully, which as they are pure white, become easily\r\nsoiled and stained; this will necessitate washing unless things are kept\r\ndry and clean. This is a vital point with us, as it never did seem as if\r\na filthy egg would hatch as well as a clean one. I abominate a machine\r\nfilled with filthy eggs; it actually hurts my feelings to handle them.\r\nThese nests should be covered closely and the partition above them be\r\ncorrespondingly high, as the birds will often mount upon the boxes. The\r\nback of the nest boxes next the walk should be closed with a board\r\nhinged below so that the attendant can let it down readily and secure\r\nthe eggs from the walk.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Room for Mixing Feed.\r\n\r\nSome twelve feet of this breeding-house may be utilized as a cook and\r\nmixing room, and must necessarily be a little higher posted than the\r\nrest of the building,--say, two feet higher. This cookroom, with boiler,\r\nis an essential thing in a duck-house. Unlike hens, they do not take\r\nkindly to hard food and whole grain. Their digestive organs, in many\r\npoints, are different from the hens, and they do not assimilate hard\r\nfood readily. They require more vegetable food, and those vegetables\r\nmust be cooked,--but more about this hereafter.\r\n\r\nOf course, this building should be sweet and clean, and must be well\r\ndeodorized; for, though ducks do not generate vermin like other fowl,\r\nand are not subject to as many diseases, or as readily affected by\r\nthermal changes,--in fact, a good driving rainstorm is their\r\ndelight,--yet they will not thrive when confined in filthy quarters. It\r\nengenders a morbid appetite, impairs digestion, and your bird is poor\r\nbefore you know it. This, of course, arrests the egg production at once.\r\n\r\nI wish here to impress upon the breeder the absolute necessity of the\r\ncareful handling and feeding of his birds; and, when necessary, handle\r\nvery gently, always taking the bird by the neck. This is very essential,\r\nbecause the bones of a well-bred, well-fatted duck seem wholly\r\ndisproportioned to the size and weight of his body, and we have often\r\nseen a wing broken or a leg disjointed by the convulsive efforts of the\r\nbird to escape when caught by those members through the carelessness of\r\nthe attendant.\r\n\r\nThe timidity of the Pekin is proverbial. You should move quietly among\r\nyour layers if you would have them thrive, as constant agitation and\r\ndisquietude will surely debilitate them and reduce their flesh. I have\r\nknown a pair of heavy exhibition birds to lose a pound per day during\r\ntheir confinement the first four days of exhibition, and to be eight\r\npounds lighter than they were ten days before when started for the show.\r\nTheir recuperative powers are equally wonderful. I have often seen\r\nPekin ducks, after having produced one hundred eggs in nearly as many\r\ndays, on evincing a desire to sit, and being somewhat reduced in flesh,\r\nwhen shut up in a yard with drakes and well fed, in less than a week\r\ncommence her regular contribution of an egg per day.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater Not Needed.\r\n\r\nThe majority of people have the impression that water to bathe in is\r\nessential to secure fertility in duck eggs, but it is a great mistake.\r\nMy ducks never see water, the year round, except to drink. They are\r\nconfined in yards 24x100 feet, some forty in each yard, twenty-four feet\r\nbeing the size of the pens inside of the breeding house. They are\r\nconfined in these yards for nine months, or till August 1, when they are\r\nremoved in order that the land may be disinfected. This is done by\r\nplowing and growing a crop of barley or rye, when the land is ready for\r\nthe ducks again.\r\n\r\n\r\nFree Range Unnecessary.\r\n\r\nI am constantly experimenting to see if there are defects in my system.\r\nA few years ago I had thirty breeding-yards devoted to ducks. I wished\r\nto ascertain the difference in egg production and percentage of\r\nfertility between ducks yarded close and those with free range, the feed\r\nand other conditions being the same. One lot of fifty ducks were allowed\r\nthe range of a five-acre lot, in addition to their own yard. They ranged\r\nin common with our cows, there being plenty of grass. Another lot of\r\nseventy-five were allowed the range of the whole premises, with the same\r\nfeed and care as the eight yards confined. The latter were liberally\r\nsupplied with all the green and vegetable food needed. The egg\r\nproduction and the fertility of each were carefully noted. I was much\r\nsurprised to find that the difference was very little, and that in favor\r\nof the birds confined.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mode of Feeding.\r\n\r\ndiffers with the season of the year. During the autumn and early winter\r\nmonths feed twice each day about equal quantities of corn-meal,\r\nwheat-bran, and boiled turnips and potatoes, with about ten per cent. of\r\nground beef scrap thrown in. At noon, give a small amount of dry food,\r\ncomposed of equal quantities of cracked corn, oats, and wheat. When the\r\nbirds commence laying, as they will about January 1st, gradually\r\nincrease the quantity of meal and animal food, proportionally decreasing\r\nthe amount of bran.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pekin Duck.\r\n\r\nis my favorite. I have experimented carefully during the last thirty\r\nyears with all the larger breeds, crossing them in every conceivable way\r\nto obtain the best results, and am perfectly satisfied with the Pekins.\r\nI am now through experimenting, and as I grow nearly 20,000 ducklings\r\nyearly, can hardly afford to guess at it, as one cent per bird makes a\r\ndifference of over $200. in my receipts,--one cent per pound, a\r\ndifference of over $1200. It is readily seen that I can only afford to\r\nuse the bird that will grow the greatest number of pounds of flesh in\r\nthe shortest space of time. Nor is this all. It must be the bird that\r\nwill give you the first eggs of the season, as this will enable you to\r\nget your birds on the market when they will command the highest price,\r\nas there is more clear profit from one early bird than from three later\r\nones. This will be the more readily understood when it is known that the\r\nmaximum price paid for early birds is thirty cents per pound in Boston\r\nand New York, the minimum price for late ones eighteen cents, the cost\r\nof production being the same for both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEKIN DUCKS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pekin Combines the Best Points.\r\n\r\nThe Pekin is the only bird that will cover all these points. It has two\r\nslight defects,--its extreme timidity and its heavy, coarse voice, which\r\nit does not scruple to use when congregated in large numbers. The former\r\ncan be easily overcome by careful handling. But to off-set these defects\r\nthe Pekin will not only produce the first eggs of the season, but by far\r\nthe greatest number of any of the breeds, with one exception, the Indian\r\nRunner. They mature earlier, are more hardy and domestic in their\r\nhabits, never wandering far, and always returning to the coops at night.\r\nThey are not mischievous, and require less water than either of the\r\nother breeds.\r\n\r\nMy birds have for generations been bred in dry yards, with simply water\r\nto drink, and all desire for it for other purposes seems to have been\r\nbred out of them. When allowed their freedom in the fall, the flocks\r\nnever visit the brook, fifteen or twenty rods distant, and when driven\r\nthere occasionally for the purpose of purifying their feathers, get out\r\nagain just as soon as possible. Indeed, after a water bath their\r\nfeathers cling to their bodies, and they present the same bedraggled\r\nappearance that the old hen did many years ago after one had immersed\r\nher in a water-barrel to cure her propensity for sitting.\r\n\r\nA wealthy New Yorker ordered a dozen of my best ducks, a year or two\r\nago. In a few weeks he wrote that he wished to return them, as they did\r\nnot answer his purpose; \"for,\" said he, \"I have an artificial lake on my\r\nlawn, near my piazza, and I wanted these ducks to disport in the water\r\nfor the pleasure of my wife and children, and they will not go in the\r\nwater at all unless I drive them in with a whip, and I have to stand\r\nguard over them all the time, as they get out the moment my back is\r\nturned.\" I wrote him in return that had I known he wanted the ducks for\r\ntheir aquatic performances, I should have recommended the common puddle\r\nduck, when he would have had as much trouble to get them out of the\r\nwater as he had to get the Pekins in.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeathers are Pure White.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage of the Pekin over the other breeds is their pure\r\nwhite, elastic feathers which are largely mixed with down. These\r\nfeathers readily command from forty to fifty cents per pound, and as the\r\nreader can see, are no mean source of income, especially when the birds\r\nare grown in large numbers. These birds, as their name indicates,\r\noriginated in China. They are large, beautiful birds, of a proud, erect\r\ncarriage, with pure white plumage outside. The inside feathers are\r\nslightly cream colored. The neck is long and gracefully curved; the head\r\nlong and finely shaped, with a full bright eye. The legs and beak are of\r\na very dark orange, and form a fine contrast to the pure white\r\nfeathers. The minimum weight of our birds when matured is about fourteen\r\npounds per pair, while the very heaviest will tip the scales at\r\ntwenty-two pounds. My first experience with ducks commenced more than\r\nforty years ago. We used the common puddle ducks and grew them for the\r\ncity market. The ducks were very small and so were the profits. They\r\nwere fed but little and allowed full range, consequently the home ties\r\nwere not strong.\r\n\r\nThose ducks followed the little brook in the pasture through swamps and\r\nmarshes for half a mile in either direction, wholly regardless of farm\r\nlimits. If we expected any eggs from those ducks they should have been\r\nsafely housed at night. This task devolved upon the boys. Now our\r\npaternal head, though a kind and indulgent parent (unfortunately for\r\nus), had the impression that boys were made to work, and work we did.\r\nNow, what boy of ten or twelve years had not rather chase ducks through\r\nthe mud in the swamp than to wield the hoe among the weeds in the corn\r\nfield? It was our recreation, our chief solace and delight through those\r\nlong, hot summer days--the anticipation of that duck hunt in the\r\nevening. I think our extraordinary love for the duck hailed from this\r\ndate. Later on we used a cross between a Rouen and Cayuga. This cross\r\nmade a much larger and better market bird. The flesh was better\r\nflavored. They produced more eggs and began earlier in the spring,\r\nconsequently prices and profits slightly improved.\r\n\r\nThese birds did not stray as far, but were as fond of mud and water as\r\ntheir little predecessors. It was a pleasing and comical sight to see\r\nthree or four hundred of these ducklings of all ages, when first let out\r\nin the morning, run down the hill in their eager haste to reach the\r\nswamp, a part of them right side up, then rolling over and over on their\r\nbroadsides; others still reversing themselves end for end down the\r\nsteep incline, apparently a matter of supreme indifference how, so long\r\nas they reached the mud first.\r\n\r\nThese ducklings always returned at night with their numbers more or less\r\ndepleted, as they were the legitimate prey of skunks, minks, weasels and\r\nmud turtles; and if we reached the summer's end with sixty per cent. of\r\nthe original number we were well satisfied. All this has been changed.\r\nWe have learned a number of points on duck culture since then. First,\r\nthat all losses by vermin can be easily avoided by yarding your little\r\nbirds at home and keeping them under your own eye. Second, that mud and\r\nwater externally applied are not essential to their growth and\r\nwell-being, and that in fact they will thrive better without.\r\n\r\n\r\nReady for Market 3 Months Earlier.\r\n\r\nThird, that it is not necessary to keep your birds till they are six\r\nmonths old in the fall and then put them on the market when it is sure\r\nto be glutted, but much better to market them at ten weeks, when they\r\nare nearly as heavy, and you are sure to get more than double the price,\r\nas well as save three or four months extra feed. There are many other\r\npoints connected with this thing which the novice must ponder carefully\r\nbefore he begins, as a slight mistake in the beginning often means a\r\ngreat loss in the end. As pioneers in the business we have for many\r\nyears been carefully experimenting with the different breeds, different\r\ntreatment and variety of food. We have met with many failures, suffered\r\nsome loss, but with a gradual improvement through it all, which has been\r\nvery encouraging to us, and though we do not claim perfection, yet we\r\nare now reaping a rich harvest compared to which our former losses are\r\nsimply insignificant. It is a source of gratification to know that\r\nsuccess has at last crowned our efforts.\r\n\r\nWhen we look back forty years--when year after year chronicled failure\r\nand our best efforts met with loss--when we were the butt, ridicule, and\r\nlaughing stock of the whole community; when we were assured again and\r\nagain that we were fighting against nature and never could succeed, and\r\nrepeated failures only seemed to confirm that assertion,--and compare it\r\nwith the present, when we can grow our birds by the thousands, regulate\r\nthe growth, control the mortality, and grow flesh or feathers at will;\r\nhave shortened the precocity, increased fecundity, and even educated the\r\nbirds to an aversion for water, which was formerly their home; we have\r\ncompletely reversed the order of things and taught our birds to\r\nreproduce at a season of the year when all nature is against them, we\r\ncan safely feel the victory is won. We hope that our readers will not\r\nonly benefit by the experience we shall present, but that many of them\r\nwill be able to take this and carry it on where, according to the\r\nnatural course of things, we shall be obliged to leave it. We are no\r\nlonger young, the infirmities and decrepitude of age are slowly creeping\r\nupon us and admonish us that our days of research are nearly over, and\r\nwe find that our life is all too short. But there is a satisfaction in\r\nknowing that others will take this thing up where we leave off and carry\r\nit on to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Superiority of Artificial Poultry Growing.\r\n\r\nWe predict a great future for artificial poultry growing. It is yet in\r\nits infancy. The time will come when it will gradually supersede many of\r\nthe regular farm crops on the sterile soil of New England, when every\r\nfarmer will have his proper complement of poultry appliances, and when\r\nyou can prove to the average farmer that the capital necessary to run a\r\npoultry plant (which will with less labor ensure him a greater income\r\nthan that from his whole farm) is less than one-fourth of that required\r\nfor any other farm investment. You will begin to see him scratch his\r\nhead to evolve ideas. The beginner in starting, should recollect that\r\nthis is a business of detail and that small things must be taken into\r\naccount. It is not only a very essential thing to choose the best\r\nbreeding stock that can be had, but, all other conditions being the\r\nsame, to select the color of their feathers.\r\n\r\nWe have always had a predilection in favor of white birds, for the\r\nfeathers (which are no small item in ducks) command nearly double the\r\nprice of colored ones, and are always more saleable. Again, we must\r\ncater for the market with young birds, and every one knows that young\r\nbirds are more or less addicted to pinfeathers, many of which it is very\r\ndifficult to remove, as they have secured a lodgment just under the\r\nskin, but have not found their way through. Now a dark pinfeather is a\r\nblot upon the fair surface of a fine chicken or duck, and the thrifty\r\nhousewife in selecting her dinner will always leave the pins behind. She\r\ndoes not like a variety of colors in her duckling, if she does in her\r\ndress. The dealer, aware of this peculiarity of the ladies (who, by the\r\nway, form a large share of his customers) will, if he buys at all, cut\r\nyou on the price.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we started in with dark birds, but it did not matter at\r\nthat time, as the Pekin had not been imported, and there were very few\r\nAylesburys in the country. We were surrounded by vermin of all kinds.\r\nOur young birds disappeared mysteriously, and in such large numbers that\r\nwe were nearly discouraged. Hawks do not trouble ducks, but rats,\r\nweasels and minks developed such a fondness for them as to completely\r\natone for any neglect on their part. We made a free use of steel traps,\r\nguns, and phosphoretic poison. The battle raged for two years; at the\r\nend of that time I think it would be difficult to find one of the\r\nabove-mentioned vermin one-fourth of a mile from the place. It was a\r\ngreat relief; our ducklings could range at will, even be left out during\r\nthe night, and still the full complement appear at the dough-troughs in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo Not Have Neighbors Too Near.\r\n\r\nAnother source of discomfort was our neighbors' cats. Now, we are\r\neminently social in our disposition, and enjoy our neighbors' company\r\nvery much. We like to spend a social evening with them and have them do\r\nthe same by us. But not so their cats. We never interchanged civilities\r\nwith them, their visits were too ill timed and frequent. Our ducklings\r\nwere carried off in large numbers, and in pure self-defense we shot the\r\ncats.\r\n\r\nOf course, this made trouble in our neighbors' families, especially the\r\nfemale portion, by whom it was promptly resented. The principle of\r\n\"touch my dog, touch me,\" was illustrated here in all its force. No\r\namount of provocation ever justified us in their eyes in killing their\r\ncats. With pater familias it was different. His affections were not\r\nengaged. He recognized the necessity of the thing, laughed it off, and\r\nsaid it was all right. Now, cats breed fast and are very prolific, and\r\nour neighbors were plenty, and we are unwilling to state the amount of\r\nour losses from those sources, for fear our veracity would be doubted.\r\nWe endured this sort of annoyance for some twelve years, but made up our\r\nminds that if we ever selected another poultry ranch we would locate our\r\nneighbors at a distance. We have done so, and now have no trouble from\r\nthis source.\r\n\r\nWe found that the Cayuga duck was a more precocious bird than the Rouen,\r\nand were better layers. The eggs were more fertile. They were also much\r\nhardier, and, as a consequence, there was less mortality among the\r\nyoung. But they were rather small in size, dressing only seven to nine\r\npounds per pair. The Rouens were nearly four pounds heavier, but had\r\ntheir disadvantages. They were not so productive in eggs, and those did\r\nnot give us the same percentage of hatch, while the mortality among the\r\nlittle ones was much greater. We do not like to condemn any variety of\r\nbirds on one trial, as we may be unfortunate in our selection of a\r\nstrain, but our subsequent experience with these birds fully confirms\r\nthe above; and though they are a large, attractive bird, we do not\r\nconsider them as hardy as either Pekin, Aylesbury or Cayuga.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAYUGA DUCKS.]\r\n\r\nWe conceived the plan of crossing this bird with the Cayuga, with a view\r\nof increasing the size, not knowing whether the good or the negative\r\nqualities of the two birds would prevail. We were very much pleased with\r\nthe results of this cross, as it gave us all the good qualities of the\r\nCayuga with the largely increased size of the Rouen. It gave us also a\r\ngood table bird, the flesh of which was far better flavored than that of\r\nthe puddle duck. We made the duck business then supplementary to that of\r\ngrowing chickens. Our chicks were hatched out early in the winter in\r\norder to secure the high prices. Our ducks during the spring and summer\r\nwere not marketed until fall. We did not expect those ducks to lay till\r\nthe first of April, and they did not disappoint us. If anyone had told\r\nus that young ducks could be made to lay at four or five months old, and\r\nthat we could have our young broods out by the thousands at that time,\r\nwe should have called him insane. We then gave our ducklings free range,\r\nand, as a consequence, lost large numbers of them from eating injurious\r\ninsects, which, in their haste, they did not stop to kill, and paid the\r\npenalty with their lives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUEN DUCKS.]\r\n\r\nNow, the genuine duckling is proverbially stupid. He has an immense\r\nfaculty for getting himself into trouble, without the first idea as to\r\nhow he shall get out. As, for instance, we had taken up some old\r\nfence-posts one day, and carelessly left the holes (some two feet deep)\r\nunfilled. When feeding time came at night we missed many of our little\r\nducklings, and, at the same time, heard a great squeaking, which we\r\ncould not locate. We finally traced it to the post-holes, which we found\r\nnearly full of young ducklings, not much the worse for the adventure.\r\nWhen we look back at the difficulties with which we had to contend, and\r\nthe losses we sustained in consequence, I often wonder that we were not\r\ndiscouraged. It was blunder after blunder, repeated always with the same\r\nresults. We had very little idea of the systematic care and regular food\r\nrequired to ensure against loss and enable the young birds to attain a\r\nweight in a few weeks which we supposed required almost as many months.\r\nWe still had the impression that water was essential to the welfare of\r\nthe birds, both old and young, and that eggs would not be fertile unless\r\ncopulation took place in the water. So we built a tank for use during\r\nthe dry season of the year (which held about a hogshead), and cemented\r\nit thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThis tank we laboriously filled with water for the birds to sport in,\r\nbut it did not work, as it soon became so offensive that we were obliged\r\nto renew it at least every three days, so that we soon became tired of\r\nit, and once more allowed the ducks the liberty of the swamp. We never\r\nobtained more than half of the number of eggs that we now get from our\r\nPekins. About this time the Aylesbury duck came under our notice, and we\r\nprocured a number of them at once, as they came highly recommended, but\r\nthey did not meet our expectations. They were a very pretty bird to look\r\nat, and their feathers were more valuable, but there the advantage\r\nended, for the strain we obtained was a trifle smaller than the mongrels\r\nwe had been breeding,--rather more delicate to rear, and, worse than\r\nall, we found it almost impossible to pick them. In all our experience\r\nbefore or since we have never seen anything to equal those birds. The\r\ntenacity of those feathers was exasperating. Every one was bound to\r\nretain its complement of flesh. Of course the birds were so disfigured\r\nthat the most of them were retained for family use. It was no use to\r\nthink of scalding them,--that would not only seriously injure the\r\nfeathers, but would completely spoil the birds for Boston market, as\r\nscalded birds are rejected at once and classed with cheap Western fowls.\r\n\r\nWhile going the rounds of Boston market one pleasant June day, shortly\r\nafter our experience with the Aylesburys, we noticed some fine young\r\nbirds nicely dressed, that had evidently snow-white plumage. As this was\r\nbefore the advent of iced poultry, we supposed the birds had come from\r\nthe regions of the far South, and our curiosity was excited. We\r\ninterviewed the dealer and was surprised to learn that the birds were\r\ngrown to the north of us, and that they were the Pekin ducks we had\r\nheard of for a year or two, but had taken no stock in. Yet here they\r\nwere in the market, while ours were toddling about at home less than\r\nhalf grown. Here was a revelation. We procured some eggs of this party,\r\nat once, and in due time hatched out sixty lively young ducklings. They\r\nwere tended with the utmost care and not one was lost. We were very much\r\ninterested in these little fellows, they were so hardy, and you could\r\nfairly see them grow. It occurred to me at this time to try and\r\nexperiment with these ducklings, keep a correct account of all food\r\nconsumed by them, and ascertain what they cost per pound when ready for\r\nmarket. The average weight was taken from the rejected drakes which we\r\ndid not need for breeding purposes, and which were culled out and sent\r\nto market at ten weeks old. We were very much surprised to find the\r\ncost to us (exclusive of the cost of eggs) was about 4-3/4 cents per\r\npound. We could hardly credit our own eyes. The calculation was made\r\nagain and again with the same result. The same calculation was made a\r\nyear later on two yards of some three hundred ducklings with a result\r\nobtained, when ready for market, of 5-1/4 cents per pound, including\r\ncost of eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AYLESBURY DUCKS.]\r\n\r\nAs I had long since left the paternal abode, and for years had ceased to\r\nsuperintend the establishments of others, and as the following\r\nexperience will be entirely my own, I shall hereafter use the personal\r\n\"I\". It is needless to say that the figures arrived at from the\r\ncalculations made of those ducks were startling. What! can I grow ducks\r\nin three months as cheaply as I can grow pork in a year, or beef in two\r\nyears, and then get six times as much per pound for it after it is\r\ngrown? Yes, if figures tell the truth. Can I afford longer to grow large\r\ncrops of fruit and vegetables, working early and late, risking frosts\r\nand drouths, making a bare livelihood, when with one-tenth part of the\r\nlabor and capital involved I can grow a crop which drouths and frosts do\r\nnot injure, and make five times as much? No! I have not had a hog on my\r\nfarm since I kept a Kemp's spreader to work over the manure, and simply\r\ngrow fruit and vegetables enough for feathered thieves and home\r\nconsumption. Another question arose: \"What shall I do with my cows?\"\r\nsome sixteen or eighteen in number, bull, young stock, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Farm.\r\n\r\nNow, I had become somewhat proud of my farm, as what man does not who\r\nhad quadrupled its increase within ten years? I was cutting yearly some\r\ntwo hundred tons of hay on less than half that number of acres, and I\r\nknew that if I sold my cows I should, in some way, be obliged to get rid\r\nof my hay and that would mean disaster to the farm. There might be no\r\ndecrease in acres, but there would be a sad diminution in the tons of\r\nhay. The result is, I keep cows for my own use. Have built two new\r\nbarns, each one hundred feet long, the basements of which are utilized\r\nfor box stalls, accommodating sixty boarding horses. These convert my\r\nhay and grain (for which I receive the market price) into manure. This\r\nis all I expect and all I get.\r\n\r\nA while ago a gentleman from New York caught me hoeing in my onion\r\npatch. He expressed his astonishment at the size of the onions. (I now\r\ngrow two or three hundred bushels yearly to supply my own and neighbors'\r\nwants, and just to keep my hand in.) Said he: \"Your land seems well\r\nadapted to this crop.\" \"Yes, I have some twenty or thirty acres that are\r\nlevel, the soil is easily worked and friable, not troubled much with\r\nmaggot, and, if properly handled, is about sure of a crop.\" \"Why don't\r\nyou put it all into onions?\" \"I cannot afford to.\" \"Why,\" said he, \"if\r\nour New York farmers had that land within twenty or thirty miles of New\r\nYork city it would be worth $1,000 an acre, and they would make it pay\r\ntwenty-five per cent. of that, too, every year.\" \"Possibly they could,\r\nbut with one-tenth of the labor and capital employed I can raise ducks\r\nenough on one acre to buy all the onions I can raise on ten. If I am\r\ngoing to increase my capital and labor in any direction I should put it\r\ninto ducks, not onions.\" He acknowledged that perhaps I was right, but\r\nat the same time thought it was poor economy to grow nothing but hay on\r\nsuch land as that.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Muscovy Duck.\r\n\r\nThe Muscovy duck as its name implies is a denizen of the Mediterranean\r\nand is a beautiful bird, quiet and inoffensive in its habits, but cannot\r\ncompare with the Pekin either in fecundity or in market value. It cannot\r\nbe induced to lay so early in the season as the Pekin, thus forfeiting\r\nthe high Spring prices. The eggs require about the same time to incubate\r\nas the goose egg (five weeks) and they do not hatch well in an\r\nincubator. It is some three weeks longer in maturing than the Pekin and\r\ndoes not command as high a price in the market by two cents per pound. I\r\nasked a prominent Boston market man yesterday the reason for it. He said\r\nthat the flesh was coarser than that of the Pekin while the disparity in\r\nthe size of the sexes made them very unpopular, for instance, while the\r\ndrake will dress from eight to ten pounds the duck will rate but four or\r\nfive pounds. Said he, \"I want none of them.\" There are two varieties of\r\nthis bird, white and colored.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Indian Runner Duck.\r\n\r\nThis bird is of recent introduction, and while it can never be a\r\nfirst-class market bird on account of its small size and dark pins, it\r\nhas many good points. Its fecundity is wonderful. There is, perhaps, no\r\nbird that will excel it as an egg producer for market. Its patrons are\r\nenthusiastic in its praise and claim an average yield of one hundred and\r\nseventy-five to two hundred eggs per year from each of their birds, but\r\ntheir small size, four to four and a half pounds, together with their\r\ndark pins, militates against their value as a market bird. I have always\r\nemphasized the point that size as well as fecundity is a necessary\r\nadjunct to a profitable market bird. It is no more trouble or risk to\r\ngrow a large bird than a small one, while the market returns are often\r\ndouble. The large bird will always command at least two or three cents\r\nper pound more than a small one, as well as a more ready sale. The\r\nRunner is a parti-colored bird.\r\n\r\nI was very much pleased with the Pekin ducks. They not only layed some\r\nweeks earlier than any other breed I had ever kept, but were precocious,\r\nmaturing earlier than either of the other breeds, excepting the Cayugas,\r\nthere being but little difference between the latter and the Pekins, but\r\nthe Pekins laying some weeks sooner, it gave us control of the early\r\nspring markets, which are by far the most profitable of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisinfecting.\r\n\r\nMy neighbors had become much interested in the business and often\r\nvisited me, and were not backward in giving their opinions. They\r\npredicted failure for me, giving as reasons that the market would soon\r\nbe glutted with so much of that kind of stuff, for poultry never could\r\nbe as good grown in that unnatural way, and that if I kept on growing\r\nthose ducks in the same yard, year after year, the land would eventually\r\nget poisoned, and then disease would clean me out.\r\n\r\nBut I had thought this thing all over before laying out my yards. I knew\r\nthat reversing land and cropping it would disinfect it, so a crop of\r\nducks is always followed by a crop of something else; and thus I succeed\r\neach season in getting two crops of ducks and two crops of either rye,\r\nbarley, or oats, so that the land has not been poisoned, and is still\r\ngrowing its complement of large, fat ducks every year, and as I have set\r\nit to plum trees, it is beginning to yield fine, luscious plums. Neither\r\nis the market glutted, as the demand is far in excess of the supply. The\r\nway of growing does not seem to be any objection, as the marketmen are\r\nwilling to pay me, at least, two to four cents per pound more than they\r\ncan possibly get for those grown in the natural way.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a word here would not be amiss regarding the merits of\r\nartificially and naturally-grown poultry for fancy and market purposes.\r\nThis is a vital question, and it is as well for the public to fully\r\nunderstand this thing now, as well as its origin. There is many a person\r\nwho has been thoroughly convinced of the great advantages and the\r\neconomy of the artificial over the natural way of doing it, and who\r\nwould gladly have started in the business, but was deterred by the\r\nprevailing opinion that artificially-grown birds were always deficient\r\nin plumage, and could never win at a show, and that the flesh was\r\ninferior for table use and could not find a ready sale. It is as well to\r\nexplode this thing now, and expose its utter fallacy. There is not a\r\nshadow of doubt but that much poor poultry has been put upon the market\r\nby people who have attempted its culture in the artificial way by\r\ngrowing hundreds of ducks and chicks in the same limited space that they\r\nformerly used for a dozen with an old hen.\r\n\r\nThese, of course, could not be otherwise than poor and the mortality\r\ngreat. Another reason: the fancy business in poultry is fast being\r\noverdone. The best breeds are now scattered far and wide over the entire\r\ncountry. There is not the demand for them that there has been, because\r\ngood birds can be obtained nearer home. Many of our old and well-known\r\nfanciers are making frantic but vain efforts to keep their business up\r\nto its former standard. They have suffered considerably from competition\r\nwith artificially-grown birds, and they roundly assert that it is an\r\nunnatural method, that the conditions are not right, that it affects the\r\ngrowth and plumage of the bird in such a manner as to preclude its ever\r\ntaking a first-class premium at our shows.\r\n\r\nNow if they can convince the public that naturally grown birds can\r\ncapture premiums, and they grow all their birds in the natural way, it\r\nis easy to see how their trade would be increased.\r\n\r\nNow, I never could see how the old hen could impart vigor to her chicks\r\nby imparting lice, or how the increased contributions of filth from the\r\nold hen, united to that from the chicks, could ever make the conditions\r\nmore favorable than that from the chicks alone. It can no longer be\r\ndenied that the artificially-grown fowls are fast coming to the\r\nfront,--a place which they already occupy in the market. Knapp Bros.,\r\nFabius, N. Y., the greatest prize winners on White Leghorns in the\r\ncountry, grow their birds artificially. We could mention many others who\r\nare doing equally well. Our own Pekin ducks have, for many generations,\r\nbeen hatched and grown artificially, and today, for size, symmetry, and\r\nbeauty of plumage they stand unrivaled in North America. They have won\r\nfirst from Canada to the Gulf, and have never been defeated. Three times\r\nduring the past ten years we have been obliged to enlarge market boxes\r\nto accommodate the increased size of our birds; and yet we have bred\r\nonly from our own stock. A number of times I have procured winning birds\r\nat the Pennsylvania and Western State Fairs, with a view to a change of\r\nblood, only to cast the birds aside on their arrival here, as I could\r\nnot breed from them without deteriorating my flock in size. If this is\r\nthe result of artificial growing and of in-breeding, I shall keep right\r\non.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn-Breeding.\r\n\r\nI have always selected the very choicest and best from the many I raised\r\nfor breeding stock, and the result has been a gradual increase of size.\r\nI have seen many persons who, from a mistaken idea of introducing new\r\nblood, have reduced both the size and quality of their stock. Let it be\r\nhere understood that a man who keeps but one drake and a few ducks is\r\nbreeding-in fast. But the one who keeps a thousand in different yards\r\ncan breed many years with impunity, because the intermingling of blood\r\nis exactly in inverse ratio to the numbers kept. I have repeatedly\r\nheard prominent marketmen in New York and Boston say that my\r\nartificially-grown poultry, both in chicks and ducks, were the best that\r\nthey ever handled.... I will endeavor to secure their signatures to that\r\neffect, as convincing proof of this, as I wish the public to know the\r\ntruth as it is.\r\n\r\nI was then breeding Pekins exclusively, and found the business while\r\ngrowing them was far more profitable than ever before, and accordingly\r\nincreased my incubating and brooding capacity, and instead of growing\r\n1,500 to 2,000 ducklings, grew from 10,000 to 20,000. This was done\r\nduring the early spring and summer, the machines and brooders being used\r\nfor early chicks during the winter. I had observed that, during my\r\nexperience with chicks, that crossing with the best breeds always made\r\nbetter layers and better market birds than either of the breeds from\r\nwhich they originated; also, that the first cross was always the best,\r\nand that continued breeding from crosses is sure to deteriorate both in\r\nsize and quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrossing.\r\n\r\nI conceived the idea of procuring some of the best stock possible of\r\nRouens, Aylesburys, Cayugas, and crossing them on the Pekins, with the\r\nobject of increasing the size and precocity. I experimented first with\r\nCayugas, and crossed both ways, using both Pekin and Cayuga drakes, and,\r\nin order to test the experiment fairly, the mongrel eggs were hatched in\r\nthe same machine, the young birds grown in the same yards, subjected to\r\nthe same care and feed, with the Pekins. The Cayuga cross was very\r\nsatisfactory, with two exceptions. They were fine, plump birds, took on\r\nfat readily, and matured as early as the Pekins, while the mortality was\r\nnot more than one per cent. on either, but we found that the skin was\r\ndark, the dark pins, when there were any, showing very plainly beneath.\r\n\r\nThese birds were sent to market in the same boxes with the Pekins. Our\r\ndealers to whom we shipped allowed us the same price for them as for the\r\nPekins, as there were but few of them, but had they all been of that\r\ncolor would have been obliged to cut them two cents per pound on the\r\nprice. This was enough for me, especially as I found that the feathers\r\ncommanded but little more than half the price of the pure white feathers\r\nof the Pekins.\r\n\r\nThe experiment, though conducted in the same manner, with the Rouens,\r\nwas somewhat different in result. There was a great loss from those\r\nmongrels. They evidently inherited the same weak constitutions of the\r\nRouens. They had not the vitality of the Pekins, while they required at\r\nleast three weeks longer to mature. This latter alone was sufficient to\r\ncondemn them for all market purposes, especially when subjected to the\r\nsame discount on dark pins and feathers as the Cayugas. This was\r\nsufficient to discard both breeds for my use as market birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAylesburys.\r\n\r\nBut I expected great things from the Aylesburys. I procured the best\r\nducks to be had in the country, while I used imported drakes from the\r\nbest prize-winners in England, and I have never yet seen those drakes\r\nequaled in size; and I was unusually careful in this experiment, because\r\nI knew that the English breeders claimed for their birds a superiority\r\nin all the points essential for a good market bird, namely, delicacy and\r\nflavor of flesh, size, precocity, and greater egg production,--laying\r\nspecial stress on their hardiness and vitality. I bred those birds clear\r\nand crossed them, carefully noting the result. Our first batch of Pekins\r\nand those crosses numbered about 300, nearly equally divided. These were\r\nmixed and confined in two yards. For the first two weeks there was no\r\nperceptible difference, when gradually the young Pekins began to outgrow\r\nthe crosses, the difference increasing with age. The former were very\r\neven in size, the latter irregular, while the mortality was as six to\r\none in favor of the Pekins. When we began to kill those birds the Pekins\r\nwere all in the market at the end of eleven weeks, while the crosses\r\nremained in the yards fully one week behind. The weight was in favor of\r\nthe Pekins about one pound per pair.\r\n\r\nThe same difficulty existed as in former years--the tenacity of the\r\nfeathers. The pickers grumbled, while the birds were more or less\r\ndisfigured. I notified the dealers of the breeds of those ducks, and of\r\nthe claim made by the English breeders, and wished them to ascertain if\r\npossible if there was any difference in favor of the Aylesburys. They\r\nsaid their customers found no preference, for themselves they preferred\r\nthe Pekins on account of the larger size and finer appearance of the\r\ndressed birds. But I found it made a vast deal more difference than that\r\nto me. One pound per pair on 2,000 pairs of ducklings, at an average\r\nprice of twenty-five cents per pound, made a difference of more than\r\n$500 to me; especially the extra ten days required to mature the\r\nAylesburys cost more than the feed for extra pound of flesh grown upon\r\nthe Pekins. I do not keep Aylesburys now, and have not since that\r\nexperiment; I never shall again.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrecocity.\r\n\r\nThere is one point which I wish to impress, which is too often\r\noverlooked, and yet is of the most vital importance to the poultry\r\ngrower, and that is the early maturity of his market birds. I often hear\r\ngrowers say that as there is very little change in the poultry market\r\nduring nine months of the year, and as they do not contend for the early\r\nspring prices anyway, if their birds are three or four weeks longer in\r\nmaturing it does not matter. Does is not? I have always contended that\r\nit requires just so much to sustain life in either bird or animal, and\r\nthe profit consists in what we can get them to consume and digest over\r\nand above that; and if the time required to do this is protracted longer\r\nthan is necessary, it is done at the expense of the grower.\r\n\r\nIf it takes ten weeks to grow five pounds of flesh on one bird and\r\nfourteen weeks on another the one must necessarily cost more than the\r\nother per pound, simply because you have to sustain life four weeks\r\nlonger in one case than in the other, and that cannot be done for\r\nnothing. That is why, though I can easily grow a pound of duck for six\r\ncents, I must have eight cents to grow a pound of chicken, because the\r\nducks will take on six pounds of flesh in ten weeks, while the chicken\r\nrequires twenty weeks to obtain the same size. These appear trivial\r\nmatters when a person grows only a few dozen fowls yearly, but when he\r\nmakes a life business of it and grows fowls by the thousands, it is of\r\nthe utmost importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst-Class Breeding Stock.\r\n\r\nThe above shows the necessity of first-class breeding stock to start\r\nwith. I do not mean fancy stock at all, as many of the points of\r\nexcellence claimed by the American standard militate directly against\r\nthe market value of the birds. A few years ago several men came here to\r\nbuy Pekin ducks for breeding stock. On looking at the birds and getting\r\nthe price, one man said: \"Those are the best birds I ever saw. I want\r\nthirty of the best birds you have.\" Another said: \"They are fine birds,\r\nbut I cannot afford to pay two dollars for a duck; have you no cheaper\r\nbirds?\" \"Yes, I have some later birds--culls from which the rest have\r\nbeen selected. They are not as large as these. My late birds never\r\nattain the size of the earlier-hatched ones, and they will not lay quite\r\nas early. You can have your choice of these at one dollar each, which is\r\nabout their market value.\"\r\n\r\nHe took those birds, and I consider when he made that choice that he\r\nthrew away more than $100 of his first season's work alone, for, with a\r\nfair share of success he might easily expect to raise 100 young birds\r\nfrom each of his breeding ducks, and as the birds he chose were at least\r\none-third lighter than those he rejected, their progeny would not be as\r\nheavy at a marketable age by at least one pound per bird. The excess in\r\ncost to him, had he bought the better birds, would have been but one\r\ncent on each of the young birds he raised. He lost, on making the choice\r\nhe did, more than twenty cents on each bird, and this is not all; those\r\nbirds will be small for generations to come. He never can get them up to\r\nthe standard of the others. They will go upon the market as small birds,\r\nand as such, command at least two cents per pound less than the larger\r\nones; in fact, his losses in this transaction will represent a large\r\nshare of the profits.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Begin.\r\n\r\nI will now suppose that the breeder has secured his stock, erected his\r\nbuilding, and is ready for business. The next thing is to feed them\r\nwell, keep them warm and comfortable, giving them as great a variety of\r\ngreen food as is obtainable during the winter months, in order to induce\r\nwinter laying and insure fertility of the eggs. This matter requires\r\nclose attention, because the profits in one week of the early market\r\nwill always equal the profits in four or five of the late. The\r\nproportion of the sexes in the early spring should be about one drake to\r\nfive or six ducks.\r\n\r\nOne point here I wish to emphasize particularly and that is in the\r\nselection of drakes. The drakes should be, at least, two months older\r\nthan the ducks, as the latter will mature some two or three months\r\nearlier and begin their egg production two or three months before the\r\ndrakes are ready for breeding. As a consequence, we always select our\r\nFebruary hatched drakes for breeding purposes.\r\n\r\nThis comes a little hard, as these birds will average to dress seven to\r\nnine pounds at ten weeks old and will always bring, at least, 30c per\r\npound at that time in the market, making them worth about $2.50 each.\r\nWould-be purchasers think we are crazy when we charge $3 each for these\r\nbirds at eight months old, expecting us to keep them for six months and\r\ncoop them for less than fifty cents.\r\n\r\nNow this selection of early hatched birds is absolutely necessary for\r\ngood profits, as early hatched, means early reproduction and these great\r\nprofits can hardly be ignored. We sold thousands of birds the past\r\nspring for 30c per pound, having almost complete control of Boston and\r\nNew York markets for at least six weeks.\r\n\r\nLater in the season, when many of the ducks are off duty from a desire\r\nto incubate, the proportion should be about one drake to ten ducks. Be\r\nparticular about this, as the eggs will be much more fertile if a part\r\nof the drakes are removed. The feeding boxes should be long and roomy;\r\nmine are 6x7 feet long, eight inches wide and three inches high. This is\r\nessential, as the birds are rapid eaters, and if there is not room, some\r\nwill gorge themselves to repletion, while others will get but little. Do\r\nnot keep food by them, as that will clog their appetites, and always\r\neffects the egg production, as well as the condition of the birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep the Feed Clean.\r\n\r\nI have often visited poultry establishments where the food was lying\r\naround in all conditions,--in troughs, on the ground, trodden upon,\r\nmixed with excrement and filth; had become sour and offensive, so that\r\nthe birds would not eat it. The attendant would go his rounds\r\nperiodically and throw more food upon the already offensive mass; the\r\nowner looking on, passively complaining that his ducks did not lay and\r\nhis ducklings would not fat.\r\n\r\nI require my men to go the rounds after feeding, and if there is any\r\nfood left, to take it up clean. If this is insisted on they will soon\r\nlearn to feed just what is required and no more. Clean feeding is of the\r\nutmost importance, both for young and old birds, as neither will thrive\r\nfrom overfeeding, as it destroys the appetite completely. Another\r\nessential thing is that ducks will not produce their proper quota of\r\nfertile eggs on hard food alone.\r\n\r\nThe natural food of the duck is principally vegetable and animal, and is\r\nobtained in brooks, puddles, swales, and consists of flag, grass roots,\r\nsmall fish, pollywogs, etc. Unlike the hen, the duck has no crop,--the\r\npassage or duct leading from the throat to gizzard direct, is very small\r\ncompared to the size of the bird. Consequently it does not assimilate or\r\nthrive on hard food. I am continually receiving letters from amateurs\r\nduring the months of March and April, complaining that their ducks do\r\nnot lay, at the same time saying that they give them all the corn they\r\nwill eat. I write back suggesting soft food, giving ingredients and\r\nproportions. In an incredibly short space of time a postal will come to\r\nhand saying, \"Thanks, my ducks are all laying.\" Success or failure in\r\nthe poultry business often date their origin from just such trivial\r\nthings as the above. So insignificant in themselves as to be entirely\r\noverlooked by the novice who, if he is persevering, will eventually\r\ndiscover both cause and remedy; but only through years of costly\r\nexperiment and a loss of valuable time which he can never recall.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Feed Breeding Ducks for Eggs.\r\n\r\nThere should be quite a distinction between feeding ducks to obtain a\r\nsupply of eggs and feeding them for market, as in one case the object\r\nis to lay on fat and the other is to furnish the most available supply\r\nof egg material. As before hinted, soft food is much more readily\r\nutilized in a duck's organization than a hen's. We make a habit of\r\nturning out our breeding ducks to pasture during the moulting season,\r\nhousing them in the fall according to the nature of the season, say,\r\nfrom the middle of November to the first of December. We feed soft food\r\nmorning and evening composed largely of bran with a little meal, keeping\r\nthem purposely short to induce them to forage for themselves, but when\r\nthe birds are housed this is all changed.\r\n\r\nThey are then fed on equal parts of corn meal, wheat-bran and low-grade\r\nflour, with about twelve or fifteen per cent. of animal food. One fourth\r\nof this food should be composed of vegetables cooked--say, small\r\npotatoes, turnips, etc., with all the green rye and refuse cabbage they\r\nwill eat. We feed this compound morning and evening with a little corn,\r\nwheat and oats at noon. Feed all the birds will eat clean and no more.\r\nThe birds, young and old, may be expected to lay in three weeks from the\r\ntime they are housed. This part of the thing seems to be under perfect\r\ncontrol. You turn in the proper variety of food and they cannot help\r\nturning out a generous supply of eggs.\r\n\r\nThe fertility however, cannot, at this season of the year be so\r\nperfectly controlled, as the standard of fertility in the first eggs is\r\napt to be very low, but soon comes to a high point. The fecundity of\r\nthese birds is wonderful. As a general thing each bird can be depended\r\nupon for 140 eggs each season, and as the eggs always command from 5 to\r\n10 cents per dozen more than those from hens it makes the Pekin ducks\r\nmore profitable for eggs alone than any other fowl.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncubators.\r\n\r\nWith the necessary buildings constructed and the stock selected, the\r\nnext thing required is the incubator, for I do not suppose the modern\r\npoultry grower is going to do his incubating with hens, for the simple\r\nreason that he cannot afford to. Hens show no desire to incubate when\r\nyou want them to the most, or in time to command the high prices for\r\nducks and chicks in the early spring, and this is attended with a loss\r\nof at least one-half of the season's profits.\r\n\r\nI often have letters filled with questions concerning incubators. Which\r\nis the best incubator? Can a person of ordinary intelligence run one\r\nsuccessfully? Do they require watching during the night? Is there an\r\nincubator in the market today that will hatch as well as the average\r\nhen? and many more of like import. To the first I would say that modesty\r\nforbids a candid answer. There are objections to many machines, though\r\nthe same do not apply to all. It does not become me to mention their\r\nfailings. But first of all do not buy a cheap incubator, as the\r\nconditions to which the material of an incubator is exposed are of the\r\nseverest kind. It must be exposed constantly to a temperature of 103\r\ndegrees, and that in an atmosphere surcharged with moisture; and unless\r\nthe material of which the machine is constructed is of the choicest\r\nkind, well kiln-dried and put together, the chances are that it will\r\nwarp out of shape, admit drafts of air and injure, if not destroy, the\r\nregulation.\r\n\r\nI do not think an incubator can ever be complete unless it is a\r\ndouble-cased machine. It requires that to effectually resist thermal\r\nchanges. Years of careful experiment, and of experience in the\r\ncompetitive show room have convinced me of the truth of this. Extreme\r\ncold will affect the uniformity of heat in the egg-chamber of\r\nsingle-cased machines. Imagine if you can a single-cased machine\r\nconstructed of five-eighth inch stuff, with a temperature of 103 degrees\r\ninside, and that of freezing outside. How can the eggs at the extreme\r\ncorners and the thin cold sides of that machine be as warm as those in\r\nthe centre? Of course that difference does not exist in warm weather,\r\nbut that is the time when incubators are usually let alone and the\r\nbusiness is given up to the old hen. Now, I say this frankly, as much\r\nfor the benefit of incubator manufacturers as for their customers. I\r\nhave letters every day from parties ordering circulars and saying that\r\nthey have used from one to three machines of different makes, denouncing\r\nthe machines and their makers in the most emphatic terms as frauds. Now,\r\nthis is all wrong; one-half of the time you will find that it is the\r\npurchasers, not the makers, who are at fault. There are probably just as\r\nmany honest incubator makers as there are in any other branch of\r\nbusiness. But there is such a thing as a man being honest and yet\r\nignorant.\r\n\r\nMany of the manufacturers of incubators know very little about the first\r\nprinciples of artificial incubation. They have the idea that a simple\r\nheat regulator is all that is necessary to insure the success of an\r\nincubator, when in reality it is only one of the many requirements. I\r\nwill enumerate some of the most essential points, viz.: heat regulation;\r\nuniformity of heat in egg-chamber; absolute control of heat by the\r\noperator on any given egg-tray; automatic moisture supply; accurate\r\nthermometers; thorough construction and good material to avoid warping\r\nand shrinkage, together with a safe lamp adjustment.\r\n\r\nThere are many other minor points which will come up with care of\r\nmachines. I am often asked, \"Why do so many fail to hatch with\r\nincubators?\" I will answer by saying: \"Not because it is difficult; for\r\nI have always found it a far more difficult thing to grow ducks and\r\nchicks successfully after they are hatched, than it is to hatch them.\"\r\nDoubtless everyone knows that an incubator, different from other\r\nmachines, must run three weeks continually night and day, (and when\r\nfilled with duck eggs, four weeks,) and preserve an even temperature all\r\nthe while.\r\n\r\nSome machines as described above, are not adapted to this business, and\r\nsome men are not adapted to the use of machines even when they are good\r\nones. They are not willing to bestow the little but intelligent and\r\nregular care required, and many times during the four weeks they will\r\nforget some of the most essential points, such as replenishing their\r\nlamps, or forget to attach the extinguishers, thus depriving the machine\r\nof all self-control, or they neglect to trim the lamps for days, and\r\nperhaps a week, allowing the wick to crust and the heat to decrease.\r\nOthers of nervous temperament will open their machines every fifteen\r\nminutes during the day and get up many times during the night to do the\r\nsame thing, necessarily creating a great variation in the temperature of\r\nthe machine. Now, all these, when repeated often enough, mean disaster\r\nand grief. One man who had been very successful, said he liked the\r\nhatching very well, but there was too much confinement growing chicks\r\nand ducks, and he was not going to make a slave of himself any longer.\r\n\r\nAnother very young man who has been uniformly successful, and is running\r\nfour large machines, said that the hatching and care of incubators was\r\nnothing, as he simply looked at his machines twice per day, but that the\r\ncare of chicks and ducks was hard work; but there was more money in it\r\nthan anything else he could do, and he should stick to it. Another man,\r\nbecause his machine did not run to suit him, threw his boot at it,\r\nknocking the regulation all off, which he called upon me to duplicate.\r\n(This man has done better since and increased the number of his\r\nmachines). So the reader will see that there are cranks even among the\r\npoultry men, and that many of them enter the poultry business simply\r\nbecause they are looking for an easy job,--a sad mistake on their part.\r\nI have always noticed that the man who knows the least, but is willing\r\nto acquire knowledge and follow instructions implicitly, is the man who\r\ngenerally succeeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest Place for Incubators.\r\n\r\nHaving secured a good machine, the next thing is to locate it where it\r\nwill give you the least trouble to run it, and at the same time do you\r\nthe most good. The best place for this is either in a barn or house\r\ncellar or in some building partly under ground, for obvious reasons.\r\nThough a good machine can be regulated to run in any temperature\r\n(provided it can generate heat enough), yet constant thermal changes of\r\n30 or 40 degrees between night and day will necessitate regulating to\r\nmeet them,--as the amount of flame required to run a machine in a\r\ntemperature of 40 degrees, will be far in excess of that needed to run\r\nit in one of 70 degrees, for, though the change will be very slow in a\r\nnicely packed double cased machine, yet in time even that change will\r\naffect.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, could be easily overcome with a little care, yet it is\r\njust as well to avoid all unnecessary care and trouble in the beginning;\r\nthere will be still enough left to keep you thinking. In a common\r\nbuilding above ground during the winter months it will often freeze\r\naround your machine, and in turning eggs in a freezing atmosphere do it\r\nas quickly as you can, as it will always cool your eggs perceptibly,\r\nand more or less derange the temperature of your machine. This is of\r\ncourse decidedly injurious and will more or less impair the hatch. Now,\r\nthis is a very important matter, and people do not give it sufficient\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nIt is even advocated by some incubator manufacturers, that eggs should\r\nbe cooled every day to 70 degrees, for the simple reason that the old\r\nhen does. They do not take into consideration that it is a necessity for\r\nthe old hen, but may not be for the embryo chick. When the hen leaves\r\nher eggs to feed, and they become partially cold, when she recovers them\r\nand brings those eggs in immediate contact with the rapidly-pulsating\r\narteries of her body, in fifteen minutes they have acquired their normal\r\nheat. With the machine it will require an hour or two.\r\n\r\nTo meet this difficulty, suitable instructions should be given with and\r\nto suit different machines. Where the eggs are turned automatically\r\ninside the machine, it is necessary that they should be cooled at least\r\nonce a day during the last two weeks of the hatch. Taking the eggs out\r\nto turn twice each day, as in the Monarch, cools them sufficiently\r\nduring the winter months; in warm weather, leaving the outside and\r\ninside doors open while turning cools them sufficiently.\r\n\r\nSome incubator manufacturers will tell you that thermal changes, however\r\ngreat, will not affect their machines. Their patrons tell a different\r\nstory. No machine was ever made, or ever will be, that will run as well\r\nor give as good results amid constant thermal changes as in an even\r\ntemperature. It is true that they reduce the heat, but it is by\r\nadmitting large draughts of air, running off the moisture and completely\r\ndestroying the humidity of atmosphere in their machines. Then, how about\r\nthose little ducklings which have been pipped forty-eight hours? They\r\ncan never get out unless you help them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuitable Buildings.\r\n\r\nMany insurance companies object to incubators being run in buildings\r\ncovered by their policies, and will often cancel them. This originated\r\nfrom the fact that so many fire-traps, which were thrust upon the public\r\nin the shape of incubators, had consumed the buildings in which they\r\nwere operated. The insurance companies were obliged in self-defence to\r\nprohibit their use in insured buildings. But the interdiction is usually\r\nremoved upon the representation that the machine is safe. Sometimes a\r\nslight premium is exacted. In the event of insurance companies being\r\nobdurate, it is very easy to excavate a place in a side hill, or on\r\nlevel ground. Stone it up five feet high at the sides. It is not\r\nnecessary to dig more than two or three feet deep, as the excavated dirt\r\ncan be used to bank up with on the outside. Upon this stone-work put a\r\nsimple roof. I use a building of this description. The original cost,\r\nexclusive of labor, was $15. It was large enough for two machines. My\r\nnew incubator room is ten times as large, but the cost was in\r\nproportion.\r\n\r\nThis building never freezes in winter, and is always some ten or fifteen\r\ndegrees colder than the outside temperature in summer, making a very\r\nhandy place to keep eggs for incubating purposes. It is well to run your\r\nmachine a few days and get the control of it. The next thing is to fill\r\nit with fresh fertile eggs. In the winter time, if one does not have\r\neggs himself, this is sometimes a very difficult thing to do, for the\r\neggs must not only be fresh, but fertile. The young beginner is often\r\nobliged to depend upon others for his eggs when first starting in the\r\nbusiness, but the poulterer, as a rule, cannot afford to do this,\r\nbecause he can grow them a good deal cheaper than he can buy; and not\r\nonly this, and what is more to the point, he, by proper care and feed\r\nduring the winter months, can make his own eggs a great deal more\r\nfertile than any he can buy of others. Usually about one-third of our\r\nnovices go right to the stores and purchase eggs to fill their machines\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR INCUBATOR HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nThis is running a great risk, especially during the winter months, but\r\nwill give the reader an idea of the amount of knowledge that many of our\r\nwould-be poultry men have acquired to begin with, and when he knows that\r\nthe incubator has to shoulder all these mistakes, he will naturally have\r\na little sympathy for the maker. Several years ago I sold a six\r\nhundred-egg machine to a lady, who, on receiving it, filled it promptly\r\nwith eggs obtained from the grocers. Now, as this was in the month of\r\nDecember, it was, to say the least, an exceedingly doubtful operation.\r\nAs she only got about forty chicks she was naturally very much\r\ndissatisfied, and strongly denounced both the machine and the maker. Her\r\nhusband suggested that possibly the machine was not to blame, and that\r\nthe eggs might have something to do with it. They went to the grocer to\r\nenquire about it. He told them that he had had some of those eggs on\r\nhand for several weeks, and that they had been exposed to the cold and\r\nfreezing weather, and that probably the farmers from whom he had\r\nobtained them had held them for high prices.\r\n\r\nThey found on enquiry that this was the case, and one party especially,\r\nwho kept a large number of hens, and from whom he had collected the\r\nlargest share of his eggs, kept no \"crowers\" with his hens. This threw\r\nsome light on the subject, and stock on that incubator went up at once.\r\nThe next time she had parties save their eggs for her, taking them in\r\nseveral times each day. She then obtained a hatch of ninety per cent,\r\nand was uniformly successful afterwards, getting out some 3,000 chicks\r\nand ducks during the season with her machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Keep Eggs for Incubation.\r\n\r\nThe above is only one case out of many that are constantly taking place.\r\nIn nine cases out of ten, failure with good machines may be traced\r\ndirectly to the operator or the eggs. Occasionally there is a defect in\r\na machine overlooked by the maker, which he is in honor bound to make\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThe best way to secure good eggs is to engage them beforehand from\r\nreliable parties, who will gather them carefully several times each day\r\nin cold weather to prevent them chilling, and turn them at least every\r\nother day. If these eggs are kept on end it is not necessary to turn\r\nthem as often.\r\n\r\nI have egg boxes for the purpose, in which the eggs are set on end, like\r\nthe common market box. These boxes and contents can be turned as readily\r\nwith a dozen as when full. Eggs intended for incubation should always be\r\nkept in a cool place,--duck eggs especially,--as the fertile eggs will\r\nchange at a temperature of eighty-five to ninety degrees, and spoil\r\nwithin three or four days. One may safely calculate on one-half of them\r\nbeing spoiled in a week at a temperature of 80 degrees. All kinds of\r\neggs can be safely kept three weeks for purposes of incubation, say, at\r\nforty-five to fifty degrees, though I always like to have them as fresh\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nIn filling orders for eggs at a distance I make it a point never to send\r\neggs more than four days old, or with less than seventy-five per cent of\r\nfertility. Transportation, even over rough roads, does not affect their\r\nhatching, except in extreme warm weather, when the contents, becoming\r\nthin and slightly evaporated through the heat, are apt to mix, when they\r\nwill surely cloud and rot. I have often sent eggs 2,000 miles, with the\r\nreport that every egg produced a duckling. With machine ready and\r\nrunning steadily the eggs may be introduced at once. They need no\r\nmoisture now, and it is not necessary to disturb them for the first\r\nforty-eight hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Choose and Use Thermometers.\r\n\r\nPlace your thermometer on the eggs in middle of egg-tray. Be sure, in\r\nthe first place, that you get a good glass, as all depends upon its\r\naccuracy. Do not use one with the mercury bulb lying upon a solid metal\r\nplate, as the refraction of heat upon the plate from the tank above will\r\nalways run that glass one or two degrees higher than the heat in the\r\negg-chamber, but get one, if possible, with a hole in the plate opposite\r\nthe bulb, so that the heat can play around the bulb and through the\r\nplate, giving the correct heat of eggs and chamber. Do not hang your\r\nglass up over the eggs, or put it down between the eggs, but lay it on\r\nthem, for the reason that, though either of these positions may be all\r\nright during the first twelve days of the hatch (if your eggs are\r\nfertile), they will surely be all wrong during the last part.\r\n\r\nI will endeavor to explain this thing, so that the novice will\r\nunderstand how important it is. Before circulation begins in the embryo\r\nchick or duck, and there is no animal heat in the egg, the temperature\r\nof the egg chamber regulates that of the eggs. But after circulation\r\nbegins, and especially during the latter part of the hatch, when the\r\nrapidly-developing young bird throws out a great deal of heat, the thing\r\nis often completely reversed. For instance, a glass may be hung one inch\r\nabove the eggs and another placed immediately on the eggs beneath. The\r\none above may register 102 degrees; the one below, on the eggs, will\r\nregister 105 degrees,--conclusively showing that the eggs are now, by\r\ntheir own caloric, heating the egg-chamber.\r\n\r\nI have often, during the last part of a hatch, when the thermometer was\r\nranging from 70 to 80 degrees outside of machine, placed a glass on the\r\nhottest part of the boiler, where but one lamp was dimly burning,\r\ncarefully covering the glass. In that position it would register perhaps\r\n96 to 98 degrees, while a glass inside the machine, and on the eggs,\r\nwould register 103 degrees, proving beyond a doubt that the eggs, by\r\ntheir own caloric, were not only heating the egg-chamber, but\r\ncontributing their quota towards heating the water in the tank. Now, who\r\nwill pretend to say that a glass hanging above the eggs will give the\r\ncorrect heat of the egg after circulation begins. So that, even in cold\r\nweather, the amount of oil consumed during the last week of the hatch is\r\nless than half the amount required during the first part.\r\n\r\nThe operator must not expect the eggs to heat up at once. On the\r\ncontrary, they will cool the air in the egg-chamber very sensibly,\r\nthough they will not affect the heat of the water in the tank. It will\r\nbe from five to eight hours before they arrive at their normal heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Turn Eggs.\r\n\r\nAt the end of forty-eight hours they may be turned. This should be done\r\nby gathering up the eggs at the end of egg-tray and placing them upon\r\nthe eggs in centre of the tray, rolling the centre ones back to the end\r\nof the tray. The tray should be reversed, and the same thing done to the\r\nother end. It is not necessary that the eggs should be completely\r\nreversed,--simply change the position, rolling over one-half or\r\none-third.\r\n\r\nThe egg-trays should always be turned end for end, and changed from end\r\nto centre of machine. This is necessary in case there should not be a\r\nuniform heat in egg-chamber, as it will equalize matters, and, in a\r\nmeasure, obviate the difficulty. Now, all this, though it takes some\r\ntime to describe it, can be done very quickly, requiring only a few\r\nmoments for each machine. I usually allow about ten minutes for each\r\n1,000 eggs, though it can be done much quicker if one is in a hurry. I\r\nam often requested by people to put in patent automatic egg-turning\r\ntrays in my machines, it would so simplify matters. I reply:\r\n\r\n\"So it would; and when you can produce a machine with a perfect\r\nuniformity of heat in the egg-chamber, I should be most happy to use an\r\nautomatic tray, but I have never yet seen that machine.\" In our own\r\ndouble-cased Monarch, in cold weather, there is at least one degree\r\ndifference between the end and centre of egg-tray. In single-cased\r\nmachines this difference must be largely increased, and in automatic\r\ntrays the eggs must necessarily remain where they are placed through the\r\nentire hatch. Now, under these conditions, if the heat is right in the\r\ncentre of trays it must be all wrong in the ends. The hatch will be\r\nprotracted long after the proper time, and if those on the ends of trays\r\ncome out at all it will be forty-eight hours behind time and with\r\nweakened constitutions, keeping one in constant stir with their sickly\r\nplaints. It is needless to say that there is a great mortality among\r\nbirds of that description, and at the end of ten days they are usually\r\namong the things that were.\r\n\r\n\r\nHatching the Eggs.\r\n\r\nThe next thing is testing the eggs. This matter is essential as well as\r\neconomical, with both hens and incubators. I once knew a man who ran a\r\nsix hundred-egg machine for three weeks on one fertile egg. The other\r\n599 proved infertile, and he did not know it until they refused to hatch\r\nat the end of three weeks--a great waste of oil, but a greater waste of\r\ntime,--three whole weeks in the best part of the season. Another man\r\nkept forty hens sitting three weeks with an average of one fertile egg\r\nto each bird, when three of them could have done all the hatching just\r\nas well, and then, at the end of four days, could have had the rest put\r\nupon better eggs.\r\n\r\nA great waste of hen power, you will say, with time lost, together with\r\nforty dozen eggs, which would have been just as good for table use had\r\nthey been tested out in four days. It often happens in the winter, when\r\neggs are apt to be infertile, that, after testing the contents of four\r\ntrays, they can be contained in three, when the other can be filled with\r\nfresh eggs. Here is where the advantage of adjustable trays comes in.\r\nOften the operator running a large machine has not eggs enough to fill\r\nit without a part of the eggs becoming very old, and also losing ten or\r\ntwelve days of valuable time; with the adjustable tray, eggs can be\r\nintroduced at any time, and the same heat preserved on all. I usually\r\ntest duck eggs at the end of the third day. The fertile germ is then\r\nplainly visible, and the eggs can be passed before the light, several at\r\na time.\r\n\r\nThe novice had better postpone the operation till the fourth day, when\r\nhe, too, will have no trouble in detecting the germ. The same rule will\r\nhold good with all white eggs, but dark-brown eggs should not be tested\r\ntill the sixth or seventh day. This can be done much sooner, but a large\r\nmachine full cannot be tested in a minute, and the eggs should be far\r\nenough advanced so that the operator can take two or three in his hand\r\nat once, and passing them before the flame, readily detect the germ. I\r\nnever use a tester for duck eggs, as a simple flame is sufficient, the\r\negg being translucent.\r\n\r\nDuring the first stages of incubation the germ is very distinct, even at\r\nthe third day. The clear eggs are reserved for family use or disposed of\r\nto bakers. An expert cannot distinguish them from a fresh-laid egg,\r\neither in taste or appearance. There is usually a small percentage of\r\nthe eggs that are slightly fertilized, in which the germ will die during\r\nthe second or third day. These can be readily detected at the end of the\r\nfifth day, and should be taken from the machine, and reserved as food\r\nfor the young ducklings. Another and potent reason why all infertile\r\neggs, and those with dead chicks in them, should be taken out of the\r\nmachine, is that after the circulation begins in the egg, especially\r\nduring the last part of the hatch, the temperature of a live egg is\r\nseveral degrees higher than that of a dead one. The one radiates heat,\r\nthe other absorbs it; so that if the operator is running his machine 102\r\ndegrees, with his glass on a dead egg, he may be all unconsciously\r\nrunning it at 104 or 105 degrees on a live one.\r\n\r\nI had a letter from a man some time ago stating that his thermometers\r\nwere developing strange freaks,--that though they registered the same\r\nwhile in water, at 103 degrees, when lying on the eggs a few inches from\r\neach other in the machine, they were several degrees apart, and wishing\r\nto know by which he should run, the higher or lower. I wrote him that\r\nhis glasses were all right, and that he was the one at fault, and had he\r\nfollowed instructions and tested his eggs he would have had no such\r\ntrouble. He wrote that as his machine was not quite full, and as he had\r\nplenty of room, he neglected to test them, thinking it would make no\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nI do not propose here to give my experience, together with the many\r\nexperiments made during the last twenty years, but shall aim to give\r\nthe reader simple instructions for hatching and growing ducks for market\r\nand selection of breeding stock. I would say here that the first thing\r\nfor the operator to learn in turning the eggs is to do it carefully and\r\nwell, without breaking or unnecessarily jarring them; and then, to do it\r\nas quickly as possible, especially if done in a cold atmosphere, so as\r\nnot to derange the heat in the egg-chamber. The next thing is to\r\nmaintain as even a temperature as possible during the hatch. I do not\r\nthink that a variation of one degree is at all detrimental. But\r\ndifferent people have different ideas of regularity. A man who did not\r\nhave a first-class hatch, wrote me that he had kept the machine right to\r\nbusiness, as it had run between 90 and 110 degrees during the entire\r\nhatch. Another man wrote that his machine had been as low as 100\r\ndegrees, and once up to 103 degrees, and wishing to know if I thought it\r\nwould be fatal to his hatch.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as accuracy in the composition of some men,\r\nthings are run \"hap-hazard,\" failure and misfortune are always\r\nattributed to conditions, circumstances, or hard luck,--never to\r\nthemselves,--and in case of a poor hatch, always the incubator.\r\nInstructions go for nothing with them. An enterprising incubator maker\r\ntold me one day that he believed that the world was composed of cranks\r\nand fools (at least the poultry part of it). The one-half did not know\r\nanything, while the other half had all that was worth knowing and\r\ndespised all instructions and common-sense.\r\n\r\nIn running your machine, the first step is to set it level and see that\r\nthe glasses register alike in both ends of the machine. Next, procure\r\ngood oil, 150 test (as poor oil will necessitate frequent trimming,\r\nbesides crusting the wick). Do not use more flame than is necessary, as\r\nit will only be a waste of oil, and with some machines will increase\r\nthe ventilation, and at the same time decrease the moisture. Be regular\r\nin both filling lamps and trimming them, as irregularity frequently\r\ninvolves forgetfulness, and that sometimes means disaster to the hatch.\r\nIn trimming, it is well to turn on the same amount of flame in\r\nrelighting your lamp as it had previously.\r\n\r\nIn the Monarch Incubator this required amount can readily be seen at\r\nonce by the action of the regulating bar. It informs the operator just\r\nwhen he has enough,--when too much and when too little. Keep both lamps\r\nand chimneys clean, and have stated periods for turning your eggs, which\r\nshould be done twice each day. As I said before, an egg-tester is not\r\nrequired with duck eggs, as they are so transparent that the whole\r\nprocess can be plainly seen without in the flame of a common kerosene\r\nlamp. If a duck egg is carefully examined, after being subjected to a\r\nheat of 102 degrees for twenty-four hours, a small dark spot will be\r\nseen about the size of a large pin-head. This little spot, if the egg is\r\ngradually turned, will always float over the upper surface of the egg.\r\nThis is the life germ, and the first indication of fertility in the egg,\r\nand is represented in Figure 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 1.--SHOWING FIRST INDICATION OF FERTILITY.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of forty-eight hours this dark spot will have nearly doubled\r\nits size, and a faint haze will appear around its edges a shade darker\r\nthan the surrounding contents of the egg. This haze is the first\r\nappearance of the blood veins radiating out from the germ.\r\n\r\nFigure 2 shows how the egg appears at this stage with the air-cell\r\nslightly enlarged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2.--EGG AT END OF 48 HOURS.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third day the dark spot, which is the heart of the\r\nembryo duck, can still be seen; but not so distinctly, because a dark\r\ncircle some three-quarters of an inch in diameter will now appear in the\r\nupper surface of the egg, in the centre of which the dark spot is\r\nvisible. This circle is several shades darker than the rest of the egg,\r\nand no matter how the egg is turned will always float in its upper\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nFigure 3 represents the egg at this stage, with its enlarged air-cell.\r\n\r\nFigure 4 represents the egg as it appears at the end of the fourth day.\r\nThe circle surrounding and inclosing the germ will have nearly doubled\r\nin size, and is of a still darker hue; indeed, the whole contents of the\r\negg is perceptibly darkened. If the egg is broken carefully at this date\r\na delicate tracery of veins will be found to have enveloped the entire\r\nyolk of the egg, all originating from the centre or heart of the embryo;\r\nthe pulsations of which (if the shell is removed) can now be plainly\r\nseen with the naked eye. This net work of veins cannot be plainly seen\r\nwith a common lamp, but with a powerful glass are very distinct. This\r\nlatter is not at all necessary in testing the egg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 3.--EGG AT END OF 72 HOURS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 4.--EGG AT END OF 96 HOURS.]\r\n\r\nThe discovery and locations of the minute organisms may be interesting\r\nto the scientist, but not at all necessary to the operator, who simply\r\nwants to be assured of the life and health of the germ. This he can\r\nreadily determine from the increased size and gradual development of the\r\ncircle; it, and the contents of the egg, now assume a darker shade. Up\r\nto this time I use no moisture, and the contents of the eggs have\r\ngradually evaporated and the air-cell proportionately enlarged. This\r\nair-cell is slightly enlarged till the tenth day, when no further\r\nevaporation should take place. About three days before hatching the\r\nrapidly developing duck will gradually diminish the size of the\r\nair-cell, leaving himself just room enough to work out.\r\n\r\nNature, in the case of the old hen, provides for her own contingencies,\r\nwhile we must resort to art to obtain the same conditions.\r\n\r\nWhile incubating under the hen during the first few days, the egg\r\nevaporates rapidly. Then the pores gradually become coated with an oily\r\nsecretion from the feathers of the hen until evaporation ceases. Now, we\r\ncannot successfully fill the pores of the eggs, it is too delicate an\r\noperation to attempt; but we can easily obtain the same conditions in\r\nanother way, and that is to prevent the further evaporation of the egg\r\nby vaporizing water in the egg-chamber, so that evaporation will not\r\ntake place. Exactly when this should be done is already known, but\r\nexactly how much is quite another thing, and depends largely upon the\r\nconditions of the atmosphere outside. The point is this: the humidity\r\ninside the egg-chamber must be the same, whatever the conditions are\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nIf your machine is in a warm, dry room, heated by a fire, far more\r\nevaporating surface will be required than in a cool, dry cellar, for the\r\nreason that water vaporizes just in proportion to its heat; and as the\r\ncirculating pipes upon which the water-pans rest must necessarily be\r\nmuch warmer in a cold room than in a warm one, of course more surface\r\nmust be exposed in a warm than in a cold one. The operator will always\r\nhave to use his judgment more or less in that. It may perplex the novice\r\nsomewhat, but it is easily understood when one becomes accustomed to it.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, in our machines, we introduce one moisture pan about the 18th\r\nday for both duck's and hen's eggs. It makes some difference whether a\r\nmachine is run in a humid atmosphere near the seashore or in a dry,\r\nrarified atmosphere at an altitude in the country.\r\n\r\nFigure 5 represents the egg at the end of the fifth day, the circle\r\nenlarged, shaded darker in color; the whole egg being slightly darker in\r\nhue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 5.--EGG AT END OF 120 HOURS.]\r\n\r\nFigure 6, at the end of the sixth day, shows still more plainly the germ\r\nundergoing a gradual change in the egg, enlarging and assuming a darker\r\nhue. The outline of the circle is now gradually acquiring the form of an\r\nellipse, and in a live embryo the line of demarkation should be\r\ndistinct. If it is at all wavy and irregular in its outline, and\r\ninstead, remaining intact, the contents of this ellipse show a\r\ndisposition to assimilate with the surrounding liquids when the egg is\r\nrevolved, it can be safely removed as a dead duck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 6.--EGG AT END OF 144 HOURS.]\r\n\r\nFigure 7 represents a dead embryo, as it will appear from the seventh to\r\nthe twelfth day. The germ being separated and appearing in dark\r\nirregular blotches over the entire surface of the egg; the egg having\r\nbecome nearly opaque over its entire surface. At this stage the egg, if\r\nit has not already become so, will soon be very offensive. These should\r\nbe removed at once and handled carefully the while, as they are apt to\r\nexplode and unpleasant consequences ensue. The operator should run no\r\nrisks, as discoloration on the outside shell of a duck egg is a sure\r\nsign of decay, and they can safely be taken from the machine. There are\r\nalways a certain number of duck eggs (especially during the month of\r\nAugust and the latter part of July) that have the appearance of\r\nfertility during the first three or four days of the hatch, but do not\r\npossess vitality enough to carry them through. These die at all stages\r\nof the hatch; neither operator nor machine is responsible for them. This\r\nis caused by the condition of the mother bird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 7.--A DEAD EMBRYO.]\r\n\r\nIn order to economize the room thus made by the removal of the fertile\r\neggs, I run a small 150-egg machine, in connection with twenty-one of\r\nthe largest size, using it, as it were, as a tender. When filling one of\r\nthe larger machines, I always fill one tray in the smaller one so that\r\nwhen the eggs in the large one are tested, after the third day, there\r\nwill usually be eggs enough in the small tray to replace those removed\r\nas infertile, so that the large machines are kept full during the entire\r\nhatch by the little one. Thus the small machine is made to accomplish\r\nfar more than it would were it run through the hatch. I am thus enabled\r\nto have a hatch come off nearly every day, consequently our eggs are\r\nnever older than that when introduced into the machine. Always date\r\neach day's quota of eggs--keep them by themselves, then there will be no\r\nmistakes made. I have known parties to keep one general receptacle for\r\ntheir eggs, and when filling their machine take them from the top, while\r\nthe bottom ones were never disturbed, not even turned, and of course\r\nsoon became worthless for any purpose.\r\n\r\nFigure 8 denotes the appearance of the egg during the eighth day of\r\nincubation. If portions of the shell are carefully removed at this\r\nstage, the rudimentary intestines may be plainly seen, together with the\r\ngradual development of the beak and eyes, as well as the trembling of\r\nthe pulsating arteries through the whole embryo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 8.--EGG AFTER 192 HOURS.]\r\n\r\nAt this stage the operator should mark all doubtful eggs and return them\r\nto the machine, as he will find plenty of room there. He will soon\r\nbecome expert, and can detect life and death in the germ at a glance.\r\nExperience alone will give the operator an insight into this business.\r\nThe incipient stages of decay, though easily detected by the expert,\r\ncannot be intelligently described by him. The application of a little\r\nheat for the short space of twenty days to an inert mass, developing it\r\ninto active, intelligent life, is simply wonderful. The process and\r\neffect he can easily describe, but the procreative power behind it all\r\nis beyond his ken. Should a little duckling be taken from the shell on\r\nthe thirteenth or fourteenth day it will resemble Figure 9. It will kick\r\nand struggle several moments after its removal. The yolk is not yet\r\nabsorbed, but the process is just beginning and will continue until the\r\ntwenty-fourth day, when it will be nearly absorbed. The egg, from the\r\nfourteenth day rapidly assumes a darker hue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 9.]\r\n\r\nThe extremities of the little bird gradually develop, the feathers grow,\r\nand at the twentieth day the egg is opaque. At this stage the embryo\r\nwill endure greater extremes of heat or cold than at the earlier stage\r\nof the hatch. I should not advise the operator to presume upon this,\r\nhowever, but just make the conditions as favorable as he can, so that\r\nthe little bird will have the strength to free himself from the shell. I\r\nneed not say that this is the most critical time during the whole\r\nprocess, and matters should be made as favorable for the little duckling\r\nas possible. About the twenty-fourth day he will be already to break the\r\nshell, but, unlike the chick, who will make his way out of the shell a\r\nfew hours after he has pipped, the duckling will lay for forty-eight\r\nhours before he is ready to come out. At this time there should be\r\nplenty of moisture in the egg-chamber, for should the orifice or broken\r\nparts become dry, and the little duckling, in consequence, be attached\r\nto the inside lining so that he cannot turn, he can never get out\r\nwithout help.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 10.]\r\n\r\nWhen the hatch is well underway a little more air should be allowed to\r\ncirculate in the egg-chamber, and a part of the evaporating surface can\r\nbe removed, for as each duckling makes its appearance he becomes a\r\nlittle sponge, until dried off, and furnishes plenty of moisture for the\r\nmachine. When nearly dried off the duckling should be dropped into the\r\nnursery below the egg-trays. While hatching, the eggs should be kept\r\npipped side up in the trays, as the birds sometimes get smothered when\r\nthe orifice is underneath. The dry birds should be dropped below about\r\nonce in four hours, for, if allowed to accumulate, they will roll the\r\negg upside down, crowd the egg-shells over the pipped eggs, or pile\r\nthemselves over the egg, smothering the young birds.\r\n\r\nThis work should be done very quickly, so as not to derange the\r\ntemperature of the machine. Be sure to keep the heat up in your machine,\r\nfor its tendency is always to go down during hatching, for the reason\r\nthat the egg radiates a great deal of heat, while the little duckling,\r\nwith its woolly covering (which is a non-conductor), retains it. Many\r\npeople advocate allowing the little fledglings to remain with the eggs\r\nuntil all are hatched, but this is all wrong, not only for the above\r\nreasons, but for one which is far more important than either.\r\n\r\nThe amount of heat requisite to hatch the eggs is too much for the young\r\nbirds already hatched and dried off. With chamber at 102 degrees, they\r\nwill be seen crowding around the sides of machine with their little\r\nbills wide open, gasping for breath, when, had they been placed below,\r\nthe proper temperature can be maintained in both, as the bottom of\r\nmachine runs at least five degrees lower than the egg-trays.\r\n\r\n\r\nBe sure and Follow Instructions.\r\n\r\nAnother fertile source of trouble is removing ducklings from machine,\r\nputting them behind the stove, or somewhere else to dry off. For every\r\nfifteen birds removed, the heat in egg-chamber is reduced at least one\r\ndegree, as you are removing so many little stoves, and if the machine is\r\nnot gauged higher, to correspond with the number of ducklings taken out,\r\nthe result will be fatal to the unhatched eggs.\r\n\r\nI corresponded a whole summer with one man on this very point before I\r\nfound out what he was doing. He said he had never been able to get out\r\nmore than fifty per cent. of fertile eggs. His machine ran splendidly\r\nuntil his chicks were about half hatched, when it would drop down to 90\r\ndegrees, and the rest would die in the shell, after they were nearly all\r\npipped. At last a letter came from him stating that he had just had a\r\nworse experience than ever. He had a most promising hatch of three\r\nhundred fertile eggs, nearly all of which were pipped, and that, after a\r\nlittle more than half were hatched, he took them out as usual, about one\r\nhundred and fifty in number, and put them behind the stove to dry off,\r\nand his machine dropped to 90 degrees at once, and not another chick\r\ncame out. The cat was out of the bag.\r\n\r\nI wrote him at once that for every fifteen chicks he had taken out he\r\nhad taken one degree of heat from his machine, and had he followed\r\ninstructions he would not have suffered loss. He wrote back that he had\r\nshut up his machine for the season, but that he should run it one more\r\nhatch just to prove that I was wrong. At the end of three weeks a letter\r\nwas received saying, \"I tender you my hat. I got a splendid hatch of\r\n88-1/2 per cent.\" Proving that occasionally there is danger of the\r\noperator knowing too much. After the ducklings are all out, the\r\negg-trays should be removed, the valves opened, and the machine cooled\r\ndown to 90 degrees, and the birds allowed to remain in the machine for\r\nat least twenty-four hours. I always cover the bottom of machine with an\r\ninch of fine wheat-bran, otherwise the ducklings would soon make it\r\nfilthy and offensive. This acts both as absorbent and disinfectant.\r\n\r\nAfter each hatch there will be more or less fertile eggs left in the\r\ntrays with dead ducklings in them. There will be, comparatively, but few\r\nof these in the spring of the year, but during the latter part of the\r\nsummer there will be more of them, and many of the eggs will have but\r\nlittle vitality in them.\r\n\r\n\r\nForcing the Bird Reduces the Vitality of the Egg.\r\n\r\nThe reason is this: the bird in its natural condition does not produce\r\nher eggs in our climate until April. She will lay twenty-five to thirty\r\neggs, then show a desire to incubate, then will recuperate, and set a\r\nsecond time, perhaps giving a total of thirty-five or forty eggs. Now,\r\nwe have completely reversed nature in this respect. By judicious\r\nfeeding, good care, warm quarters, and careful breeding, we have induced\r\nthe bird to produce her eggs in winter instead of summer, and, not only\r\nthat, we compel her to lay three or four times as many of them; and when\r\nthe poor bird shows a desire to incubate and recuperate her exhausted\r\nframe, we induce a change of mind, as soon as possible, and set her at\r\nit again.\r\n\r\nAs a natural consequence, as the warm season advances many of the birds\r\nare off duty, as it were, and the eggs not only decrease in numbers but\r\nin size as well, and during the extreme heat of summer, the later part\r\nof July and August especially, the eggs show a decided want of vitality.\r\nI never expect, at this season, to realize more than one duckling from\r\ntwo eggs. The same machine full of eggs that would give a hatch of 350\r\nducklings in the early spring, at this season will not give more than\r\n175 to 200. The eggs appear to be as well fertilized during the first\r\ntwo or three days as in the early spring but evidently there is not\r\nvitality enough to carry them through, as the germs soon begin to die,\r\nand before the hatch is out you have taken nearly one-half of the eggs\r\naway as worthless. Nor is this all.\r\n\r\nThere is always a far greater mortality among the later hatched\r\nbirds than in those got out earlier. They are more uneven in\r\nappearance, and never attain the size of those hatched earlier in the\r\nseason,--convincing evidence that the old birds have transmitted their\r\nenfeebled, debilitated constitutions through the egg to the young ones.\r\nThe natural laws of cause and effect are plainly represented here. I\r\nhave tried repeatedly to overcome this difficulty by changing the feed\r\nand quarters of the old birds, dividing their numbers, but without\r\neffect. This shows the absolute necessity of selecting large, vigorous\r\nbreeding stock. This principle applies equally to both land and water\r\nfowl.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Absolute Necessity of Good Breeding Stock.\r\n\r\nDebilitated, degenerate stock will not produce healthy and vigorous\r\nyoung. This is a prime cause of failure with many of our poultry\r\nbreeders. They say that they cannot afford to breed from their\r\nearly-hatched stock. They are worth too much in the market, so they are\r\nsent to the shambles, and their owners breed from the later-hatched,\r\ninferior birds. A few years practice of this kind soon degenerates the\r\nstock so that you will hardly recognize the original in it, and both\r\nbirds and eggs are not only thus, but a very small per cent. of those\r\neggs can be induced to hatch, and no amount of petting and coaxing can\r\ninduce those that are hatched to live.\r\n\r\nEvery young breeder of poultry should inform himself of these facts\r\nbefore he starts in, for no living man can afford to breed from inferior\r\nstock. I passed through experiences of this kind many years ago, and\r\nalways found that the laws of primogeniture cannot be lightly set aside.\r\nI invariably select the choicest of my early hatched birds for breeding\r\nstock, and no matter how high the price in market, I cannot afford to\r\nsell them. A gentleman, who is a large breeder, said to me the past\r\nspring: \"How is it that your ducks are so much larger than mine? I\r\nbought stock from you four years ago, and have been breeding from it\r\never since, and now your birds are six or eight pounds per pair heavier\r\nthan mine.\" \"True, but you bought my latest-hatched birds, because they\r\nwere cheap, and have been breeding from your latest-hatched birds ever\r\nsince, while I have been breeding only from the choicest of my early\r\nbirds. You have been steadily breeding your stock down, while I have\r\nbeen breeding mine up. There is now a wide gap between them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCaring for the Ducklings when Hatched.\r\n\r\nThe little ducklings should be left in the machine for at least\r\ntwenty-four hours longer. Be sure and open the air-valves and give them\r\nplenty of air, so that they may be well dried off. A uniform heat of 90\r\ndegrees should be held in the egg-chamber. The outer doors of the\r\nmachine should be closed and the little fellows kept in darkness the\r\nfirst twelve hours. After that the outer doors should be let down. Then\r\nyou will see some fun, for the little ducklings are far more active than\r\nchicks, and will begin to play at once. In the meantime the\r\nbrooding-house should be prepared for the reception of the young brood.\r\nThe heat should be started some twenty-four hours previous to use.\r\n\r\nThe brooding-house should be the same whether you are growing on a small\r\nscale or a large one, with simply the length proportioned to your needs.\r\nBut always recollect that heat should radiate from above on your\r\nducklings, as bottom heat will soon cripple them in the legs and render\r\nthem helpless. In fact, I do not consider bottom heat as essential even\r\nfor chicks. The most successful grower I know of, who grows 3,000 chicks\r\neach spring, getting them all out between January 1st and March 1st, and\r\ncloses up the whole business by July 1st, uses top heat exclusively. He\r\nhas experimented fairly with both, and says he wants no more bottom\r\nheat. If the breeder is growing on a small scale it will be economy for\r\nhim to use brooders instead of a heater.\r\n\r\nFigure 11 represents the best duck brooder I know of. As there is no\r\npatent on it anyone can make it who has the conveniences. This brooder\r\nis six and a half feet long by three feet wide, and will accommodate 150\r\nducklings. These brooders are of the most improved construction, are\r\nintended for both indoor and outdoor work, keeping the young ducks dry\r\nand warm in cold, stormy weather, even when located out of doors. The\r\nheat is generated in copper boilers, the water flowing through a\r\ngalvanized iron tank, under which the young ducklings hover. This tank\r\nis five feet long, twelve inches wide, and about an inch thick, and is\r\nhung about eight inches from ends and back of brooder, leaving nearly\r\neighteen inches in front the entire length of brooder, in which to feed\r\nthe first day or two. The case of this brooder is made of matched boards\r\nand thoroughly ventilated and furnished with glass doors to admit light.\r\nThis brooder should be used in the brooding-house during winter and\r\nearly spring, after which it can be used to better advantage out of\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 11.--BROODER.]\r\n\r\nLet it be understood that a good brooder is, next to the incubator, the\r\nmost important thing in the business. It is worse than useless to get\r\nout large hatches of strong, healthy birds, only to have them smothered\r\nor chilled in worthless brooders. Numbers of the patent brooders now on\r\nthe market are made by men who never raised a chick or duck in their\r\nlives, and are regular fire and death traps. Many instances have come\r\nunder my personal notice where not only ducks, chicks, and brooders,\r\nbut the buildings themselves have been entirely consumed by these fire\r\ntraps.\r\n\r\nAgain, those brooders are always rated for higher than their actual\r\ncapacity. Ignorant parties buy them, fill them up according to\r\ninstructions, when a sad mortality is sure to follow from overcrowding\r\nand consequent overheating. This is especially the case with chicks.\r\nDucklings never smother each other from overcrowding, but, of course,\r\nwill not thrive when too closely packed. These 150-duck brooders can be\r\nrun at an expense of two cents per day for oil. In extreme cold weather\r\nartificial heat should be kept up in these brooders for three weeks; in\r\nwarm weather, a week is sufficient. The same brooders can be used over\r\nand over as fast as the new hatches come out. When brooders are removed,\r\nclosed boxes can be used instead.\r\n\r\nWhen the operator does business large enough to require the use of five\r\nor six brooders, it would be cheaper for him to put in a heater at once,\r\nas the original cost of the heater would be less than that of the\r\nbrooders. Years ago, when the question of heaters was first agitated,\r\nthe cost was enormous, and the consumption of coal in proportion. Large\r\nhot-house boilers were used, often at a cost of several hundred dollars\r\nbefore the thing was ready for use. Now a good heating system can be\r\narranged for a building one hundred feet long at an expense not\r\nexceeding $100. This, of course, would be much less than a complement of\r\nbrooders for the same building.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages of the Heating System.\r\n\r\nThe heating system has several marked advantages over the brooders. One\r\nis, that during the extreme cold of winter the building is always warm\r\nenough for the little birds, while with nothing but brooders it would\r\noften freeze around them, necessitating feeding inside the brooders,\r\nwhich would not be as healthy for the ducklings. Again there would be a\r\ngreat saving of labor, as a self-regulating heater would require no more\r\ncare than a single brooder, while the oil consumed in the brooders would\r\nfully equal the cost of coal required for the heater.\r\n\r\nThere is one point here which the beginner should always take into\r\nconsideration in the selection of a heater, and that is, be sure and get\r\none that will give you the greatest amount of heat for the fuel\r\nconsumed. The patent steam and water heaters now upon the market are too\r\nnumerous to mention. But there is a vast difference in the economy of\r\nthese heaters.\r\n\r\nWhen contemplating the purchase of a heater, several years ago, I called\r\nupon a party who was running a newly-purchased heater. He seemed very\r\nmuch pleased with it, and said it ran admirably,--warmed his buildings\r\nnicely, and only cost about one dollar per day for coal. I made up my\r\nmind then and there that I should run my brooders a while longer. But on\r\ninterrogating another party using one of a different pattern, he assured\r\nme that his heaters warmed both brooders and buildings in good shape at\r\na cost of fifteen cents per day. This was presenting the matter in a new\r\nphase. The difference in cost of running these heaters one year would\r\npurchase two. I am now running three heaters called the \"Bramhall-Deane\r\nHeater\" and am heating two brooding houses (one 250 feet long, the other\r\n175 feet long), at half the cost per day. Either steam or water may be\r\nused. I prefer water for both safety and economy.\r\n\r\nFor instance, should the fire go out accidentally the heat would cease\r\nat once where steam was used, while water would hold its heat for hours,\r\nand would continue to circulate just so long as the water in the boiler\r\nwas hotter than that in the pipes. I do not know but there are other\r\nheaters in the market just as economical as the \"Bramhall-Deane,\" but I\r\nknow of several prominent poultry men who are changing their heating\r\nprinciple, not because they are dissatisfied with the work done by that\r\nnow in use, but solely on account of the expense attending it.\r\n\r\nFigure 12 represents our brooding-house as it appears outside. Its\r\ndimensions have already been given. It is boarded in with\r\nclosely-fitting hemlock boards, the whole being covered on the outside\r\nwith the heaviest quality of \"Paroid\" Roofing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROODING HOUSE. (FIG. 12.)]\r\n\r\nThis roofing is manufactured by F. W. Bird & Son, East Walpole, Mass. We\r\nhave more than an acre under roofing, a large proportion of which is\r\ncovered with Paroid. We find it strong, pliable, insusceptible to either\r\nheat or cold and to all appearances will be more durable than anything\r\nwe have ever used. I have many buildings covered with this roofing. In\r\napplying it, begin at the eaves, lapping it 1-1/2 inches. It is so heavy\r\nthat it does not require wooden strips to hold it down, simply nails and\r\ntin caps, which should be about an inch apart. A coat of the liquid,\r\nwhich goes with it, will glaze it over in good shape. For a flat roof,\r\nit is far better than shingles at less than half the cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterior Arrangement of Brooding-House.\r\n\r\nAs the construction of this building has been already noticed, I will\r\nproceed to describe its interior arrangement for a brooding-house. In\r\nthe first place, as in the breeding-house, there should be a walk three\r\nfeet wide the entire length of the building on the back side. Next to\r\nthe walk, and parallel with it, the brooder box should run. This box\r\nwill be thirty inches wide, and like the walk, the entire length of the\r\nbuilding. In my building the brooding arrangement is very simple,\r\nbeing a box with two sides resting on the ground, eight inches high in\r\nthe clear, the ground being utilized as the bottom of brooder.\r\n\r\nThis brooding-box consists of two parts. The sides, seven inches wide,\r\nare nailed securely, and constitute the sides of the pipe-stand. The\r\ncover is portable, with cleats nailed across the top to strengthen it,\r\nand with strips an inch wide nailed underneath, in front and in back, to\r\nkeep it in position. These strips are supposed to rest on the seven-inch\r\nstrips in the sides, and, when the cover is on, make a tight brooder.\r\n\r\nFigure 13 represents the interior of brooding-house, with these covers\r\non the brooders and ready for use. Also, with two of the covers removed\r\nshowing the heating pipes. These consist of a two-inch flow and return,\r\nrunning parallel with each other the entire length of the building, and\r\nlying ten inches apart from centre to centre. These pipes rest upon\r\ncross boards, whose length corresponds with the width of the brooder,\r\nand to which the sides are nailed; two-inch holes are cut out in the top\r\nof these boards into which the pipes are laid, the upper surface of\r\nwhich comes flush with the top of the boards, so that when the cover of\r\nbrooders is in position it rests equally on pipes and boards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _PLAN OF BROODING HOUSE._ (FIG. 13.)]\r\n\r\nThe distance between these boards corresponds with the width of pens\r\noutside of brooder, and constitute partitions for the same. The\r\npartitions are simply inch boards, twelve or fourteen inches wide,\r\nfitting into ground in front of building to keep them upright and in\r\nposition. The front of the brooder leading into the pens is cut out in\r\ncentre of brooder four feet long and four inches deep to allow the free\r\npassage of the ducklings. These openings in the first four pens are\r\nfringed with woolen cloth, cut up every four inches, to keep the\r\nbrooder warmer in cold weather. The remaining brooders are not fringed,\r\nfor reasons which will appear hereafter. The heater can be located in\r\nthe end of building most convenient to the operator.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the pens should consist of sand which, when it becomes\r\nwet, and before it becomes offensive, should be covered with fine\r\nsawdust. This is a good absorbent and disinfectant as well. The inside\r\nof the four brooders next the heater should be filled up with hay chaff\r\nto within four inches of the pipes, the distance being gradually\r\nincreased as you near the other end of the building, until the whole\r\neight inches in height will be required, using simply sawdust enough to\r\ndisinfect the bottom of brooder. This is my present brooding\r\narrangement, with the exception of a common door handle screwed on each\r\nbrooder cover to facilitate handling. It may not suit every one; some\r\nmay want it more ornamental, more expensive; others may wish to simplify\r\nit still more. But such as it is, it is now all ready for use, with heat\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nBut those little ducklings, who have been waiting all this time in the\r\nmachine, are getting both hungry and impatient, and require immediate\r\nattention. The food which has already been prepared consists of a\r\nformula composed of four parts wheat-bran, one part corn-meal with\r\nenough of low grade flour to connect the mass without making it sticky\r\nor pasty, in fact, it should be crumbly so that the little birds can eat\r\nit readily. About five per cent. of fine, sharp grit should be mixed\r\ninto their first feed, after that, one or two per cent. is all\r\nsufficient. This grit should be increased in size as the birds grow\r\nolder.\r\n\r\nAbout the third day, a little fine beef-scrap should be introduced,\r\nsoaking it a little before mixing. When a few days old, a little green\r\nrye, if obtainable, should be given them, or as a substitute, finely\r\nchopped cabbage or lettuce. When the birds are two weeks old, one part\r\ncorn-meal to three parts bran should be used. This food should be\r\nscattered upon the feeding-troughs, which are simply one-half inch\r\nboards, nine or ten inches wide, by three or four feet long, with laths\r\nnailed on the sides and ends. Small water-cans, inverted in tin saucers,\r\nso that the ducklings can drink readily without getting wet, should\r\nstand convenient to the food.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Remove the Ducklings Without Injury.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the removal of ducklings from the machine, I have a square\r\nbasket some two and one-half feet long, by fifteen inches wide and one\r\nfoot high, with close covers, hinged in the centre. In order to secure\r\nthe ducklings, usually all that is necessary is to open one door of\r\nmachine, hold this basket under it and make a little chuckling noise,\r\nand strange to say, the little fellows will run out over the pipes, over\r\nthe glass door, down into the basket in dozens as fast as their little\r\nlegs and wings can carry them. This basket will hold 100 ducklings\r\nconveniently. When full, it should be carried to the brooding-house and\r\ncarefully inverted over the feeding-boards.\r\n\r\nThe little birds will begin eating at once. This process can be repeated\r\nuntil the machine is emptied. There will be some of the later-hatched\r\nones that should be allowed to remain in the machine ten or twelve hours\r\nlonger, as they can be cared for better there. These can be readily\r\ndetected, as they are not as active as the others, and perhaps not\r\ncompletely dried off. The ducklings should be put out, if possible,\r\nduring the middle of the day, and while the sun shines through the\r\nwindows, as they can be fed in the sun and put under the brooder later\r\nin the day.\r\n\r\nIn event of there being no sun, it will not do to feed under the\r\nbrooding-box, as it is too dark. I then take a one-half inch board, four\r\nfeet long (to correspond with the length of opening in front of brooder)\r\nand six inches wide. I nail two pieces of the same width and height, one\r\nfoot long, on to each end of this board, forming a parallelogram four\r\nfeet long and one foot wide, minus one side. This is set up in front of\r\nthe opening in brooder, and being of the same length, forms a little pen\r\nin front of brooder one foot wide, in which the feeding-trough can be\r\nplaced with drinking fount.\r\n\r\nThe ducklings can then run out and in and feed when they wish. This\r\nboard will only be needed for a day or two, when it can be taken up and\r\nreserved for the next brood. The ducklings should be fed once in two\r\nhours, scattering a little food on the troughs. Be sure that they eat\r\nclean before more is given. At the end of a week the regular feed should\r\nbe four meals each day.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Feed.\r\n\r\nWhen I can get stale baker's bread I use that in connection with, and\r\ninstead of, bran. It can be profitably mixed with milk, not too sour,\r\nwhen it can be had for a cent a quart. But do not give milk as\r\ndrink,--the young birds will smear themselves all over with it, their\r\nbeaks and eyes will be stuck up, the down will come off their little\r\nbodies in large patches, and they will be a constant aggravation. I was\r\nonce called upon to visit an establishment, the owner of which\r\ncomplained that his ducklings did not grow, and he was very anxious for\r\nme to locate the trouble. I found six to eight hundred ducklings there\r\nof all ages, and, strange to say, nearly of one size; and one lot of\r\nnearly three hundred ducklings eight weeks old would not average one\r\npound each, when they should have weighed four pounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSuch a sight I never saw before, and hope never to see again. Of all the\r\nmiserable, squalid, contemptible looking objects, those ducklings took\r\nthe lead. This man had not only mixed their food with milk, but had kept\r\nit by them in open troughs, and the birds had bathed in it and spattered\r\nit over each other until there was hardly a feather left on their\r\nemaciated bodies; and yet this man did not know what ailed his ducks.\r\n\r\nIs it strange that some people fail in the poultry business?\r\n\r\nWhen in full operation, we run twenty-one large machines, and as it\r\nrequires twenty-seven days to close up each hatch, of course we have a\r\nhatch come off nearly every day. Now as each hatch is supposed to occupy\r\ntwo brooder-pens with the corresponding yards, in the course of five or\r\nsix weeks that brooding-house will be filled with its complement of\r\n3,000 ducklings. These will be of all ages, from the little puff-balls\r\njust from the machine, to the half-grown bird of six weeks old. The\r\nbrooding pipes are supposed to radiate the same amount of heat at the\r\nextreme end of the building as they do next the heater, consequently the\r\nbrooders are of the same temperature in all their parts. Not so the\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nAs the heater radiates a great deal of heat, the end in which this is\r\nlocated is always 12 or 15 degrees warmer than the other and is thus\r\nbetter adapted to the comfort of the newly hatched ducklings than the\r\nother, so I always put the birds fresh from the machine next the heater,\r\nwhile the older ones are passed down the building. This is a very simple\r\nprocess. One end of the partition board is lifted up a little, food\r\nscattered in a trough in the empty pen adjoining, the ducklings will\r\nrush under in a moment, then the board is dropped. The same process is\r\ncontinued until all are moved and the building filled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSIDE PLAN OF DOUBLE BROODING HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nThe building just described we term our nursery, and has a capacity of\r\nabout 2,500 birds. When full, the older birds are probably about two\r\nweeks old, and of course these older ones must be removed to make room\r\nfor successive hatches of younger birds. For this purpose, we\r\nconstructed a building 125 feet long, 32 feet wide, which we style our\r\ndouble brooding house. It runs east and west with a walk four feet wide\r\nthrough the centre, with brooding-pens on each side. This building has\r\nthe same capacity of a single building 250 feet long, and accommodates\r\nabout 5,000 birds. On the south side of this walk our brooder boxes are\r\narranged.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the building is a heater, from which an inch-and-a-half\r\nflow and return pipe runs under the brooder boxes the entire length of\r\nthe building and furnishes heat for the little birds. The brooder-boxes\r\nare located twenty inches from the side of the walk. The ducklings are\r\nfed and watered in this space, and are not allowed in it except for that\r\npurpose. To effect this, the covers of the brooding-boxes, which are six\r\nfeet long by two feet wide, are cut in the centre the entire length, and\r\nhinged with a perpendicular lip, which when closed, meets an upright\r\nboard below, some two inches high, shutting brooders tight, excluding\r\nducklings from feeding apartment, so that it is always sweet and clean.\r\n\r\nBy this arrangement, the ducklings are all fed and watered from the\r\nwalk, thus reducing the labor to a minimum, while there is no danger of\r\ncrushing the little birds under foot or under the troughs. The attendant\r\nis not hampered in his movements, but can work as quickly as he likes.\r\nAll he has to do is to distribute the food and water, throwing the\r\ncovers back as he goes, when the ducklings, which are always waiting,\r\nrush in and soon fill themselves. Twenty minutes is all that is required\r\nfor them to eat and drink.\r\n\r\nA person of good judgment can easily determine about how much the birds\r\nwill consume, though it is well for him to pass along the walk, giving a\r\nlittle more food where their wants are not satisfied, or taking up what\r\nis left over, shutting the covers down when the birds are through.\r\n\r\nAs this building is well piped, distributing water at both ends, as well\r\nas at the mixing-box and heater, it makes the feeding almost a pastime,\r\nthe work is done so easily. This building is just what we have been\r\nlooking for. There are none on the place that pleases us so well. Its\r\nmany advantages over a single building must be evident to all. The\r\nincreased facility for doing the work, as well as its economy in housing\r\nmany more birds for the money invested, are not the least.\r\n\r\nWhen planning this building, we had some misgiving about running it east\r\nand west as the lay of the land required, thinking that the exposure on\r\nthe north side during the inclement weather of the early spring, would\r\nconfine the young birds to the building and they would suffer for want\r\nof exercise, but we were agreeably disappointed as we found that they\r\nthrived equally as well, if not better, on the north side as on the\r\nsouth, proving what I have always known in duck culture, that the\r\nextreme heat of summer is more debilitating to young birds than the cold\r\nof winter, and that early hatched birds will always be of larger size\r\nand more robust physique than late ones.\r\n\r\nThat is why I have always made it a point to select my early hatched\r\nbirds for breeding purposes. I have never known any too good for that. I\r\ninsert cuts of this double building, with the older ducklings on the\r\nnorth side and the younger ones on the south. Were I to build another, I\r\nshould duplicate it in every respect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nRegulation of Heat in Brooders.\r\n\r\nNow, as the birds grow larger, they naturally need less heat, and we\r\nmust contrive to fix it so they do not get so much. As stated before, no\r\nfringe is used beyond the first four brooders,--the space in front being\r\nleft open; and not only that, but we gradually raise the back of the\r\ncover next the walk until it opens an inch or more the entire length of\r\nthe pen. Those ducklings, before they reach the other end of this\r\nbrooding-house, will weigh (if well cared for) over a pound each.\r\n\r\nThe brooder will not then be large enough to hold them, neither do they\r\nrequire the heat, in fact it would be injurious at this age; so before\r\nthe birds reach the extreme end of the building I shut them off from the\r\nbrooders entirely by placing a board in front of the opening. The young\r\nbirds will always thrive better out of doors than in; and when two weeks\r\nold I always let them out during the sunny days of April, by opening the\r\nslides in front.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of growth when the birds are from two to four weeks old,\r\nespecially with the early hatches when confined as they usually are\r\nduring the inclement weather in winter, unless extreme care is taken, a\r\nsad mortality is sure to follow.\r\n\r\nThere is a great tendency at this stage of growth, when the birds are\r\nconfined, to overfeed as well as to overheat in the brooders. This,\r\ncoupled with too little exercise is sure to cripple the birds, weaken\r\ntheir legs and render them helpless. Even experienced growers sometimes\r\nget a little careless and lose whole hatches. We have numerous letters\r\nfrom all parts of the country in which people write \"My ducklings are\r\nall crippled, cannot walk and are dying off fast. What shall I do?\"\r\nThere is only one thing; feed sparingly, and give all the exercise\r\npossible. Often, the want of grit will cause the same trouble.\r\n\r\n(Our yards have been prepared for this the previous autumn, and are now\r\ncovered with a thick coat of green rye five or six inches high.) To\r\naccomplish this, I make pens outside the building in front, ten feet\r\nlong, and of a width to correspond with the pens inside. I simply use\r\nold boards a foot wide, tacking them together with wire nails, as it is\r\nonly a temporary arrangement. When snow falls it must be shoveled out at\r\nonce. Just as soon as the weather and the condition of the ground will\r\nallow, I set up the partition wire outside to correspond with the width\r\nof pens inside. This wire partition runs the whole length of the yard;\r\nand as the yards are 100 feet deep, it gives the ducklings a yard 6x100\r\nfeet. I always feed outside whenever the weather will permit. It is\r\nneedless to say that the sanitary arrangements in this building are of\r\nthe utmost importance. Indeed, it will require constant watchfulness and\r\ncare on the part of the attendant.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sanitary Arrangements.\r\n\r\nWith several thousand ducklings confined in one building, the tendency\r\nis decidedly filthy. The capacity of the duckling for filth is\r\nwonderful, and he comes honestly by it. It is simply astonishing how\r\nsoon he will manage to mix the contents of his water-tank with that of\r\nhis yard and make both sloppy and offensive. The chick is nowhere in\r\ncomparison. It is true, the duck is not so easily affected by it as the\r\nchick, but it will not do to presume too much upon that. At this stage\r\nthe attendant will be kept busy every moment from daylight to dark.\r\n\r\nNot only the regular feeding four times a day requires his attention,\r\nbut the simple mixing of seventy-five to one hundred bushels of feed\r\neach day is quite a little job of itself, especially when the different\r\ningredients should be exact. The water tanks also must be regularly\r\ncleaned and filled. The troughs should be carefully cleaned before\r\nfeeding, as the ducks will readily eat all foreign matter together with\r\nthe food. In short, the whole business must be systematized all the way\r\nthrough, and the attendant should understand that it is never safe to\r\nneglect a single detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR DOUBLE BROODING HOUSE. (South side.)]\r\n\r\nI had always made a point of doing this duty myself. A few years ago,\r\nnot feeling well and having other business requiring my attention, I\r\nengaged a man whom I considered competent to do this business for me. I\r\ntook him over the yards, showed and told him just how the thing must be\r\ndone; watched him to see that he did the work faithfully and complied\r\nwith all its details. Things went on apparently well for a week or two,\r\nwhen, going home one day, I noticed a number of dead ducklings lying\r\naround, and looking under the brooder I found quite a number more. I at\r\nonce interviewed the man and cautioned him. He insisted that he had\r\nfollowed the instructions to the letter. But the mortality did not\r\nabate, on the contrary it increased to an alarming extent; and I had\r\nlost more ducklings in one month than I had lost for ten years previous.\r\n\r\nI watched him and found that the feeding-troughs were not cleaned at\r\nall, and when the birds scattered the sawdust in them the food was\r\nthrown on that, the ducklings consuming both. The food was thrown partly\r\nin the trough and partly on the ground; apparently a matter of perfect\r\nindifference to him. The water-tanks were not rinsed out. Instead of\r\nstepping over the eighteen-inch partition wires he stepped on them,\r\nbreaking down the standards and flattening down the wire, so that the\r\nbirds were all mixed together promiscuously,--ducklings two weeks old\r\nwith those of six weeks. The little ones were trodden down by the older\r\nones and almost denuded of their feathers, and there was no thrift to\r\nbe seen anywhere. To say that I was indignant does not express it. I had\r\noften seen such a condition of things elsewhere, but not before on my\r\nown ranch; I was absolutely ashamed to show visitors around the yards as\r\nlong as this state of things existed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR DOUBLE BROODING HOUSE. (North side.)]\r\n\r\nThat man was promptly discharged, and I undertook the feeding myself.\r\nThe birds were sorted out and returned to their own yards, the wire\r\nreplaced, the feeding-troughs cleaned, the pens carefully disinfected.\r\nIn four days double the amount of food was consumed and things were\r\ndecidedly improved. But those birds never acquired that uniformity of\r\nsize and appearance which had always characterized my market birds. The\r\nbest material to use in the pens inside the brooding-house is dry, fine\r\nsawdust, if it can be obtained. It is by far the best thing I know of\r\nfor the purpose. The next best is finely chopped straw or hay, tanbark,\r\netc. The brooders, like the pens, require close attention. The top\r\nshould be scraped off before it becomes offensive, and new material\r\napplied. This can be easily done by simply lifting the edge of the cover\r\nnext the walk and drawing it over into the walk, when it can be taken in\r\na barrow or basket.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Necessity of Green Food.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that as the broods grow older the cleaning process\r\nmust be repeated oftener, as their capacity for generating filth will\r\nalways be in proportion to their size. Those unacquainted with\r\nduck-culture have little idea how fast these birds will grow; how soon\r\nthey will successively outgrow brooders, pens and yards, and how soon\r\nevery vestige of green will disappear from yards that were thickly\r\ncovered with rye. But the ducklings must be kept growing at all hazards,\r\nand a vegetable supply must be procured from outside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEST SIDE OF LANE.]\r\n\r\nRye comes first in the season (I always cultivate it for the purpose,\r\nand when coarse, it must be cut so that it can be readily eaten); then\r\ngrass; and next corn fodder, which is best of all. It is astonishing how\r\nmuch of the latter these birds will consume--hundreds of pounds each\r\nday. It should be cut very fine, not more than one-third of an inch in\r\nlength. Unlike the hen, the birds prefer the stalk to the leaf. Give\r\nthem all they will eat, once each day. [But we have forgotten that empty\r\nmachine. After the ducklings are taken out it will be found running at\r\n85 to 90 degrees. I gauge it up to 102 and fill it with fresh eggs at\r\nonce, not forgetting to fill one tray in the little tender.] There is\r\none bad habit to which ducklings of four or five weeks old are addicted,\r\nand that is feather eating. First the down will begin to disappear from\r\ntheir backs; next, as the birds grow older, the quills which grow out\r\nfrom the end of the wings will disappear, and they are all exposed for\r\ntempting morsels.\r\n\r\nThese quills bleed profusely when disturbed, which, of course, seriously\r\nretards the growth and progress of the birds. This vice should be\r\nchecked at once, for vice it is,--superinduced by idleness and close\r\nconfinement. When the first indications of these troubles appear, the\r\nattendant should watch the birds closely for a few moments, when the\r\naggressors can soon be detected. They should be removed at once and\r\nconfined by themselves, or placed in yards with older birds already\r\nfeathered out, which affords them no temptation to practice their newly\r\nacquired art.\r\n\r\nIf this is not done at once the vice becomes general, and disastrous\r\nconsequences are sure to follow. If it has already attained headway,\r\nbefore the novice detects it, he must change them to new quarters; a\r\ngrassy area is best, where they usually forget all about it. This can be\r\nreadily done, as the operator should always have a spare roll of\r\neighteen-inch wire netting on hand with which he can enclose a given\r\narea in a few moments. Too much cannot be said in favor of this wire, it\r\nis so cheap, portable and convenient. It can be taken up and removed in\r\nan incredibly short time to facilitate plowing and disinfecting the\r\nyards. While it effectually separates the birds, it affords little or no\r\nimpediment to the attendant during the process of watering and feeding.\r\nI fasten this wire up to short stakes driven in the ground, using small\r\nstaples for the purpose. When removed it can be rolled up, stakes and\r\nall, without disturbing the staples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR TWENTY-FIVE HUNDRED BREEDING DUCKS. Kodak standing in\r\ncentre of yard.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is then ready for resetting or stowing away for next season's work.\r\nThis wire is now the cheapest of all fencing for poultry work,--much\r\nmore so, even, than lath-fencing; and has the great advantage of being\r\nportable and far more durable than any other material. Two-inch mesh,\r\nNo. 19 wire, can be had now for three-quarters cent a square foot by the\r\nsingle roll, and proportionately cheaper by the quantity. Never purchase\r\nNo. 20 wire, as it will prove unsatisfactory in the end. It is not\r\nself-supporting and can only be kept in position by boards, both above\r\nand below. There is great difference in the quality of this wire; that\r\nmade by some firms being of so soft material that it will not stand\r\nalone. The squares soon become ellipses, and your eighteen-inch wire\r\nsettles to a foot. The best I have ever used is that made by the Gilbert\r\n& Bennett Manufacturing Company, Georgetown, Conn.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this our oldest ducklings will have reached the extreme end\r\nof the brooding-house, and it will be filled to its utmost capacity. In\r\norder to make room for the successive hatches I drive the older hatches\r\nout and round to my cold buildings, two in number. These buildings are\r\neach seventy-five feet long, with contiguous yards one hundred feet\r\ndeep. The slides in the buildings are left open, and the ducklings are\r\nat liberty to go out or in as they see fit,--a privilege of which they\r\navail themselves as the state of the atmosphere inclines. These yards\r\nalways have a thick mat of rye growing on them. The partition wires have\r\nbeen set up and the young birds are quietly driven to their respective\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nAfter ducklings reach the age of six weeks, it is not necessary to\r\nconfine them in buildings during the night. Indeed, they are far better\r\nnot, unless it is extremely cold, or there is danger from vermin. Even\r\nsevere rainstorms will not injure them. They should be watched\r\ncarefully, however, as they are apt, during their antics, to fall over\r\non their backs, when, through suction from the wet and muddy ground,\r\nthey are seldom able to turn back again. Prompt assistance should be\r\nrendered, or it will surely be too late, as the back of a duckling is\r\nhis most susceptible part. After the birds are six weeks old it will not\r\nbe necessary to feed more than three times per day, gradually\r\nsubstituting meal for bran, until the birds are eight weeks old, when\r\ntheir food should be, at least, three-quarters meal. There should also\r\nbe a steady increase of animal food after the seventh week.\r\n\r\n\r\nCareful Watering Even More Essential Than Food.\r\n\r\nParticular care should be taken at this time to give the birds all they\r\nneed to drink, or your food will be thrown away, as they require more\r\nwater during the warm weather. They will consume and waste vast\r\nquantities, and the water supply should be made as convenient as\r\npossible, to facilitate the business. Our water is forced by a windmill\r\ninto a two hundred-barrel tank, and leads from there through pipes into\r\nbrooding and breeding houses, into the yards and mixing room,--all with\r\na view to saving labor and time. The water-pans in the buildings are\r\nraised six or eight inches from the ground to prevent the birds getting\r\nin or wasting the water.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, during warm, dry spells, the dried excrement of the birds\r\nwill accumulate on the surface of the ground. This, as a matter of\r\neconomy, as well as a sanitary necessity, should be carefully swept up\r\nbefore a rain, as the birds will sometimes drink water from the puddles\r\nstanding around, and it will often seriously affect their appetites, as\r\nboth yards and droppings are very offensive when wet. Shade is\r\nabsolutely necessary at this age during warm weather, as ducklings can\r\nnever be made in good condition when exposed to the sun during the\r\nextreme heat of summer. It affects their appetites at once, reducing the\r\nconsumption of food by one-half. It is always well, if possible, to\r\nlocate your yards so that the birds can have access to shade. If not,\r\nartificial shade must be constructed to meet the ends.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to set up four stakes, about 6x10 feet, forming a\r\nparallelogram. Sideboards should be nailed on these stakes about two\r\nfeet high. These can be covered with old boards, pine boughs, bushes, or\r\nthatched over with meadow hay,--whatever is most convenient to the\r\ngrower. Great care should be taken in feeding by giving all the\r\nconcentrated food the birds can be made to eat, and no more, as the\r\nlargest of them will be ready for market when nine weeks old. Frighten\r\nand excite the birds as little as possible while sorting them. The best\r\nway to do this is to use a wide board some ten feet long, with two holes\r\ncut in the upper side near the middle. These holes should be two feet\r\napart, and large enough to admit the hands for convenient handling.\r\nFifteen or twenty of the birds should be driven in a corner and confined\r\nwith this board. The birds should now be taken by the neck, one at a\r\ntime, the largest and choicest selected for market, the rejected ones\r\nput in a temporary yard by themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis process should be repeated until the whole hatch is sorted, when\r\nthe culls can be returned to their old quarters. They will have a better\r\nchance than before, and in a few days will be as good as the others. The\r\noldest hatches, which usually come out in February and March, are all\r\nsent to market. The price is too high to save for breeders, but from\r\nsubsequent hatches, those that come out in April and May, we select our\r\nbreeding stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Select Breeding Stock.\r\n\r\nEven these birds will command a high price, but I cannot afford to wait\r\nlonger. I am very particular in this selection. The birds must not only\r\nbe of the largest size, but of the most perfect form. The contour of\r\nhead and neck, size and shape of bill, length and width of body, all are\r\ntaken into consideration. As a consequence, not more than one in ten\r\nwill be found to fill the bill, and my 2,500 breeding birds will be\r\nselected from many thousands. The result of all this care and solicitude\r\non my part has been extremely gratifying, as it has not only given me\r\nthe control of the fancy market, but the birds have always commanded a\r\nhigher price in the general market on account of their large size and\r\nfattening properties.\r\n\r\nAs the ducklings are now ready for market, it is necessary that the\r\ngrower should make some arrangements for disposing of them. He cannot\r\nafford to sell them alive to the carts, for though this may be a great\r\nconvenience to persons who grow a few fowls, the profits which enable\r\nthese parties to run their collecting carts all over the country, and\r\nhire men to pick and dress their fowls, will be quite an item in the\r\npocket of the one who grows on a large scale. The best plan for him is\r\nto hire an expert to do his picking for him, and if he cannot get one,\r\nto take lessons of one so that he can do it himself. This is a very\r\nparticular business, as there is a great knack in it. Years ago I\r\nthought I knew something about picking ducks, but after watching an\r\nexpert for thirty minutes I was enabled to double my day's work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis usually has the same effect upon others. For though it may be weeks\r\nbefore the tyro will be able to do what would be called a fair day's\r\nwork, yet if he keeps his wits about him, and is endowed with a fair\r\nshare of energy, there will be constant improvement. I received a letter\r\na short time since from a lady in Ohio, saying that she was very much\r\ninterested in growing ducklings, and was satisfied that there was money\r\nin it, but that her greatest trouble was in getting them picked, as it\r\ncancelled a large share of the profits, and that she hired a woman for\r\nthe purpose and paid her twenty-five cents apiece for picking; at the\r\nsame time saying that she could not bear to pay the woman less, as it\r\ntook her a half day to pick one duck.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethod of Dressing Ducklings.\r\n\r\nA fair day's work for an expert is forty ducks per day, though I have\r\nhad men who could pick seventy-five and do it well. The process is very\r\nsimple. All that is necessary is a chair, a box 2x3 feet and 2 feet high\r\nfor the feathers, a few knives, and a smart man to handle them. One\r\nknife should be double-edged and sharp-pointed, for bleeding. The bird\r\nshould be held between the knees, the bill held open with the left hand,\r\nand a cut made across the roof of the mouth just below the eyes. The\r\nbird should then be stunned by striking its head against a post, or some\r\nhard substance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe picker seats himself in the chair, with the bird in his lap, its\r\nhead held firmly between one knee and the box. The sooner he gets at it\r\nthe better, and if he is smart he will have the bird well plucked by the\r\ntime life is extinct. The feathers should be carefully sorted while\r\npicking; the wing and tail-feathers and pins thrown away and the body\r\nfeathers, with the down, thrown into the box. Care should be taken about\r\nthis, as the feathers are no mean source of income, and will always pay\r\nfor the picking. A dull knife should be used in connection with the\r\nthumb in removing the long pins, and, in fact, all that can be removed\r\nwithout tearing the skin. The down can usually be rubbed off by slightly\r\nmoistening the hand and holding the skin tight. As there are often some\r\npins which cannot be taken out without tearing and disfiguring the skin,\r\nand some down that will not rub off, they must be shaved off. A knife\r\nshould be kept for the purpose. This knife should be made of the finest\r\noil-tempered steel, and must be sharper than the best razor. The tops of\r\nthe wings should be left on, and the bird picked half way down the neck.\r\nThe bird should not be drawn nor the head removed. All this is in\r\nreality done in much shorter time than is required to describe it. The\r\nexpert performs his duties mechanically. The feathers actually seem to\r\nstick to his fingers, and he will in seven minutes pick a duck in far\r\nbetter shape than a novice would in an hour. The bird on being picked,\r\nshould, after the blood is washed carefully from the head, be thrown\r\ninto a barrel or tank of floating ice. It will harden up so that its\r\nrotundity of outline will be preserved.\r\n\r\nThis method is far better than that practiced by some parties, who pack\r\ntheir birds in ice at once, where the bodies are compressed into all\r\nmanner of shapes and harden up in that position, and never again can\r\nacquire that attractive appearance and rounded outline which a\r\nwell-fattened duckling should present. After the birds are hardened they\r\nshould be packed close in light boxes, back down, with the head under\r\nthe wing, and if your market is within twelve hours ride, can be safely\r\nshipped without ice, and they will always arrive in good condition.\r\nDealers like to have them come in this way, they look so much nicer and\r\nare far more saleable.\r\n\r\nI have boxes for the purpose, of different sizes, holding, when closely\r\npacked, twelve, eighteen and thirty-six pairs of birds. These boxes are\r\nlight, made of five-eighth inch pine, are strongly cleated at the\r\ncorners and ends, and are fitted with hinged covers, fastened down with\r\nclasps and screws. I find this much the best way, as the birds always\r\npreserve their shape and arrive in good condition, while express\r\ncompanies return the empty boxes free, and when they \"get the hang of\r\nit\" soon learn to deliver promptly and handle carefully.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to Ship Poultry.\r\n\r\nIn shipping poultry the first thing the young poulterer should do is to\r\nestablish a reputation among the first-class dealers in his vicinity.\r\nThis can only be done by shipping first-class stock. Never kill a bird\r\nunless it is in good condition. Pick and dress them neatly, box them\r\ncarefully, and they will always command a good price and a ready sale;\r\nwhile equally as good stock, slovenly and carelessly thrown together,\r\nwill go begging. I have often seen good stock cut several cents per\r\npound, owing to the shipper's carelessness.\r\n\r\nA prominent dealer in Boston said to me one day, pointing to a barrel of\r\npoultry, \"The man who shipped that stuff is a fool! Look here!\" He\r\nopened the barrel,--it was half full of ducks fairly well fatted and\r\npicked. But how those ducks looked. The shipper had evidently thrown\r\nthose birds in head first, or any way to suit, and then had thrown a lot\r\nof ice on the top. The barrel not being very clean, he had introduced\r\nblue paper between the ducks and barrel. The ice had melted, the barrel\r\nhad been capsized repeatedly during transit, and the paper had been\r\ncompletely disintegrated. It was stuck all over the ducks in little\r\npatches and rubbed in, while the birds had acquired a fine tint of blue\r\nthat would have done credit to a laundryman.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said the dealer, \"I shall have to cut that man four cents per\r\npound.\" If occasionally you should have poor stock always ship it by\r\nitself, and notify your dealer of its quality. He will know it soon\r\nenough without you telling him, but, at the same time, he will know that\r\nyou are not trying to put a poor article on him for a good one. One or\r\ntwo pairs of poor birds in a box of good ones will often affect the\r\nprice of the whole. Never pack a bird till after the animal heat is out.\r\nBy a close observance of the above, the time will soon come when you\r\nwill have no trouble in selling your stock. You will have more orders\r\nthan you will be able to fill.\r\n\r\nThe past season has been a very satisfactory one to us, as we have not\r\nonly largely increased our business, but the prices obtained have been\r\nbetter than ever before, while we have been overwhelmed with orders from\r\ndealers in New York and Boston which we have been wholly unable to fill.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the feathers. They should be taken up every day and\r\nspread out thinly on a dry floor, turned occasionally, and, in a few\r\ndays, when thoroughly dry, can be thrown in a heap. Do not neglect this,\r\nfor if allowed to accumulate they soon become offensive, and nothing but\r\nsuperheated steam will ever deordize them, and be sure that the feather\r\nfirms will always take advantage of this and charge you roundly for\r\ndoing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisinfecting the Ground a Necessity.\r\n\r\nWhen we first begin shipping for market, our yards are usually filled to\r\ntheir utmost capacity, and we are often crowded for room. As fast as the\r\nyards are emptied, they should be disinfected by turning them and\r\nsowing a crop of oats at once. By the time these oats are two or three\r\ninches high they can be reoccupied by young birds, so that two crops can\r\nbe grown upon the same ground each season.\r\n\r\nMy plan is this: I do not heat my brooding-house artificially after the\r\nfirst of June, as the building will always be warm enough at that date\r\nfor ducklings ten days old, without artificial heat. I locate some of my\r\nlarge duck-brooders a short distance apart out-of-doors, building a\r\nsquare pen in front of them, 8x12 feet, with boards a foot wide. Into\r\nthese brooders I put the newly-hatched ducklings as they come out. They\r\nneed artificial heat the first few days. Of course it would be poor\r\npolicy to run the heater for the benefit of a few when it would be a\r\ndecided injury to thousands.\r\n\r\nWhen the ducklings no longer require heat, which will be in a very few\r\ndays, I remove them at once, either to the brooding-house or to the\r\nvacated yards above mentioned, when by this time the oats will be high\r\nenough to furnish them with green food. The business is managed in this\r\nway as long as there are eggs to hatch. I use the eggs for incubating\r\nlong after I cease putting them out; for, if there is but one-third\r\nfertile, it is more profitable to hatch them than to market them, as the\r\nprices on young ducklings after the middle of October usually rule some\r\nthree or four cents higher per pound than during August and September.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and summer months, when things are under full headway,\r\nthere is naturally great care and responsibility. It will not do to make\r\ntoo many mistakes or neglect necessary duties. The young birds must be\r\nfed regularly and given the differently prepared foods according to\r\nage,--water supplied, grass and corn fodder cut and distributed\r\naccording to need. Lamps to trim and replenish, eight thousand eggs to\r\nturn twice each day; a new hatch of ducklings coming off nearly every\r\nday; the machine to be filled with nicely washed eggs; one to two\r\nthousand pounds of ducklings dressed and packed for market daily;\r\ncleaning and disinfecting yards; entertaining visitors, who flock here\r\nby dozens,--furnish all the occupation we need. Indeed, were it not for\r\nthe immense profits attending the business, we might consider it rather\r\nmore than we ought to do.\r\n\r\nI disinfect my duck yards with rye about Sept. 1. When, in this climate,\r\nfrost has destroyed all green vegetable life, then rye is in its prime.\r\nIf sowed September 1, in duck yards, it will attain a height of eighteen\r\ninches, and if sowed thickly will crop many tons to the acre. When\r\ncorn-fodder is gone, we use green clover, then turnip, cabbage and green\r\nrye in turn and then just before a snow storm we cut a large quantity of\r\nthe frozen rye and pile it up in the shade, where, of course, it will\r\nneither heat or thaw. Should we get out before the snow is gone, we\r\nalways have surplus of clover-rowen cured for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThis, together with refuse cabbage and boiled turnips, small potatoes,\r\netc., makes a fine winter diet on which breeding ducks will always\r\nthrive if the other ingredients are properly mixed,--a diet upon which,\r\ncombined with housing and plenty of exercise, the birds are bound to\r\ncontribute a good quota of strong fertile eggs. I mention this\r\nparticularly here, because the mortality among young birds will depend\r\nlargely upon the strength and vitality of the eggs from which they come.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural Duck-Culture.\r\n\r\nDoubtless some of my readers are getting impatient and saying to\r\nthemselves, \"Why do you not give us some ideas how to do this business\r\nin the natural way? Many of us wish to begin small. Every one has not\r\nthe conveniences to use or the means to command incubators.\" I am coming\r\nto that. I have a vivid recollection of using hens to incubate with some\r\ntwenty years ago; and the persistent obstinacy of the perverse birds,\r\nthe large proportion of valuable eggs spoiled and broken, as well as the\r\ntime consumed in caring for them, are still fresh in my memory. It was\r\nwholesome discipline for me. It will be the same to the reader, and\r\nenable him to appreciate a good incubator later on.\r\n\r\nA good, quiet hen, who attends closely to her business, will always\r\nhatch as large a proportion of her eggs as a good incubator; but there\r\nare so many with dispositions quite the opposite of this that it leaves\r\nthe odds largely in favor of the machine. Success with hens depends\r\nquite as much with the operator as with machines. He must begin right\r\nand hold out to the end. As ducks seldom make good incubators, he will\r\nhave to rely upon hens to do that business for him. The best breeds for\r\nthat purpose I have found to be the Brahma or Plymouth Rock. A cross of\r\nthese birds makes a good quiet sitter.\r\n\r\nThe birds must be got out early so that they will begin laying in the\r\nfall and be ready to incubate by the time you want them. It is well to\r\nhave a room for the purpose and have the sitters by themselves. The\r\nnests should be in rows around the room, the feeding and water-troughs\r\nin the centre, with the dust-bath at one end. The nest boxes should be\r\nsome fourteen inches square and about a foot high. Each one should be\r\nfurnished with a slide so that the bird can be confined when necessary.\r\nIf the slide is planed, all the better, as the date of the sitter can\r\nthen be marked on it. The first thing is to prepare the nests. There is\r\nquite a knack in this; indeed, success largely depends upon this one\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nThe best material for this is soft hay or straw, cut six or eight\r\ninches long, placed upon a soil bottom. The sides of this nest should be\r\npacked hard, the bottom smooth and slightly concaved, not too much, as\r\nthe tendency then would be to break the eggs if they crowded towards the\r\ncentre. There should be plenty of room in the nest for the bird's feet\r\nand legs and the eggs too, so that she can turn at will without danger\r\nof breaking them. A piece of tarred paper five or six inches square,\r\nshould be placed on the soil in the bottom of the nest; the whole\r\ncovered with a half inch of finely cut straw. A few porcelain eggs\r\nshould be placed in the nest, and when a hen shows a strong desire to\r\nincubate she should be placed upon the nest and the slide closed, giving\r\nthe bird all the air she needs.\r\n\r\nThis removal should be made after dark as the birds are always more\r\ngentle then. It is well to set a number of hens at once, if they can be\r\nhad, for reasons that will shortly appear. If the birds take kindly to\r\nthe porcelain eggs they can be removed the next evening and replaced\r\nwith ducks' eggs. As they are much larger than hen's eggs, nine or ten\r\nwill be enough in cold weather and eleven or twelve in warm;\r\nproportioned, of course, something to the size of the bird. I always\r\ntake the birds from their nests at a certain time every day; they will\r\nlearn to expect it. This should be done during the warmest part of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\nHandle Your Hens Carefully.\r\n\r\nNow is the time to exercise caution. Take your birds off carefully\r\nseveral at a time. If one should fly in your face, break her eggs and\r\nspatter the contents over your person, and you should feel like wringing\r\nher neck, don't do it; you would only be so much out. Take things easy,\r\ndon't get mad; she may do better next time, if not, replace her with one\r\nthat will. When taking your birds off in cold weather cover the eggs at\r\nonce with a circular piece of heavy paper previously prepared, and they\r\nwill not cool perceptibly during the fifteen minutes the birds are off.\r\nBe sure and return each bird to her own nest, for if you have an uneasy\r\nsitter, though she may spoil her own eggs, she should have no\r\nopportunity to spoil those of others.\r\n\r\nBesides, if you do not, hens that have been sitting but a day or two may\r\nbe placed upon eggs just ready to hatch when she will not take kindly to\r\nthe young birds as they hatch, and a great mortality is sure to follow.\r\nIf you should be running 100 sitters, the more you can take off at a\r\ntime the sooner you will get through. Have a sponge and warm water handy\r\nas you will have more or less broken eggs. The rest should be washed\r\nclean at once and returned to the nest. When hatching out be sure and\r\nremove the little ducklings, as fast as they come out, to a warm place\r\nto dry off, as owing to their long necks and peculiar shape the mother\r\nhen will unconsciously crush many more of them than she would of chicks.\r\nIn fact, they should never see the hen after being taken away, as they\r\ncan be grown to much better advantage, and with far less mortality, in\r\nbrooders.\r\n\r\nAnd just here is the great economy of setting six or eight hens at the\r\nsame time; the young ducklings can be all put together in one brooder\r\nand cared for with less trouble and with less mortality than that\r\nresulting from one hen with her brood. The ducklings should be confined\r\nin yards, the same care and feed given them as already recommended for\r\nartificially hatched birds. Allusion has already been made to the\r\nproverbial timidity of the Pekin duck. This sometimes causes trouble to\r\nthe grower when the birds are confined together in large numbers. When\r\nsix or eight weeks old, and even after they are full grown, they often\r\nget frightened, or gallied as it were, in dark nights. Being unable to\r\nsee, one bird will touch another, he will spring away and come in\r\ncontact with several more.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the whole are in the most violent commotion, whirling and\r\ntreading each other down. It will be a perfect stampede and will\r\nsometimes be kept up the entire night. After a night of such dissipation\r\nmany of the birds will appear completely jaded out, and some of them\r\nunable to rise. Of course, this must be stopped at once or the grower\r\nmay bid farewell to all fattening or laying on the part of the birds.\r\nHanging lanterns in the yards at stated distances will usually restore\r\norder. It will not be needed when there is a moon. See that there are no\r\nsharp projections in either yards or breeding-pens, as both old and\r\nyoung birds are often lamed for life by simply coming in contact with\r\nthem in the night.\r\n\r\nToo much care cannot be exercised on this point, as the bones of the\r\nbirds are so small and their bodies so frail. As has been intimated\r\nbefore, ducks are not subject to so many diseases as hens,--while they\r\nare entirely free from lice or body parasites of any kind. Indeed, I\r\nnever saw a louse on a duck in all my experience. Still, it cannot be\r\ndenied that good sanitary conditions, together with plenty of pure air\r\nand water, will not only greatly increase the egg-production, but\r\nfacilitate the growth and improve the properties of the duckling.\r\n\r\nDucklings when confined to yards are sometimes troubled with sore eyes.\r\nThe adjacent parts become inflamed, the head slightly swelled. This is\r\ncaused by feeding sloppy food, and from filthy quarters. The feathers\r\naround the eyes become filled with the food, the dust adheres to them.\r\nThe eye is naturally inflamed. Washing out thoroughly and bathing the\r\neye with a little sweet oil will usually effect a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiarrhoea.\r\n\r\nYoung ducklings are sometimes afflicted with diarrhoea. This disease is\r\ncaused more by overheating brooders and the exhausted condition of the\r\nmother bird than from improper food. Do not overfeed or overheat the\r\nducklings. Feed bread or cracker crumbs, moistened with boiled milk,\r\ninto which a little powdered chalk has been dusted.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbnormal Livers.\r\n\r\nThis disease is the most dangerous to which young ducks are subject. It\r\nis seldom prevalent except during the warm weather, and usually in young\r\nbirds of from two to six weeks of age. The livers of the young birds\r\nenlarge to such an extent as to force up their backs,--a deformity which\r\nwill cling to them through life. It is caused by a complete stagnation\r\nof the digestive organs, and often makes its appearance after a heavy\r\nrain, or long wet spell, when the yards are invariably wet, sloppy and\r\noffensive. The young birds will, while in constant contact with this\r\nmud, absorb more or less of it, clogging the digestive organs, and\r\nderanging their appetites. Remove the birds to some dry, shady place,\r\nfeed sparingly, and give a little of the \"Douglas mixture\" in the\r\ndrinking water.\r\n\r\n\r\nDucklings must be Carefully Yarded While Young.\r\n\r\nA great mortality often occurs to young ducklings when allowed free\r\nrange during warm weather, from devouring injurious insects. Bees,\r\nwasps, hornets, bugs of all descriptions, are eagerly swallowed alive\r\nbut not always with impunity, and the birds often pay the penalty with\r\ntheir lives. Always confine them, even when designed for breeding\r\npurposes, until they are six weeks old, when they can be allowed their\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThe most of the diseases to which ducks and fowls are subject can\r\nusually be traced to some infraction of conditions, and of course are\r\nalways more or less under the control of the careful operator. Two young\r\nmen called here a short time ago wishing to know what was the trouble\r\nwith their fowls. Hitherto they had occupied a cold building, so open\r\nthat the snow sifted through on them, and they had never to their\r\nrecollection had a diseased fowl. Within a year they had put up a nice,\r\nwarm building with a glass front, and their fowls had been diseased ever\r\nsince. They had shut their birds in a building that would run up to 100\r\ndegrees during the day and that would go down nearly to zero at night,\r\nsubjecting their fowls to thermal changes, under which neither animal or\r\nvegetable life could possibly live, and then expect them to thrive.\r\n\r\nThe amateur poulterer should understand in the beginning that it is far\r\neasier to anticipate disease in poultry than to cure it. Where fowls are\r\nkept in large numbers, their health and well-being can only be insured\r\nby extreme care and cleanliness, together with a free use of\r\ndisinfectants. Buildings should be kept dry, clean and sweet, and not\r\ntoo warm. The greater the variety of food the better, so long as it is\r\nhealthy and nutritious; while gravel, sand, shell and granulated\r\ncharcoal should be kept by them during confinement in winter.\r\n\r\nI am often asked by parties, \"Why do so many would-be poulterers fail if\r\nit is a legitimate business and fairly profitable?\" I reply, I am not\r\nprepared to concede the point that the proportional number of failures\r\nin the poultry business is greater than among other vocations in life.\r\nHundreds of men fail every year in mercantile, manufacturing and\r\nbrokerage pursuits. People do not decry any legitimate business from\r\nthis cause, because they know there are hundreds who are not only\r\ngetting a livelihood, but are amassing fortunes at them. There are\r\nhundreds, yes thousands, of farms on the market in New England today,\r\nfor less than the value of the buildings, because their owners have made\r\nfailures of them. Do men denounce agriculture? No! Because they know\r\nthat from time immemorial men have not only secured an honest living,\r\nbut have gained a competence from tilling the soil. You simply say that\r\nit is the men. Why not be equally frank with the poultry business?\r\n\r\nThey say the whole thing is contrary to nature, and you can't improve\r\nupon nature. Can't we? That is just what man is placed upon this\r\nsublunary sphere for, and he must begin by improving himself. With the\r\npresent opportunities for obtaining information, no one has a right to\r\nremain ignorant because he begins by making a failure of himself; and\r\nwhen a man has failed in the poultry business or elsewhere, it is simply\r\nwant of that indomitable pluck, energy, and perseverence, which are the\r\nrequisites of success everywhere, coupled with a disinclination to\r\nsacrifice his comfort and ease, or conform his life to his business\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nAgain, we hear that artificially grown fowls are stunted and small, the\r\nflesh tasteless and insipid, and many other things which have no shadow\r\nof truth in them. I append the testimonials of some of the largest\r\npoultry dealers both in Boston and New York cities, who cheerfully and\r\nvoluntarily testify to the superiority of our artificially-grown birds.\r\nThese firms are square and honest dealers, and we heartily recommend\r\nthem to any who stand in need of their services.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored in this little book to impart what little knowledge I\r\npossess on this important subject to the reader. If he can learn wisdom\r\nby my experience and avoid the errors into which I fell, it is all I\r\nask. The business, as I have learned its details, has become more\r\nprofitable each year; while the experience of the past season has been\r\nhighly satisfactory, as the demand has been greater than ever before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMULAS FOR FEEDING DUCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Breeding Birds.\r\n\r\n(Old and young, during the Fall.)\r\n\r\nWe turn them out to pasture, when we can, in lots of 200.\r\n\r\nFeed three parts wheat-bran; one part low grade flour; one part corn\r\nmeal; five per cent. of beef-scrap; three per cent. of grit, and all the\r\ngreen feed they will eat, in the shape of corn-fodder, cut fine, clover\r\nor oat-fodder. Feed this mixture twice a day, all they will eat.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Laying Birds.\r\n\r\nEqual parts of wheat-bran and corn meal; ten per cent. beef-scrap;\r\ntwenty per cent. of low grade flour; ten per cent. of boiled turnips or\r\npotatoes; fifteen per cent. of clover-rowen, green rye or refuse\r\ncabbage, chopped fine; three per cent. of grit. Feed twice a day, all\r\nthey will eat, with a lunch of corn and oats at noon. Keep grit and\r\nground oyster shells constantly by them. We never cook the food for our\r\nducks, but mix it with cold water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Feeding at Different Stages of Growth.\r\n\r\nThe first four days, feed four parts wheat-bran; one part corn-meal; one\r\npart low grade flour; five per cent. fine grit. Feed four times a day,\r\nwhat they will eat clean.\r\n\r\nWhen from four days to four weeks old, feed four parts wheat-bran; one\r\npart corn-meal; one part low-grade flour; three per cent. fine grit;\r\nfive per cent. of fine ground beef-scrap, soaked. Finely cut green\r\nclover, rye or cabbage. Feed four times a day.\r\n\r\nWhen from four to eight weeks old, feed three parts wheat-bran; one part\r\ncorn-meal; one part low-grade flour; five per cent. of fine grit; five\r\nper cent. of beef-scrap. Mix in green food. One per cent. fine oyster\r\nshells. Feed four times a day.\r\n\r\nWhen from six to eight weeks old, feed equal parts corn-meal; wheat-bran\r\nand fifteen per cent. low grade flour; ten per cent. of beef-scrap; ten\r\nper cent. of green food; three per cent. of grit. Feed three times a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWhen from eight to ten weeks old, feed one half corn-meal; equal parts\r\nof wheat-bran and low grade flour; ten per cent. of beef-scrap; three\r\nper cent. of grit. Oyster shells and less green food. Feed three times a\r\nday. They should now be ready for market.\r\n\r\nNote.--The above ingredients should be made into a mash, and should be\r\ncrumbly, not pasty. Proportions by measure, not weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION BUREAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION 1.--Why do my ducks not lay? I feed them all the corn they will\r\neat.\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Ducks will not lay on hard grain alone. They should have a mash\r\ncomposed of equal parts wheat-bran, corn-meal, and twenty per cent. low\r\ngrade flour, with about one-quarter green food and vegetables; ten per\r\ncent. of beef-scrap, with grit and oyster shells.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 2.--My ducklings are weak in the legs, cannot stand, and soon\r\ndie. What is the matter?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Your trouble is too highly concentrated food and too much of\r\nit. Feed on mash composed largely of wheat-bran, low-grade flour and\r\nabout fifteen per cent. of corn-meal. Mix in plenty of green food, as\r\ngreen rye, clover, corn-fodder, etc. Ten per cent. of ground beef-scrap,\r\nor other animal food; five per cent. of coarse sand. This diet is\r\nabsolutely necessary to properly develop the bird and form flesh, bone\r\nand feathers. Feed sparingly. This is essential, as it invites exercise,\r\nwhich is much needed during close confinement in inclement weather.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 3.--My ducklings are troubled with sore eyes and do not seem to\r\nthrive, what can I do for them?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--This disease savors of filthy quarters, and yet it is not\r\nalways attributed to that. Improper assimilation of food through want of\r\ngrit and other ingredients will have a tendency in the same direction. A\r\ngummy secretion exudes from the eyes, hardening up among the feathers\r\naround them, seriously retarding the growth and development of the bird.\r\nFeed sparingly of light food with plenty of grit, and sprinkle a little\r\nginger in their food. Remove the bird to clean quarters and a few days\r\nwill usually effect a cure.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 4.--I am losing my ducklings from diarrhoea. Have but twenty\r\nleft out of eighty, and they are not ten days old. Please counsel me?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--This disease may have several causes, though I am convinced\r\nthat the food has but little to do with it. It may originate through the\r\ndegenerate condition of the parent bird, and consequent want of vitality\r\nin the egg from which the little bird comes out in no shape to live; or\r\nfrom the extremes of heat and cold to which the eggs have been subjected\r\nduring the process of incubation; or from the same cause after the\r\nlittle duckling has been placed in the brooder. I am convinced that with\r\na careful selection of the proper ingredients in feeding the old bird,\r\nand a reasonable control of the heat in the incubator and brooder (if\r\nthey are good ones), there need be but little apprehension from this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 5.--My breeding birds have the gapes. They stretch their necks\r\nand gape, eat nothing, and die in a few days. Can you diagnose the case\r\nand help me?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--This is undoubtedly a lung trouble, for on dissecting the\r\nbirds, I have always found the lungs not only highly inflamed but nearly\r\ngone. For years I had supposed this disease incurable, and incidental to\r\nbird and clime, but later experience has convinced me that it is not\r\nonly largely under control but easily anticipated. First, I never knew a\r\ncase in summer or early spring, when the birds were not confined to\r\nbuildings but had free and open range, and only when confined during\r\ninclement weather, so that it is more or less a denizen of foul air and\r\nfilthy quarters.\r\n\r\nI would much rather have my breeding houses freeze a little than to have\r\nthem filled with foetid air, and the birds breathe over and over again\r\nthe ammonia arising from their own excrements. It is one thing for the\r\nbirds to be confined over their own ordure, their nostrils but a few\r\ninches from it, but quite another with the attendant in the walk with\r\nhis nose six feet away. He may think his buildings quite clean and free\r\nfrom noxious gases, but could his ducks speak they would tell him a\r\ndifferent story. This disease, if taken in the early stages, can usually\r\nbe cured. Isolate the bird with the first appearance of trouble, in a\r\nwarm, dry place. Feed on food formula for little ducklings. Mix a little\r\ncayenne pepper in the food, a little Douglas Mixture in the drinking\r\nwater, and a large proportion of the affected birds may be saved. Keep\r\nyour breeding birds dry and clean when confined.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 6.--I turned my ducklings out in a grass plot today and have\r\nlost nearly one-third of them. What is the cause?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--This may result from two causes. Ducklings from two to four\r\nweeks old are ravenous birds and will devour all manner of insects\r\nwithin their reach, which they do not stop to kill. Bees, wasps, hornets\r\nand beetles of all descriptions are acceptable, and the little birds,\r\nthemselves, often pay the penalty with their lives. Again, at that age,\r\nthey are extremely sensitive to the heat of the sun, and they must have\r\nshade. Years ago, we sometimes lost twenty birds out of a hundred in\r\nthirty minutes, before we knew the cause.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 7.--How many birds should constitute a breeding-yard?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Twenty-five is enough unless the birds have free range, then\r\nfifty may run together with safety.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 8.--How shall I proportion the sexes for the best results?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Five ducks to one drake. Later in the season, six or eight\r\nducks to one drake.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 9.--How can I distinguish the sexes?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--It is easy for the expert to detect the sex of the bird when\r\nvery young. The drake has a longer bill, neck and body, with a more\r\nupright carriage. At two months old the duck may be distinguished by her\r\ncoarse quack, the drake by a fine, rasping noise, and later on by the\r\ncurled feathers in his tail.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 10.--How soon will a young duck begin laying?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--At about five months old, often at four and a half months old.\r\nAt present, September 1st, we are getting some three dozen eggs per day\r\nfrom our young birds, and we are trying to hold them back all we can by\r\nlight feeding.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 11.--Which will lay first, old or young birds?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Young birds will usually lay from two to three weeks before the\r\nold ones, but as the first eggs of the old birds are usually more\r\nfertile than eggs from the young ones, there is very little discrepancy\r\nin the result.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 12.--How many eggs will a Pekin duck lay in a season?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--About one hundred and forty. Their fecundity is wonderful,\r\nexcelling that of any other duck. We have birds in some yards with a\r\nrecord of one hundred and sixty-five eggs to each bird.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 13.--To what age is it profitable to keep a duck?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--We have kept them till four years old with good results. If not\r\nforced they may be kept longer to advantage.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 14.--Is there a market for their eggs, and at what price?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Pekin duck eggs sell readily in market, as they are much larger\r\nthan the other duck eggs. They command from five to ten cents per dozen\r\nmore than hen's eggs.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 15.--How much does it cost to keep a duck each season?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--From $1.75 to $2.00. They are gross feeders, of bulky food, but\r\nthe greater number and value of the eggs in market over the average hen,\r\nmakes the duck more profitable as an egg-producer than the hen.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 16.--At what season are the eggs of a duck most fertile?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--During the months of February, March, April and May, though\r\nthey are usually fertile with us during January, June, and even July.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 17.--What per cent. of the eggs will usually hatch?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--That depends entirely upon how the mother-bird is cared for and\r\nfed. See formula for laying birds.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 18.--What is the average loss sustained in growing ducklings?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Not more than two per cent. with us, but it depends largely\r\nupon how the old birds are fed; how the eggs are incubated, and the\r\nyoung birds cared for.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 19.--How many birds can be safely kept in one brooder and one\r\nyard?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--About one hundred, and as they grow older, unless the yards are\r\nof good size, a less number would grow and fat better.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 20.--At what age should the young birds be put upon the market?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--When the prices are very high in the early spring we market\r\nthem at about nine weeks old, when they will dress from ten to eleven\r\npounds per pair. Later on, when prices are lower, we market them at ten\r\nto eleven weeks old, when they will dress from twelve to thirteen\r\npounds per pair.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 21.--When and how do you select your breeding birds?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--As soon as we can distinguish the quality and merits of the\r\nbird, and from our earliest hatches, as they always develop into larger\r\nand better birds.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 22.--How do you treat the young birds for breeding purposes?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Turn them out to pasture, and feed lightly on food calculated\r\nto develop bone, muscle and feathers.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 23.--What shall I do to keep my ducks still in the night, when\r\nthey make a great noise and commotion? Some of them are broken down and\r\ncannot stand.\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Hang a lantern in their yard. You must keep them still.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 24.--Can ducks be shipped safely any distance?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--We ship ducks safely all over the United States, Canada and\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 25.--Would you recommend incubator or hens for hatching duck's\r\neggs?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Incubator, by all means, if hatched in large quantities.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 26.--Would you use brooders, if hatched under hens?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Brooders are better than hens, for two reasons. It is less\r\ntrouble to care for them. Hens crush large numbers of them when small.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 27.--How long can the eggs be kept for hatching?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--They can be kept three weeks, safely, if kept on end, in a cool\r\nplace, but should prefer them fresher.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 28.--Can Pekin ducks be crossed with other breeds profitably?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--From our experience, we can say no. In every case it has\r\nrequired longer time to mature the mongrels, and as the prices decline\r\nin the early spring, this is quite an item, besides the introduction of\r\ncolored feathers injures the appearance of the dressed bird, as well as\r\nthe quality of the feathers, which is also quite an item.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 29.--What is the price of duck's feathers in the market?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Formerly, white duck feathers commanded fifty cents per pound,\r\nbut since white feathers have been imported from Russia in such\r\nquantities, ours average about forty-five cents per pound.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 30.--What makes their wings turn out from their bodies?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--This is often caused by the rapid development of the bird. The\r\nresting feathers on the sides under the wings, do not keep pace with the\r\nrapid growth of the bird, and the constant efforts of the bird to keep\r\nthe wings in place, tends to turn the wings outward. We have always\r\nnoticed that these are invariably the best birds.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 31.--Which are the most profitable, ducks or chickens?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--This will depend upon whether the grower is a care-taker, or\r\nwhether he is careless, lazy or untidy. We think that ducks will bear\r\nmore neglect than chicks, but it will not do to presume upon that, as\r\nducks will not thrive in filth more than chicks. We think that the\r\naverage price of chicks in market is rather higher than that of ducks,\r\nbut as it costs at least two cents less per pound to produce duck flesh,\r\nthan that of the chick, there is very little difference.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 32.--Where are the best markets for ducks?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Good markets may be found in all of our large cities, though we\r\nthink New York and Boston the best. Sometimes, when large shipments\r\nproduce a glut in the New York markets, the surplus is shipped to\r\nBoston, where it may be a cent or two higher. Then in a few days things\r\nmay be reversed and the exodus be the other way, and as the freight is\r\nonly one-half cent per pound between the two cities, I have known tons\r\nto be shipped at a time.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 33.--What would a plant cost, with a capacity of 5,000\r\nducklings, per year?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--With good machines, and buildings barely practical, $1,500 (if\r\neconomically expended) would cover cost, independent of land.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 34.--What effect does extremes of heat and cold have upon young\r\nducklings?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--After they are a week old they will stand much more of either\r\nthan chicks.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 35.--Is the flesh of birds artificially grown, as good as that\r\ngrown in the natural manner?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Just as good. The quality of the flesh depends entirely upon\r\nthe care and feed given the birds.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 36.--How large should the yards be in which the breeding birds\r\nare kept?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--At least one hundred feet long, where the buildings are long,\r\nand the width of the pens in which the birds are housed.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 37.--Do you think it will pay to grow celery to flavor the\r\nflesh of the birds?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--We have never done so, and parties who have grown celery for\r\nthat purpose, have discontinued it as being unprofitable in the end, as\r\nthey were not able to obtain increased prices for their product.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 38.--What is the best green food for ducks, old and young?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Green clover, green corn-fodder, rye, oats and clover-rowen\r\ncured nicely, with green rye, in winter when ground is bare.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 39.--Should Pekin duck eggs be pure white?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Yes.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 40.--Should a pure bred Pekin have any black feathers?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--No. The feathers should be a creamy white. Dark feathers are a\r\nsign of mongrel stock.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 41.--Will rain injure young ducklings?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--They are as susceptible to rain as chicks up to three weeks of\r\nage, but after that, will endure more, and at eight or ten weeks old,\r\nwill really enjoy a good rain storm.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 42.--How large do Pekin ducks grow?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--We have had drakes to tip the scales at 13 pounds each, though\r\nthis is somewhat rare. The past season, one of our drakes weighed 9-1/2\r\npounds, dressed, at 10 weeks old.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 43.--What is the weight of Pekin duck eggs?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--In the height of the season, ours weigh about 3 pounds to the\r\ndozen.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 44.--Is wet, marshy land suitable for ducks?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Should prefer dry land contiguous to a stream or pond.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 45.--How many duck eggs should be placed under one hen?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--From nine to eleven, depending upon the size of the hen.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 46.--How long does it require to incubate duck eggs?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Pekin eggs twenty-seven days. Muscovy eggs thirty-two days,\r\nsame as geese.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 47.--Do Pekin ducks sit well on eggs?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--No. They are unreliable. Hens are better. A good incubator\r\nstill better.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 48.--If you were a young man, with the same experience you have\r\nnow, would you enter the poultry business?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--I certainly would, for two reasons. First, because it is a\r\ncongenial occupation to me; second, it is by far the most profitable of\r\nany branch of farm industry.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 49.--Who is the best commission dealer in Boston market to whom\r\nI could consign my product?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--We consider Adams and Chapman, North Market St., safe and\r\nreliable, and a first-class firm in every respect.\r\n\r\nQUESTION 50.--Who is the best retail dealer?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--We consider Nathan Robbins Co., Quincy Market, as A-1. They\r\nhave handled a large part of our product for many years, and we would\r\nheartily recommend them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Imperial Pekin Ducks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe run one of the largest duck farms in America; and the birds in our\r\nbreeding pens are the very choicest, carefully selected, from the\r\nthousands we raise, and are all bred from our premium yards. We feel\r\njustly proud of our birds; for not only have they won all the premiums\r\nat New England State Fairs, but throughout the West, South and Canada.\r\nOur birds cannot be duplicated in North America. We confidently\r\nchallenge competition; and, strange to say, the birds in our yards are\r\nnow far superior to our best imported birds. They thrive better on our\r\nfeed and in our climate than in that in which they originated. The\r\nBoston and New York marketmen have repeatedly assured us that our ducks\r\nare the best that come into the market, and as a natural consequence we\r\nhave not been able to fill our orders for market ducks. Our birds have\r\ndressed, on an average, the past season, twelve pounds per pair, at nine\r\nand ten weeks old. We have now 2,500 of these mammoth birds in our\r\nbreeding pens, and we are prepared to fill all orders for both birds and\r\neggs at reasonable prices.\r\n\r\nOur young birds commence laying at five months old, lay through the fall\r\nmonths, moult slightly during the first of December, and about the\r\nmiddle of December begin again. The average number of eggs laid by our\r\nducks we find, after careful computation, to be about 140 each\r\nyear--more than our best hens. Our birds and eggs have given universal\r\nsatisfaction wherever they have gone; and we have numerous letters from\r\nour patrons, expressing themselves as more than satisfied with their\r\nbargains.\r\n\r\nOur prices range as follows:\r\n\r\n     Per pair, according to size and quality, from    $4.00 to $6.00\r\n     Per trio, according to size and quality, from     6.00 to 9.00\r\n     Exhibition birds, each $5.00, or                 10.00 per pair\r\n     Eggs from our choice yards, per setting of 15     2.00\r\n     Eggs from our       \"       per two settings      3.50\r\n     Eggs from our       \"       per fifty             5.00\r\n     Eggs from our       \"       per hundred           8.00\r\n     Eggs from our       \"       per thousand         70.00\r\n\r\n     The above prices may seem large to some, but when it is known that\r\n     many of the birds we now offer for sale were worth June 1st, $1.50\r\n     each in the market, and that we have kept them for the last six\r\n     months at a cost of not less than fifty cents each, it is easy to\r\n     see that the profits are not large. Our maximum price for market\r\n     birds the present season was thirty cents per pound; the minimum,\r\n     eighteen cents.\r\n\r\n     Our ducks are all hatched and raised artificially, and are put upon\r\n     the market at a cost not exceeding six cents per pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTIMONIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEKIN DUCKS.\r\n\r\nNILES, Ohio, Oct. 28, 1905.\r\n\r\nMR. JAMES RANKIN, South Easton, Mass.:\r\n\r\nDear Sir--\r\n\r\nThe ducks arrived safely and prompt, and I thank you very much for\r\nsending such fine large ducks--why they are more like geese as far as\r\nsize. I also thank you for the prompt attention given my order.\r\n\r\nThe poor little duck I kept of the ones raised by me this year looks\r\nvery small--only about one-third the size of those received from you,\r\nand I thought her quite a respectable size before.

If he sends the same kind to every\r\nperson, he is certainly a detriment to the business. He excused himself\r\nby saying that he was away from home; then he retains incompetent help.\r\nNo criticism whatever can be made of your selection, and the ducks you\r\nsent us are as good as your reputation, and the latter is the best in\r\nthis part of the country.\r\n\r\nWe shall probably want a few show birds this fall, and will write you\r\nlater.

We took them out immediately on arrival, and the one that was\r\nslightly lamed has come out all right. The other fellow died. Probably\r\ngot hard usage somewhere on the road. The lot right through was a very\r\nnice lot.\r\n\r\nThe second lot arrived in fine condition, and the two lots together are\r\nentirely satisfactory every way. Do not see how any one could ask for\r\nanything nicer.\r\n\r\nThe hundred we had from you last year were equally as good, however, in\r\nfact, can see no difference.

Received 15 eggs, more\r\nthan I expected for a sitting. Two were cracked, as the basket looked as\r\nif it had been handled roughly by the Express Co. Out of the thirteen\r\n(13) remainder, were hatched eleven ducks, but the hen killed two of\r\nthem on the nest. That left nine (9) fine little ducks, which are all\r\nalive at present and doing nicely--the largest I ever saw for their age.\r\nThey are now but ten days old, but I would not take five dollars for\r\nthem, as they look as if they were going to make fine big fellows.

They arrived safe and well, and\r\nit is but due to you to say, in size and beauty they exceeded my most\r\nsanguine expectations. They are indeed handsome birds. Many persons who\r\nsaw them took them to be geese. I thank you for your promptness in\r\nfilling my order, etc.\r\n\r\nYours truly, V. S. KILBY.\r\n\r\nI. W.

They are the finest looking ducks I ever saw and I have seen\r\nmany thousands. I am more than pleased with them.

RUDD & SON,\r\n\r\nNo. 10 Merchants' Row, Boston.\r\n\r\nFriend Rankin--With the exception of yourself, we doubtless hatch and\r\nraise more poultry, by actual count, than any one on this continent. We\r\ndo it entirely by artificial means, and shall never employ any other so\r\nlong as we raise poultry at all and retain our senses.\r\n\r\nAt our headquarters, in Boston, we receive and handle, to say the very\r\nleast, as many market ducks as any firm in the city, and unless we are\r\ndull scholars, we ought to form a pretty accurate opinion of the\r\nrelative merits of natural and artificial methods of incubation; or\r\nperhaps better expressed, the comparative quality of poultry raised by\r\neach, whether designed for market or other purposes. We were looking\r\nover our breeding stock the other day, and certainly never saw so\r\nhandsome a lot for so large numbers, and we should have to travel as far\r\nas South Easton to find as fine a flock of ducks.\r\n\r\nThe best market ducks that reach Boston (present company excepted, of\r\ncourse), are sent there by yourself and your brother, William Rankin of\r\nBrockton; not only are they two or three weeks in advance of others, but\r\nbeing grown with so great rapidity gives them that fineness and firmness\r\nof flesh, a superior flavor, and excellence in general appearance which\r\ncannot be found--or at least never is found--in ducks raised in the\r\nnatural way, and which must necessarily be kept much longer to attain\r\nthe same height.\r\n\r\nWe could refer you to the proprietors of five of the leading hotels in\r\nthe city, who state that the artificially-hatched ducks furnished by us\r\nduring the last few years are by far the best they ever used, and that\r\nsince the raising of ducks had thus been reduced to a science, fully\r\ntwice as many as formerly are now daily called for by the guests, and\r\nconsequently the demand is correspondingly increased, and we predict it\r\nwill continue to increase indefinitely. Your ducks sell quicker and\r\nbring more per pound than any we get. Next come those raised and sent by\r\nMr. Carpenter and Mr. Otis, both, like ourselves, using your machines.\r\n\r\nBy the way, we have now secured Mr. Otis for our superintendent at the\r\nBrighton farm, and his well-known skill and experience, combined with\r\nour own, will render it necessary for you to keep your eye peeled and\r\nlook to your laurels, lest you find yourself playing second fiddle.\r\nFraternally and very truly,\r\n\r\nW. H. RUDD & SON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the Boston Marketmen Say About Our Ducks.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Aug. 8, 1898.\r\n\r\nThe ducks we received from Maple Farm Duck Yards are the largest and\r\nbest we find in the market.\r\n\r\nNATHAN ROBBINS CO.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Aug. 6, 1898.\r\n\r\nWe give the preference to ducks shipped us from Maple Farm Duck Yards\r\nover all others, as we consider them the largest and fattest on the\r\nmarket.

I have about one hundred ducks which I thought were large and\r\nwere the admiration of all who saw them, but the ones from you beat\r\nanything I ever saw. Quite a number asked me what I was going to do with\r\nthe geese, and could hardly believe they were ducks. When in want of any\r\nmore ducks will send direct to you.\r\n\r\nYours truly, W. E.

These are the\r\nslow but sure kind, the kind that helps raise the mortgage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMico-Spar Cubical Grit produces this kind of paying hens because it\r\n_makes_ and _keeps_ hens healthy. It creates perfect digestion because\r\nit keeps things in the crop on the move, owing to the fact that the\r\ncorners of the cube always remain sharp. Honest, practical tests have\r\nshown that Mico Spar Cubical Grit is the hen's _choice_, and that the\r\nminutest cube left in the crop retains its sharp corners.\r\n\r\nMico-Spar Cubical Grit is not a hen food or powder. Its use is to tone\r\n_naturally_ the entire system. It is an economical Grit because it does\r\nnot crush in handling, because its bright shining surface in the\r\nscratching pen attracts the hen, thereby preventing loss, and because no\r\noyster shells are needed.\r\n\r\nIf you are a hen raiser put Mico-Spar Cubical Grit on the hen yard menu\r\nand you will prove that Mico Spar Cubical Grit is _worth crowing over_.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL MINERAL CO. - - 120 TREMONT ST., BOSTON\r\n\r\nMICA CRYSTAL GRIT\r\n\r\nWe buy this Grit by the carload and find it the best we have ever\r\nused.
