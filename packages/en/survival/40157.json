It is the result of\r\nexperiments conducted by the author himself, and he feels that it\r\nshould be of interest to many and of value to the few who are looking\r\nfor fields for profitable investment. It is the author's aim to issue\r\na more elaborate work on the same subject sometime during the early\r\npart of next year.\r\n\r\nW. A. E.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Louisiana Mink. Notice the Small Eyes, and the Low,\r\nRounded Ears, Scarcely Projecting Beyond the Adjacent Fur.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the following description of the American mink I am indebted to\r\nthe Encyclopædia Britannica:\r\n\r\n     \"In size it much resembles the English polecat--the length of the\r\n     head and body being usually from fifteen to eighteen inches; that\r\n     of the tail to the end of the hair about nine inches. The female is\r\n     considerably smaller than the male. The tail is bushy, but tapering\r\n     at the end. The ears are small, low, rounded, and scarcely project\r\n     beyond the adjacent fur. The pelage consists of a dense, soft,\r\n     matted under-fur, mixed with long, stiff, lustrous hairs on all\r\n     parts of the body and tail. The gloss is greatest on the upper\r\n     parts; on the tail the bristly hairs predominate. Northern\r\n     specimens have the finest and most glistening pelage; in those\r\n     from the southern regions there is less difference between the\r\n     under- and over-fur, and the whole pelage is coarser and harsher.\r\n     In color, different specimens present a considerable range of\r\n     variation, but the animal is ordinarily of a rich, dark brown,\r\n     scarcely or not paler below than on the general upper parts; but\r\n     the back is usually the darkest, and the tail is nearly black. The\r\n     under jaw, from the chin about as far back as the angle of the\r\n     mouth, is generally white. In the European mink the upper lip is\r\n     also white, but, as this occasionally occurs in American specimens,\r\n     it fails as an absolutely distinguishing character. Besides the\r\n     white on the chin, there are often other irregular white patches on\r\n     the under parts of the body. In very rare instances the tail is\r\n     tipped with white. The fur, like that of most of the animals of the\r\n     group to which it belongs, is an important article of commerce.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fur market has always been a good market. It has grown firmer and\r\nstronger from year to year, while the prices for furs have been\r\nadvancing steadily and rapidly with the growing demand for furs in\r\nEurope and America, and with the general increasing scarcity of all\r\nfur-bearing animals. Mink fur advanced about fifty per cent. during\r\nthe last two seasons, and there is every reason to believe that the\r\nmink fur in Louisiana will advance to about six dollars within the\r\ncoming three years. The minks caught in Louisiana last season were\r\nsold at an average price of three dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Resting in a Warm Place. Notice the Long Body\r\nand Its Shape.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In a Position to Jump. Notice the Long Tail.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFur-bearing animals are becoming scarce where they were once so\r\nplentiful, and, like the buffaloes that roamed this country in such\r\ngreat numbers, they will soon, many of them, become extinct if the\r\npresent rate of trapping continues to obtain in America. Already\r\ncertain fur animals are almost trapped out and are rare. Even the\r\nalligator, which was so plentiful a few years ago in the swamps of\r\nLouisiana, is hardly sought after any more for its hide because of its\r\nscarcity.\r\n\r\nThe laws enacted by the various State legislatures for the protection\r\nof fur-bearing animals, in fact, offer no protection; for most furs\r\ncaught out of season have no market value, and for that reason are not\r\ncaught.\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana a trapper has to procure a hunting license if he wishes\r\nto carry a gun while trapping, which license costs only one dollar and\r\nis good for one season only. Such a low license, while it may bring a\r\nlarge revenue to the State, clearly has no element of protection in\r\nit. On the contrary, it is a truth that it stimulates both hunting and\r\ntrapping, as there were more trappers in Louisiana last season than\r\nbefore the law requiring this license came into effect. Every trapper\r\nprocures a hunting license whether he carries a gun or not, and most\r\ntrappers believe the law requires them to have this license to trap.\r\n\r\nWhatever is being done for the protection of fur-bearing animals in\r\nLouisiana, the fact remains that they are fast disappearing. Old and\r\nexperienced trappers will tell you that minks were very difficult to\r\ntrap last season as compared with the seasons of a few years ago, when\r\nthey could be so easily trapped in dead-falls. Raccoons, too, which\r\nwere so numerous in the rear of old cornfields during the trapping\r\nseasons, have diminished at a surprising rate within the last three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Female of Two Years.]\r\n\r\nWhile laws are being adopted by different States for the regulation of\r\ntrapping to protect fur-bearing animals, it is time for those who\r\nexpect to make money with fur in the future to begin raising their own\r\nanimals. The time is almost here when trapping will be unprofitable.\r\nFur animals will be too scarce to make anything at it. Then people\r\nwill have to build farms in which to breed minks for their fur, and\r\nmink farms will become common. Minks are the most valuable fur-bearing\r\nanimals in Louisiana, being the most numerous, and they are also the\r\neasiest and most profitable to breed for their fur.\r\n\r\nBreeding minks in Louisiana for their fur can be made a very\r\nprofitable industry. There is more to be made at it than raising\r\nhorses, hogs or cattle. After a farm is once completed and stocked,\r\nall expense is about over if there is a large-enough pond in it to\r\nsupply the minks with sufficient food. Under the present condition of\r\nthe fur market, each female will average a profit of forty dollars a\r\nyear. A farm stocked for the first time during the winter with five\r\nhundred female minks should bring its owner the following winter\r\napproximately twenty thousand dollars. This is figured at three\r\ndollars a fur; but within three years the mink fur in Louisiana should\r\nbe selling for what the mink fur in the North sold last season. With\r\nthis increase in the price of fur, a farm stocked with the same number\r\nshould bring forty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Fur During the Summer Is Very Poor, and Not So\r\nDark as It Is During the Winter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Excited Mink Trying to Climb.]\r\n\r\nMinks require little room, and thousands can be raised each year on a\r\nfarm of ten acres. The larger the farm, however, the better chances\r\nthey will have to procure food for themselves, as birds will enter a\r\nlarge farm more freely than a small one.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, in building a mink farm the first and most important\r\nrequirement is a good location. A small island consisting of low land\r\ncovered with trees and grasses, with the opposite shore at least\r\nthree-quarters of a mile distant, would make an excellent farm,\r\nprovided the surrounding water supplies an abundance of small fishes.\r\nSuch an island would, of course, preclude the necessity of using\r\nmaterial for holding the minks in captivity. If a suitable island\r\ncannot be found, a good farm can be made with five or more acres of\r\nlow swampy land having a natural growth of trees, grasses and\r\nunderbrush, such as can be found in Southern Louisiana. But the piece\r\nof land selected for a farm must inclose a large pond, or several\r\nsmall ponds, containing a good quantity of small fishes, especially\r\ncrayfish. The trees and grasses will attract birds, which, in addition\r\nto fish and rabbits, form a large part of food for the minks.\r\n\r\nFeeding minks is pretty costly, and is hardly to be considered by one\r\nentering the business of breeding them for their fur.\r\n\r\nThe walls surrounding a mink farm can be made either with bricks or\r\nwith sheets of corrugated, galvanized iron. The latter material makes\r\nan excellent wall, and costs less than a brick wall. It should be used\r\nin sheets measuring twelve feet in length by about twenty-six inches\r\nin width. These sheets should be used in an upright position, and at\r\nleast five feet should be underground and seven feet aboveground. They\r\nshould be allowed to lap two inches, and the dirt should be firmly\r\npacked against them. Two rows of wooden strips nailed on the outside\r\nof the wall, one about two feet above the ground, and the other along\r\nthe top edge of the sheets, will greatly strengthen the wall and also\r\nprevent the wind from shaking it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Young Female Mink Walking Along the Walls of a\r\nSmall Farm.]\r\n\r\nThe following photograph shows a small pentagonal farm, the walls of\r\nwhich are made with sheets of corrugated, galvanized iron. Each side\r\nmeasures sixteen feet in length, extending four feet underground and\r\nfour feet aboveground. Wire netting is used to cover the farm, not to\r\nprevent the minks from jumping over, although the walls are too low,\r\nbut to prevent chickens, cats and buzzards from entering and eating\r\nthe food put in for the minks. A wooden shed also covers a part of the\r\nsmall farm and serves to keep out some of the rain and heat, there\r\nbeing no shrubs or trees therein. There are two small troughs in the\r\nground for holding water, and in the center of the farm there is a\r\nplace for the minks to live during the day, which consists of boards\r\nlaid five inches above the surface of the ground with about fourteen\r\ninches of dirt on top. Under these boards it is dark during the day\r\nand always damp and cool. There are also several barrels in this farm\r\nfilled with corn shucks and hay for the minks to enter during cold\r\nweather. The minks in this little farm are fed with the spleen of\r\ncattle, different meats, crayfish and other small fishes. The cost of\r\nthis farm, or pen, which has been used for experimental purposes only,\r\namounts to approximately forty-two dollars. It is large enough to\r\nraise two hundred minks if they are properly fed and cared for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Small Mink Farm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Part of Interior of Small Farm, Showing Boards With\r\nDirt on Top for the Minks to Live Under During the Day.]\r\n\r\nSometimes an island can be used for a farm even when it has opposite\r\nshores or islands within two hundred feet or less, provided the water\r\nsurrounding it has an average depth of from four to six feet. In such\r\na case, the walls inclosing the island should be built in the water at\r\na distance of fifty or one hundred feet from its shores. Sheets of\r\nmetal should be used, as previously described, by placing them upright\r\nin the water and nailing them together with strips running along the\r\noutside. It is not essential that the lower wall should be in the\r\nground or even touching it; posts can be driven in the ground to\r\nstrengthen the wall, or to support it entirely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Mink Farm Made Out of an Island. The Water\r\nSurrounding Has a Uniform Depth of Five Feet.]\r\n\r\nIn a small farm where minks are in close captivity and have to be fed,\r\nthe old ones used for the purpose of stocking it will at first do\r\nconsiderable digging near the walls. They will dig into loose earth to\r\na depth ranging from a few inches to three feet in their attempts to\r\nliberate themselves. But they will cease to dig after they have been\r\nin captivity for about four months. Those born in a farm will not dig\r\nor try to get out. They will climb, however, to a height of fifteen\r\nfeet on reclining trees or on bushes, and for this reason all trees,\r\nbushes and pieces of lumber should be removed from the inside of the\r\nwalls before any minks are turned loose in a farm. They will\r\nordinarily jump to a height of four feet. They can climb wooden walls\r\nas swiftly as a cat, or any wall made of soft material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Disturbed in Her Sleep. Notice the Bushy Tail.]\r\n\r\nThe following sketch shows the very best mink farm that can be made.\r\nIt requires a rectangular piece of land of five or ten acres, running\r\nalong and separated by a large bayou in the swamps of Louisiana.\r\nCovering this land there should be the necessary trees, shrubbery and\r\ngrasses. The walls are built along the bayou about one hundred feet\r\nfrom the middle, and extend underground to a depth of six feet. The\r\nwalls at the ends of the farm where they cross the bayou should be\r\nvery carefully constructed. At these places where the walls cross the\r\nbayou should have a depth of at least twelve feet or more, so that the\r\nwalls can be made to extend nine feet below the water surface for\r\none-third the width of the stream and still have sufficient openings\r\nbelow the walls to permit the water to flow through freely. For\r\nexample, if the bayou is fifty feet wide, fifteen feet of the wall\r\ncrossing it can be elevated so that there will be a large-enough\r\nopening below for the water to flow. The remaining portion of the wall\r\n(that lying near the shore) should be driven in the ground for about\r\none foot, as minks will not dig under water. A farm of five acres,\r\nsimilar to the one just described, would cost, completed,\r\napproximately eight hundred dollars. The minks in such a farm, owing\r\nto the continuous change of water in the bayou, would always have an\r\nabundance of food. The banks of the bayou would afford a natural\r\nbreeding-place, as minks usually burrow in the banks of small streams\r\nor along canals and have their young near the water. If the water in\r\nthe bayou falls, wire netting could be used over the opening at the\r\nends below the walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Mink Farm Inclosing Portion of a Bayou, Allowing the\r\nWater to Flow Through.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Angry Mink.]\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Minks eat birds, small mammals and eggs. The principal food of\r\n     minks comes from water, fish, frogs, crayfish.\"--_International\r\n     Encyclopædia._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe minks I have been experimenting with have persistently refused to\r\neat frogs. I penned one up separately and attempted to feed her on\r\nfrogs only, and I believe she would have starved rather than eat\r\nfrogs.\r\n\r\nMinks can be raised in any kind of pen or cage, and water is not\r\nessential to their happiness. They are easily tamed and like to be\r\npetted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHabits of the Mink in Louisiana\r\n\r\n\r\nMinks in Louisiana have two litters a season, the\r\nnumber of young in each brood varying from four to eight. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, but very rarely, there will be only two in a brood, and\r\nalmost as infrequently, on the other hand, there will be three litters\r\na season instead of two. Captive animals breed more profusely than the\r\nwild, and will occasionally have three litters where they are in close\r\ncaptivity. They begin to breed when they are about one year old, and\r\nin captivity will raise an average of fourteen a year. Normally, they\r\nlive to be about nine years old, but they will live longer in\r\ncaptivity where they are well treated and given all the water and the\r\ndifferent foods required by them.\r\n\r\nLike all other industries, the business of breeding minks for their\r\nfur necessitates an outlay of capital. A farm cannot be built without\r\nmoney, and the cost of one sufficiently large to breed minks\r\nprofitably ranges from five hundred to a thousand dollars. Of course,\r\na farm can be made any size and costing any amount of money; but large\r\nfarms are not necessary, and it is much better to have several small\r\nfarms of six or ten acres than one very large one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Female Mink Resting With Eyes Open.]\r\n\r\nAfter a farm is completed it has to be stocked, and the task is no\r\neasy or inexpensive one. Trappers will have to be employed to trap\r\nminks with No. 1 steel traps, as these small traps do not injure them\r\nvery much unless they are permitted to remain caught too long. Those\r\nthat have badly-broken bones should not be bought, as suffering will\r\ncause them to eat their leg off, in which case they will always die.\r\n\r\nThe author intends to organize a company styled the \"Louisiana Mink\r\nCompany,\" the objects and purposes of which shall be to build mink\r\nfarms and to breed minks in this State for their fur.\r\n\r\nNo matter what capital is involved, or expense incurred, in entering\r\ninto the business of breeding minks for their fur, the returns will be\r\nso big that this will appear small in comparison. And those who are so\r\nfortunate as to start in the industry now will, when minks will have\r\nbecome so rare that trapping will be unprofitable, and the demand so\r\ngreat that the prices for mink fur will soar higher and higher--those\r\npersons, I say, of foresight, who had the good fortune to start in the\r\nbusiness early, will reap each year the steady advances in the price\r\nof mink fur, and be able, in a word, to command the fur market of both\r\nEurope and America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes\r\n\r\nAll obvious typographical corrections were made.
