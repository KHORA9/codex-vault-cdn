Entered\r\n as second-class matter Sept. 8, 1905, at the Postoffice at Nashville,\r\n           Tenn., under the Act of Congress of March 8, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Major John W. Thomas\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as the forms are closing for the March edition of TROTWOOD’S\r\nMONTHLY comes news of the death of Major John Wilson Thomas, who was\r\nborn in Nashville, Tennessee, on August 24, 1830, and died in Nashville,\r\nFebruary 12, 1906.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 28 he entered railroad work, and was in harness\r\ncontinually up to the time of his death, being at that time President of\r\nthe Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railroad.\r\n\r\nWe regret that limited time and space will not permit us to give a\r\ndetailed account of the many incidents that made up the life of this\r\ngreat and good man, but we are safe in saying that a more popular man\r\nnever lived in the South—or elsewhere. The “Old Man,” as he was\r\naffectionately called by his employes, was ever ready to listen with a\r\nsympathetic ear to the story of the unfortunate, and encouragement was\r\nalways freely given. Every employe under him was supposed to do his very\r\nbest. He demanded everything there was in a man, and got it; not from\r\nfear, but through the love they had for him. His word was law and his\r\ndecision final, for right and justice always prevailed. No man was ever\r\nloved and respected more by his employes than Major Thomas, and his\r\nrecord as a railroad man was seldom if ever equaled. He did not grow up\r\nwith the road, but it grew up with him, and he made it what it is\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nSomebody will take his place as president of the N., C. & St. L. road,\r\nbut there is no one to take his place in the hearts of his friends. He\r\nwas a great and good man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE MOURNING TENNESSEE\r\n\r\n                        BY WILL ALLEN DROMGOOLK.\r\n\r\n  [The little engine, “Tennessee,” that always drew the private car of\r\n      President Thomas stands draped in mourning for thirty days.]\r\n\r\n            Do you know, as you stand there waiting,\r\n              Rigged out in your trappings of woe,\r\n            That someone lies dead, up yonder?\r\n              Do you know, Tennessee, do you know?\r\n\r\n            Do you know why that grim, black banner\r\n              Trails over each shining place?\r\n            Do you understand, I wonder,\r\n              The stain on your fireman’s face?\r\n\r\n            Do you know, as you stand there waiting,\r\n              You dear little thing, Tennessee,\r\n            That the cab and the coach are empty?\r\n              Lonesome as they can be?\r\n\r\n            That the face that shone out from the window,\r\n              Flashing your welcome back,\r\n            No more will brighten the darkness\r\n              Of the desolate, lonely track.\r\n\r\n            Does it hurt you to know that his footstep\r\n              Will linger no more at the door?\r\n            Does it hurt you to know that his presence\r\n              Will gladden the way no more.\r\n\r\n            He is dead!

Winston & Co., publishers, of\r\nPhiladelphia, Pa., we are permitted to give to our readers this treat,\r\nbeing one of the chapters from the forthcoming novel of John Trotwood\r\nMoore, entitled “The Bishop of Cottontown,” now in the Winston press,\r\nand which will be issued by them early in March. This novel has been\r\npronounced truly great by many publishers’ readers. It deals with child\r\nlabor in the Southern cotton mills and the Bishop is the kindly old\r\npreacher and ex-trainer of ante-bellum thoroughbreds, who is the hero of\r\nthe book.—E. E. Sweetland, Business Manager.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was ten o’clock and the Bishop was on his way to church. He was\r\ndriving the old roan of the night before. A parody on a horse, to one\r\nwho did not look closely, but to one who knows and looks beyond the mere\r\nexternal form for that hidden something in both man and horse which\r\nbespeaks strength and reserve force, there was seen through the\r\nblindness and the ugliness and the sleepy, ambling, shuffling gait a\r\nclean-cut form, with deep chest and closely ribbed; with well drawn\r\nflanks, a fine, flat steel-turned bone, and a powerful muscle, above\r\nhock and forearms, that clung to the leg as the Bishop said, “like bees\r\naswarmin’.”\r\n\r\nAt his little cottage gate stood Bud Billings, the best slubber in the\r\ncotton mill. Bud never talked to any one except the Bishop, and his\r\nwife, who was the worst Xantippe in Cottontown, declared she had lived\r\nwith him six months straight and never heard him come nearer speaking\r\nthan a grunt. It was also a saying of Richard Travis that Bud had been\r\nknown to break all records for silence by drawing a year’s wages at the\r\nmill, never missing a minute and never speaking a word.\r\n\r\nNor had he ever looked any one full in the eye in his life.\r\n\r\nAs the Bishop drove shamblingly along down the road, deeply preoccupied\r\nin his forthcoming sermon, there came from out of a hole, situated\r\nsomewhere between the grizzled fringe of hair that marked Bud’s whiskers\r\nand the grizzled fringe above that marked his eye-brows, a piping,\r\napologetic voice that sounded like the first few rasps of an old rusty\r\nsaw; but to the occupant of the buggy it meant, with a drawl:\r\n\r\n“Howdy do, Bishop?”\r\n\r\nA blind horse is quick to observe and take fright at anything uncanny.\r\nHe is the natural ghost-finder of the highways, and that voice was too\r\nmuch for the old roan. To him it sounded like something that had been\r\nresurrected. It was a ghost-voice, arising after many years. He shied,\r\nsprang forward, half wheeled and nearly upset the buggy, until brought\r\nup with a jerk by the powerful arms of his driver. The shaft-band had\r\nbroken and the buggy had run upon the horse’s rump, and the shafts stuck\r\nup almost at right angles over his back. The roan stood trembling with\r\nthe half turned, inquisitive muzzle of the sightless horse—a paralysis\r\nof fear all over his face. But when Bud came forward and touched his\r\nface and stroked it, the fear vanished, and the old roan bobbed his tail\r\nup and down and wiggled his head reassuringly and apologetically.\r\n\r\n“Wal, I declar, Bishop,” grinned Bud, “kin yo’ critter fetch a caper?”\r\n\r\nThe Bishop got leisurely out of his buggy, pulled down the shafts and\r\ntied up the girth before he spoke. Then he gave a puckering hitch to his\r\nunderlip and deposited in the sand, with a puddling plunk, the half cup\r\nof tobacco juice that had closed his mouth.\r\n\r\nHe stepped back and said very sternly:\r\n\r\n“Whoa, Ben Butler!”\r\n\r\n“Why, he’un’s sleep a’ready,” grinned Bud.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop glanced at the bowed head, cocked hind foot and listless\r\ntail: “Sof’nin’ of the brain, Bud,” smiled the Bishop; “they say when\r\nold folks begin to take it they jus’ go to sleep while settin’ up\r\ntalkin’. Now, a horse, Bud,” he said, striking an attitude for a\r\ndiscussion on his favorite topic, “a horse is like a man—he must have\r\nsome meanness or he c’u’dn’t live, an’ some goodness or nobody else\r\nc’u’d live. But git in, Bud, and let’s go along to meetin’—’pears like\r\nit’s gettin’ late.”\r\n\r\nThis was what Bud had been listening for. This was the treat of the\r\nweek for him—to ride to meetin’ with the Bishop. Bud, a\r\nslubber-slave—henpecked at home, browbeaten and cowed at the mill,\r\ntimid, scared, “an’ powerful slow-mouthed,” as his spouse termed it,\r\nworshipped the old Bishop and had no greater pleasure in life, after\r\nhis hard week’s work, than “to ride to meetin’ with the old man an’\r\njes’ hear him narrate.”\r\n\r\nThe Bishop’s great, sympathetic soul went out to the poor fellow, and\r\nthough he had rather spend the next two miles of Ben Butler’s slow\r\njourney to church in thinking over his sermon, he never failed, as he\r\ntermed it, “to pick up charity even on the road-side,” and it was pretty\r\nto see how the old man would turn loose his crude histrionic talent to\r\namuse the slubber. He knew, too, that Bud was foolish about horses, and\r\nthat Ben Butler was his model!\r\n\r\nThey got into the old buggy, and Ben Butler began to draw it slowly\r\nalong the sandy road to the little church, two miles away up the\r\nmountain side.\r\n\r\nBud was now in the seventh heaven. He was riding behind Ben Butler, the\r\ngreatest horse in the world, and talking to the Bishop, the only person\r\nwho ever heard the sound of his voice, save in deprecatory and scary\r\ngrunts.\r\n\r\nIt was touching to see how the old man humored the simple and\r\nimposed-upon creature at his side. It was beautiful to see how,\r\nforgetting himself and his sermon, he prepared to entertain, in his\r\nquaint way, this slave to the slubbing machine.\r\n\r\nBud looked fondly at the Bishop—then admiringly at Ben Butler. He drew a\r\nlong breath of pure air, and sitting on the edge of the seat, prepared\r\nto jump if necessary, for Bud was mortally afraid of being in a runaway,\r\nand his scared eyes seemed to be looking for the soft places in the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n“Bishop,” he drawled after a while, “huc-cum you name sech a\r\nhoss”—pointing to the old roan—“sech a grand hoss, for sech a man—sech a\r\nman as he was,” he added humbly.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever notice Ben Butler’s eyes, Bud?” asked the old man\r\nknowingly.\r\n\r\n“Blind,” said Bud sadly, shaking his head—“too bad—too bad—great—great\r\nhoss!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but the leds, Bud—that hoss, Ben Butler there, holds a world’s\r\nrecord—he’s the only cock-eyed hoss in the world.”\r\n\r\n“You don’t say so—that critter!—cock-eyed?” Bud laughed and slapped\r\nhis leg gleefully. “Didn’t I always tell you so? World’s\r\nrecord—great—great!”\r\n\r\nThen it broke gradually through on Bud’s dull mind.\r\n\r\nHe slapped his leg again. “An’ him—his namesake—he was cock-eyed, too—I\r\nseed him onct at New ’Leens.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you never trust a cock-eyed man, Bud. He’ll flicker on you in the\r\nhome-stretch. I’ve tried it an’ it never fails. Love him, but don’t\r\ntrust him. The world is full of folks we oughter love, but not trust.”\r\n\r\n“No—I never will,” said Bud as thoughtfully as he knew how to be—“nor a\r\ncock-eyed ’oman neither. My wife’s cock-eyed,” he added.\r\n\r\nHe was silent a moment. Then he showed the old man a scar on his\r\nforehead: “She done that last month—busted a plate on my head.”\r\n\r\n“That’s bad,” said the Bishop consolingly—“but you ortenter aggravate\r\nher, Bud.”\r\n\r\n“That’s so—I ortenter—least-wise, not whilst there’s any crockery in the\r\nhouse,” said Bud sadly.\r\n\r\n“There’s another thing about this hoss,” went on the Bishop—“he’s always\r\nspoony on mules. He ain’t happy if he can’t hang over the front gate\r\nspoonin’ with every stray mule that comes along. There’s old long-eared\r\nLize that he’s dead stuck on—if he c’u’d write he’d be composin’ a\r\nsonnet to her ears, like poets do to their lady love’s—callin’ them Star\r\nPointers of a Greater Hope, I reck’n, an’ all that. Why, he’d ruther\r\nhold hands by moonlight with some old Maria mule than to set up by\r\nlamplight with a thoroughbred filly.”\r\n\r\n“Great—great!” said Bud slapping his leg—“didn’t I tell you so?”\r\n\r\n“So I named him Ben Butler when he was born. That was right after the\r\nwar, an’ I hated old Ben so an’ loved hosses so, I thought ef I’d name\r\nmy colt for old Ben maybe I’d learn to love him, in time.”\r\n\r\nBud shook his head. “That’s ag’in nature, Bishop.”\r\n\r\n“But I have, Bud—sho’ as you are born I love old Ben Butler.” He lowered\r\nhis voice to an earnest whisper: “I ain’t never told you what he done\r\nfor po’ Cap’n Tom.”\r\n\r\n“Never heurd o’ Cap’n Tom.”\r\n\r\nThe Bishop looked hurt. “Never mind, Bud, you wouldn’t understand. But\r\nmaybe you will ketch this. Listen now.”\r\n\r\nBud listened intently with his head on one side.\r\n\r\n“I ain’t never hated a man in my life but what God has let me live long\r\nenough to find out I was in the wrong—dead wrong. There are Jews and\r\nYankees. I useter hate ’em worse’n sin—but now what do you reckon?”\r\n\r\n“One on ’em busted a plate on yo’ head?” asked Bud.\r\n\r\n“Jesus Christ was a Jew, an’ Cap’n Tom jined the Yankees.”\r\n\r\n“Bud,” he said cheerily after a pause, “did I ever tell you the story of\r\nthis here Ben Butler here?”\r\n\r\nBud’s eyes grew bright and he slapped his leg again.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the old man, brightening up into one of his funny moods,\r\n“you know my first wife was named Kathleen—Kathleen Galloway when she\r\nwas a gal, an’ she was the pretties’ gal in the settlement an’ could go\r\nall the gaits both saddle an’ harness. She was han’som’ as a\r\nthree-year-old an’ cu’d out-dance, out-ride, out-sing an’ out-flirt any\r\nother gal that ever come down the pike. When she got her Sunday harness\r\non an’ began to move, she made all the other gals look like they were\r\nnailed to the road-side. It’s true, she needed a little weight in front\r\nto balance her, an’ she had a lot of ginger in her make-up, but she was\r\nstraight and sound, didn’t wear anything but the harness an’ never\r\nteched herself anywhere nor cross-fired nor hit her knees.”\r\n\r\n“Good—great!” said Bud, slapping his leg.\r\n\r\n“Oh, she was beautiful, Bud, with that silky hair that ’ud make a\r\nthoroughbred filly’s look coarse as sheep’s wool, an’ two\r\nmischief-lovin’ eyes an’ a heart that was all gold. Bud—Bud”—and there\r\nwas a huskiness in the old man’s voice—“I know I can tell you because it\r\nwill never come back to me ag’in, but I love that Kathleen now as I did\r\nthen. A man may marry many times, but he can never love but once.\r\nSometimes it’s his fust wife, sometimes his secon’, an’ often it’s the\r\nsweetheart he never got—but he loved only one of ’em the right way, an’\r\nup yander, in some other star, where spirits that are alike meet in one\r\neternal wedlock, they’ll be one there forever.\r\n\r\n“Her daddy, ole man Galloway, had a thoroughbred filly that he named\r\nKathleena for his daughter, an’ she c’u’d do anything that the gal left\r\nout. An’ one day when she took the bit in her teeth an’ run a quarter in\r\ntwenty-five seconds, she sot ’em all wild an’ lots of fellers tried to\r\nbuy the filly an’ get the old man to throw in the gal for her keep an’\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n“I was one of ’em. I was clerkin’ for the old man an’ boardin’ in the\r\nhouse, an’ whenever a young feller begins to board in a house where\r\nthere is a thoroughbred gal, the nex’ thing he knows he’ll be—”\r\n\r\n“Buckled in the traces,” cried Bud slapping his leg gleefully, at this,\r\nhis first product of brilliancy.\r\n\r\nThe old man smiled: “’Pon my word, Bud, you’re gittin’ so smart. I don’t\r\nknow what I’ll be doin’ with you—so ’riginal an’ smart. Why, you’ll quit\r\nkeepin’ an old man’s company—like me. I won’t be able to entertain you\r\nat all. But, as I was sayin’ the next thing he knows, he’ll be one of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\n“So me an’ Kathleen, we soon got spoony an’ wanted to marry. Lots of ’em\r\nwanted to marry her, but I drawed the pole an’ was the only one she’d\r\ntake as a runnin’ mate. So I went after the old man this a way: I told\r\nhim I’d buy the filly if he’d give me Kathleen. I never will forgit what\r\nhe said: ‘They ain’t narry one of ’em for sale, swap or hire, an’ I wish\r\nyou young fellers ’ud tend to yo’ own business an’ let my fillies alone.\r\nI’m gwinter bus’ the wurl’s record wid ’em both—Kathleena the runnin’\r\nrecord an Kathleen the gal record, so be damn to you an’ don’t pester me\r\nno mo’.’”\r\n\r\n“Did he say damn?” asked Bud aghast—that such a word should ever come\r\nfrom the Bishop.\r\n\r\n“He sho’ did, Bud. I wouldn’t lie about the old man, now that he’s dead.\r\nIt ain’t right to lie about dead people—even to make ’em say nice an’\r\nproper things they never thought of whilst alive. If we’d stop lyin’\r\nabout the ungodly dead an’ tell the truth about ’em, maybe the livin’\r\n’u’d stop tryin’ to foller after ’em in that respect. As it is, every\r\none of ’em knows that no matter how wicked he lives there’ll be a lot o’\r\nnice lies told over him after he’s gone, an’ a monument erected, maybe,\r\nto tell how good he was. An’ there’s another lot of half pious folks in\r\nthe wurl it ’u’d help—kind o’ sissy pious folks—that jus’ do manage to\r\nmiss all the fun in this world an’ jus’ are mean enough to ketch hell in\r\nthe nex’. Get religion, but don’t get the sissy kind. So I am for\r\ntellin’ it about old man Galloway jus’ as he was.\r\n\r\n“You orter heard him swear. Bud—it was part of his religion. An’\r\nwherever he is to-day in that other world, he is at it yet, for in that\r\nother life, Bud, we’re just ourselves on a bigger scale than we are in\r\nthis. He used to cuss the clerks around the store jus’ from habit, an’\r\nwhen I went to work for him he said:\r\n\r\n“‘Young man, maybe I’ll cuss you out some mornin’, but don’t pay no\r\n’tention to it—it’s just a habit I’ve got into, an’ the boys all\r\nunderstand it.’\r\n\r\n“‘Glad you told me,’ I said, lookin’ him square in the eye—‘one\r\nconfidence deserves another. I’ve got a nasty habit of my own, but I\r\nhope you won’t pay no ’tention to it, for it’s a habit, an’ I can’t help\r\nit. I don’t mean nothin’ by it, an’ the boys all understand it, but when\r\na man cusses me I allers knock him down—do it befo’ I think’—I\r\nsaid—‘jes’ a habit I’ve got.’\r\n\r\n“Well, he never cussed me all the time I was there. My stock went up\r\nwith the old man an’ my chances was good to get the gal, if I hadn’t\r\nmade a fool hoss-trade; for with old man Galloway a good hoss-trade\r\ncovered all the multitude of sins in a man that charity now does in\r\nreligion. In them days a man might have all the learnin’ and virtues an’\r\ngraces, but if he c’u’dn’t trade hosses he was tinklin’ brass an’\r\nsoundin’ cymbal in that community.\r\n\r\n“The man that throwed the silk into me was Jud Carpenter—the same fellow\r\nthat’s now the whipper-in for these mills. Now, don’t be scared,” said\r\nthe old man soothingly as Bud’s scary eyes looked about him and he\r\nclutched the buggy as if he would jump out—“he’ll not pester you\r\nnow—he’s kept away from me ever since. He swapped me a black hoss with a\r\nstar an’ snip that looked like the genuine thing, but was about the\r\nneatest turned gold-brick that was ever put on an unsuspectin’\r\nmillionaire.\r\n\r\n“Well, in the trade he simply robbed me of a fine mare I had, that cost\r\nme one-an’-a-quarter. Kathleen an’ me was already engaged, but when old\r\nman Galloway heard of it, he told me the jig was up an’ no such\r\ndouble-barrel idiot as I was sh’u’d ever leave any of my colts in the\r\nGalloway paddock—that when he looked over his gran’-chillun’s pedigree\r\nhe didn’t wanter see all of ’em crossin’ back to the same damned fool!\r\nOh, he was nasty. He said that my colts was dead sho’ to be luffers with\r\nwheels in their heads, an’ when pinched they’d quit, an’ when collared\r\nthey’d lay down. That there was a yaller streak in me that was already\r\npilin’ up coupons on the future for tears and heartaches an’ maybe a\r\ngallows or two, an’ a lot of uncomplimentary talk of that kind.\r\n\r\n“Well, Kathleen cried, an’ I wept, an’ I’ll never forgit the night she\r\ngave me a little good-bye kiss out under the big oak tree an’ told me\r\nwe’d hafter part.\r\n\r\n“The old man maybe sized me up all right as bein’ a fool, but he missed\r\nit on my bein’ a quitter. I had no notion of being fired an’ blistered\r\nan’ turned out to grass that early in the game. I wrote her a poem every\r\nother day, an’ lied between heats, till the po’ gal was nearly crazy,\r\nan’ when I finally got it into her head that if it was a busted blood\r\nvessel with the old man, it was a busted heart with me, she cried a\r\nlittle mo’ an’ consented to run off with me an’ take the chances of the\r\nvillage doctor cuppin’ the old man at the right time.\r\n\r\n“The old lady was on my side and helped things along. I had everything\r\nfixed even to the moon, which was shinin’ jes’ bright enough to carry us\r\nto the Justice’s without a lantern, some three miles away, an’ into the\r\nnex’ county.\r\n\r\n“I’ll never fergit how the night looked as I rode over after her, how\r\nthe wildflowers smelt, an’ the fresh dew on the leaves. I remember that\r\nI even heard a mockin’-bird wake up about midnight as I tied my hoss to\r\na lim’ in the orchard nearby, an’ slipped aroun’ to meet Kathleen at the\r\nbars behin’ the house. It was a half mile to the house an’ I was\r\nslippin’ through the sugar-maple trees along the path we’d both walked\r\nso often befo’, when I saw what I thought was Kathleen comin’ towards\r\nme. I ran to meet her. It wa’n’t Kathleen, but her mother—an’ she told\r\nme to git in a hurry, that the old man knew all, had locked Kathleen up\r\nin the kitchen, turned the brindle dog loose in the yard, an’ was hidin’\r\nin the woods nigh the barn, with his gun loaded with bird-shot, an’ that\r\nif I went any further the chances were I’d not sit down agin for a year.\r\nShe had slipped around through the woods just to warn me.\r\n\r\n“Of course I wanted to fight an’ take her anyway—kill the dog an’ the\r\nold man, storm the kitchen an’ run off with Kathleen in my arms as they\r\ndo in novels. But the old lady said she didn’t want the dog hurt—it\r\nbeing a valuable coon-dog—and that I was to go away out of the county\r\nan’ wait for a better time.\r\n\r\n“It mighty nigh broke me up, but I decided the old lady was right an’\r\nI’d go away. But ’long towards the shank of the night, after I had put\r\nup my hoss, the moon was still shinin’, an’ I c’u’dn’t sleep for\r\nthinkin’ of Kathleen. I stole afoot over to her house just to look at\r\nher window. The house was all quiet an’ even the brindle dog was asleep.\r\nI threw kisses at her bed-room window, but even then I c’u’dn’t go away,\r\nso I slipped around to the barn and laid down in the hay to think over\r\nmy hard luck. My heart ached an’ burned an’ I was nigh dead with love.\r\n\r\n“I wondered if I’d ever get her, if they’d wean her from me, an’ give\r\nher to the rich little feller whose fine farm j’ined the old man’s an’\r\nwho the old man was wuckin’ fur—whether the two wouldn’t over-persuade\r\nher whilst I was gone. For I’d made up my mind I’d go befo’\r\ndaylight—that there wasn’t anything else for me to do.\r\n\r\n“I was layin’ in the hay, an’ boylike, the tears was rollin’ down. If I\r\nc’u’d only kiss her han’ befo’ I left—if I c’u’d only see her face at\r\nthe winder!\r\n\r\n“I must have sobbed out loud, for jus’ then I heard a gentle,\r\nsympathetic whinny an’ a cold, inquisitive little muzzle was thrust into\r\nmy face, as I lay on my back with my heart nearly busted. It was\r\nKathleena, an’ I rubbed my hot face against her cool cheek—for it seemed\r\nso human of her to come an’ try to console me, an’ I put my arms around\r\nher neck an’ kissed her silky mane an’ imagined it was Kathleen’s hair.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I was heart-broke an’ silly.\r\n\r\n“Then all at onct a thought came to me, an’ I slipped the bridle an’\r\nsaddle on her an’ led her out at the back door, an’ I scratched this on\r\na slip of paper an’ stuck it on the barn do’:\r\n\r\n                         “‘To old man Galloway:\r\n\r\n  “‘You wouldn’t let me ’lope with yo’ dorter, so I’ve ’loped with yo’\r\n  filly, an’ you’ll never see hair nor hide of her till you send me\r\n  word to come back to this house an’ fetch a preacher.’\r\n\r\n  (Signed) “‘HILLIARD WATTS.’”\r\n\r\nThe old man smiled, and Bud slapped his leg gleefully.\r\n\r\n“Great—great! Oh, my, but who’d a thought of it?” he grunted.\r\n\r\n“They say it ’u’d done you good to have been there the nex’ mornin’ an’\r\nheurd the cussin’ recurd busted—but me an’ the filly was forty miles\r\naway. He got out a warrant for me for hoss-stealin’, but the sheriff was\r\nfur me, an’ though he hunted high an’ low he never could find me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it went on for a month, an’ I got the old man’s note, sent by the\r\nsheriff:\r\n\r\n                 “‘To Hilliard Watts, Wher-Ever Found.\r\n\r\n  “‘Come on home an’ fetch yo’ preacher. Can’t afford to lose the\r\n  filly, an’ the gal has been off her feed ever since you left.\r\n\r\n                                                    “‘JOBE GALLOWAY.’”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bud, I’ll never forgit that homecomin’ when she met me at the gate\r\nan’ kissed me an’ laughed a little an’ cried a heap, an’ we walked in\r\nthe little parlor an’ the preacher made us one.\r\n\r\n“Nor of that happy, happy year, when all life seemed a sweet dream now\r\nas I look back, an’ even the memory of it keeps me happy. Memory is a\r\nland that never changes in a world of changes, an’ that should show us\r\nour soul is immortal, for memory is only the reflection of our soul.”\r\n\r\nHis voice grew more tender, and low: “Toward the last of the year I seed\r\nher makin’ little things slyly an’ hidin’ ’em away in the bureau drawer,\r\nan’ one night she put away a tiny half-finished little dress with the\r\nneedle stickin’ in the hem—just as she left it—just as her beautiful\r\nhands made the last stitch they ever made on earth....\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bud, Bud, out of this blow come the sweetest thought I ever had,\r\nan’ I know from that day that this life ain’t all, that we’ll live agin\r\nas sho’ as God lives an’ is just—an’ no man can doubt that. No—no—Bud,\r\nthis life ain’t all, because it’s God’s unvarying law to finish things.\r\nThat tree there is finished, an’ them birds, they are finished, an’ that\r\nflower by the road-side an’ the mountain yonder an’ the world an’ the\r\nstars an’ the sun. An’ we’re mo’ than they be, Bud—even the tiniest\r\nsoul, like Kathleen’s little one that jes’ opened its eyes an’ smiled\r\nan’ died, when its mammy died. It had something that the trees an’ birds\r\nan’ mountains didn’t have—a soul—an’ don’t you kno’ He’ll finish all\r\nsuch lives up yonder? He’ll pay it back a thousandfold for what He cuts\r\noff here.”\r\n\r\nBud wept because the tears were running down the old man’s cheeks. He\r\nwanted to say something, but he could not speak. That queer feeling that\r\ncame over him at times and made him silent had come again.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop laughed outright as his mind went back again.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he went on reminiscently, “I’ll have to finish my tale an’ tell\r\nyou how I throwed the cold steel into Jud Carpenter when I got back. I\r\nsaw I had it to do, to work back into my daddy-in-law’s graces an’ save\r\nmy reputation.\r\n\r\n“Now, Jud had lied to me an’ swindled me terribly, when he put off that\r\nold no-count hoss on me. Of course, I might have sued him, for a lie is\r\na microbe which naturally develops into a lawyer’s fee. But while it’s a\r\nterrible braggart, it’s really cowardly an’ delicate, an’ will die of\r\nlock-jaw if you only pick its thumb.\r\n\r\n“So I breshed up that old black to split-silk fineness, an’ turned him\r\nover to Dr. Sykes, a friend of mine living in the next village. An’ I\r\nsaid to the Doctor, ‘Now remember he is yo’ hoss until Jud Carpenter\r\ncomes an’ offers you two hundred dollars for him.’\r\n\r\n“‘Will he be fool enough to do it?’ he asked, as he looked the old\r\ncounterfeit over.\r\n\r\n“‘Wait and see,’ I said.\r\n\r\n“I said nothin’, laid low an’ froze an’ it wa’n’t long befo’ Jud come\r\n’round as I ’lowed he’d do. He expected me to kick an’ howl; but as I\r\ntook it all so nice he didn’t understand it. Nine times out of ten the\r\nbest thing to do when the other feller has robbed you is to freeze. The\r\nhunter on the plain knows the value of that, an’ that he can freeze an’\r\nmake a deer walk right up to him, to find out what he is. Why, a rabbit\r\nwill do it, if you jump him quick, an’ he gets confused an’ don’t know\r\njes’ what’s up; an’ so Jud come as I thort he’d do. He couldn’t stan’ it\r\nno longer, an’ he wanted to rub it in. He brought his crowd to enjoy the\r\nfun.\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, Mr. Watts,’ he said grinnin’, ‘how do you like a coal black\r\nstump-sucker?’\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ I said, indifferent enough—‘I’ve knowed good judges of hosses\r\nto make a hones’ mistake now an’ then, an’ sell a hoss to a customer\r\nwith the heaves thinkin’ he’s a stump-sucker. But it ’u’d turn out to be\r\nonly the heaves an’ easily cured.’\r\n\r\n“‘Is that so?’ said Jud, changing his tone.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes,’ I said, ‘an’ I’ve knowed better judges of hosses to sell a\r\nnervous hoss for a balker that had been balked only onct by a rattle\r\nhead. But in keerful hands I’ve seed him git over it,’ I said,\r\nindifferent like.\r\n\r\n“‘Indeed?’ said Jud.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, Jud,’ said I, ‘I’ve knowed real hones’ hoss traders to make bad\r\nbreaks of that kind, now and then—honest intentions an’ all that, but\r\nbad judgment,’—sez I—‘an’ I’ll cut it short by sayin’ that I’ll just\r\ngive you two an’ a half if you’ll match that no-count wind-broken black\r\nas you thort that you swapped me.’\r\n\r\n“‘Do you mean it?’ said Jud, solemn-like.\r\n\r\n“‘I’ll make a bond to that effect,’ I said solemnly.\r\n\r\n“Jud went off thoughtful. In a week or so he come back. He hung aroun’ a\r\nwhile an’ said:\r\n\r\n“‘I was up in the country the other day, an’ do you kno’ I saw a dead\r\nmatch for yo’ black? Only a little slicker an’ better lookin’—same star\r\nan’ white hind foot. As nigh like him as one black-eyed pea looks like\r\nanother.’\r\n\r\n“‘Jud,’ I said, ‘I never did see two hosses look exactly alike. You’re\r\nhonestly mistaken.’\r\n\r\n“‘They ain’t a hair’s difference,’ he said. ‘He’s a little slicker than\r\nyours—that’s all—better groomed than the one in yo’ barn.’\r\n\r\n“‘I reckon he is,’ said I, for I knew very well there wa’n’t none in my\r\nbarn. ‘That’s strange,’ I went on, ‘but you kno’ what I said.’\r\n\r\n“‘Do you still hold to that offer?’ he axed.\r\n\r\n“‘I’ll make bond with my daddy-in-law on it,’ I said.\r\n\r\n“‘Nuff said,’ an’ Jud was gone. The next day he came back leading the\r\nblack, slicker an’ hence no-counter than ever, if possible.\r\n\r\n“‘Look at him,’ he said, proudly—‘a dead match for yourn. Jes’ han’ me\r\nthat two an’ a half an’ take him. You now have a team worth a thousan’.’\r\n\r\n“I looked the hoss over plum’ surprised like.\r\n\r\n“‘Why, Jud,’ I said as softly as I cu’d, for I was nigh to bustin’, an’\r\nI had a lot of friends come to see the sho’, an’ they standin’ ’round\r\nstickin’ their old hats in their mouths to keep from explodin’—‘Why,\r\nJud, my dear friend,’ I said, ‘ain’t you kind o’ mistaken about this? I\r\nsaid a match for the black, an’ it peers to me like you’ve gone an’\r\nbought the black hisse’f an’ is tryin’ to put him off on me. No—no—my\r\nkind frien’, you’ll not fin’ anything no-count enuff to be his match on\r\nthis terrestrial ball.’\r\n\r\n“By this time you c’u’d have raked Jud’s eyes off his face with a\r\nsoap-gourd.\r\n\r\n“‘What? W-h-a-t? He—why—I bought him of Dr. Sykes.’\r\n\r\n“‘Why, that’s funny,’ I said, ‘but it comes in handy all round. If you’d\r\ntold me that the other day I might have told you,’ I said—‘yes, I might\r\nhave, but I doubt it—that I’d loaned him to Dr. Sykes an’ told him\r\nwhenever you offered him two hundred cash for him to let him go. Jes’\r\nkeep him,’ sez I, ‘till you find his mate, an’ I’ll take an oath to buy\r\n’em.’”\r\n\r\nBud slapped his leg an’ yelled with delight.\r\n\r\n“Whew,” said the Bishop—“not so loud. We’re at the church.\r\n\r\n“But remember, Bud, it’s good policy allers to freeze. When you’re in\r\ndoubt—freeze!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Early Apples—A Southern Opportunity\r\n\r\n                    By R. A. WILKES, CULLEOKA, TENN.\r\n\r\n  [Note: Mr. Wilkes has made a life study of this subject and speaks\r\n  from a practical standpoint, at the request of the editor of\r\n  Trotwood’s. He has, of course, confined his paper to the hill lands\r\n  of the Middle South; but in the publicity which will be given by\r\n  this publication, it is to be hoped other sections of the South will\r\n  take advantage of this wonderful opportunity where their conditions\r\n  are favorable.—Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNature never gave to any people a fairer heritage than to the farmers of\r\nMiddle Tennessee. With a rich soil, a mild climate and an abundant\r\nrainfall, it is in truth a garden spot. Adapted to the growth of nearly\r\nevery product necessary for man’s sustenance, covered with forests,\r\nunderlaid with minerals and phosphates, midway between the cold blasts\r\nof the North and the excessive heat of the South, with cold, pure water\r\npouring from under every hill, and not a taint of malaria in the\r\natmosphere, it is the ideal farmer’s home. With all its advantages and\r\nopportunities there should be the highest degree of success and\r\nprosperity, and the owner of a Middle Tennessee farm should be the\r\nhappiest and most contented man that lives. That such is not the case in\r\nrecent years, however, is a lamentable fact.\r\n\r\nDistinctly an agricultural people, prosperity depends upon the success\r\nof the farmers, and that they are not prospering as they should is an\r\nundeniable fact. The reason for this can be found in the fact that\r\nTennessee farmers have failed to realize the results of the marvelous\r\nexpansion and upheaval of the industrial conditions that have come as\r\nthe result of building railways and the invention of labor-saving\r\nmachinery. There was a time when the owners of these rich hills and\r\nvalleys could successfully meet all competitors in the markets then\r\naccessible, and growing all their own supplies, the sale of their\r\nsurplus products kept the balance always in their favor. But with the\r\nbuilding of railways that opened up vast acres of rich territory, and\r\nthe invention of machinery that multiplied many fold the products of\r\nlabor, new centers of production were made accessible, and where\r\nTennesseans once had the markets all to themselves, new competitors came\r\nin, and with this new competition came the beginning of the end of their\r\nsupremacy in growing many standard products. Failing to realize the new\r\nstate of affairs, and unwilling to acknowledge defeat in lines they had\r\nso long excelled in, they continued their efforts to compete with these\r\nnew forces in the same lines of production, and in the unequal contest\r\nsacrificed much of their rich soil rather than be driven from their\r\nbeaten paths into lines to which they were strangers. They failed to\r\nlook facts squarely in the face and to recognize their true condition,\r\nand continued to struggle against an ever-increasing balance that in the\r\nend could only bring disaster. Take a plain business view of the\r\nsituation and consider the chances an average Middle Tennessee farmer\r\nhas in growing grain crops upon his rolling land and steep hillsides,\r\nrich though they be, when he must meet in competitive markets grain\r\ngrown in that great area known as the West, with its broad, level fields\r\nand virgin soil, where the labor of one man controlling perfect working\r\nmachinery so far surpasses the same labor upon his restricted, rough\r\narea. Labor is always the greatest cost of production, and the physical\r\ncharacter of a large part of Middle Tennessee will always prevent that\r\neconomical use of machinery that is available to the Western farmer in\r\ngrowing grain and other farm products in the handling of which machinery\r\nis effective. No people can permanently prosper who must meet in\r\ncompetitive markets the cheaper grown products of more favored sections,\r\nfor while they may have a degree of prosperity in periods of high prices\r\nlike the present, yet, when the low price periods come, as come they\r\nwill, they bring loss and often ruin to the weak competitor, for it is\r\nNature’s law that only the fittest shall survive. What then is to be the\r\nfuture of Middle Tennessee farming? This question is hard to answer, not\r\nfor a lack of answer to the question, nor for a lack of products that\r\ncan be grown with success, but rather because there are so many ways to\r\nmeet it, and so many products to select from, and such a variety of\r\nsoils to select for, that it is more a question of adaptability and\r\nlocation, and the fitness and taste of the individual than a want of\r\nways to meet the issue. There are many owners of large, level farms that\r\nmay still compete in growing all ordinary farm products, and there are\r\nmany who grow certain lines of live stock and have special markets for\r\ntheir surplus, and others whose soil and location make profitable\r\ndifferent lines; and to these classes changes in their mode of farming\r\nmay not be desirable.\r\n\r\nBut the majority of Middle Tennessee farmers have only small farms, all\r\nmore or less rolling, and many of them too rough and steep for the\r\neconomical use of machinery, and for these some change in their system\r\nis an absolute necessity.\r\n\r\nThere should be grown upon every farm two distinct lines of products—the\r\none for home consumption, for these can always be utilized for much more\r\nthan their market value, and Tennessee farmers as a rule pursue the\r\nright course in regard to their own supplies; but it is in the products\r\nthat are grown for market that the mistake has been made, and they must\r\nchange this line, and grow those that give greater returns per acre, and\r\na greater value for the labor, and quit growing those lines that bring\r\nthem in direct competition with labor that is supplemented by the use of\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nWhile much of the virgin soil has been washed from the rich hills of\r\nthis Middle Tennessee country in the endeavor to meet competition and to\r\nregain lost supremacy, yet its natural advantages are so great and the\r\nsoil is so richly stored with the elements of plant food that it\r\nrecuperates rapidly, and when under a new system, with intensive\r\nfarming, and a proper rotation and selection of crops that suit its\r\nvaried soil, and in the sale of which her farmers can stand upon the top\r\nround of the ladder, and look down upon, instead of up to, their\r\ncompetitors, as they do now, then will this grand commonwealth flourish\r\nas it never did, and its farmers will reap a harvest of prosperity\r\nunsurpassed by that of any farmers upon earth.\r\n\r\nAmong the many products that can be grown with the greatest assurance of\r\nsuccess, I know of none with results more certain and sure to give rich\r\nreturns for the labor bestowed, nor more exempt from hurtful\r\ncompetition, than that of growing the early varieties of apples upon the\r\nhills and uplands of this great basin. Ninety-five per cent of all the\r\napples grown are winter varieties, and with the utmost care in handling,\r\nand the best facilities that cold storage can give for keeping them,\r\nthere is a period of several months in the early summer when the markets\r\nare bare of apples, except a remnant of stale cold storage stock; and it\r\nis at this scarce period when prices are highest, competition least and\r\ndemand greatest, that our early apples are at their best, and supply an\r\nurgent demand for the fruit acids so necessary at this season to the\r\npeople of cold climates, to eliminate the effects of living many months\r\nupon rich, heating foods. Fruit acids are Nature’s remedy for many ills,\r\nand they are indispensable where the winters are long and cold; and in\r\nno fruit are these acids so rich and so well adapted to the needs of man\r\nas in the apple; and no apple is ready for use at so opportune a time as\r\nthese Tennessee grown early kinds. They are ready for use at a season\r\nwhen all fruits are scarce, and the market is an open one, from which\r\nTennesseans can reap a rich harvest if they will take advantage of the\r\nopportunity presented. Only a few years since fruits were a luxury of\r\nthe rich, and were not considered articles of food; but as their value\r\nbecame known under the modern rational ideas of living, they have\r\nquickly become necessities; and where obtainable, are staple foods upon\r\nthe tables of every class and condition of man. Among fruits the apple\r\nstands pre-eminent for its many uses and great healthfulness; and he is\r\na poor provider indeed who does not supply his family with this, the\r\nmost healthful and palatable dish that can go upon his table in some of\r\nits many prepared forms. The supply of apples has not increased in the\r\nsame ratio that consumption has, for it takes time to grow orchards, and\r\nolder orchards die; but the demand is an ever increasing one. These\r\nearly apples sell much higher than the winter varieties, and the\r\nterritory that can grow them is so limited that low prices need not be\r\nfeared. They cost much less to grow, for they mature before the drouths\r\nand storms of summer come, and are less subject to damage by insects and\r\nfungus disease. Middle Tennessee is the heart of the territory that can\r\ngrow choice apples that mature in that bare season, the months of June\r\nand July, and should, and I believe will, be the center of this industry\r\nin the years to come. Farther South the apple does not grow with any\r\nsuccess, and north of us they do not mature in time to compete, and\r\nthere is only a small zone east and west of us that can grow them, and\r\nwe have at least two months with practically no competition, and an\r\nunlimited demand. With the rapid and constantly improving facilities for\r\nmoving this class of freight these apples can be put into any of the\r\ncities in perfect condition, shipped in ordinary cars without the heavy\r\nice changes that most fruits must bear. With the limited area available\r\nfor their production, and the small amount now grown, it will take years\r\nto furnish an adequate supply; and the greatest danger will be the\r\nscarcity and not an overproduction, for with greater supplies the buyers\r\nwill come and the markets will be at our doors.\r\n\r\nWith more growers and greater supplies will come organization.\r\nAssociations will be formed, and instead of haphazard individual\r\nshipments, the crop will be handled in a systematic way, and be\r\ndistributed to meet the needs of the different markets. The railroads\r\nwill be ready helpers along these lines, for they realize the importance\r\nto their own interests of fostering enterprises of this kind. The L. &\r\nN. R. R. is now doing a great work in encouraging the increased growth\r\nof this class of products and give assurance of their ready co-operation\r\nat all times. This industry has passed the experimental stage, and it is\r\nan assured fact that these early apples will become a standard\r\nproduction of Middle Tennessee. It has been demonstrated by practical\r\ntests that the hills of Tennessee are especially adapted to this class\r\nof fruits, and the great success that has followed the efforts of the\r\nfew who had the foresight to anticipate the coming results, and the\r\nnerve to back their views is a sure indication of what the future will\r\ndevelop along this line.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer in this line of business was Mr. W. L. Wilkes, of Spring\r\nHill, Tennessee, and the success that he achieved has been followed by\r\nthe planting of many large orchards around him that will soon be\r\nyielding a harvest to their owners. He is too modest to say much of the\r\nprofits, but the facts are so patent that his neighbors are following\r\nhis example and a revolution is taking place in the farming of that\r\nsection. He claims that there is better profit in growing these apples\r\nnow than when he began, for the business was then a venture, and the\r\nfruit was unknown upon the market, but now growing them is an assured\r\nfact, and there is a demand for all that can be supplied. The question\r\nof varieties, too, has been settled by experience, while then it was a\r\nmatter of test.\r\n\r\nFruit well grown and handled has ever been the most profitable of all\r\ncrops; and certainly a better opportunity was never offered to any\r\npeople than this one offers to the farmers of Tennessee and other\r\nSouthern States. Knowing what has already been done and the success\r\nalready achieved, it offers an opportunity to the man who has a taste\r\nfor fruit growing and has the energy and capacity to properly care for\r\nan orchard, and the patience to wait for its fruiting, an assurance of\r\nsuccess greater than that of almost any other business. And when his\r\norchard has passed its fruitful age, and ceased to be profitable, it\r\nleaves the soil as rich as that of a virgin forest, as an inheritance\r\nfor his children.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred that good results will be had in growing apples,\r\nor any kinds of fruit without up-to-date methods of culture; for fruits\r\ndo not take kindly to careless and slovenly ways. There are many details\r\nnecessary to success, and explicit directions cannot be given in an\r\narticle of this kind that will be a sufficient guide to those who have\r\nno practical knowledge of fruit growing. There are some general rules,\r\nhowever, that apply in all cases, and that cannot be too strongly\r\nemphasized. No one should go into commercial fruit growing without first\r\nconsidering well their surroundings as to soil, location, shipping\r\nfacilities and other matters of that kind, and more especially to their\r\nown fitness for the business. A man must have an adaptability to, and a\r\ntaste for, any business to make a success of it, for each individual\r\nhas, more or less, an adaptation for some calling; and many of the\r\nfailures in life are the result of the individual’s failing to get into\r\nthe right channel.\r\n\r\nThe right person with the proper surroundings, having settled the\r\nquestion of planting in the affirmative, there will come many matters of\r\ndetail that will require the exercise of common sense and judgment, and\r\nfor the practice of which no specific rules can be given. I do not know\r\nany better way to help beginners than to tell them some of the things\r\nthey should not do, and thereby prevent their making some costly\r\nmistakes.\r\n\r\nThe most important question to be decided by a commercial planter is\r\nthat of varieties, for they must be of the kinds to suit the market\r\ndemands, must be regular bearers and barrel-fillers, and must ripen in\r\nsuccession. Don’t plant many varieties, for they must be shipped in\r\ncarloads, and each variety should be ample for that purpose. Don’t plant\r\nnovelties, the kinds that have all the good points and that never fail\r\nto bear, regardless of frosts and freezes, and are so often palmed off\r\nat fancy prices by smooth-talking salesmen who always have the perfect\r\nkinds; for when your “perfect kinds” begin to show up their crops of\r\ncrabs and seedlings your smooth agent will be far away practicing his\r\ngames upon other suckers. The perfect apple is yet a vision of the\r\nfuture, and need not be expected until the perfect man comes.\r\n\r\nConfine your commercial planting to well tested kinds that have\r\nsucceeded in locations similar to yours. Don’t buy inferior trees\r\nbecause they are cheap. You are planting for a lifetime, and your time\r\nand money will be worse than wasted trying to grow profitable orchards\r\nfrom inferior stock. Life is too short to waste it waiting for diseased\r\ntrees to drag along for years and then die just as their fruitings\r\nshould begin. Buy the best trees that you can get; for if you are not\r\nwilling to pay a fair price for good stock, don’t go into the business;\r\nfor that very fact is conclusive proof that you have missed your\r\ncalling. Having made your selection of varieties, and bought good trees,\r\ndon’t let them lie around exposed to sun and air until half dead and\r\nthen blame the nurseryman if they fail to grow. A tree is a thing of\r\nlife and loses vitality every hour it is exposed, and it will need all\r\nof its vitality in adapting itself to its new home, and to recover from\r\nits rude removal from where it grew. Don’t buy old trees, thinking you\r\nwill gain a year’s time in growth and fruiting, for such will not be the\r\ncase. All experienced planters agree that one-year apple trees will live\r\nbetter, grow better and bear fruit as early as older ones. They can be\r\nbought for less money, are easier to plant and can be pruned to grow the\r\nstyle of tree you want. Only the thrifty, healthy trees are large enough\r\nfor planting at one year old, and in buying them you run no risk of\r\ngetting inferior stock.\r\n\r\nDon’t plant without a thorough preparation of the soil, for no after\r\ncare will compensate for the bad effect of careless preparation. The\r\nfirst year is the crucial period in the life of a tree; it has lost in\r\nremoval many of its roots, and practically all of those fine, fibrous\r\nfeeders through which it drank life from the soil; and while nature has\r\nstored in its cells a reserve supply of vitality, yet it needs every aid\r\nthat can be given to enable it to overcome the loss of roots and the\r\nshock of removal and to succeed in its efforts to become established in\r\nits new home. Do not forget that the success or failure of your orchard\r\nwill be largely owing to the manner of planting and to the treatment\r\nthat it gets during the first year.\r\n\r\nHaving planted first-class, one-year trees in well prepared soil, cut\r\nthem down to stubs eighteen to twenty-four inches high and let them\r\nbranch close to the ground, for if there is a single reason for growing\r\na long-bodied tree I have never heard it. On the contrary, there are\r\nmany reasons against it. Let every twig that starts grow the first year,\r\nfor they will be needed to furnish leaves to assimilate the food taken\r\nup by the roots, and to return the solid part to increase the growth of\r\ntrees and root. You have now only the question of cultivation, and that\r\nshould be the best that you can give. Plant the orchard in some suitable\r\ncrop, preferably a low growing one, that requires hoe work, but leave\r\nample space next to the trees for continuous cultivation, and keep that\r\nspace clear of grass and weeds, for the trees cannot compete in their\r\nnew surroundings with these gross drinkers of the water that is in the\r\nsoil, that will be so badly needed to start their growth. Should the\r\nsummer be dry, keep a dust mulch by frequent cultivation with light\r\nharrows or sweeps until the fall rains come, and if your soil is\r\nreasonably fertile, the growth the trees will make will be a surprise\r\nand pleasure, and the hardest period in growing your orchard will be a\r\nthing of the past. Get all the information you can from practical fruit\r\ngrowers; study the bulletins of the National Agricultural Department and\r\nof the State Experimental Station; read the papers and magazines that\r\ntreat of these subjects; seek every available source of information; and\r\nhaving digested the opinions and practices of others, formulate your own\r\nopinions, map out the course you believe most suitable to your\r\nsurroundings and follow the dictates of your own judgment. Continue this\r\nline of action through the coming years, adapting your methods to suit\r\nthe condition of your orchard from year to year, and if you have\r\nexercised good common sense success is as certain to reward your efforts\r\nas anything in this life can be certain that is dependent upon human\r\neffort and the vicissitudes of drouths, storms and frosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Army Horse\r\n\r\n   By O. M. NORTON, V. M. D., VETERINARIAN ARTILLERY CORPS, U. S. A.\r\n\r\n\r\nKnowing that the method of purchase and the kind of horse required in\r\nthe military service of the United States is a matter of interest to\r\nboth horse breeders and dealers, the scarcity of horses meeting these\r\nrequirements has caused me to write this article, for Trotwood’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    First, as to Method of Purchase.\r\n\r\nThe buying of horses is done by the Quartermaster’s Department of the\r\narmy, the number of horses bought at any one time depending on the needs\r\nof the service at that time. This number may vary from one to two to\r\nhundreds and even thousands. Bids are advertised for, giving the number\r\nof horses required, and the date on which they are to be delivered to\r\nthe government. Then contractors or dealers in horses put in their bids\r\nat the prices at which they will furnish the required number of horses.\r\nThe bids are opened on a certain date, and the lowest bidder is given\r\nthe contract. Soon after the contract is awarded, a Board of Officers is\r\nappointed to inspect and buy the horses that the contractor brings\r\nbefore the Board, providing, of course, that the horses fulfill the\r\nspecifications of the contract.\r\n\r\nA horse purchasing Board usually consists of from three to five members.\r\nOne of these officers is from the Quartermaster’s Department, U. S.\r\nArmy, the others being usually members of the Cavalry or Artillery;\r\nthere is also a Veterinarian to inspect the horses in regard to\r\nsoundness. He may be either a Quartermaster’s Veterinarian (civilian) or\r\na Veterinarian of the Cavalry or Artillery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Usual Requirements of Horses Purchased.\r\n\r\nThe horses bought consist principally of two types, viz.: the Cavalry\r\nhorse, weighing from 950 to 1,150 pounds; and the Artillery horse,\r\nweighing from 1050 to 1300 pounds.\r\n\r\nCavalry Horse: The requirements of most contracts say that the horses\r\nmust be sound and well-bred; gentle under the saddle; free from vicious\r\nhabits, with free and prompt action at the walk, trot and canter;\r\nwithout blemish or defect; with easy mouth and gait, and otherwise to\r\nconform to the following description: a gelding of uniform or hardy\r\ncolor; in good condition; from 15 ¼ to 16 hands high; weight from 950 to\r\n1150 pounds; age from four to eight years; head and ears small; forehead\r\nbroad; eyes large and prominent; vision perfect in every respect;\r\nshoulders long and sloping well back; chest full, broad and deep;\r\nforelegs straight and standing well under; barrel large and increasing\r\nfrom girth toward flank; back short and straight; loins and haunches\r\nbroad and muscular; hocks well bent and under the horse; pasterns\r\nslanting and feet small and sound.\r\n\r\nArtillery Horse: The Artillery horse has in general about the same\r\nrequirements described for the Cavalry horse, with the following\r\nexceptions: weight being from 1050 to 1300 pounds; should be more of a\r\ndraught horse type, as he is required to work in harness, as well as\r\nunder saddle; shoulders should be well-muscled, so as to give good\r\nsupport to the collar; hindquarter should be heavy and strong; the horse\r\nshould not be what is known as “beefy” or lymphatic type, but should be\r\nactive on his feet and thus able to turn quickly.\r\n\r\nPrice: The price at present ranges from a hundred and fifty to a hundred\r\nand seventy-five dollars, probably about a hundred and sixty for Cavalry\r\nhorses; Artillery horses being somewhat higher, one hundred and\r\nsixty-five to one hundred and eighty dollars.\r\n\r\nWhen a horse is shown to the Board for purchase he is inspected by the\r\nBoard first in regard to general conformation, height, weight, muscular\r\ndevelopment, bones, etc.; whether he is high in withers, thus liable to\r\nsore back and bruises by saddle; length of back, thus whether able to\r\ncarry weight; should have short back with good muscular development;\r\nshould not be ewe-necked or bull-necked, thus hard to control and never\r\nmaking a good saddle animal.\r\n\r\nColor: Bays, browns, blacks and sorrels are the colors best suited for\r\nthe service. Grays are sometimes taken, there often being a gray horse\r\ntroop in the regiment, but are not as preferable as the hardier colors.\r\n\r\nSex: Only geldings are accepted, mares and stallions not being taken,\r\nexcepting in times of great necessity, as during war.\r\n\r\nGaits: Walk, trot and canter being the three gaits prescribed by Army\r\nRegulations, pacing or single-foot horses are not desired in the\r\nservice. And here is where the writer expects to receive Trotwood’s\r\ncondemnation. However, if they do pace they are used in the army, and\r\nthe writer has often noticed how quickly both officers and men will pick\r\na pacing horse, or one that single-foots for their mount if allowed to\r\ndo so, thus proving, that although we may condemn the pacer openly, deep\r\ndown in our hearts we have a soft spot for him who carries us many miles\r\nwith so little effort to himself or us.\r\n\r\nAfter the horse is inspected for general conformation he is trotted to\r\nsee his action, also to see whether he goes sound, is a paddler,\r\nstring-halt, interferes, etc. He is then examined by the Veterinarian as\r\nto defects, age, eyesight, etc. If affected with any enlargement or\r\nweakness of tendons, hocks as to spavins, thorough-pins, curbs;\r\nexamining pasterns for sidebones, ringbones, quittor, wire scars, etc.,\r\nhe is rejected. Sometimes horses are taken with small splints, also with\r\nsmall wire scars, especially in this Western country, where wire fences\r\nare so common. If shod, shoes are removed to examine feet thoroughly for\r\nquarter-crack, false-quarter, founder, corns, etc. The eyes are\r\nthoroughly examined for any signs of defects, and in this country,\r\nMiddle West, where periodic ophthalmia is so often seen, it is often\r\nhard to tell where a horse has had a few light attacks of it in the\r\npast, and it is well for the Veterinarian to reject a horse that is the\r\nleast suspicious, thus being on the safe side.\r\n\r\nIf the horse examined is not sound in every respect he should be\r\nrejected, and any one desiring to furnish horses for an army contract\r\nhad better read carefully the specifications stated above and then start\r\nout to compare the horses of his neighborhood with the specifications as\r\nset forth, and he will find that there are very few that are truly sound\r\nand able to pass muster. Where the horse is accepted by the purchasing\r\nBoard he is branded on the left shoulder with the letters “U. S.,” and\r\noften there is also branded on his hoof a number, and he is then ready\r\nfor shipment to the place where he is needed for service.\r\n\r\nBesides the two classes of horses mentioned, there are also a few very\r\nheavy draught horses bought for two batteries of siege Artillery, these\r\nhorses weighing from 1300 to 1500 pounds. There are also bought by the\r\ngovernment a few horses for special purposes, as horses used in the Fire\r\nDepartment and horses used in the Quartermaster’s Department as drivers,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe specifications of most contracts say that the horses shall be well\r\nbred, but owing to the scarcity at present of horses, and the high\r\nprices paid for highly bred horses, we often find in the service horses\r\nthat show none or very little indication of any breeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Disposal of Horses Unfit for Government Service.\r\n\r\nHorses that fail to give good service, or are not able to do the work\r\nrequired, or are unsuited for the purpose for which they were bought,\r\nare inspected and condemned and sold at public auction to the highest\r\nbidder; when condemned are branded with the letters “I. C.” (inspected\r\nand condemned). This brand is placed on the side of the neck under the\r\nmane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The History of the Hals\r\n                  THE FATHER OF THE TURF IN TENNESSEE.\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                         By JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\n“Uncle Berry,” continued Mr. Peyton, “I find, arrived in Tennessee in\r\nthe month of February, 1806. In the spring of that year he made a match\r\nof mile heats, $500 a side, over the Hartsville course, with Henrietta\r\nagainst Cotton’s Cygnet, which he won.\r\n\r\n“The old men of the neighborhood manifested great sympathy for the young\r\nstranger, and predicted that Lazarus Cotton would ruin him.\r\n\r\n“This was his first race in Tennessee, and I witnessed his last, which\r\nwas run over the Albion course at Gallatin, in 1862.\r\n\r\n“Shortly after the race at Hartsville, Uncle Berry trained a famous\r\nquarter race mare called Sallie Friar, by Jolly Friar, and made a match\r\nfor $500 a side, which was run on Goose Creek, near the Poison Knob.\r\nSallie was the winner, and she was afterwards purchased by Patton\r\nAnderson, who ran her with great success.\r\n\r\n“In the fall of 1806 Uncle Berry won with Post Boy the Jockey Club\r\npurse, three mile heats, at Gallatin, beating General Jackson’s Escape\r\nand others. Escape was the favorite, and the General and Mrs. Jackson,\r\nwho were present, backed him freely. Before this race he sold Post Boy\r\nto Messrs. Richard and William L. Alexander for $1,000 in the event of\r\nhis winning the race, after which he was withdrawn from the turf. Here\r\nhe first met General Jackson and made a match with him on Henrietta\r\nagainst Bibb’s mare for $1,000 a side, two mile heats, equal weights,\r\nthough the General’s mare was two years older than Henrietta, to come\r\noff in the spring of 1807 at Clover Bottom. The result proved that Uncle\r\nBerry underrated the horses and trainers of the Tennessee turf, as the\r\nGeneral’s mare, a thoroughbred daughter of imported Diomed, won the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n“The General, though deprived of the pleasure of being present on that\r\ninteresting occasion (having been summoned as a witness in the trial of\r\nAaron Burr at Richmond) showed that his heart was in the race, as\r\nappears from a letter to his friend, Patton Anderson, dated June 16, and\r\npublished in Parton’s ‘Life of Jackson,’ from which I quote:\r\n\r\n“‘At the race I hope you will see Mrs. Jackson; tell her not to be\r\nuneasy. I will be home as soon as my obedience to the precept of my\r\ncountry will permit. I have only to add as to the race, that the mare of\r\nWilliams’ is thought here to be a first-rate animal of her size; but if\r\nshe can be put up to it, she will fail in one heat. It will be then\r\nproper to put her up to all she knows at once.’\r\n\r\n“This is Jacksonian. Not many men would take the responsibility of\r\ngiving orders of how to run a race at the distance of five hundred\r\nmiles. This error of underrating an adversary, especially such an\r\nadversary, was a heavy blow to Uncle Berry, from which he did not fully\r\nrecover until he started Haynie’s Maria, mounted by Monkey Simon,\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\n“Not long after this defeat he set out to search for a horse with which\r\nto beat General Jackson, and purchased from General Wade Hampton, of\r\nSouth Carolina, a gelding called Omar, bringing him to Tennessee. After\r\nrecruiting his horse at Captain Alexander’s, near Hartsville, he went to\r\nNashville and offered General Jackson a match for $1,000 a side, three\r\nmile heats, according to rule. This the General declined, offering\r\ninstead the same terms as to weight, as in the former race, in which he\r\nwas allowed two years’ advantage, a proposition which, of course, was\r\nnot accepted.\r\n\r\n“Unable to get a race in Tennessee, Uncle Berry took his horse to\r\nNatchez, Miss., traveling through the swamps of the Chickasaw and\r\nChoctaw Nations, and entered him in a stake, three mile heats, $200\r\nentrance; but his bad luck pursued him, and just before the race his\r\nhorse snagged his foot, and he paid forfeit. He remained near Natchez\r\ntwelve months and nursed his horse as no other man could have done,\r\nuntil he was perfectly restored to health and in condition for the\r\napproaching fall races of 1808. Writing to Col. George Elliott, he urged\r\nhim to come to Natchez and bring fifteen or twenty horses to bet on\r\nOmar, and also to bring Monkey Simon to ride him, which Colonel Elliott\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n“Simon’s appearance on the field alarmed the trainer of the other horse,\r\nwho had known him in South Carolina, and, suspecting that Omar was a\r\nbite, he paid forfeit.\r\n\r\n“As Simon was a distinguished character, and made a conspicuous figure\r\non the turf of Tennessee for many years, it may be well to give some\r\naccount of him. His sobriquet of ‘Monkey Simon’ conveys a forcible idea\r\nof his appearance. He was a native African, and was brought with his\r\nparents when quite young to South Carolina, before the prohibition of\r\nthe slave trade took effect. In height he was four feet six inches, and\r\nweighed one hundred pounds. He was a hunchback with very short body and\r\nremarkably long arms and legs. His color and hair were African, but his\r\nfeatures were not. He had a long head and face, a high and delicate\r\nnose, a narrow but prominent forehead, and a mouth indicative of humor\r\nand firmness. It was rumored that Simon was a prince in his native\r\ncountry. I asked Uncle Berry the other day if he thought it was true. He\r\nreplied, ‘I don’t know; they said so, and if the princes there had more\r\nsense than the rest he must have been one of ’em, for he was the\r\nsmartest negro I ever saw.’ Colonel Elliott, speaking of Simon after his\r\ndeath, said he was the coolest, bravest, wisest rider he ever saw mount\r\na horse, in which opinion Uncle Berry fully concurs.\r\n\r\n“Simon was an inimitable banjo player and improvised his songs, making\r\nhumorous hits at everybody; even General Jackson did not escape him.\r\nIndeed, no man was his superior in repartee.\r\n\r\n“On one occasion Colonel Elliott and James Jackson, with a view to a\r\nmatch race for $1,000 a side, a dash on two miles, on Paddy Carey\r\nagainst Colonel Step’s mare, consented to lend Simon to ride this mare.\r\n\r\n“Colonel Step not only gave Simon $100 in the race, but stimulated his\r\npride by saying they thought they could win races without him, whereas\r\nhe knew their success was owing to Simon’s riding. Somewhat offended at\r\nthe idea of being lent out, and by no means indifferent to the money,\r\nSimon resolved to win the race, if possible; and nodding his head, said:\r\n‘I’ll show ’em.’ The mare had the speed of Paddy and took the track, and\r\nSimon, by his consummate skill and by intimidating the other rider,\r\nmanaged to run him far out on the turns, while he rested his mare for a\r\nbrush on the stretches.\r\n\r\n“On reaching the last turn Simon found the mare pretty tired, and Paddy,\r\na game four miler, locked with her, and he boldly swung out so far as to\r\nleave Paddy in the fence corner. The boy came up and attempted to pass\r\non the inside, but Simon headed him off, and growled at him all the way\r\ndown the quarter stretch, beating him out by a neck. Simon could come\r\nwithin a hair’s breadth of foul riding and yet escape the penalty.\r\nColonel Elliott lost his temper, which he rarely did, and abused Simon,\r\nsaying, ‘not satisfied with making Paddy run forty feet further than the\r\nmare on every turn, he must ride foul all the way down the quarter\r\nstretch.’\r\n\r\n“The Colonel repeated these charges until at length Simon answered him\r\nwith, ‘Well, Colonel Elliott (as he always called him), I’ve won many a\r\nrace that way for you, and it is the first time I ever heard you object\r\nto it.’”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMuch has been said and written of the tenderness and care bestowed by\r\nthe Arabs on their favorite horses, but I doubt whether any Arabian\r\nsince the time of the Prophet ever showed such devotion to his favorite\r\nsteed as Uncle Berry to the thoroughbreds under his care. In fact, his\r\nkindly nature embraced all domestic animals. For many years he resided\r\non a rich, productive farm near Gallatin, where he trained Betsy Malone,\r\nSarah Bladen and many other distinguished race horses; raised fine stock\r\nand fine crops and proved himself to be one of the best farmers in the\r\nneighborhood. He had pets of all kinds—huge hogs that would come and\r\nsprawl themselves to be rubbed, and game chickens that would feed from\r\nhis hand, and followed him if he left home on foot, often obliging him\r\nto return and shut them up.\r\n\r\nHe raised many celebrated racers for himself and others, and so\r\njudicious was his system that, at the age of two, they had almost the\r\nmaturity of three-year-olds. His last thoroughbred was a chestnut filly,\r\nfoaled in 1859, by Lexington, dam Sally Roper (the dam of Berry), which\r\nwas entered in a stake for three-year-olds, $500 entrance, two mile\r\nheats, to come off over the Albion course, near Gallatin, in the fall of\r\n1862. This filly was, of course, a great favorite with Uncle Berry. She\r\nnever associated with any quadruped after she was weaned, her master\r\nbeing her only companion. At two years old she was large and muscular\r\nand very promising, and in the summer of 1861 I urged Uncle Berry to\r\nsend her to the race course (where I had Fannie McAlister, dam of\r\nMuggins, and several other animals in training), that she might be\r\ngentled and broken to ride. His reply was: “I have been thinking of your\r\nkind offer—I know she ought to be broke, but, poor thing! she don’t know\r\nanything; she has never been anywhere, and has never even been mounted.\r\nI am afraid she will tear herself all to pieces.” But he finally\r\nconsented for my colored trainer, Jack Richlieu, to take her to the\r\ntrack. On meeting Mrs. Williams a few days afterwards, I inquired for\r\nUncle Berry. Her reply was: “He is well enough as to health, but he is\r\nmighty lonesome since the filly went away.”\r\n\r\nBut of all the horses he ever owned, Walk-in-the-Water was his especial\r\nfavorite. In the language of Burns, he “lo’ed him like a vera brither.”\r\nHe was a large chestnut gelding, foaled in 1813, by Sir Archie, dam by\r\nGondola, a thoroughbred son of Mark Anthony, and these two were the only\r\npure crosses in his pedigree, yet he was distinguished on the turf until\r\nfifteen years old, more especially in races of three and four mile\r\nheats.\r\n\r\nI was present when Walk, at nineteen years of age, ran his last race, of\r\nfour mile heats, over the Nashville course, against Polly Powell.\r\n\r\nUncle Berry, several years before, had presented him to Thomas Foxall,\r\nwith a positive agreement that he would neither train nor run him again;\r\nhaving a two-year-old in training, Mr. Foxall took up the old horse\r\nmerely to gallop in company with him, a few weeks before the Nashville\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nIt became well known that the mare would start for the four mile purse,\r\nand she was so great a favorite that no one would enter against her.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor, to prevent a “walkover,” induced Foxall to allow him to\r\nannounce Walk-in-the-Water, whose name would be sure to draw a crowd.\r\nThere was a large attendance, and the game old horse made a wonderful\r\nrace, considering his age, running a heat and evidently losing in\r\nconsequence of his want of condition. When the horses were brought out I\r\nmissed Uncle Berry, and went in search of him. I found him in the grove\r\nalone, sitting on a log and looking very sad. “Are you not going up to\r\nsee old Walk run?” I inquired. “No, I would as soon see a fight between\r\nmy grandfather and a boy of twenty,” he replied.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1827, when Walk was fourteen years old, Uncle Berry took him\r\nand several colts that were entered in stakes to Natchez, Miss.,\r\ntraveling by land through the terrible swamps of the Chickasaw and\r\nChoctaw Nations. The colts had made very satisfactory trial runs in\r\nTennessee, but suffered so severely from the journey that they either\r\npaid forfeits or lost their stakes, so that Walk-in-the-Water was the\r\nonly hope for winning expenses. He was entered in the four mile race of\r\nthe Jockey Club, and his only competitor was the b. gelding Archie\r\nBlucher, fifteen years old, a horse of great fame as a “four miler” in\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nOn the evening before the race the Jockey Club met and changed the rule,\r\nreducing the weight on all horses of fifteen years or upward to one\r\nhundred pounds, leaving all others their full weight, or one hundred and\r\ntwenty-four pounds, three pounds less for mares and geldings.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary proceeding would not have been tolerated by the\r\ngentlemen who, at a later day, composed that Club, but Uncle Berry\r\nprotested in vain against the injustice done him. He, however, concluded\r\nto run Walk, giving his half brother twenty-one pounds advantage in\r\nweight. Walk had the speed of Blucher, and when the drum tapped, took\r\nthe track, with Blucher at his side, and these two game Archies ran\r\nlocked through the heat, Walk winning by half a length. The second heat\r\nwas a repetition of the first, and never was a more tremendous struggle\r\nwitnessed on a race course—a blanket would have covered the horses from\r\nthe tap of the drum to the close of the race.\r\n\r\nAny man who has watched a favorite horse winning a race, out of the fire\r\nand blue blazes at that, can appreciate Uncle Berry’s feelings during\r\nthat terrible struggle. The horses swung into the quarter stretch, the\r\neighth and last mile, and Uncle Berry, seeing the sorrel face of his old\r\nfavorite ahead, cried out at the top of his voice, “Come home, Walk,\r\ncome home! Your master wants money, and that badly.” After the race he\r\nexpressed his opinion of the Club in no measured terms. Though\r\nhabitually polite and respectful, particularly toward the authorities of\r\na Jockey Club, he was a man of undaunted courage and ready to resist\r\noppression, irrespective of consequences, but his friends interposed and\r\npersuaded him to let the matter pass.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the stables the horses were being prepared for their\r\nnight’s rest, and he made them each an address. “Jo,” he said to a\r\nPacolet colt, named Jo Doan, that had lost his stake in slow time, “you\r\nwon’t do to tie to; I’ve always done a good part by you. I salted you\r\nout of my hand while you sucked your mammy; you know what you promised\r\nme before you left home (alluding to a trial run), and now you have\r\nthrown me off among strangers,” and he passed on, complaining of the\r\nother colts. The groom was washing old Walk-in-the-Water’s legs while he\r\nstood calm and majestic, with his game, intelligent head, large,\r\nbrilliant eyes, inclined shoulders and immense windpipe, looking every\r\ninch a hero. When Uncle Berry came to him he threw his arms around his\r\nneck and said, bursting into tears, “Here’s a poor old man’s friend in a\r\ndistant land.”\r\n\r\nWalk-in-the-Water won more long races than any horse of his day. If I\r\ncan procure the early volumes of the American Turf Register, I will in a\r\nfuture number give some account of his performances.\r\n\r\nHaney’s Maria was a most extraordinary race nag at all distances,\r\nprobably not inferior to any which has appeared in America since her\r\nday. She was bred by Bennet Goodrum, of Virginia, who moved to North\r\nCarolina, where she was foaled in the spring of 1808; from there he\r\nremoved to Tennessee, and, in the fall of 1809, sold Maria to Capt.\r\nJesse Haney, of Sumner County. She was by imported Diomed, one of the\r\nlast of his get when thirty years of age. Her first dam was by Taylor’s\r\nBel-Air (the best son of imported Medley), second dam by Symmes’ Wild\r\nAir, third dam by imported Othello, out of an imported mare.\r\n\r\nShe was a dark chestnut, exactly fifteen hands high, possessing great\r\nstrength, muscular power, and symmetry, the perfect model of a race\r\nhorse. Maria commenced her turf career at three, and ran all distances\r\nfrom a quarter of a mile to four mile heats, without losing a race or\r\nheat until she was nine years old. In the fall of 1811 she ran a\r\nsweepstake over the Nashville course, entrance $100, two mile heats,\r\nbeating General Jackson’s colt, Decatur, by Truxton; Col. Robert Bell’s\r\nfilly, by imported Diomed, and four others; all distanced the first\r\nheat, except Bell’s filly. This defeat aroused the fire and combative\r\nspirit of General Jackson almost as much as did his defeat by Mr. Adams\r\nfor the Presidency, and he swore “by the Eternal” he would beat her if a\r\nhorse could be found in the United States able to do so. But, although\r\nthe General conquered the Indians, defeated Packenham, beat Adams and\r\nClay, crushed the monster bank under the heel of his military boot, he\r\ncould not beat Maria, in the hands of Uncle Berry.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1812, over the same course, she won a sweepstake, $500\r\nentrance, four mile heats, beating Colonel Bell’s Diomed mare, a horse\r\ncalled Clifden, and Col. Ed Bradley’s “Dungannon.” (General Jackson was\r\ninterested in Dungannon.) This was a most exciting and interesting race,\r\nespecially to the ladies, who attended in great numbers; those of\r\nDavidson County, with Aunt Rachel Jackson and her niece, Miss Rachel\r\nHays, at their head, backing Dungannon, while the Sumner County ladies,\r\nled by Miss Clarissa Bledsoe, daughter of the pioneer hero, Col. Anthony\r\nBledsoe, bet their last glove on little Maria. After this second defeat,\r\nGeneral Jackson became terribly in earnest, and before he gave up the\r\neffort to beat Maria, he ransacked Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia and\r\nKentucky. He was almost as clamorous for a horse as was Richard in the\r\nbattle of Bosworth Field. He first wrote Col. William R. Johnson to send\r\nhim the best four mile horse in Virginia, without regard to price,\r\nexpressing a preference for the famous Bel-Air mare, Old Favorite.\r\nColonel Johnson sent him, at a high price, the celebrated horse,\r\nPacolet, by imported Citizen, who had greatly distinguished himself as a\r\nfour miler in Virginia. In the fall of 1813, at Nashville, Maria won a\r\nsweepstake, $1,000 entrance, $500 forfeit, four mile heats, beating\r\nPacolet with great ease, two paying forfeit. It was said that Pacolet\r\nhad received an injury in one of his fore ankles. The General, being\r\nanything but satisfied with the result, made a match on Pacolet against\r\nMaria for $1,000 a side, $500 forfeit, four mile heats, to come off over\r\nthe same course, the fall of 1814; but, Pacolet being still lame, he\r\npaid forfeit. These repeated failures only made the General more\r\ninflexible in his purpose, and, in conjunction with Mr. James Jackson,\r\nwho then resided in the vicinity of Nashville, he sent to South Carolina\r\nand bought Tam O’Shanter, a horse distinguished in that state.\r\n\r\nThe fall of 1814 Maria won, over the same course, club purse of $275,\r\ntwo mile heats, beating Tam O’Shanter, William Lytle’s Royalist, and two\r\nor three others.\r\n\r\nA few days after, over the same course, she won a proprietor’s purse,\r\n$350, only one starting against her. About this time General Jackson\r\nsent to Georgia and purchased of Colonel Alston Stump-the-Dealer, but,\r\nfor some cause, did not match him against Maria. The General then sent\r\nto Kentucky and induced Mr. DeWett to come to the Hermitage with his\r\nmare (reputed to be the swiftest mile nag in the United States), with a\r\nview of matching her against Maria. Mr. DeWett trained his mare at the\r\nHermitage. In the fall of 1814, at Clover Bottom, Maria beat this mare\r\nfor $1,000 a side, dash of a mile. In the fall of 1815 General Jackson\r\nand Mr. DeWett ran the same mare against Maria, dash of half a mile, for\r\n$1,500 a side, $500 on the first quarter, $500 on six hundred yards, and\r\n$500 on the half mile, all of which bets were won by Maria, the last by\r\none hundred feet. This was run at Nashville. The next week, over same\r\ncourse, she won a match $1,000 a side, mile heats, made with General\r\nJackson and Col. Ed Ward, beating the Colonel’s horse, Western Light.\r\nSoon after this race she was again matched against her old competitor,\r\nDeWett’s mare, for $1,000 a side, over the same course (which was in\r\nMcNairy’s Bottom, above the sulphur spring), Maria giving her a distance\r\n(which was then 120 yards) in a dash of two miles. Colonel Lynch, of\r\nVirginia, had been induced to come and bring his famous colored rider,\r\nDick, to ride DeWett’s mare. Before the last start Uncle Berry directed\r\nhis rider (also colored) to put the spurs to Maria from the tap of the\r\ndrum. But, to his amazement, they went off at a moderate gait, DeWett’s\r\nmare in the lead, making the first mile in exactly two minutes. As they\r\npassed the stand Uncle Berry ordered his boy to go on, but the mares\r\ncontinued at the same rate until after they entered the back stretch,\r\nMaria still a little in the rear, when the rider gave her the spurs and\r\nshe beat her competitor one hundred and eighty yards, making the last\r\nmile in one minute and forty-eight seconds. All who saw the race\r\ndeclared that she made the most extraordinary display of speed they ever\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\nWhen Uncle Berry demanded an explanation of his rider he learned that\r\nDick, who professed to be a conjurer, or spiritualist, had frightened\r\nthe boy by threatening that if he attempted to pass ahead of him until\r\nthey ran a mile and a quarter, he would lift him out of his saddle, or\r\nthrow down his mare by a mere motion of his whip, which the boy fully\r\nbelieved. Most negroes at that time, and some white people in this\r\nenlightened age, believe in these absurdities. The speed of Maria was\r\nwonderful. She and the famous quarter race horse, Saltram, were trained\r\nby Uncle Berry at the same time, and he often “brushed” them through the\r\nquarter stretch, “and they always came out locked.” Whichever one got\r\nthe start kept the lead.\r\n\r\nAfter the last race above mentioned, some Virginians present said that\r\nthere were horses in Virginia that could beat Maria. Captain Haney\r\noffered to match her against any horse in the world, from one to four\r\nmile heats, for $5,000.\r\n\r\nShortly after this conversation, meeting General Jackson, Captain Haney\r\ninformed him what had passed, and the General, in his impressive manner,\r\nreplied: “Make the race for $50,000, and consider me in with you. She\r\ncan beat any animal in God’s whole creation.”\r\n\r\nIn March, 1816, at Lexington, Ky., she beat Robin Gray (sire of\r\nLexington’s third dam) a match, mile heats, for $1,000 a side. The next\r\nmonth she beat at Cage’s race paths in Sumner County, near Bender’s\r\nFerry, Mr. John Childress’ Woodlawn filly, by Truxton, a straight half\r\nmile for $1,000 a side, giving her sixty feet. Maria won this race by\r\ntwo feet only. This was the first race I ever saw, and I was greatly\r\nimpressed with the beautiful riding of Monkey Simon.\r\n\r\nAfter the race Maria was taken by Uncle Berry to Waynesboro, Ga., where\r\nshe bantered the world, but could not get a race. There were very few\r\njockey clubs in the country at that time.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1817, Maria was returned to Captain Haney in Sumner County,\r\nand soon afterwards sold by him to Pollard Brown, who got her beaten at\r\nCharleston in a four mile heat race with Transport and Little John, when\r\nshe was nine years old. Maria carried over weight, ran under many\r\ndisadvantages, and lost the race by only a few feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       (Continued in next issue.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Mammy and Memory\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photo by Julie A.

The\r\nadvancement in the past century was phenomenal in the marvelous\r\nachievements in inventions and in discoveries in every branch of\r\nindustry, in the arts and sciences; and I am delighted to know that\r\nagriculture, horticulture and floriculture have also received some\r\nattention, although not so much as might have been. Still, we are\r\npleased that a beginning in those branches has been made, and we hope\r\nfor much more rapid advancement within the next two decades.\r\n\r\nThat there has been a great awakening and a marked advancement in the\r\nmaterial progress in the past century no one will seek to controvert the\r\nfact, but let us hope that while we have been making such rapid strides\r\nmaterially we have also, during the same period, made equally as much\r\nadvancement spiritually, for to glorify God is (or ought to be) man’s\r\nchief aim in life. There has been a beginning in the advancement of\r\nscientific agriculture, and the agricultural world is indebted to no one\r\nso much as to John Bennett Lawes, of Rothamsted, England, who devoted a\r\nlifetime of study and the lands of his large estate to experimental\r\nfarming, the results of which he published from time to time in the\r\nGardener’s Chronicle, and at his death left a fund sufficient in trust\r\nto carry on the great work he had begun and carried forward his\r\ncelebrated tests of experimental farming, extending over fifty years,\r\nfrom 1844 to 1893. Indeed, John Bennett Lawes may justly be called the\r\nfather of the experimental stations in our country. In these earliest\r\nexperiments the effects of various manures were carried out. It was in\r\nthese trials that the excellent results obtained by manuring turnips\r\nwith phosphate previously treated with sulphuric acid were first\r\ndiscovered, and his taking out a patent, in 1842, for treating mineral\r\nphosphate with sulphuric acid, which was the commencement of the present\r\nenormous manufacture of artificial manures. The above experiments were\r\ncarried on in pots by Mr. Lawes, but, in 1843, he was joined by Dr.\r\nGilbert, as eminent a chemist as was Mr. Lawes himself, and from 1844\r\nbegan the field experiments, which have become world-wide for the great\r\nbenefits they have resulted in to agriculturists everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe Rothamsted estate was divided into small fields, and the effects of\r\nthe various crops on the fields with and without manure were carefully\r\nnoted. Soils were analyzed before the crops were planted, and also after\r\nthe crops were harvested, to determine the loss or gain of nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe rotation of crops was studied thoroughly, and beans and peas were\r\nthen made one in a four-course rotation. But even earlier than 1844 it\r\nhad been observed that leguminous plants, of which there are thousands\r\ndistributed over this sphere, had a beneficial effect on the land for\r\nthe succeeding crop. At Rothamsted the legumes, or such of them as\r\nbeans, peas or red clover, were thoroughly tried, and it was invariably\r\nfound as one in a rotation of four to produce the same results. In some\r\nway that they then could not explain, the land after a crop of legumes\r\nwas very much richer in nitrogen, amounting in many instances to 300\r\npounds per acre. These worthy gentlemen kept on for years trying to\r\naccount for the phenomenon and endeavored to discover the true source of\r\nnitrification. But to the French chemists Schlosing and Muntz belong the\r\ncredit of establishing by experiment the true nature of nitrification.\r\nTheir first paper on the subject appeared early in 1877, or only\r\ntwenty-nine years ago. They wished to ascertain if the presence of humic\r\nmatter was essential to the purification of sewage by soil, and for this\r\npurpose they conducted an experiment, in which sewage was passed slowly\r\nthrough a column of sand and limestone. Under these circumstances\r\ncomplete nitrification of the sewage took place. They then allowed a\r\nchloroform vapor to fall for some time on top of the column, the sewage\r\npassing as before. Nitrification now entirely ceased and was not renewed\r\nfor seven weeks, though the supply of chloroform was suspended. A small\r\nquantity of nitrifying soil was shaken with the water and the turbid\r\nextracts poured on the top of the column. Nitrification at once\r\nrecommenced, as strongly as before.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the force of the experiment, Muntz had previously shown\r\nthat chloroform was a means of distinguishing between the action of a\r\nsimple ferment as diastase, and a living organism, as yeast, the\r\nchloroform having no influence on the work of the unorganized ferment,\r\nwhich immediately stopped the activity of a living agent. The above\r\ndiscovery of Schlosing and Muntz of the true theory of nitrification of\r\nthe soil was the greatest achievement to the agricultural world,\r\ninasmuch as it has been demonstrated by numerous eminent chemists and\r\nproved to be an ascertained fact; and this problem solved, which had\r\noccupied the ablest scientific minds for centuries. Now we hope for some\r\nadvancement with the farmers of the United States in the future. With\r\nthe discovery of Schlosing and Muntz there is no necessity for such an\r\nidea as wornout land, as is prevalent in this great country, where the\r\nchief occupation of the agriculturist has been in exploiting his land,\r\njust in the same manner as everything else has been exploited. With an\r\never increasing population of this sphere, there is no need to fear the\r\nearth’s capacity in producing enough to supply all their wants. That is\r\nwhen our farmers realize the paramount importance of the above\r\ndiscovery, and begin to see how bountifully an all-wise Creator has\r\nprovided for us in placing these legumes on this earth for the benefit\r\nof mankind. They are a double blessing to us, for they not only abstract\r\nnitrogen from the atmosphere and deposit it in the ground for the\r\nsucceeding crops, and restore the fertility of the land, but also, when\r\nthey are made one in a four-course rotation, fill the soil with fibre or\r\nroots, which no soil can be in its highest productive condition without.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Great New South\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the past quarter of a century (1880–1905) from statistics gathered by\r\nRichard H. Edmonds, Trotwood’s finds the South has doubled the value of\r\nher cotton crop, her exports and her assessed property; has trebled her\r\nmanufacturing products, her railroad mileage and the value of her farm\r\nproducts. She has multiplied by five her lumber products, increased her\r\nmanufacturing capital six-fold, her tons of pig iron produced\r\neight-fold, her phosphate tons mined nine-fold, her cotton bales\r\nconsumed ten-fold, her capital invested in cotton mills eleven-fold, her\r\ntons of coal mined twelve-fold, her number of spindles on cotton mills\r\nfourteen-fold, her tons of coke produced sixteen-fold, her number of\r\ncotton oil mills seventeen-fold, her capital invested in cotton oil\r\nmills eighteen-fold, and her barrels of petroleum two hundred and\r\nthirty-five-fold!\r\n\r\nShe raised three-fourths of the world’s cotton, and has one-half of the\r\nstanding timber of the whole country. Her own cotton mills consume\r\n2,282,900 bales yearly, or nearly as much as New England and all the\r\nrest of the country combined, whereas in 1880 she consumed but one-sixth\r\nas much as New England. Europe pays her a tribute of over _one million\r\ndollars daily for cotton_. Thus marches on the Great New South.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Bre’r Washington’s Consolation\r\n\r\n                     Saturday night my wife died,\r\n                       Sunday she was buried,\r\n                     Monday was my kotin’ day\r\n                       And Chewsday I got married.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever I heard the old man singing I knew he was in a reminiscent mood\r\nand so I put down my book and went out to the barn, where he was\r\nbuilding a pen to put the fattening Berkshires in. For a month these\r\nslick rascals had been running in the ten-acre lot planted in corn and,\r\nat the “lay-by plowing,” sown in peas, all for their especial benefit.\r\nThe corn had nearly ripened and the peas were in the pod; and now, day\r\nafter day they had wallowed in the water of the ten-acre field branch or\r\ntorn down the tempting corn stalks or eaten the juicy peas till their\r\ntails had taken on the two-ring curl of contentment and they had grown\r\ntoo fat to run in so large a lot.\r\n\r\n“An’ now dey must be put in de parlor,” said the old man as he proceeded\r\nto build their pen, “an’ fed on poun’ cake an’ punkins. Fust er good dry\r\npen, bilt on er solid blue lime-rock, ef you so forechewnate es to lib\r\nin Middle Tennessee, an’ ef you don’t lib heah,” he half soliloquized,\r\n“jes’ bild it in sum mud hole an’ be dun wid it, fur you ain’t gwi’\r\nfatten your horgs no-how ef youn don’t lib in Tennessee,” he said, with\r\na sly wink. “Den, arter you gits the pen bilt bring up a load ob yaller\r\npunkins to sharpen up dey appletights an’ start ’em off right; den\r\nplenty ob dis year’s cohn wid er sour-meal mash ebry now and den to keep\r\n’em eatin’ good, an’ den, chile, ’long erbout Krismas time jes’ sot your\r\nmouf fur spairribs an’ sawsages—e—yum, yum, yum”—and he wiped the corner\r\nof his mouth suspiciously.\r\n\r\n                  “Ole Naper cum to my house\r\n                    I thout he cum to see me,\r\n                  But when I cum to find him out,\r\n                    He’s ’swade my wife to leave me.”\r\n\r\nhe sang again. “I’ll tell you, suh,” he laughed, “I can’t see what\r\nfatnin’ horgs hes got to do with marryin’, but dat’s what de\r\naixpectashuns ob dis horg-pen remin’s me ob ennyway—’bout de time I was\r\nkotin’ Unk Peter’s widder, way back in fifty-fo’,” he added\r\nreflectively, “an’ de hard time I had gettin’ enny konsolashun from dat\r\nar ’oman. I tell you, suh, it ain’t easy to git enny konsolashun from er\r\nwidder—not nigh es easy es it am frum er gal.

I seemed ter be walkin’ in er gyarden whar golden roses bloomed on\r\npeppermint candy vines, an’ coon-dorgs wid diamon’ eyes wuz treein’\r\nsolid silver ’possums up in de ’simmon trees!\r\n\r\n“I tell you, boss, I wanted to marry! An’ de fus’ thing I knowed, me an’\r\ndat ole muel was gwine in a peert trot up de road t’words de cabin ob\r\nSister Calline Jones, Unk Peter Jones’ widder. I felt sorter mean, an’ I\r\ndisremember sayin’ to myself: ‘Heah, you go, Wash, arter all yore good\r\nrevolushuns, de biggest fool in de ban’ waggin.’ As I rid off, I seed\r\ndat old mischeevus Mistis ob mine, Miss Charlotte, God bless her!—an’\r\nshe called out to me kinder mad-lak, an’ sed: ‘Unkle Wash, I think it’s\r\na shame you ain’t put on moanin’ for Aunt Peggy.’ The way you are\r\ndressed, ennybody’d think you are gwine to er ball!’\r\n\r\n“‘Lor’ bless your sweet soul, Miss Charlotte,’ sez I, ‘don’t hab ter put\r\non moanin’ lak de white folks; it am already dar, an’ mo’ dan skin deep,\r\ntoo,’ I sez. ‘I bin moanin’ for Peggy eber sense I marrid ’er,’ I sed,\r\n‘an’ now is my time for rejicement, Miss Charlotte, an’ I gwineter\r\nrejice. Sides dat,’ I sed, ‘whilst I’m moanin’, all my things gwine to\r\nrack, an’ de chillun’s got nobody to take keer ob ’em an’ sumpin’ nuther\r\nsho’ gwinter happen, Miss Charlotte.’\r\n\r\n“Miss Charlotte bleege to laf, an’ old Marster he spoke up an’ say, ‘Let\r\n’im erlone, Charlotte. Can’t you see de ole fool has got it? Go on, you\r\nole idjut,’ he sed to me, ‘an’ marry sumbody an’ git back heah termorrer\r\nwid enuf sense in yo’ haid to run er straight furrer fer de fall\r\nplowin’.’ An’ wid dat I lit out.\r\n\r\n“Now, Unk Pete an’ me, suh,” he explained, “belong to de same church—de\r\nCandle Light—an’ to de same lodge—de Ainshunt an’ Honorbul Order ob de\r\nBow-legged Sons of de Black Cat—an’ ’course I ain’ gwi’ marry his widder\r\nnow an’ spile sum moral observashun, so I jes’ stopped at his cabin to\r\ngit his consent fur me to marry his widder.\r\n\r\n“Get his consent?” I asked. “Why how could you get his consent if he was\r\ndead?”\r\n\r\n“Who sed he was dead?” said the old darky, quickly. “I nurver sed so; I\r\nsed she was his widder!”\r\n\r\nI tried to explain to him that a man couldn’t have a widow unless he\r\nwere dead, but this only made him throw back his head and laugh\r\nheartily.\r\n\r\n“Wal, wal, wal, white folks got such curious ways of thinkin’. Who’d\r\nurver thout it? You see,” he said very solemnly and impressively, “It\r\nwas dis way: Unk Peter wus gittin’ ole, an’ went off contrawise to de\r\ndoctrine an’ marrid dis young ’oman. Furst thing he know, he waked up\r\nsum mohnin’ an’ find hisself de father ob ten chilouns, sum ob ’em hisn\r\nan’ sum ob ’em hern, by her fus’ husban’, an’ dar he wus gittin’ so ole\r\nhe cudn’t s’port ’em. So up he jumps an’ at de naixt meetin’ ob de\r\nchurch he runs fer de offis ob Patriark ob Santerfercashun, which,\r\n’kordin’ to de doctrine ob Hollerness, marrid ’im to de church. ’Course\r\narter Unk Pete gits santerfercashun an’ marrid to de church, he cudn’t\r\nhab enny uder wife, so he hafter put Sis Calline an’ de chilluns aside,\r\nwhich made all ob dem de widders ob de church. Don’t you ketch on to de\r\ndoctrine, suh?”\r\n\r\nI told him I had caught.\r\n\r\nThe old man was silent as if in deep thought. Then he said: “I wus young\r\nden, an’ bleeved eberything erbout de church an’ de doctrine I eber\r\nheurd, smelt or dreamed, but I am older now, an’ I’ve cum to de pinted\r\nkonklushun dat when er man or er woman gets santerfercashun; one or two\r\nthings done happen to ’em: Either de flahs ob youth dun played out in de\r\nbilers ob dar natral swashun—de ole Adam in ’em jes’ peg out from ole\r\naige—or else dey am layin’ low, Brer ’Possum, fur de slickes’ game dat\r\neber wus played.

An’ dars whar de patr’arks ob ole had it\r\non to de res’ ob us,” said the old man knowingly. “Jes’ let de good\r\nMarster let me lib heah erbout seben hundred years longer, an’ jes’\r\nwatch me sot back an’ view unconserned de fleetin’ vanerties ob dis\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n“Brer Peter wus in deep prayer when I rid up to his cabin, an’ arter he\r\nris up from his knees he blessed on de top ob my observashun, gib me de\r\ngrip ob Ainshunt an’ Honorbul Order ob de Bow-legged Sons ob de Black\r\nCat, an’ ’lowed he’d lak ter tak off my sandals an’ wash my feet; but I\r\ntole ’im I jes’ wash ’em ’bout er month befo’ an’ didn’t hab no time fur\r\nfoolishness; dat I cum to dis cabin fur konsolashun an’ den I jus’ got\r\noffen dat muel an’ plowed a straight furrer ob facts down de row ob his\r\nhead: ‘Brer Peter,’ sez I, ‘de doctrine ob our church teach us it am not\r\ngood fur er man wid er dozen chilluns to lib erlone on one side ob er\r\nplantashun, an’ er nice, seekin’ lookin’ widder ’oman wid ten mo’ to lib\r\nerlone on de yudder side. In union dar am strength, in numbers dar am\r\nprosperity, an’ in Duteromety dar am happiness. Brer Peter, I wants ter\r\nmarry Sister Calline,’ sez I. ‘She am yo’ widder an’ de widder ob de\r\nchurch, but you know yourself she ain’t had no sho’ ’tall—jes’ ha’f a\r\nmarrid life an’ er house full ob chilluns—ten ob ’em, all needin’ sum\r\nlubbin’ father’s gidin’ arm, wid er hickory attachment, whilst my twelve\r\nor fifteen all need de spirtool ker ob er good muther ercompament. De\r\ncotton pickin’ seezen am ’most on us, an’ if I kin jine our forces I’ll\r\nhab er lead-pipe cinch on de cotton crap ob Tennessee to say nuthin’\r\n’bout de fo’teenth ’mendment to de skule law fixin’ de pro ratter ob all\r\nhouseholders raisin’ twenty or mo’ widin de skule aige.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, suh, Brer Peter tuck the thing mighty hard, mighty hard. He\r\ndidn’t wanter do dat thing ’tall. But arter he dun prayed ober it, he\r\ncum out wid er new light in his eye, an’ he put his hand on my head an’\r\nbless me an’ say, ‘Brer Washington, I’ve prayed ober it. It am de will\r\nob de Lord. Lite on dat muel an’ seek your konsolashun. Go in an’\r\nreceive de sanshun ob her reten-shun an’ de kompliment ob her adorin’.’\r\nAnd he kinder wink his off eye an’ sed, ‘Go in an’ win, fur you am de\r\nSamson ob lub fightin’ de Phillustines ob matrermony; but when you cum\r\nto git konsolashun from er widder’—an’ dar he wink hes eye ergin—‘use de\r\nsame weepun dat Samson used an’ victory am yourn.’\r\n\r\n“But when I got to de widder’s cabin an’ tole her—great Scott, suh! she\r\ntuck it terribul hard. She didn’t wan’ marry ’tall. Leastwise she made\r\nme b’leeve it.

Don’t you\r\nthink you’d be satisfied ef I’d continue in de sisterly relashuns ob de\r\nchurch wid you?’\r\n\r\n“‘Sister Calline,’ sez I, sorter detarmined lak, ‘I’ve had ten ebry day\r\nsisters all my life en sum seben hundred Sunday ones. What I now wants\r\nam one wife!’\r\n\r\n“Oh, I tell you, suh, you gotter shoot mighty klose fur konsolashun when\r\nyou wants ter marry a widder!\r\n\r\n“We kept it up for hours, she argyfyin’ an’ me argyfyin’, she prayin’\r\nan’ me prayin’. I tell you, Boss, she wus er speedy filly, an’ she had\r\nno noshun ob quittin’. We went round de fus’ quarter ob de last mile\r\nnose and nose—argyment ergin argyment, prayer ergin prayer. I thout sho’\r\nshe had me distanced onct when she fotch out de scriptures on me an’\r\nturned to de twenty-second chapter ob Exerdust an’ sed: ‘Brer\r\nWashington, read fur yo’self: “Thou shalt not afflict any widder or\r\nfatherless chile.”’ But I turned over to Timerthy, de fifth chapter an’\r\nde third verse, an’ sez I, ‘Sister Calline, whut you read am Ole\r\nTestament. It am anshunt histery. Heah am de New Testament, heah am de\r\nnew doctrine: “Honor widders dat am widders, indeed.”’ Oh, I tell you,\r\nBoss,” laughed the old man, “I sho’ hung onto de sulky wheels ob her\r\ncontenshun wid de wings ob my orthorteries—you gotter hab sum speed lef’\r\nfur de home stretch ef you wants ter beat er widder home!\r\n\r\n“An’ so we went, ’round an’ ’round, wheel ergin wheel, an both drivin’\r\nfur life, she quotin’ scriptures and argyfyin’ an’ me comin’ back wid\r\nNumbers an’ Duterrumetics—an’ sumtimes things dat wus Reverlashuns to\r\nher!

In course I did—marrid her dat night\r\nan’ tuck ’er home de naixt day; ain’t I bin tellin’ you whut er hard\r\ntime I had gettin’ konsolashun frum dat ar ’oman?”\r\n\r\nHe sawed vigorously away for awhile, but I could see he wished to tell\r\nsomething else. Finally I said:\r\n\r\n“Well, go on, I’m waiting.”\r\n\r\nHe turned around quickly, laid down his saw, laughed, and said: “How de\r\nwurl did you know dar was ennything else? Bless my life, suh, but de\r\nvery look ob er white man am er search warrant to de nigger’s soul. Ef\r\nyou bleegter hab it, heah it am,” he said, as he looked slyly around: “I\r\nhadn’t been married to dat ’oman but two years befo’ I had to run fur er\r\noffis, too.\r\n\r\n“What office?” I asked.\r\n\r\nHe grinned sheepishly.\r\n\r\n“Patriark ob de Santerfercashun,” he said, “I beat Unk Peter fur dat\r\noffis, an’ got eben wid ’im at his own game.\r\n\r\n“Lemme tell you, chile,” he added, impressively, “two years ob\r\nkonsolashun frum er widder will make a dead man or a Patriark outen\r\n’most ennybody,” and he resumed his sawing with a vigor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Concerning Littleness\r\n\r\n\r\n_Let not the littleness of people disturb you.

A silver-white mustache set off his\r\ncheery-looking, full, round face, and something in his eyes told me he\r\nwasn’t at all struck on formality and would not mind talking to a\r\nstranger, to pass away an hour or two in a sleeping-car. [Sidenote: An\r\nUnfinished Race.] I noticed, too, that his left sleeve had no arm in it,\r\nand then that he had on a G. A. R. button.\r\n\r\n“That old fellow is all right,” I said to myself, “and I’ll bet he left\r\nthat arm down in Tennessee. There are a dozen good yarns tucked away\r\nunder that derby hat that have never yet seen the color of white paper,\r\nand I am going to get one of them. I should say that he fought from\r\nShiloh to Chickamauga and from Chattanooga to Nashville, and made a good\r\none, too, or else he wouldn’t have left that arm in the enemy’s\r\ncountry.” “He fought the war out,” I said, after I had studied his\r\ncountenance more closely and noticed the big bump of benignity that made\r\nup his back head and ended in kind, mild countenance; “and after it was\r\nover he let it stay over, forgot all its meanness, inhumanity and\r\ncussedness generally, came on up here to Indiana and went into business,\r\nattended strictly to it, and is now a well-to-do business man.”\r\n\r\nSatisfied that my diagnosis was correct, I went over, and taking a seat\r\nby him, began to slyly get in my net for the fish I knew was there.\r\n\r\n“From Middle Tennessee, you say?” he said after awhile. “Well, I guess I\r\nknow every foot of it, nearly.” He laughed. “Under a little black locust\r\ntree near Murfreesboro is what is left of this,” he said, as he touched\r\nhis empty coat sleeve. “I have often wanted to go back there and see\r\nsome of those pretty farms and good horses and bluegrass hills when I\r\ndidn’t have any guard duty to do and wasn’t looking for an enemy, but\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\nI cordially invited him to come, and mentioned how many of the veterans\r\ncome down every now and then to go over the battlefields of the South.\r\n\r\n“Is that long, wooden, covered bridge still spanning Duck River at\r\nColumbia?” he asked quickly, as if suddenly remembering all about it.\r\n“That old bridge has got a history,” he continued. “I was with Buell\r\nwhen we got orders that we were to unite our army with Grant’s somewhere\r\nin the neighborhood of Pittsburg Landing, on the Tennessee. When we\r\nreached Columbia the river was up and the bridge was partially\r\ndestroyed, and all the flooring burned. I was one of the engineers and\r\nhad to repair the bridge. Word had come that we were needed badly, and\r\nwe worked day and night. Then word came that we were needed worse, and\r\nby hard dint I got the army over, and on we rushed for Pittsburg\r\nLanding. We got there almost too late. Grant’s army was nearly ruined.\r\nJohnston had driven it from Shiloh Church to the river bank, a distance\r\nof five or six miles, and only our arrival that night, bringing in the\r\nthirty or thirty-five thousand of Buell’s army, saved Grant. On what\r\nsmall things do great destinies hang!” he mused. “A loss of a day at\r\nColumbia would have changed the history of this country, and General\r\nGrant, instead of having been President, would have been one more of our\r\nunsuccessful generals.\r\n\r\n“But the funniest experience I had in Tennessee was at a little place in\r\nMarshall County, almost at the extreme edge of our army’s position. It\r\nwas after the battle of Shiloh, when the main army was at Nashville and\r\nour outposts went as far south as Pulaski. Do you all still raise pacing\r\nhorses down there?”\r\n\r\nI looked around to see if anybody was near enough to understand the\r\nhumor of such a question, but seeing none, and no sign of a joke on the\r\nold gentleman’s face, I kept my face straight as I answered him that we\r\nstill raised a few.\r\n\r\n“I was always fond of a good saddle horse,” he went on, “and many of the\r\nboys in our company of cavalry were of the same way of thinking. In\r\nfact, we had picked up a whole company of them down there, and I’m\r\nafraid we did not take the trouble to issue any Government warrants for\r\nthem either,” he laughed. “So when we went into camp in this village of\r\nMarshall County we had a company of as fine horses as any cavalry\r\ncompany ever bestrode. Time went a little heavy on our hands, until one\r\nday some of the boys got up a bet on the speed of their respective\r\nhorses, and a quarter race was run that evening at which the entire\r\ncompany turned out. It was won by a little roan horse that could pace\r\nnearly as fast as he could run, which was saying a good deal, for he\r\ncould run for a quarter of a mile about as fast as anything I ever saw\r\non four legs. Well, he won, and two days afterward beat two others, and\r\na week after that beat everything they could rake and scrape up against\r\nhim. All this was hugely interesting and immensely exciting, and as none\r\nof us had ever heard anything of the presence of the rebel cavalry\r\nleader and reckless raider, General Forrest, and never dreamed of the\r\ndanger we were in, I am sorry to say that we were more interested in\r\nhorse-racing just then than anything else. The owner of the horse called\r\nthe little roan pacer and runner “Mack,” in honor of General MacPherson,\r\nwho commanded some of us at Shiloh. Well, after Mack had beaten\r\neverything running, it was announced in camp one day that Mack’s match\r\nat pacing had been captured a few days before, and a big pacing race was\r\nto come off that evening to decide it. I had never seen a pacing race\r\nunder saddle, and with all the others I went out to see it. You can\r\nimagine what asses we were when we left everything in camp, even our\r\nside arms, in care of a few sentinels and camp followers, and all of us\r\nadjourned to an old field about a quarter of a mile to see the sport.\r\nThe track was a half-mile, laid off on a nice country road, the judges\r\nstanding at the end of the half mile and the start was at the beginning.\r\nIt is needless to say that every man in the company was at the end of\r\nthe track where the judges were. The horses were nearly equal favorites,\r\nand we soon had to appoint a man to hold the bets. He had his hands\r\nfull, for every man in the company had something upon the race, and the\r\ngoose hung high—and we were the goose,” he laughed.\r\n\r\n“There were to be three heats. An Indiana man rode Mack, and an Ohio man\r\nrode the other horse. Down the lane they came on the first heat, and all\r\nof us strained our necks to see who led. In forty yards of the wire, so\r\nto speak, Mack lost his head, concluded he was born for running and not\r\nfor pacing, broke out and ran away from his man. The judges gave the\r\nheat to the other horse. This made Mack’s friends mad, and after a good\r\ndeal of palavering the heat was declared off and everything started\r\nover. In this heat Mack got down to business and beat the other horse by\r\nthe nose. But in the next heat the other horse turned the tables on Mack\r\nand beat him a good length. I’ve seen a good many harness races in my\r\nday since then,” continued the old soldier, “but I never saw one that\r\ninterested me as much as that. Everything was excitement, and the boys\r\nwere betting everything they had, from hardtacks to dollars. When they\r\nturned up the road to come down for the third heat, we could easily see\r\nthem from where we were, as the beginning of the track was slightly\r\nelevated. They turned ’round to come, when all at once I saw both horses\r\nstop, their riders looking intently toward the camp, which was behind us\r\nand could be seen by them from their slight elevation. In another\r\ninstant they started, but not our way. They gave one wild shout, bolted\r\nthe fence on the side of the road and lit out across the fields,\r\naccording to our notion, like two fools. Before we had time to imagine\r\nwhat was up, we heard some shouts and shots in camp, some wild galloping\r\nand yells our way, and we turned ’round only to rush into the arms of a\r\ndetachment, some five-hundred strong, of Forrest’s Cavalry. If there\r\never were a cheap set, we were the boys. We made no bones of\r\nsurrendering, for we hadn’t a dog’s show and were glad to get off with\r\nour clothes.\r\n\r\n“‘What in h—— are you Yanks doin’ down here, anyway?’ asked their\r\nleader, a big fellow with a Colonel’s gray uniform on. When the\r\nsituation was explained to him he laughed like a big schoolboy. ‘Where\r\nis the stakeholder?’ he asked. When this gentleman was pointed out he\r\nhollered out: ‘Fetch them stakes over here, sonny, and tell the judges\r\nall bets are declared off on this race’! And the way the Johnnies\r\nlaughed racked us more than being captured.\r\n\r\n“We soon learned the secret of the thing. Forrest had made one of his\r\ncharacteristic raids around Nashville, captured and burned our stores at\r\nGallatin and Murfreesboro, and was sweeping on towards Bragg’s army at\r\nTullahoma. In his sweep he simply scooped us up while we were down in\r\nthe woods of Marshall County, running a pumpkin fair, a goose show and a\r\npacing meeting. But he was in a big hurry himself, for nearly all of\r\nBuell’s cavalry were after him. He had no time to do anything but take\r\nall we had, including our horses, the gate receipts and the book money\r\nand parole us and push on. But he never got Mack and the other horse,\r\nand to this day I have always wished that he had waited five minutes\r\nlonger. I’d give ten dollars now,” he added, “to know whether Mack or\r\nthe other horse would have won that last heat. But we never knew, for we\r\nwere soon forced to the front again; forgot all about our paroles, for\r\nwe never did think we were fairly captured, and I never saw Mack or his\r\nrider again. I stayed the war out, but I never went to see any more\r\npacing races in the enemy’s country,” he laughed.\r\n\r\n“Well, come down this fall and see some in the country of friends,” I\r\nsaid. We shook hands and parted.\r\n\r\n                                                               TROTWOOD.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe poem below goes the rounds of the press every year signed with the\r\nname of Gen. Albert Pike. In fact, such is the general belief, and all\r\nthe books in which I have seen this poem printed fall into this error.\r\n[Sidenote: The Old Canoe.] But though General Pike wrote some very\r\nbeautiful poems, he did not write this one. We have his own admission\r\nmade to Senator Carmack, the distinguished senior Senator from\r\nTennessee. Like many other good poems, it was, perhaps, the only one\r\nsome poet wrote, and, never thinking it would be immortal, or that it\r\nhad any special merit, failed to sign his name to it.\r\n\r\nIt is a little curious how this poem became identified with General\r\nPike. But we learn how it was from an old citizen of Columbia, Tenn.,\r\nwho knew General Pike when he was a young man and lived here. Pike\r\npracticed law there when he first started out in life, but met with poor\r\nsuccess. Becoming despondent, he one night paid his hotel bill, went to\r\nthe river’s edge, got into an old canoe, and drifted down to\r\nWilliamsport, where he took the stage for Nashville. From there he went\r\nWest, where he became a successful lawyer and politician, and afterwards\r\nwrote a volume of poetry. Those poems in which he allowed himself to be\r\nnatural, such as “Every Year” and others, are very beautiful. But in his\r\nmost pretentious poem he seems to imitate Keats and Shelley, and so lost\r\nhis own individuality.\r\n\r\nAfter many years Pike came back to Columbia, a celebrated man. He was an\r\nardent Whig, and made a big speech in support of his principles. To\r\noffset his influence some ardent Democrat composed a doggerel called\r\n“The Old Canoe,” in which it was plainly intimated that Pike had left\r\nhere years before between two suns, and had not been too particular\r\nabout taking some one else’s canoe to get away in. This doggerel was\r\nsung around the streets until General Pike and his friends were\r\nexasperated beyond measure, ending in the sensitive poet’s leaving the\r\ntown. Of course, it was all a lie, and the old canoe was probably the\r\nproperty of no man, but it seems that then, as now, nothing was too mean\r\nfor one political party to say of another. This beautiful poem, “The Old\r\nCanoe,” coming out about that time, was attributed to General Pike, and\r\nits authorship has never before, perhaps, been publicly corrected. It is\r\nfound in the schoolbooks, and in books on elocution, as being by General\r\nPike, but Senator Carmack is our authority that General Pike himself\r\ntold him he did not write it.\r\n\r\n          Where the rocks are gray and the shore is steep,\r\n          And the waters below look dark and deep,\r\n          Where the rugged pine, in its lonely pride,\r\n          Leans gloomily over the murky tide,\r\n          Where the reeds and rushes are long and rank,\r\n          And the moss grows thick on the winding bank,\r\n          Where the shadow is heavy the whole day through,\r\n          There lies at its moorings the old canoe.\r\n\r\n          The useless paddles are idly dropped,\r\n          Like a seabird’s wings that the storm has lopped,\r\n          And crossed on the railing one o’er one\r\n          Like the folded hands when the work is done.\r\n          While busily back and forth between\r\n          The spider stretches his silvery sheen\r\n          And the solemn owl, with his dull “too-hoo”\r\n          Settles down on the side of the old canoe.\r\n\r\n          The stern half-sunk in the slimy wave\r\n          Rots slowly away in its living grave,\r\n          And the green moss creeps o’er its dull decay,\r\n          Hiding its moldering dust away.\r\n          Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb a flower\r\n          Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;\r\n          While many a blossom of loveliest hue\r\n          Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.\r\n\r\n          The current-less waters are dead and still,\r\n          But the light wind plays with the boat at will;\r\n          And lazily in and out again\r\n          It floats the length of the rusty chain.\r\n          Like the weary march of the hands of time,\r\n          That meet and part at the noontide chime;\r\n          And the shore is kissed at each turning anew,\r\n          By the dripping bow of the old canoe.\r\n\r\n          Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,\r\n          I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,\r\n          And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,\r\n          Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick,\r\n          And laughed as I leaned o’er the rocking side,\r\n          And looked below in the broken tide,\r\n          To see that the faces and boats were two,\r\n          That were mirrored back from the old canoe.\r\n\r\n          But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side,\r\n          And look below in the sluggish tide,\r\n          The face that I see there is graver grown,\r\n          And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,\r\n          And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings\r\n          Have grown familiar with sterner things.\r\n          But I love to think of the hours that sped\r\n          As I rocked where the whirls their white spray shed,\r\n          Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew\r\n          O’er the moldering stern of the old canoe.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe mule is such an ungainly animal that very few ladies are given over\r\nto admiring him. As for me, I’d rather see an old mule coming my way\r\nwhen I have the blues, than to see a long absent friend.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A Mule and a Proposal.]\r\n\r\nI know that is a broad assertion, but when you hear the why, I know you\r\nwill agree with me, and say as did a little negro, that “one end of him\r\nwas good.”\r\n\r\nWhen a little girl, I lived with my people on a handsome farm three\r\nmiles distant to the church we attended.\r\n\r\nCharley, my dear lord and master, lived only a mile from the church. You\r\nsee, Charley was the most bashful man around the neighborhood, and while\r\neveryone knew ages before he proposed, that he loved me, it begun to\r\nlook as though he would never gather courage enough to say so.\r\n\r\nNight after night he would call, and invariably told me “I was looking\r\nkind of pretty,” and after a dreadful silence, he would break out\r\nsuddenly, “I’m kind o’ stuck on you,” giving me such a start that I\r\nwould nearly jump out of my chair.\r\n\r\nBeyond that “I’m kind o’ stuck on you,” it seemed he would never get,\r\nand at last, growing desperate, one night I determined to use a little\r\nstrategy and screw his courage to the sticking point. So when he came,\r\nand discoursed a short time on the weather, the brightness of the moon,\r\nour sick neighbors and such like, I knew my time was near, and awaited\r\nnervously for the never-failing sentence, “I’m kind o’ stuck on you,”\r\nwhen I expected to say, “Oh, Charles, this is so sudden. I only thought\r\nyou liked me as a friend.” This I felt sure would do the work.\r\n\r\nAt last, clearing his throat, Charles made ready. Looking lovingly at\r\nme, he said, “May, I’m kind o’ stuck on you,” and before the blush had\r\nfairly mantled my cheeks, aye, before I had a chance to utter a sound,\r\nthe mean thing went on, “Oh, May, I forgot to tell you, we have a new\r\ncolt.”\r\n\r\nNever in my life did I feel more like strangling a man than I did that\r\nnight. I had to turn aside to hide my tears of disappointment, for you\r\nmust know that I really loved the dear fellow. He was not the least bit\r\nbashful with men, or even in the presence of old women. But when it came\r\nto girls, his conversation above speaks volumes.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday Charley had asked me if I would allow him to drive me home\r\nfrom church the following Sabbath. I was only too willing to say yes,\r\nhoping that something would happen to make him utter the much-desired\r\nwords. Oh, girls, you can better imagine my disappointment than I can\r\ndescribe it, when late Saturday afternoon my mother’s maiden sister\r\narrived, bag and baggage. I did not need to be told that I should be\r\nleft at home next morning, as the carriage would not accommodate all.\r\n\r\nI could not eat any supper and later brother Tom found me lying in my\r\nfavorite nook in the summer house, sobbing as though my heart would\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\nLittle by little he coaxed me into telling him the reason for my grief,\r\nand at last I told him of my promise to Charley.\r\n\r\nHe sat and thought for a long time, and then breaking out into a happy\r\nlaugh, he cried: “I have it, little Sis. When the others are gone, I’ll\r\nsaddle old Bob, and you can ride behind me until we get near the church,\r\nwhen we can get down and tie Bob in the woods and walk the rest of the\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nI felt many misgivings, I can tell you, about riding that mule, but as\r\nthis was the only chance of getting to church, I reluctantly assented.\r\nAccordingly, when the carriage drove down the driveway the next morning,\r\nI flew to my room to dress, while Tom went out to saddle Bob. We were\r\nsoon ready, and with Tom’s assistance I mounted behind him. The first\r\ntwo miles were soon covered, and feeling uncomfortable from the jolting\r\nI was getting, I begged Tom to get off and walk the rest of the way.\r\n\r\nAll at once Tom uttered a yell like a Comanche Indian, and never in the\r\nhistory of the world did a mule make better time than Bob did, getting\r\nnearer and nearer to church at each leap.\r\n\r\nHow I begged Tom to stop him and let me get off. But never a whit did\r\nBob slacken his speed, and I thought I would faint with horror as the\r\nchurch appeared through the woods.\r\n\r\nFaster and faster we came right up to the church door, and that mule\r\nbrayed longer and louder than he ever did before.\r\n\r\nDown I slid, and back on the home track I started as hard as I could\r\nrun. I had not gone far when a horse and buggy came up behind me and a\r\nmoment later I was sobbing on Charley’s breast.\r\n\r\nHe asked me to be his wife that day, and I have long since forgiven the\r\nmule, as he certainly brayed some courage into my Charles. Can you blame\r\nme for being an ardent admirer now of a mule?\r\n\r\n                                                   MAMIE TAYLOR GEISSON.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n               _Some men are natural born pall-bearers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Ole Cotton-Tail\r\n\r\n\r\n            De white man bil’d de big rock fence,\r\n              He’s boss of all de lan’,\r\n            He’s lord of all de fiel’s an’ woods,\r\n              He wuck me all he can.\r\n            He stays up in de big white house,\r\n              Long wid his cake an’ ale,\r\n            He nurver kno’s whut joy it am\r\n              To hunt ole cotton-tail.\r\n\r\n            Whut keer I if dat fence am ruint,\r\n              Whut keer I fer de cost?\r\n            Ef I don’t make a hole down dar\r\n              Dat cotton-tail am lost.\r\n            Den I go sneakin’ home ter night\r\n              An’ ketch it, widout fail:\r\n            “Ole man, huccum you sneak in heah\r\n              Widout dat cotton-tail?”\r\n\r\n            So watch dar, boy, upon dat fence,\r\n              (You, Juno, watch dat crack!)\r\n            An’ ef you see Marse John come out\r\n              Jes’ drap down in yo’ track.\r\n            I’ll git a stick an’ twist in dar—\r\n              You’ll heah dat rabbit’s wail—\r\n            Whut’s rock an’ stone—dey can’t be e’t,\r\n              Lak good ole cotton-tail.\r\n\r\n                                                  OLE WASH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Historic Highways of the South.\r\n                         THIRD PAPER—NASHVILLE\r\n\r\n                         BY JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE\r\n\r\n\r\nNo road is so typical of the Middle Basin as that lying between Franklin\r\nand Nashville. For ten miles it winds around in the lowland basins or\r\nover the intervening ridges, amid fields as fertile as ever yielded\r\ntheir increase to the husbandman’s plow. On each side the low hill\r\nranges lie, blue or brown, as the sun happens to fall on them. Fertile\r\nto their very tops are these hills, green in grain or grasses, or darker\r\ngreen in richer foliage. In this the Middle Basin, through which for\r\nnearly a hundred miles from Nashville to Pulaski, this historic road\r\nruns, the country is different from any in the South. Sea shells lie on\r\nthe tops of the hills—sea shells rich in lime and phosphorus. Every foot\r\nof this road is rich in history and tradition. Down it rode Jackson,\r\ntime and again, from his home at The Hermitage, not many miles away.\r\nHere, also, rode Polk and Grundy and Sam Houston and Crockett. An old\r\nman told me a story about James K. Polk which I have never seen in\r\nprint. He said that in the memorable campaign for the governorship of\r\nTennessee between James K. Polk and Lean Jimmie Jones, in 1840 (in which\r\ncampaign it is said that Jones, who was the greatest stump orator of his\r\nday, and the father of that style of oratory, almost drove the statesman\r\nPolk from the hustings), there was a mutual agreement between the\r\ncandidates that Polk should speak at Franklin and Jones at Columbia, in\r\nthe wind-up, the day before the election. Columbia was Polk’s home, and\r\nnot very solid for him at that. The friends of Polk devised a scheme to\r\ngive him the advantage by making two speeches in a day. So he made his\r\nspeech early in Franklin and had saddled and ready a thoroughbred horse,\r\nwhich he mounted after his speech, and galloped to Spring Hill. There he\r\ntook a fresh horse and rode furiously to Columbia, arriving in time to\r\nreply to Jones’ speech. But my informant, who was an old line Whig,\r\ninformed me that though the future President made record-breaking time\r\nin his race down the pike, he lost in votes when it became known that he\r\nhad broken his agreement and played a trick on Lean Jimmie. Jones\r\ndefeated him for governor.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest of all the history made on this pike was made by the\r\ntwo armies of Hood and Schofield, as they swept over it in the early\r\ndays of December, 1864, and then swept back again. The situations were\r\nexactly reversed, making a wave of war which ebbed and flowed, carrying\r\non its crest the foam of wounds and death and woe. Continuing the story\r\nfrom Hood’s invasion from our last issue, Schofield’s army reached\r\nNashville after the battle of Franklin, early in the morning of December\r\n1, 1864, and there united with Thomas. Other detachments had been called\r\nin, including Gen. A. J. Smith, aggregating nearly 12,000 men, and later\r\nSteedman, with 5,200 more. Milroy and Granger, with 8,000 troops, were\r\nordered to Murfreesboro, and placed under the command of General\r\nRousseau. According to General Cox (The March to the Sea—Franklin and\r\nNashville. Jacob D. Cox, page 100), General Thomas had in Nashville on\r\nthe morning of November 30, 26,200 men. To these add Schofield’s army of\r\n34,000 men, and it will be seen at a glance what Hood’s disheartened and\r\nstricken army had to fight, and Thomas, a Virginian, in command, with\r\nthe bulldog tenacity of Grant and the courage of Hood.\r\n\r\nIf Franklin had been desperate, what could Hood do now, with the heart\r\nof them dead in his brave men, with sorrow in their hearts for comrades\r\nwho slept in trenches under the sod of Franklin, and beloved commanders\r\nwho, now being dust, were but a week before pictured forever between the\r\nsky and the bastions of steel as they rode over the breastworks to\r\ndeath? Even in the heart of the starved and the hardened lives\r\nmemory—and what memory must have been theirs in the sleet and cold of\r\nthose bitter December nights, while waiting for Thomas to come forth\r\nfrom his warmth and food to give battle. If Franklin had been a\r\ndesperate case, was not this worse—the combined forces of Thomas and\r\nSchofield, Smith and Steedman? Anyone but Hood would have stopped and\r\nthought, but Hood never thought.\r\n\r\n“In truth,” says Cox, in the history already quoted, “Hood’s situation\r\nwas a very difficult one, and to go forward or to go back was almost\r\nequally unpromising. He followed his natural bent, therefore, which\r\nalways favored the appearance, at least, of aggression, and he marched\r\nafter Schofield to Nashville.” Hood put Lee’s corps in the center across\r\nthe Franklin turnpike; Cheatham took the right, and Stewart the left of\r\nthe line, while Forrest, with his cavalry, occupied the country between\r\nStewart and the river below Nashville.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  General Van Dorn’s headquarters, near Spring Hill, where General Van\r\n    Dorn was shot to death by one Dr. Peters for an alleged familiarity\r\n    with the latter’s wife. Peters walked friendly into Van Dorn’s\r\n    office, obtained a pass from the General to go through the line,\r\n    shot him, jumped on a horse and escaped to the Federal line.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHere, from the first days of December until the 15th, much of the time\r\nin sleet and rain, Hood’s half starved veterans awaited the oncoming of\r\nThomas’ well fed and well seasoned troops. Such a meeting could scarcely\r\nbe termed a battle, however bravely the long, thin lines might hold out,\r\nand however desperately they might fight. Hood grimly made two stands,\r\nbut his gray lines, outflanked and outfought, melted away into a\r\ndisorganized rush, back through mud and slush and freezing rain to the\r\nTennessee. And now, back again, over the same highway, rush the two\r\narmies. Truly this historic highway was baptized in blood. The weather\r\nwas cold now, sleeting. When it thawed there was slush, and when it\r\nfroze, needles of ice for bare and bloody feet. No army since Valley\r\nForge suffered as did Hood’s brave men. Truly, the men who could follow\r\nHood back to the Tennessee, in the biting cold and hunger of those days,\r\nin the numbness which knows that all was lost, and the sorrow for those\r\nwho marched no more, truly, the stock of that kind who fought it to a\r\nfinish, might well survive that their heroic tribe might be given as a\r\nfuture pledge for the perpetuity of the Republic.\r\n\r\nTwo things alone saved Hood from annihilation: The lack of real\r\ngeneralship in his pursuers, who failed to push their advantage to a\r\nfinish, and the intrepid genius of Forrest, who covered Hood’s retreat.\r\nHad Johnston got Sherman, had Lee got McClellan in the fix Hood was now\r\nin, the map of the Union would be painted to-day in two colors.\r\n\r\nOf Forrest’s skill in saving Hood’s army, General Cox pays tribute in\r\nthe following paragraph, when he says: “At Columbia, Forrest rejoined\r\nHood, and his cavalry, with an infantry rear guard, under command of\r\nGeneral Walthall, covered the retreat to the Tennessee.... This force\r\nwas able to present so strong a front that ... our advance guard was not\r\nable to break through.” But the freezing, pitiless retreat of a brave,\r\nbroken army, who had gone into this Pike of Battles fit to fight for a\r\nkingdom, who had done more than any similar body of men had ever done\r\nbefore, in facing snow and sleet and hunger and bastions of steel and\r\nthe entrenched thousands of a well-fed city’s troops, and now went out\r\nunder the fatal inefficiency of him who led them, is one of the great\r\ntragic stories of the Lost Cause.\r\n\r\nForever will this historic highway run between sloping hills and sinking\r\nvalleys, from the Basin’s Rim to the Tennessee; forever will it girdle\r\nwith protecting arms the swelling glories of its maiden hills. The\r\nsentinel rows of corn land, the massed squadrons of wheat, forever will\r\nfollow the line of its march, helmeted in tassle-caps, sheathed in\r\nscabbard sheafs, with meshes of gold and gilt, while from the forts of\r\nits over-towering hills orchards of apples will drop their balls of gold\r\nwhere once contending cannon hurled theirs of steel. Forever and\r\nforever, a tribute and a lesson to all time that brother no more shall\r\nkill brother in the dawning glory of a new age and a new Union. But\r\nnever again will it see the equal of that desperate courage, that\r\nsacrifice for conscience, that valor for home and country as each saw\r\nit, as shown by these two armies which swept north and south in glory\r\nand in gloom.\r\n\r\nTrotwood does not like to end anything in gloom and sorrow, and so will\r\nend this sketch of this historical highway with some cavalry yarns he\r\nhas picked up from the old survivors of this and other battles.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, at a Confederate reunion, he found himself among a\r\ngroup of interesting talkers—men who had been makers of history in this\r\ngreat struggle. All of them have now joined their comrades who had gone\r\nbefore—and right worthily they went, as their life’s record will show.\r\nAmong that number was Gen. W. H. Jackson, the owner of Belle Meade, then\r\nthe most famous thoroughbred nursery in America. [Sidenote: Some Cavalry\r\nYarns.] On his left was the State’s chief executive, Governor Turney, or\r\n“Old Pete,” as the big brained and big framed fellow under the slouch\r\nhat was familiarly called by every schoolboy in the State. Other\r\ncongenial spirits were around, high in social and political circles,\r\ndrawn by the annual reunion of Confederate veterans. Some war yarns had\r\npassed around and General Jackson, who was a brilliant cavalry leader\r\nhimself, was explaining how efficient the cavalry service was. The\r\nGeneral himself fought through the war and thought that the best horses\r\nin the world for cavalry purposes were those with a good dash of\r\nthoroughbred in them. Jackson himself rode thoroughbreds all through the\r\nwar. So did Fitz-Hugh Lee, of Virginia; John H. Morgan, the famous\r\nraider, and many others.\r\n\r\n“I remember the time I longed for one mighty bad,” quietly remarked an\r\nAlabama colonel present, as he knocked the ashes off his cigar and\r\nsmiled at the turn the story was taking. “It was around Vicksburg, in\r\nthe trenches, and Grant was crowding us day and night. We lived on raw\r\nbeef and such dogs as happened to stray out of the city, and were\r\nbegrimed, dirty, half starved and homesick. Right next to us in the\r\ntrenches was a Tennessee company, whose captain always managed to ride\r\naround on a black thoroughbred horse, as handsome a creature as you ever\r\nsaw, and which he kept slick and fat and curried always—though the Lord\r\nonly knows where he got his rations from. I watched that fellow and soon\r\ncaught onto his game. Every time the Yankees would crowd us pretty\r\nclose, and it looked as if we would have to surrender anyhow in the\r\nteeth of such overwhelming numbers, this fellow’s horse would get\r\nfrightened and, in spite of all his owner’s endeavors, would break away\r\nwith him to the rear. One day the fight got terribly hot, our lines were\r\ncut nearly in two, they swarmed over the breastworks, it was a\r\nhand-to-hand fight. To add to the demoralization, here came this captain\r\non his black horse, going to the rear by the lines like wild, pulling\r\nlike Hercules on his horse’s mouth to stop him, and shouting back as he\r\nflew along:\r\n\r\n“‘Gentlemen, I can’t stop him—he is running away!’\r\n\r\n“‘Hould on, Captain,’ shouted an Irishman in our line, as he jumped up\r\nand waved his cap at the horse and rider, ‘Hould on! I’ll give you a\r\nthousan’ dollars to tell me where I can get another one of that breed of\r\nhorses that you can’t hould when he starts to the rear.’\r\n\r\n“The Yankees took the shout of laughter that followed Pat’s exclamation\r\nfor the Rebel yell and we got a breathing spell at our end of the line\r\nfor a couple of hours.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Nashville and Columbia pike in front of the Cheairs’ place, near\r\n    Spring Hill, where the battle would have been fought had not Hood’s\r\n    plans miscarried.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“That reminds me of Sam Watkins,” said a gentleman present. “The same\r\nSam that wrote that inimitable book on the war called “Company H”—the\r\nbest book I ever read on the war, for it came nearer to painting it in\r\nits true, horrible colors than any of them. Sam tells the story as he\r\nwent through it, from the standpoint of a common soldier, and the motto\r\nof his volume seems to have been General Sherman’s laconic remark that\r\n“War is hell.” If the young idiots ever get up a notion to fight again,\r\nSam Watkins’ ‘Company H’ will do more to stop them than anything I know\r\nof. Anyway, just before the Battle of Shiloh Sam found himself mounted\r\non the stubbornest mule that ever went to war. He would charge Grant’s\r\nwhole army when the bugle sounded retreat, and would proceed to fall\r\nprecipitately back when there wasn’t an enemy in a hundred miles. On the\r\nfirst day at Shiloh, when Johnston’s army was rushing over everything\r\nbefore night, and Buell came, Sam’s mule suddenly decided to retreat—and\r\nretreat he did, much to Sam’s mortification and disgust. As he went back\r\nfull tilt he ran over a gun with four horses attached and before he\r\nrecovered from the shock of the collision to know which way his rear end\r\nwas, Sam tied a rope to his neck and the other end of the rope to the\r\ncaisson’s axle, and having mounted again he got the artilleryman to\r\nliterally haul his muleship into battle. The fight was nearly over when\r\nthey finally got to the front, and, General Johnston being killed,\r\nBeauregard had ordered a cessation of hostilities till morning. But it\r\nsuddenly dawned on Sam’s mule that he was expected to charge, and no\r\nsooner was he released than he straightened his neck, and before his\r\nrider could dismount, straightened his tail, brayed once and charged\r\nGrant’s whole army, penned up on the banks of the Tennessee River, and\r\nmadder than a gored bull in a fence corner. Sam’s captain didn’t\r\nunderstand the mule’s maneuvers, and as he went by shouted to his men:\r\n\r\n“‘Look at brave Sam Watkins, boys, charging right in the cannon’s\r\nmouth.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Martin Place, near Spring Hill, Tennessee, one of the finest farms\r\n    in the State, formerly the Gibson Farm, and the first home of Tom\r\n    Hal in Maury County; also historically associated with Hood’s raid.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“‘It ain’t me chargin’, Captain,’ shouted poor Sam, as he pulled away\r\nwith all his might to keep out of certain death—‘it ain’t me. I ain’t\r\nsuch a fool as that. It’s this damned old mule! Whoa, Baalam, whoa!’\r\n\r\n“I don’t know how that is,” remarked a colonel who had seen hard service\r\non foot, “but I do know that we infantry fellows had a holy contempt of\r\nall cavalrymen. At the Battle of Murfreesboro I was badly wounded in the\r\nleg and arm, and for days I could scarcely walk. As I was hobbling back\r\nto the rear on the third day after the fight, I met my brother mounted.\r\nAs soon as he saw my condition he got down, helped me up on his horse\r\nand told me how to ride out to find the hospital surgeon. Now, in our\r\nbrigade, we had a standing reward of a thousand dollars for anybody who\r\nwould show us a dead cavalryman. I had forgotten all about this when all\r\nat once I rode into a Texas regiment camping and fixing for supper. My\r\narm was in a sling, and from my drooping position it was plain I was\r\nwounded. As soon as they saw me one of them yelled out:\r\n\r\n“‘Run here, boys, run quick, and see the curiosity of the century. Here\r\nis a wounded cavalryman!’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Lane of the Lost Opportunity, near Spring Hill, Tennessee, where\r\n    Hood came so near cutting off Schofield.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“And before I could get on they had surrounded me and proceeded to make\r\nlife a greater burden. In vain I tried to explain; as far as I went I\r\nheard only one yell:\r\n\r\n“‘Look at the wonder of the century! Here is a real wounded cavalryman.\r\nSonny, how in the world did you ever get that close to a bullet?’ and so\r\non. I got off of that horse as soon as I could and never tried to play\r\ncavalry again during the war.”\r\n\r\n“I think it pretty well established,” remarked General Jackson, “that\r\nthe greatest cavalry leader of the Confederacy was Gen. N. B. Forrest.\r\nHis career was a curious one, as illustrating the heights to which a\r\nnatural genius, uneducated though it may be, can go in its chosen path.\r\nHe had twenty-nine horses, in all, killed under him during the war, and\r\nyet came out unhurt save when a minie ball one day ploughed through his\r\nstirrup and the sole of his boot. After the war, in which he rose to be\r\na lieutenant-general, his fame as a cavalry leader had spread so far\r\nthat during the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon III sent a distinguished\r\nmilitary tribunal over here to get General Forrest’s mode of fighting\r\ncavalry. On their way to Memphis they stopped over at Belle Meade to\r\ninspect my stud, and as I had seen a good deal of service with Forrest I\r\nwas telling them of some of his ways of fighting cavalry. Only one of\r\nthem could speak English, and I remember how the other two laughed as I\r\ntold their interpreter how Forrest escaped annihilation by pure\r\naudacity, on Hood’s retreat out of Tennessee, of whose army his cavalry\r\ncovered the retreat. Forrest’s cavalry was really mounted infantry, and\r\nhe had in it also two of the deadliest batteries in the Civil War. On\r\nHood’s retreat he saved the army by planting his batteries and checking\r\nthe Federal advance—then, when they came in overpowering numbers he\r\nwould fall back to another natural hill breastwork and check them again,\r\nwhile Hood was trying to get over Duck River. But one time he came near\r\nbeing annihilated. He held his ground too long when suddenly an officer\r\ndashed up and shouted:\r\n\r\n“‘General! General, we are ruined! The enemy is in our rear. We will\r\nhave to surrender! What shall we do?’\r\n\r\n“‘Do? Do?’ shouted Forrest, as he cursed the officer for a\r\nchicken-hearted coward. ‘Is that all you know about war? What will I do?\r\nIn my rear, are they? Well, I’ll just about face and then I’ll be in\r\nthem, won’t I?’ And he did, capturing more prisoners than he could take\r\ninto the Tennessee River with him. The French committee were highly\r\namused, and said such a course would never have been thought of in\r\nEuropean warfare. I afterwards learned that the only information they\r\ngot from Forrest on their visit was his now historic answer to their\r\nquestion as to what was his rule of warfare, to which he answered,\r\n‘There ain’t but one rule—I always tried to git thar fust with the most\r\nmen.’ Now, the thoroughbred horse is the best horse in Tennessee to ’git\r\nthar fust’ on,’” laughed the general, “unless it is one of Trotwood’s\r\npacers,” he said, as he winked my way, “and the only reason they are fit\r\nfor anything is because they are built on the best kind of thoroughbred\r\nlines, as he has admitted time and again.”\r\n\r\n“I remember a laughable incident on Hood’s retreat at a small creek\r\nbetween Nashville and Columbia,” said another old soldier present. “It\r\nwas early morning, cold and sleety. We had waded the creek, but had to\r\ngo back to help pull the artillery over. As we came out of the mud and\r\nwater, a long line of us tugging at a gun, a lank, solemn soldier walked\r\nup on the bank, drew himself up with great dignity, and in a sepulchral\r\nvoice said: “Fellow citizens!”\r\n\r\nInstantly every man stopped and listened for some important\r\nannouncement.\r\n\r\n“Fellow citizens,” went on the man, in a deep, earnest tone, “aftah much\r\nreflection an’ mature deliberation, I have decided that South Carolina\r\nwas a little too hasty.”\r\n\r\nHe was so solemn and earnest that he was greeted with a big laugh and\r\nshout.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  [Note—Under this heading, in a near issue, will be the illustrated\r\n  story of the Old Nachez Trace and the story of the death of\r\n  Meriwether Lewis.—Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A Famous Horse Race\r\n\r\n                         BY BEN MCCULLOCH HORD\r\n\r\n  [The incidents in connection with this great race, so graphically\r\n  described by the writer, were given him by an old turfman who at\r\n  that time was a young jockey and witnessed the race.—Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I speak, there were a number of famous horses on\r\nthe turf, necessarily producing much rivalry between their various\r\nowners and friends. The most prominent that I can call to memory now\r\nwere Boston, Duane, Decatur, Vashti, Balie Peyton, Fannie Wyatt, Charles\r\nCarter, Lady Clifton, Clarion, etc. Boston was just beginning to win the\r\nfame that afterward made his name a household word throughout the racing\r\nworld, and nearly all of the best horses of the day sought to measure\r\nstrides with this distinguished son of Timoleon. In the language of an\r\nold turfman, they were laying for him. At this time Boston belonged to\r\nMr. Nat Reeves, of Richmond, Va., and after Decatur had defeated Fannie\r\nWyatt in a four-mile heat race at Washington, D. C., Mr. James Long, a\r\ngreat admirer of Boston, and a close friend of Mr. Reeves, proposed to\r\nCaptain Heath, the owner of Decatur, to match Boston against him,\r\nfour-mile heats, for a purse of $10,000, to be run at Camden, N. J.,\r\nprovided that he could get the use of Boston for the race. The match was\r\naccepted and $1,000 forfeit put up. Mr. Long went over to Long Island,\r\nwhere Mr. Reeves had Boston attending the spring meeting, and made known\r\nhis match, which was agreed to. Decatur was at Washington, while Duane\r\nand Charles Carter, both in the same stable, were gathering turf laurels\r\nat other places. Boston had never gone four miles up to this time, and\r\nthere were many prominent turfmen who doubted his ability and courage to\r\nnegotiate this distance in good company, consequently as soon as the\r\nmatch between him and Decatur became known it made the latter largely\r\nthe choice in the betting, he having recently defeated that good mare,\r\nFannie Wyatt, in the four-mile race above referred to.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Reeves and Long, however, were not slow in finding out Boston’s\r\ncourage—they were already satisfied as to his speed—so they gave him a\r\ntrial, which was entirely satisfactory, he having defeated in this trial\r\nhis stable companion, the celebrated Atlanta, 108 times the length of\r\nMr. Long’s walking stick, a novel way, certainly, to measure distance,\r\nbut it was certainly done in this case, and in those days horses were\r\ntried with horses, and not by the watch, as now.\r\n\r\nJust before the match came off, the Boston party concluded not to run,\r\nbut to pay forfeit, which they did. Their idea was that they could bet\r\ntheir money to better advantage in the four-mile purse race, which was\r\nto come off in a day or two, and in which both horses would enter,\r\nknowing that Decatur would be largely the favorite in the betting, and\r\neven more so, as they had paid forfeit to him. On the day of the race\r\nthe track was quite heavy. This also lengthened the odds on Decatur. But\r\nBoston won, after a close contest, and largely enriched his friends. He\r\nwas now considered the champion racer of America, and he was sent over\r\nto Long Island to attend the second spring meeting, to come off in a few\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Duane and Charles Carter had been winning fame and most\r\nof the large purses in Maryland and Virginia, under the management of\r\nthat shrewd and competent horseman, Billy McCargo. They were now turned\r\ntoward the metropolis, with a view to catching this new champion at Long\r\nIsland and taking a measure of his courage and speed. McCargo thought\r\neither of his horses was better than Decatur, and as good, if not\r\nbetter, than Boston. At Long Island he decided to make his first battle\r\non Boston with Charles Carter, the lesser light of the two stars of the\r\nturf. The horses came together in a four-mile purse race, and for the\r\ncharacter of the soil and condition of the track, it was the most\r\nfiercely-contested four-mile dash I ever saw. The first three miles were\r\nrun in 5:36, the fastest, notwithstanding the poor condition of the\r\ntrack, ever made up to that time. As they passed out on the fourth mile\r\nthe horses were going like a matched team, and the contest appeared in\r\ngreat doubt, but on the back side Boston began to draw away and won\r\neasily by half a dozen lengths, and when Carter came in it was seen that\r\nhe was broken down and had run his last race.\r\n\r\nBoston and his friends now crossed over to Hoboken, followed by McCargo,\r\nwith Duane. Over the new race course on Beacon Heights it was decided\r\nthat Duane should give the champion a beating or the race of his life.\r\nMcCargo had managed his fight on Boston with consummate skill. He had\r\nselected the weaker of his two horses, Charles Carter, to make the first\r\nassault, and it was evident from the terrific fight he had made over the\r\nLong Island track that he hoped, even if he could not win with Carter,\r\nto at least run Boston such a race that he could beat him with Duane on\r\nBeacon Heights. Therefore they were quite sanguine of victory and freely\r\ntook all bets offered.\r\n\r\nBeacon Heights was a new course just opened near New York, easy of\r\naccess, and costing only a trifle to get from the city there and to see\r\nthe race. Excitement was intense over the coming race between these two\r\nfamous Southern champions, both sons of Virginia, and I am confident\r\nthat a hundred thousand people witnessed the race. They came from every\r\nsection of the United States, and all classes were represented. Mr. Van\r\nBuren, who was then President, and all of his Cabinet occupied a\r\nconspicuous place in the grandstand, as did also nearly all of the\r\nforeign legations, who were out in full force. The beauty and chivalry\r\nof the nation had assembled to witness what was expected and what proved\r\nto be the greatest horse race that ever occurred in this or any other\r\ncountry. The great sea of humanity was kept in the best of humor by\r\nlively music from a number of bands, the most noted being the United\r\nStates Marine Band, which had been sent out in honor of the assembled\r\ndignitaries.\r\n\r\nIn those days there was but little betting done until the day of the\r\nrace, and most generally not until the horses were on the track. On this\r\noccasion Commodore Stockdon, who, besides being a Commodore in our navy\r\nwas also a true sportsman and a prominent breeder and importer of\r\nthoroughbreds, and who owned and raced some prominent horses of the day,\r\nproposed on the evening before the race to Mr. Pringle, the most noted\r\nsporting man of that day, in Washington, that he would bet him $5,000 on\r\nDuane, provided he liked the looks of the horse the next day. The bet\r\nwas promptly taken, and the next day when the horses were brought out,\r\nafter carefully inspecting Duane, the Commodore told Pringle it was “a\r\ngo.” This settled it. No money passed, and rarely ever did with big\r\nbettors. In those days men’s words were sufficient. What a striking\r\ndifference between then and now! Here a Commodore in the navy bets\r\n$5,000 with a noted gambler, with nothing more than the word “go”\r\nbetween them, and yet either would have sold the clothes off his back\r\nrather than to crawfish out of the bet, or in any way defraud the other.\r\nThis even bet seemed to make the mark for others to go by, and the money\r\nwent on even up, and by the cartload in sums from fifty to five and ten\r\nthousand dollars a side. As a rule the Southern contingent backed Duane,\r\nwhile the New Yorkers piled their wealth on Boston. McCargo’s mulatto\r\nboy, Steve, who had ridden Carter against Boston, at Long Island, was\r\nnow up on Duane to make another desperate effort to down the champion,\r\nwhile Cornelius, Boston’s old rider, a negro boy who belonged to Mr.\r\nReeves, the owner of the horse, was in the pigskin on his favorite.\r\n\r\nAfter having gone through the racing season, running from two to four\r\nmile heat races every week, the two horses, as they stepped out on the\r\ntrack, looked like two gamecocks made of whalebone and steel. Every\r\nmuscle and sinew stood out as if carved by an artist’s chisel, while\r\ntheir glossy coats, bright eyes and light, springy step indicated that\r\nboth were on edge and ready to run for a king’s ransom or a woman’s\r\nlove. Boston was a red sorrel, about fifteen hands three inches high,\r\nboth hind ankles white and a white strip on his face that broadened out\r\nover the nose; hence the nickname of “Old White Nose” afterward given to\r\nhim by his friends. He was a horse of immense driving power, but so very\r\nsymmetrical in his proportions and so evenly balanced that it was only\r\nnoticeable in the eyes of a critic. As he moved about under Cornelius\r\nquietly, but with a supple, catlike step, bearing lightly on the\r\nsnaffle, with his red coat gleaming in the sunshine like burnished gold,\r\nhe was as beautiful and grand-looking a specimen of race horse as ever\r\ngladdened the eyes of a turfman. Duane, the son of imported Hedgford,\r\nwas the counterpart of Boston in every respect, except in color and\r\nmarkings. He was a dark brown, almost black, with tan muzzle and flanks.\r\nWhile Boston’s coat shone like gold, Duane looked like polished bronze.\r\nHe had no marks, except a small spot of white in his forehead that shone\r\nlike a diamond, and as he was led out on the course by his old negro\r\ntrainer, Lazarus, with yellow Steve in the saddle, followed by their\r\nmanager, Billy McCargo, they presented a picture that will live forever\r\nin the memory of every turfman who saw them. Gilpatrick, the most\r\ndistinguished jockey of his day, afterwards the rider of Boston in all\r\nof his races, and who rode Lexington in his memorable race against time,\r\nand I, both young riders then and fast friends, pooled our hard-earned\r\nwages, amounting to $13, and bet it all on Boston, and with beating\r\nhearts we worked our way through the crowd and took position under the\r\nwire directly opposite the judges. Hon. John C. Stevens, one of New\r\nYork’s most prominent citizens, an accomplished gentleman and the most\r\ncompetent starter of his day, was in the stand and ordered out the\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              First Heat.\r\n\r\nAt the tap of the drum the battle began. Duane was first on his stride\r\nand showed the way around the turn. Here Boston made a run and shortly\r\nafter entering the stretch was on even terms with him. Head and head\r\nthey passed the stand. A mighty shout went up from the vast crowd and as\r\nthey started on the second mile you could hear, “$500 on Duane!” “A\r\n$1,000 on Boston!” “Watch him run him out!” “Stay with him, old white\r\nnose!” and a thousand other such exclamations from the friends of each.\r\nRounding the lower turn, Duane having the track, Cornelius took a slight\r\npull on Boston, but on entering the back stretch he made a run and at\r\nthe half they were nearly lapped. Rounding the upper turn, however,\r\nDuane shook him off. Another shout from the backers of Duane and more\r\nmoney goes up. Entering the stretch the game son of Timoleon makes\r\nanother run at his flying antagonist, and, although he closes up the\r\nspace, he can only get on Duane’s hip, and in this order, head and hip,\r\nthey pass the stand and swing around the turn. Cornelius is content to\r\nhold this position until he enters the back stretch, when he again calls\r\non Boston; slowly but surely the red coat of Boston inches up and at the\r\nhalf is hid behind Duane. So even are they running that it looks like\r\none horse and one rider; in this position they ran around the upper\r\nturn, down the home stretch and enter the fourth mile as even as a\r\ncarriage team with the deafening shouts of the multitude following them.\r\nRounding the lower turn Steve for the first time takes a pull on Duane,\r\nevidently with a view of saving him for the finish; Cornelius on Boston\r\nmoves to the front, intending to take the track, but Steve has no idea\r\nof giving up this advantage, and he keeps Duane moving just close enough\r\nto keep Boston on the outside. In this position they race to the head of\r\nthe stretch. Here Steve begins to make a run; down the stretch they\r\ncome, hip and head, but in spite of all Cornelius’ efforts and in spite\r\nof the long, tireless strides of Boston, the brown son of Hedgford\r\noverhauls him when half-way down the stretch, but it has taken the last\r\nremnant of his reserve power to do this, and head to head, leap for\r\nleap, they strain their hardened muscles. A child’s blanket would have\r\ncovered them. Both riders were rolling in their saddles from exhaustion,\r\nbut were lifting and urging all they could. Boston had been running\r\npurely on his courage. Cornelius had neither whip nor spur. Steve had on\r\nspurs that had more than once in the finish drawn the claret from Duane.\r\n“A dead heat!” “A dead heat!” shout the crowd. No. One more stride with\r\na savage dig that sent the rowels home in the quivering flanks of his\r\nhorse and at the same time lifting his head Steve sends Duane under the\r\nwire a winner by a scant head, in 7:52.\r\n\r\nRemarkable time for a new track filled with roots and sprouts. Both\r\nhorses showed distress when the boys returned to weigh out. It had been\r\na battle between giants, and their heaving flanks gave evidence of the\r\ngreat physical strain they had undergone, but the same gamecock look\r\nflashed from their eyes, showing that while the flesh might be weak\r\ntheir courage could never die. The riders were scarcely less distressed.\r\nSteve, the rider of Duane, fainted when taken down, and Cornelius was in\r\nbut little better condition. So popular was the victory of Duane that\r\nMr. Wm. Friend, of Virginia, bought him before the next heat was called,\r\npaying his owner $12,000 for him.\r\n\r\nAlthough he had lost a heat Boston’s friends asked and received no odds,\r\nbut still covered Duane money, even up.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Second Heat.\r\n\r\nWhen the horses were called for the second heat they came up looking\r\nwell. Both had cooled out admirably. Johnny Hartman, a white jockey, and\r\none of the best riders on the turf, was upon Duane, Steve not being able\r\nto resume his mount. Up to this time Boston had never been marked by\r\nwhip or spur, except in his first race, when he sulked when touched with\r\na spur. He had won all of his races running purely on his courage. Col.\r\nWm. R. Johnson, the “Napoleon of the Turf,” who was managing him in this\r\nrace, procured a cowhide, and when he mounted Cornelius gave it to him\r\nwith instructions to use it if necessary from start to finish. There was\r\nno delay at the post; the drum tapped, and they were off, followed by\r\nthe continuous cheers of the crowd. I doubt if a more closely contested\r\nmatch for four miles was ever run over any course than was waged between\r\nthese two great horses in this second heat. It was literally a fight to\r\nthe death. With every muscle strained, every sinew drawn to its utmost\r\ntension, they raced head for head the entire distance. Duane was on the\r\ninside and held it to the finish, although Boston made repeated efforts\r\nin every mile to take it. It was drive, drive, drive; death or victory.\r\nFirst the head of gold striped with white would for a moment show in\r\nfront, then the head of bronze with the white spot gleaming like a star\r\nof hope would take the lead, but never more than a scant head would at\r\nany time divide them. As the head of either horse would show in front\r\ntheir respective friends would give a ringing cheer, but as mile after\r\nmile of the mighty contest was measured off by the long, low, powerful\r\nstrides of these great racers and the desperate character of the race\r\nbecame more and more apparent, the excitement became too intense for\r\nshouting, and as the horses turned into the stretch on the fourth mile\r\nfor the run home nose to nose, bit to bit and stride for stride a\r\nstillness as of death came over the crowd. Not a shout, not a word, not\r\na whisper was heard. The stable boys and rubbers with bated breath and\r\nbulging eyes stared with almost agonized expression on their faces up\r\nthe stretch where the desperate battle was being fought. The lemonade\r\nvender gave up all thoughts of trade, and even the wily pickpocket\r\nforgot his calling for the moment, and his hand, still clutching his\r\nill-gotten gains, trembled with excitement as he watched the flying\r\nstallions and heard the ceaseless patter of their hoof strokes.\r\n\r\nI was a young light-weight jockey then who had won his spurs in more\r\nthan one hotly-contested field, and to-day am perhaps the only living\r\nturfman who witnessed this great match, for nearly sixty years have\r\npassed since then; yet in memory’s mirror, I can see that fearful finish\r\nas distinctly as my young eyes saw it that day. I can see two horses\r\nhalf-way down the stretch coming as true and even as two arrows from one\r\nbow. I can see two outstretched necks and heads, a sorrel and a brown, a\r\nblaze and a star. I can see their powerful haunches gathered under them\r\nand drive them forward as if they were shot from the mouth of a cannon.\r\nI can see the hard-trained muscles playing beneath their thin skins like\r\noiled machinery, and as they come nearer and nearer I see their ears\r\nlying back and their bloodshot eyes gleaming with the light of the\r\nbattle and undying courage. I hear their labored breathing and can see\r\nthe red flush up their widely-distended nostrils glowing like heated\r\nfurnaces. I can see Johnny Hartman, pale as death, riding as if for his\r\nlife, drive the merciless steel again and again in the panting sides of\r\nDuane, and at each time the blood spurting from the wounds. I can see\r\nthe black face of Cornelius, drawn as if in mortal agony, his lips\r\nparted, his white teeth shining and his eyes fixed on the finishing\r\npoint only a few yards away. I can see him swing the cowhide, already\r\ncrimsoned with the royal blood of Boston, high over his head and bring\r\nit down on the quivering flank of his horse, then, quick as lightning,\r\nlift him with the bit. I can see the great son of Timoleon crouch lower\r\nto the ground, gather his powerful quarters further under him and make\r\nthe final rush just as Cornelius lifts him, and I can see the golden\r\nhead and white nose cross the wire in front of the bronze and the star.\r\nBoston wins, but only by a head. Then the pent-up excitement broke\r\nforth. “Boston wins!” “Boston wins!” was the shout. Yes, he had won, but\r\ncould he do so again? This was only a heat apiece. Another heat was\r\nnecessary to decide the race, and in the peerless brown stallion he had\r\nfound a foeman well worthy of his steel, and one that had shown him he\r\ncould take his measure in any part of the four miles. Both horses had\r\nbeen fearfully punished and were dreadfully distressed, and so were the\r\nriders. Of the two latter Hartman was much the freshest, for after\r\nweighing out Cornelius had to be rubbed out, drenched with brandy and\r\naltogether requiring almost as much attention as his horse. But he would\r\nhave died in the saddle rather than have relinquished his mount, and\r\nwhen they were called for the last heat he came out with his bloody\r\nwhip, looking as determined as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Third Heat.\r\n\r\nGilpatrick and I took our old position under the wire, with many\r\nmisgivings as to the fate of our combined fortunes, the $13 that hung\r\nupon the result of this heat. For the first time Boston began to show\r\nthe ugly side of his disposition by sulking. As they were led up to\r\nstart he repeatedly refused to go, and when the drum was finally tapped,\r\nhaving the inside, he bolted toward the fence. Cornelius pulled him out,\r\nand then he ran diagonally across the track towards the outside. In the\r\nmeantime Hartman was sending the dead game son of Hedgford, along, and\r\nby the time Cornelius got Boston straight and on his stride the\r\nmagnificent brown had taken the track and was running smoothly more than\r\nfifty yards in front. These positions were maintained until they reached\r\nthe head of the stretch. Here Boston showed another peculiar trait in\r\nhis disposition, and one for which he afterwards became noted, the\r\nshouting of a crowd seemed to inspire him and make him run faster. As\r\nthey turned into the stretch with Duane so far in advance his friends\r\nbegan to cheer. The sound no sooner reached Boston’s ears than he began\r\nof his own accord to make a run at Duane, and so rapidly did he run down\r\nthe stretch that when they passed under the wire he was only two open\r\nlengths away. Going around the lower turn both riders eased up their\r\nhorses, but on entering the back stretch Cornelius made a run with\r\nBoston at Duane and at the half mile had closed out all the daylight\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nBut rounding the upper turn Duane shook him off and entered the stretch\r\nan open length and a half in front. Again a great shout went up from the\r\nbackers of the peerless brown stallion as they saw his move, and again\r\nas the sound reached Boston it seemed to lend him wings. Running true\r\nand straight as a bullet flies, without touch of whip, the whitefaced\r\nson of Timoleon began to devour the space that separated him from his\r\nantagonist, and as they passed the stand at the end of the second mile\r\nhis white nose was at Duane’s hip. Going around the lower turn the boys\r\nagain took easy pulls on their horses, and in this position they go up\r\nthe stretch and around the upper turn, Boston holding his place with the\r\ntenacity of a bull dog. But the white star of Duane is still in front as\r\nthey swing into the stretch, and again his backers greet him with a\r\ncheer and again “old white nose” takes the compliment to himself and\r\npromptly, in response, he quickens his stride and again reaches Duane.\r\nHalf-way down the stretch he collars him, and as they pass the stand his\r\nwhite nose is in front for the first time since starting on this last\r\nheat. It was now the time for Boston’s friends to cheer, and if\r\npandemonium had broken loose more noise could not have been made. Men\r\nwere simply wild with excitement. They danced about like children; hats,\r\ncoats and canes were thrown into the air. Gilpatrick and I hugged each\r\nother and shouted ourselves hoarse, and, as the horses rounded the lower\r\nturn, the shouting increased, as it was seen that Boston, inspired by\r\nthe shouting, no doubt, had kept up his killing stride and had taken the\r\ntrack from Duane. But to experienced riders like Gil and I this sudden\r\nchange in position was rather a source of uneasiness. We both knew\r\nHartman well. He was every inch a rider and a cool and skillful\r\nhorseman, and we could see that he had taken a strong pull on his horse,\r\nsaving him for the terrific finish he knew was yet to come. Knowing from\r\nour own experience in the saddle what was coming we paid no attention to\r\nthe over-sanguine friends of Boston shouting: “Duane has quit!” “Duane\r\nhas quit!” We knew the horse and we knew the rider, and we also knew\r\nthat a race for life was coming and our fortunes were on the issue. So\r\nwe anxiously watched them as they raced nose and tail, with Boston\r\nleading up the back side and around the upper turn.\r\n\r\nJust before entering the stretch for home Hartman began to move on\r\nDuane. “He’s coming!” “He’s coming!” Gil whispered, for he was too\r\nexcited to speak, and we both stood speechless watching the fierce\r\nbattle that was opening a quarter of a mile away. Cornelius rides Boston\r\na little wide on turning in the stretch in order that his whip hand\r\nmight be free to drive. Hartman sees the opening thus made next the rail\r\nand rushes Duane in it. It was skillful riding on both sides. Hartman\r\nhad no whip, but rode with spurs, while Cornelius had no spurs, for\r\nBoston would not stand them, but rode with a whip, and if Hartman in a\r\ntight finish could get so close to Cornelius on his whip side as to\r\nprevent him from using the lash he would have a big advantage. This\r\nCornelius prevented by riding a little out on the turn. The spurt of\r\nDuane was greeted with the old-time cheer of his backers. “He comes! he\r\ncomes!” “See him come!” went up from the throats of thousands, but it\r\nceased almost as suddenly as it began, for the red horse is coming with\r\nhim, and at that moment not a hand’s breadth divides them. But Hartman’s\r\njudgment in saving his horse now begins to tell, and inch by inch the\r\nbrown stud begins to slowly but surely draw away. First a nose, then a\r\nhead, then a neck and shoulders he pushes to the front. Hartman’s knee\r\nis at Boston’s head. Duane is a half length in front and only an eighth\r\nof a mile to run. Can he hold? Cornelius shifts both reins to his left\r\nhand, the cat-gut whirls above his head and falls upon the flank of\r\nBoston, cutting the thin skin of the thoroughbred like a knife. Maddened\r\nwith pain and his own desire to win Boston bites savagely at Duane, but\r\ncatches Hartman’s trousers at the knee and nearly tears them off of the\r\njockey. Cornelius pulls him loose, lifts his head, straightens him and\r\nagain the cruel rawhide tastes his blood. Responding to the lash with\r\nunfaltering courage, with the shouts of “Duane,” “Duane,” “Duane wins!”\r\nringing in his ears, the great horse with almost human instinct seems to\r\nknow that the supreme moment has come, as he puts forth the last vital\r\nounce of strength that yet lingers in his powerful muscles and begins to\r\ndraw up on Duane. Each weary leap brings him nearer and nearer the head\r\nof the gallant brown, whose last rush at the head of the stretch is now\r\nbeginning to tell upon him. Only fifty feet from the wire and they are\r\nnose and nose. Horses and riders were rolling from side to side, all\r\nutterly exhausted. Still, with outstretched necks, distended nostrils\r\nand eyes yet flaming with passion, the fierce contest goes on as they\r\nliterally stagger towards the finish, for the pace is now nothing more\r\nthan a hard gallop. Cornelius is reeling from exhaustion in his saddle,\r\nbut with a last effort he partially lifts the drooping head of Boston,\r\ncuts him with the whip and—the race is over! Boston wins! But so dead\r\ntired are both horses that Boston, although the winner, actually stopped\r\ndirectly under the wire, and Duane walked under it.\r\n\r\nFortune has been kind to me since then and given me many of her most\r\nchoice blessings, but never in her most liberal moods has she given me\r\nanything that I appreciated more than the smile she gave me that hot day\r\non Beacon Heights nearly sixty years ago, when, watching this greatest\r\nof all the great races I have ever seen, she doubled my humble fortune.\r\n\r\nThe reason so little has ever been said or written about this race is\r\nowing to the fact that it was not a match or stake or section race, but\r\nsimply a purse race of four mile heats, in which two of the most noted\r\nhorses in America met. I helped to carry Boston home after the race. We\r\nwent through by land, and so completely exhausted was the horse that he\r\nwould frequently fall and we would have to assist him to his feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            With Our Writers\r\n\r\n\r\n“A merry heart doeth good like a medicine.”\r\n\r\nAs a rule, traveling salesmen manage to extract and radiate as much joy\r\nand mirth as any class of citizens that I know of. But even these genial\r\nspirits have their own sorrows.\r\n\r\nA drummer was sent by his house, shortly after his marriage, on a long\r\ntrip to the Pacific coast. Some time after his departure the young wife\r\nwas seized with appendicitis, was hurried off to a hospital, operated\r\non, and recovered all right. The strain, both mental and financial, had\r\nbeen great, but she was well again. Joe had remitted by check for\r\nsurgeon’s fee, special nurse, hospital charges, and a few other items\r\namounting to a hundred or so, and his spirits were just beginning to\r\nrise again as he worked towards Los Angeles, where mail from home would\r\nawait him.\r\n\r\nThe “gang” from the 9:10 train hurried up to the office of the\r\n“Link-Schmidt.” The night clerk handed each his quota of these\r\never-welcome missives.\r\n\r\nIn the reading room Joe was seen to turn deathly pale. Several at once\r\napproached. “What’s matter, old boy?” “Bad news from home?” “Anything\r\nout of whack?” and kindred interrogatories were fired at him from all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nSome griefs are too poignant for expression. Carefully folding back the\r\nfirst and last parts of a page, Joe exhibited, without comment, only\r\nthis paragraph of its perfumed surface: “I am not feeling as well,\r\ndearest, as when I wrote you at Pasadena. Sallie is coming over\r\nto-morrow and we are going to have our kimonos cut out.”\r\n\r\nReader number one passed it down the line. Silence, that was stifling,\r\nsettled over the group. Then, moved by a common impulse, a solemn\r\nprocession filed out and lined up before a rosewood counter, in front of\r\nwhich ran a massive gilt rail. “Martini,” “Black and White High Ball,”\r\n“Wilson,” “Same.” In the land of the high ball a poet once sang:\r\n\r\n               “Inspiring, bold John Barleycorn!\r\n               What dangers thou can make us scorn!\r\n               Wi’ tu’penny we fear nae evil;\r\n               Wi’ whiskey straight we’d face the divil.”\r\n\r\nIt was so in this instance. Joe came to first. “Ain’t that ——” (from the\r\nyoungest in the bunch). “Say, Joe, the repair bills of you married men\r\nmust be something fierce.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come on, boys, let’s go to supper.”\r\n\r\n                                                                H. K. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Mr. Wallace Mistaken.\r\n\r\n Editor Trotwood’s:\r\n\r\nI have read with much interest your history of that remarkable family of\r\npacers. If the Hal family of pacers can’t produce world’s\r\nrecord-breaking trotters, the theory that extreme trotting speed comes\r\nfrom the pacer, or originated from the pacing gait, must go to the wall.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace was certainly misinformed when he was told that the dam of\r\nVermont Black Hawk was a pacer. I hunted up the man who had charge of\r\nher for upwards of eight years, and he assured me that the dam of\r\nVermont Black Hawk was as square gaited a trotter as he ever saw, and\r\nthat she never paced a step during all the time she was owned in the\r\nTwombly family. This man was Mr. Shadrak Seavey, a grandson of Ezekiel\r\nTwombly, and men who knew him personally assured me that no man’s\r\nreputation for strict veracity was superior to that of Mr. Seavey.\r\nHorsemen who knew this mare agreed unanimously with Mr. Seavey in\r\ndescribing her color, size, conformation and gait.\r\n\r\nThe man who misled Mr. Wallace got on the track of the wrong mare. He\r\nwas the same man (Allen W. Thompson, of Woodstock, Vt.) who strenuously\r\ncontended that Vermont Black Hawk was by Paddy, and Ethan Allen 2:25½\r\nwas by Adams’ Flying Morgan, in spite of the fact that the stud book of\r\nSherman Morgan showed that the dam of Vermont Black Hawk was mated with\r\nhim May 14, 1832, and I learned from Mr. Seavey that Black Hawk was\r\nfoaled about the middle of April, 1833.\r\n\r\nThe stud service book of Vermont Black Hawk shows that the Holcomb mare,\r\ndam of Ethan Allen, was mated with Black Hawk July 9, 1848. It is a\r\nmatter of history that Ethan Allen was foaled June 18, 1849. These facts\r\nwere known to Thompson, but because Ethan Allen was bay in color,\r\nThompson was sure there must have been some mistake. He did not succeed\r\nin winning Mr. Wallace on that point, but touched a responsive chord\r\nwhen he hit upon the pacing mare as the dam of Vermont Black Hawk.\r\n\r\nI read your Monthly Sundays, when, I suppose, I should be at church.

That such may\r\nbe the case is my sincere wish.\r\n\r\nPardon me for the length of this epistle. I won’t do it again.

PARLIN.\r\n\r\n Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            As to Football.\r\n\r\n Editor Trotwood’s:\r\n\r\nIn college and university circles, during the year 1905, one of the\r\nvital questions receiving its share of attention was, as some one has\r\naptly phrased it, “Is football to be mended or ended?” This and similar\r\nquestions open the subject for discussion, in the progress of which a\r\nnumber of very caustic criticisms have been leveled at the game by the\r\npresidents of some of our great universities and colleges and members of\r\ntheir respective faculties. The president of Columbia University, the\r\nfirst to abolish the game, recently declared that football as now played\r\nis no longer a sport, but a profession, and, like other professions,\r\ndemands prolonged training, complete absorption of time and thought, and\r\nis inconsistent, in practice, at least, with the devotion to work which\r\nis the first duty of college and university students. He also calls\r\nattention to the “figure” “gate receipts” cuts in the conduct of the\r\ngame, which, says he, “marks the game as in no small degree a commercial\r\nenterprise.” President Wheeler of the University of California, brings\r\nhis indictment against the promoters of the modern game for “having\r\nchanged the gridiron into a multiplication table,” and otherwise\r\ntampering with it, until to-day “American intercollegiate football has\r\nbecome a spectacle, and not a sport.” The president of the College of\r\nthe City of New York reviews the evolution of football, and makes a\r\nstrong plea for a return to the game of earlier times, “when football\r\nwas rather primitive; few practice hours, few out-of-town games; no\r\ntraining table; no excuse from regular university work, and the boys led\r\na normal student life.” However, whatever may be the opinion of certain\r\nscholastic dignitaries, and however incompetent the “rank outsider” may\r\nbe to judge the game, a reasonable survey of the situation reveals the\r\nfact that public opinion, the most powerful factor with which we have to\r\ndeal, is now concentrating its forces preparatory to “bucking the\r\ncentre” of the game as played, or, with the “flying wedge” of reform,\r\ndash through its lines and destroy the dangerous features of the “mass\r\nplay.”\r\n\r\nThat there should be provision for physical culture in the course of\r\nevery educational institution is, of course, universally conceded, but\r\nthe question now up for solution is, what character of exercise, or what\r\nsystem of physical development will come nearer meeting the demand for\r\nsuch training. The champions of the great American game answer,\r\n“football.” And yet, when we consider the question in the light of all\r\nits pros and cons—and, like all other questions, it has its pros and\r\ncons—its three sides—i. e., your side, the other side, and the inside—we\r\nare led to believe that it specializes athletic sports to such a degree\r\nas to exclude the student body from participation in them. The\r\nsystematic development of the physique was first given a pre-eminent\r\nplace in the training and discipline of young men by the ancient Greeks,\r\nwho sought in this way to perpetuate a hardy and vigorous manhood among\r\ntheir people. The origin of the Greek games is mythical, yet we know\r\nthat they were revived in 776 by the king of Elia and Lycurgus, the\r\nSpartan lawgiver, as a means by which intestine commotions might be\r\npacified and a pestilence which at that time plagued the people, stayed.\r\nFoot racing, wrestling, leaping, quoit and javelin throwing, and, in\r\ntime, chariot racing were the chief sports with which they developed the\r\nphysical manhood of the nation. And in this connection, but a moment’s\r\nreflection is required to suggest the benefits derived from such a\r\nvariety of sports and diversity of exercise. Contrast the sports of the\r\nGreek game with the exclusive feature of football as played in the\r\ncolleges to-day. A college president writes of his institution: “In the\r\nten years from 1892 to 1902, only seventy-five different men made the\r\nteam as players and substitutes out of four thousand or more different\r\nmale students during that time in attendance.” But this is an age of\r\n“specialists,” therefore we will let that pass, and there yet remains\r\nthe gravest possible objections to the “mass” game. It cannot be denied\r\nwith any show of fairness, that its present tendency is to discredit\r\nscholarship and put brains at a discount, while it inflates and\r\nexaggerates the intrinsic value of beef and bone. The primary object of\r\neducation is to discipline and develop all the faculties and endowments\r\nof heart and head, while the maxim, “a sound mind in a sound body,” is\r\nby no means to be despised, and yet the hero of the gridiron, the idol\r\nof the college or university, might be a young man of mediocre ability,\r\nor with no brains at all, and with less character than brains. Then,\r\nagain, the exaggerated importance which the average student attaches to\r\nthe more brutal features of the game creates a false standard of courage\r\nand manhood, and demands ferocious tests that are unfair as the price of\r\nits vindication. False standards of anything in life are, especially to\r\nthe young, always perilous, and of nothing is this more than of false\r\nconceptions of what constitutes real courage. For instance, it is a\r\nnotorious fact that in the hour of actual battle soldiers who, in “the\r\npiping times of peace,” were renowned fist-fighters and bullies, and\r\ngenerally looked upon as “bold, bad men,” have, when the thunder of\r\ncannon and the rattle of musketry broke upon their ears, failed to stand\r\nthe test of courage, and disgracefully and ignominiously fled, seeking\r\nsafety in precipitate flight, while other men, supposed to be physical\r\ncowards, walked calmly and dutifully, and with unwavering step, on\r\nthrough the storm of grape and shell into the very jaws of death. We are\r\nreminded, in this connection, that the “dunghill” fights splendidly with\r\nhis “natural heels,” but it takes a game cock to stand the test of\r\n“steel.” Ought our young men to be educated in an atmosphere in which\r\nsuch base estimates of true courage and manliness must become the very\r\nbreath of their nostrils? Should a young man of culture, courage,\r\nrefinement and a high sense of honor be subjected to the humiliation of\r\nbeing accounted a “cad” by his fellow students because he does not\r\nhappen to aspire to “make good” on the team or approve the game? Such a\r\nyoung man may be a swift runner, a good rider, and a well trained\r\ngymnast, but there is no field for his physical development if he does\r\nnot “make good,” and though he be manly, straightforward and proficient\r\nin his work, he has no show with the students with the commonest,\r\nvulgarest and most ill-bred youth imaginable, provided that “darling of\r\nthe gods” happens to weigh enough and have enough of the bulldog and\r\ntiger in him. Is it any wonder that the brutality of the game, with all\r\nits barbarisms and degrading tendencies, has at last awakened the\r\nsleeping giant of public opinion, who now threatens to destroy it? And\r\nwhat complicates the situation more are the revelations that from time\r\nto time have been made, fixing the crime of dishonesty and insincerity\r\nupon some of the faculties of schools and colleges, who have taken\r\ndevious and questionable ways and methods to violate their sworn\r\nagreements with rival institutions, and persistently play professionals\r\nas students. But the foxy methods of such schools and colleges have most\r\nnaturally tended to disintegrate the student conscience and re-acted\r\nupon their faculties so as to do either one of two things—i. e., cause\r\nthe faculty to forfeit the confidence of the better class of students,\r\nor train the student to feel that there is no wrong in dissembling,\r\ncheating or lying where the success of the team is at stake, as well as\r\nthe reputation of their college as a leader in athletic sports.\r\n\r\nSuch a state of affairs most naturally has aroused the interest of those\r\nwho are jealous and zealous for the welfare of the colleges and\r\nuniversities and individual students, and the tide of public opinion has\r\ngradually been swelling until now it threatens the utter destruction of\r\nthe game. But will the students themselves come to the rescue and save\r\nthe game while there is yet time, by agreeing to an honest, clean\r\nabolition of the objectionable features of the game? For, in the last\r\nanalysis of the situation, it is “up to them.”\r\n\r\n                                                       WALTER B.

They\r\nhave served their purpose, and are no longer needed. They are millstones\r\naround the neck of twentieth century progress. To the uninitiated it may\r\nbe necessary to explain that these laws make it possible to use as\r\ncollateral for a loan things not yet in existence. It is a mortgage on\r\nair, sunshine, rain and prospects. The renter of a small farm goes, say\r\nin January, to a village merchant, states how much land he will plant,\r\nwhat he expects the total yield will be and the merchant then agrees to\r\nadvance him, from time to time, supplies of all kinds—food, clothing,\r\nimplements, and so on, up to an agreed upon amount. For this amount the\r\nmerchant takes a lien or mortgage upon the prospective crop.\r\n\r\nThe cotton crop is not planted until April or May, so that a goodly part\r\nof the supplies are consumed before a seed is in the ground.\r\n\r\nThe wreck and ruin of a four years’ war left little besides the land of\r\nthe South, and the enactment of these laws was an expedient adopted to\r\nmeet an emergency. The necessity for them has long since passed, leaving\r\nthe laws on the statute books. They have not been repealed because\r\npoliticians are afraid of the poor man’s vote. They lack that\r\nindependence that would do what is best for him over his protest. That\r\nsuch laws encourage idleness, dependence, thriftlessness and\r\nimprovidence among those who most need to practice their opposites is\r\nwell illustrated by the following actual occurrence.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon last August a friend of mine came upon a white renter\r\nsitting on the bank of Saluda river fishing. During the conversation my\r\nfriend expressed the hope that the long drought might be broken by a\r\nshower, whereupon the fisherman replied: “Yes, my melon patch needs hit\r\npowerful bad, but I’ve drawed about all I kin git on my cotton patch\r\nanyway, and I don’t care whether a drap falls on hit or not.”\r\n\r\n                                                                H.

By limiting the amount which each bank may\r\nbe permitted to use, restricting the large banks to half a million, and\r\npermitting all the small ones to issue to the extent of their capital\r\nstock, Mr. Brownlow’s plan most effectually keeps it out of the hands of\r\nspeculators.

If it is going to give us a lot of syndicate, ready-made\r\ngoods, it had better go to New York, where the facilities for that kind\r\nof publication are the best. So continue to give us a Trotwood’s\r\nMonthly, and not a feeble imitation of some Northern magazine, and I\r\nthink you will be supported.”\r\n\r\nTrotwood appreciates the criticism above, from a scholar in one of the\r\nbest schools in the South. The more so because we do not claim any\r\nparticular credit for making Trotwood’s different. We are picturing\r\nnaturally the life around us—its songs, traditions and ideals. We could\r\nmake our Monthly twice as large by using syndicate matter. But it will\r\nadd nothing to the thought of the Monthly nor to its quality.\r\n\r\nHere are some good ones from a little book called “Philosophy of the\r\nStreet,” by E. R. Petherick, of Merrill, Wisconsin. There are hundreds\r\nmore in the book as good, and that is saying much:\r\n\r\nTwo people may differ and both be wrong.\r\n\r\nRidicule is a cross-eyed cousin of wit.\r\n\r\nMany of us devote too much energy to increasing our wants.\r\n\r\nIt is always easy to get a front place by facing the other way.\r\n\r\nThe man who has no secrets from his wife is a widower.\r\n\r\nCunning is the selfish side of wisdom.\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to remember that the present is constantly becoming\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\nThere is about as much sense in judging a man by his talk as there would\r\nbe in buying a dog by his bark.\r\n\r\nFew people know how to be good to themselves.\r\n\r\nAfter a man has received two favors in succession, he begins to consider\r\nthem part of his constitutional right.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“It may interest you to know,” writes Prof. Henry C.

And that\r\nreminds us of several bright things of children—neighbors of Trotwood—so\r\nbright that we thought once of sending them to the Ladies’ Home Journal,\r\nan awfully nice female paper published in Philadelphia, but we have\r\ndecided they are good enough for Trotwood’s:\r\n\r\nLittle Octavine had lived upstairs at grandmother’s all her short life\r\nof four summers, and objected often to walking up the steps. Recently\r\nher parents moved to Nashville. Everybody knows what a beautiful Union\r\nStation Nashville has, but what an abominably long flight of steps leads\r\nfrom the tracks up to the street. Little Octavine slowly and painfully\r\nclimbed them, and when she reached the top sighed and said, woefully:\r\n“Mamma, if you had told me Nashville was upstairs I never would have\r\nmoved here.”\r\n\r\nLittle Ethel, aged two, who can barely talk, saw for the first time the\r\nJersey cow chewing her cud the other day. Ethel watched her long and\r\neagerly, but the more she yearned the more indifferent the cow chewed\r\non. Finally she began to cry: “Mamma, make her let me—chew it—awhile!”\r\n\r\nHenry’s mother had been operated on for appendicitis. He didn’t know\r\nexactly, but supposed there was an awful rent somewhere. One day he came\r\nin in time to see the nurse giving his mother a glass of water. “Don’t\r\ndo that,” he shouted; “don’t do that! Don’t you know it will just run\r\nout of her?”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn reading some of the business letters on file in Trotwood’s the other\r\nday I came across a letter and its answer that made me catch my breath.\r\nWhen I reached the P. S. I had the same laugh that you will have—and as\r\na laugh is always worth money, I am passing it on to Trotwood’s readers.\r\nThe letter is from our friend, F. D. Hoogstraat, Ravenna, Mich., who,\r\nafter saying many kind things about us and enclosing check for five\r\nsubscribers to Trotwood’s, ends with the following friendly bit of fun:\r\n“I was out your way forty-odd years ago, and I killed as many of you as\r\nyou did of me, and I feel now that every thing is square and even\r\nbetween us.”\r\n\r\nI turned over the carbon copy containing the business manager’s reply,\r\nand this is what I read toward the latter part of the letter: “We will\r\nbe glad to have you come this way again, and we’ll promise to give you a\r\n‘warm reception,’ but not the kind we gave you before. The same Johnnies\r\nwho tried to kill you forty years ago with bullets will try it again\r\nwith kindness and moonshine whisky. They will charge you with a\r\nhandshake instead of a bayonet and will put you in the best bed instead\r\nof a prison. The people of the South look forward and not backward, and\r\nhave long ago forgotten and forgiven.\r\n\r\n                                              “Yours truly,\r\n                                                E.

A. Cunningham. For many years it has been the\r\n  official organ of our own great Association as well as of the United\r\n  Sons of Confederate Veterans, the United Daughters of the\r\n  Confederacy, and the Confederated Southern Memorial Association,\r\n  publishing the proceedings of their sessions, their work, and their\r\n  achievements. Thus it has been the medium through which all that\r\n  concerns the work of Confederate Associations can be so published\r\n  that their coöperation may be made effective. As a magazine devoted\r\n  to the objects of these Associations it is a secure repository of\r\n  war incidents, biography, reminiscence, history, and documents, and\r\n  is already a full treasury of Confederate data. It is very\r\n  gratifying that this ally of ours has attained a high position among\r\n  our country’s magazines. Its issue of 22,000 copies this month\r\n  proves its popularity and certifies its stability. _But your\r\n  committee believes that in consideration of its worth and of the\r\n  broad area of its circulation, South and North, it deserves the\r\n  united support of this body, and it would become of greater service\r\n  to us if all Camps and Chapters would adopt measures to double its\r\n  subscriptions._\r\n\r\n  COMMITTEE: CLEMENT A.
