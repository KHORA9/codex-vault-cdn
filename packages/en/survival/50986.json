Toward the end of the summer these desolate precipices are\r\nsnowless and except for a glimpse of white peaks through some pass there\r\nis scarcely a suggestion of the glacier region within. Then the train\r\nenters the “Gap” and before long the summits around show fields or\r\npatches of midsummer snow; and as one draws nearer to the heart of the\r\nRockies there is blue ice to be seen clinging to the cliffs or reaching\r\nas glaciers down into the wooded valleys, and one is thrilled with the\r\nwild charm of alpine scenery.\r\n\r\nHowever, engineers are strict utilitarians and always choose the lowest\r\npass for a railway, so that the passenger in the observation car catches\r\nonly tantalizing glimpses of the wonders and beauties of the ice world a\r\nfew miles away and a few thousand feet above the valley. One must stop\r\nat some place like lake Louise in the southern Rockies or Tête Jaune in\r\nthe north or Glacier in the Selkirks to come into real contact with snow\r\nfields and glaciers. What a joy it is to get rid of the hot and dusty\r\neveryday world of cities for a while and come close to Nature in one of\r\nher wildest moods! It is not only the mountaineer who feels the\r\nseduction of the cool, clean solitudes where glaciers are born and do\r\ntheir wonderful work. Every healthy manor woman must yield to the\r\ndelight of living in those inspiring surroundings.\r\n\r\nIt is worthwhile to put on warm strong clothes and hob-nailed shoes and\r\nfill your lungs with mountain air in a scramble up to the snow fields to\r\nsee how the glacial machinery works, machinery which some thousands of\r\nyears ago shaped almost the whole surface of Canada, doing its work on\r\nthe plains as well as the mountains and leaving it the splendid land of\r\nlakes and rivers and fertile prairies and rolling hills which it is\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Snowline._\r\n\r\nTo reach the snows generally means some miles of walking and climbing,\r\noften through forest covered slopes at first where the outside world is\r\nlost. Then the trees begin to thin and grow stunted, revealing between\r\nthe trunks blue valleys with a lake or two and far off cliffs and\r\nmountains. At last the trees cease at 7,500 feet and you are at\r\ntimberline. Here the three Rocky mountain heathers spread soft thick\r\ncarpets between stiff bushes only a few feet high but with trunks a foot\r\nthrough, so buffeted have they been by the storms of centuries. The rows\r\nof dwarfed spruces leaning back against some rock ledge give fine\r\nshelter for the mountain goats, wisps of whose white wool cling to the\r\nstubborn branches.\r\n\r\nThen come cliffs and rocky slopes and grassy or sedgy uplands (the true\r\nalps as the word is used in Switzerland) where mountain sheep or goats\r\npasture and wild flowers grow by the million, blue ones such as lupines,\r\ngentians, fox-gloves and forget-me-nots; yellow ones such as\r\nadder-tongues, columbines and a multitude of starry composite flowers;\r\nthe red or orange Indian paint brush; and white flowers innumerable. You\r\nhave reached the edge of the snow rapidly melting on a July day under a\r\nsun that is hot even on high mountains. The plants just freed from their\r\nwinter covering are all bursting into bloom together, bees are humming,\r\nbutterflies lazily flutter past and a humming bird poises over a\r\nblossom; for it is spring at these altitudes and there is a whole\r\nseason’s work to be done, seeds ripened and all, before autumn comes in\r\nSeptember with its snowstorms burying all under the white silence of a\r\nnine-months winter again.\r\n\r\nIt is a thrilling experience to set foot at last on midsummer snow\r\nsweeping upwards, gleaming toward the higher summits, snow that never\r\nentirely melts and that is so dazzling in the July sunlight that one\r\nneeds dark or colored glasses to avoid snow blindness if the tramp is to\r\nbe a long one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    GLACIER ON PRESIDENT RANGE, YOHO PARK\r\n\r\nWe have no special word in English for these perpetual snow fields and\r\nso the French term NÉVÉ is commonly used. Snowline is not nearly so\r\ndefinite as timberline and varies with latitude, exposure and snowfall.\r\nIn the eastern Rockies of Alberta, where only a few feet fall in winter,\r\nthe line is scarcely below 9,000 feet; while in the western Selkirks,\r\nwhich catch the full brunt of the Pacific winds laden with moisture and\r\nhave a snowfall of 40 or 50 feet in a year, snowline is depressed almost\r\nto timberline, about 7,500 feet. This accounts for the bareness of the\r\neastern Rockies as compared with the splendid Alpine features of the\r\nSelkirk range, which is the lower of the two.\r\n\r\nWhile one gazes entranced at the array of lakes and valleys, of\r\nsnowfields and dark cliffs, the wind rises and mountains to the west put\r\non a cap of cloud. This grows and darkens and presently a mantle of mist\r\nsweeps up with the wind, the sun is dimmed and in a few minutes the wide\r\nworld is shut out by a blizzard. We must make our way down to lower\r\nlevels where sleet whitens the closing flowers, and then through a belt\r\nof rain swept hillside into the valley where the sun may still be\r\nshining hotly.\r\n\r\nSince snow falls every month in the year on the névé fields and never\r\nmelts away one might expect the mountains, especially the Selkirks, to\r\ngrow as snowheaps into the sky; but of course this does not take place.\r\nUnder the increasing load of snow the lower beds are compressed into\r\nice; so that the névé, beginning as loose or hard drifted snow above\r\npasses downwards into ice banded with blue and white layers, the whole\r\nsometimes hundreds of feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nThe snow accumulates only on the gentler slopes or in the higher\r\nvalleys. On cliffs it cannot lodge but piles upon the névé beneath; and\r\non steep slopes it may lie for a time but now and then, especially\r\ntoward spring, it breaks loose and thunders down into the valley as an\r\navalanche.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Motion of Glaciers._\r\n\r\nThe final disposal of the snowfield, turned to ice in its lower parts,\r\ncomes by a slow creep downwards. That the névé is actually in motion can\r\nbe seen by following the slope of snow to its upper edge against some\r\nmountain wall where a “BERGSCHRUND” generally yawns between the\r\nsnowfield and the cliff. This may be several feet wide, and may go down\r\nmany feet to obscure depths. No amount of snow fall can fill the chasm\r\npermanently, though it may be bridged with fresh snow for a time, making\r\na risky passage for the climber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    CAVERN ON ILLECILLEWAET GLACIER\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    SNOUT OR FOREFOOT OF ROBSON GLACIER, JASPER PARK\r\n\r\nThe névé is always pulling away from the rocks at its upper border, and\r\nits general motion follows the direction of the lowest depression\r\nbeneath, finally extending below snowline as a tongue of ice which\r\nreaches down into the valley until it is melted by the increasing warmth\r\nof the lower levels. Thus a glacier is born. Unless whitened by recent\r\nstorms the glacier is bare of snow in summer with a rough uneven surface\r\nof a dirty blue green color, partly covered with rocky debris, and its\r\nvolume diminishes downward by thawing until at a definite point the\r\nwhole is melted and flows away as a river of water instead of ice. The\r\nlower end is sometimes called the “tongue” or “snout” or “foot” of the\r\nglacier—a bad case of mixed metaphors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    CREVASSE ON GREAT GLACIER\r\n\r\nRemembering that ice is a hard and brittle solid, it comes as a surprise\r\nto find that it can flow like a plastic body under the pull of gravity;\r\nbut this can be easily proved. A row of stakes or of metal plates put\r\nacross a glacier gradually gets out of line, the middle parts moving\r\nfastest as in a river; but the motion is very slow, even in the middle,\r\nseldom more than a few inches a day in our mountain glaciers, though\r\nsome of the great Alaskan and Greenland glaciers are reported to move\r\nseveral feet a day and in one or two cases as much as 60 or 70 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    MOULIN (IN MORNING BEFORE THAW BEGINS) ROBSON GLACIER\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    MORAINE OF VICTORIA GLACIER\r\n\r\nAt a sudden descent, where a river would leap as a waterfall, a glacier\r\nsimply breaks across in what are called “CREVASSES,” fissures which may\r\nbe several feet wide and hundreds of feet long, going down to blue black\r\ndepths appalling to the inexperienced climber. As the glacier advances\r\nthese crevasse are bent out of shape and may be crossed by fresh\r\ncrevasses, splitting up the ice into wild lumps and pinnacles called\r\n“SERACS.” Seen from a distance across some valley such an ice fall looks\r\nlike a cascade or a violent rapid covered with breakers. Below these\r\nsteep descents the crevasses and seracs disappear by the pressure of the\r\nmoving ice and the glacier becomes a solid mass again. Small glaciers\r\nhanging from cliffs may send down avalanches of ice which combine to\r\nmake a lower glacier, the masses being welded together once more. It is\r\nevident that one cause of glacier motion is the power which ice has to\r\nbreak and then to freeze together again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    GLACIER TABLE, NEAR TEN PEAKS, ROCKY MOUNTAINS PARK\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    LAKE AGNES, A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A CIRQUE LAKE\r\n\r\nSince glaciers are often the easiest way up a mountain, climbing parties\r\nmake use of them, starting at dawn so as to have a long day and\r\nfollowing up the rough and rigid slope, zigzagging round crevasses and\r\navoiding regions of seracs. Toward the upper end there may be fresh snow\r\nbridging the crevasses and the party should be roped together and travel\r\nin single file, the leading guide thrusting his ice axe into the snow at\r\nevery step to make sure of safe going. A fall into a crevasse when\r\nunroped may be fatal. Seventeen years ago, while climbing Mt. Gordon\r\nnorth of lake Louise, Mr. C. S. Thompson slipped 60 feet into a crevasse\r\nwhere he was wedged in between the narrowing walls. Dr. Collie was\r\nlowered to rescue him, and he was finally pulled out by a glacier rope\r\nfastened round his arms, but it was a narrow escape.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun shines warmly on the glacier melting begins and water\r\ntrickles down the ice ridges, and towards afternoon torrents of pale\r\nblue water are racing downwards in ice channels, here and there plunging\r\ninto a crevasse. This becomes hollowed into a tube like the penstock of\r\na water power and the foamy torrent springing into the blue chasm is\r\ncalled a “moulin,” or mill. In this way the waters thawed from the\r\nsurface reach the bottom and there roar along through an ice tunnel to\r\nthe end of the glacier, bursting into daylight as a full fledged river.\r\n\r\nGlacial streams are capricious. On a frosty morning scarcely any water\r\nflows and one can go far into the ice cave, but in the late afternoon\r\nthere is a raging torrent loaded with mud and stones spreading into half\r\na dozen channels on the broad flood ground. On a rainy or snowy day when\r\nthe sun is hidden, the glacial river almost goes out of business, but\r\ncomes to life again when the clouds vanish and the sun shines. At those\r\nheights with a clear sky the heat of the sun may be intense though it is\r\nfreezing a few feet away where some rock casts a shadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _The Work of Glaciers._\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting points in a glacier is its carrying power.\r\nThough it is in motion like a plastic substance it is solid and strong\r\nenough to support any weight loaded upon it. Debris quarried by frost\r\nfrom the mountain side buries its edge so that often one may walk 50\r\nyards out before the ice can be seen. This fringe of broken rock carried\r\non the edge of the glacier is called a marginal moraine. When two\r\nglaciers join, the marginal moraines between them unite to form a medial\r\nmoraine, and when several tributaries combine to make a large glacier\r\nthe dark lines of the medial moraines can be followed by the eye for\r\nlong distances upwards to rocky peaks rising out of the névé, the source\r\nfrom which the train of rocks was derived.\r\n\r\nBlocks even as large as cottages now and then roll down upon the ice and\r\nare transported without trouble. Medium size blocks a few feet across\r\ncalled “glacier tables” are left standing on pedestals of ice, as\r\nthawing goes on all round them, since they protect the ice beneath from\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nThe whole mass of stony material is carried steadily onwards until the\r\nend is reached where melting is complete and no more burdens can be\r\nborne. Then a terminal moraine is piled up, a steep and rugged crescent\r\nof loose blocks by no means easy to scramble over.\r\n\r\nWork just as important is going on out of sight beneath the glacier,\r\nwhere fragments of stone frozen into the bottom of the ice form tools\r\nfor gouging, carving and scouring the rocky floor, both tools and rocks\r\nbeing ground up into the “rock flour” that makes the glacier streams so\r\nmilky and opaque. The ground up material mixed with stones of all shapes\r\nand sizes without any assortment is left behind when the glacier thaws\r\nas “boulder clay.” A little search in this clay shows stones with\r\npolished and striated surfaces, well worn tools, often called “soled\r\nboulders” and the rock surface beneath the boulder clay is seen to be\r\nrounded, smoothed and grooved in a very striking way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _The Retreat of Glaciers._\r\n\r\nOur glaciers, like those of other countries, are now almost all in\r\nretreat, either because the climate is slowly growing warmer so that\r\nthawing goes on faster or because the snowfall is lessening so that the\r\nnévé fields no longer feed the glaciers as substantially as before. On\r\nthis account one can often see several terminal moraines down the valley\r\nbelow the one now forming. The nearest to the present end of the ice is\r\nalmost bare, the next, a few hundred yards away, may have bushes growing\r\non it, and others a mile or two away may be covered with ancient forest.\r\n\r\nFor some years past the Vaux family of Philadelphia, two brothers and a\r\nsister, all admirable photographers, have fixed the position of the end\r\nof all accessible glaciers by marking points and directions on rocks\r\nnear by and by photographing the snout of the glacier. This work\r\ndetermines their rate of advance or recession from year to year, and a\r\nrecord of the results is published in the journal of the Alpine Club of\r\nCanada and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    LAKE LOUISE AND VICTORIA GLACIER\r\n\r\nGlaciers once filled all the mountain valleys and even pushed out\r\nthrough the passes into the prairies and through the fiords to the sea,\r\nfor everywhere one finds boulder clay and moraines and valleys with U\r\nshaped cross sections that can only be accounted for by glacial action\r\non a large scale. This work was done during the Ice Age, and one may\r\ntruly say that the higher mountains are still in the Glacial Period.\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful results of former ice action is to be found in\r\nthe “cirques,” half Kettle or arm chair valleys, high up among the\r\nmountains overhanging the main valleys and enclosed by vertical cliffs\r\non all sides except in front. These are the deserted nests of cliff\r\nglaciers, hollowed out by the ice itself and often deepened so that a\r\nturquoise blue lake lies within rock rims. If not too high up these\r\ncirque lakes are surrounded by evergreen forest, behind which rise the\r\ngray or purple walls of rock with some snow in the ravines above, the\r\nwhole mirrored in the lake, until some catspaw of breeze shatters the\r\nreflection. Lake Agnes in the mountains behind lake Louise is an easily\r\nreached example of a cirque basin, and there are hundreds of others\r\nscattered through the fastnesses of the mountains, all gems in their\r\nway, many not yet seen by the eye of a white man. The higher cirque\r\nlakes, above timberline, enclosed only by cliffs and snow, have an\r\naustere beauty of their own, but lack the graces and the wild flowers of\r\ntheir sisters below in the forest zone.\r\n\r\nOften the walls of such valleys are leaped by streams from some melting\r\nsnowfield falling hundreds of feet and reaching the bottom as mere\r\nthreads of spray.\r\n\r\n\r\n               _Glaciers Reached by the Canadian Pacific_\r\n\r\nThere are very few parts of the world where fine glacial scenery can be\r\nfound so close to a great railway as in our mountain parks. If one stops\r\nat lake Louise, in Rocky Mountains Park, the splendid Victoria glacier\r\nis in view doubled by reflection in its waters, which get their\r\nexquisite color from the last remaining particles of mud brought down by\r\nthe glacial stream. Two miles walk or ride along a good trail brings one\r\ninto its presence, and often great masses of ice may be seen avalanching\r\ndown from cliff glaciers above to the surface of the lower glacier. From\r\nlake Louise as a centre one can reach the well named Paradise valley by\r\nten miles ride or drive over a good road and visit the fine Horseshoe\r\nglacier at its head. The valley of the Ten Peaks farther to the\r\nsoutheast requires a somewhat longer ride or drive, passing the splendid\r\nfront of Mt. Temple, the highest summit in sight from the railway\r\n(11,626 feet). Moraine lake, eleven miles from lake Louise lies near the\r\nentrance of the valley but farther up can be seen the great Wenkchemna\r\nglacier, and several small glaciers lying between the Ten Peaks. Beyond\r\nthe Ten Peaks to the south there is a broad snowfield and glacier\r\nleading over to Prospector’s valley and Vermilion pass, but for an\r\nexcursion of such length and difficulty one should be equipped for\r\nserious climbing and have a light camp outfit.\r\n\r\nFrom any high point west of lake Louise one can catch glimpses of a much\r\nlarger snowfield towards the north near Mts. Daly and Balfour, but the\r\nglaciers flowing from it are not so easily reached as those to the south\r\nof the railway.\r\n\r\nThere are glaciers in sight during most of the descent by rail from the\r\nsummit of the pass through the wild Kickinghorse valley to Field, in the\r\nYoho Park, from which the Yoho valley may be visited with Yoho glacier\r\nat its head. Descending beyond this into the warm depths of the Columbia\r\nvalley the alpine type of scenery is lost for a time. As the railway\r\nclimbs laboriously westward out of the valley into the Selkirks, Glacier\r\nPark is entered. Here the scenery grows more striking until at Rogers\r\npass one is once more surrounded by snow peaks—hidden, alas! too often\r\nby the long snowshed. The five mile tunnel now being pierced to avoid\r\nthe heavy grades of the pass will cut out many a ravishing view of snow\r\npeak and ice tongue; but a stay at Glacier, just beyond the pass, gives\r\nan unrivalled chance to study a fine glacier with the least possible\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe Illecillewaet or Great glacier is only a mile and a half from\r\nGlacier station and as its foot may be reached with very little\r\nclimbing, more travellers visit it than any other glacier in Canada. A\r\nclimb to Mt. Lookout just west of the glacier gives a magnificent view\r\nover the Illecillewaet glacier and névé and over the grand mountains\r\nsurrounding it. This region was the first part of our snowy mountains to\r\nbe carefully explored and mapped by a skilful climber. The Rev. W.\r\nSpotswood Green made Glacier his headquarters for this work in 1888 and\r\npublished his interesting book “Among the Selkirk Glaciers” in 1890.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    THE ILLECILLEWAET OR GREAT GLACIER, GLACIER PARK\r\n\r\nThere are still finer snowfields and glaciers in the little explored\r\nregion to the north around Mt. Sir Sandford, the highest point in the\r\nrange (11,634 feet), though these are out of reach for the present; but\r\nany of the higher peaks near Glacier give a marvellous view over a\r\nwilderness of snow and ice broken by cliffs too steep for snow to lie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    CREVASSES, GLACIER SOUTHEAST OF TEN PEAKS\r\n\r\nSome of the lower points of the Selkirks, just west of the Columbia\r\nvalley, not more than 7,000 or 8,000 feet in height, face the opposite\r\nRocky mountains with 100 or more glaciers in sight at once, the view\r\nbeyond the wide and deep valley sweeping 150 miles of the main chain on\r\nits snowy western side. Unfortunately up to the present no path has been\r\nmade to such a lookout point, and the dense forest makes the ascent\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThe greatest névé in Canada, so far as known, is the Columbia snowfield\r\ncovering 100 square miles and sending tongues of ice down into a dozen\r\nvalleys, but this is 80 miles northwest of Lake Louise and can only be\r\nvisited with a camp outfit and packtrain. Its northern limit will be\r\nwithin new boundaries of Jasper Park and some day a good road will lead\r\nthrough the mountains past this splendid glacier region from the Grand\r\nTrunk Pacific to the Canadian Pacific opening up to the public the\r\nfinest glacial playground in Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _The Robson Region._\r\n\r\nThe beauties of the Louise, Field and Glacier regions on the Canadian\r\nPacific are well known to the public and have been seen by thousands but\r\nthe exceedingly impressive glacial surroundings of Mt. Robson near the\r\nYellowhead Pass on the Grand Trunk Pacific have so far been little\r\nvisited. Mt. Robson, rising 13,087 feet above the sea, the highest point\r\nin the Canadian Rockies, is invisible from the pass itself, hidden by\r\nthe nearer Rainbow mountains but bursts upon the view where Grand Forks\r\nriver enters the Fraser. Only a few miles away at the head of the low\r\nvalley its tremendous cliffs, mostly too steep for snow to lie, rise for\r\n10,000 feet, crowned with a snowy pyramid. A trail leads up the Grand\r\nForks through the valley of a Thousand Falls where the main river\r\ntumbles 1,500 feet in a wild canyon and reaches the rear side of Mount\r\nRobson 5,700 feet above the sea. From some low mountains to the\r\nnorthwest there is perhaps the most splendid view in North America of\r\nmountains, glaciers and lakes. The blue seracs of the Tumbling glacier\r\nseem to be rushing down thousands of feet from the Helmet and the main\r\npeak of Robson to plunge into Berg lake, which doubles them by\r\nreflection. To the left the main glacier, starting in great icefalls on\r\nthe northeast of the peak, sweeps a curve of five or six miles round the\r\ndark rocks of the Rearguard. Behind the main glacier toward the south\r\nrises the unbroken snow slope of Mt. Resplendent ending with a\r\nprojecting cornice of snow at 11,000 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    CREVASSE, ROBSON GLACIER\r\n\r\nThe water coming from the ice caves of the main glacier flows chiefly\r\ninto Berg lake and the Grand Forks, but a smaller part reaches lake\r\nAdophus and Smoky river, a tributary of the Mackenzie river, the same\r\nglacier sending tribute to the Arctic and the Pacific Oceans.\r\n\r\nThere are other striking mountains in the region, such as Mt. Geikie to\r\nthe south of the Yellowhead pass and the Whitehorn to the north, though\r\nnone rival Mt. Robson itself; but much remains for exploration and it\r\nwill be years before this northern region of the Rockies, all the\r\nAlberta side of which is in Jasper Park, is thoroughly known and mapped.\r\nTrails are being rapidly built in the park, however, and with the\r\nerection of hotels at Jasper and other points it will soon be possible\r\nfor the alpine climber and the tourist to find easy access to this\r\ndelightful region.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Some Comparisons._\r\n\r\nMuch of the exploration of the Canadian Rockies and Selkirks has been\r\ndone by Englishmen and eastern Americans who received their training as\r\nmountaineers in the Alps, and one naturally asks why they should travel\r\nthousands of miles to our western mountains when the Alps are so much\r\nmore accessible. There is, of course, the charm of a virgin and\r\nunexplored wilderness in our Rockies and Selkirks, so seductive to one\r\nwho loves adventure; but there are other attractions as well which make\r\nour mountains fully the equal of the famous European range. Every type\r\nof Alpine scenery is as well illustrated in Canada as in Switzerland and\r\nthe area of snow mountains in Alberta and British Columbia is several\r\ntimes that of the Alps. The whole length of the Alps is less than 400\r\nmiles and its breadth from 50 to 80; as compared with a length of 1,200\r\nmiles and a breadth of 140 miles for the Rockies and Selkirks, not to\r\nmention the Gold ranges, the Coast range and the Vancouver Island\r\nmountains, all of which have their snow fields and glaciers. Stuttfield\r\nand Collie in their delightful book “Climbs and Explorations in the\r\nCanadian Rockies” say of the Rockies that “they have a remarkable\r\nindividuality and character in addition to special beauties of their own\r\nwhich Switzerland cannot rival.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    GLACIAL STREAM, MT. ROBSON, DIVIDING ITS WATERS BETWEEN THE PACIFIC\r\n    AND ARCTIC OCEANS\r\n\r\n [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    ICE BRIDGE ON ILLECILLEWAET GLACIER\r\n\r\nThough there are higher mountains in the Rockies of the United States,\r\nthey rise from a dry and lofty tableland and most of them have little\r\nsnow and no glaciers. But for the row of extinct volcanoes beginning\r\nwith Mt. Baker, Mt. Rainier and Mt. Shasta, the United States has very\r\nlittle truly alpine scenery except where our Rocky mountain ranges\r\nextend for a degree or two south of the boundary. A great many of the\r\nmountain climbers of the eastern states come to Alberta or British\r\nColumbia when they want to use an ice axe or a glacier rope and most of\r\ntheir experienced climbers are members of the Alpine Club of Canada.\r\n\r\nCanadians themselves are often not aware of the splendid scenery and the\r\nunsurpassed opportunities for climbing of all grades of difficulty\r\noffered by their own mountains. There is no more exhilarating sport than\r\nthat of the mountaineer, and there is no more interesting region for the\r\ngeologist, the botanist or the zoologist than the grand ranges of\r\nmountains that run parallel to the Pacific in our western territory.\r\nWhile tourists from all over the world are being attracted more and more\r\nto our glorious alpine region it is especially important that our own\r\npeople should seek a delightful holiday and gain health and vigor in our\r\nmountain parks. As good roads and trails and cabins for shelter are\r\nextended to the wilder and more impressive parts of the mountains it\r\nbecomes easier for the ordinary visitor to study the sublimities of\r\nvalleys, glaciers and mountain peaks once out of reach without an\r\nexpensive camp equipment.\r\n\r\nA few good Swiss guides are available at the more important centres in\r\nthe mountains and the inexperienced climber should not undertake any\r\ndifficult glacier work nor bad rock climbing without the aid of a guide.\r\nThere is of course a wide range of less difficult walks and climbs that\r\nbrings one without risk into the heart of the mountains where one may\r\nstudy the ways by which snowfields and glaciers and glacial rivers do\r\ntheir work of shaping the mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                A. P. Coleman in “The Canadian Rockies”\r\n\r\n\r\nIf one halts by chance anywhere on a mountain pass, all sorts of\r\nthrilling things are going on around. Lovely flowers are opening eagerly\r\nto the sun and wind of Spring—in mid August, with September snows just\r\nat hand, a whole year’s work of blossom and seed to be accomplished\r\nbefore the ten months’ winter Sleep begins. Bees are tumbling over them\r\nintoxicated with honey and the joy of life while it is summer. Even the\r\nhumming-birds, with jewels on their breasts as if straight from the\r\ntropics, are not afraid to skim up the mountain sides, poise over a\r\nbunch of white heather, and pass with a flash from flower to flower. The\r\nmarmots with aldermanic vests are whistling and “making hay while the\r\nsun shines,” and one may see their bundles of choice herbs spread on a\r\nflat stone to dry, while the little striped gophers are busy too. Time\r\nenough to rest in the winter.\r\n\r\nEverything full of bustle and haste and of joy, what could be more\r\ninspiring than the flowery meadows above tree-line when the warm sun\r\nshines in the six weeks of summer! The full splendour and ecstacy of a\r\nwhole year’s life piled into six weeks after the snow has thawed and\r\nbefore it falls again!\r\n\r\nHigher up even the snow itself is alive with the red snow plant and the\r\nblack glacier flea, like the rest of the world making the most of\r\nsummer; and as you take your way across the snow to the mountain top,\r\nwhat a wonderful world opens out! How strangely the world has been\r\nbuilt, bed after bed of limestone or slate or quartzite, pale grey or\r\npale green or dark red or purple, built into cathedrals or castles, or\r\ncrumpled like colored cloths from the rag-bag, squeezed together into\r\narches and troughs, into V’s and S’s and M’s ten miles long and two\r\nmiles high; or else sheets of rock twenty thousand feet thick have been\r\nsliced into blocks and tilted up to play leap-frog with one another.\r\n\r\nAnd then the sculpturing that is going on! One is right in the midst of\r\nthe workshop bustle where mountains are being carved into pinnacles,\r\nmagnificent cathedral doors that never open, towers that never had a\r\nkeeper—all being shaped before one’s eyes out of the mighty beds and\r\nblocks of limestone and quartzite that were once the sea bottom. You can\r\nwatch the tools at work, the chisel and gouge, the file and the\r\nsandpaper. All the workmen are hard at it this spring morning in August;\r\nthe quarryman Frost has been busy over night, as you hear from the\r\nthunder of big blocks quarried from the cliffs across the valley; there\r\nis a dazzling gleam on the moist, polished rock which craftsman Glacier\r\nhas just handed over to the daylight; and you can watch how recklessly\r\nthe waterfall is cutting its way down, slicing the great banks of rock\r\nwith canyons!\r\n\r\nIt is inspiring to visit the mountains any day in the year, but\r\nespecially so in the July and August springtime when a fresh start is\r\nmade, and plants, animals, patient glaciers, hustling torrents, roaring\r\nrivers, shining lakes are all hard at work rough hewing or putting\r\nfinishing touches on an evernew world.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * *\r\n\r\n“From the physical geographer’s point of view, every feature of the Alps\r\nhas its counterpart somewhere in the Rockies; folds and faults and\r\ntilted strata are carved into an infinitude of shapes, including risky\r\npeaks and aiguilles; snow and ice are present in every form, smooth and\r\neasy or torn with blue crevasses and splintered into daring seracs.\r\nThere is every variety of stream at work, clear or muddy, gentle or\r\nfurious, including much larger rivers in much longer valleys than any in\r\nthe Alps. Small lakes are far more numerous and beautiful. Every element\r\nof interest and beauty on the physical side is as well developed\r\nsomewhere in the Rockies as it is in the Alps but from my own\r\nobservation I may suggest that often the Alpine mountain group is better\r\nposed, the picture better composed from the point of view of the\r\nbeholder, than in the Rockies. The reason for this is I believe, largely\r\none of area. The comparatively small mass of the Alps is more statuesque\r\nand more easily seen from the proper point of view than any part of the\r\nCordilleran region, which sprawls over a hundred thousand square miles.\r\nThis seeming lack of focus and concentration of dramatic points seems to\r\nme the greatest defect of the Rockies as compared with the Alps.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is a cleanness and virginity, an exquisite\r\nloneliness about many of the Rocky Mountain peaks and valleys that has a\r\npeculiar charm. There is the feeling of having made a new discovery, of\r\nhaving caught Nature unawares at her work of creation, as one turns off\r\nfrom a scarcely-beaten route into one never trodden at all by the feet\r\nof white men; and this experience may be had in a thousand valleys among\r\nthe Rockies.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           Five Great Glaciers in the Canadian National Parks\r\n\r\n\r\n                            By A. O. Wheeler\r\n                     Director Alpine Club of Canada\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _Yoho Glacier._\r\n\r\nThe Yoho glacier is situated at the head of the Yoho valley and is of\r\nvery spectacular appearance. It presents a magnificent cascade of broken\r\nice falling into the valley a long way below timber line and the forest\r\nis seen thickly clothing the heights far above it.\r\n\r\nThe glacier is of the alpine type. It has its origin in the Wapta\r\nicefield, a wide snow covered tract of ice with an area of some\r\ntwenty-five square miles, and affords one of the principal overflows\r\nthat maintain the yearly accumulation of snow on this great basin at a\r\nconstant level.\r\n\r\nThe glacier presents a splendid opportunity for study and observation.\r\nIt is readily accessible by the pony trails that traverse the valley and\r\ncan be reached in a day from either Emerald lake chalet or the Takakkaw\r\nfalls summer camp, to both of which places good driving roads are open\r\nfrom the village of Field on the C.P.R. railway.\r\n\r\nFrom glaciers at the summit of Balfour pass, lying some two and a half\r\nmiles east of Yoho glacier, Waves creek flows westward and is the main\r\nsource of Yoho river. Until recently the bed of Waves creek, a deep,\r\nnarrow rock canyon, lay, at its terminal point, beneath the icefall of\r\nthe Yoho glacier and there joined with the flow from it, reappearing at\r\nthe nose of the glacier as the Yoho river. As a result of this\r\ncombination, during the summer months, a very beautiful ice cave was\r\nformed at the nose of the glacier, which was a source of much delight to\r\nvisitors. The ice, however, has been in retreat for many years and has\r\nnow gone back so far that the bed of Waves creek is quite clear of it\r\nand the great ice arch formed yearly by its torrent is no longer seen.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, the Alpine Club of Canada, through the writer, began\r\nobservations and measurements of the flow and advance of retreat of the\r\nice. Such observations were carried on steadily, year by year, until\r\n1919, when, owing to the ice tongue having shrunken very greatly and\r\nhaving become much crevassed, they were discontinued.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of twelve years it has been found by measurements from\r\nmarked rocks that the ice has receded 396 feet; also by means of metal\r\nplates placed on the surface of the forefoot the movement of which was\r\nannually measured, it was found that the mean average rate of surface\r\nflow of the ice has been 3·3 inches per day for the period mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe Yoho glacier is but one half a dozen that flow from the Wapta\r\nicefield, and the icefield itself one of many such wide snow-filled\r\nbasins that lie among the crest of the Main Range of the Rocky mountains\r\nand culminate in the great Columbia icefield with an area of 110 square\r\nmiles of ice and snow, reaching out with numerous ramifications and many\r\nmagnificent ice-falls.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _Victoria Glacier._\r\n\r\nThe Victoria glacier is of the _alpine type_, that is, has its origin in\r\nthe snow that accumulates at the summit of the Abbot pass, and is fed by\r\nsnow and ice avalanching from the adjacent slopes of Mts. Lefroy and\r\nVictoria.\r\n\r\nIt flows in a narrow channel between the precipitous sides of the two\r\nmountains named, which is known as the death Trap, owing to the number\r\nof avalanches that are precipitated from side to side directly across\r\nits bed. It is wise to make the traverse of this part of the glacier\r\nduring the early morning hours before avalanches begin to fall. The\r\naltitude of the pass is 9,588 feet above sea level. The snow covered\r\npart of the glacier, or névé, below the pass lies at an altitude of\r\nabout 7,500 feet. The Lefroy glacier comes in as a tributary from the\r\nsoutheast from below the cliffs of Mt. Lefroy.\r\n\r\nThe length of the Victoria glacier is about 2¾ miles. The Lefroy glacier\r\nis about 1 mile in length. The combined glaciers flow down the valley.\r\nThe forefoot or tongue of the glacier is covered by a thick veneer of\r\nrock detritus carried down by the flow of the ice and fallen from the\r\ncliffs of Popes peak on the west side, and Mt. Aberdeen on the east. The\r\nice terminates at from 1½ to 2 miles from the end of lake Louise. Owing\r\nto the close proximity of the glacier to Lake Louise Château, the C.P.R.\r\ntourist hotel, and its easy access therefrom it is of great interest on\r\naccount of the many spectacular features it present and its unique\r\nsetting of cliffs and snow clad mountains. Particularly may be mentioned\r\nthe number of avalanches that thunder into Death Trap daily and the\r\nexhibit of semi-circular markings, known as “Forbes dirt bands” seen on\r\nthe body of the ice opposite the junction with the Lefroy glacier.\r\n\r\nThe Victoria glacier has been steadily receding for many years.\r\nObservations carried on by George and William S. Vaux, and later by Miss\r\nMary Vaux of Philadelphia (now Mrs. Charles Walcott), show that between\r\n1898 and 1903 the glacier receded about 17 feet annually or about 85\r\nfeet for the 5 years. Subsequent measurements by Miss Vaux show that for\r\nthe year 1909 to 1912 the ice receded 43 feet. The amount of recession\r\nis small compared with that of other glaciers, but a reason is found in\r\nthe fact that the whole ice forefoot is thickly covered with a veneer of\r\nbroken rock which protects it from the sun’s rays and reduces the\r\nmelting process to a minimum.\r\n\r\nOf late years no measurements have been made for advance or retreat of\r\nthe ice but, as all the most prominent glaciers of the Canadian Rockies\r\nare known to be receding, it is assumed that the same has been the case\r\nwith the Victoria glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Wenkchemna Glacier._\r\n\r\nThe Wenkchemna glacier lies at the northern base of the Ten Peaks in the\r\nvalley of Moraine lake. The name is of Sioux Indian origin, Signifying\r\nten, and was given to the glacier by Mr. S. E. S. Allen, an early\r\nexplorer, in relation to the Ten Peaks.\r\n\r\nIt is of the _piedmont type_ of glacier, that is, has its source from a\r\nnumber of commensal streams of ice, fed by snow falling upon the eastern\r\nslopes of the Ten Peaks. These independent streams descend to the valley\r\nof Moraine lake and are so close to one another that when they reach the\r\nfloor of the valley they spread out laterally and join together, forming\r\na single glacier with a breadth of about three miles and a length of\r\nfrom one-half to one mile. Its supply is maintained by the independent\r\nice streams referred to above. Glaciers so formed are known as the\r\n“piedmont type.”\r\n\r\nThe Wenkchemna glacier lies at an altitude between 6,400 feet and 7,500\r\nfeet and the easternmost nose is about 400 feet higher than that of the\r\nVictoria glacier.\r\n\r\nNo systematic observations of the Wenkchemna glacier have been made but\r\nit has been visited and photographed several times by Messrs. William S.\r\nand George Vaux, and Miss Vaux of Philadelphia. Their observations have\r\nshown that the glacier has made an advance while all the other glaciers\r\nin the district have been in retreat. In its advance, it has encroached\r\non the living forest and has crushed and thrown down the green timber.\r\nIts advance is probably due to the fact that its surface is thickly\r\ncovered with broken rock, fallen from the precipitous sides of the Ten\r\nPeaks, and the melting of the ice has been less than the accession it\r\nreceives from the ice streams that feed it.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of systematic observations and measurements it is not\r\nknown whether it is continuing to advance, is stationary or is in\r\nretreat. Like the Victoria glacier it affords a feature of very great\r\ninterest for observation and scientific study, owing to its easy access\r\nfrom Lake Louise Château and the summer camp for visitors which is\r\nmaintained at Moraine lake close to the glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        _Illecillewaet Glacier._\r\n\r\nThe Illecillewaet glacier is commonly referred to as the Great glacier\r\nof the Selkirks, although it is by no means the largest one. It is,\r\nhowever, one of the most spectacular, and is seen from Glacier House,\r\nthe C.P.R. Hotel near the railway summit of the range, falling some five\r\nthousand feet from skyline of the icefield in which it has its source.\r\nSeen from high up on the opposite mountain side, it presents a\r\nbird’s-eye view that is unique and altogether entrancing.\r\n\r\nThe glacier is of the _alpine type_ and is fed by the overflow from the\r\nIllecillewaet icefield, which contains an area of some ten square miles.\r\nThe icefall is of special interest, owing to the fact that it is\r\nsituated about one and a half miles from the hotel and is reached by a\r\ndelightful pony trail through primeval forest—forest presenting a most\r\npicturesque setting of giant cedar, hemlock and spruce trees, and, at\r\ntheir base, an impenetrable tangle of thick undergrowth, midst which the\r\nmany-spined devil’s club repels the would-be explorer by its poisonous\r\npunctures. This barrier is of semi-tropical luxuriance and is justly\r\nfamous in the valleys of the Selkirks. It is, however, not without its\r\nattractions, for the wonderful collection of ferns, the bright berries\r\nof the devil’s club, the handsome white flowers of the wild rhododendron\r\nand the luscious fruit of the huckleberry are most alluring.\r\n\r\nThere are two other special features for which the Illecillewaet glacier\r\nis famous. One is the low altitude at which the nose of the ice-fall is\r\nfound, 4,800 feet, while timber line lies at 7,300 feet; consequently\r\nthe ice extends 2,500 feet down into the virgin forest. The other is the\r\nimmense terminal moraines, consisting of great blocks of rock weighing\r\nhundreds of tons, which are seen across the valley below the glacier.\r\nThese moraines have been deposited by the ice many hundred years ago and\r\nare now grown with huge trees and other forest growth. Owing to their\r\nappearance and the frequent cave-like openings between blocks, they are\r\nreferred to by Dr. Sherzer, in his treatise on the subject, as “Bear Den\r\nMoraines”. The ice has now retreated a long way from them.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the Illecillewaet glacier presented a fine ice cave at\r\nits snout which was much visited by tourists from Glacier House, but\r\nowing to the continued retreat and shrinkage to which the icefall has\r\nbeen subjected for many years, it is now a feature of the past.\r\n\r\nObservations and measurements of the ice-fall were carried on during a\r\nseries of years by Messrs. Vaux and Miss Vaux (Mrs. Charles Walcott) of\r\nPhiladelphia, the results of which may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nAugust 17th, 1898, the most advanced point of the ice forefoot was 60\r\nfeet from a deeply imbedded marked boulder. On July 24, 1906, it was 327\r\nfeet from the same boulder. On the 19th July, 1912, the ice was found to\r\nhave retreated 615 feet from the boulder. Since then the ice has receded\r\nvery considerably and the forefoot shrunken greatly in size and\r\nspectacular appearances. Of late years the measurements do not seem to\r\nhave been continued and the distance from the boulder is not known to\r\nthe writer. The average maximum surface flow of the ice forefoot during\r\nthe periods 1898 to 1912 appears from the observations referred to above\r\nto have been approximately five inches per day.\r\n\r\nDirectly above the icefall towers the Selkirk giant, Mt. Sir Donald,\r\n10,808 feet above sea level, which furnishes one of the most attractive\r\nclimbs of the region for mountaineers. From its summit is seen a world\r\nof snowy peaks, widespread icefields, tumbling glaciers and winding\r\nsilver streams in the depths of darkly forested valleys filled with\r\nviolet haze.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _Asulkan Glacier._\r\n\r\nTributary to the valley of the Illecillewaet glacier is the Asulkan\r\n(Wild Goat) valley, which is, perhaps, the most beautiful specimen of a\r\nmountain valley traversed by a rushing glacier torrent, that can be\r\nfound. On either hand are towering mountain slopes and precipices,\r\nexalted rock ledges from which spectacular waterfalls leap from great\r\nheights, overhanging snow crests which often send roaring avalanches\r\nsweeping all before them into the valley below and far up the opposite\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the valley lies the Asulkan glacier. It is of the\r\n_piedmont type_, created by three commensal streams of ice. According to\r\nDr. Sherzer, it is now in its second childhood. The piedmont\r\ncharacteristics are disappearing and the glacier resolving itself into\r\nthe original glaciers of alpine type which gave rise to it.\r\n\r\nIt is easy of access from Glacier House, and of great interest to\r\nobservers. It has its chief source in the Asulkan icefield, which leads\r\nto a snow crest or col, known as the Asulkan pass. On the opposite side\r\nof the pass a steep descent brings one to the ice stream of the Geikie\r\nglacier, the southern overflow of the Illecillewaet icefield. Beyond,\r\nlies the steep icefall of the Dawson glacier and Mts. Dawson and Selwyn,\r\nover 11,000 feet above sea level.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Asulkan glacier, also, observations and measurements\r\nwere carried on by Messrs. Vaux and Miss Vaux.\r\n\r\nOn August 12, 1899, a rock in line with the farthest advanced ice of the\r\nforefoot was marked. On August 8, 1900, the ice had receded 24 feet. On\r\nAugust 6, 1901, the ice had advanced 36 feet. On July 23, 1906, the ice\r\nwas again in line with the rock; that is in the same position as in\r\n1899.\r\n\r\nSubsequent observations by Miss Vaux show that between August 20, 1909,\r\nand July 27, 1912, the ice had retreated 259 feet from the marked rock.\r\nDuring the interval the observations on August 9, 1911, show that the\r\nice had again advanced 51 feet. No measurements made since that date\r\nhave come to the knowledge of the writer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n--Some palpable typographical errors were corrected.\r\n\r\n--Copyright and publisher’s information was included from the printed\r\n  copy: this eBook is public domain in the country of publication.",
