INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n_Topography of the Land_\r\n\r\n\"As a whole, the surface of the State of Illinois is nearly level.\r\nThe prairie regions which cover a large part of the state are only\r\nslightly rolling, except in those places where streams have worn\r\nvalleys. These are shallow in the eastern and the northern parts of\r\nthe state, deepening gradually as the great rivers are approached.\r\nNearly all the waters of Illinois find their way to the Mississippi\r\nriver. Along this river, as also along the larger streams of the state,\r\nthe lands are cut into abrupt bluffs or sharp spurs which, nearing\r\nthe sources of the streams, gradually become softened into rounded\r\nhillocks, sinking at last into the low banks. Through such waterways\r\nas these form, flow streams usually gentle in current, often sluggish,\r\nand sometimes becoming even stagnant. Over a large part of the state,\r\nponds and \"sloughs\", or marshes, formerly abounded. In these the water\r\nwas renewed only by the rains that fell occasionally. Under hot suns\r\nthese ponds, having neither inlet nor outlet, quickly became foul,\r\nparticularly where stock resorted to them to drink and cool themselves,\r\nas they did almost universally throughout the state a few years ago,\r\nand do even now in some parts.\r\n\r\n\"For years such ponds furnished the principal, almost the only, water\r\nsupply for stock in large areas of this state. The constant use of\r\nsuch impure water greatly injured the quality of the milk and butter of\r\ncows, and doubtless had a baneful effect upon the health of the animals\r\nthat drank the foul water and those who used the milk and butter.\r\n\r\n\"With the drainage of the land and the introduction of a pure supply\r\nof water, came the disappearance of certain diseases of cattle and of\r\nhuman beings, particularly the so-called milk sickness and kindred\r\nmaladies, and a marked improvement in the flavor and keeping qualities\r\nof milk and butter. Although the change thus far has been great, there\r\nare yet districts in which there has been little improvement in the\r\nconditions of the land, of the water supply, or of the people. Stock\r\nare still compelled to depend, for their water supply, upon streams and\r\npools that almost invariably become stagnant in the warm and dry days\r\nof the latter part of summer each year.\"[1]\r\n\r\nInquiries addressed to hundreds of intelligent and careful observers,\r\nnearly all of whom were practical stockmen, elicited information\r\nshowing the following:\r\n\r\n  Number of        District              Chief Source of Water\r\n  Counties                                   Supply\r\n\r\n   8          Northwest or Postal      Streams and wells;\r\n                   District              springs furnish a\r\n                                         considerable part of\r\n                                         it; few ponds used;\r\n                                         three instances of\r\n                                         tile drains.\r\n\r\n              Central Northern         Wells chief source;\r\n                   Counties              springs, streams,\r\n                                         and tiles used to a\r\n                                         considerable extent.\r\n\r\n              Northeast Counties       Streams, wells, and springs\r\n                                         used about equally.\r\n\r\n              Eastern Counties         Wells chiefly; streams next;\r\n                                         ponds and tile drains\r\n                                         follow in the order named;\r\n                                         nine instances of springs.\r\n\r\n              Central Counties         Forty-nine districts report\r\n                                         wells; forty report\r\n                                         streams; thirty-five tile\r\n                                         drains; twenty-five ponds;\r\n                                         twenty-four springs.\r\n\r\n              Western Counties         Wells and tile drains equal;\r\n                                         springs next; ponds in a\r\n                                         few instances.\r\n\r\n   4          Southern Counties        Ponds and streams equal; six\r\n                                         report wells; five report\r\n                                         springs; four tile drains.\r\n\r\n  21          Central S.

Stagnant water is found more generally in the southern\r\nthan in the northern part of Illinois; chiefly, perhaps, because the\r\ncultivation and drainage of the land has not become almost universal as\r\nit has in the northern districts.\"\r\n\r\nIn several counties artesian wells afford a most copious supply of\r\nwater of good quality. In Iroquois and other eastern counties, such\r\nwells have been bored to a depth of from 150 to 200 feet and obtained\r\nan unfailing flow of water impregnated with minerals. Stock show a\r\nstrong liking for such water after becoming accustomed to its use,\r\nand it is the belief of those who have had opportunity for observing\r\nthe effects of its continued use, that this mineral water serves to\r\nkeep the animals free from disorders which formerly prevailed in that\r\nregion. This seems to be especially apparent in regard to malarial\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n_People_\r\n\r\nAbout 1820, the State of Illinois was being rapidly settled by\r\npeople from the eastern states. Prior to this time, very few white\r\nsettlements had been made in the state. These early pioneers, drawn\r\nfrom the population of the eastern states, were composed of almost\r\nall nationalities. They pushed their way across the mountains of\r\nPennsylvania and Virginia in crude wagons, drawn by oxen, bringing\r\nwith them their household goods and a few milk cows. They came into\r\nIllinois, built new homes, and laid out new fields on the broad,\r\nunsettled prairies.[2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBeginning with the year of 1800, when there were only a few people in\r\nthe state, the population has increased very rapidly, as is shown by\r\nthe following statistics, taken from the United States Census Report\r\n(special supplement for the State of Illinois):\r\n\r\n  Year      Population\r\n\r\n  1790\r\n  1800          5,641\r\n  1810         24,520\r\n  1820        147,178\r\n  1830        343,031\r\n  1840        685,866\r\n  1850        851,470\r\n  1860      1,711,951\r\n  1870      2,539,891\r\n  1880      3,077,871\r\n  1890      3,826,352\r\n  1900      4,821,550\r\n  1910      5,638,591\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cattle and Cattle Feeding_[3]\r\n\r\nWhen Illinois was first settled, almost the whole of the middle and\r\nthe northern parts of the state were covered with a rank growth of\r\nnative grasses, which furnished an ample supply and variety of forage\r\nof fair quality. \"In the southern districts were heavy forests, but in\r\nthe central and northern sections were but few groves or other timber\r\ngrowths to afford shelter to stock.\" The prairie grasses that grew in\r\nthe central and northern districts were usually devastated by fire\r\nduring the fall. However, the general fencing and cultivation of the\r\nland put a stop to the burning of these dead grasses of the prairies,\r\nand soon groves of oaks sprang up and covered many uncultivated spots.\r\nThe leaves which stayed on these trees throughout the winter until\r\nspring, furnished valuable shelter to stock from the raw winter winds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the settlement of Illinois, very little attention\r\nwas given to the cattle interest. The pioneer settlers, however,\r\nhad brought a few milk cows with them from the eastern states, but\r\nthese cows were kept for milk only, no thought being given to beef\r\nproduction. After a few years, a few pure bred cattle were brought in,\r\nat which time some attention was given to beef, as well as to milk\r\nproduction, not for the beef produced, however, but principally to give\r\na ready market for their grain crops.\r\n\r\nThe practice of raising beef cattle to market grain continued from then\r\nuntil near the end of the nineteenth century, when cattle feeding was\r\nno longer profitable as a grain market, and the question was: \"How much\r\nbeef can be produced from a bushel of corn?\"[4]\r\n\r\n\"Despite the seemingly adverse character of the climate, Illinois has\r\nbeen, for some time, little, if any, behind other leading states of the\r\nUnion in stock growing. In 1850, this state stood sixth in milk cows,\r\nand seventh in work oxen and other cattle. In 1860, it was tenth in\r\nwork oxen, fifth in milk cows, and second in other cattle. In 1870, it\r\nwas twenty-sixth in work oxen, fourth in milk cows, and second in the\r\nsupply of other cattle. In 1880, it stood thirty-sixth in work oxen,\r\nsecond in milk cows, and third in other cattle. Iowa then had 240,280\r\nand Texas had 1,812,860 more cattle than Illinois.\r\n\r\n\"The average value of milk cows in Illinois in 1884 was $35, and of\r\noxen and other cattle, it was $28.04, while the average value of milk\r\ncows in Iowa was only $31.75, and of other cattle $26.00. The blood of\r\nthe Shorthorns was used more largely than that of any other breed in\r\nthe improvement of the cattle of the state. The first, and for some\r\nyears, the only representatives of pure races of cattle in this state\r\nwere Shorthorns, and to this date they exceed all other breeds in\r\nnumber.\"\r\n\r\nThe growth of the cattle interest in the State of Illinois, from 1850\r\nto 1884, inclusive, is shown by the following statistics, taken from\r\nthe United States Census Reports. The first figures of close accuracy\r\non the number of cattle in the state were those gotten in 1850.\r\n\r\n  ----+--------------+-------------+----------------+-----------------\r\n      |  Milch Cows  |  Work Oxen  |  Other Cattle  |      Total\r\n  Year|-------+------+------+------+---------+------+---------+-------\r\n      |  No.  |Inc. %|  No. |Inc. %|   No.   |Inc. %|   No.   | Inc. %\r\n  ----+-------+------+------+------+---------+------+---------+-------\r\n  1850|294,671|      |76,156|      |  541,209|      |  912,036|\r\n      |       |      |      |      |         |      |         |\r\n  1860|522,634| 77.3 |90,380| 18.6 |  970,799|  79.4|1,583,813|  73.6\r\n      |       |      |      |      |         |      |         |\r\n  1870|640,321| 22.5 |19,766|-78.1 |1,055,499|   8.7|1,715,586|   8.3\r\n      |       |      |      |      |         |      |         |\r\n  1880|865,913| 35.2 | 3,346|-83.0 |1,515,063|  43.5|2,384,322|  38.9\r\n      |       |      |      |      |         |      |         |\r\n  1883|716,102|-17.3 |      |      |1,253,765| -17.2|1,969,867| -17.4\r\n      |       |      |      |      |         |      |         |\r\n  1884|919,404| 17.7 |      |      |1,471,191|  17.3|2,390,595|  21.3\r\n  ----+-------+------+------+------+---------+------+---------+-------\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Report of the Bureau of Animal Industry, 1885, p. 362.\r\n\r\n[2] United States Census Report and interviews with old settlers.\r\n\r\n[3] Report of Bureau of Animal Industry, 1885, p. 365.\r\n\r\n[4] Bureau of Animal Industry, 1885, p. 365-66\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. CATTLE FEEDING INDUSTRY[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When the farms of Illinois were first put into cultivation, the\r\nattention of the farmers was almost entirely devoted to grain raising.\r\nWheat was cash and was the only product of the farm that could be sold\r\nfor ready money. The virgin soils of the state gave to the pioneer\r\nlarge crop yields, but constant cropping soon began to tell on the soil\r\nand each year the crop yield became lighter. This depletion of the\r\nfertility of the soil by continuous cropping, together with a need for\r\na near market for the grain crops, soon gave stimulus to an idea that\r\ncattle feeding would help restore the fertility of the soil and, at the\r\nsame time, market the grain at home.\" From this time on, the production\r\nof beef in this state has been one of the most important phases of\r\nagriculture. In the southern part of the state, however, which was\r\nsettled largely by French, and where the predominating cattle continued\r\nto be the mongrel bred stock, little attention was given to cattle\r\nfeeding. These people turned their cattle out on the luxuriant grass\r\nand relied upon the meat and milk produced in that way.\r\n\r\n\"In the evolution or development of beef production that followed\r\nin Illinois and other corn-belt states, there has been two distinct\r\nstages, and it is now entering upon the third stage. The first stage\r\nwas that in which cattle were fed to market corn, and also to increase\r\nthe fertility of the soil, which was being depleted by the continuous\r\ncropping. The second stage was that in which the ranges had been broken\r\nup and the object was not to raise cattle to market corn but to raise\r\ncorn to make beef.\" The third stage, or that upon which the industry is\r\nnow entering, is that of baby beef making.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSeventy or eighty years ago, and for several years afterward, cattle\r\nwere bred and fed, not primarily for beef production, but to market\r\ncorn. The farmers of those days were accustomed to say: \"I'll make\r\nmy corn walk to market,\" or \"I'll condense my freight,\" or \"I'll\r\ngrow packages in which I can condense my corn and put in the hay and\r\npastures as well.\" Statisticians figured that about six tons of corn\r\ncould be put into one ton of pork, about ten tons into one ton of beef,\r\nand from twenty to twenty-five tons into one ton of butter. There\r\nwere very few railroads in the state at that time and farmers were\r\nforced to haul their corn and wheat thirty and forty miles to reach\r\na station. And while freight rates were extortionately high on corn\r\nand wheat in proportion to their cash value, railroads were racing\r\nwith each other to get the livestock trade. They gave passes, rebates,\r\nand quick service, and many other things to get the patronage of the\r\ncattle feeders and shippers. The country roads in Illinois were bad,\r\nthe bridges were few and poor, and the farmers, therefore, soon came to\r\nrealize that their corn must walk to market if it gave them any profit.\r\n\r\n\"The growing of the so-called packages in which to condense freight,\r\nand thereby sell corn to a better advantage, was an easy matter\r\nin those days. In the newer sections, away from the main lines of\r\nrailroads, there was much open prairie land, which was covered with\r\nluxuriant grass. Cattle could be herded on this free grass on the\r\nprairies at a dollar a head from May to October, and then stalk\r\nfields could be had for ten cents an acre. Usually these stalk fields\r\ncontained from twenty cents to thirty cents worth of corn per acre. The\r\nonly expensive months for feeding were March and April, when either\r\nclover, timothy, or prairie hay had to be fed. The cost in the summer\r\nwas only about twenty cents a month per head, in the winter about\r\nthirty-three cents. The total cost of growing a package was about\r\n$6.00.\"\r\n\r\nThe cattle herders in those days made contracts with the large\r\noperators to graze so many cattle at so much per head during the\r\ngrazing season. The usual price for the entire season was from $1.00 to\r\n$1.50 per head. These cattle ranged from three to seven years old by\r\nthe time they were ready for market and sold for about $25.00 per head.\r\n\r\nAn instance of the cattle herding industry, as it may be termed, is\r\nrelated by Mr. C. W. Yapp, now of Urbana, Illinois, who was one of the\r\nearly herders in that country near Mahomet:\r\n\r\nAbout 1855, at 13 years of age, Mr. Yapp began herding cattle for the\r\nthen large cattle feeders of that part of the country. In the early\r\nspring of 1860, he started from Mahomet with a bunch of 12 cattle, to\r\nmeet a large drove that was coming up from the southern part of the\r\nstate. These cattle were native stock which had been collected over\r\nthe state. The entire bunch numbering around 900, were driven to\r\nDrummer's Grove, near Gibson City. There they were branded and herded\r\non the open prairie during the spring and summer. In the fall, they\r\nwere returned to the lots of the large feeders, where they were fed\r\nout during the winter. The feed during the winter consisted mostly of\r\nshocked corn.\r\n\r\nSome of the large cattle feeders bought their packages to be filled\r\nwith corn, while others grew them. In either case, the primary aim was\r\nnot to make beef, but to market the corn crop at a much better price\r\nthan would be obtained if the winter was spent in hauling the corn to\r\nmarket at the nearest town. Naturally, these feeders fed corn with a\r\nlavish hand. They fed from twenty to thirty pounds to a steer per day,\r\nand if the steer became gorged and mussed over it, it was thrown out\r\nto the hogs. They kept corn before their cattle all the time. They\r\nargued that if you want solid beef, beef that will weigh like lead,\r\ngive the cattle nothing but corn and water. They wanted big packages,\r\nnothing less than two-year-old steers past would do, and three and\r\nfour-year-olds were preferable. They wanted steers that would be at\r\nleast four years old when ready for market and that would weigh from\r\n1500 to 1600 pounds. These steers were desirable because they would\r\nhold more corn than the smaller ones. Very little attention was given\r\nto the finish of the steers sent to market. They were all driven out\r\ntogether regardless of the degree of finish. It was not until some\r\ntime in the eighties and nineties that much attention was given to the\r\ndegree of finish in fat steers when sent to market.\r\n\r\nAfter the open prairies became settled up and there was no more free\r\ngrass at home, the feeders of Illinois and the adjoining states could\r\nbuy their packages on the ranges on the plains west of the Mississippi\r\nriver, or at the range cattle markets. Corn was still cheap and so were\r\npackages in the shape of stockers and feeders. The reason for this was\r\nthat the great corn fields of Kansas and Nebraska were being opened\r\nup and the great national pastures from Canada to the Texas Panhandle\r\nhad not yet become spotted and rendered useless by the homesteader.\r\nSpeculation in semi-arid land had not set in, and the term \"dry\r\nfarming\" had not been invented.\r\n\r\nThe great drouths caused the price of corn to fluctuate but the\r\naggregate corn yield kept on increasing with increased acreage and\r\nusually the year following a drouth was one of superabundance of corn.\r\nSuch was the year of 1895 following the drouth of 1894. The proportion\r\nof cattle per thousand population steadily increased. Meanwhile our\r\ncattle markets became centralized and were always full to overflowing.\r\nEverybody wondered where the cattle came from.\r\n\r\nIn the year of 1895, this system reached its climax. The question\r\nconfronting the farmer at this time was: \"Why did he continue growing\r\ncorn and feeding cattle?\" He grew corn because he could do it cheaply\r\nand more certainly than anything else. The farmer had begun to realize\r\nthat the limit of good land watered by the rains of heaven would soon\r\nbe reached. He would, therefore, hold on to his land and gain back\r\nall that he had lost in fertility by growing corn in the increased\r\nprice of land that was sure to come in the near future. He had been\r\nfeeding cattle to sell his corn with the idea also that cattle feeding\r\nand cattle grazing were good for the land. The limit of good land was\r\nnot reached, however, nearly so soon as he had expected and when it\r\nwas reached, land advanced in price more rapidly than even the most\r\noptimistic had anticipated. The year of 1895 marks the end of the first\r\nstage of beef production in Illinois as well as in the other corn belt\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Summer That the Rain Came Not_]\r\n\r\nIn the nineties (1896), cattle feeding in Illinois and the other\r\ncorn belt states entered upon the second stage of its evolution or\r\ndevelopment. The purpose of feeding cattle during this stage was not\r\nto market corn but to make beef. The great corn crop of 1895 and 1896,\r\nfollowing the drouth of 1894, gave very cheap corn. Cattle were cheap\r\nalso. During the two years 1896-1897, business was on a standstill the\r\nwhole country over, but the next year, 1898, business started in full\r\nblast; cattle began to advance in price, and the demand for feeders\r\nincreased. As a consequence, the whole country was scoured for them,\r\nbut it was found that the choicest ones had been sold off in 1894, and\r\nthe early part of 1895. Cattle feeders, anxious to secure cattle to\r\nfill their feed lots, turned to other sources for their supply. They\r\nwent into Mexico, Oregon, Colorado, and Tennessee, and bought their\r\nfeeder cattle. When cattle went up in price, corn went up also, then\r\nlabor began to gradually go up.\r\n\r\nAt that point began the advance in the value of land. The government\r\nhad no more choice corn land. The two acres necessary to keep a cow\r\nduring the summer and two more acres, the hay from which would keep\r\nher during the winter, doubled in price within the next fifteen years,\r\nbut it did not increase in actual value as determined by the amount of\r\ngrass or grain it would produce. It was at that time the people were\r\nconfronted first with dear land, stockers, feeders, corn, hay, and\r\nbeef. This all led the cattle feeders and the corn growers to begin\r\nstudying out a method or system by which they could profitably grow\r\ncorn to make beef instead of growing beef to market corn. The prices of\r\nfat cattle were very tempting, something unheard of ever before, but\r\nwhen it came to buying feeders, the margin was very little greater than\r\nit had been in previous years, and besides, corn was higher than it\r\nhad ever been. The problem then was, how to get the most beef out of a\r\nbushel of corn.\r\n\r\nExperiment stations had been doing work along that line for several\r\nyears. They pointed out that the younger and smaller the animal is, the\r\nless will be the grain required to sustain the life-giving forces, or\r\nto run the machine, and a greater proportion will go to the building up\r\nof body tissue, hence the greater the profit in feeding young animals.\r\nFeeders began to drop out the two and three year old steers and replace\r\nthem with baby beeves. Many feeders tried it but somehow or other they\r\ncould not make it work according to the experimental evidence. They\r\nfound no profit in feeding any kind of cattle. Many feed lots became\r\nempty and blue grass and clover pastures were plowed up and put into\r\ncorn fields. If corn was worth more outside of the steer than it was\r\nin the steer, the farmer argued, why feed cattle? The landlord could\r\nget more rent from corn land than from grass land devoted to cattle\r\ngrazing; therefore, he saw no profit in building expensive barns,\r\nsheds, and fences for cattle feeding.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1907, business was flourishing and packers were in\r\nneed of money. To meet their needs, they flooded the western banks with\r\ncommercial paper. They bought so few cattle that the price fell off\r\nat least 30 per cent in three months' time. The loss accrued by such\r\na rapid decline in the price of fat cattle was so great that it paid\r\nfor the commercial paper that had been issued by the packers. Such\r\nconditions as these hastened the process of depleting the feed yards\r\nand decreasing the number of cattle on the market.\r\n\r\n\"The cattle have left central Illinois and the grain elevator now\r\ndistinguishes the landscape. The vast blue grass pastures of the\r\nante-bellum period have disappeared, and corn tillage is the principal\r\noccupation of the agrarian population. Down in Morgan and Sangamon\r\ncounties, even recollections of the cattle trade, as it existed in the\r\ndays of John T. Alexander and Jacob Strawn, are being rapidly affected.\r\nA few cattle come in from the west to be fattened on corn, but summer\r\ngrazing is the exception and the interest of the occupant of the land\r\ncenters, not in the cattle market quotations, but in the price of\r\ncorn.[6]\r\n\r\n\"All the evidence seems to point toward the conclusions that another\r\nchange in the corn belt system of beef production is imminent.\r\n\r\n\"One of two things will happen or Illinois will quit the cattle\r\nbusiness. Either some new breeding and rearing center must be\r\ndeveloped, or Illinois feeders must return to breeding their own feeder\r\nsteers.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that Illinois will not quit the cattle business. There is\r\ntoo much at stake besides the mere success or failure of the cattle\r\nbusiness alone. First of all, this country needs the beef. The greatest\r\npeople of the earth have been meat eaters, and I believe that the\r\nAmerican people will continue to eat meat and will pay the price\r\nnecessary to make its production profitable.\r\n\r\n\"Another consideration of vital importance, but too broad a subject\r\nfor discussion in this connection, is the value of livestock as an\r\naid to the maintenance of soil fertility. Then, too, for the sake of\r\nour economic stability, the livestock interest of the country must be\r\npreserved and encouraged. Professor Herbert W. Mumford is my authority\r\nfor the statement that 80 % of the corn grown in the United States is\r\nfed to livestock. Picture, if you can, the effect upon corn belt land\r\nvalue and our economic situation generally if the country suddenly lost\r\nthis market for 80 % of its corn crop.\r\n\r\n\"Regarding the possibility of another breeding center being developed,\r\nit may be said that there are other sections that can produce feeders\r\nmuch more cheaply than Illinois. There are large areas of cheap lands\r\nin some of the Gulf states with which Illinois could not compete in the\r\nproduction of feeder steers. But these sections are not interested in\r\nthe production of cattle, and it is doubtful if the south ever produces\r\na surplus of feeder steers. Hence, it seems that the probable solution\r\nof the whole question will be brought about by producing our own\r\nfeeders.\r\n\r\n\"If Illinois does return to the cattle breeding business, it will not\r\nbe on the old extensive scale that prevailed throughout the state a\r\ngeneration ago. Grass grown on these high priced lands is too expensive\r\nto be disposed of with so lavish a hand as it was thirty or forty years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n\"A return to cattle breeding in Illinois will be coincident with a\r\nmore general adoption of supplement for pasture. The use of smaller\r\nproportions of permanent pasture, more extensive use of rotated or\r\nleguminous pastures, the passing of the aged steers in our feed lots,\r\nand the inauguration of what may be called intensive systems of baby\r\nbeef production.\"[7]\r\n\r\nNUMBER OF BEEF CATTLE IN ILLINOIS BY YEARS FROM 1856 TO 1914.\r\n\r\n  Year    Number of Beef Cattle\r\n             in Illinois\r\n\r\n  1856        1 169 855\r\n  1857        1 351 209\r\n  1858        1 422 249\r\n  1859        1 336 565\r\n  1860        1 425 978\r\n  1861        1 428 362\r\n  1862        1 603 946\r\n  1863        1 684 892\r\n  1864        1 370 783\r\n  1865        1 568 280\r\n  1866        1 435 769\r\n  1867        1 486 381\r\n  1868        1 520 963\r\n  1869        1 584 445\r\n  1870        1 578 015\r\n  1871        1 611 349\r\n  1872        1 684 029\r\n  1873        2 015 819\r\n  1874        2 042 327\r\n  1875        1 985 155\r\n  1876        1 857 301\r\n  1877        1 750 931\r\n  1878        1 775 401\r\n  1879        1 862 265\r\n  1880        1 998 788\r\n  1881        2 045 366\r\n  1882        2 012 902\r\n  1883        1 959 867\r\n  1884        1 997 927\r\n  1885        2 166 059\r\n  1886        2 337 074\r\n  1887        2 480 401\r\n  1888        2 465 288\r\n  1889        2 398 191\r\n  1890        2 095 595\r\n  1891        1 853 318\r\n  1892        1 615 405\r\n  1893        1 812 924\r\n  1894        1 798 417\r\n  1895        1 782 158\r\n  1896        1 626 171\r\n  1897        1 753 371\r\n  1898        1 802 061\r\n  1899        1 886 933\r\n  1900        2 009 598\r\n  1901        2 372 710\r\n  1902        2 409 772\r\n  1903        2 325 980\r\n  1904        2 535 954\r\n  1905        2 301 519\r\n  1906        2 203 108\r\n  1907        2 065 816\r\n  1908        1 892 118\r\n  1909        1 691 686\r\n  1910        1 512 055\r\n  1911        1 473 741\r\n  1912        1 258 293\r\n  1913        1 170 628\r\n\r\n\"In reviewing the cattle breeding and the cattle feeding situation\r\nin Illinois in 1894, Mr. J. G. Imboden stated that the outlook was\r\nnot very encouraging. The question was, \"Are the men who are feeding\r\nthe grain and fodder crop of the farm any worse off than those grain\r\nfarmers who are selling their grain on the market, or even the butcher,\r\nthe grocer, the boot and shoe dealer, or the drygoods merchant?\" They\r\nundoubtedly were not at that time. Competition was very close, profits\r\nsmall, and unless a business man was satisfied with a small profit, his\r\ncompetitor did the business. Such were the conditions that faced the\r\ncattle breeders and feeders at that time.\r\n\r\n\"From 5 % to 10 % of the feeding value of the crops on Illinois farms\r\nwere left in the field; straw-stacks stood in the field where the\r\nthresher left them; stover stood on the field after the corn was\r\nhusked, while on these same farms were stock that were shrinking from\r\nexposure and lack of feed.\"\r\n\r\nThe outlook for the feeder was very discouraging, but much more so for\r\nthe breeder. There were no hopes for success for the breeder until the\r\nfeeder had two or three years of success in order to make a market for\r\nthe cattle that were bred. Strong efforts were being made to devise\r\nsome methods of feeding the farm products more economically and in such\r\na way as would mean more grain and better profits for the feeder.\r\n\r\n\"The cattle feeders of Illinois presumed that the time was nearing when\r\nfeeder cattle of the best grade for grazing and feeding purposes would\r\nbe hard to secure. While at that time there were plenty of cattle west\r\nof the Mississippi river, in Illinois there was a scarcity of breeding\r\ncattle to supply the demand. It was harder to buy a bunch of fifty\r\nuniformly good steers, throughout central Illinois especially, than\r\nit had been for fifteen years past. This was probably due to the fact\r\nthat feeders had quit raising their feeding cattle and the breeders had\r\nchanged from one breed to another in hopes of finding a breed that\r\nwould give them greater returns. Again, many breeders had become very\r\ncareless of the merits of the cattle on their farm.\"[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The First Silo in Illinois_\r\n\r\n\"In 1881, Oatman Brothers, of Dundee, Illinois, built the first silo\r\nin the state. At the eighth annual meeting of the Illinois State\r\nDairyman's Association, held at Dundee, Illinois, December 14-16, 1881,\r\nMr. E. J. Oatman read an article on \"Silos and Ensilage.\"\"\r\n\r\nMr. Oatman stated that some agricultural paper in Chicago had been\r\nagitating the building of silos in Illinois and had tried to induce\r\nhim to build one. The stories that the paper told about the value of\r\nensilage as a feed sounded too good to be true. The idea of cutting\r\nup green fodder, packing it away in a hole, and expecting to see it\r\ncome out in first class condition, in the dead of winter, seemed to be\r\nimpossible. A great many objections arose to such \"cow kraut\" as some\r\ncalled it. It would heat, ferment, and rot; therefore it was a very\r\ndifficult matter to make people see its value as a feed.\r\n\r\nMr. Oatman, however, visited the farm of Messrs. Whitman and Burrell at\r\nLittle Falls, New York, on February 1, 1880, for the purpose of seeing\r\ntheir silo and the condition of their ensilage. He made a thorough\r\ninvestigation and thereupon became convinced that ensilage was a\r\nsuccess. He returned home to his farm at Dundee and made preparations\r\nto build a silo. His first silo was 49 feet by 43 feet by 20 feet deep,\r\ndug out into the ground. It was divided into three parts, all of\r\nwhich were made of concrete.\r\n\r\nAfter the silo was finished, Mr. Oatman proceeded to fill it, which\r\nrequired thirteen days with a force of ten men, at a rate of about\r\ntwenty-three tons per day. After it was filled, stone was placed on\r\ntop, at the rate of about 150 pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\nMr. Oatman met with many discouragements with his new silo; the\r\ncommunity at large thought it was a very foolish idea. Some said that\r\nif it did keep, the cattle would not eat it, and others still more\r\nradical, even hoped that he would lose it all, and said that any man\r\nwho would try such a thing was crazy.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came to open the silo, Mr. Oatman found that the silage\r\nwas all fresh and nice with the exception of a few inches on top. His\r\ncattle took to it readily, and he found that it greatly increased the\r\nmilk production of his dairy herd.[9]\r\n\r\nThe use of ensilage as a feed for beef and milk production has become\r\nso general in Illinois since the first silo was built in 1881 that\r\nensilage is now one of the staple feeds. While there are a few people\r\nwho still think that the use of ensilage in the production of beef\r\nis a fad, practically every one agrees that it is economical in the\r\nproduction of milk.\r\n\r\nEnsilage is a roughage and not a concentrate, and its profitableness in\r\na fattening ration depends not so much upon its nutritive value as upon\r\nits succulence and palatability, the steers' ability to consume large\r\nquantities of it, and the fact that it makes possible the utilization\r\nof all of the corn plant, a large proportion of which would be wasted.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery year sees a more general adoption of ensilage as a roughage, and\r\nwith the inauguration of the present intensive system of baby beef\r\nproduction, and where the baby beeves are raised on the farm on which\r\nthey are to be fed, ensilage is the most economical feed that can be\r\nused in maintaining the breeding herd.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chicago Market_\r\n\r\n\"The situation of Chicago in the great agricultural center of the\r\nUnited States brought it into prominence at an early day as the center\r\nof the live stock trade. This position it has never lost. However great\r\nmay be the development of other sections of the country, Chicago can\r\nnot fail to continue to be the leader in this class of business. Its\r\nlocation as a railroad center and its position as a distributing point\r\nis made secure by the steadiness of its growth and the magnitude of its\r\npresent operations. There is greater competition in this market than\r\nin any other. The Chicago market is the purchasing point, not only for\r\nthe local packers, large and small, the exporters, and the speculators,\r\nbut also for a great number of smaller packing houses scattered over\r\nthe country, and for the feeders and breeders of the most fertile and\r\nlargest agricultural sections of the United States.\"[10]\r\n\r\nPrior to the year of 1833, Chicago had no provisions to export, and as\r\nlate as 1836, an actual scarcity of food there created a panic among\r\nthe inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe first shipment of cattle products from Chicago was made in 1841,\r\nby Newbury and Dale on the schooner, Napoleon, bound for Detroit,\r\nMichigan. This shipment consisted of 287 barrels of salted beef and 14\r\nbarrels of tallow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Statistics of Chicago 1837._\r\n\r\n  Population:\r\n    Whites           3989\r\n    Colored           160\r\n    Males            2579\r\n    Females          1570\r\n                    ------\r\n      Total          4149\r\n\r\n  Buildings:\r\n    Dwellings         398\r\n    Drygoods stores    29\r\n    Grocery stores     26\r\n    Hardware stores     5\r\n    Drug stores         3\r\n    Churches            5\r\n\r\nThere were two weekly papers published in Chicago at this time: The\r\nAmerican, a whig paper, and the Democrat.\r\n\r\nThe first market in the way of stock yards in Chicago was located on\r\nthe north branch of the Chicago river. These yards were used chiefly\r\nfor swine. In 1836, the first cattle yards were opened on a tract of\r\nland near twenty-ninth street and Cottage Grove avenue. A few pens had\r\nbeen erected here to accommodate the cattle trade. The first scales\r\nfor weighing livestock ever used in that country were used in these\r\nyards.[11]\r\n\r\nIn 1855, there were two regular stock yards in Chicago; one, called\r\nthe Merrick Yard, is now known as the Sherman Yards, and the other was\r\ncalled the Bullshead Yard. A great many eastern people came to Chicago\r\nat this time to buy fat cattle to take back east. Most of the cattle\r\nthey bought were driven over into Indiana to Michigan City, to be\r\nshipped on east. John L. Hancock was the only packer in Chicago at this\r\ntime. Ice was not used, and packing was done during the cool seasons of\r\nthe year.\r\n\r\nOne element of the success of Chicago as a market was the fact that\r\nstock might be pastured without charge on the prairies near the city,\r\nwhile the owners awaited favorable market conditions in the eastern\r\nstates. The cattle were herded on the open prairies just outside of the\r\ncity, and the buyers of Chicago rode out each day and bought the cattle\r\nin such numbers as they needed.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, the growth of the livestock traffic had increased so rapidly\r\nthat the several railroad companies that centered in Chicago, together\r\nwith the managers of the stock yards already existing, combined for the\r\nerection of the Union Stock Yards. These were opened for business on\r\nChristmas day, 1865.[12]\r\n\r\n\"The meat industry of Chicago, from the purchase of the livestock to\r\nthe shipment of the meat, in either the fresh or the cured condition,\r\nis carried on at the Union Stock Yards, which are located near the\r\noutskirts of the city. The yards cover exactly a square mile of ground.\r\nOne-half of this area is covered with cattle pens, and the other half\r\nby huge establishments of the packing houses. The pens are surrounded\r\nby strong stockades, about shoulder high, and they are laid out in\r\nblocks with streets and alleys, in much the same fashion as an ordinary\r\nAmerican town. The whole of this area, a half mile in width, and a mile\r\nin length, is paved with red brick; and here we see the first notable\r\nevidence of the effort to maintain the stock yards in a sanitary\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\"The brick paving makes it possible to thoroughly clean both pens and\r\nstreets, and this is done at regular and frequent intervals.\"[13]\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may have been the conditions in the past, it is a fact that\r\ntoday the greatest care is exercised in the shipment and handling of\r\nthe stock from the time they leave the farms until they reach the\r\npacking houses. The price that the animals will bring in the pens\r\ndepends upon the conditions they present under the eye of the buyer,\r\nwho represents the packing houses, and it is to the interest of the\r\nfarmers, the cattlemen, and the commission men, to whom the cattle are\r\nconsigned at the yards, that they shall receive the best food and the\r\nmost careful attention up to the very hour at which the sale is made.\r\nThey are shipped in special stock cars, in which they are carried as\r\nexpeditiously as possible to the stock yards, where they are unloaded\r\nand driven to the pens. Here they are at once fed and watered, each pen\r\ncontaining a feeding trough and a water trough, into which a stream of\r\nfresh water is kept running.\r\n\r\n\"The cattlemen consign their stock to the various commission houses,\r\nand for receiving and selling the stock, there is a charge of,\r\nrespectively, twenty-five cents and fifty cents a head. The purchase\r\nof the cattle is made by buyers, of whom each of the packing houses\r\nmaintain a regular staff.\"\r\n\r\n\"About 1845, a bold editor left Buffalo, New York, then the greatest\r\nlake part of the country, and bravely ventured as far into the rowdy\r\nwest as Chicago. Possibly the people here received him with generous\r\nhospitality; perhaps they treated him with something even more warming\r\nto the inner man; or it may be that as they filled him with solid chuck\r\nand, perhaps, with less solid refreshments, they took occasion to\r\nremark, with that modest and restrained hopefulness for which Chicago\r\npeople have justly received credit, that Chicago was destined to become\r\na town of some importance. Be that as it may, when that editor luckily\r\nfound himself once more safe within his sanctum, he gave vent to his\r\njoy and overflowing gratitude by writing wild, enthusiastic predictions\r\nconcerning the future of the town, which was then aspiring to rise\r\nabove the rushes and wild rice of the Chicago river.\r\n\r\n\"Reckless of the opinion of the readers of his paper, perhaps trusting\r\nto their ignorance of the conditions of the out of the way place, this\r\nbold editor predicted that the day would come when Chicago would have\r\nan elevator capacious enough to hold 25,000 bushels of grain, and that\r\nin a single winter season, 10,000 cattle, and as many hogs, would be\r\nslaughtered and packed there.\r\n\r\n\"Beef packing was the leading industry of Chicago at that time, but\r\nno trustworthy statistics relating to the cattle traffic previous to\r\n1851 have been preserved, and from 1851 until 1856 no account of the\r\nreceipts of cattle were kept. This was probably due to the fact that a\r\nlarge number of those cattle that were brought to Chicago were held on\r\nthe open prairies until sold to butchers to supply the requirements for\r\nlocal consumption. No accurate count of cattle disposed of in that way\r\ncould well be obtained.\"\r\n\r\nStatistics of the receipts of cattle at the Chicago Union Stock Yards\r\nfrom 1851 to 1913, inclusive, and the shipments from 1852 to 1884,\r\ninclusive:\r\n\r\n  Year     Receipts       Shipments\r\n  1851       22 566[14]\r\n  1852       25 708[14]         77\r\n  1853       29 908[14]      2 657\r\n  1854       36 888[14]     11 221\r\n  1855       39 865[14]      8 253\r\n  1856       39 950         22 205\r\n  1857       48 524         25 502\r\n  1858      140 534         42 638\r\n  1859      111 694         37 584\r\n  1860      177 101         97 474\r\n  1861      204 579        124 146\r\n  1862      209 655        112 745\r\n  1863      300 622        187 048\r\n  1864      303 726        162 446\r\n  1865      333 362        301 637\r\n  1866      393 007        263 693\r\n  1867      329 188        203 580\r\n  1868      324 524        215 987\r\n  1869      403 102        294 717\r\n  1870      532 964        391 709\r\n  1871      543 050        401 927\r\n  1872      648 075        510 025\r\n  1873      761 428        574 181\r\n  1874      843 966        822 929\r\n  1875      920 843        696 534\r\n  1876    1 096 745        797 724\r\n  1877    1 033 151        703 402\r\n  1878    1 083 068        699 108\r\n  1879    1 215 732        726 903\r\n  1880    1 382 477        886 614\r\n  1881    1 498 550        938 712\r\n  1882    1 582 530        921 009\r\n  1883    1 878 944        966 758\r\n  1884    1 817 697        678 341\r\n  1885    1 905 518\r\n  1886    1 963 900\r\n  1887    2 382 008\r\n  1888    2 611 543\r\n  1889    3 023 281\r\n  1890    3 484 280\r\n  1891    3 250 359\r\n  1892    3 571 796\r\n  1893    3 133 406\r\n  1894    2 974 363\r\n  1895    2 588 558\r\n  1896    2 600 476\r\n  1897    2 554 924\r\n  1898    2 480 897\r\n  1899    2 514 446\r\n  1900    2 729 046\r\n  1901    3 031 396\r\n  1902    2 941 559\r\n  1903    3 432 486\r\n  1904    3 259 185\r\n  1905    3 410 469\r\n  1906    3 329 250\r\n  1907    3 305 314\r\n  1908    3 039 206\r\n  1909    2 929 805\r\n  1910    3 052 958\r\n  1911    2 931 831\r\n  1912    2 652 342\r\n  1913    2 513 074\r\n  1914\r\n\r\n\r\n_St. Louis Stock Yards_\r\n\r\nIn April, 1869, a charter was granted by the state of Illinois to the\r\nEast St. Louis Stock Yards Company.

CATTLE BARONS AND PIONEER DROVERS OF ILLINOIS\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, no\r\ndroves of cattle were seen in the country west of Ohio. The first drove\r\never driven from Illinois was taken from Springfield, through Chicago,\r\nto Green Bay, Wisconsin, in 1825, by Colonel William S. Hamilton.\r\nBeginning with this date, the practice of collecting cattle into droves\r\nand driving them to market soon grew from a minor occupation into an\r\nindustry within itself; beef cattle that were grown and fattened in\r\nIllinois were gathered together into large droves by men who made it a\r\nbusiness, and were driven to the then great cattle markets on the sea\r\nboard. Foremost among these early pioneer cattlemen were: Jacob Strawn,\r\nJohn T. Alexander, B. F. Harris, and Tom C. Ponting. In the scope of\r\ntheir operations, Jacob Strawn and John T. Alexander exceeded many of\r\nthe conspicuous operators in the rise and fall of the range industry\r\nin this state. These men owned hundreds of acres of the prairie land\r\nof the state, on which they collected enormous droves of cattle. These\r\ncattle were grazed here throughout the spring and summer, then were\r\nfed during the winter. It was no uncommon occurrence for one of these\r\noperators to buy all the corn for sale during one season in three or\r\nfour counties. The next spring these fat bullocks were trailed across\r\nthe level country to the eastern mountain ranges, over which they\r\nclimbed to reach Lancaster, Philadelphia, and New York. Cincinnati and\r\nBuffalo received a few of these cattle, but most of them were driven\r\non through to the markets on the sea board, where better prices were\r\nobtained. These cities bore about the same relation to the livestock\r\ntraffic of those days as Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, and St.\r\nJoseph bear to the cattle trade of today; they were the collecting\r\npoints for the business and the slaughterers who bought them either\r\nsalted the carcasses down in barrels and casks or sold them to local\r\nconsumers. Other dealers, however, bought some of these cattle and\r\ndrove them on to smaller towns nearer the coast. \"In the census of\r\n1850, it was recorded that Illinois alone sent 2,000 head of cattle\r\neach week to the New York market.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the cattle barons represented a large part of the beef cattle\r\ntrade of Illinois, there were hundreds of smaller dealers who fed only\r\na few cattle each year which added materially to the magnitude of the\r\nbeef cattle industry of the state. A few of these smaller operators\r\nwere found in almost every section of the state, especially in the\r\ncentral and northern part.\r\n\r\nCattle trailing continued until lines of railroad connecting Illinois\r\nwith the cities on the Atlantic coast were built. This made cattle\r\ntrailing unnecessary and greatly stimulated the production of beef in\r\nthe state by furnishing means for placing beef before the consumers of\r\nthe east quickly and, at a much less cost than that of the old method.\r\nThe long drives greatly decreased the weight of the animals, and, at\r\nthe same time, the meat of carcasses was inferior to that of the cattle\r\nthat were shipped by railroad, and slaughtered without having taken\r\nsuch a long drive.[15]\r\n\r\n\r\n_John T. Alexander_[16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN T. ALEXANDER.]\r\n\r\n\"Among the cattle operators of Illinois, John T. Alexander was probably\r\nthe greatest by reason of the magnitude of his transactions, but he\r\nwas antedated by Jacob Strawn, who located in Morgan County in 1827.\r\nAlexander has been regarded as America's greatest cattleman in a\r\ncommercial sense. In the strict sense of the term, he was a pastoralist\r\nand a trader, not an agriculturalist. His parents were native of\r\nIreland, who migrated to Virginia in 1818, and in 1824 joined the\r\nexodus to the Mississippi Valley, settling in Jefferson County, Ohio.\r\nJohn T. Alexander was the oldest of a family of eleven children. His\r\neducation was on the farm. He was endowed with that faculty called\r\ncattle sense. At the age of fifteen, he was entrusted, by his father,\r\nwith the entire charge of a drove of cattle sent to Philadelphia. He\r\nsold them to advantage, collected the money, and took it safely home.\r\nAt the age of seventeen, he was purchasing cattle in Illinois to\r\nreplenish his father's Ohio pastures. It is related that his search\r\ntook him down into Sangamon county, where he was so struck with its\r\nnatural advantages, from a cattle standpoint, that he determined to\r\nmigrate.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1840, the Alexanders settled in Morgan county, then a cattle range\r\nbounded only by the horizon. Mr. Alexander accumulated a herd of\r\nsteers, pastured them on the public domain, and for half a decade\r\nprospered in a moderate way. As the country became settled, it soon\r\nbecame evident that he must own land or get out of the cattle business\r\nas far as that locality was concerned. In 1848, he purchased 3,000\r\nacres of land at prices ranging from 87 cents to $3.00 per acre. This\r\nland was adjoining the half section that he had originally homesteaded.\r\nIn 1855, he acquired another 1,000 acres at $30.00 per acre. This\r\nindicated how rapidly the price of land was advancing. In 1857, he\r\nbought 700 acres more at $50.00 per acre, and in 1859, he acquired 1500\r\nacres of the Strawn estate at $30.00 per acre. In 1864, he secured 853\r\nacres at $60.00 to $70.00 per acre, making him the owner of 7,233 acres\r\nof the choicest land in Illinois. In 1866, he purchased the stock farm\r\nof Michael Sullivan in Champaign county, Illinois, containing 26,000\r\nacres at $11.00 to $12.00 per acre.\r\n\r\nIt was during this period of purchase that John T. Alexander acquired\r\nthe title of \"cattle king.\" His transactions were on an enormous scale.\r\nHis buyers searched every nook and cranny of the cattle producing\r\nregion of the Mississippi valley, and Alexander, on the Wabash railroad\r\nin Morgan county, Illinois, was the largest cattle shipping station in\r\nthe world. Entire trains of cattle, destined for eastern markets,\r\nwere daily loaded there and almost the entire population was on the\r\nAlexander pay roll. Thousands of other cattle, for which he paid but\r\nnever saw, were loaded at innumerable points for eastern markets. From\r\na pastoralist, he had emerged into a speculator on probably the most\r\ngigantic scale the live stock industry has ever witnessed. He ruled the\r\nmarkets of the East and was the Napoleon of the cattle trade. His name\r\nwas more familiar to the West than that of Vanderbilt or A. T. Stewart.\r\nHis annual cattle shipment for many years exceeded 50,000 head, and\r\nin 1868, reached 75,000. For a lengthy period, his sales on eastern\r\nmarkets exceeded $4,000,000 annually, and it is related that prior to\r\nhis Champaign county purchase, an inventory of his assets showed 7,233\r\nacres of land, averaging $75.00 per acre in value, $100,000 in bank,\r\n7,000 cattle on his Morgan county pastures, and not a dollar of debt.\r\n\r\nSuch speculative operations, however, had the result of entailing\r\nfinancial embarrassment. In 1871, Alexander had to contract\r\nhis business and part with his Champaign county property. This\r\nembarrassment was due to many causes, not the least serious of which\r\nwas cattle mortality by splenetic fever, by which he lost $100,000.\r\nHe also sustained heavy losses by shrinkage in cattle values, and the\r\nChampaign county investment proved disastrous. He also became involved\r\nin railroad complications. The railroads were keen competitors for\r\nthe livestock traffic and in 1871, Alexander severed his relations\r\nwith the Pennsylvania railroad, making a contract with the New York\r\nCentral, by which that company gave him a low rate conditional to\r\na specified tonnage. By way of resentment, the Pennsylvania railroad\r\nput merely nominal rates into effect, thereby glutting eastern markets\r\nand crippling Alexander's trade, which had become so colossal as to\r\nbe unwieldy. To carry on such gigantic operations, he was compelled\r\nto trust to innumerable assistants, many of whom proved to be either\r\nincompetent or unfaithful. Confronted with liabilities aggregating\r\n$1,200,000, he was forced to make an assignment, but his estate was\r\nsufficient not only to pay off every creditor, but leave him a large\r\nsum for a fresh start in life. It was while energetically engaged in\r\nretrieving his fortune that he died, in 1876.\r\n\r\nThose survivors of John T. Alexander, who remember his activity as\r\nIllinois' greatest operator, describe him as being tall and commanding\r\nin appearance. Even at the time of his death, he was hale and youthful.\r\nHe was of sanguine temperament, naturally impulsive, but quiet and\r\nnon-assuming in manner, sparing in speech, and undoubtedly one of the\r\ngreat American captains of industry in his time, an outstanding figure\r\nin a trade that boasts many conspicuous men.\r\n\r\nThe old Alexander mansion in Morgan county, the greatest house in\r\nthe countryside half a decade ago, remains in a somewhat dilapidated\r\ncondition, and the decaying out-buildings convey a mournful hint of\r\nvanished greatness. Here, during Alexander's time, Abraham Lincoln,\r\nStephen A. Douglas, Richard Yates, and others, whose illustrious\r\nnames adorn Illinois history, were the guests of America's greatest\r\ncattleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jacob Strawn_\r\n\r\nJacob Strawn came from Ohio and settled in Morgan county in 1827, and\r\na few years later was probably the most extensive cattle dealer in the\r\nworld, but his operations were, to a large extent, local and his most\r\ndistant shipping point, Saint Louis. His pastures in Morgan county\r\nembraced about 15,000 acres and his business reached its maximum about\r\n1860.\r\n\r\nSurvivors of that period recall Strawn's free handed methods. He\r\npurchased cattle by the thousands, fixing the price on mere verbal\r\ndescription as to quality and weight. Frequently, at delivery time,\r\nnobody was on hand to receive the cattle, but they were driven into the\r\nStrawn pastures and left with confidence that payment would be prompt.\r\nBoth Strawn and his successor, Alexander, were always ready to buy\r\ncattle, in fact they were the market of that period. Strawn was at the\r\nheight of his career when John T. Alexander came on the scene. Strawn\r\nproduced beef as a feeder and grazier; Alexander contracted cattle to\r\nbe delivered in the future.[17]\r\n\r\nMr. T. C. Sterrett relates that in the summer of 1856 he came to\r\nIllinois and was informed that the largest cattle dealer in the state\r\nwas Jacob Strawn, living near Jacksonville, in Morgan county. He\r\nvisited Strawn's place and found a remarkably large brick house and\r\nwas astonished at the amount of brick paving about the house. Mr.\r\nStrawn lived on a good farm at Orleans Station, east of Jacksonville.\r\nHe owned a lot of good horses and Shorthorn cattle. Piloted by the\r\nforeman, Mr. Sterrett went out into a 1,200 acre pasture which was\r\nfenced with rails and stocked with a fine lot of cattle. He was very\r\nmuch struck with a hundred head of the finest general work horses that\r\ncould be found anywhere. This band of horses and cattle, the good\r\nfences, and the general appearance of everything about the place,\r\nindicated the power and ability of the owner. Mr. Strawn was by far the\r\ngreatest American cattleman of his time.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Benjamin Franklin Harris_[19]\r\n\r\nDecember 15, 1811--May 7, 1905\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B. F. HARRIS at 55]\r\n\r\n\"Benjamin Franklin Harris was born December 15, 1811, on a farm in the\r\nShenandoah Valley, near Winchester and Harper's Ferry, in Frederick\r\ncounty, Virginia. He was the second of ten children of William Hickman\r\nHarris and Elizabeth Payne (own cousin of Dolly Payne Madison from\r\nEngland). His grandfather, Benjamin Harris, with two brothers, came\r\nfrom England and settled on the eastern shore of Maryland in 1726. The\r\nfamily were of Scotch-English extraction and Quakers; in this country\r\nbecoming fighting Quakers, then Methodists. He grew to manhood on his\r\nfather's Virginia farm, attending the country schools until sixteen\r\nyears of age. At that time, President Jackson's attitude toward the\r\nUnited States bank so seriously affected values that wheat declined\r\nfrom $1.50 to 50 cents and Virginia farm land to less than one-third of\r\nits former price. These declines so affected the father's obligations\r\nthat Benjamin Franklin Harris and his brothers, each with a six horse\r\nteam--in those days without railroads--went into the \"wagoning\" or\r\nfreighting business, and for three years \"wagoned\" freight over that\r\nsection and out through Pennsylvania and as far west as Zanesville,\r\nOhio, in order to recoupe the father's losses.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 20, 1833, the Virginia farm had been sold at 40 % of its\r\noriginal cost, and in a one-horse gig and a two-horse carryall, the\r\nHarris family set out for Ohio, arriving at Springfield on April 8,\r\nand nearby, purchased and settled upon their new farm. It was during\r\nthis year that Benjamin Franklin Harris commenced business for himself,\r\nbuying and driving cattle overland to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and\r\nthere disposing of them to cattle feeders.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, he started for Illinois via Danville, then through the present\r\nsite of Sidney, and Urbana--where there was but one cabin--and on to\r\nwhat is now Monticello in Piatt county. During the ensuing years, he\r\nbegan to accumulate farming lands in Piatt and Champaign counties and\r\nto buy cattle throughout all this section as far south and west as Mt.\r\nVernon, Vandalia, and Springfield. During several seasons, he bought\r\nfor the purpose of feeding cattle, all the corn for sale in Macon,\r\nSangamon, and Champaign counties. Each year, for nine years, he drove\r\nthese cattle overland via Muncie, Indiana; Springfield, and Columbus,\r\nOhio, into Pennsylvania, and some into New York and Boston, where they\r\nwere sold.\r\n\r\nWhen B. F. Harris came into this state, no streams were bridged, and\r\nthere were only eleven families on the Sangamon river from its source\r\nto the limits of Piatt county. Fifteen years later not a half dozen men\r\nhad ventured their cabins a mile from the timber limits--the deer and\r\nthe Indians were still at home here. In 1840, he visited Chicago, a\r\ntown of 2000 people, on stilts in a swamp. Nineteen days were required\r\nfor the trip and the corn and wheat he teamed there sold for 20 and 30\r\ncents respectively. Fifteen years after he came, not 25 % of the land\r\nin these counties had passed from government ownership and the first\r\nrailroad came twenty years later.\r\n\r\nThe operations of B. F. Harris in connection with the early beef cattle\r\nindustry of Illinois were conducted more largely along the feeding\r\nlines than were those of John T. Alexander or Jacob Strawn. He bought,\r\nfed, and sold, from 500 to 2000 head of cattle annually for nearly\r\nthree-quarters of a century. The Pittsburgh Live Stock Journal, May 8,\r\n1905, in speaking of his death, referred to him as \"The grand old man\r\nof the live stock trade--the oldest and most successful cattle feeder\r\nin the world.\" Everything to which he put his hand flourished. His\r\njudgment was so trustworthy that he made but few business mistakes. He\r\ndid business on a cash basis and was never in debt. Operating on this\r\nbasis, he was a rich man long before his race was run, and he enjoyed a\r\nperiod of ease and entire freedom from anxiety much longer than falls\r\nto the lot of most men who are counted fortunate in the world.\r\n\r\nOn May 23, 1856, his famous herd of one hundred cattle--the finest and\r\nheaviest cattle ever raised and fattened in one lot by one man--were\r\nweighed on his farm by Dr. Johns of Decatur, the president of the State\r\nBoard of Agriculture. The average weight of each of the hundred\r\nhead was 2,378 pounds. Visitors to the number of 500 came from Ohio,\r\nIndiana, Kentucky, and this state to see these cattle, whose weight can\r\nnever again be equalled. The following year, February 22, 1857, twelve\r\nof these cattle which he had retained and fed were shipped to Chicago.\r\nThis remarkable bunch averaged 2,786 pounds. Clayborn and Alley, the\r\nmost famous butchers in Chicago at that time, paraded them about\r\nChicago's downtown streets.\r\n\r\nFollowing is a copy of a pamphlet gotten out by Mr. Harris immediately\r\nafter the sale of these cattle. (see next page)\r\n\r\nThe New York Tribune of October, 1853, refers to his prize winning\r\ndrove of cattle averaging 1,965 pounds, displayed at the New York\r\nWorld's Fair then in session.\r\n\r\nEvery few years, he took cattle prizes or topped the market. Less than\r\na year before his death, his 1,616 pound cattle topped the Chicago\r\nmarket for that season.\r\n\r\nMr. Harris died May 7, 1905, in his ninety-fourth year, still in strong\r\nmental and physical vigor, although at the age of fifty-three, he had\r\nretired from extremely active business life. He came in the day of ox\r\nteams and lived to ride over his farm with his son, grandsons, and\r\ngreat grandsons in an automobile. He voted for nineteen presidents,\r\nbeginning with Henry Clay, and saw five generations of his family\r\nsettled in Champaign county. He established the First National Bank in\r\nChampaign in 1865--the oldest bank in the county, and was its president\r\nat the time of his death.\r\n\r\nIn the issue of The Breeder's Gazette, May 24, 1905, is the following\r\nstatement: \"In literature, art, professional life, or politics, a\r\nman with a record of achievements equal to that of the late Benjamin\r\nFranklin Harris would deservedly have numerous biographers. Many a man\r\nhas been made the subject of bulky biography who might not measure\r\nup to him on any score. This is not because the most inviting and\r\ninteresting personalities are found outside the farmer's calling, but\r\nlargely because until recent years agriculture as a vocation has not\r\nbeen adequately appreciated by the public.

These cattle were raised from 1 and 2-year-old\r\nsteers on my farm in Champaign County, Illinois, and fattened for the\r\nmarket in the years of 1855 and '56, their average age, at that time,\r\nbeing 4 years. They were weighed on my farm by Dr. Johns, of Decatur,\r\nIllinois, President State Agricultural Society. Said weights were\r\nwitnessed by a large number of representative men from Ohio, Indiana,\r\nKentucky and Illinois, to the number of five hundred, among whom were\r\nmany professional cattle raisers and dealers, all of whom bore willing\r\ntestimony to the average weight of the cattle, which was 2,377 lbs.\r\nper head. Out of this lot of 100 cattle, 12 head of the finest steers\r\nwere selected and fed until the following February. They then showed\r\nan average weight of 2,786¼ lbs., and were sold to Messrs. Cliborn and\r\nAlby, of Chicago, at 8 cents per lb. The weight master kept a record of\r\neach draft as the cattle were weighed--one and two in a draft. A copy\r\nof said weights is herewith attached for the inspection of the general\r\npublic; also copy of average gain at different periods.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of February, 1857, the 12 steers sold to Cliborn and Alby,\r\nappropriately decorated with tri-colored ribbon, preceded by a band\r\nof music, were led through the principal streets of Chicago, followed\r\nby 100 butchers, mounted and uniformed. After this unique procession,\r\nthe cattle were slaughtered by said Cliborn, and Alby, for the city\r\nmarkets, some of the beef selling as high as 50 cents per lb. Small\r\npackages of it were sent to customers in various parts of the United\r\nStates, and even Europe, and sold, in some cases, as high as $1.00 per\r\nlb. These orders were given by these parties simply that they might say\r\nthey had eaten of this famous premium beef.\r\n\r\n                                                           B. F. Harris.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tom Candy Ponting._\r\n\r\n                            August 26, 1824-\r\n\r\n\"Tom Candy Ponting was born at Heyden farm, Parish of Kilsmeredo, near\r\nBath, Somersetshire, England, August 26, 1824. He was the son of John\r\nPonting and Ruth Sherron Ponting. The Pontings came into England with\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, so were descendants of Normandy. The Ponting\r\nfamily were breeders of cattle and Tom Ponting has followed cattle\r\nbreeding all of his life, both in England and in this country.\"\r\n\r\nTom Candy Ponting came to the United States in 1847, landing in New\r\nYork City, and finally making his way to Etna, Ohio. Here he was\r\nemployed by a Mr. Matthews, to sell mutton from a wagon in the market\r\nhouse in Columbus, where they attended twice a week. Mutton sold for\r\n15 cents to 25 cents per quarter in those days, while beef sold for\r\n2½ cents to 3 cents per pound. After a short time, Mr. Ponting quit\r\nhis job selling mutton, went to Columbus, bought a horse and saddle,\r\nand went into the country to buy cattle. The first cattle that he ever\r\nbought in the United States were eight head which he purchased from a\r\nMr. Bishop eight miles northeast of Columbus, Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1848, Mr. Ponting, in company with a Mr. Vickery,\r\nanother Englishman, visited Racine, Janesville, Watertown, Madison, and\r\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin, looking for a location to start a butcher shop.\r\nAlthough there was plenty of need for butcher shops at these places,\r\nthey did not locate because cattle were so scarce in the country. From\r\nMilwaukee, Mr. Ponting came to Chicago to study the situations there.\r\nHe found no regular markets and only two places where they sold stock.\r\nWhile in Chicago, he met a Mr. Bradley, who had driven some cattle\r\nfrom McLean county, near Leroy. Mr. Bradley had sold all of his cattle\r\nexcept forty cows with calves. He sold these to Mr. Ponting, who drove\r\nthem to Wisconsin and sold them to immigrants, a few at a time. He\r\nsold them for $15 to $25 per head and still made money. He returned to\r\nChicago and again met Mr. Bradley, who had brought a boat load of sides\r\nof bacon up from Peoria. He had purchased this bacon from the farmers,\r\nhauled it to Peoria, and shipped it up the Illinois river to Chicago,\r\nwhere he sold it to grocery stores. This was the only means to dispose\r\nof the bacon put up by the farmers, as there was no hog packing done in\r\nChicago at that time.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradley wanted Mr. Ponting to go with him to McLean county, but as\r\nIllinois was known in those days as a very sickly state, Mr. Ponting\r\nwas afraid to venture.\r\n\r\nWhile in Chicago at this time, he met a Mr. Lewis and Mr. Heyworth who\r\nhad come up from Vermilion county with a drove of cattle. Mr. Heyworth\r\nwas taken sick here and Mr. Ponting was employed to assist Mr. Lewis in\r\ntaking the cattle on to Milwaukee.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1849, Mr. Ponting went to Georgetown, Illinois, and\r\nthere purchased about 300 head of cattle. He also bought a camping\r\noutfit, a yoke of oxen, employed a cook, and drove through with the\r\ncattle to Wisconsin. The cattle that got fat on the way were sold to\r\nthe butchers, while those that were fit for milk cows were sold to the\r\nimmigrants. During this same spring, when Mr. Ponting was in Vermilion\r\ncounty, he visited Mr. Lewis at Crabapple Grove, which is on the line\r\nof Vermilion and Edgar counties. This man and one of his neighbors\r\nhad bought a drove of geese, drove them to Iowa, and traded them for\r\nsteers. They drove the steers back to Vermilion county, fattened them,\r\nand the next spring built flat boats and shipped them to New Orleans.\r\nIn the fall of this same year, he made several trips over the line into\r\nIllinois, in Stevenson county, buying fat sheep to drive to Milwaukee.\r\nThere were no regular banks in Milwaukee, therefore all the money\r\nthat was paid for stock was Mexican dollars and five franc pieces.\r\nVery little American silver money was seen at that time. The hotel\r\nrates in Milwaukee were very cheap; only $2.00 per week, with bitters\r\nbefore breakfast, free. Whiskey sold for 15 cents a gallon and was used\r\nliberally by stock drivers.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1850, Mr. Ponting rode on horseback from Milwaukee to Leroy,\r\nin McLean county, where he met with some men who were buying cattle to\r\ntake back to California. He went from here to Christian county, where\r\nhe bought a drove of cattle which cost him from $6 to $11 per head. In\r\nthe spring, he drove them to Milwaukee. There had been very heavy rains\r\nthat spring and rivers were very high, which made cattle driving very\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1851, he purchased about 350 head of cattle, buying\r\nfrom Rochester, near Springfield, to the Wabash river. After gathering\r\nthe cattle together, he pinned them up near the present site of\r\nMoweaqua. He bought these cattle very cheap and drove the entire herd\r\nto Milwaukee, where they were herded on the prairies near town until\r\nsold. He took a few in each week and sold them to the butchers. After\r\nfinishing the season's work, he returned to Indiana to spend the winter.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1852, the cattle business in Wisconsin was dull. Money\r\nmatters were very much changed; gold began to come in from California,\r\nand get into circulation. Mr. Ponting and his partner decided to go to\r\nTexas and buy their feeder cattle. They rode through to Hopkins county,\r\nTexas. Here they visited a Mr. Hart, one of the large cattle men in\r\nthat country. They bought several hundred cattle and drove them back\r\nto Illinois, reaching Moweaqua in July of the next year. He put these\r\nTexas cattle on pasture until winter, when they were fed out on shocked\r\ncorn. Mr. Ponting's partner went to Indiana and bought several hundred\r\nhogs to follow these cattle. They bought shocked corn, paying about\r\n50 cents a bushel for it. They would go into a piece of corn after it\r\nwas dry enough and select two of the smallest shocks they could find.\r\nThe owner would select two of the largest ones. These were shocked\r\nout and weighed, the average being taken as an average size shock. He\r\nbought about 40 acres from Mr. Dennison Sanders this way. The shocked\r\ncorn was fed to the cattle in the same place each day, so that when it\r\nrained, the accumulation of stalks would keep the steers out of the\r\nmud. He drove this bunch of cattle to New York the next summer, where\r\nthey were sold July 4, 1854.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1855, Mr. Ponting purchased a large drove of cattle,\r\nwhich together with some he had bought a few months before, were driven\r\nthrough to Chicago. Illinois was pretty well settled by this time, and\r\nit was unnecessary to take a camping outfit along. He stopped this\r\ndrove of cattle near Pullman, put them out on the grass and took only a\r\nfew into Chicago at a time. There had been a great change made in the\r\nChicago market since Mr. Ponting was there two years before. There were\r\ntwo regular stock yards; the Merrick Yards, now known as the Sherman\r\nYards, and the Bullshed Yards. In the fall of this year, he bought\r\nanother bunch of cattle and drove them to Chicago in October. This time\r\nhe stopped the cattle near the present site of Kankakee, and rode on\r\ninto Chicago to learn the prospects for a market. They were then taken\r\non to Chicago and left just outside the city to graze until they could\r\nbe sold to the cattle dealers. This was the last bunch of cattle Mr.\r\nPonting ever drove over land to Chicago, and it is probable that they\r\nwere the last bunch ever driven from central Illinois. From this time\r\non, the cattle were sent to market by railroad. The next year, 1856,\r\nhe shipped 110 head of cattle from Moweaqua, the first cattle ever\r\nshipped from that place.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1857, the cattle business was very flourishing and\r\nthe packers said there would be a big demand for them that fall. Mr.\r\nPonting contracted for 1000 head of cattle and about 1500 hogs before\r\nthe season was over, but before he got them on the market, a panic came\r\non, money became almost worthless, and he suffered a heavy loss.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, Mr. Ponting went to Abilene, Kansas, to buy some feeders. He\r\npurchased about 700, sold them the next spring, making a good profit.\r\nHe repeated the Kansas purchase the next year with like success. In\r\n1868, he took the cattle he had bought in Kansas to Albany. They\r\nnumbered around 800. In 1870, he went back down into Texas and bought\r\ncattle as he had done in 1852. He found a herd of about 2500, out of\r\nwhich he bought all of the two and three year olds. These numbered\r\nabout 850, for which he paid $16 per head. There had been a new\r\nrailroad, just finished, from St. Louis through Missouri, close to\r\nthe Indian Territory line to a place called Pierce City. The railroad\r\nofficers had some agents trying to get a contract to carry these\r\ncattle, together with some other cattle belonging to Hall brothers,\r\nover the new road. They billed the cars, numbering 80 in all, with a\r\ncontract to refund $50 per car. They did this to get the contract which\r\nmade a big showing before some New York magnates, who were there at the\r\ntime trying to buy stock in the new railroad.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, Mr. Ponting visited a Shorthorn sale at Springfield and bought\r\nseveral head of cattle with which he started a Shorthorn herd. In the\r\nspring of 1880, he attended another Shorthorn sale at Chicago, where\r\nhe bought a few more Shorthorns to add to his herd. Until his first\r\npurchase of Shorthorns, Mr. Ponting's operations had been entirely\r\nalong the line of buying and feeding and although he did a small pure\r\nbred business from this time on, he continued his feeding operations\r\nas he had done in previous years, although probably not on as large a\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nMr. Ponting had not been in the Shorthorn business very long until he\r\nbecame interested in Herefords. In the fall of 1880, he visited the\r\nfair at St. Louis, where he purchased four Herefords. In the spring\r\nof the next year, Mr. W. H. Sotham of Guelph, Canada, bought four\r\nmore Herefords for him. In the fall of 1882, he sold out all of his\r\nShorthorns, thereby severing his relations with this breed.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, Mr. Ponting made a contract with the Wyoming Hereford\r\nAssociation to sell them 270 head of Hereford cattle, to be delivered\r\nin the spring of 1887. The firm paid for a part of them and Mr. Ponting\r\ntook a note for a few more. About 60 were left on his hands and had to\r\nbe sold for beef. As a result, he lost about $800 on the deal, which\r\nkilled all of his profits.\r\n\r\nMr. Ponting continued in the Hereford business until 1903, when he\r\ndecided to retire from actual business. In the summer, a gentleman came\r\nfrom Iowa and bought his entire Hereford cattle trade. He had at this\r\ntime about 3700 acres of land, 1500 acres of which were in Christian\r\ncounty. He decided to divide his property among his children, keeping a\r\nsufficient amount to support Mrs. Ponting and himself. He bought a home\r\nin Moweaqua, where he and Mrs. Ponting have lived happily ever since.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Ponting came to Chicago in 1848, there was only one cattle\r\nmarket west of the Allegheny mountains, and that was at St. Louis.\r\nAt that time, there were a good many cattle sold for the New Orleans\r\nmarket during the spring and winter, but the principal markets were New\r\nYork, Boston, Baltimore, and Philadelphia It took ninety days to make\r\nthe trip to New York with cattle and the drovers had to wait until the\r\nroads settled in the spring before they started.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Worth, Texas, there was nothing but a large fort and force of\r\nUnited States soldiers to subdue the Indians around there. The present\r\nsix big western markets have all been started since that time.\r\n\r\n\"While the magnitude of Mr. Ponting's operations was not as great as\r\nthat of John T. Alexander, and although he probably never accumulated\r\nas much wealth as Benjamin F. Harris, he was successful and his\r\noperations extended over a greater period of time than any one of\r\nthe early pioneer cattlemen of the state of Illinois. He operated\r\nthroughout two of the stages of cattle feeding and has lived to see the\r\nbeginning of the third.\"[20]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] Bureau of Animal Industry Report of 1885-86.\r\n\r\n[16] The Breeder's Gazette, July 16, 1913.\r\n\r\nHis son, John T.

THE RANGE INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In the ante-bellum period, central Illinois was a vast blue grass\r\npasture. The people were breeding many cattle, but not enough to supply\r\nthe steady increasing demand for stockers and feeders. Cattle feeders\r\nmade good the deficiency in the local production by heavy drafts on\r\nMissouri, Kansas, Texas, and other sections of the trans-Mississippi\r\nregion. The subsequent reign of King Corn was then barely in the\r\nincubating stage. Grass was the beef maker's principal reliance.\r\n\r\n\"Not until well along in the sixties did the cultivation of corn begin\r\non an extensive scale and corn-fed steers become conspicuous on the\r\nmarkets. After the grazing period, corn speedily took possession of\r\nthe whole of central Illinois, until now less than 15 per cent remains\r\nin pastures, whereas in the days of the \"barons\" an exactly reverse\r\ncondition existed. At that time, fully 85 per cent of such counties as\r\nSangamon, Morgan, and Logan, were in grass.\r\n\r\n\"The cattle that were secured from Missouri, Iowa, and Kansas, were\r\npurchased during the fall months. By the early part of winter, central\r\nIllinois pastures would be fully stocked with three and four year old\r\nbullocks, which were allowed to graze all through the winter and the\r\nfollowing spring and summer. About three acres of the rich blue grass\r\nwas allowed to a steer and on this they fattened rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"There are men now living in Missouri and Illinois who drove cattle\r\nfrom that vast breeding ground west of the Mississippi river, into\r\ncentral Illinois, for the cattle kings, Jacob Strawn and John T.\r\nAlexander. These herds, numbering about 300 to 400 head, grazed\r\nleisurely across the open country at about 15 miles or so a day. During\r\nthe war, the trade was more or less interrupted, but the practice\r\nwas continued until settlement and railroads rendered trailing both\r\nunnecessary and impossible.\r\n\r\n\"The annexation of Texas to the United States, and the discovery of\r\ngold in California in 1849, resulted in an influx of population and\r\ncapital that soon exerted a stimulating effect upon the production of\r\ncattle throughout the southwest, as well as beyond the Sierra Nevada\r\nMountains in the west.\r\n\r\n\"At a comparatively early date, there was a ready market for Illinois\r\nbred cattle to go to the states west of the Mississippi river to be\r\nused for breeding stock. The development of the range cattle industry\r\ncreated a strong demand for pure bred bulls, and cattle breeders of\r\nIllinois were called upon, perhaps to a greater extent than those of\r\nany other state in the Union, to supply this demand. The range cattle\r\nbusiness also created a market for young cows and heifers to be used\r\nfor breeding purposes. This demand steadily increased from year to\r\nyear, until a very large part of the yearly product of pure bred cattle\r\nin Illinois was absorbed for that purpose.\"[21]\r\n\r\n\"In 1880, the range cattle trade was yet in a transition stage,\r\nespecially as to the destination of marketable cattle and the special\r\nuse to which they were put. Before this time, the bulk of the range\r\ncattle trade was divided between the coming establishments of the west,\r\nslaughter for home consumption, for exportation as dressed carcasses\r\nto the eastern markets, and shipping on the hoof to eastern states as\r\nfeeders. Large feeding stables had been established in Nebraska for the\r\npurpose of feeding out these large numbers of rangers, but they could\r\nnot utilize all of them. The overflow of these grass fat rangers found\r\ntheir way to eastern feed lots to be finished on the grain of the corn\r\nbelt. The numbers increased from year to year, and extended farther and\r\nfather east as the numbers increased.\r\n\r\n\"The fact that one of the large feeding plants of Nebraska could\r\nturn off as many as 2000 ripe range steers in one month, gives some\r\nindication of the immense capacity of the range cattle trade.\r\n\r\n\"As the Indians were confined more closely from year to year, there\r\nwere more grazing lands opened up to be devoted to the raising of these\r\nrange cattle. Most people at this time, seeing the rapid increase of\r\nthe range industry, thought there would never be a beef famine as the\r\neconomists of the time predicted. They said such economists always look\r\non the dark side of things.\"[22]\r\n\r\n\"Not many had any adequate conception of the vastness of the cattle\r\ninterest in the great pasture region lying on the eastern slope of the\r\nRocky Mountains during the seventies and eighties. It was worth quite\r\na journey to see a single thousand head of these cattle engaged in\r\nfeeding together. To witness a drove of 4000 moving leisurely along at\r\na convenient distance from each other, to allow the animals to graze\r\nas they traveled a mile or so an hour, would seem to an unaccustomed\r\neye as if the herd must consist of tens of thousands. The appearance\r\nof such a drove as this might be recalled by a single transaction made\r\nby Dennis Sheedy of Colorado, who sold 27000 head of cattle to the\r\nOgalla Cattle Company. This company was composed of A. H. Swan, of\r\nCheyenne, Wyoming, William Paxton, of Omaha, Nebraska, and J. H. Bosler\r\nof Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The cattle were put on a range on the north\r\nside of the north Platte Run in Nebraska and Wyoming. The lumping price\r\nwas $30 per head, amounting to $810,000 for the entire lot.\"[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Texas Cattle_\r\n\r\n\"It will be no departure from the strictest truth to say that the\r\noldest known race of cattle on this continent is the Texas or Spanish\r\ncattle. They have been very generally popular with the stockmen of the\r\nplains, because they turned the free grass of the plains into available\r\ncash for their owners.\r\n\r\n\"The Texas cattle are truly the only animals except the bison that\r\ndeserve the name of \"Native\" American cattle. All the other scrubs in\r\nthe country are foreigners by blood, or are descendants of intruders\r\nfrom other lands. These long legged, big headed, thin fleshed brutes\r\nwere in this country centuries ago. It is by no means certain that\r\ntheir ancestors did not roam the plains of the Brazos and the Rio\r\nGrande a thousand years or more before America was visited by the\r\nSpaniards. There is evidence that the real ancestors of the cattle\r\nof Texas were seen in Old Mexico and described about five hundred\r\nyears after the Christian era, but this evidence has been considered\r\nunworthy of full confidence, because to admit its truth would be to\r\nconfess that the honor of first discovering America belongs to the\r\nbarbarians from the Orient.\r\n\r\n\"In the carefully edited official records, known as the \"Chinese\r\nYear Book\", which was written some fourteen hundred years ago, a\r\ncircumstantial account of a visit to Mexico by a party of Buddhist\r\nPriests is given. These priests saw in the country two breeds of\r\ncattle. One of these breeds was described as having very large horns\r\nwhich would hold ten measures. These were probably the earliest\r\nancestors of the present race of Texas cattle, while the other breed\r\nwith shorter horns was, it is likely, the ancestors of the bison that\r\nlater roamed over the ranges of the western plains. Those ancient\r\ntravelers were too well accustomed to seeing cattle and horses in\r\ntheir own country to be in even the slightest degree likely to mistake\r\nany other animal for kine. The generally accepted belief, however, is\r\nthat the Texas cattle are descendants of cattle brought to America by\r\nthe Spanish invaders, although no definite proof seems to have been\r\nbrought forward to show that those roistering, plundering explorers\r\never imported any cattle to this continent, and turned them loose in\r\nsuch numbers as would have produced the vast horde that covered the\r\nSouthwestern plains before the Civil War.\r\n\r\n\"To western people, especially in those parts where Spanish or\r\nTexas fever has caused the destruction of stock, Texas cattle are\r\nso well known that a description of their peculiarities will appear\r\nunnecessary. There are many who do not know that the chief purpose of\r\nthe Texas bullock, pure and simple, seems to be the lugging about\r\nof a prodigious pair of horns. To this end, a big head and coarse\r\nshoulders have been given him. Behind these are a flat ribbed, thin\r\nchested, light body, held up at the hinder end by a pair of cat hams on\r\nthin, deer-like legs. The whole outfit, unburdened by flesh or fat, is\r\nmuscular, nervous, and active. Such of them as lived through alternate\r\nroasting, starving, and freezing during the early years of their lives,\r\nfound their way to the northern markets to be fattened and slaughtered.\r\nThese rangers fattened very readily in the northern feed lots and those\r\nthat were not too old and tough made very good beef. Thousands of them\r\nwere driven from Texas in the early forties and fifties to Illinois\r\nfeed lots, where they were fattened and then re-driven to the markets\r\non the seaboard. In later years, they were slaughtered in Illinois and\r\nshipped in refrigerator cars, in the form of dressed carcasses, to the\r\nAtlantic States. Choice parts, as steaks, roasts, and tenderloins, were\r\nsent to health resorts, watering places, and to hotels and restaurants.\r\nA vast quantity of their flesh found its way into tin cans, to feed\r\nhungry humanity, in the hut of the laborer, at the picnic of the\r\naristocrat, in the camp of the miner, and in the forecastle of the\r\nsailor in every corner of the world. It will be seen that the mission\r\nof the Texas steer was to raise the standard of living, to add to the\r\ncomfort, and preserve the health and strength of people the world\r\nover.\"[24]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] The Breeder's Gazette, July 16, 1913.\r\n\r\n[22] Farm Field and Stockmen.\r\n\r\n[23] The Prairie Farmer, July 18, 1885, p. 453.\r\n\r\n[24] The Prairie Farmer, 1885, p. 452.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE PURE BRED INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the pure bred cattle industry in the state of Illinois\r\nwas antedated by the introduction of the mongrel bred cattle by a very\r\nnarrow margin of time. While there were probably a few mongrel bred\r\ncattle in the state before 1830, those that were brought in after that\r\ndate were the real foundation cattle. These cattle were brought from\r\nthe eastern states, by the early pioneers, for milk cows, and it is\r\ntheir descendants which are referred to when the native cattle of the\r\nstate are spoken of.\r\n\r\nThe changes which have been made from the mongrel bred cattle that\r\nwere brought into the state by the early settlers to the present day\r\nimproved breeds have been marked.\r\n\r\n\"For almost a century, attention has been given to the breeding of\r\npure bred cattle in Illinois. As early as 1833, a man by the name of\r\nJames Williams, brought some Shorthorn cattle of the Patten Stock,\r\nfrom Kentucky to Sangamon county. In 1834, J. D. Smith and J. N. Brown\r\nbrought a number of Shorthorns from Kentucky to the central part of the\r\nstate. In the spring of 1838, Colonel John Williams, a son of James\r\nWilliams, brought a Shorthorn bull and a Shorthorn cow from Lexington,\r\nNew York, into Sangamon county. These three importations of pure bred\r\nstock into Illinois were the earliest of which there are any records.\r\nOther importations of Shorthorns into the state were made at later\r\ndates, however, and they soon became the leading breed of cattle in the\r\nstate for both beef and dairy purposes.\"[25]\r\n\r\nThe rapid dissemination of Shorthorns throughout the state was probably\r\ndue chiefly to the method by which the breed was advertised. The\r\nleading breeders held public auction sales annually on their farms,\r\nor at some convenient place, and people all over the state were invited\r\nto come to these sales and bring such pure bred animals as they had for\r\nsale. In view of apprehensions on the part of some of the breeders,\r\nthat this method might tend to spread disease among the cattle, it\r\nbecame a rule to require that every contributor to a sale furnish a\r\ncertificate from a veterinarian, showing his cattle to be in good\r\nhealth, and that they had not been exposed to any contagious disease.\r\n\r\nShorthorns held full sway in the state until about 1865 or 1870, when\r\nthe tide began to turn. Other breeds began to be introduced into\r\nvarious parts of the state. Some of these breeds gained popularity so\r\nrapidly that within a very few years the competition became very keen\r\nbetween them and the Shorthorns. At the shows, all breeds were shown\r\nin the same class. This created considerable excitement among the\r\nenthusiastic advocates of the various breeds and often resulted in fist\r\nand skull fights.\r\n\r\n\"At the Chicago show in 1879, there was close competition among the\r\nbreeds when it come to tying the ribbon for sweepstakes award. Mr. F.\r\nL. Miller, a Hereford man, wanted to put the breeds to a slaughter\r\ntest. The other breeders refused to kill their pure bred cattle, but\r\nsome grades were slaughtered instead; one Shorthorn, one Hereford, and\r\none Devon.\"\r\n\r\n                  Herefords   Shorthorns   Devons\r\n\r\n  Gross Weight      1963        1795        1614\r\n  Net Weight        1317        1179        1055\r\n  Offal              452         389         394\r\n  Dressing per cent   67.1        65.7        65.3\r\n  Fore Quarters      354         308         277\r\n                     371         303         275\r\n  Hind Quarters      287         283         247\r\n                     305         285         256\r\n  Tallow             178         155         145\r\n  Hide               106          90          99\r\n  Head                55          47          49\r\n\r\nNeither of these steers had marbled flesh. One family who ate some of\r\none of the steers was said to have been made sick, due to the excessive\r\nfatness.\r\n\r\nThe feeders of this time gave very little or no attention to the\r\nmarbling of meat. All they noted was whether an animal was getting\r\nfat or not. They didn't notice whether they were putting the fat on\r\nevenly.[26]\r\n\r\nFrom the very earliest improvement of cattle in Illinois, Shorthorn\r\nblood has been used more extensively than that of any other breed. They\r\nwere the first pure bred cattle brought into the state and were the\r\nonly pure bred cattle in the state for several years. They were more\r\ngenerally known by farmers throughout the state and at a very early\r\ndate were found in almost every county.\r\n\r\nHereford cattle have ranked next to Shorthorns, both in number and\r\npopularity.\r\n\r\n\"About 1870, Herefords began to play an important part in beef\r\nproduction in this state, and it was only a few years after this time\r\nthat they were taken into Sangamon county, where Shorthorns had first\r\ngotten their strong hold.\"[27]\r\n\r\n\"The competition between the Herefords and the Shorthorns grew stronger\r\neach year. In February of 1885, the Shorthorn Breeders' Association,\r\nin session, decided to ask each member to contribute fifteen cents for\r\neach Shorthorn owned by him, to be used for the good of the Shorthorn\r\ninterest. The rivalry between the different breeds of cattle was so\r\nsharply defined and closely pressed that they thought it indispensable\r\nto the protection and prosperity of the Shorthorn interest and thought\r\nthe State Association of Shorthorn Breeders should be kept in an active\r\nand strong existence.\"[28]\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of reports gathered by the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry in 1885, by sending out questionnaires to different parts\r\nof the state, showing the breed of cattle that has been used moot\r\nextensively in cattle improvement.\r\n\r\n_State as a Whole_\r\n\r\n  No. Reports       Breed Used\r\n\r\n        240         Shorthorns\r\n         80         Herefords\r\n         28         Angus\r\n         17         Devons\r\n\r\n_State by Sections_\r\n\r\n  Northwest    27         Shorthorns\r\n  Counties      9         Herefords\r\n                5         Angus\r\n\r\n  Northern     34         Shorthorns\r\n  Counties     13         Herefords\r\n                5         Angus\r\n                4         Devons\r\n                2         Galloways\r\n\r\n  Western      32         Shorthorns\r\n  Counties      8         Herefords\r\n                5         Angus\r\n                4         Devons\r\n                3         Galloways\r\n\r\n  Central      55         Shorthorns\r\n  Counties     20         Herefords\r\n                3         Angus\r\n                1         Red Polled\r\n\r\n  Western      20         Shorthorns\r\n  Counties     14         Herefords\r\n                7         Angus\r\n\r\n  Southwest     9         Shorthorns\r\n  Counties      1         Herefords\r\n                1         Angus\r\n\r\n  Southern     44         Shorthorns\r\n  Counties      6         Herefords\r\n                3         Devons\r\n                1         Dutch Belted\r\n\r\n  Southeast    10         Shorthorns\r\n  Counties      2         Herefords\r\n                2         Devons\r\n\r\n\r\n_T. L. Miller_\r\n\r\n\"Early in the \"seventies,\" Mr. T. L. Miller, than a business man in\r\nChicago, who owned a farm at Beecher, Will county, Illinois, became\r\ninterested in Hereford cattle.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Miller was born at Middletown, Connecticut, on April 7, 1817.\r\nIn 1842, he went to Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, where he was in business\r\nuntil 1856, when he removed to Chicago, Illinois. Here he was in the\r\nfire insurance business until about 1870. He had bought the first 320\r\nacres of his farm at Beecher and 207 acres three miles to the north.\r\nHe commenced to improve the farm with buildings in 1862. His nearest\r\nrailroad station then was Monee, on the Illinois Central. In 1870,\r\nthe Chicago, Danville, and Vincennes Railroad, was built, and Mr.\r\nMiller bought about 340 acres of additional land to the west of that\r\nalready acquired and laid out the village of Beecher. He closed out his\r\nbusiness in Chicago and went to live on this \"Highland Stock Farm\" in\r\nMarch, 1870. A few years later, he laid the foundation for his herd of\r\nHereford cattle.\r\n\r\nMr. William Powell, an Englishman, who later on bred and handled\r\nHerefords extensively on his own account both in Illinois and Texas,\r\nwas jointly interested with Mr. Miller in some of his earlier ventures\r\nin Herefords. An item in the \"National Live Stock Journal\" for\r\nFebruary, 1872, reads as follows: \"We learn that Messrs. Byers and\r\nCampbell, of Nevada, Ohio, have sold to Messrs. T. L. Miller and Wm.\r\nPowell of Highland Stock Farm, Beecher, Will county, Illinois, an\r\nindividual half interest in three Hereford cows and two bulls, and\r\nthirty-six pure bred Cotswold sheep. Mr. Miller's farm soon afterward\r\nbecame the center of the greatest American activity in the Hereford\r\ntrade.\"[29]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thomas Clark_\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Clark was born in Herefordshire, England, near the Monmouth\r\nborder, in 1842. His father was a cattle grower of local repute, who\r\nused pure bred Hereford bulls, but did not profess to be a handler of\r\npedigreed strains. Thomas Clark came to the United States in the spring\r\nof 1866, and after working for a time on a farm near Pittsfield, Ohio,\r\nwas employed by a Cleveland butcher having a large city trade. Thrifty\r\nand possessed of an inborn faith in the \"white faces\" of his native\r\nland, by dint of hard work and economy in the course of a few years,\r\nClark found himself in a position to get into business in a small way\r\non his own account. As foreman and cutter in Cleveland, he acquired\r\na practical familiarity with what lies under a bullock's hide, that\r\nwas of distinct advantage in his subsequent career as a breeder and\r\nfeeder of good cattle. He had an interest in his brother-in-laws little\r\nbutcher shop in Elyra, but his own fondness for the fields led him to\r\ngive most of his time to the 80 acres he had under lease near town. He\r\nmoved on this farm and began breeding Hereford cattle. He bought his\r\nfirst bull, Sir Arthur (705), as a calf, from F. W. Stone of Canada.\r\n\r\n\"In 1877, when Mr. Clark's lease on the Ohio farm expired, seeing that\r\nthe west was becoming a good market for Herefords, he decided to\r\nremove to Beecher, Illinois. He had shown every year at the Ohio fairs,\r\nand always won. He made one show at Erie, Pennsylvania, while breeding\r\nin Ohio, and another at Jackson, Michigan, in 1876, winning first prize\r\non herd, in competition with seven Shorthorn and Devon herds. This was\r\nthe first time Herefords had won that prize in Michigan, and the event\r\ncaused a lot of controversy. Clark had, meantime, sold three calves to\r\nT. L. Miller and delivered them personally. He was impressed with the\r\nidea that Illinois would be a better location for his cattle business\r\nthan Ohio. He bought 80 acres of land, about one and one-fourth miles\r\nfrom the village of Beecher. He afterward added forty acres to the\r\nhome farm, and subsequently, bought twenty-six acres in addition. Mr.\r\nClark always kept his own lands largely in grass, and leased fields\r\nfor farming purposes. He brought his Ohio herd, numbering at that time\r\nabout twenty-eight head, to Beecher.\r\n\r\n\"In 1877, Mr. Clark showed a herd at the northern Ohio Fair at\r\nCleveland, winning all prizes shown for.\"[30]\r\n\r\n(1857) \"There is no question but what the native cattle of the state\r\nmay be improved by successive generations of judicious breeding, but\r\nif in and in-breeding is followed, as at present, the effects will be\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\n\"The true comparison between native steers and improved steers is seen\r\nwhen they are put on the market. Shorthorn and Hereford steers at\r\nweaning time are worth about $15, while the native steers at weaning\r\ntime are worth about $5. The Shorthorn and the Hereford steers\r\ncould be made to go to the New York market weighing around 1800 to\r\n2000 pounds gross, and sell for 12 cents to 15 cents per pound, while\r\nthe native steers were sent to market at six or seven years of age,\r\nweighing from 900 to 1000 pounds, and sold for 10 to 12 cents per pound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The Illinois Cattle Importing Company received a shipment of 38\r\nShorthorn cattle from Europe.\"[31]\r\n\r\n\"Messrs. Calef and Jacoby at Springfield, Illinois, sold at auction,\r\nMarch 23, fifteen head of cows and heifers, all Shorthorns. Two of the\r\nnumber were imported. They reached an average of $583. They also sold\r\neight Shorthorn bulls which averaged $171.98 each.\"[32]\r\n\r\n\"Messrs. H. E Gardner of Bradfordton, Illinois, and J. S. Highmore of\r\nRochester, Illinois, sold 30 Shorthorn cows and heifers at the Sangamon\r\nCounty Fair Grounds. The total number brought $3,140. Average of the\r\ncows was $104.66. They also sold 14 bulls for $10.20. The highest price\r\npaid in the sale was $280 for a cow. The total sale for cows and bulls\r\namounted to $4,160, an average of $95.54. L. C. Carlin of Edinburg,\r\nIllinois, bought a bull for $100. Philimon Stuart of Cotton Hill,\r\nIllinois, bought one for $100 also.\r\n\r\n\"In the afternoon of the same day, D. W. Smith of Bates, Illinois, sold\r\nfive cows and heifers for $770, an average of $154; also three bulls\r\nsold for $710, an average of $236.66. The total of the cows was $1,480.\r\nThe highest cow sold to Lafayette Funk of Shirley, Illinois, for $2.30.\r\nThe highest bull sold to George M. Caldwell, Williamsville, Illinois,\r\nfor $300.\"[33]\r\n\r\n\"Rossland Park Stock Farm at Ashkum, Illinois: The farm is 73 miles\r\nsouth of Chicago, on the Illinois Central Railroad, in Iroquois county.\r\nIt is composed of 120 acres of deep, dark prairie soil.\r\n\r\n\"This farm was first owned by Mrs. Ross of Chicago, who gave very\r\nlittle attention to it and allowed it to become badly run down. It was\r\nthen purchased by G. W. Henry of Chicago, who at once set about to\r\nimprove it. He put a new fence around the entire farm and prepared it\r\nto be kept as a grazing farm for cattle.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Henry was a Shorthorn enthusiast and bred Shorthorns until 1884,\r\nwhen he became interested in Herefords. High grade and pure bred\r\nHerefords had his attention then for two or three years, after which\r\nhe decided to deal in none but pure-breds. He sold his entire lot of\r\ngrades. R. W. Hollenbeak of Casey, Iowa, purchased 73 of the two year\r\nolds at $75 a head; 25 high grade one year old at $50 a head; one\r\nyearling grade bull at $75; and 49 young grade calves at $40 a head.\r\n\r\n\"There were left on the farm about 150 pure bred Herefords which\r\nsoon were increased enormously by using some valuable bulls as herd\r\nheaders.\"[34]\r\n\r\n\"The \"Summit Farm\", owned by Mr. Wentworth, comprises about 4000 acres,\r\nwhich is mostly prairie. He has on his farm 80 Shorthorns. He has some\r\nyearling heifers by the son of \"Booth's Lancaster\", which are very\r\npromising. He also owns the \"Fifteenth Duke of Ardie\" who still holds\r\nhis place as one of the grandest Bates bulls in existence.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wentworth feeds mangles in connection with hay.\"[35]\r\n\r\n\"The Polled Aberdeen Angus herd, belonging to Messrs. Anderson and\r\nFindley, of Lake Forest, Illinois, is one of the oldest herds in the\r\nUnited States, and is probably the largest of any in the United States\r\nor Scotland.\"[36]\r\n\r\n\"Our first importation was made in the summer of 1878, and consisted of\r\nthe bull Nicolis 1102, and the five females: Jeannie Gordon 2914, Lazy\r\n3rd 1100, Violet of Brucehill 1951, Diana 4th 3226, and Waterside Fancy\r\n1854, and thus was established the first breeding herd of Aberdeen\r\nAngus cattle in the United States so far as we know. The cattle in this\r\nimportation did so well with us that we were induced to make further\r\nimportations, and the cattlemen of this country readily recognized the\r\nsuperiority of the breed, and with proverbial American go-aheadness,\r\ntook hold of them at once. Such was the demand for animals of this\r\nbreed in the early eighties that we found ready sale for them at prices\r\nalmost beyond the reach of cattlemen of moderate means. We, together\r\nwith other importers, drew upon the parent stock in Scotland to such an\r\nextent about this time that the straining point was soon reached and\r\nprices rapidly advanced in that country also.\r\n\r\n\"The land at Lake Forest, Illinois, upon which for so many years we\r\nmaintained our herd, was constantly appreciating in value, until it is\r\nnow (1901) worth about four hundred per cent more than when we first\r\nestablished our herd there. We were, therefore, compelled to move our\r\nherd into cheaper lands, and this we began to do about 1894, and in\r\n1897, practically all of our herd had been transferred to our Allendale\r\nFarm, in Allen county, Kansas. We purchased most of the land composing\r\nAllendale Farm in 1878, and have improved and added to it since until\r\nnow, we have over 2000 acres, making as fine a place for the breeding\r\nof fine stock and the fattening of cattle as can be found in the\r\ncountry.\"[37]\r\n\r\n\"The Illinois Cattle Breeders' Association was organized in 1895. The\r\nfirst annual meeting was held at Springfield, on January 13, 1896. Mr.\r\nJ. Frank Prather presided at this meeting. Mr. J. H. Pickrell was the\r\nfirst secretary. A committee was appointed to draft by-laws.\r\n\r\n\"The first paper on the program was \"Home and Foreign Demand for Beef\r\nCattle\" by A. C. Howell, the editor of the Drover's Journal. The paper\r\nwas read by the secretary, Mr. Pickrell.

CATTLE PLAGUES[38]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In 1882, Dr. Salmon of the Bureau of Animal Industry, became\r\nconvinced, from the experimental evidence at his command, that certain\r\ndisease germs produced a chemical substance during their growth and\r\nmultiplication which, if injected into the tissues of an animal, would\r\ninduce immunity from a disease that these germs cause. In other words,\r\nhe thought that the liquid in which the bacteria were grown in the\r\nlaboratory might be used after the bacteria had been killed or removed,\r\nto protect animals from the disease caused by these specific bacteria.\r\n\r\n\"The first experiment made at that time with fowl cholera failed to\r\nconfirm the theory. Later experiments with hog cholera bacillus gave\r\nunmistakable proof of its correctness. The results were first published\r\nin 1886 and additional evidence was published the following year.\r\n\r\n\"Many cattlemen have been prejudiced against the tuberculin test\r\nand have objected to it, due to inaccurate or greatly exaggerated\r\nstatements as to the damage it caused to the cattle on which it\r\nwas used. Those who have had most experience with tuberculin have\r\nconsequently failed to observe any injurious effects following its\r\ninjection into healthy cattle. With cattle that are affected with\r\ntuberculosis, it produces a fever which lasts only a short time, and in\r\nthe great majority of cases, the effects disappear within forty-eight\r\nhours after the administration of the tuberculin. The cases of abortion\r\nfollowing the tuberculin test have not been numerous, even when cows\r\nwere tested within a very short time before the normal time of\r\ncalving. The few cases that have occurred may be explained by the fact\r\nthat abortion in cattle is a very common occurrence and that it would\r\nhave happened even though the test had not been applied and that it was\r\na coincidence.\r\n\r\n\"From the investigations and observations made, the following\r\nconclusions may be safely drawn:\r\n\r\n\"1. The tuberculin test is an accurate method of determining the\r\npresence of tuberculosis in an animal.\r\n\r\n\"2. By the use of tuberculin such animals as are affected with the\r\ndisease may be detected and removed from the herd.\r\n\r\n\"3. It has no injurious effects.\r\n\r\n\"4. Comparatively small numbers of cattle which have aborted, suffered\r\nill health, or fell off in flesh after the tuberculin test was made,\r\nwere either diseased before the test was made or were affected by some\r\nother cause other than that of the tuberculin.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the 15th day of July, 1884, Dr. Trumbower was requested to visit\r\na cow at Sterling, Illinois, belonging to Mr. C. A. Keefer. He found\r\none of Mr. Keefer's pure bred Jersey cows, aged about six years, with\r\nsymptoms of pleuro-pneumonia.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Keefer had bought this cow, Lass O' Lowrie, from Mr. W. C. Clark,\r\nof Geneva, Illinois, on June 6, of the same year. When Mr. Keefer\r\nvisited Mr. Clark's farm on April 6, he saw Lass O' Lowrie with two\r\nother cows, Tama Warren, and Nutriena Tunlaw. All three of the cows had\r\nthe appearance of unthriftiness, the hair was looking rough and dry,\r\nbut this was attributed to a severe winter without proper care and,\r\nin the case of Lass O' Lowrie, to recent calving. Mr. Keefer bought\r\nher with the assurance that she was perfectly healthy. She was shipped\r\nJune 8 and was on the road four hours. When she was driven from the car\r\nto Mr. Keefer's farm, she was noticed to cough occasionally. She had\r\ncalved in March and was again pregnant. From the time Mr. Keefer bought\r\nher, she became poorer, weaker, and milk secretion became entirely\r\nsuspended. She stood in the field away from the other cattle and ceased\r\nruminating. Coughing increased in frequency and strings of mucus\r\ndropped from the nostrils.\r\n\r\nThe case was thought to be one of tuberculosis and isolation was\r\nrecommended, slaughter and burial to follow as soon as possible upon\r\nthe necessity of the measure. On the morning of June 8, she was bled to\r\ndeath. On examination, the anterior lobe of the right lung was found\r\nfilled with tubercles covering a space of four inches in diameter.\r\nThey presented different stages of development; some containing a\r\nthick yellow inspissated pus, while others were undergoing a caseous\r\ndegeneration or calcification, and still others appeared as small\r\nindurated brown or reddish circumscribed spots in the interlobular\r\ntissue. Beginning at the bifurcation of the trachea and extending\r\ndownward and backward, was found a cavity about ten inches in length,\r\nwhich contained a pint of fluid of a grayish-black color and of very\r\noffensive odor, holding in suspension disintegrated lung tissue; also\r\nin this cavity was found a mass of inforcated lung tissue weighing\r\ntwo pounds. The part nearest the right lung was breaking down and\r\nliquifying. Another mass of dead lung, weighing four ounces, of a\r\nyellow, granular, or caseous appearance, indicating that it was much\r\nolder than the larger mass, was found lying in and partially buried\r\nin a separate sack which communicated with the larger cavity. In the\r\nabdominal lymphatic glands these were masses of compact tuberculous\r\nmatter encysted in strong fibrous capsules, one of which measured three\r\ninches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe cow had evidently been affected with tuberculosis, but the encysted\r\nmass of dead lung was a lesion which is not produced in this disease,\r\nbut which is a frequent result of contagious pleuro-pneumonia. It\r\nseemed possible that this animal had both of the diseases at the same\r\ntime, although the fact that pleuro-pneumonia was not known to exist in\r\nthat part of the country made it appear very doubtful.\r\n\r\nUpon investigating the conditions of affairs at Mr. Clarke's farm,\r\nit was learned that his animals had suffered from a disease that had\r\ncaused the death of several during the spring and summer. A cow which\r\nhad been sold to C. P. Coggeshall and taken to the farm of Mr. John\r\nBoyd, of Elmhurst, was very sick, and a second cow bought by Mr. Boyd\r\nwas also sick. Mr. Boyd's farm was visited on August 12. The cow called\r\nCream Ecca, belonging to Mr. Coggeshall had died on July 20. The cow,\r\nEdith St. Hilaire, had improved very much during the two weeks previous\r\nto the visit and was then believed by her owner to be nearly well. An\r\nexamination of the lungs of Cream Ecca showed them to be hepatized as\r\nin pleuro-pneumonia.\r\n\r\nThese facts appeared sufficient to justify the diagnosis of contagious\r\npleuro-pneumonia, but in the absence of any history beyond the Clarke\r\nherd, and considering the fact that the only cow of which a careful\r\npost-mortem examination had been made was certainly affected with\r\ntuberculosis, it seemed best to reserve a decision until more complete\r\nevidence had been obtained.\r\n\r\nOn August 14, Mr. George B. Loring made a third visit to Elmherst Farm,\r\nand in the presence of Mr. J. H. Sanders, a member of the Treasury\r\nCattle Commission, and Mr. Wadham, and Mr. Boyd, the two sick cows were\r\nslaughtered. An examination of the lungs of Edith St. Hilaire showed\r\nthat she had every symptom of pleuro-pneumonia. The other cow, Dassie\r\n4th, was likewise examined with the same indications of the disease.\r\n\r\nOn August 15, Mr. Loring, the agricultural commissioner, went to\r\nGeneva, Illinois, and examined the conditions of the animals that were\r\nstill on Mr. Clarke's farm. Mr. Clarke informed Mr. Loring that the\r\nfirst animal to show signs of the disease on his farm was the bull,\r\nFinis Lawrence, which became sick during the latter part of May and\r\nwas killed in June. The cows, Ella Lawrence, Duchess of Broome County,\r\nMyrrhine, and Damask, all showed signs of sickness about the middle of\r\nJune. Ella Lawrence was killed at the same time as the bull; Duchess of\r\nBroome County died; Myrrhine and Damask recovered and were on the farm\r\nat the time the examination was made. Tama Warren had also been killed,\r\nbut Mr. Clarke insisted that this was because she was worthless as a\r\nbreeder. Six animals in all had been killed or had died on Mr. Clarke's\r\nplace since May. According to accounts received from other sources, it\r\nis probably that Tama Warren and Nutrina of Tunlaw were sick as early\r\nas April 6.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke had brought on his place since June 1, one animal from New\r\nJersey, three which he had purchased at the Epler sale at Virginia,\r\nIllinois, one from C. A. Keefer, of Sterling, Illinois, and several\r\nfrom Wisconsin. It was impossible to judge, from any information that\r\nMr. Clarke could give, in what manner the disease had been brought\r\nto his place. As Ella Lawrence had come from Peoria, and as there\r\nwere rumors of the disease at that place, it was decided to make\r\ninvestigations there.\r\n\r\nOn August 16, Mr. Loring visited Messrs. D. H. and S. S. Tripp, and Mr.\r\nO. J. Bailey at Peoria. These gentlemen admitted that they had lost\r\nanimals from some disease, the nature of which they did not understand,\r\nand they freely placed at Mr. Loring's disposal all the information\r\nwhich they could obtain, bearing upon the matter. It was here that Mr.\r\nLoring gained a first insight into the history of the introduction of\r\nthe disease into Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe first cases of this disease occurred in the Tripp herd, and the\r\nonly animals that had been brought upon their place for several months\r\nbefore this sickness were three cows purchased at the Virginia sale,\r\nwhich occurred February 21. These cows, Helena, Rex, Albert's Pansy,\r\nand Fancy LeBrocq, were taken to Mr. Tripp's stable in Peoria, and\r\nafterward Helen Rex was taken to his farm, which is situated about two\r\nmiles from the city. It was said that Helen Rex was coughing at the\r\ntime of the sale at Virginia, and that she did not appear to be in good\r\nhealth, but Mr. Tripp either did not notice this or was not impressed\r\nwith the idea that she was affected at all seriously. The first cow\r\nthat showed unmistakable evidence of the disease was Pomare, a cow kept\r\nfor family use in the town stable. The earliest symptoms were noticed\r\nwith her on April 1, and she died April 17. No other cases of the\r\ndisease occurred until July 12, when the cow, Annos Orphan, presented\r\nthe symptoms of inflammation of the lungs and died July 27. The next\r\ncase occurred July 25, when a cow called Queenette showed that she was\r\naffected. She died August 4. No disease had been in Messrs. Tripp's\r\nherd nor in any other cattle in the vicinity previous to the purchase\r\nof the three animals at Mr. Epler's sale at Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe first sickness in Mr. Bailey's herd occurred May 10. The first cow\r\naffected, Lady Florentia, had been in his stable in Peoria up to this\r\ntime, when she was taken to his farm seven miles in the country. This\r\ncow had not been in actual contact with any of Mr. Tripp's cattle, and\r\nthe only way in which the disease could be accounted for in her was\r\nthat it had been carried by some person going from one stable to the\r\nother. This cow recovered from the disease but several others of the\r\nsame herd died within a few days after taking the disease. On August\r\n18, a cow was killed and examined in the presence of Dr. J. H. Rauch,\r\nSecretary of the State Board of Health, and Dr. N. H. Pooren, State\r\nVeterinarian, both of whom had been invited to be present in order that\r\nthey might see the disease and be convinced of its nature.\r\n\r\nMr. Epler's place at Virginia, Cass county, Illinois, was visited\r\nAugust 22. No animals were found showing symptoms of the disease, and\r\nMr. Epler stated that he had lost none from his original herd since\r\nthe sale, but a cow which he had bought at Beardstown, Illinois, and\r\nbrought to his place in April or May, which died in June of an acute\r\nlung disease that evidently was pleuro-pneumonia. A cow sold to Porter\r\nYates, of Springfield, Illinois, at Mr. Epler's sale, was attacked\r\nby the disease and died in April. Another cow sold to E. S. Hodson, of\r\nSpringfield, soon after her arrival was treated for a similar disease.\r\nAnother cow sold to Frank Gaston, of Normal, Illinois, became sick\r\nApril 6, but recovered.\r\n\r\nAs very many of the cattle sold at the Epler sale soon afterward became\r\naffected with pleuro-pneumonia, and as the mingling of the animals\r\nat the sale was the only means by which many of these herds could be\r\nconnected, it became very certain that the disease in Illinois had\r\nbeen brought to the state with some animals that had been sent to Mr.\r\nEpler. The animals which he had collected for this sale had come from\r\na number of different herds located at widely separated points. Upon\r\ninvestigation, it was found that only one of these herds had been\r\naffected with pleuro-pneumonia. That herd belonged to Mr. C. R. C.\r\nDye, of Troy, Ohio. Mr. Epler had purchased five cows from Mr. Dye on\r\nDecember 28, 1883. These cows arrived at Mr. Epler's farm at Virginia,\r\nIllinois January 4, 1884. Two of the five cows purchased from Mr. Dye\r\nhad been previously bought from the herd of James Lyman, of Downer's\r\nGrove, Illinois, in May, 1883. Mr. Dye had bought cattle from several\r\nfarms in the east, but it was decided that the disease had been brought\r\nto his herd by some grade Jerseys which he bought in the vicinity of\r\nBaltimore, Maryland. One of these cows had, apparently, recovered from\r\nthe disease, but was still able to communicate the disease which was\r\nafterwards determined.\r\n\r\nThe steps taken to eradicate the dreadful disease were as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Investigation to determine the existence of pleuro-pneumonia in any\r\nsuspected locality in the country.\r\n\r\n(2) The immediate quarantine and isolation of any herd in which the\r\ndisease was found. If any considerable amount of the disease was found\r\nin any section of the country so as to be dangerous of spreading\r\nto other districts, the immediate quarantine of that district was\r\nenforced, as well as the prohibition of the movement of any animals\r\nfrom one herd or premises to any other within the district, or of\r\nany cattle to be upon any highway or any enclosed land within such\r\ndistrict; provided, however, that animals might be moved, upon a\r\nwritten permit, signed by an inspector of the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry. As soon as the quarantine order had been made, the immediate\r\ninspection, tagging, and numbering of every bovine animal in the\r\ndistrict, and the keeping of a record of the same, and a record of all\r\nanimals moved by permits was attended to so that the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry might have complete control of the movements of all cattle\r\nwithin the quarantined districts.\r\n\r\n(3) The condemnation and slaughter of all animals found to be diseased\r\nor exposed to the disease within the quarantined districts, and the\r\nthorough disinfection of all premises where such animals had been,\r\nor on which contagious was suspected to exist. At the same time,\r\ninspection and post-mortem examinations were made of every animal\r\nslaughtered during the quarantine, whether purchased and slaughtered by\r\norder of the Bureau of Animal Industry or killed by butchers, or others\r\nfor their own use.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[38] Report of Bureau of Animal Industry, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. THE FEED INDUSTRY OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sixty years ago (1853) there was no knowledge of scientific feeding\r\nin the United States. Sixty years ago there was no feed industry in\r\nthe United States. Thirty years ago (1883) the teaching of scientific\r\nfeeding in the United States began. Thirty years ago the feed industry\r\nin the United States began. When I say that sixty years ago there was\r\nno feed industry in the United States, I mean that there was no feed\r\nindustry such as we of the present day apply to the term. At that\r\ntime, the population of the United States was only one-fourth what it\r\nis today. The problem of feeding domestic animals, as well as human\r\nbeings, was simplicity itself, in fact it was not a problem. We had\r\nmore land than we knew what to do with. The owner of livestock raised\r\nmore grain and more hay and had more pasturage than he had animals to\r\nconsume or than he had a market for. Domestic animals were fed on the\r\nnatural grains and hays, grown upon the same farms as themselves. The\r\ncity or town owner of horses or livestock bought his feed stuffs mostly\r\ndirect from the farmer who grew them. By-product materials of the\r\ngreatest feeding value, while produced in far smaller quantities than\r\nat the present day, were not sufficiently appreciated nor sufficiently\r\nneeded to cause the farmer to make the effort to haul them from the\r\nmill or factory to his farm, much less to buy them. Scientific feeding\r\nwith a knowledge of the balanced ration had not as yet been taught in\r\nour state universities. The value of grinding the natural grains was\r\nonly slightly understood and was practiced only in a very limited way\r\nby a few of the more progressive and thoughtful feeders. Flour mills\r\nexperienced the greatest difficulty in finding a market for their bran\r\nand middlings. While these by-products were probably the first to be\r\nrecognized as of great feeding value, yet hundreds of thousands of tons\r\nwere sold for a few dollars a ton, or burned, or run into streams,\r\nfor there was no market. Cottonseed meal as a feeding stuff was at\r\nthat time unknown. Holes were dug into the ground at the cotton gins\r\nand the seed was buried as a means of getting rid of it. Distillers'\r\nand brewers' grains, starch factory by-products, molasses, oatmeal\r\nby-products, oat clippings, and many others were frequently piled up on\r\nvacant lots to decay or run into the streams, or given to such farmers\r\nas could be induced to haul them away, and the earliest practical use\r\nof them was by the manufacturers who fed cattle with them in their\r\nwet or underground state at the factories. No attempt was made to dry\r\nthem or put them into form to be utilized commercially. Instead of\r\nbeing sources of great revenue to the manufacturer, they were, in many\r\ninstances, the cause of great expense. Because of the waste and expense\r\nand the low prices realized, the cost of the main products--the food\r\nfor human beings--was very greatly increased.\"[39]\r\n\r\n\"Here is a fact worth careful noting, that in these days of close\r\ncompetition, every cent realized for a by-product is credited to\r\nthe cost of producing the main product--the human food--and that in\r\naddition to itself being converted into additional food for man, that\r\nis, into meat, dairy products, poultry, eggs, etc., its sale operates\r\ndirectly in a very large way as a saving to the consumer upon the\r\nmain product from which it is derived. In other words, there is only\r\none profit figured, and that is upon the main product--the food for\r\nman--the by-product being figured solely as such, sold for what it will\r\nbring, and the returns credited to the cost in figuring cost prices for\r\nthe main product.\r\n\r\n\"The problem of feeding the world--much less the problem of feeding\r\nthe people of the United States--had not as yet commenced to trouble\r\nthe scientist, the statesman, or the business man of the day. No one\r\nexpected that in the short space of sixty years, all of our available\r\nlands would be occupied and that our population would have increased\r\nfrom 31,000,000 to 91,000,000 people, and that the problem of the\r\ncost of living, the cost of food, would, during the lives of people\r\nthen living, be the thought and problem uppermost in the minds of\r\nour people.
