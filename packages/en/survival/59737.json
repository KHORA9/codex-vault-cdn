and minerals which they find on\r\ntheir farms, in excavations, and while on their vacation trips. Some of\r\nthe specimens are unusual in shape or appearance, some are crystalline\r\nand beautiful, some may be ores of economic importance, but many simply\r\narouse the curiosity of the finder.\r\n\r\nMany of these specimens are received each year at the University at\r\nColumbia, and each is usually accompanied by a request for information\r\non the correct name for the specimen, its composition, its commercial\r\nvalue, and the manner of its formation.\r\n\r\nFrequently the requests include questions of a broader geological\r\nnature, or seek the recommendation of a general, easily-read book\r\nwritten on rocks and minerals which may be purchased at a book store or\r\nconsulted at a library. Moreover, many persons ask how they may\r\ndetermine for themselves the geological specimens which they have\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nThis little booklet has been prepared with the intention of answering\r\nthe questions most commonly asked by citizens of the state about\r\nMissouri rocks and minerals.\r\n\r\nDescriptions and photographs of Missouri rock and mineral occurrences\r\nare provided, and essential facts about the geological conditions of\r\ntheir formation are simply told. A determinative key is supplied in\r\norder that the reader may identify and name most of the common specimens\r\nwhich he collects within the state (and elsewhere, also). No special\r\ndeterminative equipment will be suggested, and only non-technical\r\nlanguage will be employed because the chief objective here is to furnish\r\na useful, understandable geological account of the _common_ Missouri\r\nrocks and minerals to the average person without geological training. In\r\nfact, for the purposes of identification no differentiation is made\r\nbetween mineral and rock, although the professional geologist does\r\nseparate them in definition. For our purpose, a rock is an aggregate of\r\nmineral particles, but a mineral is a substance (without life) having\r\nmore definite and constant properties than a rock. For those interested\r\nfurther, more technical and more nearly correct definitions, with\r\nexplanations, are given at the back, on page 74.\r\n\r\nThe rarer minerals and those requiring special equipment for\r\ndetermination may be sent to the Department of Geology of the University\r\nof Missouri at Columbia for identification free of charge.[1]\r\n\r\nNames used locally, and sometimes incorrectly from a strictly technical\r\nsense, for rocks and minerals will follow the generally accepted names,\r\nand both will be duplicated in the index at the back of the pamphlet to\r\nfacilitate finding either one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DETERMINATIVE KEY\r\n\r\n\r\nA rock or mineral specimen which is unfamiliar to the collector may be\r\nidentified by using the information in this booklet in either of two\r\nways: (1) the reader may turn through the pages and compare his specimen\r\nwith the photographs of others named there and read their descriptions\r\nuntil he finds a match for his specimen; or (2), the better way, he may\r\nclassify his specimen first by the use of the determinative key which\r\nfollows and be directed thereby to the pages in the book for\r\nconfirmation of the name by the photographs, description, and discussion\r\nof the substance. The writer recommends the second method and has\r\nprepared this booklet on the assumption that the determinative key will\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\nThe simplest and probably the best means of separating specimens of\r\ndifferent rocks and minerals is on the basis of hardness, which means\r\n_resistance to scratching_. Crushing strength is different from\r\nhardness; therefore, in testing for hardness, do not attempt to\r\npulverize. Merely determine if the specimen can be scratched with the\r\nsubstance indicated.\r\n\r\nDetermination of the mark or “streak” of a mineral when rubbed on a hard\r\nwhite rock or unglazed porcelain is demonstrated in the photograph on\r\npage 56.\r\n\r\n  A.

It occurs in thin slabs, thick\r\nlayers, and in massive beds which may make a small cliff in themselves.\r\nLimestone is soft enough to be scratched with steel. It is commonly\r\nwhite to grayish, but may be stained tan, yellowish, or reddish by iron\r\noxide, or darkened through shades of gray to black by the presence of\r\nvery finely-divided, black carbonaceous matter. It may be\r\nmicroscopically fine-grained (and then it can be used in lithographic\r\nprinting in the reproduction of very fine images), or its grains may\r\nvary in size up to one-half inch in cross section.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Limestone (dolomite) bluff near Jefferson City.]\r\n\r\nIt is determined as limestone with certainty by wetting with dilute cold\r\nacid; then it “bubbles” or effervesces, and eventually dissolves\r\nentirely. Ordinary or regular limestone contains the mineral calcite,\r\nbut the magnesian variety of limestone, dolomite, contains the mineral\r\ndolomite, which does not effervesce freely in lump size in dilute acid,\r\nbut which does effervesce when _powdered_ or when treated with hot acid\r\nor concentrated acid. The preferred acid to use is muriatic\r\n(hydrochloric, the “not-cut” soldering acid) diluted one part of acid to\r\none part of water. Caution! This acid mixture should be stored in a\r\nglass or porcelain container away from children or animals! Acid strong\r\nenough to dissolve rock will ruin clothes, destroy flesh, and is\r\npoisonous! Dilute sulphuric (storage battery) acid will also give the\r\neffervescence test, and the acid of very strong vinegar will react with\r\nlimestone slowly. In making the test it should be recognized that the\r\nlimestone which acts as a cement in sandstone, or limestone impurities\r\nin shale will also effervesce, but those minor parts of the rock will\r\ndissolve and leave the residues of sandstone or shale, which are\r\ninsoluble.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A coarse-grained limestone effervescing in dilute\r\n    muriatic acid. (This photograph and other close-up views taken by J.\r\n    F. Barham and Allen Barnes, University photographers.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Solid dolomite does not effervesce in dilute acid.\r\n    Note the white rock powder scrapings adjacent.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Dolomite powder does effervesce in dilute muriatic\r\n    acid. Not all dolomite is this fine in grain.]\r\n\r\nSome limestones are chemical deposits but many are consolidated\r\naccumulations of fossil shells and shell fragments—organic limestone.\r\nFor example, a widespread limestone, the so-called Burlington limestone,\r\nextending across central Missouri, contains many crinoid stem fragments\r\nand plates, attesting to the abundance of crinoids living in the sea at\r\nthe time this limestone was laid down. Crinoids are sea animals which,\r\nbecause of their branching structure and superficial resemblance to\r\nplants, have been nicknamed “sea lilies.” Except for calcareous cave and\r\nspring deposits, almost all limestone formations in Missouri contain a\r\nfew fossils of animals which lived in the ocean, and therefore Missouri\r\nlimestones are considered marine in origin. They offer evidence for the\r\nvery interesting land-sea changes which this state has undergone in the\r\ngeologic past.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Limestone composed almost entirely of crinoid (marine\r\n    animal fossil) stem plates, from near Columbia.]\r\n\r\nPure limestone is composed of 100% calcium carbonate (calcite mineral),\r\nwhereas pure dolomite contains 54.35% calcium carbonate and 45.65%\r\nmagnesium carbonate (dolomite mineral). Magnesium carbonate has slightly\r\nhigher acid-neutralizing properties than calcium carbonate, weight for\r\nweight, and because analyses of limestone to be used for soil sweetening\r\nand agricultural fertilizer purposes are commonly reported in calcium\r\ncarbonate equivalents, a dolomite or dolomitic limestone may be reported\r\nover 100% calcium carbonate equivalent. Unless one understands the full\r\nmeaning of the report he may be bewildered by a statement of the value\r\nover 100%.\r\n\r\nThe calcium and magnesium which form limestone (or dolomitic limestone)\r\nin the ocean are carried there in solution by the streams which drain\r\nthe land. Rain water percolating through the ground and rocks becomes\r\nslightly acidified with carbon dioxide (like the carbonated water in\r\nbeverages) and dissolves the calcium and magnesium from primary igneous\r\nrocks like gabbro and basalt which are weathering, or from preexisting\r\nlimestones which primitively were derived from igneous rocks. This\r\ncalcium and magnesium in solution are responsible for the hardness of\r\nthe water. In fact, the hard water in Missouri springs, wells, and\r\nstreams is hard because it contains either or both calcium (“lime”) and\r\nmagnesium in solution.\r\n\r\nThis soluble calcium and magnesium flows on in the stream to the ocean\r\nbecause of its combination with the dissolved carbon dioxide. In the\r\nshallow parts of the ocean, as on the continental shelves where the\r\nwater is less than 600 feet deep, the limestone is deposited in layers\r\njust like the white lime layer deposits on the bottom of the teakettle\r\nin which hard water has been boiled. Chemical processes, temperature\r\nchanges, evaporation of the ocean water, and organisms are responsible\r\nfor most of the limestone deposition. Extensive limestone deposition is\r\ntaking place today off the coast of Florida and around the tropical\r\nislands of the southern Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe uses of limestone are numerous. It is an excellent building stone in\r\neither the rough, sawn, or dressed state. It is used for rubble stone,\r\nrip-rap, railroad ballast, crushed gravel, and aggregate in concrete. It\r\nis one of the raw materials of Portland cement. Quicklime and hydrated\r\nlime are prepared from limestone which has been heated to drive off the\r\nchemically combined carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nLimestone is added as a fluxing material in metallurgical processes. It\r\nis the lowest priced source of alkali in chemical industry. Pulverized\r\nlimestone may be used as a filler in paints, putty, paper, or rubber;\r\nand rock wool is made by melting and blowing a limestone having a\r\nsuitable chemical composition. Two formations develop a “spongy”\r\nappearance (“sponge rock” or “sponge limestone”) upon weathering and are\r\nutilized abundantly in the eastern part of the state for rock gardens\r\nand for ornamental and decorative stone.\r\n\r\nMany tons of limestone are used each year in Missouri as a soil\r\nfertilizer because it neutralizes acidity, coagulates the clay,\r\nfurnishes calcium to the plants by way of the colloidal clay, and frees\r\nother chemical elements so that they become available to the plants. No\r\ndoubt rocks other than limestone will be crushed and added to the soil\r\nin the future, but today our attention is focussed chiefly on limestone\r\nand dolomite.\r\n\r\nThe value of a limestone quarry for agricultural purposes depends upon\r\navailability, amount of overburden, purity of the stone, ease of\r\ncrushing, and size of deposit. For instance, a stone of 90% purity,\r\nwhich is close at hand, will probably be more valuable than one of 98%\r\npurity which must be hauled fifteen miles. Bare hillsides or creek banks\r\nwhere a crusher can be set up to handle the stone without extra lifting\r\nare preferable for quarry sites. Usually the overburden is less in such\r\nan exposed face. Impurities in limestone deposits may be large chert\r\n(flint) nodules which can be hand-sorted out, sand grains, clay which\r\nsettled into and onto the stone during its accumulation, and pyrite\r\n(fool’s gold) or other minerals of lesser importance. Clay impurities\r\nsimply act as useless extra weight which must be handled. Sand grains,\r\nhowever, are hard, and will abrade and wear out crushing equipment.\r\nChert and fine-grained silica likewise are harder than steel and will\r\nwear a crusher excessively. Pure limestone (calcite or dolomite mineral)\r\nhas a hardness less than that of steel and will only polish or wear the\r\nmetal slightly.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Typical, intermittently-operated, farm limestone\r\n    quarry near North Kansas City.]\r\n\r\nIt will probably pay to give some thought to this matter of crushing\r\nwhen selecting a quarry site for agricultural limestone. The several\r\nbeds of stone available should be tested not only for amount, but kinds\r\nof impurities. Samples sent in for testing must be _representative_ of\r\nthe rocks under consideration or the analytical results are meaningless.\r\nThe writer does not believe this point can be over-emphasized. Time\r\nafter time he has seen samples taken of geological deposits for testing\r\nwhich no more represented the deposits than a bantam rooster picked out\r\nof a chicken pen would represent the egg-laying or weight-production\r\npossibilities of the flock of Plymouth Rock hens.\r\n\r\nIf five layers or beds of stone are to be properly tested, then five\r\nsamples must be taken, _one broken from each layer of solid rock in\r\nplace_. The five layers may have the same color, or look much the same,\r\nbut fine grains of sand, hardly visible without magnification, may be\r\nabundant in some layers and not in others. If circumstances do not\r\npermit having five different tests made, but allow only one sample to be\r\nrun, then specimens should be taken from all five beds, their sizes\r\nbeing in proportion to the relative amounts expected to be quarried from\r\neach bed, and all five specimens sent to the analyst, who can crush and\r\nmix them.\r\n\r\nA single grab sample taken from loose rock on a hillside, in expectation\r\nthat it will represent the rocks inside, depends as much on luck as\r\nbetting on the weather next 4th of July, a year hence. The chemist who\r\nanalyzes the limestone for calcium can usually report on the kind of\r\nimpurity if he will take the time to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        “Cotton Rock” Limestone\r\n\r\n“Cotton rock” refers to a white to slightly gray or buff variety of\r\nlimestone which has a “soft”, somewhat chalky and porous appearance that\r\nis suggestive of cotton. Missouri “cotton rock” is usually dolomitic.\r\nAlthough the term “cotton rock” has no standing in a technical sense,\r\nits fairly wide use indicates that the name has descriptive value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Marble\r\n\r\nMarble, in a scientific sense, is a metamorphic rock and does not occur\r\nas such in Missouri. However, marble has been used as a name in\r\ncommercial trade to refer to a crystalline, fairly pure limestone, which\r\npossesses most of the useful qualities of true marble. In that sense the\r\n“marbles” quarried near Ozora and Carthage, Missouri, are very excellent\r\nstone. No doubt some recrystallization has occurred in connection with\r\nthe faulting in the Ozora region, and this may be interpreted as mild\r\nmetamorphism. The Carthage “marble” is quarried from beds of limestone\r\nwell developed for structural purposes. These “marbles” effervesce in\r\nacid, of course, just as described for limestone.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is interesting to note that the polish on\r\nlimestone or marble is not durable where exposed to the weather in the\r\nsame sense as is the polish on granite. Because limestone and marble are\r\nsofter than granite they may be cut and polished at lower cost, but\r\nbecause of their ease of attack by acid, water, and abrasion they soon\r\nbecome dull when used as an exterior stone. For interior decoration they\r\nare excellent, of course. Granite contains hard minerals which happen\r\nnot to be attacked appreciably by dilute acids, and therefore it retains\r\na polish for a long time even where exposed to the weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Cave Onyx and Deposits\r\n\r\nThe stalactites (rock icicles) hanging from cave ceilings, stalagmites\r\nbuilt up from the floors, and other drip stone deposits of caves are\r\nlargely calcite, the mineral of limestone. Again, this can be recognized\r\nby the limestone acid test (effervescence, see limestone). Cave onyx may\r\nbe banded like agate. It is then commonly called Mexican onyx. The name\r\ntravertine has also been applied to such deposits from water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Travertine\r\n\r\nTravertine is a general name for calcium carbonate deposits of varying\r\nsize, shape, color, texture, and purity which originate largely through\r\nevaporation of spring or surface water. Its composition of calcium\r\ncarbonate, calcite mineral, is easily confirmed by effervescence in\r\nacid, like limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Calcite\r\n\r\nCalcite (sometimes called “tiff” locally in south-_western_ Missouri),\r\nthe essential mineral in limestone, can be recognized by several\r\ndefinite characteristics:\r\n\r\n  1. It bubbles, “fizzes,” or _effervesces_ in dilute acid. See page 11.\r\n  2. It is easily scratched with a knife.\r\n  3. It breaks or cleaves into rhombohedral shapes, of which at least\r\n          one flat, glistening side is visible on every individual grain\r\n          in the broken surface of limestone.\r\n  4. It has a glassy luster on crystal and cleavage faces.\r\n  5. It crystallizes into six-sided crystal forms, which can be\r\n          differentiated from quartz (also six-sided) by tests (1) and\r\n          (2) above.\r\n\r\nThe one single test of calcite which is most diagnostic, and which\r\nappeals to most persons, is number one above, effervescence of the solid\r\nlump in dilute acid. The bubbles are filled by carbon dioxide gas which\r\ncomes from, and is freed from, the calcite by the reaction of it with\r\nthe acid. Calcite is calcium carbonate, CaCO₃.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A small calcite crystal from the Joplin region.]\r\n\r\nMany Missourians have not realized that the ordinary, everyday limestone\r\n(fine to coarse granular), which is so abundant here, is composed of a\r\nmineral—calcite which makes up the grains. The strikingly beautiful\r\ncalcite crystals (displayed in museums) derived from the calcite crystal\r\ncaves found in some mines in the Joplin district are accepted without\r\nquestion as _mineral_ specimens of calcite, but the idea that all of the\r\ncommonplace glistening grains in the local limestone are also mineral\r\ngrains is a new thought to most persons. A pure limestone is composed\r\nentirely of calcite. Even impure limestones which contain subordinate\r\namounts of quartz sand, chert, clay, or iron oxide are in the main also\r\ncalcite. Dolomite and dolomitic limestones contain the mineral dolomite.\r\n\r\nThe mineral of ordinary marble is calcite; dolomite marble contains\r\ndolomite. The cementing material in sandstone and a common accessory\r\nmineral in shale are calcite. It is truly a wide-spread and abundant\r\nmineral. Even the lime deposit in the bottom of the tea-kettle, the\r\nwater heater, boiler, or automobile cooling system is calcite, or\r\naragonite, a twin brother to calcite.\r\n\r\nThe use of calcite in the form of limestone is treated under limestone.\r\nAs for the use of large calcite crystals, they are sold as ornaments and\r\ncuriosities. Visitors to the Missouri State Fair may recall the exhibit\r\nof a beautiful, reconstructed crystal cave which was lined with large\r\ncalcite crystals. Calcite crystals have been shipped in car-load lots to\r\nbeautify grottos, notably some in Iowa and Illinois, and are displayed\r\nin almost all prominent museums.\r\n\r\nWater-white (clear), optical-quality calcite crystals, which command a\r\nhigh price, are relatively rare and have not been found in Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe optical property of calcite which accounts for its high value is its\r\nability to separate, or refract, every single ray of light passing\r\nthrough it into two widely separated, easily distinguishable rays, hence\r\ndoubling their number. This is called double refraction, and is shown by\r\nthe double image of an object viewed through the calcite. Instruments\r\nwhich polarize light may contain calcite crystals. The artificial\r\nproduct, “Polaroid”, is used for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Calcite cleavage rhomb, characteristic rhombohedral\r\n    shape. Note the double image due to high double refraction of\r\n    calcite.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Dolomite\r\n\r\nDolomite mineral occurs in Missouri as a constituent of dolomitic\r\nlimestone or as a vein and cavity filling in the rocks of the Joplin\r\nmining district and as a lining in cavities in the dolomitic limestones\r\nof the southern and eastern parts of the state.\r\n\r\nDolomite when _powdered_ (by scraping the surface of the specimen, for\r\ndolomite is softer than steel or glass) effervesces freely in cold\r\ndilute hydrochloric (muriatic) acid, but the lump dolomite effervesces\r\n_very slowly, if at all_. Calcite effervesces freely in the lump with\r\ncold dilute acid. This acid test is the one certain test for dolomite,\r\nand works with the thick-bedded formations as well as with the showy,\r\ncrystal-faced material from veins. See page 11.\r\n\r\nDolomite crystals have a pearly luster and are usually pale pink in the\r\nJoplin district. Their faces are commonly curved but where broken show\r\nglistening to pearly cleavage faces. These properties assume more\r\nsignificance in mineral determination as one becomes familiar with\r\nmineral collections, but the non-technical person can rely on the acid\r\ntest.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Typical dolomite crystals from Joplin region.]\r\n\r\nWith the above information in mind, one may proceed with certainty to\r\nidentify a layer of dolomite from a quarry or hillside, or a crystal of\r\nit in a hand specimen. First, determine that it is scratched readily\r\nwith a knife blade or iron nail. Anything too hard to be scratched by\r\nsteel is neither calcite nor dolomite. Second, scrape a small mound of\r\npowder on the lump specimens. Third, apply one or two drops of cold\r\ndilute acid to the lump near the powder and allow the acid to run into\r\nthe powder. If the _lump_ effervesces _freely_ the specimen is _calcite_\r\nmineral or limestone rock. If the _lump_ does _not effervesce freely_\r\nbut the _powder does_, it is _dolomite_ mineral or dolomite rock,\r\ndolomitic limestone. If neither lump nor powder effervesce it is neither\r\ncalcite (ordinary limestone) nor dolomite (dolomitic limestone). In the\r\nlatter case, it may be gypsum, barite, Shale, weathered chert, clay, or\r\nfire clay, or other rock.\r\n\r\nThe composition of dolomite is calcium-magnesium carbonate, CaMg(CO₃)₂,\r\nand when pure runs about 54½ per cent calcium carbonate and 45½ per cent\r\nmagnesium carbonate. However, dolomite is _not a mechanical mixture_ of\r\nthe two carbonates; it is a single crystalline compound wherein the\r\ncalcium and magnesium are securely interlocked within the arrangement of\r\nthe atoms. For that reason, the extraction of magnesium metal or other\r\nmagnesium compounds from dolomite is so difficult and costly that other\r\nmagnesium minerals, although not nearly so abundant and accessible to\r\nindustry as dolomite, have been processed to obtain the lightweight\r\nmetal magnesium.\r\n\r\nThe thick beds of Missouri dolomitic limestone (and some fairly pure\r\ndolomite) have been used chiefly as agricultural stone for soil\r\nsweetening, for building stone, gravel, and other purposes to which\r\nrough stone is put.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Shale\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Shale bluff at a strip mine near Columbia.]\r\n\r\nShale is a compressed, and layered or laminated clay or mud rock.\r\nConsequently it will return to mud if it is wetted with water and\r\nrubbed. This may serve as a test for shale. It may occur in thick layers\r\nor formations, five, ten to fifty or more feet in thickness, and it\r\nranges downward to paper-thin partings between beds of limestone. It is\r\nalso commonly associated with coal beds. The color of shale varies from\r\nlight gray to black, or it may be tan, yellow, red, rust, purplish, or\r\ngreen. It is platy, and these thin plates or laminae, piled on each\r\nother, make up the shale bed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Hand specimen of shale shown in preceding picture.\r\n    Note the characteristic thin layering or lamination.]\r\n\r\nSome shales are hard, tough, and strong enough to serve as temporary\r\nmine roofs. Hard shales are sometimes called “slate” but this name is\r\ntechnically incorrect. _True slate_ is a metamorphic rock, composed\r\nchiefly of the mineral mica in very fine flakes, and will resist the\r\naction of water (weathering) for a long time. Therefore, it is a good\r\nroofing material for buildings, whereas shale is composed chiefly of\r\nclay minerals, and despite the strength and compactness of the more\r\n“slaty” varieties soon disintegrates in water. Missouri “slaty” shale\r\nwould not serve as satisfactory roofing material.\r\n\r\nThe red “burned” shale found on burned-out coal mine dumps is called\r\n“shale” locally. It is, of course, shale which has been fired more or\r\nless to the condition of building brick by the hot burning waste coal.\r\nThe same original shale could be crushed, molded into brick, “burned” in\r\na kiln, and become a satisfactory building brick. The “burned shale” of\r\nthe coal mine dumps is used in many places as a drive-way covering.\r\n\r\n“Soapstone” is a name applied by some persons to some soft, slippery to\r\ngreasy shales, but this name is incorrect in a technical sense. True\r\nsoapstone is a metamorphic rock (shale is sedimentary) which is composed\r\nchiefly of the mineral talc. Soapstone occurs abundantly in certain\r\nparts of the Appalachian Mountains but is exceedingly sparse in\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nThe chief commercial uses of shale are in the manufacture of common\r\nbrick, building brick, building tile, drain tile, sewer pipe, Portland\r\ncement, and other ceramic products. Many shale beds and occurrences are\r\ntechnically suitable for these uses but have no real commercial value\r\nbecause other necessary factors are lacking. In order to make brick,\r\ntile, or cement there must be sufficient fuel available at low cost,\r\nlow-priced bulk transportation of the raw and finished products,\r\navailable labor, capital for the erection of a plant, and above all a\r\nlarge near-by, dependable market for the manufactured product. The value\r\nof a shale deposit, therefore, depends as much upon outside conditions\r\nas upon the properties of the rock (shale) itself.\r\n\r\nThe shales of Missouri were formed from deposits of mud that settled out\r\nin sea water which in the past covered this state. Fossil remains of\r\nsea-living organisms which are preserved in the shale give evidence of\r\nthe marine conditions once existent here. Like the muds that are\r\naccumulating along the Atlantic coast and in the Gulf of Mexico, where\r\nthe Mississippi River is discharging its load of silt and clay, so did\r\nmud form layers on the bottom of geologically ancient interior seas. In\r\nsome cases sand was later washed in and covered the mud; in other cases\r\nlimestone-forming material (like off the coast of Florida today) was\r\ndeposited on top of the mud. The weight of the overlying beds and the\r\nslow movement which raised the sea bottom up to land squeezed out the\r\nexcess water, compressed and compacted the muds into thin layers, and\r\nbrought about the shale rock which is exposed to us today.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Soft, easily eroded bed of shale between two more\r\n    resistant beds of limestone near Columbia.]\r\n\r\nBlack muds, rich in humus and other organic material, formed black\r\nshales; red and yellow clays colored by red and yellow iron oxides (iron\r\nrusts) formed red and yellow shales; and sandy muds were compacted into\r\ngritty, sandy shales. All of them were derived from eroding land and\r\nsoils just as today our eroding soils contribute to the formation of\r\nmore shale now in the long, slow process of formation.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of an average shale is not simple, as is shown\r\nby the subjoined composite analyses of sedimentary rocks taken from U.\r\nS.

(100.)\r\n\r\nMany persons upon learning that average shale, and even “clay dirt,” may\r\ncontain 15% alumina, Al₂O₃ (equivalent to almost 8% metallic aluminum),\r\nbecome thoughtlessly and erroneously enthusiastic about aluminum ore\r\npossibilities on their farms or properties. The aluminum is there all\r\nright, but it is so securely combined with silica and other elements\r\nthat the cost of extraction is now greater than the price of aluminum\r\nobtained from less abundant ores. Until chemists find a method of\r\nextraction of the metal from ordinary clay or shale that can be carried\r\nout at considerably less expense than is now possible, the vast\r\nquantities of clay and shale on the earth’s surface must be considered a\r\ndistant reserve of a prohibitively high cost aluminum.\r\n\r\nMissouri possesses a little bauxitic clay in the southeastern part of\r\nthe state but unfortunately does not contain deposits of high grade\r\nbauxite, the chief ore of aluminum, and so does not contribute to the\r\naluminum production of the United States (see the discussion under\r\nDIASPORE CLAY). Arkansas is a leading producer of bauxite, but the\r\ngeological conditions present in that bauxite locality are so different\r\nfrom Missouri geology that little hope is held for finding bauxite in\r\nMissouri, except possibly in the extreme southeastern part.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Fire Clay\r\n\r\nFire clay resembles shale in that it is also a clayey rock and becomes\r\nmuddy upon wetting and rubbing. It differs from shale at sight in that\r\nit (fire clay) is not laminated like shale, but occurs instead in a\r\nmassive structure which is relatively uniform throughout. Fire clay\r\nfractures naturally into blocky or irregular fragments ranging in size\r\nfrom boulders to rough flakes, whereas shale weathers into layered,\r\nplaty chips.\r\n\r\nShales are commonly buff, yellow, reddish, greenish, or brown in\r\naddition to gray in color, whereas good useable fire clay predominates\r\nin white, cream, and gray to almost black (if much organic matter is\r\ncontained in it). Shale is ordinarily gritty with hard sand particles,\r\nbut most good Missouri fire clay contains only a small amount of sand.\r\nOf course, fire clay may grade into sandstone through a sandy clay\r\nphase, but this part would not be confused with a layered, gritty shale.\r\n\r\nThe really determining characteristic of fire clay is its resistance to\r\nmelting under high temperature. The most positive test for this property\r\nis to heat the fire clay to a white heat in comparison with standard\r\npreparations (Pyrometric Test Cones) whose fusion temperatures are\r\nknown. Most of Missouri fire clay will withstand a clean oxidizing heat\r\nof over 3000° Fahrenheit without melting.\r\n\r\nClay minerals originate, in general, from the weathering of previously\r\nexisting silicate rocks and have therefore been called, on occasions,\r\n“rotted rocks.” The writer has long insisted that clays, particularly\r\nfire clays, should be thought of instead as purified or refined rocks.\r\nThe original silicate rocks and minerals, which were rich in\r\nconstituents melting at low temperatures, have been soaked, leached, and\r\nwashed by chemically active ground water and rain water until many of\r\nthe undesirable elements have been carried away, leaving a refined\r\nmaterial which we use and know as fire clay. Missouri possesses one of\r\nthe largest reserves of finest quality fire clay in the world. Special\r\nbulletins on Missouri fire clay are published by the State Geologist,\r\nRolla, Missouri, and may be obtained from his office.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Plastic fire clay. Shows typical break and naturally\r\n    polished slicken-sided surfaces. From Mexico, Missouri.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Typical break.]\r\n\r\nPersons who have undeveloped fire clay deposits on their property\r\nfrequently ask advice on whom to contact and how to arrange for sale of\r\ntheir fire clay, with the expectation of a fair return and fair\r\ntreatment. The writer recommends in such cases that the owner of the\r\nclay dig into his deposit to obtain a fresh, clean, _representative_\r\nspecimen of his fire clay (about one pound) and send it to one or more\r\nof the large substantial fire brick or refractories companies operating\r\nin Missouri. Obviously the company located nearest the deposit, or with\r\nthe lowest-cost shipping facilities, will be in a favored position to\r\npurchase the clay. If the individual is skeptical about the\r\ntrustworthiness of the company’s report, he may send opposite parts of\r\nthe sample lumps to competitive companies. Of course, the individual may\r\nhave his clay tested by an independent laboratory at his own expense,\r\nbut this is ordinarily a useless, costly experience because a company\r\nwill duplicate those tests in its own laboratory before purchasing the\r\nclay. If the refractories companies find the clay useful to them they\r\nwill proceed with negotiations. If the clay is of inferior quality or if\r\nit is not needed by the particular company at _that time_, even though\r\nof acceptable quality, usually the company will return a truthful report\r\nat no cost to the clay owner.\r\n\r\nThe same general advice is given in regard to the development of any\r\nmineral deposit which the holder may have. The caution about obtaining a\r\nrepresentative sample is especially to be emphasized. It applies to the\r\nmetallic ores, mineral water, and common rock as well as to fire clay.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Plastic Fire Clay\r\n\r\nPlastic fire clay forms a sticky, soft mass when wetted and kneaded with\r\nwater, and will bond together other clays or rocks. Large plastic fire\r\nclay deposits occur in Audrain, Callaway, and St. Louis counties, and\r\nlesser quantities are known in Boone, Osage, Gasconade, and Phelps\r\ncounties. The larger deposits assume a blanket shape with a highly\r\nirregular lower surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Flint Fire Clay\r\n\r\nFlint fire clay is very fine-grained, smooth or slick, and breaks with a\r\nshell-like (conchoidal) fracture. It varies in color from white to\r\nblack, but most flint fire clay mined is near to white. It is relatively\r\nnon-plastic—that is, does not readily slake or form a sticky mass when\r\nworked a little in water. In fact, flint fire clay has been used locally\r\nas road surfacing because it does not become very muddy and sticky. Of\r\ncourse, it is inferior to black-top or concrete road surfaces and has\r\ntoo high a commercial value now to be used extensively as road metal.\r\n\r\nA hard, white variety of flint fire clay which breaks with numerous\r\nconchoidal fractures in appropriate shaped fragments has been called\r\nlocally “pop-corn flint.” This clay, and other sand-free flint clay,\r\nwhen crushed between one’s teeth “goes to water” in the mouth. Many clay\r\nminers use the chewing test to establish the freedom of their clays from\r\ngritty sand, which renders flint clay inferior in quality.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Flint fire clay showing typical “slick break” and\r\n    conchoidal fracture, from near New Florence.]\r\n\r\nFlint fire clays occur geologically in old land depressions and in\r\nroughly funnel-shaped pits surrounded by an enclosing layer of\r\nsandstone, the whole lying within limestone country rock. The most\r\nprominent flint fire clay deposits are found in Callaway, Warren,\r\nLincoln, Osage, Gasconade, Maries, Franklin, and Phelps counties.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Diaspore Clay\r\n\r\nDiaspore clay is a harsh, usually porous, earthy type of clay which has\r\nbeen found in Warren, Osage, Gasconade, Maries, Franklin, Phelps, and\r\nCrawford counties in Missouri. Some diaspore clay is mealy, or finely\r\ngranular, some is chalky to compact, and much of it is more or less\r\noolitic. Oolites (oolitic structure) are small rounded bodies varying in\r\nsize from about bird shot to BB shot size, and those in diaspore may be\r\nsolid or hollow. Their hollow structure contributes to the porous\r\ncondition in diaspore clay. See page 29.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to write a description of diaspore clay which\r\ncan be used to determine it because the clay has so few individual\r\ncharacteristics. A person familiar with diaspore clay, however, can\r\nrecognize it at a glance. Probably diaspore clay will not be found\r\noutside the counties listed above, and within those counties many\r\npersons know the clay from contact with the commercial production of it.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Diaspore clay, over 70% alumina, from near Belle.]\r\n\r\nDiaspore clay occurs in old sink-hole, funnel-shaped pits which formed\r\nin the dolomite (limestone) underlying that region. A sandstone layer\r\nwhich lines the pit and commonly stands somewhat above the level of the\r\nclay because of the sandstones superior resistance to weathering is\r\nknown as the “rim rock” of the pit. The diaspore clay may be thought of\r\nas an extra-refined type of fire clay from which silica has been leached\r\nduring prolonged solution in swamps and ground water and the more stable\r\nalumina (Al₂O₃) left behind as the refined product.\r\n\r\nPits in the diaspore region may contain from a few truck loads of clay\r\nto over 50,000 tons of it, but a pit which produces 10,000 tons of good\r\nclay is a valuable and not very common deposit. A small fortune falls to\r\nthe landowner who finds a large diaspore deposit (pit) on his farm, for\r\nroyalty rates at this time are not less than $1.00 per ton for first\r\ngrade, 70% Al₂O₃ clay.\r\n\r\nBecause of the high value of diaspore, a highly competitive prospecting,\r\nleasing, mining, and brokerage business has developed in the diaspore\r\nregion. Practically all of the thrills, hopes, disappointments, and good\r\nfortunes that are associated with oil booms are found in this business\r\nand clay area; clay pits are only smaller in scale than wild oil\r\ngushers. Clay scouts work in secret, mining leases are contested in\r\ncourt, rumors fly fast in English, German, and German-Swiss over the\r\ncountry telephones, prospecting results may be hidden, personal pressure\r\nmay be brought to influence a deal, and speedy salesmanship is employed\r\nwhen an exciting find is in the offing. When the legends, traditions,\r\nand facts of the diaspore region are collected and recorded, an\r\ninteresting and essential part of Missouri history will have been\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nMissouri has the only locality in the entire world where relatively pure\r\ndiaspore clay is now mined in commercial quantities. Because of its\r\nextreme resistance to fusion under very high temperatures, diaspore has\r\nbeen called the “aristocrat of fire clays.” Diaspore contains a higher\r\npercentage of aluminum than does bauxite, the chief ore of aluminum, but\r\nbecause of diaspore’s extremely refractory nature it is less easily\r\nreduced to aluminum metal than is bauxite, and therefore finds a more\r\nspecialized use in the manufacture of refractory and super-refractory\r\nbrick and tile which may even be used in furnaces to calcine aluminum\r\nore. Where resistance to very high temperature has been required,\r\ndiaspore super fire brick has been remarkably useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Burley Clay\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Burley clay. Note the oolitic structure, the “burls.”\r\n    From a diaspore pit near Swiss.]\r\n\r\nBurley clay is a fire clay intermediate in alumina content between flint\r\nclay and first quality diaspore. It takes its name from the oolites\r\n(rounded pellets of diaspore) which are scattered through a flint clay\r\nbase and which were called “burls” by the early clay miners. As the\r\nrelative number of diaspore oolites increase, an otherwise flint clay\r\nbecomes burley-flint, then typical burley, and finally grades into\r\nsecond quality and first quality diaspore. Clay in any stage of the\r\nvariation may be found in some part of the diaspore region or pits. Most\r\nof the remarks written on diaspore apply as well to burley clay.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Sandstone\r\n\r\nSandstone is a rock made of sand-size particles more or less well\r\ncemented. It is recognized by the grains of sand which are dislodged or\r\nscratched loose when the rock is broken, or when scraped with a piece of\r\nsteel or another hard rock. The old-fashioned grindstone is a sandstone\r\nnicely cemented by nature.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Sandstone bluff near mine entrance, Crystal City.\r\n    (Photo courtesy of Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company.)]\r\n\r\nSandstone occurs in thin layers to thick massive beds and deposits which\r\nmay exceed fifty feet in thickness. In addition to possessing horizontal\r\nbedding and parallel bedding planes, some sandstone displays beautiful,\r\nintricate cross-bedding or cross-lamination.\r\n\r\nThe grains of sand composing the stone may be either angular or rounded.\r\nThey may sparkle in the light from reflections from their crystal faces,\r\nor they may have dull, frosted surfaces. Sandstones are ordinarily\r\nnearly white in color except where the grains are covered with coatings\r\nof yellow or red iron oxide (rust).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cross-bedding in sandstone north of Fredericktown.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Sandstone in hand specimen. Magnification 4x.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Quartz sand grains. Magnification 21x.]\r\n\r\nThe grains themselves are predominantly particles of the mineral quartz,\r\nalthough any rock or mineral of sand size may be present in sandstone.\r\nThe quartz (see discussion of quartz on page 41) may have been derived\r\nfrom pre-existing sandstones or more directly from granite, porphyry, or\r\nother igneous rocks in which quartz crystallized when the hot liquid\r\nrock solidified. Today quartz grains which are weathering out of igneous\r\nrocks and sandstones are being carried by the Missouri river and\r\ntributaries to the Mississippi river and thence to the ocean, where\r\nextensive deposits of sand are accumulating, probably destined to become\r\nwidespread beds of sandstone.\r\n\r\nThe grains of sand may be broken and become angular during their long\r\ntrip to the ocean, or they may become rounded by rubbing against each\r\nother. If they exist in sand dunes, blown about by the wind before being\r\ncemented into rock, the grains usually become somewhat rounded. Even\r\nafter sandstones are buried beneath other rocks, silica, which is\r\ncarried in solution by ground waters percolating through the sandstone,\r\nmay crystallize out on the sand grains and restore some brilliant,\r\nangular crystal faces to the otherwise rounded grains.\r\n\r\nCementation of loose sand to more or less firm sandstone is due to the\r\npresence of clay, iron oxides, or calcite (mineral of limestone) which\r\nmay be deposited with the sand. All of these cements are softer and\r\nweaker than quartz, thereby being broken first and freeing the harder\r\nquartz when the rock is scratched or crushed.\r\n\r\nA variety of very hard sandstone called quartzite is one that is so\r\nstrongly cemented that it breaks through the sand grains instead of\r\naround them as is the case with ordinary sandstone. This condition is\r\nbrought about by their being cemented with silica (chemically the same\r\nas quartz), which makes for essentially uniform hardness throughout the\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nQuartzites are, as previously noted, extremely hard, and resist abrasion\r\nand chemical weathering. Reddish quartzite boulders occur rather\r\nabundantly north of the Missouri River in the glacial clay, sand, and\r\ngravel which overlie the sedimentary rocks that form the bed rock or\r\ncountry rock there. Locally, the hard, red quartzite boulders may be\r\ncalled “red niggerheads”, although the term “niggerhead” is more often\r\napplied to black or dark greenish black boulders of basalt (see page 48)\r\nalso present in the glacial drift. It is to be recalled that the\r\ndistinguishing hardness of quartzite is due to the hardness of the\r\nquartz grains plus the equal hardness of the silica cement.\r\n\r\nAsphaltic sandstone is a sandstone impregnated with a bituminous residue\r\nfrom the evaporation of petroleum which once occupied the pores of the\r\nrock. It has been reported from more than a dozen counties in western\r\nMissouri, but the most extensive deposits are probably in Barton,\r\nVernon, and Lafayette counties.\r\n\r\nAttention has been directed to the origin of sandstones from ocean\r\ndeposits of sand and from sand dunes, but it should be recognized also\r\nthat river channels and stream valleys which contain deposits of sand\r\n(such as those on floodplains, river bottoms, and sand bars) may be\r\ncovered, and the sand consolidated to sandstone. Many years ago, even\r\nlong ago geologically, a large river, almost comparable in size to the\r\nMissouri river, occupied a channel which is now represented by a long\r\nnarrow sandstone deposit extending from a little north of Clinton\r\nthrough Warrensburg to Lexington and then east through Moberly almost to\r\nParis. Smaller channel sandstones are abundant in other areas in\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nThe sandstones of the so-called Roubidoux formation, which occurs in\r\nsouth central Missouri, commonly show well-preserved ripple marks on the\r\nrock slabs. These marks were formed exactly as their name suggests—in\r\nsand which was thrown into ripples by the shallow water in which it\r\naccumulated and was covered and cemented so as to retain the ripple\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Ripple marks in limy sandstone.]\r\n\r\nSandstone is used for building stone, walks, grindstones, furnace\r\nlinings, and rock gardens. Large quantities are mined each year near\r\nPacific, Festus and Crystal City, Klondike, and Hermann, for the\r\nmanufacture of glass and other uses. Common glass is a cooled melt of\r\nrelatively pure silica sand, soda ash, and lime. Asphaltic sandstone is\r\nused in road building. Sand-lime brick are made of sand. Sand is used as\r\na molding material for metal castings, a parting substance between brick\r\nin kilns, and in large quantities in concrete and mortar mixtures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Chert, Flint\r\n\r\nThe names chert and flint have in some regions been used for the same\r\nhard, fine-grained rock found so abundantly in Missouri, but correct\r\nusage employs chert for the white and gray varieties, and flint for the\r\nblack variety. Flint may be thought of as slightly impure chert, a chert\r\nwhich is colored black by a small amount of pigment, usually fine\r\ncarbon, or perhaps iron sulphide, scattered through it like fine dust.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Chert, fossiliferous and slightly speckled. Note\r\n    typical sharp edges, smooth surfaces, and conchoidal fracture. From\r\n    near Columbia.]\r\n\r\nChert is characterized by being harder than glass, brittle, very\r\nfine-grained, and by breaking with a smooth, rounded or hollowed clam\r\nshell-like (conchoidal) fracture and sharp edges. It was used by Indians\r\nto make arrow heads. It accumulates in abundance both in stream beds as\r\ngravel which has been more or less rounded by wear, and on the hillsides\r\nwithin the soil and sub-soil. Yellow and red iron oxides may stain and\r\npenetrate weathered chert gravel so that it becomes reddish, rusty, tan,\r\nyellow or brown.\r\n\r\nChert remains abundant because of its extreme resistance to weathering.\r\nIt is so hard that stream action wears it only very slowly. Its chemical\r\ncomposition is silica, SiO₂, a substance which is but little affected\r\nchemically by ground water. Where chert has contained fine grains of\r\ncalcite scattered through it, the calcite may be removed in solution,\r\nleaving pores, and a zone of porous, light weight, tripolitic chert,\r\nharsh to the feel and enveloping an unaltered interior (See WEATHERED\r\nCHERT). Not uncommonly, fossil remains of calcite which were embedded in\r\nchert have been dissolved, leaving their hollow impressions.\r\n\r\nChert in Missouri originally occurs chiefly in limestone formations,\r\nwhere it is found as nodules, lenses, stringers, and irregular forms in\r\nand between the limestone beds. Chert and flint may be deposited\r\ndirectly from silica in solution, or they may replace (substitute for)\r\nwood, fossils, or older rock where silica-bearing solutions contact and\r\nreact with the replaced substance. For example, petrified wood usually\r\nis wood which has been replaced molecule by molecule with silica. This\r\nstatement applies equally to the brightly colored petrified wood in the\r\nPetrified Forest in Arizona and to that with comparatively drab coloring\r\nin Missouri. Many other siliceous fossils, notably animal remains, are\r\nreplacements of calcite (limestone) by silica.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation that the reader may have difficulty understanding how\r\nsilica may go into solution if chert (silica) is hardly attacked by the\r\nweathering process, it should be explained that silica is freed in\r\nsolution predominately during the weathering of complex\r\nsilica-combinations, silicates, rather than from uncombined silica. For\r\ninstance, feldspar and pyroxene from granite or gabbro weather in ground\r\nwater to a soil-forming clay mineral and release some silica in solution\r\nin the ground water. After this silica is redeposited in an uncombined\r\nform, like chert, it becomes highly insoluble.\r\n\r\nAn observation in regard to flint is that the metallic “flints” which\r\nare used to ignite gas burners or cigarette lighters are not black\r\nchert, SiO₂. Instead, they are special alloys containing rather uncommon\r\nelements which possess the useful characteristic of emitting a brilliant\r\nhot spark when harshly scratched.\r\n\r\nChert is the chief source of natural gravel in Missouri because it\r\naccumulates in stream beds and on hillsides on account of its resistance\r\nto weathering. The piles of “chats” in the Joplin region, containing\r\nthousands of tons of crushed chert, have been used in part in road\r\nsurfacing material.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Weathered Chert\r\n\r\nWeathered chert, or leached chert, is a white to gray, or yellowish,\r\nporous, light-weight, harsh to feel, chalky-appearing rock which occurs\r\nover much of the southern half of Missouri. It does not effervesce in\r\nacid. Usually it occurs as a zone from a fraction of, to more than an\r\ninch in thickness, about a denser core of hard, compact chert (flint),\r\nor makes up an entire small rock fragment or gravel.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Chert hand specimen showing quartz-lined fossil\r\n    cavity in center, compact fresh chert in interior, and\r\n    chalky-appearing weathered outside margins. From near Columbia.]\r\n\r\nIt develops as a relatively insoluble residue left when the more soluble\r\nrock material in association has been leached away during the weathering\r\nprocess. Its composition approaches pure silica. It has no established\r\nuse and no commercial value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               “Kaoleen”\r\n\r\n“Kaoleen” is a term used locally in part of south-central Missouri to\r\nrefer to a chalky, white to tan or buff, porous weathered chert, but the\r\nname should be dropped because it is unnecessary (use weathered chert),\r\nconfusing, and not recognized elsewhere. Most probably the term arose in\r\ncorruption of the word _kaolin_, which is the name for a true,\r\nhigh-quality clay, to which the leached and weathered chert bears a\r\nslight resemblance. Kaolin has the chemical composition of clay (hydrous\r\naluminum silicate), whereas “kaoleen” is impure silica. See the\r\ndiscussion on Weathered Chert.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Tripoli\r\n\r\nTripoli occurs in the vicinity of Seneca, Newton County, Missouri. It is\r\na light-weight, porous, white to creamy, siliceous rock, which may be\r\nscratched because of its softness. Tripoli represents the porous\r\ninsoluble residue of an earlier rock, which was composed of skeletal\r\ninsoluble silica and interstitial soluble calcium carbonate (calcite),\r\nthe latter having been dissolved away by ground water. Tripoli has a\r\nchalky appearance but is totally unlike chalk chemically. Tripoli is\r\nnearly pure silica, whereas chalk is calcium carbonate. Any tripoli-like\r\nrock found in Missouri outside the region of tripoli mines is likely to\r\nbe a fragment of weathered chert which is described above.\r\n\r\nTripoli has been used as an abrasive, a polishing agent, a parting\r\nmaterial in molding sand, and a filter rock.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Agate\r\n\r\nAgate is a banded variety of chert. Although the chemical composition of\r\nagate is SiO₂, the same as chert, a microscopically fibrous part of it\r\nhaving a waxy luster or varying in color or translucency may give the\r\nappearance to the rock that we associate with the name agate. The\r\nmineral name chalcedony is given to the fibrous, waxy material.\r\n\r\nTypical agates are most abundant in Missouri in the glacial and stream\r\ngravels in the northern part of the state, although part of the Potosi\r\ndrusy quartz and chalcedony in the southeast is also prized. The large\r\ngravel pit near LaGrange, in the northeast, has furnished many beautiful\r\nspecimens, not only of agate, but also of petrified wood and fossils.\r\n\r\nMissouri lapidists and collectors of semi-precious stones find plenty of\r\ninteresting raw material within their own state.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Jasper\r\n\r\nJasper is chert which is colored red or yellowish brown by iron oxides.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Granite\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Close view of a granite hand specimen. Feldspar\r\n    predominates. Quartz appears dark in the photograph, but shows\r\n    glistening edges and points. From Graniteville.]\r\n\r\nGranite is a granular (coarse-grained) rock which has a glassy luster\r\nand is too hard to be scratched appreciably by steel. It may be white to\r\ngray, tan, brown, or pink to red in color, but pinkish to red granite\r\npredominates in Missouri. Some black stone, referred to locally as\r\n“black granite,” is usually a variety of gabbro. Most Missouri granite\r\nis coarse-grained, so that the constituent mineral grains—quartz,\r\nfeldspar, and (less frequently) mica—can be readily recognized by anyone\r\nfamiliar with those minerals. It makes up many of the mountains and\r\nhills in Iron, Madison, and St. Francois counties and adjacent regions.\r\nNorth of the Missouri River, or where the glacial deposits remain,\r\ngranite boulders may occur in the sandy and clayey glacial drift.\r\n\r\nThe mineral quartz is recognized in granite by its glistening, oily\r\nluster, really more brilliant than the luster of glass, and by its\r\ncurved to irregular broken surface. Furthermore, the brilliant luster of\r\nquartz is not dulled by exposure to weather.\r\n\r\nThe mineral feldspar, in granite, has a glassy luster on the tiny flat\r\ncleavage faces where the individual grains are broken. Where weathered,\r\nfeldspar becomes dulled, and chalky to dusty or clayey. Fresh feldspar\r\nmay be glassy, white, buff, pink, red, in intermediate shades in color.\r\nWith the mica, it imparts most of the color to granite.\r\n\r\nMica is recognized by its softness and its ability to be split very\r\neasily into tiny flakes. Other minerals may be found in granite under\r\nthe microscope, but they have little importance or significance.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Granite at the “Elephant Rocks,” Graniteville. The\r\n    large boulders now rounded by weathering are remnants of a higher\r\n    part of the large granite body which underlies this region.\r\n    (Photograph courtesy of Mr. Noel Hubbard).]\r\n\r\nGranite is an intrusive igneous rock; that is, it solidified from a hot\r\nliquid state (like lava) in a large body, beneath, or surrounded by\r\npre-existing rocks. Because of slow solidification a coarse-grained\r\ntexture was developed. In southeastern Missouri where granite is now\r\nexposed at the surface (for example, the Elephant Rocks State Park at\r\nGraniteville), that granite was covered originally by hundreds of feet\r\nof rock at the time it solidified from a liquid. During the millions of\r\nyears which have elapsed since the granite solidified, its cover and the\r\nupper part of the granite have been eroded away by streams and rain\r\nafter weathering to soil material. In fact, the ocean has covered the\r\narea several times during its long geological history.\r\n\r\nMissouri has a fine quality of granite in large quantity in southeastern\r\nMissouri. Granite is used for building, structural and monument purposes\r\n(see discussion under marble), for rubble stone, rip-rap, ballast,\r\ngravel, paving blocks, crushed chicken gravel, and for other specialized\r\nuses where favorably located.

Scratches and\r\ngrooves may have been cut in some of these boulders, or flat faces\r\nscoured and planed off as they were scraped against other hard rocks.\r\nQuartz gravel is usually present, often in abundance, in glacial\r\ndeposits. Small specimens of native metallic copper, which come from\r\nnear Lake Superior, have been found in Missouri glacial deposits. Even\r\ndiamonds from an unknown source in the north were carried by the ice\r\ndown into the United States. The history of the glaciation is a\r\nspectacular account of changes which our continent has undergone in the\r\ngeological past.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Glacial scratches on boulder carried by the large\r\n    glacier in northern Missouri long ago. Boulder from near Columbia.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Quartz\r\n\r\nQuartz is a mineral of wide-spread occurrence which is characterized by\r\nthe following properties: (1) it is considerably harder than glass or\r\nsteel, (2) it has a high luster, glassy to oily, (3) it breaks with an\r\nirregular or rough glistening fracture, and (4) it crystallizes in\r\nsix-sided crystals when it grows unobstructed. Ordinary acids do not\r\nattack quartz, and it is relatively unaffected by chemical weathering in\r\nMissouri. Its composition is silicon dioxide, SiO₂.\r\n\r\nQuartz occurs in granite as the lustrous, partially rounded grains which\r\nconstitute perhaps 20% of the rock (feldspar makes up most of the more\r\nopaque remainder which breaks with many small flat faces), and is\r\nrecognized in the small glistening grains in the porphyry. Hence it is\r\nan important igneous rock-forming mineral.\r\n\r\nSandstone in Missouri is made almost entirely of quartz grains which\r\nhave been broken, worn, and more or less rounded during their long\r\ntravel history. The sandstone formation quarried and mined near Pacific\r\nand Crystal City, named the St. Peter sandstone formation, is an\r\noutstandingly pure quartz sandstone and therefore usable in the glass\r\nindustry. It is obvious that quartz is an important constituent of\r\nsedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Lustrous, translucent quartz. The irregular fracture\r\n    and oily luster are characteristic.]\r\n\r\nFurther, in the sedimentary dolomite formation near Potosi, fine to\r\ncoarse quartz crystals line the surfaces of cavities and pockets in the\r\nstone. This cavity coating of quartz which reflects light brilliantly\r\nfrom the many small crystal faces is called drusy quartz by the\r\nmineralogist, but is locally and popularly known as “blossom rock.”\r\nThousands of pounds of “blossom rock” are sold each year for rock\r\ngardens and various ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nIn northeastern Missouri quartz crystals line the hollow, more or less\r\nspherical bodies called Geodes, which vary in size from small nuts to\r\nmelons, and weather out of the so-called Warsaw formation. Other types\r\nof hollow cavities in many Missouri rocks may contain quartz growing\r\ninward from their walls.\r\n\r\nMissouri chert is composed primarily of quartz in microscopically fine\r\ngrains; likewise, agate and petrified wood may contain abundant quartz.\r\nOther varieties are rock crystal, rose quartz, amethyst, false topaz,\r\nbloodstone, carnelian, and onyx.\r\n\r\nQuartz crystallized in an igneous rock as the hot fluid cooled through\r\nits “freezing” temperature interval, which was probably not below\r\n1000°F. In the cases of the quartz in geodes, the drusy quartz, or that\r\nin cavities within petrified wood, quartz crystals grew from ground\r\nwater solutions which must have carried very low concentrations of\r\nsilica in solution, and whose temperatures did not depart far from that\r\nof rocks buried at various depths today. Although quartz is a very\r\ncommon and abundant mineral, our specific knowledge about its transport\r\nand deposition is surprisingly meager.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Quartz crystal cluster. Crystals are six-sided. From\r\n    Arkansas.]\r\n\r\nQuartz crystals are used in large quantities in radio apparatus where it\r\nis necessary to maintain very close control on the tuning of a circuit.\r\nThis use requires quartz of highest quality and crystals above minimum\r\nsize, which have never been found in Missouri and probably are not\r\npresent. Silica production from this state is in its sandstone, tripoli,\r\nchert chats, and rock garden ornamental stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Feldspar\r\n\r\nFeldspar is a white to pink or red mineral having a glassy luster on its\r\nflat broken surfaces (cleavage faces). It will scratch window glass.\r\n\r\nIt is the most abundant mineral in granite and usually controls the\r\ncolor of that rock; for example, the red granite at Graniteville\r\ncontains red feldspar, and the pink-gray granite in the Knoblick region\r\nhas feldspar of those colors. Small bodies or bands of very coarse\r\nfeldspar, quartz, and mica (pegmatite dikes) which cut the granite may\r\ncontain crystals of feldspar large enough to be recovered as small, hand\r\nspecimens, but otherwise it does not occur in coarse fragments. The\r\nrecognizable crystals, or phenocrysts, in the porphyry are mainly\r\nfeldspar.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A large piece of feldspar showing cleavage surfaces.]\r\n\r\nFeldspar is really a family name for a group of several minerals, all of\r\nwhich are crystallized in the igneous rocks. The potassium\r\n(potash)-containing varieties, named orthoclase and microcline, occur in\r\nthe granite and porphyry, whereas plagioclase, a calcium-sodium\r\n(lime-soda) feldspar is in gabbro, diabase, and basalt.\r\n\r\nPlagioclase commonly has a thin, lath shape, is a shade of gray, and\r\nmakes up the lighter colored part of the greenish to dark gray igneous\r\nrocks. Further differences between it and orthoclase may interest the\r\nmineralogist but are of little concern to the non-technical person.\r\n\r\nPulverized feldspars are used extensively in the ceramic industries, but\r\nMissouri does not have any productive deposits. Under natural, long-time\r\nweathering processes feldspar usually decomposes to clay which may be\r\nused technically, but the usual fate of it is soil formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Mica\r\n\r\nMica, incorrectly called isinglass, is an elastic, fairly soft, platy\r\nmineral, which may be split into flakes of paper thinness. The\r\nrelatively clear variety is called muscovite, and the brownish black to\r\nblack variety is biotite, both being members of the mica family. They\r\nmay occur in Missouri in small grains in the igneous rocks, except that\r\nmuscovite may be present in sandstone, where it was deposited along with\r\nthe quartz sand.\r\n\r\nMica is used chiefly as insulating material in the electrical industry\r\nwhere large sheets are required. Another use is as window or chimney\r\nmaterial in stoves or lanterns. Missouri has no mica which is\r\nsatisfactory for these purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Porphyry, Rhyolite, Rhyolite Porphyry\r\n\r\nPorphyry and granite are the two most abundant igneous rocks in\r\nsoutheastern Missouri (Iron, Madison, and St. Francois counties, and\r\nadjacent country). The porphyry there is a compact, very fine-grained,\r\nalmost glassy, hard, brittle rock that varies in color from light gray\r\nthrough pink and red to dark purplish red and almost black. It always\r\nbreaks with a horny, flinty fracture. Small mineral crystals of\r\nglistening quartz and usually reddish feldspar are generally scattered\r\nthroughout the dense background (groundmass). The crystals are commonly\r\nabout one-sixteenth of an inch in cross section and ordinarily\r\nconstitute from about ten to twenty per cent of the rock. Other names,\r\nsomewhat more specific than simple porphyry, which are applied\r\ntechnically to certain phases of the rock are rhyolite, and rhyolite\r\nporphyry.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Rhyolite porphyry showing phenocrysts (light\r\n    “freckles”) of quartz and feldspar. From near Ironton.]\r\n\r\nThe porphyry of southeastern Missouri is igneous rock which in the main\r\npoured out as lava flows, millions of years ago. Volcanic dust or “ash”\r\nwas erupted during the same period, and layers of it, now strongly\r\ncemented, are found in association with the flow rock.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri rhyolite porphyry has about the same chemical composition\r\n(see page 40) as Missouri granite, but whereas granite is\r\ncoarse-grained, the porphyry has an extremely fine-grained to almost\r\nglassy ground-mass. This difference in texture (grain size) is due to\r\nthe difference in rate of solidification. The porphyry lava flows\r\nchilled and solidified very rapidly, thereby freezing the liquid to\r\nglassy and extremely fine-grained rock, except for the scattered larger\r\ncrystals (phenocrysts) which had developed prior to eruption. Granite,\r\non the other hand, solidified very slowly under a thick cover of rock\r\nwhich acted as a heat insulator, and during the long time of\r\nsolidification large or coarse grains of minerals could grow and develop\r\nby crystallization so that a coarse-textured rock (granite) was formed.\r\n\r\nThe relative ages of the Missouri igneous rocks are of interest to\r\ngeologists and to most persons who recognize the different types within\r\na small area. It has been found that the prophyry was invaded by the\r\ngranitic liquid, that both the porphyry and granite were cracked after\r\nsolidification, and that liquid basalt rose and filled the cracks. Hence\r\nthe porphyry is the oldest, the granite next in age, and the basalt is\r\nyoungest. In fact, it may be mentioned in passing that some basalt and\r\nallied dikes have been found cutting through the sedimentary sandstone,\r\nshale, and limestone which overlie the igneous granite and porphyry and\r\nare much younger.\r\n\r\nMissouri porphyry has little use or value other than of bulk or crushed\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Basalt\r\n\r\nBasalt is a fine-grained, dark-gray, dark-green, or greenish-black rock\r\nwhich is hard enough to be scratched with difficulty by steel. It\r\noriginated by the solidification of lava. Today, basalt rock is forming\r\nwhere lava at the Hawaiian volcanoes solidifies.\r\n\r\nThe relatively small amount of basalt in southeastern Missouri\r\nsolidified mostly in cracks within other rocks through which it rose.\r\nThose occurrences—that is, fillings in nearly vertical cracks—are called\r\ndikes. The basalt dikes in southeastern Missouri have been exposed by\r\nthe weathering and erosion of rocks which previously covered them.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A dark dike of basalt in granite near Silver Mines.]\r\n\r\nIn northern Missouri, boulders of basalt may be found in deposits of\r\nglacial clay, sand, and gravel (glacial drift), where they were left\r\nafter the melting of the great ice sheet which brought the basalt down\r\nfrom ancient dikes and igneous bodies cropping out in the northern\r\nUnited States and Canada. Many of the boulders have been rounded by\r\nweathering, and their shape, together with their dark color, has\r\nstimulated the local name “niggerhead” for them.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Basalt in hand specimen.]\r\n\r\nBasalt is a strong, tough, well-knit rock that will withstand heavy\r\nblows from a sledge hammer, which usually rebounds upon striking. Except\r\nfor use as rubble stones, basalt has no commercial value. It weathers\r\ncharacteristically to a yellowish, brownish, or reddish surface coating\r\nof iron oxide and clay.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Gabbro and Diabase\r\n\r\nGabbro and Diabase are dark-colored, coarse-grained, hard igneous rocks,\r\nwhich may be found in the granite and porphyry regions of southeastern\r\nMissouri and as separate boulders in the glacial deposits north of the\r\nMissouri River. Both resemble basalt, which has been described in detail\r\nelsewhere, except that basalt is fine-grained, whereas gabbro and\r\ndiabase are coarse-grained (separate grains easily distinguished without\r\na magnifying glass). The layman is ordinarily not concerned with the\r\ntechnical differences between gabbro and diabase, which appear about the\r\nsame. Both contain plagioclase feldspar (see FELDSPAR) and a dark green\r\nmineral of the pyroxene family.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Diabase hand specimen. From near Roselle.]\r\n\r\nGabbro and Diabase are sometimes called “black granite.” Their chief use\r\nis as bulk or rubble-stone, although special varieties may be used for\r\nbuilding purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Coal\r\n\r\nCoal is so well known that little need be written about its\r\ndistinguishing characteristics. Most of the coal in Missouri is of about\r\nbituminous rank, although some cannel coal, which is discussed below, is\r\nalso present.\r\n\r\nMissouri bituminous coal occurs in the northern and western parts of the\r\nstate. It contains bands of dull coal, bands of glistening “glance”\r\ncoal, the sooty “mineral charcoal,” and common mineral impurities like\r\ncalcite, gypsum, pyrite and marcasite (“sulphur”), clay minerals, and\r\nquartz. Bituminous coal breaks with essentially a cubical fracture.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in horizontal or nearly horizontal beds or “seams,” which may\r\nbe followed considerable distances laterally without necessarily\r\nencountering much change. Usually, a fire clay or a fire clay-like\r\nunder-clay immediately underlies the coal, but the overlying rock (the\r\nroof) may be shale (slate? see discussion of SHALE), sandstone, or less\r\ncommonly, limestone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Bed of coal exposed by stream erosion, near\r\n    Columbia.]\r\n\r\nCoal originates from pre-existing plants and may be thought of as Mother\r\nNature’s storage cellar of “preserved” plant life. The Missouri coal\r\nbegan millions of years ago as mosses, tree-like ferns, conifers, and\r\nvarious plants that reproduce by spores, which flourished in great\r\nwide-spread swamps. Insects were abundant, as is indicated by their\r\nremains. Rain was probably plentiful and climate favorable, so that such\r\nvegetation thrived luxuriantly. Today, fallen forest timber of the\r\nhighland disappears by oxidizing and decaying in the air; but in swamp\r\nland the leaves, stems, pollen and woody trunks fall into and under\r\nwater and under favorable conditions decompose through bacterial and\r\nchemical action into layers and pools of slippery, oozy, blackish humic\r\ngel (like brownish black gelatin, “jello”), which remains. Likewise, in\r\nages past, more and more plant material continued to live, fall, and\r\naccumulate in the old coal swamps until very thick deposits of the woody\r\ngel existed.\r\n\r\nEventually land-sea or climatic conditions changed, and plant life died\r\nout as mud, sand, or other rock-forming material was swept in to cover,\r\nas a lid, the stored-up plant remains. The weight of overlying beds\r\nsqueezed out excess water from the woody gel, and from the time of\r\ncovering through the present day, gases (like mine gases), and other\r\nvolatile constituents of the coal have been given off.\r\n\r\nA bed of coal, which consists chiefly of black combustible carbon, with\r\nvolatile constituents and non-volatile ash substances, has resulted. Man\r\nuses the coal by burning it directly, or it may be coked and the\r\nvolatile constituents recovered in coal tar and other compounds. The\r\nmineral impurities like the calcite, gypsum, clay, sand, and brassy\r\npyrite or marcasite, are shaken through the grates as ash or melted as\r\nclinkers.\r\n\r\nIn nature, the pyrite and marcasite minerals may oxidize in ground water\r\npercolating over them to form dilute sulphuric acid, the acid mine\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nCannel coal in Missouri has been found chiefly in old sinkhole deposits\r\nthrough part of central Missouri. It is characterized by fracturing\r\nconchoidally and having a more massive structure (instead of the layered\r\nstructure common to bituminous coal). Cannel coal burns to a very hot,\r\nrather quick fire because of high volatile content, and is thought to\r\nhave developed from accumulations very rich in plant spores.\r\n\r\nCoal mining is an important industry in Missouri, and a special bulletin\r\non coal has been published by the State Geological Survey at Rolla,\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Pyrite and Marcasite\r\n\r\nPyrite and Marcasite (Fool’s gold, “sulphur”) are brassy yellow,\r\nmetallic, heavy minerals which will scratch glass but which cannot\r\nthemselves be scratched by a knife, and which will leave a dark-greenish\r\nto black mark or streak when rubbed across unglazed porcelain or chert\r\nrock. Both are composed of iron sulphide, FeS₂—iron 46.6 per cent, and\r\nsulphur 53.4 per cent. Although they have the same chemical composition,\r\nthey differ in internal atomic and crystalline structure, which is of\r\ninterest to scientific mineralogists. Pyrite may crystallize in cubes,\r\nor in forms called pyritohedrons, named from pyrite, whereas marcasite\r\ncrystallizes in characteristic arrow-shaped or cockscomb forms.\r\nMarcasite weathers a little more readily than does pyrite, but otherwise\r\nthey are much the same to the casual observer.\r\n\r\nPyrite and marcasite have been called “fool’s gold” because so many\r\npersons have been fooled, sometimes with serious financial consequences,\r\nby their slight resemblance to true gold. True gold is soft, usually\r\nslightly orange-yellow in color, malleable, and unaffected by ordinary\r\nacids; and it leaves a gold-colored streak when rubbed on unglazed\r\nporcelain or a hard white rock. Pyrite, in contrast, is quite hard\r\n(harder than steel), is brassy yellow with perhaps a slight greenish\r\ntinge except where tarnished, is brittle, is corroded by acids or\r\noxidizing ground waters, and leaves a greenish black to black streak on\r\na white rock. One readily notices the difference in color between pyrite\r\nand gold (such as is in a piece of good quality jewelry), when the two\r\nare viewed close together. Yellowish, partially weathered mica has also\r\nbeen mistaken for gold.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Brassy, granular pyrite in hand specimen.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pyrite in crystal cubes, and replacement of fossils.]\r\n\r\nPyrite and marcasite occur abundantly in most of the metal-mining\r\ndistricts of Missouri, as the “brass,” or “sulphur balls,” etc., in\r\ncoal, as small nodules or pellets in some limestone, shale and\r\nsandstone, as replacements of fossils, and as minute crystals in\r\ngranite, porphyry, and the other igneous rocks. Several marcasite mines\r\nhave been developed in old sinkhole deposits in south central Missouri,\r\nbut these are not in production at the time of this writing. The\r\nsinkhole iron mines of south central Missouri contained pyrite-marcasite\r\nbefore oxidation to the iron oxide ore, and some of them still contain\r\nthe sulphides in their lower levels.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Marcasite crystal cluster from Joplin region. The\r\n    arrowhead or cockscomb crystal form is characteristic of marcasite.]\r\n\r\nMarcasite weathers (oxidizes) very readily under most conditions, with\r\nthe formation of (1) yellowish brown iron oxide, the mineral limonite,\r\nwhich may stain rocks, soil, stream bank, etc., and (2) weak sulphuric\r\nacid water. The sulphuric acid solution may react with more marcasite or\r\npyrite and evolve a gas, hydrogen sulphide, H₂S, which has a rotten-egg\r\nodor. This explains the foul odor often noticed around old coal mine\r\ndumps. Heat is evolved in these reactions, and coal waste on the dump\r\nmay be ignited by the heat of the chemical reactions. The burning\r\npyrite, or elemental sulphur, gives off sulphur dioxide, “burning\r\nsulphur fumes,” which add to the odor and heat around a coal mine dump.\r\nThe burning coal waste and the chemical reactions may raise the\r\ntemperature of the coal waste pile high enough to fire or “burn” the\r\nshale rock to a red, partially vitrified, natural brick-like material,\r\nwhich is sold or distributed as “coal dump shale” or “burned shale,” or\r\n“red shale” for all-weather surfacing of drives or walks.\r\n\r\nPyrite and marcasite have been used in the commercial manufacture of\r\nsulphuric acid, but elemental sulphur can now be utilized more\r\neconomically, so that now no market exists for pyrite or marcasite in\r\nMissouri. In earlier times only large deposits containing thousands of\r\ntons of the mineral had any value. In some foreign countries pyrite is\r\nburned and the fumes utilized for the manufacture of sulphuric acid,\r\nwhile the cinder, an iron oxide and iron ore, is smelted to recover\r\nmetallic iron.\r\n\r\nThe origin of pyrite and marcasite is as variable as its enclosing rock.\r\nNo general statement can be made which will include the igneous rock\r\npyrite, the Joplin marcasite, the “sulphur” of the coal, and occurrences\r\nin sink holes and various sedimentary rocks. A discussion of all these\r\norigins alone would fill a pamphlet as large as this one on Missouri\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Conglomerate\r\n\r\nConglomerate is a rock composed of gravel, pebbles, and boulders\r\ncemented together, with more or less sand and clay between the larger\r\nfragments. It is truly a conglomeration of rock fragments as one would\r\nfind loose today in a stream or ocean shore gravel bar, or in a hillside\r\ngravel bank. Probably the conglomerate most abundantly exposed in\r\nMissouri is that overlying the igneous rocks in the southeast part of\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Gneiss\r\n\r\nGneiss is a hard, granular rock which exhibits a coarsely banded\r\nstructure (resulting from metamorphism). The bands are evident because\r\nof color differences due to different mineral content; those dark in\r\ncolor are commonly rich in dark mica (biotite) or hornblende (a dark\r\ngreen to black, hard mineral), whereas the light bands contain feldspar\r\nand quartz. Many gneisses have about the same mineral composition as\r\ngranite; hence, for our nontechnical purposes, a banded rock, otherwise\r\ngranite-like, is a gneiss.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Gneiss typically banded.]\r\n\r\nGneiss is a metamorphic rock, a _changed_ rock. The banded structure was\r\ndeveloped by a combination of very high pressure, high temperature, and\r\nsolutions acting on a previously existing rock in essentially a solid\r\ncondition. The original rock may have been an igneous or sedimentary\r\nrock which has been crushed or made to flow into bands, or has been\r\nre-crystallized. The tremendous pressure which operated during the\r\nbanding of most gneisses also crumpled square miles of rock thousands of\r\nfeet thick into folded and broken (faulted) mountains. True slates,\r\nmarbles, and some quartzites are formed from soft shales, limestones,\r\nand sandstones, respectively, in the metamorphic process.\r\n\r\nAlmost no metamorphic rock of this regional type crops out in Missouri,\r\nbut the boulders of gneiss which are found in the glacial deposits were\r\npicked up in Canada or the northern United States and carried to\r\nMissouri by a continental glacier thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nExcept for use as bulk stone or possible structural purposes the gneiss\r\nin Missouri has no value. The glistening yellowish mica sometimes seen\r\nin gneiss is not gold, of course, and is likewise valueless.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Hematite\r\n\r\nHematite (“keel”) is a heavy, red to purplish red, dull to glistening\r\nmineral which leaves a red mark or streak when rubbed on a hard white\r\nrock (like chert) or on unglazed porcelain. This red color of hematite\r\ncoating or stain is responsible for our red clays, red soils, red iron\r\nrust, reddish creek-water, and almost every bit of natural, red mineral\r\nmatter in Missouri. Hematite is iron oxide, Fe₂O₃, and has a close\r\nassociate, limonite, which is yellow to brown in color, and has the\r\nchemical composition Fe₂O₃·nH₂O. The two are mentioned together here\r\nbecause they are commonly associated in nature, where they can be\r\nrecognized in mixture by the yellowish red or reddish brown colors on\r\nrocks or soils. Individual discussion is given limonite under its\r\nheading, but its relationship to hematite is repeated here for obvious\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Hematite: glistening, fine-grained, and dark red.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Hematite makes a deep red mark or streak on a hard\r\n    white rock or unglazed porcelain.]\r\n\r\nHematite varies in hardness enough that some specimens can be scratched\r\neasily with iron, whereas others are almost as hard as that metal\r\nitself. Where clay occurs mixed with hematite, as in paint ore, it may\r\nbe quite soft, but “blue kidney ore” is usually hard.\r\n\r\nHematite is the ore (iron ore) mineral at Iron Mountain and Pilot Knob\r\nmining districts and in the various sink-hole mines or pits in south\r\ncentral Missouri. Scattered boulders of hematite occur in non-commercial\r\nquantities within a shaly layer (lower part of Pennsylvanian age rocks)\r\nwhich crops out extensively in central Missouri, and the finding of\r\nthese boulders has at times, unfortunately, stimulated short-lived hopes\r\nof locating a valuable deposit of iron ore. Flaming red soil or\r\nmountains of red solid rock (as are present in western United States)\r\nmay be colored by less than five per cent iron oxide and are in no sense\r\niron ore because the iron is not concentrated. Iron is the fourth most\r\nabundant element in the earth’s crust, but workable iron mines and\r\ndeposits are few and far between. To be commercially valuable an iron\r\nore deposit must contain tens of thousands of tons and be relatively\r\nfree from impurities, notably sulphur and phosphorus. Hence, not many\r\nMissouri farms are locations of iron ore deposits.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Missouri hematite is about as diverse as its occurrences.\r\nHot iron-rich solutions coming from an igneous source below are believed\r\nto have introduced the hematite in the Iron Mountain-Pilot Knob area,\r\nbut the sink-hole hematite resulted from the oxidation of iron sulphide.\r\nWeathering of older iron-containing rocks and minerals gave rise to the\r\ncoloring hematite seen on our sub-soil and surface rock.\r\n\r\nHematite is used as a polishing agent, as a pigment in paint, and, of\r\ncourse, as an ore of metallic iron. In the smelting of iron from\r\nhematite the ore is mixed in a huge, chimney-shaped blast furnace with\r\ncoke (from coal) and limestone. Air is blown into the furnace as into a\r\nblacksmith’s forge; and the coke and gasses, burning at an incandescent\r\nheat, take the oxygen from the Fe₂O₃, leaving metallic iron which melts\r\nand is run out of the furnace at periodic intervals. Thus the smelting\r\nprocess is the opposite of the rusting process. The impurities and\r\ncinder run out as molten slag.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Limonite\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Dark brown limonite.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Stalactitic limonite from southeastern Missouri.]\r\n\r\nLimonite is a heavy, yellow to brown, or brownish black mineral which\r\nalways leaves a yellow to brown mark or streak when rubbed across a hard\r\nwhite rock or unglazed porcelain. It usually has a dull luster on a\r\nbroken surface, and may vary from thumb-nail hardness to almost that of\r\nsteel. The distinguishing test is its yellow to brown streak.\r\n\r\nIn composition limonite is iron oxide which contains more or less water\r\nchemically combined, Fe₂O₃·nH₂O. That is, it may be dried bone-dry at\r\nthe temperature of boiling water, but upon heating to redness the\r\nadditional, chemically held water will be driven off.\r\n\r\nLimonite is ordinarily formed from the weathering of other\r\niron-containing minerals (pyrite, for example) and is therefore a\r\nwide-spread mineral in surface rock, in films on pools of water, and in\r\nsoil, all of which it colors yellow to brown. In fact, almost all of the\r\nyellow to brown inorganic mineral color and stain seen in nature is that\r\nof limonite.\r\n\r\nCommercial deposits of limonite occur in southeastern Missouri where\r\nlarge boulders, discontinuous and irregular lenses or beds, pipes,\r\nnodules, and gravel to clay-sized particles of the mineral are\r\nassociated with the cherty, gravelly residual clay. Usually the ore is\r\ncrushed, hand-sorted, and washed preparatory to concentration for\r\nshipment to a furnace or for use in cement manufacture. As in the case\r\nof hematite, unless one has a deposit amounting to thousands of tons of\r\nore it has little commercial value, and unless the mineral is relatively\r\npure it can not be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Paint Ore or Red Ochre\r\n\r\nAn intensely red-colored, clayey iron ore has been mined for paint\r\npigment in several deposits in south central Missouri. It occurs in sink\r\nhole deposits like those containing fire clay. Brown ocher may be\r\navailable from southeast Missouri.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Iron Band Diaspore\r\n\r\nShells of red or reddish brown iron oxide occur about cores of diaspore\r\nclay in some of those deposits south of the Missouri River. Previously\r\nthis material had no value, but in the last few years it has been\r\npurchased for and shipped to a cement company, which used it in the\r\nmanufacture of cement. Diaspore clay is discussed elsewhere in this\r\npamphlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Manganese Ore\r\n\r\nSeveral manganese minerals make up the manganese ore which occurs to a\r\nlimited extent in southeast Missouri, principally in Shannon, Reynolds,\r\nCarter, Iron, and Madison counties. Although the Missouri manganese\r\nminerals are usually heavy, black or nearly so, and have a black or\r\nbrownish-black mark or streak, the identification of the individual\r\nminerals is difficult and should be left to a technically trained\r\nmineralogist.\r\n\r\nManganese minerals are used in the chemical industry and in the\r\nproduction of certain kinds of iron. A special report on the manganese\r\ndeposits of Missouri is available at the Missouri Geological Survey,\r\nRolla, Missouri.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Galena\r\n\r\nGalena (“lead”) is a heavy, soft, somewhat brittle ore of lead. It has a\r\nbrilliant metallic luster, and silvery gray color on a freshly broken\r\nsurface. Where weathered it appears dull gray. It can be scratched with\r\na knife, and breaks with surfaces at 90°, forming cubes. The unbroken,\r\noriginal crystal form of galena which has grown unobstructed in a vein\r\nopening is commonly cubical in habit or a modification thereof. It\r\nleaves a dark, lead-gray to black mark or streak when rubbed across\r\nunglazed porcelain or chert.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A “cube” of galena.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cluster of galena crystals from Joplin region.]\r\n\r\nGalena is lead sulphide, PbS, and when pure contains 86.6 per cent lead\r\nand 13.4 per cent sulphur. Small amounts of silver may also be present.\r\n\r\nGalena commonly occurs in Missouri as a cavity filling in crushed\r\nlimestone or chert, or as a replacement in limestone or dolomite, or in\r\nshale, so that a large quantity of practically worthless enclosing rock\r\n(gangue) must be taken out in order to obtain the desired galena. If a\r\nperson desires to estimate the value of his galena (lead) prospect by\r\nhaving an analysis or assay made of his ore, he must include in his\r\nsample the gangue rock that would of necessity have to be taken out when\r\nmining his ore. Too often persons carefully select for analysis a choice\r\ngalena specimen which may run over 80% lead, only to find that as a\r\npractical mine product it would be reduced to less than 5% lead in all\r\nthe rock which also would have to be taken out.\r\n\r\nAfter a galena ore is mined it is customarily crushed and the galena\r\nremoved from the gangue by a gravity-separation process which takes\r\nadvantage of the difference in “heaviness” (specific gravity) between\r\ngalena (7.5) and limestone (calcite) or chert (2.7-2.6), or by a froth\r\nflotation process in which the galena is preferentially wetted and\r\ncarried off by an oily froth or foam. The galena concentrate is roasted\r\nto burn out the sulphur, reduced by carbon, and smelted to metallic\r\nlead. The origin of some Missouri lead deposits is debatable, but the\r\nwriter believes the most reasonable explanation to be that warm,\r\nchemically active waters arose from an igneous body below and carried to\r\nthe place of deposition the lead which they held in solution.\r\n\r\nMissouri is one of the leading producers of lead in the world from its\r\nFlat River, Fredericktown, Joplin, and central Missouri districts, from\r\nwhich in 1941 lead concentrates having a value of over $15,000,000 were\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Sphalerite\r\n\r\nSphalerite (locally called Jack, Rosin Jack, Black Jack, Ruby Jack,\r\nZinc, Rosin Spar) is a tan-brown, resinous, brown or brownish black\r\nmineral having a very high luster on its broken (cleavage) surfaces.\r\nMuch of it so strongly resembles lump rosin that the term “Rosin Jack”\r\nis truly descriptive. Less commonly, a ruby red variety occurs as\r\ncrystals perched on other sphalerite or on waste rock. Sphalerite is\r\nreadily scratched with steel. Its chemical composition is zinc sulphide,\r\nZnS—zinc 67 per cent, sulphur 33 per cent—and it is an important ore of\r\nzinc.\r\n\r\nSphalerite occurs abundantly in the mining district of southwest\r\nMissouri, but small, non-commercial amounts of it have been found\r\nthrough an area extending even north of the Missouri River. At the\r\nmines, after the ore and rock are taken out, they are crushed and\r\nseparated, the ore going to the smelter and the rock to tailings piles.\r\nUnder the old milling process employed in south_western_ Missouri,\r\nthousands of tons of coarse tailings, largely chert, were poured onto\r\nhuge “chat” piles, many of which remain as a low-priced by-product for\r\nsome one to put to use. This chat differs mineralogically from the\r\nsouth_eastern_ Missouri chat, which is largely dolomite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Sphalerite from near Joplin.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Barite (“Tiff”)\r\n\r\nBarite (“Tiff” in south_east_ Missouri, Heavy Spar, Barytes) occurs in\r\nMissouri predominantly as a white, quite heavy, soft, non-metallic\r\nmineral which has a high luster on a freshly broken surface. Slightly\r\nbluish “glass” barite or “glass tiff” has been found in smaller quantity\r\nwith the more abundant, opaque white material. The glassy barite may\r\nsuperficially resemble calcite or selenite gypsum, but in distinction,\r\nbarite breaks or cleaves to surfaces joining at right angles and does\r\nnot effervesce with acid, whereas calcite does effervesce in acid and\r\ncleaves at oblique angles (rhombohedral cleavage). Gypsum is so soft\r\nthat it can be scratched very easily with the thumb-nail, whereas barite\r\nis scratched with difficulty, if at all, by the thumb-nail. Notably,\r\nagain, barite is “heavy,” with a specific gravity of about 4.5, whereas\r\ncalcite, gypsum, limestone, and chert are “lighter,” with a specific\r\ngravity of about 2.6 to 2.7. Barite has the composition barium sulphate,\r\nBaSO₄, of which barium oxide constitutes 65.7 per cent.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Three pieces of barite, the crested and bladed form\r\n    at the left, “glass” barite in the center, and a small crystal at\r\n    the right.]\r\n\r\nBarite occurs in abundance in the Jefferson-Washington counties\r\ndistrict, which furnishes about 80% of Missouri production. Other\r\nproduction comes from near Houston, Texas county, and from the central\r\ndistrict—Miller, Moniteau, Morgan, Cole counties, and adjacent\r\nterritory. In the Jefferson-Washington counties district, it is dug from\r\nresidual clay over dolomite and is run through washing and concentrating\r\nmills which remove the clay and lighter waste rock. Most of the central\r\ndistrict production comes from old sinkhole deposits, the ore being also\r\ncrushed, washed, and concentrated in preparation for shipment. Missouri\r\nbarite which was produced during 1941 had a value of over $1,300,000 and\r\nconstituted about 40% of the total United States productions.\r\n\r\nBarite is used as a paint pigment and extender, as a flux, as a source\r\nof barium in the chemical industry, as a filler in rubber, paper, oil\r\ncloth, textiles, and leather, and as a heavy substance in oil well\r\ndrilling mud. The largest single use is in the manufacture of lithopone\r\npaint.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Gypsum\r\n\r\nGypsum is a soft mineral which can be scratched easily with the finger\r\nor thumb-nail. It may be glassy or transparent, or may grade into an\r\nopaque white body, possibly stained by iron oxide, but it is always very\r\nsoft. Of the three varieties of gypsum—selenite, alabaster, and\r\nsatinspar—only the first two have been found in Missouri by the writer.\r\nThe chemical composition of gypsum is CaSO₄·2H₂O.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Transparent, flexible variety of gypsum (selenite).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fine-grained, white, opaque gypsum (alabaster).]\r\n\r\nThe chief use of gypsum is in the manufacture of plaster of paris,\r\nduring which it is pulverized and heated to drive off part of the water\r\nof crystallization so that its composition corresponds to CaSO₄·½H₂O.\r\nThis powder, when mixed with water and poured into a mold, heats and\r\nsets; that is, it hardens by taking up enough of the water to restore\r\nits original composition.\r\n\r\nAlthough thick, wide-spread beds of gypsum occur in other localities,\r\nprobably most of the gypsum in Missouri has been secondarily formed, as\r\nfrom the reaction of sulphuric acid from oxidizing pyrite on calcite;\r\nand its quantity is limited to small crystals, veins, and crusts in or\r\non other rocks. Gypsum may be an impurity in coal, and some beautiful\r\ncrystals a few inches long have been found in weathering clay deposits.\r\nIt therefore cannot be considered as a commercially valuable mineral of\r\nthis state.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Meteorites\r\n\r\nMeteorites, the rock-like specimens which have come to our earth as\r\nsparkling meteors in the sky, are perhaps the most prized specimens\r\nwhich the average collector hopes to find, and perhaps more specimens\r\nare mistaken for meteorites than for any other geological substance.\r\nMeteorites are rare and not easy to find; they are also not easy to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nThe iron variety is usually a heavy, roughly-pitted, brown, tough,\r\nmetallic, nickel alloy of iron. Therefore, a positive chemical test for\r\nnickel is usually strongly suggestive of a meteoric origin, but\r\nconfirmation almost requires that a surface be polished and etched with\r\ndilute acids to bring out typical and characteristic structures.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The polished and acid-etched surface of an iron\r\n    meteorite. Shows the Widmanstatten figures characteristic of iron\r\n    meteorites. (Photo courtesy of American Museum of Natural History,\r\n    New York).]\r\n\r\nThe stony variety of meteorites usually contains a rock-forming mineral\r\ncalled olivine, beneath its pitted brown surface. In case of either\r\nvariety, since special equipment is required for final testing and\r\ndetermination, it is recommended that this be done at a laboratory\r\nappropriately equipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Gold\r\n\r\nGold is not known to occur in Missouri, except for very small quantities\r\nwhich have been carried into the state with the glacial deposits in the\r\nnorth half. Miners have searched carefully, and geologists have studied\r\nMissouri rocks intently, comparing them with the gold veins of the\r\nwestern states, but they find no promise of a gold deposit in Missouri.\r\nWe have been favored with other geological products, but it is a waste\r\nof time to search for gold in Missouri.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Silver\r\n\r\nSilver has been recovered from ore in the Silver Mines area in Madison\r\ncounty and from the galena of southeastern Missouri. Except for\r\noccurrences within the igneous rock area and the lead mining regions,\r\ngeologists do not expect to find additional silver ore deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Diamonds\r\n\r\nNo diamond has ever been found in native Missouri rock. It is possible\r\nfor diamonds to have been carried into the state with the glacial\r\ndeposits in the northern part, but the probability of finding one, if it\r\ndid come in, is extremely remote.\r\n\r\nDiamonds do occur in one part of Arkansas, but those rocks are\r\nstrikingly different from all Missouri rocks except in a few localities,\r\nhaving small areas about the size of one’s house, in the southeastern\r\npart of the state. The writer has received quartz and calcite crystals\r\nfor testing from persons who hoped they might be diamonds. It is almost\r\na foregone conclusion that diamonds do not occur in Missouri.\r\n\r\nA diamond may be recognized by its extreme hardness. It is the hardest\r\nsubstance known, natural or artificial, and will scratch any known\r\nsubstance; but it, in turn, is scratched only by another diamond. Acids\r\ndo not affect diamonds in the least.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Uranium Minerals\r\n\r\nThree uranium-containing minerals, tyuyamunite (pronounced\r\ntyew-yuh-moon-ite), possibly carnotite, and metatorbernite, have been\r\nfound in Missouri but none has been mined commercially. Tyuyamunite and\r\ncarnotite are canary yellow powdery minerals so similar in appearance\r\nthey can be differentiated only by chemical and x-ray properties. Both\r\nminerals contain uranium, vanadium, oxygen, water, and one other\r\nelement, which, if it is calcium, the mineral is tyuyamunite, but if it\r\nis potassium the mineral is carnotite. The canary yellow color referred\r\nto is distinctly different from the brownish or reddish yellow color of\r\niron oxide minerals. These yellow uranium minerals have been found near\r\nSte. Genevieve along cracks in limestone and in the black shale above\r\nthe limestone, and in dark, sandy shales near Shelbina, and elsewhere\r\nnorth of the Missouri River.\r\n\r\nBlack shales (high in organic matter) of marine origin are the most\r\nhighly radioactive, whereas black shales deposited on land (as with\r\ncoal), and all shales of other colors are usually lower in\r\nradioactivity.\r\n\r\nMetatorbernite is a soft, pale apple-green scaly mineral that has been\r\nfound in paper-thin cracks in flint fire clay deposits.

All of these uranium\r\nminerals activate a Geiger counter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MISCELLANEOUS ROCK STRUCTURES\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Concretions\r\n\r\nA concretion is an aggregate of inorganic matter in the shape, roughly,\r\nof a ball, disc, rod, or irregular nodular body. Usually the aggregation\r\nor accumulation started around a small center grain or particle and\r\ncontinued in the growth of layers about it like the shells of an onion,\r\nor in the growth of needle-like fibers which radiate from the center\r\nlike pins stuck into a spherical pin cushion. Concretions vary in size\r\nfrom buck-shot (buck-shot concretions in the soil) to oddities ten or\r\ntwenty feet in diameter, or even longer in elongate forms. The variety\r\nabout one-sixteenth or one-thirty-second of an inch in diameter is\r\ncalled an oolite (pronounced oh-oh-lite). Some chert of southern\r\nMissouri, most of the diaspore and burley clay, and a limestone cropping\r\nout near Louisiana, Missouri, are made up partly to almost entirely of\r\noolites. See page 29.\r\n\r\nConcretions may be composed of pyrite, calcite, limonite, chert,\r\ncemented sandstone, or even cemented clay. They are usually recognized\r\nby their structure after the previously enclosing rock has been eroded.\r\nThus pyrite, limonite, or calcite (limestone) concretions remain after\r\nshale has softened and washed away, chert remains after limestone, and\r\nstrongly cemented “irony” (limonite or hematite) or siliceous sandstone\r\nconcretions may be found on the outcrop where the softer or less\r\nresistant host rock has been carried off. The irregular-shaped,\r\nintergrown, nodular limestone concretions (sometimes called\r\n“loess-kinder”, or loess dolls) in the upper part of loess deposits\r\nalong the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers can be found remaining on\r\nrain-washed slopes. Limy, mudstone concretions and brown iron carbonate\r\nconcretions are abundant in certain localities in northwestern and\r\nsoutheastern Missouri, where they are used as oddities in rock gardens\r\nor walls.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Concretions. Dark, limy concretion at left and brassy\r\n    pyrite at center and right. Note the inter-grown pair in center.]\r\n\r\nSome concretions are formed at the same general time as the surrounding\r\nrock accumulates, but others may be formed years after the surrounding\r\nrock has been buried or removed from the environment of its formation.\r\nIn either case, deposition of the mineral matter follows the pattern of\r\naddition or “growth” from inside out. This growth, of course, does not\r\ninvolve a life process like that of a plant or animal. If two or more\r\ncenters of deposition occur close together, the several growing\r\nconcretions may touch, intergrow, and develop some weird forms,\r\nsuggesting organic growth. However odd these curiosities may become,\r\nthere is no question that they are not fossils, or evidence of life.\r\nProbably concretions excite the interest of persons more than any other\r\nrock structure.\r\n\r\nGround water, carrying calcium carbonate, silica, or iron compounds in\r\nsolution, is a great concretion builder. It percolates through sandstone\r\nor other permeable rock and slowly leaves behind enveloping layers or\r\nadditions of mineral matter, until a concretion is formed, to remain\r\nhidden from view until its host rock is softened and removed by the\r\naction of the weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Geodes\r\n\r\nA geode is usually a hollow, more or less spherical or ball-shaped shell\r\nof mineral and crystal growth which has formed within surrounding rock.\r\nMissouri geodes commonly vary in size from hickory nuts to small\r\nwatermelons, although neither direction of variation is limited. They\r\nweather out abundantly at several localities in northeast Missouri from\r\nthe so-called Warsaw formation, a limy shale. Here they are dark brown,\r\nrough and irregular on the outside, but where broken open show many\r\nbrilliant, glistening faces of intergrown quartz crystals. Less\r\nfrequently calcite, chalcedony, kaolinite, and rarely millerite (nickel\r\nsulphide) may occur in Missouri geodes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Typical small geode from northeastern Missouri.]\r\n\r\nThe minerals and crystals of a geode grow inward from the walls of a\r\ncavity in the rocks. The mineral matter is carried there in solution by\r\nground water and crystallizes out very much more slowly but in the same\r\nmanner that sugar or salt crystals develop in a saturated solution of\r\nthose substances. If crystal growth continues until the geode is solid,\r\nit may bear superficial resemblance to a concretion, but the latter\r\nstructure is one which has grown outward. The idea of “growth” in either\r\ncase is that of mineral crystallization and enlargement, but does not in\r\nthe least involve life like that of a plant or animal. Geodes have no\r\nvalue or use other than for ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Fossils\r\n\r\nFossils are also found and collected by persons who are interested in\r\nrocks and minerals. The varied remains of plants and animals long since\r\npetrified or replaced by mineral matter have stimulated the curiosity\r\nand become a source of enjoyment to many persons, from those who merely\r\ngive a passing glance to the peculiar organic structures in the rocks to\r\nthose who make a serious hobby or business of collecting and classifying\r\nthe unreplaceable heritage from the ancient rocks. Fossils are\r\ninteresting in part because of their variety, for they include petrified\r\nwood, shells like those of oysters, fish teeth, foot-prints, amber,\r\ndinosaur eggs, coal, imprints of fern leaves, of insects, and of fishes,\r\nand the bones of small and gigantic dinosaurs and elephants. In fact, a\r\nfossil is any evidence of life in the geologic past preserved in the\r\nrocks. Missouri rocks furnish fossils ranging in size from\r\nmicroscopically small fish teeth to the big skeletal remains of the\r\nmastodon, an ancestor of the elephant; but the most common ones are the\r\nstructures and shells of ancient clams, corals, brachiopods, crinoids,\r\nand trilobites.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A tooth of a mastodon, about one-half natural size.\r\n    (Photo courtesy of Mr. J. R. Morrison, Louisiana, Missouri.)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fossils. Upper row, coral on left, trilobite on\r\n    right; center row, brachiopods; lower row, coiled cephalapod,\r\n    crinoid head, and a bryozoan spiral.]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying photographs illustrate a few fossils that may be found\r\nwithin our state, but a thorough, non-technical treatment of Missouri\r\nfossils is available in a companion volume to this booklet, “The Common\r\nFossils of Missouri” by Prof. A. G. Unklesbay, Missouri Handbook No. 4.\r\n\r\nThe study of fossils, or paleontology, is a fascinating branch of\r\ngeology which extends far beyond the recognition and cataloging of the\r\nspecimens. It has been found that certain particular fossils occur in\r\nrocks of the ages which produce petroleum, and the search for that\r\nvaluable substance has been directed in many instances by the fossil\r\ncontent of the rocks. Rocks of different ages carry different fossil\r\nassemblages, and a man skilled in paleontology utilizes the fossils in\r\ndating geologic history like the page numbers in a book of human\r\nhistory. Further, any student of present-day animals and plants is aided\r\nin his understanding of them if he knows the fossil record of their\r\nancestors of the long geologic past.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Arrow Heads and Other Indian Artifacts\r\n\r\nArrow heads, scrapers, rock knives and saws which were left by the\r\nIndians who formerly lived in Missouri may be found in moderate\r\nabundance in many parts of the state. Usually these artifacts are chert\r\nin its various colors, white, gray, mottled, reddish, or black (flint).\r\nSee the discussion of chert on page 34. Chert, because of its conchoidal\r\nfracture, lack of cleavage, resistance to chemical weathering, and\r\nsuperior hardness, is an exceptionally useful rock for making tools and\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nHammers and axes of basalt, and arrow heads of rhyolite are less\r\nabundant than the chert artifacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE ROCKS OF MISSOURI\r\n\r\n\r\nGeologists classify rocks into these groups: igneous, sedimentary or\r\nmetamorphic. Representatives of all three have been described in the\r\npreceding pages.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Arrowheads made from white, gray, pink, and black\r\n    chert. (Courtesy of Mr. A. A. Jeffrey, Columbia, Mo.)]\r\n\r\nSedimentary rocks are those whose particles settled down through the air\r\nor water to form rocks in layers or beds; hence layered, bedded, or\r\nso-called stratified rocks are sedimentary rocks. For instance, the sand\r\nand mud settling out of the Gulf of Mexico (or ocean) after being\r\nbrought in by the Mississippi River is on its way toward becoming\r\nsandstone and shale. Limestone is forming off the coast of Florida now.\r\nAll of these rocks are accumulating in layers. Where one sees\r\nregularly-layered or stratified rocks in streams, road cuts, quarries,\r\nbluffs or hillsides, he expects them to be sedimentary rocks. The\r\nsedimentary rocks that have been described herein include:\r\n\r\n  Limestone\r\n  Dolomite\r\n  Chert\r\n  Shale\r\n  Fire clay\r\n  Flint fire clay\r\n  Diaspore and Burley clay\r\n  Sandstone\r\n  Quartzite\r\n  Travertine\r\n  Coal\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks are those which solidified from a hot liquid which was\r\neither forced into older surrounding rocks (intrusive) or discharged on\r\nthe earth’s surface as a lava flow or products from a volcano\r\n(extrusive).\r\n\r\nThe examples given below illustrate the two types. Everyone knows about\r\nthe extrusive forms from accounts of present-day volcanoes and\r\noccasional lava flows, like those of Vesuvius, Paricutin, and Mauna Loa.\r\nAn intrusion was injected beneath the Yellowstone Park area years ago,\r\nand its heat, with steam and gases, is contributing to the unusual\r\nnatural features which are found in the park and which make it famous.\r\n\r\nIgneous rocks in Missouri are:\r\n\r\n  Granite\r\n  Porphyry, Rhyolite, Rhyolite porphyry\r\n  Gabbro and Diabase\r\n  Basalt\r\n\r\nMetamorphic rocks are rocks which have been changed through the effects\r\nof tremendous pressure (enough to raise mountains) and high temperature\r\nwhile in the solid state. In most cases a banded rock results. The\r\nmetamorphic rocks mentioned in this booklet are:\r\n\r\n  Gneiss\r\n  Marble\r\n\r\nNo doubt it has become apparent to the reader that rocks ordinarily\r\noccur in great quantities, that they are composed of multitudes of\r\ngrains (mineral grains), and that their properties and compositions vary\r\nwith the different minerals which are present in the grains of the rock.\r\nA _rock_ can, therefore, be different from a _mineral_. In fact, a rock\r\nmay be defined as “an aggregate of mineral particles,” or more broadly\r\n“a typical part of the earth.” To focus closer attention on minerals we\r\nmay discuss them for their own sake below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MINERALS OF MISSOURI\r\n\r\n\r\nA mineral is characterized by a constancy of composition and of\r\nproperties which sets it apart from rocks which vary widely. Minerals\r\nmay be metallic, like pyrite, or non-metallic, like barite; they may be\r\nore, like galena, or rock-forming, like quartz or feldspar; they may\r\nshow crystal faces, or they may be fragments with rounded or broken\r\nsurfaces. A favored definition teaches that “a mineral is a naturally\r\noccurring, inorganic substance having a definite chemical composition\r\nand definite physical properties, within limits.” The Missouri minerals\r\nlisted herein include:\r\n\r\n  Quartz\r\n  Mica\r\n  Calcite\r\n  Dolomite\r\n  Sphalerite\r\n  Galena\r\n  Barite\r\n  Marcasite\r\n  Carnotite\r\n  Tyuyamunite\r\n  Pyrite\r\n  Hematite\r\n  Limonite\r\n  Gypsum\r\n  Pyroxene\r\n  Orthoclase feldspar\r\n  Microcline feldspar\r\n  Plagioclase feldspar\r\n  Metatorbernite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GEOLOGIC VALUES\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the emphasis in this pamphlet has been on the recognition of\r\nMissouri rocks and minerals, it is not out of order to consider the\r\nbroad values that they contribute to our civilization. Their use as\r\nbuilding materials has been noted, but it should be further recognized\r\nthat as our timber is being rapidly depleted more and more structures\r\nwill be built out of earth materials. Missouri possesses a wealth of\r\nbeautiful limestone that is serviceable and readily quarried. Where\r\nlimestone is not near, there is usually shale or glacial clay which can\r\nbe used in the manufacture of brick and tile. Permanency will be the\r\nkeynote of the rock and ceramic structures. Gravel and sand are abundant\r\nin Missouri for concrete and other varied uses.\r\n\r\nThe soil is Missouri’s most valuable earth material. Hundreds to\r\nthousands of years of normal weathering are required to develop the\r\nrocks and minerals and texture of the inorganic fraction of the soil. We\r\nshould preserve it and prevent disastrous soil erosion.\r\n\r\nAside from these more tangible values, a fascinating and instructive\r\nhobby can be made of collecting, arranging, and studying rocks and\r\nminerals. One gains a fuller understanding and appreciation of nature\r\nfrom their study. The orderliness, constancy, and interrelation within\r\nthe rock and mineral “world” is a restful contrast to the one which man\r\noften keeps in turmoil. The beauty of a glistening crystal or a polished\r\nmineral or stone is as inspiring as a lovely flower, yet it lasts and\r\nlasts through centuries, a veritable “rock of ages.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Suggested Collateral Reading Material\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Books on Rocks and Minerals\r\n\r\nHow to Know the Minerals and Rocks, by Pearl; publisher, McGraw-Hill\r\n      Book Co., New York.\r\n\r\nA Field Guide to Rocks and Minerals, by Pough; publisher, Houghton,\r\n      Mifflin Co., Boston.\r\n\r\nGemstones and Minerals: How and Where To Find Them, by Sinkankas;\r\n      publisher, Van Nostrand, Princeton, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nLook for paper back editions of these and other books which may be\r\n      widely available.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Fossils\r\n\r\nThe Common Fossils of Missouri, by A.
