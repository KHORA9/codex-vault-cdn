EATON, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn trying to determine the ancestral relationships of modern orders of\r\nAmphibia it is not possible to select satisfactory structural ancestors\r\namong a wealth of fossils, since very few of the known fossils could\r\neven be considered possible, and scarcely any are satisfactory, for such\r\na selection. The nearest approach thus far to a solution of the problem\r\nin this manner has been made with reference to the Anura. Watson's paper\r\n(1940), with certain modifications made necessary by Gregory (1950),\r\nprovides the paleontological evidence so far available on the origin of\r\nfrogs. It shows that several features of the skeleton of frogs, such as\r\nthe enlargement of the interpterygoid spaces and orbits, reduction of\r\nthe more posterior dermal bones of the skull, and downward spread of the\r\nneural arches lateral to the notochord, were already apparent in the\r\nPennsylvanian _Amphibamus_ (Fig. 1), with which Gregory synonymized\r\n_Miobatrachus_ and _Mazonerpeton_. But between the Pennsylvanian and the\r\nTriassic (the age of the earliest known frog, _Protobatrachus_) there\r\nwas a great lapse of time, and that which passed between any conceivable\r\nPaleozoic ancestor of Urodela and the earliest satisfactory\r\nrepresentative of this order (in the Cretaceous) was much longer still.\r\nThe Apoda, so far as known, have no fossil record.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it should be possible, first, to survey those characters of\r\nmodern Amphibia that might afford some comparison with the early\r\nfossils, and second, to discover among the known Paleozoic kinds those\r\nwhich are sufficiently unspecialized to permit derivation of the modern\r\npatterns. Further circumstantial evidence may be obtained by examining\r\nsome features of Recent Amphibia which could not readily be compared\r\nwith anything in the fossils; such are the embryonic development of the\r\nsoft structures, including cartilaginous stages of the skeleton, the\r\ndevelopment and various specializations of the ear mechanism, adaptive\r\ncharacters associated with aquatic and terrestrial life, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF MODERN ORDERS WITH THE\r\nLABYRINTHODONTS AND LEPOSPONDYLS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. _Saurerpeton_ (x 1/2, after Romer, 1930, fig. 6);\r\n_Amphibamus_, the palatal view x 2-1/4, from Watson, 1940, fig. 4 (as\r\n_Miobatrachus_), the dorsal view x 2-1/2, from Gregory's revised figure\r\nof _Amphibamus_ (1950, Fig. 1); _Protobatrachus_, x 1, from Watson,\r\n1940, fig. 18, 19.]\r\n\r\nIn both Anura and Urodela the skull is short, broad, relatively flat,\r\nwith reduced pterygoids that diverge laterally from the parasphenoids\r\nleaving large interpterygoid vacuities, and with large orbits. (These\r\nstatements do not apply to certain larval or perennibranchiate forms.)\r\nThe skull in both orders has lost a number of primitive dermal bones in\r\nthe posterior part; these are: basioccipital, supraoccipital,\r\npostparietal, intertemporal, supratemporal, and tabular. The\r\nexoccipitals form the two condyles but there are no foramina for the\r\n11th and 12th nerves, since these are not separate in modern Amphibia.\r\nThe opisthotic is missing in all except Proteidae (but see discussion\r\nof the ear). Although the skull is normally autostylic, a movable\r\nbasipterygoid articulation is present among Hynobiid salamanders and in\r\nat least the metamorphic stages of primitive frogs, and therefore should\r\nbe expected in their ancestors. The vertebrae are, of course, complete;\r\nsee discussion in later section. The quadratojugal, lost in salamanders,\r\nis retained in frogs, and conversely the lacrimal, absent in frogs,\r\noccurs in a few primitive salamanders. The situation in Apoda is\r\ndifferent, but postfrontal and jugal should be noted as bones retained\r\nin this order while lost in the others.\r\n\r\nThus, in spite of minor differences, the above list shows that there are\r\nnumerous and detailed similarities between Anura and Urodela with\r\nrespect to the features in which they differ from the Paleozoic orders.\r\nPusey (1943) listed 26 characters which _Ascaphus_ shares with\r\nsalamanders but not with more advanced frogs; a few of these might be\r\ncoincidental, but most of them are of some complexity and must be taken\r\nto indicate relationship. The main adaptive specializations of Anura,\r\nhowever, including loss of the adult tail, extreme reduction in number\r\nof vertebrae, formation of urostyle, elongation of the ilium and\r\nlengthening of the hind legs, must have appeared at a later time than\r\nthe separation of that order from any possible common stem with Urodela,\r\nalthough they are only partially developed in the Triassic\r\n_Protobatrachus_.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Paleozoic Amphibia, there are two groups in which some\r\nlikelihood of a relationship with modern order exists. In the\r\nPennsylvanian Trimerorhachoidea (Labyrinthodontia, order Temnospondyli)\r\nsome members, such as _Eugyrinus_, _Saurerpeton_, and notably\r\n_Amphibamus_ (Fig. 1) had short, broad heads, an expansion of palatal\r\nand orbital openings, posterior widening of the parasphenoid associated\r\nwith divergence of the pterygoids, a movable basipterygoid articulation,\r\nand reduction in size (but not loss) of the more posterior dermal bones\r\nof the skull. In recognition of Watson's (1940) evidence that these\r\nanimals make quite suitable structural ancestors of frogs, Romer (1945)\r\nplaced _Amphibamus_ in an order, Eoanura, but Gregory (1950) indicated\r\nthat it might better be left with the temnospondyls. Association of the\r\nurodele stem with this group does not seem to have been proposed\r\nhitherto.\r\n\r\nThe other group of Paleozoic Amphibia that has been considered probably\r\nancestral to any modern type is the subclass Lepospondyli, containing\r\nthree orders, Aistopoda, Nectridia and Microsauria. In these the\r\nvertebrae are complete (holospondylous), the centra presumably formed by\r\ncylindrical ossification around the notochord, and there is no evidence\r\nas to the contributions from embryonic cartilage units. It is important\r\nto note at this point that precisely the same statement can be made\r\nregarding the vertebrae of _adults_ of all three Recent orders, yet for\r\nall of them, as shown in a later section, we have ample evidence of the\r\npart played by cartilage elements in vertebral development. Therefore\r\n(a) we cannot say that there were no such elements in embryonic stages\r\nof lepospondyls, and (b) it would take more than the evidence from adult\r\nvertebrae to relate a particular modern order (for example, Urodela) to\r\nthe Lepospondyli. Vague similarities to Urodela have been noted by many\r\nauthors in the Nectridia, Aistopoda and Microsauria, but these are not\r\ndetailed and refer mainly to the vertebrae. The skulls do not show,\r\neither dorsally or in the palate, any striking resemblance to those of\r\ngeneralized salamanders, and certainly most known lepospondyls are too\r\nspecialized to serve as the source of Urodela. It is true that the\r\nelongate bodies, small limbs, and apparent aquatic habitus of some\r\nlepospondyls accord well with our usual picture of a salamander, but\r\nsuch a form and way of life have appeared in many early Amphibia,\r\nincluding the labyrinthodonts. The family Lysorophidae (Fig. 2), usually\r\nplaced among microsaurs, is sufficiently close in skull structure to the\r\nApoda to be a possible ancestor of these, but it probably has nothing to\r\ndo with Urodela, by reason of the numerous morphological specializations\r\nthat were associated with its snakelike habitus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. _Lysorophus tricarinatus_, lateral and posterior\r\nviews x 2-1/2, modified after Sollas, 1920, Figs. 8 and 12,\r\nrespectively; palatal view after Broom, 1918, x 1-1/2. For explanation\r\nof abbreviations see Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nMcDowell's (1958) suggestion that it would be profitable to look among\r\nthe Seymouriamorpha for the ancestors of frogs seems to be based upon a\r\nfew details of apparent resemblance rather than a comprehensive view of\r\nthe major characters of the animals. In most points which he mentions\r\n(limb girdles, form of ear, pterygoid articulation) the present writer\r\ndoes not see a closer similarity of frogs to Seymouriamorpha than to\r\nTemnospondyli.\r\n\r\nStill other opinions have been expressed. Herre (1935), for instance,\r\nconcludes \"on anatomical, biological and paleontological grounds\" that\r\nthe orders of Urodela, Anura, Apoda and Stegocephali were all\r\nindependently evolved from fish, but beyond citing the opinions of a\r\nnumber of other authors he does not present tangible evidence for this\r\nextreme polyphyletic interpretation.\r\n\r\nMore notable are the views of several Scandinavian workers\r\n(Saeve-Soederbergh, 1934; Jarvik, 1942; Holmgren, 1933, 1939, 1949a, b),\r\nof whom Jarvik, in a thorough analysis of the ethmoid region, would\r\nderive the Urodela from Porolepid Crossopterygii, and all other\r\ntetrapods from the Rhipidistia; Saeve-Soederbergh and Holmgren, the latter\r\nusing the structure of carpus and tarsus, see a relationship of Urodela\r\nto Dipnoi, but accept the derivation of labyrinthodonts and other\r\ntetrapods from Rhipidistia. All of this work is most detailed and\r\nlaborious, and has produced a great quantity of data useful to\r\nmorphologists, but the diphyletic theory is not widely adopted; the\r\nevidence adduced for it seems to consist largely of minutiae which,\r\ntaken by themselves, are inconclusive, or lend themselves to other\r\ninterpretation. For instance Holmgren's numerous figures of embryonic\r\nlimbs of salamanders show patterns of cartilage elements that he would\r\ntrace to the Dipnoan type of fin, yet it is difficult to see that the\r\nweight of evidence requires this, when the pattern does not differ in\r\nany fundamental manner from those seen in other embryonic tetrapods, and\r\nthe differences that do appear may well be taken to have ontogenetic\r\nrather than phylogenetic meaning. Further, the Dipnoan specialization of\r\ndental plates and autostylic jaw suspension, already accomplished early\r\nin the Devonian, would seem to exclude Dipnoi from possible ancestry of\r\nthe Urodela, an order unknown prior to the Mesozoic, in which the teeth\r\nare essentially similar to those of late Paleozoic Amphibia, and the jaw\r\nsuspension is not yet in all members autostylic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EAR\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.

In this position the\r\ntympanum could receive airborne sounds whether the animal were entirely\r\non land or lying nearly submerged with only the upper part of its head\r\nexposed. Among those Anura in which the ear is not reduced the same is\r\ntrue, except that the tabular is lost. In Temnospondyli (Fig. 3) the\r\nposterior wall of the otic capsule was usually formed by the opisthotic,\r\nwhich extended up and outward as a buttress from the exoccipital to the\r\ntabular, and sometimes showed a paroccipital process for the insertion,\r\npresumably, of a slip or tendon of the anterior axial musculature. The\r\nstapes, in addition to its foot in the fenestra ovalis and its tympanic\r\nor extrastapedial process to the tympanum, bore a dorsal process (or\r\nligament) to the tabular, an \"internal\" process (or ligament) to the\r\nquadrate or an adjacent part of the squamosal, and a ligament to the\r\nceratohyal. Some of these attachments might be reduced or absent in\r\nspecial cases, but they seem to have been the ones originally present\r\nboth phylogenetically and embryonically in Amphibia.\r\n\r\nAmong typical frogs (Fig. 4) the base, or otostapes, is present and\r\nbony, the extrastapedial process (extracolumella, or hyostapes) is\r\nusually cartilaginous, the dorsal process (processus paroticus) is of\r\ncartilage or ligament, but the other two attachments are absent in the\r\nadult. The exoccipital extends laterally, occupying the posterior face\r\nof the otic capsule. Between it and the otostapes is a small disc,\r\nusually ossified, the operculum, which normally fits loosely in a\r\nportion of the fenestral membrane, and is developed from the otic\r\ncapsule. The opercularis muscle extends from this disc to the\r\nsuprascapula, in many but by no means all families of Anura.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Diagram of middle ear structures in _Rana_ (upper\r\nfigure, after Stadtmueller, 1936, and lower left after DeBeer, 1937), and\r\n_Ambystoma_ (lower right, after DeBeer, 1937); all x 4. For explanation\r\nof abbreviations see Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nAmong Urodela (Fig. 4) the middle ear cavity and tympanum are lacking,\r\nand the stapes (columella) consists of no more than its footplate and\r\nthe stylus, which is attached to the border of the squamosal, thus\r\ncorresponding to the \"internal\" process. In families in which\r\nindividuals metamorphose and become terrestrial (Hynobiidae,\r\nAmbystomidae, Salamandridae, Plethodontidae), an operculum and\r\nopercularis muscle appear in the adult, just as in frogs, except that in\r\nPlethodontidae, the most progressive family, the operculum fuses with\r\nthe footplate of the stapes. Among neotenous or perennibranchiate\r\nurodeles there is no separate operculum or opercularis. The evidence\r\ngiven by Reed (1915) for fusion of the operculum with the columella in\r\n_Necturus_ appears inconclusive, in spite of the great care with which\r\nhis observations were made. On the other hand, _Necturus_ and _Proteus_\r\nalone among living salamanders have a distinct opisthotic on the\r\nposterior wall of the otic capsule (Fig. 3), as do the Cretaceous\r\n_Hylaeobatrachus_ and the Eocene _Palaeoproteus_. Probably these\r\nProteidae should be regarded as primitive in this respect, although many\r\nother features may be attributed to neoteny.\r\n\r\nThere is a contrast between Anura and most Urodela in the relative\r\npositions of the stapes and facial nerve, as shown in DeBeer's (1937)\r\ndiagrams. In the latter (_Ambystoma_) the nerve is beneath, and in the\r\nformer (_Rana_) above, the stapes. Judging by figures of _Neoceratodus_,\r\n_Hypogeophis_, and several types of reptiles and mammals, the Urodela\r\nare exceptional. _Necturus_, however, has the nerve passing above its\r\nstapes, and this may be primitive in the same sense as the persistent\r\nopisthotic. There can be, of course, no question of the nerve having\r\nworked its way through or over the obstructing stapes in order to come\r\nbelow it in salamanders; rather, the peripheral growth of neuron fibers\r\nin the embryo must simply pursue a slightly different course among the\r\npartially differentiated mesenchyme in the two contrasting patterns.\r\n\r\nAlthough DeBeer (1937) shows in his figure of _Hypogeophis_ (one of the\r\nApoda) an operculum, this is apparently a mistake. The stapes has a\r\nlarge footplate, and its stylus articulates with the quadrate, but no\r\ntrue operculum or opercularis has been described in the Apoda. The\r\nfacial nerve passes above the stapes. It does not seem necessary to\r\nregard the conditions in this order as related directly to those of\r\neither salamanders or frogs, but a reduction of the stapes comparable to\r\nthat in salamanders has occurred.\r\n\r\nThe presence in both frogs and terrestrial salamanders of a special\r\nmechanism involving the opercularis muscle and an operculum cut out in\r\nidentical fashion from the wall of the otic capsule behind the stapes\r\nseems to require some other explanation than that of a chance\r\nconvergence or parallelism. Although the stapes and otic region are\r\nreadily visible in a number of labyrinthodonts and lepospondyls, no\r\nindication of an operculum seems to be reported among them. But in the\r\nTriassic _Protobatrachus_ (Fig. 1), which is unmistakably a frog in its\r\nskull, pelvis and some other features, Piveteau (1937) has shown,\r\nimmediately behind the foot of the stapes, a small bony tubercle, which\r\nhe and Watson (1940) designated opisthotic. Very clearly it served for\r\ninsertion of a muscle, and it is equally clear that the bone is a\r\nreduced opisthotic, carrying the paroccipital process already mentioned\r\nas characteristic of it in some temnospondyls. Since the remainder of\r\nthe posterior wall of the otic capsule consists of cartilage, meeting\r\nthe exoccipital, it may be that the opisthotic becomes the operculum in\r\nfrogs. _Protobatrachus_ was too far specialized in the Anuran direction,\r\nalthough it still had a tail, and the forelegs and hind legs were nearly\r\nthe same size, to be considered a possible ancestor of the Urodeles. But\r\nat one stage in the general reduction of the skull in the ancestry of\r\nboth groups, a condition similar to that in _Protobatrachus_ may have\r\ncharacterized the otic region, long before the Triassic.\r\n\r\nIn the argument thus far we have considered terrestrial, adult\r\namphibians, since it is only in these that either the normal middle ear\r\nand tympanum, or the opercular apparatus, is present. But among the\r\nurodeles several neotenic types occur (this term applies also to the\r\nperennibranchs). For most of these there is nothing about the otic\r\nregion that would be inconsistent with derivation, by neoteny, from\r\nknown families in which adults are terrestrial; for example,\r\n_Cryptobranchus_ could have had a Hynobiid-like ancestor. But this, as\r\nmentioned above, does not hold for the Proteidae, which possess an\r\nopisthotic of relatively large size, distinctly separate from the\r\nexoccipital and prootic. Either this bone is a neomorph, which seems\r\nimprobable, or there has not been in the ancestry of this particular\r\nfamily an episode of reduction comparable to that seen in the\r\nterrestrial families, where there is an operculum instead of a normal\r\nopisthotic. Therefore the Proteidae probably are not derived from the\r\ngeneral stem of other salamanders, but diverged sufficiently long ago\r\nthat the bones of the otic region were reduced on a different pattern.\r\nThey need not be removed from the order, but, in this respect,\r\nrecognized as more primitive than any other existing Urodela or Anura. A\r\nrecent paper by Hecht (1957) discusses many features of _Necturus_ and\r\n_Proteus_, and shows that they are remote from each other; his evidence\r\ndoes not seem to prove, however, that they were of independent origin or\r\nthat they need be placed in separate families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVERTEBRAE AND RIBS\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the vertebrae and ribs of Recent Amphibia has been\r\nstudied by Gamble (1922), Naef (1929), Mookerjee (1930 a, b), Gray\r\n(1930) and Emelianov (1936), among others. MacBride (1932) and Remane\r\n(1938) provide good summaries. In this section reference will be made to\r\nthe embryonic vertebral cartilages by the names used for them in these\r\nstudies, although the concept of \"arcualia\" is currently considered of\r\nlittle value in comparative anatomy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Development of Anuran vertebrae. Upper left, late\r\ntadpole of _Xenopus laevis_; lower left, same just after metamorphosis;\r\nupper right, diagram of general components of primitive Anuran vertebra.\r\n(After MacBride, 1932, Figs. 35, 38, 47D, respectively.)

All x 20 approx.\r\nFor explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe centrum in Anura (Fig. 5) is formed in the perichordal sheath\r\n(_Rana_, _Bufo_) or only in the dorsal portion thereof (_Bombinator_,\r\n_Xenopus_). The neural arch develops from the basidorsal cartilages that\r\nrest upon, and at first are entirely distinct from, the perichordal\r\nsheath. Ribs, present as separate cartilages associated with the 2nd,\r\n3rd and 4th vertebrae in the larvae of _Xenopus_ and _Bombinator_, fuse\r\nwith lateral processes (diapophyses) of the neural arches at\r\nmetamorphosis, but in _Leiopelma_ and _Ascaphus_ the ribs remain freely\r\narticulated in the adult. Basiventral arcualia have been supposed to be\r\nrepresented by the hypochord, a median rod of cartilage beneath the\r\nshrinking notochord in the postsacral region, which at metamorphosis\r\nossifies to produce the bulk of the urostyle. Fig. 5, lower right, a\r\ntransverse section taken immediately posterior to the sacral ribs in a\r\ntransforming specimen of _Ascaphus_, shows that the \"hypochord\" is a\r\nmass of cartilage formed in the perichordal sheath itself, and very\r\nobviously is derived from the ventral part of postsacral perichordal\r\ncentra; there are, then, no basiventral arcualia, and the discrete\r\nhypochord shown in MacBride's diagram (Fig. 5, upper right) of a frog\r\nvertebra does not actually occur below the centrum, but only below the\r\nnotochord in the postsacral region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.

For explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nIn Urodela (Fig. 6) the pattern of vertebral and rib development is more\r\ncomplex, and there has been much controversy over its interpretation.\r\nNeural arches and perichordal centra form in the same manner as in\r\nfrogs, but with the addition in certain cases (_Triton_) of a median\r\nsupradorsal cartilage, which gives rise to the zygapophyses of each\r\nneural arch. Difficulty comes, however, in understanding the\r\nrelationship of the ribs to the vertebrae. Each rib, usually\r\ntwo-headed, articulates with a \"transverse process\" that in its early\r\ndevelopment seems to be separate from both the vertebra and the rib, and\r\nis therefore known, noncommittally, as \"rib-bearer.\" This lies laterally\r\nfrom the centrum, neural arch, and vertebral artery; upon fusing with\r\nthe vertebra it therefore encloses the artery in a foramen separate from\r\nthe one between the capitulum and tuberculum of the rib (the usual\r\nlocation of the vertebral artery). At least four different\r\ninterpretations of these structures have been suggested:\r\n\r\n(1) Naef (1929) considered the rib-bearer a derivative of the\r\nbasiventral, which, by spreading laterally and dorsally to meet the\r\nneural arch, enclosed the vertebral artery. He then supposed that by\r\nreduction of the rib-bearer in other tetrapods (frogs and amniotes) the\r\nvertebrarterial foramen and costal foramen were brought together in a\r\nsingle foramen transversarium. The implication is that the Urodele\r\ncondition is primitive, but it cannot now be supposed that Urodela are\r\nancestral to any other group, and the rib-bearer is most probably a\r\nspecialization limited to salamanders. This does not, of course,\r\ninvalidate the first part of his interpretation.\r\n\r\n(2) Remane (1938), noting that rib insertions of early Amphibia are\r\nessentially as in Amniota, argued that the rib-bearer is not from the\r\nbasiventral but is a neomorph which originates directly from the neural\r\narch and grows ventrally. This he inferred mainly from Gamble's (1922)\r\nobservation on _Necturus_, but his assumption that _Necturus_ is more\r\nprimitive than other salamanders (such as the Salamandridae), where the\r\npattern differs from this, is not necessarily correct. Rather, the\r\nperennibranchs are distinguished mainly by their neotenous features, and\r\ntheir development is likely to show simplifications which are not\r\nnecessarily primitive. The suggestion of a \"neomorph\" ought not to be\r\nmade except as a last resort, for it is simply an acknowledgment that\r\nthe author does not recognize homology with any structure already known;\r\nsometimes further information will make such recognition possible.\r\n\r\n(3) Gray (1930), using _Molge taeniatus_, concluded that the normal\r\ncapitulum of the rib was lost, but that the tuberculum bifurcated to\r\nmake the two heads seen in Urodela, thus accounting for the failure of\r\nthe costal foramen to coincide with that of the vertebral artery. This\r\nanswer, too, seems to entail an unprovable assumption which should not\r\nbe made without explicit evidence.\r\n\r\n(4) Finally, Emelianov (1936) regarded the rib-bearer as a rudimentary\r\n_ventral_ rib, on account of its relationship to the vertebral artery,\r\nand considered the actual rib to be a neomorph in the _dorsal_ position\r\ncharacteristic of tetrapod ribs in general. This argument would fit the\r\nontogenetic picture satisfactorily, provided that (_a_) there were some\r\nevidence of ventral, rather than dorsal, ribs in early Amphibia, and\r\n(_b_) we accept the invention of another neomorph in modern Amphibia as\r\nan unavoidable necessity. Emelianov's conclusion (p. 258) should be\r\nquoted here (translation): \"The ribs of Urodela are shown to be upper\r\nribs, yet we find besides these in Urodela rudimentary lower ribs fused\r\nwith the vertebral column. The ribs of Apoda are lower ribs. In Anura\r\nribs fail to develop fully, but as rare exceptions rudiments of upper\r\nribs appear.\"\r\n\r\nOf these various interpretations, that of Naef seems to involve the\r\nminimum of novelty, namely, that the rib-bearer is the basiventral,\r\nexpanded and external to the vertebral artery. It is not necessary to\r\ntake this modification as the ancestral condition in tetrapods, of\r\ncourse. The basiventral (=intercentrum) would merely have expanded\r\nsufficiently to provide a diapophysis for the tuberculum as well as the\r\n(primitive) facet for the capitulum. No neomorph appears under this\r\nhypothesis, which has the distinct advantage of simplicity.\r\n\r\nFigures of early stages in vertebral development by the authors\r\nmentioned show that the basidorsals chondrify first, as neural arches,\r\nwhile a separate mass of mesenchyme lies externally and ventrally from\r\nthese. This mesenchyme may chondrify either in one piece (on each side)\r\nor in two; in _Molge_ the part adjacent to the centrum is ossified in\r\nthe 20-mm. larva, and subsequently unites with the more dorsal and\r\nlateral cartilaginous part, while the rib, appearing farther out, grows\r\ninward to meet this composite \"rib-bearer.\" In _Necturus_ the mesenchyme\r\nbelow the neural arch differentiates into a cartilage below the\r\nvertebral artery (position proper to a basiventral), a bridge between\r\nthis and the neural arch, and a rib, the latter two chondrifying later\r\nthan the \"basiventral\" proper. In the \"axolotl\" (presumably _Ambystoma\r\ntigrinum_) the rib-bearer grows downward from its first center of\r\nchondrification at the side of the neural arch (Emelianov, 1936).\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the simplest hypothesis to account for the\r\nrib-bearer is that (_a_) it is the basiventral, (_b_) it is recognizable\r\njust before chondrification as a mass of mesenchyme in contact with both\r\nthe notochordal sheath and the basidorsal cartilage, (_c_) it may\r\nchondrify or ossify first in its ventral portion or in its dorsal\r\nportion, the two then joining before it fuses with the rest of the\r\nvertebra, (_d_) the enclosure of the vertebral artery is a consequence\r\nof the extension of the basiventral beyond the position occupied by it\r\nin primitive Amphibia, and (_e_) there is no indication that this took\r\nplace in other orders than the Urodela.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the vertebrae in Urodela have at least the following\r\ncomponents: perichordal centra, separate basidorsal cartilages, and\r\nbasiventrals, which are somewhat specialized in their manner of\r\ndevelopment. The vertebrae of Anura develop in the fashion just\r\ndescribed except that basiventrals are lacking. It would seem no more\r\ndifficult to accept the derivation of salamander vertebrae from the\r\ntemnospondylous type than it is in the case of frogs, if other evidence\r\npoints to such an ancestry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Vertebrae of _Eusthenopteron_ (x1) and\r\n_Ichthyostega_ (x2/3, after Jarvik, 1952), _Trimerorhachis_ (x1-1/2,\r\nafter Case), and _Amphibamus_ (x10, after Watson, 1940) in lateral and\r\nend views; the two lower right-hand figures are from Watson (1940, as\r\n_Miobatrachus_); the lower left is from a cast of the \"_Miobatrachus_\"\r\nspecimen in Chicago Natural History Museum, No. 2000, in the presacral\r\nregion (original, x10).]\r\n\r\nFig. 7, lower right, is Watson's (1940) illustration of the anterior\r\ntrunk vertebrae of _Amphibamus_ (_Miobatrachus_), in which the\r\nintercentrum is shown as a single median piece. Fig. 7, lower left,\r\nshows two of the more posterior trunk vertebrae seen as impressions in a\r\ncast of the type of \"_Miobatrachus romeri_;\" evidently the inter-centra\r\nwere paired at about the level of the 16th vertebra, and relatively\r\nlarge. Gregory's (1950) figure of the type specimen of \"_Mazonerpeton_\"\r\n(also equivalent to _Amphibamus_) shows the anterior trunk vertebrae in\r\nrelation to the ribs essentially as they appear to me in the cast of\r\n_Miobatrachus_, and rather differently from Watson's figure of the\r\nlatter. Gregory is probably right in considering the specimens to\r\nrepresent various degrees of immaturity. So far as present information\r\ngoes, then, the vertebrae of salamanders and frogs show no _clear_\r\nevidence of derivation from those of any particular group among the\r\nearly Amphibia, but their features are not inconsistent with a\r\nsimplification of the pattern of Temnospondyli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Pectoral girdles of _Protobatrachus_ (after\r\nPiveteau, 1937), _Notobatrachus_ (after Stipanicic and Reig, 1956),\r\nAscaphus (after Ritland, 1955 a) and _Rana_ (original); all x2. For\r\nexplanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPECTORAL GIRDLE\r\n\r\n\r\nHecht and Ruibal (Copeia, 1928:242) make a strong point of the nature of\r\nthe pectoral girdle in _Notobatrachus_, as described recently by\r\nStipanicic and Reig (1955, 1956) from the Jurassic of Patagonia, and\r\nquite rightly recommend that the significance of the arciferal and\r\nfirmisternal types of girdle be restudied. That of _Notobatrachus_ is\r\nsaid to be firmisternal; in view of the arciferal condition in the\r\nsupposedly primitive _Leiopelma_, _Ascaphus_, _Bombinator_, etc., this\r\ncomes as a surprise. Is the firmisternal girdle, as seen in _Rana_,\r\n_Bufo_, and others, actually the ancestral type, and has the arciferal\r\nbeen derived from something like this?\r\n\r\nIn the figures given by Stipanicic and Reig the ossified parts of the\r\ngirdle are figured in detail (Fig. 8) and Reig's discussion of it is\r\nthorough. The decision to call it firmisternal was taken with some\r\nhesitancy, for no median elements are indicated, and the position and\r\nshape of those seen is closely similar to the ossified parts in\r\n_Ascaphus_ and _Leiopelma_; there is no bony sternum or omosternum. It\r\nis safe to suppose that some cartilage lay in the midline between the\r\nclavicles and coracoids, but there is no evidence as to its extent,\r\nrigidity, or degree of overlapping if any. Apparently, then, there is\r\nnot sufficient reason to infer that this Jurassic frog had a pectoral\r\ngirdle comparable with the modern firmisternal type.\r\n\r\nPiveteau (1955:261) remarks that the only living Anuran that can be\r\ncompared usefully with _Protobatrachus_ (Triassic) with regard to its\r\npectoral girdle is _Ascaphus_. Again, the extent of cartilage in\r\n_Protobatrachus_ (Fig. 8) can only be inferred, and there are no median\r\nelements. The agreement with _Ascaphus_ includes the presence, in both,\r\nof a separate coracoid ossification situated posterior to the ossified\r\n\"scapulocoracoid\" (actually scapula). This ossification is evidently\r\nthat shown in _Notobatrachus_ as \"coracoid.\" Direct comparison of the\r\nthree genera with one another suggests that if we use the term arciferal\r\nfor any, we should use it for all.\r\n\r\nIn the remote predecessor of Anura, _Amphibamus_ of the Pennsylvanian,\r\nthe pectoral girdle was less substantial than in many of its\r\ncontemporaries, but it contained the primitive median interclavicle in\r\naddition to the clavicle, cleithrum, and scapulocoracoid. (The figure of\r\nWatson, 1940, and that by Gregory, 1950, are of individuals of different\r\nages, the latter being older.) It is clear that the paired elements of\r\nsuch a girdle were held rigid by their attachment to the interclavicle,\r\n_via_ the clavicles. Subsequent elimination of the interclavicle in the\r\nAnuran line of descent, and decrease of ossification, left a girdle like\r\nthat of _Protobatrachus_, _Notobatrachus_, _Ascaphus_ and _Leiopelma_.\r\nBut in several advanced families a more rigid median \"sternum,\" of one\r\nor two bony pieces plus cartilage, is developed secondarily, possibly\r\n(as Cope, 1889: 247, suggested) in correlation with axillary amplexus.\r\n\r\nAmong Urodela no dermal bones occur in the pectoral girdle. There is\r\nusually a scapulocoracoid ossified as a single piece, from which a thin\r\ncartilaginous suprascapula extends dorsally and a broad cartilaginous\r\ncoracoid plate extends medially, overlapping the one from the opposite\r\nside; a precoracoid lobe of this reaches forward on either side, and a\r\nmedian, posterior \"sternum\" of cartilage may make contact with the\r\nedges of the two coracoids. In _Siren_ and _Amphiuma_ two centers of\r\nossification are found for each scapulocoracoid, and in _Triton_ and\r\n_Salamandra_ three. Probably the more dorsal and lateral of these\r\nrepresents the primitive scapula and the other one (or two) the\r\nprimitive coracoid.\r\n\r\nComparing the girdle of a salamander with that of a frog, the closest\r\nsimilarity can be seen between _Ascaphus_ and a salamander in which the\r\nscapula and coracoid ossify separately. Both have the median \"sternum\"\r\nin contact with the coracoid plates. The major difference, of course, is\r\nthe lack of clavicle and cleithrum in the salamander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARPUS AND TARSUS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn _Ascaphus_ (Ritland, 1955a; cleared and stained specimens of nearly\r\ngrown males) distal carpals 1, 2, 3 and 4 are present and separate,\r\nincreasing in size in the order given (Fig. 9). A prepollex rests\r\nagainst centrale 1; centralia 2 and 3 are fused; the radiale fuses with\r\ncentrale 4, and the intermedium fuses with the ulnare; radius and ulna\r\nare fused with each other as in other frogs. The digits (and\r\nmetacarpals) are considered by Ritland to be 1-4, in addition to the\r\nprepollex, rather than 2-5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Skeleton of fore foot of _Notobatrachus_ (after\r\nStipanicic and Reig, 1956, terminology revised) and _Ascaphus_ (after\r\nRitland, 1955 a); all x5. For explanation of abbreviations see Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nIn the Jurassic _Notobatrachus_ Stipanicic and Reig (1956) have shown\r\nthe carpus with surprising clarity (Fig. 9). If their nomenclature of\r\nthe parts be revised, we obtain a fairly close resemblance to\r\n_Ascaphus_, except that centralia 2 and 3 are not fused, distal carpals\r\n1 and 2 do not show (which would easily be understood if they were of\r\nthe size of those in _Ascaphus_, or not ossified), and the intermedium\r\nremains separate from the ulnare.\r\n\r\nIn _Salamandra_ (Francis, 1934; Nauck, 1938) distal carpals 1 and 2 are\r\nfused in both larva and adult, and 3 and 4 are separate; the radiale,\r\nintermedium and ulnare are separate in the larva but the latter two fuse\r\nin the adult; centrale 1 (labelled prepollical cartilage by Francis) and\r\ncentrale 2 are separate. Francis considers the digits (and metacarpals)\r\nto be 1-4. Apparently the arrangement here indicated for the larva is\r\ncharacteristic of other larval salamanders, except where further\r\nreduced, and reduction below the number given for the adult is common in\r\nother terrestrial forms. The radius and ulna are, of course, separate.\r\n\r\nThe ossification of carpals is more likely to be complete in adult frogs\r\nthan in salamanders, but some ossification of all parts named is found\r\nin several of the latter. A common ancestor of frogs and salamanders\r\ncould be expected to have the following elements present and ossified in\r\nthe adult: distal carpals 1-4 separate; 3 centralia; radiale,\r\nintermedium and ulnare separate. Comparison with fossils older than\r\n_Notobatrachus_ is fruitless on these points, unless we go back to forms\r\ntoo distant to have any special value, such as _Eryops_. This is because\r\nof inadequate preservation and because the elements are not fully\r\nossified in many immature specimens.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this review there is no special value in a comparison\r\nof the tarsi of frogs and salamanders, since the leaping adaptation of\r\nthe former leaves very little common pattern between them. Even in\r\n_Protobatrachus_, where the legs were not yet conspicuously lengthened,\r\nthe tibiale and fibulare (\"astragalus\" and \"calcaneum\" respectively)\r\nwere already considerably elongated. The carpus and tarsus of\r\n_Amphibamus_ are as yet undecipherable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LARVA\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the postembryonic developmental stages of modern Amphibia,\r\nthere can be no doubt that a gill-bearing, four-legged larva of a\r\nsalamander, in which lateral line pores and a gular fold are present,\r\nrepresents much more closely the type of larva found in labyrinthodonts\r\nthan does the limbless, plant-nibbling tadpole of the Anura.\r\nSalamander-like larvae of labyrinthodonts are well known, especially\r\nthose formerly supposed to comprise the order Branchiosauria. Many,\r\nperhaps the majority of, labyrinthodonts show some features associated\r\nwith aquatic life even when full-grown, as do the lepospondyls. These\r\nfeatures may include impressions of sensory canals on the dermal bones\r\nof the skull, persistence of visceral arches, reduction in size of\r\nappendages, and failure of tarsal and carpal elements to ossify. In\r\nfact, it appears that very few of the Paleozoic Amphibia were successful\r\nin establishing themselves as terrestrial animals even as adults.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the ancestry of Anura, and that of at least the\r\nHynobiid, Ambystomid, Salamandrid and Plethodontid salamanders, there\r\nmust certainly have been a terrestrial adult, transforming from an\r\naquatic larva. The leaping mechanism of Anura, shown in so many features\r\nof their anatomy, is perhaps to be explained as a device for sudden\r\nescape from land into the water, but it was not yet perfected in the\r\nTriassic _Protobatrachus_ or the Jurassic _Notobatrachus_.\r\n\r\nThe middle ear, its sound-transmitting mechanism, and the tympanum, well\r\ndeveloped in most Anura, are readily derived from those of early\r\nlabyrinthodonts, and are presumably effective for hearing airborne\r\nsounds whether on land or while floating in the water. Reduction of\r\nthese organs in Urodela may be correlated with their customary\r\nrestriction to subsurface habitats and inability to maintain a floating\r\nposition while in water.\r\n\r\nSome light may be shed on the significance of the tadpole of Anura by\r\nconsidering the early stages of the ribbed frogs, Liopelmidae.\r\n_Leiopelma_ and _Ascaphus_ are so closely similar in the adult that\r\nthere is no doubt that they belong in one family, primitive in some\r\nrespects (including articulated ribs; pyriformis and\r\ncaudalipuboischiotibialis muscles) but not in others (absence of\r\ntympanum and middle ear). In both genera the eggs are large, 5 mm. in\r\n_Leiopelma_, 4.5 mm. in _Ascaphus_, and unpigmented; but at this point\r\nthe resemblance ends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. _Leiopelma hochstetteri_ larva, lateral and\r\nventral (after Stephenson, 1955), x4.]\r\n\r\nStephenson (1955) showed that embryos of _L. hochstetteri_ develop\r\nequally well on land (in damp places) or in the water, and that embryos\r\nprematurely released from egg capsules develop successfully in the\r\nwater. The larvae possess both pairs of legs (Fig. 10) and a broad gular\r\nfold similar to that of larval salamanders. In _L. hochstetteri_ the\r\nfold grows back over the forelegs temporarily, but remains free from the\r\nbody and presently the legs reappear, whereas in _L. archeyi_ the\r\nforelegs are not covered at any time. No branchial chamber or spiracle\r\nis formed. Of course direct development, without a tadpole, occurs in\r\nseveral other groups of Anura, but in each case terrestrial adaptations\r\nare obvious. This is not true of _Leiopelma_, which Stephenson regards\r\nas more nearly comparable with Urodela in its development than with\r\nother Anura, and he sees in it a \"primary and amphibious\" mode instead\r\nof a terrestrial specialization.\r\n\r\nThe _Ascaphus_ tadpole bears no outward resemblance to the larva of\r\n_Leiopelma_, but is a normal tadpole in form, although sluggish in\r\nactivity. Its greatly expanded labial folds bear numerous rows of horny\r\nepidermal \"teeth,\" which, with the lips, serve to anchor the tadpole to\r\nstones in the swift water of mountain brooks. Noble (1927) noticed that\r\nparticles of food were taken in through the external nares, and that a\r\ncurrent of water passed through these openings and out by way of the\r\nmedian spiracle. It appears that any action by the teeth and jaws in\r\nscraping algae from the rocks (which were bare in the stream where I\r\nhave collected _Ascaphus_) would be quite incidental, and that the lips\r\nand teeth must be primarily a clinging mechanism. Certain other mountain\r\nbrook tadpoles (for example, _Borborocoetes_) show similar devices, but\r\nthese are developed independently, as specializations from the usual\r\nsort of tadpole.\r\n\r\nMay it not be that closure of the gill-chamber by the opercular (=gular)\r\nfold, retardation of limb development, expansion of the lips, growth of\r\nparallel rows of horny teeth, and other correlated features that make a\r\ntadpole, were brought about as an adaptation of the primitive Anuran\r\nlarva to a swift-stream habitat, and that this \"basic patent\" then later\r\nserved to admit the tadpoles of descendant types to an alga-scraping\r\nhabit in quiet water as well? The tadpole, as a unique larval type among\r\nvertebrates, bears the hallmarks of an abrupt adaptive shift, such as\r\nmight have occurred within the limits of a single family, and it seems\r\ndifficult to imagine the enclosed branchial chamber, the tooth-rows, and\r\nlips of a familiar tadpole as having evolved without some kind of\r\nsuctorial function along the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Anura probably originated among temnospondylous labyrinthodonts,\r\nthrough a line represented approximately by _Eugyrinus_, _Amphibamus_,\r\nand the Triassic frog _Protobatrachus_, as shown by Watson, Piveteau and\r\nothers. The known Paleozoic lepospondyls do not show clear indications\r\nof a relationship with Urodela, but _Lysorophus_ may well be on the\r\nancestral stem of the Apoda.\r\n\r\nBetween Urodela and Anura there are numerous resemblances which seem to\r\nindicate direct relationship through a common stock: (1) a similar\r\nreduction of dermal bones of the skull and expansion of palatal\r\nvacuities; (2) movable basipterygoid articulation in primitive members\r\nof both orders; (3) an operculum formed in the otic capsule, with\r\nopercularis muscle; (4) many details of cranial development, cranial\r\nmuscles, and thigh muscles, especially between _Ascaphus_ and the\r\nUrodela, as shown by Pusey and Noble; (5) essentially similar manner of\r\nvertebral development, quite consistent with derivation of both orders\r\nfrom Temnospondyli; (6) presence in the larva of _Leiopelma_ of a\r\nsalamander-like gular fold, four limbs, and no suggestion of\r\nmodification from a tadpole (Stephenson).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE CITED\r\n\r\n\r\nBroom, R.\r\n\r\n   1918.
