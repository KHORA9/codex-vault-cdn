Kingston.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nROB NIXON, BY W.H.G. KINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nPicture a wide, gently undulating expanse of land covered with tall\r\ngrass, over which, as it bends to the breeze, a gleam of light ever and\r\nanon flashes brightly.  It is a rolling prairie in North America, midway\r\nbetween the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  On either hand the earth and\r\nsky seem to unite, without an object to break the line of the horizon,\r\nexcept in the far distance, where some tall trees, by a river's side,\r\nshoot up out of the plain, but appear no higher than a garden hedge-row.\r\nIt is truly a wilderness, which no wise man would attempt to traverse\r\nwithout a guide.\r\n\r\nThat man has wandered there, the remnants of mortality which lie\r\nscattered about--a skull and the bare ribs seen as the wind blows the\r\ngrass aside,--afford melancholy evidence.  A nearer inspection shows a\r\nrifle, now covered with rust, a powder-flask, a sheath-knife, a flint\r\nand steel, and a few other metal articles of hunter's gear.  Those of\r\nmore destructible materials have disappeared before the ravenous jaws of\r\nthe hosts of locusts which have swept over the plain.  Few portions of\r\nthe earth's surface give a more complete idea of boundless extent than\r\nthe American prairie.  Not a sound is heard.  The silence itself is\r\nawe-inspiring.  The snows of winter have lain thickly on that plain,\r\nstorms have swept over it, the rain has fallen, the lightning flashed,\r\nthe thunder roared, since it has been trodden by the foot of man.\r\nPerhaps the last human being who has attempted to cross it was he whose\r\nbones lie blanching in the summer sun--that sun which now, having some\r\ntime passed its meridian height, is sinking towards the west.\r\n\r\nSouthward appear, coming as it were from below the horizon, some dark\r\nspecks, scattered widely from east to west, and moving slowly.  On they\r\ncome, each instant increasing in numbers, till they form one dark line.\r\nThey are animals with huge heads and dark shaggy manes, browsing as they\r\nadvance, clearing the herbage before them.  They are a herd of bison,\r\nknown by the wild hunters of the west as buffaloes--countless apparently\r\nin numbers--powerful and ferocious in appearance, with their short thick\r\nhorns and long heads.  Now they halt, as the richer pasturage entices;\r\nnow again advance.  A large number lie down to rest, while others,\r\nmoving out of the midst, seem to be acting as scouts to give notice of\r\nthe approach of danger.  They go on as before, darkening the whole\r\nsouthern horizon.  The wind is from the west; the scouts lift up their\r\nshaggy heads and sniff the air, but discover no danger.  From the east\r\nanother dark line rises quickly above the horizon: the ground shakes\r\nwith the tramp of horses.  It is a troop of huntsmen--savage warriors of\r\nthe desert.  What clothing they wear is of leather gaily adorned.  Some\r\nhave feathers in their heads, and their dark red skins painted\r\ncuriously.  Some carry bows richly ornamented: a few only are armed with\r\nrifles.  A few, who, by their dress, the feathers and adornments of the\r\nhead, appear to be chiefs, ride a-head and keep the line in order.\r\nEvery man holds his weapon ready for instant use.  They advance\r\nsteadily, keeping an even line.  Their leader waves his rifle.\r\nInstantly the steeds spring forward.  Like a whirlwind they dash on: no\r\nwant of energy now.  The huntsmen are among the bewildered herd before\r\ntheir approach has been perceived.  Arrows fly in quick succession from\r\nevery bow--bullets from the rifles.  The huntsmen have filled their\r\nmouths with the leaden messengers of death, and drop them into their\r\nrifles as they gallop on, firing right and left--singling out the\r\nfattest beasts at a glance--and never erring in their aim.  In a few\r\nminutes the plain is thickly strewn with the huge carcasses of the\r\nshaggy buffaloes, each huntsman, as he passes on, dropping some article\r\nof his property by which he may know the beast he has killed.  Now the\r\nherd begin to seek for safety in flight, still keeping in the direction\r\nthey had before been taking, some scattering, however, on each side.\r\nThe eager hunters pursue till the whole prairie, from right to left, is\r\ncovered with flying buffaloes and wild horsemen; the crack of the rifles\r\nsounding distinctly through the calm summer air, in which the tiny\r\nwreath of smoke ascends unbroken and marks the hunter's progress.\r\n\r\nAmong the huntsmen rides one distinguished from the rest by his more\r\ncomplete, yet less ornamented clothing; by a leather cap without\r\nfeathers, and by the perfect order of his rifle and hunting\r\naccoutrements.\r\n\r\nOn a nearer inspection his skin--though tanned, and wrinkled, and\r\nfurrowed, by long exposure to the weather, and by age and toil--might be\r\ndiscovered to have been of a much lighter hue originally than that of\r\nhis companions.  Old as he was, no one was more eager in the chase, and\r\nno one's rifle brought down so great a number of buffaloes as did his.\r\nTo all appearance he was as active and strong as the youngest huntsman\r\nof the band.  In the course of the hunt he had reached the extreme left\r\nof the line.  A superb bull appeared before him.  \"I'll have you for\r\nyour robe, if not for your meat, old fellow,\" exclaimed the hunter,\r\ngalloping on towards the animal's right flank, so as to turn him yet\r\nfurther from the herd, and to obtain a more direct shot at his head or\r\nat his shoulders.  There are occasions when the most practised of shots\r\nwill find himself at fault--the firmest nerves will fail.  The old\r\nhunter had reached a satisfactory position--he raised his rifle, and\r\nfired.  At that instant, while still at full speed, his horse's front\r\nfeet sunk into a hole made by a badger, or some other of the smaller\r\ncreatures inhabiting the prairie; and the animal, unable to recover\r\nitself, threw the hunter violently forward over its head, where he lay\r\nwithout moving, and apparently dead.  The horse struggled to free\r\nitself; and then, as it fell forward, gave utterance to one of those\r\npiercing cries of agony not often heard, and, when heard, not to be\r\nforgotten.  Both fore legs were broken.  Its fate was certain.  It must\r\nbecome the prey of the ravenous wolves, who speedily scent out the spots\r\nwhere the hunters have overtaken a herd of buffaloes.  Meantime the\r\nbuffalo, who had been struck by the hunter's bullet, but not so wounded\r\nas to bring him instantly to the ground, galloped on for some distance\r\nin the direction he was before going, when, feeling the pain of his\r\nwound, or hearing the cry of the horse, he turned round to face his\r\nenemies.  Seeing both steed and rider prostrate, he tossed his head, and\r\nthen, lowering his horns close to the ground, prepared to charge.  The\r\nlast moments of the old hunter seemed approaching.  The cry of agony\r\nuttered by his favourite steed roused him.  He looked up and saw the\r\nbuffalo about to make its charge.  His hand had never relaxed its grasp\r\nof his rifle.  To feel for his powder-flask and to load was the work of\r\nan instant; and, without an attempt to rise, he brought the muzzle of\r\nhis piece to bear on the furious animal as it was within a few paces of\r\nhim.  \"Rob Nixon never feared man nor beast, and will not this time; let\r\nan old bull bellow as loud as he may,\" he muttered, as he raised his\r\nrifle and fired.  The bullet took effect, but did not stop the headlong\r\ncareer of the enraged monster, which came on, ploughing up the ground,\r\ntowards him.  The hunter saw his danger and tried to rise, but in vain.\r\nHe then made a desperate endeavour to drag himself out of the way of the\r\ncreature.  He but partially succeeded, when the buffalo, sinking down,\r\nrolled over and over, crushing, with his huge carcase, the already\r\ninjured legs and lower extremities of the unfortunate hunter.  In spite\r\nof the pain he was enduring, the old man, raising himself on his elbow,\r\ngrimly, surveyed his conquered foe--\"You've the worst of it, though you\r\nnearly did for me, I own,\" he exclaimed, nodding his head; \"but a miss\r\nis as good as a mile, and when I'm free of you, maybe I'll sup off your\r\nhump.\"\r\n\r\nTo liberate himself from the monster's carcase was, however, no easy\r\ntask, injured as he was already by his fall, and by the weight of the\r\nbuffalo pressing on him.  He made several attempts, but the pain was\r\nvery great, and he found that his strength was failing him.  While\r\nresting, before making another attempt to move, he perceived his poor\r\nhorse, whose convulsive struggles showed how much he had been injured.\r\nOn looking round, also, he discovered that the accident had taken place\r\nin a slight hollow, which, shallow as it was, shut him out from the view\r\nof his companions, who were now pursuing the remainder of the herd at a\r\nconsiderable distance from where he lay.  Again and again he tried to\r\ndrag his injured limbs from beneath the buffalo.  He had never given in\r\nwhile consciousness remained, and many were the accidents which had\r\nhappened to him during his long hunter's life.  Would he give in now?\r\n\"No, not I,\" he muttered; \"Rob Nixon is not the boy for that.\"  At\r\nlength, however, his spirit succumbed to bodily suffering, and he sank\r\nback exhausted and fainting, scarcely conscious of what had happened, or\r\nwhere he was.  Had he retained sufficient strength to fire his rifle he\r\nmight have done so, and summoned some of the hunters to his assistance;\r\nbut he was unable even to load it, so it lay useless by his side.  Thus\r\nhe remained; time passed by--no one approached him--the sun sank in the\r\nhorizon--darkness came on.  It appeared too probable that the fate of\r\nmany a hunter in that vast prairie would be his.  How long he had\r\nremained in a state of stupor he could not tell; consciousness returned\r\nat length, and, revived by the cool air of night, he sat up and gazed\r\nabout him.  The stars had come out and were shining brilliantly\r\noverhead, enabling him to see to the extent of his limited horizon.  The\r\ndead buffalo still pressed on his legs--a hideous nightmare; his horse\r\nlay near giving vent to his agony in piteous groans, and every now and\r\nthen making an attempt to rise to his feet.  \"My poor mustang, you are\r\nin a bad way I fear,\" said the hunter, in a tone of commiseration,\r\nforgetting his own sufferings; \"I would put an end to thy misery, and so\r\nrender thee the only service in my power, but that I cannot turn myself\r\nto load my rifle.  Alack! alack! we shall both of us ere long be food\r\nfor the wolves; but, though I must meet my fate as becomes a man, I\r\nwould save you--poor, dumb brute that you are--from being torn by their\r\nravenous fangs while life remains in you.\"  Such were the thoughts which\r\npassed through the hunter's mind, for it can scarcely be said that he\r\nspoke them aloud.\r\n\r\nHe would probably again have relapsed into a state of stupor, but that a\r\nhideous howl, borne by the night breeze, reached his ears.  \"Wolves!\" he\r\nexclaimed; \"ah!  I know you, you brutes.\"  The howl was repeated again\r\nand again, its increased loudness showing that the creatures were\r\napproaching.  The well-known terrible sounds roused up the old hunter to\r\nmake renewed exertions to extricate himself.  This time, by dint of\r\ndragging himself out with his arms, he succeeded in getting his feet\r\nfrom under the buffalo; but he then discovered, to his dismay, that his\r\nthigh had either been broken, or so severely sprained by his fall, that\r\nto walk would be impossible.  He managed, however, to load his rifle.\r\nScarcely had he done so when the struggles of his horse reminded him of\r\nthe pain the poor animal was suffering.  Although he knew that every\r\ncharge of powder in his flask would be required for his own defence, he\r\ndid not hesitate in performing the act of mercy which the case required.\r\nHe uttered no sentimental speech, though a pang of grief passed through\r\nhis heart as he pointed the weapon at the horse's head.  His aim was\r\ntrue, and the noble animal fell dead.  \"He's gone; not long before me, I\r\nguess,\" he muttered, as he reloaded his piece.  \"Those brutes will find\r\nme out, there is no doubt about that; but I'll have a fight first--Rob\r\nNixon will die game.\"  The old hunter drew a long knife from a sheath at\r\nhis side, and, deliberately examining its point, placed it on the ground\r\nnear him while he reloaded his rifle.  Thus did the old man prepare for\r\nan inevitable and dreadful death, as he believed; yet not a prayer did\r\nhe offer up, not a thought did he cast at the future.  Eternity, heaven,\r\nand hell, were matters unknown; or, if once known, long since forgotten.\r\nYet forgetfulness of a fact will not do away with it.  They are awful\r\nrealities, and will assuredly be found such, however much men may strive\r\nto banish them from their thoughts.  The young especially are surprised\r\nto hear that old men have forgotten what they learned in their youth,\r\nthat they neglect to pray, to read the Bible, to think about God and\r\ntheir own souls; but let them be assured that if once they give up the\r\nhabit of praying, of studying God's holy Word, of obeying His commands,\r\nthere is one ever ready to persuade them that there is no harm in this\r\nneglect; that it will save them much trouble; and that it is far more\r\nmanly to neglect prayers, to be irreligious and profane, than to love,\r\nserve, and obey their Maker.  A downward course is sadly easy; let them\r\nbeware of taking the first step.  Each step they take in the wrong\r\ndirection they will find it more and more difficult to recover, till,\r\nlike the old huntsman, they will cease to care about the matter, and God\r\nwill no longer be in their thoughts.  There lay that old man on the wild\r\nprairie, a melancholy spectacle,--not so much that he was surrounded by\r\ndangers--that he was wounded and crippled--that wild beasts were near\r\nhim--that, if he escaped their fangs, starvation threatened him,--but\r\nthat he had no hope for the future--that he had no trust in God--that he\r\nhad not laid hold of the means of salvation.\r\n\r\nAs Rob Nixon lay on the ground supporting his head on his arm, he turned\r\nhis gaze round and round, peering into the darkness to watch for any\r\nthing moving near him.  He knew that before the sun set his Indian\r\ncomrades would have carried off the flesh from the buffaloes they had\r\nkilled, and that after that they, would move their camp to a distance,\r\nno one being likely to return.  He probably would not be missed for some\r\ntime, and when missed, it would be supposed that he had fallen into the\r\nhands of the Salteux, or Ojibways, the hereditary enemies of their\r\nnation, and that already his scalp had been carried off as a trophy by\r\nthose hated foes.  \"They'll revenge me; that's one comfort, and the\r\nOjibways will get paid for what the wolves have done.\"  These were\r\nnearly the last thoughts which passed through the brain of the old\r\nhunter, as the howls and yelps of the wolves, which had formed a\r\ndreadful concert at a distance around him, approached still nearer.  \"I\r\nguessed the vermin wouldn't be long in finding me out,\" he muttered;\r\nand, on looking up, he saw through the darkness, glaring fiercely down\r\non him from the edge of the hollow in which he lay, the eyes of a pack\r\nof wolves.  \"I'll stop the howling of some of you,\" he exclaimed,\r\nlifting his rifle.  There was no cry; but a gap in the circle of eyes\r\nshowed that a wolf had fallen, and instantly afterwards the loud barking\r\nand yelping proved that the savage creatures were tearing their\r\ncompanion to pieces.  This gave time to the old man to re-load and to\r\npick off another wolf.  In this manner he killed several, and though he\r\ndid not drive them away, they were prevented from approaching nearer.\r\nOn finding that such was the case, his hopes of escaping their fangs\r\nrose slightly, at the same time that the lightness of his powder-flask\r\nand bullet bag, told him that his ammunition would soon fail, and that\r\nthen he would have his hunting knife alone on which to depend.  He\r\naccordingly waited, without again firing, watching his foes, who\r\ncontinued howling and wrangling over the bodies of their fellows.  Now\r\nand then one would descend a short way into the hollow, attracted by the\r\nscent of the dead horse and buffalo, but a sudden shout from the old\r\nhunter kept the intruders at a respectful distance.  He was well aware,\r\nhowever, that should exhausted nature for one instant compel him to drop\r\nasleep, the brutes would be upon him, and tear him limb from limb.  Thus\r\nthe hours of the night passed slowly along.  Many men would have\r\nsuccumbed; but, hardened by a long life of danger and activity, Robert\r\nNixon held out bravely, in spite of the pain, and thirst, and hunger,\r\nfrom which he was suffering.  Never for one moment was his eye off his\r\nenemies, while his fingers were on the trigger ready to shoot the first\r\nwhich might venture to approach.  More than once he muttered to himself,\r\n\"It must be near morning, and then these vermin will take themselves\r\noff, and let me have some rest.  Ah, rest! that's the very thing I have\r\nbeen wanting,\" he continued; \"it's little enough I've ever had of it.\r\nI've been working away all my life, and where's the good I've got out of\r\nit?  There's been something wrong, I suppose; but I can't make it out.\r\nBest!  Yes, that's it.  I should just like to find myself sitting in my\r\nlodge among a people who don't care, like these Dakotahs, to be always\r\nfighting or hunting: but they are not a bad people, and they've been\r\ngood friends to me, and I've no fault to find with their ways, though\r\nI'll own they're more suited to young men than to an old one like me.\r\nBut there's little use my thinking this.  Maybe, I shall never see them\r\nor any other of my fellow-creatures again.\"  It was only now and then\r\nthat his mind framed any thoughts as coherent as these; generally he\r\nremained in a dreamy condition, only awake to the external objects\r\nimmediately surrounding him.  Gradually, too, his strength began to\r\nfail, though he was not aware of the fact.  The howls, and barks, and\r\nsnarling, and other hideous sounds made by the wolves, increased.  He\r\ncould see them moving about in numbers, around the edge of the basin,\r\ntheir red fiery eyes ever and anon glaring down on him.  At last they\r\nseemed to be holding a consultation, and to have settled their disputes,\r\nprobably from not having longer a bone of contention unpicked among\r\nthem.  They were evidently, once more, about to make an attack on him.\r\nA large brute, who had long been prowling round, first crept on,\r\ngnashing his teeth.  The old man lifted his rifle and the creature, with\r\na loud cry, fell dead.  Another and another came on, and before he could\r\nload, the foremost had got close up to him.  He fired at the animal's\r\nhead.  It rolled over, and, the flash of his rifle scaring the rest,\r\nwith hideous yelps, they took to flight, the old man firing after them\r\ndirectly he could re-load.  He could scarcely believe that he was to\r\nremain unmolested, and once more loading his rifle, he rested as before\r\non his arm, watching for their re-appearance.  Gradually, however,\r\nexhausted nature gave way, and he sank down unconscious on the ground,\r\nto sleep, it might be, the sleep of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose and shone forth brightly on the earth.  There was the sound\r\nof winged creatures in Robert Nixon's ears as he once more awoke and\r\ngazed languidly around.  His first impulse was to attempt to rise, but\r\nthe anguish he suffered the instant he moved reminded him of the\r\ninjuries he had received.  Vain were his efforts; to stand up was\r\nimpossible.  Although the wolves for the time were gone, they, to a\r\ncertainty, would return at night, and thus, without ammunition, how\r\ncould he defend himself against them?  He might subsist on the meat of\r\nthe buffalo for a day or two, but that would soon become uneatable, and\r\nas he could scarcely hope to recover from his hurt for many days, even\r\nif he escaped the wolves, he must die of starvation.  Again he sank into\r\na state of mental stupor, though his eye still remained cognisant of\r\nexternal objects.  As the old hunter thus lay on the ground his eye fell\r\non a horseman riding rapidly by.  He was a Salteux, or Ojibway Indian, a\r\npeople having a deadly feud with his friends, the Sioux.  The sight\r\nroused him.  To kill the man and capture his horse was the idea which at\r\nonce occurred to him.  Rousing himself by a violent exertion he levelled\r\nhis rifle and fired.  Not for an instant did he hesitate about taking\r\nthe life of a fellow-creature.  That fellow-creature was a foe of his\r\nfriends, whose badge he wore, and would, he believed, kill him if he was\r\ndiscovered.  He had miscalculated his powers--his eye had grown dim, his\r\narm had lost its nerve; the bullet which once would have proved a sure\r\nmessenger of death flew wide of its mark, and the Indian sat his horse\r\nunharmed.  He turned, however, immediately, and galloped towards the\r\nspot whence the shot came.  The old hunter had expended his last bullet.\r\nWith grim satisfaction he awaited the Indian's approach, and the\r\nexpected flourish of the scalping-knife, or the kinder blow of the\r\ntomahawk, which would deprive him at once of life.  \"Better so than be\r\ntorn by the fangs of those vermin the wolves,\" he muttered, for though\r\nhe clutched his knife to strike back, he well knew that he was at the\r\nmercy of his adversary.  The Indian, though a rifle hung at his back,\r\nrode steadily up without unslinging it.  \"A friend!\" he shouted in the\r\nSalteux, or Ojibway dialect,--\"A friend! fire not again.\"\r\n\r\n\"A friend!  How so?\" exclaimed the old hunter.  \"Your people and mine\r\nare mortal foes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would be a friend to all the suffering and distressed,\" was the\r\nunexpected answer.  \"I see what has happened--you have fought bravely\r\nfor your life; the remains of the wolves tell me that, but before\r\nanother sun has risen you would have been torn limb from limb by their\r\nfellows.  Truly I am thankful that I was sent to save you from death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sent!  Who sent you?\" cried the old hunter, gazing up at the strange\r\nIndian.  The other having just dismounted from his horse stood looking\r\ncompassionately down on him.  \"He who watches over the fatherless and\r\nwidows, and all who are distressed,\" answered the Indian.  \"A generous\r\nkind person I doubt not, but I know of none such in this land; he must\r\nlive far away from here,\" said the old hunter.  \"He lives in Heaven, and\r\nHis eye is everywhere,\" said the Indian solemnly.  \"He loves all\r\nmankind; without His will not a sparrow falls to the ground; and I am\r\nsure, therefore, that it was His will that I should come to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly you speak strange words for a redskin!\" exclaimed the hunter.  \"I\r\nhave heard long ago white men talk as you, but never an Indian.  You are\r\none I see; there is no deceiving me.  I cannot understand the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you as we go along,\" said the Indian; \"but we must no\r\nlonger delay, father; we have many miles to travel before we can reach\r\nmy people, and I know not how I can restore you to your friends.  It\r\nwould be dangerous for me to approach them, for they could not\r\nunderstand how I can only wish them good.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go with you, friend,\" said the old man.  \"I would gladly dwell\r\nwith your people, and hear more of those strange matters of which you\r\nhave been speaking.\"\r\n\r\nWithout further exchange of words the Indian, having examined the old\r\nman's hurts, gave him some dried meat and a draught from his\r\nwater-flask, and lifted him with the utmost care on his horse; he then\r\ntook the hunter's rifle and horse's trappings before moving off.  He\r\nalso secured the tongue and hump, and some slices from the buffalo's\r\nback, which he hung to his saddle-bow.  \"We may require more provision\r\nthan our own rifles can supply before we reach our journey's end,\" he\r\nobserved; as he did so, pointing to the north-east.  Robert Nixon\r\nwithout hesitation yielded to all his suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe day was already considerably advanced, and the Indian seemed anxious\r\nto push on.  Keeping up a rapid pace, he walked by the side of his\r\ncompanion, who, overcome by weakness and want of sleep would have fallen\r\noff, had not his strong arm held him on.  Thus they journeyed hour after\r\nhour across the prairie.  The Indian from the first employed various\r\ndevices for rendering his trail invisible.  On starting he moved for\r\nsome distance westward, till he reached the bed of a small stream, on\r\nwhich even the sharp eye of a native could scarcely perceive a trace;\r\nthen circling round, he commenced his intended course.  Many miles were\r\npassed over; and the bank of a rapid river was reached, when the setting\r\nsun warned him that it was time to encamp.  Instead, however, of doing\r\nso, he at once led his horse into the stream, and keeping close to the\r\nshore waded against the current, often having the water up to his waist,\r\nfor a considerable distance, then coming to a ford he crossed over and\r\ncontinued along in the same direction till he once more returned to dry\r\nground.  The bank was fringed on each side by a belt of trees, which in\r\nthe warm weather of summer afforded ample shelter from the dew, and\r\nconcealment from any passing enemy.  The chief trees were poplar,\r\nwillow, and alder; but there were also spruce and birch.  Bound the\r\nlatter lay large sheets of the bark.  A quantity of these the Indian at\r\nonce collected, and with some thin poles which he cut with his hatchet\r\nhe rapidly constructed a small hut or wigwam, strewing the floor with\r\nthe young shoots of the spruce-fir.  On this couch he placed his injured\r\ncompanion, putting his saddle under his head as a pillow.  He then\r\nbrought the old man some food and water, and next proceeded to examine\r\nhis hurts with more attention than he had before been able to bestow.\r\nBringing water from the river he fomented his bruises for a long time,\r\nand then searching for some leaves of a plant possessed of healing\r\nqualities, he bound them with strips of soft leather round his swollen\r\nlimbs.  More than once the old hunter expressed his surprise that a\r\nstranger should care so much for him, and should actually feed and tend\r\nhim before he had himself partaken of food and rested.  \"I serve a\r\nloving Master, and I am but obeying His wishes,\" was the laconic answer.\r\n\"Very strange! very strange!\" again and again muttered the old man;\r\n\"you must tell me something about that Master of yours.  I cannot\r\nunderstand who he can be.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not disappoint you, father, for I love to speak of Him,\" said\r\nthe Indian; \"I will come anon and sit by your side and tell you what I\r\nknow.  It will interest you, I doubt not, and maybe you will wish to\r\nknow more about Him.\"  Some time passed, however, before the Indian was\r\nable to fulfil his promise.  He had to tend his horse and to set some\r\ntraps to catch any small game which might pass, and to search for\r\ncertain roots and berries for food.  He showed, too, by all his\r\nmovements that he considered himself in an enemy's country, or in the\r\nneighbourhood of an enemy from whom it was necessary to keep concealed.\r\nWhen he came back the old man had fallen asleep.  \"Let him sleep on,\"\r\nsaid the Indian to himself: \"our Father in Heaven will watch over and\r\nprotect us both.  I would that I could watch, but my body requires\r\nrest.\"  Having tethered his horse close at hand, strewed the ground with\r\na few spruce-fir tops, and placed his rifle by his side, he knelt down\r\nand prayed, not as once to Manitou, to the Great Spirit, the unknown\r\nGod, but to the true God,--a God no longer feared as a worker of evil,\r\nbut beloved as the source of all good, of all blessings, spiritual and\r\ntemporal.  His prayer finished, he stretched himself on his couch, and\r\nwas in an instant asleep.\r\n\r\nThe silvery streaks of early dawn were just appearing in the eastern\r\nsky--seen amid the foliage of the wood, when the Indian, impulsively\r\ngrasping his rifle, started to his feet.  His quick ear had caught, even\r\nin his sleep, the sound of a distant shot.  It might be fired by a\r\nfriend, but very likely by a foe, and it behoved him to be on the alert.\r\nThe old hunter heard it also, but it did not awake him.  \"Ah! they are\r\non us.  No matter, we'll fight for our lives,\" he muttered in his sleep.\r\n\"Hurrah, lads!  Rob Nixon will not yield--never while he's an arm to\r\nstrike.\"  He spoke in English, which the Indian seemed to understand,\r\nthough the observation he made was in his own language.  \"Our own arms\r\nwill do little for us, father, unless we trust in Him who is\r\nall-powerful to save.\"  His voice awoke the old man, who sat up and\r\nlooked around from out of his hut.  Seeing the Indian in the attitude of\r\nlistening, he at once comprehended the state of matters.  \"Few or many\r\nI'll stand by you, friend Redskin,\" he exclaimed, apparently forgetting\r\nhis helpless condition; \"load my rifle, and hand it to me.  If foes are\r\ncoming, they shall learn that Rob Nixon has not lost the use of his arms\r\nand eyes, whatever he may have of his legs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt not your readiness to fight, father,\" said the Indian,\r\naddressing the old man thus to show his respect for age; \"but we may\r\nhope to avoid the necessity of having to defend ourselves.  Friends and\r\nnot foes may be near us, or we may escape discovery; or, what is better\r\nstill, we may overcome the enmity of those who approach us with bad\r\nintent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your talk is again strange, as it was yesterday,\" answered the hunter;\r\n\"I know not what you mean by overcoming enmity.  There is only one way\r\nthat I have ever found answer both with pale-faces and redskins, and\r\nthat is by killing your enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try what kindness will do, father.  Love is the law of the true God,\"\r\nsaid the Indian; \"but we will anon talk of these things.  I will go\r\nforth and learn what the shot we heard just now means.\"\r\n\r\n\"Load my rifle, and give it me first, I pray you,\" said the white\r\nhunter; \"I have great faith in my old way of doing things, and am not\r\nlikely to change.\"  The Indian loaded the rifle and handed it to him,\r\nand without saying a word more set off through the wood, and was soon\r\nout of sight.  Rob Nixon lay still, with his rifle resting across his\r\nbody, ready to fire should an enemy appear.  Over and over again he\r\nmuttered: \"Strange! strange! that a redskin should talk so.  I cannot\r\nmake it out.\"  Several minutes passed by, and the Indian did not return.\r\nThe old man grew more anxious than he would have acknowledged to\r\nhimself.  He had some natural feeling on his own account should his new\r\nfriend have been cut off, but he was also anxious for that new friend,\r\nto whom he could not but be grateful for the service he had rendered\r\nhim.  At length he saw the bushes move, and the Indian appeared and\r\ncrept close up to him.  \"There are foes, and many of them,\" he said in a\r\nlow voice; \"they are near at hand, but they are not seeking for us; and\r\nthus, if they do not cross our trail, we may yet escape discovery.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian had already concealed his horse in a thicket, and, by\r\ncarefully surrounding the spot where they lay with boughs, their little\r\ncamp was completely hidden from the sight of any casual passer-by.  The\r\nboughs he had cut from the interior part of a thicket, for, had they\r\nbeen taken from the outer side, the eye of an Indian would at once have\r\nobserved the white stumps which were left.  Again, by crossing the river\r\nin the mode they had done, there was no trail to lead to their camp.\r\nFor these reasons the Indian and the white hunter had good cause to\r\nbelieve that they might escape discovery.  As their enemies were as yet\r\nat some distance it was not deemed necessary to keep altogether silent.\r\nThe old hunter was the most loquacious.  \"I would, friend Redskin,\" said\r\nhe, \"that I had the use of my legs and half a dozen of my old companions\r\nat my back, and I wouldn't fear as to holding my own against three-score\r\nor more of Crees, or Ojibways; no offence to you, friend; for there are\r\nnot many like you, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your people fight bravely but foolishly, according to Indian notions,\"\r\nanswered the Indian; \"for, instead of advancing on their foes under\r\nshelter and trying to take them unawares, they dress themselves in fine\r\nclothes, make a great noise when going forth to battle, and expose their\r\nbodies to be shot at.  I was once esteemed a mighty warrior, and was a\r\nman of blood; I have engaged in much fighting, but would now wish to\r\nbury the hatchet of war with all the world.  I thank you for what you\r\nsay of me; but things of which I once boasted, I boast of no longer.  I\r\nam a chief of many people; but instead, as at one time, of wishing to\r\nlead them to war, I now desire to lead them to a knowledge of the Lord\r\nand Master whom I serve--the Saviour of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Every man to his taste, friend Redskin,\" said the old hunter; \"when I\r\nwas a young man like you I could not have fighting or hunting enough.\r\nNow, I own, I am growing somewhat weary of the work; and, if we get to\r\nthe end of this journey with our scalps on, maybe I'll settle down with\r\nyour people.\"\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that the old man could not comprehend what was the\r\nmeaning of the Indian when he spoke thus.  If he had a glimmering of the\r\ntruth, he turned away from it.  Many do the same.  Felix has numberless\r\nimitators.  Both the Indian and Rob Nixon were silent for some minutes,\r\nattentively listening for the approach of the strangers.  Not a sound,\r\nhowever, being heard, they began to hope that their enemies had gone a\r\ndifferent way.  \"There'll be no fighting this time, I guess, friend\r\nRedskin,\" said the old man.  \"It's all the better, too, considering that\r\nyou don't seem much inclined for it; and I'm not in the best trim for\r\nwork of that sort, or any work, truth to say.\"\r\n\r\nRob Nixon had remarked that the Indian had winced more than once when\r\naddressed as Redskin, which was certainly not a respectful or\r\ncomplimentary mode of addressing him.  The reason of this became still\r\nmore evident when he spoke of himself as a chief.  Chiefs in general\r\nwould not for an instant have suffered such familiarity.  Rob Nixon saw\r\nthat it was time to apologise.  He did so in his own way.  \"I say,\r\nfriend, I've just a thing to ask you.  You've a name, I doubt not,\r\nshowing forth some of the brave deeds you have done, the enemies you\r\nhave slain, the miles you have run, the rivers you have swam across, the\r\nbears you have captured, or the beavers you have trapped.  Tell me, what\r\nis it? for I've a notion the one I've been giving you is not altogether\r\nthe right or a pleasant one.\"  The Indian smiled as he answered quietly,\r\n\"The name I bear, and the only one by which I desire to be called, is\r\nPeter.  It was given me, not for killing men or slaughtering beasts, but\r\nat my baptism, when I was received into the Church of Christ, and\r\nundertook to love, honour, serve, and obey Him in all things as my Lord\r\nand Master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter!  Peter! that's a strange name for an Injun,\" said the white\r\nhunter half to himself.  \"Why, that's such a name as they give in the\r\nold country to a Christian.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I, too, am a Christian, though an unworthy one, father,\" answered\r\nthe Indian humbly.  \"Never heard before of a Christian Injun!\" exclaimed\r\nthe old man bluntly; \"but strange things happen I'll allow.  I don't\r\ndoubt your word; mind that, friend.  It was strange that when you saw I\r\nwas a friend of the Dakotahs you didn't scalp me, without asking\r\nquestions, and leave me to be eaten by wolves.  That's the true Injun\r\nway.  It was strange that you should take me up, put me on your horse,\r\nwalk yourself all these miles, with some hundreds more before you, and\r\nrisk your own life to save mine.  All that is strange, I say; and so,\r\nfriend, I don't know what other strange things may happen.  Well, if so\r\nyou wish, I'll call you Peter; but I'd rather by far call you by your\r\nInjun name.  It was a good one, I'll warrant.  Come, tell it now.  You\r\nneed not be ashamed of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the sight of man I am not ashamed of it, for by most of my people I\r\nam called by it still; but in the sight of God I am ashamed of it, and\r\nstill more am I ashamed of the deeds which gained it for me.  How, think\r\nyou, blood-stained and guilty as I was, could I stand in the presence of\r\nOne pure, holy, loving, and merciful?  I tell you, aged friend, neither\r\nyou nor I, nor any man, could appear before God without fear and\r\ntrembling, if it were not that He is a God of love, and that through His\r\ngreat love for us, His creatures, whom He has placed on the world, He\r\nsent His only Son, that all who believe in Him should not perish, but\r\nhave eternal life.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Christian Indian warmed as he went on in his discourse, which\r\nwas intermingled with many beautiful illustrations and figures of\r\nspeech, which it would be vain to attempt to translate.  Gradually he\r\nthus unfolded the fundamental truths of the Gospel.  The old white\r\nhunter listened, and even listened attentively, but, far from warming,\r\nseemed scarcely to comprehend what was said.  \"Strange! very strange!\"\r\nhe muttered frequently; \"and that an Injun should talk thus.  Forty\r\nyears have I lived among the redskins, and never believed that they knew\r\nmore than their fathers.\"  Peter,--as he desired to be called, though\r\nhis heathen name was Aronhiakeura, or otherwise the Fiery Arrow, from\r\nthe rapidity of his onslaught and the devastation he caused,--now stated\r\nhis belief that they might venture to proceed without the likelihood of\r\nbeing molested.  Scarcely, however, had he emerged from their leafy\r\ncover when another shot was fired close to them; and, before he could\r\nagain seek concealment, three fully armed Dakotahs appeared directly in\r\nfront of him.  The Dakotahs instantly rushed behind the trees, to serve\r\nas shields should he fire, but he held up his hands to show that he was\r\nunarmed, and in a low voice entreated his companion to remain quiet.\r\nThat resistance would be hopeless was evident by the appearance directly\r\nafterwards of a dozen or more Indians, who were seen flitting amidst the\r\nwood, each man obtaining the best shelter in his power.  Peter stood\r\nfully exposed to view, without flinching or even contemplating\r\nconcealing himself.  Fearless behaviour is sure to obtain the admiration\r\nof Indians.  Naturally suspicious they possibly supposed that he had a\r\nstrong force concealed somewhere near at hand, and that they had\r\nthemselves fallen into an ambush.  Had they found and followed up his\r\ntrail they would have discovered exactly the state of the case.  That he\r\nhad a wounded companion would not have escaped their notice, and that he\r\nhad but one horse, and travelled slowly would also have been known to\r\nthem.  By his having crossed the stream, however, and come along its bed\r\nfor some distance they were at fault in this respect.  Peter kept his\r\npost without flinching; he well knew that the Dakotahs were watching\r\nhim; indeed, here and there he could distinguish the eye of a\r\nred-skinned warrior glimmering, or the top of a plume waving among the\r\ntrunks of the trees or brushwood.  All the time Rob Nixon on his part\r\nwas watching his preserver with intense anxiety.  He had conceived a\r\nwarm regard for him, and, knowing the treachery so often exhibited by\r\nthe natives, trembled for his safety.  Peter at length waved his hand to\r\nshow that he was about to speak; \"What seek you, friends?\" he said in a\r\ncalm tone; \"I am a man of peace, I desire to be friends with all men,\r\nand to injure no one; moreover, I would that you and all men had the\r\nwisdom and enjoyed the happiness which I possess.  See, I cannot harm\r\nyou;\" as he spoke he raised up both his hands high in the air.  The\r\nDakotahs, totally unaccustomed to an address of this description, were\r\ngreatly astonished.  Their chief, not to be undone in fearlessness,\r\nstepped from behind his covert, completely exposing himself to view.\r\n\"Who are you, friend? and whence do you come?\" he asked; \"you cannot be\r\nwhat you seem?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a man like yourself, friend, and I am truly what I seem--a native\r\nof this land, and of a tribe unhappily constantly at enmity with yours,\"\r\nanswered Peter firmly; \"but know, O chief, that I differ from many of my\r\npeople; that I love you and your people, and all mankind.  Will you\r\nlisten to the reason of this?  Let your people appear, there is no\r\ntreachery intended them; I am in your power--why doubt my word?\"  One by\r\none the Dakotahs crept from behind the trees which had concealed them,\r\nand a considerable number assembled in front of the Indian, who spoke to\r\nthem of the Gospel of love, and of the glorious scheme of redemption.\r\nThey listened attentively; most of them with mute astonishment.  Now and\r\nthen one of the chief men would give way to his feelings by a sound\r\nsignifying either approbation or dissent, but not a remark was uttered\r\ntill the speaker ceased.  For a time all were silent, then with gravity\r\nand deliberation one of the chiefs waved his hand and observed, \"These\r\nare strange words the man speaks--he must be a great medicine man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly he has the wisdom of the white-faces,\" said a second; \"has he\r\ntheir treachery?  Can he be trusted?\"\r\n\r\n\"The things he says may be true, but they concern not us,\" remarked a\r\nthird.  \"Wisdom is wisdom whoever speaks it,\" said a grave old warrior\r\nwho had shown himself as active in his movements as the youngest of his\r\ncompanions.  \"What the stranger tells us of must be good for one man, as\r\nfor another.  Rest is good for the weary; who among my brothers, too,\r\nwould not rather serve a powerful and kind chief than an inferior and\r\nmerciless one.  He tells us of rest for the weary; of a great and good\r\nchief, who can give us all things to make us happy,--I like his\r\ndiscourse, my brothers.\"  The last speaker seemed to be carrying several\r\nwith him, when another started up exclaiming, \"What the stranger says\r\ncomes from the pale-faces--it may be false; there must be some\r\ntreacherous design in it.  Let us rather dance this night the\r\nscalp-dance round his scalp than listen to his crafty tales.  See, I\r\nfear him not.\"  The savage as he spoke lifted his rifle and was about to\r\nfire it at Peter, when the rest drew him back, crying out, \"He is a\r\nmedicine man--a great medicine man, and may work us ill; interfere not\r\nwith him; though we do not listen to his counsel, let him go free.  Even\r\nnow, while we are speaking, we know not what injury he may be preparing\r\nto do us!\"  Thus the discussion went on for a considerable time, Peter\r\nwaiting patiently for its result.  Although the speakers had retired\r\nrather too far off for him to hear all that was said, he gathered\r\nsufficient to know the tenor of the discussion; still, no fear entered\r\nhis bosom, he knew that his life was in the hand of One mighty to save.\r\nWhile he stood waiting the result he prayed for himself certainly, but\r\nyet more earnestly that the truth might be brought home to the dark\r\nhearts of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nNorth American Indians are deliberate in their councils.  Peter knew\r\nthat his fate would not be decided quickly; but neither by word, look,\r\nnor action, did he show the slightest impatience.  The old white hunter,\r\nmeantime, had made up his mind to risk everything rather than allow any\r\ninjury, which he could avert, to happen to his new friend.  That they\r\nwould recognise him he had no doubt; and the fact that he was found in\r\ncompany with a member of a hostile tribe would be considered so\r\nsuspicious, that they would possibly put him to death without stopping\r\nto ask questions.  However, should Peter be killed or made prisoner by\r\nthe Dakotahs, he would be left to perish; so that he felt, indeed, that\r\nhis fate depended on that of his friend.  From where he lay he could see\r\namid the branches the Indians holding their council.  His trusty rifle\r\nwas by his side, and noiselessly he brought it to cover their principal\r\nchief.  His purpose was to fire at the first hostile movement, hoping\r\nthat on the fall of their leader the Indians, fancying that they had got\r\ninto a trap, would take to flight.  At length the Dakotahs' leader\r\nadvanced a few steps.  He little thought that the lifting his hand with\r\na menacing gesture might cost him his life.  \"Stranger, with you we\r\nwould gladly smoke the pipe of peace,\" he began; \"but your ways are not\r\nour ways, or your notions our notions--we have nothing in common.  Go as\r\nyou came, we wish to have no communication with you.  We desire not to\r\ndesert our fathers' ways as you have done; yet, undoubtedly, the Spirit\r\nyou serve will protect you--go--go--go.\"  In vain Peter entreated the\r\nsavages to hear him once again, assuring them that he would tell them\r\nonly what was for their good.  One by one they quitted the spot where\r\nthe council had been held; the first walked off with becoming dignity,\r\nbut as more departed, the pace of each in succession increased, till the\r\nlast scampered off almost as fast as his legs would carry him, fearful\r\nlest he should be overtaken by the strange medicine man, whose supposed\r\nincantations he dreaded.  Peter was less astonished than a white man\r\nwould have been at the behaviour of his countrymen.  Still, he had\r\ngained an unexpected triumph.  The Dakotahs did not stop, even to look\r\nbehind them, but continued their course towards the west, through the\r\nwood and across the prairie, till they were lost to sight in the\r\ndistance.  The old hunter, to his surprise, saw Peter fall on his knees,\r\non the spot where he had been standing, to return thanks to Heaven for\r\nhis deliverance from a danger, far greater than it might appear to those\r\nunacquainted with Indian customs; for seldom or never do two parties of\r\nthe Dakotahs and Ojibways encounter each other, without the stronger\r\nendeavouring to destroy the weaker with the most remorseless cruelty.\r\nMercy is never asked for nor expected.  The scalping-knife is employed\r\non the yet living victim, should the tomahawk have left its work\r\nunfinished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are a wonderful man, friend Peter,\" exclaimed Robert Nixon,\r\nwhen the Indian returned to him and narrated what had occurred; \"I never\r\nyet have seen the like of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The reason is simply this, father, most men trust to their own strength\r\nand wisdom, and fail.  I go forth in the strength of One all-powerful,\r\nand seek for guidance from One all-wise,\" answered the Indian humbly.\r\n\"It is thus I succeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's curious what you say, friend Redskin,\" answered the old man in a\r\npuzzled tone; \"it's beyond my understanding, that's a fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"The time will come shortly, I hope, father, when you will see the truth\r\nof what I say.  But we must no longer delay here, we should be moving\r\non.\"  The mustang was caught and saddled, the old hunter placed on it,\r\nand once more the two travellers were on their way eastward, or rather\r\nto the north-east, for that was the general direction of their course.\r\nThey were compelled, however, to diverge considerably, in order to keep\r\nalong the course of streams, where many important advantages could be\r\nobtained: water, wood for firing, shelter, and a greater supply of game.\r\nOn the open prairie there was no want of deer of several descriptions,\r\nand of small animals, like rabbits or hares; but, unless by leaving the\r\nhorse with his burthen, the Indian could seldom get near enough to shoot\r\nthem.  For some distance the open country was of a sterile and arid\r\ndescription, but as they got farther away from the United States border\r\nit greatly improved, and a well-watered region, with rich grass and\r\nvetches, was entered, which extended north, and east, and west, in every\r\ndirection, capable of supporting hundreds and thousands of flocks and\r\nherds, for the use of man, although now roamed over only by a\r\ncomparatively few wild buffalo, deer, and wolves, and bears.  Although\r\nthey were in British territory, the arm of British law did not extend\r\nover this wild region, and Peter, therefore, kept a constant look-out to\r\nascertain that no lurking enemies were near at hand.  When he camped at\r\nnight, also, he selected the most sheltered spot he could find, and\r\nconcealed his companion and himself amid some thicket or rock, where any\r\ncasual passer-by would not be likely to discover them.\r\n\r\n\"At first, as Peter watched his companion, he thought that he would\r\nscarcely reach a place of safety where he might die in peace among\r\ncivilised men, but gradually the old hunter's strength returned, and\r\neach day, as he travelled on, his health seemed to improve.  He also\r\nbecame more inclined to talk; not only to ask questions, but to speak of\r\nhimself.  Religious subjects, however, he avoided as much as possible;\r\nindeed, to human judgment, his mind appeared too darkened, and his heart\r\ntoo hardened, to enable him to comprehend even the simplest truths.\r\n\"You'd like to know something about me, friend Redskin, I've no doubt,\"\r\nsaid the old man to Peter, when one day he had got into a more than\r\nusually loquacious mood.  \"It's strange, but it's a fact, I've a desire\r\nto talk about my early days, and yet, for forty years or more, maybe,\r\nI've never thought of them, much less spoken about them.  I was raised\r\nin the old country--that's where most of the pale-faces you see\r\nhereabouts came from.  My father employed a great many men, and so I may\r\nsay he was a chief; he was a farmer of the old style, and hated anything\r\nnew.  He didn't hold education in any great esteem, and so he took no\r\npains to give me any, and one thing I may say, I took no pains to obtain\r\nit.  My mother, of that I am certain, was a kind, good woman, and did\r\nher best to instruct me.  She taught me to sing little songs, and night\r\nand morning made me kneel down, with my hands put together, and say over\r\nsome words which I then though! very good--and I am sure they were, as\r\nshe taught me them; but I have long, long ago forgotten what they were.\r\nShe also used to take me with her to a large, large house, where there\r\nwere a great number of people singing and often talking together; and\r\nthen there was one man in a black dress, who got up in a high place in\r\nthe middle, and had all the talk to himself for a long time, I used to\r\nthink; but I didn't mind that, as I used generally to go to sleep when\r\nhe began, and only woke up when he had done.\r\n\r\n\"I was very happy whenever I was with my mother, but I didn't see her\r\nfor some days, and then they took me into the room where she slept, and\r\nthere I saw her lying on a bed; but she didn't speak me, she didn't even\r\nlook at me, for her eyes were closed, and her cheek was cold--very cold.\r\nI didn't know then what had happened, though I cried very much.  I\r\nnever saw her again.  From that time I began to be very miserable; I\r\ndon't know why; I think it was not having my mother to go to and talk\r\nto.  After that I don't know exactly what happened to me; for some time\r\nI got scolded, and kicked, and beaten, and then I was sent to a place\r\nwhere there were a good many other boys; and, thinks I to myself, I\r\nshall be happier here; but instead of that I was much more beaten and\r\nscolded, till I got a feeling that I didn't care what I did, or what\r\nbecame of me.  That feeling never left me.  I was always ready to do\r\nanything proposed by other boys, such as robbing orchards, or playing\r\nall sorts of pranks.  I now and then went home to see my father; but I\r\nremember very little about him, except that he was a stout man, with a\r\nruddy countenance.  If he did not scold me and beat me, he certainly did\r\nnot say much to me; I never felt towards him as I had done towards my\r\nmother.  I must have been a biggish boy, though I was still nearly at\r\nthe bottom of the school, when another lad and I got into some scrape,\r\nand were to be flogged.  He proposed that we should run away, and I at\r\nonce agreed, without considering where we should run to, or what we\r\nshould gain by our run.  There is a saying among the pale-faces, `out of\r\nthe frying pan into the fire.'  We soon found that we had got into a\r\nvery hot fire.  After many days' running, sleeping under hedges and in\r\nbarns, and living on turnips and crusts of bread, which we bought with\r\nthe few pence we had in our pockets, we reached a sea-port town.  Seeing\r\na large ship about to sail, we agreed that we would be sailors, if any\r\none would take us.  We were very hungry and hadn't a coin left to buy\r\nfood, so aboard we went.  The ship was just sailing,--the cook's boy had\r\nrun away and the captain's cabin boy had just died,--and so we were\r\nshipped, without a question being asked, to take their places.  They\r\ndidn't inquire our names, but called us Bill and Tom, which were the\r\nnames of the other boys.  The captain took me into his service, and\r\ncalled me Bill, and my companion, who fell to the cook, was called Tom.\r\nI don't know which was the most miserable.  Tom had the dirtiest and\r\nhardest work, and was not only the cook's but everybody else's servant.\r\nI received the most kicks and thrashings, and had the largest amount of\r\noaths and curses showered down on my head.  We were both of us very ill,\r\nbut our masters didn't care for that, and kicked us up to work whenever\r\nthey found us lying down.  Away we sailed; we thought that we should\r\nnever come to land again.  I didn't know where we were going, but I\r\nfound we were steering towards the south and west.  Week after week I\r\nsaw a wild, high headland on our right hand, and then we had mist, and\r\nsnow, and heavy weather, and were well nigh driven back; but at last we\r\nwere steering north, and the weather became fine and pleasant.  The ship\r\nput into many strange ports; some were in this big country of America,\r\nand some were in islands, so we heard; but neither Tom nor I was ever\r\nfor one moment allowed to set foot on shore.\r\n\r\n\"Often and often did we bitterly repent our folly, and wish ourselves\r\nback home; but wishing was of no use.  We found that we were slaves\r\nwithout the possibility of escape.  Tom, who had more learning by a\r\ngreat deal than I had, said one day that he would go and appeal to the\r\nConsul,--I think he was called, a British officer at the port where we\r\nlay,--when the mate, who heard him, laughed, and told him, with an oath,\r\nthat he might go and complain to whomsoever he liked; but that both he\r\nand Bill had signed papers, and had no power to get away.  By this Tom\r\nknew that if we complained the captain would produce the papers signed\r\nby the other boys, and that we should be supposed to be them, and have\r\nno remedy.  Tom then proposed that we should play all sorts of pranks,\r\nand behave as badly as we could.  We tried the experiment, but we soon\r\nfound that we had made a mistake; for our masters beat and starved us\r\ntill we were glad to promise not again to do the same.  Our only hope\r\nwas that we should some day get a chance of running away; and, if it\r\nhadn't been for that, we should, I believe, have jumped overboard and\r\ndrowned ourselves.  Month after month passed by, the ship continued\r\ntrading from port to port in the Pacific Ocean,--as the big lake you've\r\nheard speak of, friend Redskin, is called,--over to the west there; but\r\nthe chance we looked for never came.  We then hoped that the ship would\r\nbe cast away, and that so we might be free of our tyrants.  If all had\r\nbeen drowned but ourselves we shouldn't have cared.  At last, after we'd\r\nbeen away three years or more, we heard that the ship was going home.\r\nWe didn't conceal our pleasure.  It didn't last long.  Another captain\r\ncame on board one day.  I heard our captain observe to him, `You shall\r\nhave them both a bargain.  Thrash them well, and I'll warrant you'll get\r\nwork out of them.'  I didn't know what he meant at the time.  In the\r\nevening, when the strange captain's boat was called away, Tom and I were\r\nordered to get up our bags and jump in.  We refused, and said we wanted\r\nto go home.  We had better have kept silence.  Down came a shower of\r\nblows on our shoulders, and, amid the jeers and laughter of our\r\nshipmates, we were forced into the boat.  We found ourselves aboard a\r\nwhaler just come out, with the prospect of remaining in those parts\r\nthree years at least.  You've heard speak, Peter, of the mighty fish of\r\nthe big lake.  The largest sturgeon you ever set eyes on is nothing to\r\nthem--just a chipmunk to a buffalo.  We had harder and dirtier work now\r\nthan before--catching, cutting out, and boiling down the huge whales--\r\nand our masters were still more cruel and brutal.  We were beaten and\r\nknocked about worse than ever, and often well nigh starved by having our\r\nrations taken from us.  How we managed to live through that time I don't\r\nknow.  I scarcely like to think of it.  The ship sailed about in every\r\ndirection; sometimes where the sun was so hot that we could scarce bear\r\nour clothes on our backs, and sometimes amid floating mountains of ice,\r\nwith snow and sleet beating down on us.  At last, when we had got our\r\nship nearly full of oil, and it was said that we should soon go home, we\r\nput into a port, on the west coast of this continent, to obtain fresh\r\nprovisions.  There were a few white people settled there, but most of\r\nthe inhabitants were redskins.  The white men had farms, ranchos they\r\nwere called, and the natives worked for them.\r\n\r\n\"Tom and I agreed that, as the ship was soon going home, the captain\r\nwould probably try to play off the same trick on us that our first\r\ncaptain had done, and so we determined to be beforehand with him.  We\r\nwere now big, strongish fellows; not as strong as we might have been if\r\nwe had been better fed and less knocked about; but still we thought that\r\nwe could take good care of ourselves.  We hadn't much sense though, or\r\nknowledge of what people on shore do; for how should we, when you see\r\nthat since the day we left our native country, when we were little\r\nignorant chaps, we hadn't once set our feet on dry land.  Tom swore, and\r\nso did I, that if we once did reach the shore, we'd get away as far from\r\nthe ocean as we could, and never again smell a breath of it as long as\r\nwe lived.  How to get there was the difficulty.  We had always before\r\nbeen watched; and so, to throw our shipmates off their guard, we\r\npretended to think of nothing but about going home, and our talk was all\r\nof what we would do when we got back to old England.  We said that we\r\nwere very much afraid of the savages on shore, and wondered any one\r\ncould like to go among them.  After a time, we found that we were no\r\nlonger watched as we used to be.  This gave us confidence.  The next\r\nthing was to arrange how we were to get on shore.  We neither of us\r\ncould swim; and, besides, the distance was considerable, and there were\r\nsharks--fish which can bite a man's leg off as easily as a white fish\r\nbites a worm in two.  We observed that, in the cool of the evening, some\r\nboats and canoes used to pull round the ship, and sometimes came\r\nalongside to offer things for sale to the men.  Tom and I agreed that if\r\nwe could jump into one of them while the owner was on board, we might\r\nget off without being discovered.  Night after night we waited, till our\r\nhearts sunk within us, thinking we should never succeed; but, the very\r\nnight before the ship was to sail, several people came below, and, while\r\nthey were chaffering with the men, Tom and I slipped up on deck.  My\r\nheart seemed ready to jump out of my skin with anxiety as I looked over\r\nthe side.  There, under the fore-chains, was a canoe with a few things\r\nin her, but no person.  I glanced round.  The second mate was the only\r\nman on deck besides Tom, who had gone over to the other side.  I\r\nbeckoned to Tom.  The mate had his back to us, being busily engaged in\r\nsome work or other, over which he was bending.  Tom sprang over to me,\r\nand together we slid down into the canoe.  The ship swung with her head\r\ntowards the shore, or the mate would have seen us.  We pulled as for our\r\nlives; not, however, for the usual landing-place, but for a little bay\r\non one side, where it appeared that we could easily get on shore.  Every\r\nmoment we expected to see a boat put off from the ship to pursue us, or\r\na gun fired; but the sun had set, and it was growing darker and darker,\r\nand that gave us some hope.  Still we could be seen clearly enough from\r\nthe ship if anybody was looking for us.  The mate had a pair of sharp\r\neyes.  `He'll flay us alive if he catches us,' said I.  `Never,'\r\nanswered Tom, in a low tone; `I'll jump overboard and be drowned\r\nwhenever I see a boat make chase after us.'  `Don't do that, Tom,' said\r\nI; `hold on to the last.  They can but kill us in the end, and we don't\r\nknow what may happen to give us a chance of escape.'  You see, friend\r\nPeter, that has been my maxim ever since, and I've learned to know for\r\ncertain that that is the right thing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, before long we did see a boat leave the ship.  It was too dark to\r\nlearn who had gone over the side into her.  We pulled for dear life for\r\na few seconds, when Tom cried out that he knew we should be taken.  I\r\ntold him to lie down in the bottom of the canoe, and that if the ship's\r\nboat came near us I would strip off my shirt and pretend to be an Injun.\r\nAt first he wouldn't consent; but, as the boat came on, some muskets\r\nwere fired, and suddenly he said he'd do as I proposed, and he lay down,\r\nand I stripped off my shirt and smoothed down, my hair, which was as\r\nlong as an Injun's.  On came the boat; I pulled coolly on as if in no\r\nway concerned.  The boat came on--she neared us.  Now or never, I\r\nthought; so I sang out, in a feigned voice, and pointed with my paddle\r\ntowards the other side of the harbour.  I don't think I ever felt as I\r\ndid at that moment.  Did they know me? or should I deceive them?  If the\r\nmate was there I knew that we should have no chance.  The people in the\r\nboat ceased pulling.  I didn't move either, though the canoe, with the\r\nlast stroke I had given, slid on.  Again I pointed with my paddle, gave\r\na flourish with it, and away I went as if I had no business with them.\r\nI could not understand how I had so easily deceived my shipmates, and\r\nevery instant I expected them to be after us.  At last we lost sight of\r\nthem in the gloom; but Tom, even then, was unwilling to get up and take\r\nhis paddle.  I told him that, if he didn't, we should have a greater\r\nchance of being caught.  The moment I said that, up he jumped, and\r\npaddled away so hard that I could scarcely keep the canoe in the right\r\ncourse for the place where we wanted to land.  The stars helped us with\r\ntheir light; and, as we got close in with the shore, we found the mouth\r\nof a stream.\r\n\r\n\"Though we had so longed to get on shore we felt afraid to land, not\r\nknowing what we should do with ourselves.  The shore looked so strange,\r\nand we expected to see all sorts of wild animals and snakes which we had\r\nheard talk of.  Tom was the most timid, `It was bad aboard, Bill,' said\r\nhe, `but if we was to meet a bear or a buffalo what what should we do?'\r\nI couldn't just answer him; but when we found the river we agreed that\r\nwe would pull up it as far as we could go, and it would carry us some\r\nway into the country at all events.  We little knew the size of this\r\nmighty land, or of the big, long, long rivers running for hundreds of\r\nmiles through it.  This America of yours is a wonderful country, friend\r\nRedskin, if you did but know it.  Well, up the river we pulled for some\r\nmiles; it was but a mere brook, you'll understand, but we thought it a\r\ngreat river.  It was silent enough, for there were no habitations except\r\na few native wigwams.  We had all the night before us, that was one\r\nthing in our favour.  As on we went we heard a roaring, splashing noise,\r\nwhich increased.  `Hillo! here's a heavy sea got up; I see it\r\nright-a-head,' cried Tom.  `We must go through it, however,' said I; and\r\nso I tried to paddle the canoe through it.  We very nearly got swamped;\r\nit was, you see, a waterfall and rapid, and higher up even our canoe\r\ncould not have floated.  We now agreed that go on shore we must, like it\r\nor not; I stepped out first, and then helped Tom, or in his fright he\r\nwould have capsized the canoe.  There we were both of us on firm ground\r\nfor the first time since, as little boys, we left old England.  I did\r\nfeel strange, and when I tried to walk, I could scarcely get along.\r\n\r\n\"Tom rolled about as if he was drunk, hardly able to keep his feet.  The\r\nrough ground hurt us, and we were every instant knocking our toes and\r\nshins against stumps and fallen branches.  We both of us sat down ready\r\nto cry.  `How shall we ever get along?' asked Tom.  `We shall get\r\naccustomed to it,' I answered; `but it does make me feel very queer.'\r\nWe found a good supply of provisions in the canoe, and we loaded\r\nourselves with as much as we could carry, and we then had the sense to\r\nlift our canoe out of the water, and to carry her some way till we found\r\na thick bush in which we hid her.  `If they find out we got away in the\r\ncanoe they'll think we are drowned, and not take the trouble to look for\r\nus,' observed Tom, as we turned our backs on the spot.  We were pretty\r\nheavily laden, for we didn't know where we might next find any food; and\r\nas we walked on we hurt our feet more and more, till Tom roared out with\r\npain, and declared he would go no further.  `Then we shall be caught and\r\nflayed alive, that's all, Tom,' said I.  `But let us see if we can't\r\nmend matters; here, let us cut off the sleeves of our jackets and bind\r\nthem round our feet.'  We did so, and when we again set off we found\r\nthat we could walk much better than before.  We hadn't been so many\r\nyears at sea without learning how go steer by the stars.  What we wanted\r\nwas to get to the east; as far from the sea and our hated ship as\r\npossible: that one thought urged us on.  Through brushwood which tore\r\nour scanty clothes to shreds, and over rough rocks which wounded our\r\nfeet, and across marshes and streams which wetted us well nigh from head\r\nto foot, we pushed our way for some hours--it seemed to us the whole\r\nnight--till we got into an Indian track.  We didn't know what it was at\r\nthe time, but found it was an easy path, so we followed it up at full\r\nspeed.  On we ran; we found that it led in the right direction, and\r\nthat's all we thought of.  Unaccustomed to running or walking as we\r\nwere, it seems surprising how we should have held out; but the truth is\r\nit was fear helped us along, and a burning desire to be free.\r\n\r\n\"Daylight found us struggling up a high hill or ridge, rather running\r\nnorth and south; we reached the top just as the sun rose above a line of\r\nlofty and distant mountains.  We turned round for a moment to look on\r\nthe far-off blue waters which lay stretched out below us, and on which\r\nwe had spent so large a portion of our existence.  `I've had enough of\r\nit,' cried Tom, fiercely shaking his fist; and then we turned along\r\nagain, and rushed down the ridge towards the east.  It was the last\r\nglimpse I ever had of the wide ocean.  Still we did not consider\r\nourselves safe.  We should have liked to have put a dozen such ridges\r\nbetween our tyrants and ourselves.  On we went again till at last our\r\nexhausted strength failed, and we stopped to take some food.  Once\r\nhaving sat down it was no easy matter to get up again, and before we\r\nknew what was happening we were both fast asleep.  We must have slept a\r\ngood many hours, and I dreamed during that time that the mate, and cook,\r\nand a dozen seamen were following us with flensing-knives, and\r\nhandspikes, and knotted ropes, shrieking and shouting at our heels.  We\r\nran, and ran for our lives, just as we had been running all night, but\r\nthey were always close behind us.  The mate--oh! how I dreaded him--had\r\nhis hand on my shoulder, and was giving a growl of satisfaction at\r\nhaving caught me, when I awoke; and, looking up, saw not the mate, but\r\nthe most terrible-looking being I had ever set eyes on, so I thought.\r\n\r\n\"I had, to be sure, seen plenty of savages who came off to the ship from\r\nthe islands at which we used to touch, but they were none of them so\r\nfierce as he looked.  I won't describe him, because he was simply a\r\nredskin warrior in his war paint and feathers.  It was his hand that was\r\non my shoulder; his grunt of surprise at finding us awoke me.  I cried\r\nout, and Tom and I jumped to our feet and tried to run away; a dozen\r\nIndians however surrounded us, and escape was impossible.  `Let us put a\r\nbold face on the matter, Tom,' I sang out; `I don't think they mean to\r\nkill us.'  Our captors talked a little together and they seemed pleased\r\nwith the way we looked at them, for they showed us by signs that they\r\nmeant us no evil.  They were a portion of a war party on their way to\r\ndestroy the pale-face settlement on the coast.  They guessed by our\r\ndress and looks, and from our clothes being torn, that we were runaway\r\nEnglish seamen; and, knowing that we should not wish to go back to our\r\nship, considered that we should prove of more value to them alive than\r\nour scalps would be if they took them.  We understood them to say that\r\nthey wanted us to go with them to attack their enemies, but we showed\r\nthem by our feet that we could not walk a step, and as they were not\r\nill-tempered people they did not insist on it.  After a talk they lifted\r\nus up--two taking Tom, and two me between them--and carried us along at\r\na quick rate for some miles to their camp; there we saw a large number\r\nof Indians collected, some armed with bows, and some few with fire-arms.\r\n\r\n\"There were a few women, in whose charge we were placed.  We could not\r\nmake out whether we were considered prisoners or not; at all events, we\r\ncould not run away.  Leaving us, the whole party set forth towards the\r\nwest on their expedition.  Two days passed, and then, with loud\r\nshoutings, and shriekings, and firing of muskets, the party appeared,\r\nwith numerous scalps at the end of their spears, and some wretched\r\ncaptives driven before them, I remember, even now, how I felt that\r\nnight, when the war-dance was danced, and the prisoners tortured; how\r\nfearfully the men, and even the women, shrieked, and how the miserable\r\npeople who had been taken, as they were bound to stakes, writhed under\r\nthe tortures inflicted on them.  While we looked on, Tom and I wished\r\nourselves back again, even on board the ship, thinking that we ourselves\r\nmight next be treated in the same manner.  At last the savages brought\r\nfire, and then, as the flames blazed up, we saw three people whom we\r\nknew well,--the captain, and mate, and one of the men, who had been\r\namong the worst of our tyrants.  Though their faces were distorted with\r\nagony and horror, as the light fell on them, there was no doubt about\r\nthe matter.  They might have seen us.  If they did, it must have added\r\nto their misery.  They had come on shore to visit some of the settlers,\r\nwe concluded, and, at all events, were found fighting with them.  We got\r\naccustomed, after a time, to such scenes, and learned to think little of\r\nthem, as you doubtless do, friend Peter; but at that time, I went off in\r\na sort of swoon, as the shrieks and cries for mercy of the burning\r\nwretches reached my ears.  The Indians had got a great deal of booty,\r\nand having taken full revenge for the injury done them, and expecting\r\nthat they would be hunted out if they remained in the neighbourhood,\r\nthey judged it wise to remove to another part of the country.  Our feet\r\nhad sufficiently recovered during the rest of two days to enable us to\r\nwalk, or I am not certain that we should not have been killed, to save\r\nour captors the trouble of carrying us.  It took us a week to reach the\r\nmain camp, where most of the women and children were collected.  We\r\nlimped on, with difficulty and pain, thus far concealing our sufferings\r\nas much as we could.  We could not have gone a mile further, had not the\r\ntribe remained here to decide on their future course.  The rest, and the\r\ncare the women took of us, sufficiently restored our strength to enable\r\nus to move on with the tribe to the new ground they proposed taking up.\r\nYour Indian ways, friend Peter, were very strange to us at first, but by\r\ndegrees we got into them, and showed that we were every bit as good men\r\nas the chief braves themselves.  Whatever they did, we tried to do, and\r\nsucceeded as well as they, except in tracking an enemy, and that we\r\nnever could come up with.  They, at first, treated us as slaves, and\r\nmade us work for them, as they did their women; but when they saw what\r\nsort of lads we were, they began to treat us with respect, and soon\r\nlearned to look upon us as their equals.  We both of us became very\r\ndifferent to what we were at sea, Tom especially.  There we were cowed\r\nby our task-masters, here we felt ourselves free men; and Tom, who was\r\nlooked upon as an arrant coward on board ship, was now as brave as the\r\nbravest warrior of the tribe.  We were braver, indeed; for while they\r\nfought Indian-fashion, behind trees, we would rush on, and never failed\r\nto put our enemies to flight.\r\n\r\n\"We were of great service to our friends in assisting them to establish\r\nthemselves in their new territory, and to defend themselves against the\r\nnumerous foes whom they very soon contrived to make.  Still we held our\r\nown, and our friends increased in numbers and power.  Our chief was\r\nambitious, and used every means to add fresh members to his tribe, by\r\ninducing those belonging to other tribes to join us.  His object, which\r\nwas very clear, excited the jealousy of a powerful chief, especially, of\r\nthe great Dakotah nation, inhabiting the country north-east of our\r\nterritory.  He, however, disguised his intentions, and talked us into\r\nsecurity by pretending the greatest friendship.  Through his means, our\r\nother enemies ceased to attack us, and we began to think that the\r\nhatchet of war was buried for ever.  Tom and I had been offered wives--\r\ndaughters of chiefs--and we had agreed to take them to our lodges, when\r\nwe both of us set out on a hunting expedition, to procure game for our\r\nmarriage feast, and skins to pay for the articles we required.  We had\r\ngreat success, and were returning in high spirits, when night overtook\r\nus, within a short distance of the village.  We camped where we were, as\r\nwe would not travel in the dark, hoping to enter it the next morning in\r\ntriumph.  About midnight, both Tom and I started from our sleep, we knew\r\nnot why.  Through the night air there came faint sounds of cries, and\r\nshrieks, and shouts, and warlike noises.  We thought it must be fancy;\r\nbut presently, as we stood listening, there burst forth a bright light\r\nin the direction of the village, which went on increasing, till it\r\nseemed that every lodge must be on fire.  What could we do?  Should we\r\nhasten on to help our friends?  It was too late to render them any\r\nassistance.  We must wait till daylight to learn what way the foe had\r\ngone, and how we could best help our friends; so we stood watching the\r\nflames with grief and anger, till they sunk down for want of fuel.  We\r\nhad not lived so long with Indians, without having learned some of their\r\ncaution; and concealing our game and skins, as soon as it was dawn we\r\ncrept on towards the village.  As we drew near, not a sound was heard--\r\nnot even the bark of a dog.  We crept amid the bushes on hands and feet,\r\ncloser and closer, when from a wooded knoll we could look down on the\r\nlately happy village, or, I should say, on the spot where it lately\r\nstood.\r\n\r\n\"By the grey light of the morning a scene of desolation and bloodshed\r\nwas revealed to us, which, in all my experience of warfare, I have never\r\nseen equalled.  Every lodge was burnt to the ground; here and there a\r\nfew blackened posts alone remaining to show where they once stood: but a\r\nburnt village I have often seen.  It was the sight of the mangled and\r\nblackened bodies of our late friends and companions thickly strewed over\r\nthe ground which froze the blood in our veins.  For some moments we\r\ncould scarcely find breath to whisper to each other.  When we did, we\r\nreckoned up the members of the tribe, men, women, and children, and then\r\ncounting the bodies on the ground, we found that our foes had killed\r\nevery one of them, with the exception of perhaps a dozen, who might have\r\nbeen carried off.  This told us, too correctly, how the event had\r\noccurred.  In the dead of night the village had been surrounded, torches\r\nthrown into it, and, as the people rushed out confused, they were\r\nmurdered indiscriminately--old and young, women and children.  Were our\r\nintended wives among them? we almost wished they were; but we dared not\r\ndescend to ascertain.  The place was no longer for us.  `I wish that I\r\nwas back in England, Tom,' said I.  `So do I, Bill, right heartily,'\r\nsaid he.  `East or west, Tom?' said I.  `Not west! no, no!' he answered,\r\nwith a shudder; `we might be caught by another whaler.'  `East, then,'\r\nsaid I, pointing to the rising sun; `we may get there some day, but it's\r\na long way, I've a notion.'  `If we keep moving on, we shall get there\r\nthough, long as it may be,' said Tom.  So we crept back to where we had\r\nleft our goods, and having taken food for a couple of days, we went and\r\nhid ourselves in some thick bushes, where we hoped our enemies would not\r\nfind us.  For two days and nights we lay hid, and on the third morning\r\nwe agreed that we might as well chance it as stay where we were, when\r\nthe sound of voices, and of people moving through the woods reached our\r\nears, and, peeping out, we saw several warriors passing along at no\r\ngreat distance.  From the way they moved we knew that they were not\r\nlooking for any one, nor believing that any enemy was near; but still,\r\nshould any one of their quick eyes fall on our trail, they would\r\ndiscover us in an instant.  I never felt my scalp sit more uneasy on my\r\nhead.  Suddenly they stopped and looked about; I thought that it was all\r\nover with us; the keen eyes of one of them, especially, seemed to pierce\r\nthrough the very thicket where we lay.  We scarcely dared to breathe,\r\nlest we should betray ourselves.  Had there been only five or six we\r\nmight have sprung out and attacked them with some chance of success, but\r\nthere were a score at least, and more might be following, and so the\r\nodds were too great.  They were most of them adorned with scalps--those\r\nof our slaughtered friends, we did not doubt, and we longed to be\r\navenged on them.  On they came, and just as we thought that we had seen\r\nthe end of them, more appeared, and several of them looked towards us.\r\nHow we escaped discovery I do not know.  Long after the last had passed\r\non into the forest we came out of our hiding-place, and gathering up all\r\nour property, prepared to commence our journey.  We pushed on as fast as\r\nour legs would carry us, every moment expecting to come upon some of our\r\nenemies, or to have them pouncing out upon us from among the trees or\r\nrocks.  All day we pushed on, almost without stopping, and for several\r\ndays resting only during the hours of darkness, till at last we hoped\r\nthat we had put a sufficient distance between our enemies and ourselves\r\nto escape an attack.  We now camped to catch more game, and to make\r\narrangements for our course.  We had got some little learning at school,\r\nthough most of it was forgotten; but we remembered enough to make us\r\nknow that England was to the north-east of us, and so we determined to\r\ntravel on in that direction.  I won't tell you now all about our\r\njourney.  We had not got far before we found the country so barren that\r\nwe were obliged to keep to the north, which brought us into the\r\nterritory owned by the Dakotah people.  We knew nothing of the way then,\r\nexcept from the accounts picked up over the camp fires of our former\r\nfriends, and we had managed hitherto to keep out of the way of all\r\nstrangers.  We were ignorant, too, of the great distance we were from\r\nEngland; and of another thing we were not aware, and that was of the\r\ncold of winter.  We were still travelling on, when the nights became so\r\ncold that we could scarcely keep ourselves from freezing, though\r\nsleeping close to our camp fires.  It got colder and colder, and then\r\ndown came the snow, and we found that winter had really set in.  To\r\ntravel on was impossible, so we built ourselves a lodge, and tried to\r\ntrap and kill animals enough to last us for food till the snow should\r\ndisappear.  They became, however, scarcer and scarcer, and we began to\r\nfear that the supply of food we had collected would not last us out till\r\nsummer.  We had, however, a good number of skins, and though we had\r\nintended to sell them, we made some warm clothing of them instead.\r\n\r\n\"We had too much to do during the day in hunting and collecting wood for\r\nour fire to allow of the time hanging very heavy on our hands.  At first\r\nwe got on very well, but our food decreased faster than we had\r\ncalculated; and then Tom fell down from a rock, and hurt himself so much\r\nthat I could scarcely get him home.  While he was in this state I fell\r\nsick, and there we two were, in the middle of a desert, without any one\r\nto help us.  Tom grew worse, and I could just crawl out from our bed of\r\nskins and leaves to heap up wood on our fire, and to cook our food.\r\nThat was growing less and less every day, and starvation stared us in\r\nthe face.  Our wood, too could not hold out much longer, and though\r\nthere was plenty at a little distance, I was too weak to go out and\r\nfetch it and cut it up, and poor Tom could not even stand upright.  Day\r\nby day our stock of food decreased.  All was gone!  There was wood\r\nenough to keep our fire alight another day, and then we knew that in\r\none, or, at most, two days more, we must be starved or frozen to death.\r\nTom groaned out that he wished we had but a bottle of rum to keep us\r\nwarm, and drive away dreadful thoughts.  So did I wish we had.  That was\r\na hard time, friend Peter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire water! was that all you thought of?  Did you never pray?  Did you\r\nnever ask God to deliver you?\" inquired the Indian in a tone of\r\nastonishment.  \"No!  What had God to do with us poor chaps in that\r\nout-of-the-way place?  He wouldn't have heard us if we had prayed; and,\r\nbesides, we had long ago forgotten to pray,\" answered the old man in an\r\nunconcerned tone.  \"Ah! but He would have heard you, depend on that.\r\nThe poor and destitute are the very people He delights to help,\"\r\nobserved the Indian.  \"Ah! old friend, you little know what God is when\r\nyou fancy that He would not have heard you.\"  As he spoke he produced a\r\nTestament in the Ojibway tongue, from which he read the words, \"God is\r\nlove,\" and added, \"This is part of the Bible, which your countrymen, the\r\nmissionaries, have translated for us into our tongue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay! maybe,\" remarked the old man, after considering a time; \"I remember\r\nabout the Bible when I was a boy, and it's all true; but I don't fancy\r\nGod could have cared for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? is that wisdom you speak, old friend?\" exclaimed Peter.  \"See, God\r\ndid care for you, though you did not even ask Him, or you wouldn't be\r\nalive this day.  He has cared for you all your life long.  You have\r\nalready told me many things which showed it, and I doubt not if you were\r\nto tell me everything that has happened to you since you can remember up\r\nto the present day, many, many more would be found to prove it.  Was it\r\nGod's love which sent me to you when you were on the point of death, or\r\nwas it His hatred?  Was it God's love which softened the hearts of the\r\nSioux towards us?  Come, go on with your history.  I doubt not that the\r\nvery next thing that you have to tell me will prove what I say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, friend Redskin, what you say may be true, and I don't wish to\r\ndiffer with you,\" answered the hunter, still apparently unmoved.  \"As I\r\nwas saying, Tom and I expected nothing but starvation.  It was coming,\r\ntoo, I have an idea; for my part I had got so bad that I did not know\r\nwhere we were or what had happened.  The hut was dark, for I had closed\r\nup the hole we came in and out at with snow and bundles of dry grass, or\r\nwe should very quickly have been frozen to death.\r\n\r\n\"The last thing I recollect was feeling cold--very cold.  Suddenly a\r\nstream of light burst in on my eyes, and, that waking me up, I saw\r\nseveral Indians, in full war-dress, standing looking at Tom and me.  I\r\nfelt as if I did not care whether they scalped me or not: I was pretty\r\nwell past all feeling.  One of them, however, poured something down my\r\nthroat, and then down Tom's throat: it did not seem stronger than water\r\nthough it revived me.  I then saw that their looks were kind, and that\r\nthey meant us no harm.  The truth was that our forlorn condition touched\r\ntheir hearts: it is my opinion, friend Peter, that nearly all men's\r\nhearts can be moved, if touched at the right time.  These men were\r\nSioux--very savage, I'll allow--but just then they were returning home\r\nfrom a great meeting, where, by means of a white man, certain matters\r\nwere settled to their satisfaction, and they felt, therefore, well\r\ndisposed towards us.  Who the white man was I don't know, except that he\r\nwas not a trader, and was a friend of the Indians.  The Sioux gave us\r\nfood, and lighted our fire, and camped there for two days, till we were\r\nable to move on, and then took us along with them.  We lived with them\r\nall the winter, and soon got into their ways.  When we proposed moving\r\non, they would, on no account, hear of it, telling us that the distance\r\nwas far greater than we supposed, and that there were cruel, treacherous\r\nwhite men between us and the sea, who were always making war on their\r\npeople to drive them off their lands, and that they would certainly kill\r\nus.  The long and the short of it is that Tom and I gave up our\r\nintention of proceeding, and, having wives offered to us much to our\r\ntaste, we concluded to stay where we were.  Every day we got more\r\naccustomed to the habits of our new friends; and we agreed also, that\r\nour friends in England would not know us, or own us, if we went back.\r\nWe were tolerably happy; our wives bore us children; and, to make a long\r\nstory short, we have lived on with the same tribe ever since.  Tom has\r\ngrown stout and cannot join in the hunt, but his sons do, and supply him\r\nwith food.  If Tom had been with the rest, he would not have left the\r\nneighbourhood of the ground where I fell without searching for me.  It\r\nis through he and I being together that I can still speak English, and\r\nrecollect things about home and our early days.  We have been friends\r\never since we were boys, and never have we had a dispute.  Four of my\r\nchildren died in infancy, and I have a son and a daughter.  The only\r\nthing that tries me is leaving Tom and them, for their mother is dead;\r\nand yet I should like to go and hear more of the strange things you have\r\ntold me about, and see some of my countrymen again before I die.  They\r\nwon't mourn long for the old man: it is the lot of many to fall down and\r\ndie in the wilds, as I should have died if you had not found me.  Tom,\r\nmaybe, will miss me; but of late years, since he gave up hunting, we\r\nhave often been separate, and he'll only feel as if I had been on a\r\nlonger hunt than usual.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your children?\" said Peter.  \"They'll feel much like Tom, I\r\nsuppose,\" answered the white hunter.  \"You know, friend Redskin, that\r\nInjun children are not apt to care much for their old parents.  Maybe I\r\nwill send for them, or go for them, if I remain with the pale-faces.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian was silent for some time.  He then observed gravely, \"Maybe,\r\nold friend, that the merciful God, who has protected you throughout your\r\nlife, may have ordered this event also for your benefit; yet why do I\r\nsay `maybe.'  He orders all things for the best: this much I have\r\nlearned respecting Him--the wisest man can know no more.\"\r\n\r\nWere not the Indians of North America indued with a large amount of\r\npatience they could not get through the long journeys they often\r\nperform, nor live the life of trappers and hunters, nor execute the\r\ncurious carved work which they produce.  Patience is a virtue they\r\npossess in a wonderful degree.  Day after day Peter travelled on,\r\nslowly, yet patiently, with his charge, at length reaching the banks of\r\nthe Assiniboine River, a large and rapid stream which empties itself\r\ninto the Red River, at about the centre of the Selkirk settlement.  The\r\nbanks, often picturesque, were, in most places, well clothed with a\r\nvariety of trees, while the land on either side, although still in a\r\nstate of nature, showed its fertility by the rich grasses and clover\r\nwhich covered it.  The old hunter gazed with surprise.  \"Why, friend\r\nPeter, here thousands and thousands of people might live in plenty, with\r\ncountless numbers of cattle and sheep!\" he exclaimed.  \"I knew not that\r\nsuch a country existed in tiny part of this region.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are now on the territory of the English, a people who treat the red\r\nman as they should--as fellow men, and with justice,\" answered the\r\nIndian.  \"It may be God's will that, ere many years are over, all this\r\nvast land, east and west, may be peopled by them, still leaving ample\r\nroom for the red men, who, no longer heathen hunters, may settle down in\r\nChristian communities as cultivators of the soil, or keepers of flocks\r\nand herds.\"\r\n\r\nStill more surprised was the old hunter when, a few days after this,\r\nthey came upon several well cultivated fields, and saw beyond them a\r\nwidely-scattered village of neat cottages, and the spire of a church\r\nrising amid them towards the blue sky.  \"What! are those the houses of\r\nEnglish settlers?\" asked the old man; \"it will do my heart good to see\r\nsome of my own countrymen again.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will see few of your countrymen here, father; the inhabitants are\r\nsettlers, truly, but nearly all my people.  There is, however, here a\r\ngood minister, and a school-master, white men, who will welcome you\r\ngladly.  Their hearts are full of Christian love, or they would not come\r\nto live out here, far removed from relatives and friends, labouring for\r\nthe souls' welfare of my poor countrymen.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head, \"No, no; I have no desire to see a parson.\r\nI remember well the long sermons--the last I ever heard was when I was\r\nat school--the parson used to give, and I used to declare that when I\r\nwas a man I would keep clear of them, on this account.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would not speak so of our minister here, were you to hear him,\"\r\nsaid the Indian.  \"I will not ask you to do what you dislike--but here\r\nis my house--those within will give you a hearty welcome.\"  An Indian\r\nwoman, neatly dressed, with a bright, intelligent countenance, came\r\nforth with an infant in her arms, to meet Peter, several children\r\nfollowing her, who clung around him with affectionate glee.  A few\r\nwords, which Peter addressed to his wife, made her come forward, and,\r\nwith gentle kindness, assist the old man into the cottage, where the\r\nelder children eagerly brought a chair and placed him on it.  One boy\r\nran off with the horse to a stable close at hand, and another assisted\r\nhis mother to prepare some food, and to place it on a table before his\r\nfather and their guest.\r\n\r\nThe old man's countenance exhibited pleased surprise.  \"Well! well!  I\r\nshouldn't have believed it if I had heard it,\" he muttered.  \"I remember\r\nmany a cottage in the old country that did not come up to this.\"  Many\r\nand many a cottage very far behind it, the old hunter might have said--\r\nand why?  Because in them the blessed Gospel was not the rule of life;\r\nwhile in that of the Indian God's law of love was the governing\r\nprinciple of all.  Christ's promised gift--the gift of gifts--rested on\r\nthat humble abode of His faithful followers.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed by, and, to Peter's regret, the old hunter showed no\r\ndesire to converse with the devoted missionary minister of the\r\nsettlement.  He came more than once, but the old man, shut up within\r\nhimself, seemed not to listen to anything he said.  At length he\r\nrecovered sufficiently to go out, and one evening, wandering forth\r\nthrough the village, he passed near the church.  The sound of music\r\nreached his ears as he approached the sacred edifice; young voices are\r\nraised together in singing praises to God for His bounteous gifts\r\nbestowed on mankind:--\r\n\r\n  \"Glory to Thee, my God, this night,\r\n  For all the blessings of the light;\r\n  Keep me, O keep me, King of Kings!\r\n  Beneath Thine own Almighty wings.\"\r\n\r\nThe old hunter stopped to listen: slowly, and as if in awe, he draws\r\nnear the open porch.  Again he stops, listening still more earnestly.\r\nThe young Christians within are singing in the Indian tongue.  Closer he\r\ndraws--his lips open--his voice joins in the melody.  Words long, long\r\nforgotten, come unconsciously from his lips.  They are the English words\r\nof that time-honoured hymn, often sung by children in the old country.\r\nScarcely does his voice tremble: it sounds not like that of a man, but\r\nlow and hushed, as it might have been when he first learned, from his\r\nlong-lost mother, to lisp those words of praise.  The music ceases.  The\r\nold hunter bursts into tears--tears unchecked.  Now he sinks on his\r\nknees, with hands uplifted--\"Our Father, which art in Heaven,\"--he is\r\nfollowing the words of the missionary within.  Are a mother's earnest,\r\nceaseless prayers heard--prayers uttered ere she left this world of\r\ntrial?  Yes; undoubtedly.  But God's ways are not man's ways: though He\r\ntarry long, yet surely He will be found--aye, \"Found of them who sought\r\nHim not.\"\r\n\r\nThe children's prayer meeting is over.  The old man remains on his\r\nknees, with head bent down, and hands clasped, till the shades of\r\nevening close over him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nThat was the turning-point; from that day Rob Nixon was an altered man.\r\nOf course, I do not mean that he at once found all his difficulties\r\ngone, his heart full of love, his prayers full of devotion; but from\r\nthis time he felt, as he had never felt before, that he was \"blind, and\r\npoor, and naked,\" and far away from his home.  His good and faithful\r\nfriend, Peter, had given him wise and good advice, and had introduced\r\nhim to the excellent minister of the settlement, Archdeacon Hunter, who\r\nsoon became a daily visitor at Peter's cottage.\r\n\r\nSkilful in imparting religious knowledge, he was able, by slow degrees,\r\nto instruct the old hunter in the leading truths of Christianity.  Once\r\ncomprehended, the old man grasped them joyfully; and though long\r\nunaccustomed to the sight of a book, he set to work again to learn to\r\nread, that he might himself peruse the sacred volume.  He, of course,\r\nlearned in English, and it was curious to remark, how his countenance\r\nbeamed with pleasure as he recognised once familiar, but long forgotten,\r\nletters and words, and how rapidly he recovered the knowledge he had\r\npossessed as a boy.  His great delight was to attend the\r\nschool-children's service, and to hear them afterwards catechised by the\r\nminister; and the greyheaded, gaunt old man, might have been seen\r\nconstantly sitting among them, truly as a little child, imbibing the\r\ntruths of the Gospel.  But, after a time, a change came over him.  He\r\nappeared no longer content to remain, as hitherto, quietly in the\r\ncottage of his friend Peter, but spoke of wishing, once more, to be in\r\nthe saddle, following his calling of a hunter.  His rifle and\r\naccoutrements had carefully been brought home by Peter; but they would\r\nbe of no use without a horse, powder and shot, and provisions.  The\r\nautumn hunt, in which a large number of the natives of the Red River\r\nsettlement engage every year, was about to commence; and, to Peter's\r\nsurprise and regret, Rob Nixon expressed his intention of accompanying\r\nthem, should he be able to obtain the means of so doing.  Peter trembled\r\nlest his old friend's conversion should not have been real--lest the\r\nseed, which he had hoped would have borne good fruit, had, after all,\r\nbeen sown on stony ground.  He delicately expressed his fears,\r\ndescribing the temptations to which a hunter is exposed.  A tear\r\nappeared in the old man's eye, as he called Peter's eldest boy to him.\r\n\"Friend, you love this boy?\" he said.  \"I do, fondly,\" was the natural\r\nanswer.  \"And you love his soul?\" he asked.  \"Far more surely.  It is\r\nthe most precious part of him,\" said the Christian father.  \"I, too,\r\nhave a son, and I love him; but I knew that he could take good care of\r\nhimself, and so I left him with little regret,\" said the hunter.  \"But\r\nnow, friend, I know that he has a soul which is in danger of perishing,\r\nI long to seek him out, to tell him of his danger, to win him back to\r\nthat Saviour from whom he has strayed so far.  I have a daughter and a\r\nfriend too, and that friend has children.  To all I would show how they\r\nmay be saved.  I loved them once, thinking nothing of their souls.  How\r\nmuch more do I love their souls now that I know their value!\"  Peter\r\nwarmly grasped the old hunter's hand, as he exclaimed, \"Pardon me,\r\nfather, that I had hard thoughts of you.  I understand your object, and\r\nI doubt not that aid will be afforded you to carry it out, for it is\r\nsurely one well pleasing in God's sight.  `He who converteth a sinner\r\nfrom the error of his way, shall save a soul from death, and shall hide\r\na multitude of sins.'\"\r\n\r\nThe whole matter being laid before the missionary minister the next day,\r\nhe highly approved of the old hunter's intention, and promised to aid\r\nhim as far as he had the power.  He was on the point of setting out to\r\nvisit the settlements, as the Red River colony is called, and he invited\r\nRobert Nixon to accompany him, that he might there obtain the necessary\r\naid for the accomplishment of his enterprise.  It was agreed, in the\r\nfirst place, that the old man should not undertake the journey alone.\r\nThe difficulty was to find a companion for him.  Fortunately, two years\r\nbefore, a young Sioux had been taken prisoner by a party of Crees, a\r\nnumerous, people, who inhabit the country round Lake Winnepeg, their\r\nlodges being found far in other directions.  They, like the heathen\r\nOjibways, are always at war with the Sioux, and no opportunity is lost\r\nof taking each others' scalps.  This young Sioux, to whom the name of\r\nJoseph had been given, was anxious to carry the glad tidings of\r\nsalvation to his countrymen, and hearing of the old hunter's wish,\r\ngladly volunteered to accompany him.  Peter would willingly himself have\r\nbeen his companion, but that he had his duties as a teacher to attend\r\nto, and his family to care for; besides which, a Sioux would be able to\r\nenter the country of his people with less risk of being killed by them,\r\nthan would one of the Cree, or Ojibway nation.  Peter, however, insisted\r\non Nixon taking his horse.  \"You can repay me for the hire some day, or\r\nyour son can repay my children, should you bring him back.  If it is not\r\nGod's will that you should succeed in your mission, yet I fear not that\r\nHe will repay me, as the loan is for an object well pleasing in His\r\nsight.\"\r\n\r\nA horse for the young Sioux, as well as provisions and articles as gifts\r\nto propitiate any chiefs of tribes who might not know him, were still\r\nconsidered necessary, and these could only be procured at the Red River.\r\nThe distance between the little colony of Prairie Portage and Red River\r\nis about sixty-five miles, but this neither the old hunter nor his\r\ncompanions thought in any way a long journey.  The astonishment of\r\nRobert Nixon was very great on finding a well-beaten road the whole\r\ndistance, over which wheeled carriages could pass with perfect ease;\r\nstill more when he passed several farms, even to the west of Lane's\r\nPost, which formed the termination of their first day's journey.  Their\r\ncourse was in the same direction as that of the Assiniboine, which very\r\nwinding river they occasionally sighted.  The banks were generally well\r\nclothed with fine wood, and the soil everywhere appeared to be of the\r\nrichest quality.  Considerably greater than before was the old man's\r\nastonishment when, on the second day about noon, the party arrived at a\r\ncomfortable farm, where the owner hospitably invited them to rest, and\r\nplaced before them the usual luxuries to be found in a well-ordered\r\nfarm-house in the old country, such as good wheat and maize bread,\r\ncheese, butter, bacon and eggs, with capital beer, and in addition,\r\npreserves and fruit, several vegetables, and fresh maize boiled,\r\nanswering the purpose of green peas.  A joint of mutton was roasting at\r\nthe fire, and potatoes were boiling.  After this repast, the farmer\r\nbrought out a supply of tobacco which, he told his guests, grew on the\r\nfarm.  \"Indeed, gentlemen, I may say we here live in plenty,\" he\r\nobserved; \"and all we want are people to settle down about us, and make\r\nour lives more sociable than they now are.  We have drawbacks, I'll\r\nallow; and what farmer, even in the old country, can say that he has\r\nnot?  Ours are--early and late frosts, though chiefly the latter;\r\ngrasshoppers, which will clear a field of every green thing in a night;\r\nand, occasionally, wolves and bears; but those gentry don't like the\r\nsmell of our gunpowder, and have mostly taken their departure.  On the\r\nRed River farms they seldom or never hear of one, and the injury they\r\ncan do us is but slight.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the commencement of a long line of farms which extends, with\r\nfew breaks, the whole distance to the Red River, into which the\r\nAssiniboine falls.  Often the old hunter was silent, considering the\r\nunexpected scenes which met his sight, though he occasionally indulged\r\nin quiet remarks on them; but when, at length, the lofty and glittering\r\nspire of a large cathedral, [note] appearing, as the rays of the evening\r\nsun shone on it, as if formed of burnished silver--numerous edifices,\r\nsome of considerable dimensions, scattered about--public buildings and\r\ndwelling houses--other churches in the distance--several windmills, with\r\ntheir white arms moving in the breeze, high above the richly tinted\r\nfoliage of the trees, which formed an irregular fringe to the banks of\r\nthe river flowing beneath them, while near at hand, at the point where\r\nthe Assiniboine flows into the larger stream, rose the walls and\r\nbattlements of a strong fort, whose frowning guns commanded the\r\nsurrounding plains,--when he saw all this, the scene appeared to his\r\nbewildered eyes as if it had sprung up by the touch of the enchanter's\r\nwand, in the midst of the desert.  \"Well! well!\" he exclaimed, \"and I\r\nhave been living all this time, but a few weeks' journey from this\r\nplace, and never should have thought of it.\"  The sight of the large\r\nsails of the freighters' boats made him somewhat uncomfortable, lest he\r\nshould be carried off to sea, and he could scarcely be persuaded that he\r\nwas still not far short of two thousand miles from the Atlantic ocean,\r\nand that there was no chance of his being kidnapped.  He was even more\r\nfrightened than his steed when a steamer came puffing up to a wharf\r\nbelow Fort Garry.  \"What creature is that they have aboard there?\" he\r\nexclaimed, \"Where does the strange craft come from?  What is she going\r\nto do?\"  He sprang from his horse, and stood looking over the cliff at\r\nthe steamer.  He at once recognised her as a vessel, though of a\r\nconstruction wonderfully strange to his eyes, as no steamers had been\r\nbuilt when he left England, and he had never heard of their invention.\r\nThe stream of steam puffed off, and the loud screams accompanying it\r\nmade him somewhat incredulous as to the nature of the vessel.  When,\r\nhowever, all was quiet, and he saw a stream of people issuing from her\r\nside, he was satisfied that she was of mortal build, and he was at\r\nlength persuaded to go down and examine her himself.  It almost took\r\naway his breath, as he said, to find that vessels of far greater size\r\nnow ploughed the ocean in every direction, and that continents were\r\ntraversed by long lines of carriages, dragged by single locomotives, at\r\nthe rate of forty miles an hour.  After hearing of this, he was scarcely\r\nsurprised at any of the wonders which were told him, and of the numerous\r\ndiscoveries and inventions which have been brought into practical use\r\nduring half-a-century.  At the close of the day the travellers reached a\r\nwell-built rectory, on the banks of the river, where they were\r\nhospitably received and entertained.  While seated in the evening before\r\nthe fire with his host, the old man, as he looked round the room and\r\nobserved the various comforts which it contained, heaved a deep sigh.\r\n\"Ah!  I feel now how sadly I have thrown my life away,\" he exclaimed.\r\n\"I might, but for my early folly, have enjoyed all the comforts of\r\ncivilisation, and played my part as a civilised man, instead of living\r\nthe life of a savage among savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Friend,\" observed the minister, \"this is not the only life.  There is\r\nanother and a better--to last for ever.\r\n\r\n\"Then you have no desire to return to your former friends, the Sioux?\"\r\nthe minister continued, after a pause.  \"Ah! yes; but not for the\r\npleasure such a life as they lead could give me.  There is the friend of\r\nmy youth, and there are his children, and my children.  My great desire\r\nis to return to them to tell them that they have souls, and what the\r\nLord, in His loving kindness, has done for their souls.\"  The object of\r\nthe old hunter was no sooner known in the settlement than he obtained\r\nall the assistance he could require.  Few persons who had for so long\r\nled a savage life could have appreciated more fully than he now seemed\r\nto do the advantages of civilisation, and yet none of them could turn\r\nhim from his purpose.  Within five days he and his young Sioux\r\ncompanion, Joseph, were ready to set out.  They had a led-horse to carry\r\ntheir provisions and presents, and they had arms, though rather to\r\nenable them to kill game for their support than for the purpose of\r\nfighting.  \"I pray that our hands may be lifted up against no man's\r\nlife, even though we may be attacked by those who are what we ourselves\r\nwere but a short time back, and should still be, but for God's grace,\"\r\nsaid the old man, as he slung his rifle to his saddle-bow.  Once more\r\nRobert Nixon turned his back on the abodes of civilised men.  Had it not\r\nbeen for the object in view it would have been with a heavy heart.  \"If\r\nTom and I had remained at school, and laboured on steadily, we might\r\nhave been like one of those ministers of the Gospel, or settlers, and\r\nour children the same, instead of the young savages they now are,\r\nignorant of God and His holy laws.\"  Thus he mused as he rode along.  He\r\nand his young companion did not neglect the usual precautions, when they\r\ncamped at night, to avoid discovery by any wandering natives who might\r\nbe disposed to molest them.\r\n\r\nThe young Indian, though possessing much less religious knowledge than\r\nPeter, yet showed a sincere anxiety to fulfil his religious duties, and,\r\nwithout fail, a hymn was sung and prayer was offered up before starting\r\non their day's journey, and when they lay down on their beds of spruce,\r\nfir-twigs, or leaves, or dry grass, at night.\r\n\r\nThe travellers rode on day after day without encountering any material\r\nimpediments to their progress.  There were no rugged mountains to\r\nascend, no dense forests to penetrate, or wild defiles amid which they\r\nhad to find their way.  There were rivers and streams; but some were\r\neasily forded, across others they swam their horses, and passed their\r\nprovisions and goods on small rafts, which they towed behind them.\r\n\r\nLeaving British territory, and moving west, the country had a barren and\r\narid appearance.  In many districts sand predominated, with sand-hills\r\nof more or less elevation; in others grass, growing in tufts out of the\r\nparched-up, stony ground, was the only herbage.  Indeed, from north to\r\nsouth and east to west, for many hundred miles, there exists an extent\r\nof country, known as the Dakotah territory, unfitted, from the absence\r\nof water, to become the permanent abode of civilised man.  Here,\r\nhowever, at certain seasons, herds of buffalo find pasturage on their\r\nway to and from the more fertile regions of the north; and thus, with\r\nthe aid of fish, and other wild animals, and roots and berries,\r\nconsiderable tribes of the Dakotah nation find a precarious existence.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNote.  This cathedral belongs to the Roman Catholics, who have also a\r\nlarge convent near at hand.  They maintain a considerable number of\r\nMissionary Stations in different parts of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nIt was in the western portion of the Dakotah territory, described in the\r\nlast chapter, that a numerous band of the lords of the soil had pitched\r\ntheir skin tents by the side of a stream, whose grassy banks, fringed\r\nwith trees, contrasted strongly with the dry and hilly ground before\r\nmentioned, which, as far as the eye could reach, extended on either side\r\nof them.  Yet the scene was animated in the extreme.  In the centre of a\r\nwide basin, into which a valley opened from the distant prairie, was\r\nerected a high, circular enclosure of stakes, and boughs, and skins.\r\nThere was but one entrance towards the valley, and on either side of\r\nthis entrance commenced a row of young trees, or branches of trees, the\r\ndistance between each line becoming greater and greater the further off\r\nthey were from the enclosure.  The figure formed by the lines was\r\nexactly that of a straight road drawn in perspective on paper: being\r\nvery wide at one end, and narrowing gradually till it became only the\r\nwidth of the entrance to the enclosure at the other.  Between each of\r\nthe trees or bushes was stationed an Indian armed with bow or spear, and\r\nhaving a cloak, or a thick mass of branches in his hand.  Outside the\r\nenclosure were numerous persons, chiefly women and old men and boys, the\r\nlatter armed with bows and arrows, and the former having cloaks or\r\nboughs.  They were flitting to and fro, apparently waiting some event of\r\ninterest.  As the travellers reached the top of a hill overlooking the\r\nenclosure, a cloud of dust was seen approaching the further end.  \"There\r\nthey come, there they come!\" exclaimed the old hunter, with difficulty\r\nrefraining from dashing down the hill, as, at the instant, a herd of\r\nsome three or four hundred buffaloes burst, at headlong speed, from out\r\nof the dust--tossing their heads and tails, tearing up the earth with\r\ntheir horns, trampling, in their terror, over each other--followed\r\nclosely by a band of red-skinned huntsmen, with bow or spear in hand,\r\nmost of them free of clothing, and uttering the wildest cries and\r\nshouts, now galloping here, now there, as some fierce bull turned and\r\nstood at bay, sending an arrow into the front of one, dashing a spear\r\ninto the side of another, while they hung on the flanks of the herd,\r\nkeeping the animals, as nearly as possible, in the centre of the road.\r\nWhenever any of the herd approached the line of bushes on either side,\r\nthe Indians stationed there shook the cloaks or the boughs they held in\r\ntheir hands, and shouted and shrieked, thus effectually turning the\r\nbewildered animals into the main stream.  Sometimes the whole herd\r\nattempted to break through, but were turned with equal facility.  If\r\nthey attempted to stop, the hunters behind, closing in on them, urged\r\nthem on until, still more and more compressed, those in the interior of\r\nthe herd being utterly unable to see where they were going, they were\r\nforced, by redoubled shouts and shrieks in their rear, through the\r\nnarrow gateway into the enclosure.  Through it they dashed, a dark\r\nstream of wild, fierce heads and manes surging up and down, till the\r\nwhole were driven in, and the hunters themselves, leaping the bar across\r\nthe entrance, followed close in their rear.  Now, round and round the\r\nconfined pound, the affrighted creatures rushed, not discovering a\r\nsingle opening which might afford them a chance of escape, bellowing and\r\nroaring, the strong trampling on the young and weak, the calves soon\r\nfalling and being crushed to death; showers of arrows from the hunters'\r\nbows bringing many low, while others, wounded by the darts and spears of\r\nthe people outside, or gored by their fellows, sunk down exhausted from\r\nloss of blood.\r\n\r\nIt was truly a spectacle of wanton and barbarous slaughter, which none\r\nbut those accustomed to it could have watched unmoved.  Even Robert\r\nNixon, though he had often joined in similar scenes, regarded it with\r\nfeelings very different to what he would formerly have done.  \"Alas!\r\nalas! is it thus God's creatures are destroyed to no purpose by these\r\npoor savages?\" he exclaimed to his companion.  \"Not one-twentieth part\r\nof the meat can be consumed by them; and the lay will come when they\r\nwill seek for food and there will be none for them, and they themselves\r\nmust vanish away out of the land.\"  The two travellers had been moving\r\nalong the height above the valley, but so entirely engaged were the\r\nIndians in the work of entrapping the buffalo, that they were observed\r\nby no one.  They now descended towards the tents.  In front of one of\r\nthem sat a somewhat portly man, his countenance, and the hue of his\r\ncomplexion, rather than his costume, showing that he was of the white\r\nrace.  The tents were pitched on a spot sufficiently elevated above the\r\nvalley to enable him to watch all that was taking place within the\r\npound.  His attention also was so completely absorbed by the proceedings\r\nof his companions, that he did not perceive, for some time, the approach\r\nof the horsemen.  When he did, starting to his feet, and upsetting the\r\nthree-legged stool on which he was sitting, he exclaimed, \"What, old\r\nchum! is it you--you, indeed?  I made sure that what they told me was\r\ntrue, and that you were long, long ago food for the wolves.  Let me look\r\nat you.  I cannot yet believe my senses.\"  Rob Nixon having dismounted,\r\nthe two old men stood for some moments grasping each other's hands.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before old Tom could persuade himself that his friend\r\nwas really alive; not, indeed, till the latter had given a brief account\r\nof the way he had been found and rescued by the Indian, Peter, and the\r\nchief events which had occurred to him.  \"Well, well!  I'm right glad to\r\nget you back; and now you must give up hunting, as I have done, and just\r\ntake your ease for the rest of your days,\" said old Tom.  \"Hunting I\r\nhave done with; but I have yet much work to do before I die,\" answered\r\nthe old hunter.  \"You and I are great sinners; we were brought up in a\r\nChristian land, and still we have been living the lives of heathens.\r\nBut, Tom, since I have been away I have read the Bible; I have there\r\nlearned about Christ; and I see that we have been living lives as\r\ndifferent from His as black is from white, as light is from darkness.\r\nTom, would you like to learn about Him?\"  Tom signified his readiness\r\nwith a nod.  It was all Robert Nixon required, and he at once opened on\r\nthe subject of God's love, and man's sin, and Christ the Saviour from\r\nsin.  The young Indian stood by holding the horses, and watching the\r\ncountenances of the speakers.  It must have been a great trial for him\r\nto remain thus inactive while his countrymen were engaged in their\r\nexciting occupation; but a new rule of life had become his, and duty had\r\ntaken the place of inclination.  \"There, Tom; I've just said a little\r\nabout the chiefest thing I've got to say to you,\" were the words with\r\nwhich Rob wound up his address.  Tom looked puzzled, but not displeased,\r\nas some men might have been.\r\n\r\nHis friend was prevented from saying more by the loud shouts of the\r\nIndians as the last bull of a herd of nearly three hundred animals sunk,\r\novercome by loss of blood from numberless arrows and darts, to the\r\nsaturated ground.  There lay the shaggy monsters in every conceivable\r\nattitude into which a violent death could throw them, some on their\r\nbacks as they had rolled over, others with the young calves, which they\r\nhad run against in their mad career round the pound, impaled on their\r\nhorns; many had fallen over each other, and, dying from their wounds,\r\nhad formed large heaps in every direction.  It was truly a sickening\r\nspectacle.  [Note.]  The old hunter after a pause pointed towards\r\nit;--\"There Tom, that's just a picture of what has been going on in the\r\nworld time without mind,\" he remarked; \"the Indians are doing what the\r\nspirits of evil do, and the poor buffaloes are like the people in the\r\nworld, all driven madly together, destroying one another till none\r\nremain alive; but Christ delivers men from the spirits of evil, and\r\nleads them into safety and rest.\"  Hitherto the new comers had escaped\r\nobservation, but now numerous Indians crowded round, some to welcome the\r\nold white hunter, others to inquire the cause which brought the young\r\nman with him.  The first to approach the old man was a young girl; her\r\ncomplexion was fairer than that of several other girls who accompanied\r\nher, and her dress was more ornamented with beads and feathers than\r\ntheirs.  She stopped timidly at a short distance--Indian etiquette would\r\nnot allow her to approach nearer.  She was very beautiful, but her\r\nbeauty was that of the wild gazelle, it had not yet been destroyed by\r\nthe hard toil and often cruel usage to which the older women of her\r\npeople were exposed.  \"Come daughter, come,\" said the old man in the\r\nDakotah tongue, holding out his arms, \"I have good tidings for thee.\"\r\nThe young girl bounded forward, and Rob Nixon, taking her in his arms,\r\nimprinted a kiss on her brow.  \"Father, father, that you have come back\r\nwhen we thought you lost, is good news enough; you cannot bring me\r\nbetter,\" looking up into the old man's face, not without some surprise,\r\nhowever, at the affectionate manner in which she was treated, contrasted\r\nwith the stern way in which the Indians treat the females of their\r\npeople.  \"I will tell thee of the good news anon.  You might not value\r\nit as it deserves,\" said Robert Nixon.  \"Thy brother, where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He left the camp with a score more of our young braves nearly ten moons\r\nago, to make war on the Crees of the plain, and he has not yet returned.\r\nScouts have been sent out, but no tidings have been received of the\r\nparty.\"  The father did not conceal his disappointment.  \"I have a rich\r\ngift to offer him,\" he thought; \"would that he had been here to have\r\naccepted it.  Alas! alas! how great is my sin, who was born a Christian,\r\nto have allowed my children to grow up ignorant heathens.\"  It is sad to\r\nthink that many white men in many parts of the vast territory known as\r\nRupert's land, may have cause to feel as did Robert Nixon.  Two of old\r\nTom's sons were also away on the same hazardous expedition, but though\r\nanxious about them, for he was a kind-hearted man, he could not enter\r\ninto Rob Nixon's feelings in the matter.  Now as the evening came on the\r\npeople crowded into the encampment, all eager to hear how their white\r\nfriend and one of their chief, as well as the oldest, of their leaders\r\nhad escaped death.  He used no bitter expressions, but he could not help\r\nasking, ironically, how it was that--among so many who professed regard\r\nfor him--no one had thought of turning back to look for him when he was\r\nmissed?  Numerous were the excuses offered, and all were glad when he\r\ndropped the subject, and held up a book out of which he proposed to read\r\nto them in their own language.  Not knowing the nature of a book, they\r\nnaturally supposed it to be some powerful charm, and declared that he\r\nhad become a great medicine man.  \"If it is a charm, and I do not say\r\nthat it is not, it is one that, if you will listen, may do you good, and\r\nwill make you wiser than you have ever before been,\" he answered.  \"Do\r\nyou, or do you not wish to hear me?\"  There were no dissentient voices,\r\nand he then read to them how God, the Great Spirit, so loved the world,\r\nthat He sent His Son into the world that all who believe in Him should\r\nnot perish but have eternal life,--\"men, women, and children, old and\r\nyoung alike,\" he added.  \"I will tell you more about the matter\r\nby-and-by, friends.  Talk over now what I have said.  This book, though\r\nsmall, contains a great deal; many a day must pass before you know its\r\ncontents.  Those who wish to know more may come to my lodge when they\r\nwill, and I will read to them.\"\r\n\r\nBob Nixon made a very efficient missionary in his humble, unpretending\r\nway.  He did not attack Manitou or any of the superstitions, but he\r\nplaced the better way before them, that they might have the opportunity\r\nof comparing it with their own foolish customs and notions.  With his\r\nown daughter and his old friend, whom he knew he could trust, he\r\nproceeded in a different method; his friend he reminded of what he had\r\nbeen taught in his youth, how he had spent his life, and again and again\r\ninquired what hope he had for the future.  To his daughter he pointed\r\nout the folly of the religious belief and the customs of the red people,\r\nand showed her the advantages of those of true Christians.  To an\r\nartless, unsophisticated mind, where sin has not ruled triumphantly, the\r\nGospel will always prove attractive, if offered--as its Divine\r\nOriginator intended it should be offered--as a blessing--as a charter of\r\nfreedom, not a code of legal restrictions.  The young girl received it\r\njoyfully, and day by day increased in knowledge and grace.  He was,\r\nhowever, often in despair with regard to old Tom.  His friend listened\r\nto what he read and said, but the truth did not appear to find an\r\nentrance into his mind; still he listened and tried to pray, and as he\r\ntried he found praying less difficult; and when he listened he\r\ncomprehended better and better what he heard.  Tom's sons and daughters\r\nstill remaining with him began also to listen, and came oftener and\r\noftener to the old hunter's lodge, as their interest increased, till\r\nthey declared that they were ready to go wherever they could constantly\r\nhear the Word of God, and be more fully instructed in its truths.  A\r\nlarge part of Robert Nixon's object was accomplished, but not the whole.\r\nA great grief lay at his heart--the loss and probable death of his son.\r\nThe winter had now set in, snow covered the whole face of nature in\r\nevery direction for many hundreds of miles.  Travelling, though not\r\nimpracticable, had become more difficult and dangerous; it could,\r\nhowever, be accomplished by means of dog-sleighs or carioles, though all\r\nthe wealth possessed by Nixon and his friend could scarcely furnish dogs\r\nsufficient to transport all the party and provisions to the banks of the\r\nAssiniboine.  No news had been received of the missing band.  Old Tom\r\nshared his friend's grief, and now he began to dread their loss for the\r\nmost important reason.  Nixon's time was also engaged among the tribe\r\ngenerally; even the chief listened to him attentively, and offered no\r\nopposition to his proceedings.  For himself he said that he was too old\r\nto change, but that his people might follow the new way, if they found\r\nit better than the old.  Joseph, the young Sioux, was a great assistance\r\nto him.  Nixon offered to allow him to go back to his own people, but he\r\ndeclined, saying that he was not strong enough to resist temptations,\r\nand might be inclined to go back to their evil ways, if he found himself\r\namong them; an example which more civilised youths might wisely follow--\r\nnot to run into temptation.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNote.  The chief object of the Indians in thus slaughtering so large a\r\nnumber of buffalo is to lay in a store of their flesh, which they\r\npreserve and call pemmican.  It is first cut off free of fat and hung up\r\nin thin strips to dry in the sun.  It is then pounded between stones and\r\nput into leathern bags, with the boiled fat of the animal poured in and\r\nmixed with it.  The white fur traders also purchase this pemmican, as\r\nwell as the skins known as robes, and also the sinews.  Very many more\r\nanimals are killed than can be used by the thoughtless savages, and thus\r\nthousands are left to rot uselessly on the prairie.  As the buffaloes\r\ndecrease in number, so do the red men disappear from the face of the\r\nearth.  The settlement of civilised men in the territory appears to be\r\nthe only mode of saving the natives by affording them the means of\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nIt was during the short spring of the North American continent, which so\r\nsuddenly breaks into perfect summer, that a camp might have been seen\r\npitched on the side of the bank of a broad and rapid river.  The spot\r\nselected for the camp formed a bay of the river, or it might be called a\r\nnook in the bank.  It appeared to have been chosen for the purpose of\r\nconcealment: for only from one point on the opposite bank could it be\r\nseen, while above it was completely sheltered by the thick growth of\r\ntrees which fringed each side of the river.  From the conical shape of\r\nthe skin-covered tents, the accoutrements of the steeds tethered near,\r\nthe dog-sleds, for carrying goods and provisions, and the people\r\nstanding or sitting about, it would have been known at once to be a\r\nSioux encampment.  On a nearer inspection, however, several points of\r\ndifference would have been discovered.  In front of one of the tents sat\r\ntwo old men whose complexion showed that they were not Indians, while\r\nthe dress of one of them was that of a civilised man.  Several young\r\nwomen and girls were busily preparing the evening meal, some young men\r\nwere bringing them a supply of fire-wood and water, while others were\r\nengaged in fishing in the river.  Several, both of the young men and\r\ngirls, had complexions much lighter than those of Indians, though\r\nothers, from their dark colour, were evidently of the native race.  They\r\nseemed to be fearless of interruption; indeed, they probably relied on\r\ndue notice of danger being given them by their scouts or sentries, who\r\nwere watching from some of the more elevated spots in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nOne of the old men had been reading to the other from the Bible.  He\r\nclosed the sacred volume--\"Let us thank God, old friend, that within a\r\nweek we may hope once more to be among our Christian countrymen, and be\r\nable to join with them in His worship and praise, and to thank Him for\r\nHis loving mercy to us,\" said Robert Nixon.  \"For my part I have only\r\none desire: to recover my boys and yours, and to see them be longing to\r\nChrist's flock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Bill!\"  Tom always called his friend by that name, \"I, too, should\r\nlike to see the day; but it's far off, I fear.  But I hope they'll go to\r\nHeaven somehow.\"  This conversation was interrupted by a loud cry of\r\nalarm from the young women of the party; and, looking up, they saw a\r\ndozen redskin warriors, who had just issued from among the trees on the\r\nsummit of the bank above them.  Several had rifles, others were armed\r\nonly with bows.  They were in the act of taking aim with their weapons\r\nwhen Nixon saw them.  Forgetting the native language in his agitation,\r\nhe shouted out to them, in English, to desist.  They hesitated.  Some of\r\nthe girls took the opportunity of rushing off to seek for shelter behind\r\nthe trees.  Tom went into the tent for his gun.  Nixon advanced towards\r\nthe Indians, whom he perceived to be Crees, the mortal enemies of the\r\nDakotahs.  His daughter, believing him to be in danger, instead of\r\nrunning for shelter, like her companions, flew after him.  Old Tom\r\nre-appeared at the moment with his rifle.  The Crees, believing that\r\nresistance was about to be offered, fired.  Their powder or weapons were\r\nbad: some did not go off, the bullets, generally, flew wide, but one,\r\nalas! took effect.  It was in the bosom of Rob Nixon's daughter.  Her\r\ncry made him turn round, and, forgetting all else, he caught her in his\r\narms as she was sinking to the ground.  Before the savages had time to\r\nre-load, and as they were about to rush down the hill, scalping-knife in\r\nhand, to complete their cruel work, they were set upon by an equal\r\nnumber of Sioux, who sprang so suddenly on them from behind that not one\r\nof them had time to use his weapon in self-defence.  A desperate\r\nstruggle ensued, each man trying to pin his antagonist to the ground.\r\nTwo Crees, desperately wounded, lay fainting from loss of blood.  Tom,\r\nclimbing up the hill, still further turned the balance in favour of the\r\nSioux.  The Sioux were, Tom perceived, of his own party.  They had been\r\nwarned by one of their scouts that an enemy was at hand, and without\r\ndisturbing the rest of the camp had gone out to intercept them.  They\r\nhad, however, missed them, but again discovering their trail, had\r\nfollowed close in their rear, though not fast enough to prevent the\r\nunhappy catastrophe which had occurred.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was fierce and desperate.  Neither party expected any mercy\r\nfrom the victors.  Three of the Crees were killed, and this releasing\r\nthree of the Sioux party, aided by old Tom, the latter were able to\r\nassist their companions.  Their aim was, however, not to kill.  The\r\nCrees were quickly disarmed, and being bound, stood expecting the usual\r\nfate of the vanquished.  At a signal from Nixon they were led down the\r\nbank to where he knelt by the side of his daughter, in vain attempting\r\nto staunch the life-blood streaming from her wound.  \"Father!\" she\r\nwhispered; \"I am leaving you.  I feel death coming, but I am happy, for\r\nI know One powerful to save is ready to receive me.  I would have lived\r\nto have comforted you, but I believe my prayers are heard, and that my\r\nbrother will yet be restored to you.\"  She was silent for some time;\r\nthen her eyes, opening, fell on the prisoners as they stood bound on the\r\ntop of the bank, and she continued: \"I have but one petition to make.\r\nIt is that those ignorant men may not be punished.  They followed but\r\nthe ways of their people, and thought not of the wicked act they were\r\ndoing.  I would speak to them.\"  In a faint voice the dying girl\r\naddressed the prisoners, and urged them to listen to the words her\r\nfather would speak to them, adding: \"Truly do I forgive you, and may you\r\nfind forgiveness from the Great Good Spirit whom you know not.\"  It\r\nwould be difficult to describe the astonishment of the Crees when they\r\nfound that not only were they not to undergo torment before being\r\nkilled, but that they were actually freely pardoned.  After consulting\r\nfor some time, one of them, who appeared to be the leader, stepped\r\nforward and said:--\"We have heard that there are praying men among the\r\npale-faces, but that their praying made their people different to us we\r\ndid not know, for most of the things we do they do; they fight with each\r\nother and with us, they drive us from our lands, they cheat us when\r\ntrading, they shoot us without pity whenever they catch us, and they\r\nbring disease and death among us, so that, though once we were numerous\r\nas the stones which strew the prairie lands of the Dakotahs, now we can\r\ncount our people while the sun rests at its mid-day height in the sky.\r\nSuch was our notion of the pale-faces, but you have given us a different\r\nnotion.  Though we have done you a great injury, though our weapons have\r\ncruelly cut down one who is surely the most lovely of the flowers of the\r\nprairie, instead of slaying us, you forgive us; she too, even, not only\r\nforgives us, but prays to the Great Spirit for us.  Our minds are\r\nastonished; our hearts are softened, melted within us.  We would be your\r\nfriends, and we wish to prove it.  We know the pale-faces who dwell\r\ntowards the rising of the sun, and we will accompany you on your way to\r\nthem, and guard you from further attacks.  You doubt us.  You fear\r\ntreachery.  You are wise.  We will prove that we are honest.  Some moons\r\npast, ere the snows of winter had covered the ground, our tribe was\r\nassailed by a party of Dakotah braves.  We had notice of their coming,\r\nand had an ambush prepared for them.  Among them we discerned three whom\r\nwe knew by their colour to be the children of the pale-faces.  We judged\r\nthat they had been carried off when young, and we hoped to obtain a\r\nreward by restoring them to their parents or countrymen, our friends.\r\nThe Dakotahs we slew, but, though they fought desperately and were much\r\nwounded, we succeeded in saving the three young men alive.  We could not\r\nthen travel with them, so we kept them in our lodges while the snow\r\nremained.  We were on our way to the east with them when, in our folly,\r\nwe resolved to attack your camp.  Our prisoners we left with a small\r\nnumber of our band who are but a short way from this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! bring them--haste!--haste!\" exclaimed the wounded girl, alone\r\ndivining who they were of whom the Cree spoke; \"I would see my brother\r\nere I die.  I have much--much to say to him.\"\r\n\r\nAnxious to gratify his daughter, and satisfied that the Cree chief spoke\r\nthe truth, and would not prove treacherous, Robert Nixon allowed two of\r\nhis followers, known as fleet of foot, to hasten to his camp to bring in\r\nthe young men spoken of, having no doubt that his own son, and his\r\nfriend's two sons, were the prisoners spoken of.  Meantime, it appeared\r\ndoubtful whether the dying girl would survive till their arrival.  While\r\nthe rest of the party stood round grieving, she reclined in her father's\r\narms, occasionally whispering a few words of comfort in his ear, and\r\nassuring him of her happiness.  At length she lifted up her head in the\r\nattitude of listening.  Her quick ear had caught the sound of\r\napproaching footsteps, even before the rest of the party.  It was some\r\ntime before any one appeared.  \"I knew it--I knew it--my brother!\" she\r\ncried out, as several young men, running at full speed, burst from among\r\nthe trees at the top of the bank.  One of them, who was leading, taking\r\na hurried glance around, rushed down, and, with an expression in which\r\nsurprise and grief were mingled, threw himself by her side.  She took\r\nhis hand, and strange to his ear were the communications she made.\r\nAnother of the youths approached her.  She gave him her other hand, and\r\nturned her countenance towards him as she did so.  \"I was the cause of\r\nyour going on that expedition.  I was ignorant, dark-minded, wicked.  I\r\nknew well that you loved me.  I know it now; but, oh! listen to my\r\nfather.  He will tell you of One who loves you far more than I could do,\r\nwhose love will make ample amends for the loss of mine; and then we may\r\nmeet in the realms of happiness, to dwell for ever and ever together.\"\r\nTo the young heathen this language was an enigma.  Ere it was solved,\r\nthe speaker had ceased to breathe.  \"The Lord's will be done!\" said the\r\nold hunter: and those who knew how he loved his child understood what a\r\nmighty change religion had wrought in his heart.  They buried her in\r\nthat secluded spot, beneath the green turf, on which she had lately trod\r\nso full of life and beauty; and those who had loved her, and their late\r\nfoes, assisted to raise a monument, of materials furnished by the river\r\nbed and the surrounding trees, above her tomb.\r\n\r\nRob Nixon and all the party reached the settlements in safety.  He\r\nmourned as a father for his daughter, but his mourning was full of hope.\r\nHer dying words were not thrown away on her brother, or on his\r\ncompanions.  Before long, they were all baptised, and admitted to the\r\nprivileges and blessings of Christ's church.  When the father knelt at\r\nthe Lord's table, for the first time after his daughter's death, and\r\nthought of the dead for whom thanks had been given, because they had\r\ndied in Christ's faith and fear, he felt that his beloved daughter had\r\nnot died in vain.  He declared that he had not been preserved from so\r\nmany and great dangers of body and spirit, to lead a life of idleness,\r\nand while life remained, he never wearied in striving to bring others to\r\na knowledge of Him, whom he had found to be so precious to his own soul.\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
