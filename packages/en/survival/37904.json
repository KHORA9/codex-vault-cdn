NEW-YORK, NOVEMBER 1, 1851. No. IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT EXHIBITION OF THE NEW-YORK STATE AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY AT\r\nROCHESTER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXTERIOR OF THE FAIR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an age of Exhibitions. From the humble collection of cattle and\r\ncounter-panes, swine and \"garden sauce,\" at the central village of some\r\nsecluded County, up to the stupendous \"World's Fair\" at London, wherein all\r\nnations and all arts are represented, \"Industrial Expositions,\" as the\r\nFrench more accurately term them, are the order of the day. And this is\r\nwell--nay, it is inspiring. It proves the growth and diffusion of a wider\r\nand deeper consciousness of the importance and dignity of Labor as an\r\nelement of national strength and social progress. That corn and cloth are\r\nessential to the comfortable subsistence of the human family, and of every\r\nportion of it, was always plain enough; but the truth is much broader than\r\nthat. Not food alone, but knowledge, virtue, power, depend upon the subtle\r\nskill of the artificer's fingers, the sturdy might of the husbandman's arm.\r\nLet these fail, through the blighting influence of despotism,\r\nlicentiousness, superstition, or slavery, and the national greatness is\r\ncankered at the root, and its preservation overtasks the ability of\r\nPhocion, of Hannibal, of Cato. A nation flourishes or withers with the\r\ndevelopment and vigor of its Industry. It may prosper and be strong without\r\nstatesmen, warriors, or jurists; it fades and falls with the decline of its\r\narts and its agriculture. Wisely, therefore, do rulers, nobles, field\r\nmarshals and archbishops, unite in rendering the highest honors to eminence\r\nin the domain of Industry, dimly perceiving that it is mightier and more\r\nenduring than their petty and fragile potencies. The empire of Napoleon,\r\nthough so lately at its zenith, has utterly passed away, while that of\r\nFulton is still in its youth.\r\n\r\nA State Agricultural Society, numbering among its members some thousands of\r\nher foremost citizens, mainly but not wholly farmers, is one of the most\r\ncommendable institutions of this great and growing commonwealth. Aided\r\nliberally by the State government, it holds an Annual Fair at some one of\r\nthe chief towns of the interior, generally on the line of the Erie Canal,\r\nwhereby the collection of stock and other articles for exhibition is\r\nfacilitated, and the cost thereof materially lessened. Poughkeepsie,\r\nAlbany, Saratoga Springs, Utica, Syracuse (twice), Auburn, Rochester\r\n(twice), and Buffalo, are the points at which these Fairs have been held\r\nwithin the last ten years. Recently, the railroads have transported cattle,\r\n&c., for exhibition, either at half-price, or entirely without charge,\r\nwhile the State's bounty and the liberal receipts for admission to the\r\ngrounds have enabled the managers to stimulate competition by a very\r\nextensive award of premiums, so that almost every recurrence of the State\r\nFair witnesses a larger and still more extensive display of choice animals.\r\nWhether the improvement in quality keeps pace with the increase in number\r\nis a point to be maturely considered.\r\n\r\nThe Fair of this year was held at ROCHESTER, in a large open field about a\r\nmile south of the city, and of course near the Genesee river. Gigantic\r\nstumps scattered through it, attested how recently this whole region was\r\ncovered with the primeval forest. Probably fifty thousand persons now live\r\nwithin sight of the Rochester steeples, though not a human being inhabited\r\nthis then dense and swampy wilderness forty years ago. And here, almost\r\nwholly from a region which had less than five thousand white inhabitants in\r\n1810, not fewer than one hundred thousand persons, two-thirds of them adult\r\nmales, were drawn together expressly to witness this exhibition. The number\r\nwho entered the gates on Thursday alone exceeded seventy-five thousand,\r\nwhile the attendance on the two preceding days and on Friday, of persons\r\nwho were not present on Thursday, must have exceeded twenty-five thousand.\r\nOf course, many came with no definite purpose, no previous preparation to\r\nobserve and learn, and so carried home nothing more than they brought\r\nthere, save the head-ache, generated by their irregularities and excesses\r\nwhile absent; but thousands came qualified and resolved to profit by the\r\npractical lessons spread before them, and doubtless went away richly\r\nrecompensed for the time and money expended in visiting the Fair. This\r\nAnnual Exhibition is as yet the Farmers' University; they will in time have\r\na better, but until then they do well to make the most of that which\r\nalready welcomes them to its cheap, ready and practical inculcations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROCHESTER.]\r\n\r\nThe President of the State Society for this year is Mr. JOHN DELAFIELD,\r\nlong a master spirit among our Wall-street financiers, and for some years\r\nPresident of the Phenix bank. He was finally swamped by the rascality of\r\nthe State of Illinois in virtually repudiating her public debt, whereby Mr.\r\nDelafield, who had long acted as her financial agent in New-York, and had\r\nstaked his fortune on her integrity, was reduced from affluence to need.\r\nNothing daunted by this reverse, he promptly transferred his energies from\r\nfinance to agriculture, taking hold of a large farm in Seneca County, near\r\nthe beautiful village of Geneva; and on this farm he soon proved himself\r\none of the best practical agriculturists in our State. Before he had been\r\nfive years on the soil, he was already teaching hundreds of life-long\r\ncultivators, by the quiet force of his successful example, how to double\r\nthe product of their lands and more than double their annual profits. His\r\nenlightened and admirable husbandry has finally called him to the post he\r\nnow occupies--one not inferior in true dignity and opportunity for\r\nusefulness to that of Governor of the State. And this is a fair specimen of\r\nthe elasticity of the American character and its capacity for adapting\r\nitself to any and every change of circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE FAIR.]\r\n\r\nThe Annual Address at this Fair was delivered by the Hon. STEPHEN A.\r\nDOUGLAS, now U. S. Senator from Illinois, and a very probable \"Democratic\"\r\ncandidate for next President of the United States. It was an able and well\r\nenunciated discourse, devoted mainly to political economy as affecting\r\nagriculture, taking the \"free trade\" view of this important and difficult\r\nsubject, and evidently addressed quite as much to southern politicians as\r\nto New-York farmers; but it embodied many practical suggestions of decided\r\nforce and value. This address has already received a very wide circulation.\r\n\r\nA public entertainment was proffered on Thursday evening to the officers of\r\nthe State Society, on behalf of the city of Rochester, which was attended\r\nby ex-President TYLER, GOV. WASHINGTON HUNT, ex-Governor and ex-Secretary\r\nMARCY, GEN. WOOL, Governor WRIGHT of Indiana, &c. &c. Senator DOUGLAS\r\narrived in the train just before the gathering broke up. The presence of\r\nladies, and the absence of liquors, were the most commendable features of\r\nthis festivity, which was convened at an absurdly late hour, and\r\ncharacterized by an afflictive amount of dull speaking. Such an\r\nentertainment is very well on an occasion like this, merely as a means of\r\nenabling the congregated thousands to see and hear the celebrities convened\r\nwith them; but it should be given in the afternoon or beginning of the\r\nevening, should cost very little (the speaking being dog-cheap and the\r\neatables no object), and should in nearly all respects be just what the\r\nRochester festival was not. As an exercise in false hospitality, however,\r\nand a beacon for future adventurers in the same line, this entertainment\r\nhad considerable merit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AZALIA.\r\n\r\n_The best Short-Horned Durham Cow over Three Years Old: Owned by Lewis G.\r\nMorris._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD ERYHOLM.\r\n\r\n_The best Two Year Old Short-Horned Durham Bull: Owned by Lewis G.\r\nMorris._]\r\n\r\nNEAT CATTLE stood first in intrinsic value among the classes of articles\r\nexhibited at the Fair. Probably not less than One Thousand of these were\r\nshown on this occasion, including imported bulls and cows, working-oxen,\r\nfat steers, blood-heifers, calves, &c. &c. Of these we could not now say\r\nwhether the Durham or Devonshire breed predominated, but the former had\r\ncertainly no such marked ascendency as at former Fairs. Our impression from\r\nthe statements of disinterested breeders was and is, that where cattle are\r\nbred mainly for the market, a larger weight of flesh may be obtained at an\r\nearly age from the Durham than from any rival breed, though not of the\r\nfinest quality; while for milk or butter the Devon is, and perhaps one or\r\ntwo other breeds are, preferable. But this is merely the inference of one,\r\nwho has no experience in the premises, from a comparison of the statements\r\nof intelligent breeders of widely differing preferences. Probably each of\r\nthe half-dozen best breeds is better adapted to certain localities and\r\npurposes than any other; and intelligent farmers assert, that we still need\r\nsome breeds not yet introduced in this country, especially the small Black\r\nCattle of the Scottish Highlands, which, from their hardiness, excellence\r\nof flesh, small cost for wintering, &c., are specially adapted to our own\r\nrugged upland districts, particularly that which half covers the\r\nnorth-eastern quarter of our State. The subject is one of the deepest\r\ninterest to agriculturists, and is destined to receive a thorough\r\ninvestigation at their hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARL SEAHAM.\r\n\r\n_The best Short-Horned Durham Bull over Three Years Old: Owned by J. M.\r\nSherwood and A. Stevens._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEVON.\r\n\r\n_The best Devon Bull over Three Years Old: Owned by W. P. and C.

Some Canadian horses, and a few specimens of a famous Vermont breed\r\n(the Morgan) were among them. Our attention was not specially drawn in this\r\ndirection, and we will leave the merits of the rival competitors to the\r\nawards of the judges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEVON HEIFER.\r\n\r\n_Best three-fourth bred Devon Heifer: owned by George Shaeffer._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD CLYDE.\r\n\r\n_Best Foreign Horse: owned by Jane Ward, Markham, Canada West._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONSTERNATION.\r\n\r\n_Best thorough-bred horse over four years old: owned by John B. Burnet._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTH DOWN SHEEP.\r\n\r\n_Best Middle-Wooled Ewe, over Two Years Old: Owned by Lewis G. Morris._]\r\n\r\nOf Sheep, there were a large number present--at a rough guess, Two\r\nThousand--embracing specimens of widely contrasted varieties. The\r\nfine-wooled Saxonies and Merioes were largely represented; so were\r\ncoarse-wooled but fine-fleshed Bakewells and Southdowns. For three or four\r\nyears past, the annual product of wool, especially of the finer qualities,\r\nhas been unequal to the demand, causing a gradual appreciation of prices,\r\nuntil a standard has this year been reached above the value of the staple.\r\nSpeculators, who had observed the gradual rise through two or three\r\nseasons, rushed in to purchase this year's clip, at prices which cannot be\r\nmaintained, and the farmers have received some hundreds of thousands of\r\ndollars more for their wool than the buyers can ever sell it for. This has\r\nnaturally reacted on the price of sheep, whereof choice specimens for\r\nbreeding have been sold for sums scarcely exceeded during the celebrated\r\nMerino fever of 1816-18. _Bona fide_ sales for $100 each and over have\r\ncertainly been made; and it is confidently asserted that picked animals\r\nfrom the flocks of a famous Vermont breeder were sold, to improve Ohio\r\nflocks, at the late Fair of that State--a buck for $1,000, and six ewes for\r\n$300 each. These reports, whether veritable or somewhat inflated, indicate\r\na tendency of the times. Where sheep are grown mainly for the wool, it is\r\nas absurd to keep those of inferior grades, as to plant apple-trees without\r\ngrafting and grow two or three bushels of walnut-sized, vinegar-flavored\r\nfruit on a tree which might as well have borne ten bushels of Spitzenbergs\r\nor Greenings. But there is room also for improvement and profit in the\r\nbreeding of sheep other than the fine-wooled species. The famous\r\nroast-mutton of England ought to be more than rivaled among us; for we have\r\na better climate and far better sheep-walks than the English in the rugged\r\nmountain districts of New-England, of Pennsylvania, and of our own State.\r\nThe breeding of large, fine-fleshed sheep of the choicest varieties, on the\r\nlines of all the railroads communicating with the great cities, is one of\r\nthe undertakings which promise largest and surest returns to our farmers,\r\nand it is yet in its infancy. A hundred thousand of such sheep would be\r\ntaken annually by New-York and Philadelphia at largely remunerating prices.\r\nThousands of acres of sterile, scantily timbered land on the Delaware and\r\nits branches might be profitably transformed into extensive sheep-walks,\r\nwhile they must otherwise remain useless and unimproved for ages. These\r\nlands may now be bought for a song, and are morally certain to be far\r\nhigher within the next dozen years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG-WOOLED SHEEP.\r\n\r\n_Best long-wooled buck and ewe over two years old: owned by J. McDonald and\r\nWm. Rathbone._]\r\n\r\nOf Swine there were a good many exhibited at the Fair, but we did not waste\r\nmuch time upon them. The Hog Crop once stood high among the products of the\r\nolder States, but it has gradually fallen off since the settlement of the\r\ngreat West, and the cheapening of intercommunication between that section\r\nand the East, and is destined to sink still lower. Pork can be made on the\r\nprairies and among the nutwood forests and corn-bearing intervales of the\r\nWest for half the cost of making it in New-England; no Yankee can afford to\r\nfeed his hogs with corn, much less potatoes, as his grandfather freely did.\r\nOnly on a dairy farm can any considerable quantity of pork be profitably\r\nmade east of the Ohio; and he who keeps but a pig or two to eat up the\r\nrefuse of the kitchen cares little (perhaps too little) for the breed of\r\nhis porkers. So let them pass.\r\n\r\n\"Fancy\" Fowls are among the hobbies of our day, as was abundantly evinced\r\nat the State Fair. Coops piled on coops, and in rows twenty rods long, of\r\nChinese, Dorking, and other breeds of the most popular domestic bird,\r\nmonopolized a large share of attention; while geese, ducks, turkies, &c.,\r\nwere liberally and creditably represented. The \"Hen Convention,\" which was\r\na pet topic of Boston waggery a year or two since, might have been easily\r\nand properly held at Rochester. Many of these choice barn-yard fowls were\r\nscarcely inferior in size while doubtless superior in flavor to the\r\nordinary turky, while the farmer who opens the spring with a hundred of\r\nthem may half feed his family and at the same time quite keep down his\r\nstore-bill with their daily products. Small economies steadily pursued are\r\nthe source of thrift and competence to many a cultivator of flinty and\r\nungenial acres; few farmers can afford to disregard them. If thrice the\r\npresent number of fowls were kept among us, their care and food would\r\nscarcely be missed, while their product would greatly increase the\r\naggregate not only of thrift but of comfort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. DELAFIELD'S CHINESE HOGS.]\r\n\r\n\"Floral Hall\" was the name of a temporary though spacious structure of\r\nscantling and rough boards, in which were exhibited, in addition to a\r\nprofusion of the flowers of the season, a display of Fruits and Vegetables\r\nwhereof Rochester might well be proud. This city seems the natural centre\r\nof the finest fruit-growing district on the American continent--yes, in the\r\nwhole world. Its high latitude secures the richest flavors, while the harsh\r\nnorthern winds, which elsewhere prove so baneful, are here softened by\r\npassing over lake Erie or Ontario, and a climate thus produced, which, for\r\nfruit, has no rival. Large delicious grapes of innumerable varieties;\r\nexcellent peaches; delicate, juicy, luscious pears; quinces that really\r\ntempt the eye, though not the palate; and a profusion of fair, fragrant,\r\ngolden, mammoth apples,--these were among the products of the immediate\r\nvicinity of Rochester exhibited in bounteous profusion. In the department\r\nof Vegetables also there were beets and turnips of gigantic size; several\r\nsquashes weighing about one hundred and thirty pounds each; with\r\negg-plants, potatoes, tomatoes, and other edibles, which were all that\r\npalate could desire. The fertility of western New-York is proverbial; but\r\nit was never more triumphantly set forth than in the fruit and vegetables\r\nexhibited at the State Fair.\r\n\r\nOf butter, cheese, honey, (obtained without destroying the bees,)\r\nmaple-sugar &c., the display was much better than we have remarked on any\r\nformer occasion. And in this connection the rock salt from our own State\r\nworks around Syracuse deserves honorable mention. New-York salt has been\r\ntreated with systematic injustice by western consumers. In order to save a\r\nshilling or two on the barrel, they buy the inferior article produced by\r\nboiling instead of the far better obtained by solar evaporation; then they\r\nendeavor to make a New-York standard bushel of fifty six pounds do the work\r\nof a measured bushel of Turks Island weighing eighty pounds; and because\r\nthe laws regulating the preservation and decomposition of animal substances\r\nwill not thus be swindled, they pronounce the New-York salt impure and\r\nworthless. Now there is no purer, no better salt than the New-York solar;\r\nbut, even of this, fifty-six pounds will not do the work of eighty. Buy the\r\nbest quality, (and even this is dog cheap,) use the proper quantity, and no\r\nsalt in the world will preserve meats better than this. The New-York solar\r\nsalt exhibited at Rochester could not be surpassed, and that which had been\r\n_ground_ has no superior in its adaptation to the table.\r\n\r\nThere were many tasteful Counterpanes and other products of female skill\r\nand industry exhibited, but the perpetual crowd in the 'halls' devoted to\r\nmanufactures allowed no opportunity for their critical examination. Of\r\nstoves and ranges, heating and (let us be thankful for it, even at this\r\nlate day) ventilating apparatus and arrangements, there was a supply; and\r\nso of daguerreotypes, trunks, harness, &c. &c. Nothing, however, arrested\r\nour attention in this hall but the specimens of FLAX-COTTON and its various\r\nproportions exhibited by E. G. Roberts, assignee of Claussen's patents for\r\nthe United States. We saw one intelligent influential citizen converted\r\nfrom skepticism to enthusiasm for flax-cotton by his first earnest\r\nexamination. It _will_ go inevitably. A cotton fibre scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from Sea Island may be produced from flax by Claussen's\r\nprocess for six cents per pound; and a machine for breaking out the fibre\r\nfrom the unrotted stalk was exhibited by Mr. Clemmons of Springfield,\r\nMassachusetts, which is calculated materially to expedite the flax-cotton\r\nrevolution. This machine renders the entire fibre, with hardly a loss of\r\ntwo per cent. as 'swingle-tow,' straight and wholly separated from the\r\nwoody substance or 'shives,' at a cost which can hardly equal one cent per\r\npound of dressed flax. Its operation is very simple, and any man who has\r\nseen it work a day may manage it. Its entire cost is from $125 to $200,\r\naccording to size. It will be a shame to American agricultural enterprise\r\nif flax-cotton and linen are not both among our country's extensive and\r\nimportant products within the next three years.\r\n\r\nThe department of Agricultural Machinery and Implements was decidedly the\r\nmost interesting of any. No other can at all equal it in the rapidity and\r\nuniversality of progress from year to year. Of Plows, there cannot have\r\nbeen less than two hundred on the ground, exhibiting a great variety of\r\nnovel excellence. One with two shares, contrived to cut two furrows at\r\nonce, seemed the most useful of any recently invented. The upper share cuts\r\nand turns the sward to the depth of five inches, which is immediately\r\nburied seven inches deep by the earth turned up by the deeper share. Since\r\nit is impossible to induce one farmer in twenty to subsoil, this, as the\r\nnext best thing, ought to be universally adopted.\r\n\r\nSeed-Sowers, Corn-Planters, Reapers, Fanning-Mills, Straw-Cutters, &c.,\r\n&c., were abundant, and evinced many improvements on the best of former\r\nyears. A Mower with which a man, boy, and span of horses, will cut and\r\nspread ten acres per day of grass, however heavy, on tolerably level\r\nland--both cutting and spreading better than the hand-impelled scythe and\r\nstick will do--was among the new inventions; also two threshers and\r\ncleaners, each of them warranted to thresh and nearly clean, by the labor\r\nof four men, a boy, and two horses, over one hundred bushels of wheat or\r\ntwo hundred bushels of oats per day. The testimony of candid citizens who\r\nhad used them, and the evidence of our own senses, left no doubt on our\r\nmind of the correctness of these assertions. But we do not write to commend\r\nany article, but to call attention to the great and cheering truth which\r\nunderlies them all. Agriculture is a noble art, involving the knowledge of\r\nalmost all the practical sciences--chemistry, geology, climatology,\r\nmechanics, &c. It is not merely progressive, but rapidly progressing, so\r\nthat fifty days' labor on the same soil produce far more grain or hay now\r\nthan they did half a century ago. And every year is increasing and\r\nrendering more palpable the pressing need of a PRACTICAL COLLEGE, wherein\r\nAgriculture, Mechanics, and the sciences auxiliary thereto shall be ably\r\nand thoroughly taught to thousands and tens of thousands of our countrymen,\r\nwho shall in turn become the disseminators of the truths thus inculcated to\r\nthe youth of every county and township in the country.\r\n\r\nAnd thus shall Agriculture be rendered what it should be--not only the most\r\nessential but the most intellectual and attractive among the industrial\r\navocations of mankind.\r\n\r\n                              HORACE GREELEY\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VIRGINIA REAPER.\r\n\r\n_Exhibited at the Crystal Palace, and the New-York State Agricultural Fair,\r\nby Cyrus H. McCormick_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM ROSS WALLACE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the large number of young men in this country who write verses, we\r\nscarcely know of one who has a more unquestionable right to the title of\r\npoet than WILLIAM ROSS WALLACE, who has just published, in a very handsome\r\nvolume, a collection of his writings, under the title of _Meditations in\r\nAmerica_. Mr. WALLACE has written other things which in their day have been\r\nsufficiently familiar to the public; in what we have to say of his\r\ncapacities we shall confine ourselves to the pieces which he has himself\r\nhere selected as the truest exponents of his genius, and without giving\r\nthem indiscriminate praise shall hope to find in them evidences of peculiar\r\nand remarkable powers, combined with a spirit eminently susceptible to the\r\ninfluences of nature and of ideal and moral beauty.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace is a western man, and was born in Lexington, Kentucky, in the\r\nyear 1819. His father was a Presbyterian minister, of good family, and\r\nmarked abilities, who died soon after, leaving the future poet to the care\r\nof a mother whose chief ambition in regard to him was that he should be so\r\ntrained as to be capable of the most elevated positions in society. After\r\nthe usual preparatory studies, he went first to the Bloomington College,\r\nand afterwards to the South Hanover College, in Indiana, and upon\r\ngraduating at the latter institution studied the law in his native city.\r\nWhen about twenty-two years of age, having already acquired considerable\r\nreputation in literature, by various contributions to western and southern\r\nperiodicals, he came to the Atlantic states, and with the exception of a\r\nfew months passed in Philadelphia, and a year and a half in Europe, he has\r\nsince resided in New-York, occupied in the practice of his profession and\r\nin the pursuits of literature. Of his numerous poetical compositions, this\r\nis the first collection, and the only volume, except _Alban, a Romance_,\r\nintended to illustrate the influence of certain prejudices of society and\r\nprinciples of law on individual character and destiny, which was published\r\nin 1848.\r\n\r\nHis works generally are distinguished for a sensuous richness of style,\r\nearnestness of temper, and much freedom of speculation. Throughout the\r\n_Meditations in America_ we perceive that he is most at home in the serious\r\nand stately rhythms and solemn fancies of such pieces as the hymn \"To a\r\nWind Going Seaward,\" \"The Mounds of America,\" \"The Chant of a Soul,\" &c.;\r\nbut he occasionally writes in livelier and less peculiar measures.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Poe in his _Marginalia_ refers to the following as one of the\r\nfinest things in American literature; it is certainly very characteristic.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHANT OF A SOUL.\r\n\r\n    My youth has gone--the glory, the delight\r\n    That gave new moons unto the night,\r\n    And put in every wind a tone\r\n    And presence that was not its own.\r\n    I can no more create,\r\n    What time the Autumn blows her solemn tromp,\r\n    And goes with golden pomp\r\n    Through our unmeasurable woods:\r\n    I can no more create, sitting in youthful state\r\n    Above the mighty floods,\r\n    And peopling glen, and wave, and air,\r\n    With shapes that are immortal. Then\r\n    The earth and heaven were fair,\r\n    While only less than gods seem'd all my fellow-men.\r\n      Oh! the delight, the gladness,\r\n    The sense yet love of madness,\r\n    The glorious choral exultations,\r\n    The far-off sounding of the banded nations,\r\n    The wings of angels at melodious sweeps\r\n    Upon the mountain's hazy steeps,--\r\n    The very dead astir within their coffin'd deeps;\r\n    The dreamy veil that wrapp'd the star and sod--\r\n    A swathe of purple, gold, and amethyst;\r\n    And, luminous behind the billowy mist,\r\n    Something that look'd to my young eyes like GOD.\r\n      Too late I learn I have not lived aright,\r\n    And hence the loss of that delight\r\n    Which put a moon into the moonless night\r\n    I mingled in the human maze;\r\n    I sought their horrid shrine;\r\n    I knelt before the impure blaze;\r\n    I made their idols mine.\r\n    I lost mine early love--that love of balms\r\n    Most musical with solemn psalms\r\n    Sounding beneath the tall and graceful palms.\r\n      Who lives aright?\r\n    Answer me, all ye pyramids and piles\r\n    That look like calmest power in your still might.\r\n    Ye also do I ask, O continents and isles!\r\n    Blind though with blood ye be,\r\n    Your tongues, though torn with pain, I know are free.\r\n    Then speak, all ancient masses! speak\r\n    From patient obelisk to idle peak!\r\n    There is a heaving of the plains,\r\n    A trailing of a shroud,\r\n    A clash of bolts and chains--\r\n    A low, sad voice, that comes upon me like a cloud,\r\n            \"Oh, misery, oh, misery!\"--\r\n    Thou poor old Earth! no more, no more\r\n    Shall I draw speech from thee,\r\n    Nor dare thy crypts of legendary lore:\r\n    Let silence learn no tongue; let night fold every shore.\r\n      Yet I have something left--the will,\r\n    That Mont Blanc of the soul, is towering still.\r\n    And I can bear the pain,\r\n    The storm, the old heroic chain;\r\n    And with a smile\r\n    Pluck wisdom from my torture, and give back\r\n    A love to Fate from this my mountain-rack.\r\n    I do believe the sad alone are wise;\r\n    I do believe the wrong'd alone can know\r\n    Why lives the world, why spread the burden'd skies,\r\n    And so from torture into godship grow.\r\n    Plainer and plainer beams this truth, the more\r\n    I hear the slow, dull dripping of my gore;\r\n    And now, arising from yon deep,\r\n    'Tis plain as a white statue on a tall, dark steep.\r\n      Oh, suffering bards! oh spirits black\r\n    With storm on many a mountain-rack\r\n    Our early splendor's gone.\r\n    Like stars into a cloud withdrawn--\r\n    Like music laid asleep\r\n    In dried-up fountains--like a stricken dawn\r\n    Where sudden tempests sweep.\r\n    I hear the bolts around us falling,\r\n    And cloud to cloud forever calling:\r\n    Yet WE must nor despair nor weep.\r\n    Did WE this evil bring?\r\n    Or from our fellows did the torture spring?\r\n    Titans! forgive, forgive!\r\n    Oh, know ye not 'tis victory but to live?\r\n    Therefore I say, rejoice with harp and voice!\r\n    I know not what our fate may be:\r\n    I only know that he who hath a time\r\n    Must also have eternity:\r\n    One billow proves and gives a whole wide sea.\r\n    On this I build my trust,\r\n    And not on mountain-dust,\r\n    Or murmuring woods, or starlit clime,\r\n    Or ocean with melodious chime,\r\n    Or sunset glories in the western sky:\r\n    Enough, I _am_, and shall not choose to die.\r\n    No matter what my future fate may be:\r\n    To live is in itself a majesty!\r\n    Oh! there I may again create\r\n    Fair worlds as in my youthful state;\r\n    Or Wo may build for me a fiery tomb\r\n    Like Farinata's in the nether gloom:\r\n    Even then I will not lose the name of man\r\n    By idle moan or coward groan,\r\n    But say, \"It was so written in the mighty plan!\"\r\n\r\nThe next poem is in a vein of lofty contemplation, and the rhetoric is\r\neminently appropriate and well sustained. It is one of the most striking\r\npieces in the book.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUNDS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n      Come to the mounds of death with me. They stretch\r\n    From deep to deep, sad, venerable, vast,\r\n    Graves of gone empires--gone without a sighn,\r\n    Like clouds from heaven. They stretch'd from deep to deep\r\n    Before the Roman smote his mailed hand\r\n    On the gold portals of the dreaming East;\r\n    Before the Pleiad, in white trance of song,\r\n    Beyond her choir of stars went wandering.\r\n      The great old Trees, rank'd on these hills of death,\r\n    Have melancholy hymns about all this;\r\n    And when the moon walks her inheritance\r\n    With slow, imperial pace, the Trees look up\r\n    And chant in solemn cadence. Come and hear.\r\n      \"Oh patient Moon! go not behind a cloud,\r\n    But listen to our words. We, too, are old,\r\n    Though not so old as thou. The ancient towns,\r\n    The cities throned far apart like queens,\r\n    The shadowy domes, the realms majestical,\r\n    Slept in thy younger beams. In every leaf\r\n    We hold their dust, a king in every trunk.\r\n    We, too, are very old: the wind that wails\r\n    In our broad branches, from swart Ethiop come\r\n    But now, wail'd in our branches long ago,\r\n    Then come from darken'd Calvary. The Hills\r\n    Lean'd ghastly at the tale that wan Wind told;\r\n    The Streams crept shuddering through the tremulous dark;\r\n    The Torrent of the North, from morn till eve,\r\n    On his steep ledge hung pausing; and o'er all\r\n    Such silence fell, we heard the conscious Rills\r\n    Drip slowly in the caves of central Earth.\r\n    So were the continents by His crowned grief\r\n    Together bound, before that Genoese\r\n    Flamed on the dim Atlantic: so have we,\r\n    Whose aspect faced the scene, unchallenged right\r\n    Of language unto all, while memory holds.\r\n      \"O patient Moon! go not behind a cloud,\r\n    But hear our words. We know that thou didst see\r\n    The whole that we could utter--thou that wert\r\n    A worship unto realms beyond the flood--\r\n    But we are very lonesome on these mounds,\r\n    And speech doth make the burden of sad thought\r\n    Endurable; while these, the people new,\r\n    That take our land, may haply learn from us\r\n    What wonder went before them; for no word\r\n    E'er came from thee, so beautiful, so lone.\r\n    Throned in thy still domain, superbly calm\r\n    And silent as a god.\r\n                          Here empires rose and died;\r\n    Their very dust, beyond the Atlantic borne\r\n    In the pale navies of the charter'd wind,\r\n    Stains the white Alp. Here the proud city ranged\r\n    Spire after spire, like star ranged after star\r\n    Along the dim empyrean, till the air\r\n    Went mad with splendor, and the dwellers cried,\r\n    \"Our walls have married Time!\"--Gone are the marts,\r\n    The insolent citadels, the fearful gates,\r\n    The pictured domes that curved like starry skies;\r\n    Gone are their very names! The royal Ghost\r\n    Cannot discern the old imperial haunts,\r\n    But goes about perplexed like a mist\r\n    Between a ruin and the awful stars.\r\n    Nations are laid beneath our feet. The bard\r\n    Who stood in Song's prevailing light, as stands\r\n    The apocalyptic angel in the sun,\r\n    And rained melodious fire on all the realms;\r\n    The prophet pale, who shuddered in his gloom,\r\n    As the white cataract shudders in its mist;\r\n    The hero shattering an old kingdom down\r\n    With one clear trumpet's will: the Boy, the Sage,\r\n    Subject and Lord, the Beautiful, the Wise--\r\n    Gone, gone to nothingness.\r\n                                  The years glide on,\r\n    The pitiless years! and all alike shall fail,\r\n    State after State rear'd by the solemn sea,\r\n    Or where the Hudson goes unchallenged past\r\n    The ancient warder of the Palisades,\r\n    Or where, rejoicing o'er the enormous cloud,\r\n    Beam the blue Alleghanies--all shall fail:\r\n    The Ages chant their dirges on the peaks;\r\n    The palls are ready in the peopled vales;\r\n    And nations fill one common sepulchre.\r\n    Nor goes the Earth on her dark way alone.\r\n    Each star in yonder vault doth hold the dead\r\n    In its funereal deeps: Arcturus broods\r\n    Over vast sepulchres that had grown old\r\n    Before the earth was made: the universe\r\n    Itself is but one mighty cemetery\r\n    Rolling around its central, solemn sun.\r\n\r\n    \"O patient Moon! go not behind a cloud,\r\n    But listen to our words. We, too, must die--\r\n    And thou!--the vassal stars shall fail to hear\r\n    Thy queenly voice over the azure fields\r\n    Calling at sunset. They shall fade. The Earth\r\n    Shall look and miss their sweet, familiar eyes,\r\n    And, crouching, die beneath the feet of GOD.\r\n    Then come the glories, then the nobler times,\r\n    For which the Orbs travail'd in sorrow; then\r\n    The mystery shall be clear, the burden gone;\r\n    And surely men shall know why nations came\r\n    Transfigured for the pangs; why not a spot\r\n    Of this wide world but hath a tale of wo;\r\n    Why all this glorious universe is Death's.\r\n      \"Go, Moon! and tell the stars, and tell the suns,\r\n    Impatient of the wo, the strength of him\r\n    Who doth consent to death; and tell the climes\r\n    That meet thy mournful eyes, one after one,\r\n    Through all the lapses of the lonesome night,\r\n    The pathos of repose, the might of Death!\"\r\n      The voice is hush'd; the great old wood is still:\r\n    The Moon, like one in meditation, walks\r\n    Behind a cloud. We, too, have them for thought,\r\n    While, as a sun, GOD takes the West of Time\r\n    And smites the pyramid of Eternity.\r\n    The shadow lengthens over many worlds\r\n    Doom'd to the dark mausoleum and mound.\r\n\r\nWe do not remember any poem on Mahomet finer than the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nEL AMIN.\r\n\r\n    Who is this that comes from Hara? not in kingly pomp and pride,\r\n    But a great, free son of Nature, lion-souled and eagle-eyed!\r\n\r\n    Who is this before whose presence idols tumble to the sod?\r\n    While he cries out--\"Allah Akbar! and there is no god but God!\"\r\n    Wandering in the solemn desert, he has wondered like a child\r\n    Not as yet too proud to wonder, at the sun, and star, and wild.\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, thou moon! who made thy brightness? Stars! who hung you there on high?\r\n    Answer! so my soul may worship: I must worship or die!\"\r\n\r\n    Then there fell the brooding silence that precedes the thunder's roll;\r\n    And the old Arabian Whirlwind called another Arab soul.\r\n\r\n    Who is this that comes from Hara? not in kingly pomp and pride,\r\n    But a great, free son of Nature, lion-souled and eagle-eyed!\r\n\r\n    He has stood and seen Mount Hara to the Awful Presence nod;\r\n    He has heard from cloud and lightning--\"Know there is no god but God!\"\r\n\r\n    Call ye this man an imposter? He was called \"The Faithful,\" when,\r\n    A boy, he wandered o'er the deserts, by the wild-eyed Arab men.\r\n\r\n    He was always called \"The Faithful.\" Truth he knew was Allah's breath;\r\n    But the Lie went darkly gnashing through the corridors of Death.\r\n\r\n    \"He was fierce!\" Yes! fierce at falsehood--fierce at hideous bits of wood,\r\n    That the Koreish taught the people made the sun and solitude.\r\n\r\n    But his heart was also gentle, and Affection's graceful palm,\r\n    Waving in his tropic spirit, to the weary brought a balm.\r\n\r\n    \"Precepts?\" \"Have on each compassion:\" \"Lead the stranger to your door:\"\r\n    \"In your dealings keep up justice:\" \"Give a tenth unto the poor.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Yet ambitious!\" Yes! ambitious--while he heard the calm and sweet\r\n    Aiden-voices sing--to trample troubled Hell beneath his feet.\r\n\r\n    \"Islam?\" Yes! \"Submit to Heaven!\" \"Prophet?\" To the East thou art!\r\n    What are prophets but the trumpets blown by God to stir the heart?\r\n\r\n    And the great heart of the desert stirred unto that solemn strain,\r\n    Rolling from the trump at Hara over Error's troubled main.\r\n\r\n    And a hundred dusky millions honor still El Amin's rod--\r\n    Daily chanting--\"Allah Akbar! know there is no god but God!\"\r\n\r\n    Call him then no more \"Impostor.\" Mecca is the Choral Gate\r\n    Where, till Zion's noon shall take them, nations in her morning wait.\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace has published a few songs. They have not the stately movement\r\nof his other pieces, and the one which follows needs the application of the\r\nfile; but it is, like the others, very spirited:\r\n\r\n\r\nAVELINE.\r\n\r\n    ----The sunny eyes of the maiden fair\r\n    Give answer better than voice or pen\r\n    That as he loves he is loved again.--C. C. LEEDS.\r\n\r\n    Love me dearly, love me dearly with your heart and with your eyes;\r\n    Whisper all your sweet emotions, as they gushing, blushing rise;\r\n    Throw your soft white arms about me;\r\n    Say you cannot live without me:\r\n    Say, you are my Aveline; say, that you are only mine,\r\n    That you cannot live without me, young and rosy Aveline!\r\n\r\n    Love me dearly, dearly, dearly: speak you love-words silver-clearly,\r\n    So I may not doubt thus early of your fondness, of your truth.\r\n    Press, oh! press your throbbing bosom closely, warmly to my own:\r\n    Fix your kindled eyes on mine--say you live for me alone,\r\n    While I fix my eyes on thine,\r\n    Lovely, trusting, artless, plighted; plighted, rosy Aveline!\r\n\r\n    Love me dearly; love me dearly: radiant dawn upon my gloom:\r\n    Ravish me with Beauty's bloom:--\r\n    Tell me \"Life has yet a glory: 'tis not all an idle story!\"\r\n    As a gladdened vale in noonlight; as a weary lake in moonlight,\r\n    Let me in thy love recline:\r\n    Show me life has yet a splendor in my tender Aveline.\r\n\r\n    Love me dearly, dearly, dearly with your heart and with your eyes:\r\n    Whisper all your sweet emotions as they gushing, blushing rise.\r\n    Throw your soft white arms around me; say you _lived not_ till you found me--\r\n    Say it, say it, Aveline! whisper you are only mine;\r\n    That you cannot live without me, as you throw your arms about me,\r\n    That you _cannot_ live without me, artless, rosy Aveline!\r\n\r\nOur limits will not permit us to quote any of the remaining poems of this\r\nvolume in full, and we conclude our extracts with a few passages penciled\r\nwhile in a hasty reading. In the piece entitled The Kings of Sorrow, the\r\npoet sings:\r\n\r\n    Was HE not sad amid the grief and strife, the Lord of light and life,\r\n    Whose torture made humanity divine, upon that woful hill of Palestine?\r\n    Then is it not far better thus to be, thoughtful, and brave, and melancholy,\r\n    Than given up to idle revelry, amid the unreligious brood of folly?\r\n    For our sorrow is a worship, worship true, and pure, and calm,\r\n    Sounding from the choir of duty like a high, heroic psalm,\r\n    In its very darkness bearing to the bleeding heart a balm.\r\n    Brothers, we must have no wailing: do we agonize alone?\r\n    Look at all the pallid millions; hear a universal moan,\r\n    From the mumbling, low-browed Bushman to a Lytton on his throne.\r\n    Nor shall we have coward faltering: Brothers! we must be sublime\r\n    By due labor at the forges blazing in the cave of Time;\r\n    Knowing life was made for duty, and that only cowards prate\r\n    Of a search for Happy Valley and the hard decrees of fate:\r\n    Seeing through this night of mourning all the future as a star,\r\n    And a joy at last appearing on the centuries afar,\r\n    When the meaning of the sorrow, when the mystery shall be plain,\r\n    When the Earth shall see her rivers roll through Paradise again.\r\n    O! the vision gives to sorrow something white and purple-plumed:\r\n    Even the hurricane of Evil comes a hurricane perfumed.\r\n\r\nIn the same:\r\n\r\n    ... The Storm is silent while we speak;\r\n    The awe-struck Cloud hath paused above the peak;\r\n    The far Volcano statlier waves on high\r\n    His smoking censer to the solemn sky;\r\n    And see, the troubled Ocean folds his hands\r\n    With a great patience on the yellow sands.\r\n\r\nIn Rest:\r\n\r\n    So rest! and Rest shall slay your many woes;\r\n    Motion is god-like--god-like is repose,\r\n    A mountain-stillness, of majestic might,\r\n    Whose peaks are glorious with the quiet light\r\n    Of suns when Day is at his solemn close.\r\n    Nor deem that slumber must ignoble be.\r\n    Jove labored lustily once in airy fields;\r\n    And over the cloudy lea\r\n    He planted many a budding shoot\r\n    Whose liberal nature daily, nightly yields\r\n    A store of starry fruit.\r\n    His labor done, the weary god went back\r\n    Up the long mountain track\r\n    To his great house; there he did wile away\r\n    With lightest thought a well-won holiday;\r\n    For all the Powers crooned softly an old tune\r\n    Wishing their Sire might sleep\r\n    Through all the sultry noon\r\n    And cold blue night;\r\n    And very soon\r\n    They heard the awful Thunderer breathing low and deep.\r\n    And in the hush that dropped adown the spheres,\r\n    And in the quiet of the awe-struck space,\r\n    The worlds learned worship at the birth of years:\r\n    They looked upon their Lord's calm, kingly face.\r\n    And bade Religion come and kiss each starry place.\r\n\r\nIn the same:\r\n\r\n    See what a languid glory binds\r\n    The long dim chambers of the darkling West,\r\n    While far below yon azure river winds\r\n    Like a blue vein on sleeping Beauty's breast.\r\n\r\nIn The Gods of Old:\r\n\r\n    Not realmless sit the ancient gods\r\n      Upon their mountain-thrones\r\n    In that old glorious Grecian Heaven\r\n      Of regal zones.\r\n    A languor o'er their stately forms\r\n      May lie,\r\n    And a sorrow on their wide white brows,\r\n      King-dwellers of the sky!\r\n    But theirs is still that large imperial throng\r\n      Of starry thoughts and firm but quiet wills,\r\n    That murmured past the blind old King of Song,\r\n      When staring round him on the Thunderer's hills.\r\n\r\nIn the same:\r\n\r\n      ... Still Love, sublime, shall wrap\r\n    His awful eyebrows in Olympian shrouds.\r\n      Or take along the Heaven's dark wilderness\r\n    His thunder-chase behind the hunted clouds.\r\n    And mortal eyes upturned shall behold\r\n    Apollo's robe of gold\r\n    Sweep through the long blue corridor of the sky\r\n    That, kindling, speaks its Deity:\r\n    And He, the Ruler of the Sunless Land\r\n      Of restless ghosts, shall fitfully illume\r\n    With smouldering fires, that stir in caverned eyes,\r\n      Hell's mournful House of Gloom.\r\n\r\nIn the Hymn to a Wind, Going Seaward:\r\n\r\n                        Move on! Move on,\r\n    Wind of the wide wild West! Tell thou to all\r\n    The Isles, tell thou to all the Continents\r\n    The grandeur of my land! Speak of its vales\r\n    Where Independence wears a pastoral wreath\r\n    Amid the holy quiet of his flock;\r\n    And of its mountains with their cloudy beards\r\n    Tossed by the breath of centuries; and speak\r\n    Of its tall cataracts that roll their bass\r\n      Amid the choral of the midnight storms;\r\n    And of its rivers lingering through the plains\r\n    So long, that they seem made to measure time;\r\n    And of its lakes that mock the haughty sea;\r\n    And of its caves where banished gods might find\r\n    Night large enough to hide their crownless heads;\r\n    And of its sunsets broad and glorious there\r\n    O'er Prairies spread like endless oceans on--\r\n    And on--and on--over the far dim leagues\r\n    Till vision shudders o'er immensity.\r\n\r\nIn the same:\r\n\r\n          ----Troubled France\r\n    Shall listen to thy calm deep voice, and learn\r\n    That Freedom must be calm if she would fix\r\n    Her mountain moveless in a heaving world.\r\n\r\nIn a Chant to the East:\r\n\r\n    Still! Oh still!\r\n      Despite of passion, sin, and ill,\r\n    Despite of all this weary world hath brought,\r\n      An angel band from Zion's holy hill\r\n    Walks gently through the open gate of Thought.\r\n    Oh, still! Oh, still!\r\n    Despite of passion, sin, and ill,\r\n    ONE in red vesture comes in sorrow's time--\r\n    ONE crowned with thorns from that far Orient clime,\r\n    Who pitying looks on me\r\n    And gently asks, \"Poor man, what aileth thee?\"\r\n\r\nIn the same:\r\n\r\n    The nations must forever turn to thee,\r\n      Feeling thy lustrous presence from afar;\r\n    And feed upon thy splendor as a sea\r\n      Feeds on the shining shadow of a star.\r\n\r\nIn Wordsworth:\r\n\r\n    And many a brook shall murmur in my verse;\r\n    And many an ocean join his cloudy bass;\r\n    And many a mountain tower aloft, whereon\r\n    The black storm crouches, with his deep-red eyes\r\n    Glaring upon the valleys stretch'd below;\r\n    And many a green wood rock the small, bright birds\r\n    To musical sleep beneath the large, full moon;\r\n    And many a star shall lift on high her cup\r\n    Of luminous cold chrysolite, set in gold\r\n    Chased subtilely over by angelic art;\r\n    To catch the odorous dews which poets drink\r\n    In their wide wanderings; and many a sun\r\n    Shall press the pale lips of the timorous morn\r\n    Couch'd in the bridal east: and over all\r\n    Will brood the visible presence of the ONE\r\n    To whom my life has been a solemn chant.\r\n\r\nIn the Last Words of Washington:\r\n\r\n    There is an awful stillness in the sky,\r\n    When after wondrous deeds and light supreme,\r\n    A star goes out in golden prophecy.\r\n    There is an awful stillness in the world,\r\n    When after wondrous deeds and light supreme,\r\n    Sceptres refused and forehead crowned with truth,\r\n    A Hero dies, with all the future clear\r\n    Before him, and his voice made jubilant\r\n    By coming glories, and his nation hushed,\r\n    As though they heard the farewell of a god.\r\n    A great man is to earth as God to Heaven.\r\n\r\nIn Greenwood Cemetery:\r\n\r\n    O, ye whose mouldering frames were brought and placed\r\n    By pious hands within these flowery slopes\r\n    And gentle hills, where are ye dwelling now?\r\n    For man is more than element! The soul\r\n    Lives in the body as the sunbeam lives\r\n    In trees or flowers that were but clay without.\r\n    Then where are ye, lost sunbeams of the mind?\r\n    Are ye where great Orion towers and holds\r\n    Eternity on his stupendous front?\r\n    Or where pale Neptune in the distant space\r\n    Shows us how far, in his creative mood,\r\n    With pomp of silence and concentred brows,\r\n    The Almighty walked? Or haply ye have gone\r\n    Where other matter roundeth into shapes\r\n    Of bright beatitude: Or do ye know\r\n    Aught of dull space or time, and its dark load\r\n    Of aching weariness?\r\n\r\nMr. Wallace is somewhat too much of a rhetorician, and he has a few defects\r\nof manner which, from this frequent repetition, he seems to regard as\r\nbeauties. Peculiar phrases, of doubtful propriety, but which have a musical\r\nroll, occur in many of his poems, so that they become very prominent; this\r\nfault, however, belongs chiefly to his earlier pieces; the extracts we have\r\ngiven, we think will amply vindicate to the most critical judgments, the\r\npraise here awarded to him as a poet of singular and unusual powers,\r\noriginal, earnest, and in a remarkable degree _national_. It can scarcely\r\nbe said of any of our bards that they have caught their inspiration more\r\ndirectly from observation and experience, or that their effusions, whatever\r\nthe distinction they have in art, are more genuine in feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA AS ABUSED BY A GERMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving made it a point to faithfully report all that is said of our country\r\nby foreign travellers or journalists, we deem it a duty to lay before our\r\nreaders not only the more agreeable accounts given by those who have\r\nimpartially examined our institutions and manners, but also the more\r\nprejudiced relations of those who, urged by interest or ill-nature, have\r\nsketched simply the darker and more irregular outlines. And we are the more\r\ninduced to follow this course since we are fully convinced that it is\r\nproductive of equal good with the former. We have--particularly to English\r\neyes--appeared as a people who eagerly devour all that is said to our\r\ndiscredit, and at the same time fiercely repudiate the slightest\r\ninsinuation that we in any thing fall short of perfection. As regards the\r\nlatter, we shall content ourselves with remarking, that even the\r\ndisposition to deny the existence of imperfection among us, redounds far\r\nmore to our credit, than the complacent exaltation of our weaker points to\r\nvirtues; while as to the former, we are certain that a higher feeling than\r\nmere nervous, sensitive vanity, induces in us the desire\r\n\r\n    \"To see ourselves as others see us,\"\r\n\r\nsince there is no nation which more readily avails itself of the remarks of\r\nothers, even when by far too bitter or unjust to improve. True to our\r\nnational character of youthfulness, we are ever ready to act on every hint.\r\nWe are, _par excellence_, a _learning_ nation. Send even the _young_\r\nEnglishman on his continental tour, and the chances are ten to one that he\r\nreturns with every prejudice strengthened, and his vanity increased. But\r\nthe American--ductile as wax, evinces himself even at an advanced period of\r\nlife, susceptible of improvement, yet firm in its retention. That we\r\nearnestly strive in every respect to improve is evident from many \"little\r\nthings\" which foreigners ridicule. For instance, the habitual use of \"fine\r\nlanguage,\" and the attempt to clothe even our ordinary trains of thought in\r\nan elegant garb, which has been time and again cruelly ridiculed by Yankee\r\ngoaders, is to a reflecting mind suggestive of commendation, from the very\r\nfact, that an attempt at least is made _to improve_. Better a thousand\r\ntimes the impulse to progress, even through the whirlwinds of hyperbole and\r\ninflated expression, than the heavy miasma of a patois, the lightest breath\r\nof which at once proclaims the cockney or provincial.\r\n\r\nFor the entertainment of those who are willing to live, laugh, and learn,\r\nwe are induced to give our readers a few extracts from a recently published\r\nwork, by a German, entitled, _Skizzen aus den Vereinigten Staaten von Nord\r\nAmerika: Von_ DR. A. KIRSTEN, (or, _Sketches of the United States of North\r\nAmerica_, by Dr. A. KIRSTEN,) a work in which the author, after exhausting\r\nall the three-penny thunder of ignorant abuse, coolly informs his readers,\r\nthat he has by no means represented things in their worst light. The\r\nAmerican public at large are not aware that among the rulers of Germany,\r\nemigration to America is sternly yet anxiously discouraged. Rejoiced as\r\nthey are to behold our country a receptacle for the sweepings of their\r\nprisons and _Fuchthaueser_, or houses of correction, they still gaze with an\r\nalarmed glance at the almost incredible \"forth-wandering\" which has at\r\ntimes depopulated entire villages, and borne with it an amount of wealth,\r\nwhich, trifling as it may appear to us, is in a land of economy and poverty\r\nof immense importance. The reader who judges of Germany by Great Britain\r\nand Ireland, is mistaken. That emigration which is to the government of the\r\nlatter countries health and safety, brings to the former death and\r\ndestruction. As a proof of this, we need only point to the tone of all the\r\nGerman papers which are in any manner connected with the interests of their\r\nrespective courts. In all we find the old song: Depreciation of America, as\r\nfar as applicable to the prevention of emigration. To accomplish this end,\r\nwriters are hired and poets feed; remedies against emigration are proposed\r\nby political economists, and where possible, even clergymen are induced to\r\npersuade their flocks to nibble still in the ancient stubble, or among the\r\nsame old barren rocks.\r\n\r\nDr. Kirsten, it would appear, is either a natural and habitual grumbler, or\r\na paid hireling. If the former, we can only pity--if the latter, despise\r\nhim. Could our voice be heard by his patrons, we would, however, advise\r\nthem to employ a better grumbler--one who can wield lance and sword against\r\nhis foes, instead of mops and muddy water. A weaker lancer, or more\r\nimpotent and impudent abuser, has rarely appeared, even among our earlier\r\nEnglish decriers.\r\n\r\nLike many other weak-minded individuals, the Herr Doctor appears to have\r\nstarted under the fullest conviction that our country was, if not a true\r\n\"_Schlaraffen Land_,\" or _Pays de Cocagne_, or Mahomet's Paradise, in which\r\npigeons ready roasted fly to the mouth, at least a realized _Icarie_, or\r\nperfected Fourier-dom. All the books which he had read, relative to\r\nAmerica, described it in glowing colors, and inclined his mind favorably\r\ntoward it. Such was his faith in these books, or also so great his fear,\r\nthat these glorious dreams might be dissipated, that he did not even\r\nascertain or confirm their truth by the personal experience of those who\r\nhad been there, and we are informed naively enough in the preface, that\r\nprevious to his departure he had but once had an opportunity of conversing\r\nwith an educated German, who had resided for a long time in America. Such\r\nweak heedlessness as this does not, to our ears at least, savor of the\r\ncharacteristic prudence and deliberation of the German, and strongly\r\nconfirms us in the belief, that the doctor wandered forth well knowing what\r\nhe was about--in other words, that he went his way with his opinions\r\nalready cut and dried.\r\n\r\n\"After an eight weeks' voyage I arrived in New-York. It was at the end of\r\nAugust. Even in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream a terrible heat oppressed\r\nus, which increased as we approached land; but it was in that city that I\r\nbecame aware of what the heat in America really was. Many visits which I\r\nwas obliged to make, caused during the day a cruel exhaustion, while at\r\nnight I found no refreshment in slumber, partly because the heat was hardly\r\ndiminished, and partly from the musquitoes, and to me unaccustomed alarms\r\nof fire, which were nightly repeated, from which I found that life in\r\nAmerica was by no means so agreeable as I had been led to infer from books\r\nand popular report.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the single, mysterious, educated German with whom the doctor had\r\nconferred previous to his departure, he had learned that, in the United\r\nStates, any thing like marked distinction of class, rank, or caste, did not\r\nexist; and that this was particularly the case among Germans living there.\r\n\"The educated and refined knew how to draw into their society the less\r\ngifted, and it was really singular to observe in how short a time the\r\nlatter rose to a higher degree of culture. People actually destitute of\r\nknowledge and manners, in fact could not be found. Moreover, I there\r\nanticipated a southern climate, for which I had some years longed.\"\r\n\r\nHow miserably the poor doctor was disappointed in these moderate and\r\nreasonable anticipations, appears from the following lamentable account:\r\n\r\n\"Ere long I, indeed, became acquainted with many Germans, who received me\r\nin the kindest manner, and of whom recollections will ever be dear to me.\r\nBut this was not the case with the Americans, as I had been led to\r\nanticipate, nor indeed with the Germans, generally. Among these I found\r\nneither connection nor unity, and they mostly led a life such as I had in\r\nGermany never met with, while nothing like social cultivation, in a higher\r\nsense, was to be found. Led into the society of those who by day were\r\ndevoted to business, but in the evening scattered themselves, here and\r\nthere, without a point of union, I found myself in the noisy, but\r\npleasure-wanting city, forlorn and unwell. Many, to whom I complained of\r\nwhat I missed in New-York, thought that it might be found in Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\nBut even in Philadelphia our pilgrim found not the promised Paradise, where\r\nthere was no distinction of rank or family, and where the more educated and\r\nrefined would eagerly adopt him, the lowly brother, into their Icarian\r\ncircle. Neither did he discover the golden tropical region--the southern\r\nheaven--for which his soul had longed for years. Alas! no. \"After a\r\nresidence of four weeks in New-York, I repaired to Philadelphia, and there\r\nfound that among the Germans, things were the same as in New-York--_in\r\nfact, there was even less unity among them_.\" But although the doctor did\r\nnot discover any Germans inspired with the sublime spirit of harmony, he\r\ncertainly appears to have met with several who had acquired the American\r\nvirtue of common sense.\r\n\r\n\"A German who had been for a long time resident in the United States\r\nasserted that he had, as yet, met with no fellow-countryman, who had been\r\nin the beginning satisfied with America. Others were of the opinion, that I\r\nwould first be pleased with the country when I had found a profitable\r\nemployment. _And some others, that I would never be satisfied._\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the doctor, ever dependent on others for happiness, looked here and\r\nthere, like the pilgrim after Aden, or the hero of the Morning Watch, for\r\nthe ideal of his dreams. The so-called entirely German towns in\r\nPennsylvania were German only in name. The heat disgusted him with the\r\nsouth--the cold with the north. After residing nine months in Poughkeepsie,\r\nhe returned to New-York, and there remained for some time, occupied, as it\r\nwould appear, solely with acquiring information. This residence at an end,\r\nhe returned to Germany.\r\n\r\nWe pass over the first chapters of his work, devoted to an ordinary account\r\nof the climate, animals, and plants of the country, to a more interesting\r\npicture, namely--its inhabitants. From this we learn that the American is\r\ncold, dry, and monosyllabic, in his demeanor and conversation. During his\r\nreturn to Germany he was delayed for a period of something less than nine\r\ndays at Falmouth, England, where, during his daily walks, he experienced\r\nthat in comparison with us the English are amiable, communicative, and\r\nagreeable. Indeed, he found that when, during a promenade in America,\r\nstrangers returned his greetings, these polite individuals were invariably\r\nBritons, \"which proves that while in more recent times, the English have\r\nassumed or approached the customs of other nations, the Americans have\r\nremained true to the character and being of the earlier emigrants, and are\r\nat present totally distinct from the English of to-day.\r\n\r\n\"This is especially shown by the demeanor of Americans towards foreigners,\r\nand nearly as much so by their conduct to one another. Regard them where we\r\nwill, they are ever the same. In the larger or the smaller towns, in the\r\nstreets or in the country, every one goes his own way without troubling\r\nhimself about others, and without saluting those with whom he is\r\nunacquainted. Never do we see neighbors associating with each other; and\r\nneighborly friendship is here unknown. If acquaintances meet, they nod to\r\neach other, or the one murmurs, '_How do you do?_' while the other\r\nreplies, '_Very well_,' without delaying an instant, unless business\r\naffairs require a conversation. This concluded, they depart without a word,\r\nunless, indeed, as an exception, they wish each other good morning, or\r\nevening. Nor are they less distant in hotels, or during journeys in\r\nrailroad cars and steamboats.\"--\"Continued conversations, in which several\r\ntake part, are extremely rare. Any one speaking frequently to a stranger,\r\nat table or during a journey, runs the risk not merely of being regarded as\r\nimpertinent, but as entertaining dishonest views; and, indeed, one should\r\ninvariably be on his guard against Americans who manifest much\r\nfriendliness, since, in this manner, pickpockets are accustomed to make\r\ntheir advances.\r\n\r\n\"In a corresponding degree this coldness of disposition is manifested\r\ntowards more intimate acquaintances. Never do we observe among friends a\r\ndeep and heart-inspired, or even a confiding relationship. Nay, this is not\r\neven to be found among members of the same family. The son or the daughter,\r\nwho has not for several days seen his or her parents, returns and enters\r\nthe room without a greeting, or without any signs of joy being manifested\r\nby either. Or else the salutation is given and returned in such a manner\r\nthat scarcely a glance passes between the parties. The direst calamities\r\nare imparted and listened to with an apathy evincing no signs of emotion,\r\nand a great disaster, occurring on a railroad or steamboat, in the United\r\nStates, excites in Germany more attention and sympathy than in the former\r\ncountry, even when friends and perhaps relatives have thereby suffered.\r\nEven the loss of a member of the family is hardly manifested by the\r\nsurvivors.\"\r\n\r\nIn a recent English work we were indeed complimented for our _patience_,\r\nbut it was reserved for Doctor Kirsten to discover in us, this degree of\r\niron-hearted, immovable, _nil admirarism_. But when he goes on to assert\r\nthat \"in the most deadly peril--in such moments as those which precede the\r\nanticipated explosion of a steamboat boiler, even their ladies preserve the\r\nsame repose and equanimity,\" so that any expression from a stranger is\r\ncoldly listened to, without producing evident impression, _our_ surprise is\r\nchanged to wonder, and we are tempted to inquire, Can it be possible, that\r\nwe are such Spartans--endowed with such superior human stoicism?\r\n\r\n\"This coldness of the American is legibly impressed on his features. In\r\nboth sexes we frequently meet with pretty, and occasionally beautiful,\r\nfaces; but seldom, however, do we perceive in either, aught cheerful or\r\nattractive. In place thereof we observe, even in the fairest, a certain\r\nearnestness, verging towards coldness. From the great majority of faces we\r\nshould judge that no emotion could be made to express itself upon them, and\r\nsuch is truly the case.\r\n\r\n\"That the nearest acquaintances address each other with _Sir_ and _Master_,\r\nor _Miss_ and _Mistress_, and that husband and wife, parents and children,\r\nyes, even the children themselves employ these titles to each other, has\r\nundoubtedly much to do with their marked and cold demeanor. But this must\r\nhave a deeper ground than that merely caused by the use of distant forms of\r\nsalutation.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, the Americans are by no means of a bad disposition, since they\r\nare neither crafty and treacherous, nor revengeful, nor even prone to\r\ndistrust; on the contrary, quite peaceable, and by the better classes,\r\nthere is much charity for apparent misery; seldom does one suffering with\r\nbodily ailments leave the house of a wealthy man without being munificently\r\naided; the which charity is silently extended to him, without a sign of\r\nemotion. Those who are capable of work--no matter what the cause of their\r\nsufferings may be, seldom receive alms, for the Americans go upon the\r\nprinciple that work is not disgraceful, and without reflecting that the\r\napplicant may not have been accustomed to work, refuse in any manner to aid\r\nhim. If any man want work, he can apply to the overseers of the poor, who\r\nare obliged to receive him in a poor-house, and maintain him until he find\r\nsuch. Much is done at the state's expense for the aged, sick, and insane.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this our doctor lets fall a few flattering drops of commendation by\r\nway of admitting that this iron immobility of the American is not without\r\nits good points, but fearing that he has spoken too favorably, he brings up\r\nthe chapter by remarking that--\r\n\r\n\"The here-mentioned good traits in the American character can, however, by\r\nno means overbalance or destroy the evil impression which their coldness\r\nproduces, but merely soften it.\"\r\n\r\nFrom our appearance and deportment he proceeds to a bold, hasty, and\r\nremarkably superficial criticism of education in America. The father of a\r\nfamily in America, we are informed, is occupied with business from morning\r\nto night, and leaves all care for the education and training of his\r\nchildren to the mother, who is, however, generally quite incapable to\r\nfulfil such duty. No teacher dare correct a child, for fear of incurring\r\nlegal punishment, in consequence of which they grow up destitute of\r\ndecency, order, or obedience. Some few, indeed, find their way eventually\r\ninto academies and colleges, which are not so badly managed; but, as for\r\nschool-boys, since there is no one to insure their regular attendance at\r\nschool, they play truant _a discretion_. As for the children of the lower\r\nand middle classes, they pass their boyhood in idleness, and grow up in\r\nignorance, until at a later period they enter into business, when they are\r\ncompelled to perfect themselves in the arts of reading and writing, yet\r\nthey quickly acquire the business spirit of their fathers.\r\n\r\n\"The education of the girls is, however, of an entirely different nature.\r\nOn them the mothers expend much care and trouble, which is, however, of the\r\nmost perverted kind, since it is in its nature entirely external. Before\r\nall, do they seek to give them an air of decency and culture, which is,\r\nnevertheless, more apparent than real. In accordance with the republican\r\nspirit of striving after equality, every mother--no matter how poor, or how\r\nlow her rank may be--desires to bring her daughter up in such a manner that\r\nshe may be inferior in respectability and external culture to no one.\" \"In\r\nfact, the daughters of the poorest workman bear themselves like those of\r\nthe richest merchant. In their mien we see a pride flashing forth, which\r\ncan hardly be surpassed by that of the haughtiest daughters of the highest\r\nGerman nobility. And that their daughters may in every respect equal those\r\nof others, we see poor men lavishing upon them their last penny; and while\r\nthe boys run in the streets, covered with ragged and dirty fragments of\r\nclothing, the sisters wear bonnets with veils, bearing parasols, and while\r\nat school, short dresses and drawers.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this fearful announcement, we are informed, that the poor girls\r\nprofit as little in school as their unhappy brothers, and that no regard is\r\npaid to their future destiny.\r\n\r\n\"Even after the maiden has left school, her mother instructs her in no\r\nfeminine employment, not even in domestic affairs, and least of all, in\r\ncookery. While the former lives, and the daughter remains unmarried, she\r\n(the mother,) attends to housekeeping, as far as the word can be taken in\r\nthe German sense, while her daughter passes the time in reading, more\r\nfrequently with bedecking herself, but generally in idleness. When the\r\ndaughter, however, marries, we may well imagine how a house is managed in\r\nsuch hands. The principal business henceforth is self-adornment and\r\nhousekeeping. All imaginable care is bestowed upon these branches, but none\r\nwhatever on any other. Cookery is of the lowest grade; nearly every day\r\nsees the same dishes, and those, also, which are prepared with the least\r\ntrouble. Very frequently, indeed, the husbands are obliged to prepare their\r\nmeals before and after their business hours. Knitting and spinning, either\r\nin town or country, is unknown; only manufactured or woven stockings are\r\nworn, and shirts are generally purchased ready-made in the shops.\" \"Washing\r\nis the only work which they undertake, and this is done by young ladies of\r\nwealthy family. This takes place every Monday, for there are very few\r\nfamilies who own linen sufficient for more than a single week's wear.\r\n\r\n\"So long as the father lives, his daughters stick to him, useless as they\r\nare, and heavy as the burden may be to him. It is _his_ business to see\r\nwhere the money comes from wherewith to nourish and decently clothe them:\r\non this account the servant girls in America generally consist of Irish,\r\nGermans, and blacks. Even these, taking pattern from their mistresses,\r\nrefuse to perform duties which are expected from every housemaid in\r\nGermany--for examples, boot-brushing, clothes-cleaning, and the bringing of\r\nwater across the way, as well as street and step-cleaning; for which reason\r\nwe often see respectable men performing these duties.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this terrible plague of daughters, and daughterly extravagance, the\r\ndoctor finds that poorer men in America are by no means as well off as\r\nwould be imagined from their high wages. \"The father with many daughters,\r\nso far from advancing in wealth, generally falls behind. Fearing the cost\r\nof a family, many men remain unmarried, and in no country in the world are\r\nthere so many old maids as in the United States.\" From which the author\r\nfinds that dreadful instances of immorality and infanticide result.\r\n\r\nFilial duty, he asserts, is unknown. When the son proposes emigration to\r\nanother place, or the undertaking of a new business, he announces it to his\r\nfather \"perhaps the evening before; while the daughters act in like manner\r\nas regards marriage, or, it may be, mention it to him for the first time\r\nafter it has really taken place--from which the custom results that parents\r\ngive their children no part of their property before death. Nothing is\r\nknown of a true family life, in which parents are intimately allied to\r\nchildren, or brothers and sisters to each other.\" We spare our readers the\r\nsneer at those writers who have praised the Americans in their domestic\r\nrelations, with which this veracious, high-minded, and unprejudiced chapter\r\nconcludes.\r\n\r\nIn science and art, we are sunk, it seems, almost beneath contempt; the\r\nformer being cultivated only so far as it is conducive to money-making. The\r\nprofessions of Divinity, Law, and Medicine, are badly and superficially\r\ntaught and acquired. \"There are, indeed,\" says the doctor, \"in New-York and\r\nPhiladelphia, institutions where the student has opportunities of becoming,\r\nif he will, an excellent physician; but these are far from being well\r\npatronized.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards general education, he asserts that, though a few professors in\r\nour colleges are highly educated men, this cannot be said of their pupils,\r\nsince the latter set no value on knowledge not directly profitable, \"and\r\nthe backward condition of ancient languages, natural science, even\r\ngeography, history and statistics, save as applicable to their own country,\r\nis really a matter of wonder.\"\r\n\r\nBut in the fine arts, it appears, we are sunk so far beneath contempt that\r\nwe really wonder that the doctor should have found it, in this particular,\r\nworth while to abuse us. \"There are but two monuments in all America worthy\r\nof mention, and both are in Baltimore. Philadelphia and New-York have\r\nnothing of the kind to show, though each city possesses two public squares\r\nor parks planted with trees, which are well adapted to receive such works\r\nof art, and where the eye sadly misses them.\" \"Public and private\r\ncollections of statues and pictures are altogether wanting, and the walls\r\nof the rich are generally devoid of paintings and copper-plate engravings.\r\nWhat they have generally consists of family portraits, or those of\r\nWashington and other presidents. But to dazzle the eye, we find in the\r\npossession of the wealthy, the most worthless pictures in expensive gold\r\nframes. Of late years a public gallery has been established in New-York for\r\nthe sale of such productions. As far however as the works of native artists\r\nare concerned, we find among them none inspired by high art; on the\r\ncontrary, they are generally, to the last degree, mediocre affairs, or mere\r\ndaubs (_wahre Klecksereien_) not worth hanging up; the better however are\r\nexaggerated and unnatural both in subject and color. This is also the case\r\nwith most of the copper-plate engravings exposed for sale in the French\r\nshop-windows, and which appear almost as if manufactured in Paris expressly\r\nfor the American taste. The inferior appreciation of art in the Americans\r\nand their delight in extravagance is particularly shown in the political\r\ncaricatures, which are entirely deficient in all refined wit, consisting\r\neither of stupid allusions to eminent men or party leaders, or direct and\r\nclumsy exaggerations.\"\r\n\r\nBy way of amends for all this abuse, our author admits that we excel in all\r\npractical arts and labor-saving inventions. \"But in proportion to the\r\nbackward state of the fine arts, is the advance which the Americans have\r\nmade in all pertaining to mechanics, and technical art. Particular\r\nattention is paid to the supplanting of hand labor by machinery. Even the\r\nmost trifling apparatus or tool is constructed with regard to practical\r\nuse, and it only needs a more careful observation of this to convince us\r\nthat in all such matters they have the advantage of Germany.\r\n\r\n\"It is often truly startling to see how simply and usefully those articles\r\nused in business are constructed--for example, the one-horse cars (_drays\r\nor trucks?_) and hand-carts, employed in conveying merchandise to and from\r\nstores. As a proof how far the Americans have advanced in mechanic arts, we\r\nmay mention that high houses, of wood or brick, several stories high and\r\nentire, are transported on rollers to places several feet distant.\r\nOccasionally, to add a story, the house is raised by screws into the air\r\nand the building substructed. In either case the family remains quietly\r\ndwelling therein.\"\r\n\r\nBut alas, even these few rays of commendatory comfort vanish in the dark,\r\nafter reflection, that it is precisely this ingenuity and enterprise in\r\nbusiness and practical matters which unfits us for all the kinder and more\r\nsocial duties, and renders us insensible to every soothing and refining\r\ninfluence. No allowance for past events, unavoidable circumstances, or our\r\npossible future destiny, appears to cross the doctor's mind. All is dark\r\nand desolate. True, every man of high and low degree--the laborer and\r\nshop-man--the lawyer and clergyman, pause in the street to study any\r\nmechanical novelty which meets their eye--but ere they do this the doctor\r\nis mindful to suggest _that they pass picture shop-windows without deigning\r\nto glance therein_. The professions are studied like trades, and in matters\r\nof criminal law our condition is truly deplorable. It happened not many\r\nmonths since, he informs us, that the publisher of a slanderous New-York\r\npaper, was castigated by a lady, with a hunting whip, in Broadway, at noon.\r\nThe said lady had been (according to custom) unjustly and cruelly abused in\r\nthe journal referred to. So great was her irritation that she actually\r\nfollowed the editor along the streets, lashing him continually. But the\r\n_finale_ of this startling incident consists of the fact that the lady, on\r\npleading guilty, was fined six cents.\r\n\r\nThere is an obscurity attached to his manner of narrating this anecdote,\r\nwhich leaves the opinion of the author a little uncertain. Six cents would\r\nin some parts of Germany be a serious fine, worthy of appeal, mercy, and\r\nabatement. In different parts of Suabia and even Baden, notices may be seen\r\nposted up, in which the commission of certain local offences is prohibited\r\nby fines ranging from four to twelve cents. On the whole, as a zealous\r\ndefender of the purity and dignity of woman, when unjustly assailed, we are\r\ninclined to think that the author sides with _the_ LADY.\r\n\r\nBut we need not follow the doctor further in his career of discontent and\r\nprejudice. Before concluding, we would however caution the reader against\r\nsupposing that he expresses views in any degree accordant with the feelings\r\nand opinions of his countrymen. The best, the most numerous, the most\r\nimpartial, and we may add, by far the most favorable works on America, are\r\nfrom German pens. In confirmation of our assertion that his work is\r\nunfavorably regarded at home we may adduce the fact that it has been\r\nseverely handled by excellent reviewers among them; take for example the\r\nfollowing, from the Leipzig _Central Blatt_. After favorably noticing the\r\nlate excellent work of QUENTIN on the United States, he proceeds to say of\r\nthe doctor's _Sketches_, that\r\n\r\n\"HERR KIRSTEN seems to desire to be that for North America, which _Nicolai_\r\nof noted memory was in his own time for Italy. Already, on arrival, we find\r\nhim in ill temper, caused by the excessive heat, which ill-humor is\r\naggravated by his being obliged to make many calls by day, and _the\r\nmusquitoes and alarms of fire which disturbed his slumbers during the\r\nnight_. In other places he was no better pleased.\r\n\r\n\"The Germans were disagreeable on account of their want of unity, the\r\nAmericans from their coldness--in short, he missed home life--could not\r\naccustom himself to the new country, and returned after a sojourn of less\r\nthan two years to Germany. In 'sketches,' resulting from such\r\ncircumstances, we naturally encounter only the darker side of American\r\nlife. Much may indeed be true of what he asserts regarding the natural\r\ncapabilities, climate, soil, and inhabitants of the land, the manners and\r\ncustoms of the latter, their common and party spirit, education of\r\nchildren, and the condition of science and art; but particulars are either\r\ntoo hastily generalized, or else the better points, as for example, the\r\ncharacteristic traits of the people, their extraordinary progress in\r\nphysical and mental culture, and the excellent management of the country,\r\nare either entirely omitted or receive by far too slight notice. His\r\nnarrow-minded and ill-natured disposition to find fault is also shown by\r\nhis reproaching the Americans with faults which they share in common with\r\nevery nation in America, _ourselves included_, as, for example, excesses\r\ncommitted by political partisans. Still, the book may not be entirely\r\nwithout value, at least to those who see every thing on the other side of\r\nthe water only in a rosy light, and believe that the German emigrant as\r\nsoon as his foot touches shore, enters a state of undisturbed happiness.\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the critical doctor's popularity at home. In conclusion, we may\r\nremark that our main object in this notice, in addition to amusing our\r\nreaders, has been to prove by this exception, and the displeasure which it\r\nexcites in Germany, the rule, that by the writers of that country our own\r\nhas been almost invariably well spoken of. And we have deemed these remarks\r\nthe more requisite, lest some reader might casually infer that Dr. Kirsten\r\nexpressed the views and sentiments of any considerable number of his\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMINISCENCES OF THE LATE MR. COOPER.--HIS LAST DAYS.\r\n\r\nA LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL.\r\n\r\nBY JOHN W. FRANCIS, M. D., LL. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              NEW-YORK, _October 1st, 1851_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I readily comply with your wish that I should furnish you\r\nwith such reminiscences of the late Mr. Cooper as occur to me, although the\r\npressure of professional engagements absolutely forbids such details as I\r\nwould gladly record. For nearly thirty years I have been the occasional\r\nmedical adviser, and always the ardent personal friend of the illustrious\r\ndeceased; but our intercourse has been so fragmentary, owing to the\r\ndistance we have lived apart, and the busy lives we have both led, that the\r\nimpressions which now throng upon and impress me are desultory and varied,\r\nthough endearing. I first knew Mr. Cooper in 1823. He at that time was\r\nrecognized as the author of \"Precaution,\" of \"the Spy,\" and of \"the\r\nPioneers.\" The two last-named works had attracted especial notice by their\r\nwidely extended circulation, and the novelty of their character in American\r\nliterature. He was often to be seen at that period in conversation at the\r\nCity Hotel in Broadway, near Old Trinity, where many of our most renowned\r\nnaval and military men convened. He was the original projector of a\r\nliterary and social association called the \"Bread and Cheese Club,\" whose\r\nplace of rendezvous was at Washington Hall. They met weekly, in the\r\nevening, and furnished the occasion of much intellectual gratification and\r\ngenial pleasure. That most adhesive friend, the poet Halleck, Chancellor\r\nKent, G. C. Verplanck, Wiley, the publisher of Mr. Cooper's works, Dekay,\r\nthe naturalist, C. A. Davis (Jack Downing), Charles King, now President of\r\nColumbia College, J. Depeyster Ogden, J. W. Jarvis, the painter, John and\r\nWilliam Duer, and many others, were of the confederacy. Washington Irving,\r\nat the period of the formation of this circle of friends, was in England,\r\noccupied with his inimitable \"Sketch Book.\" I had the honor of an early\r\nadmittance to the Club. In balloting for membership the bread declared an\r\naffirmative; and two ballots of cheese against an individual proclaimed\r\nnon-admittance.\r\n\r\nFrom the meetings of this society Mr. Cooper was rarely absent. When\r\npresiding officer of the evening, he attracted especial consideration from\r\nthe richness of his anecdotes, his wide American knowledge, and his\r\ncourteous behavior. These meetings were often signally characterized by the\r\nnumber of invited guests of high reputation who gathered thither for\r\nrecreative purposes, both of mind and body; jurists of acknowledged\r\neminence, governors of different States, senators, members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, literary men of foreign distinction, and authors of repute\r\nin our own land. It was gratifying to observe the dexterity with which Mr.\r\nCooper would cope with some eastern friend who contributed to our delight\r\nwith a \"Boston notion,\" or with Trelawny, the associate of Byron,\r\ndescanting on Greece and the \"Younger Son,\" or with any guests of the Club,\r\nhowever dissimilar their habits or character; accommodating his\r\nconversation and manners with the most marvellous facility. The New-York\r\nattachments of Mr. Cooper were ever dominant. I witnessed a demonstration\r\nof the early enthusiasm and patriotic activity of our late friend in his\r\nefforts, with many of our leading citizens, in getting up the Grand Castle\r\nGarden Ball, given in honor of Lafayette. The arrival of the \"Nation's\r\nGuest\" at New-York, in 1824, was the occasion of the most joyful\r\ndemonstrations, and the celebration was a splendid spectacle; it brought\r\ntogether celebrities from many remote parts of the Union. Mr. Cooper must\r\nhave undergone extraordinary fatigue during the day and following night;\r\nbut nearly as he was exhausted, he exhibited, when the public festivals\r\nwere brought to a close, that astonishing readiness and skill in literary\r\nexecution for which he was always so remarkable. Adjourning near daybreak\r\nto the office of his friend Mr. Charles King, he wrote out more quickly\r\nthan any other hand could copy, the very long and masterly report which\r\nnext day appeared in Mr. King's paper--a report which conveyed to tens of\r\nthousands who had not been present, no inconsiderable portion of the\r\nenjoyment they had felt who were the immediate participants in this famous\r\nfestival. The manly bearing, keen intelligence, and thoroughly honorable\r\ninstincts of Mr. Cooper, united as they were with this gift of\r\nwriting--soon most effectively exhibited in his literary labors, now\r\nconstantly increasing--excited my highest expectations of his career as an\r\nauthor, and my sincere esteem for the man. There was a fresh promise, a\r\nvigorous impulse, and especially an American enthusiasm about him, that\r\nseemed to indicate not only individual fame, but national honor. Since that\r\nperiod I have followed his brilliant course with no less admiration than\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nIt was to me a cause of deep regret that soon after his return from Europe,\r\ncrowned with a distinct and noble reputation, he became involved in a\r\nseries of law-suits, growing out of libels, and originating partly in his\r\nown imprudence, and partly in the reckless severity of the press. But these\r\nare but temporary considerations in the retrospect of his achievements; and\r\nif I mistake not, in these difficulties he in every instance succeeded in\r\ngaining the verdict of the jury. It was a task insurmountable to overcome a\r\n_fact_ as stated by Mr. Cooper. Associated as he was in my own mind with\r\nthe earliest triumphs of American letters, I think of him as the creator of\r\nthe genuine nautical and forest romances of \"Long Tom Coffin\" and\r\n\"Leatherstocking;\" as the illustrator of our country's scenes and\r\ncharacters to the Europeans; and not as the critic of our republican\r\ninconsistencies, or as a litigant with caustic editors.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that for a long period Mr. Cooper, at occasional times\r\nonly, visited New-York city. His residence for many years was an elegant\r\nand quiet mansion on the southern borders of Otsego Lake. Here--in his\r\nbeautiful retreat, embellished by the substantial fruits of his labors, and\r\ndisplaying everywhere his exquisite taste, his mind, ever intent on\r\ncongenial tasks, which, alas! are left unfinished, surrounded by a devoted\r\nand highly cultivated family, and maintaining the same clearness of\r\nperception, serene firmness, and integrity of tone, which distinguished him\r\nin the meridian of his life--were his mental employments prosecuted. He\r\nlived chiefly in rural seclusion, and with habits of methodical industry.\r\nWhen visiting the city he mingled cordially with his old friends; and it\r\nwas on the last occasion of this kind, at the beginning of April, that he\r\nconsulted me with some earnestness in regard to his health. He complained\r\nof the impaired tone of the digestive organs, great torpor of the liver,\r\nweakness of muscular activity, and feebleness in walking. Such suggestions\r\nwere offered for his relief as the indications of disease warranted. He\r\nleft the city for his country residence, and I was gratified shortly after\r\nto learn from him of his better condition.\r\n\r\nDuring July and August I maintained a correspondence with him on the\r\nsubject of his increasing physical infirmities, and frankly expressed to\r\nhim the necessity of such remedial measures as seemed clearly necessary.\r\nThough occasionally relieved of my anxieties by the kind communications of\r\nhis excellent friend and attending physician, Dr. Johnson, I was not\r\nwithout solicitude, both from his own statements as well as those of Dr.\r\nJohnson himself, that his disorder was on the increase; certain symptoms\r\nwere indeed mitigated, but the radical features of his illness had not been\r\nremoved. A letter which I soon received induced me forthwith to repair to\r\nCooperstown, and on the 27th of August I saw Mr. Cooper at his own\r\ndwelling. My reception was cordial. With his family about him he related\r\nwith great clearness the particulars of his sufferings, and the means of\r\nrelief to which he was subjected. Dr. Johnson was in consultation. I at\r\nonce was struck with the heroic firmness of the sufferer, under an\r\naccumulation of depressing symptoms. His physical aspect was much altered\r\nfrom that noble freshness he was wont to bear; his complexion was pallid;\r\nhis interior extremities greatly enlarged by serous effusion; his debility\r\nso extreme as to require an assistant for change of position in bed; his\r\npulse sixty-four. There could be no doubt that the long continued hepatic\r\nobstruction had led to confirmed dropsy, which, indeed, betrayed itself in\r\nseveral other parts of the body. Yet was he patient and collected. That\r\npowerful intellect still held empire with commanding force, clearness, and\r\nvigor. I explained to him the nature of his malady; its natural termination\r\nwhen uncontrolled; dwelt upon the favorable condition and yet regular\r\naction of the heart, and other vital functions, and the urgent necessity of\r\nendeavoring still more to fulfil certain indications, in order to overcome\r\nthe force of particular tendencies in the disorder. I frankly assured him\r\nthat within the limits of a week a change in the complaint was\r\nindispensable to lessen our forebodings of its ungovernable nature.\r\n\r\nHe listened with fixed attention; and now and then threw out suggestions of\r\ncure such as are not unfrequent with cultivated minds.\r\n\r\nThe great characteristics of his intellect were now even more conspicuous\r\nthan before. Not a murmur escaped his lips; conviction of his extreme\r\nillness wrought no alteration of features; he gave no expression of\r\ndespondency; his tone and his manner were equally dignified, cordial, and\r\nnatural. It was his happiness to be blessed with a family around him whose\r\ngreatest gratification was to supply his every want, and a daughter for a\r\ncompanion in his pursuits, who was his intelligent amanuensis and\r\ncorrespondent as well as indefatigable nurse.[1]\r\n\r\nI forbear enlarging on matters too professional for present detail. During\r\nthe night after my arrival he sustained an attack of severe fainting, which\r\nconvinced me still further of his great personal weakness. An ennobling\r\nphilosophy, however, gave him support, and in the morning he had again been\r\nrefreshed by a sleep of some few hours' duration. I renewed to him and to\r\nhis family the hopes and the discouragements in his case. Never was\r\ninformation of so grave a cast received by any individual in a calmer\r\nspirit. He said little as to his prospects of recovery. Upon my taking\r\nleave of him, however, shortly after, in the morning, I am convinced from\r\nhis manner that he shared my apprehensions of a fatal termination of his\r\ndisorder. Nature, however strong in her gifted child, had now her healthful\r\nrights largely invaded. His constitutional buoyancy and determination, by\r\nleading him to slight that distant and thorough attention demanded by\r\nprimary symptoms, doubtless contributed to their subsequent aggravation.\r\n\r\nI shall say but a few words more on this agonizing topic. The letters which\r\nI received, after my return home, communicated at times some cheering facts\r\nof renovation, but on the whole, discouraging demonstrations of augmenting\r\nillness, and lessened hope, were their prominent characteristics. A letter\r\nto me from his son-in-law, of the 14th of September, announced: \"Mr. Cooper\r\ndied, apparently without much pain, to-day at half-past one, P.M., leaving\r\nhis family, although prepared by his gradual failure, in deep affliction.\r\nHe would have been sixty-two years old to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nA life of such uniform and unparalleled excellence and service, a career so\r\nbrilliant and honorable, closed in a befitting manner, and was crowned by a\r\ndeath of quiet resignation. Conscious of his approaching dissolution, his\r\nintelligence seemed to glow with increased fulness as his prostrated frame\r\nyielded by degrees to the last summons. It is familiarly known to his most\r\nintimate friends, that for some considerable period prior to his fatal\r\nillness, he appropriated liberal portions of his time to the investigation\r\nof scriptural truths, and that his convictions were ripe in Christian\r\ndoctrines. With assurances of happiness in the future, he graciously\r\nyielded up his spirit to the disposal of its Creator. His death, which must\r\nthus have been the beginning of a serene and more blessed life to him, is\r\nuniversally regarded as a national loss.\r\n\r\nWill you allow me to add a few words to this letter, already perhaps of\r\nundue extent. It has been my gratification during a life of some duration\r\nto have become personally acquainted with many eminent characters in the\r\ndifferent walks of professional and literary avocation. I never knew an\r\nindividual more thoroughly imbued with higher principles of action than Mr.\r\nCooper: he acted upon principles, and fully comprehended the principles\r\nupon which he acted. Casual observers could scarcely, at times, understand\r\nand appreciate his motives or conduct. An independence of character worthy\r\nof the highest respect, and a natural boldness of temper which led him to a\r\nfrank, emphatic, and intrepid utterance of his thoughts and sentiments,\r\nwere uncongenial to that large class of people, who, from the want of moral\r\ncourage, or a feeble physical temperament, habitually conform to public\r\nopinion, and endeavor to conciliate the world. Mr. Cooper was one of the\r\nmost genuine Americans in his tone of mind, in manly self-reliance, in\r\nsympathy with the scenery, the history, and the constitution of his\r\ncountry, which it has ever been my lot to know. His genius was American,\r\nfresh, vigorous, independent, and devoted to native subjects. The\r\nopposition he met with on his return from Europe, in consequence of his\r\npatriotic, though, perhaps, injudicious attempts to point out the faults\r\nand duties of his countrymen, threw him reluctantly on the defensive, and\r\nsometimes gave an antagonistic manner to his intercourse; but, whoever,\r\nrecognizing his intellectual superiority, and respecting his integrity of\r\npurpose, met him candidly, in an open, cordial and generous spirit, soon\r\nfound in Mr. Cooper an honest man, and a thorough patriot.\r\n\r\nHow strongly is impressed upon my memory his personal appearance, so often\r\nwitnessed during his rambles in Broadway and amidst the haunts of this busy\r\npopulation. His phrenological development might challenge comparison with\r\nthat of the most favored of mortals. His manly figure, high, prominent\r\nbrow, clear and fine gray eye, and royal bearing, revealed the man of will\r\nand intelligence. His intellectual hardihood was remarkable. He worked upon\r\na novel with the patient industry of a man of business, and set down every\r\nfact of costume, action, expression, local feature, and detail of maritime\r\noperations or woodland experience, with a kind of consciousness and\r\nprecision that produced a Flemish exactitude of detail, while in portraying\r\naction, he seemed to catch by virtue of an eagle glance and an heroic\r\ntemperament, the very spirit of his occasion and convey it to the reader's\r\nnerves and heart, as well as to his understanding. Herein Mr. Cooper was a\r\nman of unquestionable originality. As to his literary services, some idea\r\nmay be formed of the consideration in which they are held by the almost\r\ncountless editions of many of his works in his own country, and their\r\ncirculation abroad by translations into almost every living tongue.\r\n\r\nI may add a word or two on the extent of his sympathies with humanity. What\r\na love he cherished for superior talents in every ennobling pursuit in\r\nlife--how deep an interest he felt in the fortunes of his scientific and\r\nliterary friends--what gratification he enjoyed in the physical inquiries\r\nof Dekay and Le Conte, the muse of Halleck and of Bryant, the painting of\r\nCole, the sculpture of Greenough! Dunlap, were he speaking, might tell you\r\nof his gratuities to the unfortunate playwright and the dramatic performer.\r\nWith the mere accumulators of money--those golden calves whose hearts are\r\nas devoid of emotion as their brains of the faculty of cogitation--he held\r\nno congenial communion at any time: they could not participate in the\r\nfruition of his pastime; and he felt in himself an innate superiority in\r\nthe gifts with which nature had endowed him. He was ever vigilant, a keen\r\nobserver of men and things; and in conversation frank and emphatic. It was\r\na gratifying spectacle to encounter him with old Col. Trumbull, the\r\nhistorical painter, descanting on the many excellencies of Cole's pencil,\r\nin the delineation of American forest-scenery--a theme the richest in the\r\nworld for Mr. Cooper's contemplation. A Shylock with his money-bags never\r\nglutted over his possessions with a happier feeling than did these two\r\neminent individuals--the venerable Colonel with his patrician dignity, and\r\nCooper with his somewhat aristocratic bearing, yet democratic sentiment;\r\nthe one fruitful with the glories of the past, the other big with the\r\nstirring events of his country's progress, in the refinement of arts, and\r\nnational power. Trumbull was one of the many old men I knew who delighted\r\nin Cooper's writings, and who in conversation dwelt upon his captivating\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nTo his future biographer Mr. Cooper has left the pleasing duty rightly to\r\nestimate the breadth and depth of his powerful intellect--psychologically\r\nto investigate the development and functions of that cerebral organ, which\r\nfor so many years, with such rapid succession and variety, poured out the\r\ncreations of poetic thought and descriptive illustration--to determine the\r\nvalue of his capacious mind by the influence which, in the dawn of American\r\nliterature, it has exercised, in rearing the intellectual fabric of his\r\ncountry's greatness--and to unfold the secret springs of those\r\ndisinterested acts of charity to the poor and needy, which signalized his\r\nconduct as a professor of religious truth, and a true exampler of the\r\nChristian graces. He has unquestionably done more to make known to the\r\ntransatlantic world his country, her scenery, her characteristics, her\r\naboriginal inhabitants, her history, than all preceding writers. His death\r\nmay well be pronounced a national calamity. By common consent he long\r\noccupied an enviable place--the highest rank in American literature. To\r\nadopt the quaint phraseology of old Thomas Fuller, the felling of so mighty\r\nan oak must needs cause the increase of much underwood. Who will fill the\r\nvoid occasioned by his too early departure from among us, time alone must\r\ndetermine. With much consideration, I remain,\r\n\r\n                              Dear sir, yours most truly,\r\n                              JOHN W. FRANCIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC HONORS TO THE MEMORY OF MR. COOPER.\r\n\r\nIn the last number of the _International_ we were able merely to announce\r\nthe death of our great countryman Mr. Cooper. The following account of\r\nproceedings in reference to the event is compiled mainly from the _Evening\r\nPost_.\r\n\r\nA meeting of literary men, and others, was held at the City Hall in\r\nNew-York, on the 25th of September, for the purpose of taking the necessary\r\nmeasures for rendering fit honors to the memory of the deceased author.\r\nRufus W. Griswold, calling the meeting to order, said it had been convened\r\nto do justice to the memory of the most illustrious American who had died\r\nin the present century. Since the design of such a meeting had first been\r\nformed, a consultation among Mr. Cooper's friends had been held, and it had\r\nbeen determined that the present should be only a preparatory meeting, for\r\nthe making of such arrangements as should be thought necessary for a more\r\nsuitable demonstration of respect for that eminent person, whose name, more\r\ncompletely than that of any of his cotemporaries and countrymen, had filled\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Judge Duer, Washington Irving was elected President of the\r\nmeeting. On motion of Joseph Blunt, Fitz Greene Halleck and Rufus W.\r\nGriswold were appointed Secretaries.\r\n\r\nMr. Blunt said, that as it had been thought proper to consider this\r\noccasion as merely preliminary, and for the purpose of making arrangements\r\nto do honor to the distinguished author who has left us, he would move that\r\na committee of five be appointed by the chair, to report what measures\r\nshould be adopted, by the literary gentlemen of this city and of the\r\ncountry, so far as they may see fit to join them, for the purpose of\r\nrendering appropriate honors to the memory of the late J. Fenimore Cooper.\r\n\r\nThe motion was adopted, and the chair appointed the following gentlemen\r\nmembers of the committee: Judge Duer, Richard B. Kimball, Dr. Francis, Fitz\r\nGreene Halleck, and George Bancroft; to whom Washington Irving and Rufus W.\r\nGriswold were subsequently added. The meeting then adjourned.\r\n\r\nThis committee afterwards met and appointed as a General Committee to carry\r\nout the designs of the meeting: Washington Irving, James K. Paulding, John\r\nW. Francis, Gulian C. Verplanck, Charles King, Richard B. Kimball, Rufus\r\nW. Griswold, Lewis Gaylord Clarke, Francis L. Hawks, John A. Dix, George\r\nBancroft, Fitz Greene Halleck, John Duer, William C. Bryant, George P.\r\nMorris, Charles Anthon, Samuel Osgood, J. M. Wainright, and William W.\r\nCampbell.\r\n\r\nR. W. Griswold, Donald G. Mitchell, Parke Godwin, C. F. Briggs, and\r\nStarbuck Mayo were appointed a Committee of Correspondence.\r\n\r\nBesides letters from many of the gentlemen present, others had been\r\nreceived from some twenty of the most eminent literary men of the United\r\nStates, all expressing the warmest sympathy in the proposal to do every\r\npossible honor to the memory of Mr. Cooper. We copy from these the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n_From Washington Irving._\r\n\r\n                    SUNNYSIDE, Thursday, Sept. 18, 1851.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR:--The death of Fenimore Cooper, though\r\n     anticipated, is an event of deep and public concern,\r\n     and calls for the highest expression of public\r\n     sensibility. To me it comes with something of a shock;\r\n     for it seems but the other day that I saw him at our\r\n     common literary resort at Putnam's, in full vigor of\r\n     mind and body, a very \"castle of a man,\" and apparently\r\n     destined to outlive me, who am several years his\r\n     senior. He has left a space in our literature which\r\n     will not easily be supplied....\r\n\r\n     I shall not fail to attend the proposed meeting on\r\n     Wednesday next. Very respectfully, your friend and\r\n     servant,\r\n\r\n                              WASHINGTON IRVING.\r\n\r\n      Rev. RUFUS W. GRISWOLD.\r\n\r\n_From William C. Bryant._\r\n\r\n                              ROCHESTER, Friday, Sept. 19, 1851.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR:--I am sorry that the arrangements for my\r\n     journey to the West are such that I cannot be present\r\n     at the meeting which is about to be held to do honor to\r\n     the memory of Mr. Cooper, on losing whom not only the\r\n     country, but the civilized world and the age in which\r\n     we live, have lost one of their most illustrious\r\n     ornaments. It is melancholy to think that it is only\r\n     until such men are in their graves that full justice is\r\n     done to their merit. I shall be most happy to concur in\r\n     any step which may be taken to express, in a public\r\n     manner, our respect for the character of one to whom we\r\n     were too sparing of public distinctions in his\r\n     lifetime, and beg that I may be included in the\r\n     proceedings of the occasion as if I were present. I am,\r\n     very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n                              WM. C. BRYANT.\r\n\r\n     Rev. R. W. GRISWOLD.\r\n\r\n_From Bishop Doane._\r\n\r\n                              RIVERSIDE, Tuesday, Sept. 22, 1851.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR:--...I beg you to say, generally, in your\r\n     discretion, that I yield to no one who will be present,\r\n     in my estimate of the distinguished talents and\r\n     admirable services of Mr. Cooper, or in my readiness to\r\n     do the highest honor to his illustrious memory. His\r\n     name must ever find a place among the \"household words\"\r\n     of all our hearts; a name as beautiful for its\r\n     blamelessness of life, as it is eminent for its\r\n     attainments in letters, which has subordinated to the\r\n     higher interests of patriotism and piety, the fervors\r\n     of fancy and the fascinations of romance. Very\r\n     faithfully, your friend and servant,\r\n\r\n                              G. W. DOANE.\r\n\r\n     Rev. RUFUS W. GRISWOLD.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. Bancroft._\r\n\r\n                   NEWPORT, R. I., Thursday, Sept. 18, 1851.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR:--I heartily sympathize with the design of\r\n     a public tribute to the genius, manly character, and\r\n     great career of the illustrious man whose loss we\r\n     deplore. Others have combined very high merit as\r\n     authors, with professional pursuits. Mr. Cooper was, of\r\n     those who have gone from among us, the first to devote\r\n     himself exclusively to letters. We must admire the\r\n     noble courage with which he entered on a course which\r\n     none before him had tried; the glory which he justly\r\n     won was reflected on his country, of whose literary\r\n     independence he was the pioneer, and deserves the\r\n     grateful recognition of all who survive him.\r\n\r\n     By the time proposed for the meeting, I fear I shall\r\n     not be able to return to New-York; but you may use my\r\n     name in any manner that shall strongly express my\r\n     delight in the writings of our departed friend, my\r\n     thorough respect for his many virtues, and my sense of\r\n     that surpassing ability which has made his own name and\r\n     the names of the creations of his fancy, household\r\n     words throughout the civilized world. I remain, dear\r\n     sir, very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                              GEORGE BANCROFT.\r\n\r\n     Rev. R. W. GRISWOLD.\r\n\r\n_From John P. Kennedy._\r\n\r\n                              BALTIMORE, October, 1851.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR:--Your invitation reached me too late to\r\n     enable me to participate in the meeting which has just\r\n     been held at the City Hall in your city, to render\r\n     appropriate honors to the memory of Mr. Cooper.\r\n\r\n     I rejoice to see what has been done and what you\r\n     propose to do. It is due to the eminent merits of\r\n     Fenimore Cooper, that there should be an impressive\r\n     public recognition of the loss which our country has\r\n     sustained in his death. He stood confessedly at the\r\n     head of a most attractive and popular department of our\r\n     literature, in which his extraordinary success had\r\n     raised him up a fame that became national. The country\r\n     claimed it as its own. This fame was acknowledged and\r\n     appreciated not only wherever the English tongue is the\r\n     medium of thought, but every where amongst the most\r\n     civilized nations of Europe.\r\n\r\n     Our literature, in the lifetime of the present\r\n     generation, has grown to a maturity which has given it\r\n     a distinction and honorable place in that aggregate\r\n     which forms national character. No man has done more in\r\n     his sphere to elevate and dignify that character than\r\n     Fenimore Cooper: no man is more worthy than he, for\r\n     such services, of the highest honors appropriate to a\r\n     literary benefactor. His genius has contributed a rich\r\n     fund to the instruction and delight of his countrymen,\r\n     which will long be preserved amongst the choicest\r\n     treasures of American letters, and will equally induce\r\n     to render our national literature attractive to other\r\n     nations. We owe a memorial and a monument to the man\r\n     who has achieved this. This work is the peculiar\r\n     privilege of the distinguished scholars of New-York,\r\n     and I have no doubt will be warmly applauded, and if\r\n     need be, assisted, by every scholar and friend of\r\n     letters in the Union.\r\n\r\n     With the best wishes for the success of this\r\n     enterprise, I am, my dear sir, very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                              JOHN P. KENNEDY.\r\n\r\n     Rev. RUFUS W. GRISWOLD.\r\n\r\n_From C. J. Ingersoll._\r\n\r\n               FONTHILL, PHILADELPHIA, September, 30th, 1851.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR:--Your favor, inviting me to a meeting of the\r\n     friends of Fenimore Cooper, did not reach me till this\r\n     morning, owing probably to irregularity of the\r\n     post-office. Otherwise I should have tried to attend\r\n     the proposed meeting, not only as a friend of Mr.\r\n     Cooper, but as one among those of his countrymen who\r\n     consider his memory a national trust for honored\r\n     preservation.\r\n\r\n     In my opinion of Fenimore Cooper as a novelist he is\r\n     entitled to one merit to which few if any one of his\r\n     cotemporary European romance writers can lay claim, to\r\n     wit, originality. Leatherstocking is an original\r\n     character, and entirely American, which is probably one\r\n     of the reasons why Cooper was more appreciated in\r\n     Continental Europe than even Scott, whose magnificent\r\n     fancy embellished every thing, but whose genius, I\r\n     think, originated nothing. And then, in my estimate of\r\n     Mr. Cooper's superior merits, was manly independence--a\r\n     rare American virtue. For the less free Englishman or\r\n     Frenchman, politically, there was a freeness in the\r\n     expression as well as adoption of his own views of men\r\n     and things. And a third kindred merit of Cooper was\r\n     high-minded and gentlemanly abstinence from\r\n     self-applause. No distinguished or applauded man ever\r\n     was less apt to talk of himself and his performances.\r\n     Unlike too many modern poets, novelists, and other\r\n     writers, apt to become debauchees, drunkards,\r\n     blackguards and the like (as if, as some think, genius\r\n     and vice go together), Mr. Cooper was a gentleman\r\n     remarkable for good plain sense, correct deportment,\r\n     striking probity and propriety, and withal\r\n     unostentatiously devout. Not meaning to disparage any\r\n     one in order by odious comparisons to extol him, I deem\r\n     his Naval History a more valuable and enduring\r\n     historical work than many others, both English and\r\n     American, of contemporaneous publication and much wider\r\n     dissemination. In short, if the gentlemen whose names I\r\n     have seen in the public journals with yours, proposing\r\n     some concentrated eulogium, should determine to appoint\r\n     a suitable person, with time to prepare it, I believe\r\n     that Fenimore Cooper may be made the subject of\r\n     illustration in very many and most striking lights,\r\n     justly reflecting him, and with excellent influence on\r\n     his country.\r\n\r\n     I do not recollect, from what I read lately in the\r\n     newspapers, precisely what you and the other gentlemen\r\n     associated with you in this proceeding propose to do,\r\n     or whether any thing is to take place. But if so,\r\n     whatever and wherever it may be, I beg you to use this\r\n     answer to your invitation, and any services I can\r\n     render, as cordial contributions, which I shall be\r\n     proud and happy to make. I am very respectfully your\r\n     humble servant,\r\n\r\n                              C. J. INGERSOLL.\r\n\r\n     Rev. RUFUS W. GRISWOLD.\r\n\r\n_From G. P. R. James._\r\n\r\n                      STOCKBRIDGE, Mass., 23d September, 1851.\r\n\r\n     DEAR DOCTOR GRISWOLD:--I regret extremely that it will\r\n     not be in my power to be present at the meeting to\r\n     testify respect for the memory of Mr. Cooper. I grieve\r\n     sincerely that so eminent a man is lost to the country\r\n     and the world; and though unacquainted with him\r\n     personally, I need hardly tell you how highly his\r\n     abilities as an author, and his character, were\r\n     appreciated by yours faithfully,\r\n\r\n                              G. P. R. JAMES.\r\n\r\n_From Mr. Everett._\r\n\r\n                              CAMBRIDGE, 23d September, 1851.\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR:--I received this afternoon your favor of the\r\n     17th, inviting me to attend and participate in the\r\n     meeting to be held in your City Hall, for the purpose\r\n     of doing honor to the memory of the late Mr. Fenimore\r\n     Cooper.\r\n\r\n     I sincerely regret that I cannot be with you. The state\r\n     of the weather puts it out of my power to make the\r\n     journey. The object of the meeting has my entire\r\n     sympathy. The works of Mr. Cooper have adorned and\r\n     elevated our literature. There is nothing more purely\r\n     American, in the highest sense of the word, than\r\n     several of them. In his department he is _facile\r\n     princeps_. He wrote too much to write every thing\r\n     equally well; but his abundance flowed out of a full,\r\n     original mind, and his rapidity and variety bespoke a\r\n     resolute and manly consciousness of power. If among his\r\n     works there were some which, had he been longer spared\r\n     to us, he would himself, on reconsideration, have\r\n     desired to recal, there are many more which the latest\r\n     posterity \"will not willingly let die.\"\r\n\r\n     With much about him that was intensely national, we\r\n     have but one other writer (Mr. Irving), as widely known\r\n     abroad. Many of Cooper's novels were not only read at\r\n     every fireside in England, but were translated into\r\n     every language of the European continent.\r\n\r\n     He owed a part of his inspiration to the magnificent\r\n     nature which surrounded him; to the lakes, and forests,\r\n     and Indian traditions, and border-life of your great\r\n     state. It would have been as difficult to create\r\n     Leatherstocking anywhere out of New-York, or some state\r\n     closely resembling it, as to create Don Quixotte out of\r\n     Spain. To have trained and possessed Fenimore Cooper\r\n     will be--is already--with justice, one of your greatest\r\n     boasts. But we cannot let you monopolize the care of\r\n     his memory. We have all rejoiced in his genius; we have\r\n     all felt the fascination of his pen; we all deplore his\r\n     loss. You must allow us all to join you in doing honor\r\n     to the name of our great American novelist. I remain,\r\n     dear sir, with great respect, very truly yours,\r\n\r\n                              EDWARD EVERETT.\r\n\r\n     Rev. RUFUS W. GRISWOLD.\r\n\r\nLetters of similar import were received from Richard H. Dana, George\r\nTicknor, William H. Prescott, John Neal, and many other eminent men, all\r\napproving the design to render the highest honors to the illustrious\r\ndeceased.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the New-York Historical Society, on the evening of\r\nTuesday, the 7th of October, after the transaction of the regular business,\r\nthe following resolutions were moved by Rev. Rufus W. Griswold, and\r\nseconded by Mr. George Bancroft:--\r\n\r\n     _Whereas_, It has pleased Almighty God to remove from\r\n     this life our illustrious associate and countryman,\r\n     JAMES FENIMORE COOPER, while his fame was in its\r\n     fulness, and his intelligence was still unclouded by\r\n     age or any infirmity, therefore:\r\n\r\n     Resolved, That this society has heard of the death of\r\n     James Fenimore Cooper with profound regret:\r\n\r\n     That it recognizes in him an eminent subject and a\r\n     masterly illustrator of our history:\r\n\r\n     That, in his contributions to our literature he\r\n     displayed eminent genius and a truly national spirit:\r\n\r\n     That, in his personal character, he was honorable,\r\n     brave, sincere, and generous, as respectable for\r\n     unaffected virtue as he was distinguished for great\r\n     capacities:\r\n\r\n     That this society, appreciating the loss which,\r\n     however heavily it has fallen upon this country and\r\n     the literary world, has fallen most heavily upon his\r\n     family, instructs its officers to convey to his family,\r\n     assurances of respectful sympathy and condolence.\r\n\r\nDr. JOHN W. FRANCIS addressed the society in a very interesting speech, in\r\nsupport of these resolutions. Among the great men of letters, he said, whom\r\nour country has produced, there were none greater than Mr. Cooper. I knew\r\nhim for a period of thirty years, and during all that time I never knew any\r\nthing of his character that was not in the highest degree praiseworthy. He\r\nwas a man of great decision of character, and a fair expositor of his own\r\nthoughts on every occasion--a thorough American, for I never knew a man who\r\nwas more entirely so in heart and principle. He was able, with his vast\r\nknowledge, and a powerful physical structure, to complete whatever he\r\nattempted. He had studied the history of this country with a large\r\nphilosophy, and understood our people and their character better than any\r\nother writer of the age. He was not only perfectly acquainted with our\r\ngeneral history, but was thoroughly conversant with that of every state,\r\ncounty, village, lake, and river. And with his vast knowledge he was no\r\nless remarkable for ability as a historian than for his intrepidity of\r\npersonal character. I could not, said Dr. Francis, allow this opportunity\r\nto pass without paying my tribute to the merits of this truly great man.\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE BANCROFT next addressed the society. My friend, he said, has\r\nspoken of the illustrious deceased as an American--I say that he was an\r\nembodiment of the American feeling, and truly illustrated American\r\ngreatness. We were endeavoring to hold up our heads before the world, and\r\nto claim a character and an intellect of our own, when Cooper appeared with\r\nhis powerful genius to support our pretensions. He came forth imbued with\r\nAmerican life, and feeling, and sentiment. Another like Cooper cannot\r\nappear, for he was peculiarly suited to his time, which was that of an\r\ninvading civilization. The fame and honor which he gained, were not\r\nobtained by obsequious deference to public opinion, but simply by his great\r\nability and manly character. Great as he was in the department of romantic\r\nfiction, he was not less deserving of praise in that of history. In Lionel\r\nLincoln he has described the battle of Bunker Hill better than it is\r\ndescribed in any other work.\r\n\r\nIn his naval history of the United States he has left us the most masterly\r\ncomposition of which any nation could boast on a similar subject. Mr.\r\nBancroft proceeded in a masterly analysis of some of Mr. Cooper's\r\ncharacters, and ended with an impressive assertion of the purity of his\r\ncontributions to our literature, the eminence of his genius, and the\r\ndignity of his personal character.\r\n\r\nDr. HAWKS spoke with his customary eloquence of the personal character of\r\nMr. Cooper, his indefectible integrity, his devotion to the best interests\r\nof his country, and his religious spirit. He approved the resolutions which\r\nhad been offered to the society.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. SAMUEL OSGOOD said:\r\n\r\n     It must seem presumptuous in me, Mr. President, to try\r\n     to add any thing to the tribute which has been paid to\r\n     the memory of Cooper, by gentlemen so peculiarly\r\n     qualified from their experience and position to speak\r\n     of the man and his services. But all professions have\r\n     their own point of view, and I may be allowed to say a\r\n     few words upon the relation of our great novelist to\r\n     the historical associations and moral standards of our\r\n     nation. I cannot claim more than a passing acquaintance\r\n     with the deceased, and it belongs to friends more\r\n     favored to interpret the asperities and illustrate the\r\n     amenities which are likely to mark the character of a\r\n     man so decided in his make and habit. With his position\r\n     as an interpreter of American history and a delineator\r\n     of American character, we are in this society most\r\n     closely concerned. None in this presence, I am sure,\r\n     will rebuke me for speaking of the novelist as among\r\n     the most important agents of popular education,\r\n     powerful either for good or ill.\r\n\r\n     Is it not true, Sir, that the romance is the prose epic\r\n     of modern society, and that we now look to its pages\r\n     for the most graphic portraitures of men, manners, and\r\n     events? Social and political life is too complex now\r\n     for the stately march of the heroic poem, and this age\r\n     of print needs not the carefully measured verse to make\r\n     sentences musical to the ear, or to save them from\r\n     being mutilated by circulation. The romance is now the\r\n     chosen form of imaginative literature, and its gifted\r\n     masters are educators of the popular ideal. What epic\r\n     poem of our times begins to compare in influence over\r\n     the common mind with the stories of Scott and Cooper?\r\n     Our novelist loved most to treat of scenes and\r\n     characters distinctively national, and his name stands\r\n     indelibly written on our fairest lakes and rivers, our\r\n     grandest seas and mountains, our annals of early\r\n     sacrifice and daring. With some of his criticisms on\r\n     society, and some of his views of political and\r\n     historical questions, I have personally little\r\n     sympathy. But, when it is asked, in the impartial\r\n     standard of critical justice, what influence has he\r\n     exerted over the moral tone of American literature, or\r\n     to what aim has he wielded the fascinating pen of\r\n     romance, there can be but one reply. With him, fancy\r\n     has always walked hand in hand with purity, and the\r\n     ideal of true manhood, which is everywhere most\r\n     prominent in his works, is one of which we may well be\r\n     proud as a nation and as men.\r\n\r\n     The element of will, perhaps more strongly than\r\n     intellectual analysis, or exquisite sensibility, or\r\n     high imagination, is the distinguished characteristic\r\n     of his heroes, and in this his portraitures are good\r\n     types of what is strongest in the practical American\r\n     mind. His model man, whether forester, sailor, servant,\r\n     or gentleman, is always bent on bringing some especial\r\n     thing to pass, and the progress from the plan to the\r\n     achievement is described with military or naval\r\n     exactness. Yet he never overlooks any of the essential\r\n     traits of a noble manhood, and loves to show how much\r\n     of enterprise, courage, compassion, and reverence, it\r\n     combines with practical judgment and religious\r\n     principle.\r\n\r\n     It has seemed to me that his stories of the seas and\r\n     the forests are fitted to act more than ever upon the\r\n     strong hearts in training for the new spheres of\r\n     triumph which are now so wonderfully opening upon our\r\n     people. Who does not wish that his noted hero of the\r\n     backwoods might be known in every loghouse along our\r\n     extending frontier, and teach the rough pioneer always\r\n     to temper daring by humanity? Who can ever forget that\r\n     favorite character, as dear to the reader as to the\r\n     author--that paladin of the forest, that lion-heart of\r\n     the wilderness, Leatherstocking, fearless towards\r\n     man--gentle towards woman--a rough-cast gentleman of\r\n     as true a heart as ever beat under the red cross of the\r\n     crusader. The very qualities needed in those old times\r\n     of frontier strife are now needed for new emergencies\r\n     in our more peaceful border life, and our future\r\n     depends vastly upon the characters that give edge to\r\n     the advancing mass of our population now crowding\r\n     towards the rocky mountains and the Pacific coast. It\r\n     is well that this story-teller of the forest has been\r\n     so true to the best traits of our nature, and in so\r\n     many points is a moralist too. As a romancer of the\r\n     sea, Cooper's genius may perhaps be but beginning to\r\n     show its influence, as a new age of commercial\r\n     greatness is opening upon our nation.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Cooper did not shrink from battle scenes and had no\r\n     particular dread of gunpowder, yet his best laurels\r\n     upon the ocean have been won in describing feats of\r\n     seamanship and traits of manhood that need no bloody\r\n     conflict for their display, and may be exemplified in\r\n     fleets as peaceful and beneficent as ever spread their\r\n     sails to the breezes to bear kindly products to\r\n     friendly nations. As we sit here this evening under the\r\n     influence of the hour, the images of many a famous\r\n     exploit on the water seems to come out from his\r\n     well-remembered pages and mingle themselves with recent\r\n     scenes of marine achievement. Has not the \"Water Witch\"\r\n     herself reappeared of late in our own bay, and laden\r\n     not with contraband goods, but a freight of\r\n     stout-hearted gentlemen, borne the palm as \"Skimmer of\r\n     the Seas,\" from all competitors in presence of the\r\n     royalty and nobility of England? And the Old Ironsides,\r\n     has not she come back again, more iron-ribbed than\r\n     ever--not to fight over the old battles which our naval\r\n     chronicler was so fond of rehearsing, but under the\r\n     name of the Baltic or (better omen) the Pacific, to win\r\n     a victory more honorable and encouraging than ever was\r\n     carried by the thundering broadsides of the noble old\r\n     Constitution! The commanders and pilots so celebrated\r\n     by the novelist, have they not successors indomitable\r\n     as they? and just now our ship-news brings good tidings\r\n     of their achievements, as they tell us of the Flying\r\n     Cloud that has made light of the storms of the fearful\r\n     southern cape, and of the return of the adventurous\r\n     fleet that has stood so well the hug of the Polar\r\n     icebergs, and shown how nobly a crew may hunt for men\r\n     on the seas with a Red Rover's daring and a Christian's\r\n     mercy.\r\n\r\n     It is well that the most gifted romancer of the sea is\r\n     an American, and that he is helping us to enact the\r\n     romance of history so soon to be fact. The empire of\r\n     the waters, which in turn has belonged to Tyre, Venice,\r\n     and England, seems waiting to come to America, and no\r\n     part of the world now so justly claims its possession\r\n     as that state in which Cooper had his home. Who does\r\n     not welcome the promise of the new age of powerful\r\n     commerce and mental blessing? Who does not feel\r\n     grateful to any man who gives any good word or work to\r\n     the emancipation of the sailor from his worst enemies,\r\n     and to the freedom of the seas from all the violence\r\n     that stains its benignant waters? While proud of our\r\n     fleet ships, let us not forget elements in their\r\n     equipment more important than oak and iron. In this age\r\n     of merchandise, let us adorn peace with something of\r\n     the old manhood that took from warfare some of its\r\n     horrors. Did time allow, I might try to illustrate the\r\n     power of an attractive literature in keeping alive\r\n     national associations and moulding national character,\r\n     but I am content to leave these few fragmentary words\r\n     with the society as my poor tribute to a writer who\r\n     charmed many hours of my boyhood, and who has won\r\n     regard anew as the entertaining and instructive\r\n     beguiler of some recent days of rural recreation. May\r\n     we not sincerely say that he has so used the treasures\r\n     of our national scenery and history as to elevate the\r\n     true ideal of true manhood, and quicken the nation's\r\n     memory in many respects auspiciously for the nation's\r\n     hopes?\r\n\r\nIt is understood that a public discourse on the life and genius of Mr.\r\nCooper will be delivered by one of the most eminent of his contemporaries,\r\nat Tripler Hall, early in December, and that measures will be adopted to\r\nsecure the erection of a suitable monument to his memory in one of the\r\npublic squares or parks of the city. On this subject Mr. Washington Irving\r\nhas written the following letter:\r\n\r\n                              SUNNYSIDE, October, 1851.\r\n\r\n     MY DEAR SIR:--My occupations in the country prevent my\r\n     attendance in town at the meeting of the committee, but\r\n     I am anxious to know what is doing. I signified at our\r\n     first meeting what I thought the best monument to the\r\n     memory of Mr. Cooper--a statue. It is the simplest,\r\n     purest, and most satisfactory--perpetuating the\r\n     likeness of the person. I understand there is an\r\n     excellent bust of Mr. Cooper extant, made when he was\r\n     in Italy. He was there in his prime; and it might\r\n     furnish the model for a noble statue. Judge Duer\r\n     suggested that his monument should be placed at\r\n     Washington, perhaps in the Smithsonian Institute. I was\r\n     rather for New-York, as he belonged to this State, and\r\n     the scenes of several of his best works were laid in\r\n     it. Besides, the seat of government may be changed, and\r\n     then Washington would lose its importance; whereas\r\n     New-York must always be a great and growing\r\n     metropolis--the place of arrival and departure for this\r\n     part of the world--the great resort of strangers from\r\n     abroad, and of our own people from all parts of the\r\n     Union. One of our beautiful squares would be a fine\r\n     situation for a statue. However, I am perhaps a little\r\n     too local in my notions on this matter. Cooper\r\n     emphatically belongs to the nation, and his monument\r\n     should be placed where it would be most in public view.\r\n     Judge Duer's idea therefore may be the best. There will\r\n     be a question of what material the statue (if a statue\r\n     is determined on) should be made. White marble is the\r\n     most beautiful, but how would it stand our climate in\r\n     the open air? Bronze stands all weathers and all\r\n     climates, but does not give so clearly the expression\r\n     of the countenance, when regarded from a little\r\n     distance.\r\n\r\n     These are all suggestions scrawled in haste, which I\r\n     should have made if able to attend the meeting of the\r\n     committee. I wish you would drop me a line to let me\r\n     know what is done or doing.\r\n\r\n                              Yours very truly,\r\n\r\n                              WASHINGTON IRVING.\r\n\r\n     The Rev. RUFUS GRISWOLD.\r\n\r\nThe plan thus recommended by Mr. Irving will undoubtedly be approved by the\r\ncommittee and the public, and there is little doubt that it will soon be\r\ncarried into execution.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The accomplished authoress of \"Rural Hours.\"--_Ed. International._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LONDON TIMES ON AMERICAN INTERCOMMUNICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are by no means confident that the Mexican War, with all its victories,\r\nwas more serviceable to our reputation in Europe, than the single victory\r\nof Mr. Stevens, in his yacht America, off the Isle of Wight. This triumph\r\nhas been celebrated in a dinner at the Astor House, but the city might have\r\nwell afforded to welcome the returning owner of the America with an\r\nillumination, or the fathers, in council assembled, might have voted him a\r\nstatue. Mr. Collins and Mr. Stevens have together managed to deprive\r\nEngland of the \"trident of the seas,\" and as soon as it was transferred\r\nthere began a shower of honors, which continues still, from the _Times_\r\ndown to the very meanest of its imitators. From that time the Americans\r\nhave had all the \"solid triumphs\" in the Great Exhibition. We have been\r\nregarded as a wonderful people, and our institutions as the most\r\ninteresting study that is offered for contemporary statesmen and\r\nphilosophers. We copy below a specimen of the leaders with which the\r\n_Times_ has honored us, and commend it to our readers, not more for its\r\ntone than for the valuable information contained in it:--\r\n\r\n     LOCOMOTION BY RIVER AND RAILWAY IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n     England has been so dazzled by the splendor of her own\r\n     achievements in the creation of a new art of transport\r\n     by land and water within the last thirty years, as to\r\n     become in a measure insensible to all that has been\r\n     accomplished in the same interval and in the same\r\n     department of the arts elsewhere, improvements less\r\n     brilliant, indeed, intrinsically, than the stupendous\r\n     system of inland transport, which we lately noticed in\r\n     these columns, and having a lustre mitigated to our\r\n     view by distance, yet presenting in many respects\r\n     circumstances and conditions which may well excite\r\n     profound and general interest, and even challenge a\r\n     respectful comparison with the greatest of those\r\n     advances in the art of locomotion of which we are most\r\n     justly proud.\r\n\r\n     It will not, therefore, be without utility and\r\n     interest, after the detailed notice which we have\r\n     lately given of our own advances in the adaptation of\r\n     steam to locomotion, to direct attention to the\r\n     progress in the same department which has been\r\n     simultaneously made in other and distant countries, and\r\n     first, and above all, by our friends and countrymen in\r\n     the other hemisphere.\r\n\r\n     The inland transport of the United States is\r\n     distributed mainly between the rivers, the canals, and\r\n     the railways, a comparatively small fraction of it\r\n     being executed on common roads. Provided with a system\r\n     of natural water communication on a scale of magnitude\r\n     without any parallel in the world, it might have been\r\n     expected that the \"sparse\" population of this recently\r\n     settled country might have continued for a long period\r\n     of time satisfied with such an apparatus of transport.\r\n     It is, however, the character of man, but above all of\r\n     the Anglo-Saxon man, never to rest satisfied with the\r\n     gifts of nature, however munificent they be, until he\r\n     has rendered them ten times more fruitful by the\r\n     application of his skill and industry, and we find\r\n     accordingly that the population of America has not only\r\n     made the prodigious natural streams which intersect its\r\n     vast territory over so many thousands of miles,\r\n     literally swarm with steamboats, but they have,\r\n     besides, constructed a system of canal navigation,\r\n     which may boldly challenge comparison with any thing of\r\n     the same kind existing in the oldest, wealthiest, and\r\n     most civilized States of Europe.\r\n\r\n     It appears from the official statistics that, on the\r\n     1st of January, 1843, the extent of canals in actual\r\n     operation amounted to 4,333 miles and that there were\r\n     then in progress 2,359 miles, a considerable portion of\r\n     which has since been completed, so that it is probable\r\n     that the actual extent of artificial water\r\n     communication now in use in the United States\r\n     considerably exceeds 5,000 miles. The average cost of\r\n     executing this prodigious system of artificial water\r\n     communication was at the rate of 6,432_l._ per mile, so\r\n     that 5,000 miles would have absorbed a capital of above\r\n     32,000,000_l._\r\n\r\n     This extent of canal transport, compared with the\r\n     population, exhibits in a striking point of view the\r\n     activity and enterprise which characterize the American\r\n     people. In the United States there is a mile of canal\r\n     navigation for every 5,000 inhabitants, while in\r\n     England the proportion is 1 to every 9,000 inhabitants,\r\n     and France 1 to every 13,000. The ratio, therefore, of\r\n     this instrument of intercommunication in the United\r\n     States is greater than in the United Kingdom, in\r\n     proportion to the population, as 9 to 5, and greater\r\n     than in France in the ratio of 13 to 5.\r\n\r\n     The extent to which the American people have\r\n     fertilized, so to speak, the natural powers of those\r\n     vast collections of water which surround and intersect\r\n     their territory, is not less remarkable than their\r\n     enterprise in constructing artificial lines of water\r\n     communication. Besides the internal communication\r\n     supplied by the rivers, properly so called, a vast\r\n     apparatus of liquid transport is derived from the\r\n     geographical character of their extensive coast,\r\n     stretching over a space of more than 4,000 miles, from\r\n     the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the delta of the\r\n     Mississippi, indented and serrated with natural harbors\r\n     and sheltered bays, fringed with islands forming\r\n     sounds, throwing out capes and promontories which\r\n     inclose arms of the sea in which the waters are free\r\n     from the roll of the ocean, and which, for all the\r\n     purposes of navigation, have the character of rivers\r\n     and lakes. The lines of communication formed by the\r\n     vast and numerous rivers are, moreover, completed in\r\n     the interior by chains of lakes presenting the most\r\n     extensive bodies of fresh water in the known world.\r\n\r\n     Whatever question may be raised on the conflicting\r\n     claims for the invention of steam navigation, it is an\r\n     incontestable fact that the first steamboat practically\r\n     applied for any useful purpose was placed on the\r\n     Hudson, to ply between New-York and Albany, in 1808;\r\n     and, from that time to the present that river has been\r\n     the theatre of the most remarkable series of\r\n     experiments of locomotion on water ever recorded in the\r\n     history of man. The Hudson is navigable by steamers of\r\n     the largest class as high as Albany, a distance of\r\n     nearly 150 miles from New-York. The steam navigation\r\n     upon this river is entitled to attention, not only\r\n     because of the immense traffic of which it is the\r\n     vehicle, but because it forms a sort of model for all\r\n     the rivers of the Atlantic States. Two classes of\r\n     steamers work upon it--one appropriated to the swift\r\n     transport of passengers, and the other to the towing of\r\n     the vast traffic which is maintained between the city\r\n     of New-York and the interior of the State of that name,\r\n     into the heart of which the Hudson penetrates.\r\n\r\n     The passenger steamers present a curious contrast to\r\n     the sea-going steamers with which we are familiar. Not\r\n     having to encounter the agitated surface of the ocean,\r\n     they are supplied with neither rigging nor sails, are\r\n     built exclusively with a view to speed, are slender and\r\n     weak in their structure, with great length in\r\n     proportion to their beam, and have but small draught of\r\n     water. The position and form of the machinery are\r\n     peculiar. The engines are placed on deck in a\r\n     comparatively elevated situation. It is but rarely that\r\n     two engines are used. A single engine placed in the\r\n     centre of the deck drives a crank constructed on the\r\n     axle of the enormous paddle-wheels, the magnitude of\r\n     which, and the velocity imparted to them, enable them\r\n     to perform the office of fly-wheels. These vessels,\r\n     which are of great magnitude, are splendidly fitted up\r\n     for the accommodation of passengers, and have been\r\n     within the last ten or twelve years undergoing a\r\n     gradual augmentation of magnitude, to which it would\r\n     seem to be difficult to set a limit.\r\n\r\n     In the following table, which we borrow from the work\r\n     on _Railway Economy_, from which we have already\r\n     derived so large a portion of our information, are\r\n     given the dimensions and the details of fourteen of the\r\n     principal steamers plying on the Hudson in the year  1838:--\r\n\r\n             |Length of deck.\r\n             |    |Breadth of beam.\r\n             |    |    |Draught.\r\n             |    |    |    |Diameter of wheels.\r\n             |    |    |    |    |Length of paddles.\r\n             |    |    |    |    |    |Depth of paddles.\r\n             |    |    |    |    |    |   |Number of engines.\r\n             |    |    |    |    |    |   |  |Diameter of cylinder.\r\n             |    |    |    |    |    |   |  |    |Length of stroke.\r\n             |    |    |    |    |    |   |  |    |    |Number of\r\n             |    |    |    |    |    |   |  |    |    |revolutions.\r\n             |    |    |    |    |    |   |  |    |    |    |Part of stroke\r\n             |    |    |    |    |    |   |  |    |    |    |at which steam\r\nNames.       |    |    |    |    |    |   |  |    |    |    |is cut off.\r\n-------------+----+----+----+----+----+---+--+----+----+----+-----+\r\n             | ft.| ft.| ft.| ft.| ft.|ft.|  | in.| ft.|    |     |\r\nDewit Clinton| 230|28  |5.5 |21  |13.7|36 |1 |65  | 10 |29  |.75  |\r\nChamplain    | 180|27  |5.5 |22  |15  |34 |2 |44  | 10 |27.5|.50  |\r\nErie         | 180|27  |5.5 |22  |15  |34 |2 |44  | 10 |27.5|.50  |\r\nNorth America| 200|30  |5   |21  |13  |30 |2 |44.5|  8 |24  |.50  |\r\nIndependence | 148|26  | -- | -- | -- |-- |1 |44  | 10 | -- | --  |\r\nAlbany       | 212|26  | -- |24.5|14  |30 |1 |65  | -- |19  | --  |\r\nSwallow      | 233|22.5|3.75|24  |11  |30 |1 |46  | -- |27  | --  |\r\nRochester    | 200|25  |3.75|23.5|10  |24 |1 |43  | 10 |28  | --  |\r\nUtica        | 200|21  |3.5 |22  | 9.5|24 |1 |39  | 10 | -- | --  |\r\nProvidence   | 180|27  |9   | -- | -- |-- |1 |65  | 10 | -- | --  |\r\nLexington    | 207|21  | -- |23  | 9  |30 |1 |48  | 11 |24  | --  |\r\nNarraganset  | 210|26  |5   |25  |11  |30 |1 |60  | 12 |20  |.50  |\r\nMassachusetts| 200|29.5|8.5 |22  |10  |28 |2 |44  |  8 |26  | --  |\r\nRhode Island | 210|26  |6.5 |24  |11  |30 |1 |60  | 11 |21  | --  |\r\n             +----+----+----+----+----+---+--+----+----+----+-----+\r\nAverages     | 200|26  |5.6 |24.8|11  |30 |--|50.8| 10 |24.8| --  |\r\n-------------+----+----+----+----+----+---+--+----+----+----+-----+\r\n\r\n     The changes more recently made all have a tendency to\r\n     increase the magnitude and power of those vessels--to\r\n     diminish their draught of water--and to increase the\r\n     play of the expansive principle. Vessels of the largest\r\n     class now draw only as much water as the smallest drew\r\n     a few years ago, four feet five inches being regarded\r\n     as the _maximum_.\r\n\r\n     It appears from the following table that the average\r\n     length of these prodigious floating hotels is above 300\r\n     feet; some of them approaching 400. In the passenger\r\n     accommodation afforded by them no water communication\r\n     in any country can compete. Nothing can exceed the\r\n     splendor and luxury with which they are fitted up,\r\n     furnished, and decorated. Silk, velvet, the most costly\r\n     carpetings and upholstery, vast mirrors, gilding, and\r\n     carving, are profusely displayed in their decoration.\r\n     Even the engine-room in some of them is lined with\r\n     mirrors. In the Alida, for example, the end of the\r\n     engine-room is one vast mirror, in which the movements\r\n     of the brilliant and highly-finished machinery are\r\n     reflected. All the largest class are capable of running\r\n     from twenty to twenty-two miles an hour, and average\r\n     nearly twenty miles without difficulty.\r\n\r\n     In the annexed table are exhibited the details of ten\r\n     of the most recently constructed passenger  vessels:--\r\n\r\n---------------+------------------------+----------------+------------------\r\n               |    DIMENSIONS OF       |     ENGINE.    |   PADDLE-\r\n               |       VESSEL.          |                |   WHEEL.\r\n               +------------------------+----------------+------------------\r\n               |                        |Diameter of     |\r\n               |                        |cylinder.       |\r\n               |Length.                 |   |Length of   |Diameter.\r\n               |    |Breadth.           |   |stroke.     |    |Length of\r\n               |    |     |Depth of     |   |   |Number  |    |bucket.\r\nNames.         |    |     |Hold.        |   |   |of      |    |    |Depth of\r\n               |    |     |    |Tonnage.|   |   |strokes.|    |    |bucket.\r\n---------------+----+-----+----+--------+---+---+--------+----+----+--------\r\n               | ft.| ft. | ft.|        |in.|ft.|        | ft.|ft. | in.\r\nIsaac Newton   |333 |40.4 |10.0|        |81 |12 | 18-1/2 |39.0|12.4| 32\r\nBay State      |300 |39.0 |13.2|        |76 |12 | 21-1/2 |38.0|10.3| 32\r\nEmpire State   |304 |39.0 |13.6|        |76 |12 | 21-1/2 |38.0|10.3| 32\r\nOregon         |308 |35.0 | -- |        |72 |11 | 18     |34.0|11.0| 28\r\nHendrick Hudson|320 |35.0 | 9.6| 1,050  |72 |11 | 22     |33.0|11.0| 33\r\nC.

During the last ten\r\n     years not a single catastrophe of this kind has been\r\n     recorded, although cylindrical boilers ten feet in\r\n     diameter, composed of plating 5-16ths of an inch thick,\r\n     are commonly used with steam of 50lb. pressure.\r\n\r\n     Previously to 1844 the lowest fare from New-York to\r\n     Albany, a distance of 145 miles, was 4s. 4d.; at\r\n     present the fare is 2s. 2d.--and for an additional sum\r\n     of the same amount the passenger can command the luxury\r\n     of a separate cabin. When the splendor and magnitude of\r\n     the accommodation is considered, the magnificence of\r\n     the furniture and accessories, and the luxuriousness of\r\n     the table, it will be admitted that no similar example\r\n     of cheap locomotion can be found in any part of the\r\n     globe. Passengers may there be transported in a\r\n     floating palace, surrounded with all the conveniences\r\n     and luxuries of the most splendid hotel, at the average\r\n     rate of twenty miles an hour, for less than _one-sixth\r\n     of a penny per mile_! It is not an uncommon occurrence\r\n     during the warm season to meet persons on board these\r\n     boats who have lodged themselves there permanently, in\r\n     preference to hotels on the banks of the river. Their\r\n     daily expenses in the boat are as follows:\r\n\r\n        Fare                                       2_s._ 2_d._\r\n        Separate bedroom                              2   2\r\n        Breakfast, dinner, and supper                 6   6\r\n                                                      ------\r\n       Total daily expense for board, lodging,       10  10\r\n       attendance, and travelling 150 miles,\r\n       at 20 miles an hour\r\n\r\n     Such accommodation is, on the whole, more economical\r\n     than a hotel. The bedroom is as luxuriously furnished\r\n     as the handsomest chamber in an hotel or private house,\r\n     and is much more spacious than the room similarly\r\n     designated in the largest packet ships.\r\n\r\n     The other class of steamers, used for towing the\r\n     commerce of the river, corresponds to the goods trains\r\n     on railways. No spectacle can be more remarkable than\r\n     this class of locomotive machines, dragging their\r\n     enormous load up the Hudson. They may be seen in the\r\n     midst of this vast stream, surrounded by a cluster of\r\n     twenty or thirty loaded craft of various magnitudes.\r\n     Three or four tiers are lashed to them at each side,\r\n     and as many more at their bow and at their stern. The\r\n     steamer is almost lost to the eye in the midst of this\r\n     crowd of vessels which cling around it, and the moving\r\n     mass is seen to proceed up the river, no apparent agent\r\n     of propulsion being visible, for the steamer and its\r\n     propellers are literally buried in the midst of the\r\n     cluster which clings to it and floats round and near\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     As this _water-goods train_, for so it may be called,\r\n     ascends the river, it drops off its load, vessel by\r\n     vessel, at the towns which it passes. One or two are\r\n     left at Newburgh, another at Poughkeepsie, two or three\r\n     more at Hudson, one or two at Fishkill, and, finally,\r\n     the tug arrives with a residuum of some half-dozen\r\n     vessels at Albany.\r\n\r\n     The steam navigation of the Mississippi and the other\r\n     western rivers is conducted in a manner entirely\r\n     different from that of the Hudson. Every one must be\r\n     familiar with the lamentable accidents which happen\r\n     from time to time, and the loss of life from explosion\r\n     which continually takes place on those rivers. Such\r\n     catastrophes, instead of diminishing with the\r\n     improvement of art, seem rather to have increased.\r\n     Engineers have done literally nothing to check the\r\n     evil.\r\n\r\n     In a Mississippi steamboat the cabins and saloons are\r\n     erected on a flooring six or eight feet above the deck,\r\n     upon which and under them the engines are placed, which\r\n     are of the coarsest and most inartificial structure.\r\n     They are invariably worked with high-pressure steam,\r\n     and in order to obtain that effect which in the Hudson\r\n     steamers is due to a vacuum, the steam is worked at an\r\n     extraordinary pressure. We have ourselves actually\r\n     witnessed boilers of this kind, on the western rivers,\r\n     working under a full pressure of 120lb. per square inch\r\n     above the atmosphere, and we have been assured that\r\n     this pressure has been recently considerably increased,\r\n     so that it is not unfrequent now to find them working\r\n     with a bursting pressure of 200lb. per square inch!\r\n\r\n     As might naturally be expected, the chief theatre of\r\n     railway enterprise in America is the Atlantic States.\r\n     The Mississippi and its tributaries have served the\r\n     purposes of commerce and intercommunication to the\r\n     comparatively thinly scattered population of the\r\n     Western States so efficiently that many years will\r\n     probably elapse, notwithstanding the extraordinary\r\n     enterprise of the people, before any considerable\r\n     extent of railway communication will be established in\r\n     this part of the States. Nevertheless, the traveller in\r\n     these distant regions encounters occasionally detached\r\n     examples of railways even in the valley of the\r\n     Mississippi. In the State of Mississippi there are five\r\n     short lines, ten or twelve in Louisiana, and a limited\r\n     number scattered over Florida, Alabama, Illinois,\r\n     Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. These, however, are\r\n     generally detached and single lines, unconnected with\r\n     the vast network which we shall presently notice. To\r\n     the traveller in these wild regions the aspect of such\r\n     artificial agents of transport in the midst of a\r\n     country, a great portion of which is still in the state\r\n     of native forest, is most remarkable, and strongly\r\n     characteristic of the irrepressible spirit of\r\n     enterprise of its people. Travelling in the back woods\r\n     of Mississippi, through native forests, where till\r\n     within a few years human foot never trod, through\r\n     solitudes, the silence of which was never broken, even\r\n     by the red man, we have been sometimes filled with\r\n     wonder to find ourselves transported by an engine\r\n     constructed at Newcastle-on-Tyne, and driven by an\r\n     artisan from Liverpool, at the rate of twenty miles an\r\n     hour. It is not easy to describe the impression\r\n     produced by the juxtaposition of these refinements of\r\n     art and science with the wildness of the country, where\r\n     one sees the frightened deer start from its lair at the\r\n     snorting of the ponderous machine and the appearance of\r\n     the snakelike train which follows it.\r\n\r\n     The first American railway was opened for passengers on\r\n     the last day of 1829. According to the reports\r\n     collected and given in detail in the work already\r\n     quoted, it appears that in 1849, after an interval of\r\n     just twenty years, there were in actual operation 6,565\r\n     miles of railway in the States. The cost of\r\n     construction and plant of this system of railways\r\n     appears by the same authority to have been\r\n     53,386,885_l._, being at the average rate of 8,129_l._\r\n     per mile.\r\n\r\n     The reports collected in Dr. Lardner's work come up to\r\n     the middle of 1849. We have, however, before us\r\n     documents which supply data to a more recent period,\r\n     and have computed from them the following table,\r\n     exhibiting the number of miles of railway in actual\r\n     operation in the United States, the capital expended in\r\n     their construction and plant, and the length of the\r\n     lines which are in process of construction, but not yet  completed:--\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                        |  Railways   |   Cost of    |  Projected  |Cost per\r\n                        |     in      | Building and |    and in   |   Mile.\r\n                        | operation.  |   Plant.     |   progress. |\r\n------------------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+--------\r\n                        |    Miles.   |      L       |    Miles.   |    L\r\nEastern States,         |             |              |             |\r\nincluding Maine, New    |             |              |             |\r\nHampshire, Vermont,     |             |              |             |\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode    |             |              |             |\r\nIsland, and  Connecticut|    2,845    |   23,100,987 |      567    |  8,123\r\n                        |             |              |             |\r\nAtlantic States,        |             |              |             |\r\nincluding New-York, the |             |              |             |\r\nJerseys, Pennsylvania,  |             |              |             |\r\nDelaware, and Maryland  |    3,503    |   27,952,500 |    2,020    |  7,979\r\n                        |             |              |             |\r\nSouthern States,        |             |              |             |\r\nincluding Virginia, the |             |              |             |\r\nCarolinas, Georgia,     |             |              |             |\r\nFlorida, and Alabama    |    2,103    |    8,253,130 |   1,283     |  3,919\r\n                        |             |              |             |\r\nWestern States,         |             |              |             |\r\nincluding Mississippi,  |             |              |             |\r\nLouisiana, Texas,       |             |              |             |\r\nTennessee, Kentucky,    |             |              |             |\r\nOhio, Michigan, Indiana,|             |              |             |\r\nIllinois, Missouri,     |             |              |             |\r\nIowa, and Wisconsin     |    1,835    |    7,338,290 |    5,762    |  3,999\r\n                        |-------------+--------------+-------------+--------\r\nTotals and averages     |   10,289    |   66,653,907 |    9,632    |  6,478\r\n------------------------+-------------+--------------+-------------+--------\r\n\r\n     It must be admitted that the results here exhibited\r\n     present a somewhat astonishing spectacle. It appears\r\n     from this statement that there are in actual operation\r\n     in the United States 10,289 miles of railway, and that\r\n     there are 9,632 projected and in process of execution.\r\n     So that when a few years more shall have rolled away,\r\n     this extraordinary people will actually have 20,000\r\n     miles of iron road in operation.\r\n\r\n     It appears from the above report, compared with the\r\n     previous report quoted from Dr. Lardner, that the\r\n     average cost of construction has been diminished as the\r\n     operations progressed. According to Dr. Lardner, the\r\n     average cost of construction of the 6,500 miles of\r\n     railway in operation in 1849 was 8,129_l._ per mile\r\n     whereas, it appears from the preceding table that the\r\n     actual cost of 10,289 miles now in operation has been\r\n     at the average rate of 6,478_l._ per mile. On\r\n     examining the analysis of the distribution of these\r\n     railways among the States, it appears that this\r\n     discordance of the two statements is apparent rather\r\n     than real, and proceeds from the fact that the railways\r\n     opened since Dr. Lardner's report, being chiefly in the\r\n     southern and western States, are cheaply constructed\r\n     lines, in which the landed proprietors have given to a\r\n     great extent their gratuitous co-operation, and in\r\n     which the plant and working stock is of very small\r\n     amount, so that their average cost per mile is a little\r\n     under 4,000_l._--the average cost per mile in the\r\n     eastern and northern States corresponding almost to a\r\n     fraction with Dr. Lardner's estimate. It is also worthy\r\n     of observation that the distribution of this network of\r\n     railways is extremely unequal, not only in quantity,\r\n     but in its capability, as indicated by its expense of\r\n     construction. Thus, in the populous and wealthy States\r\n     of Massachusetts, New-Jersey, and New-York, the\r\n     proportion of railways to surface is considerable,\r\n     while in the southern and western States it is\r\n     trifling. In the following table is given the number of\r\n     miles of surface for each mile of railway in some of\r\n     the principal  States:--\r\n\r\n          Square miles of surface for each mile of railway.\r\n\r\n     Massachusetts       7\r\n     New-Jersey         22\r\n     New-York           28\r\n     Maryland           31\r\n     Ohio               58\r\n     Georgia            76\r\n\r\n     When it is considered that the railways in this country\r\n     have cost upon an average about 40,000_l._ per mile,\r\n     the comparatively low cost of the American railways\r\n     will doubtless appear extraordinary.\r\n\r\n     This circumstance, however, is explained partly by the\r\n     general character of the country, partly by the mode of\r\n     constructing the railways, and partly by the manner of\r\n     working them. With certain exceptions, few in number,\r\n     the tracts of country over which these lines are\r\n     carried, is nearly a dead level. Of earthwork there is\r\n     but little; of works of art, such as viaducts and\r\n     tunnels, commonly none. Where the railways are carried\r\n     over streams or rivers, bridges are constructed in a\r\n     rude but substantial manner of timber supplied from the\r\n     roadside forest, at no greater cost than that of hewing\r\n     it. The station houses, booking offices, and other\r\n     buildings, are likewise slight and cheaply constructed\r\n     of timber. On some of the best lines in the more\r\n     populous States the timber bridges are constructed with\r\n     stone pillars and abutments, supporting arches of\r\n     trusswork, the cost of such bridges varying from 46s.\r\n     per foot, for 60 feet span, to 6_l._ 10s. per foot for\r\n     200 feet span, for a single line, the cost on a double\r\n     line being 50 per cent. more.\r\n\r\n     When the railways strike the course of rivers such as\r\n     the Hudson, Delaware, or Susquehanna--too wide to be\r\n     crossed by bridges--the traffic is carried by steam\r\n     ferries. The management of these ferries is deserving\r\n     of notice. It is generally so arranged that the time of\r\n     crossing them corresponds with a meal of the\r\n     passengers. A platform is constructed level with the\r\n     line of railway and carried to the water's edge. Upon\r\n     this platform rails are laid by which the wagons which\r\n     bear the passengers' luggage and other matters of light\r\n     and rapid transport are rolled directly upon the upper\r\n     deck of the ferry boat, the passengers meanwhile going\r\n     under a covered way to the lower deck. The whole\r\n     operation is accomplished in five minutes. While the\r\n     boat is crossing the spacious river the passengers are\r\n     supplied with their breakfasts, dinner, or supper, as\r\n     the case may be. On arriving at the opposite bank the\r\n     upper deck comes in contact with a like platform,\r\n     bearing a railway upon which the luggage wagons are\r\n     rolled; the passengers ascend, as they descended, under\r\n     a covered way, and, resuming their places in the\r\n     railway carriages, the train proceeds.\r\n\r\n     But the prudent Americans have availed themselves of\r\n     other sources of economy by adopting a mode of\r\n     construction adapted to the expected traffic. Formed to\r\n     carry a limited commerce the railways are generally\r\n     single lines, sidings being provided at convenient\r\n     situations. Collision is impossible, for the first\r\n     train that arrives at a siding must enter it and remain\r\n     there until the following train arrives. This\r\n     arrangement would be attended with inconvenience with a\r\n     crowded traffic like that of many lines on the English\r\n     railways, but even on the principal American lines the\r\n     trains seldom pass in each direction more than twice a\r\n     day, and their time and place of meeting is perfectly\r\n     regulated. In the structure of the roads, also,\r\n     principles have been adopted which have been attended\r\n     with great economy compared with the English lines. The\r\n     engineers, for example, do not impose on themselves the\r\n     difficult and expensive condition of excluding all\r\n     curves but those of large radius, and all gradients\r\n     exceeding a certain small limit of steepness. Curves of\r\n     500 feet radius, and even less, are frequent, and\r\n     acclivities rising at the rate of 1 foot in 100 are\r\n     considered a moderate ascent, while there are not less\r\n     than 50 lines laid down with gradients varying from 1\r\n     in 100 to 1 in 75, nevertheless these lines are worked\r\n     with facility by locomotives, without the expedient,\r\n     even, of assistant or stationary engines. The\r\n     consequences of this have been to reduce in an immense\r\n     proportion the cost of earthwork, bridges, and\r\n     viaducts, even in parts of the country where the\r\n     character of the surface is least favorable. But the\r\n     chief source of economy has arisen from the structure\r\n     of the line itself. In many cases where the traffic is\r\n     lightest the rails consist of flat bars of iron, 2-1/2\r\n     inches broad and 6-10ths of an inch thick, nailed and\r\n     spiked to planks of timber laid longitudinally on the\r\n     road in parallel lines, so as to form what are called\r\n     continuous bearings. Some of the most profitable\r\n     American railways, and those of which the maintenance\r\n     has proved least expensive, have been constructed in\r\n     this manner. The road structure, however, varies\r\n     according to the traffic. Rails are sometimes laid\r\n     weighing only from 25lb. to 30lb. per yard. In some\r\n     cases of great traffic they are supported on transverse\r\n     sleepers of wood like the European railways, but in\r\n     consequence of the comparative cheapness of wood and\r\n     the high price of iron, the strength necessary for the\r\n     road is mostly obtained by reducing the distance\r\n     between the sleepers so as to supersede the necessity\r\n     of giving greater weight to the rails.\r\n\r\n     The same observance of the principles of economy is\r\n     maintained with regard to their locomotive stock. The\r\n     engines are strongly built, safe and powerful, but are\r\n     destitute of much of that elegance of exterior and\r\n     beauty of workmanship which has excited so much\r\n     admiration, in the machines exhibited in the Crystal\r\n     Palace. The fuel is generally wood, but on certain\r\n     lines near the coal districts coal is used. The use of\r\n     coke is nowhere resorted to. Its expense would make it\r\n     inadmissible, and in a country so thinly inhabited the\r\n     smoke proceeding from coal is not objected to. The\r\n     ordinary speed, stoppages included, is from 14 to 16\r\n     miles an hour. Independently of other considerations,\r\n     the light structure of many of the roads would not\r\n     allow a greater velocity without danger; nevertheless\r\n     we have frequently travelled on some of the better\r\n     constructed lines at the ordinary speed of the English\r\n     railways, say 30 miles an hour and upwards.\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding the apparently feeble and unsubstantial\r\n     structure of many of the lines, accidents to passenger\r\n     trains are scarcely ever heard of. It appears by\r\n     returns now before us that of 9,355,474 passengers\r\n     booked in 1850 on the crowded railways of\r\n     Massachusetts, each passenger making an average trip of\r\n     18 miles, there were only 15 who sustained accidents\r\n     fatal to life or limb. It follows from this, by the\r\n     common principles explained by us in a former article,\r\n     that when a passenger travels one mile on these\r\n     railways the chances against an accident producing\r\n     personal injury, even of the slightest kind, are\r\n     11,226,568 to 1, and of course in a journey of 100\r\n     miles the chances against such accident are 112,266 to\r\n     1. We have shown in a former article that the chances\r\n     against accident on an English railway, under like\r\n     circumstances, are 85,125 to 1. The American railways\r\n     are, therefore, safer than the English in the ratio of\r\n     112 to 85.\r\n\r\n     The great line of communication is established, 400\r\n     miles in length, between Philadelphia and Pittsburg, on\r\n     the left bank of the Ohio, composed partly of railway\r\n     and partly of canal. The section from Philadelphia to\r\n     Columbia (82 miles) is railway; the line is then\r\n     continued by canal for 172 miles to Holidaysburg; it is\r\n     then carried by railway 37 miles to Johnstown, whence\r\n     it is continued 104 miles further to Pittsburg by\r\n     canal. The traffic on this mixed line of transport is\r\n     conducted so as to avoid the expense and inconvenience\r\n     of transhipment of goods and passengers at the\r\n     successive points where the railway and canals unite.\r\n     The merchandise is loaded and the passengers\r\n     accommodated in the boats adapted to the canals at the\r\n     depot in Market-street, Philadelphia. These boats,\r\n     which are of considerable magnitude and length, are\r\n     divided into segments by partitions made transversely\r\n     and at right angles to their length, so that such boat\r\n     can be, as it were, broken into three or more pieces.\r\n     These several pieces are placed each on two railway\r\n     trucks, which support it at the ends, a proper body\r\n     being provided for the trucks adapted to the form of\r\n     the bottom and keel of the boat. In this manner the\r\n     boat is carried in pieces, with its load, along the\r\n     railway. On arriving at the canal the pieces are united\r\n     so as to form a continuous boat, which being launched,\r\n     the transport is continued on the water. On arriving\r\n     again at the railway the boat is once more resolved\r\n     into its segments, which, as before, are transferred to\r\n     the railway trucks and transported to the next canal\r\n     station by locomotive engines. Between the depot in\r\n     Market-street and the locomotive station which is\r\n     situated in the suburbs of Philadelphia the segments of\r\n     the boat are drawn by horses on railways conducted\r\n     through the streets. At the locomotive station the\r\n     trucks are formed into a continuous train and delivered\r\n     over to the locomotive engine. As the body of the truck\r\n     rests upon a pivot, under which it is supported by\r\n     wheels, it is capable of revolving, and no difficulty\r\n     is found in turning the shortest curves, and these\r\n     enormous vehicles, with their contents of merchandise\r\n     and passengers, are seen daily issuing from the gates\r\n     of the depot in Market-street, and turning with\r\n     facility the corners at the entrance of each successive\r\n     street.\r\n\r\n     By a comparison of the returns published by Dr.\r\n     Lardner, in his work already quoted, with the more\r\n     recent results which we have already given, it will\r\n     appear that within the last two years not less than\r\n     3,700 miles of railway have been opened for traffic in\r\n     the United States. Among these are included several of\r\n     the most important lines, among which are more\r\n     especially to be noticed the great artery of railway\r\n     communication extending across the State of New York to\r\n     the shores of Lake Erie, the longest line which any\r\n     single company has yet constructed in the United\r\n     States, its length being 467 miles. The total cost of\r\n     this line, including the working stock, has been\r\n     4,500,000_l._ sterling, being at the average rate of\r\n     9,642_l._ per mile--a rate of expense about 50 per\r\n     cent. above the average cost of American railways taken\r\n     collectively. This is explained by the fact that the\r\n     line itself is one constructed for a large traffic\r\n     between New York and the interior, and therefore built\r\n     to meet a heavy traffic. Although it is but just\r\n     opened, its average receipts have amounted to\r\n     11,000_l._ per week, which have given a net profit of\r\n     6-1/2 per cent. on the capital, the working expenses\r\n     being taken at 50 per cent. of the gross receipts. One\r\n     of the great lines in a forward state, and likely to be\r\n     opened by the close of the present year, connects New\r\n     York with Albany, following the valley of the Hudson.\r\n     It will no doubt create surprise, considering the\r\n     immense facility of water transport afforded by this\r\n     river, that a railway should be constructed on its\r\n     bank, but it must be remembered that for a considerable\r\n     interval during the winter the navigation of the Hudson\r\n     is suspended from the frost.\r\n\r\n     A great line of railway, which will intersect the\r\n     States from south to north, connecting the port of\r\n     Mobile on the Gulf of Mexico with Lake Michigan and the\r\n     lead mines of Galena on the Upper Mississippi, is also\r\n     in progress of construction, large grants of land being\r\n     conceded to the company by the Federal Government. This\r\n     line will probably be opened in 1854.\r\n\r\n     It is difficult to obtain authentic reports from which\r\n     the movement of the traffic on the American railways\r\n     can be ascertained with precision. Dr. Lardner,\r\n     however, obtained the necessary statistical data\r\n     relating to nearly 1,200 miles of railway in the States\r\n     of New England and New York, from which he was enabled\r\n     to collect all the circumstances attending the working\r\n     of these lines, the principal of which are collected in\r\n     the following  table:--\r\n\r\nTabular analysis of the average daily movement of the traffic on 28 of the\r\nprincipal railways in the States of New England and New York.\r\n\r\nPASSENGER TRAFFIC.--Number booked       23,981\r\n                    Mileage            437,350\r\n                    Receipts            L2,723\r\n                    Mileage of trains    8,091\r\n\r\n    GOODS TRAFFIC.--Tons booked          6,547\r\n                    Mileage            248,351\r\n                    Receipts            L1,860\r\n                    Mileage of trains    4,560\r\n\r\nTotal length of the above railways in the State of New York 490 miles\r\nDitto, in the States of New England                         670   \"\r\n                                                          -----\r\n              Total                                       1,160 miles.\r\n\r\nAverage cost of construction and stock in the State of New\r\n  York                                                      L7,010\r\nDitto, in the States of New England                        L10,800\r\nGeneral average                                             L9,200\r\n\r\n                                      | Receipts |  Expenses. | Profits.\r\n--------------------------------------+----------+------------+----------\r\nTotal average receipts, expenses,     |          |            |\r\n  and profits per day in the State of |    L     |      L     |    L\r\n  New York                            |  1,654   |     684    |   970\r\n                                      |          |            |\r\nDitto, States of New England          |  3,040   |   1,505    | 1,535\r\n                                      +----------+------------+----------\r\n            Totals                    |  4,694   |   2,189    |  2,505\r\n                                      |          |            | Per cent.\r\n                                      | Per mile |  Per mile  | per annum\r\n                                      |of railway|   run by   |    on\r\n                                      | per day. |   trains.  |  capital.\r\n--------------------------------------+----------+------------+----------\r\n                                      |    L     |            |\r\nReceipts                              |   4,05   |  7s. 5d.   |   16,1\r\nExpenses                              |   1,89   |3s. 5-1/2d. |    7,5\r\n                                      +----------+------------+----------\r\n            Profits                   |   2,16   |2s.11-1/2d. |    8,6\r\n\r\nExpense per cent. of receipts                          46,8\r\nAverage receipts for passengers booked                 27,0d.\r\nAverage distance travelled per passenger               18,2 miles\r\nAverage receipts per passenger per mile                1,47d.\r\nAverage number of passengers per train                 54,0\r\nTotal average receipts per passenger train per mile    7s.\r\nAverage receipts per ton of goods booked               6s. 8-1/2d.\r\nAverage distance carried per ton                       38,0 miles\r\nAverage receipts per ton per mile                      1s. 8d.\r\nAverage number of tons per train                       54,5\r\nTotal average receipts per goods per mile              8,2s.\r\n\r\n     The railways, of whose traffic we have here given a\r\n     synopsis, are those of the most active and profitable\r\n     description in the United States. It would, therefore,\r\n     be a great error to infer from the results here\r\n     exhibited general conclusions as to the financial\r\n     condition of the American railways. It appears, on the\r\n     other hand, from a more complete analysis, that the\r\n     dividends on the American lines, exclusive of those\r\n     contained in the preceding analysis, are in general\r\n     small, and in many instances nothing. It is, therefore,\r\n     probable that in the aggregate the average profits on\r\n     the total amount of capital invested in the American\r\n     railways does not exceed, if it indeed equal, the\r\n     average profits obtained on the capital invested in\r\n     English railways, which we have in a former article\r\n     shown to produce little more than 3 per cent.\r\n\r\n     The extraordinary extent of railway constructed at so\r\n     early a period in the United States has been by some\r\n     ascribed to the absence of a sufficient extent of\r\n     communication by common roads. Although this cause has\r\n     operated to some extent in certain districts it is by\r\n     no means so general as has been supposed. In the year\r\n     1838 the United States' mails circulated over a length\r\n     of way amounting on the whole to 136,218 miles, of\r\n     which two-thirds were land transport, including\r\n     railways as well as common roads. Of the latter there\r\n     must have been about 80,000 miles in operation, of\r\n     which, however, a considerable portion was\r\n     bridle-roads. The price of transport in the stage\r\n     coaches was, upon an average, 3.25d. per passenger per\r\n     mile, the average price by railway being about 1.47d.\r\n     per mile.\r\n\r\n     Of the entire extent of railway constructed in the\r\n     United States, by far the greater portion, as has been\r\n     already explained, consists of single lines,\r\n     constructed in a light and cheap manner, which in\r\n     England would be regarded as merely serving temporary\r\n     purposes; while, on the contrary, the entire extent of\r\n     the English system consists, not only of double lines,\r\n     but of railways constructed in the most solid,\r\n     permanent, and expensive manner, adapted to the\r\n     purposes of an immense traffic. If a comparison were to\r\n     be instituted at all between the two systems, its basis\r\n     ought to be the capital expended, and the traffic\r\n     served by them, in which case the result would be\r\n     somewhat different from that obtained by the mere\r\n     consideration of the length of the lines. It is not,\r\n     however, the same in reference to the canals, in which\r\n     it must be admitted America far exceeds all other\r\n     countries in proportion to her population.\r\n\r\n     The American railways have been generally constructed\r\n     by joint stock companies, which, however, the State\r\n     controls much more stringently than in England. In some\r\n     cases a major limit to the dividends is imposed by the\r\n     statute of incorporation, in some the dividends are\r\n     allowed to augment, but when they exceed a certain\r\n     limit the surplus is divided with the State; in some\r\n     the privilege granted to the companies is only for a\r\n     limited period, in some a sort of periodical revision\r\n     and restriction of the tariff is reserved to the State.\r\n     Nothing can be more simple, expeditious, and cheap than\r\n     the means of obtaining an act for the establishment of\r\n     a railway company in America. A public meeting is held\r\n     at which the project is discussed and adopted, a\r\n     deputation is appointed to apply to the Legislature,\r\n     which grants the act without expense, delay, or\r\n     official difficulty. The principle of competition is\r\n     not brought into play as in France, nor is there any\r\n     investigation as to the expediency of the project with\r\n     reference to future profit or loss as in England. No\r\n     other guarantee or security is required from the\r\n     company than the payment by the shareholders of a\r\n     certain amount, constituting the first call. In some\r\n     States the non-payment of a call is followed by the\r\n     confiscation of the previous payments, in others a fine\r\n     is imposed on the shareholders, in others the share is\r\n     sold, and if the produce be less than the price at\r\n     which it was delivered the surplus can be recovered\r\n     from the shareholder by process of law. In all cases\r\n     the act creating the companies fix a time within which\r\n     the works must be completed, under pain of forfeiture.\r\n     The traffic in shares before the definite constitution\r\n     of the company is prohibited.\r\n\r\n     Although the State itself has rarely undertaken the\r\n     execution of railways, it holds out in most cases\r\n     inducements in different forms to the enterprise of\r\n     companies. In some cases the State takes a great number\r\n     of shares, which is generally accompanied by a loan\r\n     made to the company, consisting in State Stock\r\n     delivered at par, which the company negotiate at its\r\n     own risk. This loan is often converted into a\r\n     subvention.\r\n\r\n     The great extent of railway communication in America in\r\n     proportion to its population must necessarily excite\r\n     much admiration. If we take the present population of\r\n     the United States at 24,000,000, and the railways in\r\n     operation at 10,000 miles, it will follow that in round\r\n     numbers there is one mile of railway for every 2,400\r\n     inhabitants. Now, in the United Kingdom there are at\r\n     present in operation 6,500 miles of railway, and if we\r\n     take the population at 30,000,000, it will appear that\r\n     there is a mile of railway for every 4,615 inhabitants.\r\n     It appears, therefore, that in proportion to the\r\n     population the length of railways in the United States\r\n     is greater than in the United Kingdom in the ratio of\r\n     46 to 24.\r\n\r\n     On the American railways passengers are not differently\r\n     classed or received at different rates of fare as on\r\n     those of Europe. There is but one class and one fare.\r\n     The only distinction observable arises from color. The\r\n     colored population, whether emancipated or not, are\r\n     generally excluded from the vehicles provided for the\r\n     whites. Such travellers are but few, and are usually\r\n     accommodated either in the luggage van or in the\r\n     carriage with the guard or conductor. But little\r\n     merchandise is transported, the cost of transport being\r\n     greater than goods in general are capable of paying;\r\n     nevertheless, a tariff regulated by weight alone,\r\n     without distinction of classes, is fixed for\r\n     merchandise.\r\n\r\n     Although Cuba is not yet _annexed_ to the United\r\n     States, its local proximity here suggests some notice\r\n     of a line of railway which traverses that island,\r\n     forming a communication between the city of Havana and\r\n     the centre of the island. This is an excellently\r\n     constructed road, and capitally worked by British\r\n     engines, British engineers, and British coals. The\r\n     impressions produced in passing along this line of\r\n     railway, though different from those already noticed in\r\n     the forests of the far west, is not less remarkable. We\r\n     are here transported at 30 miles an hour by an engine\r\n     from Newcastle, driven by an engineer from Manchester,\r\n     and propelled by fuel from Liverpool, through fields\r\n     yellow with pineapples, through groves of plantain and\r\n     cocoa-nut, and along roads inclosed by hedge-rows of\r\n     ripe oranges.\r\n\r\n     To what extent this extraordinary rapidity of\r\n     advancement made by the United States in its inland\r\n     communications is observable in other departments will\r\n     be seen by the following table, exhibiting a\r\n     comparative statement of those _data_, derived from\r\n     official sources, which indicate the social and\r\n     commercial condition of a people through a period which\r\n     forms but a small stage in the life of a nation:\r\n\r\n                                            1793.            1851.\r\nPopulation                               3,939,325      24,267,488\r\nImports                                 L6,739,130     L38,723,545\r\nExports                                 L5,675,869     L32,367,000\r\nTonnage                                    520,704       3,535,451\r\nLighthouses, beacons, and lightships             7             373\r\nCost of their maintenance                   L2,600        L115,000\r\nRevenue                                 L1,230,000      L9,516,000\r\nNational expenditure                    L1,637,000      L8,555,000\r\nPost offices                                   209          21,551\r\nPost roads (miles)                           5,642         178,670\r\nRevenue of Post-office                     L22,800      L1,207,000\r\nExpenses of Post-office                    L15,650      L1,130,000\r\nMileage of mails                              ----      46,541,423\r\nCanals (miles)                                 0             5,000\r\nRailways (miles)                               0            10,287\r\nElectric telegraph (miles)                     0            15,000\r\nPublic libraries (volumes)                  75,000       2,201,623\r\nSchool libraries (volumes)                     0         2,000,000\r\n\r\n     If they were not founded on the most incontestable\r\n     statistical data, the results assigned to the above\r\n     table would appear to belong to fable rather than\r\n     history. In an interval of little more than half a\r\n     century it appears that this extraordinary people have\r\n     increased above 500 per cent. in numbers; their\r\n     national revenue has augmented nearly 700 per cent.,\r\n     while their public expenditure has increased little\r\n     more than 400 per cent. The prodigious extension of\r\n     their commerce is indicated by an increase of nearly\r\n     500 per cent. in their imports and exports and 600 per\r\n     cent. in their shipping. The increased activity of\r\n     their internal communications is expounded by the\r\n     number of their post offices, which has been increased\r\n     more than a hundred-fold, the extent of their post\r\n     roads, which has been increased thirty-six-fold, and\r\n     the cost of their post-office, which has been augmented\r\n     in a seventy-two-fold ratio. The augmentation of their\r\n     machinery of public instruction is indicated by the\r\n     extent of their public libraries, which have increased\r\n     in a thirty-two-fold ratio, and by the creation of\r\n     school libraries, amounting to 2,000,000 volumes. They\r\n     have completed a system of canal navigation, which,\r\n     placed in a continuous line, would extend from London\r\n     to Calcutta, and a system of railways which,\r\n     continuously extended, would stretch from London to Van\r\n     Diemen's Land, and have provided locomotive machinery\r\n     by which that distance would be travelled over in three\r\n     weeks, at the cost of 1-1/2d. per mile. They have\r\n     created a system of inland navigation, the aggregate\r\n     tonnage of which is probably not inferior in amount to\r\n     the collective inland tonnage of all the other\r\n     countries in the world, and they possess many hundreds\r\n     of river steamers, which impart to the roads of water\r\n     the marvellous celerity of roads of iron. They have, in\r\n     fine, constructed lines of electric telegraph which,\r\n     laid continuously, would extend over a space longer by\r\n     3,000 miles than the distance from the north to the\r\n     south pole, and have provided apparatus of transmission\r\n     by which a message of 300 words despatched under such\r\n     circumstances from the north pole might be delivered\r\n     _in writing_ at the south pole in one minute, and by\r\n     which, consequently, an answer of equal length might be\r\n     sent back to the north pole in an equal interval.\r\n\r\n     These are social and commercial phenomena for which it\r\n     would be vain to seek a parallel in the past history of\r\n     the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST EARTHQUAKE IN EUROPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the _Athenaeum_ gives the following account--the best we\r\nhave yet seen--of the recent earthquake at Amalfi, in the kingdom of\r\nNaples:--\r\n\r\n     \"I have, however, seen several persons from Malfi; and\r\n     from their narratives will endeavor to give you some\r\n     idea of this awful visitation. The morning of the 14th\r\n     of August was very sultry, and a leaden atmosphere\r\n     prevailed. It was remarked that an unusual silence\r\n     appeared to extend over the animal world. The hum of\r\n     insects ceased--the feathered tribes were mute--not a\r\n     breath of wind moved the arid vegetation. About\r\n     half-past two o'clock the town of Malfi rocked for\r\n     about six seconds, and nearly every building fell in.\r\n     The number of edifices actually levelled with the earth\r\n     is 163--of those partially destroyed 98, and slightly\r\n     damaged 180. Five monastic establishments were\r\n     destroyed, and seven churches including the cathedral.\r\n     The awful event occurred at a time when most of the\r\n     inhabitants of a better condition were at dinner; and\r\n     the result is, that out of the whole population only a\r\n     few peasants laboring in the fields escaped. More than\r\n     700 dead bodies have already been dug out of the ruins,\r\n     and it is supposed that not less than 800 are yet\r\n     entombed. A college accommodating 65 boys and their\r\n     teachers is no longer traceable. But the melancholy\r\n     event does not end here. The adjoining village of\r\n     Ascoli has also suffered:--32 houses laving fallen in,\r\n     and the church being levelled with the ground. More\r\n     than 200 persons perished there. Another small town,\r\n     Barile, has actually disappeared; and a lake has arisen\r\n     from the bowels of the earth, the waters being warm and\r\n     brackish.\r\n\r\n     \"I proceed to give a few anecdotes, as narrated by\r\n     persons who have arrived in Naples from the scene of\r\n     horror:--'I was travelling,' says one, 'within a mile\r\n     of Malfi when I observed three cars drawn by oxen. In a\r\n     moment the two most distant fell into the earth; from\r\n     the third I observed a man and a boy descend and run\r\n     into a vineyard which skirted the road. Shortly after,\r\n     I think about three seconds, the third car was\r\n     swallowed up. We stopped our carriage, and proceeded to\r\n     the spot where the man and boy stood. The former I\r\n     found stupified--he was both deaf and dumb; the boy\r\n     appeared to be out of his mind, and spoke wildly, but\r\n     eventually recovered. The poor man still remains\r\n     speechless.' Another informant says:--'Malfi, and all\r\n     around present a singular and melancholy appearance:\r\n     houses levelled or partially fallen in--here and there\r\n     the ground broken up--large gaps displaying volcanic\r\n     action--people wandering about stupified--men searching\r\n     in the ruins--women weeping--children here and there\r\n     crying for their parents, and some wretched examples of\r\n     humanity carrying off articles of furniture. The\r\n     authorities are nowhere to be found.' A third person\r\n     states:--'I am from Malfi, and was near a monastery\r\n     when the earthquake occurred. A peasant told me that\r\n     the water in a neighboring well was quite hot,--a few\r\n     moments after I saw the building fall. I fell on the\r\n     ground, and saw nothing more. I thought that I had had\r\n     a fit.'\r\n\r\n     \"The town of Malfi--or, Amalfi--is 150 miles from\r\n     Naples, and about the centre of the boot. It is\r\n     difficult, therefore, to gain information. The\r\n     government, I should add, sent a company of sappers and\r\n     miners to assist the afflicted _nine days after the\r\n     earthquake_!--and a medical commission is to set off\r\n     to-morrow. In conclusion, I may observe, that Vesuvius\r\n     has for a long time been singularly quiet. The shock of\r\n     the earthquake was felt slightly, though sensibly, from\r\n     Naples round to Sorrento. I have just heard that the\r\n     shocks have not ceased in the district of Malfi; and it\r\n     is supposed that volcanic agency is still active.\r\n     Indeed, my informant anticipates that an eruption will\r\n     take place; and probably some extraordinary phenomena\r\n     may appear in this neighborhood. The volcanic action\r\n     appears to have taken the direction of Sicily, as\r\n     reports have arrived stating that the shocks were felt\r\n     in that direction far more strongly than in that of\r\n     Naples. I shall send you further particulars as soon as\r\n     I can do so with certainty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. JEFFERSON ON THE STUDY OF THE ANGLO-SAXON LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trustees of the University of Virginia have had printed a few copies of\r\n_An Essay towards facilitating Instruction in the Anglo-Saxon and Modern\r\nDialects of the English Language_: _By_ THOMAS JEFFERSON. The MS. has been\r\npreserved in the library of their University ever since Mr. Jefferson's\r\ndeath. It is a very characteristic production, and is printed in a thin\r\nquarto volume, prefaced by the following letter from Mr. Jefferson to\r\nHerbert Croft, LL.B., of London:\r\n\r\n                              MONTICELLO, _Oct. 30th, 1798_.\r\n\r\n     Sir; The copy of your printed letter on the English and\r\n     German languages, which you have been so kind as to\r\n     send me, has come to hand; and I pray you to accept of\r\n     my thanks for this mark of your attention. I have\r\n     perused it with singular pleasure, and, having long\r\n     been sensible of the importance of a knowledge of the\r\n     Northern languages to the understanding of English, I\r\n     see it, in this letter, proved and specifically\r\n     exemplified by your collations of the English and\r\n     German. I shall look with impatience for the\r\n     publication of your \"English and German Dictionary.\"\r\n     Johnson, besides the want of precision in his\r\n     definitions, and of accurate distinction in passing\r\n     from one shade of meaning to another of the same word,\r\n     is most objectionable in his derivations. From a want\r\n     probably of intimacy with our own language while in the\r\n     Anglo-Saxon form and type, and of its kindred languages\r\n     of the North, he has a constant leaning towards Greek\r\n     and Latin for English etymon. Even Skinner has a little\r\n     of this, who, when he has given the true Northern\r\n     parentage of a word, often tells you from what Greek\r\n     and Latin source it might be derived by those who have\r\n     that kind of partiality. He is, however, on the whole,\r\n     our best etymologist, unless we ascend a step higher to\r\n     the Anglo-Saxon vocabulary; and he has set the good\r\n     example of collating the English word with its kindred\r\n     word in the several Northern dialects, which often\r\n     assist in ascertaining its true meaning.\r\n\r\n     Your idea is an excellent one, in producing authorities\r\n     for the meanings of words, \"to select the prominent\r\n     passages in our best writers, to make your dictionary a\r\n     general index to English literature, and thus to\r\n     intersperse with verdure and flowers the barren deserts\r\n     of Philology.\" And I believe with you that \"wisdom,\r\n     morality, religion, thus thrown down, as if without\r\n     intention, before the reader, in quotations, may often\r\n     produce more effect than the very passages in the books\r\n     themselves;\"--\"that the cowardly suicide, in search of\r\n     a strong word for his dying letter, might light on a\r\n     passage which would excite him to blush at his want of\r\n     fortitude, and to forego his purpose;\"--\"and that a\r\n     dictionary with examples at the words may, in regard to\r\n     every branch of knowledge, produce more real effect\r\n     than the whole collection of books which it quotes.\" I\r\n     have sometimes myself used Johnson as a Repertory, to\r\n     find favorite passages which I wished to recollect, but\r\n     too rarely with success.\r\n\r\n     I was led to set a due value on the study of the\r\n     Northern languages, and especially of our Anglo-Saxon,\r\n     while I was a student of the law, by being obliged to\r\n     recur to that source for explanation of a multitude of\r\n     law-terms. A preface to Fortescue on Monarchies,\r\n     written by Fortescue Aland, and afterwards premised to\r\n     his volume of Reports, developes the advantages to be\r\n     derived to the English student generally, and\r\n     particularly the student of law, from an acquaintance\r\n     with the Anglo-Saxon; and mentions the books to which\r\n     the learner may have recourse for acquiring the\r\n     language. I accordingly devoted some time to its study,\r\n     but my busy life has not permitted me to indulge in a\r\n     pursuit to which I felt great attraction. While engaged\r\n     in it, however, some ideas occurred for facilitating\r\n     the study by simplifying its grammar, by reducing the\r\n     infinite diversities of its unfixed orthography to\r\n     single and settled forms, indicating at the same time\r\n     the pronunciation of the word by its correspondence\r\n     with the characters and powers of the English alphabet.\r\n     Some of these ideas I noted at the time on the blank\r\n     leaves of my Elstob's Anglo-Saxon Grammar: but there I\r\n     have left them, and must leave them, unpursued,\r\n     although I still think them sound and useful. Among the\r\n     works which I proposed for the Anglo-Saxon student, you\r\n     will find such literal and verbal translations of the\r\n     Anglo-Saxon writers recommended, as you have given us\r\n     of the German in your printed letter. Thinking that I\r\n     cannot submit those ideas to a better judge than\r\n     yourself, and that if you find them of any value you\r\n     may put them to some use, either as hints in your\r\n     dictionary, or in some other way, I will copy them as a\r\n     sequel to this letter, and commit them without reserve\r\n     to your better knowledge of the subject. Adding my\r\n     sincere wishes for the speedy publication of your\r\n     valuable dictionary, I tender you the assurance of my\r\n     high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n                              THOMAS JEFFERSON.\"\r\n\r\nOf the Essay itself we have room for only the initial paragraph, which is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     \"The importance of the Anglo-Saxon dialect towards a\r\n     perfect understanding of the English language seems not\r\n     to have been duly estimated by those charged with the\r\n     education of youth; and yet it is unquestionably the\r\n     basis of our present tongue. It was a full-formed\r\n     language; its frame and construction, its declension of\r\n     nouns and verbs, and its syntax were peculiar to the\r\n     Northern languages, and fundamentally different from\r\n     those of the South. It was the language of all England,\r\n     properly so called, from the Saxon possession of that\r\n     country in the sixth century to the time of Henry III.\r\n     in the thirteenth, and was spoken pure and unmixed with\r\n     any other. Although the Romans had been in possession\r\n     of that country for nearly five centuries from the time\r\n     of Julius Caesar, yet it was a military possession\r\n     chiefly, by their soldiery alone, and with dispositions\r\n     intermutually jealous and unamicable. They seemed to\r\n     have aimed at no lasting settlements there, and to have\r\n     had little familiar mixture with the native Britons. In\r\n     this state of connection there would probably be little\r\n     incorporation of the Roman into the native language,\r\n     and on their subsequent evacuation of the island its\r\n     traces would soon be lost altogether. And had it been\r\n     otherwise, these innovations would have been carried\r\n     with the natives themselves when driven into Wales by\r\n     the invasion and entire occupation of the rest of the\r\n     Southern portion of the island by the Anglo-Saxons. The\r\n     language of these last became that of the country from\r\n     that time forth, for nearly seven centuries; and so\r\n     little attention was paid among them to the Latin, that\r\n     it was known to a few individuals only as a matter of\r\n     science, and without any chance of transfusion into the\r\n     vulgar language. We may safely repeat the affirmation,\r\n     therefore, that the pure Anglo-Saxon constitutes at\r\n     this day the basis of our language. That it was\r\n     sufficiently copious for the purposes of society in the\r\n     existing condition of arts and manners, reason alone\r\n     would satisfy us from the necessity of the case. Its\r\n     copiousness, too, was much favored by the latitude it\r\n     allowed of combining primitive words so as to produce\r\n     any modification of idea desired. In this\r\n     characteristic it was equal to the Greek, but it is\r\n     more specially proved by the actual fact of the books\r\n     they have left us in the various branches of history,\r\n     geography, religion, law, and poetry. And although\r\n     since the Norman conquest it has received vast\r\n     additions and embellishments from the Latin, Greek,\r\n     French, and Italian languages, yet these are but\r\n     engraftments on its idiomatic stem; its original\r\n     structure and syntax remain the same, and can be but\r\n     imperfectly understood by the mere Latin scholar. Hence\r\n     the necessity of making the Anglo-Saxon a regular\r\n     branch of academic education. In the sixteenth and\r\n     seventeenth centuries it was assiduously cultivated by\r\n     a host of learned men. The names of Lambard, Parker,\r\n     Spelman, Wheeloc, Wilkins, Gibson, Hickes, Thwaites,\r\n     Somner, Benson, Mareschal, Elstob, deserve to be ever\r\n     remembered with gratitude for the Anglo-Saxon works\r\n     which they have given us through the press, the only\r\n     certain means of preserving and promulgating them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OBELISKS OF EGYPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last number of the _International_ we gave an interesting article\r\nfrom the London _Times_ respecting \"Cleopatra's Needle.\" The subject of its\r\nremoval has since been largely discussed in England, and Mr. Tucker, a\r\ncivil engineer, has been sent out to Alexandria to \"report on the condition\r\nand site of the obelisk,\" and Lord Edward Russell has been appointed to the\r\nVengeance to proceed to Egypt for the purpose of bringing it to England. On\r\nthe publication of these facts Mr. Nathaniel Gould writes to the _Times_ as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     How far a \"man-of-war\" is a proper vessel for this\r\n     purpose may be seen hereafter. The Premier is, however,\r\n     ready enough to appropriate some little _eclat_ to a\r\n     member of his own family. I stated that, so far as I\r\n     could make out, the bringing the obelisk of Luxor to\r\n     Paris had cost the French Government 40,000_l._; but it\r\n     is stated by Mr. Gliddon, late United States Consul at\r\n     Cairo, that it actually cost France 2,000,000f., or\r\n     80,000_l._! Private offers have been made to bring the\r\n     Needle to England for from 7,000_l._ to 12,500_l._\r\n     within a twelvemonth; it remains to be seen what it\r\n     will cost when brought on Government account.\r\n\r\n     Notwithstanding that so much has of late appeared upon\r\n     the subject of Egyptian obelisks, but little has been\r\n     given of value to the public touching the nature,\r\n     origin, inscriptions, numbers, and localities of these\r\n     curious and interesting objects. Perhaps, Sir, you may\r\n     not think it out of the way to give room for such\r\n     information as I have got together in my researches,\r\n     while contemplating the removal of the obelisk from\r\n     Alexandria. Obelisks are of Egyptian invention, and are\r\n     purely historical records, placed in pairs before\r\n     public buildings, stating when, by whom, and for what\r\n     purpose the building was erected, and the divinity or\r\n     divinities to whom it was dedicated.\r\n\r\n     We read that the ancient Hebrews set up stones to\r\n     record signal events, and such stones are called by\r\n     Strabo \"books of history;\" but, as they were\r\n     uninscribed, the Egyptian monoliths are much more so.\r\n     The Celts, too, have left similar stones in every\r\n     country in which they settled, as our own islands\r\n     sufficiently prove, whether in those of the Channel or\r\n     of Ireland and Scotland. The Scandinavian nations have\r\n     in more recent periods left similar records, some of\r\n     them inscribed with Runic characters, which, like the\r\n     hieroglyphics of Egypt, are now translated.\r\n\r\n     Egyptian obelisks are all of very nearly similar\r\n     proportions, however they may differ in height; the\r\n     width of the base is usually about one-tenth of the\r\n     length of the shaft, up to the finish or pyramidion,\r\n     which, again, is one-tenth of the length of the shaft.\r\n     The image of gold set up by king Nebuchadnezzar agrees\r\n     with these proportions--viz., sixty cubits high and six\r\n     cubits wide. They are generally cut out of granite,\r\n     though there are two small ones in the British Museum\r\n     of basalt, and one at Philoe of sandstone. The\r\n     pyramidions of several appear to be rough and\r\n     unfinished, leading some persons to suppose that they\r\n     were surmounted with a cap of bronze, or of rays. Bonom\r\n     writes, that Abd El Latief saw bronze coverings on\r\n     those of Luxor and that of Materiah in the 13th\r\n     century; with such a belief it is not improbable that\r\n     the obelisk of Arles, in France, found and re-erected\r\n     to the glory of the Great Louis, was surmounted with a\r\n     gilt sun. The temples of Egypt may be considered not\r\n     only as monuments of the intelligence and ancient\r\n     civilization of mankind, as vignettes in the great book\r\n     of history, but also as possessing a peculiar interest,\r\n     as belonging to a people intimately connected with\r\n     sacred records.\r\n\r\n     As regards the original sites of the obelisks, none are\r\n     found on the west bank of the Nile, neither are any\r\n     pyramids found on the eastern bank of Egypt Proper;\r\n     this caused Bonomi to think that obelisks were intended\r\n     as decorations to the temples of the living, symbolized\r\n     by the rising sun, and pyramids decorations of the\r\n     temples of the dead, symbolized by its setting. The\r\n     greater number of obelisks are engraven on the four\r\n     faces; some are engraven on one face only, and some\r\n     have never been inscribed. Some of the faces are\r\n     engraven in one column, some in two, and some in three\r\n     columns. In some instances the side or lateral columns\r\n     have been additions in after times, in different and\r\n     inferior styles of engraving; and in some instances the\r\n     name of the king, within the oval or cartouche, has\r\n     been erased and another substituted. The inscriptions\r\n     are hieroglyphic or sacred writing, which have been\r\n     unintelligible till within the last few years. The\r\n     French occupation of Egypt commenced that discovery,\r\n     which has been perfected by the key of Young and the\r\n     alphabet of Champollion--though mainly perhaps indebted\r\n     to the Rosetta Stone, found in 1799, engraven in three\r\n     characters, hieroglyphic, Demotic and Greek. The more\r\n     ancient inscriptions are beautifully cut, and as fresh\r\n     as if just from the tool, and are curiously caved\r\n     inwardly, and exquisitely polished.\r\n\r\n     It would take too much of your space and of my time to\r\n     give a history of the progress of this wonderful\r\n     discovery, by which we now know more of the Egyptian\r\n     history before the time of Abraham than of England\r\n     before Alfred the Great, or of France before\r\n     Charlemagne. Some of these monuments are considered to\r\n     date as far back as 2,000 years before the Christian\r\n     era. It is sufficiently evident, from the small number\r\n     that are known to exist, that they were a most costly\r\n     production, requiring a long time for their completion,\r\n     and the most elaborate skill of the most perfect\r\n     sculptors to execute. Bonomi, to whose indefatigable\r\n     research, and clear and positive style of writing, and\r\n     condensation of his knowledge I am indebted, out of his\r\n     papers read before the Royal Society of Literature (of\r\n     which I am a member), gives us an account of all the\r\n     known obelisks.\r\n\r\n     The number of Egyptian obelisks now standing is 30; of\r\n     which there are remaining in Egypt, 8; in Italy, 14; in\r\n     Constantinople, 2; in France, 2; in England, 4. The\r\n     loftiest is that of the \"Lateran,\" at Rome, which is\r\n     105 feet, though 4 feet were cut from its broken base,\r\n     to enable it to stand when re-erected. The shortest is\r\n     the minor \"Florentine,\" which is 5 feet 10 inches. The\r\n     number of prostrate obelisks known is 12, viz.: at\r\n     Alexandria, 1; in the ruins of Saan, or Tanais, 9; at\r\n     Carnack, 2; all in Egypt, and all colossal, and of the\r\n     18th and 20th dynasties. Thus it seems that, like the\r\n     cedars of Lebanon, there are more in other parts of the\r\n     world than in the country of their original location.\r\n\r\n     The 12 obelisks at Rome were conveyed thither by the\r\n     Caesars to adorn the eternal city; that of the Lateran\r\n     was brought by Constantine from Heliopolis to\r\n     Alexandria, and from Alexandria by Constantius, and\r\n     placed in the \"Circus Maximus.\" It was brought from\r\n     Alexandria in an immense galley. When the barbarians\r\n     sacked Rome they overthrew all the obelisks, which were\r\n     broken in their fall; this was in three pieces, and the\r\n     base so destroyed that when raised by Fontana in 1588,\r\n     by order of Sixtus V., above 4 feet were cut from its\r\n     base; it is now 105 feet 7 inches in shaft. It is\r\n     sculptured on all four sides, and the same subject on\r\n     each. There are three columns--the inner the most\r\n     ancient and best cut. The obelisk of the Piazza del\r\n     Popolo was brought from Heliopolis by Augustus, and,\r\n     like the preceding, was broken in three pieces, and\r\n     required above three feet to be cut off its damaged\r\n     base. This, too, was re-erected by order of Sixtus V.,\r\n     in 1589. Its height, as now shortened, is 87 feet 5\r\n     inches. It is sculptured on all four sides in three\r\n     columns of different age and excellence. The obelisk of\r\n     \"Piazza Rotunda\" was re-erected by Clement XI., A. D.,\r\n     1711. It is 19 feet 9 inches shaft. It has only one\r\n     column of hieroglyphics, with the name of Rameses on\r\n     each. Those of Materiah and the Hippodrome at\r\n     Constantinople also have but one centre column\r\n     engraved. So much for some of those at Rome. Of the\r\n     four in England, two small ones, of basalt, are in the\r\n     British Museum; they are only 8 feet 1 inch in height.\r\n     That at Alnwick Castle was found in the Thebaid, and\r\n     presented to Lord Prudhoe by the Pacha in 1838, and got\r\n     to England by Bonomi. It is of red granite, 7 feet 3\r\n     inches in height, and 9-3/4 inches at the base. It is\r\n     inscribed on one face only. That at Corfe Castle was\r\n     brought over for Mr. Bankes by the celebrated Belzoni.\r\n     It is of granite, and 22 feet in height.\r\n\r\nMr. Gould proceeds to repeat the particulars respecting Cleopatra's Needle,\r\nwhich were contained in the October number of this magazine. Signor\r\nTisvanni D'Athanasi also writes to the _Times_, proposing to undertake the\r\nremoval of this obelisk, and says:\r\n\r\n     \"Every body knows that from the time of the Romans up\r\n     to the present century the only colossal objects which\r\n     have been transported from Egypt, with the exception of\r\n     the obelisk of Luxor, are the two sphynxes which are\r\n     now at St Petersburgh, and which were found and sent to\r\n     Alexandria through my means.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. LATHAM ON THE MOSKITO KINGDOM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last portion of Dr. ROBERT G. LATHAM'S learned work on the Ethnology of\r\nthe British Colonies and Dependencies, treats of American ethnology, a\r\nbranch of the subject which, though extensively investigated, is greatly in\r\nwant of systematic arrangement. Some of Dr. Latham's views are novel. The\r\nfollowing sketch of the Nicaraguan Indians is interesting at the present\r\nmoment for political reasons:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Moskito Indians are no subjects of England, any\r\n     more than the Tahitians are of France, or the Sandwich\r\n     Islanders of America, France, and England conjointly.\r\n     The Moskito coast is a Protectorate, and the Moskito\r\n     Indians are the subjects of a native king. The present\r\n     reigning monarch was educated under English auspices at\r\n     Jamaica, and, upon attaining his majority, crowned at\r\n     Grey Town. I believe that his name is that of the\r\n     grandfather of our late gracious majesty. King George,\r\n     then, King of the Moskitos, has a territory extending\r\n     from the neighborhood of Truxillo to the lower part of\r\n     the River San Juan; a territory whereof, inconveniently\r\n     for Great Britain, the United States, and the commerce\r\n     of the world at large, the limits and definition are\r\n     far from being universally recognized. Nicaragua has\r\n     claims, and the Isthmus canal suffers accordingly. The\r\n     King of the Moskito coast, and the Emperor of the\r\n     Brazil, are the only resident sovereigns of the New\r\n     World. The subjects of the former are, really, the\r\n     aborigines of the whole line of coast between Nicaragua\r\n     and Honduras--there being no Indians remaining in the\r\n     former republic, and but few in the latter. Of these,\r\n     too--the Nicaraguans--we have no definite ethnological\r\n     information. Mr. Squier speaks of them as occupants of\r\n     the islands of the lakes of the interior. Colonel\r\n     Galindo also mentions them; but I infer, from his\r\n     account, that their original language is lost, and that\r\n     Spanish is their present tongue; just as it is said to\r\n     be that of the aborigines of St. Salvador and Costa\r\n     Rica. This makes it difficult to fix them. And the\r\n     difficulty is increased when we resort to history,\r\n     tradition, and archaeology. History makes them\r\n     Mexicans--Asteks from the kingdom of Montezuma, and\r\n     colonists of the Peninsula, just as the Phoenicians\r\n     were of Carthage. Archaeology goes the same way. A\r\n     detailed description of Mr. Squier's discoveries is an\r\n     accession to ethnology which is anxiously expected. At\r\n     any rate, stone ruins and carved decorations have been\r\n     found; so that what Mr. Stephenson has written about\r\n     Yucatan and Guatemala, may be repeated in the case of\r\n     Nicaragua. Be it so. The difficulty will be but\r\n     increased, since whatever facts make Nicaragua Mexican,\r\n     isolate the Moskitos. They are now in contact with\r\n     Spaniards and Englishmen--populations whose\r\n     civilization differs from their own; and populations\r\n     who are evidently intrusive and of recent origin.\r\n     Precisely the same would be the case if the Nicaraguans\r\n     were made Mexican. The civilization would be of another\r\n     sort; the population which introduced it would be\r\n     equally intrusive; and the only difference would be a\r\n     difference of stage and degree--a little earlier in the\r\n     way of time, and a little less contrast in the way of\r\n     skill and industry. But the evidence in favor of the\r\n     Mexican origin of the Nicaraguans is doubtful; and so\r\n     is the fact of their having wholly lost their native\r\n     tongue; and until one of these two opinions be proved,\r\n     it will be well to suspend our judgment as to the\r\n     isolation of the Moskitos. If, indeed, either of them\r\n     be true, their ethnological position will be a\r\n     difficult question. With nothing in Honduras to compare\r\n     them with--with nothing tangible, or with an apparently\r\n     incompatible affinity in Nicaragua--with only very\r\n     general miscellaneous affinities in Guatemala--their\r\n     ethnological affinities are as peculiar as their\r\n     political constitution. Nevertheless, isolated as their\r\n     language is, it has undoubtedly general affinities with\r\n     those of America at large; and this is all that it is\r\n     safe to say at present. But it is safe to say this. We\r\n     have plenty of data for their tongue, in a grammar of\r\n     Mr. Henderson's, published at New-York, 1846. The chief\r\n     fact in the history of the Moskitos is that they were\r\n     never subject to the Spaniards. Each continent affords\r\n     a specimen of this isolated freedom--the independence\r\n     of some exceptional and impracticable tribes, as\r\n     compared with the universal empire of some encroaching\r\n     European power. The Circassians in Caucasus, the\r\n     Tshuktshi Koriaks in North-Eastern Asia, and the\r\n     Kaffres in Africa, show this. Their relations with the\r\n     buccaneers were, probably, of an amicable description.\r\n     So they were with the negroes--maroon and imported. And\r\n     this, perhaps, has determined their _differentiae_. They\r\n     are intertropical American aborigines, who have become\r\n     partially European, without becoming Spanish. Their\r\n     physical conformation is that of the South rather than\r\n     the North American; and, here it must be remembered,\r\n     that we are passing from one moiety of the new\r\n     hemisphere to the other. With a skin which is\r\n     olive-colored rather than red, they have small limbs\r\n     and undersized frames; whilst their habits are,\r\n     _mutatis mutandis_, those of the intertropical African.\r\n     This means, that the exuberance of soil, and the heat\r\n     of the climate, make them agriculturists rather than\r\n     shepherds, and idlers rather than agriculturists, since\r\n     the least possible amount of exertion gives them roots\r\n     and fruits, whilst it is only those wants which are\r\n     compatible with indolence that they care to satisfy.\r\n     They presume rather than improve upon the warmth of\r\n     their suns, and the fertility of the soil. When they\r\n     get liquor, they get drunk; when they work hardest,\r\n     they cut mahogany. Canoes and harpoons represent the\r\n     native industry. Wulasha is the name of their evil\r\n     spirit, and Liwaia that of a water-dog. I cannot but\r\n     think that there is much intermixture amongst them. At\r\n     the same time, the data for ascertaining the amount are\r\n     wanting. Their greatest intercourse has, probably, been\r\n     with the negro; their next greatest with the\r\n     Englishman. Of the population of the interior we know\r\n     next to nothing. Here their neighbors are Spaniards.\r\n     They are frontagers to the river San Juan. This gives\r\n     them their value in politics. They are the only well\r\n     known extant Indians between Guatemala and Veragua.\r\n     This gives them their value in ethnology. The\r\n     populations to which they were most immediately allied\r\n     have disappeared from history. This isolates them; so\r\n     that there is no class to which they can be\r\n     subordinated. At the same time, they are quite as like\r\n     the nearest known tribes as the American ethnologist\r\n     is prepared to expect. What they were in their truly\r\n     natural state, when, unmodified by either Englishman or\r\n     Spaniard, Black or Indian, they represented the\r\n     indigenous civilization (such as it was) of their\r\n     coast, is uncertain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLD-QUARTZ AND SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Burns Ranch Union Mining Company in California have published a\r\nprospectus--we suppose to facilitate the sale of their stock--and the\r\nwriter indulges in some speculations respecting the influence of the\r\ndiscovery that the chief mineral riches of the new state are in mines,\r\ninstead of the sands of rivers, thus:\r\n\r\n     It appears to be the destiny of America to carry on the\r\n     greatness of the future, and that Providence--which\r\n     shapes the ends of nations as well as of persons, at a\r\n     time when it was most needful for the prosecution of\r\n     her mission, when war and the expedients of political\r\n     strategy are out of vogue, and the people is most\r\n     powerful of which the individual civilization, energy,\r\n     ambition, and resources are greatest--that Providence,\r\n     at this crisis, has opened the veins of the Continent,\r\n     slumbering so many thousand years, in order that we\r\n     might derive from them all that remained necessary for\r\n     investing the United States with the leadership of the\r\n     world.\r\n\r\n     The first intelligence of the discovery of gold in\r\n     California fell upon the general mind like news of a\r\n     great and peculiar revolution. It was at once--even\r\n     before the statements on the subject assumed a definite\r\n     or certain form--it was at once felt that a new hour\r\n     was signally on the dial-plate of history. Immediately,\r\n     those immense fortunes which were acquired by the\r\n     Portuguese and Spaniards nearly four centuries\r\n     ago--fortunes which, in the decline of nations, have\r\n     still remained in families as the sign and substance of\r\n     the only nobility and power which mankind at large\r\n     acknowledge--those astonishing fortunes which raised\r\n     the enterprising poor man to the dignity and happiness\r\n     of the most elevated classes in society, were recalled,\r\n     and made suggestive of like successes to new and more\r\n     hardy adventurers. The reports came with increased\r\n     volume; every ship confirmed the rumors brought by its\r\n     predecessor, and new intelligence, that, in its turn,\r\n     tasked the popular credulity; and it came soon to be\r\n     understood that we had found a land literally flowing\r\n     with gold and silver, as that promised to the earlier\r\n     favorites of Heaven did with milk and honey. As many as\r\n     were free from controlling engagements, and had means\r\n     with which to do so, started for our El Dorado, making\r\n     haste, in fear that the wealth of the country would\r\n     quickly be exhausted--not dreaming, even yet, that\r\n     there was any thing to be acquired but flakes and\r\n     scales and scattered masses of ore, which would be\r\n     exhausted by the first hunters who should scour the\r\n     rivers and turn the surface soil.\r\n\r\n     But at length the geologists began to apprehend, what\r\n     experience soon confirmed, that, extraordinary as were\r\n     the amounts of gold found in drifts of gravel, and\r\n     deposits that had been left in the beds of streams,\r\n     these were merely the signs of far greater\r\n     riches--merely indexes of the presence of rocks and\r\n     hills, and underlayers of plains, impregnated with\r\n     gold, in quantities that the processes of nature could\r\n     never disclose, and that would reward only the\r\n     scientific efforts of miners having all the mechanical\r\n     appliances which the laborious experiments of other\r\n     nations had invented. The fact of the existence of\r\n     veins of gold in vast quartz formations, and ribs of\r\n     gold in hills, was as startling almost as the first\r\n     news of the presence of the precious metal in the\r\n     country. This at once changed the prospect, and from a\r\n     game of chance, elevated the pursuit of gold in\r\n     California to a grand industrial purpose, requiring an\r\n     energy and sagacity that invest it with the highest\r\n     dignity, and to such energy and sagacity promising,\r\n     with absolute certainty, rewards that make it worthy of\r\n     the greatest ambition.\r\n\r\n     Now, men of character and capital--the class of men\r\n     whose speculating spirit is held in subjection by the\r\n     most exact reason--began to turn to the subject their\r\n     investigations, and to connect with it their plans.\r\n     This will account for the fact that has so much\r\n     astonished the world, which had supposed our Pacific\r\n     colony to be composed of the reckless, profligate and\r\n     desperate only--the fact, that when California made her\r\n     constitution of government, it shot at once in\r\n     unquestionable wisdom directly and far in advance of\r\n     all the states on the Atlantic, presenting to mankind\r\n     the very highest type of a free government that had\r\n     ever been conceived. The demonstration that California\r\n     was a _mine_, like other mines in all but its\r\n     surpassing richness, elevated it from a scene of\r\n     gambling to one for the orderly pursuit of riches, and\r\n     by the splendor of its promises, drew to it the most\r\n     sagacious and most heroical intelligences of the time.\r\n\r\n     Astonishing as are the present and prospective results\r\n     of the discovery in California, however, we are not to\r\n     suppose that there is any possibility of a decline in\r\n     the value of the precious metals. In absolute material\r\n     civilization, the world in the last three-quarters of a\r\n     century has advanced more than it had in any previous\r\n     three full centuries; and the supply of gold, for\r\n     currency and the thousand other objects for which it\r\n     was demanded, was becoming alarmingly insufficient, so\r\n     that the addition of more than thirty per cent. to the\r\n     total annual product of the world, which we are led by\r\n     the officially-stated results thus far to expect from\r\n     California, will merely preserve the historical and\r\n     necessary proportion and standard value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINEDITED LETTER OF DR.

Mr. Deane as you observe is lost. Dr.\r\n     Bancroft is I believe steady to the interest of his\r\n     country, and will make an agreeable passenger if you\r\n     can take him. You desire to know something of the\r\n     state of affairs here. Every thing goes well with\r\n     respect to this court and the other friendly powers;\r\n     what England is doing or means to do, or why the\r\n     definitive treaty is so long delayed, I know perhaps\r\n     less than you do; as, being in that country, you may\r\n     have opportunities of hearing more than I can. For\r\n     myself, I am at present as hearty and well as I have\r\n     been these many years; and as happy as a man can be\r\n     where every body strives to make him so. The French are\r\n     an amiable people to live with; they love me, and I\r\n     love them. Yet I do not feel myself at home, and I wish\r\n     to die in my own country. Barney will sail this week\r\n     with our dispatches. A good voyage to you, my friend,\r\n     and may God ever bless you.\r\n\r\n                              B.

BOKER.\r\n\r\n    \"The ice was here, the ice was there,\r\n    The ice was all around.\"--COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    O, whither sail you, Sir John Franklin?\r\n    Cried a whaler in Baffin's Bay.\r\n    To know if between the land and the pole\r\n    I may find a broad sea-way.\r\n\r\n    I charge you back, Sir John Franklin,\r\n    As you would live and thrive;\r\n    For between the land and the frozen pole\r\n    No man may sail alive.\r\n\r\n    But lightly laughed the stout Sir John,\r\n    And spoke unto his men:--\r\n    Half England is wrong, if he is right;\r\n    Bear off to westward then.\r\n\r\n    O, whither sail you, brave Englishman?\r\n    Cried the little Esquimaux.\r\n    Between the land and the polar star\r\n    My goodly vessels go.\r\n\r\n    Come down, if you would journey there,\r\n    The little Indian said;\r\n    And change your cloth for fur clothing,\r\n    Your vessel for a sled.\r\n\r\n    But lightly laughed the stout Sir John,\r\n    And the crew laughed with him too:--\r\n    A sailor to change from ship to sled,\r\n    I ween, were something new!\r\n\r\n    All through the long, long polar day,\r\n    The vessels westward sped;\r\n    And wherever the sail of Sir John was blown,\r\n    The ice gave way and fled.\r\n\r\n    Gave way with many a hollow groan,\r\n    And with many a surly roar;\r\n    But it murmured and threatened on every side,\r\n    And closed where he sailed before.\r\n\r\n    Ho! see ye not, my merry men,\r\n    The broad and open sea?\r\n    Bethink ye what the whaler said,\r\n    Think of the little Indian's sled!\r\n    The crew laughed out in glee.\r\n\r\n    Sir John, Sir John, 'tis bitter cold,\r\n    The scud drives on the breeze,\r\n    The ice comes looming from the north,\r\n    The very sunbeams freeze.\r\n\r\n    Bright summer goes, dark winter comes--\r\n    We cannot rule the year;\r\n    But long ere summer's sun goes down,\r\n    On yonder sea we'll steer.\r\n\r\n    The dripping icebergs dipped and rose,\r\n    And floundered down the gale;\r\n    The ships were staid, the yards were manned,\r\n    And furled the useless sail.\r\n\r\n    The summer's gone, the winter's come,\r\n    We sail not on yonder sea:\r\n    Why sail we not, Sir John Franklin?\r\n    A silent man was he.\r\n\r\n    The summer goes, the winter comes--\r\n    We cannot rule the year:\r\n    I ween, we cannot rule the ways,\r\n    Sir John, wherein we'd steer.\r\n\r\n    The cruel ice came floating on,\r\n    And closed beneath the lee,\r\n    Till the thickening waters dashed no more;\r\n    'Twas ice around, behind, before--\r\n    My God! there is no sea!\r\n\r\n    What think you of the whaler now?\r\n    What of the Esquimaux?\r\n    A sled were better than a ship,\r\n    To cruise through ice and snow.\r\n\r\n    Down sank the baleful crimson sun,\r\n    The northern light came out,\r\n    And glared upon the ice-bound ships,\r\n    And shook its spears about.\r\n\r\n    The snow came down, storm breeding storm,\r\n    And on the decks was laid;\r\n    Till the weary sailor, sick at heart,\r\n    Sank down beside his spade.\r\n\r\n    Sir John, the night is black and long,\r\n    The hissing wind is bleak,\r\n    The hard, green ice is strong as death:--\r\n    I prithee, Captain, speak!\r\n\r\n    The night is neither bright nor short,\r\n    The singing breeze is cold,\r\n    The ice is not so strong as hope--\r\n    The heart of man is bold!\r\n\r\n    What hope can scale this icy wall,\r\n    High over the main flag-staff?\r\n    Above the ridges the wolf and bear\r\n    Look down with a patient, settled stare,\r\n    Look down on us and laugh.\r\n\r\n    The summer went, the winter came--\r\n    We could not rule the year;\r\n    But summer will melt the ice again,\r\n    And open a path to the sunny main,\r\n    Whereon our ships shall steer.\r\n\r\n    The winter went, the summer went,\r\n    The winter came around;\r\n    But the hard, green ice was strong as death,\r\n    And the voice of hope sank to a breath,\r\n    Yet caught at every sound.\r\n\r\n    Hark! heard you not the noise of guns?\r\n    And there, and there again?\r\n    'Tis some uneasy iceberg's roar,\r\n    As he turns in the frozen main.\r\n\r\n    Hurra! hurra! the Esquimaux\r\n    Across the ice-fields steal:\r\n    God give them grace for their charity!\r\n    Ye pray for the silly seal.\r\n\r\n    Sir John, where are the English fields,\r\n    And where are the English trees,\r\n    And where are the little English flowers\r\n    That open in the breeze?\r\n\r\n    Be still, be still, my brave sailors!\r\n    You shall see the fields again,\r\n    And smell the scent of the opening flowers,\r\n    The grass, and the waving grain.\r\n\r\n    Oh! when shall I see my orphan child?\r\n    My Mary waits for me.\r\n    Oh! when shall I see my old mother\r\n    And pray at her trembling knee?\r\n\r\n    Be still, be still, my brave sailors!\r\n    Think not such thoughts again.\r\n    But a tear froze slowly on his cheek;\r\n    He thought of Lady Jane.\r\n\r\n    Ah! bitter, bitter grows the cold,\r\n    The ice grows more and more;\r\n    More settled stare the wolf and bear,\r\n    More patient than before.\r\n\r\n    Oh! think you, good Sir John Franklin,\r\n    We'll ever see the land?\r\n    'Twas cruel to send us here to starve,\r\n    Without a helping hand.\r\n\r\n    'Twas cruel, Sir John, to send us here,\r\n    So far from help or home,\r\n    To starve and freeze on this lonely sea:\r\n    I ween, the Lords of the Admiralty\r\n    Had rather send than come.\r\n\r\n    Oh! whether we starve to death alone,\r\n    Or sail to our own country,\r\n    We have done what man has never done--\r\n    The open ocean danced in the sun--\r\n    We passed the Northern Sea!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE PROPHECY.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH OF M. LAHARPE FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nBY H. J. BEYERLE, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems to me as if it had been but yesterday, and yet it happened in the\r\nbeginning of the year 1788. We were at table with one of our colleagues of\r\nthe Academy, a respectable and lively gentleman. The company was numerous,\r\nand selected from all ranks: nobles, judges, professional men,\r\nacademicians, &c. We had enjoyed ourselves as is customary at a well-loaded\r\ntable. At the desert, the _malvasier_ and Cape wine exalted the pleasure\r\nand increased in a good company that kind of liberty which does not remain\r\nwithin precise limits.\r\n\r\nPeople in the world had then arrived at the point where it was allowed to\r\nsay every thing, if it was the object to excite laughter. Chamfort had read\r\nto us some of his blasphemous and unchaste tales, and the noble ladies\r\nheard them without even taking for refuge to the fan. Then followed a whole\r\nvolley of mockery on religion. One mentioned a tirade from the Pucelle; the\r\nother reminded us of those philosophical stanzas of Diderot, wherein he\r\nsays: \"With the intestines of the last priest tie up the throat of the last\r\nking;\" and all clapped approbation. Another rises, holds up the full\r\ntumbler, and cries: \"Yes, gentlemen, I am just as certain that there is no\r\nGod, as I am certain that Homer was a fool!\" and really, he was of the one\r\nas certain as he was of the other: we had just spoken of Homer and of God,\r\nand there were guests present, too, who had said something good of the one\r\nand of the other.\r\n\r\nThe conversation now became more serious. We spoke with astonishment of the\r\nrevolution Voltaire had effected, and we agreed that it is the most\r\ndistinguished foundation of his fame. He had given the term to his\r\nhalf-century; he had written in such a manner, that he is read in the\r\nanteroom as well as in the hall.\r\n\r\nOne of the guests told us with great laughter, that his hairdresser, as he\r\npowdered him, said, \"You see, sir, though I am only a miserable fellow, I\r\nyet have not more religion than others.\" We concluded that the revolution\r\nwould soon be completed, and that superstition and fanaticism must\r\nabsolutely yield to philosophy; we calculated the probability of the time,\r\nand who of this company may have the happiness to live to see the reign of\r\nreason. The older ones were sorry that they could not flatter themselves to\r\nsee this; those younger rejoiced with the hope that they shall live to the\r\ntime, and we particularly congratulated the Academy for having introduced\r\nthe great work, and that they have been the chief source, the centre, the\r\nmainspring of freedom of thought.\r\n\r\nOne of the guests had taken no part in this gay conversation, and had even\r\nscattered a few jokes in regard to our beautiful enthusiasm. It was M.\r\nCazotte, an agreeable and original gentleman; but who, unfortunately, was\r\nprepossessed by the idle imaginations of those who believe in a higher\r\ninspiration. He took the word, and said, in the most serious manner: \"Sirs,\r\nrejoice; you all will be witnesses of that great and sublime revolution for\r\nwhich you wish so much. You are aware that I make some pretensions to\r\nprophecy. I repeat it to you, you will all see it!\"\r\n\r\n\"For this a man needs no prophetic gifts,\" was answered him.\r\n\r\n\"This is true,\" he replied, \"but probably a little more for what I have to\r\ntell you yet. Do you know what will arise from this revolution (where,\r\nnamely, reason will triumph in opposition to religion)? what her immediate\r\nconsequence, her undeniable and acknowledged effects will be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see,\" said Condorcet, with his affected look of simplicity, \"a\r\nphilosopher is not sorry to meet a prophet.\"\r\n\r\n\"You, M. Condorcet,\" continued M. Cazotte, \"you will be stretched out upon\r\nthe floor of a dungeon, there to yield up your ghost. You will die of\r\npoison, which you will swallow to save yourself from the hangman--of the\r\npoison which the good luck of the times, which then will be, will have\r\ncompelled you always to have carried with you.\"\r\n\r\nThis at first excited great astonishment, but we soon remembered that the\r\ngood Cazotte occasionally dreamed waking, and we all laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n\"M. Cazotte,\" said one of the guests, \"the tale you relate to us here is\r\nnot as merry as your 'Devil in Love' (a romance which Cazotte had written).\r\nWhat kind of a devil has given you the dungeon, the poison, and the\r\nhangman?--what has this in common with philosophy, and with the reign of\r\nReason?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is just what I told you,\" replied Cazotte. \"In the name of\r\nphilosophy, in the name of humanity, of liberty, of reason, it shall be\r\nthat you shall take such an end; and then reason will still reign, for she\r\nwill have temples; yes, at the same time there will be no temples in all\r\nFrance, but temples of Reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Truly,\" said Chamfort, with a scornful smile, \"you will not be one of the\r\npriests in these temples?\"\r\n\r\n\"This I hope,\" replied Cazotte, \"but you, M. de Chamfort, who will be one\r\nof them--and very worthy you are to be one--you will open your veins with\r\ntwenty-two incisions of the razor--and yet you will only die a few months\r\nafterwards.\"\r\n\r\nThey look at each other, and continue to laugh. Cazotte continues:\r\n\r\n\"You, M. Vicq d'Azyr, you will not open your veins yourself; but afterwards\r\nyou will get them opened six times in one day, and during the night you\r\nwill die.\"\r\n\r\n\"You, M. Nicolli, you will die on the scaffold.\"\r\n\r\n\"You, M. Bailly, on the scaffold!\"\r\n\r\n\"You, M. Malesherbes--you, on the scaffold!\"\r\n\r\n\"God be thanked,\" exclaimed M. Roucher, \"it appears M. Cazotte has it to do\r\nonly with the Academy; he has just started a terrible butchery among them;\r\nI--thanks to heaven--\"\r\n\r\nCazotte interrupted him: \"you?--you, too, will die on the scaffold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! this is a bet,\" they exclaimed from all sides; \"he has sworn to\r\nextirpate everything!\"\r\n\r\n_Cazotte._--\"No, it is not I that has sworn it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must be put under the yokes of the Turks and Tartars?--and yet--\"\r\n\r\n_Cazotte._--\"Nothing less: I have told you already; you will then be only\r\nunder the reign of philosophy and reason; those who shall treat you in this\r\nmanner, will all be philosophers, will always carry on the same kind of\r\nconversation which you have peddled out for the last hour, will repeat all\r\nyour maxims; they will, like you, cite verses from Diderot and the\r\nPucelle.\"\r\n\r\nIt was whispered into one another's ear: \"You all see that he has lost his\r\nreason--(for he remains very serious while he is talking)--Do you not see\r\nthat he is joking?--and you know that he mixes something mysterious into\r\nall his jokes.\" \"Yes,\" said Chamfort, \"but I must confess his mysteries are\r\nnot agreeable, they are too scaffoldish! And when shall all this occur?\"\r\n\r\n_Cazotte._--\"Six years will not expire, before all I told you will be\r\nfulfilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many wonders.\" This time it was I (namely Laharpe) who took the\r\nword, \"and of me you say nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"With you,\" replied Cazotte, \"a wonder will take place, which will at least\r\nbe as extraordinary; you will then be a Christian!\"\r\n\r\nHere was a universal exclamation. \"Now I am easy,\" cried Chamfort, \"if we\r\ndon't perish until Laharpe is a Christian, we shall be immortal!\"\r\n\r\n\"We, of the female sex,\" then said the Duchess de Grammont, \"we are lucky\r\nthat we shall be counted as nothing with the revolutions. When I say\r\nnothing, I do not mean to say as if we would not mingle ourselves a little\r\ninto them; but it is assumed that nobody will, on that account, loath at us\r\nor at our sex.\"\r\n\r\n_Cazotte._--\"Your sex will this time not protect you, and you may ever so\r\nmuch desire not to mingle into anything; you will be treated just like men,\r\nand no distinction will be made!\"\r\n\r\n_Duchess._--\"But what do you tell us here, M. Cazotte? You preach to us the\r\nend of the world!\"\r\n\r\n_Cazotte._--\"That I do not know; but what I do know, is, that you, Madame\r\nDuchess, will be led to the scaffold, you, and many other ladies, and on\r\nthe public cart, with your hands tied on your back!\"\r\n\r\n_Duchess._--\"In this case, I hope I shall have a black trimmed coach?\"\r\n\r\n_Cazotte._--\"No, madam! Nobler ladies than you, shall, like you, be drawn\r\non that same cart, with the hands tied on the back!\"\r\n\r\n_Duchess._--\"Nobler ladies? How? the princesses by birth?\"\r\n\r\n_Cazotte._-\"Nobler yet!\"\r\n\r\nNow was observed a visible excitement in the whole company, and the master\r\nof the table took on a dark appearance; they began to see that the joke had\r\nbeen carried too far.\r\n\r\nMadame de Grammont, to scatter the clouds which the last answer had\r\noccasioned, contented herself by saying in a facetious tone: \"You shall see\r\nthat he will not even allow me the comfort of a father confessor!\"\r\n\r\n_Cazotte._--\"No, madam! you will not get one; neither you nor any one else!\r\nThe last one executed, who, out of mercy, will have received a father\r\nconfessor\"--here he stopped a moment--\r\n\r\n_Duchess._--\"Well, who will be the fortunate one, when this fortunate\r\npreference will be granted?\"\r\n\r\n_Cazotte._--\"It will be the only preference that he shall yet keep; and\r\nthis will be the king of France!\"\r\n\r\nNow the host arose from the table, and all with him. He went to Cazotte,\r\nand said with an excited voice, \"My dear M. Cazotte, this lamentable jest\r\nhas lasted long. You carry it too far, and within a degree where you place\r\nthe company in which you are, and yourself, into danger.\"\r\n\r\nCazotte answered not, and made himself ready to go away, when madame\r\nGrammont, who always tried to prevent the matter from being taken\r\nseriously, and exerted herself to restore the gaiety of the company, went\r\nto him, and said: \"Now, M. Prophet! you have told us all our fortunes, but\r\nyou say nothing of your own fate?\"\r\n\r\nHe was silent and cast down his eyes; then he said: \"Have you, madame,\r\nread, in Josephus, the history of the siege of Jerusalem?\"\r\n\r\n_Duchess._--\"Certainly! who has not read it? but you seem to think that I\r\nhave not!\"\r\n\r\n_Cazotte._--\"Well, madame, during the siege a man went round the city, upon\r\nthe walls, for seven days, in the face of the besiegers and the besieged,\r\nand cried continually, with a mournful voice, 'Wo unto Jerusalem! Wo unto\r\nJerusalem!' but on the seventh day he cried, 'Wo unto me!' and at that\r\nmoment he was dashed to pieces by an immense stone, which the machines of\r\nthe enemy had thrown.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these words, M. Cazotte bowed himself, and went away.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the above extraordinary prediction, a certain M.... has\r\ninserted the following article in the public journals of Paris: \"That he\r\nwell knew this M. Cazotte, and has often heard from him the announcement\r\nof the great oppression which was to come over France, and this at a time\r\nwhen not the least of it was suspected. The attachment to the monarchy was\r\nthe reason why, on the second of September, 1792, he was brought to the\r\nabbey, and was saved from the hands of the bloodthirsty rabble only through\r\nthe heroic courage of his daughter, who mitigated the raging populace. This\r\nsame rabble which wanted to destroy him, led him to his house in triumph.\r\nAll his friends came to congratulate him, that he had escaped death. A\r\ncertain M. D... who visited him after the terrible days, said to him: \"Now,\r\nyou are saved!\"--\"I believe it not,\" answered Cazotte; \"in three days I\r\nshall be guillotined!\"--\"How can this be?\" replied M. D... Cazotte\r\ncontinued: \"Yes, my friend, in three days I will die on the scaffold!\" As\r\nhe said this he was very much affected, and added: \"Shortly before your\r\narrival, I saw a gend'armes enter, who fetched me by order of Petion; I was\r\nunder the necessity of following him: I appeared before the mayor of Paris,\r\nwho ordered me to the _Conciergerie_, and thence I came before the\r\nrevolutionary tribunal. You see, therefore (by this vision, namely, which\r\nCazotte had seen), my friend, that my hour has arrived; and I am so much\r\nconvinced of this, that I am arranging my papers. Here are papers for which\r\nI care very much, which you will deliver to my wife; I entreat you to give\r\nthem to her, and to comfort her.\"\"\r\n\r\nM. D... declared this all folly, and left him with the conviction, that his\r\nreason had suffered by the sight of the scenes of terror from which he had\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nThe next day he came again; but he learned that a gensd'arme had taken M.\r\nCazotte to the Municipality. M. D... went to Petion; arrived at the\r\nmayoralty, he heard that his friend had just been taken to prison; he\r\nhurried thither; but he was informed that he could not speak to him, he\r\nwould be tried before the revolutionary tribunal. Soon after this, he heard\r\nthat his friend had been condemned and executed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREENWOOD.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nBY MAUNSELL B.

OAKLEY HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have \"laid\" the tiniest ghost of my professional duties. I shook off city\r\ndust twenty hours ago, and my lungs are rejoicing this August morning with\r\nthe glorious breezes that sweep from the summits of the \"Trimountains\" of\r\nWaywayanda lake--that stretches its ten miles expanse before my freshened\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nWaywayanda lake?\r\n\r\nA Quere. Shall I play geographer to those who are learned in the\r\nnomenclature of snobbism? Who allow innkeepers and railroad guides to\r\nassassinate Aboriginal terms in order that petty pride may exult in petty\r\nfame? No! But if snobbism has a curiosity, I refer it to the first\r\nlandscape painter of its vicinage: or the nearest fisherman amateur: or the\r\nRecorder of New-York: or sportsman Herbert and the pages of his \"Warwick\r\nWoodlands;\" a list of references worthy of the spot.\r\n\r\nAnd as I gaze and breathe I feel as if the waters before me had bubbled\r\nfrom the fountains of rejuvenescence for which Ponce de Leon so\r\nenthusiastically searched in the everglades of Florida; and as if, too, I\r\nhad just emerged from their embraces.\r\n\r\nMy pocket almanac says that I am living in the dogdays. Perhaps so. But\r\n\"Sirius\" hath no power around these mountains and primeval solitudes. Were\r\nthe fiercest theological controversialist at my elbow, he would be as cool\r\nas an Esquimaux.\r\n\r\nI feel at peace with all things. My friend M. says the conscience lieth in\r\nthe stomach. Perhaps so; and perhaps I owe my quietude of spirit to the\r\ninfluence of as comforting a breakfast as ever blessed the palate of a\r\nscientific egg-breaker.\r\n\r\nShall I join forces with the laughing beauties who are handling maces in\r\nthe billiard room of the inn hard by? Shall I challenge my \"Lady Gay\r\nSpanker\" of last night's acquaintance to a game of bowling? Shall I tempt\r\nthe unsophisticated pickerel of the lake under the shadow of yonder\r\nfrowning precipice, with glittering bait? Shall I clamber the mountain side\r\nand feast my vision with an almost boundless view--rich expanses of farm\r\nland stretching away for miles and miles, and edging themselves in the blue\r\nhaze of the horizon where the distant Catskill peaks rise solitary in their\r\nsublimity?\r\n\r\nIt is very comfortable here. Is there always poetry in motion? How far\r\ndistant are the confines of dreamland: that magical kingdom where the tired\r\nsoul satiates itself in the intoxications of fancy?\r\n\r\nI had just carefully deposited upon a velvety tuft of grass Ik Marvel's\r\n\"Reveries of a Bachelor.\" I had arrived at the conclusion that its pages\r\nshould be part and parcel of the landscape about. Surely there is a unison\r\nbetween them both. There are always certain places where only certain\r\nmelodies can be sung to the proper harmony of the heart-strings. Who ever\r\nlearned \"Thanatopsis\" on the summit of the Catskills, and afterwards forgot\r\na line of it? Now I have seen these same \"Reveries\" of the said bachelor\r\nupon many a centre-table: in the lap of many a town beauty, half cushioned\r\nin the velvet of a drawing room sofa: but the latter half of the volume\r\nnever looked so inviting as it does here just in the middle of one of\r\nnature's lexicons. May the page of it never be blurred.\r\n\r\nReveries of a Bachelor!\r\n\r\n'Tis a sugared pill of a title. Its morals are sad will o' wisps. And if\r\nthe definition \"that happiness consists in the search after it\" be true, it\r\nis so when the definition settles itself on the mind of a bachelor. Hath\r\n_he_ reveries half so sweet for morsels under the tongues of memory and\r\nfancy as those which come nigh to the brain of the married man? As sure as\r\nthe lesser is always included in the greater: as certain as the maxim _de\r\nminimis lex non curat_: the reveries of the first are but bound up in the\r\nreveries of the last; one is a _pleasing_ romance, the other its enchanting\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\nWhat is that yonder? There is a merry-faced form in the distant haze,\r\nshaking a dreamy negative with his head. A head whose reality is miles and\r\nmiles away, airing its brow of single blessedness in foreign travel.\r\n\r\nLet us argue the point: he smiles as if willing. Man socially is at least a\r\nthree volumed work: however much longer the James-like pen of destiny may\r\nextend him. Volume first--bachelor. Volume second--husband. Volume\r\nthird--father. There _may_ be a dozen more--there _should_ be none less.\r\n\r\nYou have been a bachelor: you are a husband and a father. You always had,\r\nperhaps, a bump of self-esteem attractive to the digits of Fowler. You\r\nnever believed half so well of yourself as when one morning at your\r\nbusiness you were first asked concerning the well being of your _family_.\r\nAt the moment, you were in a fog, like the young attorney upon the first\r\nquestion of his first examination: next, memory rallied and your face\r\nbrightened; your stature increased as you replied. You felt you were going\r\nup in the social numeration table of life. Two years ago you were a unit:\r\nyou next counted your importance by tens over the parson's shoulder; when\r\nyour child was born you felt that the leap to hundreds in the scale was far\r\nfrom enough and should have been higher.\r\n\r\nBefore the publication of your third volume--the father--you had been\r\nmeasurably blind. Your mental sight was afflicted with amaurosis. Like the\r\nphilosopher of old you are now tempted to grasp every one by the hand and\r\ncry \"Eureka.\" How indignantly you take down \"Malthus\" from your upper\r\nlibrary shelf and bury him on the lowest among the books of possible\r\nreference. Your political views upon education are cured of their jaundice.\r\nYou pray of Sundays in the service for the widow and the orphan with a\r\ndouble unction. You walk the streets with a new mantle of comfort. The\r\nlittle beggar child whose importunities of the last wet day at the street\r\ncrossings excited your petulance, upon the next wet day invites your\r\nsympathies. You stop and talk to her, nor perceive until you have\r\nascertained where her hard-hearted parents live, and that she is uncommonly\r\nbright for the child of poverty and wretchedness, and that you have a half\r\ndollar unappropriated--nor perceive until these are found out, I say, that\r\nyour umbrella has been dripping upon the skirts of your favorite coat, and\r\nthat you have stood with one foot in a puddle. How this would have annoyed\r\nyou years ago. But now--? How unconcernedly of the curious looks from\r\npedestrians around do you stop the careless nurse in Broadway, who has\r\nallowed her infant charge to fall asleep in a painful attitude, and lay\r\n\"it\" tenderly and comfortably in position. You recall to mind with much\r\nremorse the execrations of five years ago, when the moanings of a dying\r\nbabe in the next apartment to your own at the hotel disturbed your rest;\r\nand you wonder whether the mother still thinks of the little grave and the\r\nwhite slab which a sympathetic fancy _now_ brings up before you.\r\n\r\nYou are at your business: the lamps are lighting: in the suggestions of\r\nprofit by an hour or longer at the desk you recognize an unholy temptation.\r\nNow, as often before, through all the turmoils of business memory suggests\r\nthe lines of Willis:\r\n\r\n    \"I sadden when thou smilest to my smile,\r\n    Child of my love! I tremble to believe\r\n    That o'er the mirror of thine eye of blue\r\n    The shadow of my soul must always pass--\r\n    That soul which from its conflicts with the world\r\n    Comes _ever_ to thy guarded cradle home,\r\n    And careless of the staining dust it brings,\r\n    Asks for its idol!\"\r\n\r\nAnd you dwell on them. You bless the author first, and truly think how\r\ncruelly unjust are they who can call into torturing question the loyalty as\r\nhusband and father of him whose soul could plan and whose pen could write\r\nsuch holy lines. And then you think deeper of the sentiments. And then the\r\nprofit-tempter hides himself in the farthest corner of the money-drawer;\r\nand you begin to think your clerk a very clever manager: and wonder if\r\n_his_ remaining will not do as well--poor fellow, he's _only_ a bachelor.\r\nAnd then you decide that he will, and so yourself, \"careless of the\r\nstaining dust\" your coming brings, fly to \"the guarded cradle home.\"\r\n\r\nYou have been in Italy. Or you have studied the pictures in the _Louvre_.\r\nBut the hours which you passed before the canvas whereon was embodied\r\nMadonna and child never seemed so agreeable in their realization as they\r\nnow appear in the glass of memory, as you see the child of your love in the\r\narms of your life companion whose eyes, always bright to yours, and\r\nbrighter still at your coming after absence, grow brightest when they are\r\nlifted from the slumbering innocence beneath them. Men call you rough in\r\nyour bearing, perhaps. What would they say to see how gently your arms\r\nreceive the sleeping burthen and transfer it softly to its snowy couch?\r\nYour step abroad is heavy and impetuous: how noiselessly it falls upon the\r\nfloor--_now!_ And how the modulated voice accords with every present\r\nthought!\r\n\r\nYou cannot give the child a sweeter sleep by watching over him so intently:\r\nand yet you choose to stay. Moments are not so precious to you that at this\r\none household shrine they will become valueless in some most chastened\r\nheart-worship! Your infant does not when awake understand the language\r\nwhich your affection addresses: and yet you look with rapture to the\r\nfuture, when the now inquiring eye will become one of understanding; when\r\nthe cautiously put forth arms will clasp in loving confidence; when the\r\nfond endearing name now half intelligibly and doubtingly lisped forth will\r\nbe uttered in the boldness of love.\r\n\r\nThe shadowy form in the distant cloud over the lake has been listening\r\nintently. It listens still; and the face of it bends towards me as if to\r\nsay, there's a hidden truth and mysterious sympathy in all you say; and yet\r\nthe language soundeth strangely in these bachelor ears--\r\n\r\nBachelor ears!\r\n\r\nListless and deaf, as yet, to all the sweeter human music of our nature.\r\nDeafer yet to the clarion call of emulation in the race of life and\r\nstruggles for power, rank, and fame. Deafest of all to that which spurreth\r\non man to be a king of kings among the great men of his race.\r\n\r\nYou are a father, then, I say; and working in your mental toil by night and\r\nday, in the severest and darkest frowning of all professions. But in the\r\ncrowded senate-room, and in the close committee-chamber; and in the\r\ncourt-room among the multitudes of faces all about, (some of these\r\nanticipating in their changing features defeat and disgrace,) there is a\r\n_something_ which overrides all agitation: clears the heavy brain, and oils\r\nthe tongue with every pungency of rhetoric.\r\n\r\nWhat is that \"something?\"\r\n\r\nWere I home and in my library the downturned leaf of the duodecimo\r\nbiography in the left corner of the first shelf would tell it you at a\r\nglance. The biography of Lord Erskine; marked at the page which speaks of\r\nhis dauntless legal debut in the Sandwich case, when not the necessity of\r\nspeaking in a crowded court-room from the obscure back benches: when not\r\nthe sarcastic eyes of a hundred (etiquette-ly termed) brethren; when not\r\nthe awful presence of Lord Mansfield nor his rebuking interruption at a\r\ncritical sentence frightened the self-possession of the enthusiastic\r\nadvocate, or stopped the current of his eloquent invective. The biography,\r\nwhich goes on to tell how, when the speech was ended, all the attorneys in\r\nthe room flocked around the debutant with retainers--needed, more than all\r\nthe smiles and congratulations to be drawn from earnest heart-wells: and\r\nhow the advocate replied--(when some one, timid of the judge, asked how the\r\nbarrister had the courage to stand the rebuking interruption, and never to\r\nquail with embarrassment before it)--_I felt my little children tugging at\r\nmy gown and crying, now is the time, father, to get us bread_.\r\n\r\nHow eloquent!\r\n\r\nHow worthy of a father's heart! And in the reference, the dullest mind\r\ncannot fail to read the \"something\" which, to every father in a like\r\nposition, nerves the will, disarms all agitation, clears the heavy brain,\r\nand oils the tongue with every pungency of rhetoric.\r\n\r\n--The shadowy form turns closer towards me as my reverie yet chains me to\r\nthe lake side, where the mountain breezes still are freshening all the\r\nAugust air.--\r\n\r\nYou have a purpose now in life, which, like the messenger of the king, that\r\nevery morning knocked at his bedroom door to say, \"Oh king, remember all\r\nthis day that you are mortal,\" hourly brings to mind the bright reward of\r\nevery toil and every aspiration. Besides a physical frame there is a mental\r\nconstitution hinging on your own. There's a long life far beyond your own\r\nbrief years of breath to provide for. Your name is to be perpetuated. In\r\nthe very evening of your life there is to be a star that is now in its\r\nmorning of existence, which will cheer and enliven. You feel all this as in\r\nsome sad hour of the sickly night; you pace your room with the little\r\nsufferer wrestling with disease, and you feel that in the future will be\r\nfound ample rewards for all your present bitter draughts of anxiety.\r\n\r\nWrestling with disease!\r\n\r\nThe thought is ugly to the mental sight. I pause to brush its cobweb from\r\nmy August Reverie as an idle vaporish thing. But the shadowy form, in the\r\nedge of the distant cloud, over the far off waters of the lake, hisses the\r\nwords back into my brain. And then it comes nearer. And then the atmosphere\r\ngrows more dreamy and hazy about. And I half feel the mountain breezes, and\r\nhalf miss them from off my temples. And next I feel my thoughts less\r\nconcentrate, as the shadowy form I know so well seems to be looking under\r\nmy half-closed lids, and dwelling on the words I brushed like\r\ncob-webs--\"wrestling with disease.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I think of the still chamber, with the blue edge of the bracket, as it\r\nis rimmed with the faintest glimmer of the turned-down gas. And I see the\r\nhalf-closed shutters. And the tumbler with its significant spoon on the\r\nmantel. And the pale watcher by the ghostly curtains of the bed. And I am\r\nbending silently and almost pulseless over the sleeping boy, upon whose\r\nface each minute the fever-flushes play like summer lightning under a satin\r\ncloud.\r\n\r\nAnd days go by. There is a strange hush in the household, with a horridly\r\nsensitive jarring from the vehicles in the street, which never, never were\r\nbefore so noisy, neither have the thronging passengers from the pavements\r\never gossipped so discordantly, as they go under the windows of the silent\r\nhouse. There's a strange echo of infantile prattle by the niches on the\r\nlandings of the stairs, and from the couches, and behind the curtains; but\r\nthe substantive music, whence the conjured-up echo came, is nowhere found.\r\nThen the echo itself becomes but an illusion. And Memory is strangely and\r\nimpassionately chid for its creation.\r\n\r\nI pass into a little room scarcely wide enough to wheel a sofa within. It\r\nseems as boundless in its desolation as an untenanted temple-ruin. There\r\nare mournful spirits in the little atmosphere which sting me to the\r\nheart--not to be torn away. The little cotton-dog, and morocco-ball, and\r\njingling-bells, and coral-toys, so strangely scattered all about, are\r\nprodigious ruins to the sight. There's a gleeful laugh, a cunning smile, an\r\nartless waving of the hands, which should be here as tenants of the room.\r\nAll gone! all gone into that hushed and silent chamber where yet the\r\npatient-watcher is by the snowy curtains; and the sickly blue still edges\r\nthe rim of the bracket light, and the fever-flushes still play about the\r\nwasted cheek.\r\n\r\nHow long to last? What next to come? And the shadowy form no longer can\r\npeep under the all-closed eyelids, but enters its whisperings through the\r\ndelicate passages of the ear into the brain, which tortures in a maze of\r\nbitter conjecture and horrid contemplation. And my reverie becomes a\r\npainful nightmare dream.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the mountain-breezes, and the uprising-to-meridian sun, are merciful.\r\nThe shadowy form my reverie hinged itself upon is blown away. The open eyes\r\nonce more glance upon the glassy waters of the lake close by the shore, and\r\nonward to the dancing ripples far away. And a merry prattling voice, from\r\nout of loving arms, is coming nearer and nearer over the velvety lawn--a\r\nvoice so full of spirit, and life, and health, and sparkling innocence of\r\ncare, that in a moment the frightful nightmare-dream is quite forgotten.\r\n\r\nMore--\r\n\r\nMy reverie turns itself into a lesson of bright reality; a present study of\r\nbudding mind; a jealous watch of care encroaching upon innocence; a kindly\r\noutpouring of the father's manly heart upon the shrine of his idol.\r\n\r\nCould such a reverie better end?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEROINES OF HISTORY--LAURA.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE BY MARY E. HEWITT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaura, rendered immortal by the love and lyre of Petrarch, was the daughter\r\nof Audibert de Noves, who was of the _haute noblesse_ of Avignon. He died\r\nin the infancy of Laura, leaving her a dowry of one thousand gold crowns,\r\n(about fifty thousand dollars,) a magnificent portion for those times. She\r\nwas married at the age of eighteen to Hugh de Sade, a young noble only a\r\nfew years older than his bride, but not distinguished by any advantages\r\neither of person or mind. The marriage contract is dated in January, 1325,\r\ntwo years before her first meeting with Petrarch; and in it her mother, the\r\nLady Ermessende, and her brother, John de Noves, stipulate to pay the dower\r\nleft by her father; and also to bestow on the bride two magnificent dresses\r\nfor state occasions; one of green, embroidered with violets; the other of\r\ncrimson, trimmed with feathers. In all the portraits of Laura now extant,\r\nshe is represented in one of these two dresses, and they are frequently\r\nalluded to by Petrarch. He tells us expressly that when he first met her at\r\nmatins in the church of Saint Claire, she was habited in a robe of green\r\nspotted with violets. Mention is also made of a coronal of silver with\r\nwhich she wreathed her hair; of her necklaces and ornaments of pearls.\r\nDiamonds are not once alluded to because the art of cutting them had not\r\nthen been invented. From all which it appears that Laura was opulent, and\r\nmoved in the first class of society. It was customary for women of rank in\r\nthose times to dress with extreme simplicity on ordinary occasions, but\r\nwith the most gorgeous splendor when they appeared in public.\r\n\r\nThere are some beautiful descriptions of Laura surrounded by her young\r\nfemale companions, divested of all her splendid apparel, in a simple white\r\nrobe and a few flowers in her hair, but still preeminent over all by her\r\nsuperior loveliness.\r\n\r\nShe was in person a fair, Madonna-like beauty, with soft dark eyes, and a\r\nprofusion of pale golden hair parted on her brow, and falling in rich curls\r\nover her neck. The general character of her beauty must have been pensive,\r\nsoft, unobtrusive, and even somewhat languid. This softness and repose must\r\nnave been far removed from insipidity, for Petrarch dwells on the rare and\r\nvarying expression of her loveliness, the lightning of her smile, and the\r\ntender magic of her voice, which was felt in the inmost heart. He dwells on\r\nthe celestial grace of her figure and movements, and describes the beauty\r\nof her hand and the loveliness of her mouth. She had a habit of veiling her\r\neyes with her hand, and her looks were generally bent on the earth.\r\n\r\nIn a portrait of Laura, in the Laurentinian library at Florence, the eyes\r\nhave this characteristic downcast look.\r\n\r\nLaura was distinguished, then, by her rank and fortune, but more by her\r\nloveliness, her sweetness, and the untainted purity of her life and manners\r\nin the midst of a society noted for its licentiousness. Now she is known as\r\nthe subject of Petrarch's verses, as the woman who inspired an immortal\r\npassion, and, kindling into living fire the dormant sensibility of the\r\npoet, gave origin to the most beautiful and refined, the most passionate,\r\nand yet the most delicate amatory poetry that exists in the world.\r\n\r\nPetrarch was twenty-three years of age when he first felt the power of a\r\nviolent and inextinguishable passion. At six in the morning on the sixth of\r\nApril, A. D. 1327, (he often fondly records the exact year, day and hour,)\r\non the occasion of the festival of Easter, he visited the church of Saint\r\nClaire at Avignon, and beheld, for the first time, Laura de Sade. She was\r\njust twenty years of age, and in the bloom of beauty--a beauty so touching\r\nand heavenly, so irradiated by purity and smiling innocence, and so adorned\r\nby gentleness and modesty, that the first sight stamped the image in the\r\npoet's heart, never thereafter to be erased.\r\n\r\nPetrarch beheld the loveliness and sweetness of the young beauty, and was\r\ntransfixed. He sought acquaintance with her, and while the manners of the\r\ntimes prevented his entering her house, he enjoyed many opportunities of\r\nmeeting her in society, and of conversing with her. He would have declared\r\nhis love, but her reserve enforced silence. \"She opened my breast and took\r\nmy heart into her hand, saying 'speak no word of this,'\" he writes. Yet the\r\nreverence inspired by her modesty and dignity was not always sufficient to\r\nrestrain her lover. Being alone with her on one occasion, and she appearing\r\nmore gracious than usual, Petrarch tremblingly and fearfully confessed his\r\npassion; but she, with altered looks, replied, \"I am not the person you\r\ntake me for!\" Her displeasure froze the very heart of the poet, so that he\r\nfled from her presence in grief and dismay.\r\n\r\nNo attentions on his part could make any impression on her steady and\r\nvirtuous mind. While love and youth drove him on, she remained impregnable\r\nand firm; and when she found that he still rushed wildly forward, she\r\npreferred forsaking to following him to the precipice down which he would\r\nhave hurried her. Meanwhile, as he gazed on her angelic countenance, and\r\nsaw purity painted on it, his love grew spotless as herself. Love\r\ntransforms the true lover into a resemblance of the object of his passion.\r\nIn a town, which was the asylum of vice, calumny never breathed a taint\r\nupon Laura's name: her actions, her words, the very expression of her\r\ncountenance, and her slightest gestures were replete with a modest reserve\r\ncombined with sweetness, and won the applause of all.\r\n\r\nFrancesco Petrarch was of Florentine extraction, and the son of a notary,\r\nwho, being held in great esteem by his fellow-citizens, had filled several\r\npublic offices.\r\n\r\nWhen the Ghibelines were banished Florence, in 1302, Petraccolo was\r\nincluded in the number of exiles; his property was confiscated, and he\r\nretired with his wife, Eletta Canigiani, whom he had lately married, to the\r\ntown of Arrezzo, in Tuscany. And here on the night of the 20th of July,\r\n1304, Petrarch first saw the light. When the child was seven months old his\r\nmother was permitted to return from banishment, and she established herself\r\nat a country house belonging to her husband near Ancisa, a small town\r\nfifteen miles from Florence. The infant who, at his birth, it was supposed\r\nwould not survive, was exposed to imminent peril during this journey. In\r\nfording a rapid stream, the man who had charge of him carried him, wrapped\r\nin swaddling clothes, at the end of a stick; he fell from his horse, and\r\nthe babe slipped from the fastenings into the water; but he was saved, for\r\nhow could Petrarch die until he had seen his Laura?\r\n\r\nThe youth of Petrarch was obscure in point of fortune, but it was attended\r\nby all the happiness that springs from family concord, and the excellent\r\ncharacter of his parents. At the age of fifteen he was sent to study in the\r\nuniversity of Montpellier, then frequented by a vast concourse of students.\r\nHis father intended his son to pursue the study of the law, as the\r\nprofession best suited to ensure his reputation and fortune; but to this\r\npursuit Francesco was invincibly repugnant. He was soon after sent to\r\nBologna, where, as at Montpellier, he continued to display great taste for\r\nliterature, much to his father's dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt Bologna, Petrarch made considerable progress in the study of the law,\r\nmoved thereto, doubtless, by the entreaties of his excellent parent.\r\n\r\nAfter three years spent at Bologna, Petrarch was recalled to France by the\r\ndeath of his father. Soon after his mother died also, and he and his\r\nbrother were left entirely to their own guidance, with very slender means,\r\nand those diminished by the dishonesty of those whom his father named as\r\ntrustees to their fortune. Under these circumstances Petrarch entirely\r\nabandoned the profession of the law, as it occurred to both him and his\r\nbrother that the clerical profession was their best resource in a city\r\nwhere the priesthood reigned supreme. They resided at Avignon, and became\r\nthe favorites and companions of the ecclesiastical and lay nobles who\r\nformed the papal court. His talents and accomplishments were of course the\r\ncause of this distinction; besides that his personal advantages were such\r\nas to prepossess every one in his favor. He was so handsome as frequently\r\nto attract observation when he passed along the streets. When, to the\r\nutmost simplicity and singleness of mind, were added splendid talents, the\r\ncharm of poetry, so highly valued in the country of the Troubadours, an\r\naffectionate and generous disposition, vivacious and pleasing manners, an\r\nengaging and attractive exterior; we cannot wonder that Petrarch was the\r\ndarling of his age, the associate of its greatest men, and the man whom\r\nprinces delighted to honor.\r\n\r\nThe passion of Petrarch for Laura was purified and exalted at the same\r\ntime. She filled him with noble aspirations, and divided him from the\r\ncommon herd. He felt that her influence made him superior to vulgar\r\nambition, and rendered him wise, true, and great. She saved him in the\r\ndangerous period of youth, and gave a worthy aim to all his endeavors. The\r\nmanners of his age permitted one solace; a Platonic attachment was the\r\nfashion of the day. The Troubadours had each a lady to adore, to wait upon,\r\nand to celebrate in song; without its being supposed that she made him any\r\nreturn beyond a gracious acceptance of his devoirs, and allowing him to\r\nmake her the heroine of his verses. Petrarch endeavored to merge the living\r\npassion of his soul into this airy and unsubstantial devotion. Laura\r\npermitted the homage: she perceived his merit and was proud of his\r\nadmiration; she felt the truth of his affection, and indulged the wish of\r\npreserving it and her own honor at the same time. Without her\r\ninflexibility, this had been a dangerous experiment: but she always kept\r\nher lover distant from her; rewarding his reserve with smiles, and\r\nrepressing by frowns all the overflowings of his heart.\r\n\r\nBy her resolute severity, she incurred the danger of ceasing to be the\r\nobject of his attachment, and of losing the gift of an immortal name, which\r\nhe has conferred upon her. But Petrarch's constancy was proof against\r\nhopelessness and time. He had too fervent an admiration of her qualities\r\never to change: he controlled the vivacity of his feelings, and they became\r\ndeeper rooted. \"Untouched by my prayers,\" he says, \"unvanquished by my\r\narguments, unmoved by my flattery, she remained faithful to her sex's\r\nhonor; she resisted her own young heart, and mine, and a thousand, thousand\r\nthings, which must have conquered any other. She remained unshaken. A woman\r\ntaught me the duty of a man! to persuade me to keep the path of virtue, her\r\nconduct was at once an example and a reproach.\"\r\n\r\nBut whether, in this long conflict, Laura preserved her heart untouched, as\r\nwell as her virtue immaculate; whether she shared the love she inspired; or\r\nwhether she escaped from the captivating assiduities and intoxicating\r\nhomage of her lover, \"fancy free;\" whether coldness, or prudence, or pride,\r\nor virtue, or the mere heartless love of admiration, or a mixture of all\r\ntogether, dictated her conduct, is at least as well worth inquiry as the\r\ncolor of her eyes, or the form of her nose, upon which we have pages of\r\ngrave discussion. She might have been _coquette par instinct_, if not _par\r\ncalent_; she might have felt, with feminine _tacte_, that to preserve her\r\ninfluence over Petrarch, it was necessary to preserve his respect. She was\r\nevidently proud of her conquest: she had else been more or less than woman;\r\nand at every hazard, but that of self-respect, she was resolved to retain\r\nhim. If Petrarch absented himself for a few days, he was generally better\r\ntreated on his return. If he avoided her, then her eye followed him with a\r\nsofter expression. When he looked pale from sickness of heart and agitation\r\nof spirits, Laura would address him with a few words of pitying tenderness.\r\nWhen he presumed on this benignity, he was again repulsed with frowns. He\r\nflew to solitude,--solitude! Never let the proud and torn heart, wrung with\r\nthe sense of injury, and sick with unrequited passion, seek that worst\r\nresource against pain, for there grief grows by contemplating itself, and\r\nevery feeling is sharpened by collision. Petrarch sought to \"mitigate the\r\nfever of his heart\" amid the shades of Vaucluse, a spot so gloomy, and so\r\nsolitary, that his very servants forsook him; and Vaucluse, its fountains,\r\nits forests, and its hanging cliffs, reflected only the image of Laura.\r\n\r\nHe passed several years thus, cut off from society; his books were his\r\ngreat resource; he was never without one in his hand. Often he remained in\r\nsilence from morning till night, wandering among the hills when the sun was\r\nyet low; and taking refuge, during the heat of the day, in his shady\r\ngarden. At night, after performing his clerical duties (for he was canon of\r\nLombes), he rambled among the hills; often entering, at midnight, the\r\ncavern, whose gloom, even during the day, struck his soul with awe. \"Fool\r\nthat I was!\" he exclaims in after life, \"not to have remembered the first\r\nschool-boy lesson--that solitude is the nurse of love!\"\r\n\r\nWhile living at Vaucluse, Petrarch, invited to Rome by the Roman Senate,\r\nrepaired thither to receive the laurel crown of poesy. The ceremony was\r\nperformed in the Capitol with great solemnity, in presence of all the\r\nnobles and high-born ladies of the city. Leaving Rome soon after his\r\ncoronation, he repaired to Parma, where Clement VI. rewarded him for\r\nsubsequent political services by naming him prior of Migliarino in the\r\ndiocese of Pisa.\r\n\r\nPetrarch returned to Avignon. The sight of Laura gave fresh energy to a\r\npassion which had survived the lapse of fifteen years. She was no longer\r\nthe blooming girl who had first charmed him. The cares of life had dimmed\r\nher beauty. She was the mother of many children, and had been afflicted at\r\nvarious times by illness. Her home was not happy. Her husband, without\r\nloving or appreciating her, was ill-tempered and jealous. Petrarch\r\nacknowledged that if her personal charms had been her sole attraction he\r\nhad already ceased to love her. But his passion was nourished by sympathy\r\nand esteem; and, above all, by that mysterious tyranny of love, which,\r\nwhile it exists, the mind of man seems to have no power of resisting,\r\nthough in feebler minds it sometimes vanishes like a dream. Petrarch was\r\nalso changed in personal appearance. His hair was sprinkled with gray, and\r\nlines of care and sorrow trenched his face. On both sides the tenderness of\r\naffection began to replace, in him the violence of passion, in her the\r\ncoyness and severity she had found necessary to check his pursuit. The\r\njealousy of her husband opposed obstacles to their seeing each other. They\r\nmet as they could in public walks and assemblies. Laura sang to him, and a\r\nsoothing familiarity grew up between them as her fears became allayed, and\r\nhe looked forward to the time when they might sit together and converse\r\nwithout dread.\r\n\r\nAt length he resolved to leave Laura and Avignon forever; and instead of\r\nplunging into solitude, to seek the wiser resource of travel and society.\r\nLaura saw him depart with regret. When he went to take leave of her, he\r\nfound her surrounded by a circle of her ladies. Her mien was dejected; a\r\ncloud overcast her face, whose expression seemed to say, \"Who takes my\r\nfaithful friend from me?\" Petrarch was struck to the heart by a sad\r\npresentiment: the emotion was mutual; they both seemed to feel that they\r\nshould never meet again.\r\n\r\nPetrarch departed. The plague, which had been extending its ravages over\r\nAsia, entered Europe. It spread far and wide: nearly one half the\r\npopulation of the world became its prey. Petrarch saw thousands die around\r\nhim, and he trembled for his friends. He heard that it was at Avignon. A\r\nthousand sad presentiments haunted his mind. At last the fatal truth\r\nreached him, Laura was dead! By a singular coincidence, she died on the\r\nanniversary of the day when he first saw her. She was taken ill on the\r\nthird of April, and languished but three days. As soon as the symptoms of\r\nthe plague declared themselves, she prepared to die: she made her will,\r\nwhich is dated on the third of April, and received the sacraments of the\r\nchurch. On the sixth she died, surrounded by her friends and the noble\r\nladies of Avignon, who braved the dangers of infection to attend on one so\r\nlovely and so beloved. On the evening of the same day on which she died,\r\nshe was interred in the chapel of the Cross which her husband had lately\r\nbuilt in the church of the Minor Friars at Avignon.\r\n\r\nHer tomb was discovered and opened in 1533, in the presence of Francis the\r\nFirst, whose celebrated stanzas on the occasion are well known.\r\n\r\nOf the fame which, even in her lifetime, love and poetical adoration of\r\nPetrarch had thrown around his Laura, a curious instance is given which\r\nwill characterize the manners of the age. When Charles of Luxembourg\r\n(afterwards Emperor) was at Avignon, a grand fete was given, in his honor,\r\nat which all the noblesse were present. He desired that Petrarch's Laura\r\nshould be pointed out to him; and when she was introduced, he made a sign\r\nwith his hand that the other ladies present should fall back; then going up\r\nto Laura, and for a moment contemplating her with interest, he kissed her\r\nrespectively on the forehead and on the eyelids.\r\n\r\nPetrarch survived her twenty-six years, dying in 1374. He was found\r\nlifeless one morning in his study, his hand resting on a book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING AND OUTLAW.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Robin Hood was a gentleman,\r\n      An outlaw bold was he;\r\n    He lost his Earldom and his land,\r\n      And took to the greenwood tree.\r\n\r\n    The king had just come home from war\r\n      With the Soldan over sea;\r\n    And Robin dwelt in merry Sherwood,\r\n      And lived by archerie.\r\n\r\n    Five bucks as fat as fat could be,\r\n      Were bleeding on the ground,\r\n    When up there came a hunter bright,\r\n      With a horn and leashed hound.\r\n\r\n    \"Who's this, who's this, i' th' merry greenwood?\r\n      Who's this with horn and hound?\r\n    We'll hang him, an' he pay not down\r\n      For his life a thousand pound.\r\n\r\n    \"Come hither, hither, Friar John,\r\n      And count your rosarie,\r\n    And shrive this sinful gentleman,\r\n      Under the greenwood tree!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Stand back, stand back, thou wicked Friar,\r\n      Nor dare to stop my way;\r\n    I'll tear your cowl and cassock off,\r\n      And hurl your beads away!\"\r\n\r\n    \"Nay! hold your hands, my merry man!\r\n      I like his gallant mood;\r\n    Sir Hunter pray you take a staff,\r\n      And play with Robin Hood.\"\r\n\r\n    They played an hour with quarter staffs,\r\n      A good long hour or more,\r\n    And Robin Hood was beat at the game,\r\n      That never was beat before.\r\n\r\n    \"Hold off, hold off,\" he said at length,\r\n      And wiped the blood away;\r\n    \"Thou art a noble gentleman,\r\n      Come dine with me to-day.\"\r\n\r\n    \"With the quarter staff, as a yeoman might,\r\n      For love I played with thee;\r\n    Now draw thy sword, as fits a knight,\r\n      And play awhile with me.\"\r\n\r\n    They fought an hour with rapiers keen,\r\n      A weary hour or more,\r\n    And Robin Hood began to fail,\r\n      That never failed before.\r\n\r\n    But still he fought as best he might,\r\n      In the summer's burning heat,\r\n    Till he sank at last with loss of blood,\r\n      And fell at the Stranger's feet.\r\n\r\n    He brought him water from the spring,\r\n      And took him by the hand;\r\n    \"Rise up!\" he said, \"my good old Earl,\r\n      The best man in the land!\r\n\r\n    \"Rise up, rise up, Earl Huntington,\r\n      No longer Robin Hood;\r\n    I will be king in London town,\r\n      And you in green Sherwood!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT ESCARPACIO'S BONES.\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon a fine May morning in the year 1585, a Spanish vessel lay at anchor in\r\nthe Port of St. Jago, in the island of Cuba. She was about to sail for\r\nCadiz, the passengers were on board, and the sailors at their several\r\nstations, awaiting the word of command. The captain, a small, tight-built,\r\nshrewd-looking man, with the voice and manner of a naval officer, which,\r\nindeed, he had formerly been, was brave and experienced, and although\r\nsomewhat wild and daring, he was a good fellow at heart, but now and then\r\nviolent and headstrong to a fault, in short, Captain Perez was the terror\r\nof his men.\r\n\r\nHe was walking the deck with rapid strides, and exhibiting the greatest\r\nimpatience, now stopping to observe the direction of the wind, and casting\r\na glance at the shore, then resuming his walk with a preliminary stamp of\r\ndisappointment and vexation; no one, in the meanwhile, daring to ask why he\r\ndelayed getting under way.\r\n\r\nAt length strains of church music at a distance are heard on board the\r\nvessel, and all eyes are directed to the shore. A long procession of monks,\r\nholding crosses and lighted wax tapers, and singing, is seen approaching\r\nthe beach opposite the vessel. The procession moves slowly and solemnly to\r\nthe cadence of the music. Between two rows of monks dressed in deep black\r\nis a coffin richly decorated with all the symbols of the Catholic faith,\r\nand covered with garlands and chaplets, and, what is singular, the coffin\r\nis carried with difficulty by six stout negroes. Four venerable Jesuits\r\nsupport the corners of the pall, and, immediately behind the coffin, walks\r\nalone, with a grave and dignified step, the Right Reverend Father Antonio,\r\nsuperior of the Jesuit missionaries of the island of Cuba. An immense crowd\r\nof citizens, the garrison of the island, and the military and civil\r\nauthorities, piously form the escort.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the singing ceases, the procession halts, the coffin is placed on\r\nelevated supporters. Father Antonio approaches it, and, kissing the pall\r\nwith reverence, exclaims, with a solemnity befitting the occasion,\r\n\r\n\"Adieu! Saint Escarpacio, thou worthy model of our order, adieu! In\r\nseparating myself from thy holy remains, I fulfil thy last wishes; may they\r\npiously repose in our happy Spain, and may thy saintly vows and aspirations\r\nbe thus accomplished. But before their departure from our shores, we\r\nconjure thee, holy saint, to look down from thy holy place of rest in\r\nheaven, and deign to bless this people, and us, thy mourning friends on\r\nearth.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole assembly then knelt upon the ground, after which the negroes,\r\nresuming their heavy burden, carried it on board a boat, closely followed\r\nby Father Antonio. With vigorous rowing the boat soon reached the vessel's\r\nside, and the coffin was hoisted on board.\r\n\r\n\"You are very late, reverend father,\" said Captain Perez, \"and you know\r\n_wind and tide wait for no man_. I ought to have been far on my way long\r\nbefore this hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could not get ready sooner, my son,\" the holy father replied, \"but fear\r\nnot, God will reward you for the delay, and these precious remains will\r\nspeed you on your voyage. I hope you have made your own private cabin, as\r\nyou promised, worthy of their reception?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly, I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not for a moment lose sight of the coffin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make yourself easy on that point, holy father; I shall watch over it as if\r\nit were my own. Hollo there forward, bear a hand aft,\" the captain cried.\r\n\r\nFour sailors place themselves at the corners of the coffin, but they can\r\nhardly raise it from the deck; two more are called, and the six, bending\r\nunder its weight, succeed in carrying it down into the cabin, followed by\r\nthe Captain and by Father Antonio.\r\n\r\nWhen the coffin was properly bestowed, the reverend father addressed\r\nCaptain Perez in the most earnest and solemn manner:\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will be found worthy of the great confidence and trust I now\r\nrepose in you. These precious remains should occupy your every moment, and\r\nyou will sacredly and faithfully account to me for their safety--the\r\nsmallest negligence will cost you dear. On your arrival at Cadiz, you will\r\ndeliver the coffin to none other than Father Hieronimo, and not to him\r\neven, unless he shall first place in your hands a letter from me--you\r\nunderstand my instructions and commands? Now depart, and may God speed you\r\non your way.\"\r\n\r\nFather Antonio then came upon deck, and bestowed his benediction upon the\r\nvessel, and upon all it contained; after which, descending to the boat, he\r\nwas rowed to the shore. As he placed himself at the head of the procession,\r\nthe singing recommenced, the anchor was weighed, and, to the sound of\r\nmusic, the cheering of the people, and the roar of cannon, the vessel moved\r\nslowly on her destined voyage.\r\n\r\nWhen fairly at sea, the wind was favorable, and all went well. The second\r\nevening out, Captain Perez was alone in his private cabin, and in a\r\ncontemplative mood, when the feeble light of the single lamp glancing\r\nacross the coffin, as the vessel rocked from side to side, attracted his\r\nattention, and led him to think about the singularity of its great weight.\r\n\r\n\"It is very strange,\" he said musingly, \"six stout fellows to carry a man's\r\ndry bones!--it cannot be possible. But what does the coffin contain if it\r\ndoes not contain the saint's bones? Father Antonio was very, _very_\r\nparticular. I should really like to know what there is in the coffin. It\r\ntook a good half dozen strong healthy negroes, and then as many sailors, to\r\ncarry it: what can there be in the coffin? Why, after all, I _can_ know if\r\nI please. I have but to take out a few screws, it can be done without the\r\nslightest noise, and I am alone, and the cabin door is easily fastened.\"\r\n\r\nSuiting the action to his soliloquy, he bolted the door of the cabin, took\r\nfrom his tool-chest a screw-driver, and, after a moment's indecision, began\r\ncautiously to loosen one of the screws in the lid of the coffin, his hands\r\nall the while trembling violently.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" thought he, \"I am committing a heinous sin, if the saint should start\r\nup, and if, in his anger, he should in some appalling manner punish my\r\nsacrilegious meddling with his bones?\"\r\n\r\nA cold sweat overspread his bronzed visage, and he stood still a moment,\r\nhesitating as to whether he should go on. But curiosity conquered, and he\r\nrallied his energies with the reflection, that if he opened the coffin,\r\nSaint Escarpacio himself well knew it was only to find out what made his\r\nbones so heavy; there could be no impiety in that--quite the contrary. His\r\nconscience was by this time somewhat fortified, his superstitious fears\r\ngradually grew fainter, and keeping his eyes steadily fixed upon the lid of\r\nthe coffin--to be sure the saint did not stir--he slowly and silently took\r\nout the first screw. He then stopped short: the saint showed no signs of\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it,\" said Perez, going to work more boldly upon the second screw,\r\n\"I knew there was nothing sinful in opening the coffin, for the sin lies in\r\nthe intention.\"\r\n\r\nAll the screws were soon drawn out, and to gratify his curiosity it only\r\nremained to raise the coffin lid, and here his heart beat violently--but\r\ncourage--Perez did raise the lid, _and, and, he saw--no saint, but hay--the\r\nhay is carefully removed--then strips of linen--they are removed--then hay\r\nagain, but no saint, nothing like the bone of a saint--but a wooden box_.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is odd,\" thought Perez, \"and what can there be in it? I must\r\nopen the box, but how? there is no key, what is to be done? Shall I force\r\nthe lock, or break the cover of the box? Either attempt would make a noise,\r\nwhich the passengers or sailors might hear, but what is to be done? Good\r\nSaint Escarpacio, take pity on me, and direct me how to open the box,\"\r\nwhispered Perez, and there was perhaps a little irony in the supplication.\r\n\r\nIn feeling among the hay surrounding the box, Perez found a key at one of\r\nits corners secured by a small iron chain.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! ha! I have it at last\" Perez cried, \"_the key, the key_,\" and quickly\r\nputting it into the key-hole, he opened the Box--and he saw--what?\r\n_Leathern bags filled to the top_ according to the beautifully written\r\ntickets, with GOLD PISTOLES--SILVER CROWNS, closely ranged in shining\r\npiles--all in the most perfect order. \"But what is this? a letter? I must\r\nread it,\" exclaimed the excited Perez--\"_by your leave, gentle wax_,\" and\r\nhe tears the letter open. It began thus:\r\n\r\n\"Father Antonio, of Cuba, to the reverend fathers in Cadiz, greeting.\r\n\r\n\"As agreed between us, Most Reverend Fathers, I send you THREE HUNDRED\r\nTHOUSAND LIVRES, in the name, and under the semblance of Father Escarpacio,\r\nwhose bones I am supposed to be sending to Spain. The annexed memorandum of\r\naccounts will show that this sum comprises the whole of our little\r\ngleanings and savings up to this time, for the benefit of our Holy Order.\r\nYou will pardon I am sure this innocent artifice on our part, Most Reverend\r\nFathers, as it will prove a safeguard to the treasure, and avoid awakening\r\nthe avarice and cupidity of the person to whom I am obliged to intrust it.\r\n(Signed) ANTONIO, of Cuba.\"\r\n\r\n\"Three hundred thousand livres! there are, then, three hundred thousand\r\nlivres,\" exclaimed Perez in amazement, as he realized that this immense sum\r\nlay in real gold and silver coin before his eyes. \"Oh, reverend, right\r\nreverend and worthy fellows of the crafty Ignatius! you are indeed cunning\r\nfoxes! a hundred to one your trick was not discovered, for who but a Jesuit\r\ncould have imagined it, and who could have guessed that the coffin\r\ncontained _money_? And so these bags of gold are your _holy remains_, and I\r\ntoo, old sea shark as I am, to be humbugged like a land lubber, with your\r\nprocession and your mummery--but I am deceived no longer, my eyes are\r\nopened; and by my patron saint, trick for trick my pious masters--bones you\r\nshall have, and burn me for a heretic, if you get any thing better than\r\nbones;\" and he began to untie and examine the contents of the money-bags.\r\n\"Let me consider\" said he, \"I want some bones, and where the devil shall I\r\nfind them?\"\r\n\r\nHe was on his knees, his body bent over the box, with his hands in the open\r\ngold-bags. His agitated countenance expressed with energy the mingled\r\nemotions, of desire to keep the rich booty all to himself, and of fear that\r\nin some mysterious manner it might elude his grasp--but he must, he _must_\r\nhave it.\r\n\r\n\"A lucky thought strikes me,\" said he; \"what a fool I am to give myself any\r\ntrouble about it. What says my bill of lading? '_Received from the Reverend\r\nFather Antonio, a coffin containing bones, said to be those of Saint\r\nEscarpacio._' A coffin containing bones, said to be those, &c.--very good,\r\nand have I seen the bones, _said_ to be delivered to me, and _said_ to be\r\nthe saint's bones? certainly not, and the coffin might contain--any thing\r\nelse--_the said coffin containing_--what you please--how should I know?\r\n_said to be the bones of Saint Escarpacio_,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nIn short, Captain Perez began noiselessly and methodically to empty the box\r\nof its bags of gold and piles of silver, taking care to stow the treasure\r\naway in a chest, to which he alone had access. He then filled the box with\r\nwhatever was at hand, bits of rusty iron, lead, stones, shells, old junk,\r\nhay, &c., substituting as nearly as possible pound for pound in weight if\r\nnot in value, conscientiously adding some bones which were far removed from\r\n_canonisation_, and at last carefully screwing down the lid, the right\r\nreverend father Antonio himself, had he been on board, could not have\r\ndiscovered that the coffin had been touched by mortal hand.\r\n\r\nIn about a month the vessel arrived at the port of Cadiz. The quarantine\r\nfor some unexplained reason was much shorter than usual, and had hardly\r\nexpired, when a venerable Jesuit was the first person who stood before the\r\ncaptain, a few minutes only after he had taken possession of his lodgings\r\non shore.\r\n\r\n\"I would speak with Captain Perez,\" said the Jesuit, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"I am he,\" the captain replied, somewhat disconcerted at the abruptness of\r\nthe inquiry. Quickly recovering his presence of mind, however, he added,\r\nwith perfect calmness, \"You have probably come, holy father, to take charge\r\nof the precious remains intrusted to my care by Father Antonio, of Cuba?\"\r\nThe Jesuit bowed his head, in token of assent.\r\n\r\n\"And I have the honor of addressing Father Hieronimo?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"You are no doubt the bearer of a letter for me, from Father Antonio?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" said Father Hieronimo, handing Captain Perez a letter.\r\n\r\n\"I beg a thousand pardons, holy father,\" the captain said, with much\r\nhumility, \"but I hope you will not take offence at these necessary\r\nprecautions?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary they speak in your favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see all is right,\" said the captain, \"and I will go myself and order the\r\ncoffin brought on shore.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain went immediately on board, Father Hieronimo meanwhile placing\r\nhimself at an open window whence he could over-look the vessel and watch\r\nevery movement. The coffin was brought on shore by eight sailors, who,\r\nbending under its weight, slowly approach the captain's quarters.\r\n\r\n\"How heavy it is, how _very_ heavy,\" said the Jesuit, rubbing his hands in\r\nexultation.\r\n\r\nCaptain Perez had of course accompanied the coffin from the vessel, and now\r\nthat he was about to deliver it into Father Hieronimo's keeping, he said to\r\nhim, in a solemn and impressive manner,\r\n\r\n\"I place in your hands, holy father, the precious remains intrusted to my\r\ncare.\"\r\n\r\n\"I receive them with pious joy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The responsibility was great.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will henceforth be mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a precious treasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very precious.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have watched over it with vigilance.\"\r\n\r\n\"God will reward you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so.\"\r\n\r\n\"From this hour every thing will prosper with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think so, holy father?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it. I must now bid you adieu.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have forgotten, holy father, to give me a receipt; but if--\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said the Jesuit, \"it had escaped me.\" And he seated\r\nhimself at a table on which lay writing materials, first sending a servant\r\nfor his carriage.\r\n\r\nThe receipt spoke of the piety and zeal of Captain Perez in the most\r\nflattering terms; and, while the captain was reading it with becoming\r\nhumility, the carriage drew up opposite to the coffin, which was soon\r\nresting upon the cushioned seats within the vehicle.\r\n\r\n\"I go immediately to Madrid,\" said Father Hieronimo. \"You can no doubt\r\nimagine the impatience of the holy fathers to possess the sacred relics;\r\nthey have waited so long. Once more adieu, believe me we shall never forget\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, and a parting benediction on Perez, Father Hieronimo\r\nstepped into the carriage, and, with his holy remains by his side, started\r\nat a brisk trot of his well-fed mules on the road to Madrid. When fairly\r\nout of sight and hearing of Captain Perez, the good father laughed aloud.\r\n\"The captain, poor simple soul,\" said he, \"suspects nothing.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Perez, he too would have laughed aloud if he had dared; indeed he could\r\nwith difficulty restrain himself in presence of his crew. \"The crafty old\r\nfox,\" he said exultingly, \"he has got his holy remains--ha! ha!--and he\r\n_suspects nothing_.\"\r\n\r\nA day or two after the delivery of the coffin, Captain Perez sailed for\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval of ten years, during which period, according to the\r\nJesuit's prediction, prosperity had constantly waited upon Perez, he became\r\nweary of successful enterprise, and tired of the roving and laborious life\r\nhe was leading. Worth a million, and a bachelor, he wisely resolved to give\r\nthe remainder of his days to enjoyment. Seville was judiciously selected\r\nfor his residence, where a magnificent mansion, extensive grounds, a well\r\nfurnished cellar, good cooks, chosen friends, with all the other et ceteras\r\nwhich riches can bring, enabled him to pass his days and nights joyously.\r\nCaptain Perez was indeed a _happy dog_.\r\n\r\nOne night he was at table, surrounded by his friends of both sexes. The\r\ncook had done his duty; there were excellent fruits from the tropics; there\r\nwere wines in abundance and variety, and with songs and laughter the very\r\nwindows rattled, when Perez, the jolly Perez, _half seas over_, begged a\r\nmoment's silence.\r\n\r\n\"I say, my worthy friends, I have something to tell you better than all\r\nyour singing. I must tell you a story that will make you split your\r\nsides--a real good one, about a capital trick I served them poor devils the\r\nJesuits. You must know I was lying at anchor in Cuba, and--\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the door of the apartment is thrown open with great violence, and\r\na monk, clothed in deep black, enters, followed by a guard of _alguazils_\r\narmed to the teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Profane impious wretches!\" he cried, in a voice of appalling harshness,\r\n\"is it thus you do penance for your sins? Is it in riotous feasting and\r\ndrunkenness you spend the holy season of Lent?\" Then, turning to Captain\r\nPerez, he said, \"Follow me to the palace of the Holy Inquisition. Before\r\nthat tribunal you must answer for your sacrilegious conduct.\"\r\n\r\nThe guests were stupefied with fear, and Perez, now completely sobered,\r\nstared in affright at the monk.\r\n\r\n\"Do you recollect me, Captain Perez?\" said the monk.\r\n\r\n\"No--but--it appears to me I have somewhere seen--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Father Antonio, of Cuba,\" cried the monk, fixing his eyes, sparkling\r\nwith savage fury, upon Perez.\r\n\r\n\"And you are a member of the Holy Inquisition?\" Perez faltered out in\r\ntrembling accents.\r\n\r\n\"I am. Again I say, follow me on the instant.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Captain Perez, or rather rich Captain Perez, at the early day in which\r\nhe lived had, perhaps, never heard the avowal made by a man who, in\r\nspeaking of honesty and dishonesty, declared _honesty to be the best\r\npolicy, for_, said he, _I have tried both_.\r\n\r\nThat the captain was not born to be hanged is certain; and although from\r\nchildhood a sojourner upon the ocean, it was not his destiny to be drowned.\r\nThere is a tradition handed down, that had it not been for very\r\nconsiderable donations, under his hand and seal, to a religious community\r\nin Spain, a method of bidding adieu to this life more in accordance with\r\nthe pious notions prevalent three hundred years ago, would certainly have\r\nbeen chosen for our hero. Indeed, there were not wanting many\r\nheretic-hating persons who affirmed that an _auto-da-fe_ was got up\r\nexpressly for the occasion.

P. R. JAMES, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton fancied herself in high good luck; for just as she was\r\npassing through the door into the hall, Lady Hastings' maid crossed and\r\nmade her a curtsey. Mrs. Hazleton beckoned her up, saying in a quiet, easy,\r\nevery-day tone, \"I suppose your lady is awake by this time?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, madam,\" replied the maid, \"she is asleep still. She did not take her\r\nnap as early as usual to-day; for Mistress Emily was with her, and my lady\r\nwould not go to sleep till she went out to take a walk.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton was somewhat alarmed at this intelligence; for she had not\r\nmuch confidence in her good friend's discretion. \"How is Miss Emily?\" she\r\nsaid in a tender tone. \"She seemed very sad and low when last I saw her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is just the same, Madam,\" replied the maid. \"She did not seem very\r\ncheerful when she went out, and has been crying a good deal to-day.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton was better satisfied, and paused for an instant to think; but\r\nthe maid interrupted her cogitations by saying--\"I think I may wake my lady\r\nnow, if you please to come up, Madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear, no,\" replied Mrs. Hazleton. \"Do not wake her. I will go in\r\nquietly and sit with her till she wakes naturally. It is a pity to deprive\r\nher of one moment's calm sleep. You needn't come, you needn't come. I will\r\nring for you when your mistress wakes;\" and she quietly ascended the\r\nstairs, though the maid offered some civil remonstrances to her undertaking\r\nthe task of watching by her sleeping mistress.\r\n\r\nThe most careful affection could not have prompted greater precautions in\r\nopening the door of the sick lady's chamber, than those which were taken by\r\nMrs. Hazleton. It was a good solid door, however, well seasoned, and well\r\nhung, and moved upon its hinges without noise. She closed it with the same\r\ncare, and then with a soft tread glided up to the side of the bed.\r\n\r\nLady Hastings was sleeping profoundly and quietly; and as she lay in an\r\nattitude of easy grace, a shadow of her youthful beauty seemed to have\r\nreturned, and all the traces of after cares and anxiety were banished for\r\nthe time. On the table, near the bed-head, stood the vial of medicine, with\r\nthe glass and spoon; and Mrs. Hazleton eyed it for a moment or two without\r\ntouching it. She saw that she had hit the color exactly; but the quantity\r\nin that vial, and the one she had with her, was somewhat different. She\r\nfelt puzzled and doubtful. She asked herself--\"Would the difference be\r\ndiscovered when the time came for giving her the medicine?\" and a certain\r\ndegree of trepidation seized her. But she was bold, and said to\r\nherself--\"They will never see it. They suspect nothing. They will never see\r\nit.\" She took the vial from her pocket, and held it for an instant or two\r\nin her hand. Again a doubt and hesitation took possession of her. She gazed\r\nat the sleeper with a haggard eye. The face was so calm, so sweet, so\r\ngentle in expression, that the pleasant look perhaps did move her a little\r\nwith remorse. The voice within said again, and again, \"Forbear!\" She tried\r\nto deafen herself against it, or to fill the ear of conscience with\r\ndelusive sounds. \"She is dying,\" she said--\"She will die--she cannot\r\nrecover. It is but taking away a few short hours, in order to stop that\r\nfatal marriage, which shall never be. I am becoming a fool--a weak\r\nirresolute fool.\"\r\n\r\nJust as she thus thought, Lady Hastings moved uneasily, as if to wake from\r\nher slumber. That moment was decisive. With a hurried hand, and quick as\r\nlight, Mrs. Hazleton changed the two vials, and concealed the one which she\r\nhad taken away.\r\n\r\nThen it was, probably for the first time, that all the awful consequences\r\nof the deed, for time and for eternity, flashed upon her. The scales fell\r\nfrom her eyes: no longer passion, or mortified vanity, or irritated pride,\r\nor disappointed love, distorted the objects or concealed their forms. She\r\nstood there consciously a murderer. She trembled in every limb; and, unable\r\nto support herself, sunk down in the chair that stood near.\r\n\r\nHad Lady Hastings slept on, Mrs. Hazleton would have been saved; for her\r\nimpulse was immediately to reverse the very act she had done--all would\r\nhave been saved--all to whom that act brought wretchedness. But the\r\nmovement of the chair--the sound of the vial touching the marble table--the\r\nrustle of the thick silk--dispelled what remained of slumber, and Lady\r\nHastings opened her eyes drowsily, and looked round. At the very moment she\r\nwould have given worlds to recall it. The deed became irrevocable. The\r\nbarrier of Fate fell: it was amongst the things done; it was written in the\r\nbook of God as a great crime committed. Nothing remained but to insure,\r\nthat the end she aimed at would be obtained; that the evil consequences, in\r\nthis world at least, should be averted from herself. There was a terrible\r\nstruggle to recover her self-command--a wrestling of the spirit--against\r\nthe turbulent and fierce emotions which shook the body. She was still much\r\nagitated when Lady Hastings recognized her and began to speak; but her\r\ndetermination was taken to obtain the utmost that she could from the act\r\nshe had committed--to have the full price of her crime. She was no Judas\r\nIscariot, to be content with the thirty pieces of silver for the innocent\r\nblood, and then hang herself in despair. Oh no! She had sold her own soul,\r\nand she would have its price.\r\n\r\nBut yet, as I have said, the struggle was terrible, and lasted longer than\r\nusual with her.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, my kind friend, is that you?\" said Lady Hastings. \"Have you been\r\nhere long? I did not hear you come in.\"\r\n\r\nHer words, and her tone, were gentle and affectionate. All the coldness and\r\nthe sharpness of the preceding day seemed to have passed away, and to have\r\nbeen forgotten; but words and tone were equally jarring to the feelings of\r\nMrs. Hazleton. The sharpest language, the most angry manner, would have\r\nbeen a relief to her. They would have afforded her some sort of\r\nstrength--some sort of support.\r\n\r\nIt is painful enough to hear sweet music when we are very sad. I have known\r\nit rise almost to agony; but the tones of friendship and regard, of\r\ngentleness and tender kindness, to the ear of hatred and malice, must be\r\nmore terrible still.\r\n\r\n\"I have been here but a moment,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, gloomily--almost\r\npeevishly. \"I suppose it was my coming in woke you; but I am sure I made as\r\nlittle noise as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what is the matter?\" said Lady Hastings. \"You look quite pale and\r\nagitated, and you speak quite crossly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your sudden waking startled me,\" said Mrs. Hazleton; \"and, besides, you\r\nlooked so ill, my dear friend. I almost thought you were dead till you\r\nbegan to move.\"\r\n\r\nThere was malice in the sentence, simple as it seemed, and it had its\r\neffect. Nervous, hypochondriac, Lady Hastings was frightened at the mere\r\nsound, and her heart beat strangely at the very thought of being supposed\r\ndead. It seemed to her to augur that she was very ill; that she was much\r\nworse than her friends allowed her to believe; that they anticipated her\r\nspeedy dissolution, and she remained silent and sad for several minutes,\r\ngiving Mrs. Hazleton time to recover herself completely. She was a little\r\npiqued too at the abruptness of Mrs. Hazleton's manner. Neither the speech,\r\nnor the mode, nor the speaker, pleased her; and she replied at\r\nlength--\"Nevertheless, I feel a good deal better to-day. I have slept well\r\nfor, I dare say, a couple of hours; and my dear child Emily has been with\r\nme all the morning. I must say she bears opposition and contradiction very\r\nsweetly.\"\r\n\r\nShe knew that would not please Mrs. Hazleton, and she laid some emphasis on\r\nthe words by way of retaliation. It was petty, but it was quite in her\r\ncharacter. \"Now I think of it,\" she added, \"you promised to tell me what\r\nyou discovered in regard to Marlow's relationship to Lord Launceston. I\r\nfind--but never mind. Tell me what you have found out.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton hesitated. The first impulse was to tell a lie--to assert\r\nthat Marlow was not the old earl's heir; but there was something in Lady\r\nHastings' manner which made her suspect that she had received more certain\r\ninformation, and she made up her mind to speak the truth.\r\n\r\n\"It is very true,\" she said; \"Mr. Marlow is the old lord's nearest male\r\nrelation, and heir to his title. I suspect,\" she added with a silly\r\nsounding laugh, \"you have found this out yourself, my dear friend, and have\r\nmade your peace with Emily, by withdrawing your opposition to her\r\nmarriage.\"\r\n\r\nHer heart was very bitter at that moment; for she really did suspect all\r\nthat she said. The idea presented itself to her mind (producing a feeling\r\nof fierce disappointment), of all her efforts being rendered fruitless, her\r\ndark schemes frustrated, her cunning contrivances without effect, at the\r\nvery moment when the crime, by which she proposed to insure success, was so\r\nfar consummated as to be beyond recall. She was relieved on that score in a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear no,\" cried Lady Hastings. \"I promised you, my dear friend, that I\r\nwould say nothing till I saw you, and I have said nothing either to my\r\nhusband or Emily. But I will of course now tell her all immediately, and I\r\ndo confess it will give me greater satisfaction than any act of my whole\r\nlife, to withdraw the opposition to her marriage which has made her so\r\nmiserable, and to bid her be happy with the man of her own choice--an\r\nexcellent good young man he is too. He has been laboring, I find, for the\r\nlast fortnight or three weeks, night and day, in our service, and has\r\ndetected the horrible conspiracy by which my husband was deprived of his\r\nrights and property. I shall tell Emily, with great joy, as soon as ever\r\nshe comes back, that were it for nothing but this zeal in our cause, I\r\nwould receive him joyfully as my son-in-law.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better wait till to-morrow morning,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, in a cold\r\nbut significant tone.\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear no,\" said Lady Hastings, somewhat petulantly, \"I have waited quite\r\nlong enough--perhaps too long. You surely would not have me protract my\r\nchild's anxiety and sorrow unnecessarily. No, I will tell her the moment\r\nshe returns. She read me part of a letter from Marlow to-day, which shows\r\nme that he has lost no time in seeking to serve us and make us happy, and I\r\nwill lose no time in making my child and him happy also.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you please,\" replied Mrs. Hazleton; \"I only thought that in this\r\nchangeable world, there are so many unexpected things occurring between one\r\nday and another, it might be well for you to pause and consider a\r\nlittle--in order, I mean, that after-thought may not show you reason to\r\nwithdraw your consent, as you now withdraw your objection.\"\r\n\r\n\"My consent once given, shall never be withdrawn,\" replied Lady Hastings,\r\nin a determined tone.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton looked at the vial by the bedside, and then at her watch.\r\n\"You had better avoid all agitation,\" she said, \"and at all events before\r\nyou speak with Emily, take a dose of the medicine, which Short tells me he\r\nhas given you to soothe and calm your spirits--shall I give you one now?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I thank you,\" replied Lady Hastings, briefly; \"not at present.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not the time?\" said Mrs. Hazleton, looking at her watch again: \"the\r\ngood man told me you were to take it very regularly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he told me,\" replied Lady Hastings, \"that nobody was to give it to me\r\nbut Emily, and she will be back at the right time, I am sure. What o'clock\r\nis it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Past five,\" replied Mrs. Hazleton, advancing the hour a little.\r\n\r\n\"Then it wants three quarters of an hour to the time,\" said Lady Hastings,\r\n\"and Emily has only gone to take a walk. We are expecting Marlow to-night,\r\nso she will not go far I am sure.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton fell into profound thought. In proposing to give Lady\r\nHastings the portion herself, she had deviated a little from her original\r\nplan. She had intended all along, that the mortal draught should be\r\nadministered by the hand of Emily, and she had only been tempted to depart\r\nfrom that purpose by the fear of Lady Hastings withdrawing her opposition\r\nto her daughter's marriage with Marlow before the deed was fully\r\naccomplished. There was no help for it, however. She was obliged to take\r\nher chance of the result; and while she mused at that moment, vague\r\nnotions--what shall I call them?--not exactly schemes or purposes, but\r\nrather dreams of turning suspicion upon Emily herself, of making men\r\nbelieve--suspect, even if they could not prove--that the daughter knowingly\r\ndeprived the mother of life, crossed her imagination. She meditated rather\r\nlonger than was quite decorous, and then suddenly recollecting herself she\r\nsaid, \"By the way, has Emily yet condescended to particularize her\r\nastounding charges against your poor friend? I am really anxious to hear\r\nthem, and although I confess that the matter has afforded me some\r\namusement, it has brought painful feelings and doubts with it too. I have\r\nsometimes fancied, my dear friend, that there is a slight aberration in\r\nyour poor Emily's mind, and I can account for her conduct in this instance\r\nby no other mode. You know her grandfather, Sir John, had moments when he\r\nwas hardly sane. I have heard your own good father declare upon one\r\noccasion, that Sir John was as mad as a lunatic. Tell me then, has Emily\r\nbrought forward any proofs, or alluded to these accusations since I saw\r\nyou? You said she would explain all in a few hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has not as yet explained all,\" replied Lady Hastings, \"but I cannot\r\ndeny that she has alluded to the charges, and repeated them all\r\ndistinctly. She said that the delay had been rather longer than she\r\nexpected; but that as soon as Mr. Dixwell came, every thing should be\r\ntold.\"\r\n\r\n\"The suspense is unpleasant,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, somewhat sarcastically;\r\n\"I trust the young lady does not play with the feelings of her lover as she\r\ndoes with those of her friends, otherwise I should pity Marlow.\"\r\n\r\nLady Hastings was a good deal nettled. \"I do not think he much deserves\r\nyour pity,\" she replied; \"and besides, I think he is quite satisfied with\r\nEmily's conduct, as I am also. I am quite confident she has good reason for\r\nwhat she says, my dear Madam--not that I mean to assert that the charges\r\nare true, by any means--she may be mistaken, you know--she may be\r\nmisinformed--but that she brings them in good faith, and fully believes\r\nthat she can prove them distinctly, I do not for a moment doubt. If she is\r\nwrong, nobody will be more grieved, or more ready to make atonement than\r\nherself; but whether she is right or wrong, remains to be proved.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that I have to request then is,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, \"that you will be\r\nkind enough to let me know, immediately you are yourself informed, what are\r\nthe specific charges, and upon what grounds they rest. That they must be\r\nfalse, I know; and therefore I shall give myself no uneasiness about them.\r\nAll I regret is, that you should be troubled about what must be frivolous\r\nand absurd. Nevertheless, I must beg you to let me hear immediately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Philip will do that,\" replied Lady Hastings, coldly. \"If Emily is\r\nright in her views, the matter will require the intervention of a man. It\r\nwill be too serious for a woman to deal with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, with an air of offended dignity. \"Good\r\nmorning, my dear Lady;\" and she quitted the room.\r\n\r\nShe paused upon the broad staircase for two or three minutes, leaning upon\r\nthe balustrade in deep thought; but when she descended to the hall, she\r\nasked a servant who stood there if Mistress Emily had returned. The man\r\nreplied in the negative, and she then inquired for Sir Philip, asking to\r\nsee him.\r\n\r\nThe servant said he was in his library, and proceeded to announce her. She\r\nfollowed him so closely as to enter the room almost at the same moment, and\r\nbeheld Sir Philip Hastings, with his head leaning on his hand, sitting at\r\nthe table and gazing earnestly down upon it. There was a book before him,\r\nbut it was closed.\r\n\r\n\"I beg pardon for intruding, my dear sir,\" said Mrs. Hazleton, \"but I\r\nwished to ask if you know where Emily is. I want to speak with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing about her,\" said Sir Philip, abruptly; and then muttered to\r\nhimself, \"would I knew more.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I saw her in the fields as I came,\" said Mrs. Hazleton,\r\n\"gathering flowers and herbs--she is fond of botany, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not,\" said Sir Philip, recovering himself a little. \"Pray be\r\nseated. Madam--I have not attended much to her studies lately.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, I must go,\" said Mrs. Hazleton. \"Perhaps I shall meet her as I\r\ndrive along. Do not let me interrupt you, do not let me interrupt you;\" and\r\nshe quietly quitted the room.\r\n\r\n\"Gathering herbs!\" said Sir Philip Hastings, \"what new whim is this?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nEmily Hastings was not three hundred yards from the house when Mrs.\r\nHazleton drove away from the house door. She had never been more than three\r\nhundred yards from it during that day. She had gathered no herbs, she had\r\nwandered through no fields; but, at her mother's earnest request, she had\r\ngone out to breathe the fresh air for half an hour, and had ascended\r\nthrough the gardens to a little terrace on the hill, where she had\r\ncontinued to walk up and down under the shade of some tall trees; had seen\r\nMrs. Hazleton arrive, and saw her depart. The scene which the terrace\r\ncommanded was very beautiful in itself, and the house below, the\r\nwell-cultivated gardens, a fountain here and there, neat hedge-rows, and\r\ntrim, well-ordered fields, gave the whole an air of home comfort, and\r\npeaceful affluence, such as few countries but England can display.\r\n\r\nI have shown, or should have shown, that Emily was somewhat of an\r\nimpressible character, and the brightness and the pleasant character of the\r\nscene had its usual effect in cheering. Certainly, to any one who had stood\r\nnear her, looking over even that fair prospect, she herself would have been\r\nthe loveliest object in it. Every year had brought out some new beauty in\r\nher face, and without diminishing one charm of extreme youth, had expanded\r\nher fair form into womanly richness. The contour of every limb was perfect:\r\nthe whole in symmetry complete; and her movements, as she walked to and\r\nfro, upon the terrace, were all full of that easy, floating grace, which\r\nrequires a combination of youth and health, and fine proportion, and a\r\npure, high mind. If there was a defect it was that she was somewhat pale\r\nthat day; for she had not slept at all during the preceding night from\r\nagitated feelings, and busy thoughts that would not rest. But the slight\r\ndegree of languor, which watching and anxiety had given, was not without\r\nits own peculiar charm, and the liquid brightness of her eyes seemed but\r\nthe more dazzling for the drooping of the eyelid, with its long sweeping\r\nfringe.\r\n\r\nThere was a mixture, too, strange as it may seem to say so, of sadness and\r\ncheerfulness, in the expression of her face that day--perhaps I should say\r\nan alternation of the two expressions; but the change from the one to the\r\nother was too rapid for distinctness; and the well of feelings from which\r\nthe expressions flowed, was of very mingled waters. The scene of death and\r\nsuffering which she had lately witnessed at the cottage, her father's wild\r\nand gloomy manner, her mother's sickness, the displeasure of one parent,\r\nhowever unjust, and the opposition of another, to her dearest wishes,\r\nhowever unreasonable, naturally produced anxiety and sadness. But then\r\nagain, on the other hand, Marlow's letter had cheered and comforted her\r\nmuch; the prospect of seeing him so speedily, rejoiced her more than she\r\nhad even anticipated, and the certainty that a few short hours would remove\r\nfor ever all doubts as to her conduct, her thoughts and her feelings, from\r\nthe mind of both her parents, and especially from that of her father, gave\r\nher strength and happy confidence.\r\n\r\nPoor Emily! How lovely she looked as she walked along there with the ever\r\nvarying expressions fluttering over her face, and her rich nut brown hair,\r\nfree and uncovered, floating in curls on the sportive breath of the breeze.\r\n\r\nWhen first she came out the general tone of her feelings was sad; but the\r\nbright hopes seemed to gain vigor in the open air, and her mind fixed more\r\nand more gladly on the theme of Marlow's letter. As it did so she extracted\r\nfresh motives of comfort from it. He had given her many details in regard\r\nto his late proceedings. He had openly and plainly spoken of the conduct of\r\nMrs. Hazleton, and told her he could prove the facts which he asserted. He\r\nhad not even hinted at an injunction to secrecy, and although her first\r\nimpulse had been to wait for his arrival and let him explain the whole\r\nhimself, yet, as it was now getting late in the day, and he had not\r\ncome--as the obligation to secrecy, laid upon her by John Ayliffe, might\r\nnot be removed till the following morning, and her mother was evidently\r\nanxious and uneasy for want of all explanations--Emily thought she might be\r\nfully justified in reading more of Marlow's letter to Lady Hastings than\r\nshe had hitherto done, and showing her that she had asserted nothing\r\nwithout reasonable cause. The sight of Mrs. Hazleton's carriage arriving\r\nconfirmed her in this intention. She knew that fair lady to possess very\r\ngreat influence over her mother's mind. She believed that influence to have\r\nbeen always exerted balefully, and she judged it better, much better, to\r\ncut it short at once, rather than suffer it to endure even for another day.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw the carriage drive away, then, she returned rapidly to the\r\nhouse, went to her room to get Marlow's letter, and then proceeded to her\r\nmother's chamber.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Hazleton has been here, my love,\" said Lady Hastings, as soon as\r\nEmily approached, \"and really, she has been very strange and disagreeable.\r\nShe seems not to have the slightest consideration for me; but even in my\r\nweak state, says every thing that can agitate and annoy me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust, my dear mother, that you will see her no more,\" said Emily. \"The\r\nfull proofs of what I told you concerning her, I cannot yet give; but\r\nMarlow lays me under no injunction to secrecy, and I have brought his\r\nletter to read you the part in which he speaks of her. That will show you\r\nquite enough to convince you that Mrs. Hazleton should never be permitted\r\nwithin these doors again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh read it, pray read it, my dear,\" said Lady Hastings. \"I am all anxiety\r\nto know the facts; for really one does not know how to behave to this\r\nwoman, and I feel in a very awkward position towards her.\"\r\n\r\nEmily sat down by the bedside and read, word for word, all that Marlow had\r\nwritten in reference to Mrs. Hazleton, which was interspersed, here and\r\nthere, with many kindly and respectful expressions towards Lady Hastings\r\nand her husband, which he knew well would be gratifying to her whom he\r\naddressed. His statements were all clear and precise, and from them Lady\r\nHastings learned he had obtained proof, from various different sources,\r\nthat her seeming friend had knowingly and willingly supplied John Ayliffe\r\nwith the means of carrying on his fraudulent suit against Sir Philip\r\nHastings: that she had been his counsel and cooperator in all his\r\nproceedings, and had suggested many of the most criminal steps he had\r\ntaken. The last passage which Emily read was remarkable: \"To see into the\r\ndark abyss of that woman's heart, my dearest Emily,\" he said, \"is more than\r\nI can pretend to do; but it is perfectly clear that she has been moved in\r\nall her proceedings for some years, by bitter personal hatred towards Sir\r\nPhilip, Lady Hastings, and yourself. Mere self-interest--to which she is by\r\nno means insensible on ordinary occasions--has been sacrificed to the\r\ngratification of malice, and she has even gone so far as to place herself\r\nin a situation of considerable peril for the purpose of ruining your\r\nexcellent father, and making your mother and yourself unhappy. What offence\r\nhas been committed by any of your family to merit such persevering and\r\nruthless hatred, I cannot tell. I only know that it must have been\r\nunintentional; but that it has not been the less bitterly revenged. Perhaps\r\nthe disclosures which must be made as soon as I return, may give us some\r\ninsight into the cause; but at present I can only tell you the result.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Emily,\" said Lady Hastings, \"your father should know this\r\nimmediately. He has been very sad and gloomy since his return. I really\r\ncannot tell what is the matter with him; but something weighs upon his\r\nspirits, evidently; but this news will give him relief, or, at all events,\r\nwill divert his thoughts. It was very natural, my dear girl, that you\r\nshould first tell your mother, but I really think that we must now take\r\nhim into our councils.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go and ask him to come here, at once,\" said Emily. \"I think my dear\r\nfather has not understood me rightly lately, and has chilled me by cold\r\nlooks and words when I would fain have spoken to him, and poured my whole\r\nthoughts into his bosom. Oh, I shall be glad to do any thing to regain his\r\nconfidence; and although I know it must be regained in a very, very short\r\nspace of time, yet I would gladly do any thing to prevent its being\r\nwithheld from me even a moment longer.\"\r\n\r\nShe took a step towards the door as she spoke; but Lady Hastings,\r\nunhappily, called her back. \"Stay, my Emily,\" she said. \"Come hither, my\r\ndear child; I have something to say that will cheer you and comfort you,\r\nand give you strength to meet any little crosses of your father's with\r\npatience and resignation. He has been sorely tried, and is much troubled.\r\nBut I was going to say, dear Emily,\" and she threw her arms round her\r\ndaughter's neck as she leaned over her, \"that I have been thinking much of\r\nall that was said the other day, in regard to your marriage with Marlow. I\r\nsee that your heart is set upon it, and that you can only be happy in a\r\nunion with him. I know him to be a good and excellent young man; and after\r\nall that he has done to serve us, I must not interpose your wishes any\r\nlonger; although, perhaps, I might have chosen differently for you had the\r\nchoice rested with me. I give you, therefore, my full and free consent,\r\nEmily, and trust you will be as happy as you deserve, my dear girl. I think\r\nyou might very well have made a higher alliance, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"But none that would have made me half so happy,\" replied Emily, embracing\r\nher mother. \"Oh, dear mother, if you could know the load you take from my\r\nheart, you would be amply repaid for any sacrifice of opinion you make to\r\nyour child's happiness. I cannot conceive any situation more painful to be\r\nplaced in than a conflict between two duties. My positive promise to\r\nMarlow, my obedience to you, are now reconciled, and I thank you a thousand\r\nthousand times for having thus relieved me from so terrible a struggle.\"\r\n\r\nThe tears rose in her eyes as she spoke, and Lady Hastings made her sit\r\ndown by her bedside, saying--\"Nay, my dear child, do not suffer yourself to\r\nbe so much agitated. I did not know till the other day,\" she said, feeling\r\nsome self-reproach at having been brought to play the part she had acted\r\nlately, \"I did not know till the other day that you were really so much in\r\nlove, my Emily. But I have known what such feelings are, and can sympathize\r\nwith you. Indeed I should have yielded long ago if it had not been for the\r\npersuasions of that horrid Mrs. Hazleton. She always stood in the way of\r\nevery thing I wanted to do, and would not even let me know the truth about\r\nyour real feelings--pretending all the time to be my friend too!\"\r\n\r\n\"She has been a friend to none of us, I fear,\" replied Emily, \"and to me\r\nespecially an enemy; although I cannot at all tell what I ever did to merit\r\nsuch pertinacious hatred as she seems to feel towards me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, my child,\" said Lady Hastings, with a meaning smile, \"I have\r\nbeen sometimes inclined to think that she wished to marry Marlow herself?\"\r\n\r\nEmily started and looked aghast, and then that delicate feeling, that\r\nsensitiveness for the dignity of woman's nature, which none, I suspect, but\r\nwoman's heart can clearly comprehend, caused her cheek to glow like a rose\r\nwith shame at the very thought of a woman loving unloved, and seeking\r\nunsought. She felt, however, at once, that there might be--that there\r\nprobably was--much truth in what her mother said, that she had touched the\r\ntrue point, and had discovered one at least of the causes of Mrs.\r\nHazleton's strange conduct. Nevertheless, she answered, \"Oh, dear mother, I\r\nhope it is not so. Sure I am that Marlow would never trifle with any\r\nwoman's love, and I cannot think that Mrs. Hazleton would so degrade\r\nherself as even to dream of a man who never dreamt of her; besides, she is\r\nold enough to be his mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite, my child, not quite,\" replied Lady Hastings. \"She is, I\r\nbelieve, younger than I am; and though old enough to be your mother, Emily,\r\nI could not have been Marlow's, unless I had married at ten years old.\r\nBesides, she is very beautiful, and she knows it, and may have thought that\r\nsuch beauty as hers, and her great wealth, might well make up for a small\r\ndifference of years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right,\" replied Emily, thoughtfully, as many a\r\ncircumstance flashed upon her memory, which had seemed to her dark and\r\nmysterious in times past; but to which the cause suggested by her mother\r\nseemed now to afford a key. \"But if it was me, only, she hated,\" added\r\nEmily, \"why should she so persecute my father and yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" replied Lady Hastings, speaking with a clear-sighted wisdom\r\nwhich she seldom evinced, \"perhaps because she knew that the most terrible\r\nblows are those which are aimed at us through those we love. Besides, one\r\ncannot tell what offence your father may have given. He is very plain\r\nspoken, and not accustomed to deal very tenderly. Now Mrs. Hazleton is not\r\nwell pleased to hear plain truths, nor to bear with patience any sharpness\r\nor abruptness of manner. Moreover, my child, I have heard that it was old\r\nSir John Hastings' wish, when we were all young and free, that your father\r\nshould marry Mrs. Hazleton. But he preferred another, perhaps less worthy\r\nof him in every respect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no,\" cried Emily, with eager affection. \"More worthy of him a\r\nthousand times in all ways. More good--more kind--more beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, nay, flatterer,\" said Lady Hastings, with a smile. \"I was well enough\r\nto look at once, Emily, and more to his taste. That is enough. My glass\r\ntells me clearly that I cannot compete with Mrs. Hazleton now. But it is\r\ngrowing dark, my dear, I must have lights.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will ring for them, and then go and seek my father,\" replied Emily.\r\n\r\nShe rang, and the maid appeared from the anteroom, just as Lady Hastings\r\nwas saying that it was time to take her medicine. Emily took up the vial\r\nand the spoon, poured out the quantity prescribed, with a steady hand, very\r\nunlike that with which Mrs. Hazleton had held the same bottle an hour\r\nbefore, and having put the dose into a wine-glass, handed it to her mother.\r\n\r\n\"Bring lights,\" said Lady Hastings, addressing her maid; and the moment\r\nafter, she raised the glass to her lips, and drank the contents.\r\n\r\n\"It tastes very odd, Emily,\" she said, \"I think it must be spoiled by the\r\nheat of the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Emily. \"That is very strange. The last vial kept quite well.\r\nBut Mr. Short will be here to-night, and we will make him send some more.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused for a moment or two, and then added, \"Now, shall I go for my\r\nfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Lady Hastings, somewhat faintly; \"wait till the girl comes back\r\nwith the lights.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a few moments, and then raised herself suddenly on her\r\narm, saying in a tone of great alarm, \"Emily, Emily! I feel very ill.--Good\r\nGod, I feel very ill!\"\r\n\r\nEmily sprang to her side and threw her arm round her; but the next instant\r\nLady Hastings uttered a fearful scream, like the cry of a sea-bird, and her\r\nhead fell back upon her daughter's arm.\r\n\r\nEmily rang the bell violently: ran to the door and shrieked loudly for aid;\r\nfor she saw too well that her mother was dying.\r\n\r\nThe maid, several of the other servants, and Sir Philip Hastings himself,\r\nrushed into the room. Lights were brought: Mr. Short was sent for; but ere\r\nthe servant had well passed the gates, Lady Hastings, after a few\r\nconvulsive sobs, had yielded up her spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nWhen the surgeon entered the room of Lady Hastings there was a profound\r\nsilence. Sir Philip Hastings was standing by his wife's bedside, motionless\r\nas a statue; gazing with a knitted brow and fixed stony eye upon the\r\nfeatures of her whom he had so well and constantly loved. Emily lay\r\nfainting upon the floor, with her head supported by one of the maids, while\r\nanother tried to recall her to life. Two more servants were in the room,\r\nbut they, like all the rest, remained silent in presence of the awful scene\r\nbefore them. The windows were not yet closed, and the faint, struggling,\r\ngray twilight came in, and mingled sombrely with the pale light of the wax\r\ncandles, giving even a more deathlike hue to the face of the corpse, and\r\nthrowing strange crossing lights and shades upon features which remained\r\nconvulsed even after the agony of death was past.\r\n\r\n\"Good God! Sir Philip, what is this I hear?\" exclaimed Mr. Short before he\r\ncaught the whole particulars of the scene.\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings made no answer. He did not even seem to hear; and the\r\nsurgeon advanced to the bedside, and gazed for an instant on the face of\r\nLady Hastings. He took her hand in his. It was still warm; but when he put\r\nhis fingers on her wrist, no pulse vibrated beneath his touch. The heart,\r\ntoo, was quite still: not a flutter indicated a lingering spark of\r\nvitality. The breath was gone; and though the surgeon sought on the\r\ndressing-table for a small mirror, and applied it to the lips, it remained\r\nundimmed. He shook his head sadly; but yet he made some efforts. Ho took a\r\nvial of essence from his pocket, and applied it to the nostrils; he opened\r\na vein, and a few drops of blood issued from it, but stopped immediately;\r\nand several other experiments he tried, that not a lingering doubt might\r\nremain of death having taken possession completely.\r\n\r\nAt length he ceased, saying, \"It is in vain. How did this happen? It is\r\nvery strange. There was not an indication of such an event yesterday. She\r\nwas decidedly better.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so she was this morning, sir,\" said Lady Hastings' maid; \"she slept\r\nquite well too, sir, before Mrs. Hazleton came.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings remained profoundly silent; but Mr. Short gave a sudden\r\nstart at the name of Mrs. Hazleton, and asked the maid when that lady had\r\nleft her mistress.\r\n\r\n\"Not half an hour before her death, sir,\" replied the maid; \"and even for a\r\nlittle time after she was gone, my lady seemed quite well and cheerful with\r\nMistress Emily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you with her when she was seized so suddenly?\" asked the surgeon.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said the maid. \"No one was with her but Mistress Emily. My lady\r\nhad sent me away for lights; but just when I was coming up the stairs, I\r\nheard my young lady ringing the bell violently, and screaming for help, and\r\nin two minutes after I came in my lady was dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must hear the first symptoms,\" said Mr. Short, \"and this dear young lady\r\nneeds attending to. If I know her right, this shock will well nigh kill\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nHe moved towards Emily as he spoke, but in passing across, his eye lighted\r\nupon the vial which was standing upon the table at the bedside, with the\r\nspoon and wine-glass which had been used in administering the medicine.\r\nSomething in the appearance of the bottle seemed to strike him suddenly,\r\nand he raised it sharply and held it to the candle. \"Good God!\" exclaimed\r\nMr. Short; \"Good God!\" and his face turned as pale as death, and a fit of\r\ntrembling seized upon him.\r\n\r\nIt was several moments before he uttered another word. He put his hand to\r\nhis brow, and seemed to think deeply and anxiously. Then he examined the\r\nbottle again, took out the cork, held it to his nostrils, tasted a single\r\ndrop poured upon the end of his finger, and shook his head sadly and\r\nsolemnly. Every eye but those of the maid, who was supporting Emily's head,\r\nwas now turned upon him. There was something in his manner so unusual, so\r\nstrange, that even the attention of Sir Philip Hastings was attracted by\r\nit; and he looked gloomily at the surgeon for a moment, as if in a dreamy\r\nwonder at his proceedings.\r\n\r\nAt length, Mr. Short spoke again. \"Can any body tell me,\" he said, \"when\r\nLady Hastings took a dose of this stuff?\"\r\n\r\nNo one remarked the irreverent term which he applied to the contents of the\r\nvial; for every one who listened to him would probably have given it the\r\nsame name, had it been a mithridate; but the maid of the deceased lady\r\nreplied at once, \"Only a few minutes before she died, sir. I saw her take\r\nit myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who gave it to her?\" demanded the surgeon, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"My young lady, sir,\" answered the maid, \"just before I went for the\r\nlights, and I am sure she did not give her a drop too much of it; for she\r\nmeasured it out carefully in the spoon before she put it into the glass.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Short remained silent again, and Sir Philip Hastings spoke for the\r\nfirst time with a great effort.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, sir?\" he asked, gloomily; \"you seem confounded,\r\nthunder-struck. What has befallen to draw your eyes from that?\" and he\r\npointed to the bed of his dead wife.\r\n\r\n\"I am bound to say, Sir Philip,\" replied Mr. Short, \"that it is my belief\r\nthat the dose given to Lady Hastings from that bottle, has been the cause\r\nof her death. In a word, I believe it to be poison.\"\r\n\r\nSir Philip Hastings gazed in his face with a wild look of horror. His teeth\r\nchattered in his head, his whole frame shook visibly to the eyes of those\r\naround, but he uttered not a word, and it was the maid who answered,\r\nexclaiming in a shrill voice, \"Oh, how horrible! How could you send my lady\r\nsuch stuff?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never sent it to her, woman!\" said Mr. Short, sternly; \"if you had eyes\r\nyou would see that it is not of the same color, nor has it the same taste\r\nof that which I sent. It is different in every respect; and if no other\r\nproof were wanting that which I sent Lady Hastings was harmless, it would\r\nbe sufficient to say, that the last vial I brought was delivered to you\r\nyourself yesterday quite full, that Lady Hastings ought to have taken four\r\nor five doses of that medicine between that time and this, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" exclaimed the maid, interrupting him, \"she took it quite\r\nregularly. I saw Mistress Emily give her three doses myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, did those hurt her?\" asked Mr. Short, sharply.\r\n\r\n\"I can't say they did,\" replied the woman, \"indeed she always seemed better\r\na little while after taking them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well that shows that this is not the same,\" said Mr. Short; \"besides, this\r\nbottle has never come out of my surgery. I always choose mine perfectly\r\nclear and white, that I may be enabled to see if the medicine is at all\r\ntroubled or not. This has a green tinge, and must have come from some\r\ncommon druggist's, and the stuff that it contains must be strictly\r\nanalyzed.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Sir Philip Hastings strode up to him, grasped his hand, and\r\nwrung it hard, saying in a hollow husky tone, and pointing to the bottle,\r\n\"What is it you mean? What is it all about? What is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poison! Sir Philip,\" replied Mr. Short, moved by the feelings of the\r\nmoment beyond all his ordinary prudence; \"poison! and I very much fear that\r\nit has been administered to your poor lady intentionally.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gathering herbs!--gathering herbs!\" screamed Sir Philip Hastings, like a\r\nmadman; and tearing the hair out of his head, he rushed away from the room,\r\nand locked himself into his library.\r\n\r\nNo one could tell to what his words alluded, nor did they trouble\r\nthemselves much to discover; for every one at once concluded that the shock\r\nof his wife's sudden death, and the discovery of its terrible cause, had\r\ndriven him insane.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do run after my master, sir,\" cried the maid; \"he has gone into the\r\nlibrary, I heard him bang the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he got any arms there?\" asked Mr. Short, \"there used to be pistols at\r\nthe Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, no,\" exclaimed one of the house-maids, \"they are not there. They\r\nare in his dressing-room out yonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I will leave him alone for the present,\" said the surgeon;\r\n\"here is one who demands more immediate care. Poor young lady! If she\r\nshould discover, in her present state of grief, how her mother has died,\r\nand that her hand has been employed to produce such a catastrophe, it will\r\ndestroy either her life or her intellect.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who could have done it, sir?\" exclaimed Lady Hastings' maid.\r\n\r\n\"Never you mind that for the present,\" said Mr. Short; \"I have my\r\nsuspicions; but they are no more than suspicions at present. You stay with\r\nme here, and let the other woman carry your poor young lady to her room. I\r\nwill be with her presently, and will give her what will do her good. One\r\nof you, as soon as possible, send me up a man-servant--a groom would be\r\nbest.\"\r\n\r\nHis orders were obeyed promptly; for he spoke with a tone of decision and\r\ncommand which the terrible circumstances of the moment enabled him to\r\nassume; although in ordinary circumstances he was a man of mild and gentle\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as poor Emily was borne away to her own chamber, Mr. Short turned\r\nto the maid again, inquiring, \"How long had Mistress Hazleton gone when\r\nyour mistress was seized with these fatal convulsions?\"\r\n\r\n\"About half an hour, sir,\" said the maid. \"It couldn't have been longer.\r\nMrs. Hazleton came when my lady was asleep, and went in alone, saying she\r\nwould not disturb her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" cried the surgeon; \"was she with her for any time alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"All the time that she staid, sir,\" replied the maid; \"for I did not like\r\nto go in, and Mistress Emily was walking on the terrace up the hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose then you cannot tell how long Mrs. Hazleton remained alone with\r\nyour lady before she woke?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I can pretty nearly, sir,\" answered the maid, \"for though Mrs.\r\nHazleton told me not to come in with her, and said she would ring when my\r\nlady waked, I came after her into the anteroom, and sat there all the time.\r\nFor about five minutes, or it might be ten, all was quiet enough; but at\r\nthe end of that time I heard my lady and Mrs. Hazleton begin to speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"You heard no other sounds previously?\" asked the surgeon.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but the rustle of Mrs. Hazleton's gown, as she moved about once or\r\ntwice,\" said the maid, \"and of that I can't be rightly sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not by chance look through the key-hole?\" asked Mr. Short.\r\n\r\n\"No, that I didn't,\" said the maid, tossing her head, \"I never did such a\r\nthing in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well. Get me a sheet of paper,\" replied the surgeon, \"and a pen and\r\nink--oh, they are here are they?\" But before he could sit down to write, a\r\ngroom crept in through the half-open door, and received orders from the\r\nsurgeon to saddle a horse instantly and return. Mr. Short then sat down and\r\nwrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\"MR. ATKINSON:--As you are high constable of Hartwell, I write as a justice\r\nof the peace for the county of ----, to authorize and require you to follow\r\nimmediately the carriage of The Honorable Mistress Hazleton, to apprehend\r\nthat lady and to keep her in your safe custody, taking care that her person\r\nbe immediately searched by some proper person, and that any vials, bottles,\r\npowders, or other objects whatsoever bearing the appearance of drugs or\r\nmedicines, or of having contained them, be carefully preserved, and marked\r\nfor identification. I have not time or means to fill up a regular warrant;\r\nbut I will justify you in, and be responsible for, whatever you may do to\r\ninsure that Mrs. Hazleton has no means or opportunity allowed her of\r\nconcealing or making away with any thing she has carried away from this\r\nhouse, where Lady Hastings has just deceased from the effects of poison.\r\nYou had better take the fresh horse of the bearer, and lose not an instant\r\nin overtaking the carriage.\"\r\n\r\nHe then signed his name just as the groom returned; but ere he gave the man\r\nthe paper he added in a postscript:\r\n\r\n\"You had better search the carriage minutely, and make any preliminary\r\ninvestigation that you may think fit before I arrive. The hints given above\r\nwill be sufficient for your guidance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take this paper immediately to Jenny Best's cottage,\" said Mr. Short to\r\nthe groom. \"Ask if Mr. Atkinson is there. Should he be so, give it to him,\r\nand let him take your horse if he requires it. Should you not find him\r\nthere, seek for him either at the house of Mr. Dixwell, or at the farm\r\nclose by. Should he be at neither of those places, follow him on to his\r\nhouse near Hartwell at full speed. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, quite well, sir,\" said the groom, who was a shrewd, keen fellow; and\r\nhe left the room without more words.\r\n\r\nWhen he got down to the hall door, however, he thought he might as well\r\nknow more of his errand, and read the paper which he had received with the\r\nbutler and the footman. A brief consultation followed between them, and not\r\na little horror and anger was excited by the information they had gained\r\nfrom the paper, for Lady Hastings had been well loved by her servants, and\r\nMrs. Hazleton was but little loved by any of her inferiors in station.\r\n\r\n\"Go you on, John, as fast as possible,\" said the footman. \"I'll get a horse\r\nand come after you as fast as possible with Harry; for this grand dame has\r\nthree servants with her, and mayn't choose to be taken easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, come along, come along,\" said the groom; \"we'll run her down, I'll\r\nwarrant,\" and hurrying away he got to his horse's back.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Mr. Short had proceeded to the room of poor Emily\r\nHastings, whom he found recovering from her fainting fit, and sobbing in\r\nthe bitterness of grief.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Short,\" she said, \"this is very terrible. There surely was\r\nsomething wrong about that medicine, for my poor mother was taken ill the\r\nmoment she had swallowed it. She had had the same quantity three times\r\nto-day before; but she said that it tasted strange and unpleasant. It could\r\nnot surely have been spoiled by keeping so short a time, and that could not\r\nhave killed her even if it had been so. Pray do examine it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, I will, my dear,\" replied Mr. Short kindly, \"but I don't think\r\nthe medicine I sent could spoil, and if it did it could have no evil\r\neffect. Now quiet yourself, my dear Mistress Emily; I am going to give you\r\na draught which will soothe your nerves, and fit you better to bear all\r\nthese terrible things.\"\r\n\r\nHe then had recourse to the little store of medicines he usually carried in\r\nhis pocket, and administered first a stimulant and then a somewhat powerful\r\nnarcotic. For about ten minutes he remained seated by Emily's bedside with\r\nher own maid standing at the foot, and during that time the poor girl spoke\r\nonce or twice, asking anxiously after her father, and expressing a great\r\ndesire to go to him. Gradually, however, her eyelids began to droop, her\r\nsentences remained unfinished, and, in the end, she fell into a deep and\r\nprofound sleep.\r\n\r\n\"She will not wake for six or eight hours,\" said Mr. Short, addressing the\r\nmaid. \"But when she does wake it would be better you should be with her, my\r\ngood girl. If you like, therefore, you can go and take some rest in the\r\nmeanwhile; but order yourself to be called at the end of five hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are quite sure that she will remain asleep, sir,\" said the maid, \"I\r\nwill lie down, for I am sure sorrow wearies one more than work.\"\r\n\r\n\"She won't wake,\" said Mr. Short, \"for six hours at least. I will now go\r\nand see Sir Philip,\" and descending the stairs, he knocked at the door of\r\nthe library, thinking that probably he should find it locked. The stern\r\nvoice of Sir Philip Hastings, however, said \"Come in,\" in a wonderfully\r\ncalm tone; and when the surgeon entered he found Sir Philip seated at the\r\nlibrary table, and apparently reading a Greek book, the contents of which\r\nMr. Short could not at all divine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nI must now follow the groom on his road, first to the cottage of good Jenny\r\nBest, where he learned that Mr. Atkinson had gone away some five minutes\r\nbefore, and then to the house of the neighboring farm, where he found the\r\nperson he sought still seated on his horse, but talking to the tenant at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Mr. Atkinson,\" cried the groom as he came up; \"here's a note for you\r\nfrom Mr. Short the surgeon--a sort of warrant, I believe; for he's a\r\njustice of the peace, you know, as well as a surgeon. Read it quick, Mr.\r\nAtkinson, read it quick; for it won't keep hot long; and if that woman\r\nisn't caught I think I'll hang myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring us a light, farmer,\" said Mr. Atkinson, \"quickly. What is all this\r\nabout, John?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Madam Hazleton has poisoned my lady, and she's as dead as a door\r\nnail,\" said the groom, \"that's all; and bad enough too. Zounds, I thought\r\nshe'd do some mischief; she was always so hard upon her horses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heaven!\" exclaimed Mr. Atkinson, \"you do not mean to say that she has\r\ncertainly poisoned Lady Hastings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Short believes it, and every one believes it,\" answered the\r\ngroom.\r\n\r\nMr. Atkinson might have endeavored to reduce the number comprised in the\r\nterm \"every body\" to its just proportions; but before he could do so, the\r\nfarmer returned with a light shaded from the wind by his hat; and the good\r\nhigh constable of Hartwell, bending over his saddle, read hurriedly Mr.\r\nShort's brief note.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter? what's the matter?\" cried the farmer; and great was his\r\nsurprise and consternation to hear that Lady Hastings was dead, and that\r\nstrong suspicion existed of her having been poisoned by Mrs. Hazleton.\r\nThere is a stern, dogged love of justice, however, in the English peasant,\r\nwhich rises into energy and excitement; and the farmer was instantly heard\r\ncalling for his horse.\r\n\r\n\"Zounds, I'll ride with you, Atkinson,\" he said. \"This great dame has got\r\nso many servants, she may think fit to set the law at defiance; but she\r\nmust be taught that high people cannot poison other people any more than\r\nlow ones. But you go on; you go on. I'll catch you up, perhaps. If not,\r\nI'll come in time, don't you be afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going along too,\" said the groom, \"and two others are coming; so if\r\nher tall men show fight, I think we'll leather their jackets.\"\r\n\r\nAway they went as fast as they could go, and to say truth, Mr. Atkinson was\r\nnot at all sorry to have some assistance; for without ever committing any\r\none act which could be characterized as criminal, unjust, or wrong, within\r\nthe knowledge of her neighbors, Mrs. Hazleton had somehow impressed the\r\nminds of all who surrounded her with the conviction, that hers was a most\r\ndaring and remorseless nature. The general world received their impression\r\nof her character--and often a false one, be it good or evil--by her greater\r\nand more important actions: the little circle that surrounds us forms a\r\nslower but more certain judgment from minute but often repeated traits.\r\n\r\nOn rode Mr. Atkinson and the groom, as fast as their horses could carry\r\nthem. Wherever there was turf by the roadside they galloped; and at the\r\nrate of progression made by carriages in that day, they made sure they must\r\nbe gaining very rapidly upon the object of their pursuit. When first they\r\nset out it was very dark; but at the end of twenty minutes, in which period\r\nthey had ridden somewhat more than four miles, the edge of the moon began\r\nto appear above the horizon, and her light showed them well nigh another\r\nmile on the road before them. Still no carriage was in sight, and the groom\r\nexclaimed, \"Dang it, Mr. Atkinson, we must spur on, or she will get home\r\nbefore we catch her.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to run after any thing without feeling some of the\r\neagerness of the fox-hound, and it is not to be denied that Mr. Atkinson\r\nshared in some degree in the impetuous spirit of the chase with the groom.\r\nHe said nothing about it, indeed; but he made his spurs mark his horse's\r\nsides, and on they went up the opposite slope at a quicker pace than ever.\r\nFrom the top was a very considerable descent into the bottom of the valley,\r\nin which Hartwell is situated; but the moon had not yet risen high enough\r\nto illuminate more than half the scene, and darkness, doubly dark, seemed\r\nto have gathered over the low grounds beneath the eyes of the two horsemen.\r\n\r\nMr. Atkinson thought he perceived some large object below, moving on\r\ntowards Hartwell; but he could not be sure of it till he had descended some\r\nway down the hill, when the carriage of Mrs. Hazleton, mounting a little\r\nrise into the moonlight, became plainly visible to the eye. The groom took\r\noff his cap and waved it, saying, \"Tally ho!\" but neither he nor his\r\ncompanion paused in their rapid course, but went thundering down at the\r\nrisk of their necks, and of their horses' knees. The carriage moved slowly;\r\nthe pursuers went very fast: and at the end of about four minutes they had\r\nreached and passed the two mounted men-servants, who, as customary in those\r\ndays, rode behind the vehicle. Robberies on the highway were by no means\r\nuncommon; so that it was the custom for the attendants upon a carriage to\r\ntravel armed, and Mrs. Hazleton's two men instantly laid their hands upon\r\nthe holsters of their pistols, when those too rapid riders passed them at\r\nsuch a furious pace. Mr. Atkinson, however, was not a man to be easily\r\nfrightened from anything he undertook, and wheeling his horse sharply when\r\nin a little advance of the coachman, he exclaimed, \"In the King's name I\r\ncommand you to stop. I am James Atkinson, high constable of Hartwell. You\r\nknow me, sir; and I command you in the King's name to stop!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Master Atkinson, what is all this about?\" cried the coachman. \"There\r\nis nobody but Mrs. Hazleton here. Don't you know the carriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite well,\" replied Mr. Atkinson; \"but you hear what I say, and will\r\ndisobey at your peril. John, ride round to the other side, while I speak to\r\nthe lady here.\"\r\n\r\nNow Mrs. Hazleton had heard the whole of this conversation, and had there\r\nbeen sufficient light, Mr. Atkinson, whose eye was turned towards where she\r\nsat, would have seen her turn deadly pale. It might naturally be supposed\r\nthat in any ordinary circumstances she would have directed her first\r\nattention to the side from which the sounds proceeded; but so far from that\r\nbeing the case, she instantly put her hand in her pocket, and was almost in\r\nthe act of throwing something into the road, when John the groom presented\r\nhimself at the window, and she stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Mr. Atkinson?\" she exclaimed, turning to the other window, and\r\nspeaking in a tone of high indignation. \"Why do you presume to stop my\r\ncarriage on the King's highway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I am ordered, Madam, by lawful authority, so to do,\" replied Mr.\r\nAtkinson. \"I am sorry, Madam, to tell you that you must consider yourself\r\nas a prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton would fain have asked upon what charge; but she did not dare,\r\nand for a moment strength and courage failed her. It was but for a moment,\r\nhowever, and in the next she exclaimed in a loud and more imperious tone\r\nthan ever, \"This is a pretence for robbery or insult. Drive on, coachman.\r\nMathew--Rogerson--clear the way!\"\r\n\r\nShe reckoned wrongly, however, if she counted upon any great zeal in her\r\nservants. The two men hesitated; for the King's name was a tower of\r\nstrength which they did not at all like to assail. Their mistress repeated\r\nher order in an angry tone, and one of them, with habitual deference to her\r\ncommands, went so far as to cock the pistol which he now held in his hand;\r\nbut at that moment the adverse party received an accession of strength\r\nwhich rendered all assistance hopeless. The other two servants of Sir\r\nPhilip Hastings came down the hill at full speed, and a gentleman, followed\r\nby a servant, rode up from the side of Hartwell, and addressed Mr. Atkinson\r\nby his name.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Marlow!\" said Mr. Atkinson. \"You come at a very melancholy moment,\r\nsir, and to witness a very unpleasant scene; but, nevertheless, I must\r\nrequire your assistance, sir, as this lady seems inclined to resist the\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Marlow. \"I hope there is no mistake here. If I\r\nsee rightly this is Mrs. Hazleton's carriage. What is she charged with?\"\r\n\r\n\"Murder, sir,\" replied Mr. Atkinson, who had been a little irritated by the\r\nlady's resistance, and spoke more plainly than he might otherwise have\r\ndone. \"The murder of Lady Hastings by poison.\"\r\n\r\nIt was spoken. She heard the words clearly and distinctly. She had been\r\ndetected. Some small oversight--some accidental circumstance--some\r\nprecaution forgotten--some accidental word, or gesture, had betrayed the\r\ndark secret, revealed the terrible crime. It was all known to men, as well\r\nas to God, and Mrs. Hazleton sunk back in the carriage overpowered by the\r\nagony of detection.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ho; here come the other men,\" said Mr. Atkinson, as the two servants\r\nof Sir Philip Hastings rode up. \"Now, coachman, drive on till I tell you to\r\nstop. You, John, keep close to the other window, and watch it well. I will\r\ntake care of this one. The others come behind. Mr. Marlow, you had perhaps\r\nbetter ride with us for half a mile or so; for I must stop at the house of\r\nWidow Warmington, as I have orders to make a strict search.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, take me to my own house--take me to my own house,\" said Mrs. Hazleton,\r\nin a faint tone.\r\n\r\n\"I dare not venture to do that, Madam,\" said Mr. Atkinson; \"for we are\r\nnearly three miles distant, and accidents might happen by the way which\r\nwould defeat the ends of justice. I must have a full search made at the\r\nvery first place where I can procure lights. That will be at Mrs.\r\nWarmington's; but she is a friend of your own, Madam, and you will be\r\nreceived there with all kindness.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton did not reply; and the carriage drove on, Mr. Atkinson\r\nkeeping a keen watch upon one window, and the groom riding close to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nA few minutes brought them to the house of the shrewd widow, and the bell\r\nwas rung sharply by one of the servants. A woman servant appeared in answer\r\nto the summons, and without asking whether her mistress was at home, or\r\nnot, Atkinson took the candle from her hand, saying, \"Lend me the light for\r\na moment. I wish to light Mrs. Hazleton into the house. Now, Madam, will\r\nyou please to descend.--John, dismount, and come round here; assist Mrs.\r\nHazleton to alight, and come with us on her other side.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton saw that she could not double or turn there. She withdrew her\r\nhand from her pocket where she had hitherto held it, resumed her forgotten\r\nair of dignity, and though, to say the truth, she would rather have met her\r\n\"dearest foe in heaven,\" than have entered that house so escorted, she\r\nwalked with a firm step and dauntless eye, with the high constable on one\r\nside, and the groom on the other.\r\n\r\n\"They shall not see me quail,\" she said to herself. \"They shall not see me\r\nquail. I know the worst, and I can meet it--I have had my revenge.\"\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the maid had run in haste to tell her mistress the\r\nmarvels of the scene she had just witnessed, and Mrs. Warmington had\r\ngathered enough, without divining the whole, to rejoice her with\r\nanticipated triumph. The arrest of Shanks the attorney on a charge of\r\nconspiracy and forgery, had set going the hundred tongues of Rumor, few of\r\nwhich had spared the name of Mrs. Hazleton; and Mrs. Warmington, at the\r\nworst, suspected that her dear friend was implicated in the guilt of the\r\nattorney. That, however, was sufficient to give the widow considerable\r\nsatisfaction, for she had not forgotten either some coldness and neglect\r\nwith which Mrs. Hazleton had treated her for some time, or her impatient\r\nand insolent conduct that morning; and though upon the strength of her\r\nplumpness, and easy manners, people looked upon Mrs. Warmington as a very\r\ngood natured person, yet fat people can be very vindictive sometimes.\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious me, my dear, what is the matter?\" exclaimed Mrs. Warmington,\r\nas the prisoner was brought in, while Mr. Atkinson, speaking to those\r\nbehind, exclaimed, \"Let no one touch or approach the carriage till I\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton made no answer to her dear friend's questions, and the high\r\nconstable, taking a little step forward, said, \"I beg pardon, Mrs.\r\nWarmington, for intruding into your house; but I have been ordered to\r\napprehend this lady, and to have her person and her carriage strictly\r\nsearched, without giving the opportunity for the concealment or destruction\r\nof any thing. It seems to me that Mrs. Hazleton has something bulky in that\r\nleft hand pocket. As I do not like to put my hand rudely upon a lady, may I\r\nask you, Madam, to let me see what that pocket contains?\"\r\n\r\nWithout the slightest hesitation, but with a good deal of curiosity, Mrs.\r\nWarmington advanced at once and took hold of the rich silk brocade of the\r\nprisoner's gown.\r\n\r\n\"Out, woman!\" cried Mrs. Hazleton, with the fire flashing from her eyes;\r\nand she struck her.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Warmington did not quit her hold or her purpose. \"Good gracious,\r\nwhat a termagant!\" she exclaimed, and at once thrust her right hand into\r\nthe pocket, and drew forth the vial which had been sent by the surgeon to\r\nLady Hastings.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed Mrs. Warmington. \"Why, this is the very bottle I saw\r\nyou mixing stuff in this morning, when you seemed so angry and vexed at my\r\ncoming into the still-room.--No, it isn't the same either; but it was one\r\nvery like this, only darker in the color.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" said Mr. Atkinson. \"Madam, will you have the goodness to put a mark\r\nupon that bottle by which you can know it again?--Scratch it with a diamond\r\nor something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, poor I have no diamonds,\" said Mrs. Warmington. \"My dear, will you\r\nlend me that ring?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hazleton gave her a withering glance, but made no reply; and Marlow\r\npointed to two peculiar spots in the glass of the bottle, saying, \"By those\r\nmarks it will be known, so that it cannot be mistaken.\" His words were\r\naddressed to Mr. Atkinson; for he felt disgusted and sickened by the\r\nheartless and insulting tone of Mrs. Warmington towards her former friend.\r\n\r\nAt the sound of his voice--for she had not yet looked at him--Mrs. Hazleton\r\nstarted and looked round. It is not possible to tell the feelings which\r\naffected her heart at that moment, or to picture with the pen the varied\r\nexpressions, all terrible, which swept over her beautiful countenance like\r\na storm. She remembered how she had loved him. Perhaps at that moment she\r\nknew for the first time how much she had loved him. She felt too, how\r\nstrongly love and hate had been mingled together by the fiery alchemy of\r\ndisappointment, as veins of incongruous metals have been mixed by the great\r\nconvulsions of the early earth. She felt too, at that moment, that it was\r\nthis love and this hate which had been the cause of her deepest crimes, and\r\nall their consequences--the awful situation in which she there stood, the\r\nlingering tortures of imprisonment, the agonies of trial, and the bitter\r\nconsummation of the scaffold.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Marlow, Marlow,\" she cried--in a tone for the first time\r\nsorrowful--\"to see you mingling in these acts!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to do with the present business, Mrs. Hazleton,\" replied\r\nMarlow, \"but I am bound to say that in consequence of information I have\r\nprocured, it would have been my duty to have caused your apprehension upon\r\nother charges, had not this, of which I know nothing, been preferred\r\nagainst you. All is discovered, madam; all is known. With a slight clue, at\r\nfirst, I have pursued the intricate labyrinth of your conduct for the last\r\ntwo years to its conclusion, and every thing has been made plain as day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You, Marlow, you?\" cried Mrs. Hazleton, fixing her eyes steadfastly upon\r\nhim, and then adding, as he bowed his head in token of assent, \"but all is\r\nnot known, even to you. You shall know all, however, before I die; and\r\nperhaps to know all may wring your heart, hard though it be. But what am I\r\ntalking of?\" she continued, her face becoming suddenly suffused with\r\ncrimson, and her fine features convulsed with rage. \"All is discovered, is\r\nit? And you have done it? What matters it to me, then, whose heart is\r\nwrung--or what becomes of you, or me, or any one? A drop more or less is\r\nnothing in the overflowing well. Why should I struggle longer? Why should I\r\nhide any thing? Why should I fly from this charge to meet another? I did\r\nit--I poisoned her--I put the drug by her bedside. It is all true--I did it\r\nall--I have had my revenge as far as it could be obtained, and now do with\r\nme what you like. But remember, Marlow, remember, if Emily Hastings marries\r\nyou, she does it with a mother's curse upon her head--a curse that will\r\nfall upon her heart like a milldew, and wither it for ever--a curse that\r\nwill dry up the source of all fond affections, blacken the brightest hours,\r\nand embitter the purest joys--a dying mother's curse! She knows it--she has\r\nheard it--it can never be recalled. I have put that beyond fate. Ha ha! It\r\nis upon you both; and if you venture to unite your unhappy destinies, may\r\nthat curse cling to you and blast you for ever.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke with all the vehemence of intense passion, breaking, for the\r\nfirst time in life, through strong habitual self-control; and when she had\r\ndone, she cast herself into a chair, and covered her eyes with her hands.\r\n\r\nShe wept not; but her whole frame heaved and shivered, with the terrible\r\nemotion that tore her heart.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Marlow and Mrs. Warmington and the high constable spoke\r\nupon it, consulting what was to be done with her. The prison system of\r\nEngland was at that time as bad as it could be, and those who condemned and\r\nabhorred her the most, were anxious to spare her as long as possible the\r\nhorrors of the jail. At length, after many difficulties, and a good deal of\r\nhesitation, Mr. Atkinson agreed, at the suggestion of Mrs. Warmington, to\r\nleave her in the house where she then was, under the charge of a constable\r\nto be sent for from Hartwell. There was a high upper room from which there\r\nwas no possibility of escape, with an antechamber in which the constable\r\ncould watch, and there he was determined to confine her till she could be\r\nbrought before the magistrate on the following day.\r\n\r\n\"I must have her thoroughly searched in the first place,\" said Mr.\r\nAtkinson; \"for she may have some more of the poison about her, and in her\r\npresent state, after all she has confessed, she is just as likely to\r\nswallow it as not. However, Mr. Marlow, you had better, I think, ride on as\r\nfast as possible to see Sir Philip Hastings, and tell him what has occurred\r\nhere. If I judge rightly, your presence will be very needful there.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will indeed,\" said Marlow, a sudden vague apprehension of he knew not\r\nwhat, seizing upon him; \"God grant I have not tarried too long already;\"\r\nand quitting the room, he sprang upon his horse's back again.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Continued from page 327.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO SONNETS.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRUTH.\r\n\r\n    For constant truth my aching spirit yearns,\r\n    And finds no comfort in a glorious cheat;\r\n    On the firm rock I wish to set my feet,\r\n    And look upon the star that changeless burns;\r\n    Yon gorgeous clouds that in the sunset glow,\r\n    With fire-wrought domes for angel-palace meet,\r\n    Beneath my gaze their surface beauties fleet;\r\n    With parting light how dull their splendors grow.\r\n    I cannot worship vapors, and the hue\r\n    That on the dove's neck flickers, as it veers,\r\n    Bewilders, but not charms me; whilst the blue\r\n    Of the clear sky gives comfort 'mid all fears,\r\n    And but to think on that unshadowed white,\r\n    The angels walk in, makes my dark path bright.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n    Eternal sunshine withers; constant light\r\n    Would make the beauty of the world look wan;\r\n    The storm that sleeps with dark'ning terror on,\r\n    Leaves verdant freshness where it seemed to blight;\r\n    Most dreary is the land where comes no night,\r\n    For there the sun is chill, and slowly drawn\r\n    Round the horizon, spreads a sickly dawn,\r\n    No promise of a day more warm and bright.\r\n    Bless then the clouds and darkness, for we can\r\n    Discern with awe through them what angel faces\r\n    Watch and direct, and from their holy places\r\n    Smile with sublime benignity on man;\r\n    And dearly cherish sickness, pain, and sorrow,\r\n    As gloomy heralds of a bright to-morrow.\r\n\r\n                              V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT MONTE-LEONE: OR, THE SPY IN SOCIETY.[3]\r\n\r\nTRANSLATED FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE FROM THE FRENCH OF H. DE.\r\nST. GEORGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--THE GARRET.\r\n\r\nHalf demented, Monte-Leone left the Duke's Hotel. His existence had become\r\na terrible dream, a hideous nightmare, every hour producing a new terror\r\nand surprise. D'Harcourt was gone. He went to find Von Apsberg. \"He at\r\nleast will speak. He will say something about this atrocious accusation. He\r\nwill explain the meaning of the perfidious reply of the chief of police. If\r\nhe repeated this atrocious calumny, if he persisted in thinking him guilty,\r\nhis heart would be open to Monte-Leone's blows. He would at least crush and\r\nbury one of his enemies.\"\r\n\r\nA new misfortune awaited him. The doctor was not to be found. The police\r\nhad occupied the house at the time that the Vicomte was being arrested. The\r\ndoctor had beyond a doubt been previously informed of their coming and\r\nescaped, but his papers were seized. All the archives and documents of\r\nCarbonarism fell into the hands of M. H----. One might have said some evil\r\ngenius guided the police and led them in their various examinations into\r\nthe invisible mines of their prey. Furniture, drawers, and all were\r\nexamined. Count Monte-Leone, when he heard of the disappearance of the\r\nDoctor and of the seizure of his papers, felt an increase of rage. The\r\ndiscovery of the archives ruined for a long time, if not for ever, the\r\nprospects of the work to which Monte-Leone had consecrated his life. The\r\nflight of Matheus also deprived him of any means of extricating himself\r\nfrom the cloud of mystery which surrounded him, and made futile any hope of\r\nvengeance. Taddeo alone remained, and he was protected by the oath he had\r\ntaken to the Marquise. One other deception yet awaited him. A devoted\r\nmember of the Carbonari, on the next day, came to Monte-Leone's house and\r\ninformed the Count that on the day after the Vicomte's arrest and the\r\nescape of Matheus, a similar course had been adopted against Rovero, who\r\nwas indebted for his liberty only to information from Signor Pignana on the\r\nnight before the coming of the police. A note from Aminta told Monte-Leone\r\nof the disappearance of Rovero. The Count was then completely at sea, and\r\nhe was abandoned by all to a horrible imputation which he could neither\r\navenge nor dispute. He could, therefore, only suffer and bide his time.\r\nResignation, doubt, and delay, were terrible punishments to his energetic\r\nand imperative character. One hope remained, which, if realized, would\r\nenable him to contradict all the imputations on his honor. This was, that\r\nhe would be able to share the fate of his comrades, not of Von Apsberg and\r\nTaddeo, who had escaped, but of those who languished in the cells of _la\r\nForce_ and the _Conciergerie_. The Count knew that the police, from the\r\nperusal of the archives, must be aware of his position, and awaited hourly\r\nand daily his arrest. This did not take place, though he perpetually\r\nreceived anonymous letters of the most perplexing and embarrassing\r\ncharacter, charging him, in the grossest terms of the language, with being\r\na spy and a traitor to the association to which he had pledged his life and\r\nhis honor. He resolved at last to play a desperate game--to exhibit an\r\nunheard of energy and power. He repudiated the disdainful impunity which\r\napparently was inflicted on him intentionally. He surrendered himself to\r\nthe police....\r\n\r\nWhile Count Monte-Leone acted thus courageously, the following scene took\r\nplace in a hotel whither our readers have been previously taken.\r\n\r\nA man apparently about thirty years old sat pale and downcast at a table,\r\nwriting with extreme rapidity. Occasionally he rested his weary head on his\r\nhand, and his eyes wandered across the sky which he saw through a\r\ntrap-window, so usual in that room of houses known as the garret.[4] He\r\nthen glanced on the paper, and wrote down the inspirations he seemed to\r\nhave evoked from the abode of angels. He was the occupant of a garret,\r\nwhich, though small, seemed so disguised by taste and luxury that the\r\nnarrow abode appeared even luxurious. The table at which the writer sat was\r\nof Buhl, and was ornamented by vases of Sevres ware. The wooden bedstead\r\nwas hidden by a silken coverlet, and a large arm-chair occupied a great\r\nportion of the room. On the small chimney-piece of varnished stone was a\r\nchina vase filled with magnificent flowers from hot-houses, above which\r\narose a superb camelia. A curtain of blue shut out the glare of the sun. It\r\nwas easy to see that female taste had presided over the arrangements of\r\nthis room. A beautiful woman really had done so. The inmate of the room was\r\nDoctor von Apsberg. The girl of whom we have spoken was Marie d'Harcourt.\r\n\r\nOn the day of Rene's arrest, a fortnight before the one we write of, the\r\nDoctor was alone when the secret panel was opened. Pignana suddenly\r\nappeared before the Doctor and told him that his house as well as the\r\nDoctor's was surrounded by suspicious looking people. Pignana therefore\r\nadvised him to go at once. Von Apsberg was about to go to his bureau and\r\ntake possession of his papers. The police did not allow him time to do so;\r\nthey knocked at that very moment at the door and entered the house before\r\nVon Apsberg had time to leave. It will be remembered that the studio of\r\nthe Doctor in which the archives were kept, was in the third story of the\r\nhouse. Matheus was, therefore, forced to fly through the opening, into\r\nPignana's house, and with his ear to the wall listened to the noise made by\r\nthe police, with thankfulness for the secret passage. He heard a deep voice\r\nsay, \"If your Jacobin Doctor has escaped, you shall answer for it.\" This\r\nwas said to Mlle. Crepineau. The good maiden swore the Doctor was absent,\r\nas she thought, or feigned to think. Another voice, with a deep southern\r\naccent, said the following words, which the young Doctor heard with\r\nsurprise and fear:\r\n\r\n\"The one you seek is gone. If, though, you would find him, press that\r\ncopper nail which you see on the third row of books. You will find the\r\nmeans of his escape into the next house.\"\r\n\r\nA cry was heard from the interior of the room. A female voice thus spoke to\r\nthe man who had just spoken: \"Senor Munez, it is abominable for you thus to\r\nbetray the poor fellows. You are a bad and heartless man.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Doctor heard thus revealed the secret of his retreat, he had\r\npushed through the inner door, and it was well he did, for it gave him time\r\nto leave the room. The door of the library offered but a feeble resistance,\r\nwhich was soon overcome, and Pignana's house was carefully entered and\r\nsearched.\r\n\r\nHe at once conceived an idea of a plan of escape. He said to Pignana, \"Not\r\na word; but follow me.\" Von Apsberg, accompanied by Pignana, left the place\r\nwhere they were concealed, went into the yard, and proceeded to a shed\r\nwhich was separated from his house by a few badly joined planks. One of\r\nthese he removed, passed through the opening, and stood in an outhouse\r\nwhere he remembered he had once made some anatomical inquiries.\r\n\r\n\"But you are going back,\" said Pignana, \"you will again fall in the hands\r\nof the enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would be a bad general, Pignana,\" said Von Apsberg; \"this is a common\r\n_ruse de guerre_, and is known as a counter-march. These places have been\r\nexplored by the enemy, and consequently they will return no more. While the\r\nagents are looking where we are not, we will return where they have been.\"\r\n\r\nWhen night came, and at this time of the year it was at four o'clock,\r\nPignana told his companion of his plan. He purposed to scale the wall of\r\nthe yard by means of the trellices of the vines. When once on the other\r\nside they would be in the garden of the Duke d'Harcourt, from which the\r\nyoung physician expected to go to the hotel to obtain protection from the\r\nVicomte. The execution of this plan was easy for one as thin as d'Harcourt,\r\nbut was impracticable to a person with an abdomen like Pignana. As soon as\r\nnight had come, the latter said to Von Apsberg, \"Go through the air,\r\nDoctor, if you can. I intend to adopt a more earthly route--through the\r\ndoor of the house, even if, much to Mlle. Crepineau's terror, I have the\r\naudacity to assume the guise of the suicide, and terrify her into opening\r\nthe door for me. Besides, I am but slightly compromised, and will extricate\r\nmyself. Adieu, then, Doctor,\" said he, \"and good luck to you amid the\r\nclouds!\" Von Apsberg clasped his hand, hurried from his retreat, ascended\r\nthe wall, passed it, and a few minutes after was in the Duke's garden.\r\nTaking advantage of the darkness he went to the hotel, every window of\r\nwhich, to his surprise, he found closed. He went without being seen to the\r\ndoor of the reception rooms on the ground floor. The window had not been\r\nshut since the arrest of the Vicomte. The Doctor entered it. At the back of\r\nthis room was a boudoir a la Louis XIV., of rare elegance, and appropriated\r\nto Marie d'Harcourt. Amid the darkness he heard a strange sound of sighs\r\nand sobs. The Doctor drew near, expecting that there was some pain for him\r\nto soothe. \"Who is there?\" said the Duke d'Harcourt.\r\n\r\n\"It is I, my lord, Doctor Matheus.\"\r\n\r\n\"You here, sir!\" said the Duke; \"they told me that, like my unfortunate\r\nson, you were arrested; and for the same offence.\"\r\n\r\n\"What say you, sir?\" said Von Apsberg, with deep distress; \"Rene, dear\r\nRene, arrested?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said the old Duke; \"arrested and torn from his father's arms.\r\nYet the blow did not overwhelm me. This, though, will take place ere long,\r\nand the executioner's axe will strike father and son at once.\"\r\n\r\nA footman appeared with lights, and the Doctor saw the whole family\r\nweeping. His head rested on Marie's shoulder, and the long white hair of\r\nthe old man was mingled with the young girl's dark locks, and seemed like\r\nthe silvery light of the moon resting on her brown hair. The Duke saw at a\r\nglance how the Doctor participated in all his sorrows, and how the fate of\r\nhis son lacerated the heart of his visitor. He gave his hand to the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I forgive you,\" said he, \"the part you have had in my son's error, when I\r\nremember how you love him, and the care you have taken of Marie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! Monsieur,\" said Von Apsberg; \"that duty I can discharge no longer.\r\nThe fate of Rene must be mine, to-morrow, to-day, in a few moments--for I\r\ncame to seek for concealment. If, though, he has lost his liberty; if all\r\nhis plans are destroyed, why should I any longer contend against\r\nmisfortune? Adieu, Duke! I will rejoin Rene, share his misfortune, and\r\ndefend his life; if not against men, at least against the cruel disease\r\nwhich menaces his career.\"\r\n\r\nAs she heard these words, the cheeks of Marie d'Harcourt became pale as\r\nmarble, and she said, in tones of deep distress, \"Father, will you suffer\r\nhim to go thus?\"\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg looked at her with trouble and surprise.\r\n\r\n\"No, my child,\" said the Duke, \"the Doctor will not leave us; and we will\r\nprotect him.\" Von Apsberg then told the bold means by which he had entered\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\n\"No one saw,\" said the Duke, \"_how_ you came hither?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no suspicion?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\nAssisted by Marie, the Duke contrived a plan for an impenetrable asylum for\r\nthe Doctor. In the right wing of the hotel were many rooms intended for\r\nservants, and uninhabited; for, since the death of his other sons, the Duke\r\nhad greatly reduced his household. In one of these rooms, carefully decked\r\nand furnished, by Marie's care, Doctor Matheus was fixed. The old secretary\r\nof the Duke d'Harcourt alone was in the secret, and this worthy man took\r\ncharge of the food of the Doctor, who saw no one except Marie and her\r\nfather. The young girl gradually became bolder, and touched with pity at\r\nthe loneliness of the prisoner, obeyed the dictates of her own heart and\r\nwent frequently to the young Doctor's room to be sure that he was in want\r\nof nothing. Like a consoling angel, she came with her celestial presence to\r\nadorn the captive's retreat, and restore something of happiness to his\r\nheart. Von Apsberg, who had been for some days left alone, had reflected\r\ndeeply on his political opinions and on their consequences. The immense\r\ndifference between all old principles and the innovating ideas of\r\nCarbonarism caused him to doubt the triumph of the latter; the great\r\ndiscouragement which Monte-Leone's _apparent treason_ had produced, and the\r\nfate of his associates, produced a deep impression on him. Amid all these\r\ngloomy thoughts, one fresh and prominent idea reinvigorated his mind, and\r\ngave him ineffable joy.\r\n\r\nWithout wishing to analyze his feelings towards Marie, the Doctor was under\r\ntheir influence. He did not dream of ever possessing that aristocratic\r\nheart from which he was separated by rank, birth, and fortune. The heart of\r\nman, nevertheless, is so constituted, that the most honest and loyal man is\r\nnever exempt from a shadow of egotism. Perhaps, therefore, in the Doctor's\r\nmind there was a feeble hope of approaching that class whose position he so\r\nenvied. Let this be as it may, abandoning himself to the luxury of seeing\r\nalways by his side this beautiful creature, whose health his care had\r\nalready revived, the Doctor blessed his captivity, and lived in anxious\r\nexpectation of the hours when Marie used to visit him. Von Apsberg\r\npossessed that Platonic heart which enabled him to look on Marie as a\r\ncreature of pure poetry. He entertained so respectful a tenderness for the\r\nyoung girl, that he distrusted her no more than she did him.\r\n\r\nOn the day we found the Doctor writing in his retreat with such ardor, he\r\nwas writing out a _regime_ for his patient. He told her what to do, and, as\r\nif gifted with prescience, provided for her future life.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" said he, \"I be discovered--if the future have in reserve for the\r\nheiress d'Harcourt\"--and his heart felt as if a sharp iron had transfixed\r\nit--\"if a noble marriage separate me from her; at least in this painful\r\nstudy of her health she will be able to contend against her family disease,\r\nand perhaps will be indebted to me for life, happy and unsuffering.\" The\r\nidea seemed too much for the strength of the young physician as he saw thus\r\nfade before him all hope of a union with Marie. Steps just then were heard\r\noutside his room just as he was concluding the sad _memoire_ we have spoken\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, in obedience to the request of his host, answered no knock, and\r\ngave no evidence of life, except at a concerted signal known only to three\r\npersons--the Duke, his daughter, and D'Arbel. Therefore he listened. The\r\nperson who advanced paused for a time before his door, and then left\r\nrapidly as it had come. Von Apsberg, however, by means of that lover's\r\nintuition, guessed who it was. The eyes of his heart pierced the opacity of\r\nthe door, to enable him to admire the charming angel who had alighted at\r\nhis door and flown away. Before this angel had disappeared from the long\r\ncorridor which led to the Doctor's room, the door was opened, and he paused\r\nto glance at the young girl who was ready to escape. Marie returned to the\r\nDoctor, and advanced slowly towards him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Monsieur,\" said she to Matheus, \"it is wrong in you not to keep your\r\npromise better. You promised my father never to open the door without a\r\nsignal--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why then, Mademoiselle, did you not give the signal?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not come to see you,\" said Marie; \"but I brought you books and\r\nflowers. I am so afraid you will grow weary in this little room, where you\r\nare always alone and sad.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, the angel girl went to the Doctor's room, as she would have\r\ndone to her brother's, without any hesitation or trouble. She was robed in\r\ninnocence; and if her heart beat a little louder than usual then, the child\r\nattributed it entirely to the rapidity with which she had ascended the\r\nstairs. The Doctor took the books and flowers which she had placed at his\r\ndoor, and put them in the vase on the mantle. He was glad to be able to\r\nlook away from Marie's face, for he felt that his countenance told all he\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\"I took the most amusing books from my little library,\" said she. \"One\r\nlearned as you are, always immersed in study, may not approve of my choice.\r\nPerhaps though, Monsieur, as you read them you will think of your\r\npatient--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I do so always,\" said Von Apsberg. \"I was thinking of you when you\r\ncame.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were writing,\" said Marie, as she looked at the sheet Von Apsberg\r\npointed out to her.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Mademoiselle, I wrote for you. You must follow one rule of conduct in\r\nrelation to your health, when you are separated from your father--when you\r\nare married.\"\r\n\r\n\"Married!\" said Mlle. d'Harcourt, and she grew pale. \"I never thought of\r\nbeing married.\"\r\n\r\n\"But marry you must. You will marry rich; and, Mlle., a husband worthy of\r\nyou. Ere long you will have many suitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said the girl, \"our house now is hung with mourning. The life\r\nof my brother is in danger, and my health, as you said, is frail and\r\nfeeble. All this you know is altogether contradictory to what you say. As\r\nfor myself,\" said she, with an emotion she experienced for the first time,\r\n\"I am happy as I now am, and desire no other position, I must leave you,\r\nthough,\" added she: \"for now my father must have come from the prison where\r\nhe obtained leave to visit my brother. I am anxious to hear from him. The\r\nDuke and myself will soon tell you about him.\"\r\n\r\nLight as a vapor, rapid as a cloud, the young girl left the Doctor's room,\r\nto his eyes radiant with the lustre she left behind her.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--THE CONCIERGERIE.\r\n\r\nEight days after the conversation between Von Apsberg and Marie, the Doctor\r\nheard a knock at his door. The latter was reading over for the twentieth\r\ntime one of the books which had been brought him. This book was Telemachus,\r\nthe poetical romance one might have fancied Homer himself had dreamed of,\r\nand which Virgil and Ovid had written--the book in which morals are\r\nenwrapped in so dense a covering of flowers, that a reader often refuses to\r\nglance at the serious part of the work, and pays attention only to the\r\ngraceful superficies. Von Apsberg, however, read the book, not for its own\r\nsake, but for the sake of her who had given it to him. Marie had read every\r\npage, and her hands had turned over every leaf. This fact gave the history\r\nof the son of Ulysses an immense value in the eyes of the young Doctor, and\r\nmade Telemachus, not Fenelon's, but Marie d'Harcourt's book. The knock at\r\nthe Doctor's door was followed by the concerted signal. He opened it, and\r\nsaw the Duke's old secretary. \"Monsieur,\" said he, \"as the Duke is absent,\r\nI am come to say that Mlle. Marie is ill. I know your care will be useful.\r\nShe does not, though, send for you, being too feeble to come up stairs, and\r\nafraid to ask you to come down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur d'Arbel, let no one into the hotel; and tell Mlle. I will visit\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"She will see you, Monsieur, in the window next to the drawing-room. I will\r\nsend the servants out of the way, so that you can see Mlle. Marie without\r\nfear of discovery.\"\r\n\r\nAll the Secretary's arrangements were carried out, and a few minutes after\r\nMatheus waited on his fair patient. She was ill. Since her conversation\r\nwith the Doctor, her health had really changed. Something mental seemed to\r\ninfluence it. Her complexion, sullied by the tears she had shed since her\r\nbrother's arrest, was faded, and a flush was visible on her cheeks alone.\r\nThese symptoms made the Doctor unhappy. He, therefore, approached Marie\r\nwith great uneasiness.\r\n\r\nShe said: \"How kind you are, Doctor, to risk your liberty: I could not\r\notherwise have seen you. I have not strength enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will try soon to confer it on you, if God grants me power to attend to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall die,\" said she with an anxious voice, which penetrated the\r\nDoctor's very heart, \"if you cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"For your sake,\" said Matheus, \"I will defend my liberty by every means in\r\nmy power, for I wish to restore your health, and preserve an existence\r\nindispensable to your father's happiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"How I suffer,\" said Marie, placing her hand on her snowy brow. \"I have an\r\nintense pain, which passes from temple to temple, and gives me much\r\nsuffering.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you sleep well?\" asked Matheus.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, for many days I have not slept, or if I have, phantoms have\r\nflitted across my slumbers.\" She blushed as she spoke. This the Doctor did\r\nnot see, for he was searching out a remedy.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"I think we must use a remedy which has hitherto\r\nsucceeded. Magnetism will enable you to sleep, and perhaps will soothe your\r\nsufferings.\" Rising, then, he placed his hand on the patient's brow, as he\r\nhad done a few months before when the Marquise had experienced such good\r\neffects from it. He placed his hands on the young girl's temples, and then\r\nmade passes across her face, the result of which was that she sank softly\r\nto sleep. The state of somnambulism ensued, and Marie unfolded the\r\ncondition of her heart to the young physician. While he was thus engaged\r\nthe Duke entered.\r\n\r\n\"You here, Doctor?\" said he; \"how imprudent!\"\r\n\r\n\"_She_ was suffering,\" said the physician; \"now she sleeps.\" The Duke\r\nthanked Von Apsberg for his care, but seemed to centre all his hope in the\r\nyoung Doctor, as the sailor devotes himself to the lord of storms and\r\nwaves. Now, though, every word the Duke said seemed a reproach. He\r\nshuddered as he thought of the confessions of Mlle. d'Harcourt, and asked\r\nhimself if he participated in her sentiments or had suffered her to divine\r\nhis. All his delicacy and loyalty revolted from the idea that this\r\nconfession would cost the unfortunate father the life of his daughter.[5]\r\nVon Apsberg saw that henceforth it would be impossible for him to remain\r\nlonger at the Duke's hotel, and that it would be criminal to remain with\r\none the secret thoughts of whom he knew. He, therefore, made up his mind to\r\nspeak to the Duke. Just then Marie, who had been for some time free from\r\nany magnetic influence, awoke calm and smiling. \"How deliciously I have\r\nslept,\" said she; \"how well I am!\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke kissed her affectionately. He said, \"All this you owe to the\r\nDoctor; and I thank heaven amid our misfortunes that he has been preserved\r\nto us. I am glad I have been able to rescue him from his persecutors, and\r\npreserve my daughter's health by means of his own watchful care.\"\r\n\r\nMarie gave the Doctor her hand. The young girl did not remember what she\r\nhad said while she slept. This slumber of the heart, however, could not\r\nlast, and the young Doctor knew it. He resolved on the painful sacrifice\r\nwhich, but for the waking of his patient, he would at once have\r\ncommunicated to the Prince.\r\n\r\nThe reflections of the night confirmed the Doctor in the course he had\r\nresolved to adopt. On the next day he put on a long cloak, which disguised\r\nhis stature, and went to the room of the Duke, after having also put on a\r\nwig which Rene often wore when he visited Matheus, and which the Duke had\r\nsent for to enable him in case of a surprise to leave unrecognized.\r\n\r\nThe distress of the Duke at the Vicomte's imprisonment increased every day.\r\nHe had only once been able to reach his son, and had contrived to inspire\r\nthe captive with hopes of liberty he was far from entertaining himself. The\r\nVicomte was actively watched, and his most trifling actions were observed.\r\nEver alone in the sad cell in which he had been confined, ennui and despair\r\ntook possession of him, and his brilliant mind, to which mirth and activity\r\nhad been indispensable, became downcast and miserable. Since the visit of\r\nhis father, also, his delicate chest had begun to suffer. What the Doctor\r\nespecially apprehended for his friend was the possibility of cold and\r\ndampness producing a dangerous irritation of the respiratory organs. This\r\ntook place; for nothing could be more humid and icy than the cell of Rene.\r\nHe had a dry and incessant cough. The keepers paid no attention to it, and\r\nthe keeper of the Conciergerie treated it as a simple cold of no\r\nimportance. The Vicomte was unwilling to inform his father of it lest he\r\nshould be uneasy, and the mere indisposition rapidly became a serious and\r\nterrible disease. This was the state of things when Von Apsberg presented\r\nhimself before the Duke. \"What is the matter?\" said the old man. \"Are you\r\ndiscovered and forced to leave us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Duke,\" said the Doctor, \"let me first express my deepest thanks for your\r\ngenerous hospitality. Let me tell you how much your kindness has soothed\r\nthe cruel suffering to which I have been subjected day and night for three\r\nweeks. I would, had it not been for your kindness, have weeks ago shared\r\nthe captivity of Rene; and the hope I entertained of being of use to your\r\ndaughter, alone prevented me from surrendering myself to despair at the\r\nprospect of a crushed and prospectless life, when I saw my brethren\r\narrested in consequence of one whom I had always looked on as a devoted\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not speak to me of that man,\" said the Duke in a terrible tone, \"for my\r\nson, in my presence, charged him with having betrayed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have spoken to you of my gratitude,\" said the Doctor, \"that you might\r\nnot doubt it now at our separation.\"\r\n\r\n\"What danger now menaces you?\" said the Duke, \"why do you leave us?\"\r\n\r\n\"To avoid being ungrateful,\" said Von Apsberg. \"That you may never accuse\r\nyour guest of selfishness, and that he may always deserve the esteem with\r\nwhich you honor him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the meaning of this mysterious language?\"\r\n\r\n\"Grant me,\" said the young physician, with a trembling voice, \"the boon of\r\nbeing permitted to keep the cause of my departure a secret. You would be as\r\nsorry to hear as I would be to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the old man, \"I will not consent to this. You shall not quit the\r\nhouse which shelters you from your enemies: no, you shall not. Ah! sir,\"\r\ncontinued the Duke, \"if you will not remain for your own sake do so for\r\nmine, for you alone have preserved the life of my daughter thus far.\" The\r\nDoctor said, as he gave a paper to the Duke: \"Here is the result of my\r\nstudy, in which I have traced out all the means known to science calculated\r\nto strengthen the health of your daughter, and to parry the dangers which\r\nmenace her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" said the Duke, \"do not distress me by leaving the hotel. Do not\r\nmake me perpetually miserable, Doctor, I am already unfortunate enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the young man, unable to resist his prayers any longer, \"you\r\nshall know what forces me to go, and shall yourself judge of my duty.\" He\r\nfell at the Duke's feet, and told him all he had learned during Marie's\r\nslumber, his combats with himself, and his resolution.\r\n\r\n\"You are an honest man,\" said the Duke, with an expression of poignant\r\ngrief, and lifting him up: \"but I am a most unfortunate father.\"\r\n\r\nD'Asbel just then came in with a letter.\r\n\r\n\"From my son,\" said the Duke, and he opened it. The features of the old man\r\nassumed, as he read, such an expression of terror, that Von Apsberg and the\r\nSecretary advanced towards him and sustained him, for he seemed ready to\r\nfaint. \"Read,\" said he, with a voice half indistinct, and he gave the\r\nDoctor the letter. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR FATHER:--I can conceal no longer that I am dying. One man alone,\r\nwho has often soothed me by his care and advice, can now save me. This is\r\nVon Apsberg. I cannot, though, ask him to accompany you, for he would\r\nendanger his own liberty. Come, then, dear father, to see me for the last\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go, sir,\" said the Doctor. \"Let us not delay a minute, for in an\r\nhour--it may be too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you expose your life, Doctor, by going among your enemies,\" said the\r\nDuke.\r\n\r\n\"But I will save his,\" said Von Apsberg. The Duke rushed into his arms.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour afterwards two men entered the Conciergerie. They were the\r\nVicomte's father and an English doctor whom the Duke brought to see his\r\nson. The Director of the prison did not dare to refuse a father and\r\nphysician permission to see a sick son and patient. With the turnkeys they\r\npassed an iron grate, beyond which was seen a vaulted passage, which, in\r\nthe darkness, seemed interminable. On the inner side of the grate sat a\r\nmorose looking man, whom nature seemed to have created exclusively to live\r\nin one of these earthly hells. His only duty was to open and shut the\r\ngrate, to which he seemed as firmly attached as one of its own bars. His\r\nduty was not without danger, for in case of a mutiny, the Cerberus had\r\norders to throw on the outside the heavy key he was intrusted with, and\r\nthus expose himself, without means of escape, to the rage of the criminals.\r\nThey showed this man their pass. The key turned in the lock, and the grate\r\npermitted them to enter. It then swung to, filling the vaulted passage with\r\nits clash. Near this was a dark room, in which were several dark-browed\r\njailers and gend'armes.\r\n\r\nThe Duke and the Doctor were minutely examined. One of them, whose features\r\nhidden by a dirty cap might recall one of the persons of this history, left\r\nthe group, opened the grate, and disappeared rapidly, just as a new jailer\r\nguided the visitors to a long corridor in one of the cells, on opening\r\nwhich was the Vicomte D'Harcourt. On a miserable pallet, in a kind of dark\r\ncellar, into which the day seemed to penetrate reluctantly, through a\r\ngrated window, was Rene D'Harcourt, the last hope of an illustrious house,\r\nwithout air or any of the attentions his situation demanded. The Duke wept\r\nto see him. Rene, with hollow cheeks, and eyes sparkling with a burning\r\nfever, arose with pain and extended his arms to his father, who embraced\r\nhim tenderly.\r\n\r\nFifteen days had expanded his disease, the germs of which had long slept in\r\nhis system. The bad air and icy dew, amid which he lived, the absence of\r\nconstant and vigilant care, in such cases so indispensable, had, as it\r\nwere, conspired against him. A violent and dry cough every moment burst\r\nfrom his chest, and at every access his strength seemed more and more\r\nfeeble. Had he sooner informed his father of his condition, beyond doubt,\r\nsome active remedy would have been used, not for pity's sake, for at that\r\ntime little was shown to conspirators, but from fear of the liberal press,\r\nwhose censure the administration dreaded. Rene, however, was too disdainful\r\nof the persons he called his executioners to ask any favors. The physician\r\nof the prison, as we have said, was satisfied with ordering a few trifling\r\npalliatives. The Vicomte was dying without his even being aware of it. When\r\nthe turnkey had introduced the Duke and the Englishman he left, telling\r\nthem that in a few minutes he would return. Then the Vicomte saw that a\r\nstranger was with his father. The latter approached, and taking the young\r\nman's hand pressed it to his heart with an affection which told the\r\nprisoner who visited him.\r\n\r\n\"Von Apsberg! Ah! father, I knew he would come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be silent, dear Rene; be silent,\" said the Doctor, \"for your sake and\r\nmine. Forget that I am your friend, and remember me only as a doctor. Tell\r\nme how you suffer. Speak quick, for time is precious. Tell me nothing--and\r\ndo not exhaust yourself in describing--what is plain enough, I am sorry to\r\nsay. I see, I read in your eyes, what is your condition.\"\r\n\r\nTo hide his tears Von Apsberg looked away. A father's heart though could\r\nnot be deceived, and the Duke had seen the Doctor's tears. The old man\r\nsaid, \"Save, Doctor, save my son.\"\r\n\r\nVon Apsberg made an effort to surmount the grief which overcame him.\r\n\r\n\"We will save him,\" said he, calmly; \"there is a remedy for such cases,\r\nwhich in a few hours will terminate the progress of the malady, and enable\r\nus to adopt other means. He took a card from his pocket and wrote a\r\nprescription, which he ordered to be sent immediately to the nearest\r\napothecary. He yet had the card in his hand when the door of the cell was\r\nviolently thrown open, and several men accompanied by gend'armes rushed in\r\nand seized the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Arrest him,\" said an officer. \"It is he, the German physician whom we have\r\nso long sought for. He has been recognized.\" Nothing could equal the effect\r\nof this scene. The Vicomte made useless attempts to leave his bed and\r\nassist his friend. The Duke was pale and agitated; and Von Apsberg, calm\r\nand resigned, gave himself up to the men who surrounded him. In anxiety for\r\nRene he had forgotten himself.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"you may do as you please with me, but, for heaven's\r\nsake, let me remain a few moments with this young man, and one of you hurry\r\nfor this prescription I have written.\"\r\n\r\n\"A paper,\" said the principal agent with joy, when he saw what Von Apsberg\r\nhad in his hand. \"It is, perhaps, a plan of escape. This must be taken to\r\nthe Director for the _Procureur du Roi_. Another scheme, perhaps, of the\r\nJacobin has come to light----\" He put the paper in his huge pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Take this man away, said he to the gens d'armes, and do not let him speak\r\na word to the prisoner.\" Rushing on Von Apsberg like famished wolves, they\r\nbore him away, and left the Duke alone with his son. The shock had done the\r\nprisoner much injury. He sunk back on his bed with a violent cough, and\r\nfelt a mortal coldness glide over his frame and chill his blood.\r\n\r\n\"A doctor, a doctor,\" said the Duke, rushing towards the door. \"A\r\nphysician, for heaven's sake. My son is dying.\" The door did not close. The\r\npoor father leaning over his child pressed his lips to his burning brow,\r\nand then supported his head, from time to time attempting to warm his icy\r\nhands with his breath. He continued to call in heaven's name for a\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour after Von Apsberg's arrest, and while the Duke yet pressed his\r\nson's inanimate body, three men appeared in the room. They were the\r\nDirector, Doctor, and Jailer of the prison.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" said the Duke to the Director, rising to his full stature, and\r\nwith a tone of painful solemnity, \"you are an accomplice in a great crime,\r\nand before the country and king, I, Duke d'Harcourt, peer of France, and\r\ngrand cordon of the Saint Esprit, will accuse you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What mean you, sir?\" said the Director, with a terror he could not\r\nconceal. \"Of what do you complain?\"\r\n\r\n\"That you have placed in a cell, without air and light, as if he were\r\nsentenced to death, a man against whom there is now a mere suspicion; for\r\nhe has not been tried. I complain that you have wrested from me a physician\r\nI have brought hither to attend to my son--and that with horrible brutality\r\nyou have taken possession of a prescription for a remedy which might have\r\npreserved him, and have by this means deprived him of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke spoke but too truly, for a kind of suffocation took possession of\r\nthe young man. His breast seemed oppressed, and every sign of death was\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nThe Director muttered some apology in defence of himself, but the Duke\r\nsaid, \"Not another word here, sir; accomplish your task in peace; or at\r\nleast, give me back the paper. It is the life of my son----\"\r\n\r\nAs the Director was about to go in person for it, the Doctor called him\r\nback and pointed to the patient over whose countenance death began to\r\nsteal. He said, \"It is too late!\"\r\n\r\nThe Vicomte arose with difficulty and said, \"Father, forgive me the wrong I\r\nhave done. Forgive me, as I forgive others. No, no, not so; for there is\r\none person I cannot forgive!\" He looked around with an expression of\r\nintense hatred and contempt. \"He has ruined and destroyed me, and all of\r\nus; he has delivered us to our enemies,--_that_ man, hear all of you, is\r\nCount Monte-Leone!\" His head sank on his breast, and his last breath\r\nmingled with the kisses of his father.\r\n\r\n\"I have no son!\" said the old man in despair; and he sank by the side of\r\nthe child God had taken away from him.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--THE CONFESSION.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in a previous chapter, Count Monte-Leone went to the\r\nPrefect of Police to surrender himself to his enemies. The Count did not\r\nhesitate, for he preferred a sudden and cruel death to the intolerable life\r\nhe now led. The Prefect was as civil as possible, and altogether different\r\nfrom what he would have been three days before to a person pointed out as\r\none of the agents. The reason was, that after the energetic protestation of\r\nthe Count in the presence of M. H---- at the Duke d'Harcourt's, grave\r\ndoubts had arisen in the mind of the chief of the political police in\r\nrelation to the services said to have been rendered by the Neapolitan.\r\nMaking use then of the police itself, and causing the man who said he was\r\nan agent of the Count's to be watched, his conviction of the\r\nnon-participation of Monte-Leone in the treachery became almost certain,\r\nand he began to tremble at the idea that he had been made a dupe in this\r\naffair, and at the probable consequences. The first of these was the fear\r\nof ridicule, that powerful instrument against a police; next, the just\r\nrecrimination to which the Count might subject them as having slandered\r\nhim; and the capital error of having left at liberty the most powerful of\r\nthe Carbonari in Europe, under the belief that he was an ally of the\r\nGovernment--to which he was a mortal foe. All this crowd of faults H----\r\nhad committed in his blind confidence, and had led astray the police and\r\nall the agents. Thus uneasy, the Chief of Police saw that but one course of\r\nsafety was left him. This was both bold and adroit, for it foresaw danger\r\nand prepared a conductor to turn its thunders aside. H---- went to the\r\nPrefect and owned all. The first anger of the latter having passed away,\r\nthe two chiefs saw with terror that they were equally compromised--the one\r\nfor acting, and the other for suffering his subordinate to act. They,\r\ntherefore, adopted the only course left them, Machiavelian it is true, but\r\nwhich extricated them from a great difficulty. This course was, to deny all\r\nparticipation in the malicious reports circulated in relation to the Count,\r\nbut to suffer the public to imagine what it pleased, and attribute their\r\ninaction to carelessness for the result, or to the mystery necessary to be\r\nobserved in police matters. Count Monte-Leone, too, since the arrest of his\r\naccomplices, and the discovery of his friends, was not greatly to be\r\nfeared, especially as he was now repelled by society as a double traitor.\r\n\r\nTwo things alone disturbed H----. The first was the course of the strange\r\nman who had used the Count's name to unveil so completely the plans of the\r\nconspiracy. He, however, was soon restored to confidence by remembering\r\nthat he was now strictly carrying out this man's plans. Besides, in case of\r\nneed, there were a thousand methods of securing this man's eternal silence.\r\nAs for the pass in Monte-Leone's name, which might be a terrible arm in the\r\npossession of the Count in case he attacked the Government, H----learned\r\nmuch to his satisfaction, from Salvatori himself, that it had been\r\ndestroyed. The Prefect, therefore, did not hesitate to receive the Count.\r\n\"Sir,\" said the latter, \"a horrible slander is circulated against me. In\r\ndisregard of my character and name I have been charged with being one of\r\nyour agents, and beg you to contradict this.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Prefect says your honor is above any such suspicion, and I should fear\r\nI injured you even by referring to so idle a tale.\"\r\n\r\n\"But one of your principal officers has given credit to this rumor by the\r\nperfidious reply he made a few days since, when the Vicomte d'Harcourt was\r\narrested.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prefect rang his bell and sent for M. H----. When the latter arrived,\r\nhe asked him, sternly, if he had seemed to believe that Count Monte-Leone\r\nhad any participation in the acts of the Police.\r\n\r\nH---- said, \"The Count is in error, if he understood me thus. I did not\r\nbelieve that his self-accusation was true, for I could not realize that one\r\nso exalted in rank as the Count, could be guilty of conspiracy. I had no\r\nidea of insulting him, as he thinks. Were it not likely to give the affair\r\ntoo much gravity, I would every where repel it.\"\r\n\r\nThis amazed the Count. His mind, which seemed to give way beneath so many\r\nblows, had looked on this man's reply as an answer. The object of this\r\nperfidy yet escaped him; and reason and good sense could form no idea of\r\nthe motive.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Count,\" said the Prefect, \"all think you so far above the calumny\r\nof which you complain, that we would not dare even to defend you; the\r\ncharacter of the department makes it impossible for us to mix in\r\ndiscussions about reputations.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already asked this gentleman,\" and the Count pointed to M. H----,\r\n\"to furnish a striking proof that I am not the creature they say I am. I\r\nnow ask you the same favor.\" The two officials were annoyed. \"I am as\r\nguilty as those you have arrested,\" continued he, \"and demand a fate like\r\nthat of my associates.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prefect said, \"I never act except from the orders of a higher\r\nauthority, and have none in relation to you. I prefer to think that your\r\ndevotion to those you call your associates has caused you to exaggerate\r\nyour complicity, and when that is proven you will find us just and stern to\r\nyourself, as we have been to them.\" The Prefect bowed and returned to his\r\nprivate office, and the Count left in indescribable agitation. He was\r\ndeprived of his last justification, of one he wished to buy at the price of\r\nhis life. His rage and despair had no limits. He was to experience a new\r\nshock in the death of Vicomte d'Harcourt, which was circulated through all\r\nParis. He also heard that the Duke charged him with being the cause of his\r\ndeath, and with having denounced him.\r\n\r\nWe will now leave our hero for a few moments, to refer to a terrible event\r\nwhich at this crisis overwhelmed the Royal family and France with grief.\r\nThis circumstance, yet enwrapped in mystery, was the death of the Duke de\r\nBerry. This Prince, the hope of France, expiring in the spring time of life\r\nbeneath the dagger of a vulgar assassin; the obscurity which covered the\r\ndetails of the murder distressed all Europe. There was a general outcry\r\nagainst secret societies. The one, the chief members of which were now in\r\nprison, was especially thought guilty of having instigated the murder. The\r\nchiefs of the Carbonari _ventas_ saw their chains grow heavier and their\r\nprisons become dungeons. Ober, the banker F----, General A----, and Von\r\nApsberg, were not spared: their papers were examined, their past life\r\nscrutinized in search of some connection with this odious murder. The trial\r\nof the ruffian was anxiously waited for, in the hope that something would\r\nconnect him with Carbonarism. Nothing, however, was found in the whole of\r\nthe long and minute examination; and it soon became evident that the crime\r\nhad been committed by a fanatic who was isolated, without adherents,\r\ninstigators, or accomplices. Thus at least France thought of the result of\r\nthe trial. This was the impression produced by the execution of Louvel.\r\n\r\nThe liberals, who had been for a time terrified by the reports circulated\r\nin relation to their partisans, began to regain their courage, and,\r\nfortified by their acquittal, complained of the calumnies circulated in\r\nrelation to them. The first reproach cast on Government, and especially on\r\nthe ministry of Decazes, was great injustice towards the Carbonari. The\r\nministry was accused of having invented a conspiracy and\r\nconspirators--questions of political humanity were mooted--and true or\r\nimaginary tortures, to which the prisoners had been subject, were\r\nrecounted. French generosity and pity became interested for the sake of\r\nvictims who languished in chains. One voice, though, was heard above all\r\nothers, and spoke so distinctly, that it touched every heart and mind. It\r\nreached the very throne, and aroused one of those powerful influences which\r\ntruth alone can. This voice was that of the Duke d'Harcourt--a king in\r\nvirtue and feeling. His word was a law people of every shade of opinion\r\nlistened to, in consequence of the admiration caused by his life and\r\nconduct. The Duke, who was entitled to sympathy from the successive death\r\nof his sons, accused those who had taken the last from him of barbarity. He\r\ntold of the death of the Vicomte while suspected of a crime which perhaps\r\nwas imaginary; and in the sublime tones of his despair uttered loud charges\r\nagainst the fallen administration. The new one trembled before a unanimous\r\nsentiment, and sought to win popularity from clemency. This sentiment,\r\nwhich in Louis XVIII. was innate, his ministers echoed. One by one the\r\nprisons were opened and their sad inmates restored to life and light. The\r\nchief Carbonari were less fortunate than their followers. Their trial\r\nprogressed, and though many abortive schemes were discovered, no act was\r\nfound. There were ideas, utopias, and social paradoxes, but nothing\r\npositive. F----, B----, Ober and their associates, whose friends acted\r\nbusily, were subjected to some months' imprisonment, which, added to their\r\nprevious incarceration, seemed to their judges a sufficient punishment for\r\ntheir hopes, which, though criminal, had never been realized. General A----\r\nwas exiled, and Von Apsberg was detained for a long time in the\r\nconciergerie. He was ultimately released. As for Taddeo, all the inquiries\r\nof Aminta and of the Prince de Maulear, who loved him as a son, were vain.\r\nEvery day increased their uneasiness on this account, bringing to light the\r\ndisappointment of some hope. Thus a year passed....\r\n\r\nEarly in April, 1821, a man of about forty sat on a bench in a little\r\ngarden attached to a modest country abode near Neuilly. The garden was on\r\nthe Seine, which was the limit of a kind of town. The man of whom we speak\r\nwas almost bent beneath the double weight of grief and suffering. His\r\nfeatures were sharp and thin, his eyes sunken, and his hair, almost white,\r\ngave him the appearance of one far more advanced in age. In this person\r\nprematurely old and wretched, none would have recognized the brilliant and\r\nelegant Count Monte-Leone, who once had been so deservedly admired. A deep\r\nsorrow had crushed his strong constitution--months to him had become\r\nyears--and he had suffered all that a mind, richly endowed as his was,\r\ncould. Pursued by the atrocious slanders we refer to, he had given way\r\nbeneath the blow. In vain had he striven for some time after his useless\r\nvisit to the Prefect against them. The hideous monster which pursued him\r\nredoubled its attacks, and cries of reprobation burst from every lip. The\r\nrelations and friends of the prisoners reproached him, and adversity seemed\r\nto have seized him with its iron claw. In vain did he protest and call for\r\nproof. All appealed to the circumstances. His many duels made people say in\r\nhis favor only this, \"_Brave as he is, he is a spy!_\" Despair, then, took\r\npossession of him, and he fled from the world which cursed him, and hid\r\nhimself. One reason alone restrained him from suicide. This was, that he\r\nknew another life depended on his, and clung to it as the ivy does to the\r\noak. The Count lived that another might not die. This person was an angel\r\nrather than a woman. It was Aminta. Watching the unfortunate man as a\r\nmother watches a child, braving the public opinion which dishonored him she\r\nadored, Aminta rarely left the Count, whose tears fell on her heart like\r\nburning lava.\r\n\r\nThe Marquise had purchased an establishment near the house of Monte-Leone,\r\nwith whom she passed all her time; for her visits made his desolate heart\r\nmore serene. On the day we speak of, the Count sat in the garden, and old\r\nGiacomo advanced towards him, taking care to announce himself with a slight\r\ncough. \"Monseigneur,\" said he, \"it is I, your intendant. I am come to speak\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no intendant,\" said the Count, \"a miserable outlaw like myself can\r\nindulge in no such luxury. Do not call me Monseigneur; the title now is\r\nbecome an ironical insult.\"\r\n\r\n\"It, however, is your excellency's name, and _that_ the slanderous villains\r\ncannot deprive you of.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have done more than that,\" said the Count, with a bitter smile; \"they\r\nhave destroyed my honor. You shall not call me thus any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the good man, whom the Marquise had told not to thwart\r\nhis master; \"I will call Monseigneur, Count only. You are Monseigneur, for\r\nall that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" said the Count, \"go away, you fatigue me, you injure me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I injure you,\" said Giacomo, \"when you know I would die for you?\"\r\n\r\nThe Count looked around on the companion of all his life; he saw the tears\r\nthe old man shed, and threw himself into his arms. \"Ah! you love me in\r\nspite of all--\"\r\n\r\n\"And so does _she_,\" said Giacomo, whose features became kindled with\r\npleasure at this sudden exhibition of his master's love; \"yes, that noble,\r\ntrue woman loves you dearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aminta!\" said the Count, \"ah! but for her you would have no master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monseigneur,--no--Count!\" said the old valet; \"Madame la Marquise has come\r\nhither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let her come--let her come--when she is with me, I pass my only happy\r\nhours.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said Giacomo, \"but she is not alone--\"\r\n\r\n\"Who accompanies her? Who has come to see the informer? Who dares to brave\r\nthe leprosy?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man said, \"The Prince de Maulear.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Prince! The Prince in my house! No, no! Tell him to go, that I see no\r\none! I will see no one--\"\r\n\r\n\"You will see me, Monsieur?\" said the old nobleman, advancing with Aminta\r\non his arm.\r\n\r\n\"What do you wish, sir?\" said Monte-Leone; \"if you insult me again, you\r\nare indeed cruel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monte-Leone,\" said Aminta, \"the Prince is your friend. His words will be\r\nof service; I brought him hither.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count sank on his seat and was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said the Prince, \"had I not been confined at one of my estates for\r\neight months by an obstinate _gout_, you would have seen me long since.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the Count, with surprise.\r\n\r\n\"You would have seen me brought to you by repentance for the injury I did\r\nyou. I gave way, Monte-Leone, to an indignant feeling I shall regret all my\r\nlife. Reflection has enlightened me. The account I have heard from my\r\ndaughter-in-law, the resources which you concealed, and especially your\r\ndespair, the wasted condition of your health, the ravages of your misery,\r\nher love, her respect, have long told me how unjust I was to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count looked at the Prince with mingled astonishment and doubt. The\r\nPrince said, \"As men of our rank are glad to confess their faults, and ask\r\npardon for them, I beg you, sir, to forgive me.\" The Prince bowed to\r\nMonte-Leone, who seemed overcome by emotion.\r\n\r\nTaking the Prince's hand he placed it on his heart and said, \"Now, sir,\r\nfeel this palpitation, and tell me whether the heart of a bad or guilty man\r\never beat thus with joy, at justice being done him.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this day Monte-Leone enjoyed two of the greatest pleasures of life--a\r\ntender love, and a noble friendship....\r\n\r\nA month after the first visit of the Prince de Maulear to the house at\r\nNeuilly, the following scene took place in a sad room of the _rue Casette_\r\nin the Faubourg St. Germain.\r\n\r\nA sick woman lay on a bed, and a stern dark man sat beside her. \"I tell\r\nyou,\" said she, \"I want a priest, and it is cruel for you to refuse me\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! Signora, you are not sick enough for that. Why have a confidant in\r\nour affairs? Confession is of no use except to the dying!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very sick,\" said she, \"and my strength every day decreases!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let us come to terms, then, Duchess. You shall have a priest--but\r\nyou do not intend to make your confession only to him, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your old ideas again, Stenio!\" said La Felina.\r\n\r\n\"They are not my ideas. Did you not say once when you were very sick, '_No,\r\nI will not die until I am completely avenged. I wish to know whence came\r\nthe shaft which crushed him. I wish him to curse me as I have cursed\r\nhim!_'\"\r\n\r\n\"True!\" said the Duchess, who, as she listened to the Italian, seemed lost\r\nin thought. \"It is true, I said all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the time is come. You fear you are dying, and would not leave your\r\nwork incomplete!\"\r\n\r\n\"But if I tell all,\" said La Felina, \"do you fear nothing for yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"That man is now but a shadow,\" said Salvatori, \"and now in my strong hand\r\nI can grasp him, as he once grasped me, with his iron nerves, when he\r\nstabbed me. Besides, no one would believe him. _Is he not a spy?_\"\r\n\r\nThe first words of the Italian, \"_That man is but a shadow_,\" had arrested\r\nLa Felina's attention. She said, \"Is he much changed? is he very sick?\" She\r\ncould not restrain her accent.\r\n\r\n\"He? yes, indeed; he is dying. Public contempt has completely crushed the\r\nproud giant. We have effected that. Besides,\" continued he, \"in order to\r\nmake a suitable return for the touching interest you inspired me with just\r\nnow, I must tell you I am going. You have made me rich, and if I were so\r\nunfortunate as to lose you--Ah, words never kill,\" added he, as he saw how\r\nterrified La Felina was--\"I would not remain an hour in this accursed\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said she; \"give me writing materials.\" She wrote a few lines\r\nwith a trembling hand.\r\n\r\n\"To the Count,\" said she, giving them to Salvatori; \"I expect him\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said the Italian, sternly. \"This will kill him.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had he left the room when La Felina rang her bell, and the servant\r\nwho had always accompanied her entered. The Duchess drew her towards her,\r\nand placing her lips close to the ear of the woman, as if she was afraid\r\nsome one would hear her, whispered a few words and sank back completely\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nSuch was the Duchess of Palma, the famous singer of San Carlo, whom we find\r\ndying in this unknown and obscure retreat. The hand of God, who does not\r\nalways punish the soul of the criminal alone, but who sometimes strikes the\r\nliving body, weighed heavily on her. The Duke, weary of the ties imposed by\r\nmarriage on him, and becoming more and more infatuated with his thin\r\n_danseuse_, sought for an opportunity to throw off his chains. He soon\r\nfound one. Feigning to be jealous, the Duke, in consequence of some vague\r\nrumors, obtained the key of the bureau in which the Duchess kept the\r\n\"confessions of the heart,\" as she called the detail of her brief amour\r\nwith Monte-Leone. Having gotten possession of this paper, the Duke made a\r\ngreat noise, threatened her with a suit, and easily obtained the separation\r\nhe desired so much. There was a general burst of indignation. The nobles\r\nwho had been furious at the _mesalliance_ of the Duke, were more so at the\r\ningratitude of the guilty wife and low-born woman, who had usurped a rank\r\nand title of which she showed herself so unworthy. The Duchess disappeared\r\nsuddenly from the world, which gladly rejected one it had so unwillingly\r\nreceived. La Felina took refuge in a small house in the retired quarter we\r\nhave mentioned. For, like _Venus attached to her prey_, she would not\r\nleave Paris, in which she could not divest herself of the idea that\r\nMonte-Leone, completely reinstated, would some day become Aminta's husband.\r\nSickness had gradually enfeebled her, and Salvatori, who was master of her\r\nsecrets, had established himself in her house. Taking advantage of her\r\ncomplicity, he had, by means of cunning and terror, became in a manner the\r\nmaster and tyrant, now that her health was gone, of one to whom he had been\r\nan abject slave. For this reason he had, as we have seen, treated her with\r\nsuch cruel disdain.\r\n\r\nOn the very day this scene took place, Monte-Leone received the following\r\nnote: \"A woman, whose handwriting you will recognize, has but a few hours\r\nto live. Come to see her for the sake of that pity she deserves. Do not\r\nresist the prayers of one who is on her death-bed.\" Below was the address\r\nof the Duchess.\r\n\r\nThe Count had long lost sight of La Felina; he knew she was separated from\r\nher husband, but was so indifferent that he had not even asked why. Always\r\nkind and generous, he thought duty required him to go, and on the next day\r\nat noon, rang at La Felina's door. Stenio had preceded him a few moments,\r\nand in the next room prepared to enjoy the scene. No sooner had the Count\r\nentered the bedroom than Salvatori thought he heard steps in a boudoir\r\nconnected with it, and which opened on a back stairway. Uneasy at this\r\nnoise, for which he could not account, he was yet unable to satisfy\r\nhimself; for to do so, he would have been again obliged to cross the\r\nDuchess's room, and the Count was already with her.\r\n\r\nWhen the Count and La Felina met, a cry of astonishment burst from the lips\r\nof each. They seemed to each other two spectres.\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said the Duchess, in faint and broken voice, \"the time is come\r\nwhen the truth must be told, ere the tongue on which it depends be cold in\r\nthe grave. You are, therefore, about to hear the truth as the dying tell it\r\nwho have lost all dread of men and their wrath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak out, Signora; my life has been so strange that nothing now can\r\nsurprise me,\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"You will be astonished; for I am about to read the riddle, the mystery,\r\nwhich you have so long attempted to penetrate.\" The Count was attentive.\r\n\"You have,\" said La Felina, \"sought to know who was the secret enemy who\r\ndeprived you of name and fame. I am about to tell you.\" The Count seemed\r\nsurprised. \"Do not interrupt me,\" said she. \"This enemy has followed your\r\nsteps and poisoned your life. Thus has it been effected: You were ruined,\r\nreally ruined, but twice have fifty thousand francs been sent to you, and\r\nyou have been made to believe that this was but a restoration of your\r\nfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did it not come from Lamberti?\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"No; bankrupts never pay. A forged letter from this banker insisted on\r\nsilence in relation to this restoration, and thus the mysterious resources\r\nwere created which awakened the suspicions of the world, and caused the\r\nreport that you were an agent of the police to be believed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Count grew pale with horror.\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" said La Felina. \"A man, a devil, purchased by your enemy, in\r\nobedience to orders, went to the house of Matheus, your associate in\r\nCarbonarism. This devil opened the drawer in which the archives of the\r\nassociation were kept, and taking possession of the lists, substituted\r\ncopies for the originals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Infamous,\" said Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"This devil did more. He dared to procure you a pass as a 'Spy in Society.'\r\nThis pass your friend Taddeo Rovero saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God, my God, can I hear aright?\"\r\n\r\n\"This man did not think you were as yet sufficiently degraded in the eyes\r\nof the world and your brethren. Taking advantage of a visit you paid me, he\r\nwent into your carriage with a cloak like yours over his shoulders, and was\r\ndriven to the Prefecture of Police.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is hell itself,\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"Did I not say this man was a demon?\" said La Felina, coldly. \"All this\r\nevidence was accumulated against you. The French Government was deceived,\r\nand did not exert severity towards the powerful chief of the Carbonari, now\r\nbecome, as it believed, its agent. The world and public opinion did their\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why was all this? what was the motive?\"\r\n\r\n\"You had destroyed the happiness of your enemy, and in return the sacrifice\r\nof your honor was exacted; you had deserted one who adored you, and sought\r\nto marry another; to prevent this she disgraced you. Now, Count\r\nMonte-Leone,\" said La Felina, rising up, \"is it necessary for me to name\r\nthat woman? Do you know me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wretch!\" said the Count, \"are you not afraid that I will kill you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" said she, \"am I not dying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"you shall carry to the tomb one crime in addition to the\r\noffences you have revealed to me. With honor you destroyed my life.\" Taking\r\na pistol from his bosom he placed it to his brow, and was about to fire--\r\n\r\nAt the last words of the Count a door was thrown open, and an arm seized\r\nMonte-Leone's hand. He looked around and saw the Duke D'Harcourt.\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said he, \"one person alone can restore you the honor of which you\r\nhave been so rudely deprived. That person is the Duke D'Harcourt.\"\r\n\r\n\"The voice of the man, of the father,\" said he, and his eyes became\r\nsuffused with tears, \"who charged you publicly with having denounced his\r\nson, and surrendered him to the executioners, with having killed him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! God himself sends you hither,\" said the Count, with an indescribable\r\naccent of hope. \"Yes, yes; you have heard all, and will be believed.\r\nMonsieur,\" said he, with great animation, \"have you not heard all? You know\r\nhow I have been treated by those monsters. You will say so. Tell me that\r\nyou will. I cast myself at your feet to implore you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Count,\" said the Duke, lifting up Monte-Leone and embracing him, \"I am the\r\nguilty man, for louder than any one I have uttered an anathema on the\r\ninnocent. I have appealed to man and God for vengeance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Count, \"and touched by the immensity of my sufferings God\r\nhas led you hither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, God,\" said the Duke, \"and _she_;\" pointing to La Felina, whose eyes\r\nbrightened up with animation, strangely contrasted with the morbid palor of\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n\"_She?_\" said the Count.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Duke. \"Stricken down by repentance, she besought me\r\nyesterday to come hither to hear her confession.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had the Duke pronounced these words, than a cry of hatred, savage\r\nas that of the jackal, was heard in the next room.\r\n\r\n\"Save me, save me,\" said the Duchess, calling Monte-Leone to her, and\r\nsheltering herself behind his body, \"_He_ will murder me.\"\r\n\r\n\"_He?_\" said the Duke and Count together.\r\n\r\n\"Whom do you refer to?\" said Monte-Leone.\r\n\r\n\"To Stenio Salvatori, the accomplice in this tissue of crime.\"\r\n\r\nThe two noblemen rushed towards the room where the cry had been heard. A\r\ndoor leading to the stairway was open, and there was no one visible. When\r\nthey returned, the invalid giving way to so severe a shock and exertion was\r\ndying. She had only strength to repeat the request she had urged on Stenio\r\nthe day before. \"A priest, for heaven's sake, a priest, that I may repeat\r\nto God what I have said to man.\"\r\n\r\nThe door opened and an ecclesiastic appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, father, quick,\" said the Duchess. \"Tell me that God, like man, will\r\nforgive me.\"\r\n\r\nThe priest stood for a few minutes in the middle of the room, apparently\r\noverpowered by emotion. He said, \"One person must forgive you, Madame, and\r\nthat person is the individual whose life you have made miserable, whom you\r\nhave made use of to strike this innocent man;\" and he pointed to the Count.\r\n\"I, as well as the Duke, was in the adjoining room, and have heard all.\r\nThat pardon I give you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duchess said, \"Then Rovero, too, forgives me;\" before she had finished\r\nhis name, Monte-Leone clasped Taddeo in his arms.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, a funeral portage proceeded to a place of eternal rest.\r\nThree men followed a body to the grave. They were Monte-Leone, the Duke\r\nd'Harcourt, and the Abbe Rovero. Love and friendship having been both\r\nbetrayed, as he thought, Taddeo sought for consolation in religion. The\r\nDivinity, he knew, did not betray those who love him. A fugitive and an\r\noutlaw, he had sought refuge in a seminary, and subsequently had become a\r\npriest. Chance had assigned him to a church near La Felina's house, and he\r\nhad been pointed out by the Duchess's confidential servant, as a priest\r\nworthy her mistress's confidence. Heaven had accomplished the rest.\r\n\r\nAll Paris, at that time, was filled with a strange report, and with\r\namazement learned the truth in relation to Monte-Leone. A letter from the\r\nDuke d'Harcourt appeared in the journals of the day and unfolded this\r\nterrible drama. The Duke told Paris and all Europe, what he had overheard\r\nin the Duchess's boudoir.\r\n\r\nIt said, if any voice should do justice to this injured man, it is that of\r\na father who wrongfully accused him of being the death of a son. The moral\r\nreaction in favor of the Count was as sudden as the censure the world had\r\nheaped on him had been. The person who, next to Monte-Leone, enjoyed this\r\ncomplete reparation, was the adorable woman who had never doubted the honor\r\nof the man she loved.\r\n\r\nThe King sent for the Duke d'Harcourt; he understood and participated in\r\nthe grief of an unfortunate father, for he, also, had lost the heir of his\r\nthrone. When the old noble left the King he bore with him the pardon of\r\nRene's young friend, the generous Von Apsberg. The Duke went to the\r\nconciergerie, and on the Doctor, in his gratitude, asking after Marie, the\r\nformer said, \"She is a patient who will give you a great deal of trouble,\r\nboth her health and her heart being seriously affected. You will have two\r\ngrave diseases to attend to, and the husband must assist the physician.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE.\r\n\r\nA month after these events--on the first of May, that festival of sunlight,\r\nflowers, and universal rejoicings--two couples, followed by many friends\r\nand brilliant attendants, went from the small house on the banks of the\r\nSeine, to the village church of Neuilly. The Prince de Maulear, made young\r\nby happiness, had Marie d'Harcourt on his arm. The Duke escorted the\r\nMarquise, and the Count and Von Apsberg followed them. The priest stood at\r\nthe foot of the altar. This priest, who made four persons happy, but who\r\nlooked to heaven alone for his own happiness, was Taddeo Rovero.\r\n\r\nThe three fiery Carbonari gradually felt their revolutionary ardor grow\r\ndull. The reason is, these three men were now attached to the society they\r\nhad sought to destroy, by strong ties. Two were bound to it by family\r\nbonds, and the other by religion.\r\n\r\n_Carbonarism_ was not crushed in Europe, by the disasters of the French\r\nassociation. It slumbered for ten years, but awoke in 1830. The tree has\r\ngrown, and the world now gathers its bitter fruits.\r\n\r\nStenio Salvatori received in Italy the punishment due his great crimes in\r\nFrance. His vile heart became the sheath of the stiletto of one of the\r\nbrethren of the _Venta_ of CASTEL LA MARC.\r\n\r\nOur old acquaintance, Mlle. Celestine Crepinean, touched by divine grace,\r\nrepented of having made so bad a disposition of her pure and virgin love.\r\nLike Magdalen, she threw herself at the feet of her Savior, and lived to an\r\nadvanced age, greatly to the edification of the faithful as dispenser of\r\nholy water at the church of Saint THOMAS AQUINAS.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE SPY IN SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] Concluded from page 327.\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1850, by Stringer &\r\nTownsend, in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States\r\nfor the Southern District of New-York.\r\n\r\n[4] _Mansarde_ Gallice, from the inventor Mansard, uncle of another\r\narchitect of the same name of the time of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\n[5] It is one of the maxims of _magnetism_, that when once an entire\r\nsympathy between two minds is established equality ensues, and consequently\r\nneither can exert influence over the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GHOST STORY OF NORMANDY.\r\n\r\nBY THE AUTHOR OF \"HAMON AND CATAR; OR, THE TWO RACKS.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Bentley's Miscellany.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nOn a fine summer evening, in 1846, I left my house, which was in the\r\nneighborhood of Honfleur, Normandy, to take a stroll. It was July. All the\r\nmorning and all the afternoon the sun had been busily pouring down streams\r\nof radiance like streams of boiling water, and I had kept the house, and\r\nkept it closely shut up too, till the orb of day had gone some way down\r\ntowards the sea, as if, like a fire-eater, or like a locomotive, to get a\r\n_drink_ after its work.\r\n\r\nMy wife being asleep, I borrowed her parasol, for English life in France is\r\nvery free and easy, and I was rather careful of my complexion. I lit a\r\ncigar, and starting, soon left the church of St. Catharine behind. My\r\nbusiness in the town was to post a letter, which I got safely done, and\r\nthen passing down the fish-market, I found myself, ere long, at the foot of\r\nthe Cote de Grace--a steep hill which rises abruptly from the town, and is\r\nscaleable at one part by a sandy zigzag.\r\n\r\nMy cigar was a bad one altogether--a bad one to look at and a bad one to\r\nblow. Of government manufacture, it cost five sous, and was not worth one.\r\nIts skin was as thick as an ass's hide, and no persuasion would make _it_\r\ndraw. Like a false friend, it became quite hollow when I put the fire of\r\ntrial to it; and only waxed hot and oily as it burnt on. It was a French\r\nregalia, and had nothing of French royalty about it but bad _smoke_. The\r\ntobacco had, I think, lost savor, as salt used to do, in passing through\r\nthe monopolizing hands of the _Citoyen Roi_. In a word, my gorge rose at\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI stood awhile at the foot of the zigzag, endeavoring to coax it into\r\nusefulness, for I was a family man, and had given many hostages to fortune,\r\nand dared not to be extravagant. I tried to doctor it by incisions, and by\r\ngiving it draughts; but all was in vain. At last it began to unwind, and\r\nsome loose ashes found their way to my eyes. I was about to throw it away\r\nin disgust, when a young Frenchman, who had passed me a moment before with\r\na party (I knew him slightly and we had bowed), returned, and observing\r\nthat my cigar seemed troublesome, asked me to try one of his.\r\n\r\nHis name was Le Brun. We had met occasionally on the pier, where in the\r\nquiet evenings I used to take refuge from the uproar of my sanctuary at\r\nhome, and for awhile almost believed myself a lay bachelor lounging through\r\nFrance without a charming wife and eight children. He and I had succeeded\r\nwell in chit-chat. The Browns, he was fond of saying, were a numerous race\r\nin England, but if he ever settled there he would be distinguished from\r\nthem as THE Brown. He was vain of this play on his name, and I always\r\nlaughed when he produced it. I had no hesitation, therefore, when he\r\noffered me a cigar: besides, I knew that he always smoked smuggled Cubas.\r\n\r\nWe gossiped for a few moments. At length I saw him glance at my wife's\r\nparasol, which was shielding me from the sun. He _said_ nothing, but I felt\r\nmy cheek burn with a sudden sort of shame, and immediately shut it up.\r\n\r\n\"Madame will return,\" he said, \"and Monsieur attends her.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not the fact. Monsieur had to return, and Madame attended him. But\r\nthe observation was put in the narrative form, and if my friend gave me\r\ninformation which I knew to be false, I was not bound to say so. I only\r\nbowed, therefore; and he added that he was forced to join his party, and\r\nbowed too; and so we separated.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely left me, when I thought that if I had avowed my solitary\r\nstate he might have asked me to join his party, which was evidently a merry\r\none; and I internally execrated the parasol, which had been the means of\r\npreventing this. If by any accident I should meet him again, I resolved\r\nthat he should not see me with _it_, and without the lady; so I deposited\r\nit at a little lace-maker's, and soon after began to ascend the Cote de\r\nGrace, not without hopes of meeting the party as they returned, perhaps\r\nfrom Val-a-Reine.\r\n\r\nBetween each wind of the zigzag path was a flight of wooden steps, by which\r\nthe adventurous might ascend directly from the bottom of the hill. At the\r\nhead of some of these flights of steps were rustic seats; they were\r\ngenerally on the outer edge of the path, but a few were placed far back, so\r\nthat the hill immediately below was unseen.\r\n\r\nI always climbed the Cote by the steps, as I used ever and anon to lie down\r\non the green carpet which nature has spread over each of the short ascents.\r\nOn the present occasion I had not mounted far before a pleasant piece of\r\nthis turf-flooring near the top of one of the little hills seduced me from\r\nmy toils. I sat down, took Shelley's \"Revolt of Islam\" from my pocket,\r\nfinished my cigar, and in consequence of reading half a dozen stanzas from\r\nthe poem--fell asleep.\r\n\r\nI woke suddenly, and as soon as I had my faculties about me, noticed that\r\npeople were speaking, and in loud tones, close above me. Otherwise, all was\r\nstill around. There was no wind among the little trees; a bee buzzed past\r\nme now and then, and insects hummed, but further off down the hill, and\r\nthese voices sounded harsh and dissonant in the quiet air. I listened, at\r\nfirst mechanically. The conversation was carried on in French.\r\n\r\n\"It is time to end this,\" said a stern, disagreeable voice; \"and I will not\r\nwait any longer, M. Raymond.\"\r\n\r\n\"But M. Gray,\" answered another and more pleasant voice, \"you will think of\r\nmy situation--my family. I have done all I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have thought too much of your family,\" replied Gray; \"but I must also\r\nthink of myself. Esther--your daughter--she does not speak with me, for\r\nexample, as you said she should.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur!\" exclaimed the other.\r\n\r\n\"This Le Brun--she is all ears and eyes for him. She----\"\r\n\r\n\"M. Gray!\" said Raymond. His voice had been deprecating before--it was firm\r\nnow. \"You are so harsh to me; how can you expect kindness from her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir, you promised to use your influence with her----\"\r\n\r\n\"Promised, M. Gray!\" Raymond burst in. \"You did not think I should sell my\r\ndaughter for a debt of the table? I do not think, monsieur, you expected me\r\nto _sell_ my Esther, for example.\" And there was an emphasis on these last\r\nwords which only a Frenchman could give.\r\n\r\n\"I did not say you promised that,\" replied the other; \"but I am seeking for\r\nthe money you owe me. I love your daughter; you know it; she does not\r\nsmile, and I must wait. But my creditors will not wait. I owe money, and\r\ncome to you for what you owe me.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice that said this was cold and stern. Suddenly, as I listened to it,\r\nit seemed familiar to me; but where I had heard it I could not remember.\r\nRaymond replied:\r\n\r\n\"And suppose I had not played with you and lost? What would you have done?\"\r\n\r\n\"But my friends in England are so dilatory,\" was the evasive answer.\r\n\"Still--if Mademoiselle Esther----\"\r\n\r\n\"Sacre!\" cried Raymond, starting to his feet, and stamping on the path.\r\nGray seemed to rise too. \"You press me too far. What do I know of you,\r\nmonsieur? You live here some few months--you play high--you--you----\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well, monsieur,\" said Gray, icily, as he paused.\r\n\r\n\"My daughter, too,\" cried Raymond; \"you use my debt to you as a means----.\"\r\nHe stopped again in his sudden passion.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, monsieur,\" said Gray, sternly, \"this is only a debt of honor;\"\r\nand he laid a stress on the word which drove it home. \"In England we cannot\r\nenforce a debt of honor.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you do there when it is not paid?\"\r\n\r\n\"First post the guilty man, and then shoot him,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nI felt inclined to start from my concealment and say that this was false. I\r\nrecollected, however, just in time, that it was true.\r\n\r\n\"But this is folly,\" pursued Gray, \"and we should not quarrel. I am not\r\ngoing to shoot Esther's father, for example.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this cordial and peaceful declaration was instantaneous. Glad\r\napparently to drop his creditor in his friend at any price, Raymond\r\nanswered kindly, and even proposed to give Gray a small sum on account of\r\nhis debt, which he accepted. They then began to ascend the zigzag, and ere\r\nlong their voices died away in the distance.\r\n\r\nI had remained lying-to where I was all this while, and felt glad when they\r\nleft the neighborhood. I never overheard a conversation with pleasure since\r\nI read how the Rev. Dr. Follett declared that his bamboo, and not his\r\ncloth, should protect him from Mr. Eavesdrop. Once, indeed, I had thought\r\nof retiring, but put it off so long that I thought I might just as well\r\nstay out the interview.\r\n\r\nI knew Mr. Raymond by name. He was a banker, and reputed rich. He was also\r\nthought religious--for a Frenchman, even pious. He crossed himself at all\r\nthe twopenny representations of the Divine agony. He never galloped past a\r\ncrucifix, or calvaire, or burial-place. And yet he now showed himself a\r\ngambler, and apparently on the way to sell his daughter's hand to a man he\r\ndid not know, for a gambling debt. The discovery made me feel sick. And yet\r\nI thought how many of my own parisioners, who wave their heads at the\r\nsacred name in the creed, and appear to men to worship, are as false as\r\nthis man; packing away their religion like their best hat till next Sunday,\r\nwhen it seems as good to the next pew as ever.\r\n\r\nBut I felt more than an abstract discomfort at my discoveries. Le Brun's\r\nname had been mixed up with Esther Raymond's by this Gray. Now his Cuba\r\ncigar had bound me indissolubly to The Brown, and as long as he asked\r\nnothing but what cost nothing, I was his faithful well-wisher and friend.\r\nThis was the time to show my friendship; and accordingly I sprang from my\r\ncouch, put Shelley into my pocket, and resumed my ascent of the Cote.\r\n\r\nI had gained the top, and, after looking across the water to Harfleur,\r\nwhich showed well in the soft light of the westering sun, was about to\r\nwalk on, when I saw a party on the rude bench which is set on the seaward\r\nside of the top of the Cote--Le Brun with them. I looked back across the\r\nSeine, and watched the lights and shades shift on the hills of the opposite\r\nshore, collecting my thoughts the while. Ere they were collected, however,\r\nhe joined me.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! but madame is no longer with monsieur?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"No; she's at home now,\" I answered, thinking how I should best break\r\nground, and almost inclined to leave him to his own courses now that it was\r\ntime to act. Why should I meddle in these foreigners' affairs? What were\r\nthey to me? I felt thus for a moment; Le Brun produced his cigar-case, and\r\nI did not feel so for another.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you liked my cigar; it is not French,\" he said. \"Will you try\r\nanother?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will try one of mine,\" I answered, ashamed to take without giving,\r\nand forgetting that my property consisted of none but the despised French\r\narticle. The young gentleman took one of the great clown-like regalias with\r\na slight shudder, and I saw him wince as he inhaled a mouthful of its rank\r\nproduce, and, ere long, quietly drop the thing when he thought I was not\r\nlooking, and substitute one of his own.\r\n\r\nThe flavor of his Cuba opened my heart to him, and ere long I broached the\r\nsubject with which I had no earthly business.\r\n\r\n\"You know a certain M. Gray?\" I asked. He started.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said; \"that is him talking to mademoiselle. Shall I introduce\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at present--no, I thank you,\" I answered. He looked up at me.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know him?\" he asked. My eye had been bent on him for the last few\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n\"I think I do,\" I said; \"I am not sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"He came here with the Dowlasses; he is the son of an English milord, who\r\nallows him a thousand pounds a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did he leave England, then?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"He was too gay, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And left his debts unpaid, I suppose.\" He looked up at me again.\r\n\r\n\"If you do know him, or anything about him,\" he exclaimed, \"pray tell me; I\r\nam particularly anxious about him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you must be, and so ought mademoiselle to be,\" I said. He blushed\r\nlike a girl and was going to speak, but I continued: \"If he is the man I\r\nthink, never play at cards with him, M. le Brun; and, between us, separate\r\nhis hat from those pink ribbons further than they are now.\"\r\n\r\nHis curiosity, his anxiety, was thoroughly aroused; but, as he began to\r\nspeak, a lady's voice called him. It was Esther's.\r\n\r\n\"Will you join us?\" he said. In another moment I was being introduced to\r\nthe party.\r\n\r\nI was at first surprised to find Gray and his dupe smoking and chatting as\r\ngayly as any of the party. I am a good wonderer, but always reason my\r\nsurprises away. I soon did so now, reflecting that all men use their faces\r\nas masks, by which they lie without speaking falsehood. And, though I\r\ndetest hypocrisy myself, I remembered that I often smiled when I could\r\ngrind my teeth with rage--that is, if they were not false ones.\r\n\r\nLe Brun had been summoned to rejoin the circle because a curious topic had\r\nbeen started. M. Raymond was proprietor of an estate near St. Sauveur, the\r\nhouse of which was reported to be haunted, and Esther had dared Gray to\r\nspend a night there.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't believe in ghosts,\" he recommenced, after the introduction.\r\n\"It would only be to waste a night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there _is_ a goblin though,\" replied the beautiful girl--\"a male\r\nAmina; always walking into an occupied chamber, so that you're sure to see\r\nhim. He does not, however, stop to be caught napping in the morning, like\r\nLa Sonnambula.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" answered Gray. \"You've called M. le\r\nBrun\"--and he looked somewhat fiercely at my friend--\"if he'll spend a\r\nnight there, I will. I'm engaged to-night, and to-morrow night, so that he\r\ncan go first. But I can't believe in your ghost, mademoiselle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if I acknowledge to have seen him myself?\" she asked. There was a\r\ngeneral movement among the listeners. \"Well, I will accept for M. le Brun;\r\nhe shall go to-night or to-morrow, and you the night after--eh, M.\r\nFrederic?\"\r\n\r\nLe Brun murmured something about obedience to her wishes; what, I did not\r\nhear. He evidently, however, did not like the scheme, and Gray saw it; but,\r\nin the general interest for Esther's tale, no one else did.\r\n\r\nI do not give it here, for divers reasons. When she had done, it was found\r\nto be time to return. I would have left the party, but Raymond having\r\nseperated Le Brun from Esther, he joined himself to me, and I was unable to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\n\"What will Grace say?\" thought I. \"I hope she won't wait tea for me.\" I\r\nshould have been somewhat crusty if, on an ordinary occasion, I had\r\nreturned from a stroll and found that she and the rest had _not_ waited. Le\r\nBrun asked me--as M. Raymond had already done--to stay all the evening with\r\nthe party. That, however, I felt to be impossible, and said so.\r\n\r\n\"Well, for the present, then,\" he said. \"What can you tell me of M. Gray?\"\r\nhe added.\r\n\r\n\"I expect my brother here to-morrow,\" I said, \"when I will compare notes\r\nwith him. Till then I should be cautious, as I may injure an innocent man.\r\nBut do you be cautious too. How about this challenge? Shall you sleep in\r\nthe haunted house? It is romantic nonsense--this of a spirit, you know.\r\nMademoiselle has seen a clothes-horse, or a--a part of her dress in\r\nmoonlight. I don't believe in ghosts myself at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you?\" said he, somewhat sadly. \"I--the truth is, mon cher, I am\r\nafraid I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must go on now, though,\" I said, maliciously.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes--of course--go on,\" he answered; \"but, monsieur----\" he hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, my dear friend?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I thought to ask a favor of you,\" he replied. \"Will you accompany me to\r\nthis house, monsieur? I feel I ask much--but will you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much, my very dear sir!\" I exclaimed, in the fullness of my heart--\"not at\r\nall too much. I shall be happy to be of any use to you, and will sit and\r\nsmoke those cigars of yours, and let the ghosts go to old ----.\" I stopped\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\"And what,\" thought I, \"will Grace say to _that_?\" A sort of dampness\r\nrushed out upon my skin; I had forgotten her. My sentence remained\r\nunfinished, and I looked eagerly about me, as if to question the adjoining\r\nshrubs as to what on earth I was to do. My dear Grace was the light of my\r\neyes, and the joy of my heart, I'm sure; the best wife, the most amiable of\r\nthe sex, but yet she had a kind of will of her own, which was apt to get\r\ngrafted, as it were, upon mine. She never opposed me positively in any\r\nthing, but somehow, if she did not like it, it was rarely done. I had just\r\npromised what I might not be able to perform; and yet I did not like to\r\nconfess to this foreigner that my wife led me. \"A plague upon his Cubas and\r\nhim too,\" I thought. Still, what was to be done?\r\n\r\n\"If you cannot sleep there to-night,\" he said, noticing my uneasiness, \"I\r\nwill claim the night's grace----\"\r\n\r\n\"Grace!\" I exclaimed; my wife before me in the word.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she said to-night or to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, to-night?--impossible!\" I cried. \"I have a very--an engagement\r\nto-night. I can not possibly make it to-night. Besides,\" I exclaimed,\r\ngrasping at an idea like a drowner at a rope, or any thing saving,\r\n\"mademoiselle may not give leave to share your danger with any one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I asked her,\" he said--I had noticed them exchange whispers--\"and she\r\nwill----\"\r\n\r\n\"Bother!\" I muttered; but instantly continued, with a smile, \"if it is to\r\nbe so I will be at your service to-morrow. Meanwhile, let me slip away\r\nnow--that engagement, you know.\"\r\n\r\nWe were at the foot of the Cote de Grace by this time. He brought the party\r\nto a stand-still, and, after some difficulty, I was allowed to desert, Le\r\nBrun asking me to join him next day to dinner, to which I agreed. After I\r\nleft the joyous set I walked away fiercely, like a man with a purpose, till\r\nthey were out of sight; but, as I neared that sanctuary of the heart where\r\nthe tea would be waiting for me, the fierceness of my pace abated, and,\r\nwith hands in pockets and head depressed, I slackened my speed more and\r\nmore, till at last, when I reached my garden-gate, I came to a stand-still.\r\n\r\nUnhappily I am tall, and my children are all wonderfully quick. I had not\r\nstood at the gate three seconds before I was surrounded by my urchins,\r\nwhooping, and getting among my legs, and hanging to my tails, and playing\r\nthe wildest pranks off on me.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly I saw my wife leave the house and come down the garden without\r\nher bonnet to welcome me. Oh, how I wished that, just for once, she had\r\nbeen a shrew; I could have brazened out the matter then. But she smiled so\r\nsweetly at me!\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" she exclaimed, heartily, putting her hands in mine, \"you have had a\r\nsplendid afternoon for your walk! Have you enjoyed it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" I said, \"except for one thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" she asked; \"no accident I hope. You've never, surely, been\r\namong the orchards again; I'm sure the grass swarms with adders and\r\nsnakes.\" And she looked so anxiously and tenderly up into my face that I\r\nwas forced to stoop and----. But this is weakness. \"What was it? I saw you\r\ntook out that divine Shelley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered, jumping at any subject foreign to the one at my heart,\r\n\"he _is_ divine. I'll never deny it again; the very god of sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"For shame!\" she cried; \"and I saw you took something else, too. But where\r\nis it?--the parasol, I mean?\" I had forgotten it! I think I must have\r\nstarted and changed color, for she immediately proceeded: \"Never mind, it's\r\ntoo late to go into the fields for it now. It will be quite destroyed,\r\nthough, by the dew to-night--there's always so much in this weather. But,\r\nnever mind--and yet how could you forget it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's all right,\" I replied, somewhat pettishly; \"we'll get it in the\r\nmorning. I left it in a shop at the foot of the Cote de Grace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, what was the drawback to your walk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! never mind it just now,\" I exclaimed. \"Dear Grace, do let me have some\r\ntea; I'll tell you by-and-by.\" And I bustled among the children towards the\r\nhouse, she following in some surprise.\r\n\r\nAs soon as tea was over I dispatched the children into the garden and\r\nsolemnly commenced my tale. Commenced? I plunged into it heels over head,\r\nas a timid bather plunges into the pool when he is the cynosure of the eyes\r\nof all swimmers in it, and by appearing on the brink in Nature's undress\r\n_uniform_, feels himself pledged to enter the liquid. Like him, too, when\r\nonce in, I did not find the water so cold as I feared, after all. I had\r\nmade my promise so strong by constantly referring to it, that Grace never\r\neven proposed my giving it up. My brother would arrive by to-morrow's boat,\r\nand so that the house would have a guardian she would not object--for once.\r\nI inwardly vowed not to put it in her power to refuse or grant such a favor\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSo on the morrow, at the appointed time, I was comfortably seated at M. le\r\nBrun's mahogany; and while, \"for this occasion only,\" I played my old\r\n_role_ of bachelor, I loosed the hymeneal reins, and actually told some\r\nancient Cider-cellar stories--in French, too,--which produced explosion\r\nafter explosion of laughter, though whether this was caused by the tales or\r\nthe telling I cannot of course guess.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by evening came, and it was time to start. Le Brun and I hastened,\r\ntherefore, to finish the bottles then in circulation; and, as soon as that\r\nwas done, rose to walk to the haunted property. And now the skeptical\r\nblockheads who doubt every thing would say that what follows was the\r\nconsequence of our libations. Let them say what they like, I only put it to\r\n_you_, if it is likely that a thorough-going Church and State rector would\r\nbe influenced by a few bottles of _vin ordinaire_ and a mere _thought_ of\r\ncognac after all.\r\n\r\nIt was about nine o'clock when we arrived within sight of St. Sauveur. It\r\nwas a lovely night. Beyond the little village in the distance loomed the\r\nhills, rising from the Eure, over which the moon was shining brilliantly.\r\nPresently my companion turned sharply off from the main road, and we began\r\nto ascend a narrow stony lane, so thickly fringed with bushes that the\r\nlight was excluded; but ere long we came upon a cross-path nearly as\r\nnarrow, but lighted by the rays of the bright moon; this we followed, till,\r\nin a few minutes, we arrived before a gate, which we pushed open, and\r\nadvanced into a field.\r\n\r\nLe Brun paused to light a fresh cigar from the smoking ruins of the last,\r\nand, as I walked on, I suddenly became reflective. \"Your life, my dear and\r\nreverend sir,\" I ejaculated, \"has just been like this evening's walk. Your\r\nschool and college life were all bright and silvery as the highway flooded\r\nby the glorious beams, and so forth. Then came the stony lane of\r\ncurateship, and then you gained a cross-lane, stony still, but lighted by\r\nthe smiles of Grace, and the prospect of a reversion, which your father got\r\nyou cheap, because the occupant was young. And then this youthful rector\r\njoined the Church of Rome, leaving the gate open for you; and so you\r\nstepped into your twelve hundred a year, of which you only need to\r\nsacrifice seventy for a hack to do the work. So that after a somewhat\r\npleasant life you can enjoy yourself in foreign parts, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Halloa!\" cried a voice behind.\r\n\r\nI started. In a moment I remembered that I was upon haunted ground, and\r\nmotioned to fly. I am no coward, but I hate a surprise, and thought that\r\nperhaps the hero of this enchanted ground was close beside me. Le Brun's\r\nvoice, however, dissipated those fears. I had strolled from the right path\r\nin my dream, and he wished me to re-rejoin him. I did so, and we pursued\r\nour walk.\r\n\r\nWe soon arrived before the house. It was approachable at the rear by a road\r\nwhich led to St. Sauveur, after winding about the country some two or three\r\nmiles more than necessary, as French roads are apt to do: but the main\r\nentrance was from the fields, as we had come. It was a shabby place, and\r\nlooked in the staring moonlight as seedy as a bookseller's hack would look\r\nin the glare of an Almack's ball. The windows were mostly broken, and the\r\nportico, like its Greek model, was in ruins. Rude evergreens grew downward\r\nfrom the rails which had fixed them, when young, in the way they were to\r\ngo, and were sprawling about the nominal garden, which was likewise overrun\r\nby weeds and plots of grass, and fallen shrubs and flowers. The moon never\r\nlooked on a poorer spot, and yet there was an air about the tattered old\r\nhouse which seemed to indicate that it had been good-looking once; as we\r\nmay see, despite the plaster-work among the wrinkles of some of our\r\ndowagers, that they were not altogether hideous, as they now are, in the\r\ndays of the \"Greatest Gentleman\" in Europe.\r\n\r\nWe entered. It was too late and too dark in-doors to survey the mansion;\r\nso, as Le Brun had been directed to the habitable room, we struck a light,\r\nand ascended directly to it. It was handsomely furnished, and a basket\r\ncontaining that refreshment which we had looked forward to stood on the\r\ntable. The windows were whole; still I thought it well to close the\r\nshutters, as I hate Midsummer nights' draughts as much as I love the\r\n\"Midsummer Night's Dream.\" This done, I sank on a sofa; Le Brun drew some\r\nwine; we fell to at an early supper, and fared well.\r\n\r\nWhen we had finished we lighted cigars, and our conversation grew\r\nfrivolous. Le Brun was in the midst of a description of Esther, when I\r\nheard a groan, and said so. He pooh-poohed me, and, half annoyed at the\r\ninterruption, proceeded. He had not got on very far before the groan was\r\nrepeated. I started up.\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!--wind!\" said my companion, retaining his seat and emitting his\r\nsmoke.\r\n\r\n\"If so, it must be wind on the stomach, or wind in the lungs,\" I said.\r\n\"Hark!\"\r\n\r\nI heard a faint noise. We both listened intently for some minutes, I\r\nstanding. It was not repeated, however; so, growing tired, I said that I\r\nmust have been mistaken, and sat down. Le Brun agreed with me, and resumed\r\nhis description. I followed with a tale; he was reminded by it of another;\r\nand so we continued, till our repeated potations, much speaking, and the\r\nlate hour, made both of us prosy, and then we fell, as with one accord,\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nI must have slept for a considerable time, as, when I woke, I found that\r\nthe lamp had burned very low, and looked the worse for having been kept up\r\nso late. I woke with a start, caused, as I imagined, by hearing the\r\nroom-door suddenly opened. That was a sound which, as a father of a large\r\nfamily, I had got to know very well, especially about the smaller hours. I\r\nlooked towards the door, but my eyes were dim with sleep, and it was not\r\ntill Le Brun's boot was projected against my shin that I became\r\nsufficiently awake to see if my idea was correct or no. It was.\r\n\r\nNot only was the door open but a person was evidently standing on the\r\nthreshold. In the sickly light his face was not visible; nothing, in fact,\r\nbut an outline of him. I rose, and with as much steadiness of voice as I\r\ncould command, requested the visitor to come in. He made a deep bow, set\r\nhis hat modestly upon the floor, came across the room, and stood as if\r\nawaiting further orders.\r\n\r\nI had, however, none to give him. I had not sufficient impudence to bid him\r\nsit down and help himself to wine, or what he liked; but I kicked Le Brun,\r\nin payment for his attack on me, and motioned to him to do the honors. He\r\nmet the advance of my foot, however, in an unexpected way.\r\n\r\n\"Diable!\" he cried, \"Est-ce que----\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped as if a gag had been thrust between his jaws; for our visitor,\r\ndoubtless applying the epithet to himself, suddenly turned his back on us,\r\nwalked to the door, picked up his hat, and, though I cried after him, as\r\nthe Master of Ravenswood cried after his dead Lucia's ghost, to stop, paid\r\nno more heed than that virgin does to Mario, but retired quickly, his boots\r\nscreaming as he trod upon them like veritable souls in pain. We made no\r\nmotion to follow, but remained as if glued to our places, looking on each\r\nother from our semi-sleepy eyes in a somewhat foolish manner.\r\n\r\n\"He'll come back,\" said Le Brun. \"Hush!\"\r\n\r\nThe boots had stopped at the bottom of the stairs; we heard no sound.\r\n\r\n\"If he does, don't name Sathanas, for Heaven's sake,\" I said. \"He doesn't\r\nlike it. It may recall unpleasant things--seem personal, in fact----\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nWe listened. The screaming boots were remounting the stairs. The visitor\r\nhad got over the personality, and was coming back. \"What should be done? I\r\nam no coward; I've said so before; but I seriously thought of running to,\r\nshutting, fastening, and setting chairs against the door. But I did not\r\nmove. The footsteps approached, and then began to recede again. This\r\nsuspense of the interest--or, rather, dragging out of it--was most\r\ntormenting. What if he should go on walking all night? But the steps were\r\nere long heard once more coming near the room, and once more the visitor\r\nstood at the door. But he did not enter now. He looked steadfastly towards\r\nus; beckoned slowly; then, turning, began to leave us again. I drew a long,\r\nwell-satisfied breath as he disappeared and leaned back on the sofa.\r\n\r\n\"I trust he's gone for good now,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"He beckoned. We must follow,\" said Le Brun.\r\n\r\n\"Follow! Pooh, pooh!\" I exclaimed. \"Let us sit still and be glad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" was his brave response. \"Be he man, or be he----\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" I cried. \"He may hear. He doesn't like the word----\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand the impulse,\" said Le Brun; \"but we must follow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not _feel_ the impulse,\" I rejoined. \"Still, if you do, and obey it,\r\nI will not desert you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" he answered. And with quick steps we chased the vocal boots down\r\nthe corridor, and ere long saw the wearer of them, having descended the\r\nstairs, cross the hall, and wait at the door of the house.\r\n\r\nThe moon was still shining brightly, and its rays came through the broken\r\nwindows on the ground-floor, and fell on the figure of the mysterious one.\r\nHe was of middle height, and of broad and muscular build. He seemed more\r\nlike an English farmer than a French ghost. His garments were seedy, and\r\nhis hat was old; but his boots were like the boots of Thaddeus of Warsaw,\r\nthe son of Miss Porter, who was so mortally offended when asked the name of\r\nthe maker of his Bluchers, and they gleamed like boots of polished steel.\r\nAll, however, did not seem right about the stranger. His head appeared\r\nawry, and his arms out of their places. But perhaps these blemishes were\r\nattributable to the moonlight, and not to the man; for he showed that he\r\ncould turn his head and look at us, and use his arms to open the door. We\r\nfollowed him out into the air.\r\n\r\nHe led us through the field we had already traversed, but in a rather\r\ndifferent direction. The night was chilly, and the long grass damp, and I\r\nbegan to grow weary of the adventure. Suddenly, however, our conductor\r\nstopped before what appeared to be a ruined cow-shed. He looked at it\r\nearnestly for a few moments, then at us, who kept a respectful distance;\r\nthen, making an abrupt motion of his arm towards it, too rapid for us to\r\nunderstand, he seemed to me to spring into the air. Whether he did so or\r\nnot, I cannot declare; but I know that when I rubbed my eyes, and looked\r\nround about for him, he was nowhere to be seen. We examined the spot, but\r\nhe had left no traces. Boots, and hat, and all his trappery had gone with\r\nhim. He had come like a dream, and vanished like a morning dream.\r\n\r\nWe stood for a few moments uncertain what to do, and then it occurred to me\r\nthat the room we had left was warm and comfortable, and this field cold and\r\ndreary; so I proposed to return, especially as, the stranger having\r\nvanished, there did not appear to be any business in hand. Le Brun agreed,\r\nand we did so, and, after talking awhile over our adventure, went to sleep\r\nover our talk; and I did not wake again till morning was staring into the\r\nchamber, as Le Brun threw open the shutters.\r\n\r\nThe conversation that took place is as well to be imagined as transcribed.\r\nEnough to say that I determined to have no share in Le Brun's narrative,\r\nbut left him to heighten it for himself. I parted with him at my house,\r\nwhere I found Grace looking out for me; and he promised to return in the\r\ncourse of the morning to pay his respects to her.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, however, when he came, he asked me for five minutes'\r\nconversation, and we went together into the field belonging to my house,\r\nwhich sloped down to the Seine. His countenance was _both_ joyous and\r\nanxious, and I saw that he had something heavier on his mind than last\r\nnight's frolic.\r\n\r\n\"I have spoken to you of M. Gray,\" he said, \"and of Mademoiselle Raymond. I\r\nhave learnt this morning that M. Gray has her father in his power.\"\r\n\r\n\"You learnt that from her?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe blushed and did not answer.\r\n\r\nI went on. I had compared notes with my brother about this Gray, and found\r\nmy suspicions correct. I therefore told Le Brun what I had overheard on the\r\nzigzag, and he in reply told me that Raymond had accepted a bill for the\r\namount of the debt to Gray.\r\n\r\n\"That's serious,\" I said. \"But before we say more, monsieur, are you\r\nengaged to Mademoiselle Esther?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\"Can you live--excuse the question--with her without dowry?\"\r\n\r\nHe replied in the affirmative again.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" I said, \"though it may sound oddly from one of my cloth, you must\r\neither elope with her----\"\r\n\r\n\"But then M. Raymond?--But his family?\"\r\n\r\n\"He must suffer for his folly; not you. And you are only going to marry one\r\ndaughter, not all of them. The other alternative is--you must pay Raymond's\r\nacceptance, as he cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be ruin. I cannot, either,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then you must lose Esther.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not. No. And yet if I was to shoot Gray----\"\r\n\r\n\"Shoot?\" I interrupted, with the virtuous horror of a man who has never\r\nbeen tempted to fight a duel--\"and would you then outrage the laws of\r\ndivine and human?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it wouldn't do to shoot him,\" he pursued. \"But oh, monsieur, can you\r\nnot suggest something to help me--to help us?\"\r\n\r\nA thought suddenly came into my head. \"Gray is pledged to spend to-night in\r\nthe haunted house, is he not?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe answered that it was so.\r\n\r\n\"I believe the man to be an arrant coward,\" I went on. \"To be sure, he shot\r\na dear friend of mine in a duel, and behaved, as the world says, like a\r\nbrave man before his witnesses. But he's a coward for all that, and we'll\r\ntest it. I don't believe in our friend the Goblin Farmer; I don't believe\r\nwe saw any body, or any spirit last night at all. Well, never mind beliefs;\r\ndon't interrupt me. I think our eyes were made the fools of other senses,\r\nand that there's no such thing. Gray has to spend the night there--we'll go\r\nagain to-night, that is, if my wife will let me, and perhaps get my brother\r\nto help us--eh? Suppose we give him a lesson.\" And I laughed.\r\n\r\nHe laughed too; and after a few more observations, he accompanied me into\r\nmy drawing-room. Grace and James, with his wife Emma, were sitting talking\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nI have said that I am a lazy rector. During my curatehood, however, I had\r\nlearned to preach sufficiently well for the parish where I worked. To be\r\nsure my congregation was neither large or wakeful, except in winter, when\r\nthe church was like a Wenham ice depot, and people could not sleep. But I\r\nwas brief, and no faults were ever found in my time with brevity. My\r\nexperience in exposition and appeal now stood me in good stead.\r\n\r\nI introduced Le Brun, and then plunged into matters. I gave a brief account\r\nof Esther and her father. I eulogized Le Brun. After that I spoke of Gray,\r\nand reminded James of the life and times--the death, too, of John Finnis,\r\nwhom he saved from being plucked alive in St. James's, only that he might\r\nbe shot in Hampstead. These dispatched, I opened my plans, which were\r\nlistened to with great interest; the only alteration proposed was that\r\nJames should go to find the authorities (if there were any, which he\r\ndoubted), and give notice of Gray's character to them; after which he was\r\nto return to my house, and stay there till Le Brun and I came back from our\r\nnocturnal expedition, as Grace and Emma feared to be left alone. Poor Emma,\r\nindeed, declared that this was the most romantic thing she had ever heard\r\nof, except one which happened in the village where she was born; but as\r\nneither James or I liked to hear her speak of her origin, we cut her\r\nnarrative short.\r\n\r\nThe cresset moon was up in heaven--at least, Emma said it was--when we\r\nstarted. It seemed to me nearly full; but she was poetical. I told her that\r\nif it was a cresset, it was tilting up, and ought, therefore, to be pouring\r\nout oil, and not light, on the earth. We started, I repeat, and a short\r\ntime after, in the language of a favorite novelist, two travellers might\r\nhave been seen slowly wending on their way, bundle in hand, towards the\r\nhaunted house.\r\n\r\nIn another hour or so, when the wind had sunk into repose, and the birds\r\nhad ceased their songs, and all things save the ever-watching stars were\r\nsleeping (as that favorite historian might go on, if he were telling this\r\ntale and not I), a tall and ecclesiastical form crept slowly from a place\r\nof concealment near the house, approached it, and gently knocked at the\r\ndoor. It was opened, and he entered cautiously. A few whispered sentences\r\npassed with some friend within, which being over, he proceeded, though with\r\nsome hesitation, to mount the stairs and pace along the corridor.\r\n\r\nMy boots (for I was the ecclesiastic) creaked and crackled like mad boots.\r\nOnward I went, like the Ghost in Hamlet, only with very vocal buskins. I\r\nreached Gray's room and opened the door. A strange sight met my eyes\r\nthrough the green glass goggles which I wore over them.\r\n\r\nGray was pacing up and down, in evident fear. A quantity of half-burnt\r\ncigars, some bottles of wine, glasses, the lamp, and, above all, two\r\npistols were on the table. As I opened the door, and the light fell on me,\r\nI feared that I should be discovered. But the gambler was afraid--and fear\r\nhas no eyes. I advanced into the room, and solemnly waved to him to follow.\r\nHe must have caught up a pistol ere he did so. I led the way.\r\n\r\nIt was my determination to lead him a long chase, and leave him in a ditch\r\nif possible, Le Brun being near at hand to cudgel him. He had readily\r\nunderstood my pantomime (I studied under Jones the player when in training\r\nfor orders), for I found he followed me, though at a distance.\r\n\r\nBut all my plans were disconcerted. As I reached the stair-head I heard a\r\nnoise, and stopped; so did Gray. It was as of some one forcing the house\r\ndoor. Directly afterwards I heard the loud cries of the real goblin's\r\nboots, and the sound of Le Brun in swift pursuit.\r\n\r\n\"Take care, monsieur,\" he cried up the stairs to me.\r\n\r\n\"By heaven they are robbers--murderers! Help! help!\" roared Gray from\r\nbehind; and as the real apparition came gliding up, he fired his pistol at\r\nit. The unexpected sound of the weapon, so close to my ear, too, stunned me\r\nfor a moment; but I recovered myself directly, and flung myself on him, in\r\nfear lest he had his second pistol, too, and might fire at _me_. The real\r\ngoblin continued to advance, and I felt Gray tremble with terror in my arms\r\nas _it_ survived the shot.\r\n\r\nAn unwonted boldness came over me. I felt myself committed to be brave.\r\n\r\n\"Villain!\" I muttered in his ear, \"you would swindle my descendant out of\r\nall he has?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--forgive me. I will not take a sou.\"\r\n\r\n\"His acceptance--where is it? Give it me.\" He shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"I will give it to you,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI released him, and followed to the lamp-lighted chamber. The other\r\napparition creaked after him, too, and at the door I gave it the\r\nprecedence. It was well I did so. The sudden light seemed to make Gray\r\nbold, for snatching up the other pistol he levelled it at the Simon Pure,\r\nand before I could utter a word, fired. The shot must have passed clean\r\nthrough the breast of the Mysterious Stranger--he only bowed.\r\n\r\nGray was now in mortal fear.\r\n\r\n\"Give up that bill,\" I said in solemn, pedal tones. He drew it frantically\r\nfrom his pocket, and, leaping up, gave it to the mysterious one.\r\n\r\n\"Go to th----\" he began, with a sort of ferocious recklessness. The next\r\nmoment he was sprawling on the floor. The Goblin reached out his hand, and\r\nstruck Gray, as it seemed, lightly with it. I would have raised him. I\r\nmotioned to do so; but my original touched me on the shoulder, handed me\r\nthe bill, and motioned to me to follow. I did not like his notes of\r\nhand--his signature by mark on Gray's face--I therefore at once obeyed. Le\r\nBrun had vanished.\r\n\r\nThe stranger led me by the old route till we were again close to the\r\ntottering cow-house. Here he paused, as on the last occasion, and was,\r\nperhaps, preparing to disappear again.\r\n\r\n\"One moment, sir,\" I said. \"Be good enough to explain yourself more plainly\r\nthan you did last night. However much I may admire your acting, and it has\r\n_beaucoup de l'Esprit_ about it, family arrangements will prevent me from\r\nagain assisting----\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded as though he quite understood me, advanced to the side of the\r\nshed, stopped under a sort of window, and then, deliberately sitting down\r\non the grass, began to pull off his boots. I gazed at him in amazement, and\r\nwas about to address him again, when a little cloud sailed across the moon,\r\nand for a moment shaded all the place. As it passed away, and I looked to\r\nour mysterious visitant and my mysterious Original, no remains of him were\r\nto be seen--except the boots.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Le Brun joined me. I was the first (as before and as ever)\r\nto throw aside my natural fears, and I advanced to the spot. There were two\r\nhighly polished Bluchers, side by side, as if they waited till the occupant\r\nof the cow-house was out of bed and shaved. I took one of them up.\r\nSomething inside chinked. I reversed it, and three Napoleons fell upon the\r\nturf.\r\n\r\nI was wondering why a French farmer-ghost should choose a Blucher to\r\ndeliver Napoleons into an Englishman's hands, when Le Brun, finding nothing\r\nin the other boot, suggested that it would be well to get Gray out of the\r\nneighborhood, and perhaps the three Napoleons might be useful to him. To\r\nthis I agreed at once, though I was somewhat dissatisfied with the little\r\nfellow for the small share he had taken in the risks of the evening.\r\n\r\nI went to the room where the gambler was; he was evidently in mortal fear.\r\nI put down the Napoleons on the table, and then in those deep, pedal, and\r\necclesiastical notes, which have so often hymned my congregation to repose,\r\ninformed him that friends of John Finnis were in the town, that he was\r\nproclaimed to the authorities, and that he had better leave the\r\nneighborhood for ever. With this I left him, joined Le Brun, and was soon\r\non my way back to Honfleur.\r\n\r\n\"It was well I drew the shot from his pistols,\" said Le Brun, as we were\r\nparting. I did not then see any latent meaning in his words, nor would he\r\never afterwards answer any questions on the subject. I had forgotten to\r\nremove my ghostly dresses and decorations, and Grace and Emma both uttered\r\ngentle screams as I stalked into their presence. My tale was soon told, and\r\nwe retired to rest.\r\n\r\nHere the whole tale ends. As the events I recorded recede into the past, I\r\nbegin almost to doubt the truth of them. But I have one living\r\nevidence--now I am glad to say not single--and Le Brun may fairly lay it to\r\nme that he has at this moment the most agreeable little lady in all\r\nNormandy for his wedded wife. I am not aware if Boots still visits the\r\nglimpses of the moon at St. Sauveur, for soon after these events I was\r\nobliged to return to my parish to put down the Popish fooleries which I\r\nfound my hack had begun to introduce. If, however, he does, I only hope his\r\nreappearance will be as useful as in the above little narrative, but the\r\nBrown, the Gray--and the narrator have now done with him for ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCREBILLON, THE FRENCH AESCHYLUS.\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1670, there lived at Dijon a certain notary, an original in\r\nhis way, named Melchior Jolyot. His father was an innkeeper; but of a more\r\nambitious nature than his sire, the son, so soon as he had succeeded in\r\ncollecting a little money, purchased for himself the office of head clerk\r\nin the Chambres des Comptes of Dijon, with the title of Greffier of the\r\nsame. During the following year, having long been desirous of a title of\r\nnobility, he acquired, at a very low price, a little abandoned and almost\r\nunknown fief, that of Crebillon, situated about a league and a half from\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nHis son, Prosper Jolyot, the future poet, was at that time a young man of\r\nabout two-and-twenty years of age, a student at law, and then on the eve of\r\nbeing admitted as advocate at the French bar. From the first years of his\r\nsojourn in Paris, we find that he called himself Prosper Jolyot _de\r\nCrebillon_. About sixty years later, a worthy philosopher of Dijon, a\r\ncertain Monsieur J. B. Michault, writes as follows to the President de\r\nRuffey:--\"Last Saturday (June 19th, 1762), our celebrated Crebillon was\r\ninterred at St. Gervais. In his _billets de mort_ they gave him the title\r\nof _ecuyer_; but what appears to me more surprising, is the circumstance of\r\nhis son adopting that of _messire_.\"\r\n\r\nCrebillon had then ended by cradling himself in a sort of imaginary\r\nnobility. In 1761, we find him writing to the President de Brosse: \"I have\r\never taken so little thought respecting my own origin, that I have\r\nneglected certain very flattering elucidations on this point. M. de Ricard,\r\nmaitre des comptes at Dijon, gave my father one day two titles he had\r\nfound. Of these two titles, written in very indifferent Latin, the first\r\nconcerned one Jolyot, chamberlain of Raoul, Duke of Burgundy; the second, a\r\ncertain Jolyot, chamberlain of Philippe le Bon. Both of these titles are\r\nlost. I can also remember having heard it said in my youth by some old\r\ninhabitants of Nuits, my father's native place, that there formerly existed\r\nin those cantons a certain very powerful and noble family, named Jolyot.\"\r\n\r\nO vanity of vanities! would it be believed that, under the democratic reign\r\nof the Encyclopoedia, a man like Crebillon, ennobled by his own talents\r\nand genius, could have thus hugged himself in the possession of a vain and\r\ndeceitful chimera! For truth compels us to own that, from the fifteenth to\r\nthe end of the seventeenth century, the Jolyots were never any thing more\r\nor less than honest innkeepers, who sold their wine unadulterated, as it\r\nwas procured from the black or golden grapes of the Burgundy hills.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Crebillon, finding that his titles of nobility were uncontested,\r\npushed his aristocratic weakness so far as to affirm one day that his\r\nfamily bore on its shield an eagle, or, on a field, azure, holding in its\r\nbeak a lily, proper, leaved and sustained, argent. All went, however,\r\naccording to his wishes; his son allied himself by an unexpected marriage\r\nto one of the first families of England. The old tragic poet could then\r\npass into the other world with the consoling reflection that he left behind\r\nhim here below a name not only honored in the world of letters, but\r\ninscribed also in the golden muster-roll of the French nobility. But\r\nunfortunately for poor Crebillon's family tree, about a century after the\r\ncreation of this mushroom nobility--which, like the majority of the\r\nnobilities of the eighteenth century, had its foundation in the sand--a\r\ncertain officious antiquary, who happened at the time to have nothing\r\nbetter to do, bethought himself one day of inquiring into the validity of\r\nhis claim. He devoted to this strange occupation several years of precious\r\ntime. By dint of shaking the dust from off the archives of Dijon and\r\nNuits, and of rummaging the minutes of the notaries of the department, he\r\nsucceeded at length in ferreting out the genealogical tree of the Jolyot\r\nfamily. Some, the most glorious of its members, had been notaries, others\r\nhad been innkeepers. Shade of Crebillon, pardon this impious archaeologist,\r\nwho thus, with ruthless hands, destroyed \"at one fell swoop\" the brilliant\r\nscaffolding of your vanity!\r\n\r\nProsper Jolyot de Crebillon was born at Dijon, on the 13th of February,\r\n1674; like Corneille, Bossuet, and Voltaire, he studied at the Jesuits'\r\ncollege of his native town. It is well known that in all their seminaries,\r\nthe Jesuits kept secret registers, wherein they inscribed, under the name\r\nof each pupil, certain notes in Latin upon his intellect and character. It\r\nwas the Abbe d'Olivet who, it is said, inscribed the note referring to\r\nCrebillon:--\"_Puer ingeniosus sed insignis nebulo._\" But it must be said\r\nthat the collegiate establishments of the holy brotherhood housed certain\r\npedagogues, who abused their right of pronouncing judgment on the scholars.\r\nCrebillon, after all, was but a lively, frolicksome child, free and\r\nunreserved to excess in manners and speech.\r\n\r\nHis father, notary and later _greffier en chef_ of the \"Chambre des\r\nComptes\" at Dijon, being above all things desirous that his family should\r\nbecome distinguished in the magistracy, destined his son to the law, saying\r\nthat the best heritage he could leave him was his own example. Crebillon\r\nresigned himself to his father's wishes with a very good grace, and\r\nrepaired to Paris, there to keep his terms. In the capital, he divided his\r\ntime between study and the pleasures and amusements natural to his age. As\r\nsoon as he was admitted as advocate, he entered the chambers of a procureur\r\nnamed Prieur, son of the Prieur celebrated by Scarron, an intimate friend\r\nof his father, who greeted him fraternally. One would have supposed that\r\nour future poet, who bore audacity on his countenance, and genius on his\r\nbrow, would, like Achilles, have recognized his sex when they showed him\r\narms; but far from this being the case, not only was it necessary to warn\r\nhim that he _was_ a poet, but even to impel him bodily, as it were, and\r\ndespite himself, into the arena.\r\n\r\nThe writers and poets of France have ever railed in good set terms against\r\nprocureurs, advocates, and all such common-place, every-day personages; and\r\nin general, we are bound to confess they have had right on their side. We\r\nmust, however, render justice to one of them, the only one, perhaps, who\r\never showed a taste for poetry. The worthy man to whom, fortunately for\r\nhimself, Crebillon had been confided, remarked at an early stage of their\r\nacquaintanceship, the romantic disposition of his pupil. Of the same\r\ncountry as Piron and Rameau, Crebillon possessed, like them, the same frank\r\ngayety and good-tempered heedlessness of character, which betrayed his\r\nBurgundian origin. Having at an early age inhaled the intoxicating perfumes\r\nof the Burgundian wines, his first essays in poetry were, as might be\r\nexpected, certain _chansons a boire_, none of which, however, have\r\ndescended to posterity. The worthy procureur, amazed at the degree of power\r\nshown even in these slight drinking-songs, earnestly advised him to become\r\na poet by profession.\r\n\r\nCrebillon was then twenty-seven years of age; he resisted, alleging that he\r\ndid not believe he possessed the true creative genius; that every poet is\r\nin some sort a species of deity, holding chaos in one hand, and light and\r\nlife in the other; and that, for his part, he possessed but a bad pen,\r\ndestined to defend bad causes in worse style. But the procureur was not to\r\nbe convinced; he had discovered that a spark of the creative fire already\r\nshone in the breast of Crebillon. \"Do not deny yourself becoming a poet,\"\r\nhe would frequently say to him; \"it is written upon your brow; your looks\r\nhave told me so a thousand times. There is but one man in all France\r\ncapable of taking up the mantle of Racine, and that man is yourself.\"\r\n\r\nCrebillon exclaimed against this opinion; but having been left alone for a\r\nfew hours to transcribe a parliamentary petition, he recalled to mind the\r\nmagic of the stage--the scenery, the speeches, the applause; a moment of\r\ninspiration seized him. When the procureur returned, his pupil extended his\r\nhand to him, exclaiming, enthusiastically, \"You have pointed out the way\r\nfor me, and I shall depart.\" \"Do not be in a hurry,\" replied the procureur;\r\n\"a _chef d'oeuvre_ is not made in a week. Remain quietly where you are,\r\nas if you were still a procureur's clerk; eat my bread and drink my wine;\r\nwhen you have completed your work, you may then take your flight.\"\r\n\r\nCrebillon accordingly remained in the procureur's office, and at the very\r\ndesk on which he transcribed petitions, he composed the five long acts of a\r\nbarbarous tragedy, entitled, \"The Death of Brutus.\" The work finished, our\r\ngood-natured procureur brought all his interest into play, in order to\r\nobtain a reading of the piece at the Comedie Francaise. After many\r\napplications, Crebillon was permitted to read his play: it was unanimously\r\nrejected. The poet was furious; he returned home to the procureur's, and\r\ncasting down his manuscript at the good man's feet, exclaimed, in a voice\r\nof despair, \"You have dishonored me!\"\r\n\r\nD'Alembert says, \"Crebillon's fury burst upon the procureur's head; he\r\nregarded him almost in the light of an enemy who had advised him only for\r\nhis own dishonor, swore to listen to him no more, and never to write\r\nanother line of verse so long as he lived.\"\r\n\r\nCrebillon, however, in his rage maligned the worthy procureur; he would not\r\nhave found elsewhere so hospitable a roof or as true a friend. He returned\r\nto the study of the law, but the decisive step had been taken; beneath the\r\nadvocate's gown the poet had already peeped forth. And then, the procureur\r\nwas never tired of predicting future triumphs. Crebillon ventured upon\r\nanother tragedy, and chose for his subject the story of the Cretan king,\r\nIdomeneus. This time the comedians accepted his piece, and shortly\r\nafterwards played it. Its success was doubtful, but the author fancied he\r\nhad received sufficient encouragement to continue his new career.\r\n\r\nIn his next piece, \"Atree,\" Crebillon, who had commenced as a school-boy,\r\nnow raised himself, as it were, to the dignity of a master. The comedians\r\nlearned their parts with enthusiasm. On the morning of the first\r\nrepresentation, the procureur summoned the young poet to his bedside, for\r\nhe was then stricken with a mortal disease: \"My friend,\" said he, \"I have a\r\npresentiment that this very evening you will be greeted by the critics of\r\nthe nation as a son of the great Corneille. There are but a few days of\r\nlife remaining for me; I have no longer strength to walk, but be assured\r\nthat I shall be at my post this evening, in the pit of the Theatre\r\nFrancaise.\" True to his word, the good old man had himself carried to the\r\ntheatre. The intelligent judges applauded certain passages of the tragedy,\r\nin which wonderful power, as well as many startling beauties, were\r\nperceptible; but at the catastrophe, when Atreus compels Thyestes to drink\r\nthe blood of his son, there was a general exclamation of horror--(Gabrielle\r\nde Vergy, be it remarked, had not then eaten on the stage the heart of her\r\nlover). \"The procureur,\" says D'Alembert, \"would have left the theatre in\r\nsorrow, if he had awaited the judgment of the audience in order to fix his\r\nown. The pit appeared more terrified than interested; it beheld the curtain\r\nfall without uttering a sound either of approval or condemnation, and\r\ndispersed in that solemn and ominous silence which bodes no good for the\r\nfuture welfare of the piece. But the procureur judged better than the\r\npublic, or rather, he anticipated its future judgment. The play over, he\r\nproceeded to the green-room to seek his pupil, who, still in a state of the\r\ngreatest uncertainty as to his fate, was already almost resigned to a\r\nfailure; he embraced Crebillon in a transport of admiration: 'I die\r\ncontent,' said he. 'I have made you a poet; and I leave a man to the\r\nnation!'\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, at each representation of the piece, the public discovered\r\nfresh beauties, and abandoned itself with real pleasure to the terror which\r\nthe poet inspired. A few days afterwards, the name of Crebillon became\r\ncelebrated throughout Paris and the provinces, and all imagined that the\r\nspirit of the great Corneille had indeed revisited earth to animate the\r\nmuse of the young Burgundian.\r\n\r\nCrebillon's father was greatly irritated on finding that his son had, as\r\nthey said then, abandoned Themis for Melpomene. In vain did the procureur\r\nplead his pupil's cause--in vain did Crebillon address to this true father\r\na supplication in verse, to obtain pardon for him from his sire; the\r\n_greffier en chef_ of Dijon was inexorable; to his son's entreaties he\r\nreplied that he cursed him, and that he was about to make a new will. To\r\ncomplete, as it were, his downfall in the good opinion of this individual,\r\nwho possessed such a blind infatuation for the law, Crebillon wrote him a\r\nletter, in which the following passage occurs: \"I am about to get married,\r\nif you have no objection, to the most beautiful girl in Paris; you may\r\nbelieve me, sir, upon this point, for her beauty is all that she\r\npossesses.\"\r\n\r\nTo this his father replied: \"Sir, your tragedies are not to my taste, your\r\nchildren will not be mine; commit as many follies as you please, I shall\r\nconsole myself with the reflection that I refused my consent to your\r\nmarriage; and I would strongly advise you, sir, to depend more than ever on\r\nyour pieces for support, for you are no longer a member of my family.\"\r\n\r\nCrebillon, for all that, married, as he said, the most beautiful girl in\r\nParis--the gentle and charming Charlotte Peaget, of whom Dufresny has\r\nspoken. She was the daughter of an apothecary, and it was while frequenting\r\nher father's shop that Crebillon became acquainted with her. There was\r\nnothing very romantic, it is true, in the match; but love spreads a charm\r\nover all that it comes in contact with. Thus, a short time before his\r\nmarriage, Crebillon perceived his intended giving out some marshmallow and\r\nviolets to a sick customer: \"My dear Charlotte,\" said he, \"we will go\r\ntogether, some of these days, among our Dijonnaise mountains, to collect\r\nviolets and marshmallows for your father.\"\r\n\r\nIt was shortly after his marriage and removal to the Place Maubert, that he\r\nfirst evinced his strange mania for cats and dogs, and, above all, his\r\nsingular passion for tobacco. He was, beyond contradiction, the greatest\r\nsmoker of his day. It has been stated by some of the writers of the time,\r\nthat he could not turn a single rhyme of a tragedy, save in an obscure and\r\nsmoky chamber, surrounded by a noisy pack of dogs and cats; according to\r\nthe same authorities, he would very frequently, also, in the middle of the\r\nday, close the shutters, and light candles. A thousand other extravagances\r\nhave been attributed to Crebillon; but we ought to accept with caution the\r\nrecitals of these anecdote-mongers, who were far too apt to imagine they\r\nwere portraying a man, when in reality they were but drawing a ridiculous\r\ncaricature.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Melchior Jolyot learned that his son had, in defiance of his\r\npaternal prohibition, actually wedded the apothecary's daughter, his grief\r\nand rage knew no bounds. The worthy man believed in his recent nobility as\r\nfirmly as he did in his religion, and his son's _mesalliance_ nearly drove\r\nhim to despair: this time he actually carried his threat into execution,\r\nand made a formal will, by virtue of which he completely disinherited the\r\npoet.--Fortunately for Crebillon, his father, before bidding adieu to the\r\nworld and his nobility, undertook a journey to Paris, curious, even in the\r\nmidst of his rage, to judge for himself the merits and demerits of the\r\ntheatrical tomfooleries, as he called them, of his silly boy, who had\r\nmarried the apothecary's daughter, and who, in place of gaining nobility\r\nand station in a procureur's office, had written a parcel of trash for\r\nactors to spout. We must say, however, that Crebillon could not have\r\nretained a better counsel to urge his claims before the paternal tribunal\r\nthan his wife, the much maligned apothecary's daughter, one of the\r\nloveliest and most amiable women in Paris; and we may add, that this\r\nnobility of which his father thought so much--the nobility of the\r\nrobe--which had not been acquired in a Dijonnaise family until after the\r\nlapse of three generations, was scarcely equal to the nobility of the pen,\r\nwhich Crebillon had acquired by the exercise of his own talents.\r\n\r\nThe old greffier, then, came to Paris for the purpose of witnessing one of\r\nthe sad tomfooleries of that unhappy profligate, who in better times had\r\nbeen his son. Fate so willed it that on that night \"Atree\" should be\r\nperformed. The old man was seized with mingled emotions of terror, grief,\r\nand admiration. That very evening, being resolved not to rest until he had\r\nseen his son, he called a coach on leaving the theatre, and drove straight\r\nto the Faubourg Saint Marceau, to the house which had been pointed out to\r\nhim as the dwelling of Crebillon. No sooner had the doors opened than out\r\nrushed seven or eight dogs, who cast themselves upon the old greffier,\r\nuttering in every species of canine _patois_ the loudest possible\r\ndemonstrations of welcome. One word from Madame Crebillon, however, was\r\nsufficient to recall this unruly pack to order; yet the dogs, having no\r\ndoubt instinctively discovered a family likeness, continued to gambol round\r\nthe limbs of M. Melchior Jolyot, to the latter's no small confusion and\r\nalarm. Charlotte, who was alone, waiting supper for her husband, was much\r\nsurprised at this unexpected visit. At first she imagined that it was some\r\ngreat personage who had come to offer the poet his patronage and\r\nprotection; but after looking at her visitor two or three times, she\r\nsuddenly exclaimed: \"You are my husband's father, or at least you are one\r\nof the Jolyot family.\" The old greffier, though intending to have\r\nmaintained his incognito until his son's return, could no longer resist the\r\ndesire of abandoning himself to the delights of a reconciliation; he\r\nembraced his daughter-in-law tenderly, shedding tears of joy, and accusing\r\nhimself all the while for his previous unnatural harshness: \"Yes, yes,\"\r\ncried he, \"yes, you are still my children--all that I have is yours!\" then,\r\nafter a moment's silence, he continued, in a tone of sadness: \"But how does\r\nit happen that, with his great success, my son has condemned his wife to\r\nsuch a home and such a supper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Condemned, did you say?\" murmured Charlotte; \"do not deceive yourself, we\r\nare quite happy here;\" so saying she took her father-in-law by the hand,\r\nand led him into the adjoining room, to a cradle covered with white\r\ncurtains. \"Look!\" said she, turning back the curtains with maternal\r\nsolicitude.\r\n\r\nThe old man's heart melted outright at the sight of his grandchild.\r\n\r\n\"Are we not happy?\" continued the mother. \"What more do we require? We live\r\non a little, and when we have no money, my father assists us.\"\r\n\r\nThey returned to the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\"What wine is this?\" said the old Burgundian, uncorking the bottle intended\r\nto form part of their frugal repast. \"What!\" he exclaimed, \"my son fallen\r\nso low as this! The Crebillons have always drunk good wine.\"\r\n\r\nAt this instant, the dogs set up a tremendous barking: Crebillon was\r\nascending the stairs. A few moments afterwards he entered the room escorted\r\nby a couple of dogs, which had followed him from the theatre.\r\n\r\n\"What! two more!\" exclaimed the father; \"this is really too much. Son,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"I am come to entreat your pardon; in my anxiety to show myself\r\nyour father, I had forgotten that my first duty was to love you.\"\r\n\r\nCrebillon cast himself into his father's arms.\r\n\r\n\"But _parbleu_, Monsieur,\" continued the old notary, \"I cannot forgive you\r\nfor having so many dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, father; but what would become of these poor animals were I\r\nnot to take compassion upon them? It is not good for man to be alone, says\r\nthe Scripture. No longer able to live with my fellow-creatures, I have\r\nsurrounded myself with dogs. The dog is the solace and friend of the\r\nsolitary man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I should imagine you were not alone here,\" said the father, with a\r\nglance towards Charlotte, and the infant's cradle.\r\n\r\n\"Who knows?\" said the young wife, with an expression of touching melancholy\r\nin her voice. \"It is perhaps through a presentiment that he speaks thus. I\r\nmuch fear that I shall not live long. He has but one friend upon the earth,\r\nand that friend is myself. Now, when I shall be no more----\"\r\n\r\n\"But you shall not die,\" interrupted Crebillon, taking her in his arms.\r\n\"Could I exist without you?\"\r\n\r\nMadame Crebillon was not deceived in her presentiments: the poet, who, we\r\nknow, lived to a patriarchal age, lived on in widowed solitude for upwards\r\nof fifty years.\r\n\r\nCrebillon and his wife accompanied the old greffier back from Paris to\r\nDijon, where, to the great surprise of the inhabitants, the father\r\npresented his son as \"M. Jolyot de Crebillon, who has succeeded Messieurs\r\nCorneille and Racine in the honors of the French stage.\" Crebillon had the\r\ngreatest possible difficulty in restraining the enthusiasm of his sire. He\r\nsucceeded, however, at length, not through remonstrance, but by the\r\ninsatiable ardor he displayed in diving into the paternal money-bags. After\r\na sojourn of three months at Dijon, Crebillon returned to Paris; and well\r\nfor him it was that he did so; a month longer, and the father would\r\nindubitably have quarrelled with him again, and would have remade his will,\r\ndisinheriting this time, not the rebellious child, but the prodigal son.\r\nCrebillon, in fact, never possessed the art of keeping his money; and in\r\nthis respect he but followed the example of all those who, in imagination,\r\nremove mountains of gold.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he arrived in Paris when he was obliged to return to Dijon.\r\nThe old greffier had died suddenly. The inheritance was a most difficult\r\none to unravel. \"I have come here,\" writes Crebillon to the elder of the\r\nbrothers Paris, \"only to inherit law-suits.\" And, true enough, he allowed\r\nhimself to be drawn blindly into the various suits which arose in\r\nconsequence of certain informalities in the old man's will, and which\r\neventually caused almost the entire property to drop, bit by bit, into the\r\npockets of the lawyers.\r\n\r\n\"I was a great blockhead,\" wrote Crebillon later; \"I went about reciting\r\npassages from my tragedies to these lawyers, who feigned to pale with\r\nadmiration; and this manoeuvre of theirs blinded me; I perceived not that\r\nall the while these cunning foxes were devouring my substance; but it is\r\nthe fate of poets to be ever like La Fontaine's crow.\"\r\n\r\nOut of this property he succeeded only in preserving the little fief of\r\nCrebillon, the income derived from which he gave up to his sisters. On his\r\nreturn to Paris, however, he changed altogether his style of living; he\r\nremoved his penates to the neighborhood of the Luxembourg, and placed his\r\nestablishment on quite a seignorial footing, as if he had become heir to a\r\nconsiderable property. This act of folly can scarcely be explained. The\r\nreport, of course, was spread, that he had inherited property to a large\r\namount. Most probably he wished, by acting thus, to save the family honor,\r\nor, to speak more correctly, the family vanity, by seeking to deceive the\r\nworld as to the precise amount of the Jolyot estate.\r\n\r\nTrue wisdom inhabits not the world in which we dwell. Crebillon sought all\r\nthe superfluities of luxury. In vain did his wife endeavor to restrain him\r\nin his extravagances; in vain did she recal to his mind their frugal but\r\nhappy meals, and the homely furniture of their little dwelling in the Place\r\nMaubert; \"_so gay for all that on sunny days_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he would reply, \"if we must return there, I shall not complain.\r\nWhat matters if the wine be not so good, so that it is always your hand\r\nwhich pours it out.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately, that year was one of successive triumphs for Crebillon. The\r\n\"Electre\" carried off all suffrages, and astonished even criticism itself.\r\nIn this piece the poet had softened down the harshness of his tints, and\r\nwhile still maintaining his \"majestic\" character, had kept closer to nature\r\nand humanity.\r\n\r\n\"Electre\" was followed by \"Rhadamiste,\" which was at the time extolled as a\r\nperfect _chef-d'oeuvre_ of style and vigor. There is in this play, if we\r\nmay be allowed the term, a certain rude nobility of expression, which is\r\nthe true characteristic of Crebillon's genius. It was this tragedy which\r\ninspired Voltaire with the idea, that on the stage it is better to strike\r\nhard than true. The enthusiastic auditory admitted, that if Racine could\r\npaint love, Crebillon could depict hatred. Boileau, who was then dying, and\r\nwho, could he have had his wish, would have desired that French literature\r\nmight stop at his name, exclaimed, that this success was scandalous. \"I\r\nhave lived too long!\" cried the old poet, in a violent rage. \"To what a\r\npack of Visigoths have I left the French stage a prey! The Pradons, whom we\r\nso often ridiculed, were eagles compared to these fellows.\" Boileau\r\nresembled in some respect old \"Nestor\" of the _Iliad_, when he said to the\r\nGreek kings--\"I would advise you to listen to me, for I have formerly mixed\r\nwith men who were your betters.\" The public, however, amply avenged\r\nCrebillon for the bitter judgment of Boileau; in eight days two editions of\r\nthe \"Rhadamiste\" were exhausted. And this was not all: the piece having\r\nbeen played by command of the Regent before the court at Versailles, was\r\napplauded to the echo.\r\n\r\nDespite these successes, Crebillon was not long in getting to the bottom of\r\nhis purse. In the hope of deferring as long as he possibly could the evil\r\nhour when he should be obliged to return to his former humble style of\r\nliving, he used every possible means to replenish his almost exhausted\r\nexchequer. He borrowed three thousand crowns from Baron Hoguer, who was the\r\nresource of literary men in the days of the Regency; and sold to a Jew\r\nusurer his author's rights upon a tragedy which was yet to be written. He\r\nhad counted upon the success of \"Xerxes;\" but this tragedy proved an utter\r\nfailure. Crebillon, however, was a man of strong mind. He returned home\r\nthat evening with a calm, and even smiling countenance: \"Well,\" eagerly\r\nexclaimed Madame Crebillon, who had been awaiting in anxiety the return of\r\nher husband. \"Well,\" replied he, \"they have damned my play; to-morrow we\r\nwill return to our old habits again.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, true to his word, on the following morning Crebillon returned to the\r\nPlace Maubert, where he hired a little apartment near his father-in-law,\r\nwho could still offer our poet and his wife, when hard pressed, a glass of\r\nhis _vin ordinaire_ and a share of his dinner. Out of all his rich\r\nfurniture Crebillon selected but a dozen cats and dogs, whom he chose as\r\nthe companions of his exile. To quote d'Alembert's words--\"Like Alcibiades,\r\nin former days, he passed from Persian luxury to Spartan austerity, and,\r\nwhat in all probability Alcibiades was not, he was happier in the second\r\nstate than he had been in the first.\"\r\n\r\nHis wife was in retirement what she had been in the world. She never\r\ncomplained. Perhaps even she showed herself in a more charming light, as\r\nthe kind and devoted companion of the hissed and penniless poet, than as\r\nthe admired wife of the popular dramatist. Poor Madame Crebillon hid their\r\npoverty from her husband with touching delicacy; he almost fancied himself\r\nrich, such a magic charm did she contrive to cast over their humble\r\ndwelling. Like Midas, she appeared to possess the gift of changing whatever\r\nshe touched into gold, that is to say, of giving life and light by her\r\nwinning grace to every thing with which she came in contact. Blessed,\r\nthrice blessed is that man, be he poet or philosopher, who, like Crebillon,\r\nhas felt and understood that amiability and a contented mind are in a wife\r\ntreasures inexhaustible, compared to which mere mundane wealth fades into\r\nutter insignificance. No word of complaint or peevish expression ever\r\npassed Madame Crebillon's lips; she was proud of her poet's glory, and\r\nendeavored always to sustain him in his independent ideas; she would listen\r\nresignedly to all his dreams of future triumphs, and knew how to cast\r\nherself into his arms when he would declare that he desired nothing more\r\nfrom mankind. One day, however, when there was no money in the house, on\r\nseeing him return with a dog under each arm, she ventured on a quiet\r\nremonstrance. \"Take care, Monsieur de Crebillon,\" she said, with a smile,\r\n\"we have already eight dogs and fifteen cats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know that,\" replied Crebillon; \"but see how piteously these poor\r\ndogs look at us; could I leave them to die of hunger in the street?\"\r\n\r\n\"But did it not strike you that they might possibly die of hunger here? I\r\ncan fully understand and enter into your feelings of love and pity for\r\nthese poor animals, but we must not convert the house into a hospital for\r\nfoundling dogs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why despair?\" said Crebillon. \"Providence never abandons genius and\r\nvirtue. The report goes that I am to be of the Academy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe it,\" said Madame Crebillon. \"Fontenelle and La Motte, who\r\nare but _beaux esprits_, will never permit a man like you to seat himself\r\nbeside them, for if you were of the Academy, would you not be the king of\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\nCrebillon, however, began his canvass, but as his wife had foreseen,\r\nFontenelle and La Motte succeeded in having him black-balled.\r\n\r\nAll these little literary thorns, however, only imparted greater charms to\r\nthe calm felicity of Crebillon's domestic hearth; but we must now open the\r\nsaddest page of our poet's hitherto peaceful and happy existence.\r\n\r\nOne evening, on his return from the Cafe Procope, the resort of all the\r\nwits and _litterateurs_ of the eighteenth century, Crebillon found his wife\r\nin a state of great agitation, half-undressed, and pressing their sleeping\r\ninfant to her bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Charlotte, what is the matter?\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" replied she, trembling, and looking towards the bed.\r\n\r\n\"What folly! you are like the children, you are frightened at shadows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am frightened at shadows; just now, as I was undressing, I saw a\r\nspectre glide along at the foot of the bed. I was ready to sink to the\r\nearth with terror, and it was with the greatest difficulty that I could\r\nmuster strength enough to reach the child's cradle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Child yourself,\" said Crebillon, playfully; \"you merely saw the shadow of\r\nthe bed-curtains.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" cried the young wife, seizing the poet's hand--\"it was Death! I\r\nrecognized him; for it is not the first time that he has shown himself to\r\nme. Ah! _mon ami_, with what grief and terror shall I prepare to lie down\r\nin the cold earth! If you love me as I love you, do not leave me for an\r\ninstant; help me to die, for if you are by my side at that hour, I shall\r\nfancy I am but dropping asleep.\"\r\n\r\nGreatly shocked at what he heard, Crebillon took his child in his arms, and\r\ncarried it back to its cradle. He returned to his wife, pressed her to his\r\nbosom, and sought vainly for words to relieve her apprehensions, and to\r\nlead back her thoughts into less sombre channels. He at length succeeded,\r\nbut not without great difficulty, in persuading her to retire to rest; she\r\nscarcely closed an eye. Poor Crebillon sat in silence by the bedside of his\r\nwife praying fervently in his heart; for perhaps he believed in omens and\r\npresentiments even to a greater degree than did Charlotte. Finding, at\r\nlength, that she had dropped asleep, he got into bed himself. When he awoke\r\nin the morning, he beheld Charlotte bending over him in a half-raised\r\nposture, as though she had been attentively regarding him as he slept.\r\nTerrified at the deadly paleness of her cheeks, and the unnatural\r\nbrilliancy of her eyes, and sensitive and tender-hearted as a child, he was\r\nunable to restrain his tears. She cast herself passionately into his arms,\r\nand covered his cheeks with tears and kisses.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis all over now,\" she whispered, in a broken voice; \"my heart beats too\r\nstrongly to beat much longer, but I die contented and happy, for I see by\r\nyour tears that you will not forget me.\"\r\n\r\nCrebillon rose hastily and ran to his father-in-law. \"Alas!\" said the poor\r\napothecary, \"her mother, who was as beautiful and as good as she, died\r\nyoung of a disease of the heart, and her child will go the same way.\"\r\n\r\nAll the most celebrated physicians of the day were called in, but before\r\nthey could determine upon a method of treatment, the spirit of poor\r\nCharlotte had taken flight from its earthly tabernacle.\r\n\r\nCrebillon, inconsolable at his loss, feared not the ridicule (for in the\r\neighteenth century all such exhibitions of feeling were considered highly\r\nridiculous) of lamenting his wife; he wept her loss during half a\r\ncentury--in other words, to his last hour.\r\n\r\nDuring the space of two years he scarcely appeared once at the Theatre\r\nFrancaise. He had the air of a man of another age, so completely a stranger\r\ndid he seem to all that was going on around him. One might say that he\r\nstill lived with his divine Charlotte; he would speak to her unceasingly,\r\nas if her gentle presence was still making the wilderness of his solitary\r\ndwelling blossom like the rose. After fifteen years of mourning, some\r\nfriends one day surprised him in his solitude, speaking aloud to his dear\r\nCharlotte, relating to her his projects for the future, and recalling their\r\npast days of happiness: \"Ah, Charlotte,\" he exclaimed, \"they all tell me of\r\nmy glory, yet I think but of thee!\"\r\n\r\nThe friends of Crebillon, uneasy respecting his future destiny, had advised\r\nhim during the preceding year to present himself at court, where he was\r\nreceived and recognized as a man of genius. In the early days of his\r\nwidowhood, he quitted Paris suddenly and took up his residence at\r\nVersailles. But at Versailles he lived as he had done in Paris, immured in\r\nhis chamber, and entirely engrossed with his own sombre and lugubrious\r\nthoughts and visions; in consequence of this, he was scarcely noticed; the\r\nking seeing before him a species of Danubian peasant, proud of his genius\r\nand his poverty, treated him with an almost disdainful coldness of manner.\r\nCrebillon did not at first comprehend his position at Versailles. He was a\r\nsimple-minded philosopher, who had studied heroes and not men. At length,\r\nconvinced that a poet at court is like a fish out of water, he returned to\r\nParis to live more nobly with his heroes and his poverty. He retired to the\r\nMarais, to the Rue des Deux-Portes, taking with him only a bed, a table,\r\ntwo chairs, and an arm-chair, \"in case,\" to use his own words, \"an honest\r\nman should come to visit him.\"\r\n\r\nIrritated at the rebuff he had met with at Versailles, ashamed of having\r\nsolicited in vain the justice of the king, he believed henceforth only in\r\nliberty. \"Liberty,\" said he, \"is the most vivid sentiment engraven on my\r\nheart.\" Unintentionally, perhaps, he avenged himself in the first work he\r\nundertook after this event: the tragedy of \"Cromwell,\"--\"an altar,\" as he\r\nsaid, \"which I erect to liberty.\" According to D'Alembert, he read to his\r\nfriends some scenes of this play, in which our British aversion for\r\nabsolutism was painted with wild and startling energy; in consequence\r\nthereof, he received an order forbidding him to continue his piece. His\r\nCromwell was a villain certainly, but a villain which would have told well\r\nupon the stage, from the degree of grandeur and heroic dignity with which\r\nthe author had invested the character. From that day he had enemies; but\r\nindeed it might be said that he had had enemies from the evening of the\r\nfirst representation of his \"Electre.\" Success here below has no other\r\nretinue.\r\n\r\nCrebillon was now almost penniless. By degrees, without having foreseen\r\nsuch an occurrence, he began to hear his numerous creditors buzzing around\r\nhim like a swarm of hornets. Not having any thing else to seize, they\r\nseized at the theatre his author's rights. The affair was brought before\r\nthe courts, and led to a decree of parliament which ordained that the works\r\nof the intellect were not seizable, consequently Crebillon retained the\r\nincome arising from the performance of his tragedies.\r\n\r\nSome years now passed away without bringing any fresh successes. Compelled\r\nby the court party to discontinue \"Cromwell,\" he gave \"Semiramis,\" which,\r\nlike \"Xerxes,\" some time previously, was a failure. Under the impression\r\nthat the public could not bring itself to relish \"sombre horrors of human\r\ntempests,\" he sought to arm himself as it were against his own nature, to\r\nsubdue and soften it. The tragedy of \"Pyrrhus,\" which recalled the tender\r\ncolors of Racine, cost him five years' labor. At that time, so strong in\r\nFrance was the empire of habit, that this tragedy, though utterly valueless\r\nas a work of art, and wanting both in style, relief, and expression, was\r\nreceived with enthusiasm. But Crebillon possessed too much good sense to be\r\nblinded by this spurious triumph. \"It is,\" said he, when speaking of his\r\nwork, \"but the shadow of a tragedy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pyrrhus\" obtained, after all, but a transitory success. After a brief\r\nperiod, the public began to discover that it was a foreign plant, which\r\nunder a new sky gave out but a factitious brilliancy. In despair at having\r\nwasted so much precious time in fruitless labor, and disgusted besides at\r\nthe conduct of some shameless intriguers who frequented the literary cafes\r\nof the capital, singing his defeat in trashy verse, Crebillon now retired\r\nalmost wholly from the world. He would visit the theatre, however,\r\noccasionally to chat with a few friends over the literary topics of the\r\nday; but at length even this recreation was abandoned, and he was seen in\r\nthe world no more.\r\n\r\nHe lived now without any other friends than his heroes and his cats and\r\ndogs, devouring the novels of La Calprenede, and relating long-winded\r\nromances to himself. His son affirms having seen fifteen dogs and as many\r\ncats barking and mewing at one time round his father, who would speak to\r\nthem much more tenderly than he would to himself. According to Freron's\r\naccount, Crebillon would pick up and carry home under his cloak all the\r\nwandering dogs he met with in the street, and give them shelter and\r\nhospitality. But in return for this, he would require from them an aptitude\r\nfor certain exercises; when, at the termination of the prescribed period,\r\nthe pupil was convicted of not having profited by the education he had\r\nreceived, the poet would take him under his cloak again, put him down at\r\nthe corner of a street and fly from the spot with tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\nOn the death of La Motte, Crebillon was at length admitted into the\r\nAcademy. As he was always an eccentric man, he wrote his \"Discourse\" of\r\nreception in verse, a thing which had never been done before. On\r\npronouncing this line, which has not yet been forgotten--\r\n\r\n    Aucun fiel n'a jamais empoisonne ma plume--\r\n\r\nhe was enthusiastically applauded. From that day, but from that day only,\r\nCrebillon was recognized by his countrymen as a man of honor and virtue, as\r\nwell as genius. It was rather late in the day, however; he had lost his\r\nwife, his son was mixing in the fashionable world, he was completely alone,\r\nand almost forgotten, expecting nothing more from the fickle public. More\r\nidle than a lazzarone, he passed years without writing a single line,\r\nthough his ever-active imagination would still produce, mentally, tragedy\r\nafter tragedy. As he possessed a wonderful memory, he would compose and\r\nrhyme off-hand the entire five acts of a piece without having occasion to\r\nput pen to paper. One evening, under the impression that he had produced a\r\nmasterpiece, he invited certain of his brother Academicians to his house to\r\nhear his new play. When the party had assembled, he commenced, and\r\ndeclaimed the entire tragedy from beginning to end without stopping.\r\nJudging by the ominous silence with which the conclusion was received, that\r\nhis audience was not over delighted with his play, he exclaimed, in a pet--\r\n\r\n\"You see, my friends, I was right in not putting my tragedy on paper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\" asked Godoyn.\r\n\r\n\"Because, I should have had the trouble of throwing it into the fire. Now,\r\nI shall merely have to forget it, which is easier done.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Crebillon seemed no longer formidable in the literary world, and all\r\nwere agreed he was in the decline of his genius, the very men who had\r\npreviously denied his power, now thought fit to combat Voltaire by exalting\r\nCrebillon, in the same way as they afterwards exalted Voltaire so soon as\r\nanother star appeared on the literary horizon.\r\n\r\n\"With the intention of humbling the pride of Voltaire, they proceeded,\"\r\nsays a writer of the time, \"to seek out in his lonely retreat the now aged\r\nand forsaken Crebillon, who, mute and solitary for the last thirty years,\r\nwas no longer a formidable enemy for them, but whom they flattered\r\nthemselves they could oppose as a species of phantom to the illustrious\r\nwriter by whom they were eclipsed; just as, in former days, the Leaguers\r\ndrew an old cardinal from out the obscurity in which he lived, to give\r\nhim the empty title of king, only that they themselves might reign under\r\nhis name.\"\r\n\r\nThe literary world was then divided into two adverse parties--the\r\nCrebillonists, and the Voltairians. The first, being masters of all the\r\navenues, succeeded for a length of time in blinding the public. Voltaire\r\npassed for a mere wit; Crebillon, for the sole heir of the sceptre of\r\nCorneille and Racine. It was this clique which invented the formula ever\r\nafterwards employed in the designation of these three poets--Corneille the\r\ngreat, Racine the tender, and Crebillon the tragic. One great advantage\r\nCrebillon possessed over Voltaire: he had written nothing for the last\r\nthirty years. His friends, or rather Voltaire's enemies, now began to give\r\nout that the author of \"Rhadamiste\" was engaged in putting the finishing\r\nhand to a tragedy, a veritable dramatic wonder, by name \"Catilina.\" Madame\r\nde Pompadour herself, tired of Voltaire's importunate ambition, now went\r\nover with her forces to the camp of the Crebillonists. She received\r\nCrebillon at court, and recommended him to the particular care of Louis\r\nXV., who conferred a pension on him, and also appointed him to the office\r\nof censor royal.\r\n\r\n\"Catilina\" was at length produced with great _eclat_. The court party,\r\nwhich was present in force at the first performance, doubtless contributed\r\nin a great measure to the success of the piece. The old poet, thus\r\nencouraged, set to work on a new play, the \"Triumvirat,\" with fresh ardor;\r\nbut as was Voltaire's lot in after years, it was soon perceptible that the\r\npoet was but the shadow of what he had been. Out of respect, however, for\r\nCrebillon's eighty-eight years, the tragedy was applauded, but in a few\r\ndays the \"Triumvirat\" was played to empty benches. Crebillon had now but\r\none thing left to do: to die, which, in fact, he did in the year 1762.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that Crebillon was one of the remarkable men of his\r\ncentury. That untutored genius, so striking in the boldness and brilliancy\r\nof its creations, but which more frequently repels through its own native\r\nbarbarity, was eminently the genius of Crebillon. But what, above all,\r\ncharacterizes the genius of the French nation--wit, grace, and\r\npolish--Crebillon never possessed; consequently, with all his vigor and all\r\nhis force, he never succeeded in creating a living work. He has depicted\r\nhuman perversity with a proud and daring hand--he has shown the\r\nfratricide, the infanticide, the parricide, but he never succeeded in\r\nattaining the sublimity of the Greek drama. And yet J. J. Rousseau affirmed\r\nthat of all the French tragic poets, Crebillon alone had recalled to him\r\nthe grandeur of the Greeks. If so, it was only through the nudity of\r\nterror, for the \"French AEschylus\" was utterly wanting in what may be termed\r\nhuman and philosophical sentiment.\r\n\r\nThere is a very beautiful portrait of Crebillon extant, by Latour. It would\r\ndoubtless be supposed that the man, so terrible in his dramatic furies, was\r\nof a dark and sombre appearance. Far from it; Crebillon was of a fair\r\ncomplexion, and had an artless expression of countenance, and a pair of\r\nbeautiful blue eyes. It must, however, be confessed, that by his method of\r\nborrowing the gestures of his heroes, coupled, moreover, with the habit he\r\nhad acquired of contracting his eyebrows in the fervor of composition,\r\nCrebillon in the end became a little more the man of his works. He was,\r\nmoreover, impatient and irritable, even with his favorite dogs and cats,\r\nand occasionally with his sweet-tempered and angelic wife, the ever\r\ncheerful partner alike of his joys and sorrows, who had so nobly resigned\r\nherself to the chances and changes of his good and ill-fortune; that loving\r\ncompanion of his hours of profusion and gaiety, when he aped the _grand\r\nseigneur_, as well as the devoted sharer of those days of poverty and\r\nneglect, when he retired from the world in disgust, to the old\r\ndwelling-house of the Place Maubert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHABITS OF FREDERICK THE GREAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal part of the life of this great monarch was spent in camp, and\r\nin a constant struggle with a host of enemies. Yet even then, when the busy\r\nday scarcely afforded a vacant moment, that moment, if it came, was sure to\r\nbe given to study. Let the young shopocracy of Glasgow never forget that\r\nFrederic had _very early_ formed an attachment to reading, which neither\r\nthe opposition of his father--who thought that the scholar would spoil the\r\nsoldier--nor the schemes of ambition and conquest, which occupied him so\r\nmuch in after life, were able to destroy or weaken. When at last,\r\ntherefore, he felt himself at liberty to sheathe the sword, he gave himself\r\nup to the cultivation and patronage of literature and the arts of peace, as\r\neagerly as he had ever done to the pursuit of military renown. Even before\r\nhis accession to the throne, and while yet but a young man, he had\r\nestablished in his residence at Rheimsberg nearly the same system of\r\nstudious application and economy in the management of his time to which he\r\never afterwards continued to adhere. His relaxations even then were almost\r\nentirely of an intellectual character; and he had collected around him a\r\ncircle of literary associates, with whom it was his highest enjoyment to\r\nspend his hours in philosophic conversation, or in amusements not unfitted\r\nto adorn a life of philosophy. In a letter written to one of his friends,\r\nhe says--\"I become every day more covetous of my time; I render an account\r\nof it to myself, and lose none of it but with great regret. My mind is\r\nentirely turned toward philosophy; it has rendered me admirable services,\r\nand I am greatly indebted to it. I find myself happy, abundantly more\r\ntranquil than formerly; my soul is less subject to violent agitations; and\r\nI do nothing till I have considered what course of action I ought to\r\nadopt.\" Let young men contrast such conduct with the frivolities of other\r\nnoble and royal persons, and be faithful to her whose ways are\r\npleasantness, and whose paths are peace. I shall conclude this paper with a\r\nsketch of his doings for the ordinary four-and-twenty hours. Dr. Towers,\r\nwho has written a history of his reign, informs us that it was his general\r\ncustom to rise at five o'clock in the morning, and sometimes earlier. He\r\ncommonly dressed his hair himself, and seldom employed more than two\r\nminutes for that purpose. His boots were put at the bedside, for he\r\nscarcely ever wore shoes. After he was dressed, the adjutant of the first\r\nbattalion of his guards brought him a list of all the persons that had\r\narrived at Potsdam, or departed from thence. When he had delivered his\r\norders to this officer he retired into an inner cabinet, where he employed\r\nhimself in private till seven o'clock. He then went into another apartment,\r\nwhere he drank coffee or chocolate, and here he found all the letters\r\naddressed to him from Potsdam and Berlin. Foreign letters were placed upon\r\na separate table. After reading all these letters, he wrote hints or notes\r\non the margin of those which his secretaries were to answer, and then\r\nreturning into the inner cabinet carried with him such as he meant to write\r\nor dictate an answer to himself. Here he employed himself until nine\r\no'clock. At ten the generals who were about his person attended. At eleven\r\nhe mounted his horse and rode to the parade, when he reviewed and exercised\r\nhis guards; and at the same hour, says Voltaire, all the colonels did the\r\nsame throughout the provinces. He afterwards walked for some time in the\r\ngarden with his generals. At one o'clock he sat down to dinner. He had no\r\ncarver, but did the honors of the table like a private gentleman. His\r\ndinner-time did not much exceed an hour. He then retired into his private\r\napartment, making low bows to his company. He remained in private till five\r\no'clock, when his reader waited on him. His reading lasted about two hours,\r\nand this was succeeded by a concert upon the flute which lasted till nine.\r\nHe supped at half-past nine with his favorite _literati_, and at twelve the\r\nking went to bed.--_Communication from David Vedder, in the Glasgow\r\nCitizen._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD MAN'S DEATH.\r\n\r\nA CHILD'S FIRST SIGHT OF SORROW.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Recollections of our Neighborhood in the West.\"[6]\r\n\r\nBY ALICE CAREY.\r\n\r\n\r\nChange is the order of nature; the old makes way for the new; over the\r\nperished growth of last year brighten the blossoms of this. What changes\r\nare to be counted, even in a little noiseless life like mine! How many\r\ngraves have grown green; how many locks have grown gray; how many, lately\r\nyoung, and strong in hope and courage, are faltering and fainting; how many\r\nhands that reached eagerly for the roses are drawn back bleeding and full\r\nof thorns; and, saddest of all, how many hearts are broken! I remember when\r\nI had no sad memory, when I first made room in my bosom for the\r\nconsciousness of death.\r\n\r\n    We have gained the world's cold wisdom now,\r\n      We have learned to pause and fear;\r\n    But where are the living founts whose flow\r\n      Was a joy of heart to hear!\r\n\r\nI remember the twilight, as though it were yesterday--grey, and dim, and\r\ncold, for it was late in October, when the shadow first came over my heart,\r\nthat no subsequent sunshine has ever swept entirely away. From the window\r\nof our cottage home, streamed a column of light, in which I sat stringing\r\nthe red berries of the brier rose.\r\n\r\nI had heard of death, but regarded it only with that vague apprehension\r\nwhich I felt for the demons and witches that gather poison herbs under the\r\nnew moon, in fairy forests, or strangle harmless travelers with wands of\r\nthe willow, or with vines of the wild grape or ivy. I did not much like to\r\nthink about them, and yet I felt safe from their influence.\r\n\r\nThere might be people, somewhere, that would die some time; I did'nt know,\r\nbut it would not be myself, or any one I knew. They were so well and so\r\nstrong, so full of joyous hopes, how could their feet falter, and their\r\nsmiles grow dim, and their fainting hands lay away their work, and fold\r\nthemselves together! No, no--it was not a thing to be believed.\r\n\r\nDrifts of sunshine from that season of blissful ignorance often come back,\r\nas lightly\r\n\r\n    As the winds of the May-time flow,\r\n    And lift up the shadows brightly\r\n    As the daffodil lifts the snow--\r\n\r\nthe shadows that have gathered with the years! It is pleasant to have them\r\nthus swept off--to find myself a child again--the crown of pale pain and\r\nsorrow that presses heavily now, unfelt, and the graves that lie lonesomely\r\nalong my way, covered up with flowers--to feel my mother's dark locks fall\r\nupon my cheek, as she teaches me the lesson or the prayer--to see my\r\nfather, now a sorrowful old man whose hair has thinned and whitened almost\r\nto the limit of three score years and ten, fresh and vigorous, strong for\r\nthe race--and to see myself a little child, happy with a new hat and a pink\r\nribbon, or even with the string of briar buds that I called coral. Now I\r\ntie it about my neck, and now around my forehead, and now twist it among my\r\nhair, as I have somewhere read great ladies do their pearls. The winds are\r\nblowing the last yellow leaves from the cherry tree--I know not why, but it\r\nmakes me sad. I draw closer to the light of the window, and slyly peep\r\nwithin--all is quiet and cheerful; the logs on the hearth are ablaze; my\r\nfather is mending a bridle-rein, which \"Traveller,\" the favorite riding\r\nhorse, snapt in two yesterday, when frightened at the elephant that\r\n(covered with a great white cloth), went by to be exhibited at the coming\r\nshow,--my mother is hemming a ruffle, perhaps for me to wear to school next\r\nquarter--my brother is reading in a newspaper, I know not what, but I see,\r\non one side, the picture of a bear: Let me listen--and flattening my cheek\r\nagainst the pane, I catch his words distinctly, for he reads loud and very\r\nclearly--it is an improbable story of a wild man who has recently been\r\ndiscovered in the woods of some far-away island--he seems to have been\r\nthere a long time, for his nails are grown like claws, and his hair, in\r\nrough and matted strings, hangs to his knees; he makes a noise like\r\nsomething between the howl of a beast and a human cry, and, when pursued,\r\nruns with a nimbleness and swiftness that baffle the pursuers, though\r\nmounted on the fleetest of steeds, urged through brake and bush to their\r\nutmost speed. When first seen, he was sitting on the ground and cracking\r\nnuts with his teeth; his arms are corded with sinews that make it probable\r\nhis strength is sufficient to strangle a dozen men; and yet on seeing human\r\nbeings, he runs into the thick woods, lifting such a hideous scream, the\r\nwhile, as make his discoverers clasp their hands to their ears. It is\r\nsuggested that this is not a solitary individual, become wild by isolation,\r\nbut that a race exists, many of which are perhaps larger and of more\r\nterrible aspects; but whether they have any intelligible language, and\r\nwhether they live in caverns of rocks or in trunks of hollow trees, remains\r\nfor discovery by some future and more daring explorers.\r\n\r\nMy brother puts down the paper and looks at the picture of the bear. \"I\r\nwould not read such foolish stories,\" says my father, as he holds the\r\nbridle up to the light, to see that it is nearly mended; my mother breaks\r\nthe thread which gathers the ruffle; she is gentle and loving, and does not\r\nlike to hear even implied reproof, but she says nothing; little Harry, who\r\nis playing on the floor, upsets his block-house, and my father, clapping\r\nhis hands together, exclaims, \"This is the house that Jack built!\" and\r\nadds, patting Harry on the head, \"Where is my little boy? this is not he,\r\nthis is a little carpenter; you must make your houses stronger, little\r\ncarpenter!\" But Harry insists that he is the veritable little Harry, and no\r\ncarpenter, and hides his tearful eyes in the lap of my mother, who assures\r\nhim that he is her own little boy, and soothes his childish grief by\r\nbuttoning on his neck the ruffle she has just completed; and off he\r\nscampers again, building a new house, the roof of which he makes very\r\nsteep, and calls it grandfather's house, at which all laugh heartily.\r\n\r\nWhile listening to the story of the wild man I am half afraid, but now, as\r\nthe joyous laughter rings out, I am ashamed of my fears, and skipping\r\nforth, I sit down on a green ridge which cuts the door-yard diagonally, and\r\nwhere, I am told, there was once a fence. Did the rose-bushes and lilacs\r\nand flags that are in the garden, ever grow here? I think--no, it must have\r\nbeen a long while ago, if indeed the fence were ever here, for I can't\r\nconceive the possibility of such change, and then I fall to arranging my\r\nstring of brier-buds into letters that will spell some name, now my own,\r\nand now that of some one I love. A dull strip of cloud, from which the hues\r\nof pink and red and gold have but lately faded out, hangs low in the west;\r\nbelow is a long reach of withering woods--the gray sprays of the beech\r\nclinging thickly still, and the gorgeous maples shooting up here and there\r\nlike sparks of fire among the darkly magnificent oaks and silvery columned\r\nsycamores--the gray and murmurous twilight gives way to darker shadows and\r\na deeper hush.\r\n\r\nI hear, far away, the beating of quick hoof-strokes on the pavement; the\r\nhorseman, I think to myself, is just coming down the hill through the thick\r\nwoods beyond the bridge. I listen close, and presently a hollow rumbling\r\nsound indicates that I was right; and now I hear the strokes more\r\nfaintly--he is climbing the hill that slopes directly away from me; but now\r\nagain I hear distinctly--he has almost reached the hollow below me--the\r\nhollow that in summer is starry with dandelions and now is full of brown\r\nnettles and withered weeds--he will presently have passed--where can he be\r\ngoing, and what is his errand? I will rise up and watch. The cloud passes\r\nfrom the face of the moon, and the light streams full and broad on the\r\nhorseman--he tightens his rein, and looks eagerly toward the house--surely\r\nI know him, the long red curls, streaming down his neck, and the straw hat,\r\nare not to be mistaken--it is Oliver Hillhouse, the miller, whom my\r\ngrandfather, who lives in the steep-roofed house, has employed three\r\nyears--longer than I can remember! He calls to me, and I laughingly bound\r\nforward, with an exclamation of delight, and put my arms about the slender\r\nneck of his horse, that is champing the bit and pawing the pavement, and I\r\nsay, \"Why do you not come in?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiles, but there is something ominous in his smile, as he hands me a\r\nfolded paper, saying, \"Give this to your mother;\" and, gathering up his\r\nreins, he rides hurriedly forward. In a moment I am in the house, for my\r\nerrand, \"Here mother is a paper which Oliver Hillhouse gave me for you.\"\r\nHer hand trembles as she receives it, and waiting timidly near, I watch her\r\nas she reads; the tears come, and without speaking a word she hands it to\r\nmy father.\r\n\r\nThat night there came upon my soul the shadow of an awful fear; sorrowful\r\nmoans and plaints disturbed my dreams that have never since been wholly\r\nforgot. How cold and spectral-like the moonlight streamed across my pillow;\r\nhow dismal the chirping of the cricket in the hearth; and how more than\r\ndismal the winds among the naked boughs that creaked against my window. For\r\nthe first time in my life I could not sleep, and I longed for the light of\r\nthe morning. At last it came, whitening up the East, and the stars faded\r\naway, and there came a flush of crimson and purple fire, which was\r\npresently pushed aside by the golden disk of the sun. Daylight without, but\r\nwithin there was thick darkness still.\r\n\r\nI kept close about my mother, for in her presence I felt a shelter and\r\nprotection that I found no where else.\r\n\r\n\"Be a good girl till I come back,\" she said, stooping and kissing my\r\nforehead; \"mother is going away to-day, your poor grandfather is very\r\nsick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me go too,\" I said, clinging close to her hand. We were soon ready;\r\nlittle Harry pouted his lips and reached out his hands, and my father gave\r\nhim his pocket-knife to play with; and the wind blowing the yellow curls\r\nover his eyes and forehead, he stood on the porch looking eagerly while my\r\nmother turned to see him again and again. We had before us a walk of\r\nperhaps two miles--northwardly along the turnpike nearly a mile, next,\r\nstriking into a grass-grown road that crossed it, in an easternly direction\r\nnearly another mile, and then turning northwardly again, a narrow lane,\r\nbordered on each side by old and decaying cherry-trees, led us to the\r\nhouse, ancient fashioned, with high steep gables, narrow windows, and low,\r\nheavy chimneys of stone. In the rear was an old mill, with a plank sloping\r\nfrom the door-sill to the ground, by way of step, and a square open window\r\nin the gable, through which, with ropes and pulleys, the grain was drawn\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThis mill was an especial object of terror to me, and it was only when my\r\naunt Carry led me by the hand, and the cheerful smile of Oliver Hillhouse\r\nlighted up the dusky interior, that I could be persuaded to enter it. In\r\ntruth it was a lonesome sort of place, with dark lofts and curious binns,\r\nand ladders leading from place to place; and there were cats creeping\r\nstealthily along the beams in wait for mice or swallows, if, as sometimes\r\nhappened, the clay nest should be loosened from the rafter, and the whole\r\ntumble ruinously down. I used to wonder that aunt Carry was not afraid in\r\nthe old place, with its eternal rumble, and its great dusty wheel moving\r\nslowly round and round, beneath the steady tread of the two sober horses\r\nthat never gained a hair's breadth for their pains; but on the contrary,\r\nshe seemed to like the mill, and never failed to show me through all its\r\nintricacies, on my visits. I have unraveled the mystery now, or rather,\r\nfrom the recollections I still retain, have apprehended what must have been\r\nclear to older eyes at the time.\r\n\r\nA forest of oak and walnut stretched along this extremity of the farm, and\r\non either side of the improvements (as the house and barn and mill were\r\ncalled) shot out two dark forks, completely cutting off the view, save\r\ntoward the unfrequented road to the south, which was traversed mostly by\r\npersons coming to the mill, for my grandfather made the flour for all the\r\nneighbourhood round about, besides making corn-meal for Johny-cakes, and\r\n\"chops\" for the cows.\r\n\r\nHe was an old man now, with a tall, athletic frame, slightly bent, thin\r\nlocks white as the snow, and deep blue eyes full of fire and intelligence,\r\nand after long years of uninterrupted health and useful labor, he was\r\nsuddenly stricken down, with no prospect of recovery.\r\n\r\n\"I hope he is better,\" said my mother, hearing the rumbling of the\r\nmill-wheel. She might have known my grandfather would permit no\r\ninterruption of the usual business on account of his illness--the\r\nneighbors, he said, could not do without bread because he was sick, nor\r\nneed they all be idle, waiting for him to die. When the time drew near, he\r\nwould call them to take his farewell and his blessing, but till then let\r\nthem sew and spin, and prepare dinner just as usual, so they would please\r\nhim best. He was a stern man--even his kindness was uncompromising and\r\nunbending, and I remember of his making toward me no manifestation of\r\nfondness, such as grandchildren usually receive, save once, when he gave me\r\na bright red apple, without speaking a word till my timid thanks brought\r\nout his \"Save your thanks for something better.\" The apple gave me no\r\npleasure, and I even slipt into the mill to escape from his cold,\r\nforbidding presence.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, he was a good man, strictly honest, and upright in all his\r\ndealings, and respected, almost reverenced, by everybody. I remember once,\r\nwhen young Winters, the tenant of Deacon Granger's farm, who paid a great\r\ndeal too much for his ground, as I have heard my father say, came to mill\r\nwith some withered wheat, my grandfather filled up the sacks out of his own\r\nflour, while Tommy was in the house at dinner. That was a good deed, but\r\nTommy Winters never suspected how his wheat happened to turn out so well.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near the house, it seemed to me more lonesome and desolate than\r\nit ever looked before. I wished I had staid at home with little Harry. So\r\neagerly I noted every thing, that I remember to this day, that near a\r\ntrough of water, in the lane, stood a little surly looking cow, of a red\r\ncolor, and with a white line running along her back. I had gone with aunt\r\nCarry often when she went to milk her, but, to-day she seemed not to have\r\nbeen milked. Near her was a black and white heifer, with sharp short horns,\r\nand a square board tied over her eyes; two horses, one of them gray, and\r\nthe other sorrel, with a short tail, were reaching their long necks into\r\nthe garden, and browsing from the currant bushes. As we approached they\r\ntrotted forward a little, and one of them, half playfully, half angrily,\r\nbit the other on the shoulder, after which they returned quietly to their\r\ncropping of the bushes, heedless of the voice that from across the field\r\nwas calling to them.\r\n\r\nA flock of turkeys were sunning themselves about the door, for no one came\r\nto scare them away; some were black, and some speckled, some with heads\r\nerect and tails spread, and some nibbling the grass; and with a gabbling\r\nnoise, and a staid and dignified march, they made way for us. The smoke\r\narose from the chimney in blue, graceful curls, and drifted away to the\r\nwoods; the dead morning-glory vines had partly fallen from the windows, but\r\nthe hands that tended them were grown careless, and they were suffered to\r\nremain blackened and void of beauty, as they were. Under these, the white\r\ncurtain was partly put aside, and my grandmother, with the speckled\r\nhandkerchief pinned across her bosom, and her pale face, a shade paler than\r\nusual, was looking out, and seeing us she came forth, and in answer to my\r\nmother's look of inquiry, shook her head, and silently led the way in. The\r\nroom we entered had some home-made carpet, about the size of a large\r\ntable-cloth, spread in the middle of the floor, the remainder of which was\r\nscoured very white; the ceiling was of walnut wood, and the side walls were\r\nwhite-washed--a table, an old-fashioned desk, and some wooden chairs,\r\ncomprised the furniture. On one of the chairs was a leather cushion; this\r\nwas set to one side, my grandmother neither offering it to my mother, nor\r\nsitting in it herself, while, by way of composing herself, I suppose, she\r\ntook off the black ribbon with which her cap was trimmed. This was a more\r\nsimple process than the reader may fancy, the trimming, consisting merely\r\nof a ribbon, always black, which she tied around her head after the cap was\r\non, forming a bow and two ends just above the forehead. Aunt Carry, who was\r\nof what is termed an even disposition, received us with her usual cheerful\r\ndemeanor, and then, re-seating herself comfortably near the fire, resumed\r\nher work, the netting of some white fringe.\r\n\r\nI liked aunt Carry, for that she always took especial pains to entertain\r\nme, showing me her patchwork, taking me with her to the cowyard and dairy,\r\nas also to the mill, though in this last I fear she was a little selfish;\r\nhowever, that made no difference to me at the time, and I have always been\r\nsincerely grateful to her: children know more, and want more, and feel\r\nmore, than people are apt to imagine.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion she called me to her, and tried to teach me the mysteries\r\nof her netting, telling me I must get my father to buy me a little bureau,\r\nand then I could net fringe and make a nice cover for it. For a little time\r\nI thought I could, and arranged in my mind where it should be placed, and\r\nwhat should be put into it, and even went so far as to inquire how much\r\nfringe she thought would be necessary. I never attained to much proficiency\r\nin the netting of fringe, nor did I ever get the little bureau, and now it\r\nis quite reasonable to suppose I never shall.\r\n\r\nPresently my father and mother were shown into an adjoining room, the\r\ninterior of which I felt an irrepressible desire to see, and by stealth I\r\nobtained a glimpse of it before the door closed behind them. There was a\r\ndull brown and yellow carpet on the floor, and near the bed, on which was a\r\nblue and white coverlid, stood a high backed wooden chair, over which hung\r\na towel, and on the bottom of which stood a pitcher, of an unique pattern.\r\nI know not how I saw this, but I did, and perfectly remember it,\r\nnotwithstanding my attention was in a moment completely absorbed by the\r\nsick man's face, which was turned towards the opening door, pale, livid,\r\nand ghastly. I trembled, and was transfixed; the rings beneath the eyes,\r\nwhich had always been deeply marked, were now almost black, and the blue\r\neyes within looked glassy and cold, and terrible. The expression of agony\r\non the lips (for his disease was one of a most painful nature) gave place\r\nto a sort of smile, and the hand, twisted among the gray locks, was\r\nwithdrawn and extended to welcome my parents, as the door closed. That was\r\na fearful moment; I was near the dark steep edges of the grave; I felt, for\r\nthe first time, that I was mortal too, and I was afraid.\r\n\r\nAunt Carry put away her work, and taking from a nail in the window-frame a\r\nbrown muslin sun bonnet, which seemed to me of half a yard in depth, she\r\ntied it on my head, and then clapt her hands as she looked into my face,\r\nsaying, \"bopeep!\" at which I half laughed and half cried, and making\r\nprovision for herself in grandmother's bonnet, which hung on the opposite\r\nside of the window, and was similar to mine, except that it was perhaps a\r\nlittle larger, she took my hand and we proceeded to the mill. Oliver, who\r\nwas very busy on our entrance, came forward, as aunt Carry said, by way of\r\nintroduction, \"A little visitor I've brought you,\" and arranged a seat on a\r\nbag of meal for us, and taking off his straw hat pushed the red curls from\r\nhis low white forehead, and looked bewildered and anxious.\r\n\r\n\"It's quite warm for the season,\" said aunt Carry, by way of breaking\r\nsilence, I suppose. The young man said \"yes,\" abstractedly, and then asked\r\nif the rumble of the mill were not a disturbance to the sick room, to which\r\naunt Carry answered, \"No, my father says it is his music.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good old man,\" said Oliver, \"he will not hear it much longer,\" and then,\r\neven more sadly, \"every thing will be changed.\" Aunt Carry was silent, and\r\nhe added, \"I have been here a long time, and it will make me very sorry to\r\ngo away, especially when such trouble is about you all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Oliver,\" said aunt Carra, \"you don't mean to go away?\" \"I see no\r\nalternative,\" he replied; \"I shall have nothing to do; if I had gone a year\r\nago it would have been better.\" \"Why?\" asked aunt Carry; but I think she\r\nunderstood why, and Oliver did not answer directly, but said, \"Almost the\r\nlast thing your father said to me was, that you should never marry any who\r\nhad not a house and twenty acres of land; if he has not, he will exact that\r\npromise of you, and I cannot ask you not to make it, nor would you refuse\r\nhim if I did; I might have owned that long ago, but for my sister (she had\r\nlost her reason) and my lame brother, whom I must educate to be a\r\nschool-master, because he never can work, and my blind mother; but God\r\nforgive me! I must not and do not complain; you will forget me, before\r\nlong, Carry, and some body who is richer and better, will be to you all I\r\nonce hoped to be, and perhaps more.\"\r\n\r\nI did not understand the meaning of the conversation at the time, but I\r\nfelt out of place some way, and so, going to another part of the mill, I\r\nwatched the sifting of the flour through the snowy bolter, listening to the\r\nrumbling of the wheel. When I looked around I perceived that Oliver had\r\ntaken my place on the meal bag, and that he had put his arm around the\r\nwaist of aunt Carry in a way I did not much like.\r\n\r\nGreat sorrow, like a storm, sweeps us aside from ordinary feelings, and we\r\ngive our hearts into kindly hands--so cold and hollow and meaningless seem\r\nthe formulae of the world. They had probably never spoken of love before,\r\nand now talked of it as calmly as they would have talked of any thing else;\r\nbut they felt that hope was hopeless; at best, any union was deferred,\r\nperhaps, for long years; the future was full of uncertainties. At last\r\ntheir tones became very low, so low I could not hear what they said; but I\r\nsaw that they looked very sorrowful, and that aunt Carry's hand lay in that\r\nof Oliver as though he were her brother.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't the flour come through?\" I said, for the sifting had become\r\nthinner and lighter, and at length quite ceased. Oliver smiled, faintly, as\r\nhe arose, and saying, \"This will never buy the child a frock,\" poured a\r\nsack of wheat into the hopper, so that it nearly run over. Seeing no child\r\nbut myself, I supposed he meant to buy me a new frock, and at once resolved\r\nto put it in my little bureau, if he did.\r\n\r\n\"We have bothered Mr. Hillhouse long enough,\" said aunt Carry, taking my\r\nhand, \"and will go to the house, shall we not?\"\r\n\r\nI wondered why she said \"Mr. Hillhouse,\" for I had never heard her say so\r\nbefore; and Oliver seemed to wonder, too, for he said reproachfully, laying\r\nparticular stress on his own name, \"You don't bother Mr. Hillhouse, I am\r\nsure, but I must not insist on your remaining if you wish to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to insist on my staying,\" said aunt Carry, \"if you don't want\r\nto, and I see you don't,\" and lifting me out to the sloping plank, that\r\nbent beneath us, we descended.\r\n\r\n\"Carry,\" called a voice behind us; but she neither answered nor looked\r\nback, but seeming to feel a sudden and expressive fondness for me, took me\r\nup in her arms, though I was almost too heavy for her to lift, and kissing\r\nme over and over, said I was light as a feather, at which she laughed as\r\nthough neither sorrowful nor lacking for employment.\r\n\r\nThis little passage I could never precisely explain, aside from the ground\r\nthat \"the course of true love never did run smooth.\" Half an hour after we\r\nreturned to the house, Oliver presented himself at the door, saying, \"Miss\r\nCaroline, shall I trouble you for a cup, to get a drink of water?\" Carry\r\naccompanied him to the well, where they lingered some time, and when she\r\nreturned her face was sunshiny and cheerful as usual.\r\n\r\nThe day went slowly by, dinner was prepared, and removed, scarcely tasted;\r\naunt Carry wrought at her fringe, and grandmother moved softly about,\r\npreparing teas and cordials.\r\n\r\nTowards sunset the sick man became easy, and expressed a wish that the door\r\nof his chamber might be opened, that he might watch our occupations and\r\nhear our talk. It was done accordingly, and he was left alone. My mother\r\nsmiled, saying she hoped he might yet get well, but my father shook his\r\nhead mournfully, and answered, \"He wishes to go without our knowledge.\" He\r\nmade amplest provision for his family always, and I believe had a kind\r\nnature, but he manifested no little fondnesses, nor did he wish caresses\r\nfor himself. Contrary to the general tenor of his character, was a love of\r\nquiet jests, that remained to the last. Once, as Carry gave him some drink,\r\nhe said, \"You know my wishes about your future, I expect you to be\r\nmindful.\"\r\n\r\nI stole to the door of his room in the hope that he would say something to\r\nme, but he did not, and I went nearer, close to the bed, and timidly took\r\nhis hand in mine; how damp and cold it felt! yet he spoke not, and climbing\r\nupon the chair, I put back his thin locks, and kissed his forehead. \"Child,\r\nyou trouble me,\" he said, and these were the last words he ever spoke to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe sun sunk lower and lower, throwing a beam of light through the little\r\nwindow, quite across the carpet, and now it reached the sick man's room,\r\nclimbed over the bed and up the wall; he turned his face away, and seemed\r\nto watch its glimmer upon the ceiling The atmosphere grew dense and dusky,\r\nbut without clouds, and the orange light changed to a dull lurid red, and\r\nthe dying and dead leaves dropt silently to the ground, for there was no\r\nwind, and the fowls flew into the trees, and the grey moths came from\r\nbeneath the bushes and fluttered in the waning light. From the hollow tree\r\nby the mill came the bat, wheeling and flitting blindly about, and once or\r\ntwice its wings struck the window of the sick man's chamber. The last\r\nsunlight faded off at length, and the rumbling of the mill-wheel was still:\r\nhe has fallen asleep in listening to its music.\r\n\r\nThe next day came the funeral. What a desolate time it was! All down the\r\nlane were wagons and carriages and horses, for every body that knew my\r\ngrandfather had come to pay him the last honors. \"We can do him no further\r\ngood,\" they said, \"but it seemed right that we should come.\" Close by the\r\ngate waited the little brown wagon to bear the coffin to the grave, the\r\nwagon in which he was used to ride while living. The heads of the horses\r\nwere drooping, and I thought they looked consciously sad.\r\n\r\nThe day was mild and the doors and windows of the old house stood all open,\r\nso that the people without could hear the words of the preacher. I remember\r\nnothing he said; I remember of hearing my mother sob, and of seeing my\r\ngrandmother with her face buried in her hands, and of seeing aunt Carra\r\nsitting erect, her face pale but tearless, and Oliver near her, with his\r\nhands folded across his breast save once or twice, when he lifted them to\r\nbrush away tears.\r\n\r\nI did not cry, save from a frightened and strange feeling, but kept wishing\r\nthat we were not so near the dead, and that it were another day. I tried to\r\npush the reality away with thoughts of pleasant things--in vain. I remember\r\nthe hymn, and the very air in which it was sung.\r\n\r\n    \"Ye fearful souls fresh courage take,\r\n      The clouds ye so much dread,\r\n    Are big with mercy, and shall break\r\n      In blessings on your head.\r\n    Blind unbelief is sure to err,\r\n      And scan his works in vain;\r\n    God is his own interpreter,\r\n      And he will make it plain.\"\r\n\r\nNear the door blue flagstones were laid, bordered with a row of shrubberies\r\nand trees, with lilacs, and roses, and pears, and peach-trees, which my\r\ngrandfather had planted long ago, and here, in the open air, the coffin was\r\nplaced, and the white cloth removed, and folded over the lid. I remember\r\nhow it shook and trembled as the gust came moaning from the woods, and\r\ndied off over the next hill, and that two or three withered leaves fell on\r\nthe face of the dead, which Oliver gently removed and brushed aside a\r\nyellow winged butterfly that hovered near.\r\n\r\nThe friends hung over the unsmiling corpse till they were led weeping and\r\none by one away; the hand of some one rested for a moment on the forehead,\r\nand then the white cloth was replaced, and the lid screwed down. The coffin\r\nwas placed in the brown wagon, with a sheet folded about it, and the long\r\ntrain moved slowly to the burial-ground woods, where the words \"dust to\r\ndust\" were followed by the rattling of the earth, and the sunset light fell\r\nthere a moment, and the dead leaves blew across the smoothly shapen mound.\r\n\r\nWhen the will was read, Oliver found himself heir to a fortune--the mill\r\nand the homestead and half the farm--provided he married Carry, which I\r\nsuppose he did, for though I do not remember the wedding, I have had an\r\naunt Caroline Hillhouse almost as long as I can remember. The lunatic\r\nsister was sent to an asylum, where she sung songs about a faithless lover\r\ntill death took her up and opened her eyes in heaven. The mother was\r\nbrought home, and she and my grandmother lived at their ease, and sat in\r\nthe corner, and told stories of ghosts, and witches, and marriages, and\r\ndeaths, for long years. Peace to their memories! for they have both gone\r\nhome; and the lame brother is teaching school, in his leisure playing the\r\nflute, and reading Shakspeare--all the book he reads.\r\n\r\nYears have come and swept me away from my childhood, from its innocence and\r\nblessed unconsciousness of the dark, but often comes back the memory of its\r\nfirst sorrow!\r\n\r\nDeath is less terrible to me now.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] In press and soon to be published by J.

There are certain\r\ntrifles by which a shrewd observer may judge of a man's disposition. Thus,\r\nranged on the table, with some elegance, but with soldier-like precision,\r\nwere sundry little relics of former days, hallowed by some sentiment of\r\nmemory, or perhaps endeared solely by custom; which, whether he was in\r\nEgypt, Italy, or England, always made part of the furniture of Harley's\r\nroom. Even the small, old-fashioned, and somewhat inconvenient inkstand in\r\nwhich he dipped the pen as he labelled the letters he put aside, belonged\r\nto the writing-desk which had been his pride as a school-boy. Even the\r\nbooks that lay scattered round were not new works, not those to which we\r\nturn to satisfy the curiosity of an hour, or to distract our graver\r\nthoughts: they were chiefly either Latin or Italian poets, with many a\r\npencil-mark on the margin; or books which, making severe demand on thought,\r\nrequire slow and frequent perusal, and become companions. Somehow or other,\r\nin remarking that even in dumb inanimate things the man was averse to\r\nchange, and had the habit of attaching himself to whatever was connected\r\nwith old associations, you might guess that he clung with pertinacity to\r\naffections more important, and you could better comprehend the freshness of\r\nhis friendship for one so dissimilar in pursuits and character as Audley\r\nEgerton. An affection once admitted into the heart of Harley L'Estrange,\r\nseemed never to be questioned or reasoned with: it became tacitly fixed, as\r\nit were, into his own nature; and little less than a revolution of his\r\nwhole system could dislodge or disturb it.\r\n\r\nLord L'Estrange's hand rested now upon a letter in a stiff legible Italian\r\ncharacter; and instead of disposing of it at once, as he had done with the\r\nrest, he spread it before him, and re-read the contents. It was a letter\r\nfrom Riccabocca, received a few weeks since, and ran thus:--\r\n\r\n     _Letter from Signor Riccabocca to Lord Estrange._\r\n\r\n     \"I thank you, my noble friend, for judging of me with\r\n     faith in my honor, and respect for my reverses.\r\n\r\n     \"No, and thrice no to all concessions, all overtures,\r\n     all treaty with Giulio Franzini. I write the name, and\r\n     my emotions choke me. I must pause and cool back into\r\n     disdain. It is over. Pass from that subject. But you\r\n     have alarmed me. This sister! I have not seen her since\r\n     her childhood; and she was brought up under his\r\n     influence--she can but work as his agent. She wish to\r\n     learn my residence! it can be but for some hostile and\r\n     malignant purpose. I may trust in you. I know that. You\r\n     say I may trust equally in the discretion of your\r\n     friend. Pardon me--my confidence is not so elastic. A\r\n     word may give the clue to my retreat. But, if\r\n     discovered, what harm can ensue? An English roof\r\n     protects me from Austrian despotism; true; but not the\r\n     brazen tower of Danae could protect me from Italian\r\n     craft. And were there nothing worse, it would be\r\n     intolerable to me to live under the eyes of a\r\n     relentless spy. Truly saith our proverb, 'He sleeps ill\r\n     for whom the enemy wakes.' Look you, my friend, I have\r\n     done with my old life--I wish to cast it from me as a\r\n     snake its skin. I have denied myself all that exiles\r\n     deem consolation. No pity for misfortune, no messages\r\n     from sympathizing friendship, no news from a lost and\r\n     bereaved country follow me to my hearth under the skies\r\n     of the stranger. From all these I have voluntarily cut\r\n     myself off. I am as dead to the life I once lived as if\r\n     the Styx rolled between _it_ and me. With that\r\n     sternness which is admissible only to the afflicted, I\r\n     have denied myself even the consolation of your\r\n     visits. I have told you fairly and simply that your\r\n     presence would unsettle all my enforced and infirm\r\n     philosophy, and remind me only of the past, which I\r\n     seek to blot from remembrance. You have complied on the\r\n     one condition, that whenever I really want your aid I\r\n     will ask it; and, meanwhile, you have generously sought\r\n     to obtain me justice from the cabinets of ministers and\r\n     in the courts of kings. I did not refuse your heart\r\n     this luxury; for I have a child--(Ah! I have taught\r\n     that child already to revere your name, and in her\r\n     prayers it is not forgotten.) But now that you are\r\n     convinced that even your zeal is unavailing, I ask you\r\n     to discontinue attempts that may but bring the spy upon\r\n     my track, and involve me in new misfortunes. Believe\r\n     me, O brilliant Englishman, that I am satisfied and\r\n     contented with my lot. I am sure it would not be for my\r\n     happiness to change it. 'Chi non ha provato il male non\r\n     conosce il bene.' ('One does not know when one is well\r\n     off till one has known misfortune.') You ask me how I\r\n     live--I answer, _alla giornata_--to the day--not for\r\n     the morrow, as I did once. I have accustomed myself to\r\n     the calm existence of a village. I take interest in its\r\n     details. There is my wife, good creature, sitting\r\n     opposite to me, never asking what I write, or to whom,\r\n     but ready to throw aside her work and talk the moment\r\n     the pen is out of my hand. Talk--and what about? Heaven\r\n     knows! But I would rather hear that talk, though on the\r\n     affairs of a hamlet, than babble again with recreant\r\n     nobles and blundering professors about commonwealths\r\n     and constitutions. When I want to see how little those\r\n     last influence the happiness of wise men, have I not\r\n     Machiavel and Thucydides? Then, by-and-by, the Parson\r\n     will drop in, and we argue. He never knows when he is\r\n     beaten, so the argument is everlasting. On fine days I\r\n     ramble out by a winding rill with my Violante, or\r\n     stroll to my friend the Squire's, and see how healthful\r\n     a thing is true pleasure; and on wet days I shut myself\r\n     up, and mope, perhaps, till, hark! a gentle tap at the\r\n     door, and in comes Violante, with her dark eyes that\r\n     shine out through reproachful tears--reproachful that I\r\n     should mourn alone, while she is under my roof--so she\r\n     puts her arms round me, and in five minutes all is\r\n     sunshine within. What care we for your English gray\r\n     clouds without?\r\n\r\n     \"Leave me, my dear Lord--leave me to this quiet happy\r\n     passage towards old age, serener than the youth that I\r\n     wasted so wildly: and guard well the secret on which my\r\n     happiness depends.\r\n\r\n     \"Now to yourself, before I close. Of that same\r\n     _yourself_ you speak too little, as of me too much. But\r\n     I so well comprehend the profound melancholy that lies\r\n     underneath the wild and fanciful humor with which you\r\n     but suggest, as in sport, what you feel so in earnest.\r\n     The laborious solitude of cities weighs on you. You are\r\n     flying back to the _dolce far niente_--to friends few,\r\n     but intimate; to life monotonous, but unrestrained; and\r\n     even there the sense of loneliness will again seize\r\n     upon you; and you do not seek, as I do, the\r\n     annihilation of memory; your dead passions are turned\r\n     to ghosts that haunt you, and unfit you for the living\r\n     world. I see it all--I see it still, in your hurried\r\n     fantastic lines, as I saw it when we two sat amidst the\r\n     pines and beheld the blue lake stretched below. I\r\n     troubled by the shadow of the Future, you disturbed by\r\n     that of the Past.\r\n\r\n     \"Well, but you say, half-seriously, half in jest, 'I\r\n     _will_ escape from this prison-house of memory; I will\r\n     form new ties, like other men, and before it be too\r\n     late; I _will_ marry--aye, but I must love--there is\r\n     the difficulty'--difficulty--yes, and heaven be thanked\r\n     for it! Recall all the unhappy marriages that have come\r\n     to your knowledge--pray have not eighteen out of twenty\r\n     been marriages for love? It always has been so, and it\r\n     always will. Because, whenever we love deeply, we exact\r\n     so much and forgive so little. Be content to find some\r\n     one with whom your hearth and your honor are safe. You\r\n     will grow to love what never wounds your heart--you\r\n     will soon grow out of love with what must always\r\n     disappoint your imagination. _Cospetto!_ I wish my\r\n     Jemima had a younger sister for you. Yet it was with a\r\n     deep groan that I settled myself to a--Jemima.\r\n\r\n     \"Now, I have written you a long letter, to prove how\r\n     little I need of your compassion or your zeal. Once\r\n     more let there be long silence between us. It is not\r\n     easy for me to correspond with a man of your rank, and\r\n     not incur the curious gossip of my still little pool of\r\n     a world which the splash of a pebble can break into\r\n     circles. I must take this over to a post-town some ten\r\n     miles off, and drop it into the box by stealth.\r\n\r\n     \"Adieu, dear and noble friend, gentlest heart and\r\n     subtlest fancy that I have met in my walk through life.\r\n     Adieu--write me word when you have abandoned a\r\n     day-dream and found a Jemima.\r\n\r\n                              ALPHONSO.\r\n\r\n     \"_P. S._--For heaven's sake caution and re-caution your\r\n     friend the minister, not to drop a word to this woman\r\n     that may betray my hiding-place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he really happy?\" murmured Harley as he closed the letter; and he sank\r\nfor a few moments into a reverie.\r\n\r\n\"This life in a village--this wife in a lady who puts down her work to talk\r\nabout villagers--what a contrast to Audley's full existence. And I can\r\nnever envy nor comprehend either--yet my own--what is it?\"\r\n\r\nHe rose, and moved towards the window, from which a rustic stair descended\r\nto a green lawn--studded with larger trees than are often found in the\r\ngrounds of a suburban residence. There were calm and coolness in the sight,\r\nand one could scarcely have supposed that London lay so near.\r\n\r\nThe door opened softly, and a lady past middle age, entered; and,\r\napproaching Harley, as he still stood musing by the window, laid her hand\r\non his shoulder. What character there is in a hand! Hers was a hand that\r\nTitian would have painted with elaborate care! Thin, white, and\r\ndelicate--with the blue veins raised from the surface. Yet there was\r\nsomething more than mere patrician elegance in the form and texture. A true\r\nphysiologist would have said at once, \"there are intellect and pride in\r\nthat hand, which seems to fix a hold where it rests; and, lying so lightly,\r\nyet will not be as lightly shaken off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Harley,\" said the lady--and Harley turned--\"you do not deceive me by that\r\nsmile,\" she continued sadly; \"you were not smiling when I entered.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is rarely that we smile to ourselves, my dear mother; and I have done\r\nnothing lately so foolish as to cause me to smile _at_ myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"My son,\" said Lady Lansmere, somewhat abruptly, but with great\r\nearnestness, \"you come from a line of illustrious ancestors; and methinks\r\nthey ask from their tombs why the last of their race has no aim and no\r\nobject--no interest--no home in the land which they served, and which\r\nrewarded them with its honors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" said the soldier simply, \"when the land was in danger I served it\r\nas my forefathers served--and my answer would be the scars on my breast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it only in danger that a country is served--only in war that duty is\r\nfulfilled? Do you think that your father, in his plain manly life of\r\ncountry gentleman, does not fulfil, though obscurely, the objects for which\r\naristocracy is created and wealth is bestowed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubtless he does, ma'am--and better than his vagrant son ever can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet his vagrant son has received such gifts from nature--his youth was so\r\nrich in promise--his boyhood so glowed at the dream of glory?--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said Harley very softly, \"it is possible--and all to be buried in a\r\nsingle grave!\"\r\n\r\nThe Countess started, and withdrew her hand from Harley's shoulder.\r\n\r\nLady Lansmere's countenance was not one that much varied in expression. She\r\nhad in this, as in her cast of feature, little resemblance to her son.\r\n\r\nHer features were slightly aquiline--the eyebrows of that arch which gives\r\na certain majesty to the aspect: the lines round the mouth were habitually\r\nrigid and compressed. Her face was that of one who had gone through great\r\nemotion and subdued it. There was something formal, and even ascetic, in\r\nthe character of her beauty, which was still considerable;--in her air and\r\nin her dress. She might have suggested to you the idea of some Gothic\r\nbaroness of old, half chatelaine, half abbess; you would see at a glance\r\nthat she did not live in the light world round her, and disdained its\r\nfashion and its mode of thought; yet with all this rigidity it was still\r\nthe face of the woman who has known human ties and human affections. And\r\nnow, as she gazed long on Harley's quiet, saddened brow, it was the face of\r\na mother.\r\n\r\n\"A single grave,\" she said, after a long pause. \"And you were then but a\r\nboy, Harley! Can such a memory influence you even to this day? It is\r\nscarcely possible; it does not seem to me within the realities of man's\r\nlife--though it might be of woman's.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" said Harley, half soliloquising, \"that I have a great deal of\r\nthe woman in me. Perhaps men who live much alone, and care not for men's\r\nobjects, do grow tenacious of impressions, as your sex does. But oh,\" he\r\ncried aloud, and with a sudden change of countenance, \"oh, the hardest and\r\nthe coldest man would have felt as I do, had he known _her_--had he loved\r\n_her_. She was like no other woman I have ever met. Bright and glorious\r\ncreature of another sphere! She descended on this earth, and darkened it\r\nwhen she passed away. It is no use striving. Mother, I have as much courage\r\nas our steel-clad fathers ever had. I have dared in battle and in\r\ndeserts--against man and the wild beast--against the storm and the\r\nocean--against the rude powers of Nature--dangers as dread as ever pilgrim\r\nor Crusader rejoiced to brave. But courage against that one memory! no, I\r\nhave not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Harley, Harley, you break my heart!\" cried the Countess, clasping her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"It is astonishing,\" continued her son, so wrapped in his own thoughts that\r\nhe did not perhaps hear her outcry--\"yea, verily, it is astonishing, that\r\nconsidering the thousands of women I have seen and spoken with, I never see\r\na face like hers--never hear a voice so sweet. And all this universe of\r\nlife cannot afford me one look and one tone that can restore me to man's\r\nprivilege--love. Well, well, well, life has other things yet--Poetry and\r\nArt live still--still smiles the heaven, and still wave the trees. Leave me\r\nto happiness in my own way.\"\r\n\r\nThe Countess was about to reply, when the door was thrown hastily open, and\r\nLord Lansmere walked in.\r\n\r\nThe Earl was some years older than the Countess, but his placid face showed\r\nless wear and tear; a benevolent, kindly face--without any evidence of\r\ncommanding intellect, but with no lack of sense in its pleasant lines. His\r\nform not tall, but upright, and with an air of consequence--a little\r\npompous, but good-humoredly so. The pomposity of the _Grand Seigneur_, who\r\nhas lived much in provinces--whose will has been rarely disputed, and whose\r\nimportance has been so felt and acknowledged as to react insensibly on\r\nhimself; an excellent man: but when you glanced towards the high brow and\r\ndark eye of the Countess, you marvelled a little how the two had come\r\ntogether, and, according to common report, lived so happily in the union.\r\n\r\n\"Ho, ho! my dear Harley,\" cried Lansmere, rubbing his hands with an\r\nappearance of much satisfaction, \"I have just been paying a visit to the\r\nDuchess.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Duchess, my dear father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, your mother's first cousin, to be sure--the Duchess of Knaresborough,\r\nwhom, to oblige me, you condescended to call upon; and delighted I am to\r\nhear that you admire Lady Mary--\"\r\n\r\n\"She is very high-bred, and rather-high-nosed,\" answered Harley. Then\r\nobserving that his mother looked pained, and his father disconcerted, he\r\nadded seriously, \"But handsome certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Harley,\" said the Earl, recovering himself, \"the Duchess, taking\r\nadvantage of our connection to speak freely, had intimated to me that Lady\r\nMary has been no less struck with yourself; and to come to the point, since\r\nyou allow that it is time you should think of marrying, I do not know a\r\nmore desirable alliance. What do you say, Catherine?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Duke is of a family that ranks in history before the Wars of the\r\nRoses,\" said Lady Lansmere, with an air of deference to her husband; \"and\r\nthere has never been one scandal in its annals, or one blot in its\r\nscutcheon. But I am sure my dear Lord must think that the Duchess should\r\nnot have made the first overture--even to a friend and a kinsman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, we are old-fashioned people,\" said the Earl rather embarrassed, \"and\r\nthe Duchess is a woman of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us hope,\" said the Countess mildly, \"that her daughter is not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not marry Lady Mary, if all the rest of the female sex were turned\r\ninto apes,\" said Lord L'Estrange, with deliberate fervor.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens!\" cried the Earl, \"what extraordinary language is this! And\r\npray why, sir?\"\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"I can't say--there is no why in these cases. But, my dear\r\nfather, you are not keeping faith with me.\"\r\n\r\n_Lord Lansmere._--\"How?\"\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"You and my Lady here entreat me to marry--I promise to do my\r\nbest to obey you; but on one condition--that I choose for myself, and take\r\nmy time about it. Agreed on both sides. Whereon, off goes your\r\nLordship--actually before noon, at an hour when no lady without a shudder\r\ncould think of cold blonde and damp orange flowers--off goes your Lordship,\r\nI say, and commits poor Lady Mary and your unworthy son to a mutual\r\nadmiration--which neither of us ever felt. Pardon me, my father--but this\r\nis grave. Again let me claim your promise--full choice for myself, and no\r\nreference to the Wars of the Roses. What war of the roses like that between\r\nModesty and Love upon the cheek of the virgin!\"\r\n\r\n_Lady Lansmere._--\"Full choice for yourself, Harley;--so be it. But we,\r\ntoo, named a condition--Did we not, Lansmere?\"\r\n\r\nThe _Earl_ (puzzled).--\"Eh--did we! Certainly we did.\"\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"What was it?\"\r\n\r\n_Lady Lansmere._--\"The son of Lord Lansmere can only marry the daughter of\r\na gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Earl._--\"Of course--of course.\"\r\n\r\nThe blood rushed over Harley's fair face, and then as suddenly left it\r\npale.\r\n\r\nHe walked away to the window--his mother followed him, and again laid her\r\nhand on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"You were cruel,\" said he gently and in a whisper, as he winced under the\r\ntouch of the hand. Then turning to the Earl, who was gazing at him in blank\r\nsurprise--(it never occurred to Lord Lansmere that there could be a doubt\r\nof his son's marrying beneath the rank modestly stated by the\r\nCountess)--Harley stretched forth his hand, and said, in his soft winning\r\ntone, \"you have ever been most gracious to me, and most forbearing; it is\r\nbut just that I should sacrifice the habits of an egotist, to gratify a\r\nwish which you so warmly entertain. I agree with you, too, that our race\r\nshould not close in me--_Noblesse oblige_. But you know I was ever\r\nromantic; and I must love where I marry--or, if not love, I must feel that\r\nmy wife is worthy of all the love I could once have bestowed. Now, as to\r\nthe vague word 'gentleman' that my mother employs--word that means so\r\ndifferently on different lips--I confess that I have a prejudice against\r\nyoung ladies brought up in the 'excellent foppery of the world,' as the\r\ndaughters of gentlemen of our rank mostly are. I crave, therefore, the most\r\nliberal interpretation of this word 'gentleman.' And so long as there be\r\nnothing mean or sordid in the birth, habits, and education of the father of\r\nthis bride to be, I trust you will both agree to demand nothing\r\nmore--neither titles nor pedigree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Titles, no--assuredly,\" said Lady Lansmere; \"they do not make gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" said the Earl. \"Many of our best families are untitled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Titles--no,\" repeated Lady Lansmere; \"but ancestors--yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my mother,\" said Harley with his most sad and quiet smile, \"it is\r\nfated that we shall never agree. The first of our race is ever the one we\r\nare most proud of; and pray, what ancestors had he? Beauty, virtue,\r\nmodesty, intellect--if these are not nobility enough for a man, he is a\r\nslave to the dead.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words Harley took up his hat and made towards the door.\r\n\r\n\"You said yourself, '_Noblesse oblige_,'\" said the Countess, following him\r\nto the threshold; \"we have nothing more to add.\"\r\n\r\nHarley slightly shrugged his shoulders, kissed his mother's hand, whistled\r\nto Nero, who started up from a doze by the window, and went his way.\r\n\r\n\"Does he really go abroad next week?\" said the Earl.\r\n\r\n\"So he says.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid there is no chance for Lady Mary,\" resumed Lord Lansmere, with\r\na slight but melancholy smile.\r\n\r\n\"She has not intellect enough to charm him. She is not worthy of Harley,\"\r\nsaid the proud mother.\r\n\r\n\"Between you and me,\" rejoined the Earl, rather timidly, \"I don't see what\r\ngood his intellect does him. He could not be more unsettled and useless if\r\nhe were the merest dunce in the three kingdoms. And so ambitious as he was\r\nwhen a boy! Catherine, I sometimes fancy that you know what changed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I! Nay, my dear Lord, it is a common change enough with the young, when of\r\nsuch fortunes; who find, when they enter life, that there is really little\r\nleft for them to strive for. Had Harley been a poor man's son, it might\r\nhave been different.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was born to the same fortunes as Harley,\" said the Earl, shrewdly, \"and\r\nyet I flatter myself I am of some use to old England.\"\r\n\r\nThe Countess seized upon the occasion, complimented her Lord, and turned\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nHarley spent his day in his usual desultory, lounging manner--dined in his\r\nquiet corner at his favorite club--Nero, not admitted into the club,\r\npatiently waited for him outside the door. The dinner over, dog and man,\r\nequally indifferent to the crowd, sauntered down that thoroughfare which,\r\nto the few who can comprehend the Poetry of London, has associations of\r\nglory and of woe sublime as any that the ruins of the dead elder world can\r\nfurnish--thoroughfare that traverses what was once the courtyard of\r\nWhitehall, having to its left the site of the palace that lodged the\r\nroyalty of Scotland--gains, through a narrow strait, that old isle of\r\nThorney, in which Edward the Confessor received the ominous visit of the\r\nConqueror--and, widening once more by the Abbey and the Hall of\r\nWestminster, then loses itself, like all memories of earthly grandeur,\r\namidst humble passages and mean defiles.\r\n\r\nThus thought Harley L'Estrange--ever less amidst the actual world around\r\nhim, than the images invoked by his own solitary soul--as he gained the\r\nbridge, and saw the dull lifeless craft sleeping on the \"Silent Way,\" once\r\nloud and glittering with the gilded barks of the antique Seignorie of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIt was on that bridge that Audley Egerton had appointed to meet L'Estrange,\r\nat an hour when he calculated he could best steal a respite from debate.\r\nFor Harley, with his fastidious dislike to all the resorts of his equals,\r\nhad declined to seek his friend in the crowded regions of Bellamy's.\r\n\r\nHarley's eye, as he passed along the bridge, was attracted by a still form,\r\nseated on the stones in one of the nooks, with its face covered by its\r\nhands. \"If I were a sculptor,\" said he to himself, \"I should remember that\r\nimage whenever I wished to convey the idea of _despondency_!\" He lifted his\r\nlooks and saw, a little before him in the midst of the causeway, the firm\r\nerect figure of Audley Egerton. The moonlight was full on the bronzed\r\ncountenance of the strong public man,--with its lines of thought and care,\r\nand its vigorous but cold expression of intense self-control.\r\n\r\n\"And looking yonder,\" continued Harley's soliloquy, \"I should remember that\r\nform, when I wished to hew out from the granite the idea of _Endurance_.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you are come, and punctually,\" said Egerton, linking his arm in\r\nHarley's.\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"Punctually, of course, for I respect your time, and I will not\r\ndetain you long. I presume you will speak to-night.\"\r\n\r\n_Egerton._--\"I have spoken.\"\r\n\r\n_Harley_, (with interest.)--\"And well, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n_Egerton._--\"With effect, I suppose, for I have been loudly cheered, which\r\ndoes not always happen to me.\"\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"And that gave you pleasure?\"\r\n\r\n_Egerton_, (after a moment's thought.)--\"No, not the least.\"\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"What, then, attaches you so much to this life--constant\r\ndrudgery, constant warfare--the more pleasurable faculties dormant, all the\r\nharsher ones aroused, if even its rewards (and I take the best of those to\r\nbe applause) do not please you?\"\r\n\r\n_Egerton._--\"What?--custom.\"\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"Martyr!\"\r\n\r\n_Egerton._--\"You say it. But turn to yourself; you have decided, then, to\r\nleave England next week.\"\r\n\r\n_Harley_, (moodily.)--\"Yes. This life in a capital, where all are so\r\nactive, myself so objectless, preys on me like a low fever. Nothing here\r\namuses me, nothing interests, nothing comforts and consoles. But I am\r\nresolved, before it be too late, to make one great struggle out of the\r\nPast, and into the natural world of men. In a word, I have resolved to\r\nmarry.\"\r\n\r\n_Egerton._--\"Whom?\"\r\n\r\n_Harley_, (seriously.)--\"Upon my life, my dear fellow, you are a great\r\nphilosopher. You have hit the exact question. You see I cannot marry a\r\ndream; and where out of dreams, shall I find this 'whom?'\"\r\n\r\n_Egerton._--\"You do not search for her.\"\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"Do we ever search for love? Does it not flash upon us when we\r\nleast expect it? Is it not like the inspiration to the muse? What poet\r\nsits down and says, 'I will write a poem?' What man looks out and says, 'I\r\nwill fall in love.' No! Happiness, as the great German tells us, 'falls\r\nsuddenly from the bosom of the gods;' so does love.\"\r\n\r\n_Egerton._--\"You remember the old line in Horace: 'Life's tide flows away,\r\nwhile the boor sits on the margin and waits for the ford.'\"\r\n\r\n_Harley._--\"An idea which incidentally dropped from you some weeks ago, and\r\nwhich I had before half meditated, has since haunted me. If I could but\r\nfind some child with sweet dispositions and fair intellect not yet formed,\r\nand train her up, according to my ideal. I am still young enough to wait a\r\nfew years, and meanwhile I shall have gained what I so sadly want--an\r\nobject in life.\"\r\n\r\n_Egerton._--\"You are ever the child of romance. But what\"--\r\n\r\nHere the minister was interrupted by a messenger from the House of Commons,\r\nwhom Audley had instructed to seek him on the bridge should his presence be\r\nrequired--\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the opposition are taking advantage of the thinness of the House to\r\ncall for a division, Mr. ---- is put up to speak for time, but they won't\r\nhear him.\"\r\n\r\nEgerton turned hastily to Lord L'Estrange, \"You see you must excuse me now.\r\nTo-morrow I must go to Windsor for two days; but we shall meet on my\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\n\"It does not matter,\"' answered Harley; \"I stand out of the pale of your\r\nadvice, O practical man of sense. And if,\" added Harley with affectionate\r\nand mournful sweetness--\"If I worry you with complaints which you cannot\r\nunderstand, it is only because of old school-boy habits. I can have no\r\ntrouble that I do not confide in you.\"\r\n\r\nEgerton's hand trembled as it pressed his friend's; and, without a word, he\r\nhurried away abruptly. Harley remained motionless for some seconds, in deep\r\nand quiet reverie; then he called to his dog, and turned back towards\r\nWestminster.\r\n\r\nHe passed the nook in which had sat the still figure of Despondency. But\r\nthe figure had now risen, and was leaning against the balustrade. The dog\r\nwho had preceded his master paused by the solitary form, and sniffed it\r\nsuspiciously.\r\n\r\n\"Nero, sir, come here,\" said Harley.\r\n\r\n\"Nero,\" that was the name by which Helen had said that her father's friend\r\nhad called his dog. And the sound startled Leonard as he leant, sick at\r\nheart, against the stone, he lifted his head and looked wistfully, eagerly,\r\ninto Harley's face. Those eyes, bright, clear, yet so strangely deep and\r\nabsent, which Helen had described, met his own, and chained them. For\r\nL'Estrange halted also; the boy's countenance was not unfamiliar to him. He\r\nreturned the inquiring look fixed on his own, and recognized the student by\r\nthe book-stall.\r\n\r\n\"The dog is quite harmless, sir,\" said L'Estrange, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"And you called him Nero?\" said Leonard, still gazing on the stranger.\r\n\r\nHarley mistook the drift of the question.\r\n\r\n\"Nero, sir; but he is free from the sanguinary propensities of his Roman\r\nnamesake.\" Harley was about to pass on, when Leonard said falteringly,--\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, but can it be possible that you are one whom I have sought in\r\nvain, on behalf of the child of Captain Digby?\"\r\n\r\nHarley stopped short. \"Digby!\" he exclaimed, \"where is he? He should have\r\nfound me easily. I gave him an address.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Heaven be thanked,\" cried Leonard. \"Helen is saved; she will not die;\"\r\nand he burst into tears.\r\n\r\nA very few moments, and a very few words sufficed to explain to Harley the\r\nstate of his old fellow-soldier's orphan. And Harley himself soon stood in\r\nthe young sufferer's room, supporting her burning temples on his breast,\r\nand whispering into ears that heard him, as in a happy dream, \"Comfort,\r\ncomfort; your father yet lives in me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then Helen, raising her eyes, said \"But Leonard is my brother--more\r\nthan brother--and he needs a father's care more than I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, hush, Helen. I need no one--nothing now!\" cried Leonard; and his\r\ntears gushed over the little hand that clasped his own.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nHarley L'Estrange was a man whom all things that belong to the romantic and\r\npoetic side of our human life deeply impressed. When he came to learn the\r\ntie between these two children of nature, standing side by side, alone\r\namidst the storms of fate, his heart was more deeply moved than it had been\r\nfor many years. In those dreary attics, overshadowed by the smoke and reek\r\nof the humble suburb--the workday world in its harshest and tritest forms\r\nbelow and around them--he recognized that divine poem which comes out from\r\nall union between the mind and the heart. Here, on the rough deal table,\r\n(the ink scarcely dry,) lay the writings of the young wrestler for fame and\r\nbread; there, on the other side the partition, on that mean pallet, lay the\r\nboy's sole comforter--the all that warmed his heart with living mortal\r\naffection. On one side the wall, the world of imagination; on the other\r\nthis world of grief and of love. And in both, a spirit equally\r\nsublime--unselfish Devotion--\"the something afar from the sphere of our\r\nsorrow.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked round the room into which he had followed Leonard, on quitting\r\nHelen's bedside. He noted the MSS. on the table, and, pointing to them,\r\nsaid gently, \"And these are the labors by which you supported the soldier's\r\norphan?--soldier yourself, in a hard battle!\"\r\n\r\n\"The battle was lost--I could not support her,\" replied Leonard mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"But you did not desert her. When Pandora's box was opened, they say Hope\r\nlingered last----\"\r\n\r\n\"False, false,\" said Leonard; \"a heathen's notion. There are deities that\r\nlinger behind Hope;--Gratitude, Love, and Duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yours is no common nature,\" exclaimed Harley, admiringly, \"but I must\r\nsound it more deeply hereafter; at present I hasten for the physician; I\r\nshall return with him. We must move that poor child from this low close air\r\nas soon as possible. Meanwhile, let me qualify your rejection of the old\r\nfable. Wherever Gratitude, Love, and Duty remain to man, believe me that\r\nHope is there too, though she may be oft invisible, hidden behind the\r\nsheltering wings of the nobler deities.\"\r\n\r\nHarley said this with that wondrous smile of his, which cast a brightness\r\nover the whole room--and went away.\r\n\r\nLeonard stole softly towards the grimy window; and looking up towards the\r\nstars that shone pale over the roof-tops, he murmured, \"O thou, the\r\nAll-seeing and All-merciful!--how it comforts me now to think that though\r\nmy dreams of knowledge may have sometimes obscured the Heaven, I never\r\ndoubted that Thou wert there!--as luminous and everlasting, though behind\r\nthe cloud!\" So, for a few minutes, he prayed silently--then passed into\r\nHelen's room, and sat beside her motionless, for she slept. She woke just\r\nas Harley returned with a physician, and then Leonard, returning to his own\r\nroom, saw amongst his papers the letter he had written to Mr. Dale; and\r\nmuttering, \"I need not disgrace my calling--I need not be the mendicant\r\nnow\"--held the letter to the flame of the candle. And while he said this,\r\nand as the burning tinder dropped on the floor, the sharp hunger, unfelt\r\nduring his late anxious emotion, gnawed at his entrails. Still even hunger\r\ncould not reach that noble pride which had yielded to a sentiment nobler\r\nthan itself--and he smiled as he repeated, \"No mendicant!--the life that I\r\nwas sworn to guard is saved. I can raise against Fate the front of the Man\r\nonce more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, and Helen, removed to a pure air, and under the\r\nadvice of the first physicians, was out of all danger.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty detached cottage, with its windows looking over the wild\r\nheaths of Norwood, to which Harley rode daily to watch the convalescence of\r\nhis young charge--an object in life was already found. As she grew better\r\nand stronger, he coaxed her easily into talking, and listened to her with\r\npleased surprise. The heart so infantine, and the sense so womanly, struck\r\nhim much by its rare contrast and combination. Leonard, whom he had\r\ninsisted on placing also in the cottage, had stayed there willingly till\r\nHelen's recovery was beyond question. Then he came to Lord L'Estrange, as\r\nthe latter was about one day to leave the cottage, and said quietly, \"Now,\r\nmy Lord, that Helen is safe, and now that she will need me no more, I can\r\nno longer be a pensioner on your bounty. I return to London.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are my visitor--not my pensioner, foolish boy,\" said Harley, who had\r\nalready noticed the pride which spoke in that farewell; \"come into the\r\ngarden, and let us talk.\"\r\n\r\nHarley seated himself on a bench on the little lawn; Nero crouched at his\r\nfeet; Leonard stood beside him.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said Lord L'Estrange, \"you would return to London!--What to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fulfil my fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot guess. Fate is the Isis whose veil no mortal can ever raise.\"\r\n\r\n\"You should be born for great things,\" said Harley, abruptly. \"I am sure\r\nthat you write well. I have seen that you study with passion. Better than\r\nwriting and better than study, you have a noble heart, and the proud desire\r\nof independence. Let me see your MSS., or any copies of what you have\r\nalready printed. Do not hesitate--I ask but to be a reader. I don't pretend\r\nto be a patron; it is a word I hate.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard's eyes sparkled through their sudden moisture. He brought out his\r\nportfolio, placed it on the bench beside Harley, and then went softly to\r\nthe further part of the garden. Nero looked after him, and then rose and\r\nfollowed him slowly. The boy seated himself on the turf, and Nero rested\r\nhis dull head on the loud heart of the poet.\r\n\r\nHarley took up the various papers before him and read them through\r\nleisurely. Certainly he was no critic. He was not accustomed to analyse\r\nwhat pleased or displeased him; but his perceptions were quick, and his\r\ntaste exquisite. As he read, his countenance, always so genuinely\r\nexpressive, exhibited now doubt and now admiration. He was soon struck by\r\nthe contrast in the boy's writings; between the pieces that sported with\r\nfancy, and those that grappled with thought. In the first, the young poet\r\nseemed so unconscious of his own individuality. His imagination, afar and\r\naloft from the scenes of his suffering, ran riot amidst a paradise of happy\r\ngolden creations. But in the last, the THINKER stood out alone and\r\nmournful, questioning, in troubled sorrow, the hard world on which he\r\ngazed. All in the thought was unsettled, tumultuous; all in the fancy,\r\nserene, and peaceful. The genius seemed divided into twain shapes; the one\r\nbathing its wings amidst the starry dews of heaven; the other wandering\r\n\"melancholy, slow,\" amidst desolate and boundless sands. Harley gently laid\r\ndown the paper and mused a little while. Then he rose and walked to\r\nLeonard, gazing on his countenance as he neared the boy, with a new and\r\ndeeper interest.\r\n\r\n\"I have read your papers,\" he said, \"and recognize in them two men,\r\nbelonging to two worlds, essentially distinct.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard started, and murmured, \"True, true!\"\r\n\r\n\"I apprehend,\" resumed Harley, \"that one of these men must either destroy\r\nthe other, or that the two must become fused and harmonized into a single\r\nexistence. Get your hat, mount my groom's horse, and come with me to\r\nLondon; we will converse by the way. Look you, I believe you and I agree in\r\nthis, that the first object of every noble spirit is independence. It is\r\ntowards this independence that I alone presume to assist you; and this is a\r\nservice which the proudest man can receive without a blush.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard lifted his eyes towards Harley's, and those eyes swam with grateful\r\ntears; but his heart was too full to answer.\r\n\r\n\"I am not one of those,\" said Harley, when they were on the road, \"who\r\nthink that because a young man writes poetry he is fit for nothing else,\r\nand that he must be a poet or a pauper. I have said that in you there seem\r\nto me to be two men, the man of the Ideal world, the man of the Actual. To\r\neach of these men I can offer a separate career. The first is perhaps the\r\nmore tempting. It is the interest of the state to draw into its service all\r\nthe talent and industry it can obtain; and under his native state every\r\ncitizen of a free country should be proud to take service. I have a friend\r\nwho is a minister, and who is known to encourage talent--Audley Egerton. I\r\nhave but to say to him, 'There is a young man who will well repay to the\r\ngovernment whatever the government bestows on him' and you will rise\r\nto-morrow independent in means, and with fair occasions to attain to\r\nfortune and distinction. This is one offer, what say you to it?\"\r\n\r\nLeonard thought bitterly of his interview with Audley Egerton, and the\r\nminister's proffered crown-piece. He shook his head and replied--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my lord, how have I deserved such kindness? Do with me what you will;\r\nbut if I have the option, I would rather follow my own calling. This is not\r\nthe ambition that inflames me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear, then, the other offer. I have a friend with whom I am less intimate\r\nthan Egerton, and who has nothing in his gift to bestow. I speak of a man\r\nof letters--Henry Norreys--of whom you have doubtless heard, who, I should\r\nsay, conceived an interest in you when he observed you reading at the\r\nbook-stall. I have often heard him say, that literature as a profession is\r\nmisunderstood, and that rightly followed, with the same pains and the same\r\nprudence which are brought to bear on other professions, a competence at\r\nleast can be always ultimately obtained. But the way may be long and\r\ntedious--and it leads to no power but over thought; it rarely attains to\r\nwealth; and, though _reputation_ may be certain, _Fame_, such as poets\r\ndream of, is the lot of few. What say you to this course?\"\r\n\r\n\"My lord, I decide,\" said Leonard, firmly; and then his young face lighting\r\nup with enthusiasm, he exclaimed. \"Yes, if, as you say, there be two men\r\nwithin me, I feel, that were I condemned wholly to the mechanical and\r\npractical world, one would indeed destroy the other. And the conqueror\r\nwould be the ruder and the coarser. Let me pursue those ideas that, though\r\nthey have but flitted across me vague and formless--have ever soared\r\ntowards the sunlight. No matter whether or not they lead to fortune or to\r\nfame, at least they will lead me upward! Knowledge for itself I\r\ndesire--what care I, if it be not power?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" said Harley, with a pleased smile at his young companion's\r\noutburst. \"As you decide so shall it be settled. And now permit me, if not\r\nimpertinent, to ask you a few questions. Your name is Leonard Fairfield?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy blushed deeply, and bowed his head as if in assent.\r\n\r\n\"Helen says you are self-taught; for the rest she refers me to\r\nyou--thinking, perhaps, that I should esteem you less--rather than yet more\r\nhighly--if she said you were, as I presume to conjecture, of humble birth.\"\r\n\r\n\"My birth,\" said Leonard, slowly, \"is very--very--humble.\"\r\n\r\n\"The name of Fairfield is not unknown to me. There was one of that name who\r\nmarried into a family in Lansmere--married an Avenel--\" continued\r\nHarley--and his voice quivered. \"You change countenance. Oh, could your\r\nmother's name have been Avenel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Leonard, between his set teeth. Harley laid his hand on the\r\nboy's shoulder. \"Then indeed I have a claim on you--then, indeed, we are\r\nfriends. I have a right to serve any of that family.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard looked at him in surprise--\"For,\" continued Harley, recovering\r\nhimself, \"they always served my family; and my recollections of Lansmere,\r\nthough boyish, are indelible.\" He spurred on his horse as the words\r\nclosed--and again there was a long pause; but from that time Harley always\r\nspoke to Leonard in a soft voice, and often gazed on him with earnest and\r\nkindly eyes.\r\n\r\nThey reached a house in a central, though not fashionable street. A\r\nman-servant of a singularly grave and awful aspect opened the door; a man\r\nwho had lived all his life with authors. Poor devil, he was indeed\r\nprematurely old! The care on his lip and the pomp on his brow--no mortal's\r\npen can describe!\r\n\r\n\"Is Mr. Norreys at home?\" asked Harley.\r\n\r\n\"He is at home--to his friends, my lord,\" answered the man, majestically;\r\nand he stalked across the hall with the step of a Dangeau ushering some\r\nMontmorenci to the presence of _Louis le Grand_.\r\n\r\n\"Stay--show this gentleman into another room. I will go first into the\r\nlibrary; wait for me, Leonard.\" The man nodded, and ushered Leonard into\r\nthe dining-room. Then pausing before the door of the library, and listening\r\nan instant, as if fearful to disturb some mood of inspiration, opened it\r\nvery softly. To his ineffable disgust, Harley pushed before, and entered\r\nabruptly. It was a large room, lined with books from the floor to the\r\nceiling. Books were on all the tables--books were on all the chairs. Harley\r\nseated himself on a folio of Raleigh's History of the World, and cried--\r\n\r\n\"I have brought you a treasure!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said Norreys, good-humoredly, looking up from his desk.\r\n\r\n\"A mind!\"\r\n\r\n\"A mind!\" echoed Norreys, vaguely. \"Your own?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh--I have none--I have only a heart and a fancy. Listen. You remember\r\nthe boy we saw reading at the book-stall. I have caught him for you, and\r\nyou shall train him into a man. I have the warmest interest in his\r\nfuture--for I knew some of his family--and one of that family was very dear\r\nto me. As for money, he has not a shilling, and not a shilling would he\r\naccept gratis from you or me either. But he comes with bold heart to\r\nwork--and work you must find him.\" Harley then rapidly told his friend of\r\nthe two offers he had made to Leonard--and Leonard's choice.\r\n\r\n\"This promises very well; for letters a man must have a strong vocation as\r\nhe should have for law--I will do all that you wish.\"\r\n\r\nHarley rose with alertness--shook Norreys cordially by the hand--hurried\r\nout of the room, and returned with Leonard.\r\n\r\nMr. Norreys eyed the young man with attention. He was naturally rather\r\nsevere than cordial in his manner to strangers--contrasting in this, as in\r\nmost things, the poor vagabond Burley. But he was a good judge of the human\r\ncountenance, and he liked Leonard's. After a pause he held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"Lord L'Estrange tells me that you wish to enter literature\r\nas a calling, and no doubt to study it is an art. I may help you in this,\r\nand you meanwhile can help me. I want an amanuensis--I offer you that\r\nplace. The salary will be proportioned to the services you will render me.\r\nI have a room in my house at your disposal. When I first came up to London,\r\nI made the same choice that I hear you have done. I have no cause, even in\r\na worldly point of view, to repent my choice. It gave me an income larger\r\nthan my wants. I trace my success to these maxims, which are applicable to\r\nall professions--1st, Never to trust to genius--for what can be obtained by\r\nlabor; 2dly, Never to profess to teach what we have not studied to\r\nunderstand; 3dly, Never to engage our word to what we do not do our best to\r\nexecute. With these rules literature, provided a man does not mistake his\r\nvocation for it, and will, under good advice, go through the preliminary\r\ndiscipline of natural powers, which all vocations require, is as good a\r\ncalling as any other. Without them a shoeblack's is infinitely better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possible enough,\" muttered Harley; \"but there have been great writers who\r\nobserved none of your maxims.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great writers, probably, but very unenviable men. My Lord, my Lord, don't\r\ncorrupt the pupil you bring to me.\" Harley smiled and took his departure,\r\nand left Genius at school with Common Sense and Experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nWhile Leonard Fairfield had been obscurely wrestling against poverty,\r\nneglect, hunger, and dread temptations, bright had been the opening day,\r\nand smooth the upward path, of Randal Leslie. Certainly no young man, able\r\nand ambitious, could enter life under fairer auspices; the connection and\r\navowed favorite of a popular and energetic statesman, the brilliant writer\r\nof a political work, that had lifted him at once into a station of his\r\nown--received and courted in those highest circles, to which neither rank\r\nnor fortune alone suffices for a familiar passport--the circles above\r\nfashion itself--the circles of power--with every facility of augmenting\r\ninformation, and learning the world betimes through the talk of its\r\nacknowledged masters,--Randal had but to move straight onward, and success\r\nwas sure. But his tortuous spirit delighted in scheme and intrigue for\r\ntheir own sake. In scheme and intrigue he saw shorter paths to fortune, if\r\nnot to fame. His besetting sin was also his besetting weakness. He did not\r\naspire--he _coveted_. Though in a far higher social position than Frank\r\nHazeldean, despite the worldly prospects of his old school-fellow, he\r\ncoveted the very things that kept Frank Hazeldean below him--coveted his\r\nidle gaieties, his careless pleasures, his very waste of youth. Thus, also,\r\nRandal less aspired to Audley Egerton's repute than he coveted Audley\r\nEgerton's wealth and pomp, his princely expenditure, and his Castle\r\nRackrent in Grosvenor Square. It was the misfortune of his birth to be so\r\nnear to both these fortunes--near to that of Leslie, as the future head of\r\nthat fallen house,--near even to that of Hazeldean, since as we have seen\r\nbefore, if the Squire had had no son, Randal's descent from the Hazeldeans\r\nsuggested himself as the one on whom these broad lands should devolve. Most\r\nyoung men, brought into intimate contact with Audley Egerton, would have\r\nfelt for that personage a certain loyal and admiring, if not very\r\naffectionate, respect. For there was something grand in Egerton--something\r\nthat commands and fascinates the young. His determined courage, his\r\nenergetic will, his almost regal liberality, contrasting a simplicity in\r\npersonal tastes and habits that was almost austere--his rare and seemingly\r\nunconscious power of charming even the women most wearied of homage, and\r\npersuading even the men most obdurate to counsel--all served to invest the\r\npractical man with those spells which are usually confined to the ideal\r\none. But indeed, Audley Egerton was an Ideal--the ideal of the Practical.\r\nNot the mere vulgar, plodding, red-tape machine of petty business, but the\r\nman of strong sense, inspired by inflexible energy, and guided to definite\r\nearthly objects. In a dissolute and corrupt form of government, under a\r\ndecrepit monarchy, or a vitiated republic, Audley Egerton might have been a\r\nmost dangerous citizen; for his ambition was so resolute, and his sight to\r\nits ends was so clear. But there is something in public life in England\r\nwhich compels the really ambitious man to honor, unless his eyes are\r\njaundiced and oblique like Randal Leslie's. It is so necessary in England\r\nto be a gentleman. And thus Egerton was emphatically considered a\r\n_gentleman_. Without the least pride in other matters, with little apparent\r\nsensitiveness, touch him on the point of gentleman, and no one so sensitive\r\nand so proud. As Randal saw more of him, and watched his moods with the\r\nlynx eyes of the household spy, he could perceive that this hard mechanical\r\nman was subject to fits of melancholy, even of gloom, and though they did\r\nnot last long, there was even in his habitual coldness an evidence of\r\nsomething comprest, latent, painful, lying deep within his memory. This\r\nwould have interested the kindly feelings of a grateful heart. But Randal\r\ndetected and watched it only as a clue to some secret it might profit him\r\nto gain. For Randal Leslie hated Egerton; and hated him the more because\r\nwith all his book knowledge and his conceit in his own talents, he could\r\nnot despise his patron--because he had not yet succeeded in making his\r\npatron the mere tool or stepping-stone--because he thought that Egerton's\r\nkeen eye saw through his wily heart, even while, as if in profound disdain,\r\nthe minister helped the protege. But this last suspicion was unsound.\r\nEgerton had not detected Leslie's corrupt and treacherous nature. He might\r\nhave other reasons for keeping him at a certain distance, but he inquired\r\ntoo little into Randal's feelings towards himself to question the\r\nattachment, or doubt the sincerity of one who owed to him so much. But that\r\nwhich more than all embittered Randal's feelings towards Egerton, was the\r\ncareful and deliberate frankness with which the latter had, more than once\r\nrepeated, and enforced the odious announcement, that Randal had nothing to\r\nexpect from the ministers--WILL, nothing to expect from that wealth which\r\nglared in the hungry eyes of the pauper heir to the Leslies of Rood. To\r\nwhom, then, could Egerton mean to devise his fortune? To whom but Frank\r\nHazeldean. Yet Audley took so little notice of his nephew--seemed so\r\nindifferent to him, that that supposition, however natural, seemed exposed\r\nto doubt. The astuteness of Randal was perplexed. Meanwhile, however, the\r\nless he himself could rely upon Egerton for fortune, the more he revolved\r\nthe possible chances of ousting Frank from the inheritance of Hazeldean--in\r\npart, at least, if not wholly. To one less scheming, crafty, and\r\nremorseless than Randal Leslie with every day became more and more, such a\r\nproject would have seemed the wildest delusion. But there was something\r\nfearful in the manner in which this young man sought to turn knowledge into\r\npower, and make the study of all weakness in others subservient to his own\r\nends. He wormed himself thoroughly into Frank's confidence. He learned\r\nthrough Frank all the Squire's peculiarities of thought and temper, and\r\nthoroughly pondered over each word in the father's letters, which the son\r\ngradually got into the habit of showing to the perfidious eyes of his\r\nfriend. Randal saw that the Squire had two characteristics which are very\r\ncommon amongst proprietors, and which might be invoked as antagonists to\r\nhis warm fatherly love. First, the Squire was as fond of his estate as if\r\nit were a living thing, and part of his own flesh and blood; and in his\r\nlectures to Frank upon the sin of extravagance, the Squire always let out\r\nthis foible:--\"What was to become of the estate if it fell into the hands\r\nof a spendthrift? No man should make ducks and drakes of Hazeldean; let\r\nFrank beware of _that_,\" &c. Secondly, the Squire was not only fond of his\r\nlands, but he was jealous of them--that jealousy which even the tenderest\r\nfather sometimes entertains towards their natural heirs. He could not bear\r\nthe notion that Frank should count on his death; and he seldom closed an\r\nadmonitory letter without repeating the information that Hazeldean was not\r\nentailed; that it was his to do with as he pleased through life and in\r\ndeath. Indirect menace of this nature rather wounded and galled than\r\nintimidated Frank; for the young man was extremely generous and\r\nhigh-spirited by nature, and was always more disposed to some indiscretion\r\nafter such warnings to his self-interest, as if to show that those were the\r\nlast kinds of appeal likely to influence him. By the help of such insights\r\ninto the character of father and son, Randal thought he saw gleams of\r\ndaylight illumining his own chance of the lands of Hazeldean. Meanwhile it\r\nappeared to him obvious that, come what might of it, his own interests\r\ncould not lose, and might most probably gain, by whatever could alienate\r\nthe Squire from his natural heir. Accordingly, though with consummate tact,\r\nhe instigated Frank towards the very excesses most calculated to irritate\r\nthe Squire, all the while appealing rather to give the counter advice, and\r\nnever sharing in any of the follies to which he conducted his thoughtless\r\nfriend. In this he worked chiefly through others, introducing Frank to\r\nevery acquaintance most dangerous to youth, either from the wit that\r\nlaughs at prudence, or the spurious magnificence that subsists so\r\nhandsomely upon bills endorsed by friends of \"great expectations.\"\r\n\r\nThe minister and his protege were seated at breakfast, the first reading\r\nthe newspaper, the last glancing over his letters; for Randal had arrived\r\nto the dignity of receiving many letters--ay, and notes too,\r\nthree-cornered, and fantastically embossed. Egerton uttered an exclamation,\r\nand laid down the paper. Randal looked up from his correspondence. The\r\nminister had sunk into one of his absent reveries.\r\n\r\nAfter a long silence, observing that Egerton did not return to the\r\nnewspaper, Randal said, \"Ehem--sir, I have a note from Frank Hazeldean, who\r\nwants much to see me; his father has arrived in town unexpectedly.\"\r\n\r\n\"What brings him here?\" asked Egerton, still abstractedly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it seems that he has heard some vague reports of poor Frank's\r\nextravagance, and Frank is either afraid or ashamed to meet him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay--a very great fault extravagance in the young!--destroys independence;\r\nruins or enslaves the future. Great fault--very! And what does youth want\r\nthat it should be extravagant? Has it not every thing in itself merely\r\nbecause it _is_? Youth is youth--what needs it more?\"\r\n\r\nEgerton rose as he said this, and retired to his writing-table, and in his\r\nturn opened his correspondence. Randal took up the newspaper, and\r\nendeavored, but in vain, to conjecture what had excited the minister's\r\nexclamation, and the reverie that succeeded it.\r\n\r\nEgerton suddenly and sharply turned round in his chair--\"If you have done\r\nwith the _Times_, have the goodness to place it here.\"\r\n\r\nRandal had just obeyed, when a knock at the street-door was heard, and\r\npresently Lord L'Estrange came into the room, with somewhat a quicker step,\r\nand somewhat a gayer mien than usual.\r\n\r\nAudley's hand, as if mechanically, fell upon the newspaper--fell upon that\r\npart of the columns devoted to births, deaths, and marriages. Randal stood\r\nby, and noted; then, bowing to L'Estrange, left the room.\r\n\r\n\"Audley,\" said L'Estrange, \"I have had an adventure since I saw you--an\r\nadventure that reopened the Past, and may influence my future.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, I have met with a relation of--of--the Avenels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! Whom--Richard Avenel?\"\r\n\r\n\"Richard--Richard--who is he? Oh, I remember; the wild lad who went off to\r\nAmerica; but that was when I was a mere child.\"\r\n\r\n\"That Richard Avenel is now a rich thriving trader, and his marriage is in\r\nthis newspaper--married to an honorable Mrs. M'Catchley. Well--in this\r\ncountry--who should plume himself on birth?\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not say so always, Egerton,\" replied Harley, with a tone of\r\nmournful reproach.\r\n\r\n\"And I say so now, pertinently to a Mrs. M'Catchley, not to the heir of the\r\nL'Estranges. But no more of these--these Avenels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, more of them. I tell you I have met a relation of theirs--a nephew\r\nof--of--\r\n\r\n\"Of Richard Avenel's?\" interrupted Egerton; and then added in the slow,\r\ndeliberate, argumentative tone in which he was wont to speak in public:\r\n\"Richard Avenel the trader! I saw him once--a presuming and intolerable\r\nman!\"\r\n\r\n\"The nephew has not those sins. He is full of promise, of modesty, yet of\r\npride. And his countenance--oh, Egerton, he has _her_ eyes.\"\r\n\r\nEgerton made no answer. And Harley resumed--\r\n\r\n\"I had thought of placing him under your care. I knew you would provide for\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will. Bring him hither,\" cried Egerton eagerly. \"All that I can do to\r\nprove my--regard for a wish of yours.\"\r\n\r\nHarley pressed his friend's hand warmly.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you from my heart; the Audley of my boyhood speaks now. But the\r\nyoung man has decided otherwise; and I do not blame him. Nay, I rejoice\r\nthat he chooses a career in which, if he find hardship, he may escape\r\ndependence.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that career is--\"\r\n\r\n\"Letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Letters--Literature!\" exclaimed the statesman. \"Beggary! No, no, Harley,\r\nthis is your absurd romance.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will not be beggary, and it is not my romance: it is the boy's. Leave\r\nhim alone, he is in my care and my charge henceforth. He is of _her_ blood,\r\nand I said that he had _her_ eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are going abroad; let me know where he is; I will watch over him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And unsettle a right ambition for a wrong one? No--you shall know nothing\r\nof him till he can proclaim himself. I think that day will come.\"\r\n\r\nAudley mused a moment, and then said, \"Well, perhaps you are right. After\r\nall, as you say, independence is a great blessing, and my ambition has not\r\nrendered myself the better or the happier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet, my poor Audley, you ask me to be ambitious.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only wish you to be consoled,\" cried Egerton with passion.\r\n\r\n\"I will try to be so; and by the help of a milder remedy than yours. I said\r\nthat my adventure might influence my future; it brought me acquainted not\r\nonly with the young man I speak of, but the most winning, affectionate\r\nchild--a girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this child an Avenel too?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she is of gentle blood--a soldier's daughter; the daughter of that\r\nCaptain Digby, on whose behalf I was a petitioner to your patronage. He is\r\ndead, and in dying, my name was on his lips. He meant me, doubtless, to be\r\nthe guardian to his orphan. I shall be so. I have at last an object in\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can you seriously mean to take this child with you abroad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seriously, I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And lodge her in your own house?\"\r\n\r\n\"For a year or so while she is yet a child. Then, as she approaches youth,\r\nI shall place her elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may grow to love her. Is it clear that she will love you?--not mistake\r\ngratitude for love? It is a very hazardous experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"So was William the Norman's--still he was William the Conqueror. Thou\r\nbiddest me move on from the past, and be consoled, yet thou wouldst make me\r\nas inapt to progress as the mule in Slawkenbergius's tale, with thy cursed\r\ninterlocutions, 'Stumbling, by St. Nicholas, every step. Why, at this rate,\r\nwe shall be all night getting into--' _Happiness!_ Listen,\" continued\r\nHarley, setting off, full pelt, into one of his wild whimsical humors. \"One\r\nof the sons of the prophets in Israel, felling wood near the River Jordan,\r\nhis hatchet forsook the helve, and fell to the bottom of the river; so he\r\nprayed to have it again, (it was but a small request, mark you;) and having\r\na strong faith, he did not throw the hatchet after the helve, but the helve\r\nafter the hatchet. Presently two great miracles were seen. Up springs the\r\nhatchet from the bottom of the water, and fixes itself to its old\r\nacquaintance, the helve. Now, had he wished to coach it to Heaven in a\r\nfiery chariot like Elias, be as rich as Job, strong as Samson, and\r\nbeautiful as Absalom, would he have obtained it, do you think? In truth, my\r\nfriend, I question it very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot comprehend what you mean. Sad stuff you are talking.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't help that; Rabelais is to be blamed for it. I am quoting him, and\r\nit is to be found in his prologue to the chapters on the Moderation of\r\nWishes. And apropos of 'moderate wishes in point of hatchet,' I want you to\r\nunderstand that I ask but little from Heaven. I fling but the helve after\r\nthe hatchet that has sunk into the silent stream. I want the other half of\r\nthe weapon that is buried fathom deep, and for want of which the thick\r\nwoods darken round me by the Sacred River, and I can catch not a glimpse of\r\nthe stars.\"\r\n\r\n\"In plain English,\" said Audley Egerton, \"you want\"--he stopped short,\r\npuzzled.\r\n\r\n\"I want my purpose and my will, and my old character, and the nature God\r\ngave me. I want the half of my soul which has fallen from me. I want such\r\nlove as may replace to me the vanished affections. Reason not--I throw the\r\nhelve after the hatchet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nRandal Leslie, on leaving Audley, repaired to Frank's lodgings, and after\r\nbeing closeted with the young guardsman an hour or so, took his way to\r\nLimmer's hotel, and asked for Mr. Hazeldean. He was shown into the\r\ncoffee-room, while the waiter went up stairs with his card, to see if the\r\nSquire was within, and disengaged. The _Times_ newspaper lay sprawling on\r\none of the tables, and Randal, leaning over it, looked with attention into\r\nthe column containing births, deaths, and marriages. But in that long and\r\nmiscellaneous list, he could not conjecture the name which had so excited\r\nMr. Egerton's interest.\r\n\r\n\"Vexatious!\" he muttered; \"there is no knowledge which has power more\r\nuseful than that of the secrets of men.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned as the waiter entered, and said that Mr. Hazeldean would be glad\r\nto see him.\r\n\r\nAs Randal entered the drawing-room, the Squire shaking hands with him,\r\nlooked towards the door as if expecting some one else, and his honest face\r\nassumed a blank expression of disappointment when the door closed, and he\r\nfound that Randal was unaccompanied.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he bluntly, \"I thought your old school-fellow, Frank, might\r\nhave been with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have not you seen him yet, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I came to town this morning; travelled outside the mail; sent to his\r\nbarracks, but the young gentleman does not sleep there--has an apartment of\r\nhis own; he never told me that. We are a plain family, the\r\nHazeldeans--young sir; and I hate being kept in the dark, by my own son\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nRandal made no answer, but looked sorrowful. The Squire, who had never\r\nbefore seen his kinsman, had a vague idea that it was not quite polite to\r\nentertain a stranger, though a connection to himself, with his family\r\ntroubles, and so resumed good-naturedly:\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to make your acquaintance at last, Mr. Leslie. You know, I\r\nhope, that you have good Hazeldean blood in your veins?\"\r\n\r\n_Randal_, (smilingly).--\"I am not likely to forget that; it is the boast of\r\nour pedigree.\"\r\n\r\n_Squire_, (heartily.)--\"Shake hands again on it, my boy. You don't want a\r\nfriend, since my grandee of a half-brother has taken you up; but if ever\r\nyou should, Hazeldean is not very far from Rood. Can't get on with your\r\nfather at all, my lad--more's the pity, for I think I could have given him\r\na hint or two as to the improvement of his property. If he would plant\r\nthose ugly commons--larch and fir soon come into profit, sir; and there are\r\nsome low lands about Rood that would take mighty kindly to draining.\"\r\n\r\n_Randal._--\"My poor father lives a life so retired, and you cannot wonder\r\nat it. Fallen trees lie still, and so do fallen families.\"\r\n\r\n_Squire._--\"Fallen families can get up again, which fallen trees can't.\"\r\n\r\n_Randal._--\"Ah, sir, it often takes the energy of generations to repair\r\nthe thriftlessness and extravagance of a single owner.\"\r\n\r\n_Squire_, (his brow lowering.)--\"That's very true. Frank _is_ d----d\r\nextravagant; treats me very coolly, too--not coming; near three o'clock. By\r\nthe by, I suppose he told you where I was, otherwise how did you find me\r\nout!\"\r\n\r\n_Randal_, (reluctantly.)--\"Sir, he did; and, to speak frankly, I am not\r\nsurprised that he has not yet appeared.\"\r\n\r\n_Squire._--\"Eh?\"\r\n\r\n_Randal._--\"We have grown very intimate.\"\r\n\r\n_Squire._--\"So he writes me word--and I am glad of it. Our member, Sir\r\nJohn, tells me you are a very clever fellow, and a very steady one. And\r\nFrank says that he wishes he had your prudence, if he can't have your\r\ntalents. He has a good heart, Frank,\" added the father, relentingly. \"But,\r\nzounds, sir, you say you are not surprised he has not come to welcome his\r\nown father?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" said Randal, \"you wrote word to Frank that you had heard\r\nfrom Sir John and others, of his goings-on, and that you were not satisfied\r\nwith his replies to your letters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then you suddenly come up to town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well. And Frank is ashamed to meet you. For, as you say, he has been\r\nextravagant, and he has exceeded his allowance; and, knowing my respect for\r\nyou, and my great affection for himself, he has asked me to prepare you to\r\nreceive his confession and forgive him. I know I am taking a great liberty.\r\nI have no right to interfere between father and son; but pray--pray think I\r\nmean for the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph!\" said the Squire, recovering himself very slowly, and showing\r\nevident pain. \"I knew already that Frank had spent more than he ought; but\r\nI think he should not have employed a third person to prepare me to forgive\r\nhim. (Excuse me--no offence.) And if he wanted a third person, was not\r\nthere his own mother? What the devil!--(firing up)--am I a tyrant--a\r\nbashaw--that my own son is afraid to speak to me? Gad, I'll give it him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, sir,\" said Randal, assuming at once that air of authority which\r\nsuperior intellect so well carries off and excuses. \"But I strongly advise\r\nyou not to express any anger at Frank's confidence in me. At present I have\r\ninfluence over him. Whatever you may think of his extravagance, I have\r\nsaved him from many an indiscretion, and many a debt--a young man will\r\nlisten to one of his own age so much more readily than even to the kindest\r\nfriend of graver years. Indeed, sir, I speak for your sake as well as for\r\nFrank's. Let me keep this influence over him; and don't reproach him for\r\nthe confidence he placed in me. Nay, let him rather think that I have\r\nsoftened any displeasure you might otherwise have felt.\"\r\n\r\nThere seemed so much good sense in what Randal said, and the kindness of it\r\nseemed so disinterested, that the Squire's native shrewdness was deceived.\r\n\r\n\"You are a fine young fellow,\" said he, \"and I am very much obliged to you.\r\nWell, I suppose there is no putting old heads upon young shoulders; and I\r\npromise you I'll not say an angry word to Frank. I dare say, poor boy, he\r\nis very much afflicted, and I long to shake hands with him. So, set his\r\nmind at ease.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, sir,\" said Randal, with much apparent emotion, \"your son may well love\r\nyou; and it seems to be a hard matter for so kind a heart as yours to\r\npreserve the proper firmness with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I can be firm enough,\" quoth the squire--\"especially when I don't see\r\nhim--handsome dog that he is--very like his mother--don't you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never saw his mother, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gad! Not seen my Harry! No more you have; you must come and pay us a\r\nvisit. We have your grandmother's picture, when she was a girl, with a\r\ncrook in one hand and a bunch of lilies in the other. I suppose my\r\nhalf-brother will let you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, sir. Will you not call on him while you are in town?\r\n\r\n\"Not I. He would think I expected to get something from the Government.\r\nTell him the ministers must go on a little better, if they want my vote for\r\ntheir member. But go. I see you are impatient to tell Frank that all's\r\nforgot and forgiven. Come and dine with him here at six, and let him bring\r\nhis bills in his pocket. Oh, I shan't scold him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, as to that,\" said Randal, smiling, \"I think (forgive me still) that\r\nyou should not take it too easily; just as I think that you had better not\r\nblame him for his very natural and praiseworthy shame in approaching you,\r\nso I think, also, that you should do nothing that would tend to diminish\r\nthat shame--it is such a check on him. And therefore, if you can contrive\r\nto affect to be angry with him for his extravagance, it will do good.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak like a book, and I'll try my best.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you threaten, for instance, to take him out of the army, and settle him\r\nin the country, it would have a very good effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! would he think it so great a punishment to come home and live with\r\nhis parents?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't say that; but he is naturally so fond of London. At his age, and\r\nwith his large inheritance, _that_ is natural.\"\r\n\r\n\"Inheritance!\" said the Squire, moodily--\"inheritance! he is not thinking\r\nof that, I trust? Zounds, sir, I have as good a life as his own.\r\nInheritance!--to be sure the Casino property is entailed on him; but, as\r\nfor the rest, sir, I am no tenant for life. I could leave the Hazeldean\r\nlands to my ploughman, if I chose it. Inheritance, indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir, I did not mean to imply that Frank would entertain the\r\nunnatural and monstrous idea of calculating on your death; and all we have\r\nto do is to get him to sow his wild oats as soon as possible--marry, and\r\nsettle down into the country. For it would be a thousand pities if his town\r\nhabits and tastes grew permanent--a bad thing for the Hazeldean property,\r\nthat. And,\" added Randal, laughing, \"I feel an interest in the old place,\r\nsince my grandmother comes of the stock. So, just force yourself to seem\r\nangry, and grumble a little when you pay the bills.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, ah, trust me,\" said the Squire, doggedly and with a very altered air,\r\n\"I am much obliged to you for these hints, my young kinsman.\" And his stout\r\nhand trembled a little as he extended it to Randal.\r\n\r\nLeaving Limmer's, Randal hastened to Frank's rooms in St. James's Street.\r\n\"My dear fellow,\" said he, when he entered, \"it is very fortunate that I\r\npersuaded you to let me break matters to your father. You might well say he\r\nwas rather passionate; but I have contrived to soothe him. You need not\r\nfear that he will not pay your debts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never feared that,\" said Frank changing color; \"I only fear his anger.\r\nBut, indeed, I feared his kindness still more. What a reckless hound I have\r\nbeen! However, it shall be a lesson to me. And my debts once paid, I will\r\nturn as economical as yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right, Frank. And, indeed, I am a little afraid that when your\r\nfather knows the total, he may execute a threat that would be very\r\nunpleasant to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Make you sell out, and give up London.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" exclaimed Frank, with fervent emphasis; \"that would be\r\ntreating me like a child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it _would_ make you seem rather ridiculous to your set, which is not\r\na very rural one. And you, who like London so much, and are so much the\r\nfashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk of it,\" cried Frank, walking to and fro the room in great\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps on the whole, it might be well not to say all you owe, at once. If\r\nyou named half the sum, your father would let you off with a lecture; and\r\nreally I tremble at the effect of the total.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how shall I pay the other half?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you must save from your allowance; it is a very liberal one; and the\r\ntradesmen are not pressing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--but the cursed bill-brokers\"--\r\n\r\n\"Always renew to a young man of your expectations. And if I get into an\r\noffice, I can always help you, my dear Frank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Randal, I am not so bad as to take advantage of your friendship,\" said\r\nFrank warmly. \"But it seems to me mean, after all, and a sort of a lie,\r\nindeed, disguising the real state of my affairs. I should not have listened\r\nto the idea from any one else. But you are such a sensible, kind, honorable\r\nfellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"After epithets so flattering, I shrink from the responsibility of advice.\r\nBut apart from your own interests, I should be glad to save your father the\r\npain he would feel at knowing the whole extent of the scrape you have got\r\ninto. And if it entailed on you the necessity to lay by--and give up\r\nhazard, and not be security for other men--why it would be the best thing\r\nthat could happen. Really, too, it seems hard on Mr. Hazeldean, that he\r\nshould be the only sufferer, and quite just that you should bear half your\r\nown burdens.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is, Randal; that did not strike me before. I will take your counsel;\r\nand now I will go at once to Limmer's. My dear father! I hope he is looking\r\nwell?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very. Such a contrast to the sallow Londoners! But I think you had\r\nbetter not go till dinner. He has asked me to meet you at six. I will call\r\nfor you a little before, and we can go together. This will prevent a great\r\ndeal of _gene_ and constraint. Good-bye till then.--Ha!--by the way, I\r\nthink if I were you, I would not take the matter too seriously and\r\npenitentially. You see the best of fathers like to keep their sons under\r\ntheir thumb, as the saying is. And if you want at your age to preserve your\r\nindependence, and not be hurried off and buried in the country, like a\r\nschool-boy in disgrace, a little manliness of bearing would not be amiss.\r\nYou can think over it.\"\r\n\r\nThe dinner at Limmer's went off very differently from what it ought to have\r\ndone. Randal's words had sunk deep, and rankled sorely in the Squire's\r\nmind; and that impression imparted a certain coldness to his manner which\r\nbelied the hearty, forgiving, generous impulse with which he had come up to\r\nLondon, and which even Randal had not yet altogether whispered away. On the\r\nother hand, Frank, embarrassed both by the sense of disingenuousness, and a\r\ndesire \"not to take the thing too seriously,\" seemed to the Squire\r\nungracious and thankless.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, the Squire began to hum and haw, and Frank to color up and\r\nshrink. Both felt discomposed by the presence of a third person; till, with\r\nan art and address worthy of a better cause, Randal himself broke the ice,\r\nand so contrived to remove the restraint he had before imposed, that at\r\nlength each was heartily glad to have matters made clear and brief by his\r\ndexterity and tact.\r\n\r\nFrank's debts were not in reality, large; and when he named the half of\r\nthem--looking down in shame--the Squire, agreeably surprised, was about to\r\nexpress himself with a liberal heartiness that would have opened his son's\r\nexcellent heart at once to him. But a warning look from Randal checked the\r\nimpulse; and the Squire thought it right, as he had promised, to affect an\r\nanger he did not feel, and let fall the unlucky threat, \"that it was all\r\nvery well once in a way to exceed his allowance; but if Frank did not, in\r\nfuture, show more sense than to be led away by a set of London sharks and\r\ncoxcombs, he must cut the army, come home, and take to farming.\"\r\n\r\nFrank imprudently exclaimed, \"Oh, sir, I have no taste for farming. And\r\nafter London, at my age, the country would be so horribly dull.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" said the Squire, very grimly--and he thrust back into his\r\npocket-book some extra bank-notes which his fingers had itched to add to\r\nthose he had already counted out. \"The country is terribly dull, is it?\r\nMoney goes there not upon follies and vices, but upon employing honest\r\nlaborers, and increasing the wealth of the nation. It does not please you\r\nto spend money in that way: it is a pity you should ever be plagued with\r\nsuch duties.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear father--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue, you puppy. Oh, I dare say, if you were in my shoes, you\r\nwould cut down the oaks, and mortgage the property--sell it, for what I\r\nknow--all go on a cast of the dice! Aha, sir--very well, very well--the\r\ncountry is horribly dull, is it? Pray, stay in town.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mr. Hazeldean,\" said Randal, blandly, and as if with the wish to\r\nturn off into a joke what threatened to be serious, \"you must not interpret\r\na hasty expression so literally. Why, you would make Frank as bad as Lord\r\nA----, who wrote word to his steward to cut down more timber; and when the\r\nsteward replied, 'There are only three signposts left on the whole estate,'\r\nwrote back, '_They've_ done growing, at all events--'down with them.' You\r\nought to know Lord A----, sir; so witty; and Frank's particular friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your particular friend, Master Frank? Pretty friends!\"--and the Squire\r\nbuttoned up the pocket, to which he had transferred his note-book, with a\r\ndetermined air.\r\n\r\n\"But I'm his friend, too,\" said Randal, kindly; \"and I preach to him\r\nproperly, I can tell you.\" Then, as if delicately anxious to change the\r\nsubject, he began to ask questions upon crops, and the experiment of bone\r\nmanure. He spoke earnestly, and with _gusto_, yet with the deference of one\r\nlistening to a great practical authority. Randal had spent the afternoon in\r\ncramming the subject from agricultural journals and Parliamentary reports;\r\nand, like all practised readers, had really learned in a few hours more\r\nthan many a man, unaccustomed to study, could gain from books in a year.\r\nThe Squire was surprised and pleased at the young scholar's information and\r\ntaste for such subjects.\r\n\r\n\"But, to be sure,\" quoth he, with an angry look at poor Frank, \"you have\r\ngood Hazeldean blood in you, and know a bean from a turnip.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir,\" said Randal, ingenuously, \"I am training myself for public\r\nlife; and what is a public man worth if he do not study the agriculture of\r\nhis country?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right--what is he worth? Put that question, with my compliments, to my\r\nhalf-brother. What stuff he did talk, the other night, on the malt tax, to\r\nbe sure!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Egerton has had so many other things to think of, that we must excuse\r\nhis want of information upon one topic, however important. With his strong\r\nsense, he must acquire that information, sooner or later; for he is fond of\r\npower; and, sir,--knowledge is power!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true;--very fine saying,\" quoth the poor Squire, unsuspiciously, as\r\nRandal's eye rested upon Mr. Hazeldean's open face, and then glanced\r\ntowards Frank, who looked sad and bored.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" repeated Randal, \"knowledge is power;\" and he shook his head wisely,\r\nas he passed the bottle to his host.\r\n\r\nStill, when the Squire, who meant to return to the Hall next morning, took\r\nleave of Frank, his heart warmed to his son; and still more for Frank's\r\ndejected looks. It was not Randal's policy to push estrangement too far at\r\nfirst, and in his own presence.\r\n\r\n\"Speak to poor Frank--kindly now, sir--do;\" whispered he, observing the\r\nSquire's watery eyes, as he moved to the window.\r\n\r\nThe Squire rejoiced to obey--thrust out his hand to his son--\"My dear boy,\"\r\nsaid he, \"there, don't fret--pshaw!--it was but a trifle after all. Think\r\nno more of it.\"\r\n\r\nFrank took the hand, and suddenly threw his arm round his father's broad\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir, you are too good--too good.\" His voice trembled so, that Randal\r\ntook alarm, passed by him, and touched him meaningly.\r\n\r\nThe Squire pressed his son to his heart--heart so large, that it seemed to\r\nfill the whole width under his broadcloth.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Frank,\" said he, half blubbering, \"it is not the money; but, you\r\nsee, it so vexes your poor mother; you must be careful in future; and,\r\nzounds, boy, it will be all yours one day; only don't calculate on it; I\r\ncould not bear _that_--I could not, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Calculate!\" cried Frank. \"Oh, sir, can you think it!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so delighted that I had some slight hand in your complete\r\nreconciliation with Mr. Hazeldean,\" said Randal, as the young men walked\r\nfrom the hotel. \"I saw that you were disheartened, and I told him to speak\r\nto you kindly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you? Ah, I am sorry he needed telling.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know his character so well already,\" said Randal, \"that I flatter myself\r\nI can always keep things between you as they ought to be. What an excellent\r\nman!\"\r\n\r\n\"The best man in the world!\" cried Frank, heartily; and then as his accent\r\ndrooped, \"yet I have deceived him. I have a great mind to go back--\"\r\n\r\n\"And tell him to give you twice as much money as you had asked for. He\r\nwould think you had only seemed so affectionate in order to take him in.\r\nNo, no, Frank; save--lay by--economize; and then tell him that you have\r\npaid half your own debts. Something high-minded in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"So there is. Your heart is as good as your head. Good night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going home so early? Have you no engagements?\"\r\n\r\n\"None that I shall keep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good night, then.\"\r\n\r\nThey parted, and Randal walked into one of the fashionable clubs. He neared\r\na table, where three or four young men (younger sons, who lived in the most\r\nsplendid style, heaven knew how) were still over their wine.\r\n\r\nLeslie had little in common with these gentlemen; but he forced his nature\r\nto be agreeable to them, in consequence of a very excellent piece of\r\nworldly advice given to him by Audley Egerton. \"Never let the dandies call\r\nyou a prig,\" said the statesman. \"Many a clever fellow fails through life,\r\nbecause the silly fellows, whom half a word well spoken could make his\r\n_claqueurs_, turn him into ridicule. Whatever you are, avoid the fault of\r\nmost reading men: in a word, don't be a prig!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have just left Hazeldean,\" said Randal--\"what a good fellow he is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital,\" said the honorable George Borrowwell. \"Where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he is gone to his rooms. He has had a little scene with his father, a\r\nthorough, rough country squire. It would be an act of charity if you would\r\ngo and keep him company, or take him with you to some place a little more\r\nlively than his own lodgings.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! the old gentleman has been teasing him?--a horrid shame! Why, Frank\r\nis not expensive, and he will be very rich--eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"An immense property,\" said Randal, \"and not a mortgage on it; an only\r\nson,\" he added, turning away.\r\n\r\nAmong these young gentlemen there was a kindly and most benevolent whisper,\r\nand presently they all rose, and walked away towards Frank's lodgings.\r\n\r\n\"The wedge is in the tree,\" said Randal to himself, \"and there is a gap\r\nalready between the bark and the wood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nHarley L'Estrange is seated beside Helen at the lattice-window in the\r\ncottage at Norwood. The bloom of reviving health is on the child's face,\r\nand she is listening with a smile, for Harley is speaking of Leonard with\r\npraise, and of Leonard's future with hope. \"And thus,\" he continued,\r\n\"secure from his former trials, happy in his occupation, and pursuing the\r\ncareer he has chosen, we must be content, my dear child, to leave him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave him!\" exclaimed Helen, and the rose on her cheek faded.\r\n\r\nHarley was not displeased to see her emotion. He would have been\r\ndisappointed in her heart if it had been less susceptible to affection.\r\n\r\n\"It is hard on you, Helen,\" said he, \"to separate you from one who has been\r\nto you as a brother. Do not hate me for doing so. But I consider myself\r\nyour guardian, and your home as yet must be mine. We are going from this\r\nland of cloud and mist, going as into the world of summer. Well, that does\r\nnot content you. You weep, my child; you mourn your own friend, but do not\r\nforget your father's. I am alone, and often sad, Helen; will you not\r\ncomfort me? You press my hand, but you must learn to smile on me also. You\r\nare born to be the Comforter. Comforters are not egotists; they are always\r\ncheerful when they console.\"\r\n\r\nThe voice of Harley was so sweet, and his words went so home to the child's\r\nheart, that she looked up and smiled in his face as he kissed her ingenuous\r\nbrow. But then she thought of Leonard, and felt so solitary--so\r\nbereft--that tears burst forth again. Before these were dried, Leonard\r\nhimself entered, and obeying an irresistible impulse, she sprang to his\r\narms, and, leaning her head on his shoulder, sobbed out, \"I am going from\r\nyou, brother--do not grieve--do not miss me.\"\r\n\r\nHarley was much moved: he folded his arms, and contemplated them both\r\nsilently--and his own eyes were moist, \"This heart,\" thought he, \"will be\r\nworth the winning!\"\r\n\r\nHe drew aside Leonard, and whispered, \"Soothe but encourage and support\r\nher. I leave you together; come to me in the garden later.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nearly an hour before Leonard joined Harley.\r\n\r\n\"She was not weeping when you left her?\" asked L'Estrange.\r\n\r\n\"No; she has more fortitude than we might suppose. Heaven knows how that\r\nfortitude has supported mine. I have promised to write to her often.\"\r\n\r\nHarley took two strides across the lawn, and then, coming back to Leonard,\r\nsaid, \"Keep your promise, and write often for the first year. I would then\r\nask you to let the correspondence drop gradually.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drop!--Ah, my lord!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look you, my young friend, I wish to lead this fair mind wholly from the\r\nsorrows of the Past. I wish Helen to enter, not abruptly, but step by step,\r\ninto a new life. You love each other now as do two children--as brother and\r\nsister. But later, if encouraged, would the love be the same? And is it not\r\nbetter for both of you, that youth should open upon the world with youth's\r\nnatural affections free and unforestalled?\"\r\n\r\n\"True! and she is so above me,\" said Leonard, mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"No one is above him who succeeds in your ambition, Leonard. It is not\r\n_that_, believe me!\"\r\n\r\nLeonard shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Harley, with a smile, \"I rather feel that you are above me.\r\nFor what vantage-ground is so high as youth? Perhaps I may become jealous\r\nof you. It is well that she should learn to like one who is to be\r\nhenceforth her guardian and protector. Yet, how can she like me as she\r\nought, if her heart is to be full of you?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy bowed his head; and Harley hastened to change the subject, and\r\nspeak of letters and of glory. His words were eloquent, and his voice\r\nkindling; for he had been an enthusiast for fame in his boyhood; and in\r\nLeonard's his own seemed to him to revive. But the poet's heart gave back\r\nno echo--suddenly it seemed void and desolate. Yet when Leonard walked back\r\nby the moonlight, he muttered to himself, \"Strange--strange--so mere a\r\nchild, this cannot be love! Still what else to love is there left to me?\"\r\n\r\nAnd so he paused upon the bridge where he had so often stood with Helen,\r\nand on which he had found the protector that had given to her a home--to\r\nhimself a career. And life seemed very long, and fame but a dreary phantom.\r\nCourage, still, Leonard! These are the sorrows of the heart that teach thee\r\nmore than all the precepts of sage and critic.\r\n\r\nAnother day, and Helen had left the shores of England, with her fanciful\r\nand dreaming guardian. Years will pass before our tale reopens. Life in all\r\nthe forms we have seen it travels on. And the Squire farms and hunts; and\r\nthe Parson preaches and chides and soothes. And Riccabocca reads his\r\nMachiavelli, and sighs and smiles as he moralizes on Men and States. And\r\nViolante's dark eyes grow deeper and more spiritual in their lustre; and\r\nher beauty takes thought from solitary dreams. And Mr. Richard Avenel has\r\nhis house in London, and the honorable Mrs. Avenel her opera box; and hard\r\nand dire is their struggle into fashion, and hotly does the new man,\r\nscorning the aristocracy, to pant become aristocrat. And Audley Egerton\r\ngoes from the office to the Parliament, and drudges, and debates, and helps\r\nto govern the empire in which the sun never sets. Poor Sun, how tired he\r\nmust be--but none more tired than the Government! And Randal Leslie has an\r\nexcellent place in the bureau of a minister, and is looking to the time\r\nwhen he shall resign it to come into Parliament, and on that large arena\r\nturn knowledge into power. And meanwhile, he is much where he was with\r\nAudley Egerton; but he has established intimacy with the Squire, and\r\nvisited Hazeldean twice, and examined the house and the map of the\r\nproperty--and very nearly fallen a second time into the Ha-ha, and the\r\nSquire believes that Randal Leslie alone can keep Frank out of mischief,\r\nand has spoken rough words to his Harry about Frank's continued\r\nextravagance. And Frank does continue to pursue pleasure, and is very\r\nmiserable, and horribly in debt. And Madame di Negra has gone from London\r\nto Paris, and taken a tour into Switzerland, and come back to London again,\r\nand has grown very intimate with Randal Leslie; and Randal has introduced\r\nFrank to her; and Frank thinks her the loveliest woman in the world, and\r\ngrossly slandered by certain evil tongues. And the brother of Madame di\r\nNegra is expected in England at least; and what with his repute for beauty\r\nand for wealth, people anticipate a sensation; and Leonard, and Harley, and\r\nHelen? Patience--they will all reappear.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Continued from page 386.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRAGMENTS FROM A VOLUME OF POEMS\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS LOVELL BEDDOES.\r\n\r\n[Just Published in London.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTHING ALONE.\r\n\r\n    All round and through the spaces of creation\r\n    No hiding-place of the least air, or earth,\r\n    Or sea, invisible, untrod, unrained on,\r\n    Contains a thing alone.

This work\r\nrefers more especially to the years 1833-37, during which time, as is well\r\nknown, Immerman attempted to establish in Duesseldorf an _ideal_ theatre,\r\nsomewhat in the style of that at Weimar.\" We have frequently, in\r\nconversation with a gentleman who held an appointment in this Duesseldorf\r\n_Ideal Theatre_, received amusing and interesting accounts of Immerman's\r\nstyle of management. That his plan did not succeed is undoubtedly for the\r\nsake of Art to be regretted; yet we can by no means unconditionally approve\r\nof the ideas upon which Immerman based his theories. He was certainly right\r\nin endeavoring to form a unity of style in dramatic representations; but\r\nhow he could have deemed such an unity possible, when grounded upon such\r\ndiametrically opposed aesthetic bases as those of Shakespeare and Calderon,\r\nis to us unintelligible. The remarks on the most convenient and practical\r\nstyle of executing certain pieces--for example, Hamlet--are worthy of\r\nattention, as also a few explanations relative to Immerman's own dramatic\r\nconceptions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKOHL, whose innumerable and well-known books of travel have caused him to\r\nbe cited even in book-making Germany as an instance of _Ausserordentlichen\r\nFruchtbarkeit_, or extraordinary fertility, has published, through Kuntze\r\nof Dresden, yet another work, entitled _Sketches of Nature and Popular\r\nLife_, which is however said to be inferior to the average of his\r\nworks--principally, we imagine, from his falling into the besetting sin of\r\nGerman writers since the late revolutions, namely, of talking politics when\r\nhe should have quoted poetry. We should not be surprised to find some day a\r\ntreatise on qualitative chemistry, commencing with an analysis of the\r\nPrussian constitution, or an anatomical work, concluding with a dissection\r\nof Germany in general. Kohl possesses, however, great faculties of\r\nobservation, is an accurate describer, and has, perhaps, done as much as\r\nany man of the age towards making different countries acquainted with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe friends of the Italian language and literature, will do well to cast an\r\noccasional kindly glance on _L'Eco d'Italia_ (The Echo of Italy), an\r\nexcellent weekly paper published by Signor SECCHI DE CASALI, in this city,\r\nat number 289 Broadway. Many admirable poems find their way from time to\r\ntime into this periodical, while its foreign correspondence is of a high\r\norder of merit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Polish authoress NARCISA ZWICHOWSKA, well known to all who are\r\nacquainted with the literature of that country, has received from the\r\nRussian authorities an order to enter a convent, and no longer to occupy\r\nherself with literature, but with labors of a manual kind, which are more\r\nbecoming to women. She is to receive from the treasury a silver ruble, or\r\nabout sixty-two and a half cents a day for her support.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCooking is no doubt a great science, and its chief prophet is undeniably\r\nEUGENE BARON BAERST. This gentleman, who is well known in Germany and\r\nelsewhere for his gallant services in Spain, in the army of Don Carlos, has\r\njust brought out a work in two volumes, of some six hundred and fifty pages\r\neach, entitled _Gastrosophie, oder die Lehre von den Freuden der Tafel_\r\n(Gastrosophy, or the Doctrine of the Delights of the Table). In this he\r\nevinces a thoroughness of knowledge and a fire of enthusiasm well\r\ncalculated to astonish the reader, who has probably not before been aware\r\nof the grandeur of the subjects discussed. He begins with the very elements\r\nof his theme. \"The man,\" he exclaims in his preface, \"who undertakes to\r\nwrite a cook-book, must begin by teaching the mason how to build a\r\nfire-place, so as not merely to produce heat from above or below, but from\r\nboth at once; he must teach the butcher how to cut his meat, and above all\r\nthe baker how to make bread, and especially the _semmel_ (a sort of small\r\nloaves with caraway or anise seed, much liked in Germany), which are often\r\nvery like leather and perfectly indigestible. It is true that in Psalm CIV.\r\nverse 15, we are told that bread strengthens the heart of man, but the\r\nsemmel sort does no such thing; and when Linguet affirms,--and it is one of\r\nthe greatest paradoxes I know of,--that bread is a noxious article of food,\r\nhe must be thinking of just that kind. Further, it is necessary to instruct\r\nthe gardener, the vegetable woman, the cattle dealer and feeder, and a\r\nhundred other people down to the scullion, who must learn to chop the\r\nspinage very fine and rub and tie it well, and also not to wash the salad,\r\n&c. And this is all the more necessary, because bad workmen,--and their\r\nname is legion,--love no sort of instruction, but fancy that they already\r\nknow every thing better than anybody else.\" To this extensive and thankless\r\nwork of instruction, the Baron declares that he has devoted himself, and\r\nthat the iron will necessary to its accomplishment is his. The iron health\r\nis however wanting, and accordingly he can do nothing better for \"the\r\nfatherland's artists in eating\" than the present work. At the last advices,\r\nthe valiant Baron was dangerously ill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWorks on natural history and philosophy seldom possess much interest for\r\nthe uninitiated in \"the physically practical.\" An exception to this may\r\nhowever be found in the beautiful _Schmetterlingsbuch_, or _Butterfly\r\nbook_, recently published by Hoffman of Stuttgart, containing eleven\r\nhundred colored illustrations of these \"winged flowers,\" as the Chinese\r\npoetically term them. Equally attractive to every lover of exquisite works\r\nof scientific art, is the recent American _Pomology_, edited by Dr.\r\nBRINCKLE of Philadelphia, and published by Hoffy of that city. This, we\r\nstate on the authority of the Philadelphia Art-Union Reporter, is the most\r\nsplendid work of the kind ever published in this country or Europe, with a\r\nsingle exception, which was issued under royal patronage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA valuable and useful book in these times is STEIN'S _Geschichte der\r\nsocialen Bewegung in Frankreich von 1789 bis auf unsere Tage_ (History of\r\nthe Social Movement in France from 1789 to our day). It is in three\r\nvolumes, published at Leipzig. The _Socialismus und Communismus_ of the\r\nsame author has given him a wide reputation for impartiality and\r\nthoroughness, which the present work must confirm and extend. We do not\r\ncoincide in all his views, historical or critical, but cordially recommend\r\nhim to the study of all who desire to inform themselves as to one of the\r\nmost important phases of modern history.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn interesting work entitled _Die Macht des Kleinen_, or _The power of the\r\nLittle, as shown in the formation of the crust of our earth-ball_, has\r\nrecently been translated from the Dutch of _Schwartzkopt_, by Dr. SCHLEIDEN\r\nof Leipzig. This book treats entirely of the works and wonders effected by\r\nthat \"invisible brotherhood\" of architects, the _animalculae_, and shows how\r\ngreatly the organic world is indebted to coral insects, _foraminiferae_,\r\npolypi, and other cryptic beings, for its existence and progress. The\r\nillustrations are truly admirable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the recent publications at Halle, is a heavy octavo by Dr. J. H.\r\nKRAUSE, on the _History of Education, Instruction and Culture among the\r\nGreeks, Etruscans and Romans_. It is drawn from the original sources, and\r\nis the result of a most studious and thorough investigation of the subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very intelligent young priest, by name JOSEPH LUTZ, has recently\r\npublished by Laupp of Tuebingen, a _Handbook of Catholic Pulpit Eloquence_.\r\nThis work will be found highly interesting to those desirous of\r\ninvestigating the history and theories of modern eloquence. We were already\r\naware that in New-England smoking and whistling are regarded as vices, but\r\nfirst learned from the prospectus of this work that, according to Theremin,\r\neloquence is a _virtue_!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA collection of the popular songs of Southern Russia is now being published\r\nat Moscow by Mr. MAKSIMOWITSCH, who for twenty years has been in the\r\nUkraine, engaged in taking down and preserving these interesting products\r\nof the early life of his people in that region. This is not the first\r\ncontribution of the kind that he has made to Russian literature; in 1827 he\r\npublished the _Songs of Little Russia_, consisting of one hundred and\r\nthirty pieces for male and female voices; in 1834 the _Popular Songs of the\r\nUkraine_, consisting of one hundred and thirteen songs for men; and in the\r\nsame year the _Voices of Ukraine Song_, twenty-five pieces with music. The\r\npresent work is called by way of distinction _Collectaneum of Ukraine\r\nPopular Songs_; it is to be in six parts, containing about two thousand\r\nnational poems. Each part is to be accompanied with explanatory notes, and\r\nthe last volume will contain an essay on Russian popular poetry in general,\r\nas well as on that of the Ukraine in particular. One volume has already\r\nappeared; it is in two divisions: the first of Ukraine _Dumy_, the second\r\nof cradle songs and lullabys. The _Dumy_ are a particular sort of poems\r\npeculiar to the Ukraine. They are in a most irregular measure, varying from\r\nfour to twelve syllables, with the cadence varying in each line. The only\r\nrequirement is that they should rhyme, and frequently several successive\r\nlines are made to do so. These poems are the production of the\r\n_Vandurists_, or bards of the country, who are even yet found on the\r\nsouthern shore of the Dnieper. These singers, usually blind old men, chant\r\ntheir _Dumy_ and their songs to the people, accompanying themselves with\r\nboth hands on the many-stringed _vandura_. The _Dumy_ flourished most in\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. There are some existing composed\r\nby Mazeppa after the battle of Pultowa, and one or two other poets have\r\nleft a _Dumy_ of the eighteenth, but they are not equal to those of more\r\nprimitive times. Since then there have been no new compositions in the way\r\nof popular songs and ballads, but the older works have been repeated with\r\nvariations and to new melodies. The most frequent subjects of these ballads\r\nwere, of course, historic personages and warlike deeds; but often they sung\r\nof domestic matters and feelings, winding up with a moral for the benefit\r\nof the young. In this volume of Mr. Maksimowitsch, are twenty _Dumy_; their\r\nsubjects are such as these: Fight of the Cossack with the Tartar, the Three\r\nBrothers, On the Victory of Gorgsun (1648). He reckons the number in\r\nexistence at thirty. Of these he publishes, four have not before been\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new edition of Hogarth's Works is in process of republication at\r\nGoettingen in a diminished size. There are to be twelve parts at fifty cents\r\neach; the third part has been published.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf DR. ANDREE'S great work on _America_, whose commencement we noticed some\r\nmonths since, the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth parts have just reached\r\nus. The German savan continues to justify the high encomiums we passed upon\r\nthe earlier portions of his work. He has used with the utmost industry and\r\nconscientiousness all the best sources of information on every subject he\r\ntreats. Gallatin, Morton and Squier he frequently quotes as authorities.\r\nThese four parts are devoted to the conclusion of the essay on the origin\r\nand history of the American race. In this he calls attention to the fact\r\nthat all the developments of American civilization took place on high plain\r\nlands and not in the rich vallies of the great rivers--a fact by the way\r\nwhich confirms Mr. Carey's theory of the first settlement and culture of\r\nland, though to this Dr. Andree does not refer. He then treats of Canada,\r\nNew Brunswick, Nova Scotia, the Bermudas and the United States. The leading\r\nfacts in the geography, history, the sources of population, the political\r\nconstitution, the geological structure, soil, climate, industry, resources,\r\nand prospects of these countries are given with admirable succinctness,\r\nthoroughness and justice. As a book of ordinary reference, none could be\r\nmore convenient or reliable. The most difficult questions are considered\r\nwith a genuine German cosmopolitan impartiality of judgment. The\r\npredominant influence in the formation of the American democratic\r\ninstitutions Dr. Andree considers to be English, or more strictly speaking\r\nTeutonic. Other races and nations have contributed to the mass of the\r\npeople, but only the Teutonic has laid the foundation and built the\r\nstructure of the state. It is a great blessing in the history of the\r\ncontinent that the French did not succeed in their plans of colonization,\r\nfor they would everywhere have founded not democratic but feudal\r\ninstitutions. The slavery question he treats more in the interest of the\r\nsouth than in the spirit of the abolitionists, whose course he condemns\r\nwith considerable plainness of expression. On the mode of finally solving\r\nthis question, he offers no speculations, but contents himself with showing\r\nthe great difficulties attending colonization and emancipation upon the\r\nsoil. The former he thinks impossible, the latter can only produce war\r\nbetween the two races, in which the latter must be exterminated. This mode\r\nof viewing this subject we can testify is frequent among well-educated\r\nGermans. The statistics relating to the United States, Dr. Andree has\r\ncollected in a most lucid manner; we do not know where they are better or\r\nmore conveniently arranged. Products, imports, exports, debt of federal and\r\nstate governments, taxation, shipping, railroads, canals, schools, are all\r\ngiven; nothing escapes the vigilance of this most exemplary ethnographer.\r\nHis style is no less clear and vivid in these four parts than in those\r\npreceding. The remainder will follow regularly. The work may be found at\r\nWestermann's, corner of Broadway and Reade street, by whose house in\r\nBrunswick, Germany, it is published.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. ALEXANDER DUVAL has a long article in the _Journal des Debats_ entitled,\r\n_Studies upon German Love_, taking his text from Bettina von Arnim's famous\r\ncorrespondence with Goethe, and from the _Book of Love_, in which the same\r\nsentimentalist has recorded her relations with the unfortunate Guenderode.\r\nM. Duval finds that in his intercourse with Bettina, Goethe played a part\r\nwhich was honorable neither to his mind nor his heart. In the _Book of\r\nLove_, says M. Duval, there is a little of every thing--of physics, of\r\nmetaphysics, of poetry, of natural history, of biographical anecdotes, the\r\nhistory of the first kiss, of the second kiss, and of the third kiss\r\nreceived by Mlle. Bettina, mixed up with apostrophes to the stars, to the\r\nocean, to the mountains, and above all, to the moon, which she loves so\r\nmuch that she never leaves it in peace. In fact, she has such a passion for\r\nwhatever is lunatic, that the moon above is not sufficient, and she invents\r\nanother, an interior and metaphysical moon, which enlightens the world of\r\nour thoughts. About this she writes to Goethe: \"When thou art about to go\r\nto sleep, confide thyself to the inward moon, sleep in the light of the\r\nmoon of thy own nature.\" French literature was never disgraced by a girl's\r\nmaking a god of its most illustrious representative, and his allowing the\r\nsilly incense to be burned for years upon his altars; but the evil is\r\ngetting into France as well. Rousseau did not dare to publish his\r\nconfessions, but Lamartine has had the courage, and has served up to the\r\npublic his own letters and the portraits of his mistresses. Madame Sand's\r\n_Memoirs_ are also advertised; another step that way and Germany need no\r\nlonger envy the country of Montesquieu and Voltaire, of good sense and\r\naction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReadable and instructive is HASE'S _Neue Propheten_ (New Prophets), just\r\npublished in Germany. The new prophets are Joan d'Arc, Savonarola, and the\r\nAnabaptists of Muenster. They are treated historically and philosophically,\r\nin a style whose simplicity, animation, and clearness, differ most\r\ngratefully from the crabbed and long-winded sentences of the earlier German\r\nwriters, in the study of whom we dug our way into some imperfect\r\nacquaintance with that rich and flexible tongue. The book is worthy of\r\ntranslation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new book on a subject which has latterly become prominent among the\r\nthemes of European observation and thought is called _Suedslavische\r\nWanderwagen im Sommer 1850_ (Wandering in Southern Slavonia in the Summer\r\nof 1850). It is a series of vivid and interesting pictures of one of the\r\nmost remarkable races and regions of Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA singular work has recently been published by Decker of Berlin, entitled\r\n_Monasticus Irenaeus, von Jerusalem, nach Bethlehem_ (or Irenaeus Monasticus:\r\na public message to the noble Lady Ida, Countess of Hahn-Hahn: for the\r\nprofit and piety of all newly converted Catholics.) In this work we find\r\nmuch talent, deep learning, and abundance of Schleiermachian philosophy;\r\nbut remark on the other hand the following weak points: Firstly, that the\r\nauthor cuts down a gnat with a scimitar, or in other words overrates the\r\ntalent and abilities of his adversary; and, secondly, that he affects to\r\nassume the tone and style in which her work was written, even in the title.\r\n(The reader will remember that the work of the Countess was entitled \"_From\r\nJerusalem_,\" and bore the motto, \"SOLI DEO GLORIA.\") In other respects also\r\nis this work, if not decidedly wrong, at least quite indifferent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLAMARTINE'S History of the Restoration is reviewed at length in the\r\n_Journal des Debats_, by M. Cuvillier-Fleury. It is a very severe piece of\r\ncriticism. Lamartine is charged with injustice, confusion, and even a\r\nsystematic perversion of the truth, especially toward Napoleon. The account\r\nof the Emperor's last days at Fontainebleau, is pronounced a tragi-comedy,\r\nfull of grimaces, of explosions, of puerile hesitations, of impossible\r\nexaggerations. Men and facts are judged without reflection, by prejudice,\r\nby blind passion, by a sort of fated and involuntary partiality. The method\r\nof the book runs into declamation, turgidity, and redundancy; he does not\r\nnarrate, he discourses or expounds; he falls into mere gossip or is lost in\r\nanalysis; instead of portraits he paints miniatures, and does not conceive\r\nan historical picture without a fancy vignette. His descriptive lyricism,\r\ninstead of imparting a grandeur to his subject, diminishes it; instead of\r\nrefining it, renders it petty. Besides, in his overstrained and exaggerated\r\nstyle, he is guilty of writing bad French; M. Cuvillier-Fleury quotes\r\nseveral striking examples of this. The article concludes by saying that the\r\nhistorian writes without ballast, and goes at the impulse of every breeze\r\nwhich swells his sails, and with no other care than the inspiration of the\r\nmoment. His subject carries him off by all the perspectives it opens to his\r\nimagination or his memory. He is like a ship moving out of port with\r\nstreamers floating from every mast, its poop crowned with flowers, and\r\nevery sail set, but without a rudder. In spite of all criticism, however,\r\nthis history has a large sale in France: the first edition is already\r\nexhausted. The practice of pirating, usual at Brussels and Leipzic, with\r\nreference to French works of importance, has been prevented, in this case,\r\nby the preparation of cheap editions for Belgium and Germany, which were\r\nissued there cotemporaneously with the publication at Paris.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second part of the third volume of HUMBOLDT'S _Kosmos_ is nearly\r\ncompleted, and will soon appear. A fourth volume is to be added, in which\r\nthe geological studies of the venerable author will be set forth. He is now\r\nnearly eighty-one years old, and is as vigorous and youthful in feeling as\r\never. The first part of the third volume of _Kosmos_ appeared in German and\r\nEnglish several months ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA History of Polish Literature, from the remotest antiquity to 1830, is now\r\nbeing published at Warsaw, by Mr. MACIEJOWKI, a writer thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the subject. Three parts of the first volume have appeared,\r\nbringing the history down to the first half of the seventeenth century. One\r\nmore part will complete the volume, and three volumes will complete the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe study of Russian archaeology and history is prosecuted in that country\r\nwith a degree of activity and thoroughness that other nations are not aware\r\nof, and publications of importance are made constantly. Within the present\r\nyear the fifth part of the complete collection of _Russian Chronicles_ has\r\nappeared, the fourth of the collection of public documents relating to the\r\nhistory of Western Russia, and the beginning of a new collection of foreign\r\nhistorians of Russia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA curious contrast of light and shade is exhibited in the titles of two\r\nworks recently published in Vienna. SIEGFRIED WEISS (or _white_) puts forth\r\na book, _On the present state and trade policy of Germany_, while in the\r\nnext paragraph of the same list N. SCHWARTZ (or _black_) appears as the\r\nauthor of _The situation of Austria as regards her trade policy_. This\r\nlatter we should judge to be an excellent illustration of the old phrase,\r\n\"_nomen et omen!_\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPeriodical literature is making its way into Asia. A literary monthly has\r\nmade its appearance at Tiflis, in the Georgian language. It will discuss\r\nGeorgian literature, furnish translations from foreign tongues, and treat\r\nof the arts and sciences, and of agriculture. What oriental students will\r\nfind most interesting in this magazine, will be its specimens of the\r\npopular literature of the country. A new Armenian periodical has also been\r\ncommenced in the Trans-Caucasian country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA German version of HAWTHORNE'S _Scarlet Letter_ has been executed by one\r\nDU BOIS, and published by Velliagen & Klasing of Nielefeld.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOTTO HUBNER, the industrious German economist, is about to publish at\r\nLeipsic a collection of the tariffs of all nations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA work on Freemasonic medals has been published by Dr. MERZDORF,\r\nsuperintendent of the Grand Ducal Library of Oldenburg: with plates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe German Universities are well off for teachers. In the twenty-seven\r\ninstitutions of the kind at the last summer term, there were engaged 1586\r\nteachers, viz.: 816 ordinary, 330 extraordinary, and 37 honorary\r\nprofessors, with 403 private tutors, exclusive of 134 masters of languages,\r\ngymnastics, fencing and dancing. Muenster has the fewest teachers, numbering\r\nonly 18, Olmuetz 22, Innsbruck, 26, Gratz 22, Berne and Basle each 33,\r\nRostock, 38; on the other hand Berlin has 167, Munich 102, Leipzic and\r\nGoettingen each 100, Prague 92, Bonn 90, Breslau 84, Heidelberg 81, Tuebingen\r\n77, Halle 75, Jena 74. The whole number of students in the last term was\r\n16,074; Berlin counting 2199, Munich 1817, Prague 1204, Bonn 1026, Leipzic\r\n846, Breslau 831, Tuebingen 768, Goettingen 691, Wuerzburg 684, Halle 646,\r\nHeidelberg 624, Gratz 611, Jena 434, Giessen 409, Freiburg 403, Erlangen\r\n402, Olmuetz 396, Koenigsberg 332, Muenster 323, Marburg 272, Innsbruck 257,\r\nGreifswald 208, Zuerich 201, Berne 184, Rostock 122, Kiel 119, Basel 65.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the last poetical issues of the German press we notice _Poetis che\r\nSchriften_, by A. HENSEL (Vienna, 2 vols.), are exaggerated, almost insane\r\nexpression of Austrian loyalty running through sonnets, lyrics, ballads and\r\nromances; _Friedrichsehre_ (Honor to Frederick), by an anonymous author\r\n(Posen), a new wreath for the weather-beaten old brows of Frederick the\r\nGreat; _Erwachen_ (Waking), seven poems by Hugo le Juge (Berlin), a book\r\nwith talent in it; _Lebensfruehling_, by Paul Eslin (Liepsic), the second\r\nedition of a collection of neat and pleasing poems for children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Russian government has published some book-making statistics of Poland\r\nin 1850. In the course of the year, 359 manuscript works were submitted to\r\nthe censorship, being 19 more than in 1849. Almost all were scientific, the\r\ngreater part treating of theology, jurisprudence, and medicine; 327 were\r\nlicensed to be printed, 4 rejected, and 15 returned to their authors for\r\nmodification; upon 13 no decision has been given. In 1850, there were\r\nimported into the kingdom 15,986 works, in 58,141 volumes; this was 749\r\nworks less, and 1,027 volumes more than in 1849.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new work on Russia is appearing at Paris with the title of _Etudes sur\r\nles Forces Productives de la Russie_. Its author is Mr. L. DE TEGOBORSKI, a\r\nRussian privy councillor. The first volume, a stout octavo, has been\r\nissued. It treats of the geographical situation and extent of Russia, the\r\nclimate, fertility and configuration of the soil; population; productions\r\nof the earth and their gross value; vegetable, animal and mineral\r\nproductions; agriculture; raising of domestic animals. The whole work will\r\nconsist of three volumes; the second is in press.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNotices in the later numbers of the _Europa_, of KARL QUENTIN in America,\r\nand _The Art Journal_, are not without interest.

It gives in the\r\nmost succinct form a statement of the doctrines of the leading\r\nphilosophical thinkers of all times, and is designed for the cultivated\r\namong the German people. Men of other nations are however not forbidden to\r\nderive from it what advantage they can.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDE FLOTTE, whose election to the French Assembly made such a stir a year\r\nsince, has lately published a thick volume entitled _De la Souverainete du\r\nPeuple_. It is a series of essays in which he discusses with great\r\npenetration and remarkable power of abstract thought, the spirit, ends, and\r\npresent results of the great general revolution, of which all the special\r\nrevolutions that have hitherto occurred, are merely incidents and phases.\r\nDe Flotte considers that humanity is advancing toward liberty absolute and\r\nuniversal, in politics, religion, industry, and every department of life.\r\n\"One thing,\" he says, \"has ever astonished me; this is that some men\r\npresume to accuse the revolution of denying tradition, because they think\r\nonly of one age, or of one dynasty, while we think of all sovereigns and of\r\nall ages; they oppose, with a curious good faith, the history of a single\r\nepoch or a single party, to the history of all epochs and of all men.\r\nStrange ignorance and singular forgetfulness! Why do they fail to do in\r\nspace, what they do in time, in geography what they do in history? Why do\r\nthey not deny the existence of negroes and of the Chinese because none of\r\nthem come to France? The reason is that life in space strikes the bodily\r\neye, while life in time strikes the eye of the mind, and theirs is\r\nblinded!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn France, 78,000 francs have been voted by the National Assembly for\r\nexcavations at Nineveh. Mr. LAYARD, without further means for the\r\nprosecution of his researches there, is in England, and we are sorry to\r\nlearn, in ill health. His new book, _Fresh Discoveries in Nineveh_, will\r\nsoon be published by Mr. Putnam. Dr. H. WEISSENBORN has printed in\r\nStuttgart, _Nineveh and its Territory, in respect to the latest excavations\r\nin the valley of the Tigris_. Some specimens of the exhumed sculptures of\r\nNineveh have been sent to New-York by Rev. D. W. Marsh, of the American\r\nmission at Mosul.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA second series of EUGENE SUE's _Mysteres du Peuple_ is announced as about\r\nto commence at Paris. This is an attempt to set forth the history of the\r\nFrench people, or working classes, the form of a modern story being merely\r\na frame in which to set the author's pictures of former times. The first\r\nseries completes the history of the early Gauls and of Roman domination;\r\nthe second will treat of feudalism and of the introduction of modern social\r\ncastes and distinctions. Sue has published a preamble in the form of an\r\naddress to his readers, in which he draws the outline of the subject he is\r\nabout to treat, and establishes his main historical positions by reference\r\nto a great variety of learned authorities.\r\n\r\nThe same author is now publishing in _La Presse_ a new novel called\r\n_Fernand Duplessis, or Memoirs of a Husband_. We have seen some eight or\r\nten numbers of it; so far it is comparatively free from the clap-trap\r\nromance machinery in which French writers in general, and Sue in\r\nparticular, are apt to indulge, while it is otherwise less unobjectionable\r\nthan the mass of his stories.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe historian MICHELET has published a new part of his _Revolution\r\nFrancaise_. It is devoted to the Girondists. The conclusions of the author\r\nare that these unfortunate politicians of a terrible epoch were personally\r\ninnocent, that they never thought of dismembering France, and had no\r\nunderstanding with the enemy, but that the policy they pursued in the early\r\npart of '93, was blind and impotent, and if followed out could only have\r\nresulted in the destruction of the republic, and the triumph of the\r\nroyalists. The whole is treated in the Micheletian manner, in distinct\r\nchapters, each elucidating some mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA work _On the Fabrication of Porcelain in China, with its History from\r\nAntiquity to the present Day_, that is to say, from 583 to 1821, has just\r\nbeen translated from Chinese into French by STANISLAS JULIEN, and published\r\nat Paris. It puts the European manufacturer perfectly in possession of the\r\nsecrets of Chinese workmen, their methods, and the substances they employ.\r\nM. Julien has previously translated a Chinese essay on education of\r\nsilkworms, and the culture of the mulberry. He is one of the most learned\r\nsinologues in Europe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA French archaeeologist, M. FELIX DE VERNEILH, has published an elaborate\r\nessay on the Cologne Cathedral, in which he denies to Germany the credit of\r\ninventing the purest model of the pointed arch, and demonstrates that this\r\nCathedral was not planned at the beginning of the most brilliant period of\r\nChristian art, but was the climax thereof, and that instead of having\r\nserved as the archetype in construction of other edifices, it shows the\r\ninfluence of them, and especially of the Cathedral of Amiens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn interesting and instructive little work has been published at Paris on\r\nthe Workingmen's Associations of that city and country.

It is to be elegant, yet\r\ncheap, the whole only costing about $5. There will be some six hundred\r\nillustrations. The first part contains _La Mare au Diable_ and _Andre_,\r\nwith a new preface to the former, in which the author contradicts the\r\nnotion that it was intended by her as the beginning of a new order of\r\nliterature, or was attempted as a new style of writing. Other authors are\r\nto follow in the same manner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe new volume of THIER's _History of the Consulate and the Empire_ is\r\nregarded as the most able and most interesting of the series. There is to\r\nbe one other volume.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nALEXANDER DUMAS has written the following letter to the _Presse_:\r\n\r\n     \"Sir,--I understand that a publisher who at second hand\r\n     is the owner of a book of mine called \"The History of\r\n     Louis Philippe,\" intends to issue the work under the\r\n     title of \"Mysteries of a Royal Family.\" I have written\r\n     the history of Louis Philippe, just as I have written\r\n     the histories of Louis XIV., and Louis XV., and Louis\r\n     XVI., the history of the revolution, and the history of\r\n     the empire. I have sold this series of historical works\r\n     to a single publisher, M. Dufour. I never had the\r\n     intention to provoke the scandal indicated by the title\r\n     with which I am threatened in substitution for the one\r\n     that I had given to the work. In the life of Louis\r\n     Philippe and the royal family there is nothing\r\n     mysterious. A fatal obstinacy in a course leading to an\r\n     abyss: there's for the king. For the queen there is\r\n     goodness, self-sacrifice, charity, religion, virtue.\r\n     For the deceased royal prince and his living brothers,\r\n     there is courage, loyalty, gallantry, intelligence,\r\n     patriotism. You see in all this there is nothing\r\n     mysterious. If he persists in giving to my book a title\r\n     which I regard as infamous, the courts of justice shall\r\n     decide between me and the publisher. May God keep me\r\n     from invoking aught but historical truth with regard to\r\n     a man who touched my hand when a king, and my heart,\r\n     when an exile.\r\n\r\n                              \"ALEX. DUMAS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConduct of this sort--the changing of titles, in violation of the wishes of\r\nauthors, or any change in a book, by a publisher--is atrocious crime, for\r\nthe punishment of which a revival of the whipping-post would not be\r\ninappropriate. There have been many such cases in this country, and to some\r\nof them we may hereafter call particular attention.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most truly successful of the younger living French writers is\r\nALFRED DE MUSSET. His works are principally poetic and dramatic. He\r\noriginated a style of pieces called _Caprices_, which have become\r\nexceedingly popular not only from their own point and spirit, but from the\r\nincomparable manner in which they are rendered on the stage of the _Theatre\r\nFrancais_. M. de Musset's reputation has been achieved since the revolution\r\nof July. The last number of the _Grenzboten_ devotes a long leading article\r\nto the discussion of his works and his position in the world of letters. We\r\ntranslate the following paragraph: \"We find in him an elegance of language,\r\na truth of views, even though they be true only for him individually, a\r\nsensibility to all the problems of the soul and heart, and a freedom from\r\nthe usual French prejudices, which lay a strong claim to our attention. He\r\nnever falls into that shallow pathos with which Victor Hugo in his\r\n'greatest moments' sometimes covers an intolerable triviality; phrases\r\nnever run away with him as they do so often with the king of the\r\nromanticists, whose profoundest monologues not seldom turn out to be empty\r\njingle. In clearness, delicacy and grace, he can be compared, among the\r\nmodern romanticists, with only Prosper Merimee and Charles de Bernard. They\r\nalso resemble him in the fear of being led away by general modes of\r\nexpression and reflection. They strive only for _individual_ truth; but he\r\ndiffers from them in the breadth and multiformity of his perspectives, and\r\nin a singular power of assimilation which is based on extensive reading. In\r\nfact, the combinations of his wit and fancy often go so into the distant\r\nand boundless, that we think we are reading a German author.\" The critic\r\nthen compares De Musset with Byron; the latter is more original and\r\nspontaneous, the former richer and more comprehensive. The questions Byron\r\ndiscusses have forced themselves upon him; those of De Musset are of his\r\nown invention. For the rest he has been greatly influenced by Heine and\r\nHoffmann, as well as by the Faust of Goethe. The more important of his\r\nworks are: _Contes d'Espagne et d'Italie_ (1830); _Un Spectacle dans un\r\nFauteuil_ (1833); _Poesies Nouvelles_ (1835-40); the same (1840-49); _Les\r\nComedies Injouables_, a collection of small dramatic pieces (1838); _Louis,\r\nou il faut qu'une porte soit ouverte ou fermee_, _Les deux Martiesses_,\r\n_Emmeline_, _Le Seuet de Javatte_, _Le Fils de Titien_, _Les Adventures de\r\nLaagon_, _La Confession d'un Enfant du Siecle_; romances published between\r\n1830-40. De Musset is still a young man. A good deal has been said at\r\nsundry times about his admission to the French Academy, but the vacancies\r\nhave been filled without him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe London _Leader_ announces an abridged translation of AUGUSTE COMTE'S\r\nsix volumes of _Positive Philosophy_, to appear as soon as is compatible\r\nwith the exigencies of so important an undertaking. The _Leader_ says: \"a\r\nvery competent mind has long been engaged upon the task; and the growing\r\ndesire in the public to hear more about this _Bacon_ of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, renders such a publication necessary.\" But we do not believe in\r\nthe competence of any one who proposes an _abridgment_ of Comte: the idea\r\nis absurd. In this country, we believe, two full translations of the great\r\nFrenchman are in progress--one by Professor Gillespie, of which the Harpers\r\nhave published the first volume, and another by one of the wisest and\r\nprofoundest scholars of the time--a personal friend of Comte, thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with his system, and master of a style admirably suited for\r\nphilosophical discussion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJULES JANIN has published a new romance called _Gaite Champetre_. The\r\npreface has reached us in the feuilleton of the _Journal des Debats_. It is\r\nin the usual elaborate, learned, and fanciful, but most readable style of\r\nthe author. He defends his calling as a mere man of letters, a student of\r\nform and style, in short an artist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe mentioned not long ago (_International_, vol. iii. p. 214,) the pleasant\r\nletters of FERDINAND HILLER to a German Gazette, respecting his experiences\r\namong authors and artists in Paris. We see that Herr Hiller has been\r\nengaged by Mr. Lumley as musical director to Her Majesty's Theatre in\r\nLondon and the Italian Opera in Paris. He has filled the appointments of\r\ndirector to the Conservatoire and Maitre de Chapelle, at Cologne, for some\r\nconsiderable time. His post at the Conservatoire is to be occupied by M.\r\nLiszt. He will be an important accession to society as well as to the\r\ntheatres in those cities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR. R. G.

HORACE MANN is engaged on a work illustrating his ideas of the\r\ncharacter, condition, and proper sphere of woman. He does not quite agree\r\nwith Abby Kelly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe old charge that\r\n\r\n    \"Garth did not write his own Dispensary,\"\r\n\r\nhas been revived with exquisite absurdity in the case of General Morris and\r\nthe song of \"Woodman, Spare that Tree!\" We have not seen the original\r\naccusation which appeared in an obscure sheet in Boston, but we give place\r\nwith pleasure to the letter of the poet. We can imagine nothing less \"apt\r\nand of great credit,\" as Iago defines the requisites of a judicious\r\ncalumny, than this figment. The characteristics of Morris's style are\r\nexceedingly marked, and are altogether different from those of Woodworth,\r\nwho was an excellent songwriter and a most worthy man, but was as little\r\nlike Morris in his literary manner as two men can be who write in the same\r\nage and country. There are among our living poets few fairer and purer\r\nliterary reputations than that of General Morris; few that, in a covetous\r\nmood, one would be more disposed to envy. It lives not in the tumult of\r\nreckless criticism and the noisy dogmatism of friendly reviews, but in the\r\nsympathy and enjoyment of thousands of refined and feeling hearts. His\r\ncalm, delicate, and simple genius has won its way quietly to an apprecient\r\nadmiration that no assaults can disturb, and it may now look down upon most\r\nof its contemporaries without jealousy and without fear. It will shine in\r\nits clear brightness when many clamorous notorieties of the day are\r\nquenched in night and silence. The charge of the Boston editor is a mere\r\nbuffoonery. He could not expect that so ridiculous a fabrication would be\r\nbelieved by any body. It is a device of common-place, stupid malice,\r\ndesigned only to annoy a very amiable man. Had we been of counsel with the\r\npoet we should have advised him to take no notice of the foolish slander;\r\nbut as he has seen fit to write a very interesting note on the subject, we\r\nare happy to preserve it here. The gentleman to whom the note is addressed\r\ngives the following account of the circumstances:\r\n\r\n     \"Some two or three months ago, the editor of the Boston\r\n     Sunday News, took General Morris's literary character\r\n     to task, and charged him with having obtained the\r\n     famous song of 'Woodman Spare that Tree,' from the late\r\n     Samuel Woodworth. In a word, he charged that the\r\n     General was not the author of a celebrated poem, which\r\n     has long been before the world in his name.\r\n\r\n     \"As the editor in question was a friend of mine, and as\r\n     I knew that he had done General Morris great injustice,\r\n     I wrote him a long letter, in which I attempted to set\r\n     him right, and thus induce him if possible to render\r\n     unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's. In other words,\r\n     I hoped he would correct his misstatements. Instead of\r\n     complying with my expressed hope, he thanked me for my\r\n     letter--very kindly published it; but, in the very same\r\n     paper, repeated his original charge. In common justice\r\n     to General Morris, I beg leave to remark, in closing\r\n     this note, that I have known him intimately and well\r\n     the last thirty years, and that I never knew a poet or\r\n     author in any department of literature who was more\r\n     strictly original. He is incapable of the petty conduct\r\n     attributed to him, and would scorn to wear honors that\r\n     belong to another. A more honorable, high-minded\r\n     gentleman never lived.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     HOME JOURNAL OFFICE, NEW-YORK, _September 22, 1851_.\r\n\r\n     TO JOHN SMITH, JR., OF ARKANSAS: _My Dear Sir_:--I\r\n     thank you sincerely for your kind defence of me against\r\n     the unfounded aspersions of an editor of a Boston\r\n     paper. Your course was precisely what was to be\r\n     expected from a just man, and a contemporary who has\r\n     known me from my boyhood. The editor alluded to,\r\n     charges me with a crime that I abhor. It is\r\n     substantially as follows: \"_That the ballad of\r\n     'Woodman, spare that tree,' was not written by me, but\r\n     by the late Samuel Woodworth, who, while in a state\r\n     intoxication, sold it to me, in a public bar-room, for\r\n     a paltry sum_.\" A more infamous charge was never made,\r\n     and the whole story, from beginning to end, without any\r\n     qualification whatever, is an unmitigated _falsehood_.\r\n     The history of the song in question is simply this: In\r\n     the autumn of 1837, Russell, the vocalist, applied to\r\n     me for an original ballad, and I wrote him \"_Woodman,\r\n     spare that tree_,\" and handed it to him with a letter\r\n     which he afterwards read at his concerts, and published\r\n     in the newspapers of the day. It also accompanied the\r\n     first edition of the music. Mr. Woodworth never saw or\r\n     heard of the song until after it appeared in print. I\r\n     am not indebted to any human being, dead or alive, for\r\n     a single word, thought, or suggestion, embodied in that\r\n     song. It is entirely original and entirely my\r\n     composition, and this is also true of _all_ the\r\n     productions I have ever claimed to be the author of,\r\n     with the exception of the play of \"Brier Cliff,\" which\r\n     is founded upon a novel by Mrs. Thayer, and the opera\r\n     of the \"Maid of Saxony,\" dramatized from a story by\r\n     Miss Edgeworth. In both instances I duly acknowledged\r\n     my indebtedness to the authors from whom I derived my\r\n     materials for those pieces. The attack upon Mr.\r\n     Woodworth is also shameful in the extreme, and is in\r\n     keeping with the whole affair. A more pure and\r\n     honorable man never drew the breath of life, and it is\r\n     due to his memory to say that he was not less\r\n     remarkable for his habits of _temperance_, than for his\r\n     many excellent qualities of head and heart. I do not\r\n     think that he was ever intoxicated in the whole course\r\n     of his life, and he was too upright a man to lend\r\n     himself to such a bare-faced imposition as I am charged\r\n     with practising through his agency. If he were alive to\r\n     answer for himself, he would spurn, as I do, these\r\n     malicious fabrications. The whole of the charges made\r\n     against me are _untrue in every particular_, and what\r\n     motive any one can have for circulating such vile\r\n     slanders in private life, or for proclaiming them from\r\n     the house-tops of the press, baffles my ingenuity to\r\n     determine. Those who know me will doubtless consider\r\n     this vindication of myself entirely unnecessary. If I\r\n     were to follow my own inclinations I should not notice\r\n     the scandalous libel; but, as you justly remarked, \"a\r\n     slander well hoed grows like the devil,\" and as my\r\n     silence might possibly be misunderstood, I deem it a\r\n     duty I owe myself to contradict the infamous and\r\n     malicious aspersions of the Boston editor, and to\r\n     declare, in the language of Sheridan, that \"there is\r\n     not one word of truth in all _that gentleman_ has\r\n     uttered.\" In conclusion, I would say, that my defamer\r\n     has either been imposed upon, or that he is one of\r\n     those lawless bravos of our profession who really\r\n     imagine, because they are \"permitted to print they are\r\n     privileged to insult.\" Again, thanking you for your\r\n     courtesy and kind interposition in my behalf, I remain,\r\n     my dear sir, yours very cordially.\r\n\r\n                              GEORGE P. MORRIS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR TORREY, of Vermont University, has published the fourth volume of\r\nhis translation of Neander's _History of the Christian Religion_--a work\r\nwhich must have rank with the great historical compositions of Niebuhr and\r\nGrote, which have or will have superseded all modern histories of the two\r\nchief empires of antiquity. The volumes of Professor Torrey's very able\r\ntranslation of Neander's History are regularly republished in rival\r\neditions in England, and so he loses half the reward to which his service\r\nis entitled. Puthes, of Hamburg, advertises the eleventh part (making half\r\nof another volume), which Neander left in MS. This will, of course, be\r\nreproduced by Professor Torrey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother translation of the _Divine Comedy_ has been made in England. It is\r\nby a Mr. C. B. CAYLEY, and is in the original ternary rhyme. From a hasty\r\nexamination of it we incline to prefer it to Wright's or Carey's; but we\r\nhave seen no version of DANTE that in all respects satisfies us so well as\r\nthat of Dr. THOMAS W. PARSONS, of Boston, of which some ten cantos were\r\npublished a few years ago, and of which the remainder is understood to be\r\ncompleted for the press. Speaking of Dante, reminds us of the fact that Mr.\r\nRichard Henry Wilde's elaborate memoir of the great Italian has not yet\r\nbeen printed. Mr. Wilde wrote to us not long before his death that he had\r\nbeen occupying himself in leisure hours with the revision of some of its\r\nchapters, and we have no doubt that the work is completed. If so, for the\r\nhonor of the lamented author, and for the honor of American criticism, it\r\nshould be given to the public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom a forthcoming volume by ALICE CAREY, _Recollections of Our\r\nNeighborhood in the West,_ (to be published early in December by J. S.\r\nRedfield,) we copy a specimen chapter, under the title of \"The Old Man's\r\nDeath,\" into another part of this magazine. It has no particular excellence\r\nto distinguish it from the rest of the work; indeed it is rather below than\r\nabove the average of Miss Carey's recent compositions; but we may safely\r\nchallenge to it the scrutiny of critics capable of appreciating the finest\r\ncapacities for the illustration of pastoral life. If we look at the entire\r\ncatalogue of female writers of prose fiction in this country we shall find\r\nno one who approaches Alice Carey in the best characteristics of genius.\r\nLike all genuine authors she has peculiarities; her hand is detected as\r\nunerringly as that of Poe or Hawthorne; as much as they she is apart from\r\nothers and above others; and her sketches of country life must, we think,\r\nbe admitted to be superior even to those delightful tales of Miss Mitford,\r\nwhich, in a similar line, are generally acknowledged to be equal to any\r\nthing done in England. It is the fault of our literary women that they are\r\ncommonly careless and superficial, and that in stories, when they attempt\r\nthis sort of writing, they are for the most part but feeble copyists,\r\nwithout individuality, and without naturalness. We can point to very few\r\nexceptions to this rule, but among such exceptions Alice Carey is eminent.\r\nThe book which is announced by Mr. Redfield is without the tinsel, or\r\nsickly sentiment, or impudent smartness, which distinguish some\r\ncontemporary publications by women, but it will establish for her an\r\nenviable reputation as an original and most graphic delineator of at least\r\none class in American society--the middle class, in the rural\r\nneighborhoods, with whom rest, in our own as in other countries, the real\r\ndistinctions of national character, and the best elements of national\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. HENRY INGALLS, a writer of considerable abilities, displayed chiefly in\r\nanonymous compositions on questions in law, writes to a friend in New-York\r\nfrom Paris, that he has devoted two years to the investigation of pretended\r\nmiracles in modern Europe; that the number of alleged miracles in the Roman\r\nCatholic church of which he has exact historical materials, is over one\r\nthousand; that the analyses of these will be amply suggestive of the\r\ncharacter of the rest; and that his work on the subject, to make three or\r\nfour large and closely printed volumes, will conclusively show complicity\r\non the part of the highest authorities of the church, in \"the frauds that\r\nare now most notorious and most generally acknowledged.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ingalls is of opinion that his work will be eminently curious in\r\nliterary, philosophical, and religious points of view, and that it cannot\r\nfail of usefulness, especially in illustrating the silly credulity which\r\nhas obtained in such poor juggleries as have lately been practiced by the\r\nSmiths, Davises, Fishes, Harrises, and other imposters and mountebanks of\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the new works in press by the Appletons is a new novel entitled\r\n_Adrian, or the Clouds of the Mind_--the joint production of Mr. G. P. R.\r\nJAMES and Mr. MAUNSELL B. FIELD. Such partnerships in literature were\r\ncommon in the days of Elizabeth, and in our own country we have instances\r\nin the production of _Yamoyden_, by Sands and Eastburn, &c. Mr. Field is\r\nnot yet a veteran, but he is a writer of fine talents and much cultivation.\r\nAmong the original papers in the present number of the _International_ is a\r\npoem from his hand, under the title of _Greenwood_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe first volume of a _History of the German Reformed Church_, by the late\r\nRev. Dr. LEWIS MAYER, has been published in Philadelphia; and Professor\r\nSCHAFF, of Mercersburg, has printed in German the first volume of a\r\n_History of the Christian Church, from its Establishment to the Present\r\nTime_. Dr. MURDOCK, the well-known translator of Mosheim's History, has\r\npublished a translation of the celebrated Syriac version of the New\r\nTestament, called the _Peshito_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR HACKETT, of the Newton Theological Institution, has added to his\r\nclaims of distinction in sacred learning by a very able _Commentary on the\r\nActs of the Apostles_, (published by John P. Jewett & Co., of Boston). It\r\nis much praised by the best critics. The last _Bibliotheca Sacra_ complains\r\nthat there is a decline of activity in this department, and that in\r\ntheology and biblical criticism no important works are now in progress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. MELVILLE's new novel, _The Whale_, will be published in a few days,\r\nsimultaneously, by the Harpers and by Bentley of London.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. HENRY WILLIAM HERBERT, with the general character of whose works our\r\nreaders must be familiar, will publish immediately (through Charles\r\nScribner), _The Captains of the Old World, from the Persian to the Punic\r\nWars_. The volume embraces critical sketches of Miltiades, Themistocles,\r\nPausanias, Xenophon, Epaminondas, Alexander, and Hannibal, as compared with\r\nmodern generals--not _lives_ but strategetical accounts of their campaigns,\r\nreviewed and described according to the rules and views of modern military\r\nscience--the armature and mode of fighting in all the various nations--the\r\nfields of battle, from personal observation or the best modern\r\ntravels--with the modern names of ancient places, so that the routes of the\r\narmies can be followed on any ordinary map. The causes of the success or\r\nfailure of this or that action are shown in a military point of view, and\r\nthe characters of the men are epigrammatically contrasted with those of the\r\nmen of the late French and English wars, involving incidental notices and\r\ncritiques of modern fields. The work is of course spirited and well\r\nproportioned, and as Mr. Herbert is confessedly one of the best critics of\r\nancient manners and history, it will scarcely need any reviewer's\r\nendorsement to insure for it an immediate and very great popularity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new edition of _St. Leger, or the Threads of Life_, by Mr. KIMBALL, has\r\njust been published by Putnam, who, we understand, has now in press a\r\nsequel to that remarkable and eminently successful novel. Mr. Kimball's\r\nabilities as a writer of tales are not as well illustrated in this\r\nperformance as in several shorter stories, which will soon be collected and\r\nreissued with fit designs by Darley. In these we think he has exhibited a\r\nvery unusual degree of pathos and dramatic skill, so that scarcely any\r\ncompositions of their class in American literature have such a power upon\r\nthe feelings or are likely to have a more permanent fame. Mr. Kimball is\r\none of the small number among our young writers who do not disdain\r\nelaborately to _finish_ what they choose to submit for public criticism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA new edition of Mr. JUDD's remarkable novel of _Margaret_ has just been\r\npublished, in two volumes, by Phillips & Sampson, of Boston, and the same\r\nhouse has nearly ready _Memoirs of Sarah Margaret Fuller_, in two volumes,\r\nedited by William H. Channing and Ralph Waldo Emerson. It will probably\r\nembrace a large selection of her inedited writings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. TEFFT, of Cincinnati, has published (John Ball, Philadelphia\r\nand New-Orleans,) a very interesting and judicious work under the title of\r\n_Hungary and Kossuth, or an American Exposition of the Hungarian\r\nRevolution_. Dr. Tefft appears to have studied the subject well and to have\r\nmade as much of it as was warranted by his materials.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. GREELEY has just published in a handsome volume (De Witt & Davenport)\r\nhis _Glances at Europe_, consisting of the letters written for the\r\n_Tribune_ during his half year abroad. We frequently entirely disagree with\r\nthe author in matters of social philosophy, but we have the most perfect\r\nconfidence in the honesty of his searching after truth, and in these\r\nletters, which were written under very apparent disadvantages, and are here\r\nput forward modestly, we are inclined to believe there is for the mass of\r\nreaders more that is new in fact and sensible in observation than is\r\ncontained in any other volume by an American on Europe. Even when writing\r\nof art, Mr. Greeley never fails at least to entertain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. JOHN L. WHEELER, late the treasurer of the state of North Carolina, has\r\nin the press of Lippencott, Grambo, & Co., of Philadelphia, _Historical\r\nSketches_ of that State, from 1584 to 1851, from original records, official\r\ndocuments, and traditional statements. It will be in two large octavo\r\nvolumes. Dr. Hawks has for some time had in preparation a work on the same\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of those wrongs for which there is no sufficient remedy in law, has\r\nbeen perpetrated by Derby, Miller & Co., of Auburn, in getting up a life of\r\nDr. Judson, to anticipate that by the widow of the great missionary and\r\ndeprive her of the best part of the profits to which she is entitled. Their\r\nexcuse is, \"A public character is public property, and we will do with one\r\nas we please.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMRS. H. C. CONANT, (wife of the learned Professor Conant of the university\r\nof Rochester), has published (through Lewis Colby) _The Epistle of St. Paul\r\nto the Philippians, practically Explained by_ Dr. AUGUSTUS NEANDER. Mrs.\r\nConant, as we have before had occasion to observe, is one of the most able\r\nand accomplished women of this country, and this version of Neander is\r\nworthy of her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA small volume entitled _Musings and Mutterings by an Invalid_, has been\r\npublished by John S. Taylor. The style is rather careless, sometimes, but\r\nthe work appears to be informed with a genuine earnestness, and to be\r\nunderlaid with a vein of good sense that contrasts strongly with much of\r\nthe desultory literature brought out in similar forms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. LARDNER's _Handbooks of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy_ have been\r\nrepublished by Blanchard & Lea, of Philadelphia (12mo., pp. 749); carefully\r\nrevised; various errors which had escaped the attention of the author\r\ncorrected; occasional omissions supplied; and a series of questions and\r\npractical examples appended to each subject. The volume contains treatises\r\non mechanics; hydrostatics, hydraulics, pneumatics, and sound, and optics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fine Arts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London _Art Journal_ for October praises Mr. BURT's engraving of Anne\r\nPage, issued this year by the _American Art-Union_, and thus refers to the\r\nprincipal engravings announced for 1852:\r\n\r\n     The prospectus of this society for the present year\r\n     announces a large engraving by Jones, from Woodville's\r\n     picture of \"American News;\" a small etching of this\r\n     work accompanies the \"Bulletin,\" to which reference has\r\n     just been made. The composition is clever, but we must\r\n     warn our friends on the other side of the Atlantic,\r\n     that it is not by the circulation of such works as\r\n     this, a feeling for true Art will be generated among\r\n     their countrymen. The subject is common-place, without\r\n     a shadow of refinement to elevate its character; it is,\r\n     we dare say, national, and may, therefore, be popular;\r\n     but they to whom is intrusted the direction of a vast\r\n     machine like the American Art-Union, should take\r\n     especial care that all its operations should tend to\r\n     refine the taste and advance the intelligence of the\r\n     community. Our own Mulready, Wilkie, and Webster, have,\r\n     we know, immortalized their names by a somewhat\r\n     analogous class of works, in which, nevertheless, we\r\n     see humor without vulgarity, and truth without\r\n     affectation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia Art-Union issues this year two very beautiful engravings\r\nfrom the well-known masterpieces of Huntington, _Mercy's Dream_ and\r\n_Christiana and her Children_, from the celebrated collection of the late\r\nEdward C. Carey,--an appreciating patron by whose well-directed liberality\r\nthe arts, especially painting and engraving, had more advantage than has\r\nbeen conferred by any other individual in this country. _Mercy's Dream_ has\r\nbeen engraved by A. H. Ritchie of this city, and _Christiana and her\r\nChildren_ by Andrews & Wagstaff of Boston, each on surfaces of sixteen by\r\ntwenty-two inches; and we know of no more perfect examples of combined\r\nmezzotint, stipple, and line engraving. The management may well be praised\r\nfor such an exercise of judgment as secures to the subscribers of the\r\nArt-Union two such beautiful works.\r\n\r\nA recent visit to Philadelphia afforded us an opportunity to visit its\r\npublic galleries. Among the additions lately made to that of the Art-Union\r\nis one of the finest compositions of Mr. Cropsey, in which the\r\ncharacteristics of the scenery of Italy are combined with remarkable\r\neffect. From a bold and vigorously executed foreground, marked by chesnut\r\nand cypress tress, the eye is attracted by groves and streams, and convents\r\nand palaces, and ruined temples and aqueducts, reposing under such a sky as\r\nbends over that land alone, away to shining and sleeping waters that seem\r\nto reach close to the gates of paradise. _The Coast of Greece_, by Paul\r\nWeber of Philadelphia, is in the grand and imposing style of Achenbach.\r\nThere is a breadth and massiveness and solemn grandeur in this picture\r\nwhich clearly indicate that the artist, who has hitherto given his\r\nattention altogether to landscapes, has in such efforts his true vocation.\r\n_Hagar and Ishmael in the Desert_, by A. Woodside, is a cabinet picture\r\nwhich would be regarded as good beside any of the many great productions\r\nwhich illustrate the same subject. In color and composition it is\r\nexcellent. Mr. Woodside is the painter of a large and attractive picture,\r\n_The Introduction of Christianity into Britain_, which was among the prizes\r\nof the last distribution of the American Art-Union. _Lager Beer_, by C.\r\nSchnessele, is a genre picture, illustrative of German character in\r\nPhiladelphia at the present day. The scene is an interior of a large beer\r\nsaloon, by gaslight, in which a dozen or fifteen persons with brimming cups\r\nare gathered round a table where a trio are singing songs of the\r\nfatherland. The drawing, grouping, light and shade, are highly effective.\r\nMr. Schnessele is a Frenchman, a pupil of Delaroche, and has been in the\r\nUnited States about three years. His works exhibit that skill in detail and\r\ngeneral execution which is a result of a cultivation very rare among\r\nAmerican painters. _Waiting the Ferry_, by W. T. Van Starkenburgh, is a\r\nlandscape with cattle and human figures, with some of the best qualities\r\nconspicuous in Backhuysen's works of a similar character. _Cattskill\r\nCreek_, by G. N. T. Van Starkenburgh,--a brother of the last mentioned\r\npainter,--is full of the beauty of that condition of nature which soothes\r\nthe restless spirit of man, when\r\n\r\n              She glides\r\n    Into his darker musings, with a mild\r\n    And healing sympathy, that steals away\r\n    Their sharpness, ere he is aware.\r\n\r\nMr. Winner has some vigorous heads of old men, and other artists whom our\r\nlimits will not suffer us to mention particularly are represented by\r\nvarious creditable works.\r\n\r\nAs the plan of the Philadelphia Art-Union is essentially different from\r\nthat of any other in this country, we quote from a circular in its last\r\n\"Reporter\" an explanatory paragraph:\r\n\r\n     \"The distinguishing and most important feature in our\r\n     plan, is that which gives the annual prize-holders the\r\n     right of selecting their prizes from among the\r\n     productions of American Art in any part of the United\r\n     States. This plan was adopted as the one which would\r\n     best secure the object for which we have been\r\n     incorporated, viz., \"The Promotion of the Arts of\r\n     Design in the United States.\" It is evident that the\r\n     distribution of fifty prize certificates among our\r\n     members, as was the case at our last annual\r\n     distribution, with which the prize-holders themselves\r\n     could purchase their own pictures any where in the\r\n     United States, is preferable to any plan which empowers\r\n     a committee, composed of a limited number of managers,\r\n     with the entire right to control the funds involved in\r\n     the purchase, and make the selection of such a number\r\n     of pictures. In the one case, individual taste, and\r\n     local predilection for some particular style of art, or\r\n     certain class of artists, may influence the decision of\r\n     a mere picture-buying committee in the selection and\r\n     purchase of the whole number of the prizes; but in the\r\n     other case, the various taste of a large number of\r\n     prize-holders, residing in different sections of our\r\n     vast country, is made to bear upon Art, and,\r\n     consequently, there must ensue a diffusion of knowledge\r\n     upon a subject wherein those persons themselves are the\r\n     interested parties. Should a subscriber to the\r\n     Art-Union of Philadelphia, residing in St. Louis, be\r\n     allotted a prize certificate of one hundred dollars, he\r\n     has the option to order or select his picture in that\r\n     city, and thereby encourage the Fine Arts at home, just\r\n     the same as if that Art-Union were located where he\r\n     lived, and with just as much advantage to the artist as\r\n     though it were the result of that progress in art, in\r\n     his vicinity, which should cause the production of such\r\n     a picture. And there can be no doubt of the judicious\r\n     selection on the part of such a subscriber. No man with\r\n     a hundred dollars to spend for a picture, would be\r\n     likely to make such a purchase without having some\r\n     knowledge on the subject himself, or without consulting\r\n     persons of acknowledged taste in the matter; thereby\r\n     insuring more general satisfaction to all concerned,\r\n     than would a picture of the same value awarded by\r\n     chance from the selection of a committee located in\r\n     another part of the country. No committee, no matter\r\n     how great its judgment, or how well performed its\r\n     duties, could effect a more satisfactory arrangement;\r\n     for in our case the prize-holder and the artist are the\r\n     contracting parties, without the intervention of the\r\n     Art-Union, or the payment of any commission on either\r\n     side. Another argument in favor of the Art-Union of\r\n     Philadelphia is the fact, that by this plan the\r\n     Managers are merely the agents who collect the means\r\n     which are necessary to promote and foster the Arts of\r\n     Design in our rapidly progressing country, while the\r\n     prize-holders themselves actually become the persons\r\n     who make the disbursements. Thus giving to the people\r\n     at large the means to exercise a public and universal\r\n     taste in the expenditure of a large sum--the aggregate\r\n     of small contributions--large as the liberality of our\r\n     countrymen, by their generous subscription, may assist\r\n     us in accumulating.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Western-Art Union_ of Cincinnati has lately published a large and\r\nexcellent engraving by Booth, of _the Trapper's Last Shot_, and for the\r\ncoming year, it will give in the same style, _The Committee of Congress\r\nDrafting the Declaration of Independence_, from a painting by\r\nRothermel--Mr. Jefferson represented reading the Declaration to the other\r\nmembers of the committee before it was reported to the Congress. For prizes\r\nof the next distribution the Union will have a bust of Washington, and one\r\nof Franklin, in marble, by Powers, and a beautiful medallion in relief by\r\nPalmer, and two pictures are engaged or purchased from Whittridge, two from\r\nRothermel, two from McConkey, one from Read, one from Mrs. Spencer, one\r\nfrom Ranney, and one from Terry, besides others from Sontag, Duncanson,\r\nEaton, and Griswold, and other western painters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. HEALY has finished his large picture of _Daniel Webster replying to\r\nRobert Y. Hayne, in the Senate of the United States_, and it has been some\r\ntime on exhibition at the rooms of the National Academy of Design. The\r\ncanvas is twenty-six feet in length by fifteen in breadth, and embraces one\r\nhundred and thirty figures. Many persons not senators are introduced, and\r\nit is difficult to conceive a reason for this, in the cases of several of\r\nthem, who were not then, if they were ever, at Washington. The picture has\r\ngood points, but on the whole we believe it is admitted to be a failure--so\r\nfar as the fit presentation of the illustrious orator is concerned, a most\r\ncomplete and melancholy failure. Engravings of it however, if well\r\nexecuted, may perhaps compete with Messrs. Anthony's immense piece of\r\nmezzotint, studded with copies of Daguerreotypes, which has been published\r\nunder the title of Mr. Clay's last Appearance in the Senate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe illustrations of the life of MARTIN LUTHER published at Hamburg, from\r\nthe pencil of GUSTAV KOeNIG, of which the fourth series has just appeared,\r\ncontinue to receive the praise which has been bestowed on the previous\r\nseries. The first, which came out in 1847, consisted of fifteen engravings,\r\nthe second in 1848 of ten engravings, the third in 1849 of ten, and the\r\nfourth, which concludes the work, has thirteen. The accompanying\r\nletter-press is furnished by Professor Gelzer, and though very elaborate,\r\nis spoken of as only partially successful. The illustrations on the other\r\nhand are said by competent judges to leave nothing to be desired, and as\r\nfar as the earlier series are concerned, we can almost agree with even so\r\nunbalanced commendation. Mr. Koenig has every where taken care to give\r\nfaithful portraits of the personages represented, which adds to the value\r\nof his work, for foreign readers especially. At the same time his\r\ncompositions are undeniably most spirited and effective.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe long expected work of LEUTZE, _Washington Crossing the Delaware_, is\r\nnow at the Stuyvesant Institute, and it appears generally to have given the\r\nmost perfect satisfaction to the critics; to be regarded indeed as the best\r\npicture yet given to the world in illustration of American history. Our\r\nreaders will remember that we have already given in the _International_ a\r\nparticular description of it, from a German writer who saw it at\r\nDuesseldorf: so that it is unnecessary here to enter further into details on\r\nthe subject. We are pleased to learn that Messrs. Goupil, who own it,\r\nintend to have this work engraved in line by Girardet in the highest style,\r\nand upon a plate of the largest size ever used. The print will indeed cover\r\na surface equal to that of the famous one of Cardinal Richelieu, which some\r\nof our readers will not fail to remember.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNoctes Amicae.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"figure we cut\" in the Crystal Palace was for a long time a subject of\r\nsneers by amiable foreign critics, and a cause of ingenuous shame by too\r\nsensitive young gentlemen in white gloves, who went over from New-York and\r\nBoston to see society and the show. We remember that Mr. Greeley was said\r\nto be making himself appear excessively ridiculous by writing home that we\r\nshould come out very well notwithstanding we had no Kohinoor, and but\r\nlittle to boast of in the way of fancy articles in general. An excellent\r\nneighbor of ours down Broadway, who left London before the tide turned,\r\nsent a letter to the _Evening Post_, we believe, of the regret felt by the\r\n\"respectable Americans in Europe\" that we had been so weak as to enter into\r\nthis competition at all. But see what the _Times_ has said of the matter\r\nsince the first of October:\r\n\r\n     \"One point that strikes us forcibly on a survey of the\r\n     last few months is, the extraordinary contrast which\r\n     the attractive and the useful features of the display\r\n     present. It will be remembered that the American\r\n     department was at first regarded as the poorest and\r\n     least interesting of all foreign countries. Of late it\r\n     has justly assumed a position of the first importance,\r\n     as having brought to the aid of our distressed\r\n     agriculturists a machine which, if it realizes the\r\n     anticipations of competent judges, _will amply\r\n     remunerate England for all her outlay connected with\r\n     the Great Exhibition_. The reaping machine from the\r\n     United States is the most valuable contribution from\r\n     abroad to the stock of our previous knowledge that we\r\n     have yet discovered.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n     \"It seems to us that the great event of 1851 will\r\n     hereafter be found blemished by a _grand oversight_.\r\n     Attracted by the novelty and splendid success of the\r\n     occasion, we have certainly yielded more admiration to\r\n     the grand and the beautiful than to the unostentatious,\r\n     the practical, and the useful. The captivating luxuries\r\n     which are adapted to the few have entered more largely\r\n     into our imaginations and our hearts, than those\r\n     objects which are adapted to supply the homely comforts\r\n     and the unpretending wants of the many. We have thought\r\n     more of gold and silver work--of silks, satins, and\r\n     velvets--of rich brocades, splendid carpets, glowing\r\n     tapestry, and all that tends to embellish and adorn\r\n     life, than of the vast and still unexplored fields\r\n     which the necessities of the humbler classes all over\r\n     the world are constantly opening up to us. France has\r\n     thus been enabled to run quietly away with fifty-six\r\n     out of about one hundred and sixty of our great medals,\r\n     while to the department of American \"notions\" we owe\r\n     the most confessed and the most important contribution\r\n     to our industrial system.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n     \"Well worthy of notice is the Maynard primer, a\r\n     substitution for the percussion-cap, which is simply a\r\n     coil of paper, at intervals in which spots of\r\n     detonating powder are placed. The action of the doghead\r\n     carries out from the chamber in which it is contained\r\n     this cheap and self-acting substitute for the ordinary\r\n     gun apparatus, which is a vast economy in expense as\r\n     well as in time. In its character the invention is one\r\n     which admits of being easily adapted to every\r\n     description of firearms at present commonly in use, and\r\n     that at a trifling cost.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same pleasant way are noticed our Mr. Hobbs, his locks, and a score\r\nor so of similarly ingenious productions; and as for Mr. Palmer's _leg_, it\r\nis declared the chief astonisher contributed by all the world--so perfect,\r\nindeed, that some of the journals recommend a general cutting off of\r\nnatural understandings in order to adopt the always comfortable and\r\nwell-conditioned substitute introduced by our countryman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA considerable number of shameless women and feeble-minded men met in\r\nconvention--a sort of caldron of sickly sentimentalism, brazen atheism, and\r\nwhatever is most ridiculous and disgusting in the diseases of society,--at\r\nWorcester in Massachusetts, on the 14th of October, and continued in\r\nsession three days. A Mrs. Rose (who, we understand, generally makes the\r\nleading speeches of the Tom Paine birth-night festivals in New-York), and\r\nAbby Kelley Foster, and William L. Garrison, were among the principal\r\nactors. The main propositions before this convention, so far as they can be\r\nascertained from the newspaper reports, involve the setting aside of the\r\nlaws of God as they are revealed in the Bible; the laws of custom in all\r\nsavage and civilized, pagan and Christian communities, in every age; and\r\nthe laws of analogy--vindicating the existing order of society--in every\r\ngrade of animated nature. Complaints have been made that persons of\r\ncharacter, like the Rev. H. W. Beecher of Brooklyn, in some way sanctioned\r\nthe mummery by writing letters to its managers. Such eccentricities may be\r\npardonable, but the public will be sure to remember them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA female, probably a cheap dress maker, named Dexter, has been lecturing in\r\nLondon on the \"Bloomer costume;\" and it appears to have been assumed by\r\nher, as well as in many English journals, that this ridiculous and indecent\r\ndress is common in American cities, where, as of course our readers know,\r\nif it is ever seen, it is on the persons of an abandoned class, or on those\r\nof vulgar women whose inordinate love of notoriety is apt to display itself\r\nin ways that induce their exclusion from respectable society. _Punch_ has\r\nsome very clever caricatures of \"Bloomerism,\" but it would surprise the\r\nconductor of that sprightly paper to learn, that, except persons who walk\r\nour St. Giles's at late hours, scarcely any New-Yorker has ever seen such a\r\ndress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere have never been remarked so many sudden deaths and suicides in Paris\r\nand in the suburbs, as within the last few weeks. The following is one of\r\nthe most extraordinary cases of suicide:\r\n\r\n     \"The body of a young man was found floating in the\r\n     Seine, near St. Cloud. The corpse appeared to have\r\n     remained some days in the water. The deceased appeared\r\n     to have been about 25 years of age, and to have\r\n     belonged to the higher class of society. His features\r\n     were handsome, his hair brown, and his beard long and\r\n     black. His linen was of the finest quality, and his\r\n     other clothing made in the latest fashion. A small\r\n     glass bottle, corked and sealed, was suspended from his\r\n     neck, in which was a paper writing, containing the\r\n     following words:--\"I am about to die! young, it is\r\n     true! and if my body be discovered a complaint may\r\n     perhaps be made. This I do not wish. An angel appeared\r\n     to me in a dream, who said to me, 'I am the Genius of\r\n     France. Royal blood circulates in your veins; but\r\n     before you occupy the sovereign power, which parties\r\n     are disputing in France, you must go to see the Eternal\r\n     Sovereign of all things.... God! ... die. Let the\r\n     waters of the Seine swallow your body. Fear not, you\r\n     shall revive when the hour of your triumph shall have\r\n     struck! I have spoken!' and the angel disappeared. I\r\n     have accomplished his desire. But I leave this writing\r\n     in case the celestial envoy may have deceived me. I\r\n     pray the Attorney-General to prosecute him,\r\n\r\n                          \"THE FUTURE KING OF FRANCE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe body has not been claimed, and the police authorities have instituted\r\nan inquiry to discover his family.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following clever and extraordinary story is told in the Paris _Droit_:\r\n\r\n     \"A commercial traveller, whose business frequently\r\n     called him from Orleans to Paris, M. Edmund D----, was\r\n     accustomed to go to an hotel, with the landlord of\r\n     which he was acquainted. Liking, like almost all\r\n     persons of his profession, to talk and joke, he was the\r\n     favorite of everybody in the hotel. A few days ago he\r\n     arrived, and was received with pleasure by all, but it\r\n     was observed that he was much less gay than usual. The\r\n     stories that he told, instead of being interesting as\r\n     formerly, were of a lugubrious character. On Thursday\r\n     evening, after supper, he invited the people of the\r\n     hotel to go to his chamber to take coffee, and he\r\n     promised to tell them a tale full of dramatic incident.\r\n     On entering the room, his guests saw on the bed, near\r\n     which he seated himself, a pair of pistols. 'My story,'\r\n     said he, 'has a sad _denouement_, and I require the\r\n     pistols to make it clearly understood.' As he had\r\n     always been accustomed, in telling his tales, to\r\n     indulge expressive pantomime, and to take up anything\r\n     which lay handy, calculated to add to the effect, no\r\n     surprise was felt at his having prepared pistols. He\r\n     began by narrating the loves of a young girl and a\r\n     young man. They had both, he said, promised, under the\r\n     most solemn oaths, inviolable fidelity. The young man,\r\n     whose profession obliged him to travel, once made a\r\n     long absence. Whilst he was away, he received a legacy,\r\n     and on his return hastened to place it at her feet. But\r\n     on presenting himself before her he learned that, in\r\n     compliance with the wishes of her family, she had just\r\n     married a wealthy merchant. The young man thereupon\r\n     took a terrible resolution. 'He purchased a pair of\r\n     pistols, like these,' he continued, taking one in each\r\n     hand, 'then he assembled his friends in his chamber,\r\n     and, after some conversation, placed one under his\r\n     chin, in this way, as I do, saying in a joke that it\r\n     would be a real pleasure to blow out his brains. And at\r\n     the same moment he pulled the trigger.' Here the man\r\n     discharged the pistol, and his head was shattered to\r\n     pieces. Pieces of the bone and portions of the brain\r\n     fell on the horrified spectators. The unfortunate man\r\n     had told his own story.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe find in the _Evening Post_ the following notice of the citation of Mr.\r\nG. P. R. JAMES in the courts, under the head of \"Brown Linen against Law\r\nCalf:\"\r\n\r\n     \"Immediately previous to the sort of intermittent\r\n     equinoctial which has recently prevailed, the full\r\n     bench of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, presided\r\n     over by Chief Justice Shaw, were at session at Lenox,\r\n     in the county of Berkshire. Among the cases that were\r\n     brought up for adjudication, was an action of _trespass\r\n     quare clausum fregit_, brought by a farmer against a\r\n     number of individuals, who in common with many others,\r\n     had, at a time last winter, when the public highway was\r\n     rendered impassible by ice and snow, made a temporary\r\n     road over the farmer's grounds without leave or license\r\n     first had and obtained. Mr. Sumner, of Barrington, the\r\n     leading counsel of the county, appeared for the\r\n     defence, and in enforceing his views, took occasion to\r\n     read from Macaulay's late History of England, several\r\n     passages to illustrate the state of land communication\r\n     in that county, at the time of which he writes. From\r\n     that author it appears that upon one occasion, worthy\r\n     Mr. Pepys, our friend of the 'naif' diary, while\r\n     travelling somewhere (we think in Lincolnshire, but\r\n     have not the book before us for reference), got his\r\n     '_belle voiture_', as Cardinal Richelieu used to call\r\n     his antediluvian vehicle, stuck in the mud so that it\r\n     could not be extricated, and Mr. Sumner went on to\r\n     argue, that by the common law, Mr. Pepys then was, and\r\n     anybody now is, justified, in cases of necessity, in\r\n     passing over private domains without becoming liable to\r\n     the owner in damages. Mr. Porter, recently District\r\n     Attorney, was for the plaintiff, and, in answering that\r\n     part of his adversary's argument, to which we have\r\n     above alluded, claimed the indulgence of the court to\r\n     state, that a certain author had been quoted upon the\r\n     other side, who had hardly as yet been recognized as\r\n     authority in a court of justice, upon a mere law\r\n     question, at least; that such being the case, he\r\n     claimed the liberty to read from another writer, the\r\n     late historiographer royal of Great Britain, a\r\n     gentleman whose statements were certainly entitled to\r\n     overrule the others in a question of that sort; and\r\n     thereupon Mr. Porter commenced reading the first\r\n     chapter of Mr. G. P. R. James's new novel of 'The\r\n     Fate,' in which he so indignantly denounces the falsity\r\n     of Macaulay's picture of the social condition of\r\n     England two centuries ago. This created no little\r\n     merriment, both on the bench and among the gentlemen of\r\n     the robe, all admitting that it was the first time\r\n     within their knowledge, that the black linen and the\r\n     brown paper had usurped the place of the consecrated\r\n     law calf, before an American tribunal at least.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA French critic has just revealed a portrait of the favorite of Lamartine\r\nand numerous other writers on the Revolution--St. Just, from which it\r\nappears that he was the author of a long poem entitled _Orgaut_. The\r\nopinion which the historians have caused the public to form of this man\r\nwas, that he was a fanatic--implacable, but sincere--a ruthless minister of\r\nthe guillotine, but deeming wholesale slaughter indispensable for securing,\r\nwhat he conscientiously considered, the welfare of the people. He was, we\r\nmight imagine, something like the gloomy inquisitors of old, who thought it\r\nwas doing God service to burn heretics at the stake.\r\n\r\n     A correspondent of the _Athenaeum_ observes, that \"To\r\n     justify this opinion, one would have expected to have\r\n     found in a poem written by him when the warm and\r\n     generous sentiments of youth were in all their\r\n     freshness, burning aspirations for what it was the\r\n     fashion of his time to call _vertu_, and lavish\r\n     protestations of devotedness to his country and the\r\n     people. But instead of that, the work is, it appears,\r\n     from beginning to end, full of the grossest\r\n     obscenity--it is the delirium of a brain maddened with\r\n     voluptuousness--it is coarser and more abominable than\r\n     the 'Pucelle' of Voltaire, and is not relieved, as that\r\n     is, by sparkling wit and graces of style. In a moral\r\n     point of view, it is atrocious--in a literary point of\r\n     view, wretched. The discovery of such a production will\r\n     be a sad blow to the stern fanatics of these days, who\r\n     look on the blood-stained men of the Revolution with\r\n     admiration and awe--who make them the martyred saints\r\n     of their calendar--and whose hope by day and dream by\r\n     night is to have the opportunity of imitating them. Of\r\n     the whole band St. Just has hitherto been considered\r\n     the purest--he has always been accepted as the very\r\n     personification of 'virtue' in its most sublime form.\r\n     Even the immaculate Maximilien Robespierre himself has\r\n     never had the honor of having admitted that he\r\n     approached him in moral grandeur. And now, behold! this\r\n     'virtuous' angel is proved to have been a debauched and\r\n     loathsome-minded wretch! But, to be sure, that was\r\n     before he began cutting off heads, and wholesale\r\n     murders on the political scaffold redeem a multitude of\r\n     sins.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few days ago the French President received a gift of the most rich\r\nbouquets from the market women of Paris, and at the same time an\r\napplication for permission to visit him at the palace. This was granted,\r\nand full three hundred of the flower of the female merchants in fruit and\r\nvegetables of the faubourgs, dressed in their utmost finery, were received\r\nby the officers in attendance, and ushered through the saloons of the\r\nElysee.\r\n\r\nThe London _Times_ correspondent says:\r\n\r\n     \"After admiring the furniture, paintings, &c., they\r\n     were conducted to the gardens, where they enjoyed\r\n     themselves for some time. Refreshments were then laid\r\n     out in the dining-room, and they were invited to\r\n     partake of the President's hospitality. The champagne\r\n     was passing round pretty freely when the President\r\n     entered. They received him with acclamations of '_Vive\r\n     Napoleon!_' The President, after the usual salutations,\r\n     took a glass of wine, and proposed the toast, '_A la\r\n     sante des dames de la Halle de Paris!_' which was\r\n     responded to in a becoming manner; and '_La sante de\r\n     Napoleon!_' was in turn proposed by an elderly matron,\r\n     and loudly cheered. The ladies were particularly\r\n     pleased at finding the bouquets presented yesterday\r\n     arranged in the dining-room. Louis Napoleon chatted for\r\n     some time with his visitors, and expressed, in warm\r\n     terms, the pleasure he felt at seeing them under his\r\n     roof. The ladies requested that one of their\r\n     companions--the most distinguished for personal\r\n     attractions, as for youth--should be allowed to embrace\r\n     him in the name of the others. _Such_ a request no man\r\n     could hesitate to grant, and the fair one who was\r\n     deputed to bestow the general salute advanced, blushing\r\n     and trembling, to perform the duty. Louis Napoleon went\r\n     through the pleasing ceremony with much credit to\r\n     himself, and apparently to the great satisfaction of\r\n     those present. In a short time the visitors asked\r\n     permission to retire, after again thanking the\r\n     President for the honor he did them. Before separating\r\n     they united in one last and loud acclamation of '_Vive\r\n     Napoleon_.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHNSON J. HOOPER, the author of _Captain Simon Suggs_, and several other\r\nworks similar to that famous performance in humor and in the\r\ncharacteristics of southern life, is editor of _The Chambers Tribune_,\r\npublished somewhere in Alabama. Few papers have as much of the quality\r\nwhich is commonly described by the word \"spicy.\" In a late number we have\r\nan election anecdote which will serve as a specimen. The hero is Colonel A.\r\nQ. Nicks, of Talladega. We quote:\r\n\r\n     \"The Colonel had incurred, somehow, the enmity of a\r\n     certain preacher--one who had once been ejected from\r\n     his church and subsequently restored. The parson,\r\n     besides, was no favorite with his neighbors. Well, when\r\n     Nicks was nominated, parson Slashem 'norated' it\r\n     publicly that when Nicks should be elected, his (the\r\n     parson's) land would be for sale, and himself ready to\r\n     emigrate. Well, the Colonel went round the county a\r\n     time or two, and found he was 'bound to go;' and\r\n     shortly after arriving at that highly satisfactory\r\n     conclusion, espying the parson in a crowd he was\r\n     addressing, sung out to him: 'I say, brother Slashem,\r\n     begin to fix up your _muniments_--draw your deeds--I am\r\n     going to represent these people, _certain_! But before\r\n     you leave, let me give you thanks for declaring your\r\n     intention as soon as you did; for on that account I am\r\n     getting all of your church and the most part of your\r\n     neighbors!' The parson has not been heard of since.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a late number of Mr. CHARLES DICKENS'S _Household Words_, there is an\r\namusing and suggestive paper on Nursery Rhymes, wherein the ferocious\r\nmorals embalmed in jog-trot verse are indicated, for the reflective\r\nconsideration of all parents. A terrible case is made out against these\r\nlisping moralists: slaughter, cruelty, bigotry, injustice, wanton delight\r\nin terrible accidents and awful punishments for trivial offences, ferocity\r\nof every kind--such a mass of \"shocking notions\" as would people our\r\nnurseries with demons, were it not for the happy indifference of children\r\nto anything but the rhyme, rhythm, and quaint image.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn France, we have the _Univers_ regretting that Luther was not burnt, and\r\nthat the church has not still the power to use the stake; and in England we\r\nhave the _Rambler_, a journal which is considered the organ of the moderate\r\nparty, as distinct from that of the _Tablet_, boldly expressing wishes and\r\nhopes of an even more debatable character. The creed of the king of Naples\r\nis authoritatively declared to be that of every Catholic. In a late number\r\nit is said--\r\n\r\n     \"Believe us not, Protestants of England and Ireland,\r\n     for an instant, when you see us pouring forth our\r\n     liberalisms. When you hear a Catholic orator at some\r\n     Catholic assemblage declaring solemnly that 'this is\r\n     the most humiliating day in his life, when he is called\r\n     upon to defend once more the glorious principle of\r\n     religious freedom'--(especially if he says any thing\r\n     about the Emancipation Act and the 'toleration' it\r\n     _conceded_ to Catholics)--be not too simple in your\r\n     credulity. These are brave words, but they mean\r\n     nothing; no, nothing more than the promises of a\r\n     parliamentary candidate to his constituents on the\r\n     hustings. _He is not talking Catholicism, but nonsense\r\n     and Protestantism_; and he will no more act on these\r\n     notions in different circumstances, than _you_ now act\r\n     on them yourselves in your treatment of him. You ask,\r\n     if he were lord in the land, and you were in a\r\n     minority, if not in numbers yet in power, what would he\r\n     do to you? That, we say, would entirely depend upon\r\n     circumstances. If it would benefit the cause of\r\n     Catholicism, he would tolerate you: if expedient he\r\n     would imprison you, banish you, fine you; possibly, _he\r\n     might even hang you_. But be assured of one thing: he\r\n     would never tolerate you for the sake of the 'glorious\r\n     principles of civil and religious liberty.'\"\r\n\r\nAgain, it is said--\r\n\r\n     \"Why are we so anxious to make the church wear the garb\r\n     of the world? Why do we stoop, and bow, and cringe\r\n     before that enemy whom we are sent to conquer and\r\n     _annihilate_? Why are we ashamed of the deeds of our\r\n     more consistent forefathers, _who did only what they\r\n     were bound to do by the first principles of\r\n     Catholicism_?... Shall I foster that damnable doctrine,\r\n     that Socinianism, and Calvinism, and Anglicanism, and\r\n     Judaism, are not every one of them mortal sins, like\r\n     murder and adultery? Shall I lend my countenance to\r\n     this unhappy persuasion of my brother, that he is not\r\n     flying in the face of Almighty God every day that he\r\n     remains a Protestant? Shall I hold out hopes to him\r\n     that I will not meddle with his creed if he will not\r\n     meddle with mine? Shall I lead him to think that\r\n     religion is a matter for private opinion, and tempt him\r\n     to forget _that he has no more right to his religious\r\n     views than he has to my purse, or my house, or my\r\n     life-blood_? No! Catholicism is the most intolerant of\r\n     creeds. It is intolerance itself, for it is truth\r\n     itself. We might as rationally maintain that a sane man\r\n     has a right to believe that two and two do not make\r\n     four, as this theory of religious liberty. Its impiety\r\n     is only equalled by its absurdity.\"\r\n\r\nWe refer above to the _Univers_, the organ of the Roman Catholic party in\r\nFrance. The editor of that print, at a dinner recently given for Bishop\r\nHughes, at the Astor House, was complimented in a toast by our excellent\r\ncollector, Maxwell, who, of course, endorses the following choice\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n     \"A heretic,\" observes the editor of the _Univers_,\r\n     \"examined and convicted by the church, used to be\r\n     delivered over to the secular power, and punished with\r\n     death. Nothing has ever appeared to us more natural, or\r\n     more necessary. More than 100,000 persons perished in\r\n     consequence of the heresy of Wicliff; a still greater\r\n     number by that of John Huss; it would not be possible\r\n     to calculate the bloodshed caused by the heresy of\r\n     Luther, and _it is not yet over_. After three centuries\r\n     we are at the eve of a recommencement. The prompt\r\n     repression of the disciples of Luther, and a crusade\r\n     against Protestantism, would have spared Europe three\r\n     centuries of discord and of catastrophes in which\r\n     France and civilization may perish. It was under the\r\n     influence of such reflections that I wrote the phrase\r\n     which has so excited the virtuous indignation of the\r\n     Red journals. Here it is:--'For my part, I avow frankly\r\n     my regret is not only that they did not sooner burn\r\n     John Huss, but that they did not equally burn Luther;\r\n     and I regret, further, that there had not been at the\r\n     same time some prince sufficiently pious and politic to\r\n     have made a crusade against the Protestants.' Well,\r\n     this paragraph might have been better penned; but as I\r\n     have the happiness to belong to those who care little\r\n     about mere forms of expression, I will not revoke it. I\r\n     accept it as it is, and with a certain satisfaction at\r\n     finding myself faithful to my opinions. That which I\r\n     wrote in 1838 I still believe. Let the Red\r\n     philanthropists print their declaration in any sort of\r\n     type they please, and as often as they please. Let them\r\n     add their commentaries, and place all to my account.\r\n     The day that I cancel it, they will be justified in\r\n     holding the opinion of me which I hold of them.\"\r\n\r\nFar be it from us to meddle with the quarrels of the theologians--even by\r\nreprinting any attack an adversary makes on the worst of them. We merely\r\ncopy these paragraphs from famous defenders of the Catholic Church, as an\r\nact of justice to her, against those slandering Protestants who say she has\r\nchanged--she, the infallible and ever consistent!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe \"leading journal of the world\" occasionally indulges in a pleasantry,\r\nas in this example:\r\n\r\n     \"A surgical operation under the influence of chloroform\r\n     has just terminated fatally, to the regret of the\r\n     public, to whom the patient was well known. One of the\r\n     brown bears in the Zoological Garden suffering from\r\n     cataract of the eye, an eminent surgeon and a party of\r\n     _gelehrter_ assembled to undertake his cure. Bruin was\r\n     tempted to the bars of his den by the offer of some\r\n     bread, and then secured by ropes and a muzzle. After a\r\n     stout resistance, chloroform was administered. In a\r\n     state of insensibility the cataract was removed, and\r\n     the bonds untied, but the patient showed no signs of\r\n     life! Feathers to the nose, cold buckets of water, and\r\n     bleeding produced no effect. Poor Bruin had gone\r\n     whither the great tortoise, two ostriches, and the\r\n     African lion have preceded him, for the managers of the\r\n     Berlin gardens are decidedly unlucky. With the trifling\r\n     drawback of the death of the subject, the operation was\r\n     skilfully and successfully performed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe find the following anecdote as related by Baron OLDHAUSEN: it conveys an\r\nadmirable lesson:\r\n\r\n     \"Charles XII., of Sweden, condemned a soldier, and\r\n     stood at a distance from the place of execution. The\r\n     fellow, when he heard this, was in hopes of a pardon,\r\n     but being assured that he was mistaken, replied with a\r\n     loud voice, 'My tongue is still free, and I will use it\r\n     at my pleasure.' He did so, and charged the king, with\r\n     much insolence, and as loud as he could speak, with\r\n     injustice and barbarity, and appealed to God for\r\n     revenge. The king, not hearing him distinctly, inquired\r\n     what the soldier had been saying. A general officer,\r\n     unwilling to sharpen his resentment against the poor\r\n     man, told his majesty he had only repeated with great\r\n     earnestness, 'That God loves the merciful, and teaches\r\n     the mighty to moderate their anger.' The king was\r\n     touched by these words, and sent his pardon to the\r\n     criminal. A courtier, however, in an opposite interest,\r\n     availed himself of this occasion and repeated to the\r\n     king exactly the licentious expressions which the\r\n     fellow uttered, adding gravely, that 'men of quality\r\n     ought never to misrepresent facts to their sovereign.'\r\n     The king for some moments stood pausing, and then\r\n     turned to the courtier, saying, with reproving looks,\r\n     'This is the first time I have been betrayed to my\r\n     advantage; but the lie of your enemy gave me more\r\n     pleasure than your truth has done.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA report is current in Europe that an expedition is to be sent from France\r\ninto the sea of Japan. It is said that it will consist of a frigate, a\r\ncorvette, and a steamer, under the orders of a Rear-Admiral who has long\r\nnavigated in the Pacific Ocean and the Chinese seas. \"This expedition\r\nwill\", it is added, \"be at once military, commercial, and scientific, and\r\nhas for object to open to European commerce states which have been closed\r\nagainst it since the sixteenth century.\" Notwithstanding the sanction which\r\nthe principle involved received a few years ago, from an illustrious\r\nAmerican, we cannot regard the proposed expedition otherwise than as an act\r\nof the most shameless villainy by a nation. The Japanese are a peculiar\r\nrace, and our readers who have seen a series of articles on the subject of\r\ntheir civilization and polity in late numbers of the _Tribune_, will not be\r\ndisposed to think the people of Japan inferior to those of France, just\r\nnow, in any of the best elements of a state. We, as well as the Japanese\r\nthemselves, understand perfectly well that the opening of their ports to\r\nthe Europeans and Americans, would be followed by the demoralization and\r\noverthrow of their empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. CARLYLE, in the following brief composition, of which the original was\r\nshown us a few days ago, furnishes a model for autograph writers.\r\n\r\n     \"George W.

The following from the Manchester _Courier_, shows that the great\r\nlawyer has a worthy follower in Baron Platt:\r\n\r\n     \"At the recent assizes at Liverpool, a stabbing case\r\n     from Manchester was heard before Baron Platt, who, in\r\n     summing up to the jury, used these words: 'One of the\r\n     witnesses tells you that he said to the prisoner, 'If\r\n     you use your knife you are a d----d coward;' I say\r\n     also,' continued the learned judge, apparently in deep\r\n     thought, 'that he was a d----d coward, and any man is a\r\n     d----d coward who will use a knife.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe printers of London are endeavoring to establish, in imitation of the\r\n_Printers' Library_ in New-York, a literary institution to be called \"The\r\nPrinters' Athenaeum,\" and have received considerable encouragement from\r\ncompositors, and the trades connected with printing, as typefounders,\r\nbookbinders, engravers, letter-press and copper-plate printers, &c., the\r\nmembers of which are eligible. The object is to combine the social\r\nadvantages of a club with the mental improvement of a literary and\r\nscientific institution, and to adapt them for the position and\r\ncircumstances of the working classes. All persons engaged in the production\r\nof a newspaper, or book, such as editors, authors, reporters, readers, &c.,\r\nalthough strictly not belonging to the profession, are competent to become\r\nmembers, and persons not so connected will be permitted to join the society\r\non their being proposed by a member. It is expected that the Athenaeum will\r\nbe opened before the commencement of the ensuing year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA MADRID correspondent writes to one of the London journals:\r\n\r\n     \"The infant princess to whom the Duchess of Montpensier\r\n     has just given birth has received the names of Maria\r\n     Amalia Luisa Enriqueta Felipa Antonia Fernanda Cristina\r\n     Isabel Adelaida Jesusa Josefa Joaquina Ana Francisca de\r\n     Asis Justa Rufina Francisca de Paula Ramona Elena\r\n     Carolina Bibiana Polonia Gaspara Melchora Baltasara\r\n     Augustina Sabina.\"\r\n\r\nDoubtless there was an extra charge for the christening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical Review of the Month.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn increasing activity is observable in whatever points to the next\r\nPresidential election, and several eminent persons have recently defined\r\ntheir relations to the most exciting and important questions to be affected\r\nin that contest. Among others, ex-Vice President Dallas, ex-Secretary of\r\nthe Navy Paulding, and Mr. Henry Clay, have written letters on the state of\r\nthe nation as respects the slavery question. Meantime, the people of South\r\nCarolina have repudiated the doctrine and policy of secession by electing\r\nonly two members in the whole state favorable to their views in the\r\nConvention called for the consideration of that subject; Georgia and\r\nMississippi have given overwhelming majorities on the same side; and\r\nPennsylvania appears to have asserted not less unquestionably her\r\nattachment to the Union and the Compromise, in electing Mr. Bigler\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the several states are without special significance except\r\nin the matter of elections, of which we have indicated the general results\r\nas altogether favorable to the Union and the enforcement of the laws of\r\nCongress. Returns, however, are at the time when we go to press so\r\nimperfect, that we attempt no particular details respecting candidates or\r\nmajorities. In Pennsylvania and Ohio, as in the Southern States, the\r\ndemocrats have a perfect ascendency; in Maryland the whigs have been\r\nsuccessful; in California it appears to be doubtful as to the Governor, but\r\nthe democrats have a control in the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe most important news from California relates to the movement for\r\ndividing the state, and making that part of it lying south of the\r\nthirty-seventh degree of north latitude a separate commonwealth. If this\r\nproject should be carried into effect, slavery would, no doubt, be\r\nintroduced into Southern California; but there is not much prospect of its\r\nbeing successful. A convention of delegates from the southern counties, to\r\nbe held at Los Angelos, Santa Barbara, or Monterey, is called for the\r\npurpose of interchanging sentiments on the subject, so that the Legislature\r\nmay take the matter into consideration. The accounts from the mining\r\ndistricts continue to be favorable; improvements are in successful progress\r\nin various gold-bearing districts; and the yield of the precious metal is\r\nsuch as to reward the enterprise and industry of the miner. San Francisco\r\nand Sacramento have again been disgraced by the conduct of scoundrel bands\r\nusurping the functions of government and putting to death such persons as\r\nwere obnoxious to their prejudices or guilty of offences which the law\r\nofficers might have punished.\r\n\r\nFrom the Mormon City at Salt Lake, intelligence is received of continued\r\nprosperity. Mr. Bernheisel, last year agent for the territory in this city\r\nto obtain a library for Utah, is chosen territorial delegate to Congress.\r\n\r\nAfter a protracted contest for Provisional Bishop of the diocese of\r\nNew-York, Dr. Creighton, of Tarrytown, has been elected to that office. He\r\nis a native of this city, and graduated in Columbia College in 1812,\r\nafterwards officiated in Grace Church, was next appointed Rector of St.\r\nMark's, Bowery, whence he was called to Tarrytown, where he now resides.\r\n\r\nLouis Kossuth, having been set at liberty by the Turkish government, will\r\nvery soon arrive in the United States, where extraordinary demonstrations\r\nof respect will be offered to him in several of the principal cities. About\r\nnine months ago Kossuth committed to the care of Mr. Frank Taylor, a young\r\nAmerican visiting Broussa, the MS. of an address to the people of this\r\ncountry, which was published in a translation, at New-York, on the 18th of\r\nOctober--having been withheld until that time lest its earlier appearance\r\nshould affect injuriously the interests of its author in Europe. The\r\nfriends of liberty will rejoice that Kossuth is free, and in a land of\r\nliberty; but it is not improbable that future events will demonstrate, that\r\nthe Austrian government was not altogether unreasonable in protesting\r\nagainst his enlargement. Kossuth and Mazzini are scarcely less terrible to\r\ntyrants, as writers, than as the leaders of armies and the masters of\r\ncabinets.\r\n\r\nAlthough extraordinary prosperity in a state may sometimes lead to\r\narrogance and injustice, the position of this country toward several\r\nEuropean powers who intimate an intention of compelling a certain policy on\r\nour part in regard to Spain, must insure a triumphant consideration of the\r\n_Union_, in which we have a strength that may laugh their leagues to scorn.\r\nThe details of an arrangement between Spain, France, and Great Britain, are\r\nnot yet perfectly understood in the United States, but it is generally\r\nknown that some plan has been adopted which will be likely to draw from the\r\nSecretary of State a sequel to his letter to Mr. Hulseman, the Austrian\r\n_charge d'Affaires_, whose experiences were made known a year ago.\r\n\r\nThe vessels of the American exploring expedition in search of Sir John\r\nFranklin returned--the _Advance_ on the 30th of September, and the\r\n_Rescue_, which had separated from her on the banks of Newfoundland, a few\r\ndays after. It is probable that a full account of this heroic enterprise,\r\nso honorable to its authors and to all engaged in it, will soon be given to\r\nthe public, by Dr. Kane, or one of the other officers; and as any such\r\nbrief statement as we could present of its history would be unsatisfactory,\r\nwe shall not now go further into details than to say no traces of Sir John\r\nFranklin, except such as we have already noticed, were discovered, and that\r\nthe crews came home after a year's absence in excellent health. The nearly\r\nsimultaneous return of the British expedition has caused considerable\r\ndiscussion in England. It appears to be felt very generally that it is not\r\njustifiable to abandon the pursuit until the fate of Sir John Franklin has\r\nbeen demonstrated by actual observation. Such satisfaction is due to\r\nscience and to humanity. Proposals are now, we believe, before the\r\nAdmiralty, for sending into the Arctic seas one or more steamers, with\r\nwhich alone the search can be advantageously prosecuted further.\r\n\r\nA New-York ship, the Flying Cloud, made the passage round the Horn to San\r\nFrancisco in ninety days--shorter than any voyage on record. Her fastest\r\nday's run was 374 miles, beating the fleetest of Collins's steamers by\r\nfifty miles. In three successive days she made 992 miles. At this rate she\r\nwould cross the Atlantic in less than nine days.\r\n\r\nDiscouraging accounts have been received respecting the whale fleet in the\r\nNorth Pacific Ocean. After wintering in the gulf of Anadir, the fleet\r\nattempted to pass into the Arctic Ocean, when it became surrounded with\r\nfields of ice, by which not less than eight vessels are known to have been\r\ndestroyed, and it was supposed that upwards of sixty others had experienced\r\nthe same fate. Some of the crews of the lost ships reached the main land,\r\nbut afterwards got into difficulty with the natives and in consequence many\r\nof them were killed. The whale fishing, during the season, is said to have\r\nbeen an entire failure, and a number of vessels were on their return to the\r\nnorthwest coast, in the hope of retrieving their ill fortune.\r\n\r\nSeveral disastrous \"accidents\" have recently happened in various parts of\r\nthe country. On the 21st September, the steamer James Jackson, exploded\r\nnear Shawneetown in Illinois, killing and wounding 35. On the 26th\r\nSeptember, the Brilliant exploded near Bayou Sara, killing a yet larger\r\nnumber; and many such events of less importance, but probably involving\r\nmore or less criminality, have occurred on steamboats and railroads in\r\nvarious parts of the country. The most destructive fire since the\r\ncompletion of our last number was one at Buffalo, commencing on the 25th\r\nSeptember, and continuing until 200 buildings, on more than 30 acres, were\r\ndestroyed, and an immense number of poor families were made homeless. The\r\nfire extended over the meanest part of the town, but the loss is estimated\r\nat $300,000. For several days a destructive gale prevailed along the\r\neastern coast, producing an immense loss of life; a large number of dead\r\nbodies were taken from the holds of vessels. Great excitement has prevailed\r\nin Gloucester, Newburyport and other towns, a large portion of whose\r\npopulations were exposed to the fury of the storm. Further east, on the\r\ncoast of Nova-Scotia, the remains of sixty persons, lost during the storm,\r\nare said to have been buried in one grave. No less than 160 vessels, of all\r\nkinds, are reported to have been wrecked.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Jury sitting at Philadelphia have found bills of indictment\r\nagainst four white men and twenty-seven negroes, for treason, in\r\nparticipating in the outrage at Christiana, in the state of Pennsylvania.\r\nAt Syracuse on the 1st of October an attempt was made to rescue a slave,\r\nbut he was captured and his abettors arrested and conveyed to Auburn for\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe jury in the case of Margaret Garrity, who was tried at Newark for the\r\nmurder of a man named Drum, who seduced her under a promise of marriage,\r\nand afterwards deserted her for another, rendered a verdict of not guilty,\r\non the ground of insanity, on the 13th ult. This disgraceful proceeding had\r\nprecedents in New Jersey, and it appears to have excited but little of the\r\nindignation which it deserved. Margaret Garrity murdered her paramour under\r\nextraordinary circumstances, which, doubtless, would have had proper weight\r\nwith the pardoning power. It is evidently absurd to say, that she, more\r\nthan any murderess, was insane, and the jury were altogether unjustifiable\r\nin rendering a verdict which is unsupported by evidence; and of an\r\nassumption of the authority of the Governor of the State, in setting at\r\nliberty a criminal for whose conduct there appeared to be merely some sort\r\nof extenuation or excuse in the conduct of her victim. It would be as well\r\nto have no juries as juries so ignorant or reckless of their obligations.\r\n\r\nA general council of the once grand confederacy of the Five Nations of\r\nIndians, the Mohawks, Onondagas, Oneidas, Cayugas, Senecas, and\r\nTuscaroras--was held at Tonawanda on Friday, September 19th, to celebrate\r\nthe funeral rites of their last Grand Sachem, John Blacksmith, deceased,\r\nand of electing a Grand Sachem in his place, electing Chiefs, &c. Ely S.\r\nParker (Do-ne-ha-ga-wa), was proclaimed Grand Sachem of the Six Nations. He\r\nwas invested with the silver medal presented by Washington to the\r\ncelebrated war-chief Red Jacket, and worn by him until his death.\r\n\r\nThe new Canadian Ministry, so far as formed, is as follows:\r\nInspector-General, Mr. Hincks; President of the Council, Dr. Rolph;\r\nPostmaster-General, Malcolm Cameron; Commissioner of Crown Lands, William\r\nMorris; Attorney-General for Canada West, W. B. Richards; Attorney-General\r\nfor Canada East, Mr. Drummond; Provincial Secretary, Mr. Morin. Three\r\nappointments are yet to be made. The government will be eminently liberal.\r\n\r\nA revolution set on foot in Northern Mexico promises to be successful. The\r\nchief causes alleged by the conspirators are the enormous duties upon\r\nimports, and too severe punishment for smuggling, the excessive authority\r\nof the Central Government over the individual States, the quartering of\r\nregular troops upon citizens, the mal-administration of the national\r\nfinances, the bad system of military government inherited from the Spanish\r\nestablishment, and the want of a system of public education. The insurgents\r\ndeclare that they lay aside all idea of secession or annexation, yet it is\r\nnot impossible that the movement will soon have such an end. The revolution\r\ncommenced at Camargo, where the insurgents attacked the Mexicans, and came\r\noff victorious, having taken the town by storm, with a loss on the side of\r\nthe Mexicans of 60. The Government troops were intrenched in a church with\r\nartillery. The revolutionists are commanded by Carvajal, who has also with\r\nhim two companies of Texans. At our last dates, the 9th of September, they\r\nhad taken the town of Reynosa, meeting but little resistance. One\r\nfield-piece and a quantity of other arms fell into their hands. General\r\nCanales, the Governor of Tamaulipas, was approaching Metamoras, and General\r\nAvalajos was on the way to meet him, whether as friend or foe is uncertain.\r\nIt was supposed that Canales would assume the chief command of the\r\nrevolutionists.\r\n\r\nFrom New Grenada we learn that General Herrara has entirely subdued the\r\nrevolt lately undertaken, and that the country is quiet. A revolt has\r\nbroken out in Chili (a country remarkable in South America for the\r\nstability of its affairs), and in several towns the troops had declared in\r\nfavor of a new man for the Presidency: the disorganizers were sweeping all\r\nbefore them, and the country was in a most excited condition. From\r\nMontevideo the latest intelligence is so confused that we can arrive at no\r\ndefinite conclusion, except that the domestic war is prosecuted with\r\nunusual savageness. An insurrection has broken out in the states of San\r\nSalvador and Guatemala. General Carrera, with a force of 1,500 men, had\r\nattacked the enemy in San Salvador, who mustered 4,000 strong, and defeated\r\nthem with a loss of four men killed. He then evacuated the country.\r\n\r\nFrom Great Britain we have no political news of importance. The royal\r\nfamily were still in the north. The whig politicians appear to be agitating\r\nnew schemes of parliamentary reform, and several distinguished persons have\r\nrecently made addresses to their constituents. Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton is\r\nbefore his county as a protectionist candidate for the House of Commons,\r\nwith fair prospects. The submarine telegraph to France has been completed.\r\nThe great cable which was intended to reach the whole distance proved too\r\nshort by half a mile, owing to the irregularity of the line in which it was\r\nlaid down. It was pieced out with a coil of wire coated with gutta percha.\r\nThis will, however, have to be taken up and supplied with cable. The\r\nconnection is complete with France, and messages are sent across with\r\nperfect success. Mr. Lawrence, the American minister, having gone to\r\nIreland, for the purpose of seeing the scenery of the country, has been\r\nembarrassed with honors; public addresses have been presented to him,\r\nbanquets given to him, railway directors and commissioners of harbors have\r\nattended him in his journeys, a steamboat was specially fitted up to carry\r\nhim down the Shannon, and in every way such demonstrations of interest and\r\nhonor were offered as were suitable for a people's reception of a messenger\r\nfrom the home of their children. The visit of Mr. Lawrence promises some\r\nhappy results in directing attention to projects for a steam communication\r\ndirectly with the United States. The differences between the government of\r\nCalcutta and the court of Hyderabad, have been arranged for the present\r\nwithout any actual confiscation of the Nizam's territory. A considerable\r\nsum has been lodged in the hands of the Resident, and security offered for\r\nthe partial liquidation of the remainder. Moolraj, the ex-Dewan of Mooltan,\r\nexpired on the 11th August, while on his journey to the fortress of\r\nAllahabad, and the Vizier Yar Mohammed Khan, of Herat, died on the 4th of\r\nJune. The eldest son of the latter, Seyd Mahommed Khan, has succeeded to\r\nthe throne of Herat. Dost Mohammed is resolved to oppose him, and, for that\r\npurpose, has placed his son, Hyder Khan, at the head of a large army, with\r\norders to invade Herat. The Admiralty have advertised for tenders for a\r\nmonthly mail line of screw-steamers to and from England and the west coast\r\nof Africa. The ports to be touched at are Goree, Bathurst, Sierra Leone,\r\nMonrovia (Liberia), Cape Coast Castle, Accra, Whydah Badagry, Lagos, Bonny,\r\nOld Calabar, Cameroons, and Fernando Po. The whole range of the slave coast\r\nwill thus be included; and it is understood that the object of the line,\r\nwhich, in the first instance, of course will carry scarcely any passengers\r\nor letters, is to promote the extinction of that traffic, not only by\r\ncultivating commerce with the natives, but by the rapid and regular\r\ninformation it will convey from point to point. Of the Caffre war, we have\r\nintelligence by an arrival at Boston direct from the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nlater than has been received by way of England. There appeared to be some\r\nprospect of the war being brought to a close; reinforcements of troops had\r\narrived, and Sir Harry Smith, the Governor, was in excellent spirits. In\r\nthe mean time, however, the Caffres and Hottentots continued making sad\r\nhavoc on the settlements, and the people were suffering from a lack of\r\nprovisions, and cattle and stock were starving to death. Efficient measures\r\nhowever had in England been taken for their relief.\r\n\r\nFrom France, in the recess of the Assembly, there is no news of general\r\nimportance. The persecution of the press, by which more than one ruler of\r\nthat country has heretofore lost his place, is persevered in, and a large\r\nnumber of editors (including two sons of Victor Hugo) have been imprisoned\r\nand fined. All foreigners intending to reside permanently in Paris, or\r\nexercise any calling there, must henceforth present themselves personally\r\nto the authorities, and obtain permission to remain. This new and stringent\r\npolice-regulation is, it is said, to be extended to every department of\r\nFrance. Such fear of foreigners contrasts strangely with the unsuspicious\r\nwelcome which they receive in America and England. The President is\r\nevidently not willing his \"subjects\" should know what the world says of his\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Naples has caused to be published a formal reply to Mr.\r\nGladstone's letters to Lord Palmerston in respect to its unjustifiable\r\nseverity to political prisoners, particularly the ex-minister Poerio. It\r\nmainly consists of an exposure of some inaccuracies of detail on the part\r\nof Mr. Gladstone, such as an exaggeration of the number of political\r\nprisoners at present confined in Naples, the alleged innocence of Poerio,\r\nthe unhealthy state of the prisons, &c.; but it does not do away with the\r\ncharge of savage severity in the punishment of Poerio and his\r\nfellow-prisoners, which formed the main accusation advanced by Mr.\r\nGladstone against the Neapolitan Government, and it is not likely in any\r\nconsiderable degree to affect the opinion of the world on the subject. The\r\nPapal Court has addressed a note to the French Government, complaining of\r\nthe toleration, by the latter, of incendiary writings against Italian\r\nstates. The note observes that if the French journals were not to publish\r\nthese writings, the demagogues would be at a loss for organs of\r\ncirculation, because the English newspapers are much less read in Italy.\r\nThe Emperor of Austria has been making a tour through his Italian\r\nprovinces, in which he has been received with \"respectful silence\" in\r\nstreets deserted by all except the military and ungoverned children.\r\n\r\nFrom a diplomatic correspondence between the representatives of Austria and\r\nTurkey, in regard to the liberation of Kossuth and his companions, it is\r\nvery evident that Austria feels very keenly the discomfiture she has\r\nsustained, and that she will be very likely to resent this disregard of her\r\nwishes, by seeking cause of war with Turkey. She is stirring up rebellion\r\nin the Bosnian provinces, and concentrating her troops upon that frontier,\r\nto take advantage of any contingency that may arise. The authorities in\r\nHungary have been absurd enough to evince the spleen of the Austrians in\r\nhanging effigies of Kossuth and his associates, condemned for treason _in\r\ncontumace_.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal vigorous preparations were being made for elections, in which\r\nit was expected that Saldanha's friends would generally be defeated. At the\r\nCape de Verde Islands a terrible disease, described as a black plague, was\r\nvery fatal.\r\n\r\nThe differences between the governments of Turkey and Egypt are still\r\nunsettled, and the fate of the Egyptian railroad therefore remains\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Discoveries and Proceedings of Learned Societies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome recently received numbers of the _Nordische Biene_ contain interesting\r\ninformation concerning the organization and labors of the Russian\r\nGeographical Society. This body, like the Geographical and Statistical\r\nSociety organized a few weeks since in New-York, is modelled upon the\r\ngeneral plan of the Royal Geographical Society in London. It is, however,\r\nfar from being so universal in its aims; in fact, its members confine their\r\ninvestigations to the Russian empire, and to tribes and countries\r\ncontiguous therewith. The annual meeting is held on April 5th. At the last,\r\ntwo prizes were given; one of these was a gold medal offered by Prince\r\nConstantine, the other a money prize for the best statistical work. The\r\nmedal was awarded to Lieutenant-Colonel Buckhardt Lemm, for a series of\r\nastronomical observations, determining the latitude and longitude of some\r\nfour hundred places in Russia and the neighboring regions in Asia, as far\r\nas Mesched in Persia. These determinations are of particular value for the\r\ngeography of inner Asia. The statistical prize was awarded to a Mr.\r\nWoronoff for a historical and statistical survey of the educational\r\nestablishments in the district of St. Petersburg from 1715 to 1828. It is\r\nin fact a history of the development of mental culture in that most\r\nimportant part of the empire. The annual report, giving a survey of the\r\nSociety's doings, was interesting. A special object of attention is the\r\npublication of maps of the separate governments or provinces. The Society\r\nhad also caused an expedition to be sent to the Ural, under Colonel\r\nHoffmann. The triangulation of the country about Mount Ararat had been\r\ncompleted. A map of Asia Minor had been prepared by Col. Bolotoff, and sent\r\nto Paris to be engraved; a map of the Caspian sea, and the countries\r\nsurrounding it, was nearly completed by Mr. Chanykoff; the same savan was\r\nstill at work on a map of Asia between 35 deg. and 40 deg. north latitude, and 61 deg.\r\nand 81 deg. east longitude; two astronomers were engaged in that region making\r\nobservations to assist in its completion. Another map of Kokand and Bokhara\r\nwas also forthcoming, and the Society had employed Messrs Butakoff and\r\nChanykoff to prepare a complete atlas of Asia between 33 deg. and 56 deg. north\r\nlatitude and 65 deg. and 100 deg. east longitude. A Russian nobleman had given\r\n12,000 rubles to pay for making and publishing a Russian translation of\r\nRitter's geography, but the society had determined not to undertake so\r\nimmense a work (it is some 15,000 printed pages), and had determined only\r\nto take up those countries which have an immediate interest for Russia,\r\nusing along with Ritter a great body of materials to which he had not\r\naccess. These countries are Southern Siberia, Northern China, Turan,\r\nKorassan, Afghanistan and Persia. In Ritter's work these occupy 4,500\r\npages. No doubt the labors of the Society will greatly enrich geographical\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe Society have in hand an expedition to the peninsula of Kamschatka, in\r\nwhich they have been greatly assisted by the contributions of private\r\npersons. They also promise a classification of a vast collection of objects\r\nthey have received bearing upon the ethnography of Russia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe learn from the last Number of the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ that the\r\nFrench government has lately made a literary acquisition of no ordinary\r\ninterest and value. A French gentleman of the name of Perret has been\r\nengaged for six years in exploring THE CATACOMBS UNDER ROME, and copying,\r\nwith the most minute and scrupulous fidelity, the remains of ancient art\r\nwhich are hidden in those extraordinary chambers. Under the authority of\r\nthe papal government, and assisted by M. Savinien Petit, an accomplished\r\nFrench artist, M. Perret has explored the whole of the sixty catacombs\r\ntogether with the connecting galleries. Burying himself for five years in\r\nthis subterranean city, he has thoroughly examined every part of it, in\r\nspite of difficulties and perils of the gravest character: for example, the\r\nrefusal of his guides to accompany him; dangers resulting from the\r\nintricacy of the passages, from the necessity for clearing a way through\r\ngalleries choked up with earth which fell in from above almost as fast as\r\nit was removed; hazards arising from the difficulty of damming up streams\r\nof water which ran in upon them from above, and from the foulness of the\r\nair and consequent difficulty of breathing and preserving light in the\r\nlower chambers;--all these, and many other perils, have been overcome by\r\nthe honorable perseverance of M. Perret, and he has returned to France with\r\na collection of drawings which extends to 360 sheets in large folio; of\r\nwhich 154 sheets contain representations of frescoes, 65 of monuments, 23\r\nof paintings on glass (medallions inserted in the walls and at the bottoms\r\nof vases) containing 86 subjects, 41 drawings of lamps, vases, rings, and\r\ninstruments of martyrdom to the number of more than 100 subjects, and\r\nfinally 90 contain copies of more than 500 sepulchral inscriptions. Of the\r\n154 drawings of frescoes two-thirds are inedited, and a considerable number\r\nhave been only lately discovered. Amongst the latter are the paintings on\r\nthe celebrated wells of Platonia, said to have been the place of interment,\r\nfor a certain period, of St. Peter and St. Paul. This spot was ornamented\r\nwith frescoes by order of Pope Damasus, about A.D. 365, and has ever since\r\nremained closed up. Upon opening the empty tomb, by permission of the Roman\r\ngovernment, M. Perret discovered fresco paintings representing the Saviour\r\nand the Apostles, and two coffins [tombeaux] of Parian marble. On the\r\nreturn of M. Perret to France, the minister of the interior (M. Leon\r\nFaucher) entered into treaty with him for the acquisition of his collection\r\nfor the nation. The purchase has been arranged, and the necessary amount,\r\nupwards of 7,500_l._, obtained by a special vote of the National Assembly.\r\nThe drawings will be published by the French government in a style\r\ncommensurate with their high importance, both as works of art and as\r\ninvaluable monuments of Christian antiquity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Dr. JECKER has left the Paris _Academy of Sciences_ $40,000 to found an\r\nannual prize in organic chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent Deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Mrs. SHERWOOD, the most popular and universally known female\r\nwriter of the last generation, died on the 22d of September, at Twickenham,\r\nin England. She was a daughter of Dr. George Butt, chaplain to George III.,\r\nvicar of Kidderminster, and rector of Stanford, in the county of Worcester.\r\nDr. Butt was the representative of the family of Sir William De Butts, well\r\nknown as physician to Henry VIII., and mentioned as such by Shakspeare.\r\nMary Martha Butt, afterwards Mrs. Sherwood, was born at Stanford,\r\nWorcestershire, on the 6th of May, 1775. In 1803 she married her cousin,\r\nHenry Sherwood, of the 53d regiment of foot. In 1805 she accompanied her\r\nhusband to India, where, in consequence of her zealous labors in the cause\r\nof religion amongst the soldiers and natives dwelling around her, Henry\r\nMartyn and the Right Rev. Daniel Corrie, D.D., late Bishop of Madras,\r\nbecame acquainted with her, and the intimacy which then commenced also\r\nremained unbroken until death. Her principal works were that favorite tale\r\nof _Little Henry and his Bearer_, _The Lady of the Manor_, _The Church\r\nCatechism_, _The Nun_, _Henry Milner_, _The Fairchild Family_, and more\r\nrecently, _The Golden Garland of Inestimable Delights_. In some of her\r\nlater compositions, she evinced a tendency to the doctrine of the\r\nUniversalists, which lessened her popularity. The great number of her books\r\nprevents an enumeration of even the most popular of them. Mrs. Sherwood's\r\nhusband, Captain Sherwood, expired, after a most trying illness, at\r\nTwickenham, on the 6th of December, 1849; the fatigue she went through, in\r\ndevoted attention to him, and the bereavement she experienced at the\r\nseverance by fate of a union of nearly half a century, were the ultimate\r\ncauses of her own demise. Though she was of advanced age, her mental\r\nfaculties never failed her, and she preserved a religious cheerfulness of\r\nmind to the last. She expired, surrounded by her family, leaving one son,\r\nthe Rev. Henry Martyn Sherwood, Rector of Broughton-Hacket, and Vicar of\r\nWhite Ladies Aston, Worcestershire, and two daughters. The elder daughter\r\nis the wife of a clergyman, and mother of a numerous family. The younger\r\nhas always resided with her parent; she has of late years ably assisted in\r\nher mother's writings, and bids fair to sustain well her reputation. She\r\nhas been, we are informed, intrusted, by her mother's especial desire, with\r\nthe papers containing the records of Mrs. Sherwood's life, which is\r\nintended soon for publication. The editions of Mrs. Sherwood's writings\r\nhave been numerous. The best is that of the Harpers, in ten or twelve\r\nvolumes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRev. JAMES H. HOTCHKISS, died at Prattsburgh, Steuben county, New-York, on\r\nSeptember 2d, aged seventy years. He was the author of a _History of the\r\nChurches in Western New-York_, published in a large octavo volume, about\r\ntwo years ago, and had just preached his half-century sermon. He was the\r\nson of Rev. Beriah Hotchkiss, the pioneer missionary of large sections of\r\nthe State of New-York. The son graduated at Williams College, 1800; studied\r\ntheology with Dr. Porter, of Catskill, was ordained by an Association,\r\ninstalled at East Bloomfield in 1802, removed to Prattsburgh in 1809, and\r\nthere labored twenty-one years. The _Genesee Evangelist_ gives the\r\nfollowing sketch of his character:\r\n\r\n\"He had a mind of a strong, masculine order, well disciplined by various\r\nreading, and remarkably stored with general knowledge. The doctrinal views\r\nof the good old orthodox New England stamp, which he imbibed at first, he\r\nmaintained strenuously to the last; and left a distinct impression of them\r\nwherever he had an opportunity to inculcate them. His labors, through the\r\nhalf-century, were 'abundant,' and indefatigable; and to him, more than to\r\nany other one man probably, is the Genesee country indebted for its present\r\nliterary, moral and religious character. Under his ministry there were many\r\nreligious revivals, and some signal ones, especially in Prattsburgh. The\r\nyears 1819 and 1825 were eminently signalized in this way. He had the\r\nhappiness of closing his life in the scenes of his greatest usefulness.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBRIGADIER-GENERAL HENRY WHITING, of the Quartermaster's Department, died at\r\nSt Louis, Mo., on the 16th of September. He arrived at St Louis, as we\r\nlearn from the _Republican_ of the 17th, on Sunday, the 14th, from a tour\r\nof official duty in Texas, being in his usual health. On Tuesday afternoon,\r\nwhile in his room at the Planter's House, he was, without any premonition\r\nwhatever, stricken dead instantaneously. The cause of his death, in all\r\nprobability, was an affection of the heart. His remains were taken to\r\nJefferson Barracks on the 17th, for interment.\r\n\r\nGen. Whiting, who was among the oldest officers of the army, was a native\r\nof Lancaster, in Massachusetts, a son of Gen. John Whiting, also a native\r\nof that place. He was not only an accomplished officer in the department in\r\nwhich he has spent a large portion of his life, but he made extensive\r\nscientific and literary attainments, and was a gentleman of great private\r\nworth. In hours stolen from official duties, he was for many years a large\r\ncontributor to the literature of the country. His articles which from time\r\nto time appeared in the _North-American Review_, were of an eminently\r\npractical and useful character, and highly creditable to his scholarship\r\nand sound judgment. The biographical sketch of the late President Taylor,\r\nin a recent number, confined chiefly to his military life, and embracing a\r\ngraphic description of the extraordinary successes in Mexico, was from Gen.\r\nWhiting's pen. He published a few years ago an important collection of the\r\n_General Orders of Washington_. He was deserving of praise also as a poet\r\nand as a dramatic author.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOMMODORE LEWIS WARRINGTON, of the United States navy, died in Washington,\r\non the 12th October, after a painful illness. He was a native of Virginia,\r\nand was born in November, 1782. From a sketch of his life in the _Herald_,\r\nit appears that he entered the navy on the 6th of January, 1800, and soon\r\nafter joined the frigate Chesapeake, then lying at Norfolk. In this ship he\r\nremained on the West India station until May, 1801, when he returned to the\r\nUnited States and joined the frigate President, under Commodore Dale, and\r\nsoon blockaded Tripoli until 1802, when he again returned to the United\r\nStates, and joined the frigate New-York, which sailed, and remained on the\r\nMediterranean station until 1803. On his return from the Mediterranean he\r\nwas ordered to the Vixen, and again joined the squadron which had lately\r\nleft, where he remained during the attack on the gun-boats and batteries of\r\nTripoli, in which the Vixen always took part. In November, 1804, he was\r\nmade acting lieutenant; and in July, 1805, he joined the brig Siren, a\r\njunior lieutenant. In March, 1806, he joined the Enterprise, as first\r\nlieutenant, and did not return to the United States until July, 1807--an\r\nabsence of four years. After his return in 1807 he was ordered to the\r\ncommand of a gun-boat on the Norfolk station, then under the command of\r\nCommodore Decatur. This was a position calculated to damp the ardor of the\r\nyoung officer, as it was so far below several he had filled. He, however,\r\nmaintained his usual bearing for two years, when he was again ordered to\r\nthe Siren as first lieutenant. On the return of this vessel from Europe,\r\nwhither she went with dispatches, Lieut. Warrington was ordered to the\r\nEssex, as her first lieutenant, in September of the same year. In the Essex\r\nhe cruised on the American coast, and again carried out dispatches for the\r\ngovernment, returning in 1812. He was then ordered to the frigate Congress\r\nas her first lieutenant, and sailed, on the declaration of war, with the\r\nsquadron under Commodore Rodgers, to intercept the British West India\r\nfleet, which was only avoided by the latter in consequence of a heavy fog,\r\nwhich continued for fourteen days. He remained in the Congress until 1813,\r\nwhen he became first lieutenant of the frigate United States, in which he\r\nremained until his promotion to the rank of master commandant, soon after\r\nwhich he took command of the sloop-of-war Peacock. While cruising in the\r\nPeacock, in latitude 27 deg. 40 min., he encountered the British\r\nbrig-of-war Epervier. His own letter to the Secretary of the Navy,\r\ndescriptive of that encounter, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                              At Sea, April 29, 1814.\r\n\r\n     SIR:--I have the honor to inform you that we have this\r\n     morning captured, after an action of forty-two minutes,\r\n     his Britannic Majesty's brig Epervier, rating and\r\n     mounting eighteen thirty-two pound cannonades, with one\r\n     hundred and twenty-eight men, of whom eleven were\r\n     killed and fifteen wounded, according to the best\r\n     information we could obtain. Among the latter is her\r\n     first lieutenant, who has lost an arm, and received a\r\n     severe splinter wound in the hip. Not a man in the\r\n     Peacock was killed, and only two wounded, neither\r\n     dangerously. The fate of the Epervier would have been\r\n     decided in much less time, but for the circumstance of\r\n     our foreyard having been totally disabled by two\r\n     round-shot in the starboard quarter, from her first\r\n     broadside, which entirely deprived us of the use of our\r\n     fore-topsails, and compelled us to keep the ship large\r\n     throughout the remainder of the action. This, with a\r\n     few topmast and topgallant backstays cut away, and a\r\n     few shot through our sails, is the only injury the\r\n     Peacock has sustained. Not a round-shot touched our\r\n     hull, and our masts and spars are as sound as ever.\r\n     When the enemy struck he had five feet of water in his\r\n     hold; his maintopmast was over the side; his mainboom\r\n     shot away; his foremast cut nearly away, and tottering;\r\n     his forerigging and stays shot away; his bowsprit badly\r\n     wounded, and forty-five shot-holes in his hull, twenty\r\n     of which were within a foot of his water-line, above\r\n     and below. By great exertions we got her in sailing\r\n     order just as night came on. In fifteen minutes after\r\n     the enemy struck, the Peacock was ready for another\r\n     action, in every respect, except the foreyard, which\r\n     was sent down, fished, and we had the foresail set\r\n     again in forty-five minutes--such was the spirit and\r\n     activity of our gallant crew. The Epervier had under\r\n     convoy an English hermaphrodite brig, a Russian, and a\r\n     Spanish ship, which all hauled their wind, and stood to\r\n     the E. N. E. I had determined upon pursuing the former,\r\n     but found that it would not be prudent to leave our\r\n     prize in her then crippled state, and the more\r\n     particularly so as we found she had on board one\r\n     hundred and twenty thousand dollars in specie. Every\r\n     officer, seaman, and marine did his duty, which is the\r\n     highest compliment I can pay them.\r\n\r\n                              I am, &c.,\r\n                              L. WARRINGTON.\r\n\r\nCapt. Warrington brought his prize safely home, and was received with great\r\nhonor, because of his success in the encounter. In the early part of the\r\nyear 1815, he sailed in the squadron under Commodore Decatur, for a cruise\r\nin the Indian Ocean. The Peacock and Hornet were obliged to separate in\r\nchasing, and did not again meet until they arrived at Tristan d'Acunha, the\r\nplace appointed for rendezvous. After leaving that place, the Peacock met\r\nwith a British line-of-battle ship, from which she escaped, and gained the\r\nStraits of Sunda, where she captured four vessels, one of which was a brig\r\nof fourteen guns, belonging to the East India Company's service. From this\r\nvessel Captain Warrington first heard of the ratification of peace. He then\r\nreturned to the United States. While in command of the Peacock, Capt.\r\nWarrington captured nineteen vessels, three of which were given up to\r\nprisoners, and sixteen destroyed.\r\n\r\nSince the close of the war, Commodore Warrington has filled many\r\nresponsible stations in the service for a long time, having been on\r\nshore-duty for twenty-eight years. He was appointed one of the Board of\r\nNaval Commissioners, and subsequently held the post of chief of the Bureau\r\nof Ordnance in the Navy Department, which post he held at the time of his\r\ndeath. His whole career of service extended through a period of more than\r\nfifty-one years, during all of which time he was respected, and held as one\r\nof the most prominent officers of the United States navy. At the time of\r\nhis death there was but one older officer in service.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJOHN KIDD, M.D., of the University of Oxford, died suddenly early in\r\nSeptember. He was formerly Professor of Chemistry, and since 1822 Regius\r\nProfessor of Medicine. Dr. Kidd did good service in his time, as his\r\npublications testify, in various departments of mineralogical, chemical,\r\nand geological research, and about ten years ago he put forth some\r\nobservations on medical reform. Dr. Kidd was one of the eminent men\r\nselected under the Earl of Bridgewater's will to write one of the\r\nwell-known \"Bridgewater Treatises.\" The subject was, _On the Adaptation of\r\nExternal Nature to the Physical Condition of Man_. Together with the Regius\r\nProfessorship of Medicine, to which the mastership of Ewelme Hospital, in\r\nthe county of Oxford, is attached, Dr. Kidd held the office of librarian to\r\nthe Radcliffe Library.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE EARL OF DONOUGHMORE died on the 12th of September, at Palmerstown\r\nHouse, county of Dublin, in the sixty-fourth year of his age. He was\r\nlord-lieutenant of the county of Tipperary, and had a seat in the House of\r\nLords as a British peer with the title of Viscount Hutchinson, of\r\nKnocklofty, but will be better remembered in history as the gallant Colonel\r\nHutchinson, who was one of the parties implicated in the celebrated escape\r\nof Lavalette, in the year 1815, shortly after the restoration of the\r\nBourbons. He is succeeded in his extensive estates in the south of Ireland\r\nby Viscount Suirdale, his lordship's son by his first wife, the daughter of\r\nthe Lord Mountjoy, who lost his life in the royal service during the Irish\r\nrebellion of 1798.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM NICOL, F.R.S.E., died in Edinburgh on the 2nd of September, in his\r\neighty-third year. Mr. Nicol commenced his career as assistant to the late\r\nDr. Moyes, the eminent blind lecturer on natural philosophy. Dr. Moyes, at\r\nhis death, bequeathed his apparatus to Mr. Nicol, who then lectured on the\r\nsame subject. His contributions to the _Edinburgh Philosophical Journal_\r\nwere various and valuable; the more important being his description of his\r\nsuccessful repetition of Doebereiner's celebrated experiment of igniting\r\nspongy platina by a stream of cold hydrogen gas; and his method of\r\npreparing fossil woods for microscopic investigation, which led to his\r\ndiscovery of the structural difference between the arucarian and coniferous\r\nwoods, by far the most important in fossil botany. But the most valuable\r\ncontribution to physical science, with which his name will ever be\r\nassociated, was his invention of the single image prism of calcareous spar,\r\nknown to the scientific world as Nicol's prism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. G. G. FREEMAN, the well-known English missionary, died on the 8th\r\nof September at the baths of Homburg, in Germany, of an attack of rheumatic\r\nfever. Mr. Freeman had only a little while before returned home from a\r\nvisit to the mission stations in South Africa, and his latest important\r\nlabor was the writing of a volume, in which the social, spiritual, and\r\npolitical condition of South Africa was depicted. Mr. Freeman was\r\nfifty-seven years of age. He was born in London, educated at Hoxton\r\nAcademy, and after many years of successful devotion to his profession in\r\nEngland, he proceeded in 1827 to Madagascar, under the direction of the\r\nLondon Missionary Society, and for nine years labored there with eminent\r\nenergy and success. The share he had in translating the Scriptures, in\r\npreparing school-books, and in superintending the mission schools, cannot\r\nbe recited in this brief sketch, but was such as greatly facilitated the\r\nprogress of the Christian religion, till, in 1835, the queen proscribed\r\nChristianity, and virtually expelled the missionaries from the island. Mr.\r\nFreeman then went to the Cape of Good Hope, where he became much interested\r\nin South African missions, but the ill health of his wife compelled his\r\nreturn to England, where he arrived about the end of 1836. New duties and\r\nlabors now awaited him; he had to confer with the directors, and to visit\r\nthe constituents of the London Missionary Society in all parts of the\r\nkingdom. The want of an Institution for the education of the daughters of\r\nmissionaries having been strongly felt, he took a leading part in the\r\nestablishment of a school for that purpose in the village of Walthamstow,\r\nwhere he had become connected with the congregational church. In 1841, the\r\nloss of health having obliged the Rev. William Ellis to relinquish his\r\nofficial connection with the London Missionary Society, he was appointed\r\nforeign secretary, and appeared at the annual meeting of that year in that\r\ncapacity, and shared with Dr. Tidman the labor of reading the report. How\r\nfaithfully he fulfilled the duties of that office at home, and at what risk\r\nof health and life he sought, in a late voyage to the Mauritius, and\r\njourney throughout Southern Africa, to inform himself and the Society of\r\nthe true state of affairs, both in Madagascar and Caffraria, his\r\npublications will show.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJAMES RICHARDSON, the enterprising African traveller, died on the 4th of\r\nMarch last, at a small village called Ungurutua, six days distant from\r\nKouka, the capital of Bornou. Early in January, he and the companions of\r\nhis mission, Drs. Barth and Overweg, arrived at the immense plain of\r\nDamergou, when, after remaining a few days, they separated, Dr. Barth\r\nproceeding to Kanu, Dr. Overweg to Guber, and Mr. Richardson taking the\r\ndirect route to Kouka, by Zinde. There it would seem his strength began to\r\ngive way, and before he had arrived twelve days' distance from Kouka, he\r\nbecame seriously ill, suffering much from the oppressive heat of the sun.\r\nHaving reached a large town called Kangarras, he halted three days, and\r\nfeeling himself refreshed he renewed his journey. After two days, during\r\nwhich his weakness greatly increased, he arrived at the Waddy Mallaha.\r\nLeaving this place on the 3d of March, he reached in two hours the village\r\nof Ungurutua, when he became so weak that he was unable to proceed. In the\r\nevening he took a little food and tried to sleep--but became very restless,\r\nand left his tent supported by his servant. He then took some tea and threw\r\nhimself again on his bed, but did not sleep. His attendants having made\r\nsome coffee, he asked for a cup, but had no strength to hold it. He\r\nrepeated several times, \"I have no strength;\" and after having pronounced\r\nthe name of his wife, sighed deeply, and expired without a struggle about\r\ntwo hours after midnight. Early in the morning, the body wrapped in linen,\r\nand covered with a carpet, was borne to a grave four feet deep, under the\r\nshade of a large tree, close to the village, followed by all the principal\r\nSheichs and people of the district.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose who have read--and very few persons of middle age in this country\r\nhave not read--the interesting and somewhat apocryphal narrative of Captain\r\nRiley's shipwreck on the coast of Africa and long experience of suffering\r\nas a slave among the Arabs, will remember the amiable British Consul of\r\nMogadore, in Barbary, Mr. WILLIAM WILLSHIRE. While Capt. Riley, Mr.\r\nRobbins, and others of the crew of the \"Commerce\" (which was the name of\r\nthe American ship that was wrecked), were in the midst of the great desert,\r\nin utter helplessness, Mr. Willshire heard of some of them, and came to\r\ntheir relief with money and provisions, and paid, himself, the price of\r\ntheir ransom, redeeming them from an otherwise perpetual captivity. He took\r\nthe afflicted and worn-out Americans to his own house at Mogadore, made\r\nthem, after long suffering and privation, enjoy the luxuries of a bed and\r\nthe comforts of a home, his wife and daughters uniting with him to\r\nalleviate their sufferings, and he afterwards supplied them with the\r\nnecessary money and provided them the means of a return to their own\r\ncountry. Riley, in the latter part of his life, settled in Ohio, where the\r\nname of _Willshire_ has been given to the town in which he lived, and we\r\nbelieve our government made some demonstration of the general feeling of\r\ngratefulness with which the American people regarded Mr. Willshire's noble\r\nconduct in this case. Mr. Willshire was a model for consuls, and was kept\r\nconstantly in service by his government. Several years ago he was appointed\r\nto Adrianople, where he died suddenly, at an advanced age, on the 4th of\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nThe Paris papers announce the death at the age of seventy-six, of M. J. R.\r\nDUBOIS,--director successively of the _Gaite_, the _Porte-Saint-Martin_,\r\nand the _Opera_, under the Restoration,--and author of a great variety of\r\npieces played in the different theatres of Paris thirty or forty years ago.\r\n\r\nGUSTAV CARLIN, the author of several historical essays, and a novel founded\r\non Mexican legends, died in Berlin on the 15th of September, aged\r\nsixty-nine. He resided several years in New-York, we believe as a political\r\ncorrespondent of some German newspaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLadies' Autumn Fashions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe light dresses of the summer, with unimportant apparent changes, were\r\nretained this year later than usual, but at length the more sober colors\r\nand heavier material of the autumn have taken their places. There are\r\nindications that furs will be much worn this season, and there are a\r\nvariety of new patterns. We select--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI. _The Palatine Royale in Ermine_, for illustration and description. The\r\npalatine royale is a fur victorine of novel form, and it may fairly claim\r\nprecedence as being the first article of winter costume prepared in\r\nanticipation of the approaching change of season. The addition of a hood,\r\nwhich is lined with quilted silk, and bound with a band of ermine, not only\r\nadds to its warmth, but renders it exceedingly convenient for the opera and\r\ntheatres. This hood, we may mention, can be fixed on and removed at\r\npleasure; an obvious advantage, which no lady will fail to appreciate. To\r\nthe lower part of the hood is attached a large white silk tassel. We must\r\ndirect particular attention to the new fastening attached to the palatine\r\nroyale. This fastening is formed of an India-rubber band and steel clasp,\r\nby means of which the palatine will fit comfortably to the throat of any\r\nlady. The band and clasp being in the inside are not visible, and on the\r\noutside there is an elegant fancy ornament of white silk, of the\r\ndescription which the French call a brandebourg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nII. _A Palatine in Sable_, has the same form and make as that just\r\ndescribed, except that our engraving shows the back of one made of sable\r\ninstead of ermine. The hood is lined with brown sable-colored silk, and the\r\ntassel and brandebourg are of silk of the same color. We need scarcely\r\nmention that the color employed for lining the hood, and for the silk\r\nornaments, is wholly optional, and may be determined by the taste of the\r\nwearer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first figure in the above engraving, displays a very handsome _Walking\r\nDress_. It is of steel-color _poult de soie_, trimmed in a very novel and\r\nelegant style with bouillonnees of ribbon. The ribbon employed for these\r\nbouillonnees is steel color, figured and edged with lilac. The\r\nbouillonnees, which are disposed as side-trimmings on the skirt of the\r\ndress, are set on in rows obliquely, and graduated in length, the lowest\r\nnow being about a quarter of a yard long. The corsage is a pardessus of the\r\nsame material as the dress; the basque slit up at each side, and the\r\npardessus edged all round with ribbon bouillonnee. The sleeves are\r\ndemi-long, and loose at the ends, and slit up on the outside of the arm.\r\nLoose under-sleeves of muslin, edged with a double frill of needlework. The\r\npardessus has under-fronts of white cambric or coutil, thus presenting\r\nprecisely the effect of a gentleman's waistcoat. This gilet corsage, as it\r\nis termed by the French dressmakers, has recently been gaining rapid favor\r\namong the Parisian belles. That which our illustration represents has a row\r\nof buttons up the front, and a pocket at each side. It is open at the upper\r\npart, showing a chemisette of lace. Bonnet of fancy straw and crinoline in\r\nalternate rows, lined with drawn white silk, and trimmed with white ribbon.\r\nOn one side, a white knotted feather. Undertrimming, bouquets of white and\r\nlilac flowers, mixed with white tulle. Over this dress may be worn a rich\r\nIndia cashmere shawl.\r\n\r\nIn the second figure we have an example of the heavy and large plaided\r\nsilks, and generally our latest Parisian plates, like this, exhibit the use\r\nof deep fringes. Flounces of ribbon are in vogue to a degree, but are not\r\nlikely to be much worn.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen by the first figure on this page that the European ladies\r\nare approximating to the styles of gentlemen in the upper parts of their\r\ncostume, as American women seem disposed to imitation in the matter of\r\ninexpressibles.
