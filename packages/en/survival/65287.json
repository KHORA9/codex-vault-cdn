Old methods of making tomato pulp,\r\ncatsup, chili sauce, etc. have been discarded, and the modern plant\r\npresents a very striking contrast to the plant of former days.\r\n\r\nIn this book I have tried to present all the methods used which have\r\nmerit, and to bring forth the advantages and disadvantages of each so\r\nthat the packer can weigh them and decide which is best to use under the\r\nconditions which obtain at his plant. In some cases one method is\r\nuniversally applicable and has advantages which stamp it as superior,\r\nbut more often varying conditions of manufacture in different localities\r\nmake it impossible to recommend any one method for everyone.\r\n\r\nIn writing the text I have had to rely almost entirely on the experience\r\ngained during the seven years in which I have been engaged in the\r\nmanufacture of these products, as there are no books on the subject, and\r\nno sources of reference except the bulletins prepared by Mr. B. J.\r\nHoward and Mr. C. H. Stephenson of the Bureau of Chemistry, U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, on the sorting and washing of tomatoes, the\r\nhandling of tomato trimmings, and the effect of proper and improper\r\nsorting and washing on the content of micro-organisms as determined by\r\nmicroscopical examination.\r\n\r\nI wish to thank Mr. B. J. Howard of the Bureau of Chemistry for the\r\nvaluable suggestions and information he gave me with reference to\r\nportions of the text of Chapter II and Chapter VII, and also to thank\r\nthe Bureau of Chemistry for permission to use many of their\r\nphotomicrographs and photographs.\r\n\r\n                                                             W.

Every experienced manufacturer\r\nknows that regardless of the expertness with which he may work up his\r\ntomatoes into the finished product, he cannot expect to get good quality\r\nunless he has good stock to begin with. It is true that by using\r\nintelligence and extreme care in the manufacturing processes one\r\nmanufacturer will make better pulp or catsup from tomatoes of fair\r\nquality than another man can get from the best quality of stock. This\r\nsame care and intelligence applied, however, in working up high quality\r\ntomatoes will probably show a greater difference in the finished\r\nproducts than was apparent in the tomatoes from which these products\r\nwere made; in other words, the goodness of good tomatoes becomes\r\naccentuated by the manufacturing process.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure as large a proportion as possible of good quality\r\nstock, as well as a good yield per acre in tonnage, manufacturers are\r\neach year realizing the necessity of closer co-operation with the\r\nfarmer. Where in growing tomatoes under contract it was formerly largely\r\nup to the farmer to buy his seed and raise his plants and set them out,\r\nit is now the usual custom to supply the farmer with seed of the desired\r\nvariety and of high germination test, and in many cases to go a step\r\nfarther and supply him with plants six to eight inches high, ready for\r\nsetting out in the field. Unquestionably, the best results are secured\r\nby growing the plants for the farmer. The average farmer does not go\r\nabout the raising of his plants in an intelligent way, and he will not\r\ndevote the time to the plant-raising business that it should have.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Plant Raising\r\n\r\nMost packers are agreed that the best plant is raised by starting the\r\nseeds in rows in hot beds, transplanting to cold frames when they are\r\ntwo to four inches high to harden them and make them stocky, and again\r\ntransplanting to the field when the plants are six to eight inches high.\r\nThis method produces a dark green, bushy, thick-stemmed plant of high\r\nvitality, which is so essential to a good yield. What a contrast to the\r\naverage plant raised by the farmer—the seed often broadcasted, either in\r\na hot bed or in a spot in the garden where the soil has not been\r\nspecially prepared for plant raising, and when the plants, a large\r\nnumber of which are thin, pale green, and spindly looking, attain a\r\nheight of anywhere from six inches to a foot they are all set out in the\r\nfield and allowed to struggle along as best they can. When one looks at\r\nthe kind of plants that are so often set out he can see at least one\r\nreason why yields of from three to seven tons per acre are so often\r\nobtained from ground which should yield twice that much, and why the\r\nplants are easy victims to blight and other diseases.\r\n\r\nA prominent canner recently told me that by raising the plants for his\r\nfarmers he had increased the average yield 4 tons per acre.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Use of Fertilizer\r\n\r\nSo many articles have been written on tomato culture for canning plants\r\nby experienced horticulturists that the subject will not be dealt with\r\nextensively here. In these articles emphasis is usually laid on the\r\ndesirability of the use of commercial fertilizer, not only to increase\r\nthe yield, but to hasten the maturing of the crop so that a large\r\nproportion of it can be harvested before frost.\r\n\r\nMy experience testifies to the wisdom of this in practically all cases,\r\nand with late maturing varieties such as the Stone tomato, in regions\r\nsubject to early frost, and especially where planted on low ground, it\r\nis absolutely essential that fertilizer be used if a good percentage of\r\nthe crop is to be harvested.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Methods in East and West\r\n\r\nIn the Tri-States—that is, Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey—quite a\r\ndifferent situation exists from that in the middle west or far west. The\r\nwestern packer has practically all of his tomatoes grown under contract,\r\nwhile the Tri-State packer, although he tries to contract as much\r\nacreage or tonnage as possible at a reasonable figure, is up against the\r\ncompetitive buying of the open market for a large proportion of his raw\r\nstock, as there are always a large number of farmers who are willing to\r\ngamble that the coming season will be a good one for playing the open\r\nmarket. In this case the buyer usually cannot be as particular about the\r\nquality of the tomatoes he buys as can the packer who has his tomatoes\r\nall grown under contract at a specified price, and who can exercise\r\nsupervision over his farmers. This is particularly true in seasons of\r\nshort crop, when the grower sells his tomatoes on the market and can\r\nafford to be very independent, and buyers are wildly forcing up the\r\nprice by competitive bidding, and taking whatever they can get. Even if\r\nthe eastern grower is under contract for his entire crop, if the crop is\r\nshort, and high prices are prevailing on the market, it is the\r\nexceptional grower who will live up to his contract, and often to get an\r\nexcuse for breaking his contract he will deliver very poor tomatoes\r\nright along in the hope that they will be objected to, thus giving him\r\nthe liberty of disposing of them elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe eastern packer, however, is blessed with a longer season in which to\r\noperate. While in the west there are seldom enough tomatoes to justify a\r\nrun at the factory before August 15th, the Tri-States packer starts in\r\non the early crop about the 25th of July, and his crop is not as liable\r\nto be severely injured by an early frost as is the western crop.\r\n\r\nCanning and preserving plants in the west, being scattered rather\r\nsparsely over a very large territory, and being farther away from the\r\nlarge centers of population than in the east, the western packer is able\r\nto get a large percentage of his tomatoes hauled to the factory by\r\nwagon. This is indeed a big advantage, not only in the saving of freight\r\nand handling expense, but in the condition of the fruit when delivered\r\nto the factory. Probably having been picked not more than twenty-four\r\nhours before delivery, the wagon-hauled tomatoes are solid, and because\r\nthe skin is not broken by repeated handling, thus preventing the growth\r\nof molds, they require very little sorting, in fact, no sorting at all\r\nin some cases. A load of tomatoes which requires no sorting at all,\r\nhowever, is unusual. If the packer can get his growers to use spring\r\nwagons for hauling tomatoes, it is a big advantage, especially if the\r\nfruit must be held any length of time at the factory. If the\r\nwagon-hauled tomatoes can be worked up quickly the packer gets 100 per\r\ncent value for them, which he very seldom does get on shipped tomatoes,\r\nwhich commonly undergo a loss of between 5 and 20 per cent in shipment,\r\ndepending upon the time involved in shipment, the ripeness of the fruit,\r\nthe amount of handling it received, the condition of the weather, the\r\nkind of crate in which the fruit is packed, and the amount of\r\nventilation it received in transit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Shipping Tomatoes\r\n\r\nShipment by water, although slow, has the advantage of smoothness of\r\ntransit, and the crates or baskets of tomatoes are not subjected to the\r\nfrequent joltings of rail shipments, and it is to be remembered that\r\nevery jolt makes the tomatoes settle to a certain extent in the crates\r\nand mashes the tomatoes in the bottom layers. The best car for rail\r\nshipments is the slatted car or stock car, which permits of better\r\ncirculation than any of the other types. A box car should never be used,\r\nas it allows the fruit to heat very badly, and there is no circulation\r\nof air. The crates in the slatted cars should be so stacked as to allow\r\nas much circulation of air through the car as possible. However, care\r\nmust be taken that the crates are so stacked that they will not shift. A\r\nsmall air space can always be left at the end of every other row on each\r\nside without endangering the stability of the crates, and a large air\r\nspace can be left at the top.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Tomato Crates\r\n\r\nOne advantage in the use of the basket over the crate in shipments is\r\nthe advantage of better circulation of air through the piled baskets of\r\nfruit, due to the conical shape of the basket. Good ventilation is thus\r\nsupplied without danger of the baskets shifting during shipment. The\r\n⅝-bushel basket is used almost universally in the east, while in the\r\nwest the crate holding a bushel is the common container. The\r\nconstruction of the crate is a more important item than is often\r\nthought. The most important point, of course, is strength in\r\nconstruction, and the use of a wood which will not warp easily by\r\nalternate soaking and drying out, allowing the nails to become loose and\r\nthe bottoms to begin to fall out of the crates after a half season’s\r\nuse. The slats of the crates should have rounded, smooth edges so as not\r\nto cut the surface of the tomatoes when they are jolted and weighted\r\ndown during shipment. The slats should be only close enough together to\r\nhold the small tomatoes, so as to permit of as much air circulation as\r\npossible. This particularly applies to the bottom of the crates, which\r\nbecome soggy and musty after a little use, and the openings soon become\r\nclogged up with tomato substance. It is important to turn a steam hose\r\nover the bottoms of such crates to clean them out before returning to\r\nthe point of shipment. If the empty crates pass along on a chain belt\r\nafter dumping, this steaming can be accomplished easily. Accumulated\r\ndecaying tomato substance in the bottom slats not only rots out the\r\ncrates, but contaminates otherwise good tomatoes every time the crate is\r\nused. The crate should also be as shallow as will permit of easy\r\nhandling, so as to distribute the weight of the tomatoes over as much\r\nsurface as possible. A shallow, broad crate is preferable to a deep,\r\nnarrow one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Degrees of Ripeness for Shipping\r\n\r\nThe proper degree of ripeness for tomatoes to be shipped depends, of\r\ncourse, upon the length of time it will take for them to arrive at their\r\ndestination. Dead-ripe tomatoes will stand very little handling and\r\nshipping, particularly if the weather is warm and damp, as it so\r\nfrequently is during tomato season. It is important, too, not to have\r\nthe tomatoes delivered to the shipping station too underripe, as they\r\nare very apt to rot before they become red enough to cook up into a\r\nproduct of good color. That the employee in charge of receiving tomatoes\r\nat the shipping point should be a man of experience and good judgment as\r\nwell as tact in dealing with the farmers, is apparent. So much depends\r\nupon the control he exercises over the farmers in getting them to pick\r\ntheir fruit at the proper degree of ripeness. If he falters, is\r\nuncertain, and changes his mind a few times, he is lost, as the farmers\r\nsoon lose confidence in his judgment.\r\n\r\nIt is always difficult to impress upon the farmer the fact that tomatoes\r\ngain in weight during the ripening process, and the riper they have\r\ntheir tomatoes the more they get in dollars when they drive up on the\r\nscales. This argument cannot be advanced when the tomatoes are bought by\r\nthe basket, as they are in the east, but when paid for according to\r\nweight and not volume, the ripeness of his tomatoes is an important\r\npoint for the farmer to watch. At the tail end of the season when frosts\r\nare threatening, this argument of the increased weight of tomatoes which\r\nare red ripe all over of course loses its effect entirely. All the\r\nfarmer is interested in at that time is in getting as many of his\r\ntomatoes as possible accepted before a heavy frost finishes them. At\r\nthis time increased vigilance at the receiving end is necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Careful Handling at Factory\r\n\r\nThe less handling crates or baskets of tomatoes receive, the better.\r\nEvery packer wants to eliminate handling as much as possible to conserve\r\nlabor, but when one sees the laborers around the average plant heaving\r\ncrates of tomatoes around as though they were pig iron, he wonders if\r\nthe manager fully realizes the effect of this bouncing of heavy crates\r\nof tomatoes on to trucks, receiving platforms, etc. It is just as easy,\r\nor almost as easy, to set the crates down gently, but the laborers who\r\ndo this work must be constantly reminded of it. You do get tired of\r\nconstantly hammering at them, but it is surely worth the effort. A\r\ncommon attitude for the men to take is that the tomatoes are all going\r\nto get mashed up anyway pretty soon, so what’s the difference. When you\r\nconsider the fact that crates of tomatoes are commonly handled from six\r\nto eight times before they reach the sorting belt, this handling often\r\nconsisting of dropping the crates down so hard that the top tomatoes\r\nalmost bounce out, it is no wonder that when they are spread out on the\r\nsorting belt the bottom layer of each crate is mashed and moldy, so that\r\nhalf of these bottom tomatoes have to be thrown away.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Varieties\r\n\r\nAny of the brilliant red varieties of tomatoes are suitable for catsup\r\nor pulp making. Those varieties having a purplish cast should be\r\navoided, as they cook up into a product having a brownish color. The\r\nsmooth, round varieties, such as the Stone, are especially good for\r\npeeling, while the flat varieties, and those having a very coarse,\r\nuneven surface, are well suited for pulp or catsup.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Storing Tomatoes\r\n\r\nFor storing the tomatoes at the factory until they can be put over the\r\nsorting belts the open-air storage is used almost universally, and it\r\nseems to be the only method which can be economically employed at a\r\nplant which handles large quantities of tomatoes. I have seen the wet\r\nstorage method in use at a small plant where the receipts only amount to\r\na few hundred bushels a day on good days, and less than a hundred on\r\nmany days when the weather is very bad, and it was liked very much by\r\nthe plant manager. The tomatoes, as soon as received, were dumped into a\r\nlarge concrete tank of cold water, which was kept fairly fresh by\r\nletting fresh water run into it constantly, with an overflow at the\r\nother side of the tank, and a large revolving paddle at one side of the\r\ntank kept the water in motion. Attached to this paddle was a series of\r\nflights on an endless chain, which, when thrown into gear, carried the\r\ntomatoes to the sorting belt.\r\n\r\nThe argument advanced in favor of the wet storage method by the operator\r\nof this plant was that at certain times in the season their receipts of\r\ntomatoes were very small, that is, at the beginning and at the close of\r\nthe season, and during stretches of cold, rainy weather, and at such\r\ntimes they only made a run every other day, or possibly only twice a\r\nweek, and that the tomatoes kept much better in wet storage.\r\n\r\nThe tomatoes were clean when delivered to the sorting belt, and although\r\nthey received very little sorting, and only one spraying after they left\r\nthe storage tank, the count of molds, yeasts and spores and bacteria on\r\ntheir pulp was fairly low.\r\n\r\nThe wet storage method could undoubtedly be used at large plants, and\r\nmight prove profitable during periods of glut, as there is no doubt but\r\nwhat tomatoes will keep better in wet storage than in the open air. It\r\nwould take a lot of tanks for a large plant, however, and large\r\noperators are not inclined to look favorably on the idea.\r\n\r\nIn open-air storage the crates of tomatoes should be stacked so as to\r\nleave an air space between each crate, and if stacked inside of a\r\nbuilding, all the windows and doors should be thrown open to allow as\r\nfree a circulation of air as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Stemless Tomatoes\r\n\r\nMost tomatoes are delivered to the factory with the stems on, but I know\r\nof one plant where they are all received stemless, and the quality of\r\nthe pulp made from them simply cannot be beat. There surely must be an\r\nundesirable taste imparted by all these green stems in the cooking\r\nprocess. Of course, where the cold pulping process is used, that is, the\r\ntomatoes pulped cold directly after sorting and washing, these stems are\r\neliminated before any cooking is done. In the hot pulping process,\r\nhowever, and when the tomatoes are put in a crusher instead of a pulp\r\nmachine, the stems are cooked along with the rest of the pulp. The\r\noperator of the plant referred to above pays a bonus of a dollar a ton\r\nto his contractors for having the tomatoes delivered stemless, and he\r\nbelieves he gets that dollar back and more, too, in the price he gets\r\nfor his product, which is very fancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                          WASHING AND SORTING\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Washing and Sorting Equipment\r\n\r\nA great many outfits for washing and sorting tomatoes have been placed\r\non the market, some of which have many good points, and others are very\r\ninadequate. The type of washer best adapted to one plant may not be the\r\nbest for another one. If tomatoes are grown on clay ground a friction\r\nwasher is necessary, while for fruits grown on sandy soil it is very\r\ninfrequent that much friction is needed to properly clean the tomatoes.\r\n\r\nAs to sorting belts, as a rule one type will serve as well in one place\r\nas in another. A majority of the sorting belts used are subject to many\r\ncriticisms; some are too narrow, some too short, some travel at a speed\r\nof 100 feet or more per minute, while others move as slowly as 10 feet\r\nper minute. The latter speed is much better than the former, although\r\nboth are extremes, 25 feet per minute being about right.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Rotary Washer\r\n\r\nFor tomatoes grown on clay ground the cylindrical rotary washer or\r\nsquirrel cage type made of 1–inch mesh heavy wire is very satisfactory.\r\nWhen tomatoes come to the plant caked with clay, as they are after a\r\nhard rain followed by strong sunshine, a friction washer of this type is\r\nabout the only thing that will clean them. This type of washer also does\r\nexcellent work on late tomatoes, and this applies to all localities. A\r\nlarge percentage of late tomatoes become deeply cracked at the stem end,\r\nand although these cracks, or fissures, usually appear to be healed\r\nover, an examination will generally reveal the presence of mold in them,\r\nand in many cases large tufts of mold like cotton completely filling\r\nthem. By merely passing such tomatoes through a water bath, even though\r\nthe water is thoroughly agitated by means of many inlets of compressed\r\nair, this imbedded mold will be scarcely affected. A rotary, heavy wire,\r\nreel washer, inclined at an angle of about 1 foot in 8, and rotating\r\nslowly, with a heavy, sharp spray of water striking the rolling tomatoes\r\nfrom the time they are dumped in until they roll out, will take out a\r\nvery large proportion of this mold, besides cleaning the entire surface\r\nof the tomato thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe washer should deliver about two bushels of tomatoes per minute to\r\nthe sorting belt. As the wire cylinder revolves, the tomatoes are\r\ncarried half way up the side and are then thrown back again, being\r\ncarried slowly and steadily toward the outlet. A 1½-inch pipe at the top\r\nof the cylinder, and running from end to end, with small holes bored at\r\nintervals of an inch, should direct a sharp, cutting shower of water on\r\nthe tomatoes as they revolve and rub each other. A fine, sharp spray\r\nwill accomplish more than a less forceful but larger stream of water\r\ncoming from a larger opening. The dirt, mold, etc. is washed through the\r\nwire mesh into a drip pan, and thence to the sewer.\r\n\r\nSome of the rotary washers used are of solid metal, and others\r\nconstructed of wooden slats have been used. Both of these should be\r\navoided, as the solid metal produces a sliding, instead of a rolling\r\naction, and the wooden slats mold quickly and become slimy. Also, some\r\nof the washers are slightly too narrow, and the tomatoes are so crowded\r\nwhile they are rotating that many of them do not come in contact with\r\nthe wire, but merely roll on top of other tomatoes. Other washers are\r\nconsiderably wider than necessary. If the tomatoes are to be fed to the\r\nbelt at the rate of 2 bushels per minute, a reel (squirrel cage) washer\r\n2 to 2½ feet in diameter, and about 8 feet long, having an inclination\r\nof about 1 foot in 8, and revolving at about 20 revolutions per minute,\r\nwill usually give satisfactory results. These are the figures\r\nrecommended by Mr. Howard of the Bureau of Chemistry, who has made a\r\nvery extensive study of the efficiency of rotary washers.\r\n\r\nBy having the tomatoes thoroughly clean, with no mud and scarcely any\r\nmold adhering to the surface when they drop on the sorting belt, the\r\namount of sorting required is not only greatly lessened, but the spots\r\nof black rot and other forms of decay show up prominently on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the reel deliver the tomatoes to the sorting belt\r\nat a uniform rate, which is seldom done when the crates are dumped into\r\nthe reel without any system of timing them. At present a hopper for\r\nfeeding the reel is being experimented with, and it is hoped that it\r\nwill be an improvement over the uncontrolled system that is now used.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection made to the reel cylinder is that when tomatoes are\r\noverripe, having been shipped a long distance, or held at the factory\r\nfor a day or two, the rubbing action of the wire on the tomatoes, and of\r\nthe tomatoes against each other, is too severe, and considerable tomato\r\nsubstance is lost by being forced down through the wire mesh by the\r\nsharp sprays of water from overhead. The loss in this case is not nearly\r\nas great as would be imagined, and what tomato substance is thus lost\r\nshould be discarded anyway, as it is so soft that in all probability the\r\nfiber is permeated with growths of mold, yeasts, and bacteria, which no\r\namount of washing would eliminate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Water Bath With Compressed Air\r\n\r\nThe reel washer is not so common in the east as in the west, and the\r\nreason is, as previously stated, that during the greater part of the\r\nseason at least, tomatoes grown on loose, sandy soil can be washed\r\nsatisfactorily by other devices which are less cumbersome and can be\r\nmore easily rigged up. One of these devices which is in satisfactory\r\noperation is a shallow water bath through which the tomatoes pass on a\r\nchain carrier, and in which the water is kept “boiling” (that is, it has\r\nthe appearance of boiling) by compressed air which is forced into the\r\nwater bath through small pipes, and at a number of different places. The\r\ntomatoes are thus bounced around and knocked against each other in a\r\nvery lively manner and receive a thorough cleansing. It is very\r\ndoubtful, however, if this device would give such good results on\r\ntomatoes that had clay baked hard on the surface, or on those which had\r\nmold deeply imbedded in cracks at the stem end.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Importance of Agitation\r\n\r\nIt is always advisable to wash the tomatoes before sorting them, as it\r\nmakes the sorter’s work so much easier. After the tomatoes leave the\r\nsorting belt they can pass under a few strong sprays which will put on\r\nthe finishing touches. Warm or hot water is sometimes used in washing\r\ntomatoes, but cold water does the work just as well. Neither will\r\naccomplish much more than wetting the surface unless the tomatoes are\r\nagitated. Some devices which I have seen are almost worse than nothing,\r\nas they merely consist of a long water bath through which the tomatoes\r\nare conveyed by means of a large worm or helicoid. The tomatoes are not\r\nonly washed insufficiently, but are contaminated by rubbing against the\r\nsurface of the worm, which soon becomes coated with a film of mold, and,\r\nbeing enclosed in a cylinder, this worm cannot be cleaned as it should\r\nbe. It is essential that every part of the equipment with which the\r\ntomatoes come in contact be readily accessible to the brush and the\r\nsteam hose. Mold accumulates very rapidly, clings very tenaciously to\r\nthe surface on which it grows, and a damp surface in a dark place is\r\nideal for its growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Plain Sorting Belt\r\n\r\nThe type of sorting belt used most commonly is the ordinary plain wire\r\nor metal belt 18 to 24 inches in width and about 10 to 12 feet in\r\nlength. Canvas belts are also used quite frequently, but the packer can\r\nnow obtain wire belts of such strong, sturdy construction that they give\r\nscarcely any trouble and are very satisfactory in every way. Eighteen to\r\ntwenty inches has been found to be about the best width.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Number of Sorters\r\n\r\nThe number of sorters which should be employed on each belt depends upon\r\nwhether they are going to do both the inspecting and trimming, or the\r\ninspecting alone, and also upon the rate at which the tomatoes are fed\r\nto the belt, the length of the belt, and the quality of the fruit. Some\r\npulp makers prefer to feed the belt at a uniform rate regardless of the\r\nquality of the fruit and to vary the number of sorters, employing about\r\n14 or 16 to a belt when the quality is poor, and about half that number\r\nwhen the tomatoes are almost entirely sound and need very little\r\ntrimming done to them. Others prefer to use the same number of sorters\r\nand trimmers on the belt all the time and to vary the speed of the belt\r\naccording to the quality of the fruit, using a variable speed\r\ntransmission for this purpose. When running on solid fruit, with very\r\nlittle decay, the maximum speed can be employed, say 40 feet per minute,\r\nand when running on stock that is not so good the speed can be decreased\r\nto about 10 feet per minute.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Chemistry advises very strongly against the practice of\r\nhaving the women who do the inspecting do the trimming also. They\r\ncontend that inspecting and trimming should be two distinct and separate\r\noperations and each should be done by a different set of women. By this\r\nmethod the women on the sorting belt merely pick out all the tomatoes\r\nwhich are imperfect and throw them into receiving boxes which are\r\nattached to the framework of the sorting belt by a bracket, there being\r\nabout four of these boxes to a table—two on each side. One or two women\r\nstand at each receiving box, pick out the defective tomatoes from this\r\nbox, and trim out the bad part, which is dropped into a chute, which\r\ndirects the material down to a drain underneath the table through which\r\nis flowing the waste water from the rotary washer. This stream, properly\r\nplaced, has sufficient current to carry away the waste matter. The\r\ntrimmer throws the good part of the tomato back on to the sorting belt.\r\nBy using this system there is no lugging of boxes or buckets back and\r\nforth from the sorting table.\r\n\r\nThis method, which is the one approved by the Bureau of Chemistry,\r\naccomplishes the work more thoroughly than can be done if the inspecting\r\nand trimming are all done on the sorting belt by the same set of women.\r\nThe minimum cost of sorting and trimming in this manner is from 2 to 3\r\ncents per bushel, according to the government figures.\r\n\r\nIf the women on the sorting belt are to be used for both inspecting and\r\ntrimming, a longer belt should be used than if inspecting alone is to be\r\ndone. About 2 feet of belt should be allowed to each sorter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Tomato Turning Device\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.—Tomato turning device on sorting belt.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere is another feature which helps greatly in sorting, and that is a\r\ntomato turning device, which is illustrated in Figure 1. This device\r\nturns a very large percentage of the tomatoes if they are fed to the\r\nbelt properly, that is, if they are spread out evenly and are not too\r\nthick on the belt. The turning device allows them to be inspected from\r\nall angles, and is described in Bulletin 569 of the U.S. Department of\r\nAgriculture as follows:\r\n\r\n“For an apron (sorting belt) 18 inches wide, 14 pieces of ¾ inch iron\r\npipe (1 inch outside) were cut, each piece about 7 inches long. About\r\none-half inch from one end of each piece a hole was drilled through the\r\npipe large enough to permit of the pipes being strung on a ¼ inch steel\r\nrod. In order to insure freedom of movement, a thin washer was placed\r\nbetween each pipe and the one next to it. The whole set was then\r\nsuspended by means of the steel rod across the sorting apron with the\r\nlower ends one-half inch above the apron. A back-stop rod is put in\r\nbehind the set to prevent the pipes from swinging back past the center.\r\nThis was found necessary to prevent them from swinging so far back as to\r\nstrike and gouge the oncoming tomatoes. * * * In operation the weight of\r\nthe pipes is sufficient to roll the tomatoes over as they pass under.”\r\n\r\n“In order to obtain satisfactory operation it is most important that the\r\ntomatoes do not cover more than 50 per cent of the apron area, otherwise\r\nthey do not have room to turn properly. A test at one plant showed that\r\n70 to 80 per cent of the tomatoes were turned each time they passed\r\nunder a set of the pipes. It was found also that this turning device\r\nworked better on the open metal apron than on the canvas or rubber type,\r\nowing to the fact that the tomatoes slipped badly on aprons made of\r\ncanvas or rubber.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Divided Sorting Belt\r\n\r\nThere is a modification of the plain belt which is in use at several\r\nplants, and which some operators like very much. This belt is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 2. Note that it is divided into three partitions by\r\ntwo boards which run lengthwise. These boards are about 3 inches high\r\nand are raised a fraction of an inch above the belt so as to allow the\r\nbelt to slide under them easily. At the head of the belt the board\r\npartitions connect in a “V”. The tomatoes strike this V and are guided\r\ninto the two outer channels, where they are given a hasty inspection by\r\nthe first four sorters, who throw all those which are perfectly sound\r\ninto the center partition. As the tomatoes which remain in the two\r\noutside partitions pass down to the rest of the sorters they are\r\ninspected, the bad parts cut out, and the good part thrown into the\r\ncenter partition. The bad parts which are cut out are left on the\r\noutside partitions, where they are carried along into two waste barrels,\r\nwhich are provided for this purpose at the end of the belt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG·2 DIVIDED SORTING BELT]\r\n\r\nBy using this method no tomatoes but good ones can go through unless bad\r\nones are carelessly thrown into the center partition and every tomato\r\nHAS to be picked up. Of course, some bad tomatoes are thrown into the\r\ncenter carelessly, where they will remain unless taken out by the final\r\ninspector, who is supposed to watch this. However, the number which are\r\nthus thrown in are not great if the first four women on the belt are\r\ntrained as they should be—that is, to only throw those tomatoes in the\r\ncenter which a hasty inspection shows are perfectly sound, and to leave\r\nall doubtful ones pass by.\r\n\r\nBy this method each good tomato is only inspected once, which is not the\r\ncase with any of the other systems, and in that respect it is more\r\nefficient. One good tomato is not picked up, looked at, and placed on\r\nthe belt again by a number of different sorters. When a tomato is picked\r\nup by a sorter some disposition is made of it at once. If good it is\r\ntossed in the center and is never looked at again except by the final\r\ninspector. If bad, the good part is thrown in the center and the bad\r\nallowed to remain on the outside, to be conducted to the waste barrel.\r\nAll the sorters except the first four can spend their entire time\r\nworking on tomatoes which need to have bad parts cut out of them.\r\n\r\nThe main objection which is made to the divided belt system is that the\r\nfirst four women get careless and throw unsound tomatoes into the center\r\npartition and they are never looked at again. However, if care is used\r\nin the selection of these women, and a reliable sorter is placed at the\r\nend of the belt to inspect the center partition before it leaves the\r\nbelt, such carelessness can be checked and held down to a minimum.\r\nAnother objection that is advanced is that there is the possibility of\r\npartly good tomatoes going into the waste barrels due to the fact that\r\nthe women might not always keep up on them. In my experience with the\r\nsystem I have had practically no trouble in this regard. If a long belt\r\nis used, as many trimmers as desired can be put on, and the belt can be\r\nslowed down or the rate at which it is fed slowed up if the tomatoes are\r\nrunning particularly bad. Then, in extreme cases, it is always possible\r\nto have someone go over the waste barrels before they are dumped.\r\n\r\nAn average grade of tomatoes can be handled quite rapidly by the divided\r\nbelt system. Some packers who have used it several seasons like it very\r\nmuch, and an analysis of their product will generally show a low count\r\nof molds, yeasts and spores, and bacteria. I understand, also, that\r\nother packers that have used the method have discarded it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Sorting\r\n\r\nBy far the greater part of the trouble packers have with their goods not\r\ncomplying with the government regulations as to molds, yeasts and\r\nspores, and bacteria is due to inadequate sorting. At least ninety per\r\ncent of this trouble could be overcome right at the sorting belt.\r\nPackers often say they can’t understand why the mold is running high on\r\ntheir pulp and catsup, as they are sorting their tomatoes carefully.\r\nHowever, the chances are ten to one the trouble is they are not sorting\r\nthem carefully enough. One who has not had much experience managing help\r\non the tomato sorting belt would imagine that almost any woman could\r\nstep up there and sort out the good tomatoes from the bad, and know what\r\nto cut out, and what not to cut out. But such is not the case. The\r\ntomato sorters must be instructed. Someone who is competent to do so\r\nmust work with each one of them and show them just what is a good tomato\r\nand what is not. Otherwise they will be spending part of their time\r\ncutting out black, fibrous growths on the surface of the tomatoes which\r\nare absolutely normal and entirely free from molds, etc., and allowing\r\ntomatoes to pass by them which have black spots on the surface no bigger\r\nthan a dime, but indicating to the trained eye that probably half of the\r\ntomato is eaten up with black rot. They will allow a tomato to pass by\r\nwhich is cracked open, and the edge of the skin on each side of the\r\ncrack will be as white as a piece of paper. Unless they are instructed,\r\nthey may not realize that this is mold, and they certainly will not\r\nrealize the amount of damage a small percentage of tomatoes like that\r\ncan do. They know nothing about mold counts, but most women can be\r\nimpressed with the importance of watching for moldy streaks and spots in\r\nmashed and split tomatoes, and the importance of eliminating every bit\r\nof tomato tissue that is so effected.\r\n\r\nEvery sorting belt should have a boss—a competent sorter who knows his\r\nor her business, and who stands at the end of the belt and inspects the\r\ntomatoes just as they are about to leave the belt. This person can order\r\nthe speed at which the tomatoes are fed to the sorters increased or\r\ndecreased according to the quality, can see just what form of decay is\r\npredominating and caution the sorters to watch out for it, can see the\r\nmistakes that are being made in the sorting and try to correct them, and\r\nin addition can throw out into a receptacle such bad tomatoes as have\r\npassed by the sorters so that they can be sorted over again. It is not\r\nsafe to put a bunch of women on the sorting belt with no one in\r\nauthority who is on that particular job every minute, and expect an\r\nentire day’s run to come within the government limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Forms of Decay\r\n\r\nThere are many forms of rot, but the most common are the black rot, soft\r\nrot, and the mold growths in cracked tomatoes, either those which have\r\ncracked deeply around the stem end during their growth, or have been\r\ncracked or mashed in shipment. Just as soon as the skin is broken,\r\neither in a natural or unnatural way, molds start growing on that broken\r\nsurface immediately, and develop very rapidly.\r\n\r\nThere is also the brown spotted tomato, which is not so common, but\r\nwhich has been very bad in some localities. I remember one field of\r\ntomatoes in southern Ohio several years ago which was absolutely\r\nworthless for canning purposes, due to the fact that practically all of\r\nthe tomatoes were covered with brown spots, and under each one of these\r\nspots was a lump of white mold and mold spores. This field was plowed up\r\nbefore half of the tomatoes were picked, as the pulp plant which had\r\ncontracted them refused to receive any more after having cooked several\r\nbatches of pulp on which the mold ran very high due to this condition,\r\nwhich had never been met with before. The brown spots were soft and\r\nconcave, and if once the character of the spot was fixed in the memory\r\none could never fail to quickly detect that type of tomato if it was run\r\nacross again.\r\n\r\nThe disease appeared in both central and southern Indiana the following\r\nyear and I sent samples of the tomatoes to the Department of Agriculture\r\nat Washington and to the Indiana state experiment station, but it was\r\nnew to them and they had no remedy for it. Whether it has appeared since\r\nI do not know, but it was very bad while it lasted. It is almost\r\nimpossible to sort such tomatoes, as the spots are so numerous on the\r\nsurface, and every spot would have to be cut out. When the spots are\r\nsmall, as they frequently are, they are very apt to pass by the sorters\r\nunnoticed, or at any rate considered harmless, but it doesn’t take many\r\nbushels of such tomatoes to send a batch over the limit in mold count.\r\n\r\nExtremely soft spots which will yield to very slight pressure with the\r\nfinger are usually receptacles for the growth of yeasts and bacteria and\r\nshould be cut out. Nine times out of ten such spots are offensive to the\r\nnose when the skin of the tomato is broken. However, one quickly learns\r\nto pick them out by sight.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the sorting belt be well lighted with 100–watt\r\nlamps overhead provided with large reflectors. On dark days good sorting\r\nis impossible unless the belt is adequately lighted, and, of course, for\r\nsorting in the early morning or late evening adequate light is\r\nabsolutely essential.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Cleanliness of Equipment\r\n\r\nTo dwell upon the necessity of thoroughly cleaning all washing and\r\nsorting equipment each night, as well as to frequently change the water\r\nin water baths, in case a water bath is used, would seem almost\r\nunnecessary, yet there are many packers who do not comprehend the\r\ntrouble that can be caused by inadequate cleaning of the washing,\r\nsorting, and conveying equipment.\r\n\r\nDoes the sorting and washing equipment in every pulp plant impart a\r\nclean, fresh, sweet smell when the morning’s work is begun? It does not,\r\nand the reason is that it was not properly cleaned the night before.\r\nThose surfaces which were easy to get at and which are easily seen in a\r\nhasty inspection are clean, of course, but how about the dark corners\r\nand almost inaccessible places that are hard to clean? Can you run your\r\nfingernail over the surface of one of the bucket conveyors, or\r\n“flights,” for example, and scrape off a thin, slimy film? If you can,\r\nyou can be sure it is mold, and that the only way to get it off is with\r\na very stiff brush—even a wire one may be necessary—hot water, and soda\r\nash. If the bucket conveyors or “flights” are covered with a thin film\r\nof mold, the tomatoes will carry along a small part of this mold with\r\nthem every time the conveyor is used, and as fast as the mold is rubbed\r\noff the conveyor by the tomatoes more mold will grow on again.\r\n\r\nThe same care should be taken with this equipment as is given to the\r\nequipment in a milk bottling or condensing plant. My experience has been\r\nthat the only safe way to check up the thoroughness of the cleaning job\r\nis to go over it with a spot light, with particular attention to the\r\nmost inaccessible parts, and to do everything possible to make every\r\npart of the equipment accessible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Molds, Yeasts and Spores, and Bacteria\r\n\r\nAn understanding of the nature of molds, yeasts and spores, and bacteria\r\nis very helpful to any packer. A knowledge of the rapidity of their\r\ngrowth and the conditions under which they multiply most rapidly is also\r\nhelpful. The average packer has a very vague idea of this subject, yet\r\nit is easy of comprehension. In CHAPTER VII a discussion of it will be\r\nfound, which it is hoped will help to clear up the misty atmosphere\r\nsurrounding this subject, and in the same chapter the government\r\nattitude toward micro-organisms is also discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                  PRINCIPAL METHODS IN USE FOR PULPING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief methods in use for preparing the tomatoes for the cooking\r\nkettle are: first, cold pulping; second, hot pulping; third, crushing\r\nwithout cycloning.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Cold Pulping\r\n\r\nThe cold pulping method is probably the most common, and requires less\r\nequipment than the hot method, with results that are considered by many\r\npackers just as good, if the pulp machine is operated by a careful man\r\nwho will not feed it too fast, and who will keep it clean. Sometimes,\r\nwith this method, the tomatoes are run through a crusher before pulping,\r\nand sometimes not.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Care of Cyclone\r\n\r\nIt is important that the outlet from the receiving box under the cyclone\r\nbe directly from the bottom, and not from the side of the box near the\r\nbottom. The box must drain completely so as not to leave any tomato\r\njuice lying in it to ferment. A tapering enamel lined receptacle which\r\ndrains itself completely is best to use under the cyclone.\r\n\r\nThe steam hose should be turned into both the cyclone and receiving box\r\nseveral times during the day to arrest growths of micro-organisms, and\r\nclean out adhering tomato fiber. It is particularly important to do this\r\njust before the noon hour, as considerable fermentation can take place\r\nin the cyclone during that hour if it is not cleaned out beforehand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Hot Pulping\r\n\r\nBy the hot pulping method the tomatoes are conveyed, usually by means of\r\na series of “flights,” or a bucket conveyor, to “breaking tanks” which\r\nare arranged above the cyclones. These “breaking tanks” hold about 1000\r\ngallons, and are usually constructed of cypress. At the bottom of the\r\ntank are open brass steam pipes running horizontally in four directions.\r\nThese pipes are about two feet in length, and are open at the ends so\r\nthat the steam comes directly in contact with the tomatoes. The tomatoes\r\nare conveyed direct from the sorting belt to the “breaking tanks,” and\r\nas soon as the brass pipes are covered the steam is turned on full and\r\nthe breaking up process begins. It usually takes about 30 minutes to\r\nbreak up the tomatoes, and they are then cycloned. The tank should have\r\na concave bottom and large outlet, preferably 3 inch, so that the broken\r\nup tomatoes can be let out of the tank easily. Iron pipes should, of\r\ncourse, be avoided, as the acid of the tomato attacks the iron,\r\nproducing an iron salt which is apt to discolor the product,\r\nparticularly if it is to be used for catsup, and this dissolved iron\r\ncomes in contact with the tannic acid of the spices. This will be\r\ndiscussed further under the manufacture of catsup.\r\n\r\nSome packers object to brass and copper coming in contact with the\r\ntomatoes on account of the slight amount of copper which goes into\r\nsolution by the action of the tomato acid. In the case of the “breaking\r\ntank,” however, the few short brass pipes offer a very small surface to\r\nthe action of the tomato acid, and the amount of metal dissolved would\r\nbe negligible. These brass pipes can be plated with tin if it is desired\r\nto avoid contact with brass altogether, and this is frequently done.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Advantages Claimed for Hot Pulping\r\n\r\nThose who use the hot pulping method like it for a number of reasons. In\r\nthe first place, the tomatoes are brought to a boil while they are still\r\nwhole, and this eliminates any chance of fermentation due to the\r\ncrushing of the tomatoes before they are cooked. By bringing the\r\ntomatoes to a boil quickly, that is, as soon as the washing and sorting\r\nis completed, any incipient fermentation is arrested immediately. As the\r\ntomato juice is near the boiling point when it is cycloned and delivered\r\nto the cooking kettles, no multiplication of yeasts, bacteria, etc. can\r\ntake place between the sorting and the final condensing, unless the\r\njuice is allowed to cool considerably at some point between the\r\n“breaking tank” and the cooking kettle.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage claimed for the hot process is that the pulp of the\r\ntomato is more completely separated from the seed and skin than when the\r\ntomatoes are pulped cold, and therefore the tomatoes will give a\r\nslightly larger yield of pulp. It is also claimed that a better color\r\ncan be obtained by the hot pulping process, as the color cells of the\r\ntomato lie in greatest abundance directly next to the skin, and by\r\nmaking a clean cut separation of the skin from these color cells by\r\nboiling in a “breaking tank,” none of this color will be lost in the\r\npumice during the cycloning. Although this argument does appear\r\nreasonable, I have failed to see that tomatoes which are pulped by the\r\nhot process give any better color than those which are pulped cold.\r\n\r\nThe hot process is also liked where the tomatoes are to be manufactured\r\ndirectly into catsup or tomato soup, as the “breaking tank” can be\r\nfilled up to a certain mark with the boiling tomatoes and that gives the\r\nmeasure of tomatoes for the catsup or soup batch, and no other measuring\r\ndevices for this purpose need be employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Objections to Hot Process\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to the hot process is that it requires a lot of\r\nadditional tanks for breaking the tomatoes, which are entirely dispensed\r\nwith when cold pulping is used. The tanks are not only an additional\r\nexpense to the equipment, but require one or two operators to tend to\r\nthem, and they take up a lot of room, and consume a lot of steam. No\r\nseed can be saved from tomatoes which are pulped hot, as the cooking\r\neither kills the germ or renders it impotent. Quite a few canners save\r\nthe seed from cold pulped tomatoes, and the revenue from it proves to be\r\na profitable item.\r\n\r\nAs to whether the slightly increased yield to be obtained by the hot\r\npulping method, and the decreased danger of multiplication of yeasts and\r\nbacteria, more than compensate for the advantages to be obtained by the\r\ncold process is a question which the individual packer must decide for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Crushing\r\n\r\nCrushing the tomatoes without cycloning them is a very good method where\r\nthe tomatoes are going to be made into pulp or puree, as the finishing\r\nmachine will convert the crushed cooked tomatoes into a very smooth\r\nproduct. Where catsup is to be made direct from the tomatoes, however,\r\ncycloning is to be preferred to crushing. If the final product is to be\r\nsoup, cycloning is necessary. This will be discussed further in the\r\nchapters on catsup and soup.\r\n\r\nWhen a crusher is used it takes the place of the cyclone or pulp\r\nmachine, although it performs an entirely different kind of an\r\noperation, and the tomatoes go through exactly the same process as in\r\ncold pulping, except that instead of removing the seeds and skins from\r\nthe tomatoes before cooking, the tomatoes are chopped very fine and\r\nconveyed to the cooking kettles—seeds, skin and all. It is obviously\r\nsomewhat harder to gauge the finishing point of a batch of pulp where\r\nthe skins and seeds are present, however a little practice largely\r\neliminates this difficulty, and there is always the method of\r\ndetermining the specific gravity by weight to fall back on. The seeds\r\nand skins will not interfere with making the specific gravity test as it\r\nis usually carried out in the cook room with a large copper flask, small\r\ntrip balance, and set of weights.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Conveying to Kettle\r\n\r\nIf the plant is so arranged that the pulped or crushed tomatoes can be\r\nconveyed to the cooking kettles by gravity, that is an advantage, as it\r\ndoes away with a pump and someone to tend to it, and the fewer the\r\npumps, the better; however, in most plants it is necessary to pump the\r\npulped or crushed stock into the cooking kettles. Unless the plant\r\nconsists of several floors and the tomatoes start at the top and come\r\nout as finished pulp at the bottom, or the plant is built on a terraced\r\nplan, as one plant is in Indiana, which is built on the side of a hill,\r\nit is necessary to do a certain amount of pumping. An ordinary pump will\r\nnot do, as there would be contamination by iron, and considerable\r\nrusting, while the pump was idle, of those parts of the pump with which\r\ntomato juice comes in contact, this rust to be carried along with the\r\ntomato juice the first time the pump is used again. The rotary pump\r\nconstructed partly of bronze or nickel is very good for this purpose,\r\nand offers as little opportunity for metallic contamination as any pump\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nThe pipe used for the conveying of this tomato stock should by all means\r\nbe enamel lined. Enamel lined pipe, if properly made, will last for many\r\nyears without chipping or cracking. Just how long it will last on the\r\naverage I cannot say, but I have often taken down lines of enamel lined\r\npipe that have been in use for several years, and it looked practically\r\nas good as new. The flanged pipe with flanged fittings is better than\r\nthat with the ordinary screw ends, as it makes practically a continuous\r\nwhite tube without any pipe threads in which molds, yeasts, and bacteria\r\ncan lodge and multiply.\r\n\r\nWooden troughs are still used in many plants for conveying tomato juice\r\nand pulp, but they are a relic of the old days, and have no place in the\r\nmodern pulp or catsup plant. Wooden troughs are hard to keep clean, they\r\nmold very quickly after they become damp, they are open to contamination\r\nfrom ceilings and roofs which aren’t always in good condition, and they\r\nare usually wasteful. It will pay any packer who still uses even a few\r\nwooden troughs to invest in enamel lined pipe. Wooden pipe is also\r\nunsanitary for this purpose, as mold grows in it and clings so tightly\r\nto the porous, damp surface that it cannot possibly be flushed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Value of Pumice\r\n\r\nThis chapter, which deals principally with cycloning, seems to be a\r\nfitting place to discuss the value of the pumice which comes as a waste\r\nproduct from the cyclone. Although it has been repeatedly demonstrated\r\nby chemical analysis that this pumice or tomato waste is a valuable\r\nby-product, every time the question has come up of its utilization and\r\npreparation into a salable product or products, the decision has been\r\nthat the expense involved would be too great to make it pay. This\r\nby-product is profitably handled in Italy, producing an oil of\r\ncommercial value, and an oil cake which is used for stock feed; however,\r\nthe conditions in Italy and in this country are very different. In the\r\nParma district of Italy there are forty factories very close together,\r\nand little expense is involved in bringing the waste to a central point\r\nwhere enough of it can be had to keep a drying outfit and an oil press\r\nor oil extraction outfit busy. Labor is also very cheap and plentiful,\r\nand there is a ready market for the product, the oil being used as a\r\nsoap stock, and the oil cake finding ready sale as a stock feed. In this\r\ncountry, however, there is not enough waste at even one of the largest\r\nplants to pay for the operation of a drying outfit and the pulp plants\r\nare so scattered that hauling or shipping charges to a central point\r\nwould be expensive. Furthermore, labor is scarce and expensive.\r\n\r\nThat quite a little labor is involved in the preparation of the waste is\r\nsoon discovered by a little experimenting. As the waste ferments quickly\r\nit must be handled as produced, or preserved in some way, which would be\r\na questionable operation, as the oil cake is used for stock feed. As the\r\nskins are practically valueless, they must be separated from the seeds\r\nin which all the value lies. This separation can either be carried out\r\nin the moist state by a gravity separation in water, in which the seeds,\r\nbeing heavy, sink, and the skins float; or by the use of a fanning mill\r\nafter drying, in which case the dried skins, being very light, are blown\r\nout. Before drying either the seeds alone or the unseparated waste, the\r\nexcess moisture must be pressed out with a hydraulic press. The pressed\r\nproduct must then be broken up and put through a steam or hot air dryer\r\nof the rotary, cylindrical type. After the seeds are dried to a 10 per\r\ncent moisture basis they must then be ground, and the oil extracted\r\neither by pressure, or by dissolving it out with a chemical agent, such\r\nas carbon tetrachloride. The oil cake which remains would then be sacked\r\nfor stock feed.\r\n\r\nThis briefly gives an idea of the labor involved, and the difficulties\r\nsurrounding the situation. It may be successfully worked out some time,\r\nbut will require close co-operation from a number of large pulp plants\r\nwhich are near each other to be a success. Some plants are giving the\r\nwaste to farmers if they will haul it away, and I know of one farmer who\r\nhas for years fattened a bunch of hogs cheaply during the tomato season\r\nin this way. It is a queer thing, though, that most farmers turn up\r\ntheir noses at the idea.\r\n\r\nThe seed, when dried to a 10 per cent moisture basis, contains about 23\r\nper cent protein and from 20 to 25 per cent of fat. After the fat is\r\nextracted the protein in the cake will run close to 30 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn a test made by the U. S. Department of Agriculture the ground cake\r\nran 37 per cent in protein, which puts it in about the same class with\r\ncottonseed meal. They also refined some of the oil and are of the\r\nopinion that it has the qualities of an edible oil.\r\n\r\nIf a factory uses the cold pulping method the most profitable way to\r\nhandle the pumice is to ferment it and then separate the seed and dry\r\nit, and use it for planting the following season. Care must be taken,\r\nhowever, to keep out undesirable strains and varieties foreign to the\r\none which is being grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n              CONDENSING THE STRAINED OR CRUSHED TOMATOES\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Vacuum Pan\r\n\r\nPractically all of the tomato products made in this country are cooked\r\nin an open kettle under atmospheric pressure—either a copper-jacketed\r\nkettle, or a tank with a closed coil. The vacuum pan is used, however,\r\nin several plants, and makes a very high grade product—a better product\r\nas a rule than can be made by condensing under atmospheric pressure.\r\nWhen tomato juice is condensed in vacuum it boils at anywhere from 54\r\ndegrees F. to 175 degrees F., depending upon the degree of vacuum\r\nobtained. At sea level, under atmospheric pressure, it boils at 212\r\ndegrees F. By employing a low temperature, and condensing rapidly, which\r\ncan be done in the vacuum pan, the natural bright red color of the\r\ntomatoes is affected very little by the cooking. High temperatures and\r\ncontinued boiling are the agents which destroy tomato color as well as\r\nflavor. The vacuum pan produces a pulp of not only fine color, but of\r\nvery fine flavor. The reason the vacuum method is not used more\r\nfrequently than it is is undoubtedly due to the difficulty in getting\r\nthe vacuum equipment, and also to the expense of the equipment when it\r\ncan be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Types of Open Kettles\r\n\r\nThe open kettle method produces a very satisfactory product when the\r\nproper precautions are taken, and if the cooking and subsequent\r\nprocesses are carried out intelligently, the finished product compares\r\nvery favorably with that which is condensed in vacuum. The types of\r\nkettles in most common use are the copper jacketed kettle, the\r\nglass-lined tank with closed copper coil, and the cypress tank with\r\nclosed copper coil. All of these give good results where the jacket or\r\ncoil is properly constructed, the steam trap is of the right type and\r\ntakes care of all of the condensation without allowing it to back up\r\ninto the coil, and the kettle has a good head of steam so that a\r\nvigorous boil can be maintained throughout the cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Steam Pressure\r\n\r\nIf the steam pressure at the boiler is kept above 75 lbs., and too much\r\nis not lost by radiation from uncovered pipes, and by leaks at poorly\r\npacked flanges, etc., there should be no difficulty in maintaining a\r\nvigorous boil. The evaporation should be so rapid that the vaporizing\r\nsteam will burn the hand, even if placed over the kettle for a second.\r\nIf you can hold your hand over a kettle of boiling pulp, even for a few\r\nseconds, you can be sure that you are not getting a proper boil. A\r\npressure of 100 lbs. is, of course, to be preferred to 75, as it will\r\neffect a quicker condensation, however there is not a large percentage\r\nof boilers in tomato pulp plants that are permitted to carry as much as\r\n100 lbs.\r\n\r\nThe kettles should be close to the boiler room, and the steam pipes\r\nfeeding them should be as straight and short as possible, and covered\r\nwith magnesia pipe covering to prevent excessive loss of heat by\r\nradiation. It is not an uncommon sight in canning plants to see the main\r\npipe from the boiler to the cooking kettles pass through an areaway\r\nbetween two buildings, and have no protective covering whatever. Such\r\nsights, however, are becoming more infrequent, as packers are plugging\r\nup many of the leaks through which dollars have escaped every day in\r\nyears gone by. The condensation from the steam traps can, of course, be\r\nused right over again in the boilers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Copper-Jacketed Kettles\r\n\r\nCopper-jacketed kettles used for condensing tomato products range all\r\nthe way from 50 gallons capacity to 500 gallons, the larger size making\r\na batch of finished pulp of about 250 gallons as a rule. A larger batch\r\nthan this can be cooked in a 500–gallon kettle, but it is not advisable\r\nto keep pumping fresh tomato juice into the kettle too long, as it gives\r\ntoo long a cook to the first that goes in. Forty-five minutes should be\r\nthe absolute limit for a batch of pulp, no matter what kind of a kettle\r\nit is cooked in, and it is much better to confine the cooking time to 30\r\nminutes or less. The shorter the cook, the better the color and flavor\r\nof the finished product, other things being equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Tinning Kettles\r\n\r\nCopper kettles are frequently lined with block tin to prevent the acid\r\nof the tomato from dissolving some of the copper. The desirability of\r\nthis is argued both from a standpoint of health and flavor, as dissolved\r\ncopper, even in small quantity, has a very bitter taste. It should be\r\nremembered, however, that the acid of the tomato, which is generally\r\nthought to be citric acid, is a weak organic acid, and the amount of\r\ncopper dissolved in a batch cooked not over an hour is exceedingly\r\nsmall; certainly so small as to have no ill effect upon health. As to\r\nthe question of flavor, it would indeed take a very delicate palate to\r\ndetect among a half dozen samples which ones were cooked in an unlined\r\ncopper kettle, and which in a kettle lined with block tin or silver. The\r\nlatter is said to be used by some packers.\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea, however, to play safe, and line all kettles with\r\nblock tin, as we know that there is a small amount of copper taken up in\r\nsolution in the pulp. This is more important in the case of catsup and\r\nchili sauce than where the kettles are used for pulp alone, as vinegar\r\nand salt act on the copper much more severely than tomato acid does. As\r\nto the thickness of the block tin lining, an inspection of the kettles\r\nused by various packers shows this to run all the way from a good\r\nhalf-inch thick to a coating so thin that in one season’s use it is\r\nalmost all scraped off by friction in cleaning the kettle. The kettles\r\nshould be plated heavy enough to last several seasons without\r\nre-tinning, however a coating a half-inch thick is unnecessary and\r\nwasteful of steam. The same remarks apply to the tinning of copper\r\ncoils.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Advantages of Various Types of Kettles\r\n\r\nAlthough copper-jacketed kettles have the advantage of being very easily\r\ncleaned, and also the advantage of wasting very little of the product\r\nwhen the finished batch is being discharged, the large tanks of either\r\ncypress or glass-lined steel are coming into use more and more because\r\nof their greater capacity. It is true that they are very slightly more\r\nwasteful than the jacketed kettles, but this really amounts to very\r\nlittle if the tanks are built with a concave bottom. They take up no\r\nmore room than the jacketed kettles, and will hold a much larger volume,\r\nas they can be built so much higher. If one were to buy a series of\r\ncopper-jacketed kettles to cook batches as large as are commonly cooked\r\nin tanks equipped with copper coils, the expense would be very heavy,\r\nthere would be much exposure to metal, and the results obtained would be\r\nno better, or possibly not as good. In the tank equipped with a coil,\r\nbatches of 300 or 400 gallons are often cooked, and the juice can\r\ngenerally be condensed to a specific gravity of 1.035 in 25 to 30\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Glass-Lined Tank\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years quite a few packers, when adding to their\r\ncooking capacity, have put in glass-lined steel tanks. The glass-lined\r\ntank is equipped with coil and steam trap in the same manner as the\r\ncypress tank, and it has certain advantages which make it very nice to\r\nwork with, even though the first cost is considerably more than that of\r\na cypress tank of equal capacity. The only objection I have heard to the\r\nglass-lined tank is that it radiates more heat than a wooden tank, and\r\non very hot days, unless it is insulated, makes the cook room more\r\nuncomfortable than the same capacity in cypress tanks would. However,\r\nwhen the tank is covered with cork insulation, or asbestos, or even wood\r\nstaves, it radiates no more heat than a cypress tank.\r\n\r\nThe glass-lined tank is perfectly sanitary, and is very easily cleaned.\r\nIt is really the most sanitary thing we have to cook in. The surface is\r\nsmooth and entirely free from any irregularities such as there are bound\r\nto be between the staves of the cypress tank. It is always ready for\r\nuse, and does not have to be swelled and then scrubbed for a half day\r\nafter standing idle for a while before it is fit to use again. There are\r\nno places for molds to creep in and multiply. Furthermore, being of\r\nmetal and all in one piece, a battery of glass-lined tanks will not\r\nshake like cypress tanks will when you are running heavy and have\r\nseveral tanks going full blast at the same time. This may seem rather\r\nunimportant, but it is quite a relief to the cook and his helpers, as\r\nthey can go about their work without having their nerves rattled. Just\r\nhow long a glass-lined tank will last under average conditions in a pulp\r\nor catsup plant is not known, as they have not been in use a great many\r\nyears for this purpose; however, one would guess that they would be\r\nserviceable almost indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Cypress Tank\r\n\r\nCypress tanks should be constructed of 2–inch material and made with a\r\nsloping or concave bottom, preferably the latter. They will not impart\r\nany foreign taste to the product, as is sometimes thought, even after\r\nbecoming charred by long usage, and if kept clean they will remain sweet\r\nas long as they are kept in continuous use. A musty taste is sometimes\r\nimparted to pulp or catsup cooked in a cypress tank if it has been\r\nstanding idle for a long time and is not thoroughly cleaned and boiled\r\nout with soda before it is used again. Cypress tanks have the advantage\r\nof being cheap, and also of having large cooking capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Cleaning Kettles\r\n\r\nCooking tanks and kettles should be cleaned thoroughly after every\r\nbatch. If the steam trap is working properly the burning on the coils\r\nand sides of the kettle will be so slight that almost all of it can be\r\nwashed off with the hose if the water pressure is strong and the hose is\r\nbushed down to one-eighth inch. The best things to use to take off the\r\nmaterial which burns on hard and black is a pot chain for coils, and for\r\nthe jacketed kettles a wire brush or very stiff fiber brush does very\r\nwell. If any of the baked on pulp is not removed before the next batch\r\nis cooked it will interfere with the cooking by lengthening the time\r\nrequired to finish the batch, and by causing the coils to burn still\r\nharder next time. The cook should be instructed to get down in the tanks\r\nfrequently, and feel underneath his coils to see that they are properly\r\ncleaned. The manager should also make it a point to do this several\r\ntimes a day. His quality will depend in no small degree on the way his\r\ncoils are cleaned.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Coil Leaks\r\n\r\nLeaks in coils should be attended to immediately, as they cut down the\r\navailable steam pressure, and soon become so large that it becomes\r\nimpossible to cook satisfactorily. An ordinary soldering job will only\r\nhold them for a day or two, and it is necessary to take out the coil and\r\nbraze it if the leak is to be permanently mended.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Starting the Cooking\r\n\r\nWe will say that we are now pumping over the cycloned or crushed\r\ntomatoes into the cooking kettle. Some packers pour a cupful of\r\ncottonseed oil in the kettle to assist in breaking the boil, others rub\r\nthe sides of the kettle with fat, such as a piece of cocoa butter, while\r\nothers use no oil or fat at all, but take care to feed the kettle slowly\r\nand carefully, and cut the foam with a sharp spray of water from the\r\nhose to assist in breaking the boil. The oil or fat does seem to help\r\nsome, but it is not necessary if the kettle is fed carefully. As soon as\r\nthe coil or jacket is covered the steam can be turned on full; however,\r\nthe exhaust should be opened immediately, and not closed until all the\r\ncondensation which has collected in the coil or jacket runs out and the\r\nsteam comes through perfectly dry. The condensation of the pulp should\r\nthen be conducted as rapidly as possible, pumping over more of the\r\ntomato juice as the kettle is able to take care of it, and boiling\r\ncontinuously. The eye soon learns to judge the approach of the finishing\r\npoint, and then the exact finishing point must be determined. There are\r\nmany ways of doing this, and a number of ways have been recommended. No\r\nmethod can succeed which is not simple and quick, and which offers\r\nscarcely any chance for error when used by a cook, whom, it must be\r\nremembered, is a man of very ordinary intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Methods of Gauging Finishing Point\r\n\r\nThe simplest method is gauging the finishing point by the eye, but this\r\nmethod is also the least accurate in the hands of the average cook.\r\nCooks who have had years of experience with tomato pulp sometimes get to\r\nbe very expert in gauging the finishing point by the eye, and can\r\ndetermine it with surprising accuracy. Such a cook is the exception,\r\nhowever, and most packers have to use some sort of a mechanical method\r\nby which at least fair accuracy can be counted on. These methods consist\r\nof: first, condensing the pulp to a certain mark on the kettle, a\r\ndefinite volume of juice having been taken to start with; second,\r\ncooking a certain length of time; third, determining the specific\r\ngravity of the hot pulp by weighing a definite quantity on a small\r\nbalance; fourth, estimating the gravity by the use of a hydrometer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Cooking to a Gauge on Kettle\r\n\r\nWith the first method the amount of tomato juice pumped into the kettle,\r\nor the number of bushels of tomatoes from which this juice was derived,\r\nmust be measured. This is a nuisance, and is not necessary with any of\r\nthe other methods except the second. Furthermore, even though every\r\nbatch of pulp cooked during the season be made from a measured quantity\r\nof tomatoes or tomato juice, and cooked to the same point on the\r\nmeasuring stick, the pulp will not all be of the same specific gravity,\r\nbecause tomatoes are very watery at some seasons of the year and very\r\nfirm and solid at other times. The watery tomatoes will make a thin\r\npulp, and the firm tomatoes will make a heavier pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Cooking a Definite Length of Time\r\n\r\nCooking for a certain length of time is not dependable because the steam\r\npressure is not always the same, the coils do not always condense the\r\npulp with the same efficiency, and the character of the tomatoes varies\r\nduring the season. With this method it is also necessary to start with a\r\ndefinite quantity of tomato stock for each batch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Determining Specific Gravity by Weight\r\n\r\nThe third method—that of determining the specific gravity by weight—is\r\nused as commonly as any of the others. The specific gravity of pulp\r\nmerely means the comparison between the weight of a definite volume of\r\nthe pulp and the weight of the same volume of water at the same\r\ntemperature. If pulp has a specific gravity of 1.035, that means that a\r\ngallon of it is 1.035 times as heavy as a gallon of water.\r\n\r\nThe determination, as carried out in the cook room, is made with a small\r\ntrip balance, a set of weights, and a copper flask which is tin lined.\r\nThe weight of the empty flask is taken. Then the weight of the flask\r\nfilled to the top with boiling water is taken. The difference between\r\nthese two weights is the weight of water at the boiling point which the\r\nflask contains. When the boiling pulp approaches the finishing point,\r\nthe flask is filled to the top with the boiling pulp. This should be\r\ndone rapidly, as the pulp cools quickly, and as it cools, decreases in\r\nvolume. The weight of the flask filled with pulp at the boiling point is\r\ntaken. This weight, minus the weight of the empty flask, equals the\r\nweight of pulp at the boiling point which the flask contains. You now\r\nhave the weight of boiling water the flask contains, and the weight of\r\nboiling pulp the flask contains. Divide the former into the latter, and\r\nthe result (the quotient) is the specific gravity. For example, if the\r\nwater weighs 1,000 grams, and the pulp weighs 1,035 grams, the specific\r\ngravity is 1.035. If the specific gravity of cold pulp is taken, then\r\ncold water of the same temperature must be taken as the comparison. The\r\nweight of cold pulp must not be compared with the weight of hot water,\r\nand vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Objections to Weighing Method\r\n\r\nOne of the objections to the use of this method is that there is usually\r\na certain amount of air bubbles and foam in the boiling pulp and this\r\ncauses an error, as the air takes up volume but does not weigh anything.\r\nAnother objection is that the determination is often not made rapidly\r\nenough, with the result that while the flask is being filled with\r\nboiling pulp, the pulp is cooling and correspondingly decreasing in\r\nvolume, and by the time the flask is full, it contains more pulp than it\r\nshould, that is, instead of containing 1,000 cubic centimeters of pulp\r\nat 210 degrees F., it will contain about 1,010 cubic centimeters of pulp\r\nat 200 degrees F., or possibly lower. One reason for this delay is that\r\nthe foam caused by filling the flask with boiling pulp rises in the neck\r\nof the flask, and makes it hard to judge when the flask is exactly full.\r\nThe main difficulty with the method, however, is that pulp cooks do not\r\nhave scientific minds, they do not appreciate the importance of doing\r\nthe determination in a strictly scientific way, and the results they get\r\nare not very accurate. I have frequently checked up on pulp cooks using\r\nthis method, and sometimes they were very decidedly off.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Testing With Hydrometer\r\n\r\nThe estimation of the gravity of the boiling pulp by the use of a\r\nhydrometer is not in very general use, and it has been stated by some\r\nscientific men that a hydrometer is no good for tomato pulp or catsup\r\nexcept where the sample on which the test is made is previously filtered\r\nso as to get a clear liquid. A test which involves filtering, is, in my\r\nopinion, entirely unsuited for everyday use on the cooking platform.\r\n\r\nI have used the hydrometer for testing pulp and catsup direct from the\r\nkettle for seven years, and have had more success with this method than\r\nwith any other.\r\n\r\nThe hydrometer was never intended to be used with semi-solid substances\r\nsuch as tomato pulp, but only with liquids such as brine, sugar syrup,\r\netc., in which there is no solid matter in suspension. With liquids, the\r\nnumber of degrees registered on the hydrometer when it is immersed in\r\nthe liquid is equal to a definite specific gravity. This is not true\r\nwith semi-solids such as tomato pulp, as each packer must work out the\r\nrelation between the degrees of the hydrometer and the specific gravity\r\non pulp under the conditions which obtain in his plant. This is a very\r\nsimple thing to do, and once the packer has established this relation,\r\nit will hold good as long as he is in the pulp packing business. The\r\nreason why this relation is not the same for all packers is because\r\ntomato juice is not screened to the same degrees of fineness in all\r\nplants, and because all hydrometers having the same scale will not work\r\nthe same on pulp. This is because they have different shapes. The shapes\r\nmay only vary slightly, which will not interfere with their accuracy on\r\nclear liquids, but it will make a difference when the hydrometer is used\r\nin tomato pulp. Furthermore, some of the hydrometers will probably have\r\ntoo much variation in their diameter at different points, which is a\r\ndisadvantage when they are used in tomato pulp. I have therefore always\r\nhad the hydrometers which I have used for this test made to order and to\r\nconform to certain specifications which I laid down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3. Special hydrometer for testing tomato pulp and catsup.\r\n\r\n  (C. J. Tagliabue Mfg. Co.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 3 is illustrated a hydrometer which is manufactured by the C. J.\r\nTagliabue Mfg. Co. of Brooklyn, and which is made to conform to these\r\nspecifications, which are: first, perfect balance; second, a minimum\r\namount of variation in the diameter of the various parts of the spindle\r\nwith the slope very gradual; third, a Beaume scale reading from 0 to 50\r\ndegrees; fourth, that it can be obtained in exact duplicate in any\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nIf the diameter at various points in the spindle is slight, with the\r\nslope very gradual, it seems to be an advantage. It is, of course,\r\nnecessary that exact duplicates can be obtained to use when the first\r\none, on which your calculations are based, is broken.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid disappointments which would be very apt to result from\r\nthe use of a hydrometer which was not particularly adapted to this test,\r\nand which would very likely be difficult of exact duplication, the type\r\nillustrated above should be adhered to, and it will be found to give\r\ngood results when used as directed in this chapter.\r\n\r\nTwo pulps of the same specific gravity, and of practically the same\r\ndegree of fineness, if tested hot, will register the same on the same\r\nhydrometer, or on two hydrometers which are exactly alike in every\r\nrespect. (The hydrometer does not work well on cold pulp unless the pulp\r\nis thin.)\r\n\r\nTwo pulps of the same specific gravity, showing a very marked difference\r\nin their degree of fineness, will not register the same on the same\r\nhydrometer, because, even though a definite volume of each will weigh\r\nthe same, the two pulps are of different thicknesses, which will have an\r\neffect on the degree to which the hydrometer will sink when placed in\r\nthe pulp. However, if a packer cyclones his tomatoes before condensing\r\nthem, and uses the same mesh of wire screen in his cyclone all the time,\r\nhis pulp will all be of the same degree of fineness, and this point is\r\neliminated. Every pulp packer who cyclones his tomatoes, and who uses\r\nthe same mesh of screen in his cyclone throughout the season, can use\r\nthe hydrometer for testing his pulp and can obtain uniformity without\r\nthe use of any complex apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe relation between the hydrometer reading and the desired specific\r\ngravity is arrived at as follows:\r\n\r\nWhen the boiling pulp approaches the finishing point, pour a sample into\r\na tall gallon measure and take the hydrometer reading immediately. Save\r\nthis sample, put it through the finishing machine along with several\r\nadditional gallons dipped from the kettle so as to get a good sized\r\nsample through the finisher, taking care that the brushes are dry so as\r\nnot to dilute the sample, and have the specific gravity determined on\r\nthis finished sample when it gets cold. Take other samples from the\r\nkettle at five-minute intervals, and save them for the same purpose,\r\nafter getting the hydrometer reading. We will say that one of these\r\nsamples, when tested for specific gravity, ran 1.035. The packer looks\r\nup the hydrometer reading he got on this sample, when taken hot from the\r\nkettle, and finds the reading was 18 degrees. He then knows that for\r\npulp of the degree of fineness he gets from his cyclone, 18 degrees on\r\nhis hydrometer equals specific gravity 1.035 after finishing. He may\r\nalso find that for the sample that was taken from the kettle five\r\nminutes later, specific gravity 1.04 is equivalent to 24 degrees under\r\nthe same conditions. He now has established a relation between the\r\ndegrees on his hydrometer and the actual specific gravity. (The reason\r\nfor putting the pulp through a finisher before determining the specific\r\ngravity is that he wants to make this test under the same conditions\r\nthat the buyer would make it.)\r\n\r\nNow, if the packer decides that he wants to condense his season’s run of\r\npulp to 1.035, he simply cooks it all to 18 degrees on his hydrometer,\r\nproviding this is the comparison he got. Under his conditions he may\r\nfind that 16 or 20 degrees equals specific gravity 1.035. As stated\r\nbefore, each packer must determine this for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Method of Using Hydrometer\r\n\r\nThe cook should fill a tall gallon measure with the boiling pulp and\r\nallow the spindle to sink into it slowly. Do not drop it into the pulp\r\nso that it will fall suddenly, as the weight of the mercury or shot in\r\nthe bottom will carry it farther than it should go. It will be noticed\r\nthat the spindle will sink rapidly for a few seconds and then almost\r\ncome to a standstill. At this point—when a standstill is almost\r\nreached—the reading should be taken. It requires quite a little time to\r\nreach an absolute standstill, and this is not necessary, as it is easy,\r\nwith a little practice, to catch the other point and take the reading.\r\nAfter the reading is taken, lift out the spindle, stir the pulp with it,\r\nand allow it to sink again as a check determination, merely for the\r\nsatisfaction of being doubly sure. You will find that you get the same\r\nreading unless you wait so long before making the check determination\r\nthat the sample has had a chance to cool considerably. As the test only\r\ntakes ten seconds, the two tests can be made in a half minute at the\r\nmost, which gives the pulp no chance to cool.\r\n\r\nThe hydrometer method is not absolutely fool proof, but it is as near\r\nfool proof as anything I know of. Neither is it the acme of perfection\r\nin a pulp testing method, but it is, in my opinion, far better than\r\nanything that has been suggested to date. It is simple, and accurate\r\nenough for all practical purposes, and any ordinary laborer can be shown\r\nin a few minutes how to make the test, and the chances of error are very\r\nsmall indeed.\r\n\r\nThis method will not work where crushed tomatoes are being condensed. It\r\nis necessary that the tomato juice be previously cycloned. The pulp must\r\nbe homogeneous and not lumpy and full of skins to be capable of being\r\ntested by the direct hydrometer method. When determining the finishing\r\npoint on crushed tomatoes it is best to use either the eye or the\r\nspecific gravity test by weighing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Finishing the Cooking\r\n\r\nThe steam should be kept on the kettle continuously until the batch is\r\ndone. While testing is being done it is not necessary to shut off the\r\nsteam. If salt is used it should be scattered over the batch slowly a\r\nfew minutes before it is done. Salt increases the specific gravity, and\r\nalso the hydrometer reading. The relation between the hydrometer reading\r\nand the specific gravity can be worked out just as well where salt is\r\nused as when it is not used.\r\n\r\nThe addition of salt does add to the flavor, and some buyers prefer it,\r\nwhile others do not. I have seen buyers pick out a poor quality pulp\r\nwith salt in it in preference to a much better quality with no salt.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the steam valve is closed the exhaust should be opened to\r\ndischarge the steam from the coil or jacket and allow it to cool as\r\nquickly as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is often necessary to hold batches in the cooking kettles for some\r\ntime after the cooking is finished. This darkens the pulp some, both\r\nbecause of contact with the air, while hot, and from long contact with\r\nthe sides of the kettle or coil, which remain hot. Cooked pulp should\r\ntherefore be discharged from the kettle just as soon as possible. If\r\nheld over 30 minutes in the kettle it should be given a momentary boil\r\nbefore letting it down. Be careful to avoid contamination in the kettle\r\nafter the steam is shut off, such as cold dirty water dripping in from\r\nrafters overhead, and leaks from pipes over the kettles through which\r\ncold tomato juice is flowing. Such material will not become sterilized\r\nmerely by contact with the hot pulp, and may cause swells in the canned\r\nproduct if there is very much of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\nCONVEYING THE CONDENSED, STRAINED, OR CRUSHED TOMATOES TO THE FINISHING\r\n                       MACHINE AND FINISHING SAME\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Conveying to Finisher\r\n\r\nThe fewer pipes and receiving tanks the condensed pulp passes through\r\nbefore being filled in the cans, the better. All of this conveying and\r\nfinishing equipment offers possibilities of contamination, and allows\r\nthe cooked pulp to cool to some extent before it is filled. Eliminate as\r\nmuch equipment as possible between the cooking kettle and the filler,\r\nand have the pulp enter the cans at at least 170 degrees F., and if\r\npossible, at 180 degrees or above. A receiving tank between the cooking\r\nkettles and the filler should be dispensed with if possible, and the\r\nfinishing machine draw the cooked pulp direct from the kettle by means\r\nof a short line of enamel lined pipe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Receiving Tanks\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the arrangement of many plants is such that it is almost\r\nnecessary to use a receiving tank; at least in such cases it would be a\r\ndisadvantage not to have one. Where a tank must be used here it should\r\nbe in such a position that it is easily accessible, so that it will not\r\nbe necessary for a man to be an acrobat to get into it, inspect it, and\r\nsee that it is kept clean, and that an inch of pulp is not allowed to\r\nlie in it and get cold while waiting for another batch to come down.\r\n\r\nThe best kind of a tank for this purpose is an enamel or glass-lined\r\ntank with a rounded, tapering bottom so that it will almost drain itself\r\ncompletely, and what little adheres to the sides can be scraped down in\r\na few seconds if it is necessary to wait five or ten minutes for a\r\nfresh, hot batch to come down. Even if it isn’t scraped at all it will\r\nprobably not cause any trouble in a tank like this. Wooden tanks will\r\ndo, of course, but it would pay a packer who must use a tank here to\r\nthrow out his wooden one and put in a tank such as is recommended above.\r\nIt is hard to construct a wooden tank so that it will drain well; in\r\nfact, nine out of ten scarcely drain themselves at all; they are never\r\nkept as clean as they should be, and wet wood seems to be a favorite\r\nspot for molds to grow, so that frequent scrubbing is necessary if it is\r\nkept sanitary. It is most important to inspect the receiving tank\r\ncarefully before it is first used in the morning, as they sometimes mold\r\nslightly over night, or dirt falls into them from overhead. A steam hose\r\nshould be kept close to a wooden tank to sterilize it at night after it\r\nis scrubbed out.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Finishing\r\n\r\nWhether or not a receiving tank is used, the finishing machine should be\r\nas close to the cooking kettles as possible, and should receive constant\r\nattention from a careful operator who can comprehend to some degree the\r\nimportance of keeping it clean. If the filling department gets ahead of\r\nthe cooking department and is obliged to wait fifteen minutes or a half\r\nhour for a fresh batch of pulp to come down, the man who tends to the\r\nfinisher should take it apart at once, wash it off, steam it off\r\nthoroughly with the steam hose, and put it together again so that it\r\nwill be clean and practically sterile when it receives the next batch.\r\nOtherwise the screen and the brushes will be clogged up with cold pulp\r\nwhen the fresh batch comes down, which is a bad condition, especially if\r\nthe pulp is not to be sterilized after it is filled, which is usually\r\nthe case with 5–gal. pulp. Even though the finisher is operated\r\ncontinuously through the day, it should be taken apart and cleaned at\r\nleast twice during the morning and twice during the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe finishing machine should be operated slowly, so that the pumice will\r\ncome out dry. The small receiving box under the finisher should drain\r\ncompletely so that it does not have a foot of cold pulp lying in it when\r\nthe finisher is idle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Screen Metal for Finisher\r\n\r\nThe best kind of screen for the finisher is made of monel metal. The\r\nbrass screen is more common; however, the same thing can be had in monel\r\nmetal, and it does not offer the opportunity for metallic contamination\r\nthat the brass screen does. The monel metal screens wear very well and\r\nhave proven themselves to be satisfactory in every respect. Aluminum\r\nshould not be used, as it is eaten up by the tomato acid and will not\r\nlast long.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Effect of Finishing on Mold Count\r\n\r\nThe opinion has often been expressed that the brushing of the pulp\r\nthrough the fine meshes of the screen breaks up the small clumps of mold\r\nand scatters them in small threads throughout the mass, thus increasing\r\nthe mold count, since this count is not based on the total quantity of\r\nmold present, but upon the number of microscopic fields containing\r\nmolds. Thus, by scattering the mold, instead of allowing it to be\r\nretained in comparatively large clumps, the number of microscopic fields\r\ncontaining mold threads would be increased.\r\n\r\nAlthough one might reasonably expect this to take place, experiments\r\nhave proven that it does not take place. Several years ago, in order to\r\ndetermine this point, I analyzed thirty batches of catsup just before\r\nentering the finisher and again just after coming through the finisher.\r\nIn every case the percentage of microscopic fields containing molds\r\nafter finishing was practically the same as before finishing. A\r\ncone-shaped finisher with three revolving brushes and fine mesh screen\r\nwas used for this test.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Finishing Before Cooking\r\n\r\nAlthough the finishing machine, if properly tended to, is probably\r\nresponsible for very little of the spoilage in pulp, it has been\r\nsuggested to use the finisher before the pulp is condensed. Then the\r\npulp can be drawn direct from the kettle to the cans, and the chance of\r\ncontamination and cooling in the finisher can be eliminated. This idea\r\nis well worth experimenting with, as the pulp could be filled at almost\r\nthe boiling point. I have not tried out this idea, but offer it here as\r\na possibility which has advantages which are well worth looking into.\r\nPackers who are having spoilage trouble which they cannot attribute to\r\nother causes would do well to experiment with it. As to whether both the\r\npulp machine and finisher would have to be used before the cooking, or\r\nwhether the finisher alone would do, providing the tomatoes were\r\npreviously crushed, or cooked in a “breaking tank,” would have to be\r\ndetermined by experiment. The method may be in use now by some packers;\r\nhowever, I have not heard of it being used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n        FILLING THE FINISHED PULP AND STORING THE CANNED PRODUCT\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Filling Devices for Five Gallons\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used containers for pulp are the five-gallon can, the\r\nNo. 10 and the No. 1 can.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of filling 5–gal. cans is to draw the pulp from the\r\nfinishing machine by means of a large, heavy wall, single line hose\r\nfilling one can at a time. Some packers use a manifold by which five\r\ncans can be filled at once. This requires a lot of valves and enamel\r\nlined pipe fittings, and unless the operator is very expert the manifold\r\nwill not do the work any faster than a single line hose.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Square Can and Round Can\r\n\r\nThe square 5–gal. can is preferred by nearly all packers to the round\r\ncan. The round can is hard to handle, hard to stack, and is very\r\nwasteful of space wherever it is stacked. The square can is to be\r\npreferred in every way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Testing for Leaks\r\n\r\nWhen new cans are being used it shouldn’t be taken for granted that they\r\nare absolutely free from leaks, as it is sometimes found that a large\r\npercentage of a car of cans will run bad, and the packer should test\r\nrepresentative samples from the car as soon as it is received, so that\r\nhe can reject it and secure other cans if the car doesn’t test up right.\r\nThe best way to do this testing is with a small tank of water, a\r\none-eighth inch air line, giving about four pounds pressure, and a can\r\ntester. A simple kind of can tester can be easily constructed in any\r\nblacksmith shop, and merely consists of an iron brace to fit around the\r\ncan and which can be quickly tightened over the can and released, and a\r\nsoft rubber semi-circle to fit tightly into the cap hole and which is\r\ngripped at the top and held in place by one side of the brace. The\r\none-eighth inch brass air pipe passes through the center of the rubber\r\nsemi-circle and into the can. As soon as the can is tightly clamped and\r\nthe cap hole sealed by the rubber, the air is turned on and the can is\r\nimmersed in the water. The leaks show up very quickly under a four-pound\r\npressure, and a dozen cans can be tested in as many minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Washing and Steaming\r\n\r\nNew cans, as well as old ones, should be thoroughly washed and steamed\r\nbefore filling. There is often a fine, light colored dust in new cans\r\nwhich a good strong spray of water properly directed into the inverted\r\ncans will remove. Through the same pipe which directs the spray of water\r\ninto the cans, the cans can be steamed by means of a simple arrangement\r\nof valves on the steam and water pipes. A washing and steaming rack can\r\neasily be fitted up which will wash and steam a half dozen cans at once.\r\nA single stream of water entering the cap hole of the inverted can is\r\nnot sufficient to clean it. The pipe which enters the cap hole should be\r\ncapped, and about three holes drilled into this cap at a slight slant so\r\nthat the upward spray of water will strike three different spots in the\r\nbottom of the inverted can, and make the washing thorough.\r\n\r\nIf the average packer could see just how little of the inside surface of\r\nhis 5–gal. cans is actually washed, he would be surprised. About fifteen\r\nseconds is sufficient time to spray the inside of the cans, and then the\r\nwater valve can be closed and the steam valve turned on. The steam\r\nshould be kept on for a full minute and kept on strong. The idea is not\r\nmerely to heat the can but to sterilize it, at least to some degree,\r\nbefore the pulp is admitted. The average employee steaming 5–gal. cans\r\nleaves the steam on ten seconds at the most, and often not more than\r\nthree seconds. Such a short steaming does very little good. The space of\r\ntime between the steaming and filling should be just as short as\r\npossible. The employees should not be permitted to keep a half dozen\r\ncans steamed ahead all the time so that they are cold by the time the\r\npulp enters them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Filling and Capping\r\n\r\nAs stated in the previous chapter, the temperature of the pulp when it\r\nis filled should be at least 170 degrees F. and preferably above 180\r\ndegrees. The cans should be filled clear to the top with the pipe or\r\nhose which conducts the hot pulp from the finisher; they should not be\r\ntopped off out of a dipper which contains luke warm pulp and is used for\r\ntopping purposes. It is not necessary to do this topping and the\r\npractice should not be permitted. The sponges which are used for wiping\r\nthe edges of the cap hole should be kept in a bucket of clean, hot\r\nwater, and put back in the bucket after being used on a truckload of\r\ncans. The capping and tipping job should undergo inspection before the\r\ncans are trucked away.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Handling Filled Cans\r\n\r\nCans of filled pulp should be handled carefully. The cans should be set\r\ndown easily, so as to strain the seams as little as possible. Of course\r\nthe laborer wants to let go of cans of red-hot pulp just as quickly as\r\npossible, but it is not necessary to drop them several inches, and the\r\nemployees should be taught to set the can on edge and then let its\r\nweight straighten it up. If the employee is given good thick gloves it\r\nis just as easy to handle the cans carefully. I had occasion at one time\r\nto check up on the percentage of swells resulting from one pile of pulp\r\nwhich was stacked by an old hand who knew how to handle pulp easily and\r\ncarefully, and another pile from the same day’s run which was stacked by\r\na gang of new and uninstructed help who simply picked the cans off the\r\ntruck and dropped them in place. These were second-hand cans, and the\r\ndifference was considerable.\r\n\r\nBoth filled cans and empty cans should be handled almost like eggs. One\r\nlarge pulp packing concern is particularly cautious about this, and it\r\nis certainly soothing to the nerves to see their employees handling\r\n5–gal. cans after witnessing the rough and tumble methods in the average\r\nplant. They know that it pays to be particular, and that they can get\r\nthree years’ use out of almost all of their 135–lb. plate cans, and not\r\nhave many swells either. This concern rarely sells any of their pulp,\r\nbut puts it up for their own use, to be made into bean sauce, catsup,\r\nsoup, etc., during the winter months.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Advantages of Separating Batches\r\n\r\nSome packers stack their pulp away without dating it; others date each\r\nday’s run; while others stack each batch separately. The latter system\r\nis practicable where the pulp is cooked in large batches of about 300\r\ngallons or more and in working up the pulp during the winter months it\r\nis a great help. For instance, suppose part of the pulp is to be used\r\nfor catsup and part for bean sauce. The packer can take batches one to\r\nfifty, for example, open one can from each batch, examine it for color\r\nand microscopical analysis and he knows exactly what he has in that\r\nstack of pulp, which may be three thousand cans. He can select the\r\nvarious batches to be used for the purpose to which they are best\r\nadapted, and he can be absolutely sure that each can in a batch is\r\nexactly the same in every respect.\r\n\r\nTake another example: We will say that the packer is selling his pulp.\r\nHis records show that on September 20th and on October 2nd, for\r\ninstance, he had a lot of bad tomatoes; shipments received on those days\r\nwere unavoidably held up and he had to make the best of the situation.\r\nHe knows, however, that on those same dates he had a lot of good\r\ntomatoes which came in by wagon haul and that they were run up at the\r\nsame time. He has a large order for pulp from a catsup maker who is very\r\nparticular about the microscopical analysis of the goods he buys. In\r\norder to play absolutely safe, the packer can take a sample from each\r\nbatch of the pulp run on September 20th and October 2nd, and if a half\r\ndozen batches run too high he can omit them when he makes the shipment\r\nto this buyer. If he preserved a sample from each batch run on these\r\ndates at the time they were run, which is the better way, it makes the\r\nsorting out of this pulp a very easy matter. He thus eliminates the\r\ndanger of the loss of a good buyer by sending him even a comparatively\r\nsmall quantity of pulp which is high in micro-organisms.\r\n\r\nIt may seem to one who has never tried it that stacking each batch of\r\npulp separately would involve an awful lot of extra labor, and loss of\r\nvaluable space when stacking. As a matter of fact, it involves no extra\r\nlabor at all and no extra space. I have had a season’s pack of pulp\r\namounting to 75,000 5–gal. cans at one plant and cooked in batches of\r\n300 gallons each, stacked each batch separate and it was no trouble at\r\nall. The inspector who examined the tipping and capping job, or the\r\ntipper, if the inspecting was done by him, merely took a fine stiff\r\nbrush and a marking pot and marked the batch number on the cap of each\r\ncan. This only takes a half minute for a truck load. The date was not\r\nmarked on the can, as a record of the batch numbers run on each date\r\nduring the season was kept at the office. When the pulp was piled away\r\neach batch was stacked together, and where one batch left off and\r\nanother one began a slip of wood was inserted between two of the cans.\r\n\r\nOn days when the tomatoes are running bad, or there is a scarcity of\r\nhelp for the sorting belt, it is wise to preserve a sample from each\r\nbatch and have an analysis made of it for reference when the pulp is\r\nshipped out. On days when a good grade of tomatoes are being run it is\r\nhardly necessary to analyze every batch, but a sample of about every\r\nthird batch can be taken.\r\n\r\nStacking each day’s run separate is, of course, better than no\r\nseparation at all. However, there are not many days when the entire run\r\nwill have a similar analysis; the best becomes inseparably mixed up with\r\nthe worst, and when the pulp is worked up the packer is working in the\r\ndark. To stack a season’s run away without any system of separating\r\nvarious divisions of it is the worst kind of folly, and is almost sure\r\nto lead to trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              How to Stack\r\n\r\nWhen the pulp is stacked away a space of at least an inch should be left\r\nbetween each can to allow the air to circulate and prevent stack\r\nburning. If this is not done, a pile of pulp may hold the heat for a\r\nweek or ten days, and the pulp, particularly that on the inside, will\r\nbecome brown or even black, due to the long exposure to the heat. The\r\nquicker the pulp can be cooled, the more the bright red color of the\r\ntomato will be retained.\r\n\r\nThe height to which the pulp is stacked depends upon the heaviness of\r\nthe plate of which the can is made, and also, of course, upon the weight\r\nthe floor of the warehouse is able to stand. As a rule it is not wise to\r\npack 5–gal. cans of 107–lb. plate over four high, and not over five high\r\nfor cans of 135–lb. plate. Dry, sheltered storage should be provided for\r\npulp, and it will be found to pay in the end. Exposure to the elements\r\nis very hard on the cans, and alternate freezing and thawing of the pulp\r\nis a great strain on the seams of the can. A comparison of the leaks and\r\nswells on pulp stored in shelter, and that stored in the open, will\r\nconvince the packer that it pays to construct dry storage space.\r\n\r\nNarrow aisleways should be provided for between the stacked pulp so that\r\nit can be frequently inspected for leaks and swells. By pulling out a\r\nleaker in time, several other cans are prevented from becoming leakers,\r\nas the leaking pulp from one can will run down on several others, and\r\nthe pulp, in connection with the oxygen of the air, will eat through the\r\ntin plate, causing rust spots, and then pin holes. Frequent inspection\r\nof the pulp pile and pulling out cans when they are just beginning to\r\nleak or swell will save the packer a lot of money.\r\n\r\nCans should not be stacked on thin boards which will leave the surface\r\nof the can close to the ground, as the moisture of the ground will\r\nquickly rust the tin. It almost seems foolish to mention such a point,\r\nbut much pulp is stacked this way and the entire bottom layer when\r\nturned up will be moldy and rusty on one side. The surface of the can\r\nshould be at least two inches from the ground. Lacquering will help\r\nsome, but will not prevent rusting if the cans are close to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Processing\r\n\r\nNothing has up to this point been said about the processing of 5–gal.\r\npulp. Very few packers process their pulp, and many unprocessed packs\r\nhave been put up that have not shown over 1 per cent of leaks and swells\r\nwhere new cans were used and the various manufacturing processes were\r\ncarried out as they should be. In many cases a long shipment of such\r\npulp, after having been stored in a sheltered place for several months,\r\nhas produced very few additional swells.\r\n\r\nOne large packer of pulp has for years given his 5–gal. cans a 30–minute\r\nprocess in boiling water, having them pass slowly through a boiling\r\nwater bath on a chain carrier, the speed of which is regulated so as to\r\ngive each can the required time in bath. The cans are placed on the\r\nchain as soon as they are capped and tipped. Although this packer is\r\nvery careful in his manufacturing methods he processes as a matter of\r\ninsurance, principally because a great deal of his pulp is shipped long\r\ndistances. He must figure that it pays him or he wouldn’t keep it up, as\r\nthe processing involves quite a little extra handling and extra\r\nequipment, and of course has a tendency to darken the pulp somewhat.\r\n\r\nThirty minutes at boiling temperature is, of course, not sufficient time\r\nto bring the center of the can near the boiling point, but it will\r\nsterilize the can itself and that portion of the pulp which is near the\r\noutside. If the pulp is filled very hot, that portion of it which is in\r\nthe center of the can, being the last to cool, should practically\r\nsterilize itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Life of Cans\r\n\r\nWhere a packer puts up pulp in 5–gal. cans for his own use during the\r\nwinter months he ought to be able to get two years’ use out of all of\r\nhis cans, and three years out of a large percentage of them. It is\r\nquestionable whether it is ever advisable to use a can over three\r\nseasons. One reaches a point where the percentage of swells is so large\r\nwith old cans that the saving of the cans is unprofitable. When a new\r\ncan is first used, the year should be indelibly stamped on the can, so\r\nthat at any time the packer can go through his stock of used cans and\r\ntell how many seasons’ use each can has had. This will prove a help in\r\nmaking a decision on which cans are worth holding over for another\r\nseason, and which ones are not. It also gives him a line on the kind of\r\ncan that gives him the most value for his money.\r\n\r\nEnamel lined cans are now being used a great deal, and as a rule they\r\nseem to give a little better service than the plain tin, although this\r\nis not always the case. Some packers think the enamel imparts a very\r\nslight foreign taste to the pulp, but I have never been able to detect\r\nit. Enameling or lacquering of the outside of the cans is essential if\r\nthere is not sufficient sheltered storage for the pulp, or if it must be\r\nstacked in a damp warehouse. An excessive amount of moisture in the air\r\nwill quickly start the tin to rusting on plain cans, and many cannery\r\nwarerooms are entirely too moist for stacking cans, as they are near the\r\nprocess room, and the air is often misty with the presence of condensing\r\nsteam from the process tanks. If there is ample dry storage space, the\r\noutside enameling of the cans does not seem to be an advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Washing and Drying Cans\r\n\r\nWhen the season’s pack of pulp is being worked up, the cans which are to\r\nbe saved for another season’s use should be thoroughly washed out in a\r\ntub with hot water. Spraying devices will not work, as the top of the\r\ncan will probably have a layer of pulp stuck to it, due to the receding\r\nof the pulp in the can when it cooled, and even a heavy spray will not\r\nremove all of this. The cans must be partially filled with hot water and\r\nshaken hard to properly clean them. The foreman should inspect the\r\nwashed cans at frequent intervals by means of a small electric light\r\nwhich is wired to a short rod and which can easily be inserted in the\r\ncan through the cap hole. If the washing is not thoroughly done this\r\nwill show it up quickly.\r\n\r\nAfter as much of the water as possible is shaken out of the cans they\r\nshould be put in a drying oven and left over night. In the morning the\r\ncans should be thoroughly dry if sufficient steam is kept in the oven\r\nradiators. The oven is made with a partition which divides it into two\r\nparts, and one part can be filled with the wet cans while the other side\r\nis being emptied of the dry cans.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Protection From Dust\r\n\r\nAfter the cans are dried, a pasteboard insert should be placed in the\r\ncap holes to keep the dust out of them while they are in storage during\r\nthe winter and spring. One of the can companies at least, supplies these\r\npasteboard inserts or inverted caps with their cans, and they fit snugly\r\ninto the cap hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Testing Used Cans\r\n\r\nBefore the old cans are used the following year they should all be\r\ntested for pin hole leaks and the leaks patched up. They should then be\r\nre-tested and not used until they are shown to be tight under air\r\npressure when immersed in water. This can be done during the spring and\r\nsummer months, and the packer can then be reasonably sure that his old\r\ncans are in good shape for the next season’s run. If the cans are very\r\nold and the seams are very rusty, new pin holes will be opened up every\r\ntime air pressure is put in them. Such cans should, of course, be thrown\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Packing 10’s and 1’s\r\n\r\nPulp packed in No. 10 and No. 1 cans is usually filled with a rotary\r\nfilling machine, although No. 10’s are often filled from a single line\r\npipe and the filling can be done quite rapidly where the operator is\r\nexpert at the job. If it is necessary to top any of the cans, it should\r\nbe done from a small jacketed kettle which is connected up near the\r\nfiller, so that the pulp used for topping can be kept hot. The cans\r\nshould be put through a can washer and steamer before filling.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 pulp should have a much larger call from the consumer than it has,\r\nand it could be made very popular if a high standard of quality was set\r\nand maintained, and the advantage of its use advertised to the\r\nhousewife. Many consumers who have purchased the small size pulp or\r\npuree for use in making tomato sauce, spaghetti, tomato soup, etc., have\r\nbeen disappointed in the quality, and after one trial have gone back to\r\ncanned tomatoes for these purposes.\r\n\r\nFor No. 10’s a process in boiling water of 40 minutes in the old style\r\nstraight process tank is usually considered sufficient; this is to be\r\nfollowed by a very gradual cooling in water so that the cans will not\r\nbuckle badly. For the No. 1 size a 20–minute process in boiling water is\r\nsufficient. It is always well to cool the cans about ten minutes so they\r\nwill not retain the heat a great length of time. A better color and\r\nflavor can be maintained if the goods are cooled in water after\r\nprocessing. If a continuous agitating cooker is used for processing the\r\nlengths of time given above can be cut down at least 60 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Packing Barrel Pulp\r\n\r\nBarrel pulp is scarcely being packed any more, as the barrel has shown\r\nitself to be unfit for pulp which is packed without preservative. The\r\nuse of barrels today is usually only resorted to in emergency cases when\r\ncans for the purpose are not available. If the pulp is to undergo long\r\nstorage and shipment, or any great amount of handling, barrel goods will\r\nusually show quite a big loss, not only because much of the pulp is\r\nspoiled so that the spoilage is evident at once upon inspection, but\r\nbecause of the growth of yeasts and bacteria in the pulp while it has\r\nbeen in storage, and because of loss of color due to the action of air\r\nseeping into the barrel. Wooden barrels as a rule are not absolutely air\r\ntight, and it is hard to make them so.\r\n\r\nI have packed pulp in good uncharred whisky barrels, using 5 lbs. of\r\nsalt to the barrel, and rolled the barrels to a sheltered place where\r\nthey would not be disturbed until they were ready to open, and after two\r\nor three months’ storage the pulp was all right. If this pulp had been\r\nmoved, or held until a spell of warm weather came on, it is doubtful if\r\nit would have shown up so well. The barrels should be washed out well\r\nand steamed for about five minutes before being filled, and the bungs\r\nshould be burlapped.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Metal Drums\r\n\r\nIngot iron drums, such as are used for shipping oil, have been\r\nrecommended for tomato pulp and I have tried them, but they will not do,\r\nas the tomato acid dissolves too much of the iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 A Method of Preserving Pulp in Barrels\r\n\r\nAs a method of preserving pulp in barrels one packer for a number of\r\nyears put hydrochloric acid in it. This, being a strong acid, is also\r\nquite a good preservative, and evidently kept the pulp in good shape.\r\nWhen the pulp was worked up, enough bicarbonate of soda was added to\r\nneutralize this acid, and the result of the neutralization was sodium\r\nchloride, or common salt. There evidently could be no objection made to\r\nthis from a pure food standpoint, as none of the acid was left in the\r\npulp after the neutralization, and sodium chloride is a common\r\ningredient of pulp. However, the process darkened the pulp, which was an\r\nobjection. As to whether or not the flavor was impaired by this\r\ntreatment I do not know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n THE MICRO-ORGANISMS OF TOMATO PRODUCTS; THE ATTITUDE OF THE PURE FOOD\r\n      AUTHORITIES TOWARD THEM; AND THE INTERPRETATION OF ANALYSES\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Micro-Organisms; What They Are\r\n\r\nBy micro-organisms we mean molds, yeasts, bacteria, and their spores.\r\nThe term “micro-organisms” takes in all of these.\r\n\r\nThis chapter will deal with the subject in as short and concise a manner\r\nas possible, with the object of giving the manufacturer a working\r\nknowledge of it that will help him in his everyday factory routine.\r\nAlthough volumes have been written about micro-organisms in food, it is\r\nnot necessary for the packer of tomato products to have an accurate,\r\ndetailed scientific knowledge of the subject in all its ramifications,\r\nbut a general understanding of it will suffice for practically all\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nWhat are molds, yeasts, spores, and bacteria? Are they animals or\r\nplants? Where do they grow, and under what conditions do they multiply\r\nmost rapidly? Are they harmful, or are the kinds found in tomatoes all\r\nharmless varieties? If they are harmless, why does the government object\r\nto them? Why is a product containing a certain number considered all\r\nright, while when a larger number is present the product is said by the\r\ngovernment to consist in whole or in part of a filthy, decomposed,\r\nputrid vegetable substance? Aren’t such foods as Roquefort cheese,\r\ncottage cheese, buttermilk, and sauerkraut fairly swarming with the same\r\nkinds of germs as tomato pulp? Aren’t these foods all considered\r\nhealthful? Then why object to these germs in tomato pulp? Aren’t the\r\ngerms all killed by the boiling, anyway? These are questions often asked\r\nby pulp packers, and it is hoped that the following will throw some\r\nlight on the subject.\r\n\r\nMolds, yeasts, spores, and bacteria are very tiny plants, not animals.\r\nThey are so small that they can only be seen by the naked eye when there\r\nare very large masses of them together, consisting, in the case of\r\nbacteria and yeasts, of hundreds of millions of small individual plants,\r\nand in the case of molds, of many individual mold plants closely massed\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nYou have all seen large tufts of white mold on tomatoes, and black mold\r\ncovering a loaf of bread, but you probably did not realize the enormous\r\nnumbers of individual mold plants that were present, or the rapidity\r\nwith which they multiplied themselves. You have all seen swelled cans of\r\ntomato pulp, and after the cans were opened you have noticed the bubbles\r\nrising in the pulp, and have noted the very sour taste and often an\r\nextremely disagreeable odor. In every thimbleful of that sour pulp there\r\nwere hundreds of millions of bacteria and yeast cells, so small in size\r\nthat many thousand could collect at the same time on the point of a pin\r\nand they would not be noticed by the naked eye. It was these tiny\r\nbacteria and yeast plants which caused the physical and chemical changes\r\nin that pulp. Just as a parasitic vine winds itself around a tree and\r\nsucks the life out of it, so these millions of bacteria and yeast plants\r\nsucked all the goodness out of this tomato pulp, and left nothing but\r\nsour, decomposed tomato fiber, acid, and foul-smelling gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Molds\r\n\r\nThe structure of the mold plant is similar to that of a very small vine,\r\nthe branches of which are many and are closely massed together. The tiny\r\nthreads or filaments of mold resemble the vine and its branches. These\r\nthreads keep sending out new shoots which spread rapidly all over the\r\nsurface the mold is growing on, and the fruit of the mold plant, which\r\nis called spores, is similar to the little berries which grow at the\r\nends of the branches of a vine. These berries are the fruit of the vine;\r\nspores are the fruit of the mold plant. Just as the berries contain\r\nseeds which reproduce the plant, so the tiny spores contain the seed\r\nwhich will reproduce the mold plant. These spores grow at the end of the\r\nmold threads or branches, and when ripe, either fall on the surface\r\ndirectly beneath, or are carried away by a breath of air and move along\r\nwith the dust.\r\n\r\nThe spores of the mold plant will remain alive for months in a dry\r\nstate, floating in the air, or if the air be very still, falling to the\r\nsurface. The air everywhere is full of them, and as soon as they light\r\nupon a moist surface, such as tomato juice, for example, which contains\r\nnourishment for them, they begin to send out shoots of mold threads and\r\nreproduce another mold plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 4.—Mold filament from catsup. (×150.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nMold grows most rapidly upon a warm surface, preferably about the\r\ntemperature of the human body. It will not grow on a surface which is at\r\nfreezing temperature, or on a very hot surface. Under these extremes of\r\ntemperature it is unable to multiply itself. Boiling kills the mold\r\nplant, and continued boiling of 15 minutes or more also kills the seeds\r\nor spores of practically all species. That is one reason why it is\r\ndesirable to bring peeled tomatoes or tomato juice to a boil as soon as\r\npossible—so that the mold and mold spores which are always on these\r\nsurfaces will be killed before they have an opportunity to grow.\r\n\r\nThere are many different species or varieties of mold plants which\r\nthrive on tomatoes and tomato pulp, but they are all very similar; they\r\nreproduce themselves in exactly the same way, and they are all arrested\r\nin their growth by extremes of temperature, and are killed by continued\r\nboiling. It should not be thought, however, that boiling for a very few\r\nminutes will kill all mold spores, as they have a tough surface which\r\nhas considerable resistance to heat. I have seen 5–gal. pulp packed\r\nwhich was only given a very short boil on account of low steam pressure,\r\nand molds grew in the sealed cans after packing to such an extent that\r\nthe pulp all had to be thrown away. It is safe to assume, however, that\r\na 15–minute boil will kill mold spores and prevent the growth of molds\r\nin the cans after they are sealed, providing, of course, that the pulp\r\nis filled hot into cans which are clean and almost sterile.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Bacteria\r\n\r\nBacteria and yeasts are very much smaller plants than molds. While an\r\nindividual mold plant, growing as stated above like a very small vine,\r\nbranches out and spreads over considerable surface, bacteria (that is,\r\nthose forms in which the pulp packer is interested) are very short,\r\nsingle rods, which, when multiplied in size 500 times by the microscope,\r\nappear to be from 1/32 to ⅛ of an inch long. Yeasts, when multiplied in\r\nsize 500 times, usually appear to be from two to five times as large as\r\na pin head.\r\n\r\nThe rod-shaped bacteria referred to above are mainly the lactic acid,\r\nand acetic acid bacteria, both of which produce fermentation in tomato\r\nproducts. The lactic acid germ is the same one which causes milk to\r\nsour, while the acetic acid germ is the one which produces the acetic\r\nacid of vinegar. There are many other kinds of bacteria in tomato pulp,\r\nmany of which are small, round cells. However, the bulk of these\r\nprobably come from the soil and are natural to the tomato, and are not\r\ncounted when the number of bacteria per cubic centimeter are estimated.\r\nThe rod-shaped types indicate fermentation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 5.—Rod-shaped bacteria from tomato pulp, common in bad catsups.\r\n    (×500.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nBacteria reproduce themselves with amazing rapidity. It has been found\r\nout by watching them multiply under the microscope that under favorable\r\nconditions one germ reproduces itself every 30 minutes, and in some\r\ncases reproduction is known to have been even more rapid than that. The\r\nmethod of reproduction is by simple division. The rod-shaped bacterium\r\nis just like a match in shape, only many thousand times smaller, and in\r\nthe space of about 30 minutes it will divide itself in the middle, thus\r\nchanging itself into two shorter rods. Each of these rods grows in\r\nlength, and each of them then divides, making four rods. In 30 minutes\r\nmore the four rods change into eight, etc. It is the simplest method of\r\nreproduction there is.\r\n\r\nBacteria also have another method of reproducing themselves which they\r\nresort to when conditions become unfavorable for their growth and they\r\ncan no longer multiply themselves by the simple division method. Such an\r\nunfavorable condition would be the drying up of the moist surface on\r\nwhich they are growing. In this case the rod-shaped bacterium forms one\r\nor more spores within itself. These bacteria spores are somewhat similar\r\nto mold spores, but are much smaller. However, they are only produced by\r\nbacteria under unfavorable conditions, while the mold plant produces\r\nthem under all conditions. The bacteria spores, like mold spores, have a\r\ntough surface which gives them high resistance, and they contain the\r\ngerm of bacteria life which can reproduce the species when favorable\r\nconditions for growth are again encountered. The bacteria spores,\r\ntherefore, float through the air as do the mold spores, remaining in the\r\ndry state without nourishment for months at a time, and as soon as they\r\nlight upon a moist surface containing the elements for growth, even to a\r\nvery small degree, they reproduce the rod-shaped bacteria form, which\r\nbegins to multiply itself again by the simple division method.\r\n\r\nAlthough most bacteria spores are killed by boiling for 10 or 15\r\nminutes, there are a few species of extremely high resistance which have\r\nbeen known to remain alive after several hours’ boiling. Spores of this\r\nnature are infrequent, however, and the packer might as well forget that\r\nthey exist. Not one case of spoilage out of a hundred is caused by the\r\npresence of such spores, and if all food products were cooked a length\r\nof time sufficient to kill all bacteria spores which might possibly be\r\npresent, the foods would be cooked to death, and unfit to eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Yeasts\r\n\r\nYeasts are very tiny individual cells, and multiply by budding, instead\r\nof by simple division, as bacteria do. Instead of the yeast cell\r\ndividing in half, thus producing two cells, it remains intact, but a bud\r\nforms on its outer surface. This bud grows in size until it becomes\r\nalmost as large as the cell which produced it, and then it separates\r\nfrom the mother cell, and we have two yeast cells. Each of these two\r\ncells then produces buds, which again separate, and so on. Like\r\nbacteria, the multiplication is very rapid under favorable conditions.\r\nFavorable conditions for yeasts and bacteria are the same as they are\r\nfor mold, that is, a warm temperature, preferably near blood heat, and a\r\nmoist substance which is not too strongly acid, and which contains the\r\nelements necessary for growth, preferably the natural sugar of fruits\r\nand vegetables.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 6.—Yeasts and spherical bacteria from decaying tomatoes. (× 500.)\r\n    [The oval bodies are the yeasts, some in budding stage; the bacteria\r\n    appear as small spheres, or pairs of spheres.]\r\n]\r\n\r\nYeasts are the principal gas-forming agents in the fermentation of pulp.\r\nIn the production of this gas they consume the natural sugar of the\r\ntomato. They will multiply by the budding method described above as long\r\nas they are in a medium which is favorable for their growth. As soon as\r\nthis medium drys up, or for some other reason becomes an unfavorable\r\nmedium for the multiplication of the yeast cells, the yeasts resort to\r\nspore forming, just as bacteria do. These spores are formed within the\r\nyeast cell, and when the cell wall breaks the spores pass off into the\r\nair. Like all other spores, they have a high resistance, and will float\r\naround in the dry state and remain alive for a very long time. When they\r\nlight upon a medium in which they can grow they reproduce the yeast\r\nspecies, in the same manner in which the bacteria spore reproduces the\r\nbacteria species from which it was derived.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Spores\r\n\r\nThe spores, then, which are found in tomato products are of three\r\ndifferent kinds, namely, mold spores, yeast spores, and bacteria spores.\r\nThe greater number are almost always mold spores, since the mold plant\r\nproduces spores under all conditions, while yeasts and bacteria only\r\nproduce them under unfavorable conditions. When microscopical analyses\r\nof tomato products are reported, the mold spores and yeast spores are\r\nincluded with the yeasts in the term “Yeasts and Spores.” This is\r\nbecause a large number of the spores are very similar to yeast cells in\r\nappearance, and as it would be a laborious process for the analyst to\r\nseparate them, the yeasts and spores are included in one figure, which\r\ngreatly simplifies the analysis. The bacteria spores are not included in\r\nthe count of “Yeasts and Spores.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                   How Germs Retard Their Own Growth\r\n\r\nWe will say that we have stacked away a 5–gal. can of pulp which\r\ncontains several living spores of bacteria, as is apt to be the case,\r\nsince the air is full of them, and the pulp is constantly open to\r\ncontamination from the air after it is cooked; also the spores may be in\r\nthe empty cans at the time they are filled. Why is it, since these few\r\nspores are alive, and in a favorable medium for their growth, that the\r\nrod-shaped bacteria forms which they produce do not multiply to such an\r\nextent that they will ferment the can of pulp. It was stated above that\r\nbacteria do not multiply in a strongly acid medium. Since the bacteria\r\nproduce acid as a by-product of their own growth, they surround\r\nthemselves with an acid medium, and they thus retard and finally stop\r\ntheir growth by the product of their own reproduction. When this acid\r\nmedium reaches a certain strength the bacteria can no longer multiply,\r\nand if that can is not moved until used, the chances are it will be all\r\nright when opened. But if the can is moved, the contents are agitated,\r\nand these living bacteria are shaken away from the acid medium in which\r\nthey have been suspended, and they are shaken into a fresh, sweet medium\r\nin which they can again begin to multiply. It may therefore follow that\r\nif this can is moved several times it would be at least partly fermented\r\nwhen opened, while if it was left alone it would have remained sweet.\r\nThis illustration shows the desirability of moving pulp as little as\r\npossible, and as carefully as possible when moving becomes imperative.\r\nThe lack of air in the can will, of course, also retard bacterial\r\ngrowth, but there is usually a small amount of air in the can, and many\r\nspecies of bacteria do not need any air whatever for their growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 7.—Mold spores and filaments. A type frequently found in decaying\r\n    tomatoes. (×300.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Rapidity of Growth\r\n\r\nYeasts and bacteria multiply more rapidly than do the molds, and that is\r\nwhy pulp which is made from tomatoes or tomato peelings which are\r\nhandled slowly or carelessly usually shows a high content of yeasts and\r\nbacteria, while the molds may be low. As a rule, most of the mold found\r\nin pulp was present in the original tomatoes, and is found in the pulp\r\nbecause it wasn’t eliminated in the sorting. But, as a rule, tomatoes\r\nare not full of yeasts and bacteria unless they are very soft and mushy,\r\nand it is evident on looking at them that they have fermented to some\r\nextent. If pulp contains a high count of yeasts or bacteria it usually\r\nmeans that this fermentation took place in the factory at some stage in\r\nthe manufacturing process, or that the product has been contaminated by\r\nfermented tomato substance lodged in pipes, troughs, and conveying\r\nequipment. Often it is due to delay in getting the tomato stock to a\r\nboil. The laxness in this regard in some factories is surprising, and\r\ntheir pulp is almost always high in yeasts and bacteria.\r\n\r\nWhen you consider the extreme rapidity with which these germs multiply,\r\nthe folly of allowing tomato peelings or tomato juice to be very slowly\r\nconveyed to a large tank for an hour or more before the steam is turned\r\non becomes apparent. Much has been written about the rapidity of\r\nbacterial reproduction, and yet extreme delay in working up tomato stock\r\ncontinues in many plants, and we frequently see bacteria counts of a\r\nhundred million or more per cubic centimeter, all of which could be\r\neasily avoided if the packer would just make up his mind to get to the\r\nbottom of the cause and apply the simple remedy.\r\n\r\nJust as an illustration we will say that we are putting up trimming\r\npulp, and the tomato receipts are rather light and the peelers are\r\nworking slowly, or that there aren’t many peelers working. The trimmings\r\nare passed along on a belt conveyor where they go to a bucket carrier\r\nand are lifted to a large cypress tank with a coil. They drop into the\r\ntank slowly, and it may take two hours for the coil to be covered so\r\nthat the steam can be turned on; or after a foot or two of the trimmings\r\nhave been put in the tank it is lunch time, and it is an hour before the\r\nfilling of the tank continues. This may make it three hours before these\r\npeelings are brought to a boil. Suppose at the time those peelings go\r\ninto the tank they contain enough bacteria so that if they were cooked\r\nat once, the pulp would run 10 million to the cubic centimeter. This is\r\nvery probable. However, they are not cooked at once and at the end of 30\r\nminutes you have peelings which, when condensed and cycloned, would show\r\nclose to 20 million bacteria. In an hour the first peelings which\r\nentered that tank would yield 40 million, and in 1½ hrs., 80 million.\r\nThis is on the basis of the bacteria reproducing themselves every 30\r\nminutes. Even if they multiply much more slowly than that you can see\r\nthat in the course of a little over an hour you are getting into\r\ndangerous ground, and in the course of two or three hours the bacteria\r\nhave multiplied to such an extent that the product would almost be sure\r\nto be condemned if it was picked up by an inspector. If the tomatoes had\r\nquite a few soft spots in them when they were peeled it is very likely\r\nthat the peelings would yield 20 million bacteria if worked up\r\nimmediately, and then if delay of an hour or more comes on top of that\r\nyou can see where you will be on the bacteria count. The yeasts are also\r\nprobably multiplying at the same time, and the molds are growing to some\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nNow what this packer should do is to put a small open steam jet in the\r\nbottom of his cypress tank, with four pipes running horizontally, as in\r\na “breaking tank,” and turn on the steam as soon as the peelings cover\r\nthese pipes, which lie right on the bottom of the tank. The peelings are\r\nthus kept at a boil until the steam can be turned on the coil, and then\r\nthe steam from the open jet can be shut off. This is a very simple\r\narrangement to make and will save no end of trouble.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that because micro-organisms multiply most\r\nrapidly in a warm medium they will not multiply in a cold medium, or one\r\nwhich is considerably warmer than blood heat—the degree of temperature\r\nmost favored. The only safe extremes are 33 degrees F. for the lower\r\nextreme, and 150 degrees F. or above for the higher extreme. Anywhere\r\nbetween these two extremes of temperature there is danger of germ\r\nactivity, and the nearer the medium is to 98 degrees F., the more rapid\r\nis the multiplication of the germs.\r\n\r\nAs tomato juice contains all the nutritive requirements for the growth\r\nof micro-organisms, and is not strongly acid, it is an ideal medium for\r\nthem to grow in. There doesn’t seem to be any medium whatever that\r\nmolds, yeasts, and bacteria prefer to tomatoes and tomato juice.\r\n\r\n\r\n               The Government Attitude on Micro-Organisms\r\n\r\nWhat are the objections of the pure food authorities to the presence of\r\nlarge numbers of micro-organisms in tomato products, and how do they\r\nsubstantiate their objections? We know that all of these germs that grow\r\nin tomato products are harmless. Even if an occasional harmful germ\r\nshould enter it would not be discovered by the method of analysis\r\nemployed, and unless it was in the spore form and of extremely high\r\nresistance it would be killed by the boiling.\r\n\r\nWe know that buttermilk and sauerkraut are full of bacteria, and that\r\nthe latter is also full of yeasts, and that these two foods are\r\nrecommended by physicians as being particularly healthful because of the\r\nlactic acid they contain, which is produced by the lactic acid\r\nbacteria—the same kind that are condemned in tomato products.\r\n\r\nIn sauerkraut we know that these lactic acid bacteria and yeasts are\r\nkilled by the cooking, just as they are in tomato products, which seems\r\nto make the two cases analogous. In buttermilk and cottage cheese,\r\nhowever, they are alive and growing, and these products are considered\r\nhealthful. Roquefort cheese is full of a green mold which gives it its\r\ncharacteristic flavor and color, and it is considered healthful. Then\r\nwhy object to molds in tomato products?\r\n\r\nThe difference is that in one case we have a controlled and regulated\r\nfermentation, which is confined to one or more species, which in\r\ncombination with the characteristic elements of that particular food\r\nproduce a healthful by-product or desirable flavor. In the other case we\r\nhave an unregulated and uncontrolled fermentation, produced by a variety\r\nof species of micro-organisms. In tomatoes we have a number of species\r\nof molds; we have a great many different species of wild yeasts, many of\r\nwhich produce by-products of a disagreeable character; and we have a\r\nnumber of species of bacteria, chief among which are the lactic acid and\r\nacetic acid types, which change the tomato pulp from a sweet product, as\r\nit should be, to a sour one.\r\n\r\nThe objections of the government are therefore more confined to the\r\nby-products which are produced by the growth of these germs than to the\r\ngerms themselves. It is the contention that the by-products produced in\r\ntomato products by many of these germs are such as to be classed as a\r\nfilthy, putrid, decomposed vegetable substance. Just how many of these\r\ngerms a product may contain before it is sufficiently decomposed to be\r\nclassed as filthy and putrid is a question. The government tries to play\r\nsafe in the matter, and give the packer a fair deal. When they condemn a\r\ntomato product as unfit for food it isn’t because it contains only an\r\naverage quantity of micro-organisms, but because the number of germs\r\npresent, and the decomposition produced, is such as to indicate extreme\r\nlaxness in sanitation and lack of care in the manufacturing processes,\r\nor the admittance of quite a large percentage of rotten material. The\r\nspoilage may be either primary or secondary, that is, it may be due to\r\nthe use of a lot of partly rotten, moldy tomatoes at the start, which\r\nwere not carefully sorted, or it may be due to fermentation which takes\r\nplace in the factory, caused by extreme delay or by unsanitary\r\nequipment. In primary spoilage the mold is usually very high and the\r\nyeasts and bacteria may be low, while in secondary spoilage either the\r\nyeasts or bacteria, or both, will be high, and the molds may be low.\r\nThis will be explained further later in this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Government Regulations\r\n\r\nWhen the government regulations on tomato products were first published\r\nit was stated that for catsup the microscopical counts should not run\r\nabove the following:\r\n\r\n            Molds in 25% of the microscopic fields.\r\n            Yeasts and spores—25 in 1/60th cubic millimeter.\r\n            Bacteria—25 million per cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\nIt was also stated that pulp which was to be converted into catsup\r\nshould not contain more than half this number of micro-organisms, as\r\nallowance must be made for the increase due to concentration.\r\n\r\nThe fact that pulp and catsup can be made to keep within these limits\r\nhas been demonstrated a number of times, but I have yet to see a\r\nseason’s run, all of which, or even 50% of which, will come within these\r\nlimits. It is easy enough to run individual batches which by careful\r\nsupervision over the sorters will have a very low count of molds, etc.,\r\nbut regardless of the precautions a man will take to safeguard himself,\r\nthere is almost bound to be at some time in the season some manufactured\r\ngoods that will run over these limits. The packer, however, should keep\r\nthese limits in mind as an ideal to work to, not on one batch, but on a\r\nseason’s run, but it is not an easy goal to attain, and in my opinion\r\nthe government doesn’t expect it to be attained very often. The packer\r\nhas to contend with a glut of tomatoes in September almost every year;\r\nit is difficult to get good help to do the sorting and to supervise the\r\nsorting; unfavorable weather conditions make the tomatoes moldy and full\r\nof rot; delayed shipments come in in very bad condition; machinery\r\nbreaks down at the most unexpected times, and necessitates delay in the\r\nfactory at critical moments; the help get careless about the cleanliness\r\nof the equipment, and run through some goods before the unclean parts\r\nare discovered; accidents occur in the power plant and the plant may\r\nhave to run on inadequate steam for two or three days, etc., etc. Every\r\npacker has been up against these things, but as a rule pure food\r\ninspectors have not, and they are sometimes slow to appreciate the\r\npackers’ side of the case. This is particularly true of local health\r\ninspectors who have had no experience with food manufacturing problems,\r\nand sometimes permit a packer to receive a lot of unfavorable and unjust\r\nnewspaper publicity.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the government pure food departments, that is, the high\r\nofficials of the Bureau of Chemistry, intend to play very fair with\r\ncanners, and it must be admitted that they will go a long way with a man\r\nwho is making an honest and determined effort to pack his goods in the\r\nright way, and who is taking advantage of the opportunities he has to\r\npost himself on modern methods of packing his products. The packer\r\nshould remember that the product of a plant that is run in an unsanitary\r\nway is always under suspicion by the government, and that shipments from\r\nthese plants are the ones which are apt to be watched by the government\r\nagents. The government can go into any railroad office, whether\r\ngovernment or privately controlled, ask the agent to show them the bills\r\nof lading on shipments, and notify their inspector at destination to\r\ntake samples of the car on arrival.\r\n\r\nGetting back to the subject of established limits for micro-organisms,\r\nin the fall of 1916 the government authorities named the point at which\r\nthey were recommending condemnation proceedings. The notice, which was\r\nissued by the Bureau of Chemistry of the Department of Agriculture,\r\nstated that at the present time they were not advising condemnation of\r\ntomato products unless the micro-organisms exceeded at least one of the\r\nfollowing counts:\r\n\r\n           Molds in 66% of the microscopic fields.\r\n           Yeasts and Spores—125 in 1/60th cubic millimeter.\r\n           Bacteria—100 million per cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\nThis is a long way from the limit of 25 on each count, which the\r\ngovernment formerly stated should not in their opinion be exceeded. At\r\nthe same time, however, Mr. Howard of the Bureau of Chemistry made a\r\nstatement to the effect that they still considered it possible under\r\nmanufacturing conditions to make these products to comply with the\r\noriginal 25–25–25 limit, and that it was their intention to approach the\r\noriginal limits more closely. It should not be understood that the\r\ngovernment thinks that products which run below the higher limits are\r\ngood enough, because they decidedly do not, but at present they are not\r\nrecommending for condemnation those products which run below these\r\nfigures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          State Food Officials\r\n\r\nWhat about the state pure food boards? Do they follow the government\r\nlead in this matter or act according to their own ideas? Some follow the\r\ngovernment and some do not. Some state officials are quite lenient while\r\nothers are very strict. A product which one would pass as being all\r\nright, another would condemn. I have seen state officials condemn catsup\r\nwhich I am quite sure the government would pass, although it wasn’t as\r\ngood as it should have been. If the manufacturer had cared to carry it\r\nto the courts there would have been an even chance of him winning out.\r\nHowever, the loss of prestige due to the publicity of such action is\r\noften greater than the loss of the manufactured goods would be and as a\r\nrule the manufacturer does not contest the case. Publicity is a powerful\r\nwhip in the hands of the government and state officials.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Checking Up Daily Runs\r\n\r\nWhat is the manufacturer to do about checking up his daily runs of pulp\r\nand catsup during the season? Is it better for him to send his samples\r\nto a commercial laboratory, or to employ an analyst to work at his\r\nfactory, or to do the best he can in the sorting and in the factory\r\nroutine, assuming that if he uses proper care here his products are sure\r\nto analyze all right and he doesn’t need to worry.\r\n\r\nThis problem has been discussed a great deal. To employ an analyst on\r\nthe place is usually rather expensive for a small packer if the man is\r\nfully competent to do the work, and unless he is, he is worse than\r\nuseless. To send samples to an outside laboratory often involves\r\nconsiderable delay in getting the reports, and by the time the results\r\nare known the goods are stacked away and almost forgotten. If they ran\r\nhigh in micro-organisms there was some cause for it, and that cause\r\nshould have been remedied at once, and probably would have been had the\r\nanalysis been reported within a day or two. Therein lies the chief\r\nadvantage of getting an analysis quickly. An analysis on products which\r\nhave been run a week previously is, of course, better than nothing, but\r\nit is far from being satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe third method, that is, relying upon care in the factory and having\r\nno analysis made, was at one time recommended, but it is not now\r\nconsidered good policy. In a great many cases where this policy was\r\nadopted it was found out when it was too late that much of the goods\r\nthat was thought to be all right was decidedly off. There were\r\nundiscovered errors in the manufacturing process, and they remained\r\nundiscovered because there was no means of checking them up.\r\n\r\nMy advice in this matter is to have an analyst trained for this work and\r\nemploy him at your factory if you are so far from a reputable analyst\r\nthat it will take some little time to get a report. The Research\r\nLaboratories of The National Canners Association at Washington is\r\nundertaking the training of men in this analytical work for those\r\ncompanies that desire it. If the packer is close enough to a reputable\r\nanalyst to get a report within a day or two he will find that such an\r\narrangement is usually satisfactory, and he should rush his samples with\r\nall possible speed, and request the analyst to wire the report if the\r\nanalysis is high.\r\n\r\nThen there is the problem of what laboratory to send samples to. Will\r\nany reputable chemical or bacteriological laboratory do for this\r\npurpose? Many packers have made a mistake right here, and the analyses\r\nthey have received have been worse than nothing because they were not\r\nonly grossly inaccurate but misleading. They have gone on thinking their\r\ngoods were all right and have found out later by some accident that they\r\nwere all wrong.\r\n\r\nAlthough an analyst may be a good microscopist and fully competent to do\r\ngeneral bacteriological or biological work, he cannot possibly get a\r\ncorrect microscopical analysis on tomato products unless he is familiar\r\nwith the Howard method as used by Mr. Howard. This means that he must\r\nuse the exact technique that Mr. Howard uses in his laboratory. Every\r\nmanipulation, no matter how slight, must be made in precisely the same\r\nmanner that Mr. Howard makes it; otherwise the results are worthless. An\r\nanalyst, in order to be competent to use the method, must either work\r\nwith Mr. Howard until he can check him on all kinds of samples, or he\r\nmust work with one of the analysts that have been closely associated\r\nwith Mr. Howard in this work. If the analyst has had factory experience\r\nand can assist the packer in running down the causes of high counts,\r\nthat is a great advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       How to Interpret Analyses\r\n\r\nWe will say that a sample of pulp taken from one of the daily runs has\r\nbeen sent to an analyst, and the report on it is as follows:\r\n\r\n            Molds in 70% of microscopic fields.\r\n            Yeasts and Spores—10 in 1/60th cubic millimeter.\r\n            Bacteria—12 million per cubic centimeter.\r\n\r\nWhat does that analysis mean?\r\n\r\nThe first item means that the analyst examined through the microscope 50\r\nviews of a thin layer of the pulp on a slide, and that out of these 50\r\nviews, 35 of them contained sufficient mold to count them as positive\r\nfields, so that molds were found to be present in 35 out of 50 fields,\r\nor in 70% of them.\r\n\r\nThe second item means that from another prepared slide of this pulp\r\n(which slide is so ruled that the volume of liquid on any given space of\r\nit can be measured) there were found to be 10 yeasts and spores in\r\n1/60th of a cubic millimeter. A cubic millimeter is about ⅕th of a drop,\r\nand 1/60th of a cubic millimeter is therefore about 1/300th of a drop—an\r\nexceedingly small quantity, almost inconceivable. The best way to\r\nconceive it is to think of one drop of pulp mixed in 299 drops of water,\r\nand a drop taken from this exceedingly dilute mixture. In this almost\r\ninconceivably small amount of pulp there were 10 yeasts and spores.\r\n\r\nThe third item means that in the same slide in which the yeasts and\r\nspores were counted there were found to be 12 million rod-shaped\r\nbacteria in each cubic centimeter. A cubic centimeter is about 20 drops.\r\n\r\nMore important to the packer than the above, however, is the\r\ninterpretation of the analysis from the factory standpoint. What does it\r\nindicate about the way the tomatoes were handled and worked up? The\r\nmolds are high and the yeasts and bacteria are low. It means that in all\r\nprobability the tomatoes were not properly sorted, but that they were\r\nworked up rapidly enough after the sorting. It indicates primary\r\nspoilage, but little or no secondary spoilage. If there had been\r\nsecondary spoilage, either the yeasts or bacteria or both would be high.\r\nIt is a tip for the packer to watch the sorting belt closely.\r\n\r\nWe will say that the report on another sample is as follows:\r\n\r\n                Molds in 20% of the microscopic fields.\r\n                Yeasts and Spores—70 in 1/60th C. M.\r\n                Bacteria—110 million per C. C.\r\n\r\nWhat is indicated by that analysis?\r\n\r\nIt shows that the tomatoes were probably sorted all right, and that the\r\nprimary spoilage is probably small, but that there is a very strong\r\nindication of secondary spoilage, that is, spoilage which took place in\r\nthe factory. Unless the tomatoes were extremely soft and partially\r\nfermented when they were run up, there was probably great delay at some\r\nstage in the manufacturing process, or some of the equipment was in a\r\nvery unsanitary condition and the fresh goods became contaminated with\r\nfermented tomato substance which was carried over with it a little at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSuppose the analysis ran as follows:\r\n\r\n                Molds in 20% of the microscopic fields.\r\n                Yeasts and Spores—25 in 1/60th C. M.\r\n                Bacteria—110 million per C. C.\r\n\r\nThis also indicates secondary spoilage. The same conditions are\r\nindicated in this analysis as in the preceding one. The only difference\r\nis that instead of the fermentation being conducted by both yeasts and\r\nbacteria, it was conducted by bacteria alone. In other cases the yeasts\r\nand spores may run high and the bacteria low, indicating that the\r\nfermentation was one of yeasts, and not bacteria. If all three of the\r\ncounts run high it indicates that either the tomatoes were very moldy\r\nand soft to begin with and were improperly sorted, or that they were\r\nboth improperly sorted and that the pulped juice was improperly handled\r\nin the factory. It is almost a sure indication of primary spoilage, and\r\npoints very strongly to secondary spoilage also.\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable criticism of the Howard method of analyzing\r\ntomato products, and it cannot be denied that the method is far from\r\nbeing ideal. It is the best method that we have, however, and the packer\r\ncan be sure of one thing, namely, that if his products are made right\r\nthey will never show a high test by this method. It is true that all\r\nimproperly made goods do not give a high test by this method, and that\r\nis one objection to it. These cases, however, are infrequent. The method\r\nof estimating all three counts has also been criticized as being unfair\r\nand not in accordance with the best bacteriological practice. If\r\nanything better was suggested the Bureau of Chemistry would no doubt be\r\nglad to adopt it, but so far as I know, no improvement has been offered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II\r\nThe Manufacture of Tomato Catsup, Chili Sauce, Trimming Pulp, and Tomato\r\n                                  Soup\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\nA DISCUSSION OF PRESERVATIVE AND NON-PRESERVATIVE CATSUPS, AND THE MOST\r\n                     FREQUENT CAUSES OF INFERIORITY\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Unfavorable Publicity on Preservatives\r\n\r\nWhen the pure food movement first swept over this country the subject of\r\npreservatives got very wide publicity, and the sensational press fed the\r\npeople up on the news that their food was being doctored with all sorts\r\nof chemicals. Tomato catsup came in for its share of this publicity, and\r\nthe two preservatives most commonly used in catsup, namely, benzoate of\r\nsoda and salicylic acid, were classed among the chemicals that were\r\nruining our stomachs.\r\n\r\nAlthough salicylic acid has been ruled out, benzoate of soda is still\r\nbeing used to some extent. The great bulk of the catsup now being\r\nmanufactured, however, is made without preservative, because packers\r\nrealize that a good percentage of the public became prejudiced against\r\npreservatives of all sorts during the pure food agitation, and a great\r\nmany are still prejudiced against even so mild and harmless a\r\npreservative as benzoate of soda. There are those who still maintain\r\nthat this preservative is or may be harmful when used to the extent of\r\none-tenth of one per cent, which is the permissible amount according to\r\nthe federal law; however, the Remsen board appointed by President\r\nRoosevelt to decide the benzoate question unanimously decided that when\r\nbenzoate of soda is used in condiments to the extent of one-tenth of one\r\nper cent it is perfectly harmless. It was even found to be perfectly\r\nharmless in much larger proportions.\r\n\r\nThese facts, however, have never reached the masses, most of whom never\r\nheard of the Remsen board, and even if they had, a great many people\r\nwould still remain prejudiced. Most packers think, therefore, that it is\r\nbest to play safe and make their catsup without chemical preservative,\r\nrelying solely upon sterilization to keep their product from spoiling up\r\nto the time the bottle is opened, and upon so called “natural”\r\npreservatives to keep it from fermenting after the cork is drawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        “Natural” Preservatives\r\n\r\nThat these “natural” preservatives, when present in large quantity, as\r\nthey sometimes are, may be more harmful to the stomach than a minute\r\nquantity of benzoate of soda, is surely a reasonable supposition. I have\r\nknown of people getting sick directly after a meal by eating a good deal\r\nof catsup of high acidity on a steak and drinking milk along with it. At\r\nleast the sickness was attributed to this combination, and it doesn’t\r\nseem unreasonable. A high acetic acid acidity will keep catsup as well\r\nor better than ⅒th of 1% of sodium benzoate will. There are catsups on\r\nthe market made “without preservative” that would probably never\r\nferment, even if exposed to the air for a year, because they contain so\r\nmuch acetic acid. The raw acetic acid is, of course, not permitted to be\r\nused, but a very strong distilled vinegar is used containing about 10%\r\nof acetic acid.\r\n\r\nThe “natural” preservatives of catsup are the vinegar, sugar, salt, and\r\nspices. The vinegar probably exerts 80% of the preserving property, the\r\nsugar about 10% and the salt and spices together 10%. The sugar would\r\nhave much greater preserving properties if it was present in higher\r\nconcentration as in preserves or jelly. It is doubtful if the\r\npreservative properties of sugar are very great when it is only present\r\nto the extent of about 10 or 15%, and the product is of a liquid nature\r\nlike catsup.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Proper Acidity\r\n\r\nThe proper thing for a packer of non-preservative catsup to do is to\r\nstrike a happy medium on acidity; use enough vinegar to keep it under\r\nalmost any conditions, but not so much as to almost entirely mask the\r\ntomato flavor and require sugar in such large quantity as to make the\r\nfinal product resemble tomato preserves. A good total acidity is 1.25%,\r\nfigured as acetic acid. This figure includes both the acetic acidity of\r\nthe vinegar and the natural acidity of the tomato. If a catsup is\r\nproperly manufactured, this acidity should answer practically all\r\npurposes. The catsup packer should not be expected to make catsup which\r\nwill keep in perfect condition in restaurants where absolutely no care\r\nor intelligence is used in handling it. This class of restaurant\r\nproprietor is fortunately in a decided minority, but rather than make a\r\ncatsup that will be so strongly acid that it will stand up under his\r\ntreatment, he should be educated to use a little care in the handling of\r\nthe catsup.\r\n\r\nThe following is a common abuse in restaurants. We will say, for\r\nexample, that three catsup bottles are on the tables containing from a\r\nhalf inch to two inches of catsup. The waitress does not like to put a\r\nbottle which is almost empty before a customer, so she pours the\r\ncontents of two of the three bottles into the other one. The catsup in\r\nthese bottles may be a week old. When the contents of the bottle\r\ncontaining this mixture are almost gone she pours the rest of it into\r\nanother partly filled bottle and so on, so that some of the bottles may\r\ncontain catsup which is over a month old, and in a warm, poorly\r\nventilated restaurant it is apt to start fermenting. The proprietor\r\nshould be educated to the fact that when using a non-preservative catsup\r\nhe must not pour it from one bottle to another, but must leave it in the\r\noriginal container until almost gone, and then use the balance for\r\nmaking tomato sauce, spaghetti sauce, and for flavoring soups, gravies,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nOne advantage the packer using benzoate of soda has over the\r\nnon-preservative packer is that he can make his catsup so that it will\r\nkeep properly and at the same time maintain the natural tomato flavor to\r\na high degree. The tomato flavor is maintained because it is not largely\r\nmasked by the use of a lot of vinegar and sugar. The packer using\r\nbenzoate rarely uses more than a third as much vinegar or half as much\r\nsugar as the non-preservative packer.\r\n\r\nMany non-preservative catsup makers who read this will think a total\r\nacidity of 1.25% is higher than necessary. They will say to themselves\r\nthat the acidity on their catsup never runs over 1%, and they have never\r\nhad any complaints. It may be that they do not have a very big\r\nrestaurant trade where so many of the fermentation complaints come from,\r\nor that they do not have a very wide distribution of their product so\r\nthat it is subjected to all sorts of climatic conditions, or it may be\r\nthat they are having a case of fermentation now and then in households\r\nbut never hear about it. In that case the housewife usually merely drops\r\nthat brand and buys another one next time. But where a restaurant or\r\nhotel is having fermentation trouble, the manufacturer is sure to hear\r\nabout it quick.\r\n\r\nIt is wise to allow a fair margin of safety, and my experience is that a\r\ntotal acidity of 1.25% is not too high. Quite a few catsup packers\r\nmaintain an acidity between 1.50% and 1.75%, and one large concern has\r\nfor years kept the acidity of their catsup around 2%. This, however,\r\nseems unnecessarily high. Acidity will be discussed further in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Processing Catsups\r\n\r\nNon-preservative catsups should either be processed after filling and\r\nsealing, or the bottles should be sterilized before filling and the\r\ncatsup filled very hot without giving an after-sterilization. Catsups\r\nmade with the addition of benzoate of soda are not processed; however,\r\nthe fact that benzoate is used should not cause laxness at any stage in\r\nthe manufacturing process. It is a mistake for manufacturers to think\r\nthat ⅒th of 1% of benzoate of soda will keep their product in perfect\r\ncondition regardless of how careless they are in their manufacturing\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Advantage of Benzoate Catsups\r\n\r\nSome brands of benzoate catsup enjoy a very good sale, and are popular\r\nwith those who do not like a strongly acid and sugary catsup, but prefer\r\none which is mild and in which the predominating flavor is one of tomato\r\nblended with mild spicing. A restaurant using a catsup or chili sauce of\r\nthis character will almost always use more of it than they will of a\r\nstrongly acid catsup which is highly spiced. If the catsup is mild, more\r\nof it is usually used at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Causes of Poor Color and Flavor\r\n\r\nThe chief objections to most of the catsups on the market are a lack of\r\nbright red color, and a more or less scorched taste. This may be due to\r\na number of causes. The brownish color may be due to underripe tomatoes,\r\nor to tomatoes which were picked during a spell of cold, dark weather.\r\nIt takes sunshine to give tomatoes a brilliant color, and when there is\r\nan absence of sunshine for a week or ten days many of the tomatoes will\r\nrot before they attain a bright red color. At such times during the\r\nseason it is impossible to get a brilliant color, but if the packer will\r\nexercise as much control as he is able to over the picking, persuading\r\nthe farmers to hold their tomatoes back just as long as possible, he\r\nwill not have a great deal of such goods and he can get a fair color out\r\nof what he does get, out of these dull colored tomatoes. He should be\r\ncareful not to mix brownish tinted catsup with the brilliant red goods.\r\nIf he will keep similar shades of catsup in the same shipment he is not\r\nnearly as apt to have complaints as he will have if he mixes different\r\ncolors. It is even more important that all the bottles in one case\r\nshould be very nearly alike. A grocer who receives a case of catsup all\r\nof which is very slightly off in color will usually not complain unless\r\nit is decidedly off. If, however, off colored bottles are mixed in the\r\nsame case with bottles of a brilliant red color, the poor colored goods\r\nsuffer greatly by comparison, and then there is apt to be a complaint.\r\n\r\nThe other causes of poor colored catsup are scorching at some stage in\r\nthe manufacturing process and too much cooking. By too much cooking is\r\nnot only meant too long a cook at one time, but also too much cooking in\r\nthe aggregate. For example, a packer receives tomatoes of good color and\r\nhe cooks them into pulp, which requires a cook of thirty minutes. He\r\npacks the pulp in No. 10 cans and sterilizes it about forty minutes, and\r\nhe has a good colored pulp, as it has only received two short cookings.\r\nHe stores this pulp for several months, and then makes it into catsup.\r\nIt is reheated, which is hard on the color, as heat applied to cold pulp\r\nfor five minutes to bring it to a boil seems to hurt the color as much\r\nas a half hour added on to the cook after the pulp is hot. After\r\nreheating, it is cooked into catsup, which requires about thirty\r\nminutes, and after being bottled it is sterilized at a high temperature\r\nfor about an hour, which makes the fourth cooking those tomatoes get.\r\nThis is what is meant by too much cooking in the aggregate. Too long a\r\ncook at one time will, of course, also darken the product.\r\n\r\nScorching is more frequent with catsup made from pulp than with that\r\nmade from fresh tomatoes. Much of the catsup made from pulp, although\r\nnot actually scorched, has a very faint scorched flavor to it.\r\n\r\nIt is hard indeed to make catsup from pulp which tastes like the goods\r\nwhich is bottled from freshly run tomatoes. It falls behind in both\r\ncolor and flavor. One finds that color and flavor are very closely\r\nassociated in catsup. A bright red catsup is practically always a fine\r\nflavored product, while a dull colored catsup with a brownish cast to it\r\nvery frequently has a more or less unpleasant taste with the suggestion\r\nof being somewhat scorched.\r\n\r\n\r\n         Advantage of Direct Conversion of Tomatoes Into Catsup\r\n\r\nMany catsup makers are doing away with winter packing almost altogether.\r\nThey bottle at least 90% of their catsup direct from fresh tomatoes.\r\nHalf of the remaining 10% is made from 50% fresh tomatoes and 50% pulp,\r\nthe pulp being added about ten minutes before the cooking is completed.\r\nThis fresh tomato and pulp mixture makes a much better flavored product\r\nthan one can expect to get from straight pulp. Pulp can always be used\r\nin combination with fresh tomatoes at the beginning and at the close of\r\nthe season when the tomato receipts are light.\r\n\r\nCatsup made direct from tomatoes is not only of superior quality, but it\r\ncan be manufactured at least 20c a dozen cheaper for the pint size than\r\ncatsup made from canned pulp. In many cases the difference will run more\r\nthan that. Packers who put up a general line of tomato products will do\r\nwell to reserve their fresh tomatoes for catsup, and to use their pulp\r\nfor bean sauce, spaghetti sauce, tomato soup, etc., all of which can be\r\nmade better from pulp than one can make catsup from pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Thickness\r\n\r\nThe thickness of catsups found on the market is fairly uniform, and\r\nthere is rarely a cause for complaint on this score. When catsup is\r\npacked in cans, the thicker it is the better the buyer likes it as a\r\nrule; however with bottled goods excessive thickness is not a virtue but\r\na cause of much annoyance to the consumer. It is better to have it just\r\na shade too thin than too thick.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Spicing and Sweetness\r\n\r\nImproper spicing of catsups is not a common fault either. Even where\r\nessential oils are used exclusively for spicing, a real good flavor can\r\nbe had if the oils are properly administered. As to sweetness, many\r\ncatsup makers are coming to the conclusion that the public is demanding\r\na slightly sweeter catsup than was generally packed eight or ten years\r\nago. There is very little doubt but what a composite sample from a half\r\ndozen prominent brands of today, if compared with a composite sample\r\ntaken from the same brands ten years ago, would show quite an increase\r\nin sweetness. One of the largest selling brands on the market has a\r\ndistinct sweetish taste, and the public, at least a large percentage of\r\nit, seems to like it. There are still many who like a tart or slightly\r\nsour taste, but the tendency is unquestionably in the other direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              “Black Neck”\r\n\r\nA rather common defect in bottled catsup is what is commonly called\r\n“black neck,” which is a darkened space in the neck of the bottle, all\r\nthe way from a half inch to over two inches in depth. Several years ago\r\nI made a very thorough investigation of the causes of black necked\r\ncatsup, and every thing seems to point to the fact that in nine cases\r\nout of ten it comes from leakage of air into the closure of the bottle.\r\nThe space between the surface of the catsup and the top of the bottle\r\nshould be a vacuum if the seal is perfect, as this space is left by the\r\ncontraction of the catsup in the bottle when it cools. Many closures, no\r\nmatter what style, do not seem to be entirely impervious to air, and the\r\ncatsup gradually darkens as the air is gradually admitted. A suggestion\r\nfor overcoming “black neck” will be given later under the head of\r\n“stacking catsup.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         General Attractiveness\r\n\r\nThe general attractiveness of the package is, of course, important. A\r\ncheap, unvarnished label which quickly becomes dirty looking, and a\r\ncheap tin cap which gets black and filthy looking on the inside after\r\nthe catsup has been open a few days, do not enhance the sale of a\r\nproduct, and only make a very slight reduction in the manufacturing\r\ncost. The packer should by all means use either a re-tinned cap or an\r\ninside enameled cap. Ordinary plain tin caps should be absolutely\r\nbarred, as they are entirely unfit for a bottled condiment which\r\ncontains as much acid as catsup.\r\n\r\nAlthough the remarks in this chapter have been confined to catsup, it\r\nshould be understood that they apply equally to chili sauce, which only\r\ndiffers from catsup in that it is made from peeled instead of strained\r\ntomatoes, and is usually a little bit more spicy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n A DISCUSSION OF THE INGREDIENTS OF CATSUP; WHEN AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE\r\n   ADDED; AND THE AMOUNTS OF EACH PER 100 GALLONS OF FINISHED CATSUP\r\n\r\n\r\nPractically all of this chapter will be devoted to non-preservative\r\ncatsup. The use of benzoate of soda and the changes in the formula which\r\nits use involves will be briefly discussed at the end of the chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Measuring the Volume of Tomato Juice\r\n\r\nWhen catsup is being manufactured direct from tomatoes the tomatoes\r\nshould be previously cycloned, either by the cold or hot process. I have\r\nnever cooked catsup direct from crushed tomatoes, as it is evident that\r\ncrushed stock is open to at least two objections. The first is that the\r\nfinishing point would be rather hard to gauge accurately, due to the\r\npresence of so many peelings, and the second is that when the peelings\r\nand seeds are screened out by the finishing machine they would no doubt\r\ncarry some of the ingredients with them, chiefly sugar, which would be a\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nIf the tomato juice is delivered to the catsup cooking kettle from a\r\n“breaking tank,” as it is in the hot pulping method, the volume of\r\ntomatoes to be used per batch of catsup is measured on the “breaking\r\ntank,” and the cycloned juice is delivered from this tank to the catsup\r\ncooking kettle as the condensation gradually allows more and more of it\r\nto be taken care of.\r\n\r\nIf the cold pulping process is used some other method of measuring the\r\ntomatoes for each batch must be used. One way is to have the catsup\r\ncooking kettle built high enough so that it can hold the entire volume\r\nof cycloned juice required for the batch without boiling over when the\r\nsteam is turned on. The juice is then pumped over to a certain measure\r\non the kettle before the cooking is begun. This requires very high\r\ncooking tanks. Another way is to take over as much juice as the kettle\r\nwill hold and concentrate it, and then shut off the steam and take over\r\nanother measured volume according to a gauge on the inside of the tank\r\nwhich reaches from top to bottom, and is marked off in gallons. If this\r\nmethod is used the cooking kettles need not be so high. Another way is\r\nto use a meter on the pipe line between the cyclone and the cooking\r\nkettles, which will register, within twenty-five gallons, the volume of\r\ntomato juice being pumped over.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, an advantage to start the cooking as soon as the coil\r\nor jacket is covered, so as to kill growing micro-organisms as quickly\r\nas possible, and it is also an advantage to keep the contents of the\r\nkettle vigorously boiling from the time the coil or jacket is covered\r\nwith the fresh juice until the batch of catsup is finished.\r\n\r\nNone of the ingredients should be added until all of the tomato juice\r\nfor the batch is in the kettle, with the exception of the bag of spices.\r\n\r\nIt is usually not considered advisable to cook batches of catsup of over\r\n300 gallons when finished. I have cooked as much as 400 gallons at a\r\ntime, but it requires quite a long cook to complete the condensation\r\nunless the tank has a large surface for evaporation and a coil with a\r\nvery large cooking capacity, and a high steam pressure is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Amount of Tomatoes\r\n\r\nIn discussing the proper amounts of the various ingredients to use, a\r\nbatch of finished catsup of 100 gallons in volume, when measured hot,\r\nwill be taken as the basis throughout this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe amount of tomatoes required to make 100 gallons of finished catsup\r\nvaries according to the season of the year and the quality of the stock.\r\nIf the tomatoes are watery, or contain so much rot that 25% or more must\r\nbe cut away, that of course makes a big difference. If, on the other\r\nhand, the tomatoes are large and meaty, and contain scarcely any rot, a\r\ncomparatively small amount of them are required. Taking tomatoes of\r\naverage size, containing an average amount of solid matter, and from\r\nwhich 10% by weight of rotten material is sorted out, it is safe to\r\nfigure on 37 bushels of tomatoes or 59⅝th bushel baskets for 100 gallons\r\nof finished catsup.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Keeping Batches Uniform\r\n\r\nIf the catsup batches are to be kept uniform in size throughout the\r\nseason, as they should be, the quantity of tomatoes per batch will have\r\nto be changed slightly from time to time according to the amount of\r\nwater they contain. The only safe way is to put a gauge on each cooking\r\ntank which marks the desired volume of catsup when cooked, and to vary\r\nthe volume of tomato juice per batch to the extent which is indicated by\r\nthe gauge. If the batches are running two inches low, the cook will know\r\nby a little experimenting just how much extra juice will be required per\r\nbatch to make it right.\r\n\r\nHaving all the batches come out exactly the same in size is important,\r\nboth in preservative and non-preservative goods. In the former, the\r\npercentage of preservative cannot, of course, be kept uniform unless the\r\nbatches are kept uniform in size. In non-preservative goods it is\r\nadvisable to keep the percentage of acetic acid—that ingredient upon\r\nwhich the keeping quality chiefly depends—as nearly uniform as possible.\r\nOf course, if a batch runs large, the acetic acid percentage will be\r\nlow, while if the batch runs small, the acetic acid percentage will be\r\nhigher than necessary. The spicing will also be more uniform if the\r\nbatches are uniform in size.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Use of Spices in a Sack\r\n\r\nWhere the spices are put in a sack, the sack is usually tied to the\r\ncoil, if this type of cooking tank is being used, and where a jacketed\r\nkettle is used, there being no place to tie the sack, it is usually just\r\nthrown on top of the boiling tomato juice and allowed to float around\r\nnear the surface during the boiling. One concern uses a long pole which\r\nis suspended from overhead and reaches to within a foot of the bottom of\r\nthe jacketed kettle. The sack is tied to this pole, and it is thus held\r\ndown during the boiling. As to whether any flavor is actually lost by\r\nallowing the spice bag to float near the surface is a question. This\r\ncould easily be determined by an analysis of the spice residue.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Use of Spices Direct and When to Add Them\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, whole spices are always used when the spices are\r\nplaced in a sack, and when they are thrown into the catsup direct,\r\nground spice is used. It is claimed by some that the latter method gives\r\njust as good results as the former, and that no advantage is to be\r\ngained by the use of sacks. As to whether or not this is true I cannot\r\nsay, as I have never used ground spices in catsup with the exception of\r\npepper, ginger and paprika. The reason for using sacks, of course, is to\r\nallow the flavor of the spice to be extracted without having the spices\r\ncome in direct contact with the catsup. If you will macerate some ground\r\nallspice or cloves in dilute acetic acid for a while, you will notice\r\nthe black substance which is extracted, and it is surely reasonable to\r\nsuppose that at least some of this will be extracted in catsup when the\r\nground spices are thrown in direct. As for the cassia, there probably\r\nwould be no objection to the use of the spice direct.\r\n\r\nThe flavor of mace is lost by continued boiling, and the use of it in a\r\nsack which stays in the boiling liquid for thirty minutes or longer is a\r\nwaste of the mace. If mace is boiled long in direct contact with the\r\ncatsup it imparts a very bitter taste. The proper way to add mace is to\r\nthrow it in direct in the broken form about three minutes before the\r\nbatch is done. Ginger should be added at the same time as mace, as its\r\nvolatile oil passes off very rapidly, and if cooked long it will\r\npractically all be lost by volatilization. As to the pepper and paprika,\r\nthey are added direct in the ground form at the beginning of the\r\ncooking. Mustard is also said to be used in catsup, but it apparently\r\nisn’t used extensively.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Use of Spices in Two Batches\r\n\r\nIf the whole spices are placed in a sack it is a good idea to cook each\r\nsack of spices in two batches. In this way more of the flavor is\r\nextracted than would be taken out by one boiling. This can be proven by\r\ncooking a batch of catsup with no spice other than a sack of spices\r\nwhich has been previously cooked in a batch of catsup. Note the flavor\r\nwhich is extracted by the second cooking, and you will see where you are\r\nlosing valuable material when you throw away a bag of spice residue\r\nafter one cooking. Of course the cook will then have two sacks of spices\r\nin each batch—a new one and an old one, and he must mark them in some\r\nway so he can tell which is which when the batch is drawn off. A good\r\nway is to tie the new sack with a single knot, and the old one with a\r\ndouble knot. This method seems to be less confusing to the cook than any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to tie the spices in the sack loosely. If a cook is\r\nnot instructed about this he will invariably tie a cord around the sack\r\nso close to the spices that there is no room for them to move around\r\nwhile the sack is being agitated by the boiling. Undoubtedly a better\r\nextraction can be obtained if the spices have freedom of movement in the\r\nsacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           What Is Extracted\r\n\r\nWhat we really get from the spices is a water extract. The acetic acid\r\nof the vinegar probably extracts a little more, but as the vinegar is\r\nonly cooked in the catsup about three minutes, a great deal of\r\nextraction could not be expected from that source. Not only the volatile\r\noils, but organic compounds called esters, and also some of the\r\nnon-volatile oils are extracted from the spices. The volatile oils\r\nproduce most of the flavor, however the esters also add to the flavor\r\nconsiderably. The non-volatile or “fixed” oil of cayenne pepper has\r\nquite a strong spicy flavor, although not nearly as strong as the\r\nvolatile oil of cayenne. The fixed oils of cassia, allspice, and mace\r\nhave no flavor at all.\r\n\r\nEven though a bag of spices be boiled in two batches of forty-five\r\nminutes each, a great deal of their flavor is still left in them. This\r\nhas been proven by chemical analyses of spice residues. Even quite a\r\nlarge percentage of the volatile oils still remain in the spice residue,\r\nand, of course, a larger percentage of the non-volatile or fixed oils.\r\nIt is a question, however, as to whether the extraction of the volatile\r\noil of these spice residues would be a paying proposition. So far as I\r\nknow, none of the distillers of essential oils seem to be interested in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Storing Spices\r\n\r\nSpices should not be held in storage for a long time, particularly in\r\nopen bins, as some of their volatile oils pass off little by little into\r\nthe air and are lost. This is especially true of cassia, either ground\r\nor broken. They should be stored in a dry place, as some of them are apt\r\nto mold if left in an atmosphere of condensing steam, and of course this\r\nmold would contaminate the catsup to some extent. I have seen mace which\r\nwas in a very moldy condition due to its having been stored in the cook\r\nroom for some time, and having collected moisture. Some of the milder\r\nvarieties of pepper are also known to become moldy on exposure to\r\nextreme dampness.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Quality of Flavor\r\n\r\nA great deal could be written about the quality of various varieties of\r\nthe same spice. All of these varieties will not be discussed here but I\r\nwill try to show how the packer is sometimes mislead by spice salesmen\r\nwho show chemical analyses of their spices as positive proof of the\r\nactual value that they contain. As a matter of fact, the true value of a\r\nspice cannot be shown by a chemical analysis.\r\n\r\nTake, for example, cassia. The finest flavored cassia is the Saigon\r\ncassia, which can be obtained in the thin quill, the medium bark, and in\r\nthe thick bark. At the other extreme we have the China cassia, which is\r\nconsiderably cheaper than the Saigon. If the catsup packer is going to\r\njudge his spices according to strength, he may find that he gets more\r\nstrength from the cheap cassia than from the expensive one. The chemical\r\nanalysis may show that the China cassia contains more essential oil than\r\nthe Saigon does. In fact, this is often the case. However, what about\r\nthe quality of that essential oil? There is the point. The essential oil\r\nextracted from the Saigon is different from that extracted from the\r\nChina cassia. It has a more delicate, refined flavor. Its flavor is more\r\npleasing to the palate, and is free from “harshness,” and “strength” of\r\nan unrefined nature.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that one cannot make a nice flavored catsup with\r\nChina cassia, as such is not the case, but a better flavor can be\r\nobtained with Saigon. The point is that quality of flavor as well as\r\nquantity of flavor must be considered. Chemical analyses are only of\r\nvalue when exactly the same variety of two or more samples of spice are\r\ncompared.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to cayenne pepper, the quality of the flavor is not the\r\nimportant factor that it is in the milder spices. Cayenne is used to\r\ngive “hotness” to the catsup, and the hotter the cayenne is, the greater\r\nits value to the packer. The Mombassa and the Japan chillies are the\r\nhottest, although in recent years they have been so expensive that it is\r\nmore economical to use some of the others, even though a slightly larger\r\nquantity may be required.\r\n\r\nFor allspice, it is not necessary to use a large, fancy berry, but a\r\nsmall size which is fairly free from sticks, stones, and decayed or\r\npithy berries will answer the purpose just as well. The relative values\r\nof samples can be compared by inspecting them and noting the percentage\r\nof foreign and decayed material.\r\n\r\nAs to cloves, it is again not necessary to use a fancy article, although\r\nall varieties will not impart exactly the same flavor, just as in the\r\ncase of cassia a different flavor is obtained from Saigon and China\r\ncassia. Some packers like the flavor of the Zanzibar cloves, while\r\nothers give another variety slight preference, chief among which are the\r\nPenang, Amboyna, and Pemba.\r\n\r\nPenang and Banda are the fanciest varieties of mace, but some of the\r\nother varieties are all right for catsup, with the exception of Bombay\r\nmace, which has no flavor, and is considered an adulterant.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Use of Essential Oils\r\n\r\nIn many cases spices are not used at all, but their essential oils are\r\nused instead. In other cases both spices and oils are used. Some packers\r\nobject to the use of cloves on account of the large amount of tannic\r\nacid they contain (usually from 16 to 20%), which it is thought has a\r\ndarkening tendency, especially if any iron is present, and it is also\r\nthought that other darkening substances are extracted from the cloves.\r\nIf the essential oil is used, this is avoided.\r\n\r\nEssential oils, when added properly, produce a catsup of good flavor,\r\nand the product is in every way acceptable. A better flavor, however,\r\ncan be obtained by the use of whole spices. A water extract obtained\r\nfrom whole spices is different from the essential oil of the spice. It\r\ncontains the essential oil, part of it at least, but it also contains\r\nother substances which impart flavor. The flavor produced by whole\r\nspices is not quite as harsh as that produced by essential oils. “Harsh”\r\nis not exactly the word, but it comes about as close to it as anything I\r\ncan think of. The whole spices impart a wealth of flavor, but there is\r\nfreedom from “strongness,” or any faint suggestion of a “drugstore\r\ntaste.” I have tasted catsups made with oils in which this “drugstore\r\ntaste”—I use the term for lack of a better one—was apparent, and it may\r\nhave been due to the quality of the essential oils used, but more than\r\nlikely was due to the fact that they were not properly administered. It\r\nis necessary to get the oils thoroughly and evenly incorporated into the\r\ncatsup without volatilizing too much of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       How to Add Essential Oils\r\n\r\nThe best way I know of to do this is as follows: Add the oil from a\r\nsmall lipped container, like an 8 oz. glass graduate, after the catsup\r\nis cooked, that is, just as soon as the steam is shut off of the batch,\r\nspreading it slowly over the entire surface of the catsup, not dumping\r\nit in one spot; then turn the steam on full, and leave it on five\r\nseconds; then shut it off immediately, and open the exhaust. This will\r\nnot make an absolutely perfect mixture of the oil in the catsup, but it\r\nwill do the job better than agitators, and by only leaving the steam on\r\nfive seconds very little of the oil is lost by volatilization. The\r\nbrushing of the catsup through the finishing machine also helps in more\r\nthoroughly mixing in the oil, and if the catsup is then pumped from the\r\nfinisher to a receiving tank over the filling machine, as is often done,\r\nthe mixing is made still more complete by the pumping process. If a\r\nnumber of different essential oils are used they are mixed together\r\nbefore adding. One large manufacturer whose catsup is well liked uses no\r\nwhole spices at all, even using oleo resin capsicum instead of ground\r\ncayenne pepper. Oleo resin capsicum is much hotter than the ground\r\ncayenne, and, of course, a very small quantity of it is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Paprika\r\n\r\nPaprika is used to a very large extent in catsup, chiefly because of its\r\nbright red color, which assists to some extent in toning up the color of\r\na catsup that would otherwise be rather unattractive because of its\r\nbrownish cast. If any appreciable help is to be obtained from paprika,\r\nit must be used in large quantity, and it must be of the most brilliant\r\nred variety. Much paprika has a dull brick or brownish color, and it\r\nmight as well be left out. The use of only a pound of paprika to 100\r\ngallons of catsup scarcely produces any effect on the color. If paprika\r\nis used, at least two pounds should be used for this quantity of catsup,\r\notherwise it might almost as well be omitted. Of course, paprika is a\r\nspice as well as a color, and on that account it can be used in catsup\r\nwithout any statement on the label to the effect that the product is\r\ncolored artificially. It does impart some flavor, but the flavor isn’t\r\nparticularly desirable in catsup. If paprika was yellow or brown,\r\ninstead of red, it is doubtful if it would be used at all in catsup;\r\ncertainly it would not be used extensively.\r\n\r\nMost of the best catsups on the market are made without paprika, and\r\nthese catsups are as a rule the most brilliant in color, as they are\r\nmade almost entirely from fresh tomatoes. The color is not killed by a\r\nlong succession of cooking processes, and therefore the use of paprika\r\nis unnecessary and would add absolutely nothing to the color.\r\n\r\nPaprika is a rather poor excuse for a coloring matter anyway. The\r\ncoloring principle in the spice is not soluble in the catsup, and all of\r\nthe color is retained within the grains of the powder. If this coloring\r\nprinciple dissolved in the catsup, as does cochineal, the effect would\r\nbe very good. The use of paprika is very easily detected by pouring out\r\na bit of the catsup on a piece of paper, and making a thin layer of it.\r\nThe grains of paprika then stand out very prominently.\r\n\r\nSome catsups are literally “loaded” with paprika, and they have a sort\r\nof brick color, which is somewhat different from the color produced by\r\nfresh, ripe tomatoes. This catsup would no doubt be brown if so much\r\npaprika wasn’t used. As to flavor, such goods are usually not very good,\r\nand are often very poor indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Quantities of Spices and Oils per Batch\r\n\r\nAs to the quantity of spices to use per 100 gallons of catsup, I would\r\nsuggest 3 oz. of ground cayenne pepper, 1½ lbs. of medium bark, broken\r\nSaigon cassia, 1¼ lbs. of whole allspice, and 1¼ lbs. of whole cloves.\r\nThe cassia, allspice, and cloves go in a sack, and the cayenne goes in\r\ndirect at the beginning of the cooking. If paprika is used it is put in\r\nwith the cayenne. If the essential oil of cloves is preferred to the\r\nwhole spice, 1 oz. of it will give a pronounced clove taste, although\r\nnot too pronounced.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to use essential oils altogether, with the exception of\r\nthe cayenne pepper, a good mixture is ½ oz. oil of cassia, 1 oz. oil of\r\ncloves, and ½ oz. oil of pimento. A good flavored catsup can also be\r\nobtained with the amounts of pepper, oil of cassia, and oil of cloves\r\ngiven above, but with no oil of pimento.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that with these oils the most important point is\r\nthe successful administration of them. Giving proper quantities to use\r\namounts to nothing if they are improperly administered. In fact, any\r\nkind of a formula for making a tomato product amounts to very little in\r\nitself. It doesn’t make any difference how fine a formula a man has, it\r\nby no means assures a good product. When the formula is obtained a bare\r\nstart is made. In the hands of one manufacturer excellent results will\r\nbe obtained with the use of a formula, while another man who has\r\npractically the same formula will make an absolute failure of his\r\nmanufacturing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Essential Oils Economical\r\n\r\nThe use of spice oils is more economical as far as the actual expense of\r\nthe formula is concerned, and it is also very convenient, as you have\r\nyour flavoring in small packages in a highly concentrated form. As these\r\noils are distilled from spices which are wormy, or for some other reason\r\nnot marketable as whole spices, the spice from which they are distilled\r\ncan be obtained very cheap. As a rule the oils are distilled where the\r\nspices are grown, and only the essential oil is imported. In order to\r\nmake the oils comply with the regulations of the U. S. Pharmacopoeia, it\r\nis usually necessary to re-distill them here, as they often contain lead\r\nfrom being transported in lead containers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Adulteration of Ground Spices\r\n\r\nIf ground spices are used they should be bought from a concern of very\r\nhigh standing, as their adulteration is by no means an uncommon\r\npractice. Deception is, of course, difficult in whole spices. Such\r\nadulteration as the use of ten or twenty per cent of ground pepper\r\nshells in ground pepper has frequently been discovered by government\r\nchemists. Ground olive stones, sawdust, brick dust, ground cocoanut\r\nshells, and many other inert substances have also been found in ground\r\nspices. Adulteration can almost always be detected by either\r\nmicroscopical or chemical examination, but there have been cases where\r\nthe adulteration has been so cleverly done that the only way it could be\r\nverified was by detective work on the part of government agents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Onions and Garlic\r\n\r\nOnions for catsup need not be carefully peeled, as a little peeling will\r\nnot impart any foreign taste. It is well, however, to remove that part\r\nof the peeling which is dry and comes off easily. The finishing machine\r\nwill remove that portion of the peeling which is left.\r\n\r\nThe sweet Bermuda onions are not as good for catsup as are the stronger\r\nkind, as it takes too many of them to impart a distinct onion flavor.\r\nThe onions should, of course, be washed if they are not clean when taken\r\nfrom the sack. Some firms use an onion washing and peeling machine and\r\nthey like the machine very much. A coarse grinding of the onions is\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nSome packers use garlic and some do not. Garlic is treated in exactly\r\nthe same way as onions but should be ground rather fine. The cloves of\r\nthe garlic should be removed from the enveloping tissue, but it is not\r\nnecessary to separate the individual cloves from the hard, fibrous\r\ncoating which surrounds them.\r\n\r\nOnions and garlic should be added as soon as all of the tomato juice for\r\nthe batch is boiling in the kettle. For a 100 gallon batch, two gallons\r\nof chopped onions and ½ lb. of ground garlic are about the right\r\namounts. Ground onions and garlic should not be left standing over\r\nnight, as they get black and lose their flavor. In cases where some are\r\nunavoidably left over, they should be covered with vinegar and salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Sugars\r\n\r\nThe sugars most commonly used in catsup are granulated cane, clarified\r\ncane, granulated beet, and raw, unrefined sugars.\r\n\r\nThe purest of these are granulated cane and granulated beet, which are\r\nequally good. There is a prejudice against beet sugar by many people in\r\nthe east, who think it is not as good as cane sugar, but this is a\r\nmistaken idea. Any food chemist will tell you that they are the same,\r\nand are equally good. All granulated sugar, whether cane or beet, must\r\ncontain at least 99.5% of sucrose (pure sugar) to comply with the\r\nfederal standard. And remember that sucrose is sucrose, whether derived\r\nfrom sugar cane or sugar beet. Almost all granulated sugar will test\r\n99.8% sucrose, which is slightly above the minimum established by the\r\ngovernment. This leaves a negligible quantity of impurities, which in\r\nthe case of beet sugar are derived from the beet, and in cane sugar from\r\nthe cane. If there is any difference between the two sugars it lies in\r\nthis very minute quantity of impurities and such a difference can surely\r\nnot be objected to. Granulated sugar, whether cane or beet, is the\r\npurest food article in commerce.\r\n\r\nClarified cane sugar is not quite as pure as granulated, but when used\r\nin catsup will make equally as good a product as granulated will;\r\nhowever, as the percentage of sucrose is not so high, a little more of\r\nit has to be used. A considerable saving can often be made by buying\r\nclarified instead of granulated sugar, but the purchase should be made\r\non polariscope test, so the buyer knows exactly what he is getting.\r\n\r\nRaw sugars are slightly less pure than clarified, although there is very\r\nlittle difference between the best grades of raw sugar and clarified.\r\nGood centrifugal raw sugar will contain about 96.5% of sucrose. The\r\nlower grades of raw sugars should not be used, as they are dark and will\r\ndarken the catsup to some extent, but there is scarcely any color to the\r\nbetter grades, and they give good results. The use of raw sugars often\r\npermits quite a saving on the sugar bill. They should be bought on\r\npolariscope test, and when received should be tested against the sample\r\non which they were bought.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Sugar Syrups\r\n\r\n“Cane sugar syrups” have for several years been offered to canners and\r\npreservers, and they are advertised to be equal pound for pound to\r\ngranulated sugar and to be considerably cheaper. The samples of these\r\nheavy, colorless syrups that I have tested have contained a considerable\r\npercentage of invert sugar, and also moisture. The moisture is, of\r\ncourse, worthless, and as the invert sugar is less sweet than sucrose it\r\nis ridiculous to claim that such a product is equal in sweetness to\r\ngranulated sugar. These syrups are said to be used by some catsup\r\nmakers, however the saving that is effected by their use is probably\r\nimaginary.\r\n\r\nThe sugar can be added at any time after all the tomato juice for the\r\nbatch is boiling in the kettle. Some prefer to add it at the end of the\r\nbatch so as to run less danger of scorching; however, if the coils are\r\nclean, and there is a good head of steam, and the taps are working\r\nright, there need be no fear of burning, even if the sugar is added\r\ntwenty minutes before the batch is done. The sugar should be put in\r\nsmall pails or boxes, so that it can be scattered easily over the\r\nsurface of the boiling pulp. If it is put in heavy containers it is apt\r\nto be dumped in one spot, and may not all dissolve, as much of it may\r\nfall in a lump below the coil where the circulation is not good.\r\n\r\nIf the coils or traps are not working properly, or the tomatoes are a\r\nlittle green, and the cook is having trouble with the catsup burning on\r\nthe coils badly, it is advisable to not add the sugar until a few\r\nminutes before the batch is done.\r\n\r\nIf 10½ gallons of 100 grain vinegar are used to a 100–gallon batch,\r\nabout 105 pounds of granulated sugar will be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Use of Sugar in Large Quantities\r\n\r\nIt should not be thought that extra sugar is going to increase the\r\nvolume of catsup in proportion to the volume of extra sugar added. I am\r\nreminded in this connection of a conversation I had with a large catsup\r\npacker, in which we were discussing the large amount of sugar and\r\nvinegar required to insure the keeping quality of non-preservative\r\ncatsup, as compared with the amounts usually used in benzoate goods.\r\nThis packer made non-preservative goods altogether, and he surprised me\r\nby remarking: “What if we do have to use a hundred pounds or so more\r\nsugar to the batch; we buy the sugar at 8c a pound, and sell it for\r\nabout 11c a pound in catsup. Where do we lose anything?” I was surprised\r\nat the remark because I thought he should know better than that. If\r\ncatsup was bought and sold by weight that argument might hold good.\r\nHowever, regardless of the fact that the net weight in pounds and ounces\r\navoirdupois is always stated on the label, the public buys catsup by\r\nvolume. Your pint bottle may hold 17 oz. avoirdupois, or it may hold 18\r\noz; however, in the eyes of the consumer it is a pint, and it will not\r\nbring more money because its net weight is slightly greater than that in\r\nthe pint size of some other brand. It is the same way with the 10 oz.\r\nand 11 oz. sizes. The public buys by volume. When we quote prices on the\r\nlarger sizes, it is so many dozen No. 10 at so much per dozen, or so\r\nmany dozen gallon jars at so much per gallon. Who cares what the net\r\nweight is in the No. 10 can, or the gallon jar, as long as the container\r\nis full—or as full as it should be?\r\n\r\nTherefore, the subject of gain or loss caused by the addition of extra\r\nsugar resolves itself into the question of the additional volume\r\nproduced. If I add a hundred pounds more of sugar per batch, how much\r\nwill my volume be increased? That is the question. It is one which I\r\ncannot answer definitely, and I have never seen any figures on it, but I\r\ncan say this much—that every pound of sugar added to catsup in excess of\r\nthe minimum amount required is a very great loss to the packer. A 5–gal.\r\npail of granulated sugar will not add anywhere near five gallons to the\r\ncatsup. One gallon will come nearer to it. The reason for this is that\r\nthe sugar dissolves in the tomato juice, and although it increases the\r\nspecific gravity of that juice, it adds very little to its volume.\r\n\r\nAs to the extra vinegar which must be added to counteract the sweetness\r\nof this extra sugar, this is an absolute loss as far as volume is\r\nconcerned. The catsup must be reduced to a definite thickness, no matter\r\nhow much vinegar is used, and if more vinegar is used, more water must\r\nbe boiled out to allow for the thinning down caused by this additional\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  Salt\r\n\r\nAn air dried salt of a fair degree of purity (about 98 per cent on a\r\nmoisture-free basis) is perfectly satisfactory for catsup. The purer\r\nsalts are often desirable in the canning of vegetables where lime and\r\nmagnesia are apt to have a toughening or hardening effect, but in catsup\r\na very small quantity of lime and magnesia salts have no ill effect.\r\n\r\nSalt should be added a few minutes before the vinegar is put in. It is\r\ndesirable to add the salt toward the end of the cooking, as it acts to\r\nsome extent on the copper of the coil or kettle. Great care should be\r\nused in so adding the salt that it will all dissolve. I have often seen\r\na large mass of undissolved salt in the bottom of a cooking tank after a\r\nbatch of catsup was let down, even when the salt had been thrown in a\r\nhalf hour before the cooking was completed. The reason for this was that\r\nthe salt was thrown in without scattering it, and it fell quickly to the\r\nbottom of the tank in one mass. Owing to the fact that the circulation\r\nbelow the coil was poor, and that salt does not dissolve readily in\r\nboiling water or boiling tomato juice, a large proportion of it remained\r\nundissolved.\r\n\r\nSalt is less soluble in hot water than in cold water. It should be\r\nplaced in small containers, such as small pails or boxes, so that it\r\nwill be light in weight and can easily be scattered over the surface of\r\nthe boiling pulp. If this is done, and done slowly, there is no need of\r\nagitating devices to dissolve the salt. Agitators are also unnecessary\r\nto dissolve the sugar if it is added in this way, although sugar\r\ndissolves more readily than salt.\r\n\r\nThirty pounds of salt is about the right amount for a 100–gallon batch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Vinegar\r\n\r\nThe kind of vinegar usually used in catsup is the strong distilled\r\nvinegar—about 100 grain, which contains 10 per cent of acetic acid. The\r\nstronger the vinegar, the better, as the weaker vinegars require too\r\nmuch volume to be handled, and dilute the catsup too much when they are\r\nadded.\r\n\r\nMost manufacturers buy their vinegar in barrels. However, some of the\r\nlarger ones have it shipped in tank cars from which it is pumped at the\r\nfactory into a large storage tank, and siphoned off as needed. This is\r\nthe better way when it is used in large enough quantities to warrant\r\nbuying it in this manner. Barreled vinegar often contains very finely\r\ndivided charcoal, which is sometimes hard to strain out; the barrels are\r\noften full of nails from which the vinegar dissolves iron, and this\r\niron, in combination with the tannic acid of spices, produces a chemical\r\ncompound (iron tannate) which is as black as ink; and sometimes the\r\nbarrels contain some foreign liquid, which was left in them when they\r\nwere filled with vinegar. The use of barrels also requires a lot of\r\nhandling, and the waste by evaporation through the wood is considerable\r\nwhen the vinegar is held over a long time. One might imagine that the\r\nevaporation from a large storage tank would be greater than from\r\nbarrels. However, such is not the case, as there is much more surface\r\nper gallon for evaporation in the barrel than in the large tank. Vinegar\r\nshipped in tank cars is free from contamination and is easily and\r\neconomically handled. Barreled vinegar should always be strained through\r\nfine cheesecloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Transference of Vinegar\r\n\r\nThe use of steam pumps and ejectors, in fact any kind of steam appliance\r\nfor hoisting vinegar, should not be used, as the steam passes into the\r\nvinegar, dissolves in it, and dilutes it. If you pump 100–grain vinegar\r\ninto a storage tank with a steam pump you may find that you have\r\n90–grain when you get it up there. If it is necessary to pump the\r\nvinegar, and it usually is, a small electric pump should be used. Either\r\nenamel lined or wooden pipe should be used for vinegar. All iron pipe\r\nand fittings should be eliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Adding the Vinegar\r\n\r\nVinegar should be added about three minutes before the batch is done. To\r\ndo this it is usually necessary to cook the catsup just a shade heavier\r\nbefore the vinegar is added than it will be when it is done. If a\r\nhydrometer is used, about two degrees is enough. Five minutes should be\r\nthe outside limit for cooking the vinegar. Vinegar is a volatile liquid\r\nand vaporizes rapidly. It should therefore only be cooked long enough to\r\ninsure its being thoroughly incorporated in the catsup, and three\r\nminutes boiling is ample for this purpose. For a 100–gallon batch, 10½\r\ngallons of 100 grain vinegar is about the right amount, and when\r\nproperly added will give an average total acidity of about 1.25 per cent\r\ncalculated as acetic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Acidity\r\n\r\nIt should be understood that this total acidity will by no means be\r\nconstant, as there is such a great variation in the natural acidity of\r\ntomatoes. Tomato pulp made from tomatoes all grown in the same locality,\r\nand condensed to a specific gravity of 1.035, will run as low as 0.40\r\nper cent in natural acidity, and as high as 0.70 per cent. This will\r\ncause the total acidity of the catsup to vary accordingly. When in doubt\r\nas to whether you are getting the proper acidity, send samples to a\r\nchemist and have the acetic acidity determined. This is the acidity of\r\nthe vinegar alone. It should not run below 0.60 per cent. This figure\r\nshould be taken as the absolute minimum for acetic acidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Testing the Finishing Point\r\n\r\nFor testing the finishing point of catsup I recommend either testing by\r\nthe eye or the hydrometer method as described under the testing of pulp.\r\nThe eye cannot often be relied upon, although some experienced cooks are\r\nvery good at judging by the eye, and they do not need a mechanical\r\ndevice of any kind. The specific gravity determination by weight, and\r\ncooking to a certain gauge, or for a certain length of time, will not do\r\nat all for catsup. I have used the hydrometer method on catsup for a\r\nnumber of years, and it is entirely satisfactory. A little experimenting\r\nwill indicate the number of degrees on the hydrometer, when immersed in\r\nthe hot catsup, at which the catsup is heavy enough so that it will be\r\nof the right thickness when cold. After this point has been determined\r\nevery batch should be almost exactly alike if it is cooked to this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Holding Batches\r\n\r\nCatsup should not be held in the cooking kettle very long, as the sugar\r\nis apt to caramelize where the catsup is in contact with the hot surface\r\nof the kettle or coil. Also, the air darkens it somewhat. Of course, if\r\nthe jacket or coil is completely exhausted, and the valves are\r\nabsolutely tight, there should not be this burning or caramelization\r\nwhile holding a batch. However, there is often a very slight leak in the\r\nvalve, and the coil or jacket is thus kept hot constantly. The quicker\r\nthe cooked batch is let out of the kettle, the better.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Making Catsup From Pulp\r\n\r\nMany catsup makers make their catsup from pulp altogether. They feel\r\nthat during the season they have their hands full packing pulp, and they\r\ncan work this pulp up into catsup during the winter months when there\r\nwould otherwise be little or nothing to do. When pulp is used, about 29\r\n5–gal. cans of specific gravity 1.035 is sufficient for a batch of\r\ncatsup of 100 gallons. Do not add water to the pulp, even if it is a\r\nlittle heavy. The only danger from not getting a very long cook is that\r\nthere will not be a very complete extraction of the spices, when whole\r\nspices are used in a sack. If, however, each spice bag is cooked in two\r\nbatches, this danger is greatly minimized.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises—if I am making catsup from pulp which has been\r\nput through a catsup finisher I am working with material which is\r\nscreened fine, whereas my hydrometer test is based on tomato juice from\r\nmy cyclone, which is coarser than this, and this finely screened stuff\r\nwill give me a different hydrometer reading. If you cook your catsup to,\r\nsay, 32 degrees, when making it direct from cycloned tomato juice, you\r\nwill probably find that 28 degrees is enough when making it from pulp\r\nwhich has been put through a catsup finisher. The finisher makes this\r\nmuch difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Use of Benzoate of Soda\r\n\r\nThe use of benzoate of soda in catsup permits of the use of a much\r\nsmaller quantity of vinegar and sugar than is used in non-preservative\r\ngoods. About 3 gallons of 100 grain vinegar to a 100–gallon batch is all\r\nthat is usually used, and this only makes it necessary to use about 50\r\nlbs. of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe benzoate of soda is added just about a minute before the batch is\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that if ⅒th of 1% of benzoate of soda is being\r\nused, this percentage is by weight, and that a gallon of cold catsup\r\nweighs 9 or 9½ lbs., depending upon the amount of sugar that is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n        FINISHING, BOTTLING, STERILIZING, AND STORING THE CATSUP\r\n\r\n\r\n                    The Receiving Tank and Finisher\r\n\r\nFrom the cooking kettles the catsup is usually run through the finisher,\r\nand then conducted to a receiving tank, either by gravity or by pumping.\r\nIf a pump is used, care should be taken that the pump parts which come\r\nin contact with the catsup are of bronze. Needless to say, enamel lined\r\npipe should be used. The receiving tank should be either of wood, or\r\nenamel, or glass-lined steel.\r\n\r\nRegarding the finishing of the catsup, the action on the metal screen is\r\nmore severe than in pulp, and it is best to use a monel metal screen. It\r\nwill usually be noticed that the frothy catsup which collects at the\r\nlarge end of the cone of the screen blackens quickly. This is probably\r\ndue to the air, and this catsup should be scraped off into a pail as it\r\ncollects, and mixed back in the cooking kettle, just giving it a minute\r\ncook. It is also very important to see that the screen fits absolutely\r\ntight, and to frequently inspect it for small cuts which are often made\r\nby pieces of tin or glass accidentally getting into the catsup.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Filling and Sealing\r\n\r\nIf the catsup is to be sterilized after bottling it is usually just run\r\nthrough an ordinary enamel lined pipe from the receiving tank to the\r\nfilling machine, but if it is not to be given an after-sterilization a\r\nsteam-jacketed pipe should be used here. This will be discussed further\r\nlater in the chapter.\r\n\r\nRotary fillers are being used quite commonly for catsup now, and they do\r\nthe work rapidly, with little waste, and with a small labor outlay per\r\ngross for bottling. The more simple types of fillers, operated either\r\nwith a foot or hand lever, are less expensive, and also do the work\r\nquite well, although not as rapidly as the rotary fillers.\r\n\r\nThe empty bottles should be washed in hot water on a rotary bottle\r\nwashing machine, and filled directly after washing if an\r\nafter-sterilization is to be used. If the catsup is not to be processed\r\nafter bottling, the empty bottles should be given a hot air\r\nsterilization after they are washed, and the bottles conducted to the\r\nfilling machine from the sterilizer.\r\n\r\nIf an automatic rotary filler is used, the bottle capping machine is\r\nusually regulated to operate at the same speed as the filler, and the\r\nwhole line becomes automatic. The type of closure most commonly used now\r\nis the crown style, either plain or of the self-opening type. The cork\r\nis getting to be a thing of the past for catsup. These closures come\r\neither with a composition cork insert or with a solid cork insert, the\r\nformer being a little cheaper, and for catsup it is just as good. For\r\nchili sauce, or any bottle having a wide mouth, I do not like the\r\ncomposition cork insert, as the vacuum produced in a wide-mouthed bottle\r\non cooling is too great a strain on the composition, and is apt to cause\r\nit to crack. For narrow-mouthed bottles such as catsup, the composition\r\ncork is all right.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Washing the Filled Bottles\r\n\r\nWhether or not an after-sterilization is used, the filled bottles should\r\nbe run through a warm water bath immediately after sealing to wash off\r\nany catsup which adheres to the outside of the bottle before it has a\r\nchance to bake on. If this water bath has a couple of jets of compressed\r\nair entering it to keep the water vigorously agitated, the bottles will\r\ncome out nice and clean. Of course, a continuous flow of clean water\r\nmust be allowed to pass into the bath, with an overflow at the opposite\r\nend. If bottles of catsup are put into processing tanks with catsup\r\nadhering to the outside of the bottle, the soluble part of the catsup\r\nwill be dissolved in the process water but there will be flakes of\r\ninsoluble tomato fiber floating in the process water everywhere, and\r\nthese will bake on the bottles so hard that it is very hard to remove.\r\nAfter a few days this condition in the process tanks becomes very bad,\r\nand the bottles become increasingly hard to clean. If the bottles are\r\nclean when they are put into the tanks, and the tanks are clean, they\r\nwill come out of the tanks clean and ready to be labeled.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Processing\r\n\r\nThe process method is probably used by the majority of catsup packers,\r\nfirst, because they feel that an after-sterilization is an insurance\r\nwhich is well worth paying for, and they can have more peace of mind\r\nknowing that they have processed their goods; second, because by\r\nprocessing carefully and intelligently the color and flavor of their\r\ngoods will be scarcely effected, except when made from pulp which is a\r\nlittle overcooked; third, because they don’t know much about packing\r\ncatsup so that it will keep without processing, and they don’t care to\r\nexperiment, as they feel that in the end the experimenting may prove\r\ndisastrous to their business.\r\n\r\nIn this attitude no one can blame them. There is nothing more trying on\r\na manufacturer than having complaints on fermentation coming in from\r\nevery corner of the country. The natural inclination is to let well\r\nenough alone, and take no chances.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must be admitted that thousands of cases of catsup\r\nare being manufactured every day without processing, and it is giving\r\nlittle or no trouble. Those who use this system say it is a waste of\r\ntime and money to process, and that years of experience have shown that\r\nprocessing is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Advantages of Omitting Processing\r\n\r\nThere are certain advantages in not processing. In the first place a\r\nbetter colored and flavored product is often obtained, particularly if\r\nthe catsup is made from pulp, and especially is this true if the pulp is\r\na little overcooked, and consequently a little dark in color. Then there\r\nis the advantage of the saving on labor and on steam, which is a large\r\nitem. Running a half dozen or more process tanks constantly draws\r\nheavily on the steam supply, and the processing means more handling of\r\nthe bottled product, and therefore more labor. It also means more\r\nequipment, with the floor space which this equipment takes—not only a\r\nlot of tanks, in case stationary tanks are used, but iron baskets to\r\nhold the bottles, electric or steam hoist, and trolley track. Not only\r\nthe original cost but the maintenance of this equipment is considerable.\r\nThen there is a certain amount of breakage during processing. Also,\r\nsteam must be kept up late at night for no other purpose than\r\nprocessing.\r\n\r\nWhen no after-sterilization is used all of this is done away with, and\r\nthe only equipment needed to supplant the above is a steam-jacketed pipe\r\nto conduct the catsup to the filling machine, and a continuous hot air\r\nsterilizer for the bottles, which usually consists of a vertical shaft,\r\nand takes up practically no floor space.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Process Method\r\n\r\nI will discuss in detail the process method first. The catsup should be\r\nfilled as hot as possible, and it is a good idea to use a steam-jacketed\r\npipe in this case, as well as in the non-process method, because the\r\nhotter the catsup is when bottled, the quicker the center of the bottle\r\nwill be raised to the desired temperature, and the quicker the\r\nsterilization can be accomplished. The catsup should be 180 degrees or\r\nabove when it enters the tank of the filling machine, and it should be\r\nplaced in the process tanks as soon after sealing as possible.\r\n\r\nThe process tanks may be large stationary iron tanks, or a continuous\r\npasteurizer such as is used in beer bottling plants may be used. The\r\nlatter is the better way, as it is compact, automatic, takes up very\r\nlittle floor space, and there is no danger of over-sterilization, or of\r\nscorching by leaving the bottles in the tanks after the water is drawn\r\noff, where the air cannot get at them to cool them off. The reason\r\ncontinuous pasteurizers are not used more commonly is their expense,\r\nalthough they should pay for themselves in a few years by the labor and\r\nsteam they save, it being only necessary to keep one large tank in\r\noperation instead of a half dozen or more.\r\n\r\nIf stationary tanks are used, which is usually the case, the catsup\r\nshould be taken out of them as soon as the water is drawn off, so that\r\nthe air can get at the bottles and cool them off. To leave the hot,\r\nbottled catsup in the tanks over night is almost as bad as piling a lot\r\nof hot pulp close together, the only difference being that there is a\r\nlittle more room for air circulation between the catsup bottles, but not\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Time and Temperature\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference between the time and temperature employed\r\nfor processing in different factories. Some packers process as low as\r\n170 degrees F., it is said, while others use a temperature very close to\r\nthe boiling point. In some plants pint bottles receive only a 30–minute\r\nprocess, while in others they get over an hour.\r\n\r\nThe proper time to use depends upon the temperature that can be\r\nmaintained at the filling machine, and the rapidity with which the\r\nprocessing can be done after the filling. If the packer can hold his\r\ncatsup around 180 degrees at the filler, and is so equipped, either with\r\ncontinuous pasteurizers or stationary tanks, that he can process\r\nimmediately, an hour is ample time for pints, and 45 minutes is\r\nsufficient for half-pints; other sizes accordingly. If, however, the\r\ntemperature of the catsup at the filler often falls to 170 degrees or\r\nbelow, and the catsup is filled faster than it can be processed, so that\r\nat times much of it must stand for an hour before it can get in the\r\nprocess tanks, 15 minutes additional for each size bottle had better be\r\nadded to the above.\r\n\r\nThis may seem to some packers like a long time. All one has to do to\r\nconvince himself that it is not too long is to take one of those\r\nthermometers which are made especially for determining temperatures at\r\nthe center of the bottle, and put it in a bottle of catsup while it is\r\nbeing processed, watch the mercury rise, and note the time it takes to\r\nbring the center of the bottle to the temperature of the water\r\nsurrounding it. You will find that if the water surrounding a pint\r\nbottle is 200 degrees, and the temperature at the center of the bottle\r\nis 160 degrees, it will take just about an hour to bring the catsup at\r\nthe center of the bottle up to 200 degrees.\r\n\r\nAs to the proper temperature, I do not see why as high a temperature as\r\nis possible without breaking the bottles should not be used. Why some\r\npackers process at 170 degrees or 180 degrees I do not know. They\r\ncertainly have not carefully investigated the effect of their\r\nprocessing. The temperature I prefer is six degrees below boiling. At\r\nsea level this would be 206 degrees. This temperature will not break the\r\nbottles, but the steam pipes entering the tank should be so arranged and\r\nperforated that there will be as even a distribution of steam as\r\npossible. If these pipes are not properly arranged, there is apt to be\r\nas much as 6 degrees variation in the temperature at different parts of\r\nthe tank.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I made a large number of tests to determine the number\r\nof micro-organisms that remained alive in bottled catsup after\r\nprocessing at 206 degrees F., as compared with the number which remained\r\nalive in catsup bottled from the same batch and processed at 200 degrees\r\nF. for the same length of time. The difference was surprising. I\r\nexpected some difference, but not nearly as great as was shown by the\r\ntests. That which was processed at 200 degrees for an hour contained\r\nquite a few living molds, yeasts, and bacteria per cubic centimeter.\r\nThis was shown by plating out samples bacteriologically on culture\r\nmedia—the media used being dextrose agar and wart agar. The catsup from\r\nthe same batch processed one hour at 206 degrees contained scarcely any\r\nliving micro-organisms at all per cubic centimeter. This test was\r\nrepeated a number of times with the same result each time. These\r\nmicro-organisms may have been in the form of spores in the catsup, but\r\ndeveloped into the vegetative forms of molds, yeasts, and bacteria when\r\nplaced in the culture media.\r\n\r\n\r\n             Temperature Controlling and Recording Devices\r\n\r\nThe process tanks should all be equipped with temperature controllers\r\nand recording thermometers. The controller holds the steam at the right\r\npoint, not allowing the temperature to vary more than 2 degrees, if it\r\nis a good make. Several years ago it was impossible to find a\r\ntemperature controller which operated without compressed air that would\r\nhold the temperature closer than a variation of 10 degrees, which is too\r\nwide a variation for catsup pasteurization. The compressed air\r\ncontrollers worked very well but required an air compressor where the\r\npressure must be held within certain limits, and air pipes to connect\r\nwith all the controllers. Some plants did not have the air equipment,\r\nand in cases where it was put in the pipes gave more or less trouble due\r\nto the collection of moisture in them and to occasional grains of dust\r\nor rust from the air tank which lodged in the controller and threw it\r\noff. It is now possible, however, to obtain controllers which will\r\noperate with almost no variation from the temperature desired, and which\r\nrequire no compressed air for their proper functioning. Under these\r\nconditions there is hardly an excuse for a manufacturer to operate his\r\nplant on the old system of hand control of the steam valves, with the\r\nresulting losses in manufactured goods due to pure reliance on human\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nThe recording thermometer makes a pen and ink record on a chart showing\r\nthe temperature and length of time each tank of catsup is given, or, if\r\na continuous pasteurizer is used, it shows up any variations in the\r\ntemperature of the water in that pasteurizer during the day. The factory\r\nmanager can look at all of these charts in the morning, and know\r\npositively that every bottle of catsup was processed the right length of\r\ntime, and at the right temperature. If any mistakes were made the chart\r\nwill show it, and it will show at just what time the mistake was made,\r\nand how serious it was. It is a great satisfaction to have such a\r\nrecord, and the processor invariably takes great pride in making a\r\nperfect chart.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Non-Process Method\r\n\r\nWhen no after-sterilization is given, it is imperative that the catsup\r\nbe very hot when filled. Boiling catsup runs about 214 degrees F. in\r\ntemperature, and although running it through the finisher and receiving\r\ntank cools it down somewhat, if it is heated in a long jacketed pipe\r\nwhile being conveyed from receiving tank to filling machine it should\r\nnot be below 180 degrees at the very lowest when filled, and if it can\r\nbe filled hotter than that, so much the better. As to the pipe above\r\nmentioned, the smaller the pipe, and the larger the steam jacket, and\r\nthe higher the steam pressure, the greater will be the heating capacity\r\nof this jacket on the catsup. After a little experimenting these points\r\ncan be adjusted to give the proper result. If the jacketed area is\r\nshort, of course a higher steam pressure must be used than if this area\r\nis long.\r\n\r\nSome packers of non-processed catsup use a jacketed tank or kettle\r\ndirectly over the filling machine to hold the catsup at a high\r\ntemperature while it is awaiting bottling, with a very short line of\r\nenamel pipe going from it to the filling machine. If this is used, a\r\njacketed pipe is not needed.\r\n\r\nGuesswork should be eliminated. Do not assume that you are getting the\r\nright temperature on your catsup when it is filled, and do not be\r\nsatisfied with going up to the filler once or twice a day, dropping a\r\nthermometer in the liquid, and waiting for the temperature to record\r\nitself. Put a recording thermometer in that tank just over the filling\r\ntubes, with the dial in a prominent place, so that you can step up to it\r\nat any time and know what the exact temperature of that catsup has been\r\nevery minute of the time for the past ten or twelve hours.\r\n\r\nIf this is done there is no chance of escape on the part of the man who\r\nis supposed to watch this temperature, and if he knows his work is being\r\nrecorded every minute on a chart he is going to be mighty careful.\r\n\r\nThe empty bottles, when placed in the filling machine, should be clean\r\nand practically sterile. After they have passed around the rotary bottle\r\nwasher, and had a thorough washing with hot water, they are placed in\r\nthe hot air sterilizer neck down, so they can drain. The best kind of\r\nsterilizer is an endless chain carrying trays to hold about a dozen\r\nbottles each, and enclosed and protected by either wood or metal. The\r\nsterilizer should be vertical, so that it will not occupy much floor\r\nspace, and inside of the wood or metal covering are steam pipes fitted\r\nwith a temperature controller or thermostat so that a temperature of\r\nabout 250 degrees F. can be maintained. The speed of the endless chain\r\nis so regulated that it takes about 30 minutes from the time the bottles\r\nenter the sterilizer until they come out.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the filling machine should be kept scrupulously clean,\r\nand before being used in the morning, or for the afternoon run, should\r\nbe thoroughly steamed out so that it will be hot and practically sterile\r\nto receive the first batch of catsup.\r\n\r\nAs to the bottle closures, if they are kept in covered barrels in a\r\nclean place and not allowed to be contaminated by dust, etc., it is not\r\nconsidered necessary to sterilize them, although they could no doubt be\r\ngiven a hot air sterilization very easily if it was thought necessary. I\r\nhave seen thousands of cases packed without sterilizing the closures,\r\nand the catsup never gave any trouble.\r\n\r\nAfter applying the closure the bottles are rinsed off in a warm water\r\nbath, and are then ready to be labeled and cased.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Which Method Is the Better?\r\n\r\nNow comes the question which is of vital importance to every packer—what\r\nam I going to do—give my catsup an after-sterilization or not? I believe\r\nthe answer to that question should depend upon the conditions under\r\nwhich the packer operates. I do not believe either method is to be\r\nrecommended universally, but that there are many cases where it is\r\nbetter not to process, and other cases where processing is advisable.\r\n\r\nIf a manufacturer makes his product at a large central plant, where he\r\ncan count on reliable and fairly intelligent help at all times, and\r\nwhere he is so equipped that he is not bothered with frequent breakdowns\r\nand delays during the day’s run, he should give the non-processing\r\nmethod his careful consideration, and I believe he will profit by\r\nadopting it. If, on the other hand, he has many plants scattered all\r\nover the country, many of them dependent to a large extent on an\r\nindifferent class of help, with little experience or intelligence, or he\r\nhas a lot of wornout equipment, and has several breakdowns almost every\r\nday in the bottling department, he had better insure his product by\r\nprocessing.\r\n\r\nIf I were building a new plant or remodeling an old one, I would most\r\ncertainly arrange to eliminate processing if I could count on a fairly\r\ngood class of help.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Labeling and Casing\r\n\r\nMost bottles are labeled by machine. The machines do the work much\r\nfaster than can be done by hand, and also do it neater as a rule.\r\nHowever, in most cases it is necessary to have someone to adjust the\r\nneck band after the bottle leaves the machine. Sometimes they are\r\nwrapped, and sometimes not. Wrapping in transparent tissue makes a very\r\nattractive package, and it will modify the effect of strong light, which\r\nsome manufacturers think has a discoloring tendency if the catsup is\r\nexposed to it a long time.\r\n\r\nBoth wood and fiber cases are used for catsup, and the fiber cases seem\r\nto do all right where the contents do not weigh over about 40 lbs. If\r\nthey weigh more than that it is usually considered advisable to use wood\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Stacking Catsup to Avoid “Black Neck”\r\n\r\nIn CHAPTER VIII mention was made of the darkening in the neck of the\r\nbottle, called “black neck.” It was stated that this was usually due to\r\nthe fact that the closure is not absolutely air tight, and allows the\r\nair to very slowly filter into the space in the neck, which should be a\r\nvacuum if the seal is perfectly tight. This condition can be partly\r\navoided by printing the cases so that when the case is stacked right\r\nside up the catsup will be neck down in the case. Therefore, the vacuum\r\nspace will be at the bottom of the bottle, instead of at the neck, and\r\nthere is no chance for air to filter into the neck because the body of\r\nthe catsup is right up against the closure. When these cases are shipped\r\nout and stacked in a warehouse, the catsup will always be bottom up as\r\nlong as the cases are right side up. In all probability the bottles will\r\nremain in this position until the case is unpacked by the retailer and\r\nthe bottles are placed on the shelves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Packing Gallons and No. 10’s\r\n\r\nPacking catsup in gallon glass jars and enamel lined No. 10 cans is very\r\nsimilar to packing it in bottles. These sizes can either be processed or\r\nnot processed, and the same principles apply as in packing the smaller\r\nsizes. If no process is given, the containers should be put through a\r\nhot air sterilizer, just as the small bottles are, and the catsup should\r\nbe very hot when filled.\r\n\r\nWith glass jars the breakage is often very great, and they must be\r\nheated slowly and carefully, and placed on a warm wooden surface when\r\nthey are filled. A metal surface beneath the jars will almost always\r\ncause a lot of breakage due to the fact that it chills so easily. For\r\nthe closure a cork is usually used, and the process should not exceed\r\n180 degrees, as a higher temperature will cause the corks to pop out. A\r\nprocess of two hours is sufficient for gallon jars.\r\n\r\nIf No. 10 catsup is given an after-sterilization, 1½ hours in boiling\r\nwater is sufficient. It must be understood that it takes much longer for\r\nthe heat to penetrate to the center of a can of catsup than it does with\r\npulp, as the catsup contains sugar and salt and is heavier in specific\r\ngravity. After-sterilization the cans should be cooled gradually in\r\nwater, and allowed to remain in the water until they only have\r\nsufficient heat left to allow the water to evaporate from the surface of\r\nthe can and prevent rusting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n   THE MANUFACTURE OF CHILI SAUCE AND THE PULPING OF TOMATO TRIMMINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nChili sauce is the finest tomato product manufactured. It differs from\r\ncatsup in that it is made from whole peeled tomatoes with the seeds and\r\nfiber left in, and in that it usually contains more onion than catsup,\r\nand is usually a little “hotter.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Grading the Tomatoes\r\n\r\nFor chili sauce the tomatoes are peeled as they are for canning. As a\r\nrule they are run over a grader and only the large ones are used for\r\npeeling, the small ones being pulped or made into catsup. It does not\r\npay to peel the small tomatoes, as it requires too much labor, and the\r\nwomen who do the peeling at so much per bucket try to fight shy of them,\r\nand often mash them up in their buckets to avoid having to peel them.\r\nThey will make just as good pulp or catsup as the large tomatoes will,\r\nand much more can be got out of them in this way than if an attempt is\r\nmade to get them peeled.\r\n\r\nSometimes the small tomatoes and the peelings of the large tomatoes are\r\npulped together. If this is done the whole small tomatoes tone up the\r\nflavor of the peelings, and also help to keep the final product within\r\nsafe limits as to microscopical count.\r\n\r\nSome packers throw away the peelings, either because they are so busy\r\nwith the whole tomatoes that they can’t bother with them, or because\r\nthey are afraid the pulp which they are worked up into will run high in\r\nmicro-organisms, and they don’t want to have such pulp on their hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Method of Handling Tomatoes\r\n\r\nThe usual method of handling the tomatoes is to run them first over a\r\nsorting belt, where they are inspected by several women, then over a\r\ngrader, which lets the small tomatoes fall through on to a belt which\r\nconveys them to a washing arrangement, and thence to the “breaking\r\ntanks,” or to the pulp machine, or the crusher, depending upon which\r\npulping method is used. The small tomatoes may or may not be given a\r\nsecond sorting.\r\n\r\nIf the trimmings are to be thrown away, the large tomatoes don’t need to\r\nbe sorted, as the peelers will take care of that, and in this case a\r\ngood way is to put all the tomatoes through a rotary washer first, then\r\nover a grader, and have the small tomatoes carefully sorted after the\r\ngrading is done. The large tomatoes pass from the grader to the scalder,\r\nand thence to the peeling table or “merry-go-round,” where they are\r\npeeled.\r\n\r\nThe best method to use if the trimmings are to be pulped will be\r\ndiscussed later in the chapter.\r\n\r\nThe peeled tomatoes are thrown into a cutting machine which cuts them\r\ninto good-sized chunks, and drops them on a bucket conveyor which takes\r\nthem to the cooking kettles. The cutter should be so adjusted that it\r\nwill not make the tomatoes mushy. A few fair-sized pieces of tomato in a\r\nbottle of chili sauce is nearly always pleasing to the consumer.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the peeling be thorough. Each bucket should be\r\ninspected before the tomatoes are thrown into the chopper. Pieces of\r\npeeling in chili sauce are very noticeable when the product is used, and\r\nmake an unfavorable impression.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Amount of Tomatoes and Onions\r\n\r\nIt takes just about 72 fourteen-quart buckets of peeled tomatoes of\r\naverage firmness to make 100 gallons of finished chili sauce. For this\r\nsame amount about 100 lbs. of chopped onions should be used. The onions\r\nshould be very carefully peeled, and very finely chopped. If this\r\nchopping is not done fine enough the pieces of onion will stop up the\r\ntubes of the filling machine. It is best to use only large onions for\r\nchili sauce, as it takes a great many women to peel the required amount\r\nif small ones are used, and the waste on the small ones is considerable\r\nwhen the peeling must be done so thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe cooking is carried out the same as in catsup, and the same\r\ningredients are used, with the possible exception of garlic, which, so\r\nfar as I know, is not often used in chili sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 Spices\r\n\r\nThe spicing is very similar to catsup. In some brands about twice as\r\nmuch cayenne is used as was suggested for catsup, while other brands are\r\nspiced mildly. One of the best liked brands on the market is quite mild,\r\nand another brand which is equally popular is quite hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Salt, Sugar and Vinegar\r\n\r\nThe same amounts of salt and vinegar are used as in catsup, and they are\r\nadded in exactly the same manner. About 10 lbs. more of sugar is needed\r\nfor a 100–gallon batch than is used in catsup. This is probably\r\nnecessitated by the large amount of onions used.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Testing Finishing Point\r\n\r\nTesting the point at which the cooking is completed must be done by the\r\neye. The hydrometer can not be used, as chili sauce is too lumpy. A\r\nhydrometer can only be used when the product is smooth and homogeneous.\r\nBy a little experience the cook will soon learn to judge the finishing\r\npoint. It is that point at which very little water runs from the lumps\r\nof tomatoes when the chili sauce is hot, and practically no free water\r\nshows when a little of it is cooled in a saucepan. In my opinion the\r\nfinishing point of chili sauce is easier to judge by the eye than it is\r\non catsup.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Filling, Sealing, and Sterilizing\r\n\r\nAs to filling, sealing, sterilizing or not sterilizing, labeling,\r\nstacking, etc., the same remarks apply to chili sauce as to catsup. The\r\nfilling is somewhat more difficult, as the product is lumpy, and a\r\nspecial filling tube must be used. As to whether an automatic rotary\r\nfiller similar to that used for catsup is ever used for chili sauce I do\r\nnot know. I have always filled it with one of the old style catsup\r\nfillers, using a special filling tube.\r\n\r\nOn account of the fact that a wide-mouthed bottle is used, there is even\r\nmore danger of air leakage in the neck of the bottle, causing “black\r\nneck,” than there is in catsup. It is a common sight to see chili sauce\r\nwith an inch, or even two inches, of blackening at the top of the\r\nbottle. Sometimes the very finest quality of cork is used, and then\r\nparaffin is put over that, but even then we find that this darkening is\r\nnot avoided. I recommend the same procedure here as was given when\r\ndiscussing this subject on catsup.\r\n\r\nIf a crown seal, either plain or of the self-opening type, is used as\r\nthe closure, a pure cork insert should be used. As mentioned in a\r\nprevious chapter, the composition cork insert does not work as well on\r\nwide-mouthed bottles as it does on those with a narrow mouth.\r\n\r\nThe remarks which were made on the packing of No. 10 and gallon catsup\r\nalso apply to the packing of chili sauce in these sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Microscopical Counts\r\n\r\nThe counts of molds, yeasts and spores, and bacteria in chili sauce\r\nusually run very low. I have never seen a sample that ran high in molds,\r\nand very few that ran high in the other counts. The molds seldom run\r\nhigher than 10, and counts of zero are often obtained. This is because\r\npractically all of the mold in tomatoes is on the outside and clings to\r\nthe peeling. When the peeling is removed the mold is removed. As the\r\npeeled tomatoes are usually cut and cooked immediately after they are\r\npeeled, there is very little opportunity for the multiplication of\r\nyeasts and bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Pulping the Trimmings\r\n\r\nTrimming pulp, or “skin and core,” as it is sometimes called, is made\r\nfrom that part of the tomato which is removed when the tomatoes are\r\npeeled. This consists of the peeling, with the tomato substance which\r\nclings to it, and the hard core at the stem end of the tomato.\r\n\r\nIn as much as practically all of the mold in or on the tomatoes is\r\nretained in the trimmings, it is not an easy matter to work these\r\ntrimmings up into a product which will mark up to the government\r\nrequirements, and do it economically. If the tomatoes are firm and\r\nlargely free from cracks around the stem end it is not so bad, but when\r\nthey come in badly cracked, with tufts of mold growing in all the\r\ncracks, as is often the case late in the season, the amount of labor\r\nrequired to properly sort them makes the working up of trimmings\r\nunprofitable.\r\n\r\nWhen the trimmings show up fairly well, and the labor to handle them is\r\navailable, there is no reason why the chili sauce packer or tomato\r\ncanner should not utilize what would otherwise be a waste by turning it\r\ninto pulp or “trimming catsup.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Government Attitude on Trimming Pulp\r\n\r\nThe government does not object to the manufacture of tomato products\r\nfrom trimmings, but they demand that the product comply with the\r\nregulations as to micro-organisms, and that it be sold for exactly what\r\nit is, and if put up for sale to the consuming public, that it be\r\nlabeled—“made from pieces of tomatoes,” or, “made from tomato\r\ntrimmings,” or, if small tomatoes are worked up with the trimmings,\r\n“made from small tomatoes and tomato trimmings,” or, “made from small\r\ntomatoes and pieces of tomatoes.”\r\n\r\n\r\n         Method of Handling Tomatoes When Trimmings Are Pulped\r\n\r\nIf the trimmings are to be pulped the tomatoes must be very carefully\r\nsorted, and thoroughly washed, preferably in a rotary washer. As it is\r\npractically impossible to sort or wash the trimmings, the tomatoes must\r\nbe in almost perfect condition when they enter the scalder. Washing the\r\ntrimmings carries away too much of the tomato substance which clings to\r\nthem, and sorting is not practicable, as the soft rot and mold becomes\r\nincorporated in the entire mass and it is impossible to separate it. The\r\npeelers can not be depended upon to sort out any substantial amount of\r\nrot when they do the peeling. Therefore the only thing that can be done\r\ntoward keeping down the micro-organisms is _painstaking sorting of the\r\nwhole tomatoes and thorough washing_ to keep out the mold, having the\r\nconveying equipment and tanks clean, and bringing the trimmings to a\r\nboil quickly to prevent multiplication of yeasts and bacteria. It is\r\nwise to steam out the peeling buckets and bucket conveyors at noon, as\r\nwell as at quitting time, as the juice which lies in them is constantly\r\nundergoing fermentation.\r\n\r\nWhen the trimmings are pulped, either alone or with the small tomatoes,\r\nthe tomatoes are all washed and sorted before they are graded. The\r\ntrimmings should be cooked before they are run through the pulp\r\nfinisher, so as to get all of the clinging tomato substance cooked away\r\nfrom the skin. The density to which to cook the trimmings can be judged\r\nfairly well by the eye, or the specific gravity test by weighing can be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe pulp is canned the same as whole pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n                     THE MANUFACTURE OF TOMATO SOUP\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Convenience and Economy of Canned Soup\r\n\r\nCanned tomato soup is a commodity which is increasing in favor with the\r\nhousewife. The old method of preparing this soup in the home was to open\r\na can of tomatoes, strain it through a colander, and stew it, adding\r\nbutter, salt, sugar, spices, flour, and perhaps soda and milk. The\r\nmodern way is to immerse a can of condensed tomato soup in boiling water\r\nfor five minutes, open it, and mix the contents with an equal volume of\r\nhot water or hot milk. How much more convenient the modern way is, and\r\nwhen the quality is just as good and often better than can be obtained\r\nthe long troublesome way, it is natural that canned tomato soup should\r\nbecome increasingly popular. Buying the canned soup is also cheaper than\r\nbuying the canned tomatoes and making the soup from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Factors Upon Which Success Depends\r\n\r\nThe maker of tomato soup should be a crank on quality. There is no other\r\ntomato product in which quality is at a greater premium. In catsup and\r\nchili sauce, heavy spicing and mixing with lots of vinegar and sugar\r\nhelp to mask the tomato flavor, but in soup the spicing is light, no\r\nvinegar is used, and being eaten as a food in itself, instead of as a\r\ncondiment with which to flavor a food, the palate quickly detects\r\ninferiority. Also, the palate is just as quick to detect that pleasing\r\nfresh tomato taste which should be the basis of all good soup.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the tomato stock is the real important thing. Fresh\r\ntomatoes may be used or a fine grade of pulp may be used, and either\r\nwill make an excellent soup. With poor tomato stock a good soup cannot\r\nbe made no matter what you do to it. Spicing artistically, and making\r\nrich by the use of plenty of good butter, will not make amends for poor\r\nquality of tomato stock.\r\n\r\nTo succeed in making tomato soup the manufacturer must at least make\r\ngood on the following counts: first, his soup must be palatable, that\r\nis, pleasing, to the taste with no lingering unpleasant after-taste;\r\nsecond, it must not be too sweet or too sour; third, it must be uniform\r\nin consistency, smooth when poured out of the can, and must not get\r\nlumpy or grainy after being in storage a long time; fourth, it must not\r\ncurdle fresh milk, even though the housewife adds no baking soda when\r\nmixing milk with it; fifth, it must be reasonable in price and\r\nattractively packed in popular sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Unpalatability\r\n\r\nI will discuss these points a little further. What makes tomato pulp\r\nunpalatable and what causes an unpleasant after-taste? The most common\r\ncause is poor tomato stock, or tomato stock which has been overcooked.\r\nSuch a foundation for soup will almost invariably leave a lingering\r\nunpleasant after-taste in the mouth. Another thing is too much flour,\r\nmasking the flavor of the tomato and giving it a somewhat “pasty” taste.\r\nAnother thing is the injudicious use of spices, producing unpopular\r\nflavors, or using one spice, such as bay leaves, for instance, in such\r\nlarge proportion that almost every other flavor is masked. None of these\r\ndefects are rare in tomato soups, and they all cause unpalatability to\r\nsome extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Proper Sweetness\r\n\r\nGetting proper sweetness is not nearly so easy as one might suppose. It\r\nis not so difficult when the soup is made from fresh tomatoes, although\r\neven then every batch must be tasted after all but a few pounds of the\r\nsugar is added, and the amount of sugar varied according to the\r\nsweetness of the tomatoes. When the weather is moderately dry, with\r\nplenty of sunshine, the tomatoes are usually sweet and do not require so\r\nmuch sugar, but tomatoes which ripen during rainy, dark, cold days are\r\nnot so sweet, and a little more sugar is needed.\r\n\r\nWhen making soup from canned pulp it is necessary to watch the sweetness\r\nof the pulp very close, and it may be necessary for the cook to vary the\r\nsugar on a 100–gallon batch ten or fifteen pounds during a day’s run.\r\nCanned pulp often varies greatly in sweetness, and if held in storage\r\nfor many months it often loses some of its sweetness on account of the\r\naction of living, acid forming bacteria, which may not be present in\r\nlarge amount, but nevertheless, in time, have a noticeable effect on the\r\nsweetness of the pulp.\r\n\r\nWhen pulp is purchased for the purpose of making soup its sweetness\r\nshould be one of the first considerations in passing judgment on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Gradual Souring of Pulp\r\n\r\nWhen the soup manufacturer makes his own pulp and works it up into soup\r\nduring the winter months he will probably find that he will save on his\r\nsugar bill if he will pack the pulp in No. 10 cans and sterilize it—at\r\nleast that part of the pulp which must be held in storage several\r\nmonths. In this way living, acid forming bacteria are killed, and the\r\ndanger of the pulp losing its sweetness during months of storage is\r\ngreatly minimized.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the gradual souring of pulp in 5–gal. cans, even though\r\nvery slight, is due to the action of living, acid forming bacteria can\r\nhardly be doubted. Bacteriological tests supplemented by chemical\r\nanalyses would determine the matter definitely, but there is evidence in\r\nthe experience of every canner to show that this souring is due to the\r\nfact that the pulp is not sterile.\r\n\r\nCanned tomatoes are always sterilized and can be kept in storage for\r\nyears without losing their sweetness. Pulp packed in 5–gallon cans is\r\nnot sterilized and quite a after-sterilization percentage of it will\r\nlose much of its sweetness on being stored for six months, and after\r\nbeing stored a year still more is lost. It takes hundreds of pounds of\r\nexpensive sugar to make up for this loss of sweetness when the pulp is\r\nmade into soup.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Sampling\r\n\r\nOf course, a cook is not infallible in his judgment as to just what is\r\nthe right sweetness and he needs the co-operation of others at the\r\nfactory. The factory manager should make it a point to sample the soup\r\nseveral times a day, and also to have others sample it. It is better to\r\nhave it just a little less sweet than it should be than to have it too\r\nsweet. The consumer can always add a little sugar but cannot take any\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe third point mentioned above—that of uniform consistency and\r\nsmoothness, will be discussed fully under the cooking and shaking\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Proper Acidity\r\n\r\nI stated as the fourth point that the soup should not curdle fresh milk,\r\neven though no soda is added by the housewife. One of the favorite ways\r\nof preparing canned tomato soup in the home is to mix it with an equal\r\nquantity of hot milk. The experienced housewife knows enough to add a\r\npinch of soda to the milk before adding the soup, and she may also know\r\nthat she will get a smoother mixture if she slowly pours the soup into\r\nthe milk, stirring constantly, than if she pours the milk into the soup.\r\nThe inexperienced housewife does not know these things, and often she\r\nopens the can and mixes it with milk without reading the admonition on\r\nthe label as to how the cream of tomato soup should be prepared.\r\nSometimes she forgets to add the soda, or does not thoroughly dissolve\r\nit, or does not add enough of it, and then there is disappointment. In\r\norder to guard against such disappointments the soup canner should so\r\nprepare his product that curdling of the milk cannot occur under any\r\nmethod of mixing. The way to do this is to add enough soda to the soup\r\nto reduce the acidity to a point where it will not curdle fresh milk,\r\nwhether the soup is poured into the milk or the milk into the soup. The\r\ncanner can then print a notice on the label of the can to the effect\r\nthat it is not necessary to add soda to this soup when preparing it as\r\n“cream of tomato,” as the soda is already in it.\r\n\r\nThe acidity of the tomato is the active principle which causes the milk\r\nto curdle. If this acidity runs 0.60% it will curdle the milk badly. If\r\nit is reduced to 0.50% it will still curdle the milk, but if it is\r\nreduced to 0.40% it will not curdle the milk, if the milk is fresh. The\r\naim of the soup maker should therefore be to keep the acidity of the\r\nsoup between 0.30 and 0.40%, not allowing it to go above or below these\r\nlimits. If it is reduced below 0.30% the flavor of the tomato begins to\r\nbe effected—in fact, if possible, it is best to keep the acidity between\r\n0.35 and 0.40% to avoid any possibility of loss of tomato flavor.\r\n\r\nNow, the packer will ask—“How am I going to do this acidity testing? I’m\r\nnot a chemist, and have no chemist at my factory, or any laboratory.”\r\nThe acidity test on pulp and soup is a very simple one. The equipment\r\nrequired scarcely amounts to anything, as the sample can be taken by\r\nvolume. Any chemist will be glad to show you how to make this test and\r\nto secure for you the few accessories needed.\r\n\r\nWhy is there less danger of curdling if the soup is poured into the milk\r\nthan if the milk is poured into the soup? The soup contains all the\r\nacid, and the milk contains none. If the soup is poured into the milk\r\nslowly, with stirring, the acid is slowly added to the milk, and is\r\ndiluted, there being at the beginning of the mixing a very small volume\r\nof acid and a large amount of milk. If, however, the milk is added to\r\nthe soup, a small volume of milk is at first being thrown into a large\r\nvolume of acid, and naturally the danger of curdling is considerably\r\nincreased. But if the acidity of the soup is not above 0.40% and the\r\nmilk is fresh, there will not be an appreciable amount of curdling no\r\nmatter which way the two are mixed. A statement as to the proper way of\r\nmixing with milk should be made on the label.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Price and Quality\r\n\r\nThat the soup, to be a success, must be popular in price and packed in\r\nconvenient sizes is self evident, and there is no need of dwelling on\r\nthis point. Practically all of the tomato soup on the market is packed\r\neither in the 10½ oz. or 16 oz. size, and almost all of it is cheap in\r\ncomparison with other foods, but it is a mistake to cut the quality one\r\niota in order to shade the price. The mark for quality should be set at\r\nthe highest point possible and the price to correspond. The canner may\r\nbook a lot of new business with a low price and mediocre quality but he\r\nis not likely to hold it. Almost anyone would rather pay a cent a can\r\nmore and get better quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Microscopical Counts\r\n\r\nThe first operations in soup making are the same as in pulp. The same\r\ncare must be taken in sorting and washing the tomatoes, and the\r\ngovernment authorities put soup on the same basis as other tomato\r\nproducts when it comes to microscopical analysis. The fact that soup\r\ncontains flour and butter makes the counting of yeasts, spores, and\r\nbacteria under the microscope a difficult operation. The molds, however,\r\nshow up almost as well in soup as they do in pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Beginning the Cook and Adding Soda\r\n\r\nThe tomatoes must be cycloned before they are converted into soup.\r\nCrushed tomatoes will not do. The cycloned juice for each batch is\r\nmeasured in the same manner as for catsup, and any of the types of\r\ncooking kettles that are used for catsup are satisfactory for soup. For\r\na 100 gallon batch of finished soup, using the amount of flour I am\r\ngoing to recommend, about 28 or 29 bushels of tomatoes will be required.\r\nAs soon as all of the tomato juice for the batch is boiling in the\r\ncooking kettle the soda is added. The amount of bicarbonate of soda to\r\nuse depends upon whether the soup is being made from fresh tomatoes or\r\npulp, and if made from pulp the soda should be varied according to the\r\npulp’s acidity. It is nearly always necessary to use more soda in pulp\r\nthan in fresh tomatoes, and if the pulp is old goods which has lost much\r\nof its sweetness, and in which the acid has been increased by the slow\r\nbut telling action of living bacteria, still more soda must be used.\r\n\r\nFor fresh tomatoes 18 to 20 oz. of soda is enough for a batch of 100\r\ngallons when finished, but for pulp, as high as 30 oz. may be required.\r\nIf it takes more than this to reduce the acidity of the pulp to the\r\nproper point, that pulp had better be used for some other purpose than\r\nsoup. There is a limit as to the amount of soda that can be added\r\nwithout loss of tomato flavor.\r\n\r\nThe soda is added a little at a time while the pulp or tomato juice is\r\nboiling. The cook must allow considerable room for effervescing, so that\r\nthe formation of the carbonic acid gas will not cause much of the\r\ncontents to be lost by flowing over the top of the kettle. Cutting the\r\nfoaming tomato juice with a sharp spray from the hose will help to keep\r\nthe effervescing mass down.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Butter, Spices and Onions\r\n\r\nAfter the effervescence from the addition of the soda has stopped, the\r\nbutter, spice, and onion are added. Of course, the more butter that is\r\nadded the richer the soup will be, but the idea should be to give the\r\nsoup the butter flavor without adding so much that the cost will mount\r\nup beyond a reasonable limit. I would suggest 6 or 7 lbs. of butter to\r\n100 gallons of finished soup. The butter will so thoroughly distribute\r\nitself during the boiling that every drop of the soup will contain\r\npractically the same amount. It is not necessary to use a fancy print of\r\nbutter. If the butter is a little mottled, or the salt isn’t quite as\r\nevenly incorporated in it as it should be it makes no difference, as the\r\nbutter fat and salt all become evenly distributed in the soup after\r\nboiling for a minute or two. The butter, however, should be sweet and\r\nclean. Rancid butter should not be used.\r\n\r\nSoup should not be heavily spiced, as many people do not like highly\r\nseasoned soups, and if it isn’t hot enough for some consumers they can\r\nadd as much pepper as they want to. So far as I know the spices most\r\ncommonly used are white pepper, paprika, cassia, mace, cloves, bay\r\nleaves, and celery salt. Black pepper should not be used at it makes\r\nblack specks in the soup which are apt to be mistaken for dirt. About 7\r\noz. of white pepper to 100 gallons of finished soup will give it\r\nsufficient spiciness. If paprika is used this can be cut down somewhat.\r\nCassia, mace or cloves are used in small amount, 1 oz. of either being\r\nample.\r\n\r\nPepper, cloves, and cassia are added at the beginning of the cooking and\r\nmace is added just a few minutes before the flour. It is said that\r\ncelery salt gives tomato soup a very nice flavor but I have never tried\r\nit. Some people like bay leaves, but I have tasted canned tomato soup\r\nwith a very decided bay leaf taste which I thought was about as poor as\r\nany soup I have ever tasted.\r\n\r\nThe onions are chopped the same as for catsup, and 4 lbs. is about the\r\nright amount for 100 gallons of soup.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Sugar and Salt\r\n\r\nThe sugar can be added at any time after the spices, butter, and onions,\r\nbut about 5 lbs. should be held back from the average amount being used,\r\nfiguring that we are cooking a 100 gallon batch, and after the sugar and\r\nsalt is in, the contents of the kettle should be tasted before the\r\nbalance of the sugar is added. It may be that the last 5 lbs. are not\r\nneeded, or it may be that all of it is needed and also an additional 5\r\nlbs. For fresh tomatoes about 25 or 30 lbs. of sugar may be sufficient\r\nfor a 100 gallon batch, and for pulp it may be necessary to use as much\r\nas 50 lbs. or even 60 lbs. in some cases.\r\n\r\nAfter the condensation has continued until the boiling mass is of the\r\nconsistency of thin pulp the salt is added. The same grade of salt is\r\nused as for catsup, and about 14 lbs. is the right amount. The sugar and\r\nsalt should be put in small containers or pails and scattered slowly\r\nover the surface of the boiling pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Testing Thickness Before Adding Flour\r\n\r\nNow the contents of the kettle contain all of the ingredients except the\r\nflour and the water which is mixed with the flour when it is added.\r\nBefore this flour mixture is added the contents of the kettle must be\r\ncondensed to a definite thickness. If this thickness is not measured\r\nwith a fair degree of accuracy the finished soup will either be so thick\r\nthat it will be lumpy in the can, even after shaking, or it will be so\r\nthin that the housewife is apt to feel that she is getting cheated when\r\nshe pours the soup out of the can. The object to attain should be to\r\nhave the soup as thick as the consumer could reasonably expect, but at\r\nthe same time to have it of such consistency that it will pour out of\r\nthe can easily and smoothly. Nobody wants soup that will come out of the\r\ncan like a brick, but at the same time they expect condensed soup to be\r\nreasonably thick.\r\n\r\nI prefer to gauge the point at which it is time for the flour to be\r\nadded with a hydrometer. The use of the hydrometer here is subject to\r\nthe same precautions as were described under the testing of pulp, and it\r\nis used in the same way. Whatever reading pulp of specific gravity 1.04\r\ngives on the hydrometer you use, that is the reading you should take for\r\nthe point at which to add the flour mixture on soup. If you follow this\r\nrule you will come out all right. We will say that pulp of the degree of\r\nfineness you have reads twenty degrees on your hydrometer when it is at\r\na specific gravity of 1.04. Then twenty degrees on this hydrometer is\r\nthe point at which the flour mixture should be added on soup.\r\n\r\nIt might occur to you that it would be a good idea to use the specific\r\ngravity test by weighing to determine the point at which to add the\r\nflour. This would work all right if you used the same amount of sugar\r\nall the time, but as varying quantities of sugar will vary the specific\r\ngravity without materially varying the thickness of the pulp, using the\r\nspecific gravity test by weighing at this point is apt to throw you off.\r\nThis varying amount of sugar will have a slight effect on the hydrometer\r\nreading also, but not enough to make an appreciable difference. What you\r\nreally want is to have your partially completed soup at a uniform\r\nthickness before adding the flour, rather than at a uniform specific\r\ngravity. Thickness and specific gravity do not always correspond. Tomato\r\nfiber may be very thick and still have a rather low specific gravity,\r\nand it may be thin and have a high specific gravity due to the fact that\r\nit contains added sugar in solution. For determining the point which we\r\nare trying to gauge, the hydrometer is much less apt to throw you off\r\nthe track than is a specific gravity test by weighing, as increasing\r\nthickness will change the hydrometer reading very quickly but will only\r\nalter the specific gravity slowly.\r\n\r\nWe will say that we have found out that 20 degrees on the hydrometer is\r\nthe proper point at which to add the flour mixture—that this degree of\r\nthickness, with the added thickness produced by the flour mixture,\r\nproduces a soup, which when cold and well shaken, will be thick enough,\r\nbut will also pour out of the can easily and smoothly. We test the\r\nboiling liquid several times; it runs 14 degrees, then after a few\r\nminutes 18 degrees, then 20, and it is time to add the flour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Adding Flour\r\n\r\nThe flour must be smoothly mixed with water in a flour mixer with sifter\r\nattachment. For a 100 gallon batch of soup I would recommend 40 lbs. of\r\nhard flour and 13 gallons of water. The hard flour seems to give the\r\nbest results. The water is placed in the bottom of the mixer and the\r\nmixing attachments (paddles and sifter) set in motion either by a\r\nseparate motor or by a belt from a line of shaft. The flour is then\r\npoured through the revolving sifter and is brushed through as a fine\r\npowder, which the paddles slowly work into the water without allowing\r\nlumps to form. When the total amount of flour is added to the water, and\r\nthe paddles have worked the mixture up smooth, the flour mixture is\r\nadded to the boiling contents of the kettle, either in pails or by means\r\nof enamel lined pipe running from the mixer to the cooking kettles. The\r\ncontents of the kettle should be at a vigorous boil when the flour is\r\nadded, and the flour mixture should not be thrown in so fast that it\r\nwill kill the boil. During this process the boiling mass should be\r\nstirred vigorously with a long paddle. After all the flour is in the\r\nkettle the boil is continued for ten minutes, after which time the batch\r\nof soup is done and ready to be let down into the finishing machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Filling and Processing\r\n\r\nFrom the finisher it is conducted to a receiving tank, and thence to the\r\nfilling machine. A large volume of soup should not be kept ahead in the\r\nreceiving tank as it cools and may get somewhat lumpy. The hotter it is\r\ncanned, the better, and it should be placed in the process tanks\r\nimmediately after canning.\r\n\r\nIt is usually canned in No. 1, 16 oz., and No. 10 cans, and is filled\r\nwith a rotary filling machine of the type used for heavy liquids.\r\n\r\nIt may be processed either in straight process tanks or in a continuous\r\nagitating pasteurizer. If the straight stationary tanks are used the\r\nfollowing time is given in boiling water: No. 1, 30 minutes; 16 oz., 40\r\nminutes; No. 10, 1 hour. If a continuous agitating pasteurizer is used\r\nthis time can be cut down about 60%.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the processing is completed the cans should be gradually\r\ncooled in cold water and left in the cold water until the outside has\r\ncooled sufficiently to allow them to be handled easily. On account of\r\nthe flour it contains soup holds its heat a long time, and it should be\r\nproperly cooled before stacking away.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Shaking and Labeling\r\n\r\nBefore shaking and labeling it is wise to let the soup stand for about\r\nten days, both to give leaks a chance to show up, and to give the\r\ncontents of the can a chance to thoroughly “set.” If the soup is shaken\r\ntoo soon after it is canned there is a possibility of it coagulating\r\nagain, but this will be avoided if the soup is allowed to stand long\r\nenough before shaking—10 days being ample.\r\n\r\nBefore the soup is shaken it will be in a jelly-like mass, and if dumped\r\nout of the can just as it is it will have this jelly-like appearance and\r\nlook lumpy. Shaking makes it smooth, and also makes it flow easily from\r\nthe can. The shaking should be thorough, and the type of shaking machine\r\nthat is used for canned corn answers the purpose better than anything.\r\nShaking by hand is very tedious and trying on the employee, and as a\r\nrule hand shaking isn’t as thorough as it should be. The shaking is done\r\nat the same time as the labeling, and from the shaker the cans pass\r\nthrough the labeling machine without a second handling. The small sizes\r\nare usually packed four dozen to the case, and the No. 10’s six cans to\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     “TAG” INDICATING THERMOMETERS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Handled Top Thermometer]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Adjustable Connection Thermometer]\r\n\r\nFOR TOMATO PULP BOILING, CATSUP KETTLES, SCALDING TANKS, PASTEURIZERS,\r\nSTERILIZERS, TANKS, VATS, Etc.\r\n\r\n  =have been especially designed= to meet the exacting requirements of\r\n  tomato product manufacturers and represent the ultimate perfection of\r\n  150 years of thermometer development and progress.\r\n\r\n  =Permanent accuracy is guaranteed= because each tube is “seasoned” to\r\n  prevent future false readings due to shrinkage of the glass.\r\n\r\n  =Actual temperature conditions= are reproduced similar to those which\r\n  the instrument will encounter in later use due to the “TAG” method of\r\n  “pointing” and making a special scale for each thermometer.\r\n\r\n       _Bulletin T–305 will provide further details of interest_\r\n\r\n                        C.
