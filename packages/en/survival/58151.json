But should you, in your\r\nsuperior wisdom, perceive sufficient evidence has not been advanced to\r\nrender it deserving the consideration requisite at your hands, future\r\nproofs may arise upon the foundation contained in the following pages.—On\r\nthe contrary, should it meet with your approbation, the high and\r\nhonourable position you maintain for the benefit of maritime affairs\r\nwill, I trust, induce you to exercise your influence towards effecting a\r\ntrial of the plan submitted, for the benefit of the community at large, I\r\nand for the honour and credit of your noble establishment.\r\n\r\n                                  I am,\r\n                         MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,\r\n                  Your very humble and obliged Servant,\r\n\r\n                                                               THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany persons may consider it a remarkable circumstance, that an\r\nindividual, whose profession requires his leisure time to be devoted to\r\nthe acquirement of knowledge for the comfort of man in his corporeal\r\nailments, should find an opportunity to direct considerable attention to\r\na subject, so very different in character, as the one now submitted to\r\nthe reader. {5}  The suggestions, however, of a near, respected, and\r\nvenerable relative, aroused and stimulated me to make the strictest\r\ninvestigation, and subsequently led to the submitting a plan or design\r\nfor future benefit, not only to the mariner, the merchant, the\r\nship-owner, to those whose landed property lies contiguous to the ocean,\r\nbut what is of still greater consequence, the preservation of human life;\r\nand although an abler and a more experienced individual might have given\r\na better statement, or submitted a better design, yet it is hoped\r\nsufficient will be found in this first and hasty attempt, to excite the\r\nattention of the learned and the wealthy.\r\n\r\nAn acknowledgment of the truth, a grateful feeling for the assistance\r\nderived for the most important particulars on this interesting subject,\r\ninduces me to introduce the name, with the exertions of my venerable\r\nrelative to the notice of my readers.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John Hewitt, B.A., Perpetual Curate of Walcot, in this county,\r\nVicar of Grantchester, and formerly a Fellow of Corpus Christi College,\r\nCambridge, after several years of often repeated attention to the subject\r\nembraced in this Essay, expended in the year A.D. 1802 upwards of one\r\nhundred pounds in an attempt to fill up, at his own expence, the worst\r\nbreach existing between Waxham and Horsey, and the design to carry it\r\ninto effect appeared so feasible, that to lessen the expence, the Hon.\r\nHarbord Harbord, the first Lord Suffield, lent implements to aid the\r\nundertaking.  But unfortunately, prior to the task being completed, a\r\nstrong north-west wind, upon a spring tide, ensued, and a quantity of\r\nwater passed through the breach partially repaired.\r\n\r\nA cottager residing near the place, witnessed the circumstance only just\r\nprevious to the irruption of the water, and informed my relative had he\r\npossessed a shovel, he could have prevented it.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance attending this catastrophe caused in little minds\r\nderision and contempt, from the failure of the experiment.  But a humble\r\nindividual, whose ideas were more enlarged, contended upwards of three\r\nhundred pounds worth of good had been effected; and the spot on that part\r\nof the coast is recognized to this day as Hewitt’s Bank.\r\n\r\nWhile some persons, therefore, considered it a direct failure, my\r\nrelative deemed it a partial one, and watched with undiminished ardour\r\nthe effect produced by the stranding of the Hunter cutter, A.D. 1807; the\r\nparticulars of which are fully entered into in the following pages.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the tides and currents has been principally acquired from\r\nthe perusal of several works of the most renowned philosophers, whose\r\nerudition have stamped them with truth stable and incontrovertible.  I\r\nhave, therefore, adopted their language rather than my own, fearful I\r\nshould mar their intent, and my regard for such comprehensive writings\r\ninduces me to add the truism transmitted to us by an ancient Latin\r\nauthor—\r\n\r\n    Unius ætatis sunt quæ fortiter fiunt, quæ\r\n    Vero pro utilitate scribuntur æterna.\r\n\r\n                                                               _Vegetius_.\r\n\r\nShould the design be put in execution, and found efficacious, it will be\r\napplicable to other coasts, by taking every particular respecting them\r\ninto consideration, and great will be the reward on the ambition attained\r\nof having endeavoured to benefit the community at large.\r\n\r\n                                                               THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.—THE FORMATION OF THE TIDES CONSIDERED, THEIR VARIATION, AND\r\nEFFECTS.\r\n\r\n    For, lo! the sea that fleets about the land,\r\n    And like a girdle clips her solid waste,\r\n    Music and measure both doth understand:\r\n    For his great crystal eye is always cast\r\n    Up to the moon, and on her fixed fast:\r\n    And as she danceth in her pallid sphere,\r\n    So danceth he about the centre here.\r\n\r\nThe above lines, so beautifully expressed by one of our earlier poets,\r\nintroduces a subject generally understood, but the important object\r\nconnected with our present inquiry cannot be maintained without a\r\nthorough knowledge of cause and effect.  A minute acquaintance,\r\ntherefore, with the formation of the tides and currents, their variation\r\nand effects, transmitted to us by the observations, experiments, and\r\ndiscoveries of the earlier, and confirmed by the researches of the modern\r\nphilosophers, will not be deemed altogether superfluous, as they will\r\ntend to remove any obstacle that might otherwise present itself on the\r\nconsideration of so difficult a subject.\r\n\r\nBy the term tide is meant that regular motion of the sea, according to\r\nwhich it ebbs and flows twice in the twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nAfter some wild conjectures of the earliest philosophers, observes\r\nGoldsmith, it became well known in the time of Pliny that the tides were\r\nentirely under the influence in a small degree of the sun, but in a much\r\ngreater of the moon.  It was found that there was a flux and reflux of\r\nthe sea in the space of twelve hours and fifty minutes, which is exactly\r\nthe time of a lunar day.  It was observed that whenever the moon was in\r\nthe meridian, or in other words, as nearly as possible over any part of\r\nthe sea, that the sea flowed to that part, and made a tide there; on the\r\ncontrary, it was found that when the moon left the meridian, the sea\r\nbegan to flow back again from whence it came, and there might be said to\r\nebb.  Thus far the waters of the sea seemed very regularly to attend the\r\nmotions of the moon.  But as it appeared, likewise, that when the moon\r\nwas in the opposite meridian, as far off on the other side of the globe,\r\nthat there was a tide on this side also, so that the moon produced two\r\ntides, one by her greatest approach to us, and another by her greatest\r\ndistance from us; in other words, the moon, in once going round the\r\nearth, produced two tides, always at the same time; one, on the part of\r\nthe globe directly under her; and the other, on the part of the globe\r\ndirectly opposite.\r\n\r\nKepler was the first who conjectured that attraction was the principal\r\ncause; asserting, that the sphere of the moon’s operation extended to the\r\nearth, and drew up its waters.  But what Kepler only hinted, has been\r\ncompletely developed and demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newton.\r\n\r\nAfter his great discovery of the law of gravitation, he found it an easy\r\nmatter to account for the whole phenomena of the tides.  The moon, like\r\nall the rest of the planets, has been found to attract and to be\r\nattracted by the earth.  This attraction prevails throughout our whole\r\nplanetary system; the more matter there is contained in any body, the\r\nmore it attracts, and its influence decreases in proportion as the\r\ndistance, when squared, increases.  This being premised, let us see what\r\nmust ensue upon supposing the moon in the meridian of any tract of the\r\nsea.  The surface of the water immediately under the moon, is nearer the\r\nmoon than any part of the globe is, and, therefore, must be more subject\r\nto its attraction than the waters anywhere else.  The waters will there\r\nbe attracted by the moon, and rise in a heap, whose eminence will be the\r\nhighest where the attraction is greatest.  In order to form this\r\neminence, it is obvious that its surface, as well as the depths, will be\r\nagitated, and that wherever the water runs from one part, succeeding\r\nwaters must run to fill up the space it has left.  Thus the waters of the\r\nsea, running from all parts to attend the motion of the moon, produce the\r\nflowing of the tide; and it is high tide at that part wherever the moon\r\ncomes over it, or to its meridian. {11}\r\n\r\nBut when the moon travels onward, and ceases to point over the place\r\nwhere the waters were just risen, the cause of their rising ceasing to\r\noperate, they will flow back by their natural gravity into the lower\r\nparts from whence they had travelled; and this retiring of the waters\r\nwill form the ebbing of the sea. {12a}\r\n\r\nThus the first part of the demonstration is obvious, since in general it\r\nrequires no great sagacity to conceive that the waters nearest the moon\r\nare most attracted or raised highest by the moon.  But the other part of\r\nthe demonstration, namely, how there come to be high tides at the same\r\ntime on the other side of the globe is not so easy to conceive.  To\r\ncomprehend this, it must be observed, that the part of the earth and its\r\nwaters farthest from the moon, are the parts of all others that are least\r\nattracted by the moon; it must also be observed, that all the waters,\r\nwhen the moon is on the opposite side of the earth, must be attracted in\r\nthe same direction that the earth itself attracts them; that is\r\napparently quite through the body of the earth, towards the moon itself.\r\nThis, therefore, being conceived, it is plain that those waters which are\r\nfarthest from the moon will have less weight than those of any other part\r\non the same side of the globe, because the moon’s attraction, which\r\nconspires with the earth’s attraction, is there least.  Now, therefore,\r\nthe waters farthest from the moon having less weight, and being lightest,\r\nwill be pressed on all sides by those that having more attraction are\r\nheavier, and the heavier waters flowing in, will make them swell and rise\r\nin an eminence directly opposite to that on the other side of the globe,\r\ncaused by the more immediate influence of the moon. {12b}\r\n\r\nIn this manner the moon, in one diurnal revolution, produces two tides;\r\none raised immediately under the sphere of its influence, and the other\r\ndirectly opposite to it.  As the moon travels, this vast body of waters\r\nrears upward, as if to watch its motions, and pursues the same constant\r\nrotation.  However, in this great work of raising the tides, the sun has\r\nno small share, it produces its own tide constantly every day, just as\r\nthe moon does, but in a much less degree, because the sun is at an\r\nimmensely greater distance.  Thus there are solar tides and lunar\r\ntides—when the forces of these two great luminaries concur, which they\r\nalways do when they are either in the same or in the opposite parts of\r\nthe heavens, they jointly produce a much greater tide, than when they are\r\nso situated in the heavens as each to make peculiar tides of their own;\r\nin the former, the attraction of the sun conspires with the attraction of\r\nthe moon, by which means the high spring tides are formed; in the latter,\r\nthe action of the sun is opposed to that of the moon, consequently the\r\neffect must be to depress the waters where the moon’s action has a\r\ntendency to raise them, and hence the production of the lower neap tides.\r\n{13a}\r\n\r\nThe spring tides {13b} do not take place on the very day of the new and\r\nfull moon, nor the neap tides on the very day of the quadratures, but a\r\nday or two after; the effect is neither greatest nor least when the\r\nimmediate influence of the cause is greatest or least: as the greatest\r\nheat, for example, is not on the solstitial day, when the immediate\r\naction of the sun is greatest, but some time after it.—And although the\r\naction of the sun and moon were to cease, yet the ocean would continue to\r\nebb and flow for some time, as its waves continue in violent motion for\r\nsome time after a storm. {14a}\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton has shown that the tides increase as the cube of the\r\ndistances decrease, so that the moon, at half her present distance, would\r\nproduce a tide eight times greater.  Now the moon describes an ellipse\r\nabout the earth, and of course must be once in every revolution nearer\r\nthe earth than in any other part of her orbit; consequently she must\r\nproduce a much higher tide when in this point of her orbit than in the\r\nopposite point. {14b}\r\n\r\nThis is the reason that two great spring tides never take place\r\nimmediately after each other; for if the moon be at her least distance at\r\nthe time of new moon, she must be at her greatest distance at the time of\r\nfull moon, having performed half a revolution in the intervening time;\r\nand, therefore, the spring tide at the full will be much less than at the\r\npreceding change.  For the same reason, if a great spring tide happens at\r\nthe time of full moon, the tide at the following change will be less.\r\n{14c}\r\n\r\nThe spring tides are highest and the neap tides lowest about the\r\nbeginning of the year; for the earth being nearest the sun about the\r\nfirst of January, must be more strongly attracted by that body than at\r\nany other time of the year: hence the spring tides which happen about\r\nthat time, will be greater than at any other time, and should the moon be\r\nnew or full in that part of her orbit, which is nearest to the earth at\r\nthe same time, the tides will be considerably higher than at any other\r\ntime of the year.\r\n\r\nThe tide which happens at any time while the moon is above the horizon,\r\nis called the superior tide, and when below the horizon, the inferior.\r\nWhen the moon is in the equinoctial, the superior and inferior tides are\r\nof the same height, but when the moon declines towards the elevated pole,\r\nthe superior tide is higher than the inferior.  If the latitude of the\r\nplace and the declination of the moon are of contrary names, the inferior\r\ntides will be the highest.  But the highest tide at any particular place\r\nis when the moon’s declination is equal to the latitude of the place, and\r\nof the same name, and the height of the tide diminishes as the\r\ndifferences between the latitude and declination increases, therefore the\r\nnearer any place is to that parallel whose latitude is equal to the\r\nmoon’s declination and of the same name, the higher will be the tide at\r\nthat place.  In comparing the height of tides at different places, it is\r\nsupposed that the sun and moon are at the same distances from the earth,\r\nand in the same position with respect to the meridian of these places.\r\n{15a}\r\n\r\nThe above observations relative to the regularity of the tides could only\r\nresult by supposing the earth to be covered with the waters of the ocean\r\nto a great depth, but as this is not the case, it is only at places\r\nsituated on the shores of large oceans where such tides exist. {15b}\r\n\r\nFrom local circumstances the tides are subject to great irregularities,\r\nsuch as meeting with islands, headlands, passing through straits, &c.  In\r\norder that they may have their full motion, the ocean in which they are\r\nproduced ought to extend 90° from east to west, because that is the\r\ndistance between the greatest elevation and the greatest depression\r\nproduced in the waters by the moon.\r\n\r\nHence it is that the tides in the Pacific Ocean exceed those of the\r\nAtlantic, and that they are less in that part of the Atlantic which is\r\nwithin the torrid zone between Africa and America, than on the temperate\r\nzones on either side of it where the ocean is much broader. {16a}\r\n\r\nTides are not perceptible in lakes and most inland seas, and deep and\r\nextensive as is the Mediterranean, are scarcely sensible to ordinary\r\nobservation, their effects being quite subordinate to the winds and\r\ncurrents.  In some places, however, as in the Straits of Messina, there\r\nis an ebb and flow to the amount of two feet and upwards; at Naples and\r\nat the Euripus, of twelve and thirteen inches, and Rennell informs us, at\r\nVenice, of five feet. {16b}\r\n\r\nThe ebb and flow of the ocean is very slight in islands remote from any\r\ncontinent, as for example, at St. Helena, where it seldom exceeds three\r\nfeet.  Tides are remarkably high on the coasts of Malay, in the Straits\r\nof Sunda, on the open coast of Patagonia, along the coasts of China and\r\nJapan, at Panama, in the Gulph of Bengal, and at the mouth of the Indus,\r\nwhere the water rises thirty feet in height.  Tides are greatest in any\r\ngiven line of coast, in narrow bays and estuaries; and are least in the\r\nintervening tracts where the land is prominent. {16c}\r\n\r\nOn the authority of the late Captain Hewett, R.N., at the entrance of the\r\nestuary of the Thames, the rise of the spring tides is eighteen feet; but\r\nwhen we follow our eastern coast from thence northward; towards Lowestoft\r\nand Yarmouth, we find a gradual diminution, until at the place last\r\nmentioned the highest rise is only seven or eight feet.  From this point\r\nthere begins again to be an increase, so that at Cromer, where the coast\r\nagain retires towards the west, the rise is sixteen feet; and towards the\r\nextremity of the gulph called “the Wash,” as at Lynn and in Boston Deeps,\r\nit is from twenty-two to twenty-four, and in some extraordinary cases,\r\ntwenty-six feet.  From thence again there is a decrease towards the\r\nnorth; the elevation at the Spurn Point being from nineteen to twenty\r\nfeet, and at Flamborough Head, on the Yorkshire coast, from fourteen to\r\nsixteen feet.\r\n\r\nIt is also recorded, on the authority of Captain Beaufort, R.N., that at\r\nMilford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, at the mouth of the Bristol Channel, the\r\ntides rise thirty-six feet, and at King-road, near Bristol, forty-two\r\nfeet.  At Chepstow, on the Wye, a small river which opens into the\r\nestuary of the Severn, they reach fifty feet, sometimes sixty-nine, and\r\neven seventy-two feet. {17}\r\n\r\nThe tides at Tonquin are the most remarkable in the world.  In this part\r\nthere is but one tide and one ebb every twenty-four hours; whereas in\r\nother places there are two.  Besides twice in each month there is no tide\r\nat all, when the moon is near the equinoctial, the water being for some\r\ntime quite stagnant.  These, with other peculiar appearances attending\r\nthe same phenomena, were considered by many as inscrutable; but Sir Isaac\r\nNewton adjudged them to arise from the concurrence of two tides, one from\r\nthe South Sea, and the other from the Indian Ocean.  Of each of these\r\ntides there come successively two every day; two at one time greater, and\r\ntwo at another that are less.  The time between the arrival of the two\r\ngreater is considered by him as high tide; the time between the two\r\nlesser as ebb.  In short, with this clue that great mathematician solved\r\nevery appearance, and so established his theory as to silence every\r\nopposer.  This fluctuation of the sea from the tides, observes the same\r\nauthor, produces another and more constant rotation of its waters from\r\nthe east to the west, in this respect following the course of the moon.\r\n\r\nThis may be considered as one great and general current of the waters of\r\nthe sea; and although it be not every where distinguishable, it is\r\nnevertheless every where existent, except when opposed by some particular\r\ncurrent or eddy produced by partial and local causes.  This tendency of\r\nthe sea towards the west is plainly perceivable in all the great straits\r\nof the ocean; as for instance, in those of Magellan, in South America,\r\nwhere the tide running in from the east nearly twenty feet high, and\r\ncontinues flowing six hours, whereas the ebb continues but two hours, and\r\nthe current is directed to the west.  This proves that the flux is not\r\nequal to the reflux, and that from both results a motion of the sea\r\nwestward, which is more powerful during the time of the flux than the\r\nreflux.  This motion westward has been sensibly observed by navigators in\r\ntheir passage back from India to Madagascar, and so on to Africa.  In the\r\ngreat Pacific, also, it is very perceivable; but the places where it is\r\nmost obvious are, as it was said, in those straits which join one ocean\r\nto another.  In the straits between the Maldivia Islands, in the gulph of\r\nMexico, between Cuba and Jucatan.  In the straits in the gulph of Paria,\r\nthe motion is so violent, that it has received the appellation of the\r\nDragon’s Mouth.  Northward, in the sea of Canada, in Waigat’s straits, in\r\nthe straits of Java, and in short, where the ocean on one part pours into\r\nthe ocean on the other.  In this manner is the sea carried with an\r\nunceasing circulation round the globe, and at the same time that its\r\nwaters are pushed backward and forward with the tide; they have thus a\r\nprogressive current to the west, which, though less observable, is not\r\nthe less real. {19}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF CURRENTS THEIR VARIATION, EFFECTS, AND VELOCITY CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\nANOTHER impulse communicated to the waters of the ocean arises from its\r\ncurrents.  These are caused by the winds blowing for many months in one\r\ndirection, which produce on an expansive ocean movements of considerable\r\nmagnitude: this may be easily conceived when we observe the effects\r\nproduced on our own seas by the temporary action of the same cause.\r\n\r\nA strong south-west or north-west wind invariably raises the tides to an\r\nunusual height along the east coast of England and the Channel.  Smeaton\r\nascertained by experiment that in a canal four miles in length, the water\r\nwas kept up four inches higher at one end than at the other, merely by\r\nthe action of wind along the canal; and Rennell informs us that a large\r\npiece of water, ten miles broad, and generally only three feet deep, has\r\nby a strong wind had its waters driven to one side, and sustained so as\r\nto become six feet deep, while the windward side was laid dry.  He also\r\nobserves, “As water, when pent up so that it cannot escape, acquires a\r\nhigher level, so, in a place where it can escape, the same operation\r\nproduces a current, and this current will extend to a greater or less\r\ndistance according to the force by which it is produced.”\r\n\r\nCurrents flowing alternately in opposite directions are also occasioned\r\nby the rise and fall of the tides.  The effect of this cause is, as\r\nbefore observed, in estuaries and channels between islands.\r\n\r\nEvaporation by solar heat is another cause of oceanic currents, of which\r\nthe great current setting through the Straits of Gibraltar into the\r\nMediterranean, is a remarkable example.  A stream of colder water always\r\nflows from the Black Sea into the Mediterranean.  It must happen in many\r\nother parts of the world that large quantities of water, raised from one\r\ntract of the ocean by solar heat, are carried to some other, where the\r\nvapour is condensed, and falls in the shape of rain, and this, in flowing\r\nback again to restore equilibrium, will cause sensible currents.  There\r\nis still another way in which heat and cold must occasion great movements\r\nin the ocean; a cause to which, perhaps, currents are principally due.\r\nIt is now ascertained that there is in sea water no point, as in fresh\r\nwater, at which an increase of cold causes the fluid to begin again to\r\nexpand.  In the ocean, therefore, whenever the temperature of the surface\r\nis lowered, condensation takes place, and the superficial water having\r\nits specific gravity increased, falls to the bottom, upon which lighter\r\nwater rises immediately, and occupies its place.  When this circulation\r\nof ascending and descending currents has gone on for a certain time in\r\nhigh latitudes; the inferior parts of the sea are made to consist of\r\ncolder or heavier fluid than the corresponding depths of the ocean\r\nbetween the tropics.  If there be a free communication, if no chain of\r\nsubmarine mountains divide the polar from the equatorial basins, a\r\nhorizontal movement will arise by the flowing of colder water from the\r\npoles to the equator, and there will then be a reflux of warmer\r\nsuperficial water from the equator to the poles.  A well-known experiment\r\nhas been adduced to elucidate this mode of action in explanation of the\r\n“trade winds.”  If a long trough, divided in the middle by a sluice or\r\npartition, have one end filled with water, and the other with quick\r\nsilver, both fluids will remain quiet so long as they are divided, but\r\nwhen the sluice is drawn up, the heavier fluid will rush along the bottom\r\nof the trough, while the lighter, from being displaced, will rise, and\r\nflowing in an opposite direction, spread itself at the top.  The\r\nexpansion and contraction of sea water by heat and cold, have in a\r\nsimilar manner, a tendency to set under currents in motion from the poles\r\nto the equator, and to cause counter currents at the surface, which are\r\nimpelled contrary to that of prevailing-trade winds.  The geographical\r\nand other circumstances being very complicated, we cannot expect to trace\r\nseparately the movements due to each cause, but must be prepared for many\r\nanomalies, especially as the bed of the ocean must often modify and\r\ninterfere with the course of the inferior currents, as much as the\r\nposition and form of continents and islands alter the direction of those\r\non the surface.  Thus, on sounding at great depths in the Mediterranean,\r\nCaptains Berard and D’Urville have found that the cold does not increase\r\nin a high ratio, as in the tropical regions of the ocean, the thermometer\r\nremaining fixed at about 55° F. between the depths of 1000 and 6000 feet;\r\nand Captain Smith has shown in his survey, that the deepest part in the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar is only 1320 feet, so that a submarine barrier\r\nexists there, which must prevent the influx of any under current of the\r\nocean cooled by the polar ice.\r\n\r\nThe rotation of the earth on its axis is another cause which can only\r\ncome into play when the waters have been already set in motion by some\r\none or all of the forces above described, and when the direction of the\r\ncurrent so raised happens to be from south to north, or from north to\r\nsouth, the principle on which this operates has been long recognized in\r\nthe case of trade winds; thus, when a current flows from the Cape of Good\r\nHope towards the Gulph of Guinea, it consists of a mass of water, which,\r\non doubling the Cape, in latitude 35°, has a rotatory velocity of about\r\n800 miles an hour; but when it reaches the line, it arrives at a parallel\r\nwhere the surface of the earth is whirled round at the rate of 1000 miles\r\nan hour, or about 200 miles faster.  If this great mass of water was\r\ntransferred suddenly from the higher to the lower latitude, the\r\ndeficiency of its rotatory motion, relatively to the land and water with\r\nwhich it would come into juxta position, would be such as to cause an\r\napparent motion of the most rapid kind (of no less than 200 miles an\r\nhour) from east to west. {23}\r\n\r\nIn the case of such a sudden transfer, the eastern coast of America being\r\ncarried round in an opposite direction, might strike against a large body\r\nof water with tremendous violence, and a considerable part of the\r\ncontinent might be submerged.  This disturbance does not occur, because\r\nthe water of the stream, as it advances gradually into new zones of the\r\nsea, acquires by friction an accelerated velocity.  Yet as this motion is\r\nnot imparted instantaneously, the fluid is unable to keep up with the\r\nfull speed of the new surface over which it is successively brought; and\r\nHerschel, in his Treatise on Astronomy, observes, when speaking of the\r\ntrade winds, it lags or hangs back in a direction opposite to the earth’s\r\nrotation, that is from east to west; {24a} and thus a current which would\r\nhave run simply towards the north but for the rotation, may acquire a\r\nrelative direction towards the west, or become a south-easterly current.\r\n{24b}\r\n\r\nThe most extensive and best determined system of currents is that which\r\nhas its source in the Indian Ocean, under the influence of the trade\r\nwinds; and which, after doubling the Cape of Good Hope, inclines to the\r\nnorthward, along the western coast of Africa; then crosses the Atlantic\r\nnear the Equator, and is lost in the Caribbean Sea; yet seems to be again\r\nrevived in the current which issues from the Gulph of Mexico, by the\r\nStraits of Bahama, and flows rapidly in a north-easterly direction, by\r\nthe bank of Newfoundland, towards the Azores.\r\n\r\nRennell informs us, that the Lagullas current, so called from the cape\r\nand bank of that name, is formed by the junction of two streams flowing\r\nfrom the Indian Ocean, the one from the channel of Mozambique, down the\r\nsouth-east coast of Africa, the other from the ocean at large.—The\r\ncollective stream is from ninety to one hundred miles in breadth, and\r\nruns at the rate of from two and a half to more than four miles per hour.\r\nIt is at length turned westward by the Lagullas bank, which rises from a\r\nsea of great depth, to within one hundred fathoms of the surface.  It\r\nmust therefore be inferred, says Rennell, that the current here is more\r\nthan one hundred fathoms deep, otherwise the main body of it would pass\r\nacross the bank, instead of being deflected eastward, so as to flow round\r\nthe Cape of Good Hope.  From this Cape it flows northward, along the\r\nwestern coast of Africa, taking the name of the South Atlantic current.\r\nIt then enters the Bight or Bay of Benin, and is turned westward, partly\r\nby the form of the coast there, and partly, perhaps, by the Guinea\r\ncurrent, which runs from the north into the same great bay.  From the\r\ncentre of this bay proceeds the Equatorial current, holding a westerly\r\ndirection towards the Atlantic, which it traverses from the coast of\r\nGuinea to that of Brazil, flowing afterwards by the shores of Guiana to\r\nthe West Indies.  The breadth of this current varies from one hundred and\r\nsixty to four hundred and fifty geographical miles, and its velocity is\r\nfrom twenty five to seventy nine miles per day, the mean rate being about\r\nthirty miles.  The length of its whole course is about four thousand\r\nmiles.  As it skirts the coast of Guiana, it is increased by the influx\r\nof the waters of the Amazon and Orinoco, and by their junction acquires\r\naccelerated velocity.  After passing the island of Trinadad, it expands,\r\nand is almost lost in the Caribbean Sea; but there appears to be a\r\ngeneral movement of that sea towards the Mexican Gulph, which discharges\r\nthe most powerful of all currents through the Straits of Florida, where\r\nthe waters run in the northern part with a velocity of five miles an\r\nhour, having a breadth of from thirty five to fifty miles. {25}\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the Gulph of Mexico is 86° in summer, or 6° higher\r\nthan that of the ocean in the same parallel (25° N. lat.) and a large\r\nproportion of this warmth is retained, even where the stream reaches the\r\n43° N. lat.  After issuing from the Straits of Florida, the current runs\r\nin a northerly direction to Cape Hatteras, in North Carolina, about 35°\r\nN. lat. where it is more than seventy miles broad, and still moves at the\r\nsame rate of seventy five miles per day.  In about 40° N. lat. it is\r\nturned more towards the Atlantic by the extensive banks of Nantucket and\r\nSt. George, which are from two hundred to three hundred feet beneath the\r\nsurface of the sea; a clear proof that the current exceeds that depth.\r\nOn arriving near the Azores, the stream widens and overflows, as it were\r\nforming a large expanse of warm water in the centre of the north\r\nAtlantic, over a space of two or three hundred miles from north to south,\r\nand having a temperature of from 8° to 10° Fahr. above the surrounding\r\nocean.  The whole area covered by the gulph water is estimated by Rennell\r\nat two thousand miles in length, and at a mean, three hundred and fifty\r\nmiles in breadth, an area more extensive than that of the Mediterranean.\r\nThe warm water has been sometimes known to reach the Bay of Biscay, still\r\nretaining five degrees of temperature above that of the adjoining ocean;\r\nand a branch of the gulf current drifts fruits, plants, and wood, the\r\nproduce of America and the West Indies, to the shores of Ireland and the\r\nHebrides. {26}\r\n\r\nFrom the above statements, observes Mr. Lyell, we may understand why\r\nRennell has characterised some of the principal currents as oceanic\r\nrivers, which he describes as being from fifty to two hundred and fifty\r\nmiles in breadth, and having a rapidity exceeding that of the largest\r\nnavigable rivers of the continent, and so deep as to be sometimes\r\nobstructed and occasionally turned aside by banks, the tops of which do\r\nnot rise within forty, fifty, or even one hundred fathoms of the surface\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary velocity of the principal currents of the ocean is from one\r\nto three miles per hour; but when the boundary lands converge, large\r\nbodies of water are driven gradually into a narrow space, and then,\r\nwanting lateral room, are compelled to raise their level.  Whenever this\r\noccurs, their velocity is much increased.  The current which runs through\r\nthe Race of Alderney, between the island of that name and the main land,\r\nhas a velocity of about eight English miles an hour.  The late Captain\r\nHewett found that in the Pentland Firth the stream, in ordinary spring\r\ntides, runs ten miles and a half an hour, and about thirteen miles during\r\nviolent storms.  The greatest velocity of the tidal current through the\r\n“Shoots or New Passage,” in the Bristol Channel, is fourteen miles an\r\nhour; and Captain King observed, in his recent survey of the Straits of\r\nMagellan, that the tide ran at the same rate through the “First Narrows,”\r\nand about eight geographical miles an hour in other parts of those\r\nstraits.\r\n\r\nThe course of currents on the British shores is ascertained to be as\r\nwinding as that of ordinary rivers.  Sometimes they run between banks of\r\nsand, which consist of matter thrown down at certain points where the\r\nvelocity of the stream has been retarded, but it very frequently occurs,\r\nthat as in a river one bank is made of low alluvial gravel, while the\r\nother is composed of some hardy and lofty rocks constantly undermined, so\r\nthe current in its bends strikes here and there upon a coast which then\r\nforms one bank, whilst a shoal under water forms the other.  If the coast\r\nbe formed of solid materials, it yields slowly; so also if it be of great\r\nheight, for in that case a large quantity of matter must be removed\r\nbefore the sea can penetrate to any distance.\r\n\r\nCurrents depend, like tides, on no temporary or accidental circumstances,\r\nbut on the laws which preside over the motions of the heavenly bodies.\r\nThe height to which tides rise, and the violence and velocity of the\r\ncurrents, depend in a great measure on the actual configuration of the\r\nland, the contour of a long line of continental or insular coast, the\r\ndepth and breadth of channels, the peculiar form at the bottom of the\r\nseas—in a word, on a combination of circumstances which are made to vary\r\ncontinually by many igneous and aqueous causes, and among the rest, by\r\nthe tides and currents themselves.  Although these agents of decay and\r\nreproduction are local in reference to periods of short duration, such as\r\nthose which history embraces, they are nevertheless universal, if we\r\nextend our views to a sufficient lapse of ages. {28}\r\n\r\nCurrents, observes Goldsmith, act their part in a smaller sphere, being\r\ngenerally greatest where the motions of the sea are least, namely,\r\nnearest the shores, and with the tides, produce the most rapid changes;\r\ntheir motion agitates the substances of which their bed is composed, and\r\nat the bottom of the sea, the greatest wonders are performed, for while\r\nthe sea has been known to recede from some lands, so it has been found to\r\nencroach upon others, and probably these depredations on one part of the\r\nshore may account for the dereliction of another, for the current which\r\nrested upon some certain bank, having got an egress in some other place,\r\nit no longer presses upon its former bed, but pours all its stream into\r\nthe new entrance, so that every inundation of the sea may be attended\r\nwith some correspondent dereliction of another shore, where the sea meets\r\nno obstacles, it spreads with a gentle intumescence, till all the power\r\nis destroyed by wanting depth to aid the motion, but when the progress is\r\nchecked in the midst by the prominence of rocks or the abrupt elevation\r\nof land, it dashes with all its force its depth against the obstacle, and\r\nforms, by its repeated violence, that abruptness of the shore which\r\nconfines its impetuosity.  Where the sea is extremely deep, and very much\r\nvexed with tempests, it is no small obstacle that can confine its rage;\r\nand for this reason, we see the boldest shores projected against the\r\ndeepest waters, all less impediments having long before been surmounted\r\nand washed away.  In places where the force of the sea is less violent,\r\nor its tides less rapid, the shores are generally seen to descend with a\r\nmore gradual declivity.  Upon these shores the sea seldom beats with any\r\ngreat violence, as a large wave has not depth sufficient to float it\r\nonwards, so that here only are to be seen gentle surges making towards\r\nthe land, and lessening as they approach.  As the sea, in the former\r\ndescription, is generally seen to present prospects of tumult and uproar,\r\nhere it more usually exhibits a repose and tranquil beauty.  Its waters\r\nwhich, when surveyed from the precipice, afforded a muddy greenish hue,\r\narising from their depth and position to the eye, {29} when regarded from\r\na shelving shore, were the colour of the sky, and seem rising to meet it.\r\nThe deafening noise of the deep sea is here converted into gentle\r\nmurmurs; instead of the waters dashing against the face of the rock, it\r\nadvances and recedes, still going forward but with just force enough to\r\npush its weeds and shells, by insensible approaches, to the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN OCEAN—ITS GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION—ITS TIDES—DISASTROUS EFFECTS\r\nIN COMBINATION WITH GALES OF WIND FROM THE NORTH-WEST ON DIFFERENT PARTS\r\nOF THE COAST UNDER CONSIDERATION—EXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nTHE workings of Nature itself, under the control of an Allwise and\r\nOmnipotent Being, ever exhibit a restorative as well as a destructive\r\npower.  Its laws and constitution being no where directly revealed to us,\r\nare only to be inferred from the inspection of particular facts, obtained\r\nfrom observation and experiment, the only trust-worthy guides to the\r\nknowledge of Nature.  Let us inquire—first, the cause of the German Ocean\r\ngaining upon the Norfolk coast? secondly, whether every portion is the\r\nsubject of such visitation, attended with similar results? and thirdly,\r\nwhether art can arrest its progress?\r\n\r\nThe German Ocean, from its being intersected with numerous shoals of\r\nsand, some of immense length and breadth, presents a greater variation in\r\nthe tides and currents than probably any other ocean in the world; and\r\nfrom its exposure to variable and violent winds, renders the navigation\r\nextremely dangerous.  Its extent in area is about two millions of square\r\nmiles, and is confined within its narrowest limits between England and\r\nHolland, and there in consequence the tides rise highest.  It opens into\r\nthe Atlantic on the north, and communicates with the English Channel by\r\nthe Straits of Dover, and with the Baltic Sea by the Scaggerac and\r\nCattegat.  It may be considered as divided into two parts by the Dogger\r\nBank, which traverses it in almost all its width, and a strong tide runs\r\nfrom north to south, {32} which is much increased by north and north-west\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest records to the present time, that portion of the coast\r\nextending from Cromer to Winterton-ness has been most subjected to the\r\nravages of the ocean; lands have been swept away, buildings of\r\nconsiderable value have been swallowed up, and notwithstanding every\r\neffort hitherto made, the sea continues to advance in the interior as\r\nlittle satiated as before.  The line of coast is extremely favourable to\r\nits rapacity, presenting, as it does, the appearance of a cape, and the\r\ndifferent strata composing the cliffs are generally of too yielding a\r\nnature to resist its influence, even under ordinary circumstances.—The\r\nHasborough Sands, extending from Winterton, to or a little beyond Bacton,\r\nmust, from their dimensions and abrupt elevation, be a source of\r\nconsiderable mischief, confining a vast body of water within a narrow\r\nlimit, which, when increased and disturbed by gales of wind from the\r\nnorth-west, upon a spring tide, urges the waves against the cliffs with a\r\ngreater or less velocity, and with a force not only sufficient to sweep\r\naway large quantities of the earth, which, from the perpendicularity of\r\nthe cliffs, is deposited at their base, but actually to undermine them to\r\na considerable extent.\r\n\r\nNumerous instances can be adduced where the current has taken away\r\ntwenty-one yards of land from the interior in three tides; and it was\r\ncomputed when the present Inn was built in Lower Sherringham, near\r\nCromer, in 1805, that it would require seventy years for the sea to reach\r\nthe spot, the mean loss of land being calculated, from previous\r\nobservations, to be somewhat less than one yard annually; the distance\r\nbetween the house and the sea was fifty yards, but no allowance was made\r\nfor the slope of the ground being from the sea, in consequence of which\r\nthe waste was naturally accelerated every year as the cliff grew lower,\r\nthere being at each succeeding period less matter to remove when portions\r\nof equal area fell down.  Between the years 1824 and 1829, no less than\r\nseventeen yards were swept away, and the distance between the house and\r\nthe edge of the cliff at this time is only from eight to ten yards.\r\n\r\nThe whole site of ancient Cromer {33a} now forms part of the German\r\nOcean, the inhabitants having gradually retreated inland to the present\r\nsituation, from whence the sea still threatens to dislodge them.  The\r\nlocality of this portion of the coast, the scarcity of sea beach material\r\nin the offing, the bed of the ocean of a rocky character, and the beach\r\npresenting nearly a level approaching a dead flat render it peculiarly\r\nliable to its invasion.\r\n\r\nAt Trimingham {33b} upwards of fifty acres of land have been removed\r\nduring the last sixty years, and on one occasion four acres and a half\r\nwere taken away in one tide.\r\n\r\nThe property belonging to Mr. Wheatley, at Mundesley, {34a} has become\r\nconsiderably reduced in extent and value, and has only been preserved to\r\nthe present time by substantial walls erected next the sea, and numerous\r\npiles of wood driven into the sand beyond them: but what renders it most\r\ndisheartening is, the sea has excavated the cliff at their extremity; and\r\nthe probability is, should a heavy lasting gale of wind ensue from the\r\nnorth-west upon a spring tide, they, with perhaps the greater portion of\r\nthe property, will be swept away by the water intruding behind and\r\nbetween them.  Land attached to the estate of S. Bignold, Esq., adjoining\r\nWalcot {34b} Gap, previous to 1839, was rapidly taken away.\r\n\r\nAt Hasborough, {34c} the sea has encroached upwards of one hundred and\r\nseventy yards during the last sixty years, and it is calculated the\r\nchurch will be engulphed in the Ocean before the middle of the ensuing\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe ancient villages of Shipden, {34d} Whimpwell, {34e} and Keswick {34f}\r\nhave entirely disappeared, and nearly the whole of Eccles. {34g}  A\r\nmonument, however, still remains in the ruined tower of the old church,\r\nwhich is half buried in the dunes of sand.  These have been fast\r\nencroached upon since 1839, laying bare the foundations of dwellings, the\r\nchancel end of the church, with a portion of a wall supposed to have\r\nsurrounded the church-yard.  The upper part of the buildings had\r\nevidently been removed previous to the foundations having been buried\r\nunder the sand.\r\n\r\nHills of blown sand, between Eccles and Winterton, {34h} extending to\r\nYarmouth, have barred up and excluded the tide for many centuries from\r\nthe mouths of several small estuaries; but there are records of nine\r\nbreaches, from twenty to one hundred and twenty yards wide, having been\r\nmade through these, by which immense damage was done to the low grounds\r\nin the interior.  One of the most remarkable occurred in the year 1792,\r\non which occasion a body of water passed through between Horsey {35a} and\r\nWaxham, {35b} extending beyond Hickling, a village situated three miles\r\ninland, which, uniting with the fresh water contained in a large lake,\r\ntermed the Hickling broad, destroyed all the fish.  The injury the land\r\nsustained in the immediate neighbourhood was very considerable; upon one\r\nfarm a loss of upwards of three hundred pounds was experienced, and years\r\npassed by before the land recovered its former fertility.  The effluvia\r\narising from the subsidence or sinking of the water filled the air with\r\nmalaria of the worst description.  Intermittent and typhoid fevers of a\r\nmost formidable character prevailed, so that many an individual was\r\nbrought to a premature grave through this catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS ON THE GERMAN OCEAN CONTINUED.—ITS RESTORATIVE POWERS ON OTHER\r\nCOASTS DEMONSTRATED.—INCREASE OF THE SHOALS OF SAND OFF HASBOROUGH,\r\nCAISTER, &C.—THE SMALLER SHOALS OF SAND ALONG THE COAST—THEIR FORMATION\r\nAND EFFECTS CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\nHAVING now brought together ample proofs of the destructive operations of\r\nthe waves, tides, and currents upon our eastern coast, let us observe\r\nexamples of their restorative power, in many instances aided and assisted\r\nby the hand of man.\r\n\r\nThe German Ocean is deepest on the Norwegian side, where the soundings\r\ngive one hundred and ninety fathoms; but the mean depth of the whole\r\nbasin may be stated at no more than thirty-one fathoms. {36}  The bed of\r\nthis sea is traversed by several enormous banks: one of which, occupying\r\na central position, trends from the Frith of Forth in a north-easterly\r\ndirection, to a distance of one hundred and ten miles; others run from\r\nDenmark and Jutland, upwards of one hundred and five miles to the\r\nnorth-west; while the greatest of all, the Dogger Bank, extends for\r\nupwards of three hundred and fifty-four miles from north to south. {37a}\r\nThe whole superficies of these enormous shoals is equal to about\r\none-fifth of the whole area of the German Ocean, or to about one-third of\r\nthe whole extent of England and Scotland. {37b}  The average height of\r\nthe banks measures, according to Mr. Stevenson, about seventy-eight feet;\r\nthe upper portion consisting of fine and course silicious sand, mixed\r\nwith comminuted corals and shell. {37c}  Some long narrow ravines are\r\nfound to intersect the banks.  One of these varies from seventeen to\r\nforty-four fathoms in depth and has very precipitous sides: in one part,\r\ncalled the “Inner Silver Pits,” it is fifty-five fathoms deep.  The\r\nshallowest parts of the Dogger Bank were found to be forty-two feet under\r\nwater, except in one place, where the wreck of a ship had caused a shoal.\r\n\r\nThese sands receive fresh increase every day; so that in time the place\r\nbids fair to become habitable earth.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Holland seems to be a conquest upon the sea, and in a\r\nmanner rescued from its bosom.  The surface of the earth, in this\r\ncountry, is below the level of the bed of the ocean; and I remember,\r\nobserves Buffon, upon approaching the coast, to have looked down upon it\r\nfrom the sea, as into a valley: however, it is every day rising higher by\r\nthe depositions made upon it by the sea, the Rhine and the Meuse, and\r\nthose parts which formerly admitted large men of war, are now known to be\r\ntoo shallow to receive ships of very moderate burden.\r\n\r\nThe formation of new lands by the sea’s continually bringing its sediment\r\nto one place, and by the accumulation of its sands in another, is easily\r\nconceived.  We have had many instances of this in England.  The island of\r\nOxney, which is adjacent to Romney-marsh, was produced in this manner.\r\nThis had for a long time been a low level, continually in danger of being\r\noverflown by the river Rother; but the sea, by its depositions, has\r\ngradually raised the bottom of the river, while it has hollowed its\r\nmouth; so that the one is sufficiently secured from inundations, and the\r\nother is deep enough to admit ships of considerable burthen.\r\n\r\nOn many parts of the coasts of France, England, Holland, Germany, and\r\nPrussia, the sea has been sensibly known to retire. {38a}\r\n\r\nInstances of new lands having been produced from the sea are brought\r\nabout by two different ways; first, by the waters raising banks of sand\r\nor mud where the sediment is deposited; and, secondly, by their\r\nrelinquishing the shore entirely, and leaving it unoccupied to the\r\nindustry of man. {38b}\r\n\r\nThe quantity of sand, stones, &c., moved here and there by the tidal\r\ncurrent is very considerable, and no given line of the coast can afford a\r\nbetter example than the one under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Hasborough Sands probably increase in breadth if not in length, since\r\nevery year they receive fresh accessions from vessels buried in their\r\nvortex, which afford a nucleus for retaining the sand lodging against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Cockle Sands, off Caistor, {39} have increased since 1836 one mile\r\nand a half in extent to the northward.\r\n\r\nThe deposition of sands, stones, shingle, &c., upon our coast, especially\r\nduring the summer months, when easterly, southerly, and westerly winds\r\nprevail, would strike the beholder unaccustomed to witness the contrary\r\neffects, as an apparent impossibility, that the water could remove such\r\nan immense quantity of material especially in the short time that it does\r\nwhen a north-west gale prevails.\r\n\r\nShoals of sand of various length, breadth, and depth, appear and\r\ndisappear, form and re-form, in the offing.—In north-westerly gales only\r\nare they solid, stable, and compact, and increase in breadth, while the\r\nmaterials on the beach are swept away.  They extend in a direction\r\nparallel with the shore, and present an inclined plane, on each side of\r\ntheir base a corresponding shallow exists, and the tidal current will not\r\nallow materials to rest on their surface sufficiently to increase their\r\nelevation, and render them more efficient.  As it is, however, they are\r\nnatural breakwaters, but from their irregularity in extent, dimensions,\r\nand situation, they afford only a partial protection to the coast.\r\n\r\nThe incursions of the sea at Aldborough, in Suffolk, were formerly very\r\ndestructive; and this borough is known to have been once situated a\r\nquarter of a mile east of the present shore.  The inhabitants continued\r\nto build further inland, till they arrived at the extremity of their\r\nproperty, and then the town decayed greatly; but two sandbanks thrown up\r\nat a short distance, now afford a temporary safeguard to the coast.\r\nBetween these banks and the present shore, where the current now flows,\r\nthe sea is twenty-four feet deep on the spot where the town formerly\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nImmediately off Yarmouth, {40a} and parallel to the shore, is a range of\r\nsand-banks, the shape of which varies slowly from year to year, and often\r\nsuddenly after great storms.  The late Captain Hewett, R.N., found in\r\nthese banks, in 1836, a broad channel sixty-five feet deep, where there\r\nwas only a depth of four feet during a prior survey in 1822.  The sea had\r\nexcavated to the depth of sixty feet in the course of fourteen years, or\r\nperhaps a shorter period. {40b}\r\n\r\nWherever a shoal of sand exists in the offing, at a distance beyond where\r\nthe ebbing of the tide recedes to its greatest extent, denominated low\r\nwater mark, there the innermost shallow will probably be: another shoal\r\nimmediately forms, the base commencing at low water mark, and a gradual\r\nrise takes place towards the cliffs, terminating at or beyond the extent\r\nof the flowing of the tide denominated high water mark.  Here, then, the\r\nshoal will be more efficient; the tidal wave and current will be checked\r\nand broken against the ascending bank.\r\n\r\nBut should a shoal of sand form whose superior surface terminates at low\r\nwater mark, the innermost shallow {41} will be observed nearer to, and\r\nits course frequently terminate in, an angular direction to the cliffs;\r\nand between the intermediate spaces of the shoals existing in the offing,\r\na current frequently sets in towards the shore, which will aid the force\r\nof the tidal wave and current, when called into excessive action, in its\r\nattack either upon the cliff opposite, or a partial shoal nearest it.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the one will soon lose its inclined surface,\r\nand the other will become undermined.\r\n\r\nWhere shoals of sand exist in the offing, there the beach is widest, and\r\nwhere they do not exist, there the beach is narrowest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS TAKEN TO ARREST THE DEPREDATIONS OF THE GERMAN OCEAN BY PUBLIC AND\r\nPRIVATE INDIVIDUALS.—THE ERECTION OF JETTIES, PIERS, AND GROINS\r\nCONSIDERED.—THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ARISING FROM THE TWO FORMER AT\r\nYARMOUTH AND CROMER—THE PARTIAL FAILURE OF THE LATTER AT TRIMINGHAM, AND\r\nTHEIR INJURIOUS EFFECTS ON OTHER COASTS DEMONSTRATED.\r\n\r\nIT appears, from the observations of Mr. Palmer and others, that if a\r\npier or groin be erected anywhere on our southern or south-eastern coast,\r\nto stop the progress of the beach, a heap of shingle soon collects on the\r\nwestern side of such artificial barriers, {42a} while on our eastern\r\ncoast, sand, stones, &c., accumulate to the northward.\r\n\r\nThe plans hitherto pursued by public and private individuals have been to\r\nplace abrupt perpendicular bodies, not to the southward of the property\r\nthey have been most anxious to save, but have erected them directly\r\nopposite.  Thus Mr. Wheatley, of Mundsley, {42b} had the hulls of old\r\nvessels placed upon the shore at the base of the cliffs adjoining his\r\nproperty; they were filled with large stones, secured with piles driven\r\ninto the beach on either side, fore and aft, also by a strong chain\r\ncable, &c.; but a few years since they were entirely removed by the sea\r\nduring a heavy gale of wind from the north-west upon a spring tide.\r\n\r\nThe town of Cromer, {43a} on the same occasion, met with considerable\r\nloss.  The jetty erected at the north end of the town caused a large\r\nmound of sand to accumulate to the eastward of it, presenting an inclined\r\nsurface towards the sea, and during the intervention of north-westerly\r\ngales, indigenous grasses sprung up, and covered the surface nearest the\r\nbanks; this time, however, the jetty gave way, and the greater portion of\r\nthe mound of sand was removed; but still there was sufficient left to\r\nconvince the inhabitants, had the jetty been erected at the west end of\r\nthe town, their property would have been saved.\r\n\r\nIn the erection of a groin at Trimingham, {43b} a few years since, large\r\nsquare piles, about ten or twelve inches in diameter, were driven into\r\nthe beach, at a right angle, to the base of the tall cliffs, and extended\r\nto or beyond low water mark; they were left projecting a considerable\r\nheight above the then surface of the beach, and strong planks, fastened\r\nwith iron bolts, were continuously attached to the tops of the projecting\r\npiles.  The shallow existing must have been considerable in length,\r\nbreadth, and depth; for subsequently a heavy sea, produced from a\r\nnortherly gale, removed several of the piles entirely, and others were\r\nforced from a perpendicular to a horizontal position.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance, however, is readily accounted for, the strata into\r\nwhich the piles were inserted at a particular part, passed through blue\r\nclay into blue sand of a loose texture, and the piles were not driven to\r\na depth necessary to reach or enter the solid strata beneath; now if we\r\ntake into consideration the length and depth of the shallow, and breadth\r\nof surface presented by pile and plank, subjected to the full sweep of\r\nthe tidal current from north to south, or rather at this point from east\r\nto west, aided and assisted by an increased flow of water from the\r\nAtlantic, we cannot be surprised at the result above mentioned.  It was\r\nfound necessary to support those left with additional piles placed\r\nhorizontally on the west side.  The effect produced by this costly groin\r\nwas an accumulation of sea-beach materials to the northward, extending\r\nabout thirty yards from the base of the cliff towards the sea, reaching\r\nto the top of the pile and plank; from thence an abrupt declination\r\nensued, and terminated at the part from whence the piles, &c., alluded to\r\nhad been removed.\r\n\r\nImmediately to the southward of this barrier scarcely any accumulation of\r\nsea-beach materials had taken place, and the sea was committing greater\r\nravages upon the cliffs adjoining than before. {44}\r\n\r\nThe plan of driving piles into the beach, for the purpose of retaining\r\nit, and encouraging materials to lodge on its surface, and consequently\r\nto break the force of the waves, has long been adopted on different\r\ncoasts in England; and where a continuation of them has been practised,\r\nin certain localities, seem to have been attended with success; in others\r\nthey have exhibited only a partial protection, from their temporary\r\nduration, and considerable inconvenience has been felt on coasts where\r\nshingle predominates, from pebbles pouring over in great numbers during\r\nheavy gales.\r\n\r\nThe immense quantity of sand displayed on this portion of the coast\r\naffords not only a different feature, but more gratifying results may be\r\nanticipated.  In Yarmouth, the sea has not advanced upon the sands in the\r\nslightest degree since the reign of Elizabeth, and where the town is\r\nbuilt became firm and habitable ground about the year 1008, from which\r\ntime a line of dunes has gradually increased in height and breadth,\r\nstretching across the whole entrance of the ancient estuary, and\r\nobstructing the ingress of the tides so completely, that they are only\r\nadmitted by a narrow passage, which the river keeps open, and which has\r\ngradually shifted several miles to the south. {45a}\r\n\r\nBy the exclusion of the sea, thousands of acres in the interior have\r\nbecome cultivated lands; and exclusive of small pools, upwards of sixty\r\nfresh water lakes have been formed, varying in depth from fifteen to\r\nthirty feet, and in extent from one to twelve hundred acres. {45b}\r\n\r\nThe benefit derived from the erection of piers at the Haven’s mouth, has,\r\nin conjunction with the jetty, afforded great protection to the town of\r\nYarmouth.  The tidal wave and current has been checked, the shore has\r\nbeen elevated, retained, and rendered wider to the northward, as far as\r\nWinterton; {45c} a shoal of sand has formed, and extends a considerable\r\ndistance into the sea, at right angles to the shore, beyond the\r\ntermination of the north pier, so that it has been found necessary to\r\nplace a buoy at its extremity, as a guide for the mariner to steer due\r\neast from the Haven’s Mouth to Yarmouth Roads.  The jetty, extending into\r\nthe sea upwards of four hundred and fifty feet, is now about to be added\r\nto, in consequence of the shallowness of the water.\r\n\r\nThe question now arises, would the jetty and piers have been so\r\nbeneficial, had they not been continued into the sea to the extent\r\nalluded to?  Certainly not.  The shoals of sand, which formerly existed\r\nin the offing, have been removed, or rather have been converted into a\r\nsolid mass; the current has been diverted from a southerly to a\r\nnorth-easterly direction, and the bed of the ocean nearest the shore has\r\nbeen elevated, and no doubt terminates into the sea upon an inclined\r\nplane.\r\n\r\nThe failure of groins, erected with pile and plank, appear to arise from\r\ntheir being placed in a wrong situation, from their not extending far\r\nenough into the sea, from the piles not being driven sufficiently into\r\nthe beach, and from their sudden elevation, present an abrupt surface for\r\nthe tidal wave to play upon, which during heavy gales of wind upon spring\r\ntides, cannot withstand its powerful effect, should the materials lying\r\nadjacent to or between them be removed.  Therefore they can only be\r\navailable where the interstices are completely filled with sea beach\r\nmaterials, and their durability must depend upon the latter cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATIVE POWER OF THE GERMAN OCEAN PROVED IN CERTAIN\r\nLOCALITIES.—ASSISTANCE GIVEN TO IT FROM THE STRANDING OF A VESSEL AT\r\nPURBECK, AND ON THIS COAST AT HASBOROUGH.—HILLS OF BLOWN SAND OR DUNES\r\nCONSIDERED—EXAMPLES OF THEIR STABILITY GIVEN AT WELLS, CLEY, &C., AND OF\r\nTHEIR INSTABILITY AT ECCLES, PALLING, &C.—SEA-BREACH COMMISSIONERS\r\nAPPOINTED.—THE ENGAGEMENT AND OPINIONS OF AN EMINENT ENGINEER IN\r\n1804.—CONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES of Nature endeavouring to combat with herself are shown from the\r\nimmense quantity of sand, shingle, &c., brought from low to high water\r\nmark, during the summer months, and should easterly winds prevail, the\r\nsand is removed towards the cliffs, and accumulates in some situations\r\nmore than in others.  Thus at Walcot, {47} a deposition of sea beach\r\nmaterials commenced in 1839, and gradually augmented from six to eight\r\nfeet in depth, within a distance of one mile and a half, and in a space\r\ncomprising a few yards, it attained a perpendicularity above the cliffs,\r\nextending to high water mark, and the tidal wave, even in a northerly\r\nwind, ebbed and flowed without disturbing its surface, from the above\r\nperiod to November, 1843.  A gale of wind then ensued from the\r\nnorth-west, upon a neap tide, which removed the greater part of the mound\r\nof sand, and a subsequent gale, upon a spring tide, in February, 1844,\r\nswept away the remainder.\r\n\r\nA similar instance of accumulation was observed to have taken place on\r\nthe Essex coast, commencing about the same period, and extended a\r\ndistance of seven miles, which appeared in December, 1843, likely to\r\nremain. {48a}\r\n\r\nThe flat shores at Wells {48b} are considerably elevated above the depths\r\nof the ocean, into which they probably terminate in a gradual descent.\r\nThe stranding of three large vessels off Winterton {48c} and Horsey,\r\n{48d} years ago, have possibly prevented its encroachments in these\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nWhen a vessel is stranded in shallow water, it usually becomes the\r\nnucleus of a sand-bank, as has been exemplified in several of our\r\nharbours, and this circumstance tends greatly to its preservation.\r\nBetween the years 1780 and 1790, a vessel from Purbeck, laden with three\r\nhundred tons of stone, struck on a shoal off the entrance of Poole\r\nharbour, and foundered; the crew were saved, but the vessel and cargo\r\nremain to this day at the bottom.—Since that period, the shoal at the\r\nentrance of the harbour has so extended itself in a westerly direction,\r\ntowards Peveril Point, in Purbeck, that the navigable channel is thrown a\r\nmile nearer that point.  The cause is obvious; the tidal current deposits\r\nthe sediment with which it is charged, around any object which checks its\r\nvelocity.  Matter also drifted along the bottom, is arrested by any\r\nobstacle, and accumulates round it, just as the African sand-winds raise\r\na small hillock over the carcase of every dead camel exposed on the\r\nsurface of the desert. {49a}\r\n\r\nUpon the 18th day of February, in the year 1807, the Hunter cutter, {49b}\r\nduring a heavy gale, struck on a shoal of sand in the offing, and finally\r\ndrifted into a shallow near the shore, about a quarter of a mile to the\r\nnorthward of the old cart gap, at Hasborough, the stern part towards the\r\ncliff.  In a very short time, sand, shingle, &c., accumulated around her,\r\nand completely filled the shallow to its utmost length.  Within twelve\r\nmonths after, several shoals and shallows showed themselves opposite the\r\ntown gap, evincing that the flowing of the tide had received a check,\r\nwhich proved an inconvenience to fishermen, as they had to heave their\r\nboats much farther before they could launch them into the sea; they were\r\nso aware that the Hunter cutter was the cause of this circumstance, that\r\nmany a harsh expression did they utter towards her.  In less than two\r\nyears, more than one hundred yards could be paced from her bows on the\r\nebbing of the tide to low water mark, and a large mound of sand\r\naccumulated between her stern and the cliff, which existed upwards of\r\ntwenty years, and arrested the devastation of the sea directly opposite.\r\nFrom subsequent gales, however, the cliffs were taken away to the\r\nnorthward, the water intruded behind the mound of sand, and entirely\r\nremoved it.  A greater proof of the check the waves had received was\r\nobserved at low water mark, a ridge of gravel was deposited and left\r\nundisturbed on the ebbing of the tide, extending from the Hunter cutter\r\nto Bacton coal gap, a distance of three miles to the northward; the first\r\nspring tide, however, swept away nearly the whole of the ridge of gravel,\r\nexcept that portion nearest the Hunter cutter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the benefit derived to the preservation of the cliffs from the\r\nstranding of the vessel has been entirely lost, still to the present time\r\nno shallows have formed immediately adjacent to her, and the beach would\r\nhave been higher than it now is, had her bulwarks, taffrel, &c., not been\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThe irruption of the sea, through the breaches in the dunes of sand,\r\n{50a} in the neighbourhood of Eccles, {50b} Horsey, {50c} Waxham, {50d}\r\n&c., having been attended with serious inconvenience and spoliation,\r\ncaused a body of highly respected and influential gentlemen to be\r\nappointed Sea-breach Commissioners, and in the year 1804, they engaged an\r\neminent Engineer, since deceased, who, among other information, gave it\r\nas his opinion, that if the shallows were all filled up, and the beach\r\nkept on an inclined plane, the sea would never gain on the Norfolk coast.\r\nHe did not, however, point out how such an assertion could be\r\nsubstantiated, or submit a plan to effect so desirable an object; but the\r\naccident occurring to the Hunter cutter, the effects produced from her\r\nimmersion in a cavity on the beach, the benefit in preserving the lands\r\nopposite for a long period, and the discontinuation of shallows forming\r\nin her immediate neighbourhood, at once indicate the truth of his\r\nassertion, and suggest the plan about to be submitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL FEATURES OF THE COAST.—THE VARIATION AND EFFECTS OF THE WIND\r\nFROM DIFFERENT POINTS CONSIDERED.\r\n\r\nTo combat successfully with so restless and powerful an agent as the\r\nocean, requires great consideration and attention; for the obstacles\r\npresented on this coast are of no ordinary character.  Among them may be\r\nenumerated powerful tides and currents, a confined space for a large body\r\nof water upon extraordinary occasions, cliffs of a soft yielding nature,\r\na limited and irregular shore, with cavities and projections, either a\r\ndead flat or hollow descent from low water mark towards the cliffs,\r\nconstitute a beach of the worst character.  The shoals of sand in the\r\noffing, in certain localities, are numerous and irregular, their\r\ndimensions and situation variable, and while they afford a partial\r\nprotection to the coast, are decidedly injurious to vessels liable to be\r\nstranded.\r\n\r\nTo make the sea subservient to our wishes, and agreeable to our design,\r\nin other words, to make it perform the duty of bringing its contents from\r\nthe bottom of its waters towards the cliffs, to protect them, if\r\npossible, for ages, let us consider its auxiliary, the wind, the effects,\r\nwhether beneficial or injurious.\r\n\r\nThe long-shore wind blowing from the north, but more particularly from\r\nthe north-west, causes the water, upon a spring tide, to remove, as\r\nbefore observed, materials from the beach, to undermine the cliffs, and\r\nshould a strong breeze have continued for two or three days previous from\r\nthe south-east, and suddenly veer to the former point, a heavier sea will\r\nbe the result on this part of the coast.  For the waters of the ocean,\r\nhaving been kept back by the south-east wind, cannot escape so readily,\r\nhad the superior force of what is commonly termed “the flood tide” from\r\nthe north, a tidal wave derived from the Atlantic, not been checked.  A\r\nsmall part of this wave passes eastward up the English Channel, and\r\nthrough the Straits of Dover, and then northwards, while the principal\r\nbody of water, moving much more rapidly to a more open sea on the western\r\nside of Britain, first passes the Orkney Islands, and then turning, flows\r\ndown between Norway and Scotland, and sweeps with great velocity along\r\nour eastern coast.\r\n\r\nThe lee shore wind, blowing from the north-east, removes the shoals of\r\nsand in the offing towards the shore, and wherever these find a resting\r\nplace, from the suddenness of their removal, quicksands are sure to\r\nexist; fortunately, however, not to so considerable a depth as mentioned\r\nby the celebrated Scottish Bard, in the fate attending the Master of\r\nRavensworth, but yet sufficiently alarming to render persons cautious how\r\nthey venture upon their surface, especially on horseback.  Wind blowing\r\nfrom the east produces these effects to a greater extent than from the\r\nnorth-east, and wind blowing from the south-east causes the sand on the\r\nsea-shore to be extremely loose and porous, while the north wind renders\r\nthe sand firm, solid, and compact.  Some years since, on one occasion,\r\nafter the formation of these sands, a vessel laden with timber, was\r\nstranded at Trimingham, near Cromer.  A waggon and horses being employed\r\nto convey the timber ashore, became immersed, and the latter could not be\r\nextricated, on account of their being attached to the waggon, until life\r\nwas extinct.  On the same day, a lady, riding on horseback between Horsey\r\nand Waxham, met with a similar accident, and was with difficulty released\r\nfrom her perilous situation.  When the wind changes to another quarter,\r\nthese sands disappear, and shoals are visible in their former situation.\r\n\r\nToo often does the unfortunate mariner experience the bitter effects of\r\nquicksands in immediate connection with the large shoal off Hasborough:\r\nwhile the surface on its inner side is covered with water eighteen or\r\ntwenty inches deep, within a short distance is as many fathoms.  Between\r\nthe spaces loose sands exist to a great depth; and, therefore, only those\r\nwell acquainted with this circumstance, can possibly escape destruction,\r\nfor should a vessel strike the fore part of her keel on the more solid\r\nportion of the shoal, numerous instances can be adduced where the stern\r\nhas sunk foremost into the quicksands, and hull, masts, and every thing\r\nbelonging to her, have been engulphed in a very short time, and\r\nsometimes, probably, before those on board have had an opportunity to\r\nmake their escape.\r\n\r\nAn off-shore wind on this coast blows from west to south, and causes all\r\nheavy bodies, stones, &c., to be brought towards the shore; which are\r\nleft between high and low water mark on the ebbing of the tide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL FEATURE OF THE CLIFFS CONSIDERED—CAUSES OF IRREGULARITY, AND\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL STRATA COMPOSING THEM.\r\n\r\nTHE cliffs {55} extending from Hasborough to or a little beyond Cromer,\r\nare found, upon approaching near, to be extremely irregular.  In some\r\nplaces small promontories or points project, in others small bays are\r\nformed, according to the influence of the sea, and the materials\r\ncomposing their structure.  Their perpendicularity is partially averted\r\nfrom the fallen masses deposited at their base; which, where the cliffs\r\nare lofty, are often considerable; arising either from the sand or clay\r\nbeneath the more solid strata being removed; or the landslips which\r\nensue, from fresh water springs abounding in certain localities.  Thus,\r\nin the winter of 1825, a fallen mass was precipitated from near the\r\nlight-house at Cromer, which covered twelve acres, extending far into the\r\nsea, the cliffs being two hundred and fifty feet in height; and Mr. Lyell\r\nobserves, the undermining by springs has caused large portions of the\r\nupper part of the cliffs, with houses still standing upon them, to give\r\nway, so that it is impossible, by erecting breakwaters at the base of the\r\ncliffs, permanently to ward off the danger.\r\n\r\nThe wasting of the cliffs is also accelerated from other causes—the\r\ncontinuation of strong north-easterly winds, of drought producing\r\nfissures from their superior surface downwards, heavy rains, and after\r\nsevere and successive frosts.\r\n\r\nThe cliffs generally consist of clay, sand, and loam.  By some writers\r\nthey have been termed mud cliffs, from their dark colour and general\r\nappearance.  Mr. Lyell includes them in a series called the Boulder\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nMr. Woodward, in his Outline of the Geology of Norfolk, considers them to\r\nbe of diluvial origin; but upon close inspection, they are found to\r\ncontain strata and fossils which partake of the characters and may be\r\nascribed to various parts of the tertiary period.\r\n\r\nThe cliffs form part of an extensive series, extending from Hasborough\r\nLighthouses to Weybourne, north-west of Cromer, comprising a distance of\r\nabout twenty miles, and are supposed continuously to rest upon chalk.\r\n\r\nIn some places the cliffs are very regularly stratified, presenting at\r\nvarious parts, layers of red and white sand, but in other places they are\r\nwholly devoid of stratification, exhibiting one continuous mass of till.\r\n\r\nThis position of the various strata will be found pretty correct:—\r\n\r\n                               Tertiary\r\nDiluvial            1 Brown clay: containing bones of the horse, ox,\r\n                    &c.\r\n\r\n                    2 Till\r\nNewer Pliocene      3 Crag\r\n\r\n                    4 Fresh water, lacustrine, lignite, &c.\r\nOlder Pliocene      5 Blue clay               containing bones of\r\n                                              elephants, rhinoceros,\r\n                    6 Red gravel              &c.\r\nEocene              7 Green sand: with bones of extinct mammalia.\r\n                    8 Chalk\r\n\r\nThe entire series of these cliffs bears evidence of great and successive\r\nchanges; the strata, in many places, are folded and bent, and\r\nsuperimposed upon others, which have undergone no dislocation whatever.\r\nOn the till, with an even horizontal surface, beds of laminated clay and\r\nsand are seen to repose, succeeded by vertical, bent, and contorted beds,\r\nhaving a covering of coarse gravel and flints.\r\n\r\nBetween Bacton and Mundsley, small pits or furrows may be seen at various\r\ndistances, from the top of the cliffs filled with fragments of white\r\nchalk; regular strata being superimposed.  Many of these furrows are\r\nseveral feet in width and depth.  In the till, to the east of Bacton,\r\nthese furrows are again largely developed.\r\n\r\nThe till and marl, layers of which are met with towards Mundsley,\r\nfrequently present grooved surfaces, and at different places appear to\r\ndip into the beach, the grooves left being filled with superimposed sand.\r\nThe gravel also takes a like dip.\r\n\r\nWhile on the one hand there are evidences which prove the slow deposition\r\nof some of these strata, on the other there are proofs of great\r\nconvulsions and derangement.\r\n\r\nAs a regular description of the separate strata may not prove\r\nuninteresting, let us inquire into the first—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis term is a provincial word, widely used in Scotland for similar\r\nmasses of unstratified matter, which contain boulders; and the same term\r\nhas been applied by Mr. Lyell to this part of the Norfolk strata.\r\n\r\nThe till is of a dark blue colour, somewhat resembling that of the London\r\nclay, and has been classed by some writers with that formation, because\r\nof the boulders with which it abounds.  Mr. Woodward calls it blue clay.\r\nA positive distinction between this and the regular blue clay, however,\r\nmust be made.\r\n\r\nThis till forms a large portion of the cliffs between Hasborough and\r\nMundsley, rising in some places from twenty to nearly eighty feet in\r\nperpendicular height.—The whole of its organic remains appears to have\r\nbeen washed from other formations, to be deposited in it, and it\r\ncontains, mingled with them, fragments of almost every rock of the\r\nsecondary and primary series; comprehending immense blocks of granite,\r\nporphry, greenstone, oolite, lias, chalk, pebbles, trap, micaceous chist,\r\nsand-stones of various kinds, chert, marl, &c.  Near Hasborough it is\r\nmuch intermingled with chalk.\r\n\r\nThe second stratum, as we descend beneath the till, is the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAG.\r\n\r\n\r\nA layer of which, between the watch-house and coal gaps at Bacton, has\r\nbeen termed by Mr. Lyell hard ferruginous crag.  It consists of several\r\nthin plates, containing compressed wood, fragmentary and whole shells,\r\nintermixed with clay, gravel, and white sand.  This bed forms a dip\r\ntowards the north-west, having a support of red sand on the one side, and\r\ngreen sand on the other.  A section of the crag is more largely developed\r\nat Cromer, Runton, and Weybourne.  Between Bacton coal gap and Mundsley,\r\nvertical layers of crag occur, composed of thickly cemented fragments of\r\nshells.\r\n\r\nImmediately beneath the crag occur those formations which are generally\r\ntermed Fresh Water, consisting of lignite and lacustrine deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLACUSTRINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt several spots between Hasborough and Mundsley, these deposits may be\r\nexamined.  They contain many species of shells, with fish and bones of\r\nmammalia.\r\n\r\nThe first of these occurs at a place called Ostend, between Hasborough\r\nand Bacton, about half a mile from the latter place.  It is composed of\r\nbluish mud, with occasional patches of brown clay, and extends several\r\nyards along the beach.  This formation was discovered by Mr. Green, in\r\nAugust, 1841.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred yards from the forest peat at Bacton, the second\r\nlacustrine bed occurs.  It is confined to occasional patches about the\r\nmiddle of the cliff, near the watch-house gap.  The shells are deposited\r\nin thin layers of sand and blue clay, containing much wood, which appears\r\nas if bored by some insect.\r\n\r\nThe third lacustrine formation is at the village of Mundsley, and is\r\ndistinguished from the other cliffs by its dark muddy appearance.  Its\r\nheight is about twenty feet, and it extends one hundred yards along the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nMr. Lyell, referring to this bed, says, “It consists of brown, black, and\r\ngrey sand, and loam mixed with vegetable matter, sometimes almost passing\r\ninto a kind of peaty earth, containing much pyrites.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGNITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis name has been given to extensive forest beds, containing much\r\ncarbonized wood.\r\n\r\nThe deposit prevails very generally along the Norfolk coast, and may be\r\ninstructively examined at Hasborough, Bacton, Mundsley, Trimingham, and\r\nCromer.\r\n\r\nAt Bacton extensive sections are laid bare after high tides.  They are\r\nmostly formed of black peaty earth, which may be separated into thin\r\nlayers, and has generally an aluminous taste, and abounds with pyrites.\r\n\r\nAt Bacton the depth of these sections, from the top of the cliff, is\r\nabout five feet; at Ostend, between Bacton and Hasborough, about thirty,\r\nand at Mundsley, one hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThese deposits are occasionally mixed with masses of red sand, containing\r\npipes of hard clay.\r\n\r\nThis formation presents the appearance of a wood, having been overthrown\r\nand crushed in situ; for after strong north-west winds, the stumps of the\r\ntrees may be seen really standing, with their strong roots extended, and\r\nintermingling with each other.  In the winter of 1840–41, Mr. Green\r\nmeasured some of these trunks, which were then exposed about a foot from\r\nthe root.—One measured five feet eleven inches round, and the other five\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nWhilst at Bacton this bed is formed of black peaty earth, at Ostend it is\r\nmixed with a greenish sand.  Mr. Lyell speaks of that at Hasborough as\r\n“laminated blue clay, about one foot and a half in thickness, part of the\r\nclay being bituminous, and inclosing compressed branches and leaves of\r\ntrees.”\r\n\r\nMr. R. C. Taylor, in his Geology of Eastern Norfolk, observes of the\r\ndeposit generally:—“It consists of forest peat, containing fir cones and\r\nfragments of bones; in others of woody clay; and elsewhere, of large\r\nstools of trees, standing thickly together, the stems appearing to have\r\nbeen broken off about eighteen inches from the base.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. James Layton, cited by Mr. Fairholme in his Geology, states, in\r\na letter, “the line of crushed wood, leaves, grass, &c., frequently\r\nforming a bed of peat, extends just above low water mark.  About this\r\nstratum, numerous remains of mammalia are found, the horns and bones of\r\nat least four kinds of deer, the horse, the ox, hippopotamus, rhinoceros,\r\nand elephant.  These fossil remains are found at Hasborough and its\r\nneighbourhood, on the denuded clay shore.  At Mundsley, they are found in\r\nthe cliff.  This stratum may be seen as the underlying formation, along\r\nthe whole line of beach from Eccles to Mundsley.”\r\n\r\nAt Cromer, Mr. Simons has observed, beneath the drift, several feet below\r\nhigh water mark, a bed of lignite, in which were found the seeds of\r\nplants, &c.  He also observed ten or more trees, in the space of half an\r\nacre, exposed below the cliffs eastward of that town, the stumps being a\r\nfew inches, all less than a foot, in vertical height, some no less than\r\nnine or ten feet in girth, the roots spreading from them on all sides,\r\nthroughout a space of twenty feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nMr. Richard Taylor believes this bed, as visible at Hasborough, to be an\r\nextension of the well-known stratum at Watton cliff and Harwich.  “There\r\nis,” he says, “evidence sufficient to prove that it extends more south\r\nthan Palling, even as low down as Winterton, and Caister; also at\r\nLowestoft.”\r\n\r\nThe two last strata nearest the chalk are the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE CLAY AND THE RED GRAVEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two beds “seem to have been deposited contemporaneously, as they\r\nare much intermixed, and every where contain the same species of\r\nmammalian remains.  From the unusual quantity of bones contained in these\r\nstrata, they have been provincially termed the Bone Rocks, but from the\r\nimmense quantity of elephants’ bones annually exhumed, they may, for the\r\nsake of distinction, be termed the Elephant Beds.”  In some places the\r\nblue clay is deposited upon the red gravel.\r\n\r\nThe red gravel appears to be composed of rolled materials, which no doubt\r\nhave been brought to this place from some distance.  It comprehends a\r\nmixture of red sand and gravel, ferruginous and ochraceous nodules; blue\r\nclay, peat, sulphur, loam, flints, pebbles, masses of granite, porphry,\r\nfragments of and whole bones, and is much mineralized by iron.\r\n\r\nThese rocks are traceable to a considerable distance beyond Cromer.\r\n\r\nThe immediate bed upon which the strata rests appears to be\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHALK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is met with about half a mile north-west of Mundsley, about low\r\nwater mark, and for upwards of a mile forms the beach.  Near Trimingham\r\nthree very remarkable protuberances, which rise up and form a part of\r\nlofty cliffs.  Further northward, masses of chalk are included in the\r\ndrift, or crop out in the interior, at a short distance from the shore,\r\nas at Overstrand, near Cromer, where a pit has been worked, in which the\r\nchalk is in a very disturbed and shattered state.  At Cromer, the chalk\r\nhas been again detected, and is every where the fundamental rock, lying\r\nabout the level of low water, and rising on the north of that town, to\r\nthe height of some yards above the level.  At Sherringham it ascends\r\nabove high water mark, and enters largely, from thence to Weybourne, into\r\nthe strata of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nFrom the appearance then of so much chalk in the immediate neighbourhood,\r\nand some of it apparently in an undisturbed state, as may be seen by its\r\nhorizontal layers of flint at Sherringham, beyond doubt its existence may\r\nbe concluded both to the east as well as the north.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1836, the humerus bone probably of the Great Mastodon, was\r\nfound at Bacton, after a very high tide, one side of which, from the\r\nappearance it presents, must have reposed upon chalk.  This bone was\r\ndiscovered in the red gravel, which, in many places, is the nearest bed\r\nto the chalk.  Fragments of chalk are attached to the bone.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of this year the tibia probably of the same animal, was\r\nexposed, and obtained after a high tide by Mr. Green, in whose possession\r\nit still remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS UPON THE CLIFFS CONTINUED.—LAND-SPRINGS, THEIR INJURIOUS\r\nEFFECTS, WITH PLAN TO COUNTERACT THEM.—REDUCTION OF THE CLIFFS CONSIDERED\r\nADVISABLE, ESPECIALLY WHERE GREAT IRREGULARITIES IN SAND DUNES EXIST,\r\nWITH A PLAN TO INCREASE THEIR HEIGHT WHERE NECESSARY.\r\n\r\nHAVING considered the cliffs with respect to the contour they present,\r\nthe different strata composing their structure, the injury they\r\nexperience from the atmospheric air, from drought, from heavy rains, from\r\nsevere and successive frosts, and from the formidable visitations of the\r\nGerman Ocean against their base; yet, they possess an internal enemy\r\npeculiar to themselves, which in certain localities is more formidable\r\nthan the ocean itself—these are the Land-springs previously alluded to.\r\n\r\nTo check their baneful influence is a task that requires consideration,\r\nfor although we know their existence, we cannot tell whether they arise\r\nfrom a broad or a narrow surface, at a great depth, or at a considerable\r\ndistance from whence they are seen to issue; and although so serious in\r\ntheir consequences, yet the extent arising from such contingencies, on\r\nthis part of the coast, is generally limited.\r\n\r\nWherever they abound, the cliffs ought, where practicable, to be reduced\r\nfrom a perpendicular to an inclined plane; then let stakes, or rather\r\nstrong piles, be driven in a parallel direction to the extent required,\r\nand sufficiently deep into the solid strata beneath, at short distances\r\none from another, with splines fastened horizontally, or what would be\r\npreferable, strong wooden faggots interposed between the piles and the\r\ncliffs, especially where the materials consist of a loose texture; these\r\nwould be found efficient, until a more natural, solid, and lasting\r\nsupport could be obtained.\r\n\r\nGreat benefit might be derived by sinking wells on the inner or land side\r\nof the cliffs, subjected to their influence; for at Trimingham, the loss\r\nof four acres and a half of land, mentioned in a previous chapter, is\r\nprimarily attributed to a foolish individual, who a few months before\r\nfilled up three wells in the immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe question now comes—would it not be advisable to remove generally,\r\nwhere practicable, the taller, cliffs?—Possibly it would.\r\n\r\n1st.  The air in heavy gales of wind would not be so much condensed\r\nagainst their base, and add so much weight to the waves when nearing the\r\nshore as is now evidently the case, and the latter would be less liable\r\nto disarrange the legitimate beach during its formation.\r\n\r\n2ndly.  Wherever land-springs abound, an egress for the fresh water would\r\nensue, without causing shoots of land to take place, where the former\r\nexist beyond or rather above the reach of the stakes recommended, which\r\nmight retard the formation of the legitimate beach.\r\n\r\n3rdly.—It will be decidedly applicable, where dunes or hills of blown\r\nsand from their irregularity, produced from the north-east winds, are\r\nreduced to an extent liable to admit an irruption of the sea, observable\r\nat Eccles, Palling, &c.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly.  The application of a plough in a locality where such\r\nfissures exist, upon the plan recommended in the ensuing chapter; and due\r\nattention to the transplanting the marram {67} from time to time as\r\nrequired, will accomplish the rest without directly interfering with the\r\nland belonging to private individuals on the inner side of those banks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR’S PLAN FOR EVENTUALLY COUNTERACTING THE INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF\r\nTHE GERMAN OCEAN ALONG THE EASTERN COAST OF NORFOLK, COMPRISED WITHIN A\r\nDISTANCE OF THIRTY MILES, EXTENDING FROM WINTERTON-NESS TO OR A LITTLE\r\nBEYOND CROMER.—A PLAN FOR THE ERECTION OF JETTIES SUBMITTED, &C.\r\n\r\nTHE knowledge gained upon this interesting subject, the instances\r\nadverted to in the former chapter, prove almost beyond a doubt, that the\r\nquestion—Whether art can arrest the progress of the German Ocean along\r\nthe Norfolk coast? may be answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nThe first and greatest desideratum necessary to be obtained is a bold\r\nshore, formed by a legitimate beach, a term applied by the eminent\r\nengineer, previously alluded to, who stated its ascent should be three\r\ninches and a half in the yard, which would realize seventeen feet and a\r\nhalf in two hundred and ten yards; a height which no sea upon this coast\r\ncould ever reach.\r\n\r\nFrom there being plenty of materials in the offing, the ascent could be\r\nmore gradual, which would be preferable, for a two-fold object must be\r\nkept in view; the one, for the preservation of the lands in the interior;\r\nthe other, for the safety of mariners, should misfortune attend and\r\ncompel them to run their vessel ashore.  Besides the more abruptly a body\r\npresents itself, whether natural or artificial, to the almost\r\nirresistible force of the tidal wave, when called into excessive action,\r\nthe less it is likely to remain stable and compact.  It will therefore be\r\nnecessary to ascertain the extent of the shoals existing in the offing,\r\nand the elevation likely to be realized may easily be calculated.\r\n\r\nA single row of piles driven into the beach at right angles to the shore,\r\nwherever a shallow exists, will be sufficient, with plank fastened to\r\nthem, to encourage the materials, brought by the tidal wave and current,\r\nto be retained and lodged against them.  The length of the piles\r\nnecessary, must depend upon the supposed elevation required, taking into\r\nconsideration, not only the depth of the sand lying at the bottom of the\r\nshallow, but also the strata beneath.  In a very short time, by gradually\r\nadding the plank, the shallow will become filled up, and the tidal wave\r\nwill pass over without disturbing its surface, the same plan must be\r\nadopted wherever a shallow exists at low water mark, but possibly the\r\ndifficulty of applying the plank in that situation cannot be so easily\r\naccomplished; consequently a greater number of piles will be required, as\r\nthey must be inserted near to each other.\r\n\r\nAfter a shallow has been filled to the level of the beach then existing,\r\nand the upper part of the pile still projecting, let plank, if necessary,\r\nbe gradually added about one or two feet in breadth at a time, as the\r\ndeposition accumulates.\r\n\r\nProceeding onwards into the sea as opportunity offers, some portion of\r\nthe shoals will be removed into the shallows; another, probably, will be\r\ncarried towards the cliffs.  To facilitate this object, let a long tined\r\nharrow be fastened to the stern of a boat, which being urged by men, will\r\nloosen the materials on the surface of a shoal; and the flowing of the\r\nwater will carry them, if the wind is in a favourable quarter, towards\r\nthe shore, and thus will the beach become a consolidated body, with\r\nsuperabundant materials deposited at high water mark: these of course\r\nmust be removed towards the cliffs.  If the materials consist principally\r\nof sand, a plough might be employed with considerable advantage, turning\r\nthe furrows inward towards the cliffs; on the contrary, should stones\r\npredominate, they must be deposited at the base of the cliffs.  Easterly\r\nwinds will remove the loose dry sand towards and fill up the spaces\r\nbetween them.  Many suggestions, however, to expedite the work will\r\npresent themselves upon inspection and trial. {70}\r\n\r\nThe distance required from one row of piles to another must also depend\r\nupon circumstances.  Wherever the sea reaches in, should a shallow or\r\nflat exist, there piles will be necessary, as well as to the southward of\r\nit, which will greatly accelerate the deposition of materials where they\r\nare so much required.\r\n\r\n  [Picture: The breakwater, shewing the supposed elevation of the beach\r\n   from the deposit of sand.  D. Hodgson, delt.  C. Graf, Lith. to Her\r\n                                 Majesty]\r\n\r\nDiscrimination will also be necessary in the application of the piles;\r\nfor a minute and continuous observer will perceive it frequently happens,\r\nthe alteration of a current and the wind favouring it, the sea will reach\r\nin towards the cliffs, and undermine and excavate one locality, while\r\nanother, previously visited, will become filled up by materials dislodged\r\nfrom the former place. {71}  In the latter instance, piles will not be\r\nrequired to be applied immediately, for probably some of the materials,\r\nirregularly accumulated, will be requisite to be shifted to their former\r\nsituation.  Hence the reason of applying piles to the southward and not\r\nto the northward of a locality requiring immediate assistance.\r\n\r\nAgain, considerable difference in the insertion of the piles must be made\r\naccording to the contour the beach presents; between a distance\r\ncontinuously flat, and a shallow that only requires to be filled up.  In\r\nthe latter a few piles inserted from west to east, will answer extremely\r\nwell; in the former, an opposite direction must be pursued; that is, from\r\nthe north-west to the south-east, according to the accompanying plate,\r\nfor the sweep of the water must be taken into consideration, and also the\r\nnecessity for encouraging sea-beach materials to accumulate to the\r\nsouthward of a groin, as well as to the northward.  Upon this our final\r\nsuccess depends.\r\n\r\nWhile the above plan presents the least resistance to the tidal wave when\r\nmost agitated, the tidal current will be checked and rendered powerless,\r\nand the gradual elevation, from the deposition of materials, will produce\r\nthe effects exhibited by the breaking of the waves on a shelving shore;\r\nand, as they roll onwards, their power will become diminished, by wanting\r\nweight and depth to aid their motion.\r\n\r\nIn several places on this beach, the sand, shingle, &c., do not exceed\r\nfour feet in depth, and in some instances are still shallower; thus at\r\nCromer, a large body of calcareous deposition exists, and projects above\r\nthe beach at low water mark; but between that and the cliffs, now\r\ntemporarily protected by a sea wall, a shallow or cavity of considerable\r\nlength and depth must have existed: this induced the inhabitants, who had\r\nwitnessed the good the jetty had effected (previous to the injury Cromer\r\nsustained, and alluded to in a former chapter), to insert a groin\r\nimmediately to the southward, or rather westward, of the town,\r\neighty-four yards in length.\r\n\r\nThe shallow or cavity became filled up to the top of the groin, and a\r\nquantity of sea-beach material, consisting principally of sand, seemed\r\ndisposed to accumulate against the base of the walls in June, 1844, but\r\nunfortunately the groin was not sufficiently extended towards the sea;\r\nthe piles, instead of projecting above, did not equal in height the mound\r\nalluded to, and consequently it is not so efficacious as it would\r\notherwise have been.\r\n\r\nThe jetty too has some influence towards prohibiting a still further\r\nproof of the efficacy of this groin, at least along shore to the\r\nnorthward, or rather eastward; for rude in construction, it is ill\r\ncalculated to effect a twofold object, which ought to arise from it.  The\r\nplatform resting upon piles of huge dimensions in height and diameter,\r\nappears to have been one continuous length, from the base of the cliffs\r\nto the elevated rock at low water mark.  Its considerable altitude above\r\nthe surface of the beach, its unwieldy structure, from the timbers\r\nemployed, and above all, its extent towards the sea being limited,\r\naccounts for its partial destruction in the storm alluded to.  The\r\ndashing of the waves against the piles, even in calm weather, gives an\r\nimpetus to the water at their base, and produces eddies or whirlpools,\r\nwhich prevent sea-beach materials accumulating in the immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants, however, appear so far to have been aware of this\r\ncircumstance, that in repairing the jetty, they had recourse to iron\r\nstanchions, presenting a flat surface towards the sea; but the same\r\nimpediment to utility still exists.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider whether a jetty could not be constructed to afford\r\nnot only a delightful promenade, the necessary appendage to a frequented\r\nwatering place, but the retention of sea-beach materials, and the\r\nconsequent elevation of the beach.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose let wooden piles of English oak be employed, of\r\nrequisite length to enter the solid strata beneath the surface of the\r\nbeach.  The extremity for insertion must be pointed and shod with iron,\r\nand the opposite end must be protected with a rim of the same material,\r\nwhich ought to project above each pile, so as to leave a cavity\r\nsufficiently deep to receive the one end of an iron pillar, about eight\r\nor more inches in diameter, if considered necessary; and the length of\r\nthis iron pillar being determined, its upper part can be readily formed\r\nto support the wooden plank constituting the platform of the jetty, to\r\nwhich it can be fastened.  Now, if the piles are inserted into the beach\r\nin a continuous range towards the sea, leaving a space between each\r\npillar, from two to three feet apart, it may readily be inferred, that\r\nthe desirable object will be realized, and a permanent good will be\r\nobtained.  The expense, in the first instance, will of course be\r\nconsiderable, but its durability and usefulness ought to supersede such\r\nan obstacle.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of congratulation to observe considerable economy in the\r\nexpenditure which so great an undertaking requires, can be effected by\r\nusing, in a general way, the Pinus Sylvestris, or red fir, grown in the\r\nneighbouring plantations; {74} these, if taken down in the winter months,\r\ntrimming them, and depositing them in the sea, in readiness for insertion\r\nas opportunity suits, will retain their resinous properties in the\r\ngreatest abundance, and prevent the exudation, which an exposure to the\r\nspring and summer months would inevitably produce.  Upon the resin they\r\ncontain their toughness depends, and by adopting the above plan, and\r\nusing those small in diameter, the instrument necessary for propelling\r\nthem into the beach, will not disturb the surface of the pile most\r\nexposed to its influence.  The following instance will prove their\r\ndurability, and that a careful insertion of the piles is only necessary\r\nto render their stability certain, even if extraordinary gales should\r\ncause the legitimate beach to be disturbed.\r\n\r\nAt Mundsley, several years ago, not within the memory of the oldest\r\ninhabitant, some fishermen drove four piles, six inches in diameter, into\r\nthe beach, between high and low water mark, for the purpose of forming\r\nwhat is termed a coy, for containing lobsters caught at sea, until an\r\nopportunity for their disposal occurred.  To the piles were attached some\r\nboards, so as to form a square, within which was placed a box for their\r\nreception; and a piece of wood, fastened upon the top, prevented the box\r\nfrom being disturbed by the water.  At length, however, it became\r\ndisused, the boards attached to the piles gave way, but the latter still\r\nremain firmly imbedded in the strata beneath, and their tops are only\r\nvisible when north and north-west winds prevail, the sand lying around,\r\nabove, and between them being then removed.\r\n\r\nThe shipowner, and above all the hardy sailor, cannot but rejoice at the\r\nprospect of obtaining a broad beach upon an inclined plane, for should a\r\nvessel be driven on in ever so heavy a gale, instead of having to contend\r\nwith the cheerless prospect now before them, rendered not only\r\nformidable, but terrible, from the numerous shoals existing on this\r\ncoast, there would be only one, and the vessel would arrive at its\r\ndestination in a more gradual manner; her keel would become almost\r\nimmediately impacted in the sand to such an extent, as to render her\r\nsteady; for the waves having to attain an ascent, would be checked in\r\ntheir career, and for want of depth, would neither be able to injure the\r\nvessel nor destroy the mariner: hitherto, the great power they possess\r\nhas, in many instances, dashed the former to pieces after she had struck\r\nthe beach, and the latter has been hurled towards it, either too\r\nsuddenly, or by their rebounding, swept into the depths below; while he,\r\npoor creature, so long as consciousness or presence of mind exists, uses\r\nhis feeble efforts to reach the blessed shore, but, alas! too frequently\r\nin vain; he either sinks, to be wafted to another, a lifeless, mangled\r\ncorpse, or arrives too late to be saved, even if the vibration of the\r\nheart exists, for want of proper accommodation and attention.  If a\r\nlegitimate beach could be once formed, a little exertion and assistance\r\nfrom those on shore, would be able to rescue him from the now almost\r\ninevitable destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nLET not the plan proposed in the previous chapter make too hasty an\r\nimpression, or cause the reader to be too sanguine as to the result,\r\nhowever it may bear the semblance to truth and reality; but, if upon\r\ninquiry, consideration, and inspection, it is found to originate in\r\nfacts, not theory alone, let no longer time be wasted in delaying a trial\r\nof its efficacy than is really necessary.\r\n\r\nFor a series of years, the wondrous body of waters has committed most\r\ndreadful ravages upon this and other coasts, not only to the loss of\r\nproperty, but what is of far greater consequence, human life.\r\n\r\nMany countries, that have been destroyed, bear melancholy witness to the\r\ntruth of history, and show the tops of their houses and the spires of\r\ntheir steeples, still standing at the bottom of the water.  The German\r\nSea has advanced upon the shores of Holland near Catt, that the ruins of\r\nan ancient citadel of the Romans, which was formerly built upon the\r\ncoast, are now actually under water.  In Friezland and Zealand, there are\r\nmore than three hundred villages overwhelmed, and their ruins continue\r\nstill visible on a clear day.  The Baltic Sea has by slow degrees covered\r\na large part of Pomerania, and among others destroyed and overwhelmed the\r\nfamous port of Vineta.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable inundations recorded in history, occurred in\r\nthe reign of Henry I., which overwhelmed the estates of the Earl Godwin,\r\nand formed the bank now called the Goodwin Sands.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1546, a similar irruption of the sea destroyed a thousand\r\npersons in the territory of Dort, and a yet greater number round Dullart.\r\nTo these accidents several more might be added; our own historians and\r\nthose of other countries abound with them; almost every flat shore of any\r\nextent being able to show something it has lost, or something it has\r\ngained from the sea.\r\n\r\nThere are some shores on which the sea, where it has overflowed, and\r\nafter remaining perhaps some ages, has again retired of its own accord,\r\nor been driven back by the industry of man, which, if applied in the case\r\nsubmitted, would, we earnestly pray, verify the words contained in the\r\n5th chapter of the prophet Jeremiah, and the 22nd verse.  And should this\r\ndesign be found to answer, who is there can deny that, by continued\r\nattention and perseverance, not only will the lands in future be\r\nprotected, but those which now appear lost, may in after years be\r\nregained, and that the saving of human life will be considerable.\r\n\r\nThere are many lands in Norway, Scotland, and the Maldivia Islands, that\r\nare at one time covered with water, at another time free.  The country\r\nround the Isle of Ely, in the time of Bede, about a thousand years ago,\r\nwas one of the most delightful spots in the whole kingdom; it was not\r\nonly cultivated, and produced all the necessaries of life, but grapes\r\nalso, that afforded excellent wine.  The accounts of the time are copious\r\nin the description of its verdure and fertility, its rich pastures\r\ncovered with flowers and herbage, its beautiful shades and wholesome air.\r\nBut the sea breaking in upon the land, overwhelmed the whole country,\r\ntook possession of the soil, and totally destroyed one of the most\r\nfertile vallies in the world; its air, from being dry and healthful, from\r\nthat time became unwholesome, and the small part of the country, which by\r\nbeing higher than the rest escaped the deluge, was soon rendered\r\nuninhabitable from its noxious vapours.  The island continued under water\r\nsome centuries, till at last the sea, by the same caprice which had\r\nprompted its invasion, began to abandon the earth in like manner.  It has\r\ncontinued for some ages to relinquish its former conquests; and although\r\nthe inhabitants can neither boast the longevity nor the luxuries of the\r\noriginal possessors, yet they find ample means of subsistence, and if\r\nthey happen to survive the first years of residence there, they are often\r\nknown to arrive at a good old age.\r\n\r\nOn this coast several manors and large portions of the neighbouring\r\nparishes have been swallowed up; nor has there been any intermission,\r\nfrom time immemorial, in the ravages of the sea within a distance of\r\ntwenty miles in length in which these places stood.\r\n\r\nMany a poor fisherman has lost his life within sight of his parents,\r\nwife, and children, whose uplifted hands, streaming eyes, and shrieks of\r\nwild despair, proclaimed the pangs they endured, the agony they suffered,\r\nat losing their offspring, their husband, their father; and this too,\r\nwhen the tenderest ties of affection endeared them to each other; on a\r\nsudden lost, gone for ever! leaving those behind, who, if not bereaved of\r\ntheir senses entirely, remain during their sojourn in this vale of tears,\r\nfor ever broken-hearted and disconsolate.  This gloomy picture may appear\r\nover-drawn; but, alas! it is too true and melancholy to think of, where\r\nsuch accidents are frequent, and likely to continue till time shall be no\r\nmore.  But there is a ray of hope, that the object which appears so\r\ndifficult to accomplish, may eventually be attained by the industry of\r\nman, with the means given and transmitted from the acquisition of\r\nknowledge, through an Allwise and Merciful Creator.  Let us earnestly\r\npray that His blessing may be bestowed upon our humble endeavours, to the\r\nfulfilment of this or a superior design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBacton or Backton, termed in the Doomsday Book Baketuna, is situated\r\nabout four miles and a half north-east by east of North Walsham.  From\r\nbordering on the sea, it continually experiences its devastating effects,\r\nwhich is the more to be regretted, as the land, about 1600 acres, is\r\nextremely fertile.\r\n\r\nThe Church, dedicated to St. Andrew, is a neat edifice, situated on\r\nelevated ground, about a quarter of a mile distant from the sea; and the\r\ninterior, though unadorned with costly monuments, contains several neat\r\nstones to record departed worth.\r\n\r\nThe venerable relic of Norman grandeur Broomholme Priory, generally\r\ntermed Bacton Abbey, is situated in the centre of the village, and from\r\nits being in a better state of preservation than probably any other in\r\nthis county, which possesses the astonishing number of one hundred and\r\ntwenty-two, is ever a source of interest to the lovers of antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe architectural style of the Priory of Broomholme appears to be that of\r\nthe Norman and the early or lancet gothic united.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the General History of the County of Norfolk says: “A part\r\nof its architecture is so entirely of the same style as Norwich\r\nCathedral, that it can scarcely be doubted but they are of the same era.”\r\n\r\nThe north transept, with its triforium arches, many of which still\r\nremain, bears some resemblance to those of Norwich Cathedral and the\r\nChurch of St. Nicholas, Yarmouth.\r\n\r\nThe churches generally were built in the form of the latin cross,\r\nterminating at the end in a semi-circular apsis.  The internal elevations\r\nconsisted of three divisions, the lower arches—the triforium, occupying\r\nthe space between the vaulting and external roof of the side aisles—and\r\nthe celestory.\r\n\r\nThe circular arched entrance north of the transept appears to be built of\r\nCaen stone, and though plain, attests the origin of at least this part of\r\nthe building.  To the east a very lofty arch presents itself of the early\r\ngothic.\r\n\r\nThe chapter-house has a very large window of the early pointed gothic,\r\nsupposed to have been added in the reign of Henry the VII, but it appears\r\nof a much earlier date.\r\n\r\nThe arcades of the face of the interior walls are very plain and simple;\r\nand are intended to take off the effect of a large extent of plain\r\nsurface as the windows are but small.  This appears to have been general\r\nin all Norman architecture.\r\n\r\nThe chimney is very modern, as the builders of the middle ages gave the\r\npreference to warming their halls by a central hearth, leaving the smoke\r\nto blacken the roof and escape as it best might by an open lantern.\r\n\r\nThe niche in the north transept, which bears traces of the ornamental\r\ngothic, was probably added with other parts of the building, as the abbey\r\nincreased in fame and opulence.\r\n\r\nThe following are the supposed dimensions of the various buildings, &c.:—\r\n\r\nThe church          112 feet\r\nNorth transept      22 feet by 18 feet\r\nChancel             23 feet\r\nQuadrangle          73 feet by 47 feet\r\nCloister            76 feet by 21 feet\r\nLarge hall          100 feet by 24 feet\r\n\r\nThis priory was founded in 1113, by William de Glanville, in the reign of\r\nHenry the First, for monks of the order of Cluni, as a cell to Castleacre\r\npriory.  Here the monks of the latter sent their junior brethren, when\r\ntoo much crowded at home, or refractory monks, to do penance for non\r\ncompliance with monastic rules.  Subsequently, Bartholomew de Glanville,\r\nwho was Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, confirmed the priory of\r\nCastleacre to this priory.—The first prior was inducted to the abbey in\r\nthe reign of Henry the First, and the last in the reign of Henry the\r\nEighth.\r\n\r\nThe monks attached to this establishment appear, according to early\r\nhistorians, to have derived great profit from a cross, said to have been\r\nmade out of that part of the Saviour’s cross to which the hands and feet\r\nwere attached, particularly the part where it was most sprinkled with his\r\nblood; and Capgrave informs us, “that no fewer than thirty-nine were\r\nraised from the dead, and nineteen blind persons had their sight restored\r\nby it.”\r\n\r\nIn this priory were also preserved the “girdle for Zona, and milk of the\r\nblessed Virgin, and fragments of the crosses of St. Peter and St.\r\nAndrew.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the rage for relics in former times, that Mabillon, a\r\nBenedictine, complained that the altars were loaded with counterfeits;\r\nnumerous spurious ones being every where offered to the piety and\r\ndevotion of the faithful.  He also observes, “that bones were often\r\nconsecrated, which so far from belonging to the saints, probably never\r\nbelonged to Christians!”  To shew how far this fraud extended, the\r\n“girdle” of the Virgin Mary, said to have been possessed by the monastery\r\nof Broomholme, was shown to the visitors appointed by Henry the Eighth,\r\nin eleven different places.\r\n\r\nThe following “Legendary Fragment,” written by an intimate friend of the\r\nAuthor’s, may not be deemed inappropriate:—\r\n\r\n   Broomholme, thy ruined grandeur tells\r\n      A saddening tale of man’s decay,\r\n   It speaks how all his glories pass,\r\n      How all his relics droop away;\r\n   How all his efforts fall a prey\r\n      To Desolation’s ruthless reign,\r\n   How all the records he would trace\r\n      The hand of Time outblots again.\r\n\r\n   Thou hast looked forth for ages past,\r\n      And seen the unwearying ebb and flow\r\n   Of yonder calm and azure sea,\r\n      Glittering in summer’s golden glow;\r\n   And oh! how many a winter’s snow\r\n      Hath wrapped thee in its spotless vest,\r\n   How many a Spring with cheerful hand\r\n      Thy fair domain in beauty drest.\r\n\r\n   How oft within thy ruined fane\r\n      Has many a haughty zealot knelt,\r\n   And muttered o’er some holy prayer\r\n      His thankless heart had never felt:\r\n   Thou’st heard the groans of souls that melt\r\n      With anguish and repentance cleft,\r\n   Who, though engulphed in blood and crime,\r\n      Had yet the hope of mercy left.\r\n\r\n   Oh! could yon gloomy pile reveal\r\n      The thousand tales its records bear,\r\n   And rend the dark mysterious seal\r\n      That Time has fixed for ever there,\r\n   Perchance ’twould tell of pain and care,\r\n      The same unvarying round of woe,\r\n   The same dark chain of human ills\r\n      That links us all to life below.\r\n\r\n   ’Twould tell of horrors dark and dire,\r\n      That well the sternest heart might thrill,\r\n   How man with rapine, sword, and fire,\r\n      Had wrought with zeal his brother’s ill.\r\n   Strange that ungrateful man should fill\r\n      The cup of woe, for pride or pelf,\r\n   Yet madly, fondly, vainly hope,\r\n      To taste the streams of bliss himself.\r\n\r\n   ’Twould tell how bright, to Childhood’s eyes,\r\n      The glory of existence seems,\r\n   How swiftly life’s ensuing hours\r\n      Lose one by one their golden gleams.\r\n   How fondly Hope’s delusive dreams\r\n      The hearts of men with smiles enslave,\r\n   How those forlorn and weary here,\r\n      May learn to look beyond the grave.\r\n\r\n   And Fancy often wanders back,\r\n      Through Time on her enchanted wings,\r\n   To snatch one legend from the gloom\r\n      That age about thy ruin flings.\r\n   And thus Imagination sings\r\n      In fond conceit and varied lay,\r\n   With all a Poet’s trembling pride,\r\n      “A tale of Broomholme’s Abbey grey.”\r\n\r\n   The northern blast is sighing now,\r\n   In every withered leafless bough,\r\n      The dirge of the departed year;\r\n   And the lone sea-bird’s dismal wail,\r\n   That ever comes in storm and gale,\r\n      Foretells the gathering tempest near.\r\n\r\n   The gloom of night is deepening fast,\r\n   And on the wild and fitful blast\r\n      The stormy clouds like shadows fly;\r\n   And darkened by their rapid flight,\r\n   The pale and placid orb of night\r\n      Is shrouded from the seaman’s eye.\r\n\r\n   The vivid lightning’s transient flash,\r\n   And then the deafening thunder crash,\r\n      Proclaims the elemental war;\r\n   And when the lightning leaves the skies,\r\n   And when the rolling thunder dies,\r\n      Hark, how the raging waters roar.\r\n\r\n   The wild waves that in wanton play\r\n   Fling to the winds their feather’d spray,\r\n      But seem to mock the angry sky;\r\n   But seem to sport in maddening pride,\r\n   When all is dread and dark beside,\r\n      And ghastly Death is hovering nigh.\r\n\r\n                                 * * * * * *\r\n\r\n   Morn: oh! how many anxious eyes\r\n   Have watched the live-long night for thee,\r\n   That from the threshold of the skies,\r\n   Now looks o’er a tempestuous sea;\r\n   The ocean that so softly bright\r\n   Hath mirror’d oft the Queen of Night,\r\n   In lustrous lines of liquid light,\r\n   And, oh! hath looked so calm and fair,\r\n   As if no storm could gather there.\r\n   Like to those living lights that shine\r\n   So pure and placid from the eyes,\r\n   When at Religion’s holy shrine\r\n   The humble soul in rapture lies,\r\n   And gloomy passions wake within,\r\n   That lead away the heart to sin;\r\n   Then all that looked so fair and bright,\r\n   So pure in its own sportive glee,\r\n   Becomes a torture and a blight,\r\n   And wilder than the raging sea.\r\n\r\n   The gale now slowly dies away,\r\n   With the approach of dawning day,\r\n   And every wave that chafes the shore,\r\n   Salutes the strand with sullen roar,\r\n   And on the beach in sadness flings\r\n   All that to Hope was once so sweet,\r\n   Like trophies which a warrior brings,\r\n   And lays them at his country’s feet.\r\n   Records that blood and death had earned,\r\n   When mercy from her shrine was spurned.\r\n   Alas! when angry storms break forth,\r\n   And wake the waters into wrath;\r\n   Ah! then the treacherous heaving wave\r\n   Rolls over many a wanderer’s grave,\r\n   And striving winds and foaming surge\r\n   Sing many a mournful funeral dirge.\r\n\r\n                                 * * * * * *\r\n\r\n   Oh, Heaven! that such a lovely form\r\n   Could brave so dread and fierce a storm,\r\n   That one so beautiful and frail\r\n   Could bide the harsh and bitter gale;\r\n   And she who angels might have kept\r\n   In hallowed watches while she slept,\r\n   Is pillowed on the sandy shore,\r\n   Her lullaby the waters’ roar:\r\n   And frowning skies in sorrow spread\r\n   Their canopy around her head.\r\n\r\n   And now beside the maiden kneels\r\n   A messenger of fond relief,\r\n   One who with sweet religion heals\r\n   The wounded spirit’s cankering grief;\r\n   And raises from the chilly sand\r\n   The form that cold and lifeless lay,\r\n   Sustains it with a trembling hand,\r\n   And wraps it in his mantle grey.\r\n   And from that frontlet wipes away\r\n   The wanton water’s brackish spray.\r\n   And now her wild and anxious gaze\r\n   Is fixed upon his swarthy cheek,\r\n   And faint and feebly she essays\r\n   Her wonder and despair to speak;\r\n   And he who looked so calm before,\r\n   Is moved to tears of sorrow now,\r\n   That as he bends the maiden o’er,\r\n   Those drops of pity damp her brow.\r\n   He turns as though ashamed to own\r\n   His heart has soft and yielding grown.\r\n   And now is many an offer made\r\n   Of home and hospitable aid,\r\n   By those who throng around the maid,\r\n   To them the monk his charge commends,\r\n   With promises of bounteous pay,\r\n   And with a heart of trouble wends\r\n   His steps to Broomholme Abbey “grey.”\r\n\r\n                                 * * * * * *\r\n\r\n   What charm is there in Nature’s smile,\r\n   When Hope be dead the weary while,\r\n   Or what in all the world can please,\r\n   When aching hearts are ill at ease.\r\n   And, oh! what rapture could _he_ feel,\r\n   Who left the fair and beaten track\r\n   Of sweet Religion’s holy zeal,\r\n   And to the cold world wandered back;\r\n   Whose only oriflamme should be\r\n   The sanguine cross of Calvary.\r\n   Yes, he whose life had aye been spent\r\n   In self denial’s lowly creed,\r\n   In turning sinners to repent,\r\n   And share the Abbey’s thrifty meed.\r\n   Yes, he who taught that heavenly love\r\n   Should all absorb the anxious mind,\r\n   That hearts should look to hopes above,\r\n   And leave the thoughtless world behind:\r\n   Yes, he whose years though few had been,\r\n   In much of deep devotion past,\r\n   Who joy’d the smiling summer scene,\r\n   And braved the winter’s bitter blast;\r\n   Yes, he who told how dear and sweet\r\n   Was holy influence to the mind,\r\n   Who walked the world with weary feet,\r\n   To succour helpless human kind;\r\n   Yes, he forgot for beauty’s smile,\r\n   His oath to Heaven, his hopes above,\r\n   He gave his heart to pleasures wile,\r\n   And lost his soul for woman’s love.\r\n   Yes, he forgot the lowly mien,\r\n   The holy mass, the rosary,\r\n   And all that he had ever been,\r\n   For hopeless love and misery.\r\n\r\n   Alas! that grief should ever wear\r\n   So pale a cheek with sorrow’s tear,\r\n   That anguish and remorse should trace\r\n   Their furrowed lines on Beauty’s face,\r\n   And early troubles lead the way\r\n   For dread disease and slow decay.\r\n   There is a canker of the breast\r\n   That pleasure cannot charm away,\r\n   When the young heart becomes a prey\r\n   To dread disquiet, and un-rest.\r\n   Day after day—day after day,\r\n   Along that smooth and sandy shore,\r\n   Did Herbert with fair Edith stray,\r\n   Oft listening to the angry roar\r\n   Of the wild ocean’s troubled sound,\r\n   Till the fair earth had wandered round\r\n   The presence of the glorious sun;\r\n   And when the winter had begun\r\n   To shackle every limpid river,\r\n   And silence every gurgling rill,\r\n   And in the woodland on the hill\r\n   The aspen leaves had ceased to quiver,\r\n   And every minstrel in the wood\r\n   Was silent in its solitude,\r\n   Those lovely birds that gaily chanted\r\n   Their songs of gladness from the grove;\r\n   Ah! oft had Edith’s bosom panted\r\n   With silent and supreme delight,\r\n   When they have woke the lovely night\r\n   With their melodious songs of love.\r\n   Ah! many and many a lovely eve,\r\n   Beneath the Heaven’s bespangled roof,\r\n   Did her young heart delight to weave\r\n   The future like a fairy woof:\r\n   And with her Herbert by her side,\r\n   In the sweet hush of eventide,\r\n   When night-blown flowers of beauty rare\r\n   With perfume filled the stilly air;\r\n   Often in those delightful hours,\r\n   When the young dreamy heart of youth\r\n   Plucks many a wreath from Fancy’s bowers,\r\n   And knits them on the brow of truth.\r\n   And once she said, with tearful eye,\r\n   With quivering lip, yet tender tone,\r\n   As if her weak and trembling heart\r\n   Were half afraid its fears to own—\r\n   “Herbert forgive, I know thou wilt,\r\n   Or else my heart the wish would rue,\r\n   Ah! if it bears the taint of guilt,\r\n   In mercy, Heaven, absolve me too.\r\n   When death with chilling hand shall sever\r\n   The souls that nought but death could part,\r\n   Herbert, a slow consuming fever\r\n   Is burning at my brain and heart:\r\n   I feel that death is calmly stealing\r\n   Over my senses, day by day,\r\n   Immortal longings and a feeling\r\n   Of rapture charms my pulse away.\r\n   Herbert, dear Herbert, my request,\r\n   My last sad dying wish would be,\r\n   That in the last embrace of death,\r\n   My rest may then be near to thee;\r\n   And by the willows that o’ershade\r\n   The streamlet on the woodland hill,\r\n   Our dust may be in sadness laid,\r\n   And, though in death, together still.”\r\n   Down Herbert’s cheeks the drops of woe\r\n   Coursed sad and slowly—whilst the maid\r\n   Her last and earnest wishes prayed.\r\n   It was a dread and bitter throe—\r\n   Such as fond hearts, when doomed to sever,\r\n   At once unheeded and for ever,\r\n   Pure ardent souls alone could know.\r\n   He clasped her to his aching heart—\r\n   Her brow, alas! how pale and chill;\r\n   An icy glaze is o’er her eye,\r\n   And yet her lips are quivering still.\r\n   Ah! what is all the world to him?\r\n   A sleepless night, a cheerless day,\r\n   Now those endearing eyes are dim,\r\n   And his twin spirit passed away.\r\n   Now what to him is hill or dale,\r\n   The summer’s sun or winter’s gale?\r\n   Alas! they only tell a tale\r\n   That wakes a sorrow in his breast,\r\n   Whispering o’er and o’er again,\r\n   That he _was_ blest, supremely blest.\r\n   Autumn or winter, summer or spring,\r\n   What are they now to him?\r\n   He walks the earth like a withered thing,\r\n   Whose lamp of life is dim.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n   The keenest pangs of mortal woes,\r\n   And Sorrow’s agonizing throes,\r\n   The briny drops of Misery\r\n   That overflow the mourning eye,\r\n   When Hope has lost its faintest gleam,\r\n   Will make the sweetest Eden seem\r\n   A barren and unkindly waste.\r\n   Alas! how bitter to the taste\r\n   Is that dark cup Remembrance fills\r\n   With all the worst of human ills,\r\n   And crowns with pleasures past away.\r\n   As waters silently decay\r\n   The flinty rocks they hourly fret,\r\n   So does the wildness of Despair,\r\n   And the slow canker of Regret,\r\n   The weary human bosom wear.\r\n\r\n   In Broomholme’s cloistered turret now\r\n   Herbert de Colville lowly lies,\r\n   And withered is his burning brow,\r\n   And haggard are his frenzied eyes;\r\n   Those wandering orbs whose meteor light\r\n   Shines wildly from their mortal spheres,\r\n   When Fever like a deadly blight,\r\n   The wavering sense with madness sears;\r\n   It fills the eye and rends the heart,\r\n   When Reason’s heavenly rays depart,\r\n   And leave the mind so faint and dim.\r\n   That it had ever been to him,\r\n   To leave the Abbey’s holy wall,\r\n   And from that sweet Religion fall,\r\n   That should have been his hope—his all,\r\n   When earthly scenes began to pall;\r\n   That he should learn the bitter truth,\r\n   When buoyant hours are all gone by,\r\n   That the wild erring steps of youth\r\n   Must be retraced, when health and prime\r\n   Have left the frame, and when the eye\r\n   Is dim with pain and misery;\r\n   When the lone heart is worn and weak,\r\n   And the untiring hand of Time\r\n   Hath written Manhood on his cheek.\r\n\r\n   And round about him watchful stand\r\n   The Brethren of that holy band,\r\n   Whose pure devoted lives are given\r\n   To work the glorious will of Heaven.\r\n   And their’s is not a bigot’s zeal,\r\n   Whose dear delight is but to heal\r\n   The souls that pant for sweet repose,\r\n   O’erwhelmed with sin and worldly woes,\r\n   To succour in the hour of need\r\n   The hearts that ache and inly bleed,\r\n   Whose crown of glory is the meed,\r\n   That Love upon the soul bestows;\r\n   The sweet rejoicing of the heart,\r\n   That well performs its mortal part;\r\n   And not ingratitude nor slight,\r\n   Nor the world’s cold and biting scorn,\r\n   Contempt and scoffing hourly borne,\r\n   Hath power to dim the holy light\r\n   That Love around her votary flings,\r\n   For she can wrap them in delight,\r\n   And fan them with ambrosial wings,\r\n   When death with calm approaches steep\r\n   Their senses in eternal sleep.\r\n\r\n                                 * * * * * *\r\n\r\n   “Alas!

This is supposed to be one of the oldest brick\r\nmansions in England.  It was erected by Sir John Fastolf, who was born\r\nhere, or at Yarmouth, in 1378.  He entered early in life a brilliant\r\nmilitary career, and signalized himself by many acts of bravery during a\r\nforty years’ campaign under the English Regency in France, and history\r\nrecords, in the course of this period, he was made in the field of battle\r\na Knight Banneret, a Baron of France, Knight of the Garter, Marshal of\r\nthe Regent’s Household, the King’s Lieutenant in Normandy, and\r\nprogressively appointed to various public offices.  He subsequently\r\nreturned to Caistor, and his liberality, munificence, and acts of charity\r\nwere not equalled in the period in which he lived.  He became a founder\r\nof religious and other edifices, a generous patron of learning, an\r\nencourager of piety, and a benefactor to the poor.\r\n\r\nA quibble on the name of this truly great and eminent man has been raised\r\nby some authors, who supposed him to be the Sir John Falstaff, whom our\r\nimmortal bard Shakspeare delineated in the humorous but abandoned\r\ncharacter as constantly lounging about the court of Prince Henry\r\n(afterwards Henry the Vth. of England).—The poetical Falstaff was nearly\r\nthreescore years of age at the battle of Shrewsbury, A.D. 1403, when the\r\nNorfolk hero was not more than twenty-five.  The former ended his career\r\nsoon after Prince Henry ascended the throne—the latter survived Henry the\r\nVth. thirty-seven years, and died at Caistor in 1459.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCromer, formerly a small market town, is situated nine miles N.N.W. of\r\nNorth Walsham, and on the verge of the German Ocean.  At the Doomsday\r\nsurvey Cromer formed part of the lordship and parish of Shipden, a\r\nconsiderable village, which, with its church, dedicated to St. Peter,\r\nappears to have been swallowed up by the sea about the time of Henry the\r\n4th.  A patent to collect certain dues for the erection of a pier was\r\ngranted in the 14th of Richard II.  At neap tides, in calm weather, are\r\nstill to be seen, about half a mile distant from the shore, large masses\r\nof wall, which are supposed to have belonged to the church alluded to.\r\n\r\nMany large portions of land were washed away in 1611, previous to which\r\nthe inhabitants expended considerable sums of money and ingenuity in a\r\nfruitless attempt to maintain a small harbour.  In the winter of 1799,\r\nthe light-house cliffs, projecting from the beach three hundred and\r\ntwenty feet, made several remarkably large shoots, one of which brought\r\nwith it half an acre of ground, and extended into the sea beyond low\r\nwater mark.  On January 15th, 1825, another large mass of earth was\r\ndetached from the light-house hills, and fell with great force on the\r\nbeach, extending in breadth above three hundred yards from the cliffs,\r\ncovering an area of twelve acres, and containing, it was supposed, not\r\nless than half a million of cubic yards of earth.  The fall of this\r\nenormous body was sudden and unexpected.  A large stream of water issued\r\nfrom the bank immediately after its fall, and discharged itself down upon\r\nthe beach with great noise and violence.  Early in the morning of August\r\n19th, 1832, another large shoot of the cliffs occurred near the\r\nlight-house, which threatened the destruction of that useful edifice.  It\r\nwas deemed expedient to erect another on the hill, two hundred and fifty\r\nyards inland; but the remains of the old one are still standing about\r\nthree-quarters of a mile east of the town, where it was built of brick in\r\n1719.\r\n\r\nThese immense landslips were almost entirely owing to the numerous fresh\r\nwater springs abounding in this locality, but the damage the town of\r\nCromer experienced, and referred to in Chapter III., was caused by the\r\nocean, during a continuous gale of wind.\r\n\r\nAccording to tradition, Cromer church, dedicated to St. Peter and St.\r\nPaul, is supposed to have been erected in the reign of Henry 4th, soon\r\nafter the village of Shipden disappeared.  It is a large and handsome\r\nedifice, built of flint and free-stone, in the Gothic style, with a fine\r\ntower 154 feet in height, and richly ornamented with sculpture.  The west\r\nentrance, the north porch, and the chancel have been long in ruins, and\r\nvery little of the latter now remains; and history informs us, that many\r\nof its ornaments were destroyed by Cromwell’s soldiers, who converted it\r\ninto barracks.\r\n\r\nAs a watering place Cromer richly deserves the celebrity it has attained;\r\nand the encomiums conferred by those who have visited it during the\r\nsummer months, are certainly not exaggerated.  Nature indeed, appears to\r\nhave bestowed her favours with no sparing hand to render it a delightful\r\nretreat for the invalid—or those who require a relaxation from the noise\r\nand bustle of a city life—and for those who are desirous to prosecute\r\ntheir studies with ease and comfort, almost amounting to enchantment.\r\nThe most fastidious could but be pleased with the beauty of the\r\nsurrounding scenery—with the accommodation provided by enterprising\r\nindividuals—with the civility and courteous demeanour of its inhabitants,\r\nwho from the highest to the lowest grade, take every possible pains to\r\ndeserve lasting esteem and friendship.  The fishermen too are exceedingly\r\nwell behaved, and their looks pourtray a contentment approaching to\r\nhappiness, that indicates the labour attending their perilous vocation is\r\nrewarded.\r\n\r\nThe village of Shipden, with its church dedicated to St. Peter, which lay\r\nbetween Cromer and the sea, has wholly disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECCLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEccles by the Sea, nine miles east by south of North Walsham, was a\r\nhamlet of the great lordship of Hasborough or Happisburgh, from whence it\r\nis about two miles distant.  It not only appears fast sinking into\r\noblivion itself, but also holds a fearful destiny over a large tract of\r\nvaluable marsh land in the eastern division of the county, by reason of\r\nthe inlet it may sooner or later afford to an irruption of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward the Confessor it was held by Edric, a Dane of\r\nnoble extraction, afterwards by Ralph, Earl of Norfolk, through whom it\r\nbecame forfeited to the Crown.  William the Conqueror bestowed it upon\r\nRoger Bigot, whence it passed successively into the hands of William de\r\nAlbini, ancestor of the Earls of Arundale, William le Parker, and several\r\nother noblemen of renown in the annals of chivalry.\r\n\r\nMany curious privileges and customs the lords of the manor derived in\r\nthose days—for we find in 33rd of Edward the 1st, 1305, William le Parker\r\nwas entituled to receive wreck of sea, lagan, and resting geld, customs,\r\nand other profits upon the sea and land, and of every crew of a ship or\r\nboat washing their nets in the said village after Michaelmas to\r\nMartlemas, an hundred herrings, and also a fee for goods, chattels, &c.,\r\ncoming to land by sea, without the help of the said William or his\r\nservant, or resting upon the land one day and one night; and if the said\r\nWilliam or his men, &c., immediately after imminent danger, or after\r\nshipwreck, shall do their endeavour to save such things, then the said\r\nWilliam shall have a third part of all such things, or the value of them,\r\nunless of his good will he will omit something, but must not be\r\nasked.—Among the land customs was the bed gild, and at every wedding,\r\nnoble or ignoble, the lords of the manor had the privilege of\r\nconsummating the nuptials of the bride, or receiving a fee instead.  This\r\nindecorous system prevailed in some parts of Scotland not many years\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nThese arbitrary laws, enacted in the earlier period of England’s history,\r\nwhen ignorance prevailed, and barbarism allowed the honoured and the\r\nwealthy to impose exactions cruel and oppressive, on those beneath them,\r\nmay possibly have in many instances, from humanity, been omitted.  At all\r\nevents, as knowledge advanced, we find that not only have those which\r\npressed so heavily upon the poor industrious fishermen been cancelled,\r\nbut that others have been reduced to an extent compatible with the\r\nnecessary protection to property exposed to the pilferer, from lamentable\r\naccidents on the coast.  And it is highly gratifying to observe, that\r\nuntil recently no murmur or complaint has been raised against the lords\r\nof the manor, and this is confined to two or three districts, and arose\r\nfrom the following circumstance:—From time immemorial, it appears,\r\npersons have been allowed to take whatever sea-beach materials they\r\nrequired for domestic or other purposes, without molestation or the\r\nexaction of any fee.  But the increasing demand induced individuals who\r\nwere deputed by the lords of the manor to officiate in their stead, to\r\napply for permission to charge so much per freight or load; which being\r\ngranted, a pretty income has been realized from the hundreds of loads of\r\nsand, stones, &c., removed annually.—A curious coincidence, however, is\r\nconnected with it.  One of these deputy lords, a few years since,\r\nobserved that the removal of sea-beach materials, within a given distance\r\nof the road or gangway to the beach, afforded an inlet for the ocean to\r\nunder mine and remove the foot of the gangway to such an extent, that an\r\nexpence was necessarily incurred, from time to time, in repairing it,\r\nbesides the loss of land on either side of it.  He therefore applied for\r\npermission to fix up a board in the vicinity, on which was printed—\r\n\r\n                        “By order of the Magistrates.\r\n\r\n    “Notice is hereby given—Should any person or persons take away or\r\n    remove any sand near the gangway and foot of the cliffs, he or they\r\n    shall be prosecuted, and upon conviction, shall suffer the extreme\r\n    penalty of the law.”\r\n\r\nBut strange to relate, no sooner did the deputy lord receive permission\r\nto dispose of the sea-beach materials, than the board was taken down, and\r\nindividuals are permitted to take them away, if not in the immediate\r\nvicinity of the gangway, at least at the foot or base of the cliffs.\r\n\r\nEvery remaining vestige of Eccles denotes antiquity.  Ancient stone walls\r\nhave been exposed within the last three years by the action of the sea,\r\nremoving lofty sand hills, and the peasantry have picked up silver and\r\ncopper coins of great antiquity.  But a still stronger evidence of a\r\nremote period may be traced in the wells constructed with large unburned\r\nbricks, formed in a mould wider at one end than at the other, to adapt\r\nthem to the true circumference of the well itself.  It is quite clear the\r\nwells had been filled up with earth, and ceased to be used before the\r\nabandonment of the place, since near to every one of them is a stone\r\nwell, built with mortar, similar to the churches, which possibly denotes\r\nthe first step towards civilization in this country.  It formerly\r\ncontained two thousand acres of land, but so wasted by the incursion of\r\nthe German Ocean, that the inhabitants, in their petition for a reduction\r\nof taxes, in the reign of James the 1st, complained they had then only\r\nfourteen houses and three hundred acres of land.  The whole now comprises\r\na few cottages, with the church tower, and one hundred and fifty acres of\r\nland.  The church was dedicated to St. Mary.\r\n\r\nHistory informs us, that the parish of Whimpnell, formerly situated\r\nbetween Hasborough and Eccles, has been entirely removed by the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHASBOROUGH.\r\n\r\n\r\nHasborough, denominated also Happisburgh, situated seven miles south-east\r\nof North Walsham, is a considerable village, containing a church\r\ndedicated to St. Mary.  Its steeple, 110½ feet in height, stands on an\r\nelevated point of land, and is extremely useful to the mariner as a\r\nland-mark.  In former days a large wooden cross presented itself a\r\nconsiderable height above and from the centre of the steeple, which\r\nrendered it still more conspicuous, and prior to 1818 it became so\r\ndecayed, that it was blown down.  The inhabitants erected another in its\r\nstead, which, during a heavy tempest in 1822, unfortunately served as a\r\nconductor for the electric fluid, which demolished it, and also a large\r\nportion of the south-east buttress; the latter fell upon and passed\r\nthrough the roof of the church, on to the aile beneath.  On this occasion\r\nthe electric fluid set fire to the church, and had not the promptest\r\nmeasures been resorted to, it must have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nHere also was erected, in 1791, two light-houses, the one a hundred and\r\nthe other eighty feet high.  The upper part of each terminates in a dome;\r\nimmediately beneath is the lantern, and on the outside a platform,\r\nsurrounded with iron palisading, whose verge consists of a flat piece of\r\nthe same material.  Some years since, an unfortunate individual, subject\r\nto mental aberration, while in an extremely excited state, walked on the\r\ntop or rim of the palisading, round one of the lights.  This feat he\r\nsafely accomplished, and extraordinary to relate, it had the desirable\r\neffect to render him calm and collected for several years.\r\n\r\nA lover of the picturesque would be amply repaid for the trouble taken to\r\nreach the platform, which, as before observed, describes a circle, the\r\none half presenting, on a clear day, a beautiful marine view, the other a\r\nsplendid landscape.\r\n\r\nIn the former, the ocean, as far as the eye can reach, exhibits a vast\r\nexpanse of troubled water, imparting sound which murmurs discontent.  Its\r\nbosom too, after northerly and north-easterly winds, is frequently\r\nbedecked with vessels bound to some distant port, and from their being so\r\nnumerous, so variable in size and form, and gliding so near the shore,\r\nthey produce a beautiful panorama, not surpassed on any other part of the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nFrom the latter is seen in the distance, the spire of Norwich Cathedral,\r\nCromer and Winterton light-houses.  The intermediate space presenting\r\npretty scenery of hill and dale, with here and there a mansion surrounded\r\nwith plantations.  The spires of the village churches too are numerous\r\nand conspicuous, and the ruins of antiquated buildings, especially the\r\nPriory of Broomholme, at Bacton, is a picture in itself inviting our\r\nthoughts to roam to by-gone times.—The lands divided with fences, neat\r\nand trim, and the fields, exhibit, during the summer months, the various\r\ncolours of the ripening corn.  Farm-houses located at uncertain\r\ndistances, and the humble cottages of the industrious poor, present at\r\nonce a _coup-d’œil_ of the blessings conferred on industry and\r\nenterprize.\r\n\r\nTo the Geologist and the Antiquarian a fine field for research, and a\r\nglorious treat, is afforded them.  Within a short distance to the\r\nnorthward are lofty cliffs, containing in the different strata, relics of\r\nanimals; some similar to those in the present day; others that never\r\nexisted in the memory of the oldest historian; and those which now exist\r\nonly in the torrid zone.  The shells of fish that only inhabit rivers\r\nwhose waters have departed to other channels, whose beds have been\r\ncovered up probably for ages, while the trunks of trees, and stumps, with\r\ntheir strong roots extended, are frequently exposed after strong gales of\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nTo the southward is old Eccles steeple, ready to be snatched into the\r\nbriny ocean; at its foot, towards the sea, is the remaining portion of\r\nthe sacred edifice, with other foundations, indicating where once had\r\nexisted the humming noise of human beings, exercising their vocation for\r\nindividual and collective benefit.  On either side of the old steeple are\r\ncapacious banks, where the marram grows spontaneously, whose long tufts\r\nconceal the wily rabbit and the timid hare.  Here the weary may rest; the\r\ncontemplative picture to himself scenes that are past, present, and to\r\ncome.  Here pic-nic parties, merry meetings, the young and old, may\r\npartake of a delightful recreation, which a wonderful yet beautiful world\r\npresents; containing the fountain from whence all Philosophy springs and\r\nends, and embracing the evidence of an Infinite Being, in the grandeur\r\nand magnificence of Creation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHorsey next the Sea must have been formerly one of the most uninviting\r\nhamlets ever beheld.  It lies between Waxham and Winterton, and is eleven\r\nmiles north by west of Yarmouth.  Its lonely situation, its containing a\r\nlarge lake, called Horsey mere, and intersected with ditches of stagnant\r\nwater, cannot render it even now prepossessing.  And were it not for its\r\ncomplete exposure to wind from every quarter, it probably would be very\r\nunhealthy.—Such a singular aspect did it assume some years since, that an\r\nearly historian, alluding to Horsey, recommended it to the notice of\r\ngovernment, as being peculiarly adapted for prisoners of war, especially\r\nthe French; observing they could be retained there readily, as there was\r\nonly one road to it; and its growing roots in abundance, besides an\r\ninnumerable quantity of frogs, the expense for maintaining them would be\r\ninconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe present proprietor’s highly respected ancestor, about fifty years\r\nsince, purchased the manor, when it was of little value, being generally\r\nflooded, and having expended a considerable sum of money in draining the\r\nmarshes, repairing the sea-bank, and making a road to Somerton, an\r\nadjoining village leading to Yarmouth, has rendered it one of the most\r\nfertile estates in the county.\r\n\r\nOn the sea-bank within the bounds of this parish is Little Waxham, a\r\nmanor of 160 acres; but the village, and its church dedicated to St.\r\nMargaret, were swept away by the ocean many years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKESWIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeswic or Casewic, situated to the east of Bacton, appears to have been\r\npart of the manor, and extended to this place and Broomholme.  In 1382,\r\nthe church, dedicated to St. Clement, was standing, and when it became\r\ndeserted cannot be determined.\r\n\r\nExtensive ruins remained for several years, which were taken down on the\r\nday of the coronation of George the Third and Queen Charlotte, with the\r\nexception of a small portion, now forming walls to two or three cottages.\r\n\r\nA considerable part of the village is now in the sea from the falling of\r\nthe cliffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUNDESLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMundesley is a pleasant village, situated about five miles north by east\r\nof North Walsham, and has considerably improved during the last few\r\nyears, but, similarly to Bacton, to which it is annexed, is continually\r\nwasting by the sea.  A villa erected by F. Wheatley, Esq., commands a\r\nbeautiful marine view, but to preserve it from the rapacity of the ocean,\r\nupwards of three thousand pounds have been expended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nPalling next the Sea lies between Eccles and Waxham, and is about twenty\r\nmiles north-east of Norwich.  It is celebrated in ancient records as\r\nbeing the residence of Godwin, Earl of Kent, in the reign of Edward the\r\nConfessor.  William the Conqueror afterwards seized on it, and at the\r\ngrand survey, Godric was bailiff or steward of it for that king.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few months, the sea has removed the beach at low water\r\nmark, and exposed the strata beneath its surface.  In it are the remains\r\nof the trunks and roots of trees; the former broken off from three to\r\nfour feet above the strata, while around lie the remaining portions\r\nconsisting of the branches, leaves, &c., but very much compressed.  The\r\nbark of the beech is very distinct, but the oak, and especially the red\r\nfir, are in the best state of preservation.  The wood of the latter has\r\nevidently undergone considerable chemical change, for the ligneous or\r\nfibrous part is very perfect, but its resinous properties are absent,\r\nconsequently the wood when dried, is much lighter, and smells strongly of\r\nsulphur.  It is impossible to ascertain how long the trees have been\r\ncovered up, but probably some centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIMINGHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrimingham is situated on the tall cliffs between Mundesley and Cromer,\r\nand five miles north by east of North Walsham.  Like the former, it has\r\nbeen subject to the encroachments of the ocean for a series of years, and\r\nis now reduced to a small village.  The church stands on the highest\r\npoint of the cliffs; and history relates that its ancient priests\r\nprofessed to have the head of St. John the Baptist.  Pilgrims came a long\r\ndistance with great offerings, and thus became the dupes of superstition\r\nand deceit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAXHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaxham lies on the coast between Palling and Horsey, and is about\r\nfourteen miles north-west of Yarmouth.  This parish was formerly much\r\nmore extensive, and although it has not been encroached upon for some\r\nyears, yet the sand hills appear evidently inclined to recede.\r\n\r\nThe church, dedicated to St. John, exhibits considerable dilapidation,\r\nthe chancel end being quite in ruins.  In the church-yard lies interred\r\nthe remains of the unfortunate mate of the Hunter cutter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWells next the sea is situated five miles north by west of Walsingham,\r\nand 32 miles north-west of Norwich.  It possesses a tolerably good\r\nharbour and several neat buildings, but its streets are very irregular.\r\nThe church, dedicated to St. Nicholas, is a neat edifice, with a square\r\ntower.  On July 15th, 1817, a gale of wind from the north produced so\r\nhigh a tide, that the marshes near Wells became inundated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTERTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWinterton is an ancient village, annexed to Horsey on the south, and\r\nwithin eight miles north by west of Yarmouth.  It is sheltered on the\r\nnorth-east by a bold promontory called Winterton-Ness, and well known to\r\nthe mariner as the most fatal headland between Scotland and London.  The\r\nchurch, dedicated to the Holy Trinity and All Saints, possesses a fine\r\ntower, 118 feet in height, which commands an extensive view of the ocean.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of December, 1665, a tremendous high tide caused such\r\nalarming breaches in the sand hills at Winterton, Horsey, and Waxham, as\r\nto threaten destruction to all the valuable marsh land from thence to\r\nYarmouth, Beccles, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYARMOUTH,\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequently termed Great Yarmouth, is the principal sea-port town in\r\nNorfolk, and 123 miles distant N.E. of London.  It stands on the east\r\nbank of the river Yare (from whence it takes its name), at its confluence\r\nwith the Bure, about two miles from the mouth of the haven, which is very\r\nextensive and commodious.—From the appearance of the country, and an\r\nancient chart, supposed to have been drawn about A.D. 1000, it is evident\r\nthat a broad and extensive estuary divided this part of the eastern\r\ncoast, not only in the time of its most ancient inhabitants, but for a\r\nlong period after the Saxon Conquest, extending its waters westward to\r\nthe city of Norwich, northward to Caistor, Reedham, Herringby, and\r\nStrumpshaw, and southward to Gorleston, Burgh, Bungay, Harleston, and\r\nHaddiscoe.  This large arm of the ocean forming the grand receptacle of\r\nall the eastern waters of Norfolk (as it still continues under the\r\ncircumscribed form of the Yare), began to disappear after the fifth\r\ncentury, when the sand collecting at its entrance, was, by the action of\r\nthe waters, gradually formed into an island, which ultimately extended\r\nitself to the main land, and became the peninsula on which Yarmouth is\r\nfounded.  Several successive disappointments, and an immense outlay of\r\ncapital in endeavouring to erect substantial havens for the guidance of\r\nthe river waters into the sea, had been experienced, and at length\r\nfinally accomplished by the erection of those beautiful piers and noble\r\njetty.  In 1528 the work was commenced, and on the 2nd day of March,\r\n1559, men, women, and children, to the number of one thousand, were\r\nemployed, and succeeded, in the short space of two days, in causing the\r\nwater to issue forth into the sea, leaving a depth of ten feet at ebb\r\ntide.  In 1567, the water forced a passage down the old channel, towards\r\nthe village of Corton.  After this disaster, a celebrated Dutch engineer\r\nwas employed, who commenced his operations by driving and hedging down\r\nlarge stakes and piles, to make a firm substantial foundation; this was\r\nfirst done on the north and afterwards on the south side of the entrance,\r\nfor the purpose of forcing the ebbing of the tide to run out by a\r\nnorth-east channel.  The next step was the erecting of piers for\r\npreventing the haven from overflowing, and preserving, at all times of\r\nthe tide, a sufficient depth of water for ships to float at their\r\nmoorings.  The jurisdiction of the haven includes that part of the sea\r\ncalled Yarmouth roads, extending northward to Scratby, and southward to\r\nCorton, in Suffolk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINUNDATIONS, SHIPWRECKS, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1287, St. Nicholas’ Church was completely inundated by the sea, during\r\na tremendous flood, that did incredible damage to the town, the greater\r\npart of which was under water.\r\n\r\nIn 1554, fifty sail of vessels was lost in one day and night, and the\r\ncrews perished.\r\n\r\nIn 1692, a fleet of two hundred sail of colliers, having left the roads\r\nwith a fair wind, were suddenly assailed by a tremendous gale from the\r\nnorth-east.  After they had passed Winterton-ness, some of them tacked\r\nand arrived back safe in the roads; the remainder pushed out to sea, but\r\nwere unable, through its violence, to clear the Ness to the southward.\r\nThe night was exceedingly dark, and missing the lights, few could find\r\ntheir way; some rode out at a distance; but the rest, amounting to one\r\nhundred and forty sail, were driven ashore, completely wrecked, and\r\nscarcely any of the crews saved.  At the same unfortunate juncture, a\r\nnumber of coasting vessels, laden with grain, bound to Holland, from Lynn\r\nand Wells, having just left the roads, experienced the same disaster; so\r\nthat in the whole more than two hundred vessels and one thousand people\r\nwere lost in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nIf vessels leaving Flamborough Head, proceed southward, and meet with a\r\nheavy gale from any point between north-east and south-east; or if\r\nleaving the Yarmouth roads, proceeding to the northward, they are\r\nretarded by the wind blowing hard from the north-east, so that they\r\ncannot weather Winterton-ness, they become embayed, and the only chance\r\nfor safety is to run for the Lynn Deeps, in attempting which they are in\r\ndanger of foundering on the rocks near Cromer, or stranding on the flat\r\nshores between Cromer and Wells.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, seventy sail of ships met with a similar fate, and also their\r\ncrews.\r\n\r\nIn 1791, a raging tide inundated the denes and the meadows to such a\r\ndepth, that boats rowed on Southtown turnpike.\r\n\r\nIn 1805, a tremendous storm at sea occurred, accompanied by a raging\r\ntide, which nearly destroyed the old jetty.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, a destructive tide ensued, which did much damage to the town.\r\nThe water flowed nearly to the doors of some of the houses on the quays.\r\nThe Southtown road was completely overflowed and rendered impassable, the\r\nlower apartments in several houses on the west side were under water, and\r\nmuch corn, grain, and other merchandize in the store-houses spoiled.\r\n\r\nTo do ample justice to the highly interesting records associated with\r\nthis celebrated sea-port town, would form a volume in itself, and the\r\ningenuity and embellishments displayed by its inhabitants, to be properly\r\nappreciated ought to be visited, to form a lasting impression of their\r\nindustry.  Situated on a narrow strip of land, less than a mile in\r\nbreadth, and stretching five miles from north to south, it cannot boast\r\nof any pretty inland scenery, as the country is extremely flat, but it\r\npossesses resources interesting and inviting to the stranger.\r\n\r\nIts harbour is excellently situated for affording shelter for vessels\r\nunable to contend against contrary winds.  Its extensive traffic in coal\r\nand corn, and above all the celebrity it has attained for its herring and\r\nmackerel fisheries, must ever render it a place of the greatest\r\nimportance.  As a watering-place its merits must not be forgotten.\r\nSplendid edifices and admirable accommodation have been provided near the\r\nsea-shore, enabling its visitors to partake of “delightful breezes to\r\ntheir hearts’ content,” or to mingle with the gaieties of a city life.\r\nAs a naval station during the late war, it proved highly advantageous;\r\nand in accordance with that circumstance, a beautiful Monumental Pillar\r\nwas erected on the south Denes, about a mile from the town, to the memory\r\nof the gallant Nelson.  It is of Grecian Doric order, elegantly fluted,\r\nand one hundred and forty-four feet in height, ascended by an easy flight\r\nof steps.  Upon the plinth are the names of the four ships, “Vanguard,\r\nCaptain, Elephant, and Victory,” on board which the heroic Admiral’s flag\r\nwas so valorously displayed; and on the coping of the terrace are\r\ninscribed the names of the four principal battles—“Aboukir, St. Vincent,\r\nCopenhagen, and Trafalgar.”  On each of the four sides of the pedestal is\r\na flight of steps leading to the terrace, which affords a promenade round\r\nthe shaft.  The roof is supported by Caryatides, surrounded by a ball,\r\nand a figure of Britannia, admirably cast, holding in her hand a trident\r\nand a laurel wreath.\r\n\r\nOn the west side is a very elegant Latin inscription, from the pen of a\r\nNorfolk Gentleman, of which the following is a translation:—\r\n\r\n                             HORATIO LORD NELSON,\r\n          Whom, as her first and proudest champion in naval fights,\r\n               Britain honoured, while living, with her favour,\r\n                       and, when lost, with her tears;\r\n              Of whom, signalized by his triumphs in all lands,\r\n                               the whole earth\r\n           stood in awe on account of the tempered firmness of his\r\n              counsels, and the undaunted ardour of his courage;\r\n                                This great man\r\n                                   NORFOLK\r\n       Boasts her own, not only as born there of a respectable family,\r\n              And as there having received his early education,\r\n               But her own also in talents, manners, and mind,\r\n               The glory of so great a name though sure long to\r\n                  Outlive all monuments of brass and stone,\r\n        His fellow-countrymen of Norfolk have resolved to commemorate\r\n            By this column, erected by their joint contributions.\r\n                        He was born in the year 1758;\r\n                      Entered on his Profession in 1771;\r\n      And was concerned in nearly 150 Naval Engagements with the enemy.\r\n               Being Conqueror, among various other occasions,\r\n                          At Aboukir, August, 1798;\r\n                         At Copenhagen, April, 1801;\r\n                       And at Trafalgar, October, 1805:\r\n       Which last Victory, the crown of so many glorious achievements,\r\n         He consecrated by a death, equally mournful to his country,\r\n                          And honourable to himself.\r\n\r\n                                * * * * *\r\n\r\n                                 _FINIS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SUBSCRIBERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable Lord WODEHOUSE, the Lord Lieutenant for the County\r\nof Norfolk.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable Lady WODEHOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Miss WODEHOUSE.\r\n\r\nThe Right Reverend Dr. STANLEY, Lord Bishop of Norwich, President of the\r\nGeological and Linnean Societies.\r\n\r\nThe Most Honourable the Marquis of DOURO, M.P.\r\n\r\nThe Most Honourable the Marquis of CHOLMONDELEY.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable the Earl of STRADBROKE, Lord Lieutenant for the\r\nCounty of Suffolk.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable the Countess of STRADBROKE.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable the Earl of LEICESTER.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable and Reverend Lord BAYNING.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable Lord SONDES.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable Lord WALSINGHAM.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable Lord BERESFORD.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable Lord CHARLES TOWNSHEND.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable Lord STAFFORD.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable Lord SANDON, M.P.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable Lord HENNIKER, M.P.\r\n\r\nThe Right Honourable Lord RENDLESHAM, M.P.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable and Very Reverend GEORGE PELLEW, D.D., Dean of Norwich.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable and Reverend FREDERICK DE GREY.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Captain EDWARD THORNTON WODEHOUSE, R.N.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable W.

Observations in addition to line 20:—Wind blowing from the east\r\nproduces these effects to a greater extent than from the north-east, and\r\nwind blowing from the south-east causes the sand on the sea-shore to be\r\nextremely loose and porous, while the north wind renders the sand firm,\r\nsolid, and compact.\r\n\r\nPage 68, line 18, _read_ two hundred and ten, instead of one hundred and\r\nsixty.\r\n\r\nPage 71, line 15, _read_ from the north-west to the south-east.\r\n\r\nPage 85, line 17, _read_ hath instead of have.\r\n\r\nPlate the second (opposite p. 71, chap. x.), conveys only a slight idea\r\nof the Author’s plan, but illustrates the proposed elevation of the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n{5}  The Author may probably, on a future occasion, communicate all the\r\ncircumstances connected with the above, as they will afford an amusing,\r\ninteresting, and instructive lesson, corroborating the testimony of the\r\nPoet,\r\n\r\n                  “From little causes great effects arise.”\r\n\r\n{11}  See Goldsmith’s History of the Earth and Animated Nature, vol. 1,\r\np. 146.\r\n\r\n{12a}  See Goldsmith’s History of the Earth and Animated Nature, vol. 1,\r\np. 146.\r\n\r\n{12b}  Ibid. p. 149\r\n\r\n{13a}  Vide Goldsmith’s History of the Earth and Animated Nature, vol. 1,\r\np. 149.\r\n\r\n{13b}  Upon this coast the swells continue greater three days after the\r\nnew and full moon than when the latter is in her meridian.\r\n\r\n{14a}  See Carey’s Astronomy, p. 137.\r\n\r\n{14b}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{14c}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{15a} See Carey’s Astronomy, p. 137.\r\n\r\n{15b}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{16a}  See Lyell’s Geology, vol. 2, p. 25.\r\n\r\n{16b}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{16c}  See Goldsmith’s History of the Earth and Animated Nature, vol. 1,\r\np. 150.\r\n\r\n{17}  See Lyell’s Geology, vol. 2, p. 18.\r\n\r\n{19}  Vide Goldsmith’s History of the Earth and Animated Nature, vol. 1,\r\np. 151.\r\n\r\n{23}  See Lyell’s Geology, vol. 2, p. 34.\r\n\r\n{24a}  Treatise on Astronomy.\r\n\r\n{24b}  Lyell’s Geology, vol. 2, p. 36.\r\n\r\n{25}  See Lyell’s Geology, vol. 2, p. 24.\r\n\r\n{26}  Rennell on Currents, p. 58.\r\n\r\n{28}  See Lyell’s Geology, vol. 2, p. 37.\r\n\r\n{29}  See Newton’s Optics, p. 163–167.\r\n\r\n{32}  The tide flows along this coast from north to south, and ebbs\r\nsouth-east, but exhibits great variation in different places; thus in the\r\nLynn Deeps the tide flows south and ebbs north-east.\r\n\r\n{33a}  See Appendix.\r\n\r\n{33b}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{34a}  See Appendix.\r\n\r\n{34b}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{34c}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{34d}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{34e}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{34f}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{34g}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{34h}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{35a}  See Appendix.\r\n\r\n{35b}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{36}  Stevenson on the Bed of the German Ocean or North Sea.—Ed.

Every soul on board\r\nmet with a watery grave; and since that period the Ranger cutter\r\nfoundered in a heavy gale on the outermost bank, and went to pieces,\r\nabout a quarter of a mile to the south-east of the same gap, and every\r\nperson on board experienced a similar fate.\r\n\r\n{50a}  These sand hills are composed of dry sand, bound in a compact mass\r\nby the long creeping roots of the plant called Marram (Arundo Arenaria);\r\nand such is the present set of the tides, that the harbours of Cley,\r\nWells, and other places, are securely defended by these barriers.\r\n\r\n{50b}  See Appendix.\r\n\r\n{50c}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{50d}  Ibid.\r\n\r\n{55}  The knowledge of the different strata composing the cliffs is\r\nderived from an interesting publication by the Rev. C. Green, Minister of\r\nBacton Chapel, entitled the History, Antiquities, and Geology of Bacton,\r\nin Norfolk, published in 1842.  The indefatigable and learned Author\r\nbeing about to publish a work upon the Geology of Norfolk generally, with\r\nan account of the Fossils, Bones, &c., deposited in its different strata,\r\nthe minute details of their stratification has been avoided, as\r\nconsidered unnecessary for this publication.\r\n\r\n{67}  This valuable variety of grass would, the author thinks, become\r\nmore serviceable, if, on attaining its full growth, known by the ears\r\ncontaining the seed being ripe, it were mown down.  The advantage\r\nderivable would cause the blades to spring up much thicker than they now\r\ndo, and the seed being threshed, might be sown in any locality requiring\r\nits presence; and it evidently appears to be the easiest and most certain\r\nmethod to propagate it.\r\n\r\n{70}  It is scarcely necessary to observe, until the legitimate beach is\r\nformed, stones, sand, &c., must not be taken away, and afterwards only\r\nwith discrimination.—See Appendix.  _Eccles._\r\n\r\n{71}  Examples observable at Eccles, the cliffs opposite the lower\r\nLighthouse at Hasborough, off the high lands Hasborough, Ostend Point,\r\nWalcot, a point off a remnant of the parish of Keswick, off the\r\nWatch-house, Bacton, Cox’s Point, Mundsley, Trimingham, Cromer, &c., in\r\nsome instances scarcely ever any sea-beach materials accumulate, and the\r\nwater reaches the cliffs at half-tide, especially upon the springs.\r\n\r\n{74}  Loudon, in his Encyclopædia of gardening, informs us, the Pinus\r\nSylvestris, commonly but erroneously termed Scotch fir, can be obtained\r\nmuch cheaper, and of a better quality, in Scotland than in England.  It\r\nappears the soil is more congenial, particularly in some districts, where\r\nthe wood equals in texture that grown in America.\r\n\r\n{109}  In this eBook the errata have been applied.—DP.",
