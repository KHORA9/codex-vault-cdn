It is a medley of\r\nmechanics, millionaires, kings, inventors and farmers; and it is intended\r\nfor the average man and woman, boy and girl. Although I have taken great\r\npains to make this book accurate, I have written it in the fashion of\r\nromance, because it tells a story that every American ought to know.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the United States owes much more to the Reaper than it\r\nowes to the factory or the railroad or the Wall Street Stock Exchange.\r\nWithout the magical grain machinery that gives us cheap bread, the whole\r\nnew structure of our civilisation, with all its dazzling luxuries and\r\nrefinements, would be withered by the blight of Famine. This may sound\r\nstrange and sensational to those who have been bred in the cities, but it\r\nis true.\r\n\r\nThe reaper has done more to chase the wolf from the door--to abolish\r\npoverty and drudgery and hand-labour, than any other invention of our day.\r\nIt has done good without any backwash of evil. It has not developed any\r\nnew species of social parasite, as so many modern improvements have done.\r\nIt has not added one dollar to the unclean hoard of a stock-gambler, nor\r\nturned loose upon the public a single idle millionaire.\r\n\r\nThe reaper is our best guarantee of prosperity. In spite of our periodical\r\npanics, which prove, by the way, that the men who provide us with banks\r\nare not as efficient as the men who provide us with bread, we are certain\r\nto rebound into prosperity and social progress as long as we continue to\r\nmake three hundred harvesting machines every working day--one every two\r\nminutes. The rising flood of wheat is bound to submerge the schemers and\r\nthe pessimists alike.\r\n\r\nAnd it is the reaper, too, which has done most to make possible a nobler\r\nhuman race, by lessening the power of that ancient motive--the Search for\r\nFood. Every harvester that clicks its way through the yellow grain means\r\nmore than bread. It means more comfort, more travel, more art and music,\r\nmore books and education. In this large fact lies the real Romance of the\r\nReaper.\r\n\r\nIn gathering the material for this book I have been greatly assisted by\r\nMessrs. E. J. Baker, of the _Farm Implement News_; B. B. Clarke, of the\r\n_American Thresherman_; Ralph Emerson, of Rockford, Ill; C. W. Marsh, of\r\nDe Kalb, Ill.; Edwin D. Metcalf and T. M. Osborne, of Auburn, N. Y., Henry\r\nWallace, of _Wallace's Farmer_, William N. Whiteley, of Springfield, Ohio;\r\nand the officials of the International Harvester Company, who made it\r\npossible for me to have free access to all of its works and to familiarise\r\nmyself with its manner of doing business in this country and abroad.\r\n\r\nAlso, I take pleasure in reproducing the following editorial note from\r\n_Everybody's Magazine_, in which four chapters of this book were first\r\nprinted:\r\n\r\n     \"President Roosevelt in his message of December 3rd said: 'Modern\r\n     industrial conditions are such that combination is not only\r\n     necessary, but inevitable.... Corporation and labour union alike have\r\n     come to stay. Each, if properly managed, is a source of good, and not\r\n     evil.' If capital combinations can be good, there must be some that\r\n     are good. Would it not be a proper service to the American people to\r\n     tell them of a trust that, while it had reaped the economical\r\n     advantages of combination, had yet played fair with the public and\r\n     with its competitors? Hence this story of the great Harvester\r\n     combine. Before we began to publish Mr. Casson's articles, we\r\n     followed up his investigations with a thorough inquiry of our own,\r\n     and we are bound to say that the business methods of this institution\r\n     seem to conform to the highest standards of fair play and square\r\n     dealing. The International Harvester combine is not a tariff trust.\r\n     Its members surrendered dominance in their own business only when the\r\n     trend of 'modern industrial conditions' and overstrenuous competition\r\n     made combination 'not only necessary, but inevitable.' The inside\r\n     history of the 'Morganising' of this group of fighters, as narrated\r\n     here, is as humorous as it is fascinating.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        PAGE\r\n\r\n  Preface                                                vii\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER\r\n\r\n    I.

To-day, on\r\nthe new American plan--riding on the painted chariot of a self-binding\r\nharvester, the price of wheat has been cut down to _ten minutes a bushel_.\r\n\r\n\"When I first went into the harvest field,\" so an Illinois farmer told me,\r\n\"it took ten men to cut and bind my grain. Now our hired girl gets on the\r\nseat of a self-binder and does the whole business.\"\r\n\r\nThis magical machinery of the wheat-field solves the mystery of\r\nprosperity. It explains the New Farmer and the miracles of scientific\r\nagriculture. It accounts for the growth of great cities with their steel\r\nmills and factories. And it makes clear how we in the United States have\r\nbecome the best fed nation in the world.\r\n\r\nHard as it may be for this twentieth century generation to believe, it is\r\ntrue that until recently the main object of all nations was to get bread.\r\nLife was a Search for Food--a desperate postponement of famine.\r\n\r\nCut the Kings and their retinues out of history and it is no exaggeration\r\nto say that the human race was hungry for ten thousand years. Even of the\r\nBlack Bread--burnt and dirty and coarse, there was not enough; and the few\r\nwho were well fed took the food from the mouths of slaves. Even the\r\nnations that grew Galileo and Laplace and Newton were haunted by the\r\nghosts of Hunger. Merrie England was famine-swept in 1315, 1321, 1369,\r\n1438, 1482, 1527, 1630, 1661, and 1709. To have enough to eat, was to the\r\nmasses of all nations a dream--a Millennium of Prosperity.\r\n\r\nThis long Age of Hunger outlived the great nations of antiquity. Why?\r\nBecause they went at the problem of progress in the wrong way.\r\n\r\nIf Marcus Aurelius had invented the reaper, or if the Gracchi had been\r\ninventors instead of politicians, the story of Rome would have had a\r\nhappier ending. But Rome said: The first thing is empire. Egypt said: The\r\nfirst thing is fame. Greece said: The first thing is genius. Not one of\r\nthem said: The first thing is _Bread_.\r\n\r\nIn the Egyptian quarter of the British Museum, standing humbly in a glass\r\ncase between two mummied Pharaohs, is a little group of farm utensils. A\r\nfractured wooden plough, a rusted sickle, two sticks tied together with a\r\nleathern thong, and several tassels that had hung on the horns of the\r\noxen. A rummaging professor found these in the tomb of Seti I., who had\r\nhis will on the banks of the Nile three thousand years ago. Egypt had a\r\nmost elaborate government at that time. She had an army and navy, an art\r\nand literature. Yet her bread-tools were no better than those of the\r\nbarbarians whom she despised.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most baffling mysteries of history, that agriculture--the\r\nfirst industry to be learned, was the last one to be developed. For\r\nthousands of years the wise men of the world absolutely ignored the\r\nproblems of the farm. A farmer remained either a serf or a tenant. He was\r\na stolid drudge--\"brother to the ox.\" Even the masterful old Pilgrim\r\nFathers had no ploughs at all--nothing but hoes and sharp sticks, for the\r\nfirst twelve years of their pioneering.\r\n\r\nFifty-five years of American Independence went by before the first reaper\r\nclicked its way clumsily into fame, on a backwoods farm in Virginia. At\r\nthat time, 1831, the American people were free, but they held in their\r\nhands the land-tools of slaves. They had to labour and sweat in the\r\nfields, with the crude implements that had been produced by ages of\r\nslavery. For two generations they tried to build up a prosperous Republic\r\nwith sickles, flails, and wooden ploughs, and they failed.\r\n\r\nThere are men and women now alive who can remember the hunger year of\r\n1837, when there were wheat bounties in Maine and bread riots in New York\r\nCity. Flour mills were closed for lack of wheat. Starving men fell in the\r\nstreets of Boston and Philadelphia. Mobs of labourers, maddened by the\r\nfear of famine, broke into warehouses and carried away sacks of food as\r\nthough they were human wolves. Even in the Middle West--the prairie\r\nparadise of farmers--many a family fought against Death with the serf's\r\nweapon of Black Bread.\r\n\r\nEnterprise was not then an American virtue. The few men who dared to\r\nsuggest improvements were persecuted as enemies of society. The first iron\r\nploughs were said to poison the soil. The first railroad was torn up. The\r\nfirst telegraph wires were cut. The first sewing-machine was smashed. And\r\nthe first man who sold coal in Philadelphia was chased from the State as a\r\nswindler.\r\n\r\nEven the railway was a dangerous toy. The telegraph was still a dream in\r\nthe brain of Morse. John Deere had not invented his steel plough, nor Howe\r\nhis sewing-machine, nor Hoe his printing-press. There were no stoves nor\r\nmatches nor oil-lamps. Petroleum was peddled as a medicine at a dollar a\r\nbottle. Iron was $75 a ton. Money was about as reliable as mining stocks\r\nare to-day; and all the savings in all the banks would not now buy the\r\nchickens in Iowa.\r\n\r\nOur total exports were not more than we paid last year for diamonds and\r\nchampagne. Chicago was a twelve-family village. There was no West nor\r\nMiddle West. Not one grain of wheat had been grown in Minnesota, the\r\nDakotas, Nebraska, Colorado, Kansas, Washington, Nevada, Idaho, Montana,\r\nNew Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, Oklahoma or Texas.\r\n\r\nThe whole structure of civilisation, as we know it, was unbuilt; and most\r\nof its architects and builders were unborn or in the cradle. Spencer was\r\neleven years of age; Virchow was ten; Pasteur nine; Huxley six; Berthelot\r\nfour; and as for Haeckel, Carnegie, Morgan, Edison and their generation,\r\nthey had not yet appeared in the land of the living.\r\n\r\nThen came the Reaper.\r\n\r\nThis unappreciated machine, about which so little has been written,\r\nchanged the face of the world. It moved the civilised nations up out of\r\nthe bread line. It made prosperity possible; and elevated the whole\r\nstruggle for existence to a higher plane.\r\n\r\nLife is still a race--always will be; but not for bread. The lowest prizes\r\nnow are gold watches and steam yachts and automobiles. Even the hobo at\r\nthe back door scorns bread, unless we apologise for it with meat and jam.\r\n\r\nIt is so plentiful--this clean, white bread, that it is scarcely an\r\narticle of commerce any longer. In our hotels it is thrown in free of\r\ncharge, as though it were a pinch of salt or a glass of water. There is no\r\n\"penn'orth of bread\" in the bill, as there was in Falstaff's day.\r\n\r\nSeven bushels of wheat apiece! That is what we eighty-five million people\r\nate in 1906--twelve thousand million loaves of bread. Such a year of\r\nfeasting was new in the history of the world. And yet we sent a thousand\r\nmillion dollars' worth of food to other nations.\r\n\r\nSuppose that bread were money, just for one day! What a lesson it would be\r\non the social value of the reaper! Thirty loaves would be the day's pay of\r\na labourer--as much as he could carry on his back. Two loaves for a\r\ncigar--three for a shave--five for a bunch of violets--forty for a theatre\r\nticket--a hundred for a bottle of champagne! Is there anything cheaper\r\nthan bread?\r\n\r\nThe reaper was America's answer to Malthus--who scared England into\r\nabolishing the Corn Laws by his proclamation that \"the ultimate check to\r\npopulation is the lack of food.\" What would that well-meaning pessimist\r\nthink were he now alive, if he were told that the human race is growing\r\nwheat at the rate of ten bushels a year per family? Or that Minnesota and\r\nthe Dakotas (names that the world of his day had never heard) produce\r\nenough wheat to feed all the people of England?\r\n\r\nThe reaper was America's answer to the world's demand for democracy.\r\nInstead of bread riots and red flags and theories of an earthly paradise\r\nin which nobody worked but the Government, the United States invented a\r\nmachine that gave democracy a chance. Instead of a guillotine to cut off\r\nthe heads of the privileged people who ate too much, it produced a reaper\r\nthat gave everybody enough. This was not a complete answer, nor will\r\nthere ever be one, to the riddle of liberty, equality and fraternity. But\r\nit was so much better than theories and riots that it helped to persuade\r\ntwenty-five million immigrants to cross the ocean and become shareholders\r\nin the American Republic.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to trace back a strand in the twisted thread of cause\r\nand effect, we would find that many a factory and steel-mill owes its\r\norigin to the flood of wheat-money that came to us from Europe in 1880 and\r\n1881--every dollar of it made by the humble harvester.\r\n\r\nWithout this obedient slave of wood and steel, all our railroads and\r\nskyscrapers and automobiles could not save us from famine. If we had to\r\nreap our grain in the same way as the Romans did, it would take half the\r\nmen in the United States to feed us on bread alone, to say nothing of the\r\nrest of the menu.\r\n\r\nLike most great things, the reaper was born among humble people and in a\r\nhumble way. It was crude at first and dogged by failure. No one man made\r\nit. It was the product of a hundred brains.\r\n\r\nThe exact truth about its origin is not known and never will be. What few\r\nfacts there were have been torn and twisted by the bitter feuds of the\r\nPatent Office. Every letter and document that exists is controversial. So\r\nI cannot say that the story, as I give it, is entirely true, but only that\r\nit is as near as I can get to the truth after six months of investigation.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence to show that Cyrus Hall McCormick completed a practical\r\nreaper in 1831, although the first reaper patent was taken out in 1833 by\r\nan inventive seaman named Obed Hussey, of Baltimore. The young McCormick\r\ndid not secure his patent until 1834; but he had given a public exhibition\r\nin Virginia three years before.\r\n\r\nThere were nearly a hundred people who saw this exhibition. Not one of\r\nthem is now alive; and the story as told by their children has many little\r\ntouches of imagination. But in the main, it is very likely to be true.\r\n\r\nIt was in the fall of 1831 when Cyrus McCormick hitched four horses to his\r\nunwieldy machine and clattered out of the barnyard into a field of wheat\r\nnearby. Horses shied and pranced at the absurd object, which was unlike\r\nanything else on the face of the earth. Dogs barked. Small boys yelled.\r\nFarmers, whose backs were bent and whose fingers were scarred from the\r\nharvest labour, gazed with contemptuous curiosity at the queer contraption\r\nwhich was expected to cut grain without hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYRUS HALL McCORMICK]\r\n\r\n\r\nA little group of Negro slaves had spasms of uncomprehending delight in\r\none corner of the field, not one of them guessing that \"Massa\" McCormick's\r\ncomical machine was cutting at the chains that bound their children. And a\r\nnoisy crowd of white labourers followed the reaper up and down the field\r\nwith boisterous enmity; for here was an invention which threatened to\r\ndeprive them of the right to work--the precious right to work sixteen\r\nhours a day for three cents an hour.\r\n\r\nThe field was hilly and the reaper worked badly. It slewed and jolted\r\nalong, cutting the grain very irregularly. Seeing this, the owner of the\r\nfield--a man who was Ruff by name and rough by nature, rushed up to\r\nMcCormick and shouted--\"Here! This won't do. Stop your horses! Your\r\nmachine is rattling the heads off my wheat.\" \"It's a humbug,\" bawled one\r\nof the labourers. \"Give me the old cradle yet, boys!\" exclaimed a\r\nround-shouldered farmer. The Negroes turned handsprings with delight; and\r\nthe whole jeering mob gathered around the discredited machine.\r\n\r\nJust then a fine-looking man rode up on horseback. The crowd made way as\r\nhe came near, for they recognised him as the Honourable William Taylor--a\r\nconspicuous politician of that day.\r\n\r\n\"Pull down the fence and cross over into my field,\" he said to young\r\nMcCormick. \"I'll give you a fair chance to try your machine.\"\r\n\r\nMcCormick quickly accepted the offer, drove into Taylor's field, which was\r\nnot as hilly, and cut the grain successfully for four or five hours.\r\nAlthough the United States had been established more than fifty years\r\nbefore, this was the first grain that had ever been cut by machinery. The\r\nFathers of the Republic had eaten the bread of hand-labour all their\r\nlives, and never dreamed that the human race would ever find a better\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived home that evening, Cyrus thought that his troubles were\r\nover. He had reaped six acres of wheat in less than half a day--as much as\r\nsix men would have done by the old-fashioned method. He had been praised\r\nas well as jeered at. \"Your reaper is a success,\" said his father, \"and it\r\nmakes me feel proud to have a son do what I could not do.\"\r\n\r\nTwo Big Men had given him their approval--William Taylor and a Professor\r\nBradshaw, of the Female Academy in the town of Lexington, Virginia. The\r\nprofessor, who was a pompous and positive individual, made a solemn\r\ninvestigation of the reaper, and then announced, in slow, loud, and\r\nemphatic tones--\"That--machine--is--worth--a hundred--thousand--dollars.\"\r\n\r\nBut if Cyrus McCormick hoped to wake up the following morning and find\r\nhimself rich and famous, he was roughly disappointed. The local excitement\r\nsoon died out, and in a few days the men in the village store were\r\ndiscussing Webster's last speech against Nullification and Andrew\r\nJackson's war against the bankers. One old woman expressed the general\r\nfeeling by saying that young McCormick's reaper was \"a right, smart\r\ncurious sort of thing, but it won't come to much.\"\r\n\r\nMcCormick was at this time a youth of twenty-two. He had been one of four\r\npink, helpless babies, born in 1809, who became, each in his own world,\r\nthe greatest leader of his day--Darwin, Gladstone, Lincoln, and McCormick.\r\nLike Lincoln, McCormick first learned to breathe in a long cabin--but in\r\nVirginia. He was bred from a fighting race. His father had wrenched a\r\nliving from the rocks of Virginia for his family of nine. His grandfather\r\nhad fought the English in the Revolution. His great-grandfather had been\r\nan Indian fighter in Pennsylvania; and his great-great-grandfather battled\r\nwith a flint-lock against the soldiers of James II., at the siege of\r\nLondonderry.\r\n\r\nThe McCormick family, in 1809, had a good deal of what was then called\r\nprosperity. They had enough to eat--a roof that kept out the rain--1,800\r\nacres of land, or near-land--three saw-mills--two flour-mills, and a\r\ndistillery. They had very little money, because there was little to be\r\nhad. In the whole United States there was barely as much money as would\r\nbuy half of the New York Subway.\r\n\r\nThe first American McCormicks had a thousand dollars or more when they\r\nresolved to leave Ireland, and they were Scotch enough to invest the whole\r\namount in linen, which they sold at a high profit in Philadelphia. This\r\ncapital enabled them to acquire a small stock of books, tools, and\r\ncomforts, which were passed along from father to son.\r\n\r\nRobert McCormick--the father of Cyrus, was himself a remarkable Virginian.\r\nHe was quick with his hands in shaping iron and wood. In fact, he was\r\nfairly famous in his county as the inventor of a hemp-brake, a\r\nclover-sheller, a bellows and threshing machine. His mind was greedy for\r\nknowledge; and it was his habit, when the seven children were asleep, to\r\nexplore into the mysteries of astronomy until his candle had flickered its\r\nlife out. Twenty or more of his letters, which I have seen, are well\r\nwritten and with a fine use of bookish words.\r\n\r\nThe one persistent ambition of his life was to invent a reaper. It is also\r\ntrue, and a titbit of a fact for those who believe in prenatal\r\ninfluences, that during the year in which Cyrus H. McCormick was born, his\r\nfather first began the actual construction of a reaping machine.\r\n\r\nEspecially during the harvest months, the topic of conversation in the\r\nMcCormick home was whether the dream of \"reaping grain with horses\" could\r\never come true. \"Reaper,\" was one of the first words that baby Cyrus\r\nlearned to say; and his favourite play-toy, when he grew older, was the\r\nwreck of his father's reaper that wouldn't reap, which lay in rusty\r\ndisgrace near the barn-door.\r\n\r\n\"Often I have seen Robert McCormick standing over his machine,\" said one\r\nof his neighbours. \"He would be studying and thinking, drawing down his\r\nunder lip, as was his habit when he was puzzling over anything.\" His\r\nfriends ridiculed him for wasting so much time on a foolish toy, until he\r\nbecame half ashamed of it himself and quit his experimenting in the\r\ndaytime. But at night, he and Cyrus hammered away in the little log\r\nworkshop, as though they were a pair of conspirators.\r\n\r\nThe romantic mystery of these midnight labours made an indelible mark on\r\nthe brain of the boy Cyrus. He grew up to be serious and\r\nself-contained--quite unlike the boys of the neighbourhood. He was not\r\npopular and never cared to be.\r\n\r\n\"Cyrus was a natural mechanical genius from a child,\" said John Cash, who\r\nworked on the McCormick farm. \"He invented the best hillside plough ever\r\nused in this country. He and his father would lock themselves up in the\r\nshop and work for hours on a reaping machine. The neighbours thought they\r\nwere both unbalanced to have the idea of cutting grain with horses.\"\r\n\r\nCyrus was always busy making or mending some piece of machinery. He\r\nabhorred the drudgery of the farm; but delighted in any work that had an\r\nidea behind it. He surprised his teacher one morning by bringing to school\r\na twenty-inch globe of wood, which turned on its axis as the earth does,\r\nand had the seas and continents outlined in ink.\r\n\r\n\"That young fellow is ahead of me,\" said the amazed teacher.\r\n\r\nAt fifteen Cyrus had invented a new grain cradle. At twenty-one he\r\nimproved a machine which his father had made to break hemp. And at\r\ntwenty-two this young country-boy, who had never seen a college, a city,\r\nor a railroad, constructed _the first practical American reaper_. It was a\r\nclumsy makeshift--as crude as a Red River ox-cart; but it was built on the\r\nright lines. It was not at all handsome or well made or satisfactory; but\r\nit was a reaper that reaped.\r\n\r\nBut McCormick soon discovered that it was not enough to invent a reaper.\r\nWhat the world needed was a man who was strong and dominating enough to\r\nforce his reaper upon the unwilling labourers of the harvest fields.\r\n\r\nTenacity! Absolute indifference to defeat! The lust for victory that makes\r\na man unconscious of the blows he gives or takes! This was what was\r\nneeded, and what Cyrus McCormick possessed, to a greater degree, perhaps,\r\nthan any other man in American history.\r\n\r\nTenacity! It was in his blood. Back of him was the hardiest breed that was\r\never mixed into the American blend--the pick of the Scots who fought their\r\nway to the United States by way of Ireland. These Irish Scots, few as\r\nthey were, led the way across the Alleghanies, founded Pittsburgh, made a\r\ntrail to Texas, and put five Presidents in the White House.\r\n\r\nAnd tenacity was bred, as well as born, into Cyrus McCormick. He went\r\nbarefooted as a boy, not for lack of shoes, but to make him tough. \"I want\r\nmy boys to know how to endure hardship,\" said his mother. He sat on a slab\r\nbench in the little log school house and learned to read from the Book of\r\nGenesis. He sang Psalms with forty verses, on Sundays, and sat as still as\r\na graven image during the three-hour sermons, for his father was a\r\nPresbyterian of the old Covenanter brand.\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass that Cyrus McCormick clung to his reaper, as John Knox\r\nhad to his Bible. \"His whole soul was wrapped up in it,\" said one of his\r\nneighbours. He grew as indifferent to the rough jokes of the farmers as\r\nMartin Luther was to the sneers of the village priests. The making of\r\nreapers became more than a business. It was a creed--a religion--a new\r\neleventh commandment.\r\n\r\nBy the time he was thirty, he had become a nineteenth century Mohammed,\r\nready for a world crusade. His war-cry was--Great is the Reaper, and\r\nMcCormick is its prophet.\r\n\r\nLike Mohammed, he had his visions of future glory. On one occasion, while\r\nriding on horseback through a wilderness path, the dazzling thought\r\nflashed upon his mind--\"Perhaps I may make a million dollars from this\r\nreaper.\" This idea remained for years the driving wheel of his brain.\r\n\r\n\"The thought was so enormous,\" he said afterward, \"that it seemed like a\r\ndream--like dwelling in the clouds--so remote, so unattainable, so\r\nexalted, so visionary.\"\r\n\r\nAlso, like Mohammed, he had a period of preparatory solitude. Soon after\r\nthe first exhibition of his reaper, he bought a tract of land and farmed\r\nit alone, with two aged Negroes as housekeepers. Here he lived for more\r\nthan a year with no companion except his reaper. He seemed at this time,\r\ntoo, to have resolved upon a life of celibacy, for I find in one of his\r\nletters an allusion to two young ladies of unusual attractiveness. \"They\r\nare pretty, smart and rich,\" he writes, \"but alas, I have other business\r\nto attend to!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VIRGINIAN BIRTHPLACE OF THE McCORMICK REAPER.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two things of which he stood most in need were money and cheaper iron.\r\nSo, after thinking over the situation in his lonely cabin, he decided to\r\nbuild a furnace and make his own iron. His father and a neighbour joined\r\nhim in the enterprise. They built the furnace, made the iron, and might\r\nhave forgotten the reaper, if the financial earthquake of 1839 had not\r\nshaken them down into the general wreckage. The neighbour who had been\r\nmade a partner signed over his property to his mother, and threw the whole\r\nburden of the bankruptcy upon the McCormick family, crushing them for a\r\ntime into an abyss of debt and poverty.\r\n\r\nCyrus McCormick gave up everything he owned to the creditors--everything\r\nexcept his reaper, which nobody wanted. So far his vision of wealth was\r\nstill a dream. Instead of being the possessor of a million, he was eight\r\nyears older, and penniless.\r\n\r\nThere were four sons and three daughters in the family, and the nine of\r\nthem slaved for five years to save the homestead from the auctioneer. Once\r\nthe sheriff rode up with a writ, but was so deeply impressed with their\r\nenergy and uprightness that he rode away with the dreaded paper still in\r\nhis pocket.\r\n\r\nUp to this time Cyrus had not sold one reaper. As Mohammed preached for\r\nten years without converting anyone except his own relatives, so Cyrus\r\nMcCormick preached the gospel of the reaper for ten years without success.\r\nThen, in 1841, he sold two for $100 apiece. The next year seven daring\r\nfarmers came to the McCormick homestead, each with $100 in his hands.\r\n\r\nThis brilliant success brought the whole family into line behind Cyrus,\r\nand the farm was transformed into a reaper factory. Twenty-nine machines,\r\n\"fearfully and wonderfully made,\" were sold in 1843, and fifty in 1844.\r\nThere were troubles, of course. Some buyers failed to pay. A workman who\r\nwas sent out on horseback to collect $300, ran away with horse, money and\r\nall. But none of these things moved Cyrus. At last, after thirteen years\r\nof delay, he was selling reapers.\r\n\r\nBest of all, an order for eight had come from Cincinnati. These were the\r\nfirst reapers that were sold outside of Virginia. They were seen by the\r\nmore enterprising farmers of Ohio and created a sensation wherever they\r\nwere used. Cyrus, who was now a powerful, broad-chested man of thirty-six,\r\ncaught a glimpse of his opportunity and sprang to seize it. He saw that\r\nthe time had come to leave the backwoods farm--forty miles from a\r\nblacksmith--sixty miles from a canal--one hundred miles from a railway.\r\nSo, with $300 in his belt, he set out on horseback for the West.\r\n\r\nHere he saw _the prairies_. To a man who had spent his life in a hollow of\r\nthe Alleghanies, the West was a new world. It was the natural home of the\r\nreaper. The farmers of Virginia might continue forever to harvest their\r\nsmall, hilly fields by hand, but here--in this vast land ocean, with few\r\nlabourers and an infinity of acres, the reaper was as indispensable as the\r\nplough. To reap even one of these new States by hand would require the\r\nwhole working population of the country.\r\n\r\nAlso, in Illinois, McCormick saw what made his Scotch heart turn cold\r\nwithin him--he saw hogs and cattle feeding in the autumn wheat-fields,\r\nwhich could not be reaped for lack of labourers. Five million bushels of\r\nwheat had grown and ripened--enough to empty the horn of plenty into every\r\nfarmer's home. Men and women, children and grandmothers, toiled day and\r\nnight to gather in the yellow food. But the short harvest-season rushed\r\npast so quickly that tons of it lay rotting under the hoofs of cattle.\r\n\r\nIt was a puzzling problem. It was too much prosperity--a new trouble for\r\nfarmers. In Europe, men had been plenty and acres scarce. Here, acres were\r\nplenty and men scarce. Ripe grain--the same in all countries, will not\r\nwait. Unless it is gathered quickly--in from four to ten days, it breaks\r\ndown and decays. So, even to the dullest minds, it was clear that there\r\nmust be some better way of snatching in the ripened grain.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the trampled wheat goaded McCormick almost into a frenzy of\r\nactivity. He rode on horseback through Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri,\r\nOhio, and New York, proclaiming his harvest gospel and looking for\r\nmanufacturers who would build his reapers. From shop to shop he went with\r\nthe zeal of a Savonarola.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MODEL OF THE FIRST PRACTICAL REAPER]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, in the little town of Brockport, New York, he found the\r\nfirst practical men who appreciated his invention--Dayton S. Morgan and\r\nWilliam H. Seymour. Morgan was a handy young machinist who had formed a\r\npartnership with Seymour--a prosperous store-keeper. They listened to\r\nMcCormick with great interest and agreed to make a hundred reapers. By\r\nthis decision they both later became millionaires, and also entered\r\nhistory as the founders of the first reaper factory in the world.\r\n\r\nAltogether, in the two years after he left Virginia, McCormick sold 240\r\nreapers. This was Big Business; but it was only a morsel in proportion to\r\nhis appetite. Neither was it satisfactory. He found himself tangled in a\r\nsnarl of trouble because of bad iron, stupid workmen, and unreliable\r\nmanufacturers. He cut the Gordian knot by building a factory of his own at\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the wisest decisions of his life, though at the time it\r\nappeared to be a disastrous mistake. Chicago, in 1847, showed no signs of\r\nits present greatness. As a city, it was a ten-year-old experiment, built\r\nin a swamp, without a railway or a canal. It was ugly and dirty, with a\r\nriver that ran in the wrong direction; but it was _busy_. It was the link\r\nbetween the Mississippi and the Great Lakes--a central market where wheat\r\nwas traded for lumber and furs for iron. It had no history--no ancient\r\nfamilies clogging up the streets with their special privileges. And best\r\nof all, it was a place where a big new idea was actually preferred to a\r\nsmall old one.\r\n\r\nChicago did not look at McCormick with dead eyes and demand a certified\r\ncheque from his ancestors. It sized him up in a few swift glances and saw\r\na thick-set, ruddy man, with the physique of a heavy-weight wrestler, dark\r\nhair that waved in glossy furrows, and strong eyes that struck you like a\r\nblow. It glanced at his reaper and saw a device to produce more wheat.\r\nMore wheat meant more business, so Chicago said ----\r\n\r\n\"Glad to see you. You're the right man and you're in the right place. Come\r\nin and get busy.\" William B. Ogden, the first Mayor of Chicago, listened\r\nto his story for two minutes, then asked him how much he wanted for a half\r\ninterest. McCormick had little money and no prestige. Ogden had a surplus\r\nof both. So a partnership was arranged, and the new firm plunged toward\r\nprosperity by selling $50,000 worth of reapers for the next harvest.\r\n\r\nAt last there had come a break in the clouds, and McCormick found his path\r\nflooded with sunshine. He was no longer a wanderer in the night. He was\r\nthe Reaper King--the founder of a new dynasty. As soon as possible he\r\nbought out Ogden, and thenceforth established a one-man business. By 1851\r\nhe was making a thousand reapers a year, and owned one-tenth of the\r\nmillion dollars he had dreamed of in the Virginian wilderness.\r\n\r\nAt this point his life changes. His pioneer troubles are over. There are\r\nno more thousand-mile rides on horseback--no more conflicts with jeering\r\ncrowds--no more smashing of reapers by farm labourers. The repeal of the\r\nCorn Laws in England had opened up a new market for our wheat, and the\r\ndiscovery of gold in California was booming the reaper business by making\r\nmoney plentiful and labour scarce.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, McCormick looked up from his work in the factory, and saw that\r\nhe was not only rich, but famous. One of his reapers had taken the Grand\r\nPrize at a World's Fair in England. Even the London _Times_, which had\r\nfirst ridiculed his reaper as \"a cross between an Astley chariot, a\r\nwheelbarrow and a flying machine,\" was obliged to admit, several days\r\nlater, that \"the McCormick reaper is worth the whole cost of the\r\nExposition.\"\r\n\r\nSeventeen years later, on the imperial farm, near Paris, Napoleon III.\r\ndescended from his carriage and fastened the Cross of the Legion of Honour\r\nupon McCormick's coat. There was a picture that some American-souled\r\nartist, when we have one, will delight to put on canvas. How splendid was\r\nthe contrast, and how significant of the New Age of Democracy, between the\r\nsuave and feeble Emperor, enjoying the sunset rays of his inherited glory,\r\nand the strong-faced, rough-handed Virginian farmer, who had built up a\r\nnew empire of commerce that will last as long as the human race eats\r\nbread!\r\n\r\nFrom first to last, the stout-hearted old Reaper King received no favours\r\nfrom Congress or the Patent Office. He built up his stupendous business\r\nwithout a land grant or a protective tariff. By the time that his Chicago\r\nfactory was ten years old, he had sold 23,000 reapers, and cleared a\r\nprofit of nearly $1,300,00. The dream of his youth had been realised, and\r\nmore. All told, in 1859, there were 50,000 reapers in the United States,\r\ndoing the work of 350,000 men, saving $4,000,000 in wages, and cramming\r\nthe barns with 50,000,000 bushels of grain.\r\n\r\nSo, on his fiftieth birthday, the battle-scarred McCormick found himself a\r\nmillionaire. He was also married, having fallen in love with Miss Nettie\r\nFowler, of New York, a young lady of unusual beauty and ability. No\r\nhistory of the reaper can be complete without a reference to this\r\nremarkable woman, who has been for fifty years, and is to-day, one of the\r\nactive factors in our industrial development. No important step has ever\r\nbeen taken either by her husband or her three sons, until it has received\r\nher approval. And Mrs. McCormick has been much more than a mere adviser.\r\nHer exact memory and keen grasp of the complex details of her husband's\r\nbusiness made her practically an unofficial manager. She suggested\r\neconomies at the factory, stopped the custom of closing the plant in\r\nmidsummer, studied the abilities of the workmen, and on several occasions\r\nsuperintended the field-trials in Europe.\r\n\r\nChicago may not know it, but it is true, that its immense McCormick\r\nfactory owes its existence to Mrs. McCormick. After the Big Fire of 1871,\r\nwhen his $2,000,000 plant was in ruins, McCormick concluded to retire. He\r\nstill had a fortune of three or four millions and he was sixty-two years\r\nof age. His managers advised him not to rebuild, because of the excessive\r\ncost of new machinery.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the fiery cyclone had passed, he and his wife drove to the\r\nwrecked factory. Several hundred of the workmen gathered about the\r\ncarriage, and the chief engineer, acting as spokesman, said: \"Well, Mr.\r\nMcCormick, shall we start the small engine and make repairs, or shall we\r\nstart the big engine and make machines?\"\r\n\r\nMr. McCormick turned to his wife and said, \"Which shall it be?\" It was a\r\nbreathless moment for the workmen.\r\n\r\n\"Build again at once,\" said Mrs. McCormick. \"I do not want our boy to grow\r\nup in idleness; I want him to work, as a useful citizen, and a true\r\nAmerican.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Start The Big Engine_,\" said McCormick. The men threw their hats in the\r\nair and cheered. They sprang at the smoking debris, and began to rebuild\r\nbefore the cinders were cold.\r\n\r\nSuch was the second birth of the vast factory which, in its sixty years,\r\nhas created fully 5,000,000 harvesters, and which is now so magically\r\nautomatic that, with 6,000 workmen, it can make one-third of all the\r\ngrain-gathering machinery of the world.\r\n\r\nPractically nothing has been written about McCormick from the human nature\r\nside. He was one of those Cromwellian men who can only be appreciated at a\r\ndistance. He was too absorbed in his work to be congenial and too\r\naggressive to be popular. He shouldered his way roughly against the\r\nslow-moving crowd; and the people whom he thrust out of his way naturally\r\ndid not consider the importance of his life-task.\r\n\r\nMost of the really great men of his day were his friends--Horace Greeley,\r\nfor instance, and Peter Cooper, Junius Morgan, Abram S. Hewitt, Cyrus W.\r\nField, and Ferdinand De Lesseps. But among the men of his own trade he\r\nstood hostile and alone.\r\n\r\n\"McCormick wants to keep the whole reaper business to himself. He will not\r\nlive and let live,\" said his competitors. And they had reason to say so.\r\nHe did want to dominate. He wanted to make all the harvesting machines\r\nthat were made--not one less. He was not at all a modern\r\n\"community-of-interest\" financier. He was a man of an outgrown school--a\r\nconsistent individualist, not only in business, but in politics and\r\nreligion as well. There was no compartment in his brain for mergers and\r\ncombines--for theories of government ownership--for Higher Criticism and\r\nthe new theology. He was a Benjamin Franklin commercialist, a Thomas\r\nJefferson Democrat, and a John Knox Presbyterian.\r\n\r\nHe had worked harder to establish the reaper business than any other man.\r\nHe was making reapers when William Deering was five years old, and before\r\nRalph Emerson and \"Bill\" Whiteley were born. He had graduated into\r\nsuccess through a fifteen-year course in failure. The world into which he\r\nwas born was as hostile to him as the Kentucky wilderness was to Daniel\r\nBoone or the Atlantic Ocean to Columbus. He was hard-fibred, because he\r\nhad to be. He was the thin end of the wedge that split into fragments the\r\nagricultural obstacle to social progress.\r\n\r\nOne careless writer of biographies has said that McCormick began at the\r\nfoot of the ladder. This is not correct. When he began, there was no\r\nladder. _He had to build it as he climbed._\r\n\r\nThe first man who gave battle to McCormick was an erratic genius named\r\nObed Hussey, who, as we have seen, secured a reaper patent in 1833. No two\r\nmen were ever more unlike than Hussey and McCormick. Hussey was born in\r\nNantucket; and he had roamed the frozen North as a whaling seaman. He was\r\ninventive, poetic, and as whimsical as the weather. His delight was in\r\nworking out some mechanical problem. His first invention was a machine to\r\nmake pins. Soon afterward, while he was living in Cincinnati,\r\nconstructing a machine to mould candles, a friend said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Hussey, why don't you invent a machine to reap grain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there no such machines?\" he asked in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said his friend, \"and whoever can invent one will make a fortune.\"\r\n\r\nHussey forsook his candle machine, set to work upon a reaper, and within a\r\nyear had one in the fields. Then came a twenty-five-year war with\r\nMcCormick, which was waged furiously in the Patent Office, the courts, and\r\na hundred wheat-fields. Hussey won the opening battle by arriving first at\r\nthe Patent Office, although his machine, as claimed by McCormick, was two\r\nyears younger. By 1841 Hussey had sold reapers in five states, and ten\r\nyears later he shared the honours with McCormick at the London World's\r\nFair.\r\n\r\nBoth machines were very crude and unsatisfactory. Hussey's had a better\r\ncutting apparatus and McCormicks was more complete. In the long run, each\r\nadopted the devices of the other, and a better reaper was evolved. Before\r\nmany years, it became apparent that Hussey was outclassed. By 1858 he was\r\nleft so far behind that he lost his interest in reapers and invented a\r\nsteam-plough.\r\n\r\nHis first machine was \"really a mower,\" says Merritt Finley Miller, one of\r\nthe two professors who have written on harvesting machinery. It lacked the\r\nmaster-wheel, the reel and the divider, without which the grain cannot be\r\nrightly handled. When Hussey gave up the contest, his invention was bought\r\nfor $200,000 by William F. Ketchum and others, who adapted it into a\r\nmowing-machine.\r\n\r\n\"Hussey was a very peculiar man,\" said Ralph Emerson. \"His machine was\r\nfairly good, but it was a failure in the market, because he would not put\r\non a reel. He refused to do this, saying he did not invent a reel, and it\r\nwould be a falsehood if he put one on. He said that it was contrary to his\r\nprinciples to sell anything that he had not invented.\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion I went to buy a shop licence from him. 'Have you a\r\nthousand dollars in your pocket?' he asked. 'No,' said I. 'Can you get me\r\nthree thousand dollars by daylight to-morrow morning?' 'No,' I answered,\r\n'but I can get it by noon.' 'Well,' said Hussey, 'I want to be very\r\nreasonable with you. If you'll pay me one thousand dollars before you\r\nleave the house, or twenty-five hundred dollars before daybreak to-morrow,\r\nI'll sell you a licence. Otherwise, it will cost you twelve thousand\r\ndollars.'\r\n\r\n\"Several days later I paid him twelve thousand dollars, and as he handed\r\nme the licence, he said--'Now, don't say that I never offered you this for\r\na thousand dollars.'\"\r\n\r\nHussey's adventurous life was snapped short by a tragic death. While he\r\nwas on a train at Baltimore, a little girl was crying for a drink of\r\nwater. The kind-hearted old sailor-mechanic got off the train, brought her\r\na glass of water, and on his way to return the glass, he slipped and fell\r\nbetween the moving wheels.\r\n\r\nOf all the men who fought McCormick in the earlier days, I found only two\r\nnow alive--Ralph Emerson, of Rockford, and William N. Whiteley, of\r\nSpringfield, Ohio. Both of these men to-day generously give the old\r\nwarrior his due.\r\n\r\n\"McCormick was the first man to make the reaper a success in the field,\"\r\nsaid Whiteley, the battle-worn giant of Ohio, where I found him still at\r\nwork. \"McCormick was a fighter--a bulldog, we called him; but those were\r\nrough days. The man who couldn't fight was wiped out.\"\r\n\r\nRalph Emerson, now one of the most venerable figures in Illinois, rose\r\nfrom a sick-bed against his doctors orders, so that he might be\r\nmagnanimous to his former antagonist.\r\n\r\n\"McCormick's first reapers were a failure,\" said he, speaking slowly and\r\nwith great difficulty; \"and he owed his preëminence mainly to his great\r\nbusiness ability. His enemies have said that he was not an inventor, but I\r\nsay that he was an inventor of eminence.\"\r\n\r\nSo, as the gray haze of years enables us to trace the larger outlines of\r\nhis work, we can see that McCormick was especially fitted for a task\r\nwhich, up to his day, had never been done, and which will never need to be\r\nrepeated during the lifetime of our earth. He was absolutely mastered by\r\none idea, as wholly as Copernicus or Columbus. His business was his life.\r\nIt was not accidental, as with Rockefeller, nor incidental, as with\r\nCarnegie. On one occasion when a friend was joking him about his poor\r\njudgment in outside affairs, he whirled around in his chair and said\r\nemphatically: \"I have one purpose in life, and only one--the success and\r\nwidespread use of my machines. All other matters are to me too\r\ninsignificant to be considered.\"\r\n\r\nHe made money--ten millions or more. But a hundred millions would not have\r\nbribed him to forsake his reaper. It was as much a part of him as his\r\nright hand. In several of his business letters he writes as though he had\r\nbeen a Hebrew prophet, charged with a world-message of salvation.\r\n\r\n\"But for the fact that Providence has seemed to assist me in all our\r\nbusiness,\" he writes on one critical occasion, \"it has at times seemed\r\nthat I would almost sink under the weight of responsibility hanging upon\r\nme. I believe the Lord will help us out.\"\r\n\r\nNot that he left any detail to Providence to which he could personally\r\nattend. He was a Puritan of the \"trust-in-God-and-keep-your-powder-dry\"\r\nspecies. A little farther down, in this same letter, he writes--\"Meet\r\nHussey in Maryland and _put him down_.\"\r\n\r\nThe fountain-springs of his life were wholly within. He acted from a few\r\nbasic, unchangeable convictions. If public opinion was with him, he was\r\ngratified; if it was against him he thought no more of it than of the\r\nrustling of the trees when the wind blew.\r\n\r\n\"When anyone opposed his plans and showed that they were impossible,\" said\r\none of his superintendents, \"I noticed that he never argued; he just went\r\non working.\"\r\n\r\nHis brain had certain subjects distinctly mapped out. What he knew--he\r\nknew. He had no hazy imaginings. He lived in a black and white world and\r\nabhorred all half-tints. He was right--always right, and the men who\r\nopposed him were Philistines and false prophets, who deserved to be\r\nconsumed by sudden fire from Heaven.\r\n\r\nIt was this inward spiritual force that made him irresistible. Small men\r\nshrivelled up when he spoke to them.\r\n\r\n\"The exhibition of his powerful will was at times actually terrible,\" said\r\none of his attorneys. \"If any other man on this earth ever had such a\r\nwill, certainly I have not heard of it.\"\r\n\r\nSmall and easy undertakings had no interest for him whatever. It was the\r\nimpossibility that enraged and inspired him. At the sight of an obstacle\r\nin his path, he rushed forward like a charge of cavalry. When the Civil\r\nWar was at its height, he and Horace Greeley, who was very similar to him\r\nin this respect, actually believed that they could stop it. They had\r\nseveral long conferences in the Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York, and\r\nMcCormick went so far in 1864 as to prepare a statement of principles\r\nwhich he fully believed would restore peace and harmony between the North\r\nand the South.\r\n\r\nSuch was this massive, unbendable American. As we shall see, he was far\r\nfrom being the only strong, picturesque figure in the industry. But it\r\nwould make many a book to tell in detail the effect of his life work upon\r\nthe progress of the United States. It was a New World, truly, that had\r\nbeen created, alike for the people of the farms and of the cities, in the\r\nyear that the victorious old Reaper King was carried to his grave, with a\r\nsheaf of wheat on his breast.\r\n\r\nWhat if there had been no reapers, and no hunger-insurance, and no cheap\r\nbread! What sort of an American nation would we have, if we were still\r\nusing such food-implements as the sickle and the flail?\r\n\r\nCould we have swung through four years of Civil War, as we did, without\r\nfamine or national insolvency?\r\n\r\nCould the West have risen toward its present greatness if its billion\r\nacres had to be harvested by hand?\r\n\r\nCould the railways alone, which produce nothing, have given us more food\r\nfor less work--the first necessity of a civilised democracy?\r\n\r\nWould our manufacturers be creating new wealth at the rate of sixteen\r\nbillions a year, if the reaper had not enriched the farmers and sent half\r\nthe farm-hands into the factories?\r\n\r\nAnd our towering cities--two of them more populous than the thirteen\r\ncolonies were, how large would they be and how prosperous if bread were\r\ntwenty cents a pound?\r\n\r\nAs Seward once said, it was the reaper that \"pushed the American frontier\r\nwestward at the rate of thirty miles a year.\" Most of the western\r\nrailways were built to the wheat; and it was wheat money that paid for\r\nthem. The reaper clicked ahead of the railroad, and civilisation followed\r\nthe wheat, from Chicago to Puget Sound, just as the self-binder is leading\r\nthe railroad to-day--three hundred miles in front in Western Canada, and\r\neight hundred miles in Siberia. Even so unyielding a partisan of the\r\nrailroads as Marvin Hughitt admitted to me that \"the reaper has not yet\r\nreceived proper recognition for its development of the West.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War the reaper was doing the work of a million men in the\r\ngrain-fields of the North. It enabled a widow, with five sons, to send\r\nthem all to the front, and yet gather every sheaf into the barn. It kept\r\nthe wolf from the door, and more--it paid our European debts in wheat. It\r\nwiped out all necessity for Negro labour in the wheat States, just as a\r\ncotton-picker will, some day, in the South.\r\n\r\n\"The reaper is to the North what the slave is to the South,\" said Edwin M.\r\nStanton in 1861. \"It releases our young men to do battle for the Union,\r\nand at the same time keeps up the supply of the nation's bread.\"\r\n\r\nLincoln called out every third man, yet the crops increased. Europeans\r\ncould not believe it. They heard in 1861 that we were sending three times\r\nas much wheat to England as we had ever done before. They shook their\r\nheads and said--\"Another American story!\" when they were told that we were\r\nsupporting two vast armies and yet selling other nations enough grain to\r\nfeed thirty-five million people. Naturally, no country that clung to the\r\nsickle and flail could be convinced of such a preposterous miracle.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, the mighty river of wheat that flowed from the West became\r\nso wide and so deep that it poured a yellow stream into every American\r\nhome. It began to turn the wheels of fourteen thousand flour-mills. Rich\r\ncities sprang up, like Aladdin palaces, beside its banks--Chicago, St.\r\nLouis, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Kansas City, St. Paul, Omaha,\r\nDes Moines. All of these, and a hundred lesser ones, were nourished into\r\nprosperity by the rising current of reaper-wheat, as it moved from the\r\nMississippi to the sea.\r\n\r\nBy 1876 we had become the champion food-producers of the world. A Kansas\r\nfarmer was raising six bushels of wheat with as little labour as an\r\nItalian spent to produce one. And there was one doughty Scot--Dalrymple of\r\nDakota, who was guillotining more wheat with four hundred labourers and\r\nthree hundred harvesters, than five thousand peasants could garner by\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nInevitably, the American Farmer became a financier. In 1876 he earned\r\ntwenty-four per cent. He had twenty-seven hundred millions to spend. By\r\n1880 he had begun to buy so much store goods that the United States was\r\nable to write a Declaration of Industrial Independence. Steadily he has\r\ngrown richer and wiser, until now he is the owner of a billion-acre farm,\r\nworth thirty dollars an acre, operated with farm machinery that cost him\r\n$900,000,000 and producing, in a single year, seven thousand times the\r\nvalue of a millionaire.\r\n\r\nSuch, in one country, is the amazing result which the Reaper has helped to\r\ncreate. And this is not all. It is now more necessary to the human race\r\nthan the railway. It is fighting back famine in fifty countries. Its click\r\nhas become the music of an International Anthem. The nations are feeding\r\neach other, in spite of their tariffs and armies. The whole world takes\r\ndinner at the one long table; and the fear of hunger is dying out of the\r\nhearts of men; and the prayer of the Christian centuries is\r\nanswered--\"Give us this day our daily bread.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF DEERING\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty years ago two young farmers named Marsh were cutting grain near\r\nDeKalb, Illinois. They were too intelligent--too American--to be fond of\r\nwork for work's sake. And of all their drudgery, the everlasting stooping\r\nover bundles to bind them into sheaves galled them most. Such\r\nback-breaking toil, they thought, might be well enough for kangaroos, but\r\nit certainly was not suitable for an erect biped, like man.\r\n\r\n\"If I didn't have to walk from bundle to bundle, and hump myself like a\r\nhorseshoe, I could do twice as much work,\" said one of the brothers.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the other, \"why can't we fix a platform on the reaper, and\r\nhave the grain carried up to us?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a brilliant idea and a new one. Neither of the young fellows had\r\never seen a reaper factory; but they were handy and self-reliant. By the\r\nnext autumn they were in the field with their new machine, and as they had\r\nexpected, they bound the grain twice as quickly as they had the year\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nSo was born the famous Marsh harvester, which proved to be the half-way\r\nmark in the evolution of the grain-reaping machine. It was the child of\r\nthe reaper and the parent of the self-binder. It cut in two the cost of\r\nbinding grain. But it did more than this--it gave the farmer his first\r\nchance to stand erect, and forced him to be quick, for the two men who\r\nstood on the harvester were compelled to bind the grain as fast as it was\r\ncut. Thus it introduced the factory system, one might say, into the\r\nharvest-field. For the first time the Big Minute made its appearance on\r\nthe farm.\r\n\r\nThe Marsh boys, never dreaming that they had helped to change the\r\ndestinies of nations, took out a flimsy patent on their invention, and\r\nwent on with their farm work. Two summers later, as they were at work with\r\nit, their home-made harvester broke down. A farmer from Plano, near\r\nDeKalb, named Lewis Steward, was riding by. He stopped, and, being a man\r\nof unusual abilities and discernment, he at once saw the value of the\r\nMarsh machine, even in its disabled state.\r\n\r\n\"Boys, you're on the right track,\" he said. \"If you can run your machine\r\nten rods, it can be made to run ten miles. It is superior to anything now\r\nin use.\"\r\n\r\nThus cheered, the Marsh brothers went to Plano, arranged a partnership\r\nwith a clever mechanic named John F. Hollister, and began to make\r\nharvesters for sale. To their surprise the new machine was not welcomed.\r\nIt was received with an almost unanimous roar of disapproval. It was a\r\n\"man-killer,\" said the farmers. Now, the Marsh brothers were quick,\r\nnervous men, and they had built a machine to suit themselves. But it was\r\nundeniably too fast and nerve-racking for most farmers. The labourers\r\nrefused to work with it.\r\n\r\nThe Marshes overcame the obstacle in a very ingenious way. They put\r\n_girls_ on their harvesters, instead of men. Not ordinary girls, to be\r\nsure, but vigorous German maidens, who were swift and skilful binders.\r\nAlso, they had well-trained men, disguised as hoboes, who mingled in the\r\ncrowd around the harvester at times of demonstration, and volunteered to\r\nget aboard of it. To see a girl or a \"Weary Willie\" binding grain on the\r\nnew machine shamed the labourers into a surrender, and in 1864 two dozen\r\nof the Marsh harvesters were sold.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM DEERING]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this year one of the Marshes performed a feat that seemed more\r\nappropriate for a circus than for a grain-field. Riding alone on a\r\nharvester, he bound a whole acre of wheat in fifty-five minutes. Little\r\nwas heard of this amazing achievement at the time, as the national mind\r\nwas distraught over the death grapple of Grant and Lee in Virginia.\r\n\r\nBut there was one quick-eyed man in Chicago named Gammon who heard of the\r\nevent, and acted upon it so promptly that the goddess of prosperity picked\r\nhim out as one of her favourites. Several years before, Gammon had been a\r\nMethodist preacher in Maine. A weak throat had brought his sermons to an\r\nend, and he became a reaper salesman in Chicago. He was shrewd and honest,\r\nand in 1864 his profits were very nearly forty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard that W. W. Marsh had bound an acre of grain in fifty-five\r\nminutes, on a new-fangled reaper, he caught the next train for DeKalb,\r\nand bought a licence to manufacture Marsh harvesters. He took in a\r\npartner--J. D. Easter--and the business inched ahead slowly, until in 1870\r\nthe sales rose to a thousand. Easter and Gammon were driving their small\r\nfactory ahead at full speed. If they only could secure enough capital,\r\nthey would surprise the world.\r\n\r\nOne evening, while Gammon was worrying over this lack, he heard a gentle\r\nknock at the door. He opened it to one of his old acquaintances from\r\nMaine.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gammon,\" said the visitor, \"I have about forty thousand dollars of\r\nspare money that I would like to invest in Chicago real estate, and I want\r\nyour advice as to the best place to buy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said Gammon, springing to his feet in delight. \"Have you money to\r\ninvest? Give it to me and I'll pay you ten per cent. or make you a partner\r\nin the best business in Illinois.\"\r\n\r\nThe visitor, whose name was William Deering, knew nothing whatever about\r\nreapers nor wheat-fields. He had gained a fair-sized fortune in the\r\nwholesale dry-goods business. But he was a Methodist and had confidence in\r\nthe ex-reverend E. H. Gammon; so he passed his $40,000 across the table\r\nand the next day went home to Maine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM N. WHITELEY Photo by Baumgardner, Springfield, O.\r\n\r\nC. W. MARSH\r\n\r\nJOHN F. APPLEBY Photo by Rice, Milwaukee\r\n\r\nE. H. GAMMON]\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years later Deering came down to see how Gammon and the $40,000 were\r\nfaring. The books showed a profit of $80,000. So Deering requested that he\r\nbe made a partner. A year afterward Gammon fell sick and begged Deering to\r\ncome to Illinois and manage the business. Deering consented to be manager\r\nfor one year only; but Gammon's sickness continued.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said William Deering, who told me this story, \"in that way I got\r\ninto the harvester business and had to stay in. But I did not even know,\r\nat that time, the appearance of our own machine.\"\r\n\r\nDeering's competitors at first called him a greenhorn. But they forgot\r\nthat he was the only one among them who had been trained in the art of\r\nbusiness. He was already a veteran--a prize winner--in the game of\r\nfinance. For thirty years, ever since he began to earn $18 a month in his\r\nfather's woolen mills, he had been a man of affairs. He had, in fact,\r\nestablished the wholesale dry-goods house of Deering, Milliken & Co.,\r\nwhich still stands as one of the largest of its kind. This training was\r\nall the more valuable an asset because of the conditions that prevailed\r\nwhen Deering entered the harvester trade. For he arrived in that worst of\r\nall years in the last century--1873. The Jay Cooke panic was at its\r\nheight. The proudest corporations were falling like grass before a mower.\r\nIt was a year of dread and paralysis. But Deering faced these\r\ndisadvantages with ability, with sheer, dogged persistence, and with\r\nbusiness training. In seven years he had become one of the greatest of the\r\nharvester kings, and was leading them all up to a higher level.\r\n\r\nWe shall understand more clearly what this means if we consider the state\r\nof the trade at the time of his entrance. A man of peaceable and kindly\r\ninclinations, Deering was dragged into a business that was as turbulent as\r\na bull-fight. For as the reaper had evolved, it had become a bone of\r\ncontention, and it remained so from the first patent to the last. The\r\nopening battle was fought by McCormick and Hussey, each claiming to have\r\nbeen the Christopher Columbus of the business. After the gold-rush of 1849\r\nnew types of reapers sprang up on all sides. The crude machines that\r\nmerely cut the grain were driven out by others that automatically raked\r\nthe cut grain into bundles. These were soon followed by a combined reaper\r\nand mower, which held the field until the Marsh harvester was invented, as\r\nwe have seen, at the close of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nAmong these different types of reapers, and the numerous variations of\r\neach type, the bitterest rivalries prevailed. There was no pool, no\r\n\"gentlemen's agreement,\" no \"community of interest.\" Indeed, the\r\n\"harvester business\" was not business. It was a riotous game of \"Farmer,\r\nfarmer, who gets the farmer?\" The excited players cared less for the\r\nprofits than for the victories. As fast as they made money, they threw it\r\nback into the game. Mechanics became millionaires, and millionaires became\r\nmechanics. The whole trade was tense with risk and rivalry and excitement,\r\nas though it were a search for gold along the high plateaus of the Rand.\r\nAnd this in spite of the fact that, with the exception of McCormick,\r\nOsborne, and Whiteley, the men who came to be known as reaper kings were\r\nnot naturally fighters. No business men were ever gentler than Deering,\r\nGlessner, Warder, Adriance, and Huntley. But the making of reapers was a\r\nnew trade. It was like a vast, unfenced prairie, where every settler owned\r\nas much ground as he could defend.\r\n\r\nEach step ahead meant a struggle for patents. Whoever built a reaper had\r\nto defend himself in the courts as well as approve himself in the\r\nharvest-fields. Cyrus H. McCormick, especially, as William Deering soon\r\nlearned, wielded the Big Stick against every man who dared to make\r\nreapers. He was the old veteran of the trade, and he gave battle to his\r\ncompetitors as though they were a horde of trespassers. He was their\r\ncommon enemy, and the reaper money that was squandered on lawsuits brought\r\na golden era of prosperity to the lawyers.\r\n\r\nSome of these patent wars shook the country with the crash of hostile\r\nforces. The tide of battle rolled up to the Supreme Court and even into\r\nthe halls of Congress. Once, in 1855 when McCormick charged full tilt upon\r\nJohn H. Manny, who was making reapers at Rockford, Illinois, a three-year\r\nstruggle began that was the most noted legal duel of the day.\r\n\r\nMcCormick, to make sure of his victory, went into the fight with a battery\r\nof lawyers whom he thought invincible--William H. Seward, E. M. Dickerson,\r\nand Senator Reverdy Johnson. Manny made a giant effort at self-defence by\r\nhiring Abraham Lincoln, Edwin M. Stanton, Stephen A. Douglas, Peter H.\r\nWatson, George Harding, and Congressman H. Winter Davis.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last it was a lawyers' battle, and McCormick was finally\r\ndefeated by Stanton, who made an unanswerably eloquent speech. For this\r\nspeech Stanton received $10,000, and Lincoln, who had made no speech at\r\nall, was given $1,000. Yet, in the long run, the man who profited by this\r\nlawsuit was Lincoln; for it was this money that enabled him to carry on\r\nhis famous debate with Douglas, and thus made him the inevitable candidate\r\nof the Republican Party.\r\n\r\nMcCormick's most disastrous lawsuit was with D. M. Osborne and the Gordon\r\nbrothers, of Rochester. In 1875 the Gordons had invented an attachment\r\nfor a wire self-binder, and in a careless moment McCormick had signed a\r\ncontract promising to make these self-binders and to pay $10 royalty on\r\nevery machine. Then a man named Withington appeared with a much better\r\nself-binder. McCormick at once began to make the Withington machine and\r\nwas sued by the Gordons.\r\n\r\nAt this time McCormick was over seventy years of age, and crippled with\r\nrheumatism; but he believed that the Gordons had deceived him and he\r\nfought them sternly as long as he lived. After his death, his eldest son,\r\nCyrus, consented to a compromise, whereby Osborne, who was owner of a\r\nshare in the Gordon concern, and the Gordons were to be paid $225,000. But\r\nin order to impress upon them the enormity of this amount, he prepared the\r\nmoney for them in small bills. When they called at the McCormick office in\r\nChicago, they were taken to a small room on the top floor and shown a\r\ngreat pyramid of green currency.\r\n\r\n\"There is your money,\" said McCormick's lawyer. \"Kindly count it and see\r\nif it is not a quarter of a million dollars.\"\r\n\r\nThe three men gasped with mingled ecstasy and consternation. \"B--b--but,\"\r\nstammered one of them, \"how can we take it away? Can't you give us a\r\ncheque?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the right amount, in legal money, gentlemen,\" replied the lawyer.\r\n\"All I will say is that there are a couple of old valises in the\r\ncloset--and I wish you good afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nFor several hours Osborne and the Gordons literally waded in affluence,\r\ncounting the money and packing it in the valises. By the time they had\r\nfinished, it was eight o'clock. The building was dark. The elevator was\r\nnot running. They were hungry and terrified. Step by step they groped\r\ntheir trembling way downstairs, and staggered with their treasure through\r\nthe perilous streets to the Grand Pacific Hotel. None of them ever forgot\r\nthe terror of that night.\r\n\r\nAnother warlike Reaper King was \"Bill\" Whiteley, of Ohio. Whiteley had\r\ninvented a combined mower and reaper in 1858, which he named the\r\n\"Champion\"; and he pushed this machine with an irresistible enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nHis mode of attack was not the patent suit, but the field test. This was\r\nthe white-hot climax of the rivalry among the reaper kings; and it was\r\ngreat sport for the farmers. It was a reaper circus--a fierce chariot-race\r\nin a wheat-field; and its influence upon the industry was remarkable. It\r\nweeded out the low-grade machines. It spurred on the manufacturers to a\r\ncampaign of improvement. It developed American harvesters to the highest\r\npoint of perfection. It swung the farmers into the new path of scientific\r\nagriculture. And it piled expenses so high that few of the reaper kings\r\nescaped disaster.\r\n\r\nA field test was conducted in this fashion: A committee of judges was\r\nappointed, and several acres of ripe grain were selected as the\r\nbattle-field. After the field was marked off into equal sections, each\r\nreaper took its place. There were sometimes two reapers and sometimes\r\nforty. The signal was given. \"Crack\"--the horses leaped; the drivers\r\nshouted; and hundreds of farmers surged up and down in excited crowds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ASA S. BUSHNELL\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN H. WARDER\r\n\r\nHON. THOMAS MOTT OSBORNE\r\n\r\nDAVID M. OSBORNE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"All's fair in a field test,\" said the reaper agents who superintended\r\nthese contests; though each man said it to himself. They were a hardy and\r\nreckless body of men, half cowboy, half mechanic, and no trick was too\r\ndangerous or too desperate for them. Often the feud was so bitter that\r\nbodyguards of big-fisted \"bulldozers\" were on the spot to protect the\r\nwarrior of their tribe who was in danger. \"I had four men with me once who\r\ntogether weighed 1,000 pounds,\" said A. E. Mayer, who is now the general\r\nof an army of 40,000 salesmen. In most tests the machines were shamefully\r\nabused. Self-binders were made to cut and bind stubble as though it were\r\ngrain. Mowers were driven full tilt against stumps and hop-poles. Rival\r\nreapers were chained back to back and yanked apart by plunging horses. The\r\nwarrior agents exposed the weak points in each other's machines. They\r\nphotographed each other's breakdowns, and bragged to the limit of their\r\nvocabularies. They raised prices in one town and cut them in the next; for\r\nwhen their fighting blood was aroused--and that was often--they cared no\r\nmore for profits than a small boy cares for his clothes.\r\n\r\nTo give only one instance out of hundreds, here is a picture of a field\r\ntest that I found in the diary of B. B. Clarke, of Madison, who is now\r\nthe editor of the _American Thresherman_, but who was in the eighties a\r\nharvester fighter in Indiana.\r\n\r\n\"We drove fourteen miles to the wheat-field, which was also the\r\nbattle-field,\" he wrote, \"and found a heavy crop of rank grain, wild pea\r\nvines, morning glories and other vegetation, which tested both machines to\r\nthe limit. The bundles were twisted together by the vines into almost a\r\ncontinuous rope. After adjusting the machine, we had to 'open the field.'\r\nThis is considered the most severe test, as the machine, the horses and\r\nall are in the grain.\r\n\r\n\"A---- drove the team, a magnificent pair of big grays. McK---- watched\r\nthe binder, while Y---- and I created sympathy for our cause among the\r\nfarmers who had come to see the fight. With a crack of his whip and a\r\nshout to his team, A---- opened the ball. The machine was so crowded with\r\ngrain and weeds that the sickle could not be heard fifty feet away. He\r\ncleared the first round without a stop. Then the other machine followed,\r\nbut the driver, failing to recognise the necessity of fast driving,\r\nallowed his machine to clog, and lost the day. We received two hundred\r\ndollars in gold on the spot for our victorious binder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SELF-BINDER IN SCOTLAND, WITH THE WALLACE MONUMENT IN THE\r\nBACKGROUND]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On returning to Fort Wayne we found the E---- people, whose headquarters\r\nwere separated by a partition wall from ours, had coaxed one of our\r\ncustomers to cancel his order, and substitute their machine. For this act,\r\nwe retaliated and replaced three of their orders the following week, and\r\nwhile loading these into the farmers' wagons a fight took place between\r\nthe opposing factions. I looked as though I had encountered a flax-hackle.\r\nThe next day hostilities opened early with three on our side to six of the\r\nE---- host, requiring a riot alarm and a wagon-load of police to restore\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\"We had swept the enemy before us, using neck-yokes, pitman rods and even\r\nsix shooters in the grand finale. Our expense account for that week\r\nincluded fifty dollars for lawyers' fees, which was promptly O. K.'d by\r\nthe manager. After all, I had only obeyed instructions, which were to get\r\nthe business and hold up prices, 'peaceably if you can, but forcibly if\r\nyou must.'\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting relic of these fierce days of cut-throat competition was\r\ngiven to me by Mr. John F. Steward. It reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n     TO AGENTS FOR THE SALE OF HARVESTING MACHINERY:\r\n\r\n     The undersigned, manufacturers of harvesting machinery, call the\r\n     attention of their travelling experts and local agents to a practice\r\n     which has grown among them for a few years past, and which has become\r\n     so disreputable and is carried to such an extent that we feel it\r\n     necessary to bring it to your special notice. _It is the habit of\r\n     trying to break up sales made by other agents when you have not been\r\n     successful in securing the sale._ It has become a very common\r\n     practice, as soon as a sale is made by one agent, for the agents of\r\n     all other machines to try to break up that sale, by\r\n     misrepresentations or by lowering the price, or by trying to convince\r\n     the purchaser that the machine which he has bargained for is not as\r\n     good as the one which the other agent sells. This practice is\r\n     disreputable, and should not be tolerated by any manufacturer. We\r\n     wish it now thoroughly understood that we will not tolerate this\r\n     practice in any agent, and we will be glad to have reports from you\r\n     of the agents of any machines who have tried to break up your sales\r\n     of our machines in this way. There is nothing that tends more to\r\n     demoralise business than this practice, and we wish it stopped.\r\n\r\n     Machines should be sold upon their merits, and not by disparaging or\r\n     running down other machines. You will find that your customers will\r\n     place more reliance upon what you say if you leave all other machines\r\n     alone, and show the good features of your own and demonstrate them in\r\n     actual work. An agent never makes any progress by running down or\r\n     trying to show the defects of others, and you will be better able to\r\n     sustain your prices and the reputation of your machines by following\r\n     the course indicated above. Therefore, it is our wish that you should\r\n     hold to your prices firmly, present your machines in the very best\r\n     possible light, and use all honourable means for making a fair and\r\n     honest sale; but if you are unfortunate enough to lose your sale, and\r\n     some competitor gains it, don't be persuaded to put yours in the\r\n     field by the side of your competitor, or try in any way to break up\r\n     the sale; and do not, until the purchaser has discarded another\r\n     machine, offer to put one of ours in its place.\r\n\r\n     Of course we do not mean by this that you shall stand quietly by and\r\n     see other agents break up your sales, or if others habitually do this\r\n     that you shall not retaliate, but you must not be the first to\r\n     inaugurate this practice. We are always ready to meet fair and honest\r\n     competition.\r\n\r\n     We want our business conducted in a fair and honourable way, and not\r\n     descend to ways that are discreditable to us and to you. No one agent\r\n     can expect to sell all the machines that are wanted in his district,\r\n     for the poorest machine will have some friends, and, though he may\r\n     have the very best one, we do not expect he will make every one see\r\n     it. Let the purchaser take the risk. If he buys an inferior machine\r\n     he should take the consequences, as if he was deceived or mistaken in\r\n     his judgment in buying a horse. In such a case you would not think of\r\n     putting your horse in work the purchaser was doing, to show him yours\r\n     was the best, with the expectation that he would return the one he\r\n     had bought because it did not prove quite equal to yours in drawing a\r\n     load or in driving. If you would not in the case of a horse, why\r\n     should you, in the case of a mower, reaper, or self-binding\r\n     harvester? Our advice to you is:\r\n\r\n     1st. Hold firmly to your prices.\r\n\r\n     2d. Sell your own machine. Convince your purchaser that you have the\r\n     best machine made.\r\n\r\n     3d. Settle for the machine at time of delivery. A machine works much\r\n     better after being settled for.\r\n\r\n     4th. If you lose the sale do not try to break up the sale of your\r\n     competitor. It won't pay.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Signatures]\r\n\r\nThe king of the field test was William N. Whiteley. No other reaper king,\r\nin any country, received as much renown from his personal exploits. He was\r\nthe Charlemagne of the harvest-field. He was as tall as a sapling and as\r\nstrong as a tree. As a professor in the great field school of agriculture,\r\nhe has never been surpassed. He could out-talk, outwork, and generally\r\noutwit the men who were sent against him. He was a whole exhibition in\r\nhimself. \"I've seen Bill Whiteley racin' his horses through the grain and\r\nleanin' over with his long arms to pick the mice's nests from just in\r\nfront of the knife,\" said an old Ohio settler.\r\n\r\nThe feat that first made Whiteley famous was performed at Jamestown, Ohio,\r\nin 1867. His competitor was doing as good work as he was; whereupon he\r\nsprang from his seat, unhitched one horse, and finished his course with a\r\nsingle, surprised steed pulling the heavy machine. His competitor followed\r\nsuit, and succeeded fully as well. This enraged Whiteley, who at that time\r\nwas as powerful as a young Hercules.\r\n\r\n\"I can pull my reaper myself,\" he shouted, turning his second horse loose,\r\nand yoking his big shoulders into its harness. Such a thing had never\r\nbeen done before, and has never been done since; but it is true that, in\r\nthe passion of the moment, Whiteley was filled with such strength that he\r\nran the reaper from one side of the field to the other, cutting a full\r\nswath--a deed that, had he done it in ancient Greece, would have placed\r\nhim among the immortals. It was witnessed by five hundred farmers, and\r\nfully reported in the press. One of the reporters, as it happened,\r\nrepresenting the _Cincinnati Commercial_, was a young Ohioan named\r\nWhitelaw Reid, now the American Ambassador to the Court of St. James.\r\n\r\nThat ten minutes in a horse collar made $2,000,000 for Whiteley. His\r\nantagonist, Benjamin H. Warder, was filled with admiration for Whiteley's\r\nprowess, and at once proposed that they should quit fighting and work in\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the right to make your reaper and I'll pay you $5 apiece for all\r\nI can sell,\" said Warder. \"It's a bargain,\" responded Whiteley. And so\r\nthere arose the first consolidation in the harvester business.\r\n\r\nWhiteley and Warder did not merge their companies; but they divided the\r\nUnited States into three parts--one for Whiteley, one for his brother\r\nAmos, who also made reapers in Springfield, and one for Warder. They\r\nunited in building a malleable iron foundry and a knife works, so that\r\nthey could use better materials at a lower cost. They made the first\r\nhandsome and shapely machines.\r\n\r\nFor twelve years this triple alliance led the way, and all others, even\r\nthe mighty McCormick and the sagacious Deering, had to follow. The\r\n\"Champion\" reaper became the leading machine of the United States, and the\r\nlittle town of Springfield, Ohio, was known as the \"Reaper City.\" As many\r\nas 160,000 reapers and mowers were sent out as a year's work. In all,\r\n2,000,000 of Whiteley's \"Champion\" machines have been made in Springfield,\r\nand have sold at a gain of $18,000,000.\r\n\r\nAs the millions came pouring in so fast, Whiteley's head was turned and he\r\nbegan to run amuck. He cut loose from Warder and from his own partners,\r\nFassler and Kelly, opened war on the Knights of Labour, built the biggest\r\nreaper factory in the world, became a railroad president, helped to\r\ncorner the Chicago wheat market, backed the \"Strasburg Clock\"--an absurd\r\nself-binder that was as big as a pipe-organ--and came crashing down in a\r\nfailure that jarred the farming world from end to end.\r\n\r\nWhiteley lost millions in this crash--and with comparative indifference.\r\nIt was never the profits that he fought for. At heart he was a sportsman\r\nrather than a money-maker. He craved the excitement of the race itself\r\nmore than the prizes. To win--that was the ambition of his life. And he\r\ndid not shrink from spectacular methods to accomplish his ambition.\r\n\r\nFor instance, nothing less would satisfy him, when he exhibited at the\r\nPhiladelphia Centennial, than a quarter-sized reaper, made daintily of\r\nrosewood and gold. This brought him so sudden a rush of orders from the\r\nEast that in one day of the following year he sent seventy loaded cars to\r\nBaltimore. With flags flying and brass bands playing, these cars rolled\r\noff, with orders to travel only by daylight. When they arrived in\r\nHarrisburg, running in three sections, they caught the eye of a railroad\r\nsuperintendent named McCrea--who is now, by the way, president of the\r\nPennsylvania Railroad. McCrea saw a chance to advertise his railway as\r\nwell as Whiteley's reapers, so he linked the seventy cars together into\r\none three-quarter-mile train, put his biggest engine at the front, and\r\nsent the gaudy caravan on its way.\r\n\r\nWhiteley never knew how to be commonplace, even in the smallest matters.\r\nWherever he went, his trail was marked by stories of his exploits and his\r\noddities. How he organised the famous \"White Plug Hat Brigade\" in the\r\nBlaine campaign--how he made a twelve-hour speech to help \"Mother\" Stewart\r\nclose up the saloons of Springfield--how he found a Springfield farmer\r\nusing a McCormick reaper, gave him a Whiteley reaper in its place, and\r\nflung the rival machine upon the junk-pile, as a sign that he was the\r\nmonarch of Ohio--how he gathered up a peck of pies after a field test\r\ndinner, put them in a sack, and ate nothing but pies for half a week--such\r\nis the sort of anecdotes that his life has added to the folklore of the\r\nWestern farmers.\r\n\r\nMany a time his vaudeville tactics disgusted and enraged his fellow\r\nmanufacturers; but he was too big a factor to be ignored. Once, when a\r\nnumber of reaper kings had met together to see if they could rescue their\r\nbusiness from its riot of rivalry, the chairman opened the discussion with\r\nthe question--\"What ought we to do to improve the conditions of our\r\ntrade?\" For a moment there was silence, and then John P. Adriance--as\r\nmild-natured a man as ever lived--said blandly, \"Kill Whiteley.\"\r\n\r\nWith daring originality Whiteley combined a tremendous physical vitality\r\nand a brain that fairly effervesced with inventiveness. He probably holds\r\nthe record among the reaper-men for inventions, with 125 patents in his\r\nname. And he would work twenty-four hours at a stretch, without a yawn.\r\nOne evening he asked a young machinist to remain in the factory and help\r\nhim fix a refractory reaper. After working till midnight Whiteley said:\r\n\"Well, Jim, I suppose you think you are tired. Go home and have a good\r\nnight's sleep, and come back here in three hours.\"\r\n\r\nHe dashed with fanatical energy into any undertaking that appealed to his\r\nimagination. Once, when he had too much money, he bought control of a new\r\nrailway that ran through Ohio from Springfield to Jackson,--160 miles. He\r\nwanted to know its real value, so, instead of asking the directors a few\r\nquestions, as other men would have done, Whiteley travelled over the\r\nentire length of the railroad, _on foot_.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Whiteley, last June, he was time-worn and whitened. Since the\r\ngreat failure, he has been in the harvester business only intermittently.\r\nHe has long outlived his Golden Age, but he is as busy as ever, with a new\r\nscheme and a new factory. And he still wears the Scotch cap and long boots\r\nthat have been familiar at field tests for more than half a century.\r\n\r\nOf the other Springfield men, Warder was unquestionably the ablest. \"He\r\nwas the main wheel,\" said Whiteley. As a young man of twenty-seven he was\r\nrunning a sawmill in Springfield when he first heard of the reaper. He was\r\nso impressed with its possibilities that he offered the inventor $30,000\r\nfor a share in it.\r\n\r\n\"Young Warder is crazy,\" said Springfield people, for at that time $30,000\r\nwas a fortune and a reaper was a fad. But thirty-five years later, when\r\nWarder had removed to Washington and become noted among its social\r\nentertainers, his investment had multiplied itself very nearly two\r\nhundredfold.\r\n\r\nWarder had associated with him two partners, Asa S. Bushnell and J. J.\r\nGlessner. Bushnell began earning his living in boyhood as a clerk at $5 a\r\nmonth, and stumbled into a business career as a druggist. Then he became\r\nWarder's understudy, and piled up twice as many millions as he could count\r\non his fingers. As a climax he rose higher in public life than any other\r\nreaper king, by serving twice as the Governor of Ohio. As for J. J.\r\nGlessner, he is still active, and one of the dozen solid pillars upon\r\nwhich the International Harvester Company is built.\r\n\r\nSuch were the strong men whom William Deering faced when he came, without\r\na shred of experience, into the harvester world. He had no ancient\r\npatent-rights, like McCormick. He could not outrace thirty competitors in\r\na wheat-field, like Whiteley and Jones and Adriance and Osborne. One way\r\nwas left open to him.\r\n\r\n\"I'll beat them,\" he said, \"by making a better machine.\"\r\n\r\nHe set out upon such a search for improvements that, during the rest of\r\nhis life, inventors fluttered around him like moths around a candle. Until\r\n1879, the best harvester was a self-binder that tied the sheaves with\r\nwire. It was the invention of Sylvanus D. Locke, and had been developed to\r\nits highest point of perfection by a farm-bred inventor named C. B.\r\nWithington, who is still living in Wisconsin. The Withington machine was\r\npushed by McCormick with great energy, and fifty thousand were sold\r\nbetween 1877 and 1885. It was a marvelously simple mechanism, consisting\r\nmainly of two steel fingers that moved back and forth, and twisted a wire\r\nband around each sheaf of grain. As a machine it was a complete success;\r\nbut the farmers disliked it.\r\n\r\n\"The wire will mix with the straw,\" they said, \"and our horses and cattle\r\nwill be killed.\"\r\n\r\nSo, when Deering met John F. Appleby, a stocky mechanic who claimed to\r\nhave invented a twine self-binder, he at once set him to work upon fifty\r\nof the new machines.\r\n\r\nWhen Deering saw his first Appleby binder at work in a field of wheat, he\r\nwas enthralled. Here, at last, was the perfect harvester. Its strong\r\nsteel arms could flash a cord around a bundle of grain, tie a knot, cut\r\nthe cord, and fling off the sheaf, too quickly for the eye to follow. It\r\nseemed magical.\r\n\r\n\"What am I to do?\" asked the farmer who bought the first of these\r\nmachines, as he climbed upon the seat and prepared to cut his grain.\r\n\r\n\"Do!\" exclaimed John Webster, the Deering mechanic. \"Do nothing! DRIVE THE\r\nHORSES.\"\r\n\r\nThe amazed farmer started the horses, drove around the field, and came\r\nback swinging his hat and shouting like a lunatic--as well he might. For\r\nin the trail of his harvester the sheaves lay bound, as though there were\r\nsome kindly genie hidden among its wheels.\r\n\r\nDeering owned, at that time, not much more than a million dollars--the\r\ngleanings of thirty-five industrious years. But he resolved to stake it\r\nall upon this amazing machine. If he lost--he would be a poor man at\r\nfifty-three. If he won--he would be the harvester king of the world.\r\n\r\n\"I'll move the factory to Chicago and make 3,000 of these Appleby\r\ntwine-binders at once,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHis partner, E. H. Gammon, held back, so the inflexible Deering bought him\r\nout, and from that day he, like his greatest competitor, McCormick, ran a\r\none-man business.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear the news about Deering?\" gossiped his fellow manufacturers.\r\n\"Clean crazy on a twine-binder!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, far more discouraging, the magical self-binder itself suddenly became\r\nill-humored and refused to form its sheaves properly. It was no easy\r\nexploit, as any one may see, to make the first 3,000 of such complex\r\nmachines. No other artificial mechanism must so combine strength and\r\ndelicacy. No piano nor Hoe press, for instance, is expected to operate\r\nwhile it is being jerked over a rough field or along the steep slant of a\r\nhill.\r\n\r\nOne day in the early spring of 1880, Deering and his chief\r\nlieutenants--Steward and Dixon--were in a field of rye near Alton, trying\r\nto coax the new harvester to do its work. All day long it was obstinate\r\nand perverse, and the men were at their wits' end.\r\n\r\n\"Well, boys,\" said Deering, \"if we can't do better than this, I'll lose\r\n$1,000,000.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try one more day,\" said Steward. They went to their hotel, and as it\r\nhappened to be crowded, the three were placed in a large double room.\r\n\r\n\"Steward and Dixon were mad at me the next morning,\" said Deering, when he\r\ntold me of that critical occasion. \"They had nothing at stake, yet they\r\nhad lain awake all night; while I was apparently about to lose my only\r\nmillion, and had slept like a log.\"\r\n\r\nThat day a slight change was made, and the harvester became good-natured\r\nand obedient. The whole 3,000 machines were sold, and created as much\r\nexcitement as 3,000 miracles. They swept away competitors like chaff. Of a\r\nhundred manufacturers seventy-eight were winnowed out. Instead of losing\r\nhis fortune, Deering cleared at once about four hundred thousand dollars,\r\nfor profits were large in those experimental days. Better still, he became\r\nan acknowledged leader of his class. He had taken the right line of\r\ndevelopment, as McCormick had in 1831, and all others who could, choked\r\ndown their rage and followed--quick march!\r\n\r\nThe man who had found the right path was John F. Appleby. He was the\r\nscout--the Kit Carson of the harvester business. It was he--the inspired\r\nfarm labourer of Wisconsin--who had hurled another great impossibility out\r\nof the way of the world's farmers.\r\n\r\nHe did not of course originate the whole self-binder. But he put the parts\r\ntogether in the right way and pushed ahead to success through a wilderness\r\nof failure. There was a notable group of inventors in Rockford who did\r\nmuch to put him on the right track. One of these, Marquis L. Gorham, was\r\nthe originator of the self-sizing device that regulates the size of the\r\nbound sheaf. Another, named Jacob Behel, invented a knotter, whittling it\r\nout of a branch of a cherry tree.\r\n\r\nAppleby has been, and is yet, a knight-errant of industry. He takes his\r\npay in adventure. He dislikes to travel with the crowd. When I saw him\r\nfirst, in his Chicago workshop, his thoughts were far from twine-binders.\r\nHe was engaged on the task of perfecting a cotton-picker, which he hopes\r\nwill do as much for the South as his self-binder did for the West. And it\r\nwas with some difficulty that I could persuade him to disentangle the\r\nstory of the twine-binder from the various other romances of his life.\r\n\r\nIn 1855 Appleby was a rugged youngster doing chores on a farm for one\r\ndollar a week. Even this rate of pay was too high to the mind of the\r\nfarmer who employed him; for he was always whittling and making toy\r\nmachinery, instead of minding his work.\r\n\r\nOne day, when Appleby was seventeen, he was binding grain after a reaper.\r\n\"How do you like the work, Jack?\" asked the farmer.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like it,\" said Jack, \"and what's more, I believe I can invent a\r\nmachine to tie these bundles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho!\" laughed the farmer. \"You little fool, you can't invent\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years later, when Appleby had made half a million by his\r\ninvention, and was manager of a factory at Minneapolis, he noticed an old\r\nman pushing a wheelbarrow in the factory yard.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't I seen you before?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied the old man. \"I was the farmer who gave you your first\r\njob.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Appleby, \"you see I wasn't a little fool after all.\"\r\n\r\nAppleby actually had set to work to invent a knotting-machine when he was\r\na farm-boy of seventeen, and had made his first model at that age--in\r\n1858. A young school-teacher named Chester W. Houghton was the first man\r\nwho put money back of the boy's invention. He stood behind it to the\r\nextent of fifty dollars, and then became alarmed at such a reckless\r\nspeculation, and quit. Had he been just a little more adventurous, and a\r\nlittle more patient, every dollar of his investment would have fruited\r\ninto a thousand.\r\n\r\nWhen the school-teacher deserted him, and wanted the fifty dollars back,\r\nAppleby was discouraged. The models that had been made at a gun shop in\r\nPalmyra, Wisconsin, drifted about. They were sold at auction on one\r\noccasion for seventeen cents; and the buyer thought they were not worth\r\neven that, for he made a present of them to Appleby. Then came the crash\r\nof the Civil War. Appleby enlisted, and for four years forgot knotters and\r\nthought only of guns.\r\n\r\nYet while he lay in the trenches at Vicksburg, he whittled out a new\r\ndevice for rifles. After the war, a capitalist saw this device, gave him\r\n$500 for it, and then, before Appleby's eyes, sold a half interest in it\r\nfor $7,000. This awakened Appleby to the value of inventions and made him\r\nan inventor for life.\r\n\r\nOnce more he set to work on his long-neglected grain-binder, and in 1867\r\nhe drove his first completed machine into a field near Mazomanie,\r\nWisconsin. The horses were fractious, and after being jerked along for\r\nseveral rods, the machine broke down, to the great delight of the\r\nspectators, most of whom knew Appleby and regarded him as a crank. But the\r\nmachine had bound a couple of sheaves before it broke. Appleby displayed\r\nthese, and one man--Dr. E. D. Bishop--pulled a roll of money from his\r\npocket and handed it to the inventor.\r\n\r\n\"Take this,\" he said, \"and make me a partner. Your invention will be a\r\nworld's wonder some day.\"\r\n\r\nAll told, Dr. Bishop staked $1,500 on Appleby's genius, for which, twelve\r\nyears later, he drew out $80,000. This was the first of the many\r\nincidental fortunes scattered right and left in the path of the\r\nself-binder, which began in 1880, to sweep forward as gloriously as the\r\ntriumphal car of a Roman emperor.\r\n\r\nAs for William Deering--the modest manufacturer from Maine, who in 1879\r\njoined forces with Appleby, no sooner had he sold the 3,000 self-binders\r\nthan he found himself floundering neck deep in an unexpected sea of\r\ntroubles. There was not a flaw in the binders. They were cutting and tying\r\nthe grain with the skill of 60,000 men. But the twine-bill! Three thousand\r\nfarmers swore that it was too high.\r\n\r\nTwine was an item that they had never in their lives bought in large\r\nquantities. To pay fifty dollars--the price of a horse--for mere string\r\nthat was used once and then flung away, seemed outrageous. It was like\r\nbuying daily papers by the thousand, or shoe-laces by the ton. And so it\r\ncame about that though Deering had reduced the cost of wheat ten per\r\ncent., he got little thanks for his superb machines--nothing but a loud\r\nand angry roar for better and cheaper twine.\r\n\r\nDeering moved against this new array of difficulties with quiet and\r\ninexorable persistence. There were only three binder-twine makers in the\r\nUnited States, and all warned him that he was pursuing a will-o'-the-wisp.\r\nBut Deering pushed on until he met Edwin H. Fitler, afterward a mayor of\r\nPhiladelphia. From the unassuming way in which Deering stated his needs,\r\nFitler concluded that the order would be a small one.\r\n\r\n\"What you want,\" he said, \"is a single strand twine, which cannot be made\r\nwithout a new line of machinery. I regret to say that I cannot afford to\r\ndo this for one customer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Deering, \"I think I may need a good deal in the long run,\r\nthough I wish to begin with not more than ten car-loads.\"\r\n\r\nTen car-loads! For a moment Fitler was dazed, but only for a moment. It\r\nwas his chance and he knew it. Years afterward, he was fond of telling how\r\nhe \"made a million-dollar deal with William Deering in two minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThus, whatever Deering touched, he improved. He became the servant of the\r\nharvester. He lavished fortunes upon it as sporting millionaires spent\r\nfortunes on their horses. It was his one extravagance. In his later\r\nendeavours to make the twine cheaper, he spent $15,000 on grass twine,\r\n$35,000 on paper, $43,000 on straw, and failed. Then he spent $165,000 on\r\nflax and succeeded. He was for thirty years a sort of paymaster to a small\r\nmob of inventors who had new ideas or who thought they had. There was one\r\nvery able inventor--John Stone--who actually drew his salary and expenses\r\nevery week for twenty years, until he had perfected a corn-picking\r\nmachine. From first to last, Deering spent \"perhaps more than two millions\r\nof dollars\" on improvements, according to one of his closest friends.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the Appleby binder had transformed Deering from a man in\r\nbusiness simply to make money, into an enthusiast. While he remained as\r\ncareful of the business as ever, he began to enjoy the work itself more\r\nthan the profit. He would still fuss if he saw half a dozen nails in the\r\nsweepings, or any other waste of pennies. But he poured the golden flood\r\nof profits back into his factory with a recklessness that amazed his\r\nfriends. He pampered his beloved machines with roller bearings and bodies\r\nof steel. He sent them to Europe and showed them to kings. Then, as his\r\nenthusiasm grew, he looked ahead to the time when even the farm-horse\r\nshall be set free from drudgery; and he began to build automobile mowers\r\nand gasolene engines. In fact, he ripened, as he worked, into a seer who\r\nsaw far past the gain or loss of the present into the splendour of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CYRUS HALL McCORMICK, JR.\r\n\r\nCHARLES DEERING Photo by Matzene, Chicago]\r\n\r\n\r\nSagacity--that is, perhaps, the one word that best explains William\r\nDeering's success. He had an almost supernatural instinct, so his\r\ncompetitors believed, which kept him in the right line of progress. There\r\nseemed to be a business compass in his brain.\r\n\r\nHe was never a master of men, like McCormick, nor a good mixer among men,\r\nlike Whiteley; but as an organiser of men he was easily superior to them\r\nboth. He knew how to pit his managers one against another, as Carnegie\r\ndid; and how to develop a factory into a swift and automatic machine. He\r\nwas a statesman of commercialism. He piled up a big fortune, and earned\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was his misfortune not to have been schooled on a farm, as were most of\r\nthe great reaper kings. McCormick, Whiteley, Lewis Miller, Morgan,\r\nJohnson, Osborne, Sieberling, Jones, Esterley, and the Marshes were all\r\nfarm-bred. But Deering was shrewd enough to gather around him a corps of\r\nmen who had the experience that he lacked. At the head of this bodyguard\r\nstood a farmer's son--John F. Steward. Such were the versatility and the\r\nloyalty of Steward that he became Deering's Grand Vizier. He was\r\ninventive, combative, literary, mechanical, litigious. It is now forty-two\r\nyears since Steward began to build harvesters; and he has ten dozen\r\npatents to his credit.\r\n\r\nSo, what with the mature business experience of Deering himself, and the\r\nskill and faithfulness of his captains, the little factory that he had\r\nbegun to manage in 1872 expanded in thirty years into one of the two\r\ngreatest harvester plants in the world, rolling out in every workday\r\nminute two complete machines and thirty miles of twine.\r\n\r\nLargely because of his enterprise the spectres of Famine are now beaten\r\nback in fifty countries, yet there is not a word of self-praise in his\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n\"A man told me once that I was nothing more than a promoter,\" he said;\r\n\"and perhaps he was right. I wasn't an inventor, that's true. All I did\r\nwas to get the right men and tell them what I wanted them to do; so I\r\nsuppose I was just a promoter.\"\r\n\r\nThe few anecdotes that are told of him relate chiefly to his overmodesty.\r\nOnce, when he was travelling through Kansas with John Webster, one of his\r\ntrusty men, a big Westerner loomed up in front of him and said:\r\n\r\n\"Are you the Deering that makes the self-binders?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Deering, blushing as red as one of his own mowers.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Westerner, shaking him by the hand, \"I want to say that\r\nyou're a mighty smart man.\"\r\n\r\nDeering looked thoroughly uncomfortable, and when the stranger had gone,\r\nhe leaned over to Webster and said:\r\n\r\n\"Think of him saying that I made the binders when I pay you fellows for\r\nmaking them. I never felt so foolish in my life.\"\r\n\r\nHe is now eighty-one--older than our oldest railroad. In his lifetime he\r\nhas seen his country grow seven times in population and twenty-four times\r\nin wealth.\r\n\r\nHe and his fellows have undeniably doubled the food supply of the world.\r\nMore--they said, \"Presto, change!\" and the drudges of the harvest-fields\r\nstood up and became men. They have made life easier and nobler for untold\r\nmyriads of people, and have led the way to the brightest era of peace and\r\nplenty that the hunger-bitten human race has ever known.\r\n\r\nYet less than thirty of the reaper kings became millionaires. Not one can\r\nstand beside the great financiers of steel and real estate and railroads.\r\nAnd not one, in his whole lifetime, piled up as much profit as a Carnegie\r\nor a Rockefeller has made in a single year.\r\n\r\nThe get-rich-quick brigands of Wall Street meddled with the harvester\r\nbusiness once--and never again. That was twenty-one years ago, when the\r\nfamous \"Binder-Twine Trust\" set out with the black flag flying. It was a\r\nskyrocket enterprise. James R. Keene bulled the stock up to 136. This was\r\nthe first and only \"easy money\" that was ever made in the harvester world.\r\nThen the farmers and the reaper kings rose up together and smote the Trust\r\nin twenty legislatures. Its stock became waste paper; and in the\r\nfinancial hurricane of 1893, it was the first victim.\r\n\r\nNo other business shows so tragic a death roll. For fifty years its trail\r\nwas marked by wreckage and disaster. Most of the few who succeeded at\r\nfirst, failed later. Out of every ten who plunged into the scrimmage, nine\r\ncrawled out whipped or terrified.\r\n\r\nAnd so the Romance of the Reaper was for fifty years a tragedy of\r\ncompetition. _Out of more than two hundred harvester companies, only\r\nfourteen survived in 1902; and these realised that if such waste and\r\nwarfare continued, their business would be destroyed._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\nFor fifty years the Harvester Kings fought one another in the open field\r\nof competition. Their armies of agents, drilled in the arts of rivalry,\r\nwaged a war in which quarter was neither given nor sought. It was a fight\r\nalmost of extermination. Out of two hundred companies that went to battle\r\nwith flags waving and drums beating, less than a dozen came home.\r\n\r\nDavid M. Osborne backed a new self-binder, lost a million, and died of\r\nheartbreak. J. S. Morgan, who had a small factory at Brockport, saw the\r\nimmense McCormick and Deering plants and quit. Even the great Whiteley\r\nfell, and Lewis Miller, the father-in-law of Edison and the founder of\r\nChautauqua, went down \"like a great tree upon the hills.\"\r\n\r\nWalter A. Wood, after forty years of success, took Governor Merriam and\r\nJames J. Hill as partners, and set out to win the West for the Wood\r\nCompany. Their factory was the pride of St. Paul. Their credit was the\r\nbest, and their fame was over all the prairies. Yet after five years of\r\nbattling they surrendered; and not one harvester is made to-day west of\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nIt is a common opinion among harvester men that from first to last there\r\nhas been more money put into the business than has ever been taken out--so\r\nenormously wasteful were these years of competition. By 1902 the harvester\r\nbusiness was merely a terrific and destructive war. The agents were\r\ntearing the whole industry to shreds and tatters. So far as the Harvester\r\nMen could see, they must choose between combination and ruin.\r\n\r\nNot one of them was personally in favour of combination. They were\r\nindividualists through and through. The spirit of competition had been\r\nbred in the bone. So, when several of them came together to check this\r\nwarfare, it was not of their own free will. It was because they could do\r\nnothing else. They were hurled together by social forces over which they\r\nhad no control.\r\n\r\nOne by one these battle-worn Westerners came to New York, \"on an exploring\r\nexpedition,\" as one of them said. Here they met Judge Elbert H. Gary, whom\r\nthey had known intimately in Chicago. Gary had been William Deering's\r\nattorney for twenty-five years. He was a farmer's son, and had risen to be\r\nthe official head of the Steel Trust; so that he was the one man who had\r\nan expert knowledge at once of farms, harvesters, and mergers. And\r\nnaturally, when the Chicagoans ran to Gary with their tales of woe, he\r\nbrought them across Broadway into the office of J. P. Morgan, which had\r\nbecome in 1902 a sort of Tribunal of Industrial Peace.\r\n\r\nThere were four of them--Cyrus H. McCormick, Charles Deering, J. J.\r\nGlessner, and W. H. Jones--and all of them added to the strong preference\r\nfor competition a definite opposition to trusts, monopolies, and stock\r\nspeculation. They were not the Wall Street type of millionaire. In that\r\ntime of booming optimism, they might have made more money in one year by\r\nselling stock than they had made in thirty years by selling harvesters.\r\nBut no one of them had tried it. The fact is that they cared more for\r\nthe good-will of the farmers and the prestige of their machines than they\r\ndid for larger profits. The thing that troubled them most in the proposed\r\nconsolidation of properties, one of the Morgan partners told me, was the\r\nfear that prices would in any case have to be raised, because of the\r\nincreasing cost of labour and raw materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAROLD McCORMICK Photo by Matzene, Chicago, 1905\r\n\r\nJ. J. GLESSNER\r\n\r\nW. H. JONES Photo by Smith, Evanston, Ill.\r\n\r\nJAMES DEERING Photo by Dyer, Chicago]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the financiers who undertook to organise them were driven\r\nalmost to distraction by their obstinate independence. They had as many\r\ncontradictory opinions as a Russian Duma; and it was soon clear that the\r\nonly possible way to proceed was to keep them apart until all possible\r\npreliminaries were arranged.\r\n\r\nSo the four Harvester Men went back home until the details of the new\r\ncombination should be worked out. Then they were summoned again to New\r\nYork. As was their custom, they went to different hotels, and each man was\r\nhandled separately until he was in an organisable frame of mind. This\r\nmaster-stroke of diplomacy was accomplished by George W. Perkins--Morgan's\r\nmost versatile partner; and it gave Perkins a day and a night that he\r\nwill never forget. From morning until midnight--from midnight until the\r\nfirst ray of dawn slanted down Broadway, Perkins dashed from hotel to\r\nhotel like a human shuttle. Deering conceded one point if McCormick would\r\nconcede another. Glessner yielded one of his claims, and Jones withdrew\r\nsomething else. Inch by inch these stubborn men were pushed within tying\r\ndistance of each other; and the fifty-year harvester war was about to come\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nThe next day Perkins renewed the struggle, but he was too tired to\r\ncontinue the cab driving between hotels. He telephoned the four Harvester\r\nMen to meet him at Morgan's office. As each man climbed up the rusty iron\r\nsteps of the Morgan Building he was switched by the big Irish doorkeeper\r\ninto one of those large inner rooms at the rear, on the ground floor,\r\nwhere many a broken business has been mended. Four men in four rooms, with\r\nPerkins flying in and out--such was the way that the great harvester\r\ncompany was finished. It was a unique situation, as much like an incident\r\nin comic opera as an affair of business. But the Morgan experts knew that\r\nif the four men were allowed to meet, the old hurtful rivalries would\r\nbreak out afresh and the project might snap off like a broken dream.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen the new company with a big surplus of ready money, a\r\none-sixth interest was sold for twenty millions to Morgan and several\r\nother New York financiers of the \"old reliable\" sort. Also, a fifth\r\nharvester company, in Milwaukee, was bought from Stephen Bull for about\r\nfive millions. And when the last rivet had been clinched and the last nail\r\ndriven home, the four Westerners suddenly found themselves sitting around\r\nthe same table, in the new International Harvester Company, of Chicago.\r\n\r\nThere were several harvester companies that remained independent, but\r\nprobably not from choice. I do not know of one that has not, at some stage\r\nof its career, tried to get into a trust. Fifteen companies were merged by\r\nColonel Conger in 1892, but they were poorly fastened together and soon\r\nfell apart. It is also a fact, though one not before made public, that the\r\nMutual Life Insurance Company tried to form a second Harvester Combine in\r\n1903, with four large manufacturing companies in the merger, and under the\r\npresidency of E. D. Metcalf, of Auburn, New York. When this project\r\nfailed, three independent companies--two in New York and one in Canada,\r\noffered themselves for sale to the Harvester Company. It bought one--the\r\nOsborne--for six millions, and refused the others.\r\n\r\n\"We are big enough now,\" said Cyrus H. McCormick. \"It is not safe for one\r\ncompany to have a monopoly. What we want to do is to regulate competition,\r\nnot to destroy it.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the big Osborne Company, which is now the third largest in the\r\ncombine, the Harvester Company has bought five smaller concerns, and built\r\ntwo new plants--one in Canada and one in Sweden. It is like the original\r\nUnited States--a union of thirteen industrial colonies. Its output has\r\nrisen to 700,000 harvesting machines a year, including all varieties; and\r\nits annual revenue is more than seventy-three million dollars.\r\n\r\nWith its 25,000 employees and 42,000 agents, this one company is\r\nsupporting as many families as there are in Utah or Montana. A square\r\nmile of land would be too small to contain its factories. At its hundred\r\nwarehouses there is trackage for 12,000 cars. Around its workshops are six\r\nbusy railways of its own, whose engines last year pulled out 65,000\r\nfreight-cars, jammed full of machinery for the farmers of the world.\r\n\r\nIts properties are so widespread that no member of the company has seen\r\nthem all. To run around their circle would be a trip of 15,000 miles. It\r\nowns 20,000 acres of coal lands in Kentucky, 100,000 acres of trees in\r\nArkansas, Mississippi, and Missouri, and 40,000,000 tons of ore in the\r\nWisconsin and Mesaba Ranges. It has staked its money--$120,000,000--upon\r\nthe belief that for fifty years longer, at least, the scientists will find\r\nno substitute for bread.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Elbert H. Gary, the official head of the Steel Trust, is one\r\nof its directors, has not prevented this self-sufficient company from\r\nowning a complete steel plant, where 2,000 Hungarians make iron from ore,\r\nand steel from iron. It saws its trees into lumber in Missouri, and roasts\r\nits coal into coke in Kentucky. Its domains are so extensive, in fact,\r\nthat if they were contiguous, they would make a Harvester City as\r\nspacious as Greater Chicago.\r\n\r\nBut the most surprising feature of this unique corporation, to one who\r\nsees it for the first time, is the distracting variety of things that pour\r\nout of its factories. Its business is by no means to make harvesters and\r\nnothing else. Its true character seems to be that of a manufacturing\r\ndepartment store for farmers. As a matter of actual count, I found in its\r\nfactories and warehouses thirty-seven different species of machines,\r\nbesides all manner of variations of each sort.\r\n\r\nHere you will see, not only a mower to cut the grass, but a tedder (a kind\r\nof steel mule, with an incurably bad temper) to kick and scatter the\r\nnew-mown hay, so that it will dry in the sun; a rake to gather it\r\ntogether; a loader to swing it on the wagon; and a baler to compress it\r\ninto bundles.\r\n\r\nHere are the self-binders, not for the grain only, but for corn and rice\r\nas well. For the especial benefit of King Corn, whose tribute to this\r\nRepublic has lately swollen to twelve hundred millions a year, the company\r\nis making machines that pluck the corn from the stalk with iron hands,\r\nand others that wrench off the husks, shell the corn, and grind it into\r\nseveral varieties of breakfast food for the four-footed boarders of the\r\nfarm.\r\n\r\nHere is a new machine, much less elegant than useful, for flinging manure\r\nover a field. Barefooted women did this work in the old brutal days of\r\nhand labour. But now, thanks to the brain of a canny Canadian farmer,\r\nJoseph S. Kemp, one worker can feed the hungry fields without so much as\r\nsoiling the tips of the fingers.\r\n\r\nThe farmer's wife--and there are 10,000,000 of her in the United States,\r\nhas been the last one to be considered, in this outpouring of machinery.\r\nBut I found at Milwaukee a rebuilt factory belonging to the International,\r\nwhere 2,500 men are making fifty cream separators and 100 gasolene engines\r\na day, both designed to make life easier for Mrs. Farmer, as well as for\r\nher husband. Also, it will please her to know that she may soon be honking\r\nher way to town in an automobile buggy, which the big corporation is\r\nmaking for farmers in a new factory in Akron.\r\n\r\nA harvester company must follow the whims of its customers, almost as much\r\nas though it had newspapers for sale. It must give 10,000,000 farmers what\r\nthey want. At the Plano factory I saw 470 different varieties of wheels;\r\nand sixty-one kinds of wooden tongues at McCormick's.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could be simpler than a tongue,\" said Maurice Kane, the chief\r\nmechanical expert of the International. \"It is a mere pole. If we suited\r\nourselves, we should only make two kinds--one for horses and one for oxen.\r\nBut the farmers of the world have sixty-one different ideas as to how a\r\ntongue ought to be made, and we must give them what they ask for.\"\r\n\r\nThe last Minnesota Legislature, in the simplicity of its heart, proposed\r\nto establish a complete harvester plant for $200,000. It may surprise the\r\nmembers of that Legislature to know that the International has lately\r\nspent twice as much merely to improve one twine factory in St. Paul, and\r\nfour times as much to build one warehouse in Chicago. Though it began its\r\ncareer with sixty million dollars' worth of equipment, it has been forced\r\nby the pressure of its trade to spend sixteen millions more on its\r\nfactories. And for lack of a weather prophet, it is obliged to carry over\r\nfrom five to six million dollars worth of machines each year, which remain\r\nunsold in different countries.\r\n\r\nBy its very nature, this industry cannot be carried on in a small way. It\r\nis as essentially mutual and coöperative as life insurance or banking. If\r\na malicious \"green bug\" devours the wheat in Kansas, the loss must be made\r\nup by larger sales somewhere else. This, no doubt, is the main reason why\r\nevery plant that was ever built to supply a local trade has failed.\r\n\r\nNo other manufacturing business carries so many risks or includes so many\r\nfactors. It is the most comprehensive industry in the world. It is the\r\nlink between the city and the farm. It is both wholesale and retail,\r\nready-made and made to order, local and international. It must make what\r\nthe farmer demands, and yet teach him better methods. It is at once a\r\nfactory, a bank and a university.\r\n\r\nThus, of necessity, the Harvester Company represents in the highest degree\r\nthe new American way of manufacturing: everything on a large scale,\r\nelaborate machinery, unskilled workmen, and a vast surplus to drive it\r\npast failures and misfortunes. From its ore mines in the Mesaba Range,\r\nwhere I saw a steam-shovel heap a fifty ton railroad car in ten swings, to\r\nthe lumber yard of the McCormick Works, where 26,000,000 feet of hardwood\r\nare seasoning in the sooty rays of the Chicago sun, it was a panorama of\r\nbig production.\r\n\r\n\"How many castings did your men make last year?\" I asked of the hustling\r\nIrish-American who rules over one of the McCormick foundries.\r\n\r\n\"Very nearly 44,000,000, sir,\" he replied. \"And the gray iron foundry over\r\nthere uses three times as much iron as we do, and it made more than\r\n12,000,000.\"\r\n\r\nFifty-six million castings! Merely to count these would take the whole\r\nMinnesota Legislature sixteen days, even though every member worked eight\r\nhours a day and counted sixty castings a minute. Far, far behind are the\r\nsimple, old-fashioned days, when a reaping tool was made of two\r\npieces--the handle and the blade. There are now 300 parts in a\r\nhorse-rake, 600 in a mower, 3,800 in a binder.\r\n\r\nWhen McCormick built his first hundred reapers in 1845, he paid four and a\r\nhalf cents for bolts. That was in the mythical age of hand labour. To-day\r\nfifty bolts are made for a cent. So with guard-fingers. McCormick paid\r\ntwenty-four cents each when James K. Polk was in the White House. Now\r\nthere is a ferocious machine, which, with the least possible assistance\r\nfrom one man, cuts out 1,300 guard-fingers in ten hours, at a labour-cost\r\nof six for a cent.\r\n\r\nAlso, while exploring one of the Chicago factories, I came upon a herd of\r\ncud-chewing machines that were crunching out chain-links at the rate of\r\n56,000,000 a year. Nearby were four smaller and more irritable automata,\r\nwhich were biting off pieces of wire and chewing them into linchpins at a\r\nspeed of 400,000 bites a day.\r\n\r\n\"Take out your watch and time this man,\" said Superintendent Brooks of the\r\nMcCormick plant. \"See how long he is in boring five holes in that great\r\ncasting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly six minutes,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's progress,\" observed Brooks. \"Before we bought that machine,\r\nit was a matter of four hours to bore those holes.\"\r\n\r\nIn the immense carpenter shop he pointed to another machine. \"There is one\r\nof the reasons,\" he said, \"why the small factories have been wiped out.\r\nThat machine cost us $2,500. Its work is to shape poles, and it saves us a\r\npenny a pole; that is profitable to us because we use 300,000 poles a\r\nyear.\"\r\n\r\nIn one of its five twine mills--a monstrous Bedlam of noise and fuzz,\r\nwhich is by far the largest of its sort in the world--there is enough\r\ntwine twisted in a single day to make a girdle around the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the paint shop the man with the brush has been superseded--a case of\r\ndownright trade suicide. In his place is an unskilled Hungarian with a big\r\ntank of paint. Souse! Into the tank goes the whole frame of a binder, and\r\nthe swarthy descendant of Attilla thinks himself slow if he dips less than\r\nfour hundred of these in a day. The labour-cost of painting wheels is now\r\none-fifth of a cent each. Ten at once, on a wooden axle, are swung into\r\nthe paint bath without the touch of a finger. And the few belated\r\nbrush-men who are left work with frantic haste, knowing that they, too,\r\nare being pursued by a machine that will overtake them some day.\r\n\r\nIn the central bookkeeping office of the Harvester Company I found some\r\nalmost incredible statistics. Here, for instance, are a few of the items\r\nin last year's bill of expenses:\r\n\r\nTwo hundred and thirty-five miles of leather belting, 940 miles of cotton\r\nduck, 2,000 grindstones, 3,000 shovels, 10,000 brooms, 1,670,000 buckles,\r\n1,185,000 pounds paint, 4,000,000 pounds wire, 15,000,000 pounds nails.\r\n\r\nMerely to maintain its experimental department costs this imperial company\r\n$7,000 a week. Here are more than two hundred inventors and designers,\r\nwell housed and well salaried, and not tramping from shop to shop, as\r\ninventors did in the good old days. They are paid to think; and the\r\ncompany is mightily proud of them. But the truth is that all large\r\ncorporations which employ an army of unskilled workmen are being compelled\r\nto offset so much mere muscle by a special department of brains.\r\n\r\nThere is, besides, a most elaborate system of inspection. In the Deering\r\nfactory I saw a squad of ten men who were testing the newly made binders\r\nwith straw. \"About three out of a hundred need fixing,\" said the foreman.\r\n\r\nThe chains are tested by a violent pneumatic machine. Every link, even, is\r\nbranded with a private mark--[triangle]. And in the Hamilton plant a new\r\nscheme is being tried--the whole packing gang has become a staff of\r\ninspection. Whenever a man finds a hundred defective pieces, he gets an\r\nextra dollar. One sharp-eyed Scot in the packing-room confided to me that\r\nhe had made \"as high as two shillin's a week.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the scope of the International Harvester Company, created in 1902.\r\nAs to the men who control it, I have had the greatest difficulty in\r\npenetrating back of the business to their personal characteristics. For\r\nthey dislike the fierce light that beats upon a rich American.\r\n\r\nOf its president, Cyrus H. McCormick the Second, the first word to be said\r\nis that he is not built on the same lines as his belligerent father. He\r\nwould fare badly, very likely, if he were in charge of a\r\ncatch-as-catch-can business, such as the reaper trade was thirty years\r\nago. The making of harvesters is, to him, half a duty--to his father, his\r\nworkmen, and the machine itself--and half a profession--not a battle nor a\r\ngame, as it was with the first Reaper Kings. He has no desire to play a\r\nlone hand in the business world. And his painstaking purpose, as a man of\r\naffairs, is to secure less speculation and more stability, less waste and\r\nmore organisation, less friction and more community of interest.\r\n\r\nIn all things he is a simple and serious man. I have seen him work from\r\nnoon until midnight; but in my opinion, if he really had his choice, he\r\nwould prefer a quiet homestead, in the little town of Princeton, where he\r\ncould pursue a life devoted to the interests of Princeton University and\r\nthe Civic Federation. Even now, whenever he can get free from the\r\ntreadmill of his office, his greatest delight is to escape to a camp in\r\nthe wild lands of northern Michigan, where he can dress like a fisherman\r\nand forget that he is the servitor of a hundred and twenty millions.\r\n\r\nHarold McCormick, his brother, and a vice-president of the big company, is\r\na boy-hearted man of thirty-five. He has a quick-action brain; but his\r\nstrong point is his personal magnetism and likableness. He knows the\r\nharvester business throughout, having been a shirt-sleeve workman in the\r\nfactory, an agent at Council Bluffs, and a field expert in several states.\r\n\r\nMost of the stories told about him illustrate his naïve boyishness. For\r\ninstance, when he had become an expert in handling the harvester, an\r\nagent-in-chief near Chicago telegraphed for a dozen men. Only eleven\r\nexperts were available, so Harold volunteered to be the twelfth. He had\r\nhis working-card made out in the usual form, entitling him to $18 a week.\r\nOn Saturday night, when the twelve men went to the agent-in-chief for\r\ntheir wages, he said, \"I want all of you to come in and have a conference\r\nwith me to-morrow morning at ten o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to say, Mr. Blank,\" said young McCormick, \"that I can't be here\r\nuntil Monday.\"\r\n\r\nThe agent stormed. How could anything be more important to a\r\nthree-dollar-a-day man than his job?\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you really must know the reason,\" said the berated mechanic, \"I\r\nhave an appointment to go to church to-morrow morning with the Rockefeller\r\nfamily.\"\r\n\r\nThe third brother--Stanley McCormick, worked his way up from labourer to\r\nsuperintendent of the whole plant. For years he rose at five o'clock every\r\nwork-day morning, and walked into the factory at six.\r\n\r\nAll three of the McCormicks show a remarkable sense of obligation, almost\r\nof gratitude, to their employees. At the time the International was\r\norganised, Stanley said to the others:\r\n\r\n\"What about the men? There are some of them that deserve a share in the\r\nnew company, as much as we do.\"\r\n\r\nSo a list of the old employees was made, from Charlie Mulkey, the old\r\nwatchman, to R. G. Brooks, the superintendent, and $1,500,000 was divided\r\namong them. Recently a complete profit-sharing plan, such as Perkins had\r\nworked out for the Steel Trust, was put in working order, and about\r\n$200,000 of extra money have been scattered through the pay-envelopes.\r\n\r\nThe two Deerings, who are now chairman and vice-president, were\r\ndisciplined in the same stern, old-fashioned way as the McCormicks.\r\n\r\n\"Put this young man to work at the bottom rung of the ladder,\" said\r\nWilliam Deering, when his younger son, James, was graduated from the\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nBeing in many respects a chip of the old block, James Deering plunged into\r\nbusiness with as much energy as though he had to toil for his millions as\r\nwell as inherit them. He became a field expert, and followed the harvest\r\nfrom Texas to North Dakota. He asked for no favours, but sweltered along\r\namong the Western farmers for several summers. Then he went to the foot of\r\nthe ladder in the factory and wrestled with big iron castings and steel\r\nframes. Step by step he worked up, until even his Spartan father was\r\nsatisfied and made him the manager of the whole plant.\r\n\r\nAt present there is perhaps no man in the harvester industry who has so\r\ngreat a variety of attainments as James Deering. He is a shrewd\r\ncommercialist, yet he has found time, no one knows how, to master several\r\nlanguages and to run the whole octave of self-culture.\r\n\r\nCharles Deering, the older of the two brothers, had less farm experience,\r\nas he served for twelve years in Uncle Sam's navy. He was a lieutenant\r\nwhen he came ashore to help his father make harvesters. At that time he\r\ndid much to solve the binder-twine problem--how to get better twine and\r\nplenty of it. Then, when the drama of consolidation was staged by Morgan,\r\nhe took a leading part. Personally, he is a bluff, forceful, but\r\ncompanionable man, such as one would expect to find on the deck of a\r\nwar-ship rather than in the telephone-pestered office of a sky-scraper.\r\n\r\nThe two other vice-presidents of the Harvester Company are battle-worn\r\nveterans of the competitive period--J. J. Glessner and William H. Jones.\r\nGlessner, beginning as a bookkeeper in Ohio, has for many years been\r\nregarded as a sort of unofficial peacemaker and balance-wheel of the\r\ntrade. Everybody confided in Glessner. He did as much as any one else to\r\nharmonise the warring Harvester Kings; but it is also true that it was the\r\ngentle Glessner who developed competition to the explosive point by\r\noriginating the system of canvassing. He poured first oil and then water\r\non the fire.\r\n\r\nAs for William H. Jones, he is a sturdy and genial Welshman, who was born\r\nand bred in a farmhouse. As a boy he reaped wheat with a sickle in the\r\nvalleys of Wales. About forty years ago, when he had become an American,\r\nhe bought a reaper and a tent, and set out to earn his fortune. By working\r\ntwenty hours a day, he had earned enough money, by 1881, to begin making\r\nreapers of his own, at Plano; and he built up a large business.\r\n\r\nThe General Manager of this big anti-famine organisation is a young\r\nIllinoisan, named C. S. Funk. \"He is the central man,\" says Perkins. No\r\nother Chicagoan of his age--he is only thirty-five--has pushed up so\r\nquickly to so high a place, with nothing to help him except his own grit\r\nand ability. To-day he manages a 65,000-man-power corporation; yet it is\r\nvery little more than twenty years since he was trudging six miles on a\r\nhot July day, to ask for his first job in a hay-field. Young as he was, he\r\nwas then the support of a widowed mother, and there were seven children\r\nyounger than he.\r\n\r\nHis office, in which I was permitted to take notes for several days, is a\r\nnerve-centre of the world. Everything that happens to the human race is\r\nof interest to this alert young chancellor of the Harvester Company. A\r\ndrought in Argentina, the green bug in Kansas, a tariff campaign in\r\nAustralia, a shortage of farm labour in Egypt, a new railway in Southern\r\nRussia, such are the bulletins that guide him through his day's work.\r\n\r\nHis wide-flung army is officered mainly by farmers' sons who had a knack\r\nfor business or for machinery. His assistant, Alex. Legge, is an ex-cowboy\r\nfrom Nebraska. Before the era of peace and unity began, Funk and Legge had\r\nfought each other in twenty states.\r\n\r\n\"Legge was one of the best fighters I ever knew,\" said Funk; \"and I think\r\nyou might put him down as the most popular man in the company.\"\r\n\r\nMaurice Kane, the company's Chief Improver, and a fine type of the\r\nIrish-American, was born on a small farm near Limerick. He was a farm hand\r\nin Wisconsin when he first saw a harvester, and he has pulled himself up\r\nevery inch of the way by his own abilities. A. E. Mayer, the first of an\r\narmy of forty thousand salesmen, was born on a farm in New York. He is a\r\nsort of human Gatling gun, loaded with the experience of his trade. B. A.\r\nKennedy, the overlord of the thirteen factories, is a seasoned veteran who\r\ncan remember when he stood by the forge of a country blacksmith shop and\r\nhammered out ploughs by hand. Only one of the company's generals, H. F.\r\nPerkins, began life with such a luxury as a university education. He is in\r\ncharge of the raw materials--the coal and iron and lumber and sisal and\r\nflax.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the men who manage this international empire of\r\nbread-machinery. They are all practical men, hard workers, close to the\r\nfarm and the farmer. They are not fashionable idlers, nor promoters, nor\r\nWall Street speculators. And they have no more use for tickers than for\r\ntelescopes--a fact which is vitally important, now that they are making\r\nmore than half the harvesters of the world.\r\n\r\nSuch is the International Harvester Company from the inside. But an\r\noutside view is equally necessary. It is of tremendous interest to\r\n10,000,000 American farmers to know the habits and the disposition of\r\nthis powerful organisation. As Theodore Roosevelt has said, there are\r\ngood combinations and bad ones. Which is the International Harvester\r\nCompany?\r\n\r\nIn order to get the facts about it at first hand, I interviewed the four\r\nchief competitors of the Harvester Company, three Attorneys-General, seven\r\neditors of farm papers, four professors of agricultural colleges, seven or\r\neight implement agents, thirty farmers in Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin,\r\ntwo state governors, and the Federal Bureau of Corporations. Before I had\r\ngone far, I learned that the big Harvester Company has been beset by a\r\nhost of new troubles.\r\n\r\nIt is an evidence of the eternal futility of human ambition, that when a\r\ngroup of warring Harvester Kings had made peace with one another, when\r\nthey had healed their wounded and buried their dead, and sat down to enjoy\r\na future of prosperous tranquillity, up sprang a host of new enemies,\r\narmed and double-armed with weapons from which there seemed to be no sort\r\nof defence. Their outposts were shattered by legislative dynamite. Tariff\r\nwalls were built across their paths. And half a dozen giant ogres,\r\notherwise known as Attorneys-General, crashed into their peaceful business\r\nwith destructive clubs of law.\r\n\r\nThe bigger the organisation the more trouble to protect and preserve it.\r\nThis is what Abraham Lincoln learned--what the whole United States\r\nlearned, half a century ago; and it is the lesson that the\r\nharvester-makers are studying to-day. It is a new phase of an old fact; it\r\nis the Tragedy of the Trust.\r\n\r\nSome foreign nations, too, have taken their cue from American\r\nLegislatures, and have become almost as hostile to the Chicago company as\r\nthough it were exporting roulette wheels and burglars' jimmies. France\r\ntaxed half a million from it last year by a penalising tariff. Australia\r\nhas made it a political issue. Germany takes a toll of $11 on every\r\nself-binder, and Austria takes $25. Roumania raised the duty on harvesters\r\nseveral months ago; and there is a general feeling that the time has come\r\nto check the supremacy that the United States has always had in this line.\r\n\r\nYet the fact that the Harvester Company has been fined in two states does\r\nnot mean that it has taken advantage of its size to become a lawbreaker.\r\nThe \"crime\" of which it was declared guilty, was the maintenance of the\r\nold practice of \"exclusive contracts,\" which has been the almost universal\r\ncustom for fifty years. Each agent was pledged not to sell any other\r\ncompany's goods. _The International abolished this requirement two years\r\nago, and several of the independent companies still retain it._ Until the\r\nmerger was organised it was regarded as fair enough. It is one of the most\r\nusual habits of agency business. But the American people are now demanding\r\nthat a big company shall be much more \"square\" and moral than a small\r\ncapitalist who is fighting for his life.\r\n\r\nMany of the old methods of the rough-and-tumble days have survived. It is\r\nnot possible to say \"Presto, change!\" to 40,000 battling agents, so that\r\nthey shall at once begin to play fair and coöperate. But the general\r\nopinion is that the Combine has raised the harvester business to a higher\r\nlevel. At one of its branch offices I came accidentally upon a letter\r\nwritten by Cyrus H. McCormick, in which he forbade the taking of rebates\r\nfrom railways.\r\n\r\n\"You must clearly understand,\" he wrote, \"that this company will maintain\r\na policy of absolute obedience to the law.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the farmers of Iowa and Kansas I found no definite charges against\r\nthe harvester combine--nothing but that vague dread of bigness which seems\r\nnatural to the average mind, and which even the great-brained Webster had\r\nwhen he opposed the annexation of Texas and California. Of four farm\r\neditors, one was against all \"trusts\" on general principles; and the other\r\nthree believed that the evils of harvester competition were much greater\r\nthan those of consolidation. The bare fact that this one corporation has\r\n$120,000,000 of capital alarms the old-timers. Others have become more\r\naccustomed to the Big Facts of American business.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said one implement dealer, \"after all, $120,000,000 is less than\r\nthe American farmers earn in a week.\"\r\n\r\nHe might also have said that it was less than the value of one corn crop\r\nin Iowa, or half as much as the Iowa farmers have now on deposit in their\r\nsavings banks. It is very little more than Russell Sage raked in through\r\nthe wickets of his little money-lending office, or than Marshall Field\r\naccumulated from a single store. In fact, if bread were raised one cent a\r\nloaf for one year in the United States alone, the extra pennies would buy\r\nout the whole \"Harvester Trust,\" bag and baggage.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the farmers, so far as I could harmonise their opinions, are\r\nnow too well accustomed to big enterprises among themselves to be scared\r\nby the Chicago merger. They have at the present time more than five\r\nthousand coöperative companies of their own. And some of these are of\r\nnational importance; as, for instance, the powerful Cotton Growers' Trust,\r\nand the Farmers' Business Congress, which owns 800 elevators for the\r\nstorage of grain.\r\n\r\n\"My only objection to the International Harvester Company,\" said a\r\nbusiness man in St. Paul, \"is that it sells its machinery cheaper in\r\nEurope than it does in the United States.\" I investigated this charge, and\r\nfound it wholly incorrect. The greater expense and risk of foreign trade\r\ncompels the manufacturers to ask almost as high prices as American farmers\r\nhad to pay twenty years ago. But there is a quite credible reason for\r\nthis rumour. It is simply this--that for some less progressive countries a\r\ncrude, old-fashioned reaper is being made, to sell for $45. The modern,\r\nself-rake reaper is too complex for the simple mind of many a Russian\r\nfarmer, so he is supplied with a clumsy machine which is $15 cheaper, but\r\nwhich looked, to my unskilled eye, more than $30 worse.\r\n\r\nNo one accuses the \"Trust\" of having unreasonably raised prices. On the\r\ncontrary, it is generally given full credit for holding prices down, in\r\nspite of the fact that it is paying from twenty to eighty per cent. more\r\nfor its labour and raw materials than was paid in 1902. Generally\r\nspeaking, all farm implements except thrashing-machines are cheaper now\r\nthan they were in 1880, when the competition was most strenuous. Binders\r\nhave dropped from $325 to $125; hay-rakes from $25 to $16; and mowers from\r\n$80 to $45.\r\n\r\n\"I paid $200 for a self-binding harvester twenty-five years ago,\" said a\r\nKansas farmer. \"Ten years later I bought another for $140 and in 1907 I\r\nbought one from the International for $125, which is in my judgment the\r\nbest of the three machines.\"\r\n\r\nThe International has competitors, too--very active and able ones. Binders\r\nare made by 4 large independent companies, mowers by 17, corn-shredders by\r\n18, twine by 26, wagons by 116, and gasolene engines by 124. Of the\r\nthirty-seven different machines made by the International there are only\r\nthree--hemp-reapers, corn-shockers, and rice-binders--that are made by no\r\nother company, and even these machines are not protected by any basic\r\npatents. Powerful as the International is, it is still far from the place\r\nwhere business is one long sweet dream of monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe four independent companies that make binders seem to have no fear of\r\nthe \"Trust.\" \"We have no fault to find with it,\" said President Atwater,\r\nof the Johnson Company. \"We don't want it smashed. Why? Because our\r\nbusiness has doubled since it was organised; and because we would sooner\r\ncompete with one company than with a dozen.\"\r\n\r\n\"The 'Trust' was the only thing that saved the whole harvester business\r\nfrom annihilation,\" said the ex-president of another independent company,\r\nwhen I pressed him for his personal opinion, and promised not to use his\r\nname. \"The cold fact is really this,\" he added, \"that the International\r\nHarvester Company has bettered conditions for the farmer, for the\r\nindependent companies, and for everybody but itself.\"\r\n\r\n\"The big combine has never misused its power,\" said a third of the\r\nInternational's competitors. \"Now and then its agents make trouble, just\r\nas ours do, no doubt. But the men at the top have always given us a square\r\ndeal.\"\r\n\r\nSo it is my duty to state that on the whole the Harvester Combine is a\r\ngood combination and not a bad one. I have found it radically different\r\nfrom the get-rich-quick trusts that have been described in recent books\r\nand magazine articles. It is not a monopoly. It is an advocate of free\r\ntrade. Its stock is not watered, nor for sale in Wall Street. And the men\r\nat the top are very evidently plain, hard-working, simple-living American\r\ncitizens, who are quite content to do business in a live-and-let-live way.\r\n\r\nThey are not thoroughly reconciled, even yet, to being a merger. They\r\nlook back with open regret to the wasteful but adventurous days of\r\ncompetition. Of the combination the elder Mrs. Cyrus McCormick finely\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"It was a hurt of the heart. Each of our companies was like a family. Each\r\nhad a body of loyal agents, who had been comrades through many struggles.\r\nBut the terrible increase in expenses compelled us to subdue our feelings\r\nand to coöperate with one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not a merger man myself,\" said William Deering, \"although I believe\r\nthat the International Harvester Company has been a benefit to the\r\nfarmers.\"\r\n\r\nCyrus H. McCormick goes still further. He is a \"trust-buster\" himself, so\r\nfar as the over-capitalised and oppressive leviathans of business are\r\nconcerned. He said to me frankly: \"Some of the hostility to our company is\r\ninspired by worthy motives, growing out of the general opposition to the\r\nso-called trusts.\" And when a North Dakota congressman proposed in 1904\r\nthat the International Harvester Company should be investigated, Cyrus\r\nMcCormick at once sent a message that amazed the Bureau of\r\nCorporations--\"Please come and investigate us,\" he said. \"If we're not\r\nright, we want to get right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said one of the highest officials of the Roosevelt administration,\r\nwhen I asked him to corroborate this very remarkable story. \"It is true\r\nthat from 1904 it has been the continued desire of the International\r\nHarvester Company that we should investigate them. In fact, during the\r\nlast year (1907) they have urged us with considerable earnestness to make\r\nthis investigation.\"\r\n\r\nSo, this big business has evolved from simple to complex in accordance\r\nwith the same laws that rule plants and empires. It has probably not yet\r\nreached its full maturity, for it is greater than any man or any form of\r\norganisation, and the tiny ephemeral atoms who control it to-day are no\r\nmore than its most obedient retinue. They come and go--quarrel and make\r\nfriends--live and die. What matter? The big business, once alive, grows on\r\nthrough the short centuries, from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nAnd what does it all mean--this federation of thirteen factory\r\ncities--this coordination of muscle and mind and millions--this arduous\r\ndevelopment of a new art, whereby a group of mechanics can take a\r\nwagon-load of iron ore and a tree, and fashion them into a shapely\r\nautomaton that has the power of a dozen farmers?\r\n\r\n_It means bread. It means hunger-insurance for the whole human race. As we\r\nshall see in the next chapter, it means that the famine problem has been\r\nsolved, not only for the United States, but for all the civilised nations\r\nof the world._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN HARVESTER ABROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first American reapers that went to Europe were given a royal welcome.\r\nThere were two of them--one made by McCormick and one made by Hussey, and\r\nthey were exhibited before Albert Edward, the Prince Consort of England,\r\nat a World's Fair in London in 1851.\r\n\r\nThere had been reapers invented in England before this date, but none of\r\nthem would reap. All the inventors were mere theorists. They designed\r\ntheir reapers for ideal grain in ideal fields. One of them was a preacher,\r\nthe Rev. Patrick Bell; another, Henry Ogle, was a school-teacher. James\r\nDobbs, an actor, invented a machine that cut artificial grain on the\r\nstage. And a machinist named Gladstone made a reaper that also worked well\r\nuntil he tried it on real grain in a real field.\r\n\r\nBut the exhibition of the American reaper in London did not result in its\r\nimmediate adoption. There was little demand for harvesters in England\r\nfifty years ago; and in other European countries there was none at all.\r\nFarm labour was cheap--forty cents a day in England and five cents a day\r\nin Russia; and the rush of labourers into factory cities had not yet\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nIn the years following 1851, the American reaper did, however, become\r\npopular among the very rich. It became the toy of kings and titled\r\nlandowners. By 1864 Europe was buying our farm machinery to the extent of\r\n$600,000. This was less than she buys to-day in a week; but it was a\r\nbeginning. Several foreign manufacturers began at this time to make\r\nreapers, notably in Toronto, Sheffield, Paris, and Hamburg. This\r\ncompetition spurred on the American reaper agents, who were already taking\r\nadvantage of the interest shown by royalty in the American reaper. And\r\nfrom the close of the Civil War on, there was an exciting race, generally\r\nneck and neck, between Cyrus H. McCormick, Sr., and Walter A. Wood, to see\r\nwho could vanquish the most of these foreign imitators, and bag the\r\ngreatest number of kings and nobilities.\r\n\r\nIt was a contest that not only resulted in the triumph of the American\r\nreaper, but also brought the Reaper Kings recognition and reputation\r\nabroad. In 1867 both McCormick and Wood were decorated with the Cross of\r\nthe Legion of Honour by Napoleon III.; and later they stood side by side\r\nto receive the Imperial Cross from the hand of the Austrian emperor.\r\nHundreds of medals and honours were showered upon these two inventor\r\nmechanics; and the French Academy of Science, in a blaze of Gallic\r\nenthusiasm, elected McCormick one of its members, because he had \"done\r\nmore for the cause of agriculture than any other living man.\"\r\n\r\nMany and strange were the exploits of the American Reaper Kings at the\r\ncourts and royal farms of the real kings. Unable to speak any language but\r\ntheir own, unused to pomp and pageantry, breezily independent in the\r\nAmerican fashion, the Reaper Kings plunged from adventure to adventure,\r\nabsolutely indifferent to everything but their reapers and success.\r\n\r\n\"There is to be a trial of reapers at Rome next June,\" wrote David M.\r\nOsborne, a New Yorker who began to export reapers to Europe in 1862.\r\n\"Think of invading the sacred precincts of that ancient place with Yankee\r\nharvesters. We will wake up the dry bones of these old countries, and\r\ncivilise and Christianise them with our farm machinery.\"\r\n\r\nC. W. Marsh, inventor of the Marsh Harvester, made a sensational début in\r\nHungary in 1870. Several grand dukes had arranged for a great contest of\r\nthe various sorts of reapers on one of the royal farms in Hungary, so that\r\nthe Minister of Agriculture might take notice. When the day arrived, there\r\nwere nine reapers at the farm, mostly of European design.\r\n\r\nMarsh's strange-looking machine seemed to be a combination of reaper and\r\nworkbench. But ten minutes after the contest began, Marsh had the race\r\nwon. His machine was a new type, the forerunner of the modern self-binder.\r\nIt was so made that two men could stand upon it and bind the grain as fast\r\nas it was cut. But on this occasion Marsh could hire no farmer to help him\r\nand was obliged to do the work alone. The judges were stunned with\r\namazement, therefore, when they found that he had bound three-quarters of\r\nan acre in twenty-eight minutes. Here was a man who could do in half an\r\nhour what few Hungarian peasants could finish in less than a day!\r\n\r\n\"He is an athlete,\" said one. \"A wizard,\" said another.\r\n\r\nBefore they could recover from their astonishment, Marsh had stored his\r\nharvester, pocketed the prize of forty golden ducats, and hurried away to\r\nhis hotel, eager for a bath and a chance to pick the thistles out of his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nBut the grand dukes and miscellaneous dignitaries were not to be escaped\r\nso easily. An officer in gorgeous uniform was sent to find Marsh and bring\r\nhim forthwith to the main dining-hall of the city. Here a banquet was\r\nprepared, and a throng of high personages sat down, with Marsh at the head\r\nof the table, cursing his luck and nursing his sore fingers.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the banquet, amid great applause, a medal was pinned upon\r\nhis coat, and the whole assemblage hushed to hear his reply. Now Marsh,\r\nlike two-thirds of the Reaper Kings, could no more make a speech than walk\r\na rope. On only one previous occasion had he faced an audience, and that\r\nwas at the age of twelve, when he had recited a scrap from the \"Lay of the\r\nLast Minstrel\" at a school entertainment. As he rose to his feet, this\r\npoetic fragment came into his mind; and so, half in fun and half in\r\ndesperation, Marsh assumed the pose of a Demosthenes and addressed the\r\nbanqueters as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"O Caledonia! Stern and wild,\r\n  Meet nurse for a poetic child!\r\n  Land of brown heath and shaggy wood,\r\n  Land of the mountain and the flood,\r\n  Land of my sires! What mortal hand\r\n  Can e'er untie the filial band\r\n  That knits me to thy rugged strand!\"\r\n\r\n\"That was the first and only speech of my life,\" said Mr. Marsh, when I\r\nsaw him in his home as DeKalb, where he has retired from business. \"But it\r\ncertainly established my reputation as an orator in that region of\r\nHungary.\"\r\n\r\nAt one famous competition near Paris, in 1879, three reapers were set to\r\nwork in fields of equal size. The French reaper led off and finished in\r\nseventy-two minutes. The English reaper followed and lumbered through in\r\nsixty-six minutes. Then came the American machine, and when it swept down\r\nits stretch of grain in twenty-two minutes, the judges were inclined to\r\ndoubt either their watches or their eyesight.\r\n\r\nAnother of these tournaments, which also did much to advertise the United\r\nStates as the only genuine and original reaper country, took place on an\r\nEnglish estate in 1880. There was only one American reaper in the race,\r\nand in appearance it was the clown of the circus. The ship that carried it\r\nhad been wrecked on the Irish coast, so that when it arrived the machine\r\nwas rusted and dingy.\r\n\r\nCyrus H. McCormick, Jr., had it in charge. He was then a youth of\r\ntwenty-one, and equally ready for an adventure or a sale. There was no\r\ntime to repaint and polish the machine, so he resolved to convert its\r\nforlorn appearance into an asset.\r\n\r\n\"Oil her up so she'll run like a watch,\" he said to his experts. \"But\r\ndon't improve her looks. If you find any paint, scrape it off. And go and\r\nhire the smallest, scrubbiest, toughest pair of horses you can find.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day five or six foreign reapers were on hand, each glittering\r\nwith newness and drawn by a stately team of big Norman horses. The shabby\r\nAmerican reaper arrived last, and met a shout of ridicule as it rolled\r\ninto its place. But in the race, \"Old Rusty,\" as the spectators called it,\r\nswept ahead of the others as though it were an enchanted chariot, winning\r\nthe gold medal and an enviable prestige among British farmers.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, as in England, the reaper was introduced into general use\r\nthrough royalty. This was in 1871, when a New York Reaper King named Byron\r\nE. Huntley gave the German emperor and empress their first view of\r\nharvesting on the American plan. The exhibition took place in a\r\ngrain-field that lay near the royal residence at Potsdam. At first, the\r\nempress watched the machine from a window; but soon she became so keenly\r\ninterested that she went into the field to study it at closer range.\r\n\r\n\"I admire you Americans,\" she said to the delighted Huntley. \"You are so\r\ndeft--so ingenious, to make a machine like this.\"\r\n\r\nThe present Emperor of Germany is not merely interested in American\r\nharvesters; he is an enthusiast. On several occasions he has held\r\nharvester matinées for the benefit of his cabinet ministers, so that they\r\ncould see with their own eyes the superiority of machinery to hand-labour.\r\nThe first of these matinées was given on one of the Kaiser's farms, near\r\nthe ancient city of Bonn, in 1896; and I was told the story by Sam Dennis,\r\nthe Illinois Irishman who was in charge of the harvester.\r\n\r\nDennis arranged a contest between his one machine and forty Polish women\r\nwho cut the grain with old-fashioned sickles. As soon as the emperor and\r\nhis retinue had arrived, all on horseback, a signal was given and the\r\nstrange race began. On one side of the field were the forty women, bent\r\nand browned by many a day's toil under the hot sun. On the other side was\r\nSam Dennis, sitting on his showy harvester.\r\n\r\n\"Get ap!\" said Dennis to the big German horses, and the grain fell in a\r\nwide swath over the clicking knife, swept upward on the canvas elevator\r\ninto the swift steel arms and fingers, and was flung to the ground in a\r\nfusillade of sheaves, each bound tightly with a knotted string.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN SELF-BINDERS ON THE ESTATE OF PRESIDENT FALLIERES,\r\nIN FRANCE]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe emperor was radiant with delight. Being somewhat of an expert\r\nhimself, he rode here and there and showed, with many gestures, the\r\ndifferences between the old way and the new. Some of the grain had been\r\nblown down. Nothing but a sickle could cut it, in the belief, at that\r\ntime, of the average German farmer. On the contrary, as the emperor\r\npointed out to his ministers, the harvester was raising the fallen grain\r\nand cutting it without the waste of a handful while the women were\r\ntrampling much of it under their bare feet, as they jostled one another in\r\nthe stubbled field.\r\n\r\nMost wonderful of all, the one machine was soon seen to be doing more work\r\nthan the whole mob of women drudges. The field had been evenly divided\r\nbefore the race began, and there was some wheat still uncut on the women's\r\nside when Sam Dennis said \"Whoa!\" to his horses, and condescended to enter\r\ninto a free and easy conversation with the distinguished onlookers.\r\n\r\nFor the forty Polish women, the new harvester meant a better life finally,\r\nalthough at the time they hated the red monster of a machine that was\r\nabout to take their jobs. In payment for the long, sweating work of the\r\nharvest-field they received only twenty-five cents a day. Probably what\r\nsome of those women did, when they saw themselves displaced, was to buy a\r\nsteerage ticket to the country where the red harvester was made; at any\r\nrate I found two thousand women in the harvester factories of Chicago,\r\nearning $9 a week, and most of them, as it happened, were Polish.\r\n\r\nEven Bismarck, the grim old unifier of Germany, yielded to general opinion\r\na short time before his death, and bought an American self-binder. I was\r\ntold of the incident by C. H. Haney, who made the sale, and who is to-day\r\nthe head of the Foreign Department of the Harvester Company.\r\n\r\n\"Bismarck sat in his carriage,\" said Haney, \"but he ordered his driver to\r\nfollow the harvester as closely as possible. He looked very old and\r\nfeeble. For quite a while he watched me operating the machine. Then he\r\nmade a sign to me to stop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see the thing that ties the knot,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I took off the knotter and brought it to his carriage. With a piece of\r\nstring I showed him how the mechanism worked, and gave him a bound sheaf,\r\nso that he could see a knot that had been tied by the machine. The old man\r\nstudied it for some time. Then he asked me--'Can these machines be made in\r\nGermany?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, your Excellency,' I said. 'They can be made only in America.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said Bismarck, speaking very good English, 'you Yankees are\r\ningenious fellows. This is a wonderful machine.'\"\r\n\r\nWhen Loubet was President of France, he and Seth Low, of New York, were\r\nwalking together over the President's estate. Loubet pointed to a reaper\r\nwhich was being driven through a yellow wheat-field.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that machine?\" he remarked. \"I bought it from an American\r\ncompany in 1870, and I have used it in every harvest since that time. I\r\nhave four of those machines now, and I want to say to you that they are\r\nthe most useful articles that come to us from the United States. I am\r\nstating no more than the simple truth when I tell you that without\r\nAmerican harvesters, France would starve.\"\r\n\r\nIn still other countries the American reaper has been popular with kings\r\nand potentates. The Sultan of Turkey and the Shah of Persia each bought\r\none during the Chicago World's Fair. And the young King of Spain, who\r\nordered a mower in 1903, narrowly escaped being minced up by its knives.\r\nBeing an impulsive youth, he gave a cry of joy at sight of the handsome\r\nmachine, sprang upon the seat, and lashed the horses without first laying\r\nhold of the reins. The horses leaped, and the seventeen-year-old Alphonso\r\nwent sprawling. Twenty workmen ran to his help, and one level-headed\r\nAmerican mechanic caught the reins; so the worst penalty that the boy king\r\nhad to pay for his recklessness was a tumble and a bad scare.\r\n\r\nIn Russia, the Czar and the grand dukes at first bought reapers partly as\r\ntoys and partly as strike-breakers. If the labourers on their estates\r\ndemanded more pay than fifty cents a week, the manager would drive them in\r\na body to his barn, then throw open the doors and show them five or six\r\nred harvesters.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see these American machines?\" he would say. \"Unless you go back to\r\nwork at the same wages, I will reap the grain with these machines, and\r\nyou will have no work at all, and no money.\" A look at these\r\nmachine-devils has usually sent the cowed serfs back to their sickles. But\r\nhere and there it has set them to wondering whether or not a\r\nfifty-cent-a-week job was worth having, and so has given them an A B C\r\nlesson in American doctrines.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING ALPHONSO OF SPAIN DRIVING AN AMERICAN SEEDER]\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the Russian nobility, too, have begun to learn a trifle about\r\ndemocracy from the American harvester agents. There is a certain young\r\nbaron, for example, whose estate is not far from Riga. Last year, to be in\r\nfashion, he bought a Chicago self-binder. When it arrived, there came with\r\nit, as usual, an expert mechanic to set it up and start it in the field.\r\nIn this case, the mechanic was a big German-American named Lutfring, born\r\nin Wisconsin, of \"Forty Eighter\" stock.\r\n\r\nThe baron was evidently impressed by the manly and dignified bearing of\r\nLutfring, who stood erect while the native workmen were bowing and\r\ncringing in obeisance. And when Lutfring said to him, \"Now, Baron Hahn, we\r\nare all barons in my country, but you'll pardon me if I do this work in\r\nmy shirt-sleeves,\" the baron was so taken by surprise that he offered to\r\nhold Lutfring's coat. Half an hour later he was at work himself, doing\r\nphysical labour for the first time in his life. And when the harvester had\r\nbeen well launched upon its sea of yellow grain, he took Lutfring--the\r\nbaron from Wisconsin--to dinner with him in the castle, and spent the\r\ngreater part of the afternoon showing him the family portraits.\r\n\r\nFrom such beginnings the harvester has advanced, to make in Russia the\r\ngreatest conquests it has achieved anywhere. More business is now being\r\ndone in the land of the Czar than was done with the whole world in 1885.\r\nOne recent shipment, so large as to break all records, was carried from\r\nChicago to New York on 3,000 freight-cars, and transferred to a chartered\r\nfleet of nine steam-ships, $5,000,000 worth of hunger-insurance.\r\n\r\nDuring the Russo-Japanese War a striking incident occurred that showed the\r\nrespect of the government for American harvesters. Several troop-trains\r\nthat were on their way to the front were suddenly side-tracked, to make\r\nway for a long freight train, loaded with heavy boxes. The war generals\r\nand grand dukes in charge of the troops were furious. Why should their\r\ntrains be pushed to one side and delayed, to expedite a mere consignment\r\nof freight? They telegraphed their indignation to St. Petersburg, and\r\nreceived a reply from Count Witte. \"The freight train must pass,\" he said.\r\n\"It is loaded with American harvesters. _It means bread._\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of this attitude, there are now some provinces in southern\r\nRussia where not even Secretary of Agriculture James Wilson would find\r\nmuch fault with the farming. I have secured the figures for the Province\r\nof Kuban, in the Caucasus. Here there are 3,500 thrashing-machines, 5,000\r\ngrain-drills, 37,000 harvesters, 50,000 harrows, 70,000 grain-cleaners,\r\nand 65,000 cultivators. This is a region where, one generation ago, were\r\nonly the wooden plough, the sickle, and the flail.\r\n\r\nThere is, to be sure, still a dense mass of Russians whose yearly habit it\r\nis to wait until their wheat is dead ripe, then in a few days of frantic\r\nlabour to cut down half of it with sickles, leaving the rest to rot in the\r\nfields. And in one Caucasian province, richer in its soil than Iowa, it\r\nis the custom of the wandering natives to move every three years to a new\r\ntract of land, in order to avoid the trouble of fertilising the soil.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen farmers ploughing in Russia with a piece of board,\" said one\r\nagent. \"And I have seen their thrashing done by the feet of oxen.\" But the\r\nnew idea has been planted and is growing. \"Russia is the land of\r\nto-morrow,\" said another expert. \"We have been educating the farmers there\r\nfor seventeen years, yet we have only scratched the surface. We who have\r\nlived among the Russian peasants expect great things from them.\"\r\n\r\nThey have succeeded, then, in their campaign for the supremacy of the\r\nAmerican reaper--the Reaper Kings who enlisted the crowned heads and the\r\nnobility of Europe in their service. By 1899 Europe was a customer at our\r\nfarm machinery factories to the extent of twelve millions a year. This\r\nfigure was doubled in 1906, and is now increasing by leaps and bounds. All\r\ntold, this one industry has brought us $150,000,000 of foreign money in\r\nless than fifty years.\r\n\r\nEurope has sent us emigrants--twenty-five million in the past\r\nseventy-five years. But we have more than replaced them with labour-saving\r\nfarm machinery. There were in 1907 as many American harvesters in Europe\r\nas would do the work of eleven million men.\r\n\r\nIf our foreign trade goes ahead at its present rate of speed, we shall\r\nsoon have Europe hopelessly in our debt, in this exchange of men for\r\nmachinery. In the past four years, for instance, Europe has sent us less\r\nthan four million emigrants, but we have sent to Europe, in that time,\r\nenough agricultural automata to equal the labour of five million men.\r\n\r\nAnd this means much to Europe. What with her 4,500,000 soldiers and her\r\n4,000,000 public officials, she has to serve more than twenty-five million\r\nmeals a day to men who are non-producers. She has to clothe and house\r\nthese governmental millions and their families. How could she do this if\r\nit were not for the eleven million man-power of her American harvesters,\r\nand the half billion bushels of reaper-wheat that she can buy from other\r\ncountries?\r\n\r\nFrance must have our harvesters because she has been short of men since\r\nthe wars of Napoleon. She has half a million soldiers and nine-tenths of a\r\nmillion officials. Even now, with harvesters clicking merrily in all their\r\nlargest grain-fields, she and Germany cannot feed themselves. Spain at one\r\ntime exported wheat, but at present is buying 10,000,000 bushels a year.\r\nEngland grows less than a quarter as much as will feed her people. And\r\nRussia would be famine-swept from end to end, in spite of her 30,000,000\r\nfarmers and her illimitable acres, if she had to depend wholly upon the\r\nsickle and the scythe.\r\n\r\nBut the story is by no means ended with Europe. To-day the sun never sets\r\nand the season never closes for American harvesters. They are reaping the\r\nfields of Argentina in January, Upper Egypt in February, East India in\r\nMarch, Mexico in April, China in May, Spain in June, Iowa in July, Canada\r\nin August, Sweden in September, Norway in October, South Africa in\r\nNovember, and Burma in December. It is always harvest somewhere. The\r\nripple of the ripened grain goes round the world and the American\r\nharvester follows it.\r\n\r\nEven from this incomplete list one may begin to understand how tremendous\r\nis the task that the International Harvester Company has assumed in\r\nundertaking to cater to the farmers of fifty countries--to adapt itself to\r\ntheir various customs.\r\n\r\nIn Holland, for instance, where the grass is short and thick, a mower must\r\ncut as close as a barber's clippers; and in Denmark, where moss grows\r\nunder the grass, it must cut so high as to leave the moss untouched. The\r\ncareful Germans of Wisconsin will buy a light harvester, such as the\r\n\"Milwaukee\"; but in Argentina a light machine would be racked into junk in\r\na season. The Argentinians, having raised cattle for generations, rush to\r\nthe harvest in cowboy fashion. It is the joy of their lives to hitch six\r\nor eight horses to a big \"header,\" crack the long whip, and dash at full\r\ngallop over the rough ground.\r\n\r\nThere are small horses in Russia, big ones in France, oxen in India, and\r\ncamels in Siberia, and the harvesters must be adapted to each. Certain\r\nbackward countries demand a reaper without a reel. Australia must have a\r\nmonster machine called a \"stripper,\" which combs off the heads of the\r\ngrain. California and Argentina, because of their dry climate, can use\r\n\"headers,\" a combination of reaper and thrashing-machine. And so the\r\nAmerican harvester has become a citizen of the world, adopting the\r\nnational dress of each country.\r\n\r\nThe men who are dealing hand to hand with these problems are no longer the\r\nReaper Kings, personally introducing their harvesters through royalty and\r\nnobility. These have been succeeded by an army of fifteen hundred American\r\nharvester experts. They are all salaried, most of them by the\r\n\"International\"; and their work is to put the farmers of the world to\r\nschool. They are the teachers of a stupendous kindergarten. As an example\r\nof the rapidity with which they are sometimes able to teach, take the\r\nPhilippines. Nine years ago the Filipinos spent nothing whatever for\r\nfarming machinery; in 1905 they bought $90,000 worth. Even yet, however,\r\nthey do not raise enough rice to feed themselves; and although half of\r\nthem are farmers, only one-twentieth of their land is cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BISMARCK HAVING HIS FIRST VIEW OF AN AMERICAN SELF-BINDER]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Many of our agents are now living in Siberia with their families,\" said\r\nC. S. Funk, the General Manager of the International. \"They are teaching\r\nthe mujiks to grow wheat and harvest it. We have similar missionaries in\r\nSouth Africa and South America and most of the countries of the world.\r\nSome of them have gone as far as water and rail would carry them, and have\r\nthen crossed the mountains with their machinery on the backs of mules, so\r\nthat they might teach the natives how to farm on the American plan. All\r\ntold, we have more than a thousand such missionaries in foreign\r\ncountries.\"\r\n\r\nIn Chicago, I met two of the leaders who are in control of this army of\r\nteachers. One was a strong-faced young Illinoisan named Couchman, who\r\nhandles several nations from Hamburg; and the other was a courteous\r\ncommercial diplomat named La Porte, who supervises France, Spain, Italy,\r\nand Northern Africa from his office in Paris. Each is in charge of several\r\nhundred American mechanics, who are exiled from home for the sake of our\r\nharvester trade.\r\n\r\nNo renown comes to these men. No medals are pinned upon their coats. They\r\nare only one regiment in the great pay-envelope army of American\r\nmechanics. But they are on the firing-line of the greatest battle against\r\nignorance and famine that has ever been fought. They are the pioneers of\r\nthe new farmer. To show the world's peasantry how to work with brains and\r\nmachinery, to bring them up to the American farmer's level--that is their\r\ntask. What could be more essentially American, or more profitable to the\r\nhuman race?\r\n\r\nMany European farmers, of course, are easily up to the Kansas level; but\r\nthe vast majority have been mistaught that the path of the farmer must\r\nforever be watered with sweat. Many of them are so cramped by the shackles\r\nof drudgery that they cannot even conceive of the value of leisure.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you use a scythe? Then you could cut twice as much,\" said\r\nHorace Greeley, who was deeply interested in farm machinery and\r\nagriculture, to a French peasant. The peasant scratched his head. This was\r\na new idea.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" he answered stodgily, \"I haven't got twice as much to cut.\"\r\n\r\nThe quick, handy ways of American farmers are seldom found in other\r\ncountries. A Swiss will put a big stone upon a land-roller, to give it\r\nweight, and then walk behind it. To ride on the roller himself does not\r\noccur to him. A South German will usually take the reel off his reaper,\r\nand handle the grain by hand. Operating five levers is too great a tax\r\nupon his mind. An Argentinian wastes his pesos by hiring drivers--one on\r\nthe seat and another astride one of the horses.\r\n\r\n\"A Spanish farmer sent for me on one occasion,\" an expert told me, \"and I\r\nfound him in great trouble. He had bought a new harvester, and put it\r\ntogether _inside_ his barn, which had only one narrow door. He had to\r\nchoose between taking the machine to pieces and pulling his barn down.\"\r\n\r\nNext to Russia, in the list of countries that this army of experts has won\r\nto the harvester, comes Canada. Like the trek of the Boers into the\r\nTransvaal, and of the Japanese into Korea, there has been a trek of three\r\nhundred thousand American farmers into Western Canada--into the new\r\nforty-bushel-to-the-acre wheat-land of Alberta. Most of these emigrants\r\nwere Minnesotans and Dakotans; therefore they are not poor. They carried\r\ntwo hundred millions across the border. And they are now uprearing a\r\nharvester-based civilisation in a vast region that will probably some day\r\nhave a population of twenty-five million people.\r\n\r\nThat billiard-table country--Argentina--stands third among the foreign\r\npatrons of our Harvester Kings. As a wheat nation it is little older than\r\nAlberta. It was only about eighteen years ago, after three centuries of\r\nrevolution, that Argentina settled down to raise wheat and be good.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Argentinians raise more wheat than Germany, and their country\r\nhas become a land of milk and honey. It is a South American Minnesota, but\r\neleven times larger, made fertile by the slow-moving Platte River--a\r\nhundred miles wide when it reaches the sea--which moves through its plains\r\nlike an irrigating canal.\r\n\r\nThe fourth in rank of our harvester buyers is Australia, which is now\r\nsending a yearly tribute of more than a million to the International\r\nCompany. This profitable reciprocity between Chicago and the island\r\ncontinent was greatly furthered when the International bought the\r\nsixty-five-acre Osborne plant, at Auburn, New York, which had been\r\nremarkably successful in its Australian, as well as its French, trade.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN AMERICAN HARVESTER AT WORK IN ARGENTINA]\r\n\r\n\r\nRide along any of the historic roadways of the world and you will see the\r\npainted automata from Chicago. \"On the road to Mandalay,\" and along the\r\nAppian Way, and the trail of death that marks the flight of Napoleon from\r\nMoscow, you will find these indispensable machines. They are cutting grass\r\nand wheat on the battle-fields of Austerlitz and Sedan and Waterloo.\r\n\r\nScutari, near the Adriatic Sea, bars out foreign machinery by law; but\r\nRoumania has been using our reapers and mowers for more than fifteen\r\nyears. Once in a while a reaper is sent over the Andes on muleback; or\r\ninto Central China via the wheelbarrow express. And now that there are\r\nirrigation pumps at the base of the Sphinx, that ancient female, who has\r\nbeen staring at sand-hills for three thousand years may soon look across\r\nyellow fields in which American binders are clicking cheerfully. They are\r\nfor sale, too, in the holy cities of Rome, Jerusalem, Mecca, and\r\nBenares--almost everywhere but Lhasa, the sacred capital of Tibet. So far\r\nas I can learn, not one harvesting machine of any kind has entered that\r\nland of mystery and superstition. In a few other countries harvesters are\r\nnot numerous. Very few have been sold or will be in Japan. Here are the\r\nsmallest farms in the world. A fork and a pair of scissors would seem much\r\nmore appropriate implements for such tiny plots. Take the whole arable\r\narea of Japan, multiply it by three, and you will have only the state of\r\nIllinois.\r\n\r\nIn India, where a family \"lives\" on fifty cents a week, where one acre\r\nmakes three farms and an entire farm outfit means no more than a\r\nten-dollar bill, a harvester is still almost as great a curiosity as an\r\nIndian tiger is to us. One of the harvester agents told me of a rich\r\nHindoo who bought a complete set of American farm machines, and had them\r\nset in a row near his house, apparently regarding them only as curios from\r\na foreign land. They have never been used, and a mob of starving labourers\r\nreap his grain by hand within sight of his idle machines.\r\n\r\nThere are few harvesters in Asia Minor, where farmers live almost like\r\ngroundhogs--a whole family in one windowless hut of burnt clay. And there\r\nare fewer still in Africa, where five million idle acres of fertile land\r\nwill some day be made to work for the human race.\r\n\r\nBut since the formation of the big Chicago company, every foreign nation\r\nis being reached and taught to throw away its reaping-hooks and to cut its\r\ngrain in a civilised way. There is now practically no great city anywhere\r\nin which a farmer cannot buy one of the handsome red harvesters that have\r\ndone so much to give a \"full dinner-pail\" to the civilized nations.\r\n\r\n\"The world is mine oyster,\" says the International Harvester Company. In\r\nthe first five years of its career, it has sent to foreign countries\r\n920,000 harvesters of all sorts, for which it has been paid $70,000,000.\r\nIt has doubled its foreign sales and now makes two-third of the harvesters\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nWhat with the profits, and the big orders, and the medals, and the\r\nappreciation of monarchs, the Harvester men have found their foreign trade\r\nfrom the first a business _de luxe_. In fact, one of the principal\r\nreasons why they quit fighting was that they might handle this world\r\ncommerce in an organised way.\r\n\r\nTo-day they are not battling with one another on the royal farms of\r\nEurope, like gladiators who make sport for emperors. There is more\r\nbusiness and less adventure. They have a geography of their own, and have\r\ndivided the whole world into eight provinces. The \"Domestic\" Department of\r\nthe International comprises the United States and Canada and is managed\r\nfrom Chicago. Central Europe, with Russia and Siberia, has its\r\nheadquarters at Hamburg; Western Europe and Northern Africa are handled\r\nfrom Paris; Great Britain is directed from London; South America from\r\nBuenos Ayres; Australia from Melbourne; New Zealand from Christchurch; and\r\nMexico from Mexico City. Such is the commercial empire that has its seat\r\nat the foot of Lake Michigan.\r\n\r\nOther countries can sell us automobiles and bric-a-brac. They may even get\r\nover our tariff wall with hay and cotton and steel and lumber. But they\r\nhave never dared to try to sell us farm machinery. Every harvester in\r\nthe United States was made at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATHERING IN A FINLAND HARVEST]\r\n\r\n\r\nEither one of the two immense harvester plants of Chicago is larger than\r\nthe combined plants of England, Germany, and France. France, recently,\r\nmade a brilliant dash toward success in the harvester business. M.\r\nRacquet, a journalist, built a great factory at Amiens. He bought the best\r\nAmerican machinery. He allied himself with a savings bank and sold stock\r\nto the farmers. He was protected by a high tariff. But, alas for his\r\neloquent prospectus! His selling force was too small. His American\r\nmachinery made more reapers in a month than he could sell in a year. And\r\nin 1904 he fell into bankruptcy under a debt of ten million francs.\r\n\r\nAn American harvester is practically above competition in foreign\r\ncountries, and commands an exceptional price. As for tariffs, there is a\r\nwide open door in Great Britain, Holland, Norway, Bulgaria, Brazil,\r\nServia, and South Germany. But there is a toll-gate fee of $25 per\r\nharvester in Hungary, and $20 in France; and for lack of a commercial\r\ntreaty, the tax has lately been increased in part of Germany, in Hungary,\r\nSwitzerland, and Rumania. The harvester companies feel that they have a\r\nsubstantial grievance against a government that allows them to be not only\r\nhazed and harried at home by tariffs on raw material, but driven out of\r\nforeign markets as well. \"The whole world is doing business on a single\r\nstreet to-day,\" said one harvester maker; \"but the trouble is that there\r\nare two hundred tariff toll-gates along that street.\"\r\n\r\nIn self-defence, against these tariffs, the \"International\" has been\r\nforced to build two foreign factories, one in Canada and one in Sweden.\r\nThe Swedish plant is a small affair as yet, making rakes and mowers only;\r\nbut the Canadian enterprise supports one-tenth of the city of Hamilton,\r\nand holds about half the Canadian trade. Its worst vexation, so far as I\r\ncan tell from a hasty visit, is a lack of Canadian raw materials. Its\r\nchains, bolts, nuts, and canvas aprons come from Chicago, its steel and\r\ncoal from Pittsburg, and three-fourths of its lumber from the Southern\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThe country that perhaps most disturbs the dreams of our harvester\r\ncompanies, is as far as possible from being one of the great nations. It\r\nis scarcely a country at all--only a scrap of coral reef uprisen at the\r\nfoot of Mexico--Yucatan. Yet this is the land on which the United States\r\ndepends for binder twine. Manila fibre we can now get from our new\r\nco-Americans--the Filipinos; but there is never enough of it to supply the\r\nmillions of self-binders. Only sisal-hemp yields abundantly enough. And\r\nYucatan is the only spot in the world where sisal can be grown in\r\ncommercial quantities.\r\n\r\nYucatan is smaller than South Carolina, with not quite the population of\r\nMilwaukee. It was once the poorest of the Central American states; but\r\nsince the arrival of the twine-binder it has become the richest. It sells\r\nfrom fifteen to eighteen million dollars' worth of sisal a year, and the\r\nUnited States buys it all. _Three-fourths of this money is clear profit;\r\nand it is an almost incredible fact that the forty Sisal Kings of Yucatan\r\nhave a larger net income than the owners of the immense International\r\nHarvester Company._\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, the American farmer pays Yucatan $12,000,000 a year for\r\nstring--mere string, which is used once and then flung away. It is an\r\nextortion and a waste, besides being the only un-American factor in the\r\nwhole harvester business.\r\n\r\nHow can we save these twelve millions and completely Americanise the\r\ntrade? This is a problem that William Deering toiled at for twenty years.\r\nThe Harvester Company has a solution. I saw it at St. Paul--a new factory,\r\nwhich twists twine from flax. A farmer's son named George H. Ellis has\r\nfound a quick and cheap way to clean the flax fibre; and at the time I\r\nvisited the factory there were more than three hundred workers at the\r\nspindles. Two million pound of the twine were sold in 1906, so that the\r\nenterprise is no longer an experiment. This means, probably, that the\r\nfarmer of the future will grow his own twine. Instead of yielding tribute\r\nto the forty Sisal Kings of Yucatan, he will pay no more than the charges\r\nof the railroad and the factory. The flax will be his own.\r\n\r\nYucatan is the only cheap-labour country that has been enriched by the\r\nharvester. Elsewhere it is the rule that the common people of the nation\r\nmust reach a certain high level before the harvester trade can begin.\r\nWhere human labour has little value, it is plainly not worth saving.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE ANCIENT FIELDS OF ALGIERS]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the harvester is the best barometer of civilisation. It\r\ncannot go where slavery and barbarism exist. It will not enter a land\r\nwhere the luxury of the city is built on the plunder of the men and women\r\nwho work in the fields. Whoever operates a harvester must not only be\r\nintelligent: he must be free.\r\n\r\nTo hundreds of millions of foreigners, the United States is known as \"the\r\ncountry where the reapers come from.\" They realise, too, that farm\r\nmachinery represents our type of genius, that it springs out of our\r\nnational life, and comes from us as inevitably as song comes from Italy or\r\nsilk from France.\r\n\r\nWhy? Read the history of the United States. This was the first country, so\r\nfar as we can know, where men of high intelligence went to work _en masse_\r\nupon the soil, and under such conditions as compelled them to develop a\r\nhigh degree of mechanical skill. The pioneer American farmer had to be his\r\nown carpenter and blacksmith. He had to build his own house and make his\r\nown harness. Consequently, before this Farmers' Republic was two\r\ngenerations old, the reaper was born in the little workshop behind the\r\nbarn.\r\n\r\nIn the Old World every occupation stood alone and aloof. The mechanics\r\nknew nothing of the farm and the farmer knew nothing of the workshop.\r\n\"Every man to his trade,\" said Europe, Asia, and Africa. But in the New\r\nWorld, where trades and classes and nationalities were flung together in a\r\nheterogenous jumble, there sprang up a race of handy, inventive farmers,\r\nset free from the habits and prejudices of their fathers. They were the\r\nfirst body of men who were competent to solve the problem of farm\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the American harvester is much more than a handy device for\r\ncutting grain. It is the machine that makes democracy possible. It reaches\r\nthe average man, and more--it pushes the ladder of prosperity down so far\r\nthat even the farm labourer can grasp the lowest rung and climb. _It has\r\nbecome one of our national emblems. It is as truly and as exclusively\r\nAmerican as the Stars and Stripes or the Declaration of Independence._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE HARVESTER AND THE AMERICAN FARMER\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the American Farmer went out of business this year he could clean up\r\nthirty thousand million dollars. And he would have to sell his farm on\r\ncredit; for there is not enough money in the whole world to pay him half\r\nhis price.\r\n\r\nTalk of the money-mad Trusts! They might have reason to be mad if they\r\nowned the farms, instead of their watered stock. When we remember that the\r\nAmerican Farmer earns enough in seventeen days to buy out Standard Oil,\r\nand enough in fifty days to wipe Carnegie and the Steel Trust off the\r\nindustrial map, the story of the trusts seems like the \"short and simple\r\nannals of the poor.\"\r\n\r\nOne American harvest would buy the kingdom of Belgium, king and all. Two\r\nwould buy Italy. Three would buy Austria-Hungary. And five, at a spot\r\ncash price, would take Russia from the Czar.\r\n\r\nTalk of swollen fortunes! With the setting of every sun, the money-box of\r\nthe American Farmer bulges with the weight of twenty-four new millions.\r\nOnly the most athletic imagination can conceive of such a torrent of\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\nPlace your finger on the pulse of your wrist and count the heart-beats;\r\none--two--three--four. With every four of those quick throbs, day and\r\nnight, a thousand dollars clatters into the gold-bin of the American\r\nFarmer.\r\n\r\nHow incomprehensible it would seem to Pericles, who saw Greece in her\r\nGolden Age, if he could know that the yearly revenue of his country is now\r\nno more than one day's pay for the men who till the soil of this infant\r\nRepublic!\r\n\r\nOr, how it would amaze a resurrected Christopher Columbus, if he were told\r\nthat the revenues of Spain and Portugal are not nearly as much as the\r\nearnings of the American Farmer's Hen!\r\n\r\nMerely the crumbs that drop from the Farmer's table (otherwise known as\r\nagricultural exports), have brought him in enough of foreign money since\r\n1892, so that he could, if he wished, settle the railway problem once for\r\nall, by buying every foot of railroad in the United States.\r\n\r\nSuch is our New Farmer--a man for whom there is no name in any language.\r\nHe is as far above the farmer of the story-books, as a 1908 touring-car is\r\nabove a jinrikisha. Instead of being an ignorant hoe-man in a barn-yard\r\nworld, he gets the news by daily paper, daily mail, and telephone; and\r\nincidentally publishes seven hundred trade journals of his own. Instead of\r\nbeing a moneyless peasant, he pays the interest on the mortgage with the\r\nearnings of four days, and his taxes with the earnings of a week. Even\r\nthis is less of an expense than it seems, for he borrows the money from\r\nhimself, out of his own banks, and spends the bulk of the tax money around\r\nhis own properties.\r\n\r\nFarming for a business, not for a living--this is the _motif_ of the New\r\nFarmer. He is a commercialist--a man of the twentieth century. He works as\r\nhard as the Old Farmer did, but in a higher way. He uses the four\r\nM's--Mind, Money, Machinery and Muscle; but as little of the latter as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nNeither is he a Robinson Crusoe of the soil, as the Old Farmer was. His\r\nhermit days are over; he is a man among men. The railway, the trolley, the\r\nautomobile and the top buggy have transformed him into a suburbanite. In\r\nfact, his business has become so complex and many-sided, that he touches\r\ncivilisation at more points and lives a larger life than if he were one of\r\nthe atoms of a crowded city.\r\n\r\nAll American farmers, of course, are not of the New variety. The country,\r\nlike the city, has its slums. But after having made allowance for\r\nexceptions, it is still true that the United States is the native land of\r\nthe New Farmer. He is the most typical human product that this country has\r\nproduced, and the most important; for, in spite of its egotistical cities,\r\nthe United States is still a farm-based nation.\r\n\r\nThere could be no cloth-mills without the wool and cotton of the farm; no\r\nsugar factories without beets; no flour-mills without wheat; no\r\nbeef-packing industry without cattle. The real business that is now\r\nswinging the whole nation ahead is not the ping-pong traffic of the Stock\r\nExchanges, but the steady output of twenty millions a day from the fields\r\nand barn-yards. If this farm output were to be cut off, the towering\r\nskyscrapers would fall and the gay palace-hotels would be as desolate as\r\nthe temple of Thebes.\r\n\r\nThe brain-working farmer is the man behind prosperity. That is the Big\r\nFact of recent American history. It is he who pays the bills and holds up\r\nthe national structure in the whirlwind hour of panic. Last year, for\r\ninstance, while banks were tumbling, the non-hysterical farmer was quietly\r\ngathering in a crop that was worth three times all the bank capital in the\r\nUnited States; and since 1902 he and his soil have produced as much new\r\nwealth as would support Uncle Sam, at his present rate of living, for\r\nfifty years.\r\n\r\nWhat was called \"McKinley Prosperity\" was really created by the\r\nagricultural boom of 1897. There had been a general crop failure in\r\nEurope, and the price of wheat had soared above a dollar a bushel. Other\r\nnations paid us twelve hundred millions for farm products; and this\r\nunparalleled inpouring of foreign money made us the richest and busiest\r\nnation in the world.\r\n\r\nThe supreme fact about the American Farmer is that he has always been just\r\nas intelligent and important as anyone else in the Republic. He put\r\nfourteen of his sons in the White House; and he did his full share of the\r\nworking and fighting and thinking and inventing, all the way down from\r\nGeorge Washington to James Wilson.\r\n\r\nHe climbed up by self-help. He got no rebates, nor franchises, nor\r\nsubsidies. The free land that was given him was worthless until he took\r\nit; and he has all along been more hindered than helped by the meddling of\r\npublic officials.\r\n\r\nHis best friend has been the maker of farm-machinery. But this is a family\r\nmatter. Four-fifths of the Harvester Kings were farmers' sons; and the\r\nbiggest harvester factory is only a development of the small workshop that\r\nalways stood beside the barn. There are no two men who are more closely\r\nlinked together by the ties of blood and business than the farmer and the\r\nman who makes his labour-saving machines. Neither one can hurt the other\r\nwithout doing injury to himself.\r\n\r\nThe inventor of the modern plough, Jethro Wood, was a wealthy Quaker\r\nfarmer of New York--a man of such masterful intelligence as to count Clay\r\nand Webster among his friends. The late James Oliver, and David Bradley,\r\none of his greatest competitors, were born and bred near the furrowed\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nMcCormick built his first reaper in a blacksmith shop on a farm. So did\r\nJohn F. Sieberling, William N. Whiteley, Lewis Miller and C. W. Marsh. And\r\nthe man who owned the first of the reaper factories, Dayton S. Morgan,\r\ngrew up amid the stumps of a New York farm.\r\n\r\nThe American Farmer has always grown _ideas_, as well as corn and\r\npotatoes. That is the secret of his prosperity. It was out in the\r\nwheat-fields where the idea of a self-binder flashed upon the brain of\r\nJohn F. Appleby; where Jacob Miller learned to improve the thresher and\r\nGeorge Esterley to build the header and Joseph F. Glidden to invent\r\nbarb-wire.\r\n\r\nBefore 1850 there was some progress among farmers, but it was as slow as\r\nmolasses in Alaska. They were free and independent, and little else. They\r\nhad poor homes, poor farms, poor implements.\r\n\r\nThen came the gold-rush to California. What this event did for farmers and\r\nthe world can scarcely be exaggerated. It opened up the prairies, fed the\r\nhungry banks with money, lured the farm labourers westward, and compelled\r\nthe farmers to use machinery.\r\n\r\nThree years later the Crimean War sent the price of wheat soaring, and the\r\nfarmers had a jubilee of prosperity. Away went the log-cabin, the ox-cart,\r\nthe grain-cradle, and the flail. In came the frame house, the spring\r\nbuggy, the reaper, and the thresher. The farmers began to buy\r\nlabour-saving devices. Better still, they began to invent them.\r\n\r\nThere is one farm-bred man, named R. C. Haskins, in the Harvester Building\r\nin Chicago, who, in his thirty years of salesmanship, has supervised the\r\nselling of $275,000,000 worth of harvesters to American farmers. And as\r\nfor the amount of money represented by our farm machinery of all kinds,\r\nnow in use, it is very nearly a billion dollars--a total that no other\r\nnation can touch.\r\n\r\nTo measure American Farmers by the census is now an outgrown method, for\r\nthe reason that each farmer works with the power of five men. The farm has\r\nbecome a factory. Four-fifths of its work is done by machinery, which\r\nexplains how we can produce one-fifth of the wheat of the world, half of\r\nthe cotton, and three-fourths of the corn, although we are only six per\r\ncent. of the human race.\r\n\r\nThe genie who built Aladdin's palace in a night was the champion hustler\r\nof the fairy tale countries. But he was not so tremendously superior to\r\nthe farm labourer who takes a can of gasolene and cuts fifty cords of wood\r\nin a day, or to the man who milks a herd of sixty cows in two hours, by\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nTo-day farming is not a drudgery. Rather it is a race--an exciting rivalry\r\nbetween the different States. For years Illinois and Iowa have run neck\r\nand neck in the raising of corn and oats. Minnesota carries the blue\r\nribbon for wheat, with Kansas breathless in second place. California has\r\nshot to the front in the barley race. Texas and Louisiana are tied in the\r\nproduction of rice. Kentucky is the tobacco champion; and New York holds\r\nthe record for hay and potatoes.\r\n\r\nTo see the New Farmer at his best, I went to Iowa. No other State has\r\ninvested so much money--sixty millions--in labour-saving machinery, so it\r\ncan fairly claim to be the zenith of the farming world.\r\n\r\nHere there are twenty thousand women and three hundred thousand men who\r\nhave made farming a profession. They are producing wealth at the rate of\r\nfive hundred millions a year, nearly sixteen hundred dollars apiece. How?\r\nBy throwing the burden of drudgery upon machines.\r\n\r\nIowa is not so old; she will be sixty-two, this year. She is not so large;\r\nlittle England is larger. Yet, with her hog-money she could pay the\r\nsalaries of all the monarchs of Europe; and with one year's corn crop she\r\ncould buy out the \"Harvester Trust,\" or build three New York Subways.\r\n\r\nWhen the Indians sold Iowa to Uncle Sam they got about eight cents an\r\nacre. To give the price exactly, to a cent, it was $2,877,547.87. When\r\nthis money was paid, there were statesmen who protested that it was too\r\nmuch. Yet this amount was less than the Iowans got for last year's colts;\r\nit was less than one quarter of the value of the eggs in last years nests.\r\nEvery three months, the Iowa hen pays for Iowa.\r\n\r\nThrough the courtesy of Mr. Harlan, of the Des Moines Historical Society,\r\nI obtained the addresses of nine old settlers, who went into Iowa with\r\nox-carts, before 1850, and who are still living. I found that every one of\r\nthem had remained on the land and was prosperous. The poorest owned\r\n$7,000, the richest $96,000; and their average wealth was $36,000.\r\n\r\nThese fortunes are not made, as in France, by sacrificial economies. The\r\nIowan is noted as a high liver and a good spender. Here, for instance, is\r\nthe menu of a chance supper I enjoyed at the home of an Iowa farmer, nine\r\nmiles from Des Moines: Mashed potatoes, poached eggs, hot biscuits, white\r\nbread, fresh butter, honey, jelly, peaches and cream, gooseberry pie, and\r\ngood coffee--all served on china, with fine linen tablecloth and napkins.\r\nThe man of the house was the son of a rack-rented Irish immigrant, who\r\nhad been reared \"on potatoes and salt, mostly.\"\r\n\r\nI found one young county, born since the Civil War, in which five thousand\r\nfarmers now own property worth seventy-five millions. They have fourteen\r\nthousand horses, seventeen thousand sheep, sixty thousand cattle, and\r\nninety thousand hogs. In the furnishing of the homes in this county, so\r\nits Auditor informs me, more than twenty-five thousand dollars have been\r\nspent on the one item of pianos.\r\n\r\nIn a small, out-of-the-way town, called Ames, I came upon a farmers'\r\ncollege--a veritable Harvard of the soil. Here, on a thousand acres which\r\nfed the wild deer and buffalo in the days of Andrew Jackson, is a college\r\nthat equals Princeton and Vassar combined, in the number of its pupils.\r\nIts farm machinery building is the largest of its kind. Five professors\r\nare in charge, and it is a curious fact, showing how new the New Farmer\r\nis, that these professors are obliged to teach without a text-book. As\r\nyet, there is no such thing in the world as a text-book on farm\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nThe Iowans pay half a million dollars a year to sustain this college. They\r\npay it cheerfully. They pay it with a hurrah. Why? Because it is the\r\nbiggest money-maker in the State. One little professor, named Holden--the\r\nsmallest of the whole hundred and forty, is revered by the Iowans as a\r\nKing Midas of the cornfield. He has shown them how to grow ten bushels\r\nmore per acre, by using a better quality of seed. This one _idea_, in a\r\nState where every fourth dollar is a corn dollar, meant an extra twenty\r\nmillions last year.\r\n\r\nFirst in corn, first in farm machinery, and first in the number of her\r\nbanks! That is Iowa. There are a few of her villages that have no banks,\r\nbut they are conscious of their disgrace. They feel naked and ashamed. In\r\nall, there are as many banks as post-offices, very nearly; and they are\r\ncrammed with enough wealth to build three Panama Canals.\r\n\r\n\"Money is a trifle tight just now,\" said an Iowa banker. This was last\r\nSeptember. \"You see, at this time of year, the farm labourers cause a\r\ndrain on the currency by keeping their wages in their pockets.\" This\r\nsurprising fact did not seem surprising to the banker. He was himself bred\r\non the soil--the son of a farm-hand who had become a rich farmer. But to\r\nthe financiers of Europe, what an incredible thing is this--that the wages\r\nof the farm-labourers should sway the money market up and down.\r\n\r\nThe pride of Iowa is Des Moines, a city of farm-bred people. It is so\r\nyoung that some of its old men remember when wolf-hunting was good where\r\nits one skyscraper stands to-day. It has no ancient history and no\r\nsouvenirs. A little while ago a lot of industrious people came here poor,\r\nand now they are prosperous and still busy--that is the story of Des\r\nMoines in a sentence.\r\n\r\nIn the main hall of the five-domed Capitol at Des Moines is a life-sized\r\npainting of a prairie wagon, hauled by oxen. In such a rude conveyance as\r\nthis most of the early settlers rolled into Iowa, at a gait of two miles\r\nan hour. But there are no prairie wagons now, nor oxen. Ten thousand miles\r\nof railway criss-cross the State, and make more profit in three months\r\nthan all the railways of ancient India made last year.\r\n\r\nInstead of being tax-ridden serfs, these Iowans pay the total\r\nself-governing cost of their Commonwealth by handing over the price of the\r\nsummer's hay. Instead of being the prey of money-lenders, they have made\r\nDes Moines the Hartford of the West, in which forty-two insurance\r\ncompanies carry a risk of half a billion. And so, in each one of its\r\ndetails, the story of these Corn Kings is staggering to a mere\r\ncity-dweller, especially to anyone who has cold storage ideas about\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nBig Men, too, as well as big corn, are grown in Iowa. Here is a sample\r\ngroup--half educators and half statesmen--John B. Grinnell, Henry Smith\r\nWilliams, Albert Shaw, Newell Dwight Hillis, Carl Snyder, Emerson Hough,\r\nHamlin Garland, Senators Allison and Dolliver, Leslie M. Shaw, John A.\r\nKasson, Horace Boies, Governor Albert B. Cummins and our Official\r\nFarmer--James Wilson. There are now fifteen hundred newspaper men in Iowa.\r\n(One of them ships seven carloads of magazines a month.) There are three\r\nhundred and fifty architects, two thousand engineers, five thousand\r\ndoctors, three thousand bankers and brokers, and thirty thousand\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nThese amazing changes have taken place within the memory of men and women\r\nwho are now alive.\r\n\r\n\"I can remember when the first mowing-machine was made in our county,\"\r\nsaid Governor Cummins, who is still far from being a man of years.\r\n\r\n\"I walked eight miles through the forest and sold eggs for three cents a\r\ndozen and butter for four cents a pound,\" said John Cownie--a well-known\r\nfigure at the Des Moines Capitol.\r\n\r\nOne short half-century, and here is the whole paraphernalia of a high\r\ncivilisation--a fruitage which has usually required the long cultivation\r\nof a thousand years.\r\n\r\nAnd Iowa is not a freak State. A traveller hears the same story--from\r\nox-cart to automobile, in almost every region of the prairie West. The\r\nvarious States are only patches of one vast grassy plain where\r\n\r\n         \"painted harvesters, fleet after fleet,\r\n  Like yachts, career through seas of waving wheat.\"\r\n\r\n\"My first experience with the 'New Farmer,' as you call him, was in\r\nTexas,\" said a Kansas City business man. \"I had taken an agency for\r\nharvesters in a section of Texas that was bigger than several dozen\r\nVermonts, and I made my headquarters in a town called Amarillo. The first\r\nmorning I went into the bank to get acquainted. While I was there in came\r\na big, roughly dressed man. 'Come here, Bill,' said the banker. 'Maybe\r\nyou want some farm machinery.'\r\n\r\n\"'Maybe I do,' said the big fellow; so I gave him a catalogue and went on\r\ntalking with the banker.\r\n\r\n\"Ten minutes later the big fellow looked up from the catalogue and\r\nasked--'How much do you want for ten of these binders?' I nearly had a\r\nspell of heart failure, but I gasped the price. He said--'all right; send\r\n'em along.'\r\n\r\n\"'Don't you worry about Bill's credit,' said the banker, seeing I looked\r\ndazed. 'He has more than $100,000 in this bank right now.'\r\n\r\n\"This was my cue to get busy with the big farmer, and before he left the\r\nbank he had bought a thresher, four traction engines and half a dozen\r\nploughs.\"\r\n\r\nHarvesting by machinery has actually become cheaper than the ancient\r\nmethod of harvesting by slaves. This surprising fact was first brought to\r\nthe notice of Europeans during the Chicago World's Fair, when forty-seven\r\nforeign Commissioners were taken to the immense Dalrymple farm in North\r\nDakota. Here they saw a wheat-field very nearly a hundred square miles in\r\nextent, with three hundred self-binders clicking out the music of the\r\nharvest. There were no serfs--no drudges--no barefooted women. And yet\r\nthey were told that the labour-cost of reaping the wheat was LESS THAN A\r\nCENT A BUSHEL.\r\n\r\nIt has now become impossible to reap the world's wheat by hand. As well\r\nmight we try to carry coal from mines to factories in baskets. Merely to\r\nhave gathered in our own cereal and hay of last year's growing, would have\r\nbeen a ten days' job for every man and woman in the United States, between\r\nthe ages of twenty and twenty-six. But even if it had been possible to\r\nreturn to hand-labour, in the production of the world's wheat, the extra\r\ncost would have swollen, last year, to a total of $330,000,000--so I am\r\ntold by a Wisconsin professor who has made a careful study of the costs\r\nof harvesting. This amount is more than equal to the entire revenue of the\r\nInternational Harvester Company, in the five years of its existence.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, the time needed to handle an acre of wheat has been\r\nreduced from sixty-one hours to three, by the use of machinery. Hay now\r\nrequires four hours, instead of twenty-one; oats seven hours, instead of\r\nsixty-six; and potatoes thirty-eight hours, instead of one hundred and\r\nnine.\r\n\r\nIt is machinery that has so vastly increased the size of the average\r\nAmerican farm. In India, where a farmer's whole outfit can be bought for\r\nten dollars, the average farm is half an acre or less. In France and\r\nGermany it is five acres. In England it is nine. But in the United\r\nStates--the home of farm machinery, it is one hundred and fifty acres.\r\n\r\nVery little has been written about this stupendous prosperity of American\r\nfarmers. Why? Because it is so recent. The Era of Big Profits began barely\r\nten years ago. There was a time when the blue-ribbon New Farmer was the\r\nman who grew wheat in the Red River Valley. He was the aristocrat of the\r\nWest. His year's work was no more than a few weeks of ploughing and\r\nsowing, and a few days of harvesting. Even this was done easily, sitting\r\non the seat of a machine and driving a team of splendid horses. After\r\nharvest, he cashed in, carried a big cheque to the bank, and settled down\r\nfor a long loaf or a trip to the old homestead in the East.\r\n\r\nBut it was the bad year of 1893 that first put the farmers, the country\r\nover, on the road to affluence. Up to that time it was their usual policy\r\nto depend upon a single crop. One farmer planted nothing but wheat;\r\nanother planted nothing but corn; a third nothing but cotton; and so on.\r\nBut in 1893 the prices of wheat, corn, and cotton fell so low that the\r\nfarmers' profits were wiped out. This disaster set the farmers thinking;\r\nand in four years they had changed over to the new policy of _Diversified\r\nFarming_.\r\n\r\nInstead of putting all their work upon one crop, they planted from three\r\nto a dozen different crops each year. They manufactured their corn into\r\ncattle. They gave the soil a square deal in the matter of fertilisation.\r\nThey learned to plant better seed and to pay attention to the Weather\r\nBureau. They studied the market reports. And, best of all, they swung over\r\nfrom muscle to machinery, until to-day the value of the machinery on\r\nAmerican farms is fully a thousand millions.\r\n\r\nAll this amazing progress that I have been describing is by no means the\r\nbest that the New Farmer will do. It is merely what he has done by the aid\r\nof machinery. What he will do by the aid of SCIENCE remains to be seen.\r\n\r\nScientific agriculture is young. It has had to wait until machinery\r\nprepared the way, by giving the farmers time to think, and money to spend.\r\nThe first scientist who took notice of farming was the Frenchman,\r\nLavoisier. He found out the composition of water in 1783, and was in the\r\nmidst of many discoveries, when a Paris mob hustled him to the guillotine.\r\nThe famous Liebig next appeared and founded the first agricultural\r\nexperiment station. Then came Berthelot--the father of synthetic\r\nchemistry, with his sensational announcement--\"The soil is alive.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day the New Farmer finds himself touched by Science on all sides. He\r\nknows that there are more living things in one pinch of rich soil than\r\nthere are people on the whole globe. He knows that he can take half a\r\ndozen handfuls of earth from different parts of his farm, mix them\r\ntogether, send one thimbleful to a chemist, and find out exactly the kind\r\nof crop that will give him the best harvest. And more, now that science\r\nhas given him a peep into Nature's factory, he can even feel a sense of\r\nkinship between himself and his acres, because he knows that the same\r\nelements that redden his blood are painting the green hues on his fields\r\nand forests.\r\n\r\nThere are now fifteen thousand New Farmers who have graduated from\r\nagricultural colleges; and since the late Professor W. C. Atwater opened\r\nthe first American experiment station in 1875, fifty others have sprung\r\ninto vigorous life. There is also at Washington an Agricultural Department\r\nwhich has become the greatest aggregation of farm-scientists in the world.\r\nTo maintain this Department Uncle Sam pays grudgingly eleven millions a\r\nyear. He pays much more than this to give food and blankets to a horde of\r\nlazy Indians, or for the building of two or three warships. But it is at\r\nleast more than is being spent on the New Farmer in any other country.\r\n\r\nStep by step farming is becoming a sure and scientific profession. The\r\nrisks and uncertainties that formerly tossed the farmer back and forth,\r\nbetween hope and despair, are being mastered. The Weather Bureau, which\r\nsent half a million warnings last year to the farmers, has already become\r\nso skilful that six-sevenths of its predictions come true. In Kansas,\r\nwheat-growing has become so sure that there has been no failure for\r\nthirteen years. And in the vast South-West, the trick of irrigation is\r\nchanging the man-killing desert into a Farmers' paradise, where there is\r\nnothing so punctual as the crops.\r\n\r\nAlready gasolene engines are in use among the New Farmers. The\r\nInternational Harvester Company made twenty-five thousand of them last\r\nyear at Milwaukee, without supplying the demand. These engines, in the\r\nnear future, will be operated with alcohol, which the farmers can distil\r\nfrom potatoes at a cost of ten cents a gallon. This is no dream, as there\r\nare now six thousand alcohol engines in use on the farms of Germany alone.\r\n\r\nWhen this Age of Alcohol arrives, the making of the New Farmer will be\r\nvery nearly complete. _He will then grow his own power, and know how to\r\nharness for his own use the omnipotence of the soil._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's note:\r\n\r\nText in italics is enclosed by underscores (_italics_).\r\n\r\nOn page 31, the figure \"$1,300,00\" is presented as in the original.\r\n\r\nOn page 106, the image of a triangle has been replaced with [triangle].\r\n\r\nThe following misprints have been corrected:\r\n  \"Doubelday\" corrected to \"Doubleday\" (title page)\r\n  \"Bejamin\" corrected to \"Benjamin\" (page 67)\r\n  \"consistingly\" corrected to \"consisting\" (page 74)\r\n  \"McCormich\" corrected to \"McCormick\" (page 102)\r\n  \"eet\" corrected to \"Meet\" (page 131)\r\n\r\nOther than the corrections listed above, inconsistencies in spelling\r\nand hyphenation usage have been retained.\r\n\r\nPunctuation has been corrected without note.",
