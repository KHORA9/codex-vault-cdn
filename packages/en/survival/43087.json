Having made a study of the work for years, we have seen the\r\nutter impossibility of verbally explaining the many necessary details to\r\nthe \"new men\" each year. We admit lambing ewes in large numbers\r\nsuccessfully is somewhat of a fine art, still common sense, patience and\r\nendurance will allow any one adapted to the care of live stock--which\r\nmeans a person who appreciates the worth and meaning of life in any\r\nform--to lamb sheep. Common sense will permit any one to readily have at\r\nleast some idea of the physical endurance, both as to temperature and\r\nnutrition, of the animal in his care. The patience which enables you to\r\nendure the inclemency of any surrounding for their welfare, is also\r\nnecessary, for it, too, prevents that hostile, or we might say hideous\r\nmood of mind which causes so many people to abuse live stock when it is\r\nabsolutely uncalled for.\r\n\r\nIt should be self-evident to the ordinary person that life in its\r\nbeginning is easily overcome by death; that nature has endowed man with\r\na higher intellect that he may care for that life which in his esteem\r\nhas sufficient worth to justify that care. A providing nature has\r\nendowed the sheep with many desires and inclinations, which, while quite\r\nclear to the naturalist, to the casual observer and shepherd often\r\nappear very contrary. That the sheep is the most contrary animal, other\r\nthan the hog, is an assertion which often comes from a lack of knowledge\r\nof its nature.\r\n\r\nTrue, when unintelligently selected surroundings compel you to howl,\r\nwhistle, and dog it out of its natural contentment, it often becomes\r\ncontrary, but this mood is forced upon it by its environs, of which the\r\nbarking dog and the unintelligent and noisy shepherd are generally the\r\ngreatest fault.\r\n\r\nAllow sheep their natural contentment by leaving them to their own care\r\nwhenever possible. They will then hold themselves to the herd and very\r\nseldom stray off. Tending sheep in this manner will permit them to show\r\nyou their wants and necessities. Provide them when you can, for it pays\r\nthe owner and always lightens your work.\r\n\r\nAlthough sheep will soon become used to the whistling and holloing\r\nshepherd, together with the barking dog, apparently paying little\r\nattention to them, they do, nevertheless, fret, causing them to roughen\r\nand lose in flesh. We have seen sheep become so thin by such treatment\r\nthat they were actually too weak to follow the herd longer. They will\r\nalways do their best to stray away from such surroundings. Sheep know\r\nthe intelligent shepherd never whistles, hollos, or rushes the dog at\r\nthem unless it is absolutely necessary, and they very readily mind such\r\na person.\r\n\r\nSurely it is not the sheep that is at fault when the shepherd selects as\r\ntheir pasture, during a stormy day, a bleak flat or mesa, where the\r\nsheep in their discontent are compelled to run around seeking shelter or\r\nto maintain their warmth, vexing the herder, causing him to dog them\r\nseverely.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGINNING.\r\n\r\nShould you have plenty of pasture, put your dropping ewes upon the\r\nlambing ground 143 days after the rams were first with them. This gives\r\nthem a little time to locate, their dropping time not being up until the\r\n145th day. If lambing upon the open range, two or three good, live men\r\nto each 1,000 ewes will be necessary, while for shed lambing there\r\nshould be four or five for that number of ewes. In each case the amount\r\nof help necessary depends upon the range and method of lambing. The men\r\nshould have enough clothing and bedding to be out in all kinds of\r\nweather without chilling. Inform them that abusing the sheep by using\r\nthe crook as a club, dogging, or otherwise, will not help you nor ease\r\ntheir work in the least. Truly, the man worth while in a lambing camp is\r\n\"the man who can smile when everything goes dead wrong\"--the man who\r\nsees many things and can find the time, the way, and the will, to better\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDo not bed dropping ewes upon steep hillsides, where they will cast\r\nthemselves during or before lambing. It may often become necessary to\r\nbed small bunches out by themselves; this gives the coyote a great\r\nchance to do his work. To keep him and other predatory animals away\r\nduring the night, it is well to have firecrackers, fuse, or powder,\r\nscare-crows and lanterns on hand. To catch and chain a live coyote out\r\nupon the lambing ground has been the most effective scare-crow the\r\nwriter has ever used to keep coyotes from the lambing range. As a\r\ndisinfectant for bites, cuts, sores and maggots, have carbolic acid,\r\nturpentine, or some good creosote sheep dip. Marking materials are also\r\nvery handy at times to mark certain ewes and lambs. The remedies given\r\nhere for the treatment of ailments generally found at lambing time are\r\nnot those found at a drug store twenty miles away, but, rather, those\r\ncamp necessities which are most always at hand. They have proven their\r\nmerit and can be relied upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DROP BAND.\r\n\r\nPut the best man you have with your dropping ewes. He should have a\r\ncool temper, good feet, and the will to use them. Each day he should\r\nhave a sheep crook and some quarter-inch rope with him. The sheep should\r\nhave salt or salt feed enough to be contented. Water them once a day\r\nduring dry weather; on rainy days they will feed better when not given\r\nwater. In bunch lambing, where the new-born lambs are with the dropping\r\newes all the time, 700 ewes are enough to the band, while if you lamb by\r\nthe dropping system, where you part the new-born lambs and their mothers\r\nfrom the dropping ewes several times each 24 hours, you may have up to\r\n4,000 ewes in the drop band. This is not advisable where your range is\r\nclosed in or short on feed or water. Upon such a range 1,500 ewes are\r\nenough to the band. Have them bedded in the warmest places at night. In\r\nnice weather let them leave the bed ground as early as possible, while\r\nin bad weather--if you have them on a good bed ground--let them remain\r\nas long as they wish. Never hold them on the bed ground in the morning\r\nby rushing them back with a dog when they are ready to leave. By so\r\nmixing the ewes you will \"bum\" lambs dropped during the night. On bad\r\ndays put them in the warmest places, behind hills, in high brush, or any\r\nother good shelter you may have near at hand, which will keep the\r\nnew-born lambs out of the wind. During warm and pleasant days let them\r\nout well in the morning hours, then hold them up a few hours on good\r\nfeed, turning them toward camp and water early in the afternoon, so that\r\nthe lambs dropped in the evening hours will be near camp, where they\r\nwill not have to be moved.\r\n\r\nShould your range allow you to change the bed ground each night, while\r\nthe lambs are coming fast, it is best to do so. When the range is so\r\nsituated that you cannot move camp each day, compelling you to move the\r\newes with lambs off the bed ground, so the dropping ewes may bed in the\r\nsame place again, try not to move them until about the time the droppers\r\ncome in around camp in the evening, say about 4 p. m. Do not move them\r\nfarther than is necessary to keep them from mixing with the drop band\r\nduring the night. Before the ewes bed down for the night, catch all ewes\r\nthat appear sick and have not been on feed or wish to be alone, not\r\ncaring to follow the herd longer. Such ewes likely have a dead lamb in\r\nthem. Watch for such ewes during the day and take the lamb from them\r\nbefore blood poison kills the ewe. Safeguard yourself and the ewe, if\r\nconvenient, by disinfecting your hands before and after doing this.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORKING THE BED GROUND.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a critical time for many shepherds. Some persons\r\nbecome greatly provoked trying to hold the new-born lambs and their\r\nmothers apart from the dropping ewes, as the latter leave the bed ground\r\nin the morning. Shepherds who rush among the ewes and lambs, in order to\r\nmove the dropping ewes off the bed ground in the morning, will make\r\nthemselves much work, but will never bring out a good per cent of lambs,\r\nas ewes having dropped their lambs during the night are always somewhat\r\nuneasy and excited when the herd leaves in the morning. It is indeed the\r\nheight of folly to rush among them, causing them to run away from their\r\nnew-born lambs in their excitement. Allow the dropping ewes to leave at\r\ntheir will; do not drive them off; all ewes that have not dropped will\r\nfollow the herd if you will only give them time. Should a few ewes take\r\ntheir lambs and try to follow the herd, let them go a few hundred yards\r\nbefore you try to cut them back. Should there be one or two granny ewes\r\ntrying to steal lambs, leave them, rather than rush among the others.\r\nWait a few hours until the lambs become dried and the ewes overcome\r\ntheir excitement, before working the bed ground.\r\n\r\nAllow all ewes that have dead lambs in them, or those unable to drop\r\ntheir lambs, to follow the dropping ewes off the bed ground; then hold\r\nup the herd, catch the ewes and pull the lambs from them. At this time,\r\nalso, catch all ewes that may have left their lambs on the bed ground\r\nand turn them back, so they may pick them up. Look over the bed ground\r\nduring the day for big-teat ewes, weak and \"bummed\" lambs. Should you\r\nhave any \"bum\" lambs, mother them on ewes that have had dead lambs. It\r\nis probable that the ewes you pulled the dead lambs from would like to\r\nmother the \"bums.\"\r\n\r\nKeep ALL dogs away while working bed grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHERING THE DROP.\r\n\r\nDo not gather new-born lambs during snow or rain storms when they are\r\nin good shelter. It is always best, where possible, to leave the\r\nnew-born lambs where they drop the first 12 to 24 hours. This can be\r\ndone--where you have them in good enough shelter for the night--by\r\nrounding up the outside of the day's drop just a little, then place a\r\ntepee with a lantern in it in the center of the bunch, a few\r\nfirecrackers, with here and there a scarecrow around the outer sides, or\r\nhave a man sleep near them to keep off coyotes. The ewes will generally\r\nbunch themselves by moving up around the tepee during the night. If they\r\nmust be moved to shelter, or for other reasons, let the men start to\r\nmove the oldest of the day's drop of lambs as soon as the droppers start\r\nback toward camp or water in the afternoon, always moving the oldest to\r\nthe youngest when convenient to do so. Do not allow anyone to move lambs\r\nwhen wet or too young, unless it is necessary to put them into shelter.\r\nIn that case, try to move them before the storm, rather than after they\r\nbecome wet. New-born lambs still wet, or having become wet by storm,\r\nrubbing together, sometimes change their scent, so that quite a number\r\nof their mothers become suspicious of them and will not allow them to\r\nsuck until they become dried, before which time they may die. We have\r\nalso on several occasions seen ewes become skeptical of their lamb after\r\nhaving cleaned it, simply because the lamb had come in contact with the\r\ncleanings of other ewes.\r\n\r\nWhen it is necessary to move new-born lambs, move them slowly and gently\r\nto the nearest good shelter. In no case is it advisable to carry lambs\r\naround in gunny-sack-full lots. By so doing you are likely to \"bum\" more\r\nlambs than you save. Tie or pen all ewes that do not own their lambs\r\nuntil they do own them. Be sure you are putting THEIR lambs with them.\r\nWhen you have placed the day's drop in good shelter, when you are most\r\nsure they are well protected from predatory animals, let them remain\r\nquiet for the night. The next morning have someone move them to water.\r\nMix them, when you have to, according to the \"table\" of these rules. Do\r\nnot rush the bunches together; get them close to one another, then let\r\nthem mix themselves. Watch the badger holes. Lambs generally crawl into\r\nholes during the cool of night, in hot, sunny days, and during cold,\r\nrainy weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIXING TO MAKE UP HERDS.\r\n\r\nIt is always best to have your two-year-old ewes mixed with the older\r\newes during their first lambing. However, this should be given\r\nconsideration in the mixing of the young lambs, of which the following\r\ntable will give you a very good idea. Do not drop more at any one place\r\nthan the table allows. Should the drop be heavier than this during the\r\nnight hours, cut the drop band in two for a few days. In the following\r\ntable we count ewes only, and it is always best for your per cent to\r\nhave less if it is convenient to keep them apart longer:\r\n\r\n                      _The Table._\r\n\r\n     Lambs,             Mixed twos         Old ewes\r\n    hours old         and older ewes       straight\r\n\r\n     1 to 24           120 or less        150 or less\r\n    24 to 48           200 or less        250 or less\r\n    3 days or more     350 or less        450 or less\r\n\r\nFrom this time on they should be left until they are the following age,\r\nwhen they can be mixed as follows: As ewes know their lambs by scent\r\nonly during the first four to six days, it should be readily understood\r\nthat it might become impossible for the ewe to find her lamb should you\r\nbunch them sooner than these tables allow, making you many worthless\r\nlambs.\r\n\r\n     Lambs 4 to 6 days old (youngest must be 4 days old), 650 to the\r\n     band.\r\n\r\n     Lambs 8 to 12 days old (youngest must be 8 days old), 1,300 to the\r\n     band.\r\n\r\nThe above for mixed twos and older ewes. When the herds are made up\r\nentirely of ewes past two years old use the following table:\r\n\r\n     Lambs 4 to 6 days old (youngest must be 4 days old), 750 to the\r\n     band.\r\n\r\n     Lambs 8 to 12 days old (youngest must be 8 days old), 1,500 to the\r\n     band.\r\n\r\nThese tables should be considered well any time you do any mixing to\r\nmake up herds. Where you have good feed and water, they will prove very\r\nsuccessful. However, as ewes can and will suckle their lambs more\r\nreadily while in small bands, the development of the lamb will be much\r\nmore rapid where you are not compelled to bunch them too soon. Let these\r\nlamb bunches remain quiet as much as you possibly can. If your feed is\r\npoor around the water and the ewes have to leave their lambs to find\r\nfeed, do not mix so soon nor so many. It may be advisable to move the\r\ndroppers along a little faster, and by so doing you will leave more feed\r\nbehind for the ewes with lambs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCKING OR TRIMMING LAMBS.\r\n\r\nLambs should be docked when from six to twelve days old, when\r\nconvenient in bands of not more than 700. For several reasons it is best\r\nto trim them on a cool day before they move around much in the morning.\r\nAvoid trimming in the heat of the day. Docking lambs in old corrals is\r\ndangerous, because it is unsanitary--many lambs are likely to die if\r\nleft standing in old corrals after being cut at docking time. Turn each\r\nlamb over the fence and out to pasture as you dock it and you will avoid\r\nthis trouble. When you can so arrange, it is best to leave these trimmed\r\nbunches where they are the balance of the day. At least do not overheat\r\nthem by rushing them around, either before or after trimming. Let them\r\nrest a while.\r\n\r\nWe have used a knife in tailing lambs for years, but find they become a\r\nfew pounds heavier during the summer season when seared, so advise the\r\nuse of searing tongs to do the tailing. Keep these tongs red hot, so\r\nthey will sear and stop all blood. To sear lambs, the docking corral is\r\narranged the same as when you dock with the knife. You simply have an\r\nextra man, who places a stove or builds a fire to the right of the\r\nperson doing the ear-marking and castrating. In this fire or stove the\r\ntongs are kept hot, and as the party doing the trimming passes the lamb\r\nto the right--the catcher still holding it--along the cutting board,\r\nthis extra man has the tongs ready to part the tails. One heating of the\r\ntongs will sear and part the tails of four or five lambs. You should,\r\nhowever, have at least two or three pairs of these tongs. They are sold\r\nat Chicago.\r\n\r\nIf, after a few days, two or three of your largest lambs become sick,\r\nbleed them a little by cutting them under the tail stub. Use a solution\r\nof 100 parts water to one part creosote sheep dip, or the same solution\r\nof carbolic acid, as a wash to swab wether lambs. This will disinfect\r\nall cuts and keep flies from them. You will also save many lambs that\r\nhave been snagged, dog or coyote bitten, by disinfecting them at once,\r\nor within a few hours, with either of these solutions. In castrating\r\nyoung lambs, cut the scrotum or sack off about one-half inch from end,\r\nthen pinch tight above the testicles and draw them. Part the tails at\r\nabout the lower end of skin on inside of tail. At this time herd-mark\r\neach full band of ewes and their lambs distinctly with a separate mark,\r\nso they can be parted in case they mix with another band during the\r\nsummer season.\r\n\r\n\r\nPULLING LAMBS--EVERSION OF WOMB.\r\n\r\nIn pulling lambs from ewes, try to attend to such ewes before the lamb\r\nis dead. Get the legs out first; pull slowly and be careful not to\r\njerk--you may pull the lamb bed out of the ewe if you do. Should you do\r\nthis, or should you find a ewe with her womb cast, it can be replaced by\r\nraising her hind parts and slowly forcing the womb back, inserting the\r\nparts until the whole womb is turned in its proper shape and is in its\r\nnatural position. Tie her left hind foot to a bush, or something,\r\nallowing her six to eight feet of rope; leave her for an hour, and her\r\npulling will keep the parts in place until they become set. Where the\r\nparts have become dirty, they should be brushed clean with a clean brush\r\nor rag. Do not wash with water. Inject or insert with a soft rag a few\r\ndrops of a 10 per cent solution of carbolic acid. When the lamb is in\r\nhis natural position he will arrive with his head and front feet first,\r\ngiving the ewe little trouble, unless the shoulder or withers are\r\nabnormally large. When the head is swollen, or one foot is still back,\r\nit is certain the ewe needs assistance at once. Nearly all lambs coming\r\nwith their hind legs or tail first must be pulled; do this as soon as\r\nyou notice it. Never neglect ewes laboring more than one hour. If they\r\nhave not had the lamb in this time, it is absolutely necessary to take\r\nthe lamb from them or it will be dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWINS: THEIR CARE--DEAD LAMBS.\r\n\r\nWhen a ewe has twins and is not willing or able to care for them both,\r\ntry to find a ewe with a dead lamb; take the hide off the dead lamb by\r\ncase skinning, cutting the hind legs off at the second joint from the\r\nfoot, then open the skin between the hind legs, pull what is left of the\r\nlegs up through this opening, then pull the hide back over the body. Cut\r\noff the front legs the same way, then pull the hide down over the neck\r\nto the head; cut it off there. This will cover the live lamb all except\r\nthe head and opening you made in taking off the hide. Over these exposed\r\nparts rub the entrails of the skinned lamb. Do not make the lamb red\r\nwith blood, for the ewe may scare from it. Always put the hide on the\r\nsmallest of the twins, leaving the best one with its own mother. The\r\nhide should be left on no longer than is necessary to make the ewe own\r\nthe lamb, which is generally about 24 hours. In real warm weather, when\r\nflies give trouble, it may prove best not to bother with the hide\r\nmethod, but simply cut the entrails out of the dead lamb and rub them\r\nwell all over the motherless lamb, so the ewe that had the dead lamb\r\nwill take it from the scent. In most cases where the ewe has not had the\r\nopportunity of seeing or smelling her own lamb at birth, she will accept\r\nany NEWLY born lamb the same as she would her own without using either\r\nof the above methods. Nearly all ewes with much milk will take to such\r\nlambs quickly, while those with little milk are not easily \"fooled.\" By\r\neither of the above methods it is best to keep the ewe tied or penned\r\nuntil you are sure she does own the strange lamb. Experienced help will\r\ngenerally know by the action of the ewe just when to turn her loose with\r\nher adopted lamb. Still, unless she has good feed and water while so\r\ntied or penned, she will dry up in a few days, when it becomes\r\nimpossible for her to mother the \"bum.\" Extra good mothers dropping\r\ntheir lambs near others at times become over-anxious and claim lambs\r\nbelonging to other ewes, making it look like \"twins or better.\" Do not\r\nbe fooled, but single such ewes out with their lamb and put her stolen\r\nlamb or lambs with their right mothers. GET THE RIGHT MOTHERS. Keep your\r\ntwinned ewes on good feed and water, also by themselves, if you expect\r\nthem to raise you two good lambs. At least try not to put them in large\r\nbunches until they are at least 10 or 12 days old.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFORMED AND ALKALIED LAMBS.\r\n\r\nMost deformed lambs, born with twisted legs, can be cured quickly by\r\ntying the deformed parts as near as possible in their natural position\r\nfor a day or two. Lambs born with their eyelids too large may be cured\r\nby taking a pair of scissors or a sharp pocket knife and cutting a small\r\nslice or slit horizontally out of the abnormal eyelid, when they will\r\nshrink nearly to their normal size, allowing the lamb to open its eyes.\r\n\r\nBlack alkali is very deadly to sheep, and especially to young lambs.\r\nIts effects seem to be so sudden that there is little chance for a cure.\r\nKeep the young lambs away from all alkali beds and especially from black\r\nalkali holes during wet weather.\r\n\r\nWhite alkali is not so fatal, yet many good shepherds lose lambs by\r\nallowing them to nibble around alkali beds. Should you have some of\r\nthese alkalied lambs or sheep, treat them at once by giving the lambs\r\none-quarter cupful of vinegar, followed in one hour with three\r\ntablespoonsful of raw linseed oil. Sheep should be given one cup of\r\nvinegar and one-quarter cup linseed oil. Most sheep sick from this\r\nailment will have a white alkali substance adhering to their nostrils.\r\n\r\nWhere a lamb has no movement of the bowels, give one tablespoonful of\r\nmolasses and raw linseed oil, mixed. When troubled with too much bowel\r\nmovement, give one tablespoonful ginger and flour, mixed, once each day\r\nin both cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE AND SPOILED UDDERS.\r\n\r\nSee that all lambs too weak to get up are suckled. That all ewes with\r\nlarge udders are caught and milked out. Catch them without rushing them\r\ninto a bunch of ewes and young lambs. If you can't, let them go until\r\nyou can--watch for this opportunity. Tie or pen them up until the udder\r\nbecomes normal and the lamb can get the teat without help. Many ewes\r\nhaving spoiled udders will come to good milk in a few days, if milked\r\nout well two or three times daily.\r\n\r\nWhen the ewe has a caked udder, or is troubled with what is commonly\r\nknown as \"blue bag,\" treat her at once--for she will die if you\r\ndon't--by milking out what you can. Then mix one pint of coaloil with\r\ntwo gallons of hot water, wrap the udder with a heavy rag wet with this\r\nmixture; let it remain for ten minutes, remove, and rub with a mixture\r\nof turpentine and lard, or a weak solution of creosote sheep dip or\r\ncarbolic acid. Repeat this treatment each morning and you will surely\r\nsave the ewe in a few days. Where the ewe has her udder spoiled on one\r\nside only, the milk being good on the other, she is likely to raise her\r\nlamb. However, all these ewes should be marked, so they may be disposed\r\nof in the fall shipment. When a ewe has \"bummed\" her lamb because she\r\nhas a spoiled udder, take the lamb from her before it becomes too weak,\r\nor dies; find a ewe with a dead lamb, then try to force the \"bummed\"\r\nlamb upon her as described under twins and their care.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAILING EWES AND LAMBS--\"RUNBACKS.\"\r\n\r\nMoving ewes and their lambs from one location to another often brings\r\nconsiderable loss to the owner. Where he has long drives to get to his\r\nsummer range, he is not only likely to lose many lambs, but will lose\r\nconsiderable in flesh. Lambs are parted too much from their mothers, and\r\ncannot get enough sleep while on the trail. The shepherd should do his\r\nutmost and use all the care possible to avoid dropping lambs behind,\r\nunder brush, in holes, or otherwise. The best of men lose lambs while\r\ntrailing from one part of the range to another; still this does not make\r\nit a necessary evil. With due care this loss can be avoided. Try to do\r\nyour trailing in the cool of early morning and late evening hours. Move\r\nthem gently, so most of the ewes can tote their lambs along by their\r\nside. You will get along quite well this way, for the ewes will then not\r\ntrouble you trying to run back to hunt lambs. Do not overheat or weaken\r\nyour lambs by continual dogging. If you must drive them rapidly, use\r\nrattle cans. This noise will not only keep them on their feet, but will\r\nscare them along much faster than a barking dog that always turns your\r\nleaders back on you. Rattle cans will always startle young lambs out of\r\nthe brush much quicker than any dog when it is necessary to move them.\r\nIt sometimes takes two or three hours for all the ewes in a large band\r\nto find their lambs after being trailed. Until these ewes have all found\r\ntheir lambs there is danger of a \"runback\" should you leave them. Ewes\r\nwill invariably become excited and run back to where they saw their\r\nlambs last whenever they miss them. Avoid this extra work, and the\r\nhardship on the ewes and lambs, by watching them until all the ewes have\r\nfound their lambs whenever you have moved them. Losing lambs while\r\ntrailing will generally cause the ewe to become sick with spoiled udder\r\nor \"blue bag.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL MIXING.\r\n\r\nWe have seen men try to separate ewes and lambs that have become mixed\r\nthrough their carelessness, or by accident, before the boss got around,\r\ncausing heavy loss. Warn the men never to try this; they never, or very\r\nseldom, can part them straight. In a mix of this kind--we trust there\r\nwill not be any--by all means try to leave the ewes quiet; hold them\r\nstill a few hours, not too close, so each ewe can single out her lamb\r\nand become contented. This gives other ewes a chance to find their lambs\r\nwithout running from one part of the range to another. When these mixed\r\nbunches are not rushed and pushed around they will likely straighten\r\nthemselves out with as few \"bums\" as possible under such conditions.\r\nShould a mix of this kind make more than a full band, the owner or\r\nforeman should put a light slat corral around the bunch (this can be\r\ndone quicker than moving them to a distant corral), then counting out\r\nthe number of ewes over and above a normal herd. He should spend\r\nconsiderable time watching these ewes call their lambs out through \"lamb\r\nholes\" made in all parts of the corral.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIXING, SHELTER, COYOTES, BADGER HOLES.\r\n\r\nTo keep each bunch of ewes and lambs from mixing with another bunch; to\r\nhave them in good shelter during any storm; to milk out ewes with large\r\nteats and suckle their lambs until they are able to take the teat\r\nthemselves, are respectively the most important work for lambing hands.\r\nIt will be well to keep the men reminded that they will do much, indeed,\r\nfor you and the sheep by being \"on the job\" at all times. The sheep may\r\nneed their attention any moment; they may mix at any time; coyotes are\r\nnever all asleep; there may be a lamb in a hole that should be pulled\r\nout before the ewe loses it; a lamb may have become clogged behind and\r\nneed cleaning; an oncoming storm may make it necessary to place and hold\r\nthem in shelter until it has passed. A live, watchful person is worth\r\nmuch indeed at lambing time. A sleepy-head has little value around sheep\r\nat any time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORETELLING WEATHER--ALMANACS, BAROMETERS.\r\n\r\nAlthough general storms are expected by everyone, they are considered\r\nan abnormal condition. Severity is seldom guarded against, which has\r\noften brought much loss at lambing time. Such storms may compel you to\r\nmake many changes, depending upon their duration and severity. They will\r\ntest the quality of your endurance. Stay with the ship and save the\r\nlambs. The necessary changing of position may make much extra work for\r\neveryone. Necessity is the origin of achievement. With your persistent\r\npatience, together with your best mental effort, you will come out of\r\nthe storm with most of the lambs, giving you the baa! baa! as their\r\nthanks. As an illustration, perhaps the reader may pardon the following\r\ntrue story: Some years ago while trailing two bands of ewes upon the\r\ndesert, we, by mishap, became short of camp water. However, necessity\r\nstrengthened our observing power, causing us to find a ledge of rock at\r\nthe side of which grew a few wild rose bushes. Here with no little\r\nperseverance we dug until we found sufficient water for camp, making a\r\nwatering place for others where it was always thought impossible for\r\nwater to be. Who can say, had it been absolutely necessary to water the\r\nsheep, also, that we might not have made a pump out of the stove pipe, a\r\nhandle out of the wagon tongue, a trough out of the wagon box, and with\r\nthis invention watered the two bands of ewes also? After many years of\r\nclose observation of weather conditions, during all seasons of the year,\r\nwe are able to give you valuable information upon the weather you may\r\nexpect SOME TIME during the seven days following any of the moon's\r\nchanges. We cannot say upon what exact date certain weather changes will\r\ntake place, but do state the weather that is most likely to predominate\r\nduring any of the moon's phases. When the new moon in any month comes in\r\nupon his back, these storms will be more severe than when it comes in\r\nstanding up. The Indian had no powder horn. When the moon is moving from\r\nsouth to north it seldom fails to bring warmth, while it hardly ever\r\nfails to bring cold weather upon its return from the north. You should\r\nhave a reliable almanac, giving the exact time of each of the moon's\r\nchanges in the standard time of your locality. A storm-glass or\r\nbarometer will keep you posted 24 to 36 hours before any weather change.\r\nThis may save you lambs. This table can be used any part of the year,\r\nallowing for snow in winter where the calculations foretell rain in\r\nsummer. If the new moon, first quarter, full moon, or last quarter come\r\nin during the time given, the weather most likely to follow SOME TIME\r\nduring the next seven days will be as follows:\r\n\r\n     12 midnight to 2 a. m.--Fair days, cold nights.\r\n\r\n     2 a. m. to 8 a. m.--Cold and rainy.\r\n\r\n     8 a. m. to 2:30 p. m.--Windy or heavy rains.\r\n\r\n     2:30 p. m. to 6 p. m.--Fair and warm.\r\n\r\n     6 p. m. to 12 p. m.--Fair days, cold nights.\r\n\r\nWe have found the new moon most likely to bring an exception to this\r\nrule, still we assure you this table is worth your consideration during\r\nall seasons of the year. Keep your lambs in shelter during severe storms\r\nby reading a good almanac and watching this table.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERDING, DOGS AND FEED.\r\n\r\nThe good shepherd is not born every day. A quiet, unexcitable mental\r\ncharacteristic is the utmost necessity. Nervous, excitable people become\r\ntoo easily angered; they will wear themselves and the sheep out with\r\nover-work and abuse, while the overly sentimental person becomes too\r\neasily disheartened; others have to do his work while he stands around\r\ntelling you in a sorrowful tone how it broke his heart to see that poor\r\ntwin lamb die, during which time other lambs in his care are dying from\r\nhis neglect. He is the first to give up the ship when \"everything goes\r\ndead wrong.\" Most ewes, and especially two-year-olds, are very timid and\r\neasily frightened from their lambs when left out by themselves or in\r\nsmall bunches. For this and other reasons it is best to have few dogs\r\nupon a lambing ground, especially around the dropping ewes. If any, they\r\nshould be in care of experienced men only, for whom they may head off a\r\nbad mix or find a lamb in a hole, etc. Inexperienced men never watch\r\ntheir dogs close enough, when the very best of dogs will scare many ewes\r\nfrom their lambs, even though they are not very near them. So if you can\r\ncontrol the bunches without the aid of dogs, it will always help your\r\nper cent to do so. Again, it will be well to remind the help that they\r\nare on a lambing ground, where it takes much cool temper and many hard\r\nknocks to make things go right at times. Inform them that it is not\r\nalways possible to fatten the ewes during lambing, so they will not run\r\nthe drop band, or the ewes with lambs, all over the country each day\r\nlooking for feed. True, they should be allowed to scatter and spread\r\nover their allotted pasture; but we once heard an owner tell a \"new man\"\r\nto take the sheep out on good range and allow them to \"cover all the\r\nground possible.\" The next day we met this shepherd (?) about three\r\nmiles from his camp, dogging his sheep from one part of the range to\r\nanother. When asked where he was going, he answered that \"the boss had\r\ntold him to let them cover all the ground possible\" and that he was\r\ndoing the best he could to get over all the ground. Needless to say that\r\nthe boss is the loser when his flocks are tended in such a manner.\r\n\r\nThe lamb needs milk, and the ewe needs feed to produce it, but the lambs\r\nalso need much sleep and rest to make them grow fast. Rather have the\r\newes near water and upon less feed until the lambs become at least ten\r\ndays old.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHED LAMBING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor early or shed lambing the following illustrations will give a\r\ngood idea of the individual pens, of which there should be about 70 for\r\neach 1,000 ewes. These pens are about three and one-half feet long and\r\n32 inches wide. The panels and gates are 3 feet high and are made of 1\r\nby 4-inch boards; the panels being made exactly 7 feet long, and the\r\ngates 32 inches wide. At each end on both sides of the panels is nailed\r\na 1 by 2-inch strip to space the 4-inch boards, as follows: Bottom\r\nspace, 2½ inches; second space, 3 inches; third space, 5 inches;\r\nfourth space, 6 inches. To partition the panels at the center, we use 16\r\nor 20-foot boards, as follows: Bottom space, 4-inch board notched ¾\r\ninch on top and bottom sides, at each cross section of panels; second\r\nspace, 4-inch board notched ½ inch at each cross section of panels;\r\nthird space, water trough, 4 inches deep, 8 inches wide; fourth space,\r\n8-inch board notched 1 inch at each cross section of panel. The panel\r\nhas a 6-inch board nailed upright at each outer end. This makes the\r\nslide for the gate to pass up and down in, also holding it in place. On\r\ntop of the panel notched in ¾ inch is a 2-inch strip passing parallel\r\nwith the gates, but over the panels. This strip stops the gates from\r\nfalling inward. As there are no nails used in these top strips nor in\r\nthe boards which make the partition through the center, these pens are\r\neasily collapsed and removed, should the shed be used for other purposes\r\nduring other seasons of the year. To the sides are fastened gunny sacks\r\nto hold feed for each ewe. On top at center is an 8-inch walking board,\r\nover which the attendants may pass without disturbing dropping ewes in\r\nother parts of the shed. To clean the water trough when it becomes dirty\r\nthere is an endless ¼-inch rope passing through the trough and over\r\nthe pens; to this are attached rags or gunny sacks, which are drawn\r\nthrough the trough. Tacked to the top board of panel in each pen there\r\nis a small canvas sack containing three different colored small rags or\r\nflags to indicate whether the ewe claims her lamb, has twins, large\r\nudder, or is ready to turn out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE \"PULLMAN.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the lamb wagon, which brings the ewe and lamb to the shed from\r\nthe pasture during the day. It is made of the same material as the\r\nindividual pens above described, placed upon a low running gear, with a\r\nfloor made of 1½-inch boards, with a 2 by 2-inch strip along each\r\nside to firmly hold the pens from any lateral or side motion. There are\r\nseven pens on each side, 14 in all. To each gate and over the top and\r\nends of the pens is tacked heavy canvas to exclude all rains and winds\r\nfrom the newly born lambs while they are being hauled from pasture to\r\nshed. Upon the range the ewe and lamb are sheltered during storms with a\r\nsmall \"sheep tepee\" until the \"Pullman\" arrives, which insures continual\r\nwarmth for the lamb until he is placed in the shed. There is feed for\r\nthe ewe in sacks in each of the 14 pens. Indicating flags or rags are\r\nhung on small nails on each gate to show the attendant at the shed, when\r\nthe wagon arrives, the character of each ewe, that he may intelligently\r\ncare for her and her lamb at once. The dimensions are: Length of floor,\r\n14 feet; width of floor, 7 feet; length of panel, 6 feet 8 inches; width\r\nof gate, 22 inches; height of pens, 3 feet. This allows each ewe a space\r\n39 inches long and 22 inches wide. Such a wagon will cost complete about\r\nfifty dollars. It will do the work for about 2,500 dropping ewes, when\r\nthey are not pastured much more than one mile from the lambing shed.\r\n\r\nThe attendants at the shed, after unloading the wagon and placing each\r\newe in an individual pen, see that each lamb is suckled; also that the\r\newe has plenty of good clean feed and water until she is ready to turn\r\nout and mix with other ewes and lambs, according to the table of these\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt may be necessary to keep obstinate ewes, that will not claim their\r\nlamb, penned for three or four days; it is not advisable to hold them\r\nlonger, as they will dry up unless you have good milk-producing feed.\r\nMost ewes and their lambs can be numbered and turned out in small\r\nbunches of say fifty head, after they have been in the individual pens\r\n24 hours. They can thus be kept in separate yards around the main\r\nlambing shed for three or more days. Here the attendant can watch them;\r\nshould any of the ewes refuse their lambs, they can be easily picked out\r\nby their number and returned to the single pen. After the lambs are four\r\nor five days old they can be placed in bands of three hundred and\r\nremoved to other parts of the pasture, where there is good shelter, or,\r\nbetter, where there are other small sheds that will accommodate such\r\nsmall bunches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT WORK.\r\n\r\nSome owners have one or two men working among their dropping ewes all\r\nnight when shed lambing. These men remove the new-born lambs and their\r\nmothers from the dropping ewes as soon as they drop. This method is very\r\nhard on the ewes; it breaks their rest. After being worked this way for\r\neight or ten nights, all ewes not in extra good condition, together with\r\nthose heavy with twins, will become very weak; many of them will dry up\r\nin milk and become unable to raise a lamb. A much better system is to\r\npartition the dropping ewes off with panels each night when they come\r\ninto the shed, allowing about 150 to each compartment or lot. Thus there\r\nwill be but few lambs to care for in each lot in the morning; these can\r\nbe readily removed when turning out the ewes. This permits the ewes to\r\nconserve their strength for the sick spell, with a good rest at night.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAGS.\r\n\r\nDuring this lambing the sheep generally still carry their wool. This\r\noften causes the new-born lamb considerable trouble. Careless shepherds\r\noften allow lambs to suck tags until they die. It only takes a moment to\r\nremove the tags from the udder, so watch all new-born lambs when lambing\r\n\"wool sheep\" until you are sure the lamb has found the teat. Some\r\nflockmasters have all their dropping ewes shorn around the udder just\r\nbefore lambing sheep with the wool on.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALT.\r\n\r\nAfter lambs become two weeks old they will begin to nibble for salt. If\r\nyou do not allow them the salt they will eat any loose dirt. This may\r\nkill a few in any case. Should your pasture contain much alkali, or soil\r\ncontaining small quantities of arsenic matter, you are likely to lose\r\nquite a number of the lambs about the time they begin eating, as they\r\ninvariably nibble for a salt substance first. If convenient, feed the\r\nloose salt in troughs only; otherwise use block salt. Allow about three\r\nounces per ewe each week, or roughly speaking twenty pounds of salt for\r\neach one hundred ewes and their lambs per week. They will require this\r\namount only where they are on very soft, green feed. Upon the range,\r\nwhere there is considerable natural salt feed, or the water is strongly\r\nalkalized, they will not consume that amount. Where they are given salt\r\nat regular intervals there is no danger of over-feeding. Salt is good\r\nfor the wool; it makes good healthy lambs.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILLED LAMBS.\r\n\r\nChilled lambs bring \"chilled men.\" These lambs take the life and\r\nincentive out of many \"new men\" who stand around in dejected spirits,\r\nwhile the real shepherd does much of their work to revive and prevent\r\nchilled lambs everywhere.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to revive the chilled lambs found upon any lambing\r\nground. Some persons wrap them in a cloth taken out of hot water. Others\r\nwrap them well in dry rags. Some give hot milk, whiskey, brandy, etc.\r\nEither of these treatments will generally revive them. A very simple\r\nmethod is to take a rag or gunny sack and rub them until respiration\r\nfully returns; rub them quite dry if wet, put a very small amount of\r\nsalt upon the tongue--this stimulates the heart to action by causing a\r\nlight general irritation. When the lamb has enough life to take milk,\r\nsuckle it just a little, not too much; repeat in an hour. When the\r\ntongue of the lamb is still warm he will surely and quickly come to real\r\nlife if you will kindly treat him as described. Place all such lambs in\r\nthe best shelter, where they are out of the wind, and most of them will\r\nbe with you when the storm is over. A little extra work at this time\r\nwill always be greatly appreciated by every one concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY LAMB.\r\n\r\nAs a general thing early lambs are considerably more expensive to the\r\nproducer than the late lambs born upon the open range. The ewes need\r\nextra feed through the winter months, in order that they may have milk\r\nfor the young, even though there is no green grass. Yet in most cases\r\nthis extra cost is justified by the greater value of the lamb at\r\nshipping time. These lambs grow and put on flesh very rapidly upon the\r\nsoft young grass of the early spring months, when their mothers give so\r\nmuch milk. Again, as most breeders use their oldest ewes or the ones\r\nthat they know will need much extra feed and care through the winter\r\nmonths, for this lambing, there is another consolation in the fact that\r\nshould such a ewe lose her lamb at lambing time, she, too, will have\r\nadvantage of that soft green feed so essential to place old ewes in good\r\nmarketable shape at shipping time. Another advantage is that the lamb\r\ncan be taken from them during the summer or early fall months, which\r\npermits the ewe to become in good condition for the next breeding or the\r\nfollowing winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF THE ZODIAC.\r\n\r\nIn docking lambs we have had the best success when the sign was at\r\nTaurus, Neck. In breeding, we find when the ewe comes in season or heat\r\nwhile the sign is at Scorpio and the ram is given during her first day\r\nin, the ewe will predominate the sex. Especially is this true when the\r\newe is somewhat older than the ram. Should the ram be given when the ewe\r\nis going out, the sex of offspring will be nearly even.\r\n\r\nWhen the ewe comes in while the sign is at Aries or Taurus, and the ram\r\nis not given until the second day, the ram will strongly predominate the\r\nsex. This is also especially true where the ram is a little the oldest\r\nand in a somewhat better physical condition.\r\n\r\nClose attention shows us this law of nature very clearly, yet we have\r\nmuch to learn regarding it. Try it next season when breeding.\r\n\r\nWe are indeed aware that circumstances will not always permit you to\r\nabide by these rules to the minute. Perhaps they will save lambs even if\r\nfollowed only in part. Use them--try them.\r\n\r\nUse the same mental effort to keep you out of MISTAKES that you use to\r\nget the OTHER FELLOW to straighten them.\r\n\r\nIn closing, we have tried to make the wording simple and without too\r\nmuch detail, which might give to a simple matter the appearance of being\r\ncomplicated. We would gladly be on the job, to see the boys, \"the lay of\r\nthe land,\" the feed and water, or other details. For these, and to get\r\nthe most out of your environs, your judgment is always essential to\r\nbring the total per cent for which you are working, and which we so\r\nsincerely wish you.\r\n\r\n                                        Respectfully yours,\r\n                                              THOMAS BOYLAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's changes and known problems:\r\n\r\nSome words or phrases are spelled inconsistently in the original book.\r\nThese have been transcribed as originally printed: scare-crow and\r\nscarecrow, every one and everyone, and any one and anyone.\r\n\r\nP. 14: In the phrase, \"lower end of skin on inside of tail,\" the word \"on\"\r\nappears to have been changed from \"or\" by hand on the original page.\r\n\r\nP. 25: Changed sotrms to storms in the phrase \"during severe storms by\r\nreading.\"\r\n\r\nP. 25: Changed menatl to mental in the phrase \"unexcitable mental\r\ncharacteristic.\"\r\n\r\nP. 38: The phrase \"when the sign was at Taurus, Neck,\" is transcribed as\r\nin the original book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Total Per Cent Lambing Rules, by Thomas Boylan",
