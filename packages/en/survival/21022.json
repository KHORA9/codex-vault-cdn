J. Russell as author and\r\nSoil as subject.  The subject is fundamental, for, just as the soil\r\nlies beneath the plant and animal life we see, so is a knowledge of the\r\nsoil necessary for all understanding of flora and fauna.  The real\r\ncomplexity of the apparently simple element \"Earth,\" and the variety of\r\nmethods required for exploring it, are typical of the problems which\r\nthe _tout ensemble_ of the outdoor world presents to the naturalist.\r\n\r\nDr E. J. Russell has not only acquired a first-rate and first-hand\r\nknowledge of his subject at Wye and at Rothamsted; his own researches\r\nhave recently extended our knowledge of the micro-organisms in the soil\r\nand their influence on fertility.  Further, what is very much to our\r\npurpose, he has himself had practical experience in teaching at an\r\nelementary school in Wye and at a secondary school in Harpenden.\r\n\r\nJust at the present moment, County Councils are trying to push rural\r\neducation and to awaken the intelligence of country children by\r\ninteresting them in their surroundings.  It is, therefore, a favourable\r\nopportunity to offer these pages as a concrete suggestion in model\r\nlessons and object lessons, showing exactly what can be done under\r\nexisting conditions.\r\n\r\n{vi}\r\n\r\nThe book is intended to help children to study nature; there is no\r\nattempt to substitute book study for nature study.  Hence, whilst there\r\nare passages of continuous reading, it is not a mere \"reader.\"  Many\r\nteachers, myself among them, have felt the difficulty of organising\r\npractical work for large classes.  Dr Russell has written so that,\r\nwhilst nominally showing the pupil how to learn, he is secretly\r\nscattering hints for the teacher who is learning how to teach.\r\n\r\nAbundant and varied practical exercises have been suggested, and\r\ncareful instructions have been given so that the book shall seem\r\nintelligible even in the absence of a teacher.  The proposed practical\r\nwork is not only what might be done by eager boys and girls on\r\nhalf-holidays, but what can be done by every scholar in the course of\r\nordinary school work.  The pictorial illustrations are intended as aids\r\nto observation, not as substitutes.  Drawing is one form of practical\r\nexercise, and the preparation of corresponding illustrations in the\r\nscholars' notebooks from the apparatus used in the classroom and the\r\nfields around the school may afford exercises in artistic work with\r\npen, brush or camera.\r\n\r\nSufficient directions are given for the supply of necessary materials\r\nand apparatus.  The apparatus proposed is of the simplest character.\r\n\r\nIt is suggested that the book will be found most useful in the higher\r\nstandards of elementary schools, in preparatory schools and in the\r\nlower forms of secondary schools, that is, where the ages of scholars\r\naverage from 12 to 14.\r\n\r\nHUGH RICHARDSON\r\n\r\nYORK, 7 January 1911\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{vi}\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.

There is,\r\nhowever, an important difference between the actual lessons and the\r\nbook.  The lessons had reference to the soils round about the village,\r\nand dealt mainly with local phenomena, general conclusions being only\r\nsparingly drawn; while in the book it has been necessary to throw the\r\ncourse into a more generalised form.  The teacher in using the book\r\nwill have to reverse the process, he must find local illustrations and\r\nmake liberal use of them during the course; it is hoped that the\r\ninformation given will help him over any difficulties he may experience.\r\n\r\nThis necessity for finding local illustrations constitutes one of the\r\nfundamental differences between Nature Study subjects and other\r\nsubjects of the school curriculum.  The textbooks in some of the others\r\nmay be necessary and sufficient; in Nature Study it is at most only\r\nsubsidiary, serving simply as a guide to the thing that is to be\r\nstudied; unless the thing itself be before the class it is no better\r\nthan a guide to a cathedral would be without the cathedral.  And just\r\nas the guide is successful only when he directs the attention of the\r\nstranger to the important features of the place, and fails directly he\r\nbecomes garrulous and distracts attention, so a Nature Study book\r\nsucceeds {xii} only in as far as it helps in the study of the actual\r\nthing, and fails if it is used passively and is substituted for an\r\nactive study.  No description or illustration can take the place of\r\ndirect observation; the simplest thing in Nature is infinitely more\r\nwonderful than our best word pictures can ever paint it.\r\n\r\nThe author recommends the teacher to look through the chapter before it\r\nhas to be taken in class and then to make a few expeditions in search\r\nof local illustrations.  It is not strictly necessary that the chapters\r\nshould be taken in the order given.  The local phenomena must be dealt\r\nwith as they arise and as weather permits, or the opportunity may pass\r\nnot to return again during the course.  In almost any lane, field, or\r\ngarden a sufficient number of illustrations may be obtained for our\r\npurpose; if a stream and a hill are accessible the material is\r\npractically complete, especially if the children can be induced to\r\npursue their studies during their summer holiday rambles.  Of course\r\nthis entails a good deal of work for the teacher, but the results are\r\nworth it.  Children enjoy experimental and observation lessons in which\r\nthey take an active part and are not merely passive learners.   The\r\nvalue of such lessons in developing their latent powers and in\r\nstimulating them to seek for knowledge in the great book of Nature is a\r\nsufficient recompense to the enthusiastic teacher for the extra trouble\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nIt is not desirable to work through a chapter in one lesson.  Children\r\nunaccustomed to make experiments or to see experiments done, will\r\nprobably require three or four lessons for getting through each of the\r\nfirst few chapters, and two or three lessons for each of the others.\r\n\r\n{xiii}\r\n\r\nThe pot experiments of Chaps. VI., VII. and VIII. should be started as\r\nearly in the course as possible.  Twenty flower pots are wanted for the\r\nset; they should be of the same size, about eight inches being a\r\nconvenient diameter, and should be kept together in a warm place.\r\nThree are filled with sand, seven with subsoil, and the remaining ten\r\nwith surface soil.  Three of the subsoil pots are uncropped, two being\r\nstored moist and one dry.  Four pots of the surface soil are uncropped\r\nand moist, a fifth and sixth are uncropped and dry, one of these\r\ncontains earthworms (p. 54).  Four glazed pots, e.g. large jam or\r\nmarmalade jars, are also wanted (p. 69).  Mustard, buckwheat, or rye\r\nmake good crops, but many others will do.  Leguminous crops, however,\r\nshow certain abnormal characters, while turnips and cabbages are apt to\r\nfail: none of these should be used.  It is highly desirable that the\r\npots should be duplicated.\r\n\r\nThe plots also should be started in the school garden as early as\r\nconvenient.  Eight are required for the set: their treatment is\r\ndescribed in Chap. IX.  Plots two yards square suffice.\r\n\r\nA supply of sand, of clay, and of lime will be wanted, but it is not\r\nnecessary to have fresh material for each lesson.  The sand may be\r\nobtained from a builder, a sand pit, the sea shore or from a dealer in\r\nchemical apparatus.  The clay may be obtained from a brick yard; it\r\ngives most satisfactory results after it has been ground ready for\r\nbrick making.  Modelling clay is equally satisfactory.  A supply of\r\nrain water is desirable.\r\n\r\nFor a class of twelve children working in pairs at the experiments the\r\nfollowing apparatus is wanted for the whole course:--\r\n\r\n{xiv}\r\n\r\n  Six tripods and bunsen burners or spirit lamps [2]\r\n  twelve pipe-clay triangles [4]\r\n  twelve crucibles or tin lids [3]\r\n  sixteen gas jars [4]\r\n  twelve beakers 250 c.c. capacity [4]\r\n  two beakers 500 c.c.\r\n  two beakers 100 c.c.\r\n  six egg-cups [2]\r\n  twelve funnels [3]\r\n  six funnel stands [1]\r\n  six perforated glass disks [3]\r\n  two tubulated bottles 500 c.c., four corks to fit\r\n  cork borers\r\n  4 lbs. assorted glass tubing\r\n  pestle and mortar\r\n  twelve Erlenmeyer flasks 50 c.c. [3]\r\n  six saucers\r\n  twelve flatbottomed flasks 100 c.c., six fitted with India\r\n    rubber stoppers bored with one hole [3], and six\r\n    with ordinary corks [3]\r\n  box as in Fig. 13\r\n  six glass tubes 1/2\" diameter, 18\" long [2]\r\n  six lamp chimneys [3]\r\n  six test tubes, corks to fit\r\n  three thermometers\r\n  soil sampler (p. 88)\r\n  balance and weights\r\n  two retort stands with rings and clamp.\r\n\r\nThe figures given in square brackets are the quantities that suffice\r\nwhen the teacher alone does the experiments, it not being convenient\r\nfor the scholars to do much.\r\n\r\n{xv}\r\n\r\nIn conclusion the author desires to tender his best thanks to the Rev.\r\nCecil Grant of St George's School, and to Mr W. J. Ashby of the Wye\r\nSchool, for having allowed him the use of their schools and appliances\r\nduring the progress of these lessons.  Especially are his thanks due to\r\nMr Lionel Armstrong for much help ungrudgingly rendered in collecting\r\nmaterial, taking photographs, and supervising the experiments.\r\n\r\nE. J.

Clay.  Six tripods\r\nand bunsen burners or spirit lamps [2].  Six crucibles or tin lids and\r\npipe-clay triangles [2].  Twelve glass jars or gas cylinders [4].  Six\r\nbeakers [2] [1]._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we talk to a farmer or a gardener about soils he will say that there\r\nare several kinds of soil; clay soils, gravel soils, peat soils, chalk\r\nsoils, and so on, and we may discover this for ourselves if we make\r\nsome rambles in the country and take careful notice of the ground about\r\nus, particularly if we can leave the road and walk on the footpaths\r\nacross the fields.  When we find the ground very hard in dry weather\r\nand very sticky in wet weather we may be sure we are on a clay soil,\r\nand may expect to find brick yards or tile works somewhere near, where\r\nthe clay is used.  If the soil is loose, drying quickly after rain, and\r\nif it can be scattered about by the hand like sand on the sea shore, we\r\nknow we are on a sandy soil and can look for pits where builder's sand\r\nis dug.  But it may very likely happen that the soil is something in\r\nbetween, and that neither sand pits nor {2} clay pits can be found; if\r\nwe ask what sort of soil this is we are told it is a loam.  A gravel\r\nsoil will be known at once by its gravel pits, and a chalk soil by the\r\nwhite chalk quarries and old lime kilns, while a peat soil is black,\r\nsometimes marshy and nearly always spongey to tread on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.  Soil and subsoil in St George's school garden]\r\n\r\nWe want to learn something of the soil round about us, and we will\r\nbegin by digging a hole about three feet deep to see what we can\r\ndiscover.  At Harpenden this is what the scholars saw:--the top eight\r\ninches of soil was dark in colour and easy to dig; the soil below was\r\nreddish brown in colour and very hard to dig; one changed into the\r\nother so quickly that it was easy to see where the top soil ended and\r\nthe bottom soil began; no further change could, however, be seen below\r\nthe eight inch line.  A drawing was made to show these things, and is\r\ngiven in Fig. 1.  You may find something quite different: sand, chalk,\r\nor solid rock may occur below the soil, but you should enter whatever\r\nyou see into your notebooks and make a drawing, like Fig. 1, to be kept\r\nfor future use.  Before filling in the hole some of the dark coloured\r\ntop soil, and some of the lighter coloured soil lying below (which is\r\ncalled the subsoil), {3} should be taken for further examination; the\r\ntwo samples should be kept separate and not mixed.\r\n\r\nFirst look carefully at the top soil and rub some of it between your\r\nfingers.  We found that our sample was wet and therefore contained\r\nwater; it was very sticky like clay and therefore contained clay; there\r\nwere a few stones and some grit present and also some tiny pieces of\r\ndead plants--roots, stems or leaves, but some so decayed that we could\r\nnot quite tell what they were.  A few pieces of a soft white stone were\r\nfound that marked on the blackboard like chalk.  Lastly, there were a\r\nfew fragments of coal and cinders, but as these were not a real part of\r\nthe soil we supposed they had got in by accident.  The subsoil was also\r\nwet and even more sticky than the top soil, it contained stones and\r\ngrit, but seemed almost free from plant remains and from the white\r\nchalky fragments.\r\n\r\nA few experiments will show how much of some of these things are\r\npresent.  The amount of water may be discovered by weighing out ten\r\ngrams of soil, leaving it to dry in a warm place near the fire or in\r\nthe sun, and then weighing it again.  In one experiment the results\r\nwere:--\r\n\r\n  Weight of top soil before drying ... 10   grams = 100 decigrams\r\n     \"       \"   \"   after    \"    ...  8.3   \"   =  83     \"\r\n                                       ----         ---\r\n                        Water lost ...  1.7   \"   =  17     \"\r\n\r\nA column 100 millimetres long was drawn to represent the 100 decigrams\r\nof soil, and a mark was drawn 17 millimetres up to show the amount of\r\nwater (see Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n  Weight of bottom soil before drying ...  10   grams = 100 decigrams\r\n     \"        \"     \"   after    \"    ...   8.7   \"  =   87     \"\r\n\r\n                           Water lost ...   1.3   \"  =   13     \"\r\n\r\n{4} Another column should be drawn for the subsoil.  On drying the soil\r\nit becomes lighter in colour and loses its stickiness, but it has not\r\npermanently changed because as soon as water is added it comes back to\r\nwhat it was before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.  Columns showing what 100 parts of soil and\r\nsubsoil were made of]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dried lumps of soil are now to be broken up finely with a piece of\r\nwood, but nothing must be lost.  It is easy to see shrivelled pieces of\r\nplant, but not easy to pick them out; the simplest plan is to burn them\r\naway.  The soil must be carefully tipped on to a tin lid, or into a\r\ncrucible, heated over a flame and stirred {5} with a long clean nail.\r\nFirst of all it chars, then there is a little sparkling, but not much,\r\nfinally the soil turns red and does not change any further no matter\r\nhow much it is heated.  The shade of red will at once be recognised as\r\nbrick red or terra cotta, indeed \"terra cotta\" means \"baked earth.\"\r\nWhen the soil is cold it should be examined again; it has become very\r\nhard and the plant remains have either disappeared or have changed to\r\nash and crumble away directly they are touched.  On weighing a further\r\nloss is discovered, which was in our experiment:--\r\n\r\n  Weight of top soil after drying but before burning ... 83 decigrams\r\n    \"        \"   \"     \"     \"     \"  after    \"     ... 76     \"\r\n                                                         --\r\n                    The part that burnt away weighed ...  7     \"\r\n\r\n   Weight of subsoil after drying but before burning ... 87 decigrams\r\n     \"          \"      \"     \"     \"  after    \"     ... 84     \"\r\n                                                         --\r\n                    The part that burnt away weighed ...  3     \"\r\n\r\n\r\nThese results are entered on the column in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe surface soil is seen to contain more material that will burn away\r\nthan the subsoil does.  When the burnt soil is moistened it does not\r\nbecome dark and sticky like it did before, it has completely changed\r\nand cannot be made into soil again.  It is more like brick dust than\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nFor further experiments we shall want a fresh portion of the original\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nOn a wet afternoon something was noticed that enabled us to get a\r\nlittle further with our studies.  The rain water ran down a sloping\r\npiece of ground in a tiny channel it had made; the streamlet was very\r\nmuddy, and at first it was thought that all the soil was washed away.\r\nBut we soon saw that the channel was lined {6} with grit, some of which\r\nwas moving slowly down and some not at all.  Grit can therefore be\r\nseparated from the rest of the soil by water.\r\n\r\nThis separation can be shown very well by the following experiment.\r\nRub ten grains of finely powdered soil with a little water (rain water\r\nis better than tap water), and carefully pour the muddy liquid into a\r\nlarge glass jar.  Add more water to the rest of the soil, shake, and\r\nagain pour the liquid into the jar; go on doing this till the jar is\r\nfull.  Then get some more jars and still keep on till the liquid is no\r\nlonger muddy but nearly clear.  The part of the soil that remains\r\nbehind and will not float over into the jars is at once seen to be made\r\nup of small stones, grit, and sand.  Set the jars aside and look at\r\nthem after a day or so.  The liquid remains muddy for some time, but\r\nthen it clears and a thick black sediment gathers at the bottom.  If\r\nnow you very carefully pour the liquid off you can collect the\r\nsediments: they are soft and sticky, and can be moulded into patterns\r\nlike clay.  In order to see if they really contain clay we must do the\r\nexperiment again, but use pure clay from a brick yard, or modelling\r\nclay, instead of soil.  The muddy liquid is obtained as before, it\r\ntakes a long time to settle, but in the end it gives a sediment so much\r\nlike that from the soil, except in colour, that we shall be safe in\r\nsaying that the sediments in the jars contain the clay from the soil.\r\nAnd thus we have been able to separate the sticky part of the soil--the\r\nclay--from the gritty or sandy part which is not at all sticky.  We may\r\neven be able to find out something more.  If we leave the soil sediment\r\nand the clay sediment on separate tin lids to dry, and then examine\r\nthem carefully we may find that the {7} soil sediment is really a\r\nlittle more gritty than the clay.  Although it contains the clay it\r\nalso contains something else.\r\n\r\nWhen the experiment is made very carefully in a proper way this\r\nmaterial can be separated from the pure clay.  It is called silt, but\r\nreally there are a number of silts, some almost like clay and some\r\nalmost like sand; they shade one into the other.\r\n\r\nIf there is enough grit it should be weighed: we obtained 14 decigrams\r\nof grit from 10 grams of our top soil and 17 decigrams from 10 grams of\r\nbottom soil.  We cannot separate the clay from the silt, but when this\r\nis done in careful experiments it is found that the subsoil contains\r\nmore clay than the top soil.  We should of course expect this because\r\nwe have found that the subsoil is more sticky than the top soil.  These\r\nresults are put into the columns as before so that we can now see at\r\nonce how much of our soil is water, how much can burn away, how much is\r\ngrit, and how much is clay and other things.\r\n\r\nWhat would have happened if the sample had been dug out during wetter\r\nor drier weather?  The quantity of water would have been different, but\r\nin other respects the soil would have remained the same.  It is\r\ntherefore best to avoid the changes in the amount of water by working\r\nalways with 10 grams of _dried_ soil.  The results we obtained were:--\r\n\r\n                                           Top soil  Subsoil\r\n  Weight of dry soil before burning    ...   100       100 decigrams\r\n    \"        \"   \"   after    \"        ...    92        97     \"\r\n                                             ---       ---\r\n  The part that burned away weighed    ...     8         3\r\n  Weight of grit from 10 grams of dried soil  17        19     \"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe columns are given in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n{8}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.  Columns showing what 100 parts of dried soil\r\nand subsoil were made of]\r\n\r\nSummary.  The experiments made so far have taught us these facts:--\r\n\r\n1. Soil contains water, grit or sand, silt, clay, a part that burns\r\naway, and some white chalky specks.\r\n\r\n2. The top layer of soil to a depth of about eight inches is different\r\nfrom the soil lying below, which is called the subsoil.  It is less\r\nsticky, easier to dig, and darker in colour.  It contains more of the\r\nmaterial that burns away, but less clay than the subsoil.\r\n\r\n3. When soil is dried it is not sticky but hard or crumbly; as soon as\r\nit is moistened it changes back to what it was before.  But when soil\r\nis burnt it completely alters and can no longer be changed back again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] See p. xiv for explanation of the figures in square brackets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{9}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT THE CLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nApparatus required.\r\n\r\n_Clay, about 6 lbs.; a little dried, powdered clay; sand, about 6 lbs.\r\nSix glass jars or cylinders [2].  Six beakers [1].  Six egg-cups [1].\r\nSix funnels and stands [2].  Six perforated glass or tin disks [2].\r\nSix glass tubes [2].  Two tubulated bottles fitted with corks.  Some\r\nseeds.  Six small jars about 2 in. x 1 in. [2].  Bricks.  The apparatus\r\nin Fig. 9.  Pestle and mortar._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the last chapter that clay will float in water and only\r\nslowly settles down.  Is this because clay is lighter than water?\r\nProbably not, because a lump of clay seems very heavy.  Further, if we\r\nput a small ball of clay into water it at once sinks to the bottom.\r\nOnly when we rub the clay between our fingers or work it with a\r\nstick--in other words, when we break the ball into very tiny\r\npieces--can we get it to float again.  We therefore conclude that the\r\nclay floated in our jars (p. 6) for so long not because it was lighter\r\nthan water, but because the pieces were so small.\r\n\r\nClay is exceedingly useful because of its stickiness.  Dig up some\r\nclay, if there is any in your garden, or procure some from a brick\r\nworks.  You can mould it into any shape you like, and the purer the\r\nclay the {10} better it acts.  Enormous quantities of clay are used for\r\nmaking bricks.  Make some model bricks about an inch long and half an\r\ninch in width and depth, also make a small basin of about the same\r\nsize, then set them aside for a week in a warm, dry place.  They still\r\nkeep their shape; even if a crack has appeared the pieces stick\r\ntogether and do not crumble to a powder.\r\n\r\nIf you now measure with a ruler any of the bricks that have not\r\ncracked, you will find that they have shrunk a little and are no longer\r\nquite an inch long.  This fact is well known to brickmakers; the moulds\r\nin which they make the bricks are larger than the brick is wanted to\r\nbe.  But what would happen if instead of a piece of clay one inch long\r\nyou had a whole field of clay?  Would that shrink also, and, if so,\r\nwhat would the field look like?  We can answer this question in two\r\nways; we may make a model of a field and let it dry, and we can pay a\r\nvisit to a clay meadow after some hot, dry weather in summer.  The\r\nmodel can be made by kneading clay up under water and then rolling it\r\nout on some cardboard or wood as if it were a piece of pastry.  Cut it\r\ninto a square and draw lines on the cardboard right at the edges of the\r\nclay.  Then put it into a dry warm place and leave for some days.  Fig.\r\n4 is a picture of such a model after a week's drying.  The clay has\r\nshrunk away from the marks, but it has also shrunk all over and has\r\ncracked.  If you get an opportunity of walking over a clay field during\r\na dry summer, you will find similar but much larger cracks, some of\r\nwhich may be two or three inches wide, or even more.  Sometimes the\r\ncracking is so bad that the roots of plants or of trees are torn by it,\r\nand even buildings, in some instances, have suffered through their\r\nfoundations shrinking away.  {11} We can now understand why some of our\r\nmodel bricks cracked.  The cracks were caused by the shrinkage just as\r\nhappens with our model field.  As soon as the clay becomes wet it\r\nswells again.  A very pretty experiment can be made to show this.  Fill\r\na glass tube or an egg-cup with dry powdered clay, scrape the surface\r\nlevel with a ruler, and then stand in a glass jar full of rain water so\r\nthat the whole is completely covered.  After a short time the clay\r\nbegins to swell and forces its way out of the egg-cup as shown in Fig.\r\n5, falling over the side and making quite a little shower.  In exactly\r\nthe same way the ground swells after heavy rain and rises a little,\r\nthen it falls again and cracks when it becomes dry.  Darwin records\r\nsome careful measurements in a book called _Earthworms and Vegetable\r\nMould_--\"a large flat stone laid on the surface of a field sank 3.33\r\nmillimetres[1] whilst the weather was dry between May 9th and June\r\n13th, {12} and rose 1.91 millimetres between September 7th and 19th of\r\nthe same year, much rain having fallen during the latter part of this\r\ntime.  During frosts and thaws the movements were twice as great.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.  Clay was plastered over a square piece of board\r\nand completely covered it.  After drying for a week the clay had shrunk\r\nand cracked]\r\n\r\nYou must have found out by now how very slippery clay becomes as soon\r\nas it is wet enough.  It is not easy to walk over a clay field in wet\r\nweather, and if the clay forms part of the slope of a hill it may be so\r\nslippery that it becomes dangerous.  Sometimes after very heavy rains\r\nsoil resting on clay on the side of a hill has begun to slide downwards\r\nand moves some distance before it stops.  Fortunately these land slips\r\nas they are called, are not common in England, but they do occur.  Fig.\r\n6 shows one in the Isle of Wight, and another is described by Gilbert\r\nWhite in _The Natural History of Selborne_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.  Clay swelling up when placed in water and\r\noverflowing from the egg-cup into which it was put]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.  Landslip in the Isle of Wight]\r\n\r\nAnother thing that you will have noticed is that anything made of clay\r\nholds water.  A simple way of testing this is to put a round piece of\r\ntin perforated {14} with holes into a funnel, press some clay on to it\r\nand on to the sides of the funnel (Fig. 7), and then pour on rain\r\nwater.  The water does not run through.  Pools of water may lie like\r\nthis on a clay field for a very long time in winter before they\r\ndisappear, as you will know very well if you live in a clay country.\r\nSo when a lake or a reservoir is being made it sometimes happens that\r\nthe sides are lined with clay to keep the water in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.  A thin layer of clay _a_ entirely prevents the\r\nwater running through]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf water cannot get through can air?  This is very easily discovered:\r\nplug a glass tube with clay and see if you can draw or blow air\r\nthrough.  You cannot.  Clay can be used like putty to stop up holes or\r\ncracks, and so long as it keeps moist it will neither let air nor water\r\n{15} through.  Take two bottles like those in Fig. 8, stop up the\r\nbottom tubes, and fill with water.  Then put a funnel through each cork\r\nand fit the cork in tightly, covering with clay if there is any sign of\r\na leak.  Put a perforated tin disk into each funnel, cover one well\r\nwith clay and the other with sand.  Open the bottom tubes.  No water\r\nruns out from the first bottle because no air can leak in through the\r\nclay, but it runs out very quickly from the second because the sand\r\nlets air through.  These properties of clay and sand are very important\r\nfor plants.  Sow some seeds in a little jar {16} full of clay kept\r\nmoist to prevent it cracking, and at the same time sow a few in some\r\nmoist sand.  The seeds soon germinate in the sand but not in the clay.\r\nIt is known that seeds will not germinate unless they have air and\r\nwater and are warm enough.  They had water in both jars, and they were\r\nin both cases warm, but they got no air through the clay and therefore\r\ncould not sprout.  Pure clay would not be good for plants to grow in.\r\nAir came through the sand, however, and gave the seeds all they wanted\r\nfor germination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.  Sand allows air to pass through it, and so\r\nwater runs out of the bottle.  Clay does not let air pass, and the\r\nwater is therefore kept in, even though the tube is open.]\r\n\r\nThis also explains something else that you may have noticed.  If you\r\ntried baking one of your model bricks in the fire you probably found\r\nthat the brick exploded and shattered to pieces: the water still left\r\nin the brick changed to steam when it was heated, but the steam could\r\nnot escape through the clay, and so it burst the clay.  In a brick\r\nworks the heat is very gradually applied and the steam only slowly\r\nforms, so that it has time to leak away, then when it has all gone the\r\nbrick can be heated strongly.  You should try this with one of your\r\nmodel bricks; leave it in a hot place near the stove or on the radiator\r\nfor a week or more and then see if you can bake it without mishap.\r\n\r\nLet us now compare a piece of clay with a brick.  The differences are\r\nso great that you would hardly think the brick could have been made\r\nfrom clay.  The brick is neither soft nor sticky, and it has not the\r\nsmooth surface of a piece of clay, but is full of little holes or\r\npores, which look as if they were formed in letting the steam out.  A\r\nbrick lets air through; some air gets into our houses through the\r\nbricks even when the windows are shut.  Water will get through bricks\r\nmore easily than it does through clay.  After heavy rain you {17} can\r\noften find that water has soaked through a brick wall and made the wall\r\npaper quite damp.  A pretty experiment can be made with the piece of\r\napparatus shown in Fig. 9: bore in a brick a hole about an inch deep\r\nand a quarter of an inch wide, put into the hole the piece of bent\r\nglass tubing, and fix it in with some clay or putty, then pour some\r\nwater blackened with ink into the tube, marking its position with a\r\nlabel.  Stand the brick in a vessel so full of water that the brick is\r\nentirely covered.  Water soaks into the brick and presses the air out:\r\nthe air tries to escape through the tube and forces up the black liquid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.  A brick standing in water.  The air in the\r\nbrick is driven inwards by the water and forces the liquid up the tube\r\nin order to escape]\r\n\r\n\r\nOne more experiment may be tried.  Can a brick be changed back into\r\nclay?  Grind up the brick and it forms a gritty powder.  Moisten it,\r\nwork it with your fingers how you please, but it still remains a gritty\r\npowder and never takes on the greasy, sticky feeling of {18} pure clay.\r\nIndeed no one has ever succeeded in making clay out of bricks.  All\r\nthese experiments show that clay is completely altered when it is\r\nburnt.  We also found that soil is completely altered by burning, and\r\nif you look back at your notes you will see that the changes are very\r\nmuch alike, so much so that we can safely put down some of the changes\r\nin the burnt soil--the red colour, the hard grittiness, and the absence\r\nof stickiness--to the clay.  Let us now examine a piece of dry, but\r\nunburnt, clay.  It is very hard and does not crumble, it is neither\r\nsticky nor slippery.  Directly, however, we add some water it changes\r\nback to what it was before.  Drying therefore alters clay only for the\r\ntime being, whilst baking changes it permanently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A little more than one-eighth of an inch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{19}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWHAT LIME DOES TO CLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nApparatus required.\r\n\r\n_Clay, about 6 lbs.  Some of the clay from Chapter II may, if\r\nnecessary, be used over again.  Lime, about 1/2 lb.  Six funnels,\r\nstands and disks [2].  Twelve glass jars [2].  Lime water[1]._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are in a clay country in autumn or early winter you will find\r\nsome of the fields dotted with white heaps of chalk or lime, and you\r\nwill be told that these things \"improve\" the soil.  We will make a few\r\nexperiments to find out what lime does to clay.  Put some clay on to a\r\nperforated tin disk in a funnel just as you did on p. 14, press it down\r\nso that no water can pass through.  Then sprinkle on to the clay some\r\npowdered lime and add rain water.  Soon the water begins to leak\r\nthrough, though it could not do so before; the addition of the lime,\r\ntherefore, has altered the clay.  If you added lime to a garden or a\r\nfield on which water lay about for a long time in winter you would\r\nexpect the water to drain away, especially if you made drains or cut\r\nsome trenches along which the water could pass.  There are large areas\r\nin England where this has been done with very great advantage.\r\n\r\n{20}\r\n\r\nThe muddy liquid obtained by shaking clay with water clears quickly if\r\na little lime is stirred in.  Fill two jars A and B (Fig. 10) with rain\r\nwater, rub clay into each and stir up so as to make a muddy liquid,\r\nthen add some lime water to _B_ and stir well.  Leave for a short time.\r\nFlocks quickly appear in _B_, then sink, leaving the liquid clear, but\r\nA remains cloudy for a long time.  But why should the liquid clear?  We\r\ndecided in our earlier experiments that the clay floated in the water\r\nbecause it was in very tiny pieces; when we took a larger lump the clay\r\nsank.  The lime has for some reason or other, which we do not\r\nunderstand, made the small clay particles stick together to form the\r\nlarge flocks, and these can no longer float, but sink.  If we look at\r\nthe limed clay in our funnel experiment we shall see that the same\r\nchange has gone on there; the clay has become rather loose and fluffy,\r\nand can therefore no longer hold water back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.  Addition of lime to turbid clay water now\r\nmakes the clay settle and leaves the water quite clear]\r\n\r\nLime also makes clay less sticky.  Knead up one piece of clay with rain\r\nwater alone and another piece {21} with rain water and about 1/20 its\r\nweight of lime.  The limed clay breaks easily and works quite\r\ndifferently from the pure clay.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.  This, then, is what we have learnt about clay.  Clay is made\r\nup of very, very, tiny pieces, so small that they float in water.  They\r\nstick together when they are wetted and then pressed, and they remain\r\ntogether; a piece of clay moulded into any pattern will keep its shape\r\neven after it is dried and baked.  Clay is therefore made into bricks,\r\nearthenware, pottery, etc., whilst white clay, which is found in some\r\nplaces, is made into china.  Wet clay shrinks and cracks as it dries;\r\nthese cracks can easily be seen in the fields during dry weather.  This\r\nshrinkage interferes with the foundations of houses and other\r\nbuildings, causing them to settle.  Dry clay is different from wet\r\nclay, it is hard, not sticky and not slippery, but it at once becomes\r\nlike ordinary clay when water is added.  After baking, however, clay\r\npermanently alters and cannot again be changed back to what it was\r\nbefore.  Clay will not let water pass through; a clay field is\r\ntherefore nearly always wet in winter and spring.  Nor can air pass\r\nthrough until the clay dries or cracks.\r\n\r\nLime has a remarkable action on clay.  It makes the little, tiny pieces\r\nstick together to form feathery flocks which sink in water; lime\r\ntherefore causes muddy clay water to become clear.  The flocks cannot\r\nhold water back, and hence limed clay allows water to pass through.\r\nLimed clay is also less sticky than pure clay.  A clay field or garden\r\nis improved by adding lime because the soil does not remain wet so long\r\nas it did before; it is also less sticky and therefore more easily\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Lime water is made by shaking up lime and water.  It should be kept\r\nin a well-corked bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{22}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSOME EXPERIMENTS WITH THE SAND\r\n\r\n\r\nApparatus required.\r\n\r\n_Sand, about 6 lbs.; clay, about 6 lbs.  Six funnels, stands and disks\r\n[1].  Six glass jars [2].  One box with glass front shown in Fig. 13\r\nfilled with clay and sand, as indicated.  Quarry chalk (about 5 lbs.).\r\nSix beakers [1].  Six egg-cups [1]._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is a sand pit near you, or a field of sandy soil, you should\r\nget a supply for these experiments; if not, some builder's sand can be\r\nused.  When the sand is dry you will see that the grains are large and\r\nhard.  Further, they are all separate and do not stick together; if you\r\nmake a hole in a heap of the sand, the sides fall in, there is nothing\r\nsolid about it, and you can easily see the mistake of the foolish man\r\nwho built his house upon the sand.  When the sand is wet it sticks\r\nbetter and can be made into a good many things; at the seaside you can\r\nmake a really fine castle with wet sand.  But as soon as the sand dries\r\nit again becomes loose and begins to fall to pieces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.  Sand dunes, Penhale sands, Cornwall]\r\n\r\nStrong winds will blow these fragments of dry sand about and pile them\r\nup into the sand hills or dunes common in many seaside districts (Fig.\r\n11).  Blowing sands can also be found in inland districts; in the\r\nnorthern part of Surrey, in parts of Norfolk and many {24} other places\r\nare fields where so much of the soil is blown away by strong winds that\r\nthe crops may suffer injury.  In Central Asia sand storms do very much\r\nharm and have in the course of years buried entire cities.  Fig. 12\r\nshows the Penhale sands in Cornwall gradually covering up some meadows\r\nand ruining them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.  Sand from Penhale sand dunes blowing on to and\r\ncovering up meadows]\r\n\r\nSand particles, being large, do not float in water.  If we shake up\r\nsand in water the sand sinks, leaving the water entirely clear.  So\r\nrunning water does not carry sand with it unless it is running very\r\nquickly: the sand lies at the bottom.\r\n\r\nUnlike clay, sand does not hold water.  Pour some water on to sand\r\nplaced on the tin disk in a funnel (Fig. 8); it nearly all runs through\r\nat once.  We should therefore expect a sandy field or a sandy road to\r\ndry up very quickly after rain and not to remain wet like a clay field.\r\nSo much is this the case that people prefer to live on a sandy soil\r\nrather than on a clay.  The most desirable residential districts round\r\nLondon, Hampstead on the north, and the stretch running from Haslemere\r\non the south-west to Maidstone on the south-east, and other favoured\r\nregions, are all high up on the sand.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of a hill formed of sand you often find a spring,\r\nespecially if clay or solid rock lies below.  It is easy to make a\r\nmodel that will show why the spring forms at this particular place.\r\nFill the lower part of the box shown in Fig. 13 with wet clay,\r\nsmoothing it out so that it touches all three sides and the glass\r\nfront; then on top of the clay put enough sand to fill the box.  Bore\r\nfour holes in the side as shown in the picture, one at the bottom, one\r\nat the top, one just above the junction of the sand and clay, the\r\nfourth half way up the sand, and fix in glass tubes with clay or putty.\r\nPour {26} water on to the sand out of a watering can fitted with the\r\nrose so as to imitate the rain.  At first nothing seems to happen, but\r\nif you look closely you will notice that the water soaks through and\r\ndoes not lie on the surface; it runs right down to the clay; then it\r\ncomes out at the tube there (_c_ in the picture).  None goes through\r\nthe clay, nor does enough stay in the sand to flow out through either\r\nthe top or the second tube; of the four tubes only one is discharging\r\nany water.  The discharge does not stop when the supply of water stops.\r\nThe rain need only fall at intervals, but the water will flow all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.  Model spring.  A box with glass front contains\r\na layer of clay and one of sand.  Water that falls on the sand runs\r\nright down to the clay but can get no further, and therefore flows out\r\nthrough the tube _c_ at the junction of the clay and the sand.  The\r\nsame result is obtained when chalk takes the place of sand]\r\n\r\nThe experiment should now be tried with some chalk from a quarry; it\r\ngives the same results and shows that chalk, like sand, allows water\r\nreadily to pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.  Foot of a chalk hill at Harpenden where a\r\nspring breaks out just under the bush at the right-hand side of the\r\ngate]\r\n\r\nJust the same thing happens out of doors in a sandy or chalky country;\r\nthe rain water soaks through the sand or chalk until it comes to clay\r\nor solid rock that it cannot pass, then it stops.  If it can find a way\r\nout it {28} does so and makes a spring, or sometimes a whole line of\r\nsprings or wet ground.  Rushes, which flourish in such wet places, will\r\noften be found growing along this line, and may, indeed, in summer time\r\nbe all you can see, the water having drained away.  But after much rain\r\nthe line again becomes very wet.  Fig. 14 shows the foot of a chalk\r\nhill near Harpenden, where a spring breaks out just under the bush at\r\nthe right-hand side of the gate.  In Fig. 15 the bush itself is seen,\r\nwith the little pool of water made by the spring.  Here the water flows\r\ngently, but elsewhere it sometimes happens, as in Fig. 16, that the\r\nspring breaks out with great force.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.  \"The little pool below the tree\"]\r\n\r\nNow stop up the glass tubes so that the water cannot get out.  Soon the\r\nsand becomes flooded and is no better than clay would be.  A second\r\nmodel will show this very well.  Make a large saucer of clay and fill\r\nwith sand: {30} pour water on.  The water stays in the sand, because it\r\ncannot pass through the clay.  A sandy field saturated like this will\r\ntherefore not be dry, but wet, and will not make a good position for a\r\nhouse.  We must therefore distinguish the two cases illustrated in Fig.\r\n17.  _A_ shows sand on a hill, dry because the water runs through until\r\nit comes to clay or rock, when it stops and breaks out as a spring, a\r\ntiny stream, or pond; this is a good building site and you may expect\r\nto find large houses there.  _B_ shows the sand in a basin of clay,\r\nwhere the water cannot get away: here the cellars and downstairs rooms\r\nare liable to be wet, and in a village the wells give impure water.\r\nMatters could be improved if a way out were cut for the water, but then\r\nthe foundations of the buildings might move a little.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.  Water bursting out from an underground spring,\r\nOld Cateriag Quarry, Dunbar]\r\n\r\nIt often happens that villages are situated at the junction of sand and\r\nclay, or chalk and clay, because the springs furnish forth a good water\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand large tracts of clay which remain wet and sticky\r\nduring a good part of the year are not very attractive to live in, and\r\neven near London they were the last to be populated: Hither Green in\r\nthe south-cast and the clay districts of the north-west have only of\r\nlate years been built on; while the sands and gravels of Highgate,\r\nChiswick, Brentford and other places had long been occupied.\r\nElsewhere, villages on the clay do not grow quickly unless there is\r\nmuch manufacturing or mining; the parishes are large, the roads even\r\nnow are not good while they used to be very bad indeed.  Macaulay tells\r\nus that at the end of the seventeenth century in some parts of Kent and\r\nSussex \"none but the strongest horses could in winter get through the\r\nbog, in which at every step they sank {31} deep.  The markets were\r\noften inaccessible during several months. . .  The wheeled carriages\r\nwere, in this district, generally pulled by oxen.  When Prince George\r\nof Denmark visited the stately mansion of Petworth in wet weather, he\r\nwas six hours in going nine miles; and it was necessary that a body of\r\nsturdy hinds should be on each side of his coach to prop it up.  Of the\r\ncarriages which conveyed his retinue several were upset and injured.  A\r\nletter from one of the party has been preserved in which the\r\nunfortunate courier complains that, during fourteen hours, he never\r\nonce alighted, except when his coach was overturned or stuck fast in\r\nthe mud.\"  The Romans knew how to make roads anywhere, and so they made\r\nthem run in a straight line between the two places they wished to\r\nconnect, but the art was lost in later years, and the country roads\r\nmade in England since their time usually had to follow the sand or the\r\nchalk, avoiding the clay as much as possible.  These roads we still\r\nuse.  Fig. 18 shows the roads round Wye; you should in your rambles\r\nstudy your own roads and see what soil they are on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.  Two positions of sand.  _A_ is dry because the\r\nwater can drain away and break out as a spring at _c_.  _B_ is wet\r\nbecause the water cannot drain away]\r\n\r\nThere are several other ways in which sand differs from clay.  It does\r\nnot shrink on drying nor does it {32} swell on wetting, and you will\r\nfind nothing happens when you try with sand the experiment with the\r\nmodel field (p. 11) or the egg-cup (p. 12).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.  The roads round Wye.  As far as possible they\r\nkeep off the clay (the plain part of the map) and keep on the chalk or\r\nthe sand (the dotted part of the map)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{33}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PART THAT BURNS AWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nApparatus required.\r\n\r\n_Leaf mould.  Mould from a tree.  Peat.  About 1 lb. soil from a wood,\r\na well-manured garden and a field; also some subsoil.  Six crucibles or\r\ntin lids.  Six tripods, pipe-clay triangles, and bunsen burners or\r\nspirit lamps.  Six beakers and egg-cups [1]._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn leaves fall off the trees and form a thick layer in the\r\nwoods.  They do not last very long; if they did they would in a few\r\nyears almost bury the wood.  You can, in the springtime or early summer\r\nfind out what has happened to them if you go into a wood or carefully\r\nsearch under a big hedge in a lane where the leaves were not swept\r\naway.  Here and there you come across skeleton leaves where only the\r\nveins are left, all the rest having disappeared.  But generally where\r\nthe leaves have kept moist they have changed to a dark brown mass which\r\nstill shows some of the structure of a leaf.  This is called leaf\r\nmould.  The top layer of soil in the wood is soft, dark in colour, and\r\nis evidently leaf mould mixed with sand or soil.\r\n\r\nLeaf mould is highly prized by gardeners, indeed gardeners will often\r\nmake a big heap of leaves in autumn and let them \"rot down\" and change\r\ninto mould.  If you can in autumn collect enough leaves to make a heap\r\nyou {34} should do so and leave it somewhere where the rain can fall on\r\nit, but cover it with a few small branches of trees to prevent the wind\r\nblowing the leaves away.  The heap shrinks a great deal during the\r\nfirst few months, and in the end it gives a supply of mould that will\r\nbe very useful if you want to grow any plants in pots.\r\n\r\nSome of the little hollows in the bank under a hedge, especially on\r\nchalky soils, are filled with leaf mould which has sometimes changed to\r\na black powder not looking at all like leaves.\r\n\r\nYou can also find mould in holes in decayed trees; here it has formed\r\nfrom the wood of the tree.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that dead leaves, etc., slowly change into a black or\r\nbrown substance, shrinking very much as they do so.  For this reason\r\nthey do not go on piling up year after year till finally they fill the\r\nwood; instead they decay or \"rot down\" to form leaf mould: the big pile\r\nof the autumn has changed by the next summer to a thin layer which\r\nmixes with the soil.\r\n\r\nWe want now to see what happens on a common or a piece of waste ground\r\nthat is not cultivated.  Grass and wild plants grow up in summer and\r\ndie during winter; their stems and roots are not taken away, but\r\nclearly they do not remain where they are, because next year new plants\r\ngrow up.  We may suppose that the dead roots and stems decay like the\r\nleaves did, and change to a brown or black mould.  It looks as if we\r\nare right, because on digging a hole or examining the side of a freshly\r\ncut ditch we shall find that the top layer of soil, just so far as the\r\nliving roots go, is darker in colour than the layer below.\r\n\r\nWe must, however, try and get some more proof, and to do this we must\r\nstudy some of our specimens a little {35} more closely.  We will take\r\nsome leaf mould, some black mould from a hollow in the bank, some from\r\na tree, soils from a wood, a well-manured garden, a field and some\r\nsubsoil.  All except the subsoil have a dark colour, but the wood and\r\ngarden soils are probably darker than the field soil.  Now weigh out 2\r\ngrains of each of these and heat in a dish as you did the soil on p. 4;\r\nnotice that all except the subsoil go black and then begin to smoulder,\r\nbut the moulds smoulder more than the soils.  Then weigh again and\r\ncalculate how much has burnt away in each case.  Here are some results\r\nthat have been obtained at Harpenden:--\r\n\r\n                                Amount      Percentage\r\n               Colour before      of         loss on      Colour of\r\n                  burning     smouldering    burning       residue\r\n\r\n  Leaf mould    dark brown       much          78.3       light grey\r\n\r\n  Mould from\r\n    dead tree     black          much          60.6       light grey\r\n\r\n  Soil from\r\n    wood       dark brown        less          43.4[1]      white\r\n\r\n  Soil from\r\n    garden     almost black      less          10.1          red\r\n\r\n  Soil from\r\n    field      brownish          still less     5.4          red\r\n\r\n  Subsoil        red             none           2.0          red\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mould nearly all burns away and its dark colour entirely goes, so\r\nalso does the dark colour of the soil.\r\n\r\nOur supposition explains why, in the case of soils, the less the\r\nblackness, the less the loss on burning.  If the {36} brown or black\r\ncombustible part is really mould formed by the decay of plant roots,\r\netc., then we should expect that as the percentage of mould in the soil\r\nincreased, so its blackness would increase and its loss on burning\r\nwould become greater.  This actually happens.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is our idea.  We suppose that the plants that have lived in\r\npast years have decayed to form a black material like leaf mould which\r\nstops in the soil, giving it a darkish colour.  The more mould there\r\nis, the darker the colour of the soil.  We know that along with this\r\ndecay there is a great deal of shrinkage.  As the black material is\r\nformed from the plant, it only extends as far into the soil as the\r\nplant roots go, so that there is a sharp change in colour about 6\r\ninches below the surface (see also p. 2).  Like the plant the black\r\nmaterial all burns away when the soil is heated sufficiently.\r\n\r\nThus we can explain all the facts we have observed, and in what seems a\r\nvery likely way.  This does not show that our supposition is correct,\r\nbut only that it is useful.  When you come to study science subjects\r\nyou will find such suppositions, or hypotheses as they are called, are\r\nfrequently used so long as they are found to be helpful.  In our\r\npresent case we could only get absolute proof that the black\r\ncombustible part of the soil really arose from the decay of plants by\r\nwatching the process of soil formation.  We shall turn later to this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe black material is known as humus.  Farmers and gardeners like a\r\nblack soil containing a good deal of humus because they find it very\r\nrich, and we shall see later on why this is so.  Vast areas of such\r\nsoils occurring in Manitoba, in Russia, and in Hungary are used for\r\n{37} wheat growing, while there are also areas in the Fen districts of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThere is something known as peat that looks rather like mould, but is\r\nreally so different that you must be careful not to confuse the two.\r\nPeat is not good for plants, and does not make the soil fertile, but\r\nquite the reverse.  You can see it being formed on a moor or bog, and\r\nyou should at the first opportunity go and examine it.  There was a\r\npeat bog near Wye that was examined with the following results.  The\r\npeat was very fibrous and had evidently been formed from plants.  It\r\nmade a layer about 2 feet thick and underneath it was a bed of clay;\r\nthis was discovered by examining the ditches, some of which cut right\r\nthrough the peat into the clay below.  A sample of the clay put into a\r\nfunnel, as on p. 14, did not allow water to pass through; this was also\r\nevident from the very wet nature of the ground.  The peat bed was below\r\nthe level of the surrounding land and was in a sort of basin; the water\r\ndraining from the higher land could all collect there but could not run\r\naway, indeed it might very well have been a shallow lake.  It was quite\r\nclear that the plants as they died would _decay in very wet soil_, and\r\nso the conditions are very different from those we have just been\r\nstudying where the plants _decay in soil that is only moist_.  This\r\ndifference at once shows itself in the fact that peat generally forms a\r\nthick layer, while mould only rarely does so.  In the north of England\r\nthe moors lie high, but here again the peat bed is like a saucer or\r\nbasin, and there is soil or rock below that does not let the rain water\r\npass through.  For a great part of the year the beds are very wet.\r\n\r\n{38}\r\n\r\nLook at a piece of peat and notice how very fibrous it is, quite unlike\r\nleaf mould.  When it is dry peat easily burns and is much used as fuel\r\nin parts of Scotland, Wales and Ireland.   It is cut in blocks during\r\nthe spring, left to dry in heaps during summer, and then carried away\r\nin autumn.  Fig. 19 shows a peat bog with cutting going on.  Peat does\r\nnot easily catch light and the fires are generally kept burning all\r\nnight; there is no great flame such as you get with a coal fire, but\r\nstill there is quite a nice heat.\r\n\r\nPeat has a remarkable power of absorbing water.  Fill an egg-cup with\r\npeat, packing it as tightly as you possibly can, and then put it under\r\nwater and leave for some days.  The peat becomes very wet and swells\r\nconsiderably, overflowing the cup just like the clay did on p. 12.\r\nAfter long and heavy rains peat in bogs swells up so much that it may\r\nbecome dangerous; if the bog is on the side of a hill, the peat may\r\noverflow and run down the hill like a river, carrying everything before\r\nit.  Such overflows sometimes occur in Ireland and they used to occur\r\nin the north of England; you can read about one on Pendle Hill in\r\nHarrison Ainsworth's _Lancashire Witches_.  But they do not take place\r\nwhen ditches are cut in the bog so that the water can flow away instead\r\nof soaking in; this has been done in England.\r\n\r\nThis great power of absorbing water and other liquids, so terrible when\r\nit leads to overflows, enables peat to be put to various uses, and a\r\ngood deal of it is sold as peat-moss, for use in stables.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.  Cutting and carrying peat for fuel, Hoy,\r\nOrkney]\r\n\r\nIn the ditches of a peat bog red slimy masses can often be found.  They\r\nlook just like rusty iron, and in fact they do contain a good deal of\r\niron, but there are also a number of tiny little living things present.\r\nThe {40} stones and grit just under the peat are usually white, all the\r\nred material from them having been washed out by the water which has\r\nsoaked through the peat.  Then at the ditch these tiny living things\r\ntake up the red material because it is useful to them.  Peat or\r\n\"moorland\" water can also dissolve lead from lead pipes and may\r\ntherefore be dangerous for drinking purposes unless it is specially\r\npurified.  When you study chemistry you will be able to show that both\r\npeat itself and moorland waters are \"acid\" while good mould is not.\r\nThat is why peat is not good for cultivated plants (see also p. 96).\r\n\r\nOther things besides peat are formed when plants decay under water.  If\r\nyou stir up the bottom of a stagnant pond with a stick bubbles of gas\r\nrise to the surface and will burn if a lighted match is put to them.\r\nThis gas is called marsh gas.  Very unpleasant and unwholesome gases\r\nare also formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The top two inches of soil only were collected here, and there were\r\nmany leaves, twigs, etc. mixed in.  Soils from different woods vary\r\nconsiderably.  If the sample is taken to a greater depth the loss on\r\nburning is much less, and may be only 5 or 6 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{41}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE PLANT FOOD IN THE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nApparatus required.\r\n\r\n_The pot experiments (p. xiii)._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a rare sight in England to see land in a natural uncultivated\r\nstate devoid of vegetation.  The hills are covered with grasses and\r\nbushes, the moors with ling and heather, commons with grass, bracken\r\nand gorse, a garden tends to become smothered in weeds, and even a\r\ngravel path will not long remain free from grass.  It is clear that\r\nsoil is well suited for the growth of plants.  We will make a few\r\nexperiments to see what we can find out about this property of soil.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that a good deal of the soil is sand or grit, and we shall\r\nwant to know whether this, like soil, can support plant life.  We have\r\nalso found that the subsoil is unlike the top soil in several ways, and\r\nso we shall want to see how it behaves towards plants.  Fill a pot with\r\nsoil taken from the top nine inches of an arable field or untrenched\r\npart of the garden; another with subsoil taken from the lower depth, 9\r\nto 18 inches, and a third with clean builder's sand or washed sea-sand.\r\nSow with rye or mustard, and thin out when the seeds are up.  Keep the\r\npots together and equally well supplied with water; the plants then\r\nhave as good a chance of growth in one pot as in any other.\r\n\r\n{42}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.  Rye growing in surface soil (Pot 3), subsoil\r\n(Pot 4), and sand (Pot 5)]\r\n\r\n{43}\r\n\r\nFigs. 20 and 21 are photographs of sets of plants grown in this way;\r\nthe weights in grains were:--\r\n\r\n                            Green weight           After drying\r\n\r\n                           Rye    Mustard         Rye    Mustard\r\n\r\n  Plants grown in\r\n    top soil (Pot 3)       14.5     17.7          5.6      2.6\r\n\r\n    \"      \"   \"\r\n    subsoil (Pot 4)         2.9      5.1          1.6      1.1\r\n\r\n    \"      \"   \"\r\n    sand (Pot 5)            2.0      4.6          0.8      1.0\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.  Mustard growing in surface soil (Pot 3),\r\nsubsoil (Pot 4), sand (Pot 5)]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plants in the soil remained green and made steady growth.  Those in\r\nthe sand never showed any signs of getting on, their leaves turned\r\nyellow and {44} fell off; in spite of the care they received, and the\r\nwater, warmth and air given them, they looked starved, and that, in\r\nfact, is what they really were.  Nor did those in the subsoil fare much\r\nbetter.  The experiment shows that the top soil gives the plant\r\nsomething that it wants for growth and that it cannot get either from\r\nsand or from the subsoil; this something we will call \"plant food.\"\r\n\r\nFurther proof is easily obtained.  At a clay or gravel pit little or no\r\nvegetation is to be seen on the sloping sides or on the level at the\r\nbottom, although the surface soil is carrying plants that shed\r\ninnumerable seeds.  A heap of subsoil thrown up from a newly made well,\r\nor the excavations of a house, lies bare for a long time.  The\r\npractical man has long since discovered these facts.  A gardener is\r\nmost particular to keep the top soil on the top, and not to bury it,\r\nwhen he is trenching.  In levelling a piece of ground for a cricket\r\npitch or tennis court, it is not enough to lift the turf and make a\r\nlevel surface; the work has to be done so that at every point there is\r\nsufficient depth of top soil in which the grass roots may grow.\r\n\r\nHow much plant food is there in the top soil?  To answer this question\r\nwe must compare soil that has been cropped with soil that has been kept\r\nfallow, i.e. moist but uncropped.  Tip out some of the soil that has\r\nbeen cropped with rye, and examine it.  Remove the rye roots, then\r\nreplace the soil in the pot and sow with mustard; sow also a fallow pot\r\nwith mustard.  Keep both pots properly watered.  The soil that has\r\ncarried a crop is soon seen to be much the poorer of the two.  Fig. 22\r\nshows the plants, while their weights in grams were:--\r\n\r\n{45}\r\n\r\n                                      Green weight    After drying\r\n\r\n  Mustard growing in soil previously\r\n    cropped with rye, Pot 1               17.8            62.3\r\n\r\n  Mustard growing in soil previously\r\n    uncropped, Pot 2                       3.3             8.6\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.  Mustard growing in surface soil previously\r\ncropped with rye (Pot 1) and in surface soil previously uncropped (Pot\r\n2)]\r\n\r\n{46}\r\n\r\nThe rye has taken most of the plant food that was in Pot 1 leaving very\r\nlittle for the second crop.  Our soil therefore contained only a little\r\nplant food, not more, in fact, than will properly feed one crop.  But\r\nyet it did not seem to have altered in any way, even in weight, in\r\nconsequence of the plant food being taken out.  In our experiment the\r\nsoil was dried and weighed before and after the mustard was grown; the\r\nresults were:--\r\n\r\n                                                Pot 2     Pot 2_a_\r\n\r\n                                              lbs.  oz.   lbs.  oz.\r\n\r\n  Weight of dried soil before the experiment   6    6      6    7\r\n\r\n     \"        \"    \"    after  \"      \"        6    6      6    6\r\n                                               ------      ------\r\n                                  Difference   0    0      0    1\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experiment is not good enough to tell us exactly how much plant\r\nfood was present at the beginning.  But we can say that the amount of\r\nplant food in the soil is too small to be detected by such weighing as\r\nwe can do.\r\n\r\nHere is an account of a similar experiment made 300 years ago by van\r\nHelmont in Brussels, and it is interesting because it is one of the\r\nfirst scientific experiments on plant growth:--\r\n\r\n\"I took an earthen vessel in which I put 200 pounds of soil dried in an\r\noven, then I moistened with rain water and pressed hard into it a shoot\r\nof willow weighing 5 pounds.  After exactly five years the tree that\r\nhad grown up weighed 169 pounds and about 3 ounces.  But the vessel had\r\nnever received anything but rain water or distilled water to moisten\r\nthe soil (when this was necessary), and it remained full of soil which\r\nwas still tightly packed, and lest any dust from outside should have\r\ngot into the soil it was covered with a sheet {47} of iron coated with\r\ntin but perforated with many holes.  I did not take the weight of the\r\nleaves that fell in the autumn.  In the end I dried the soil once more,\r\nand got the same 200 pounds that I started with, less about two ounces.\r\nTherefore the 164 pounds of wood, bark and root arose from the water\r\nalone.\"  The experiment is wonderfully good and shows how very little\r\nplant food there is in the soil.  The conclusion is not quite right,\r\nhowever, although it was for many years accepted as proof of an ancient\r\nbelief, which you will find mentioned in Kingsley's _Westward Ho!_,\r\nthat all things arose from water.  It is now known that the last\r\nsentence should read, \"Therefore the 164 pounds of wood, bark and root\r\narose chiefly from the water _and air_, but a small part came from the\r\nsoil also.\"\r\n\r\nBut to return to our experiment with Pots 1 and 2.  They had been kept\r\nmoist before the mustard was sown.  Did this moisture have any effect\r\non the soil?  Take two of the pots that have been kept dry and\r\nuncropped, and two that have been kept moist and uncropped, also one of\r\ndry uncropped subsoil and one of moist uncropped subsoil.  Sow rye or\r\nmustard in each pot and keep them all equally supplied with water.\r\n\r\nIt is soon evident that the top soil is richer in plant food than the\r\nsubsoil, and the soil stored moist is rather richer than that stored\r\ndry, although the difference here is less marked.  In an experiment in\r\nwhich the soils were put up early in July and sown at the end of\r\nSeptember the weights of crops in grams obtained were:--\r\n\r\n{48}\r\n\r\n                                      Green weight   After drying\r\n\r\n  Plants grown in top soil stored in      16.9           2.6\r\n    moist condition (Pots 10 & 11)        18.9           2.8\r\n\r\n  Plants grown in top soil stored in      12.1           1.8\r\n    dry condition (Pots 8 & 9)            14.4           1.9\r\n\r\n  Plants grown in subsoil stored in\r\n    moist condition (Pot 13)               5.5           0.9\r\n\r\n  Plants grown in subsoil stored in\r\n    dry condition (Pot 12)                 5.6           0.8\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crops on Pots 10 and 11 ought of course to weigh the same, and so\r\nshould the crops on Pots 8 and 9.  The differences arise from the error\r\nof the experiment.  In all experimental work, however carefully carried\r\nout or however skilful the operator, there is some error.\r\n\r\nThere is clearly an increase in crop as a result of storing the surface\r\nsoil in a moist condition, showing that additional plant food has been\r\n_made_, since these pots were put up.  On the other hand it does not\r\nappear that much plant food has been made in the subsoil during this\r\ntime.  Further evidence on this point is given by an experiment similar\r\nto that in Fig. 22, but where mustard is grown in _subsoil_ kept moist,\r\nbut uncropped for some time, and in _subsoil_ previously cropped with\r\nrye.  The results in grams were:--\r\n\r\n                                     Green weight    After drying\r\n\r\n  Mustard growing in subsoil\r\n    previously cropped with rye          12.6            2.27\r\n\r\n  Mustard growing in subsoil\r\n    previously uncropped                 12.9            2.26\r\n\r\n{49}\r\n\r\nThese should be compared with the figures on p. 45.  Although the\r\nsubsoil lay fallow for a long time it produced no plant food but is\r\njust as poor as the subsoil that has been previously cropped.  These\r\nobservations give us a clue that must be followed up in answering our\r\nnext question.\r\n\r\nWhat has the plant food been made from?  Clearly it is not made from\r\nthe sand, the clay or the chalk since all these occur in the subsoil.\r\nWe have seen (Chap. I.) that the top soil differs from the subsoil in\r\ncontaining a quantity of material that will burn away and is in part at\r\nany rate made up of plant remains.  It will be easy to find out whether\r\nthese remains furnish any appreciable quantity of plant food.\r\n\r\nFill one pot with surface soil and another with the same weight of\r\nsurface soil well mixed up with 30 grams of plant remains--pieces of\r\ngrass, or stems and leaves of other plants cut up into fragments about\r\nhalf an inch long.  At the same time put up two pots of subsoil, one of\r\nwhich, as before, is mixed with 30 grains of plant remains, and also\r\nput up two pots of sand, one containing 30 grams of plant remains and\r\nthe other none.  Sow all six pots with mustard and keep watered and\r\nwell tended.  The result of one experiment is shown in Fig. 23 and the\r\nweights of the crop in grams were:--\r\n\r\n                                      Green weight    After drying\r\n\r\n  Top soil and pieces of plants (Pot 6)   42.0           5.0\r\n\r\n  Top soil alone (Pot 3)                  17.7           2.6\r\n\r\n      Difference in top soil              24.3           2.4\r\n\r\n\r\n{50}\r\n\r\n                                        Green weight  After drying\r\n\r\n  Subsoil and pieces of plants (Pot 7)       10.5         1.9\r\n\r\n  Subsoil alone (Pot 4)                       5.1         1.1\r\n\r\n       Difference in subsoil                  5.4         0.8\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.  Pieces of grass, leaves, etc. change into\r\nplant food in the surface but not to any great extent in the subsoil.\r\nMustard is growing in surface soil (Pot 3), in surface soil and pieces\r\nof grass (Pot 6), in subsoil (Pot 4), and in subsoil and grass (Pot 7)]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow let us look at these results carefully.  The experiment with\r\nsurface soil shows that the pieces of stem and leaf have furnished a\r\ngood deal of food to the mustard and have caused a gain of 24.3 grams\r\nin the crop.  If we knew what the pieces were made of we {51} could\r\npush the experiment still further and find out more about plant food,\r\nbut this involves chemical problems and must be left alone for the\r\npresent.  We can, however, say that plant remains are an important\r\nsource of plant food, and since we suppose the black material of the\r\nsoil to be made of plant remains (see p. 36), it will be quite fair to\r\nsay also that this black material, the humus, is a source of plant\r\nfood.  We have therefore answered the question we set, and we can\r\nexplain some at any rate of the differences between the surface soil\r\nand the subsoil.  The surface soil contains a great deal of the black\r\nmaterial, which forms plant food, while the subsoil does not.  Thus\r\nplants grow well on the surface soil and starve on the subsoil.  We can\r\nalso explain why gardeners and farmers speak of black soils as rich\r\nsoils; they contain more than other soils of this black material that\r\nmakes plant food.  Still further, we can explain why the farmer often\r\nsows plants like mustard, tares or clover, and then ploughs them into\r\nthe ground.  They are not wasted, but they make food for the next crop\r\nthat goes in.\r\n\r\nNow let us turn to the results of the subsoil experiments.  The leaves\r\nand stems have increased the crop, but only by 5.4 grams: they have not\r\nbeen nearly so effective as in the surface soil.  It is evident that\r\nthe mustard did not feed directly on the leaves and stems put in; if it\r\nhad there should have been an equal gain in both cases.  The leaves and\r\nstems clearly have to undergo some change before they are made into\r\nplant food and the soil has something to do with this change.  After\r\nthe crops are cut the soils should be tipped out and examined.  More of\r\nthe original pieces of leaf and stem are found in the subsoil than in\r\nthe surface {52} soil.  That is to say, there has been more change in\r\nPot 6 containing surface soil than in Pot 7 containing subsoil.  The\r\n\"something,\" whatever it may be, that changes plant remains like\r\nleaves, stems, pieces of grass, roots, etc. into plant food therefore\r\nacts better in the surface soil than in the subsoil.  Here then we have\r\nanother difference between surface and subsoils.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.  The experimental results obtained in this chapter may now be\r\nsummed up as follows:--\r\n\r\n(1) Plant food is present in the top soil only and not to any extent in\r\nthe subsoil.\r\n\r\n(2) There is not much present, so little indeed that we could not\r\ndetect it by weighing.\r\n\r\n(3) It is, however, always being made in the top soil, if water is\r\npresent.  Only little is made from the subsoil.\r\n\r\n(4) The remains of leaves, stems, roots, etc. furnish an important\r\nsource of plant food.\r\n\r\n(5) But they have first to undergo some change, and the agent producing\r\nthis change is more active in the top soil than in the subsoil.\r\n\r\n(6) The top soil is much the most useful part of the soil and should\r\nnever be buried during digging or trenching, but always carefully kept\r\non top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{53}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE DWELLERS IN THE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nApparatus required.\r\n\r\n_Garden soil.  Six bottles and corks [1].  Twelve Erlenmeyer flasks, 50\r\nc.c. capacity [2].  Cotton wool.  Milk (about half a pint).  Leaf\r\ngelatine.  Soil baked in an oven.  Six saucers [3].  The apparatus in\r\nFig. 28 (two lots).  Wash bottle containing lime water (Fig. 27, also\r\np. 19)._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn digging a garden a number of little animals are found, such as\r\nearthworms, beetles, ants, centipedes, millipedes and others.  There\r\nare also some very curious forms of vegetable life.  By carefully\r\nlooking about it is not difficult to find patches of soil covered with\r\na greenish slimy growth; they are found best under bushes where the\r\nsoil is not disturbed, or else where the soil has been pressed down by\r\na footmark and not touched since.  Any good soil left undisturbed for a\r\ntime shows this growth.\r\n\r\nPut some fresh moist garden soil into a bottle and cork it up tightly\r\nso that it keeps moist.  Write the date on the bottle and then leave it\r\nin the light where you can easily see it.  After a time--sometimes a\r\nlong, sometimes a shorter time--the soil becomes covered with a slimy\r\ngrowth, greenish in colour, mingled here and there with reddish brown.\r\nThe longer the {54} soil is left the better.  Often after several\r\nmonths something further happens; little ferns begin to grow and they\r\nlive a very long time indeed.  There is at Rothamsted a bottle of soil\r\nthat was put up just like this as far back as 1874.  For a number of\r\nyears past a beautiful fern has been growing inside the bottle, and\r\neven now it is very healthy and vigorous.  If, instead of being kept\r\nmoist, the rich garden soil is left in a dry shed during the whole of\r\nthe winter so that it gradually loses its moisture, it will generally\r\nshow quite a lot of white fluffy growth.\r\n\r\nAll of these living things are very wonderful, and some, especially\r\nearthworms, are very useful to gardeners and farmers.\r\n\r\nAfter a shower of rain look carefully in the garden or else on a lawn,\r\ncommon, or pasture field where the grass is closely grazed by cattle or\r\ndoes not naturally grow long, and you will find numbers of tiny heaps\r\nof soil scattered about.  Carefully brush away a heap and a little hole\r\nis seen, now hit the ground near it a few times with a stick or stamp\r\non it with your foot and the worm, if he is near the top, comes up.\r\nWhen he is safely out of the way dig carefully down with a knife or\r\ntrowel so as to examine the hole or \"burrow.\"  At the top you generally\r\nfind it lined with pieces of grass or leaves that the worm has pulled\r\nin; lower down the lining comes to an end, but the colour of the burrow\r\nis redder than that of the rest of the soil wherever the soil has a\r\ngreenish tinge.  These holes are useful because they let air and water\r\ndown into the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.  Soil in which earthworms have been living and\r\nmaking burrows]\r\n\r\nThe following experiment shows what earthworms can do.  Fill a pot with\r\nsoil from which all the worms have been carefully picked out and\r\nanother {55} with soil to which earthworms have been added, one worm to\r\nevery pound of soil.  Leave them out of doors where the rain can fall\r\non to them.  You can soon see the burrows and the heaps of soil or\r\n\"casts\" thrown up by the worms: these casts wash or blow over the\r\nsurface of the soil, continually covering it with a thin layer of\r\nmaterial brought up from below.  Consequently the soil containing\r\nearthworms always has {56} a fresh clean look.  After some time the\r\nother soil becomes very compact and is covered with a greenish slimy\r\ngrowth.  When this happens carefully turn the pots upside down, knock\r\nthem so as to detach the soil and lift them off.  The soil where the\r\nearthworms had lived is full of burrows and looks almost like a sponge.\r\nFig. 24 shows what happened in an experiment lasting from June to\r\nOctober.  The other soil where there were no earthworms shows no such\r\nburrows and is rather more compact than when it was put in.\r\n\r\nEarthworms therefore do three things:--\r\n\r\n(1) They make burrows in the ground and so let in air and water.\r\n\r\n(2) They drag leaves into the soil and thus help to make the mixture of\r\nsoil and leaf mould.\r\n\r\n(3) They keep on bringing fresh soil up to the surface, and they\r\ndisturb the surface so much that it is always clean and free from the\r\nslimy growth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these things are very useful and so a gardener should never want to\r\nkill worms.  The great naturalist, Darwin, spent a long time in\r\nstudying earthworms at his home in Kent and wrote a very interesting\r\nbook about them, called _Earthworms and Vegetable Mould_.  He shows\r\nthat each year worms bring up about 1/50th of an inch of soil, so that\r\nif you laid a penny on the soil now and no one took it, in 50 years it\r\nmight be covered with an inch of soil.  Pavements that were on the\r\nsurface when the Romans occupied Britain are now covered with a thick\r\nlayer of soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.  Fresh soil turns milk bad, but baked soil does\r\nnot]\r\n\r\nBut besides these there are some living things too small to see, that\r\nhave only been found by careful experiments, but you can easily repeat\r\nsome of these {57} experiments yourselves.  Divide a little rich garden\r\nsoil into two parts and bake one in the kitchen oven on a patty tin.\r\nPour a little milk into each of two small flasks, stop up with cotton\r\nwool (see Fig. 25) and boil for a few minutes very carefully so that\r\nthe milk does not boil over, then allow to cool.  Next carefully take\r\nout the stopper from one of the flasks and drop in a little of the\r\nbaked soil, label the flask \"baked soil\" and put back the stopper.\r\nInto the other flask drop a little of the untouched soil and label it;\r\nleave both flasks in a warm place till the next day.  Carefully open\r\nthe stoppers and smell the milk: the baked soil has done nothing and\r\nthe milk smells perfectly sweet; the unbaked soil, on the other hand,\r\nhas made the milk bad and it smells like cheese.  If you have a good\r\nmicroscope you can go further: look at a drop of the liquid from each\r\nflask and you find in each case the {58} round fat globules of the\r\nmilk, but the bad milk contains in addition some tiny creatures,\r\nlooking like very short pins, darting in and out among the fat\r\nglobules.  These living things must have come from the unbaked soil or\r\nthey would have been present in both flasks: they must also have been\r\nkilled by baking in the oven.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.  Soils contain tiny things that grow on\r\ngelatine]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother experiment is easy but takes a little longer to show.  Mix two\r\nsheets of leaf gelatine with a quarter {59} of a pint of boiling water,\r\npour into each of three saucers, and cover over with plates.  Then stir\r\nup some baked soil in a cup half full of cold boiled water, and quickly\r\nput a teaspoonful of the liquid into a second cup, also half full of\r\ncold boiled water.  Stir quickly and put a spoonful on to the jelly,\r\ntilting it about so that it covers the whole surface and label the\r\nsaucer \"baked soil.\"  Do the same with the \"unbaked soil,\" labelling\r\nthe saucer; leave the third jelly alone and label it \"untouched.\"\r\nCover all three with plates and leave in a warm place.  After a day or\r\nso little specks begin to appear on the jelly containing the unbaked\r\nsoil, but not on the others (Fig. 26); they grow larger, and before\r\nlong they change the jelly to a liquid.  The other jellies {60} show\r\nvery few specks and are little altered.  These creatures making the\r\nspecks came from the soil because so few are found on the jelly alone;\r\nthey were killed in the baking and so do not occur on the baked soil\r\njelly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.  Bottle containing lime water, used to show\r\nthat breath makes lime water milky]\r\n\r\nYou can also show that breathing is going on in the soil even after you\r\nhave picked out every living thing that you can see.  First of all you\r\nmust do a little experiment with your own breathing so that you may\r\nknow how to start.  Shake up a little fresh lime with water and leave\r\nit to stand for 24 hours.  Pour a little of the clear liquid into a\r\nflask or bottle fitted with a cork and two tubes, one long and one\r\nshort like that shown in Fig. 27.  Then breathe in through the tube _A_\r\nso that the air you take in comes through the lime water: notice that\r\nno change occurs.  Next breathe out through the tube _B_ so that your\r\nbreath passes through the lime water; this time the lime water turns\r\nvery milky.  You therefore alter in some way the air that you breathe:\r\nyou know also that you need fresh air.\r\n\r\nNow we can get on with our soil experiments.  Take two small flasks of\r\nequal size fitted with corks and joined by a glass tube bent like a U\r\nwith the ends curled over.  Put some lime water into each flask and a\r\nlittle water in the U-tube.  Now make a small muslin bag like a\r\nsausage: fill it with moist fresh garden soil, tie it up with a silk\r\nthread and hang it in one of the flasks by holding the end of the\r\nthread outside and pushing in the cork till it is held firmly (see Fig.\r\n28).  Fix on the other flask, and after about five minutes mark the\r\nlevel of the liquid with a piece of stamp paper; leave in a warm place\r\nbut out of the sun.  {61} In one or two days you will see that the\r\nwater in the U-tube has moved towards the soil flask, showing that some\r\nair has been used up by the soil; further, the lime water has turned\r\nmilky.  But in the other flask, where there is no soil, the lime water\r\nremains quite clear.\r\n\r\nThis proves, then, that some of the tiny creatures want air just as\r\nmuch as we do.  The air readies them through passages in the soil,\r\nthrough the burrows of earthworms and other animals, or by man's\r\nefforts in digging and ploughing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.  A bag of soil is fixed into a flask containing\r\nlime water.  In a few days some of the air has been used up, and the\r\nlime water has turned milky]\r\n\r\nNow try the experiment with very dry garden soil: little or no change\r\ntakes place.  As soon as you add water, however, breathing begins\r\nagain, air is absorbed and the lime water turns milky just as before.\r\nWater is therefore wanted just as much as air.\r\n\r\nIf you had very magnifying eyes and could see things so enlarged that\r\nthese little creatures seemed to {62} you to be an inch long, and if\r\nyou looked down into the soil, it would seem to you to be an\r\nextraordinarily wonderful place.  The little grains of soil would look\r\nlike great rocks and on them you would see creatures of all shapes and\r\nsizes moving about, and feeding on whatever was suitable to them, some\r\nbeing destroyed by others very much larger than themselves, some\r\napparently dead or asleep, yet waking up whenever it becomes warmer or\r\nthere was a little more moisture.  You would see them changing useless\r\ndead roots and leaves into very valuable plant food; indeed it is they\r\nthat bring about the changes observed in the experiments of Chap. VI.\r\nOccasionally you would see a very strange sight indeed--a great\r\nsnake-like creature, over three miles long and nearly half a mile\r\nround, would rush along devouring everything before it and leave behind\r\nit a great tunnel down which a mighty river would suddenly pour, and\r\nwhat do you think it would be?  What you now call an earthworm and\r\nthink is four inches long, going through the soil leaving its burrow\r\nalong which a drop of water trickles!  That shows you how tiny these\r\nlittle soil creatures are.\r\n\r\nThese busy little creatures are called micro-organisms because of their\r\nsmall size.  But they are not all useful.  Some can turn milk bad as we\r\nhave already seen, and therefore all jugs and dishes must be kept clean\r\nlest any of them should be present.  Others can cause disease.  It has\r\nhappened that a child who has cut its finger and has got some soil into\r\nthe cut, and not washed it out at once, has been made very ill.  You\r\nmay sometimes notice sheep limping about in the fields, especially in\r\ndamp fields; an organism gets into the foot and causes trouble.\r\n\r\n{63}\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.  The soil is full of living things, some large like earth\r\nworms, others very small.  Earthworms are very useful: they make\r\nburrows in the soil, thus allowing air and water to get in: they drag\r\nin leaves and they keep on covering the surface with soil from below.\r\nBesides these and the other large creatures, there are micro-organisms\r\nso small that they cannot be seen without a very good microscope: they\r\nlive and breathe and require air, water and food.  Some are very useful\r\nand change dead parts of plants or animals into valuable plant food.\r\nAlmost anything that can be consumed by fire can be consumed by them.\r\nOthers are harmful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{64}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL AND THE PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\nApparatus required.\r\n\r\n_Dry powdered soil, sand, clay, leaf mould, seeds.  Six funnels, disks,\r\nstands and glass jars [3].  Six glass tubes about 1/2 in. diameter and\r\n18 in. long [2].  Muslin, string, three beakers.  Six lamp chimneys\r\nstanding in tin lids [3].  Pot experiments (p. xiii), growing plant.\r\nTwo test tubes fitted with split corks (Fig. 35)._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have ever tried to grow a plant in a pot you must have\r\ndiscovered that it needs much attention if it is to be kept alive.  It\r\nwants water or it withers; it must be kept warm enough or it is killed\r\nby cold; it has to be fed or it gets yellow and starved; also it needs\r\nfresh air and light.  These five things are necessary for the plant:\r\n\r\n    Water,\r\n    Warmth,\r\n    Food,\r\n    Fresh air,\r\n    Light.\r\n\r\nWe may add a sixth: there must be no harmful substance present in the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nWild plants growing in their native haunts get no attention and yet\r\ntheir wants are supplied.  We will try and find out how this is done.\r\n\r\n{65}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.  Loam and sand both retain water, but loam\r\nbetter than sand]\r\n\r\n\r\nWater comes from the rain, but the rain does not fall every day.  How\r\ndo the plants manage to get water on dry days?  A simple experiment\r\nwill show you one way.  Put about four tablespoonsful of dry soil on to\r\nthe funnel shown in Fig. 29 and then pour on two tablespoonsful of\r\nwater.  Measure what runs through.  You will find it very little; most\r\nof the water sticks to the soil.  Even after several days the soil was\r\nstill rather moist.  Soil has the power of keeping a certain amount of\r\nwater in reserve for the plant, it only allows a small part of the rain\r\nto run through.  Do the experiment also with sand, powdered clay, and\r\nleaf mould.  Some water always remains behind, but less in the case of\r\nsand than in the others.  In one {66} experiment 30 cubic centimetres\r\nof water were poured on to 50 grains of soil but only 10 cubic\r\ncentimetres passed through, but when an equal amount was poured on to\r\n50 grains of sand no less than 20 cubic centimetres passed through.\r\nVery sandy soils, therefore, possess less power of storing water than\r\ndo soils with more clay or mould in them, such as loams, clays or black\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.  Water can rise upwards in soil.  It can, in\r\nfact, travel in any direction, from wet to dry places]\r\n\r\nFurther, water has a wonderful power of passing from wet places to dry\r\nplaces in the soil.  Tie a piece of muslin over the end of a tube and\r\nfill with dry soil, tapping it down as much as you can, then stand the\r\ntube in water as in Fig. 30.  Fill another with sand {68} and place in\r\nwater.  Notice that the water at once begins to rise in both tubes and\r\nwill go on for a long time, always passing from the wet to the dry\r\nplaces.  It rises higher in the soil than it does in the sand.  Enough\r\nwater may pass up the tube in this way to supply the needs of a growing\r\nplant.  Fill a glass lamp chimney with dry soil, packing it down\r\ntightly, put into water and then sow with wheat.  The plants grow very\r\nwell.  A longer tube may be made from two chimneys fastened together by\r\nmeans of a tin collar stuck on with Canada balsam or sealing wax (Fig.\r\n31).  Our plants grew well in this also, but on a sandier soil, where\r\nthe water could not rise so high, it might happen that they would not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.  Wheat growing in soils supplied from below\r\nwith water.  All the water the plant gets has to travel upwards]\r\n\r\nThus we shall expect great differences in the moisture of various\r\nsoils.  In some districts there is much more rain than in others, and\r\ntherefore the soils get a larger supply of water.  Sandy soils allow\r\nwater to run through while a loam holds it like a sponge, in a loam\r\nalso the water readily moves from wet to dry places.  Further, water\r\nruns down hills and collects in low-lying hollows or valleys; here,\r\ntherefore, the soil is moister than it is somewhat higher up.  What\r\nwill be the effect of these moisture differences on plants?\r\n\r\nYou must find out in two ways.  Visit a soil that you know is dry--a\r\nsandy, gravelly or chalky soil in a high situation--and look carefully\r\nat the plants there, then go to some moister, lower ground and see what\r\nthe plants show.  You cannot be quite certain, however, that anything\r\nyou see is simply due to water supply, because there may be other\r\ndifferences in the soil as well.  So you must try the second method,\r\nand that is to find out by experiments what is the effect of varying\r\n{69} quantities of water on the plant growth.  Both methods must be\r\nused, but it may be more convenient to start the experiments first, and\r\nwhile they are going on to collect observations in your rambles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.  Mustard growing in soils supplied with varying\r\nquantities of water.  16 very little water, 3 a nice amount of water,\r\n15 too much water]\r\n\r\nFill four glazed pots with dry soil: keep one dry; one only just moist;\r\nthe third is to be very moist and should be watered more frequently\r\nthan the second; and the fourth is to be kept flooded with water, any\r\nway out being stopped up.  Sow wheat or mustard in all four and keep\r\nout of the rain.  The result of one experiment with mustard is shown in\r\nFig. 32.  Where no water was supplied there was no growth and the seeds\r\nremained unaltered.  Where only little water was supplied (Pot 16) the\r\nplants made some growth, but not very much: the leaves were small and\r\nshowed no great vigour; {70} where sufficient water was given (Pot 3)\r\nthe plants grew very well and had thick stems and large leaves; where\r\ntoo much water was given (Pot 15) the plants were very sickly and small.\r\n\r\nThe weights were:--\r\n\r\n                                       Green weight   After drying\r\n\r\n  Plants with too much water               3.9            0.5\r\n\r\n    \"     \"   too little water             5.3            0.9\r\n\r\n    \"     \"   a nice quantity of water    17.7            2.6\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 33 shows two pots of wheat, one kept only just sufficiently moist\r\nfor growth, the other kept very moist but not too wet.  You can see\r\nwhat a difference there is; in the drier pot the leaves are rather\r\nnarrow and the plants are small, in the moister pot the leaves are wide\r\nand the plants big.  But there was also another difference that the\r\nphotograph does not bring out very well--the plants in the rather dry\r\nsoil were, as you can see, in full ear, ripe and yellow, while those in\r\nthe very moist soil were still green and growing.  We see then\r\n\r\n(1) that on moist soils there is greater growth than on dry soils, but\r\nthe plants do not ripen so quickly;\r\n\r\n(2) in very wet soils mustard--and many other plants also--will not\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater is not itself harmful.  It is easy to grow many plants in water\r\ncontaining the proper food, but _air must be blown through the water at\r\nfrequent intervals_.  In the water-logged soil of Pot 15 the trouble\r\narose not from too much water but from too little air.  Air is wanted\r\nbecause plants are living and {71} breathing in every part, in the\r\nroots as well as in the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.  This wheat growing on very moist soil was\r\nstill green and growing vigorously, whilst this wheat growing on rather\r\ndry soil was yellow and ripe]\r\n\r\nNow turn to what you have seen in your walks.  You would probably\r\nnotice that on the drier, sandy or gravel ground there was nothing like\r\nas great a growth of grass or of other plants as on the moister soil.\r\nThis is so much like what we found in the pot experiments that we shall\r\nnot be wrong in supposing that the difference in water supply largely\r\naccounted for the difference in growth.  But you may also have noticed\r\nsomething else.  Plants in the drier soil have generally {72} narrow\r\nleaves and the grasses are rolled up and fine, whilst those on the damp\r\nsoil, including the grasses, have usually broad leaves.  Thus in the\r\ndry sandy soil you may find broom, spurrey, sheep's fescue, pine trees,\r\nall with narrow leaves; whilst on the moister soil you may find\r\nburdock, primroses, cocksfoot and other broad-leaved plants.  Figs. 34\r\n_a_ and _b_ show some plants we found on a dry, gravelly patch on\r\nHarpenden common, and on a moist loam in the river valley below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34 _a_.  Plants collected on dry sandy soil.\r\nBroom, sheep's fescue, crested dogstail and gorse, all with narrow\r\nleaves]\r\n\r\n{73}\r\n\r\nBefore we can account for this observation, we must ascertain a little\r\nmore closely what becomes of the water the plant takes up.  It\r\ncertainly does not all stay in the plant, and the only way out seems to\r\nbe through the leaves.  Put a test tube on the leaf of a growing plant\r\nand fix a split cork round the stem: leave in sunlight for a few hours\r\nand notice that water begins to collect in the test tube (Fig. 35).\r\nThe experiment shows that water passes out of the plant through the\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34 _b_.  Plants collected on moist loam.  All have\r\nwide leaves]\r\n\r\nThis experiment was first made by Stephen Hales, and described by him\r\nthus in 1727: \"Having by many {74} evident proofs in the foregoing\r\nexperiments seen the great quantities of liquor that were imbibed and\r\nperspired by trees, I was desirous to try if I could get any of this\r\nperspiring matter; and in order to do it, I took several glass chymical\r\nretorts, _b a p_ [Fig. 36] and put the boughs of several sorts of\r\ntrees, as they were growing with their leaves on, into the retorts,\r\nstopping up the mouth _p_ of the retorts with bladder.  By this means I\r\ngot several ounces of the perspiring matter of vines, figtrees\"--and\r\nother trees, which \"matter\" Hales found to be almost pure water.  The\r\ntest tube experiment should now be made with a narrow-leaved grass like\r\nsheep's fescue and with a wide-leaved grass like cocksfoot.  You will\r\nfind that wide-leaved plants pass out more water than those with narrow\r\nleaves, and hence wide-leaved plants occur in damp situations or on\r\ndamp soils like loams and clays, while narrow-leaved plants can grow on\r\ndry, sandy soils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.  Plants give out water through their leaves]\r\n\r\nAnother thing you will notice is that fields lying at the side of a\r\nriver and liable to be flooded, and fields {75} high up in wet hill\r\ndistricts, are covered with grass.  In a clay country there is also a\r\ngreat deal of grass land and not much ploughed land; if you live where\r\nthere is much clay you can easily discover the reason.  Clay becomes\r\nvery wet and sticky when rain falls, and very hard in dry weather: it\r\nis, therefore, difficult to cultivate.  Farmers cannot afford to spend\r\ntoo much money on cultivation, and so they prefer grass, because once\r\nit is established it goes on indefinitely and does not want ploughing\r\nup and re-sowing.  And besides, farmers have learned by experience that\r\ngrass can tolerate more water and less warmth than most other English\r\ncrops.  There is much more grass land in those parts of England where\r\nthe rainfall is high and the temperature rather {76} low--e.g. the\r\nnorthern parts of England--than in the eastern counties where the\r\nrainfall is low.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.  Stephen Hales's Experiment (from _Vegetable\r\nStaticks_, Vol. I. 1727)]\r\n\r\nThe difference in water supply, therefore, leads us to expect the\r\nfollowing differences between sandy soils and clays or loams:--\r\n\r\nOn sandy soils (the water content being small) the wild plants and\r\ntrees usually have small leaves.  Cultivated plants do not give very\r\nheavy crops, but they ripen early.\r\n\r\nOn clay soils (the water content being good) wild plants and trees\r\nusually have larger leaves.  Cultivated plants give good crops, but\r\nthey ripen rather late.  If the water content is too good or the clay\r\nis too sticky the land is generally put into grass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.  Hill slope near Harpenden.  Woodland at the\r\ntop, arable land lower down.  In the valley there is grass land but\r\nthis is hidden by the cottages]\r\n\r\nPlants require to be sufficiently warm.  Some like tropical heat and\r\ncan only be grown in hot houses; others can withstand a certain amount\r\nof cold and will grow up on the mountains.  Our common cultivated crops\r\ncome in between and will not grow in too cold or exposed a situation;\r\nthus you find very little cultivated land 800 ft.  above sea level, and\r\nnot usually much above 500 ft.  At this height it is left as grass\r\nland, and higher up as woodland, moor, or waste land.  Grass requires\r\nless warmth and can therefore grow at greater heights than many other\r\ncrops.  If you start at the top of a hill in Derbyshire, and walk down,\r\nyou will see that the top is moorland, lower down comes grass land,\r\nstill lower you may find arable land, and if the valley is damp you\r\nwill find more grass at the bottom.  Figs. 37 and 38 show typical views\r\nof the hill slopes further south: they are taken near Harpenden.  The\r\ntop of the hill in each case is over 400 ft. above sea level, and has\r\nnever been thought worth cultivating, but has always been left as {78}\r\nwood because it is too exposed for farm crops.  On the lower slopes the\r\narable fields are seen, while at the bottom bordering the river is\r\nrough grass land, shown in Fig. 39.  The top is too cold and windy, and\r\nthe bottom too wet, to be worth cultivating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.  View further along the valley, woodland and\r\narable above rough grass land near the river]\r\n\r\nAs the plant root is alive it wants air.  The effect of keeping air out\r\ncan be seen by sowing some barley or onion seeds in the ground and then\r\npouring a lot of water on and plastering the soil down with a spade.\r\nSow another row in nicely crumbled soil, not too wet, press the seeds\r\nwell in, but do not plaster the soil.  This second lot will generally\r\ndo much better than the first.  If the ground round a plant is\r\nfrequently trodden so that it becomes very hard the plant makes much\r\nless growth than if the soil were kept nice and loose.  A good gardener\r\ntakes very great pains in preparing his ground before he sows his\r\nseeds, and he is careful that no one should walk on his beds lest his\r\nplants should suffer.\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.  We may now collect together the various things we have learnt\r\nin this chapter.  Plants require water, air, warmth, food, and light,\r\nand they will not grow if harmful substances are present.  The\r\nrain-water that falls remains for some time in the soil, and does not\r\nat once run away or dry off: water can also move from wet to dry places\r\nin the soil.  Therefore the plant does not need rain every day, but can\r\ndraw on the stock in the soil during dry weather.  A sandy soil is\r\nusually drier than a loam or a clay, especially if it lies rather high:\r\nplants growing on a sandy soil make less growth and have narrower and\r\nsmaller leaves than those on a moister soil.\r\n\r\nSituations more than five or six hundred feet above sea level are, in\r\nEngland, as a rule, too bleak and {80} exposed for the ordinary\r\ncultivated crops.  Such land is, therefore, either grass land,\r\nmoorland, downland or woodland.\r\n\r\nThe roots of plants are living and require air.  The soil must not be\r\ntrodden too hard round them or air cannot get in, nor can it if too\r\nmuch water is present.\r\n\r\nGrass can put up with more water and less warmth than most cultivated\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.  Rough grass pasture near the river, above that\r\nis arable land and still higher is woodland]\r\n\r\nInstances of these facts may be found in going down any hill 500 ft. or\r\nmore in height: the top is usually wood or waste, being too cold for\r\ncrops, below this may come grass land, lower still arable land.  It is\r\nboth warmer and moister in the valley (since water runs down hill), and\r\nso we can account for the proverbial fertility of valleys.  But just\r\nnear the river, if there is one, the ground may be too wet for crops,\r\nand therefore grass is grown.  Clay land that is rather too wet to\r\nplough is usually left in grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{82}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION AND TILLAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nApparatus required.\r\n\r\n_Plot experiments, hoeing and mulching.  Thermometer.  Soil sampler\r\n(Fig. 42, p. 88).  This tool consists of a steel tube 2 in. in diameter\r\nand 9 in. long, with a slit cut along its length and all the edges\r\nsharpened.  The tube is fixed on to a vertical steel rod, bent at the\r\nend to a ring 2 in. in diameter, through which a stout wooden handle\r\npasses.  It is readily made by a blacksmith._\r\n\r\n\r\nFarmers and gardeners throughout the spring, summer and autumn, are\r\nbusy ploughing or digging, hoeing or in other ways cultivating the\r\nsoil.  Unless all this is well done the soil fails to produce much; the\r\nsluggard's garden has always been a by-word and a reproach.  In trying\r\nto understand why they do it we must remember that plant roots need\r\nwater, warmth and air; if the soil is too compact or if there is too\r\nmuch water the plant suffers, as we have seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.  After harvest the farmer breaks up his land\r\nwith a plough and then leaves it alone until seed time]\r\n\r\nOne great object of cultivation is, therefore, to prevent the soil\r\nbeing too compact and too wet.  After the harvest the farmer breaks up\r\nhis ground with a plough and then leaves it alone till seed time (Fig.\r\n40).  A gardener does the same thing with a fork in his kitchen\r\ngarden--he cannot very well elsewhere, or the plant roots might {83}\r\nbecome too cold.  If there is frost during the winter both farmer and\r\ngardener are pleased because they say the frost \"mellows\" the ground;\r\nyou can see what they mean if you walk on a frosty morning over a\r\nploughed field.  The large clods of earth are no longer sticky, they\r\nalready show signs of breaking up, and if they are not frozen too hard\r\ncan easily be shattered by a kick.  The change has been brought about\r\nin exactly the same way as the bursting of water-pipes by frost.  When\r\nwater freezes it expands with enormous force and bursts open anything\r\nthat confines it; water freezing in the pores of the soil forces the\r\nlittle fragments apart.  This action is so important that further\r\nillustrations should be looked for.  A piece of wet chalk left out on a\r\nfrosty night often crumbles to pieces.  It is dangerous {84} to climb\r\ncliffs in the early spring because pieces of rock that have been split\r\noff during the winter frosts by the expanding water may easily give\r\nway.  Frost plays havoc with walls built of flints and with old bricks\r\nthat are beginning to wear.  If there are several frosts, with falls of\r\nrain or snow and thaws coining in between, the soil is moved about a\r\ngood deal by the freezing and melting water.  Bulbs and cuttings are\r\nsometimes forced out of the ground, whilst grass and young wheat may be\r\nso loosened that they have to be rolled in again as soon as the weather\r\npermits.  When the ground has been dug in autumn and left in a very\r\nrough state all this loosening work of the frost is very much helped,\r\nbecause so much of the soil may become frozen.  If in spring you dig a\r\npiece of land that has already been dug in autumn, and then try digging\r\na piece that has not, you will find the first much easier work than the\r\nsecond in all but very sandy soils.\r\n\r\nA little before the seeds are sown, the soil has to be dug or\r\ncultivated again so that it may become more level and broken into\r\nsmaller pieces.  The farmer then harrows and the gardener rakes it, and\r\nit becomes still finer.  Very great care is bestowed on the preparation\r\nof the seed bed, and it will take you longer to learn this than any\r\nother part of outdoor gardening.  The soil has to be made fine and dry,\r\nand no pains must be spared in getting it so.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the soil is fine enough the seed is put in.  But it is not\r\nenough simply to let the seed tumble into the ground.  It has to be\r\npressed in gently with a spade or a roller, not too hard or the soil\r\nbecomes too sticky.  Fig. 41 shows this operation being carried out on\r\nthe farm.  Then the soil should be left alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.  Rolling in mangold seeds on the farm]\r\n\r\n{86} If you watch an allotment holder who grows onions really well\r\nworking away at his seed-bed you will see what a beautifully fine tilth\r\nhe gets.  If you try to do the same you will probably fail; his seeds\r\nwill be up before yours and will grow into healthier plants.  Only\r\nafter long practice will you succeed, and then you will have mastered\r\none of the great mysteries of gardening.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the plants are up they have to be hoed, and the more often\r\nthis is done the better.  Hoeing has several useful effects on the\r\nsoil; during summer time some experiments may be made to find out what\r\nthese are.  A piece of ground is wanted that has got no crop on it.\r\nSet out three strips each six feet wide and six feet long, leave one\r\nentirely alone, hoe the second once a week, and the third three times a\r\nweek; put labels on so that no mistake can arise.  The surface of the\r\nuntouched plot becomes very compact and glazed in appearance; the other\r\nsoils look nice and crumbly.  Take the temperature of the soils by\r\nplacing a thermometer into it at various depths--half inch, three\r\ninches, and six inches--also take the temperature of the air; enter up\r\nthe results as in the table, which shows what happened at Harpenden.\r\n\r\n                  Air\r\n  Date        temperature               Soil temperature\r\n\r\n                                              Hoed      Hoed\r\n                                 Untouched    once    three times\r\n                                             weekly     weekly\r\n\r\n  1910\r\n  June 20th       30    1/2 inch    35        31.5       31.5\r\n                        3 inches    30.5      29.8       28.8\r\n                        6 inches    27        26.5       24\r\n\r\n  June 27th       18    1/2 inch    17.5      17         17\r\n                        3 inches    16.7      16.3       16.2\r\n                        6 inches    15.8      15.5       15.6\r\n\r\n{87}\r\n\r\nThe thermometer readings are in degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nRemarks.  June 20th: Hot sunny day, there had been no rain since June\r\n11th.\r\n\r\nJune 27th: Cold, cloudy day, several cold, wet days during the past\r\nweek.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the cold day there was very little difference between the plots, but\r\non the hot day the hoed plots were cooler than the others.  Now only\r\nthe top inch is touched by the hoe, and so it appears that the layer\r\nthus loosened shields the rest of the soil from the sun's heat.  If\r\nthis is the case we ought to find that any other loose material would\r\nact in just the same way.  We must, therefore, set out a fourth plot\r\nalongside the others, cover it with straw or cut grass (a cover like\r\nthis is called a mulch), and take the temperature there.  Some of the\r\nresults were as follows:--\r\n\r\n                     Air\r\n  Date           temperature                 Soil temperature\r\n\r\n                                           Hoed plot   Mulched plot\r\n\r\n  1910\r\n  Sept. 24th        15        1/2 inch        17.5        12.25\r\n                              3 inches        12.5        11.75\r\n                              6 inches        12.25       11.5\r\n\r\n  Oct.  5th         17        1/2 inch        17          15.5\r\n                              3 inches        16.7        15\r\n                              6 inches        15.5        14.5\r\n\r\nRemarks.  Sept. 24th: Warm day after a rather cold spell.  Oct. 5th:\r\nAfter a long spell of dry, warm weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe untouched plot had become smothered in weeds and could no longer be\r\nused for this experiment.  The mulched soil is, however, cooler even\r\nthan the hoed soil, and our expectation that mulching would keep the\r\nsoil cool has turned out to be correct.\r\n\r\n{88}\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.  Soil sampler.  (See p. 82 for description)]\r\n\r\nIt may be expected that the hotter soil--the unhoed plot--will also be\r\ndrier than the others, and this can be found out by a simple\r\nexperiment.  Take a sample by making a hole six indies deep with\r\nstraight and not with sloping sides: this is best done by driving a\r\ntube two inches wide into the soil (Fig. 42): if you have not got such\r\na tool you may use a trowel, but you will have to be very quick and\r\nvery careful.  Weigh the soil--or a part of it if you have got a great\r\ndeal--then set it to dry in a warm place for three or four days.  Weigh\r\nagain when it is dry: the difference gives the loss of water: find what\r\nit would be in a hundred parts.  Our results were:--\r\n\r\n{89}\r\n\r\n     Date                  Percentage of water in the\r\n\r\n                  Untouched soil   Soil hoed once   Soil hoed three\r\n                                       weekly        times weekly\r\n\r\n  1910\r\n  June 4th             21.1             19.5             17.9\r\n\r\n  June 20th            14.7             16.0             16.0\r\n\r\n  June 27th            19.3             18.4             20.5\r\n\r\nRemarks.  June 4th; The weather is still cold and the summer has not\r\nyet begun.\r\n\r\nJune 20th: Hot day following on some hot, dry weather.\r\n\r\nJune 27th: Rain had recently fallen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen hoeing is done in the early part of the summer it dries the soil,\r\nand the more frequent the hoeing the drier the soil (see June 4th\r\nresults).  But later on, when the hot weather begins, the hoed soil\r\nloses much less moisture than the untouched plot; the latter lost 6.4\r\nper cent. in 16 days in the top six inches, whilst the soil hoed once\r\nweekly lost 3.1 per cent., and the one hoed three times weekly lost\r\nonly 1.4; the two hoed soils are now equal, and are both moister than\r\nthe untouched soil.  When more rain comes they get just as wet as the\r\nothers: hoeing does not prevent water from sinking in, but it does\r\nprevent water from getting lost.\r\n\r\nOur experiment has, therefore, shown us that hoeing makes a loose layer\r\nof soil which shields the rest of the soil from the sun's heat, and\r\nprevents it getting too hot or too dry.  A hoed soil is cooler and\r\nmoister, and therefore better suited for the growth of plant roots than\r\nan unhoed soil.\r\n\r\n{90}\r\n\r\nThe mulch of straw or dried grass was found to have the same effect in\r\nconserving the water as the loose layer of soil obtained by hoeing.\r\nSome results were:--\r\n\r\n                 Percentage of moisture in\r\n\r\n  Date           Hoed soil    Mulched soil\r\n\r\n  1910\r\n  Sept. 24th       19.6           20.7\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.  Cultivation and mulching reduce the loss of\r\nwater from soils]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese results are so important that some indoor experiments should be\r\nmade to furnish more proof.  Fix up three inverted bell jars with corks\r\nand bent tubes as shown in Fig. 43, fill all with dry soil well pressed\r\ndown, then add water carefully till it appears in the glass tubes.\r\nNext day mark with stamp paper the level of liquid in each tube and\r\nthen leave one jar {91} untouched, carefully cultivate with a penknife\r\nevery two or three days the top quarter of an inch of the second, and\r\ncover the third with a layer of grass.  After a week notice again the\r\nlevels of the liquid and mark with paper; you find that the water has\r\nfallen most in the untouched jar, showing that more has been lost from\r\nthis than from the jars covered with a mulch either of soil or of dry\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nA slate or flat stone acts like a mulch; if you leave one on the soil\r\nfor a few days in hot weather and then lift it up on a hot day you will\r\nsee that the soil underneath is quite moist; you may also find several\r\nslugs or other animals that have gone there for the sake of the\r\ncoolness and the moisture.  Plants and trees also keep off the sun's\r\nheat and so make the soil cold and moist.  Grass land is in summer and\r\nautumn, and even in early winter, cooler near the surface than bare\r\nland.  At Harpenden we found:--\r\n\r\n                                  Soil temperature\r\n  Date                        Grass land      Bare land\r\n\r\n  1910\r\n  Sept. 24th       1/2 inch      13             17.5\r\n                   3 inches      12.5           12.5\r\n                   6 inches      12.5           12.25\r\n\r\n  Oct. 5th         1/2 inch      17.5           17\r\n                   3 inches      15             16.7\r\n                   6 inches      14.5           15.5\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if the ground is not covered a certain amount of protection is\r\nstill possible.  Trees are often planted round ponds to prevent\r\nevaporation of the water.  The wind helps to dry the soil very much,\r\nand a hedge {92} that shields from the wind not only protects the crop\r\nbut also keeps the soil moist: a road with high hedges at each side\r\nremains wet for a long time after more exposed parts have dried.  The\r\neffect on the temperature can be well seen on a day when a N.E. wind is\r\nblowing.  Fix up on a piece of the experimental ground a little hedge\r\nmade of small pea-stakes or brushwood, and take the soil temperature at\r\none inch depth, both on the windward and on the leeward side.  Two\r\nresults were:--\r\n\r\n  Temperature at 1 inch depth--sheltered side   15.5\r\n      \"       \"     \"     \"    windward side    14\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that on the hot day, June 20th, the top half-inch\r\nof soil was hotter than the air: the mercury in the thermometer rose\r\ndirectly it was put into the soil.  There is nothing very unusual about\r\nthis; if you touch a piece of iron lying on the soil you find it hotter\r\nthan the air.  Lower down the soil had the same temperature as the air,\r\nand still lower it was cooler[1].  The sun's heat travels so slowly\r\ninto the soil in summer that months pass before it gets far down, but\r\nthen, as it takes so long to get in, it also takes a long time to get\r\nout, and it takes still longer to get either in or out if there is a\r\nmulch or if grass is growing.\r\n\r\nDuring the early winter you may notice that the first fall of snow soon\r\nmelts on the arable land but remains longer on the grass; towards the\r\nend of the winter, however, the reverse happens and the snow melts\r\nfirst on the grass.  There is no difficulty in explaining this.  The\r\narable land is, as we have seen, warmer in autumn and early winter than\r\ngrass land, {93} and so it melts the snow more rapidly.  But during\r\nwinter the grass land loses its heat more slowly, and therefore it is\r\nwarmer at the end of the winter than the arable land, hence the snow\r\nmelts more quickly.\r\n\r\nIn Chap. V. it was pointed out that dark coloured soils rich in humus\r\nare greatly favoured by gardeners and farmers.  The value of humus can\r\neasily be shown: take a sample of soil from a garden that has for a\r\nlong time been well manured and another from a field close by--next to\r\nit if you can--and find the amounts of moisture present.  Two soils at\r\nRothamsted gave the following results:--\r\n\r\n             Date    April 6th    May 6th    July 6th    Oct. 28th\r\n\r\n  Moisture in dark soil\r\n    rich in humus       20.0        18.0       20.7        23.3\r\n\r\n  Moisture in lighter\r\n    soil poor in humus  13.1        11.9       12.0        17.5\r\n\r\nHumus, therefore, keeps the water in the soil and saves it from being\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nAnother beneficial effect of hoeing is to keep down weeds.  Weeds\r\novercrowd the plant, shut out light, take food and water, and occupy\r\nspace.  Few plants can compete against weeds, some fail very badly in\r\nthe struggle.  Sow two rows of maize two yards apart; keep one well\r\nhoed for a yard on each side and leave the other alone to struggle with\r\nthe weeds that will grow.  Fig. 44 shows the result of this experiment\r\nat St George's School.  At Rothamsted a piece of wheat was left\r\nunharvested in 1882, and the plot has not been touched since; the wheat\r\nwas allowed to shed its seed {94} and to grow up without any attention.\r\nWeeds flourished, but the wheat did not; the next year there was but\r\nlittle wheat, and by 1886 only a few plants could be seen, so stunted\r\nthat one would hardly recognise them.  The ground still remains\r\nuntouched, and is now the dense thicket seen in Fig. 45.  Most of our\r\nland would become like this if it were neglected for a few years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44 _a_.  The hoed plot, no weeds.  Maize cannot\r\ncompete successfully against weeds]\r\n\r\n{95}\r\n\r\nFarmers occasionally leave their ground without a crop for a whole year\r\nand cultivate it as often as they can to kill the weeds.  This practice\r\nis called \"fallowing,\" and is very ancient; it is much less common now\r\nthat crops like mangolds and swedes are grown, which can, if necessary,\r\nbe hoed all the summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44 _b_.  Untouched plot, many weeds]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already seen (p. 69) that ordinary cultivated plants will not\r\nlive in a water-logged soil.  {96} Wherever there is an excess of water\r\nit must be removed before satisfactory results can be obtained.  Fig.\r\n46 shows a field of wheat in May where the crop is all but killed and\r\nonly certain weeds survive on a patch of undrained land that lay wet\r\nall the winter.  Draining land is difficult and somewhat expensive;\r\ntrenches are first cut to a proper depth, and drain pipes are laid on\r\nthe bottom, taking care that there is a gentle slope all the way to the\r\nditch.  The rain soaks into the soil and gets into the pipes, for they\r\nare not joined together like gas or water pipes, but left with little\r\nspaces in between; it then runs out into the ditch.  Usually only clay\r\nsoils need drainage, but occasionally sandy soils do also (see pp. 30,\r\n106).  A great deal of drainage was carried out in England between 1840\r\nand 1860, and it led to a marked improvement in agriculture and in\r\ncountry life generally.  There is, however, a great deal that wants\r\ndoing now.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.  A plot of wheat left untouched since 1882 at\r\nRothamsted has now become a dense thicket]\r\n\r\nThe addition of chalk or lime to soil was found in Chap. III. to\r\nimprove it very much by making it less sticky and less impervious to\r\nair and water.  Chalk or lime does more than this.  It puts out of\r\naction certain injurious substances or acids that may be formed, and\r\nthus makes the conditions more favourable for plants and for the useful\r\nmicro-organisms; farmers and gardeners express this by saying that it\r\n\"sweetens the soil.\"  A United States proverb runs: \"A lime country is\r\na rich country.\"  Very many soils in England are improved by adding\r\nlime or chalk.  There are considerable areas in the south-eastern and\r\neastern counties where the soil is very chalky; here you find a\r\nwonderfully rich assortment of flowers and shrubs.  Where there is too\r\nmuch chalk the soil is not fertile, because it lets water {98} through\r\ntoo easily, as was shown on p. 26: but for this very reason it is\r\nadmirable for residential purposes.\r\n\r\nThere are some exceptions to the rule that plants need lime.  Some\r\nplants will not tolerate it at all; such are rhododendrons, azaleas,\r\nfoxgloves, spurrey, and broom; wherever you see these growing you may\r\nbe sure that lime is absent.\r\n\r\nLime really differs from chalk, but changes into it so quickly in the\r\nsoil that the action of both is almost, though not quite, the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.  A wheat field in May.  The large patch in the\r\ncentre where the crop is doing badly lay under water for much of the\r\nwinter because of the bad drainage]\r\n\r\nSUMMARY.  The various things we have learnt in this Chapter are:--\r\n\r\nAutumn and winter cultivation are needed to loosen the soil so that\r\nrain can soak in and not lie about in pools, and also to facilitate\r\nworking in spring.\r\n\r\nThe soil has to be broken down very finely and made rather dry for a\r\nseed bed.  The seed has to be rolled in and then left entirely alone.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the little plants are up the soil must be hoed, and the more\r\noften this is done the better.  Hoeing keeps the soil cool and moist in\r\nhot weather, the loose layer acting like a mulch of straw.  Anything\r\nelse that shields the soil from the sun or the wind has the same action\r\nbut is not so effective as the mulch.  Further, hoeing keeps down\r\nweeds, which successfully compete against almost any cultivated plants.\r\nHumus also prevents the loss of moisture from soils.\r\n\r\nDrainage may be necessary to remove excess of water.\r\n\r\nLiming or chalking the soil is beneficial, not only because of the\r\nimprovements mentioned in Chap. III., but also because certain\r\ninjurious substances are thereby removed.  There are, however, some\r\nplants that will not tolerate lime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At great depths below the surface the temperature rises again from\r\nquite another cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{100}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE SOIL AND THE COUNTRYSIDE\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we want to put together much of what we have learned\r\nabout the different kinds of soil, so that as we go about the country\r\nwe may know what to look for on a clay soil, a sandy soil, and so on.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that clay holds water and is very wet and sticky in\r\nwinter, while in summer it becomes hard and dry, and is liable to crack\r\nbadly.  \"It greets a' winter and girns a' summer,\" as one of Dr John\r\nBrown's characters said of his soil.  Clay soils are therefore hard to\r\ndig and expensive to cultivate: the farmer calls them heavy and usually\r\nprefers to put them into grass because once the grass is up it lasts as\r\nlong as it is wanted and never needs to be resown.  But in the days\r\nwhen we grew our own wheat, before we imported it from the United\r\nStates and other countries, this clay land was widely cultivated for\r\nwheat and beans.  So long as wheat was 60/- to 100/- a quarter it was a\r\nvery profitable crop, but, when some forty years ago it fell to 40/-\r\nand then lower still, the land either went out of cultivation like the\r\n\"derelict\" farms of Essex, or it was changed to grass land and used for\r\ncattle grazing.  Great was the distress that followed; some districts\r\nindeed were years in recovering.  But new methods came in: the land\r\nnear London was used for dairy {101} farming, and elsewhere it was\r\nimproved for grazing, and the clay districts, although completely\r\nchanged, are now more prosperous again.  Many of the fields still show\r\nthe ridges or \"lands\" in which, when they grew wheat, they were laid up\r\nto let the water run away, and many of them keep their old names, but\r\nthese are the only relics of the old days.  The land is not, and never\r\nwas, very valuable.  The roads are wide, and on either side have wide\r\nwaste strips cut up roughly by horse tracks, cart ruts and ant hills.\r\nBracken, gorse, rushes, thistles and brambles grow there, and you may\r\nfind many fine blackberries in September.  The coarse Aira grass is\r\nfound with its leaves as rough as files.  The villages are often built\r\nround greens which serve as the village playground, where the boys and\r\nyoung men now play cricket and football, and their forefathers\r\npractised archery, played quoits and other games.  On a few village\r\ngreens the Maypole can still be seen, whilst the stocks in which\r\noffenders were placed are also left in some places.\r\n\r\nThe hedges are often high and straggling, and there are numerous woods\r\nand plantations containing much oak.  Some of the woods are very\r\nancient and probably form part of the primeval forests that once\r\nlargely covered England.  Epping Forest in Essex, the Forest of Blean\r\nand the King's Wood in Kent, have probably never been cultivated land.\r\nIn the days when ships were made of oak these woods and hedges were\r\nvery valuable, but now they are of little use as sources of timber.\r\nInstead they are valued for quite another reason: they afford shelter\r\nfor foxes and for game birds.  The clay districts are and always have\r\nbeen famous for fox hunting; the Pytchley, Quorn, Belvoir, {102} and\r\nother celebrated packs have their homes in the broad, clay, grassy\r\nvales of the Midlands.  The vale of Blackmoor and other clay regions\r\nare equally famous.  The plantations and hedgerows are fine places for\r\nprimroses and foxgloves, while in the pastures, and especially the poor\r\npastures, are found the ox-eyed daisy and quaking grass, that make such\r\nfine nosegays, as well as that sure sign of poverty, the yellow rattle.\r\nBut many of these poor pastures have been improved by draining, liming,\r\nand the use of suitable manures.  Although the roads are better than\r\nthey were (see p. 30) they are still often bad and lie wet for weeks\r\ntogether in winter, especially where the hedges are high.  Numerous\r\nbrick and tile yards may be found and iron ore is not uncommon; in some\r\nplaces it is worked now, in others it is no longer worked and nothing\r\nremains of the lost industry save only a few names of fields, of ponds,\r\nor of cottages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.  Highly cultivated sand in Kent.  Gooseberries\r\nare growing in the foreground, vegetables behind, and hops in\r\nbackground]\r\n\r\nA sandy soil is in so many ways the opposite of a clay soil that we\r\nshall expect to find corresponding differences in the look of the\r\ncountry.  A sandy soil does not hold water: it may get water up from\r\nthe subsoil to supply the plant (see p. 66), or, if it happens to lie\r\nin a basin of clay, it may even be very wet: otherwise it is likely to\r\nbe too dry for ordinary plants.  We may therefore look out for two\r\nsorts of sand country, the one cultivated because there is enough water\r\nfor the crops, and the other not cultivated because the water is\r\nlacking.  These can readily be found.\r\n\r\nWe will study the cultivated sands first.  As sand is not good plant\r\nfood (p. 43) these soils want a lot of manure, and so are not good for\r\nordinary farmers.  But they are very easy to cultivate--for which\r\nreason they {104} are called light soils--and can be dug at any time;\r\nseeds can be sown early, and early crops can be got.  Consequently\r\nthese soils are very useful for men doing special work like fattening\r\nwinter and spring sheep, or producing special crops like fruit or\r\npotatoes, and for market gardeners who grow all sorts of vegetables,\r\ncarrots, parsnips, potatoes, peas, and so on.  Fig. 47 is a view of a\r\nhighly cultivated sandy region in Kent showing gooseberries in the\r\nforeground, vegetables behind, and a hop garden behind that again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.  A Surrey heath]\r\n\r\nThe uncultivated sands are sometimes not really so very different, and\r\nsome of them, perhaps many of them, might be improved or reclaimed and\r\nmade to grow these special crops if it were worth while.  But they\r\nalways require special treatment and therefore they have been left\r\nalone.  In days of old our ancestors disliked them very much;\r\n\"villanous, rascally heaths\" Cobbett always called them.  There were\r\npractically no villages and few cottages, because the land was too\r\nbarren to produce enough food; the few dwellers on the heath, or the\r\n\"heathen,\" were so ignorant and benighted that the name came to stand\r\ngenerally for all such people and has remained in our language long\r\nafter its original meaning was lost.  As there were so few inhabitants\r\nthe heaths used to be great places for robbers, highwaymen, and\r\nevil-doers generally; Gad's Hill on the Watling St. between Rochester\r\nand Gravesend, Finchley Common, Hounslow Heath and others equally\r\ndreaded by travellers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, were\r\nbarren sandy tracts.  But in our time we no longer need to dread them;\r\nwe can enjoy the infinite charm of the breezy, open country with its\r\nbrown vegetation, the pink blossom of the bell-shaped heath and the\r\nlilac blossom of the {106} heather, the splashes of yellow from the\r\nragwort or the gorse and the dark pine and larch plantations.  In the\r\nspring the young shoots of bracken lend a beautiful light green colour\r\nto the scene, while in the autumn the faded growth covers it all with a\r\nrich brown.  People now like to live amid such surroundings, and so\r\nthese heaths, that have been untouched for so long and are part of the\r\noriginal primeval England as it was in the days of the Britons, are\r\nbecoming dotted with red bricked and red tiled villas, and are fast\r\nlosing their ancient character.  The heaths are not everywhere dry;\r\nthere are numerous clay basins where the sand lies wet, where peat\r\nforms (see p. 37), and where marsh plants like the bog asphodel,\r\nsundew, or cotton grass can be found.  In walking over a heath you soon\r\nlearn to find these wet places by the colour of the grass and the\r\nabsence of heather.  In some places there is a good deal of wood,\r\nespecially pines, larches, and silver birches: all these are very\r\ncommon on the Surrey sands, willows also grow in the damp places.  Fig.\r\n48 shows a Surrey heath--Blackheath--with heather, gorse and bracken;\r\nwith pine-woods in the distance and everywhere some bare patches of\r\nsand.  Much of the New Forest is on the sand, as also is Bournemouth,\r\nfamous for its fine pine woods.  Fig. 49 is a view of such woods on\r\nWimbledon common.  But elsewhere there is no wood: the peasants burn\r\nthe turf, and so you find their cottages have huge fireplaces: instead\r\nof fences round their gardens or round the plantations there are walls\r\nmade of turf.  Such are the Dorchester heaths so finely described by\r\nHardy in _The Return of the Native_ and other novels.  Other sands,\r\nhowever, are covered with grass and not with heather, and many of these\r\nhave a special value {108} for golf links, especially some of the dry,\r\ninvigorating sands by the seaside.  The famous links at St Andrews, and\r\nat Littlestone, are examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.  Woodland and heather on light sandy soil,\r\nWimbledon Common]\r\n\r\nIn between the fertile and the barren sands come a number that are\r\ncultivated without being very good.  They are much like the others,\r\ncarrying a vegetation that is usually of the narrow leaved type (p.\r\n72), and not very dense.  On the road sides you see broom, heather,\r\nheath, harebells, along with gorse and bracken with milkwort nestling\r\nunderneath: crested dog's tail and sheep's fescue are common grasses,\r\nwhile spurrey, knotwood, corn marigold, are a few of the numerous weeds\r\nin the arable fields.  Gardens are easily dug, but it is best to put\r\ninto them only those plants that, like the native vegetation, can\r\nwithstand drought: vegetable gardens must be well manured and well\r\nlimed.  Fig. 50 shows some of this kind of country in Surrey, the\r\nbarley field is surrounded by wood and very poor grass on the higher\r\nslopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.  Poor sandy soil in Surrey, partly cultivated\r\nbut mainly wood and waste]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to travel in a sand country because the roads dry very\r\nquickly after rain, although they may be dusty in summer.  Sometimes\r\nthe lanes are sunk rather deeply in the soft sand, forming very pretty\r\nbanks on either side.\r\n\r\nLoams, as we have seen (p. 2), lie in between sands and clays: they are\r\nneither very wet nor very dry: not too heavy nor yet too light: they\r\nare very well suited to our ordinary farm crops, and they form by far\r\nthe best soils for general farming; wheat, oats, barley, sheep, cattle,\r\nmilk, fruit and vegetables can all be produced: indeed the farmer on a\r\ngood loam is in the fortunate position of being able to produce almost\r\nanything he finds most profitable.  In a loam district that does not\r\n{110} lie too high the land is generally all taken up, even the roads\r\nare narrow and there are few commons.  The hedges are straight and cut\r\nshort, the farm houses and buildings are well kept, and there is a\r\ngeneral air of prosperity all round.  Good elms grow and almost any\r\ntree that is planted will succeed.  Loams shade off on one side into\r\nsand; the very fertile sands already described might quite truly be\r\ncalled sandy loams.  On the other side they shade off into clays; the\r\nheavy loams used to be splendid wheat soils, but are now, like clays,\r\noften of little value.  But they form pleasant, undulating country,\r\nnicely wooded, and dotted over with thatched cottages; the fields are\r\nless wet and the roads are rather better than on the clays.  When\r\nproperly managed they make excellent grass land.\r\n\r\nChalky soils stand out quite sharply from all others: their white\r\ncolour, their lime kilns now often disused, their noble beech trees,\r\nand, above all, the great variety of flowering plants enable the\r\ntraveller at once to know that he is on the chalk.  Many plants like\r\nchalk and these may be found in abundance, but some, such as foxgloves,\r\nheather, broom or rhododendrons cannot tolerate it at all, and so they\r\nwill not grow.\r\n\r\nChalk, like sand, is dry, and the roads can be traversed very soon\r\nafter rain.  They are not very good, however; often they are only\r\nmended with flints, which occur in the chalk and are therefore easily\r\nobtainable, and the sharp fragments play sad havoc with bicycle tyres.\r\nThe bye roads and lanes are often narrow, winding, and worn deep\r\nespecially at the foot of the hills, so that the banks get a fair\r\namount of moisture and carry a dense vegetation.  Among the profusion\r\nof flowers you can find scabious, the bedstraws, vetches, ragwort,\r\n{111} figwort, and many a plant rare in other places, like the wild\r\norchids; while the cornfields are often yellow with charlock.  In the\r\nhedgerows are hazels, guelder roses, maples, dogwood, all intwined with\r\nlong trails of bryony and traveller's joy.  In the autumn the\r\ntraveller's joy produces the long, hairy tufts that have earned for it\r\nthe name of old man's beard, while the guelder roses bear clusters of\r\nred berries.  The great variety of flowers attracts a corresponding\r\nvariety of butterflies, moths and other insects; there are also numbers\r\nof birds and rabbits--indeed a chalk country teems with life in spite\r\nof the bare look of the Downs.  The roads running at the foot of the\r\nchalk Downs and connecting the villages, and farmhouses built there for\r\nthe good water supply, are particularly rich in plants because they\r\nsometimes cut into the chalk and sometimes into the neighbouring clay,\r\nsand or rock.  Now and then a spring bursts out and a little stream\r\ntakes its rise: if you follow it you will generally find watercress\r\ncultivated somewhere.\r\n\r\nBesides the beech trees you also find ash, sycamore, maples, and, in\r\nthe church yards, some venerable yews.  Usually the chalk districts\r\nwere inhabited very early: they are dry and healthy, the land can be\r\ncultivated and the heights command extensive views over the country, so\r\nthat approaching enemies could easily be seen.  On the chalk downs and\r\nplains are found many remains of tribes that lived there in the remote\r\nages of the past, whose very names are now lost.  Strange weapons and\r\nornaments are sometimes dug up in the camps where they lived and\r\nworked; the barrows can be seen in which they were buried, and the\r\ntemples in which they worshipped; Stonehenge itself, the best known of\r\nall these, lies on the chalk.  {112} Several of the camps still keep\r\nthe name the ancient Britons gave them--the _Mai-dun_, the encampment\r\non the hill, changed in the course of years to Maiden, as in Maiden\r\nHill, near Dorchester, in Dorset, Maiden Bower, near Dunstable, and so\r\non.  Some of their roads are still in use to this day, the Icknield Way\r\n(the way of the Iceni, a Belgic tribe), the Pilgrim's Way of the\r\nsouthern counties and others.\r\n\r\nEven the present villages go back to very ancient times, and the\r\nchurches are often seven or eight hundred years old.\r\n\r\nIn places the land is too steep or too elevated to be cultivated, and\r\nso it is left as pasture for the sheep or \"sheep walk\"; where\r\ncultivation is possible the fields are large and without hedges, like\r\nthose shown in Fig. 51; during autumn, winter and spring there are many\r\nsheep about, penned or \"folded\" on the arable land, eating the crops of\r\nswedes, turnips, rape, vetches or mustard grown for them, or grazing on\r\nthe aftermath of sainfoin or grass and clover.  So important are sheep\r\nin chalk districts that the whole scheme of farming is often based on\r\ntheir requirements, but corn is also a valuable crop, and, especially\r\nin dry districts, barley, so that chalk soils are often spoken of as\r\n\"sheep and barley\" soils.  Although the pastures are very healthy there\r\nis not generally much food or \"keep\" for the animals during the summer\r\nbecause of the dryness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.  Open chalk cultivated country, Isle of Thanet]\r\n\r\nThe black soil of the fen districts and elsewhere is widely different\r\nfrom any of the preceding.  It contains, as its colour shows, a large\r\nquantity of combustible material (Chap. V.), which has a great power of\r\nholding water.  These fens are therefore very wet; until they were\r\ndrained they were desolate wastes: you may {114} read in Kingsley's\r\n_Hereward the Wake_ what they used to be like in old days, and even as\r\nlate as 1662 Dugdale writes that here \"no element is good.  The air\r\ncloudy, gross and full of rotten harrs[1]; water putrid and muddy, yea,\r\nfull of loathsome vermin; the earth spongy and boggy; and the fire\r\nnoisome by the stink of smoking hassocks[2].\"  But during the Stuart\r\nperiod wide ditches or drains were dug, into which the water could flow\r\nand be pumped into rivers.  This reclamation has been continued to the\r\npresent time, and the black soils as well as the others in the Fen\r\ndistricts can be made very productive.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that a change in the soil produces a change in the plants\r\nthat grow on it.  The flora (i.e. the collection of plants) of a clay\r\nsoil is quite different from that of a sandy soil, and both are\r\ndifferent from that of a chalk or of a fen soil.  In like manner\r\ndraining a meadow or manuring it alters its flora: some of the plants\r\ndisappear and new ones come in.  Even an operation like mowing a lawn,\r\nif carried on sufficiently regularly, causes a change.  In all these\r\ncases the plants favoured by the new conditions are enabled to grow\r\nrather better than those that are less favoured; thus in the regularly\r\nmown lawn the short growing grasses have an advantage over those like\r\nbrome that grow taller, and so crowd them out.  When land is drained\r\nthose plants that like a great quantity of water no longer do quite so\r\nwell as before, while those that cannot put up with much water now have\r\na better chance.  In the natural state there is a great deal of\r\ncompetition among {115} plants, and only those survive that are adapted\r\nto their surroundings.  You should remember this on your rambles and\r\nwhen you see a plant growing wild you should think of it as one that\r\nhas succeeded in the competition and try to find out why it has been\r\nenabled to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Harr is an old word meaning sea-fog.\r\n\r\n[2] Hassock is the name given to coarse grass which forms part of the\r\nturf burnt in the cottages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{116}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHOW SOIL HAS BEEN MADE\r\n\r\n\r\nApparatus required.\r\n\r\n_The apparatus in Fig. 54.  The under surface, of the lips of the\r\nbeakers should be vaselined to prevent the water trickling down the\r\nsides._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to find cliffs or crags in inland places, but they\r\nusually show one very striking difference from seaside cliffs.  The\r\nseaside cliffs may be nearly vertical, but the inland cliffs are not,\r\nexcepting for a little way at the top; lower down a heap of stones and\r\nsoil lies piled against the face of the cliff and makes a slope up\r\nwhich you can climb.  If you look at the cliff you can find loose\r\nfragments of it split off either by the action of freezing water (p.\r\n83) or by other causes ready to roll down if sufficiently disturbed.\r\nSo long has this been going on that a pile has by now accumulated, and\r\nhas been covered with plants growing on the soil of the heap.  Our\r\ninterest centres in this soil; no one has carried it there; it must\r\nhave been made from the rock fragments.  When you get an opportunity of\r\nstudying such a heap, do so carefully; you can then see how, starting\r\nfrom a solid rock, soil has been formed.  This breaking down of the\r\nrock is called weathering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.  Cliffs at the seaside, Manorbier,\r\nPembrokeshire]\r\n\r\nThe same change has gone on at the top of the cliff.  Fragments have\r\nsplit off and the rock has broken {118} down into soil which stops\r\nwhere it is unless the rain can wash it away.  If there are no cliffs\r\nwhere you live you can see the same kind of action in the banks of the\r\nlanes, in a disused quarry, gravel pit or clay pit.  Wherever a\r\nvertical cutting has been made this downward rolling begins and a heap\r\nquickly forms, making the vertical cut into a slope.  Plants soon begin\r\nto grow, and before long it is clear that soil has been made out of the\r\nfragments that have rolled down.  This process is known as soil\r\nformation, but there is another always going on that we must now study.\r\nThe heap does not invariably lie at the foot of the cliff.  If there is\r\na stream, river, or sea at the foot the fragments may be carried away\r\nas fast as they roll down: the differences shown in Figs. 52 and 53\r\nbetween a cliff at the seaside and a cliff inland arise simply in this\r\nway.  In inland districts great valleys are in course of time carved\r\nout, and at the seaside large areas of land have been washed away.\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of the fragments thus carried away by the water?  The best\r\nway of answering the question would be to explore one of these mountain\r\nstreams and follow it to the sea, but we can learn a good deal by a few\r\nexperiments that can be made in the classroom.  We want to make a model\r\nstream and see what happens to little fragments of soil that fall into\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.  Inland cliff.  Salisbury Crags, Arthur's Seat,\r\nEdinburgh]\r\n\r\nFix up the apparatus shown in Fig. 54.  The small beaker A is to\r\nrepresent the narrow mountain stream, the larger one _B_ stands for the\r\nwide river, and the glass jar _C_ for the mouth of the river or the\r\nsea.  Run water through them; notice that it runs quickly through _A_,\r\nslowly through _B_, and still more slowly through _C_: we want it to do\r\nthis, because the stream flows quickly and the river slowly.\r\n\r\n{120}\r\n\r\nNow put some soil into _A_.  At once the soil is stirred up, the water\r\nbecomes muddy, and the muddy liquid flows into _B_.  But very soon a\r\nchange sets in, the liquid in _A_ becomes clear, and only the grit and\r\nstones are left in the bottom: all the mud--the clay and the silt--is\r\nwashed into _B_.  There it stops for a long time, and some of it will\r\nnever wash out.  The liquid flowing into _C_ is clearer than that\r\nflowing into _B_.  If you keep on putting fresh portions of soil into\r\n_A_ you can keep _B_ always muddy, although _A_ is usually clear.  At\r\nthe end of the experiment look at the sediment in each beaker: in _A_\r\nit is clear and gritty, in _B_ it is muddy.  If you can get hold of\r\nsome sea water put some of the liquid from _C_ into it: very soon this\r\nliquid clears and a deposit falls to the bottom, the sea water thus\r\nacting like the lime water on p. 20.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.  Model of a stream.  In _A_, where the stream\r\nflows quickly, the water is clear and the sediment free from mud.  In\r\n_B_, where it flows slowly, the water is turbid and the sediment muddy]\r\n\r\n{121}\r\n\r\nThe experiment shows us that the fine material washed away by a quickly\r\nflowing stream is partly deposited when the river becomes wider and the\r\ncurrent slower, and a good deal more is deposited by the action of the\r\nsalt water when the river flows into the sea.  The rock that crumbles\r\naway inland is spread out on the bed of the river or at its mouth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.  The two sides of the river at the bend]\r\n\r\nThe river Stour at Wye showed all these things so clearly that I will\r\ndescribe it; you must then compare it with a river that you know, and\r\nsee how far the same features occur.  At the bridge the stream was\r\nshallow and flowed quickly: the bottom was gritty and pebbly, free from\r\nmud, and formed a safe place for paddling.  Before the bridge was built\r\nthere had been {122} a ford here.  But further away, either up or down,\r\nthe stream was deeper and wider, flowed more slowly, had a muddy\r\nbottom, and so was not good for paddling.  At one place about a mile\r\naway some one had widened out the river to form a lake, but this made\r\nthe stream flow so slowly (as it was now so much wider) that the silt\r\nand clay deposited and the lake became silted up, i.e. it became so\r\nshallow that it was little more than a lake of mud.  The same facts\r\nwere brought out at the bend of the river.  On its convex side, Fig.\r\n55, the water has rather further to go in getting round the bend than\r\non its concave side _B_, it therefore flows more quickly, and carries\r\naway the soil of the bank and mud from the bottom.  But on its concave\r\naide where it flows more slowly it deposits material.  There is at the\r\nbend a marked difference in depth at the two sides.  On its convex side\r\nthe stream is rapid and deep, and scours away the bank; on its concave\r\nside it is slower, shallower, and tends to become silted up.  Thus the\r\nbend becomes more and more pronounced unless the bank round _A_ is\r\nprotected (the other bank of course needs no protection) and the whole\r\nriver winds about just as you see in Fig. 56, and is perpetually\r\nchanging its course, carrying away material from one place, mixing it\r\nup with material washed from somewhere else, and then deposits it at a\r\nbend or in a pool where it first becomes a mud flat and then dry land.\r\nSome, however, is carried out to sea.  We need not follow the Stour to\r\nthe sea; reference to an atlas will show what happens to other rivers.\r\nSome of the clay and silt they carry down is deposited at their mouths,\r\nand becomes a bar, gives rise to shoals and banks, or forms a delta.\r\nThe rest is carried away and deposited on the floor of the sea.  {124}\r\nMaterial washed away by the sea from the coast is either deposited on\r\nother parts of the coast, or is carried out and laid on the floor of\r\nthe sea.  Thus a thick deposit is accumulating, and if the sea were to\r\nbecome dry this deposit would be soil.  This has actually happened in\r\npast ages.  The land we live on, now dry land, has had a most wonderful\r\nhistory; it has more than once lain at the bottom of the sea and has\r\nbeen covered with a thick layer of sediment carried from other places.\r\nThen the sea became dry land and the sediment became pressed into rock,\r\nwhich formed new soil, but it at once began to get washed away by\r\nstreams and rivers into new seas, and gave rise to new sediments on the\r\nfloor of these seas.  And so the rock particles have for untold ages\r\nbeen going this perpetual round: they become soil; they are carried\r\naway by the rivers, in time they reach the sea; they lie at the bottom\r\nof the sea while the sediment gradually piles up: then the sea becomes\r\ndry land and the sediments are pressed into rocks again.  The eating\r\naway of the land by water is still going on: it is estimated that the\r\nwhole of the Thames valley is being lowered at the rate of about one\r\ninch in eight hundred years.  This seems very slow, but eight hundred\r\nyears is only a short time in geology, the science that deals with\r\nthese changes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.  The winding river Stour.  The river winds from\r\nthe right to the left of the picture, then back again, and then once\r\nmore to the left, passing under the white bridge and in front of the\r\nbarn.]\r\n\r\nWater does more than merely push the rock particles along.  It\r\ndissolves some of them, and in this way helps to break up the rock.\r\nSpring water always contains dissolved matter, derived from the rocks,\r\nsome of which comes out as \"fur\" in the kettles when the water is\r\nboiled.\r\n\r\nRocks are also broken up by other agents.  There is nearly always some\r\nlichen living on the rock, and if you {125} peel it off you can see\r\nthat it has eaten away some of the rock.  When the lichen dies it may\r\nchange into food for other plants.\r\n\r\nWe have learnt these things about soil formation.  First of all the\r\nrocks break up into fragments through the splitting action of freezing\r\nwater, the dissolving action of liquid water, and other causes.  This\r\nprocess goes on till the fragments are very small like soil particles.\r\nThen plants begin to grow, and as they die and decay they give rise to\r\nthe black humus that we have seen is so valuable a part of the soil (p.\r\n51).  This is how very many of our soils have been made.  But the\r\naction of water does not stop at breaking the rock up into soil; it\r\ngoes further and carries the particles away to the lower parts of the\r\nriver bed, or to the estuary, to form a delta, and mud flats that may\r\nbe reclaimed, like Romney Marsh in England and many parts of Holland\r\nhave been.  Many of our present soils have been formed in this way.\r\nFinally the particles may be carried right away to sea and spread out\r\non the bottom to lie there for many ages, but they may become dry land\r\nagain and once more be soil.\r\n\r\nOne thing more we learnt from the river Stour.  Why did it flow quickly\r\nat the bridge and slowly elsewhere?  We knew that the soil round the\r\nbridge was gravelly, whilst up and down the stream it was clayey.  The\r\nriver had not been able to make so wide or so deep a bed through the\r\ngravel as it had through the clay, and it could therefore be forded\r\nhere.  We knew also that there was a gravel pit at the next village on\r\nthe river, where also there was a bridge and had been a ford, and so we\r\nwere able to make a rough map like Fig. 57, showing that fords had\r\noccurred at the gravel {126} patches, but not at the clay places.  Now\r\nit was obvious that an inn, a blacksmith's forge, and a few shops and\r\ncottages would soon spring up round the ford, especially as the gravel\r\npatch was better to live on than the clay round about, and so we\r\nreadily understood why our village had been built where it was and not\r\na mile up or down the stream.  Almost any river will show the same\r\nthings: on the Lea near Harpenden we found the river flowed quickly at\r\nthe ford (Fig. 58), where there was a hard, stony bottom and no mud:\r\nwhilst above and below the ford the bottom was muddy and the stream\r\nflowed more slowly.  At the ford there is as usual a small village.\r\nThe Thames furnishes other examples: below Oxford there are numerous\r\nrocky or gravelly patches where fords were possible, and where villages\r\ntherefore grew up.  Above Oxford, however, the possibilities of fording\r\nwere fewer, because the soil is clay and there is less rock; the roads\r\nand therefore the villages grew up away from the river.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 57.  Sketch map showing why Godmersham and Wye arose\r\nwhere they did on the Stour.  At _A_, the gravel patch, the river has a\r\nhard bed and can be forded.  A village therefore grew up here.  At _B_,\r\nthe clay part, the river has a soft bed and cannot be forded.  The land\r\nis wet in winter, and the banks of the stream may be washed away.  It\r\nis therefore not a good site for a village]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.  Ford and Coldharbour, near Harpenden]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{128}\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nThe teacher is advised to procure, both for his own information and in\r\norder to read passages to the scholars:\r\n\r\n  Gilbert White, _Natural History of Selborne_.\r\n  Charles Darwin, _Earthworms and Vegetable Mould_ (Murray).\r\n  A. D. Hall, _The Soil_ (Murray).\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Hugh Richardson has supplied me with the following list of\r\nquestions, through many of which his scholars at Bootham School, York,\r\nhave worked.  They are inserted here to afford hints to other teachers\r\nand to show how the lessons may be varied.   They should also prove\r\nuseful for revising and testing the scholars' knowledge.\r\n\r\n1. Collect samples of the different soils in your neighbourhood--garden\r\nsoil, soil from a ploughed field, from a mole-hill in a pasture field,\r\nleaf mould from a wood, etc.  Collect also samples of the sub-soils,\r\nsand, gravel, clay, peat.\r\n\r\n2. Supplement your collection by purchasing from a gardener's shop some\r\nmixed potting soil and also the separate ingredients used to form such\r\na mixture--silver sand, leaf mould, peat.\r\n\r\n3. How many different sorts of peat can you get samples of?  Peat\r\nmould, peat moss litter, sphagnum moss, turf for burning, dry moor peat?\r\n\r\n4. Find for what different purposes sand is in use, such as mortar\r\nmaking, iron founding, scouring, bird cages, and obtain samples of each\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n{129}\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Garden Soil.  About a handful of soil will be required by\r\neach pupil.\r\n\r\n5. Describe the appearance of the soil.  Is it fine or in lumps?  Does\r\nit seem damp or dry?  Can you see the separate particles of mineral\r\nmatter?  How large are these?  Is there any evidence of vegetable\r\nmatter in the soil?\r\n\r\n6. Put some of the soil in an evaporating basin and over this place a\r\ndry filtering funnel.  Warm the basin gently.  Is any moisture given\r\noff?\r\n\r\n7. Dry some of the soil at a temperature not greater than that of\r\nboiling water, e.g. by spreading it out on a biscuit tin lid, and\r\nlaying this on a radiator.  How have the appearance and properties of\r\nthe soil been changed by drying?\r\n\r\n8. Crumble some of the dried soil as finely as you can with your\r\nfingers.  Then sift it through a sheet of clean wire gauze.  What\r\nfraction of the soil is fine enough to go through the gauze?  Describe\r\nthe portion which will not pass through the gauze.  Count the number of\r\nwires per linear inch in the gauze.\r\n\r\n9. Mix some of the soil with water in a flask.  Let it stand.  How long\r\ndoes it take before the water becomes quite clear again?\r\n\r\n10. Mix some more soil with water.  Let it settle for 30 seconds only.\r\nPour off the muddy water into a tall glass cylinder.  Add more water to\r\nthe remaining soil, and pour off a second portion of muddy water,\r\nadding it to the first, and so on until all the fine mud is removed\r\nfrom the soil.  Allow this muddy water ample time to settle.\r\n\r\n11. When the fine mud has settled pour off the bulk of the water; stir\r\nup the mud with the rest of the water; transfer it to an evaporating\r\nbasin, and evaporate to dryness.\r\n\r\n12. Does this dried mud consist of very tiny grains of sand or of some\r\nmaterial different from sand?  Can you find out with a microscope?\r\n\r\n13. If the mud consists of real clay and not of sand it should be\r\npossible to burn it into brick.  Moisten the dried mud again.  Roll it\r\nif you can into a round clay marble.  Leave this to dry slowly for a\r\nday.  Then bake it either in a chemical laboratory furnace or in an\r\nordinary fire.\r\n\r\n14. Return to the soil used in Question 10, from which only the fine\r\nmud has been washed away.  Pour more water on to it, shake it {130}\r\nwell, and pour off all the suspended matter without allowing it more\r\nthan 5 seconds to settle.  Repeat the process.  Collect and dry the\r\npoured off material as before.  What is the material this time, sand or\r\nclay?\r\n\r\n15. Wash the remaining portion of the soil in Question 14 clean from\r\nall matter which does not settle promptly.  Are there any pebbles left?\r\nIf so, how large are they, and of what kind of stone?\r\n\r\n16. Take a fresh sample of the soil.  Mix it with distilled water in a\r\nflask.  Boil the mixture.  Allow it to settle.  Filter.  Divide the\r\nfiltrate into two portions.  Evaporate both, the larger portion in an\r\nevaporating basin over wire gauze, the smaller portion in a watch glass\r\nheated by steam.  Is any residue left after heating to dryness?\r\n\r\n17. Take a fresh sample of soil.  Spread it on a clean sand bath and\r\nheat strongly with a Bunsen flame.  Does any portion of the soil burn?\r\nIs there any change in its appearance after heating?\r\n\r\n18. To a fresh sample of soil add some hydrochloric acid.  Is there any\r\neffervescence?  If so, what conclusions do you draw?\r\n\r\n19. Make a solution of soil in distilled water, and filter as before.\r\nIs this solution acid, alkaline or neutral?  Are you quite certain of\r\nyour result?  Did you test the distilled water with litmus paper?  And\r\nare you sure that your litmus does not contain excess of free acid or\r\nfree alkali?\r\n\r\n\r\nPeat.\r\n\r\n20. Examine different varieties of peat collected (see Question 2) and\r\ndescribe the appearance of each.\r\n\r\n21. Burn a fragment of each kind of peat on wire gauze.  What do you\r\nnotice?\r\n\r\n22. Boil some peat with distilled water and filter the solution.  What\r\ncolour is it?  Can you tell whether it is acid, neutral or alkaline?\r\nEvaporate some of the solution to dryness.\r\n\r\n\r\nOut-of-doors.\r\n\r\n23. Describe the appearance of the soil in the flower beds (_a_) during\r\nhard frost, (_b_) in the thaw which follows a hard frost, (_c_) after\r\nan April shower, (_d_) in drought at the end of summer, (_e_) in damp\r\nOctober weather when the leaves are beginning to fall.\r\n\r\n24. Is the soil equally friable at different times of the year?\r\n\r\n{131}\r\n\r\n25. In what way do dead leaves get carried into the soil?\r\n\r\n26. Can you find the worm holes in a garden lawn? in a garden path?\r\n\r\n27. Take a flower bed or grass plot of small but known area (say 3\r\nyards by 2 yards) and a watering can of known capacity (say 3 gallons).\r\nFind how much water must be added to the soil before some of the water\r\nwill remain on the surface.  What has been the capacity of the soil in\r\ngallons per square yard?\r\n\r\n28. Take two thermometers.  Lay one on the soil, the other with its\r\nbulb 3 inches deep in the soil.  Compare their temperatures at morning,\r\nnoon and night.\r\n\r\n29. Find from the 25-inch Ordnance map the reference numbers of the\r\nfields near your school.
