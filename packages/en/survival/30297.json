CLEMENS, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family Apatemyidae has a long geochronological range in North\r\nAmerica, beginning in the Torrejonian land-mammal age, but is\r\nrepresented by a relatively small number of fossils found at a few\r\nlocalities. Two fossils of Orellan age, found in northeastern Colorado\r\nand described here, demonstrate that the geochronological range of the\r\nApatemyidae extends into the Middle Oligocene. Isolated teeth of\r\n_Sinclairella dakotensis_ Jepsen, part of a sample of a Chadronian\r\nlocal fauna collected by field parties from the Webb School of\r\nCalifornia, are also described.\r\n\r\n     I thank Mr. Raymond M. Alf, Webb School of California,\r\n     Claremont, California, and Dr. Peter Robinson, University of\r\n     Colorado Museum, Boulder, Colorado, for permitting me to\r\n     describe the fossils they discovered. Also Dr. Robinson made\r\n     available the draft of a short paper he had prepared on the\r\n     tooth found in Weld County, Colorado; his work was\r\n     facilitated by a grant from the University of Colorado\r\n     Council on Research and Creative Work. I also gratefully\r\n     acknowledge receipt of critical data and valuable comments\r\n     from Drs. Edwin C. Galbreath, Glenn L. Jepsen, and Malcolm\r\n     C. McKenna who is currently revising the Paleocene\r\n     apatemyids and studying the phylogenetic relationships of\r\n     the family. The prefixes of catalogue numbers used in the\r\n     text identify fossils in the collections of the following\r\n     institutions: KU, Museum of Natural History, The University\r\n     of Kansas, Lawrence; Princeton, Princeton Museum, Princeton,\r\n     New Jersey; RAM-UCR, Raymond Alf Museum, Webb School of\r\n     California, Claremont, California (the permanent repository\r\n     for these specimens will be the University of California,\r\n     Riverside); and UCM, University of Colorado Museum, Boulder,\r\n     Colorado. The system of notations for teeth prescribed for\r\n     use here is as follows: teeth in the upper half of the\r\n     dentition are designated by a capital letter and a number;\r\n     thus M2 is the notation for the upper second molar; teeth in\r\n     the lower half of the dentition are designated by a\r\n     lower-case letter and a number; thus p2 is the notation for\r\n     the lower second premolar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamily APATEMYIDAE Matthew, 1909\r\n\r\nGenus =Sinclairella= Jepsen, 1934\r\n\r\n=Sinclairella dakotensis= Jepsen, 1934\r\n\r\n\r\nThe type of the species, Princeton no. 13585, was discovered in\r\nChadronian strata of the upper part of the Chadron Formation cropping\r\nout in Big Corral Draw, approximately 13 miles south-southwest of\r\nScenic, in southwestern South Dakota (Jepsen, 1934, p. 291). Detailed\r\ndescriptions of the type specimen are given in papers by Jepsen (1934)\r\nand Scott and Jepsen (1936). Isolated teeth of Chadronian age referable\r\nto _Sinclairella dakotensis_ have been discovered subsequently at a\r\nlocality in Nebraska and fossils of Orellan age, also referable to _S.\r\ndakotensis_, have been collected at two localities in Colorado. The\r\nsample from each locality is described separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nSioux County, northwestern Nebraska\r\n\r\n     _Material._--RAM-UCR nos. 381, left M1; 598, left m2; 1000,\r\n     right m1; 1001, right m2; 1079, right m2; 1674, right M2;\r\n     and 3013, left m2.\r\n\r\n     _Locality and stratigraphy._--These Chadronian fossils were\r\n     discovered by Raymond Alf and members of his field parties\r\n     in several harvester ant mounds built in exposures of the\r\n     Chadron Formation in Sec. 26, T 33 N, R 53 W, Sioux County,\r\n     Nebraska (Alf, 1962, and Hough and Alf, 1958). This is UCR\r\n     locality V5403. The collectors carefully considered the\r\n     possibility that some of the fossils found in the ant mounds\r\n     were collected from younger strata by the harvester ants and\r\n     concluded this was unlikely (Alf, personal communication).\r\n\r\n     _Description and comments._--The cusps of RAM-UCR no. 381, a\r\n     left M1, are sharp and the wear-facets resulting from\r\n     occlusion with the lower dentition are small. The paraconule\r\n     is a low, ill-defined cusp on the anterior margin of the\r\n     crown; a metaconule is not present. A smooth stylar shelf is\r\n     present labial to the metacone. The crown was supported by\r\n     three roots. There are no interradicular crests.\r\n\r\n     The crown of RAM-UCR no. 1674, a right M2, is heavily\r\n     abraded and many morphological details of the cusps have\r\n     been destroyed. Low interradicular crests linked the three\r\n     roots of the tooth with a low, central prominence. As was\r\n     the case with RAM-UCR no. 381, no significant differences\r\n     could be found in comparisons with illustrations of the\r\n     teeth preserved in Princeton no. 13585.\r\n\r\n     RAM-UCR nos. 598, 1001, 1079, and 3013 all appear to be\r\n     m2's. The talonids of these teeth are not elongated, their\r\n     trigonids have quadrilateral outlines, and the paraconids\r\n     are small but prominent, bladelike cusps. The trigonid of\r\n     RAM-UCR 1000 is elongated and the paraconid is a minute\r\n     cusp; the tooth closely resembles the m1 of the type of\r\n     _Sinclairella dakotensis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLogan County, northeastern Colorado\r\n\r\n     _Material._--KU no. 11210 (fig. 1), a fragment of a left\r\n     maxillary containing P4 and M1-2.\r\n\r\n     _Locality and stratigraphy._--The fossil was found in the\r\n     center of the W-1/2, Sec. 21, T 11 N, R 53 W, Logan County,\r\n     Colorado, \"... in the bed below _Agnotocastor_ bed, Cedar\r\n     Creek Member....\" (Ronald H. Pine, 1958, field notes on file\r\n     at the University of Kansas). The bed so defined is part of\r\n     unit 3 in the lower division of the Cedar Creek Member, as\r\n     subdivided by Galbreath (1953:25) in stratigraphic section\r\n     XII. The fauna obtained from unit 3 is of Orellan age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. _Sinclairella dakotensis_ Jepsen, KU no. 11210,\r\nfragment of left maxillary with P4 and M1-2; Orellan, Logan County,\r\nColorado; drawings by Mrs. Judith Hood: a, labial view; b, occlusal\r\nview; both approximately × 9.]\r\n\r\n     _Description and comments._--P4 of KU no. 11210 has a large\r\n     posterolingual cusp separated from the main cusp by a\r\n     distinct groove, which deepens posteriorly. The\r\n     posterolingual cusp is supported by the broad posterior\r\n     root. P4 of the type specimen of _Sinclairella dakotensis_\r\n     is described (Jepsen, 1934, p. 392) as having an oval\r\n     outline at the base of the crown, and a small,\r\n     posterolingual cusp. A chip of enamel is missing from the\r\n     posterior slope of the main cusp of the P4 of KU no. 11210.\r\n     The anterior slope of the main cusp is flattened, possibly\r\n     the result of wear, and there is no evidence of a groove\r\n     like that present on the P4 of the type specimen.\r\n\r\n     Only a few differences were found between the molars\r\n     preserved in KU no. 11210 and their counterparts in the type\r\n     specimen. A stylar shelf is present labial to the metacone\r\n     of M1 of KU no. 11210, but, unlike the type, its surface is\r\n     smooth and there is no evidence of cusps. Of the three small\r\n     stylar cusps on the stylar shelf of M2 the smallest is in\r\n     the position of a mesostyle. The M2 lacks a chip of enamel\r\n     from the lingual surface of the hypocone. Unlike the M2 of\r\n     Princeton no. 13585, in occlusal view the posterior margin\r\n     of the M2 of KU no. 11210 is convex posterior to the\r\n     metacone. The anterior edge of the base of the zygomatic\r\n     arch of KU no. 11210 was dorsal to M2. The shallow oval\r\n     depression in the maxillary dorsal to M1 might be the result\r\n     of post-mortem distortion.\r\n\r\n     The molars preserved in KU no. 11210 and their counterparts\r\n     in the type specimen do not appear to be significantly\r\n     different in size (table 1) or morphology of the cusps. The\r\n     only difference between the two specimens that might be of\r\n     classificatory significance is the difference in size of the\r\n     posterolingual cusp of P4. At present the range of\r\n     intraspecific variation in the morphology of P4 has not been\r\n     documented for any species of apatemyid. The evolutionary\r\n     trend or trends of the apatemyids (McKenna, 1960, p. 48) for\r\n     progressive reduction of function of p4 probably were\r\n     paralleled by similar trends in the evolution of the P4. If\r\n     so, the intraspecific variation in the morphology of P4\r\n     could be expected to be somewhat greater than that of the\r\n     upper molars, for example. The morphological difference\r\n     between the P4's of the type of _Sinclairella dakotensis_\r\n     and KU no. 11210 is not extreme and does not exceed the\r\n     range of intraspecific variation that could be expected for\r\n     this element of the dentition. The close resemblances in\r\n     size and morphology between the M1-2 of Princeton no. 13585\r\n     and KU no. 11210 also favor identification of the latter as\r\n     part of a member of an Orellan population of _Sinclairella\r\n     dakotensis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeld County, northeastern Colorado\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. _Sinclairella dakotensis_ Jepsen, UCM no. 21073,\r\nright M2; Orellan, Weld County, Colorado; drawing by Mrs. Judith Hood:\r\nocclusal view, approximately × 9.]\r\n\r\n     _Material._--UCM no. 20173 (fig. 2), is a right M2.\r\n\r\n     _Locality and stratigraphy._--The tooth was discovered at\r\n     the Mellinger locality, Sec. 17, T 11 N, R 65 W, Weld\r\n     County, Colorado. The Mellinger locality is in the Cedar\r\n     Creek Member, White River Formation, and its fauna is\r\n     considered to be of Orellan age (Patterson and McGrew, 1937,\r\n     and Galbreath, 1953).\r\n\r\n     _Description and comments._--UCM no. 21073, which is more\r\n     heavily abraded than KU no. 11210, shows no evidence of a\r\n     stylar cusp either anterolabial to the metacone or in the\r\n     position of a mesostyle. A small stylar cusp is present\r\n     anterolabial to the paracone. A notch that appears to have\r\n     been cut through the enamel of the posterolabial corner of\r\n     the crown could have received the parastylar apex of M3. A\r\n     similar notch is not present on the M2 of KU no. 11210 nor\r\n     indicated in the illustrations of the M2 of Princeton no.\r\n     13585. The coronal dimensions of UCM no. 21073 (table 1) do\r\n     not appear to differ significantly from those of the M2's of\r\n     KU no. 11210 and the type specimen of _Sinclairella\r\n     dakotensis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of Orellan apatemyids the geochronological range of\r\nthe family in North America is shown to extend from the Torrejonian\r\nthrough the Orellan land-mammal ages. The discoveries reported here\r\nenlarge the Oligocene record of apatemyids to include not only the type\r\nspecimen of _Sinclairella dakotensis_, a skull and associated mandible\r\nfrom South Dakota, but also seven isolated teeth, representing at least\r\ntwo individuals, from a Chadronian fossil locality in Nebraska and one\r\nspecimen from each of two Orellan fossil localities in northeastern\r\nColorado. Simpson (1944:73, and 1953:127) presented tabulations of the\r\npublished records of American apatemyids and suggested the data\r\nindicated the populations of these mammals were of small size\r\nthroughout the history of the family. The few pre-Oligocene occurrences\r\nof apatemyids described subsequently (note McKenna, 1960, figs. 3-10,\r\nand p. 48) and occurrences described here tend to reinforce Simpson's\r\ninterpretation. This interpretation may have to be modified to some\r\ndegree, however, when current studies of collections of pre-Oligocene\r\napatemyids are completed (McKenna, personal communication).\r\n\r\nAlthough information concerning the evolutionary trends of American\r\napatemyids has been published, no data on the morphological variation\r\nin a population are available in the literature. An adequate basis for\r\nevaluating the significance of the morphological differences between\r\nthe P4's of Princeton no. 13585 and KU no. 12110 coupled with the\r\nsimilarities of their M1-2's is lacking. In the evolution of American\r\napatemyids the P4 underwent reduction in size and, apparently,\r\ncurtailment of function. This history suggests the range of\r\nmorphological variation of P4 in populations of _Sinclairella\r\ndakotensis_ could be expected to be greater than that of the molars and\r\nencompass the morphological differences between the P4's of Princeton\r\nno. 13585 and KU no. 12110. The difference in age of the Chadronian and\r\nOrellan fossils does not constitute proof that they pertain to\r\ndifferent species. Although the identification is admittedly\r\nprovisional until more fossils including other parts of the skeleton\r\nare discovered, the Orellan fossils described here are referred to\r\n_Sinclairella dakotensis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.--MEASUREMENTS (IN MILLIMETERS) OF TEETH OF SINCLAIRELLA\r\nDAKOTENSIS JEPSEN.\r\n\r\n==========================================================================\r\n                       |     P4     |        M1        |        M2\r\n-----------------------+------------+------------------+------------------\r\n                       |length|width|length[1]|width[1]|length[1]|width[1]\r\n-----------------------+------+-----+---------+--------+---------+--------\r\nPrinceton no. 13585[2] | 2.1  | 1.1 |   4.0   |  3.7   |   3.4   |  4.7\r\nRAM no. 381            |      |     |   4.1   |  3.5   |         |\r\nRAM no. 1674           |      |     |         |        |   3.4   |  4.2\r\nKU no. 11210           | 2.4  | 1.6 |   3.9   |  3.5   |   3.8   |  4.1+\r\nUCM no. 21073          |      |     |         |        |   3.6   |  4.1\r\n-----------------------+------+-----+---------+--------+---------+--------\r\n                                    |       m1         |        m2\r\n                                    +---------+--------+---------+--------\r\n                                    |  length |  width |  length | width\r\n                                    +---------+--------+---------+--------\r\nPrinceton no. 13585[3]              |    3.5  |   2.4  |    3.7  |  2.8\r\nRAM no. 1000                        |    3.5  |   2.2  |         |\r\nRAM no. 598                         |         |        |    3.8  |  2.6\r\nRAM no. 1001                        |         |        |    3.6+ |  2.6\r\nRAM no. 1079                        |         |        |    4.0  |  2.8\r\nRAM no. 3013                        |         |        |    3.6  |  2.8\r\n------------------------------------+---------+--------+---------+--------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Length defined as maximum dimension of the labial half of\r\nthe crown measured parallel to a line drawn through the apices of\r\nparacone and metacone.
