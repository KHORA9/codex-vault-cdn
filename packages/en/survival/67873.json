In the first of these works the phenomena of volcanic activity\r\nare described, and its causes discussed; in the second it is shown that\r\nmuch insight concerning these problems may be obtained by a study of\r\nthe ruined and denuded relics of the volcanoes of former geological\r\nperiods. The appearance of these works, in the years 1825 and 1827\r\nrespectively, did much to prepare the minds of the earlier cultivators\r\nof science for the reception of those doctrines of geological\r\nuniformity and continuity, which were shortly afterwards so ably\r\nadvocated by Lyell in his 'Principles of Geology.'\r\n\r\nSince the date of the appearance of the last editions of Scrope's\r\nworks, inquiry and speculation concerning the nature and origin of\r\nvolcanoes have been alike active, and many of the problems which were\r\ndiscussed by him, now present themselves under aspects entirely new and\r\ndifferent from those in which he was accustomed to regard them. No one\r\nwas ever more ready to welcome original views or to submit to having\r\nlong-cherished principles exposed to the ordeal of free criticism than\r\nwas Scrope; and few men retained to so advanced an age the power of\r\nsubjecting novel theories to the test of a rigorous comparison with\r\nascertained facts.\r\n\r\nBut this eminent geologist was not content with the devotion of his\r\nown time and energies to the advancement of his favourite science, for\r\nas increasing age and growing infirmities rendered travel and personal\r\nresearch impossible, he found a new source of pleasure in seeking\r\nout the younger workers in those fields of inquiry which he had so\r\nlong and successfully cultivated, and in furthering their efforts by\r\nhis judicious advice and kindly aid. Among the chosen disciples of\r\nthis distinguished man, who will ever be regarded as one of the chief\r\npioneers of geological thought, I had the good fortune to be numbered,\r\nand when he committed to me the task of preparing a popular exposition\r\nof the present condition of our knowledge on volcanoes, I felt that I\r\nhad been greatly honoured.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep the work within the prescribed limits, and to avoid\r\nunnecessary repetitions, I have confined myself to the examination of\r\nsuch selected examples of volcanoes as could be shown to be really\r\ntypical of all the various classes which exist upon the globe; and\r\nI have endeavoured from the study of these to deduce those general\r\nlaws which appear to govern volcanic action. But it has, at the\r\nsame time, been my aim to approach the question from a somewhat new\r\nstandpoint, and to give an account of those investigations which have\r\nin recent times thrown so much fresh light upon the whole problem.\r\nIn this way I have been led to dwell at some length upon subjects\r\nwhich might not at first sight appear to be germane to the question\r\nunder discussion;--such as the characters of lavas revealed to us\r\nby microscopic examination; the nature and movements of the liquids\r\nenclosed in the crystals of igneous rocks; the relations of minerals\r\noccurring in some volcanic products to those found in meteorites; the\r\nnature and origin of the remarkable iron-masses found at Ovifak in\r\nGreenland; and the indications which have been discovered of analogies\r\nbetween the composition and dynamics of our earth and those of other\r\nmembers of the family of worlds to which it belongs. While not evading\r\nthe discussion of theoretical questions, I have endeavoured to keep\r\nsuch discussions in strict subordination to that presentation of the\r\nresults attained by observation and experiment, which constitutes the\r\nprincipal object of the work.\r\n\r\nThe woodcuts which illustrate the volume are in some cases prepared\r\nfrom photographs, and I am indebted to Mr. Cooper for the skill with\r\nwhich he has carried out my wishes concerning their reproduction.\r\nOthers among the engravings are copies of sketches which I made in\r\nItaly, Hungary, Bohemia, and other volcanic districts. The whole of the\r\nwood-blocks employed by Mr. Poulett Scrope in his work on Volcanoes\r\nwere placed at my disposal before his death, and such of them as\r\nwere useful for my purpose I have freely employed. To Captain S. P.\r\nOliver, R.A., I am obliged for a beautiful drawing made in the Island\r\nof Bourbon, and to Mr. Norman Lockyer and his publishers, Messrs.\r\nMacmillan & Co., for the use of several wood-blocks illustrating\r\nsun-spots and solar prominences.\r\n\r\n                                                               J.

This is a familiar question, often addressed to us\r\nin our youth, which 'Catechisms of Universal Knowledge,' and similar\r\nschool manuals, have taught us to reply to in some such terms as the\r\nfollowing: 'A volcano is a burning mountain, from the summit of which\r\nissue smoke and flames.' Such a statement as this, it is probable, does\r\nnot unfairly represent the ideas which are, even at the present day,\r\npopularly entertained upon the subject.\r\n\r\nBut in this, as in so many other cases, our first step towards the\r\nacquirement of scientific or exact knowledge, must be the unlearning of\r\nwhat we have before been led to regard as true. The description which\r\nwe have quoted is not merely incomplete and inadequate as a whole,\r\nbut each individual proposition of which it is made up is grossly\r\ninaccurate, and, what is worse, perversely misleading. In the first\r\nplace, the action which takes place at volcanoes is not 'burning,' or\r\ncombustion, and bears, indeed, no relation whatever to that well-known\r\nprocess. Nor are volcanoes necessarily 'mountains' at all; essentially,\r\nthey are just the reverse--namely, holes in the earth's crust, or\r\nouter portion, by means of which a communication is kept up between\r\nthe surface and the interior of our globe. When mountains do exist at\r\ncentres of volcanic activity, they are simply the heaps of materials\r\nthrown out of these holes, and must therefore be regarded not as the\r\ncauses but as the consequences of the volcanic action. Neither does\r\nthis action always take place at the 'summits' of volcanic mountains,\r\nwhen such exist, for eruptions occur quite as frequently on their sides\r\nor at their base. That, too, which popular fancy regards as 'smoke'\r\nis really condensing steam or watery vapour, and the supposed raging\r\n'flames' are nothing more than the glowing light of a mass of molten\r\nmaterial reflected from these vapour clouds.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to understand how these false notions on the\r\nsubject of volcanic action have come to be so generally prevalent.\r\nIn the earlier stages of its development, the human mind is much\r\nmore congenially employed in drinking in that which is marvellous\r\nthan in searching for that which is true. It must be admitted, too,\r\nthat the grand and striking phenomena displayed by volcanoes are\r\nespecially calculated to inspire terror and to excite superstition,\r\nand such feelings most operate in preventing those close and accurate\r\nobservations which alone can form the basis of scientific reasoning.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IDEAS OF THE ANCIENTS.]\r\n\r\nThe ancients were acquainted only with the four or five active\r\nvolcanoes in the Mediterranean area; the term 'volcano' being the\r\nname of one of these (Vulcano, or Volcano, in the Lipari Islands),\r\nwhich has come to be applied to all similar phenomena. It is only in\r\ncomparatively modern times that it has become a known £act that many\r\nhundreds of volcanoes exist upon the globe, and are scattered over\r\nalmost every part of its surface. Classical mythology appropriated\r\nVulcano as the forge of Hephæstus, and his Roman representative Vulcan,\r\nwhile Etna was regarded as formed by the mountains under which a\r\nvengeful deity had buried the rebellious Typhon; it may be imagined,\r\ntherefore, that any endeavour to more closely investigate the phenomena\r\ndisplayed at these localities would be regarded, not simply as an act\r\nof temerity, but as one of actual impiety. In mediæval times similar\r\nfeelings would operate with not less force in the same direction, for\r\nthe popular belief identified the subterranean fires with a place of\r\neverlasting torment; Vulcano was regarded as the place of punishment\r\nof the Arian Emperor Theodosius, while Etna was assigned to poor Anne\r\nBoleyn, the perverter of faith in the person of its stoutest defender.\r\nThat such feelings of superstitious terror in connection with volcanoes\r\nare, even at the present day, far from being extinct, will be attested\r\nby every traveller who, in carrying on investigations about volcanic\r\ncentres, has had to avail himself of the assistance of guides and\r\nattendants from among the common people.\r\n\r\nAmong the great writers of antiquity we find several who had so far\r\nemancipated their minds from the popular superstitions as to be able\r\nto enunciate just and rational views upon the subject of volcanoes.\r\nUntil quite recent times, however, their teaching was quite forgotten\r\nor neglected, and the modern science of Vulcanology may be said to have\r\nentirely grown up within the last one hundred years.\r\n\r\nThe great pioneer in this important branch of research was the\r\nillustrious Italian naturalist Spallanzani, who, in the year 1788,\r\nvisited the several volcanoes of his native land, and published an\r\naccount of the numerous valuable and original observations which he\r\nhad made upon them. About the same time the French geologist Dolomieu\r\nshowed how much light might be thrown on the nature of volcanic action\r\nby a study of the various materials which are ejected from volcanic\r\nvents; while our own countryman. Sir William Hamilton, was engaged in\r\na systematic study of the changes in form of volcanic mountains, and\r\nof the causes which determine their growth. At a somewhat later date\r\nthe three German naturalists. Von Buch, Humboldt, and Abich, greatly\r\nextended our knowledge of volcanoes by their travels in different\r\nportions of the globe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARACTER OF MODERN RESEARCHES.]\r\n\r\nThe first attempt, however, to frame a satisfactory theory of volcanic\r\naction, and to show the part which volcanoes have played in the past\r\nhistory of our globe, together with their place in its present economy,\r\nwas made in 1825, by Poulett Scrope, whose great work, 'Considerations\r\non Volcanoes,' may be regarded as the earliest systematic treatise on\r\nVulcanology. Since the publication of this work, many new lines of\r\ninquiry have been opened up in connection with the subject, and fresh\r\nmethods of research have been devised and applied to it. More exact\r\nobservations of travellers over wider areas have greatly multiplied\r\nthe facts upon which we may reason and speculate, and many erroneous\r\nhypotheses which had grown up in connection with the subject have been\r\nremoved by patient and critical inquiry.\r\n\r\nWe propose in the following pages to give an outline of the present\r\nstate of knowledge upon the subject, and to indicate the bearings\r\nof those conclusions which have already been arrived at, upon the\r\ngreat questions of the history of our globe and the relations which\r\nit bears to the other portions of the universe. In attempting this\r\ntask we cannot do better than take up the several lines of inquiry\r\nin the order in which they have been seized upon and worked out by\r\nthe original investigators; for never, perhaps, is the development\r\nof thought in the individual mind so natural in its methods, and so\r\npermanent in its effects, as when it obeys those laws which determined\r\nits growth in the collective mind of the race. In our minds, as in our\r\nbodies, development in the individual is an epitome, or microcosmic\r\nreproduction, of evolution in the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF VOLCANIC ACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dose investigation of what goes on within a volcanic vent may\r\nappear at first sight to be a task beset with so many difficulties and\r\ndangers that we may be tempted to abandon it as altogether hopeless. At\r\nthe first recorded eruption of Vesuvius the elder Pliny lost his life\r\nin an attempt to approach the mountain and examine the action which\r\nwas taking place there; and during the last great outburst of the same\r\nvolcano a band of Neapolitan students, whose curiosity was greater than\r\ntheir prudence, shared the same fate.\r\n\r\nBut in both these cases the inquirers paid the penalty of having\r\nadopted a wrong method. If we wish to examine the mode of working of a\r\ncomplicated steam-engine, it will be of little avail for us to watch\r\nthe machinery when the full blast of steam is turned on, and the rapid\r\nmovements of levers, pinions, and slides baffle all attempts to follow\r\nthem, and render hopeless every effort to trace their connection with\r\none another. But if some friendly hand turn off the greater part of\r\nthe steam-supply, then, as the rods move slowly backwards and forwards,\r\nas the wheels make their measured revolutions, and the valves axe\r\nseen gradually opening and shutting, we may have an opportunity of\r\ndetermining the relations of the several parts of the machine to one\r\nanother, and of arriving at just conclusions concerning the plan on\r\nwhich it is constructed. Nor can we doubt that the parts of the machine\r\nbear the same relation to one another, and that their movements take\r\nplace in precisely the same order, when the supply of steam is large as\r\nwhen it is small.\r\n\r\nNow, as we shall show in the sequel, a volcano is a kind of great\r\nnatural steam-engine, and our best method of investigating its action\r\nis to watch it when a part of the steam-supply is cut off. It is\r\ntrue that we cannot at will control the source of supply of steam to\r\na volcano, as we can in a steam-engine, but as some volcanoes have\r\nusually only a small steam-supply, and nearly all volcanoes vary\r\ngreatly in the intensity of their action at different periods, we can,\r\nby a careful selection of the object or the time of our study, gain all\r\nthose advantages which would be obtained by regulating its action for\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nSpallanzani appears to have been the first to perceive the important\r\nfact, that the nature of volcanic action remains the same, however\r\nits intensity may vary. Taking advantage of the circumstance that\r\nthere exists in the Mediterranean Sea a volcano--Stromboli--which\r\nfor at least 2,000 years has been in a constant and regular, but not\r\nin a violent or dangerous, state of activity, he visited the spot,\r\nand made the series of careful observations which laid the foundation\r\nof our knowledge of the 'physiology of volcanoes.' Since the time\r\nof Spallanzani, many other investigators have visited the crater\r\nof Stromboli, and they have been able to confirm and extend the\r\nobservations of the great Italian naturalist, as to the character of\r\nthe action which is constantly taking place within it. We cannot better\r\nillustrate the nature of volcanic action than by describing what has\r\nbeen witnessed by numerous observers within the crater of Stromboli,\r\nwhere it is possible to watch the series of operations going on by the\r\nhour together, and to do so without having our judgment warped either\r\nby an excited imagination or the sense of danger.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: APPEARANCE OF STROMBOLI FROM A DISTANCE.]\r\n\r\nIn the sketch, fig. 1, which was made on April 20, 1874, I have shown\r\nthe appearance which this interesting volcano usually presents, when\r\nviewed from a distance. The island is of rudely circular outline, and\r\nconical form, and rises to the height of 3,090 feet above the level of\r\nthe Mediterranean. From a point on the side of the mountain, masses\r\nof vapour are seen to issue, and these unite to form a cloud over\r\nthe mountain, the outline of this vapour-cloud varying continually\r\naccording to the hygrometric state of the atmosphere, and the direction\r\nand force of the wind. At the time when this sketch was made, the\r\nvapour-cloud was spread in a great horizontal stratum overshadowing\r\nthe whole island, but it was clearly seen to be made up of a number\r\nof globular masses, each of which, as we shall hereafter see, is the\r\nproduct of a distinct outburst of the volcanic forces.\r\n\r\nViewed at night-time, Stromboli presents a far more striking and\r\nsingular spectacle. The mountain, with its vapour canopy, is visible\r\nover an area having a radius of more than 100 miles. When watched from\r\nthe deck of a vessel anywhere within this area, a glow of red light is\r\nseen to make its appearance from time to time above the summit of the\r\nmountain; this glow of light may be observed to increase gradually in\r\nintensity, and then as gradually to die away. After a short interval\r\nthe same appearances are repeated, and this goes on till the increasing\r\nlight of the dawn causes the phenomenon to be no longer visible. The\r\nresemblance presented by Stromboli to a 'flashing light' on a most\r\ngigantic scale is very striking, and the mountain has long been known\r\nas 'the lighthouse of the Mediterranean.'\r\n\r\nIt must be pointed out, however, that in two very important particulars\r\nthe appearances presented by Stromboli differ markedly from those\r\nrhythmical gleams exhibited by the 'flashing-lights' of our coasts.\r\nIn the first place, the intervals between successive flashes are very\r\nunequal, varying from less than one minute to twenty minutes, or even\r\nmore; and in the second place, the duration and intensity of the red\r\nglow above the mountain are subject to like variation, being sometimes\r\na momentary scarcely visible gleam, and at others a vivid burst of\r\nlight which illuminates the sky to a considerable distance round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Stromboli, viewed from the North-west, April\r\n1874.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Map of tub Island of Stromboli. (Scale about\r\ntwo inches to a mile.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GENERAL FEATURES OF THE MOUNTAIN.]\r\n\r\nLet us now draw near and examine this wonderful phenomenon of a\r\nmountain which seemingly ever burns with fire, and yet is not consumed.\r\nThe general form of the Island of Stromboli will be gathered from an\r\ninspection of the plan, fig. 2, which is copied from a map published by\r\nthe Italian Government. When we land upon the island, we find that it\r\nis entirely built up of such materials as we know to be ejected from\r\nvolcanoes; indeed, it resembles on a gigantic scale the surroundings\r\nof an iron furnace, with its heaps of cinders and masses of slag. The\r\nirregularity in the form of the island is at once seen to be due to the\r\naction of the wind, the rain, and the waves of the surrounding sea,\r\nwhich have removed the loose, cindery materials at some points, and\r\nleft the hard, slaggy masses standing up prominently at others.\r\n\r\nThis great heap of cindery and slaggy materials rises, as we have said,\r\nto a height of more than 3,000 feet above the sea-level, but even this\r\nmeasurement does not give a just idea of its vast bulk. Soundings in\r\nthe sea surrounding the island show that the bottom gradually shelves\r\naround the shores to the depth of nearly 600 fathoms, so that Stromboli\r\nis a great conical mass of cinders and slaggy materials, having a\r\nheight of over 6,000 feet, and a base whose diameter exceeds four miles.\r\n\r\nThe general form and proportions of this mass will be better understood\r\nby an examination of the section, fig. 3, which is also constructed\r\nfrom the materials furnished by the map of the island issued by the\r\nItalian Government. The same section, and the map, fig. 2, will serve\r\nto make clear the position and relations of the point on the mountain\r\nat which the volcanic activity takes place. At a spot on the north-west\r\nslope of the mountain, about 1,000 feet below its summit, and 2,000\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, there exists a circular depression,\r\nthe present active 'crater' of the volcano; and leading down from this\r\nto the sea there is a flat slope making an angle of about 35° with the\r\nhorizon, and known as the 'Sciarra.' The Sciarra is bounded by steep\r\ncliffs, as shown in the sketch fig. 1, and the plan fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Section through the Island of Stromboli from\r\nn.w. to s.e.\r\n\r\n_a._ Highest summit of the mountain, _c._ Cratère del Fossa, _b._ Point\r\noverlooking the crater, _d._ Steep slope known as the Sciarra del\r\nFuoco. _e._ Continuation of the same slope beneath the level of the\r\nsea. _f._ Steep cliffs of the Punta dell' Omo.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORM AND FUNCTION OF THE CRATER.]\r\n\r\nIf we climb up to this scene of volcanic activity, we shall be able to\r\nwatch narrowly the operations which are going on there. On the morning\r\nof the 24th of April, 1874, I paid a visit to this interesting spot in\r\norder to get a near view of what was taking place. On reaching a point\r\nupon the side of the Sciarra, from which the crater was in full view\r\nbefore me, I witnessed, and made a sketch of, an outburst which then\r\ntook place, and this sketch has been reproduced in fig. 4. Before the\r\noutburst, numerous light curling wreaths of vapour were seen ascending\r\nfrom fissures on the sides and bottom of the crater. Suddenly, and\r\nwithout the slightest warning, a sound was heard like that produced\r\nwhen a locomotive blows off its steam at a railway-station; a great\r\nvolume of watery vapour was at the same time thrown violently into\r\nthe atmosphere, and with it there were hurled upwards a number of\r\ndark fragments, which rose to the height of 400 or 500 feet above the\r\ncrater, describing curves in their course, and then falling back upon\r\nthe mountain. Most of these fragments tumbled into the crater with a\r\nloud, rattling noise, but some of them fell outside the crater, and a\r\nfew rolled down the steep slope of the Sciarra into the sea. Some of\r\nthese falling fragments were found to be still hot and glowing, and in\r\na semi-molten condition, so that they readily received the impression\r\nof a coin thrust into them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--The Crates of Stromboli as viewed from the side\r\nof the Sciarra during an eruption on the morning of April 24, 1874.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: APERTURES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER.]\r\n\r\nBut on the upper side of the crater, at the point marked 6, on the\r\nsection fig. 3, there exists a spot from which we can look down upon\r\nthe bottom of the crater, and view the operations taking place there.\r\nThis is the place where Spallanzani and other later investigators have\r\ncarried on their observations, and, when the wind is blowing from\r\nthe spectator towards the crater, he may sit for hours watching the\r\nwonderful scene displayed before him. The black slaggy bottom of the\r\ncrater is seen to be traversed by many fissures or cracks, from most\r\nof which curling jets of vapour issue quietly, and gradually mingle\r\nwith and disappear in the atmosphere. But besides these smaller cracks\r\nat the bottom of the crater, several larger openings are seen, which\r\nvary in number and position at different periods; sometimes only one of\r\nthese apertures is visible, at others as many as six or seven, and the\r\nphenomena presented at these larger apertures are especially worthy of\r\ncareful investigation.\r\n\r\nThese larger apertures, if we study the nature of the action taking\r\nplace at them, may be divided into three classes. From those of the\r\nfirst class, steam is emitted with loud, snorting puffs, like those\r\nproduced by a locomotive-engine, but far less regular and rhythmical\r\nin their succession. In the second class of apertures masses of molten\r\nmaterial are seen welling out, and, if the position of the aperture\r\nbe favourable, flowing outside the crater; from this liquid molten\r\nmass steam is seen to escape, sometimes in considerable quantities.\r\nThe openings of the third class present still more interesting\r\nappearances. Within the walls of the aperture a viscid or semi-liquid\r\nsubstance is seen slowly heaving up and down. As we watch the seething\r\nmass the agitation within it is observed to increase gradually, and at\r\nlast a gigantic bubble is formed which violently bursts, when a great\r\nrush of steam takes place, carrying fragments of the scum-like surface\r\nof the liquid high into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIf we visit the crater by night, the appearances presented are found to\r\nbe still more striking and suggestive. The smaller cracks and larger\r\nopenings glow with a ruddy light. The liquid matter is seen to be red-\r\nor even white-hot, while the scum or crust which forms upon it is of a\r\ndull red colour. Every time a bubble bursts and the crust is broken up\r\nby the escape of steam, a fresh, glowing surface of the incandescent\r\nmaterial is exposed. If at these moments we look up at the vapour-cloud\r\ncovering the mountain, we shall at once understand the cause of the\r\nsingular appearances presented by Stromboli when viewed from a distance\r\nat night, for the great masses of vapour are seen to be lit up with a\r\nvivid, ruddy glow, like that produced when an engine-driver opens the\r\ndoor of the furnace and illuminates the stream of vapour issuing from\r\nthe funnel of his locomotive.\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavour to analyse the phenomena so admirably displayed\r\nbefore us in the crater of Stromboli. The three essential conditions\r\non which the production of these phenomena seems to depend are the\r\nfollowing: first, the existence of certain apertures or cracks\r\ncommunicating between the interior and the surface of the earth;\r\nsecondly, the presence of matter in a highly heated condition beneath\r\nthe surface; and thirdly, the existence of great quantities of water\r\nimprisoned in the subterranean regions--which water, escaping as steam,\r\ngives rise to all those active phenomena we have been describing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAUSE OF THE GLOWING LIGHT.]\r\n\r\nWe have said, at the outset, that there exists no analogy whatever\r\nbetween the action which takes place in volcanoes and the operation of\r\nburning or combustion. Occasionally, it is true, certain inflammable\r\nsubstances are formed by the action going on within the volcano, and\r\nthese inflammable substances, taking fire, produce real flames. Such\r\nflames are, however, in almost all cases only feebly luminous, and do\r\nnot give rise to any conspicuous appearances. What is usually taken for\r\nflame during volcanic eruptions is simply, as we have already pointed\r\nout, the glowing red-hot surface of a mass of molten rock, reflected\r\nfrom a vapour-cloud hanging over it. The red glow observed over a\r\nvolcano in eruption is indeed precisely similar in its nature and\r\norigin to that which is seen above London during a night of heavy fog,\r\nand which is produced by the reflection of the gas-lights of the city\r\nfrom the innumerable particles of water-vapour diffused through the\r\natmosphere. Fires, of course, occur when the molten and incandescent\r\nmaterials poured out from a volcano come in contact with inflammable\r\nsubstances, such as forests and houses, but in these cases the\r\ncombustion is quite a secondary phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThere is another popular delusion concerning volcanic action, which it\r\nmay be necessary to refer to and to combat. From the well-known fact\r\nthat sulphur or brimstone is found abundantly in volcanic regions, the\r\npopular belief has arisen that this highly inflammable substance has\r\nsomething to do with the production of the eruptions of volcanoes. In\r\nschool-books which were, until comparatively recent years, in constant\r\nuse in this country, the statement may be found that by burying certain\r\nquantities of sulphur, iron-pyrites, and charcoal in a hole in the\r\nground, we may form a miniature volcano, and produce all the essential\r\nphenomena of a volcanic eruption. No greater mistake could possibly be\r\nmade. The chemical reactions which take place when sulphur and other\r\nsubstances are made to act upon each other differ entirely from the\r\nphenomena of volcanic action. The sulphur which is found in volcanic\r\nregions is the result and not the cause of volcanic action. Among the\r\nmost common substances emitted from volcanic vents along with the steam\r\nare the two gases, sulphurous acid and sulphuretted hydrogen. When\r\nthese two gases come into contact with one another, chemical action\r\ntakes place, and the elements contained in them--oxygen, hydrogen,\r\nand sulphur--are free to group themselves together in an entirely new\r\nfashion; the consequence of this is that water and sulphuric acid (oil\r\nof vitriol) are formed, and a certain quantity of sulphur is set free.\r\nThe water escapes into the atmosphere, the sulphuric acid combines with\r\nlime, iron, or other substances contained in the surrounding rocks,\r\nand the sulphur builds up crystals in any cavities which may happen to\r\nexist in these rocks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VOLCANIC ACTION RESEMBLES BOILING.]\r\n\r\nIf, however, careful and exact observations, like those carried on\r\nat Stromboli, compel us to reject the popular notions concerning\r\nthe supposed resemblance between volcanic action and the combustion\r\nof sulphur or other substances, they nevertheless suggest analogies\r\nwith certain other simple and well-known operations. And in pursuing\r\nthese analogies, we are led to the recognition of some admirable\r\nillustrations both of the attendant phenomena and of the true cause of\r\nvolcanic outbursts.\r\n\r\nNo one can look down on the mass of seething material in violent\r\nagitation within the fissures at the bottom of the crater of Stromboli,\r\nwithout being forcibly reminded of the appearances presented by liquids\r\nin a state of boiling or ebullition. The glowing material seems to be\r\nagitated by two kinds of movements, the one whirling or rotatory, the\r\nother vertical or up-and-down in its direction. The fluid mass in this\r\nway appears to be gradually impelled upwards, till it approaches the\r\nlips of the aperture, when vast bubbles are formed upon its surface,\r\nand to the sudden bursting of these the phenomena of the eruption are\r\ndue.\r\n\r\nNow if we take a tall narrow vessel and fill it with porridge or\r\nsome similar substance of imperfect fluidity, we shall be able, by\r\nplacing it over a fire, to imitate very closely indeed the appearances\r\npresented in the crater of Stromboli. As the temperature of the mass\r\nrises, steam is generated within it, and in the efforts of this steam\r\nto escape, the substance is set in violent movement. These movements of\r\nthe mass are partly rotatory and partly vertical in their direction; as\r\nfresh steam is generated in the mass its surface is gradually raised,\r\nwhile an escape of the steam is immediately followed by a fall of the\r\nsurface. Thus an up-and-down movement of the liquid is maintained, but\r\nas the generation of steam goes on faster than it can escape through\r\nthe viscid mass, there is a constant tendency in the latter to rise\r\ntowards the mouth of the vessel. At last, as we know, if heat continues\r\nto be applied to the vessel, the fluid contents will be forced up to\r\nits edge and a catastrophe will occur; the steam being suddenly and\r\nviolently liberated from the bubbles formed on the surface of the mass,\r\nand a considerable quantity of the material forcibly expelled from\r\nthe vessel. The suddenness and violence of this catastrophe is easily\r\naccounted for, if we bear in mind that the escaping steam acts after\r\nthe manner of a compressed spring which is suddenly released. Steam\r\nis first formed at the bottom of the vessel which is in contact with\r\nthe fire; but here it is under the pressure of the whole mass of the\r\nliquid, and moreover, the viscidity of the substance tends to retard\r\nthe union of the steam bubbles and their rise to the surface of the\r\nmass. But when the pressure is relieved by the bursting of bubbles at\r\nthe surface, the whole of the generated steam tends to escape suddenly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ESCAPE OF STEAM-BUBBLES FROM LAVA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow within the crater of Stromboli we have precisely the necessary\r\nconditions for the display of the same series of operations. In the\r\napertures at the bottom there exists a quantity of imperfectly fluid\r\nmaterials at a higher temperature, containing water entangled in its\r\nmass. As this water passes into the state of steam it tends to escape,\r\nand in so doing puts the whole mass into violent movement. When the\r\nsteam rises to the surface, bubbles are formed, and the formation of\r\nthese bubbles is promoted by the circumstance that the liquid mass,\r\nwhere exposed to the atmosphere, becomes chilled, and thereby rendered\r\nless perfectly fluid. By the bursting of these bubbles the pressure is\r\npartially relieved, and a violent escape of the pent-up steam takes\r\nplace through the whole mass. Equilibrium being thus restored, there\r\nfollows a longer or shorter interval of quiescence, during which steam\r\nis being generated and collected within the mass, and the series of\r\noperations which we have described then recommences.\r\n\r\nThere is one other consideration which must be borne in mind in\r\nconnection with this subject. It is well known that if water be\r\nsubjected to sufficiently great pressure it may be raised to a very\r\nhigh temperature and still retain its liquid condition. When this\r\npressure is removed, however, the whole mass passes at once into the\r\ncondition of steam or water-gas; and the gas thus formed at high\r\ntemperatures has a proportionably high tension. In a Papin's digester\r\nwater confined in a strong vessel is raised to temperatures far above\r\nits ordinary boiling-point, and from any opening in such a vessel the\r\nsteam escapes with prodigious violence. Now, at considerable depths\r\nbeneath the earth's surface, and under the pressure of many hundreds\r\nor thousands of feet of solid rock, water still retaining its liquid\r\ncondition may become intensely heated. When the pressure is relieved by\r\nthe formation of a crack or fissure in the superincumbent mass of rock,\r\nthe escape of the superheated steam will be of very violent character,\r\nand may be attended with the most striking and destructive results. In\r\nthe existence of high temperatures beneath the earth's surface, and the\r\npresence in the same regions of imprisoned water capable of passing\r\ninto the highly elastic gas which we call steam, we have a cause fully\r\ncompetent to produce all the phenomena which we have described as\r\noccurring at Stromboli.\r\n\r\nIt may at first sight appear that the grand and terrible displays\r\nof violence witnessed during a great volcanic eruption differ\r\nfundamentally in their character and their origin from those feeble\r\noutbursts which we are able to examine closely and analyse rigorously\r\nat Stromboli. But that such is not the case a few simple considerations\r\nwill soon convince us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STROMBOLI COMPARED WITH VESUVIUS.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Stromboli usually displays the subdued and moderate activity\r\nwhich we have been describing, yet the intensity of the action going\r\non within it is subject to considerable variation. Occasionally the\r\nviolence of the outbursts is greatly increased--the roaring of the\r\nsteam-jets may be heard for many miles around, considerable streams of\r\nincandescent liquefied rock flow down the Sciarra into the sea, and the\r\nexplosions in the crater are far more frequent and energetic, cinders\r\nand fragments of rock being scattered all over the island and the\r\nsurrounding seas.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, volcanoes like Vesuvius, which are sometimes the\r\nscene of eruptions on the very grandest scale, at others subside into a\r\ntemporary state of moderate activity quite similar in character to that\r\nwhich is the normal condition of Stromboli. Thus, shortly before the\r\ngreat eruption of Vesuvius in April 1872, a small cone was formed near\r\nthe edge of the crater, and during some months observers could watch,\r\nin ease and safety, a series of small explosions taking place, quite\r\nsimilar in their character and attendant phenomena to those which we\r\nhave described as occurring at Stromboli. French geologists are in the\r\nhabit of defining the condition of activity in a volcano by speaking\r\nof the more quiet and, regular state as the 'Strombolian stage,' and\r\nthe more violent and paroxysmal as the 'Vesuvian stage'; but the two\r\nconditions are, as we have seen, presented by the same volcano at\r\ndifferent periods, and pass into one another by the most insensible\r\ngradations.\r\n\r\nWe must now proceed to compare the grand and terrible appearances\r\npresented during a great eruption with those more feeble displays which\r\nwe have been describing, to show that in all their essential features\r\nthese different kinds of outbursts are identical with one another, and\r\nmust be referred to the action of similar causes.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic eruption which has been most carefully studied in recent\r\ntimes is that which we have already referred to as occurring at\r\nVesuvius, in the month of April 1872. With the exception, perhaps, of\r\nthat which took place in October 1822, this eruption was the grandest\r\nwhich has broken out at Vesuvius during the present century. Owing to\r\nthe circumstance of its proximity to the great city of Naples, Vesuvius\r\nhas always been the most carefully watched of all volcanoes, and in\r\nrecent years the erection of an observatory, provided with instruments\r\nfor recording the smallest subterranean tremors affecting the mountain,\r\nhas facilitated the carrying on of those continuous and minute\r\nobservations which are so necessary for exact scientific inquiry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 5. Vesuvius in Eruption, as seen from Naples, April\r\n26, 1872. (_From a photograph_)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VESUVIUS ERUPTION OF 1872.]\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of this outburst, the aid of instantaneous photography\r\nwas first made available for obtaining a permanent record of the\r\nappearances displayed at volcanic eruptions. In fig. 5 we have one of\r\nthese photographs, which was taken at 5 o'clock P.M. on April 26, 1872,\r\ntransferred to a wood-block and engraved. In examining it we feel sure\r\nthat we are not being misled by any exaggeration or error on the part\r\nof the artist. Vesuvius rises to the height of nearly 4,000 feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, and an inspection of the photograph proves that\r\nthe vapours and rock-fragments were thrown to the enormous height of\r\n20,000 feet, or nearly four miles, into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe main features of this terrifying outburst were as follows. For\r\nmore than a twelvemonth before, the activity of the forces at work\r\nwithin the mountain appeared to be gradually increasing, and the great\r\neruption commenced on April 24, attained its climax on the 26th, and\r\nbegan to die out on the following day. During the eruption the bottom\r\nof the crater was entirely broken up, and the sides of the mountain\r\nwere rent by fissures in all directions. So numerous were these\r\nfissures and cracks that liquid matter appeared to be oozing from every\r\npart of its surface, and, as Professor Palmieri, who witnessed the\r\noutburst from the observatory, expressed it, 'Vesuvius sweated fire.'\r\nOne of the fissures was of enormous size, extending from the summit to\r\nfar beyond the base of the cone; the scar left by this gigantic rent\r\nbeing plainly visible at the present day.\r\n\r\nFrom the great opening or crater at the summit, and from some of the\r\nfissures on the sides of the mountain, enormous volumes of steam rushed\r\nout with a prodigious roaring sound, the noise being so terrific that\r\nthe inhabitants of Naples, five miles off, fled from their houses\r\nand spent the night in the open streets. Although this roaring sound\r\nappeared at a distance to be continuous, yet those upon the mountain\r\ncould perceive that it was produced by detonations or explosions\r\nrapidly following one another. Each of these explosions was accompanied\r\nby the formation of a great globe of white vapour, which, rising into\r\nthe atmosphere, swelled the bulk of the vast cloud overhanging the\r\nmountain. An inspection of the photographs (see fig. 5) shows that the\r\ngreat vapour-cloud over Vesuvius was made up of the globular masses\r\nejected at successive explosions. Each of these explosive upward\r\nrushes of steam carried along with it a considerable quantity of solid\r\nfragments, and these fell in great numbers all over the surface of\r\nthe mountain, breaking the windows of the observatory, and making it\r\ndangerous to be out of doors.\r\n\r\nWe have said that lava, or molten rock, appeared to be issuing from\r\nthe very numerous cracks formed all over the flanks of the mountain.\r\nBut at three points this molten rock issued in such quantities as to\r\nform great, fiery floods, which rushed down the sides of the mountain,\r\nand flowed to a considerable distance beyond its base. The largest\r\nof these lava-floods overwhelmed and destroyed the two villages of\r\nMassa di Somma and San Sebastiano, besides many country houses in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STEAM EMITTED FROM LAVA-CURRENT.]\r\n\r\nA very marked and interesting feature exhibited by these three\r\nlava-floods was the quantity of watery vapour which they gave off\r\nduring their flow. All along their course, enormous volumes of steam\r\nwere evolved from them, as will be seen by an inspection of the\r\nphotograph. Indeed, such was the abundance and tension of the steam\r\nthus escaping from the surfaces of the lava-currents that it forced\r\nthe congealing rock up into great bubbles and blisters, and gave rise\r\nto the formation of innumerable miniature volcanoes, varying in size\r\nfrom a beehive to a cottage, some of which remained in a state of\r\nindependent activity for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nSo far, what we have described as taking place at Vesuvius, in April\r\n1872, has been only the repetition on a £Eur grander scale of the\r\nthree kinds of action which we have shown to be constantly taking\r\nplace at Stromboli; namely, the formation of cracks or fissures in the\r\nearth's surface, the escape of steam with explosive violence from these\r\nopenings, often propelling rock-fragments into the atmosphere, and the\r\noutwelling, under the influence of this compressed steam, of masses of\r\nmolten materials.\r\n\r\nThere were some other appearances presented at the great outburst at\r\nVesuvius, which do not seem at first sight to find any analogies in\r\nthe manifestations of the more feeble action continually going on at\r\nStromboli.\r\n\r\nBefore and during the great outbreak of April 1872, Vesuvius itself\r\nand the whole country round were visited with earthquake-shocks, or\r\ntremblings of the ground. The sensitive instruments in the Vesuvian\r\nObservatory showed the mountain daring the eruption to be in a constant\r\nstate of tremor. These earthquakes are not, as is commonly supposed,\r\nactual upheavings of the earth's surface, but are vibrations propagated\r\nthrough the solid materials of which the earth is built up. We cannot\r\nstamp our feet upon the ground without giving rise to such vibrations,\r\nthough our senses may not be sufficiently acute to perceive them.\r\nThe explosive escape of steam from a crack is a cause sufficiently\r\npowerful to produce a shock which is propagated and may be felt for\r\na considerable distance round. Even on Stromboli an observer at the\r\nedge of the crater may notice that each explosive outburst of steam\r\nis accompanied by a perceptible tremor of the ground, and in the case\r\nof Vesuvius the violent shocks produced by the escape of far larger\r\nvolumes of steam give rise to proportionately stronger vibrations. The\r\nnature and origin of those far more terrible and destructive shocks\r\nwhich sometimes accompany, and more frequently precede, great volcanic\r\neruptions, we shall consider in the sequel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAUSE OF LIGHTNING DURING ERUPTIONS.]\r\n\r\nAnother striking phenomenon which was exhibited in the great eruption\r\nof Vesuvius in 1872 was the vivid display of lightning accompanied\r\nby thunder. The uprushing current of steam and rock-fragments forms\r\na vertical column, but as the steam condenses it spreads out into a\r\ngreat horizontal cloud which is seen to be made up of the great globes\r\nof vapour emitted at successive explosions. When there is little or\r\nno wind the vertical column with a horizontal cloud above it bears a\r\nstriking resemblance to the stone-pine trees which form so conspicuous\r\na feature in every Neapolitan landscape. Around this column of vapour\r\nthe most vivid lightning constantly plays and adds not a little to the\r\ngrand and awful character of the spectacle of a volcanic eruption,\r\nespecially when it is viewed by night.\r\n\r\nIn the eruption of 1872 a strong wind blowing from the north-west\r\ndestroyed the usual regular appearance of this 'pine-tree appendage' to\r\nthe mountain, which is so well known to, and dreaded by the inhabitants\r\nof Naples; the cloud, as will be seen from the photograph (fig. 5,\r\n_facing_ p. 24), was blown on one side, and most of the falling\r\nfragments took the same direction.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that when high-pressure steam is allowed to escape\r\nthrough an orifice, electricity is abundantly generated by the\r\nfriction, and Sir William Armstrong's hydro-electric machine is\r\nconstructed on this principle. Every volcano in violent eruption is\r\na very efficient hydro-electric machine, and the uprushing column\r\nis in a condition of intense electrical excitation. This result is\r\nprobably aided by the friction of the solid particles as they are\r\npropelled upwards and fall back into the crater. The restoration of\r\nthe condition of electrical stability between this column and the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere is attended with the production of frequent\r\nlightning-flashes and thunder-claps, the found of the latter being\r\nusually, however, drowned in the still louder roar of the uprushing\r\nsteam-column.\r\n\r\nThe discharge of Buch large quantities of steam into the atmosphere\r\nsoon causes the latter to be saturated with watery vapour, and there\r\nfollows an excessive rainfall; long-continued rain and floods were an\r\naccompaniment of the great Vesuvian outbreak of 1872, as they have\r\nbeen of almost all great volcanic eruptions. The Italians, indeed,\r\ndread the floods which follow an eruption more than the fiery streams\r\nof lava which accompany it--for they have found the mud-streams (_lave\r\ndi fango_), formed by rain-water sweeping along the loose volcanic\r\nmaterials, to be more widely destructive in their effects than the\r\ncurrents of molten rock (_lave di fuoco_).\r\n\r\nBesides the phenomena which we have now described as accompanying a\r\ngreat volcanic outburst, many others have undoubtedly been recorded\r\nby apparently trustworthy authorities. But, in dealing with the\r\ndescriptions of these grand and terrible events, we must always be on\r\nour guard against accepting as literal facts, the statements made by\r\nwitnesses, often writing at some distance from the scene of action, and\r\nalmost always under the influence of violent excitement and terror.\r\nThe desire to administer to the universal love of the marvellous, and\r\nthe tendency to exaggeration, will usually account for many of the\r\nwonderful statements contained in such records; and, even where the\r\nwitness is accurately relating events which he thinks passed before his\r\neyes, we must remember that it is probable he may have had neither the\r\nopportunity nor the capacity for exact observation.\r\n\r\nThe more carefully we sift the accounts which have been preserved of\r\ngreat volcanic outbursts, the more are we struck by the fact that the\r\nappearances described can be resolved into a few simple operations, the\r\ntrue character of which has been distorted or disguised by the want of\r\naccurate observation on the part of the witnesses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIMILARITY OF FEEBLE AND VIOLENT ERUPTIONS.]\r\n\r\nWe are thus led to the conclusion that the grand and terrible\r\nappearances displayed at Vesuvius and other volcanoes in a state of\r\nviolent eruption do not differ in any essential respect from the\r\nphenomena which we have witnessed accompanying the miniature outbursts\r\nof Stromboli. And we are convinced, by the same considerations, that\r\nthe forces which give rise to the feeble displays in the latter case\r\nwould produce, if acting with greater intensity and violence, all the\r\nmagnificent spectacles presented in the former.\r\n\r\nIn Vesuvius and Stromboli alike, the active cause of all the phenomena\r\nexhibited is found to be the escape of steam from the midst of\r\nmasses of incandescent liquefied rock. The violence, and therefore\r\nthe grandeur and destructive effects of an eruption, depend upon the\r\nabundance and tension of this escaping steam.\r\n\r\nThere is one respect in which volcanic phenomena are especially\r\ncalculated to excite the fear and wonder of beholders--namely, in the\r\nsudden and apparently spontaneous character of their manifestations.\r\nEclipses were regarded as equally portentous with volcanic eruptions\r\ntill astronomers learned not only to explain the causes which gave\r\nrise to them, but even to predict to the second the times of their\r\noccurrence. If we were able in like manner to warn the inhabitants of\r\nvolcanic regions of the approach of a grand eruption, the fear and\r\nsuperstition with which these events are now regarded would doubtless\r\nbe in great part dispelled. The power of prediction is alike the\r\ncrucial test and the crowning triumph of a scientific theory.\r\n\r\nBut, although natural philosophers are able to assign the causes to\r\nwhich the grand operations of volcanoes are due, and also to explain\r\nall the varied appearances which accompany them, they have not as yet\r\nso far mastered the laws which govern volcanic action as to be able to\r\npredict the periods of their manifestation.\r\n\r\nThat these operations, like all others going on upon the globe, are\r\ngoverned by great natural laws we cannot for a moment doubt. And that,\r\nin all probability, more careful and exact observation and reasoning\r\nwill at some future time lead us to the recognition of these laws,\r\nevery student of nature is sanguine. But at the present time, it must\r\nbe confessed, we are very far indeed from being able to afford that\r\ncrowning proof of the truth of our theories of volcanic action which is\r\nimplied in the power of predicting the period and degree of intensity\r\nof their manifestations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ERUPTIONS AND THE INTERVALS BETWEEN THEM.]\r\n\r\nThere are, however, some observations which lead us to hope that the\r\ntime may not be far distant when we shall have so £Eur obtained a\r\nknowledge of the conditions on which volcanic action depends as to be\r\nable to form some judgment as to its manifestations in the future at\r\nany particular locality. But we must recollect that these conditions\r\naxe very numerous and complicated, and that some of them may lie almost\r\nentirely outside our sphere of observation; hence hasty attempts in\r\nthis direction, such as have recently been made, are to be deprecated\r\nby every true lover of science.\r\n\r\nConcerning the eruptions that have taken place at those volcanic\r\ncentres which have been known from a remote antiquity, we have records\r\nfrom which we can determine the intervals separating these outbursts\r\nand their relative violence. A critical examination of these records\r\nleads to the following conclusions:--\r\n\r\n(1.) A long period of quiescence is generally followed by an eruption\r\nwhich is either of long duration or of great violence.\r\n\r\n(2.) A long-continued, or very violent eruption is usually followed by\r\na prolonged period of repose.\r\n\r\n(3.) Feeble and short eruptions usually succeed one another at brief\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n(4.) As a general rule, the violence of a great eruption is inversely\r\nproportional to its duration.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that these general conclusions are in perfect harmony\r\nwith the theory that volcanic outbursts are due to the accumulation\r\nof steam at volcanic centres, and that the tension of this imprisoned\r\ngas eventually overcomes the repressing forces which tend to prevent\r\nits manifestation. Before astronomers had learnt to determine all\r\nthe conditions on which the production of eclipses depends, they had\r\nfound that these phenomena succeed one another at regular intervals.\r\nThe discovery of such astronomical cycles was a great advance in our\r\nknowledge of the heavenly bodies, and in the same way the determination\r\nof these general relations between the intensity and duration of\r\nvolcanic outbursts and the intervals of time which separate them may\r\nbe regarded as the first step towards the discovery of the laws which\r\ngovern volcanic activity.\r\n\r\nIn the actual determination of the conditions upon which the occurrence\r\nof volcanic eruptions depends, it must be confessed, however, that\r\nvery little has as yet been done. This is in part due to the fact that\r\nsome at least of these conditions lie beyond the limits of direct\r\nobservation. But it must also be admitted, on the other hand, that\r\nlittle has been as yet accomplished towards the careful and systematic\r\nobservation of those phenomena which may, and probably do, exert an\r\ninfluence in bringing about volcanic outbursts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INFLUENCE OF ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS.]\r\n\r\nIn the Lipari Islands there has prevailed a belief, from the very\r\nearliest period of history, that the feeble eruptions of Stromboli\r\nare in some way dependent upon the condition of the atmosphere.\r\nThese islands were known to the ancients as the Æolian Isles, from\r\nthe fact that they were once ruled over by a king of the name of\r\nÆolus. It seems not improbable that Æolus was gifted with natural\r\npowers of observation and reasoning far in advance of those of his\r\ncontemporaries. A careful study of the vapour-cloud which covers\r\nStromboli would certainly afford him information concerning the\r\nhygrometric condition of the atmosphere; the form and position\r\nassumed by this vapour-cloud would be a no less perfect index of the\r\ndirection and force of the wind; and, if the popular belief be well\r\nfounded, the frequence and violence of the explosions taking place\r\nfrom the crater would indicate the barometric pressure. From these\r\ndata an acute observer would be able to issue 'storm-warnings' and\r\nweather-prognostics of considerable value. In the vulgar mind, the\r\nidea of the prediction of natural events is closely bound up with that\r\nof their production; and the shrewd weather-prophet of Lipari was\r\nafter his death raised to the rank of a god, and invested with the\r\nsovereignty of the winds.\r\n\r\nWhether the popular idea that the outbursts of Stromboli are regulated\r\nby atmospheric conditions has any foundation is still open to grave\r\ndoubt. It seems to be certain, however, that during autumn and winter\r\nthe more violent paroxysms of the volcano occur, and that in summer\r\nthe action which takes place is far more regular and equable. It would\r\nbe of the greatest benefit to science if an observatory were erected\r\nbeside the crater of Stromboli, where a careful record might be kept of\r\nall atmospheric changes, and of the synchronous manifestations of the\r\nvolcanic forces.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will show that it is a by no means unreasonable\r\nsupposition that variations in atmospheric pressure may exercise a very\r\nimportant influence in bringing about volcanic outbursts. Changes in\r\nthe barometer to the extent of two inches within a very short period\r\nare not uncommon occurrences. A very simple calculation will show that\r\nthe fall of the mercury in the barometer to the extent of two inches\r\nindicates the removal of a weight of two millions of tons from each\r\nsquare mile of the earth's surface where this change takes place. Now,\r\nif we suppose, as we have good ground for doing, that under volcanic\r\nareas vast quantities of superheated water are only prevented from\r\nflashing into steam by the superincumbent pressure, a relief of this\r\npressure to the extent of two millions of tons on every square mile\r\ncould scarcely fail to produce very marked effects. The way in which\r\nexplosions in fiery coal-mines generally follow closely upon sudden\r\nfalls in the atmospheric pressure is now well known; and coal-mine\r\nexplosions and volcanic outbursts have this in common, that both\r\nresult from the sudden and violent liberation of subterranean gases.\r\nThere are not a few apparently well-authenticated accounts of volcanic\r\nand earthquake phenomena following closely on peculiar atmospheric\r\nconditions, and the whole question of the relation of the volcanic\r\nforces to atmospheric pressure, as Spallanzani himself so long ago\r\npointed out, is deserving of a most careful and rigorous investigation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUPPOSED TIDAL EFFECTS.]\r\n\r\nThere is one other consideration which has frequently been urged as\r\nworthy of especial attention, in dealing with the question of the\r\nexciting causes of volcanic outbursts. If volcanoes were, as was at one\r\ntime almost universally supposed, in direct communication with a great\r\ncentral mass of liquefied materials, or even if any large reservoirs\r\nof such liquids existed beneath volcanic districts, as others have\r\nimagined, then the different mobility of the solid and liquid portions\r\nof the earth's mass would give rise to tidal effects similar to those\r\noccurring in the surface waters of the globe. Under such circumstances,\r\nvolcanic outbursts, like the tides, would be determined by the relative\r\npositions of the sun and moon to our globe. It is certain, however,\r\nthat no very direct relation has yet been established between the\r\nlunar periods and those of volcanic outbursts, though recent close\r\nobservations upon the crater of Vesuvius, by Professor Palmieri, do\r\nseem to lend support to the view that such relations may exist.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, therefore, it must be admitted that vulcanologists\r\nhave only just commenced those series of exact and continuous\r\nobservations which are necessary to determine the conditions that\r\nregulate the appearance of volcanic phenomena. The study of the laws\r\nof volcanic action is yet in its infancy. But the establishment of\r\nobservatories on Vesuvius and Etna 18 fall of promise for the future,\r\nand when we consider the advances which have been made, during the last\r\none hundred years, in our knowledge of the true nature of volcanic\r\naction, we need not despair that the extension of the same methods\r\nof inquiry will lead to equally important results concerning the\r\nconditions which determine and the laws which govern it.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, it is no small gain to have established the fact that\r\nvolcanic phenomena, divested of all those wonderful attributes with\r\nwhich superstition and the love of the marvellous have surrounded them,\r\nare operations of nature obeying definite laws, which laws we may hope\r\nby careful observation and accurate reasoning to determine; and that\r\nthe varied appearances, presented alike in the grandest and feeblest\r\noutbursts, can all be referred to one simple cause--namely, the escape,\r\nfrom the midst of masses of molten materials, of imprisoned steam or\r\nwater-gas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE PRODUCTS OF VOLCANIC ACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Spallanzani was engaged in investigating the nature of the action\r\ngoing on at Stromboli and other Italian volcanoes, his contemporary\r\nDolomieu was laying the foundation of another important branch of\r\nvulcanology by studying the characters of the different materials of\r\nwhich volcanoes are built up. Since the publication of Dolomieu's\r\nadmirable works on the rocks of the Lipari and Ponza Islands, science\r\nhas advanced with prodigious strides. The chemist has taught us how\r\nto split up a rock into its constituent elements and to determine the\r\nproportions of these to one another with mathematical precision; the\r\nmineralogist has done much in the investigation of the characters and\r\nmode of origin of the crystalline minerals which occur in these rocks;\r\nand the microscopist has shown how the minute internal structure of\r\nthese rocks may be made clearly manifest. We shall proceed to give a\r\nsketch of the present state of knowledge obtained by these different\r\nkinds of investigations, concerning the materials which are ejected\r\nfrom volcanic vents.\r\n\r\nThe most abundant of the substances which are ejected from volcanoes\r\nis steam or water-gas, which, as we have seen, issues in prodigious\r\nquantities during every eruption. But with the steam a great number\r\nof other volatile materials frequently make their appearance. The\r\nchief among these are the add gases known as hydrochloric acid,\r\nsulphurous acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, carbonic add, and boracic acid;\r\nand with these acid gases there issue hydrogen, nitrogen, ammonia,\r\nthe volatile metals arsenic, antimony, and mercury, and some other\r\nsubstances. In considering the nature of the products which issue from\r\nvolcanic fissures, it must be remembered that many substances which\r\nunder ordinary circumstances do not exhibit marked volatility are\r\nnevertheless easily carried away in fine particles when a current of\r\nsteam is passed over them. As we shall have to point out in the sequel,\r\ndifferent volatile substances have a tendency to make their appearance\r\nat volcanic vents according as the intensity of the action going on\r\nwithin it varies.\r\n\r\nThe volatile substances issuing from volcanic fissures at high\r\ntemperatures react upon one another, and many new compounds are thus\r\nformed. We have already seen how, by the action of sulphurous acid\r\nand sulphuretted hydrogen on each other, the sulphur so common in\r\nvolcanic districts has been separated and deposited. The hydrochloric\r\nacid acts very energetically on the rocks around the vents, uniting\r\nwith the iron in them to form the yellow ferric-chloride. The rocks\r\nall round a volcanic vent are not unfrequently found coated with this\r\nyellow substance, which is almost always mistaken by casual observers\r\nfor sulphur. In many volcanoes the constant passage through the rocks\r\nof the various acid gases has caused nearly the whole of the iron,\r\nlime, and alkaline materials of the rocks to be converted into soluble\r\ncompounds known as sulphates, chlorides, carbonates, and borates; and,\r\non the removal of these by the rain, there remains a white, powdery\r\nsubstance, resembling chalk in outward appearance, but composed of\r\nalmost pure silica. There are certain cases in which travellers have\r\nvisited volcanic islands where chemical action of this kind has gone on\r\nto such an extent, that they have been led to describe the islands as\r\ncomposed entirely of chalk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GASES EMITTED FROM VOLCANOES.]\r\n\r\nSome of the substances issuing from volcanic vents, such as hydrogen\r\nand sulphuretted hydrogen, are inflammable, and when they issue at a\r\nhigh temperature, these gases burst into flame the moment that they\r\ncome into contact with the air. Hence, when volcanic fissures axe\r\nwatched at night, faint lambent flames are frequently seen playing over\r\nthem, and sometimes these flames are brilliantly coloured, through the\r\npresence of small quantities of certain metallic oxides. Such volcanic\r\nflames, however, are scarcely ever strongly luminous and, as we have\r\nalready seen, the red, glowing light which is observed over volcanic\r\nmountains in eruption is due to quite another cause. The study by the\r\naid of the spectroscope of the flames which issue from volcanic vents\r\npromises to throw much new light on the rarer materials ejected by\r\nvolcanoes. Spectroscopic observations of this kind have already been\r\ncommenced by Janssen, at Stromboli and Santorin.\r\n\r\nSome of the volatile substances issuing from volcanic vents, are at\r\nonce deposited when they come in contact with the cool atmosphere,\r\nothers form new compounds with one another and the constituents of the\r\natmosphere, while others again attack the materials of the surrounding\r\nrocks and form fresh chemical compounds with some of their ingredients.\r\nThus, there are continually accumulating on the sides and lips of\r\nvolcanic fissures deposits of sulphates, chlorides, and borates of\r\nthe alkalies and alkaline earths, with sal-ammoniac, sulphur, and the\r\noxides and sulphides of certain metals. The lips of the fissures from\r\nwhich steam and acid gases issue in volcanoes are constantly seen to\r\nbe coated with yellow and reddish-brown incrustations, consisting of\r\nmixtures, in varying proportions, of these different materials, and\r\nthese sometimes assume the form of stalactites and pendent masses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEPOSITS AROUND VOLCANIC VENTS.]\r\n\r\nSome of these products of volcanic action are of considerable\r\ncommercial value. At Vulcano regular chemical works have been\r\nestablished in the crater of the volcano, by an enterprising Scotch\r\nfirm, a great number of workmen being engaged in collecting the\r\nmaterials which are deposited around the fissures, and are renewed\r\nby the volcanic action almost as soon as they are removed. In fig.\r\n6, I have given a sketch of this singular spot, taken from the high\r\nground of the neighbouring Island of Lipari. From the village at\r\nthe foot of the volcano, where the workmen live, a zig-zag road has\r\nbeen constructed leading up the side, and down into the crater of\r\nthe volcano. On this road, workmen and mules, laden with the various\r\nvolcanic materials, may be seen constantly passing up and down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--View of Vulcano, with Vulcanello in the\r\nforeground taken from the south end of the Island of Lipari.]\r\n\r\nVulcano appears to have been frequently in a state of violent eruption\r\nduring the past 2,000 years--the last great outburst having taken place\r\nin 1786. In 1873 the activity in the crater of Vulcano suddenly became\r\nmore pronounced in character, and the workmen hastened to escape from\r\nthe dangerous spot, but, before they could do so, several of them\r\nwere severely injured by the explosions. After this outburst, which\r\ndid not prove to be of very violent character, the quantity of gases\r\nissuing from the fissures in the crater was for a time much greater\r\nthan before, and the productiveness of these great natural chemical\r\nworks was proportionately increased: but eventually the action died out\r\nalmost entirely. The chief products of Vulcano which are of commercial\r\nvalue, are sal-ammoniac, sulphur, and boracic acid. At one time it was\r\neven contemplated that great leaden chambers should be erected over the\r\nprincipal fissures at the bottom of the crater of Vulcano, in which\r\nchambers the volatile materials might be condensed and collected. The\r\nchange in the condition of the volcano has unfortunately prevented the\r\ncarrying out of this bold project.\r\n\r\nBesides the volatile substances which issue from volcanic vents,\r\nmingling with the atmosphere or condensing upon their sides, there are\r\nalso many solid materials ejected, and these may accumulate around the\r\norifices, till they build up mountains of vast dimensions, like Etna,\r\nTeneriffe, and Chimborazo. Some of these solid materials are evidently\r\nfragments of the rock-masses, through which the volcanic fissure has\r\nbeen rent; these fragments have been carried upwards by the force of\r\nthe steam-blast and scattered over the sides of the volcano. But the\r\nprincipal portion of the solid materials ejected from volcanic orifices\r\nconsists of matter which has been extruded from sources far beneath the\r\nsurface, in a highly-heated and fluid or semi-fluid condition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EJECTED ROCK-FRAGMENTS.]\r\n\r\nThe fragments torn from the sides of volcanic fissures consist of the\r\nrocks through which the eruptive forces may happen to have opened their\r\nway; pieces of sandstone, limestone, slate, granite, &c., are thus\r\nfrequently found in considerable numbers among materials which build up\r\nvolcanic mountains. Thus, some of the volcanic cones in the Eifel are\r\nvery largely made up of fragments of slate, which have been torn from\r\nthe sides of the vents by the uprushing currents of steam. At Vesuvius\r\nmasses of limestone are frequently ejected, and may be picked up all\r\nover the slopes of the mountains. These limestone-fragments frequently\r\ncontain fossils, and Professor Guiscardi, of Naples, has been able to\r\ncollect several hundred species of shells, transported thus by volcanic\r\naction from the rock-masses which form the foundation of the volcano\r\nof Vesuvius. The action of water at a high temperature, and under\r\nsuch enormous pressure as must exist beneath volcanic mountains, has\r\noften produced changes in the rocks of which fragments are ejected\r\nfrom volcanic vents. The so-called 'lava' ornaments, which are so\r\nextensively sold at Naples, are not made from the materials to which\r\ngeologists apply that name, but from the fragments of altered limestone\r\nthat have been torn from the rocks beneath the mountain, and scattered\r\nby the eruptive forces all over its sides. The chemical action of the\r\nsuperheated and highly-compressed steam on the rocks beneath volcanoes\r\nfrequently results in the formation of beautifully crystallised\r\nminerals. Such crystallised minerals abound in the rock-fragments\r\nscattered over the sides of Vesuvius and other volcanoes, both active\r\nand extinct. They have been formed in the great chemical laboratories\r\nwhich exist beneath the volcano, and have been brought to the surface\r\nby the action of the steam-jets issuing from its fissures.\r\n\r\nOf still greater interest are those materials which issue from volcanic\r\norifices in an incandescent, and often in a molten, condition, and\r\nwhich are evidently derived from sources far below the earth's surface.\r\nIt is to these materials that the name of 'lavas' is properly applied.\r\n\r\nLavas present a general resemblance to the slags and clinkers which\r\nare formed in our furnaces and brick-kilns, and consist, like them, of\r\nvarious stony substances which have been more or less perfectly fused.\r\nWhen we come to study the chemical composition and the microscopical\r\nstructure of lavas, however, we shall find that there are many respects\r\nin which they differ entirely from these artificial products.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the facts which are taught us concerning the\r\nnature and origin of lavas, by a chemical analysis of them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nOf the sixty-five or seventy chemical elements, only a very small\r\nnumber occur at all commonly in lavas. Eight elements, indeed, make\r\nup the great mass of all lavas--these are oxygen, silicon, aluminium,\r\nmagnesium, calcium, iron, sodium, and potassium. But even these\r\neight elements are present in very unequal proportions. Oxygen makes\r\nup nearly one-half the weight of all lavas. Almost all the other\r\nelements found in lavas exist in combination with oxygen, so that\r\nlavas consist entirely of what chemists call 'oxides.' This is a most\r\nremarkable circumstance, which, as we shall presently see, is of great\r\nsignificance. The metalloid silicon makes up about one-fourth of the\r\nweight of most lavas, and the metal aluminium about one-tenth. The\r\nother five elements vary greatly in their relative proportions in\r\ndifferent lavas.\r\n\r\nIn all lavas the substance which forms the greatest part of the mass\r\nis the compound of oxygen and silicon, known as silica or silicic\r\nacid. In its pure form, this substance is familiar to us as quartz, or\r\nrock-crystal and flint. Silica is present in all lavas in proportions\r\nwhich vary from one-half to four-fifths of the whole mass. Now, this\r\nsubstance, silica, has the property of forming more complex compounds\r\nby uniting with the other oxides present in lavas--namely, the oxides\r\nof aluminium, magnesium, calcium, iron, potassium, and sodium. Silica\r\nis called by chemists an _acid_, the other oxides in lavas are termed\r\n_bases_, and the compounds of silica with the bases are known as\r\n_silicates_. Hence we see that lavas are composed of a number of\r\ndifferent silicates--the silicates of aluminium, magnesium, calcium,\r\niron, potassium, and sodium.\r\n\r\nThe above statements will perhaps be made clearer by the accompanying\r\ntable from which it will be seen that lavas are compounds in varying\r\nproportions of six kinds of salts--namely, the silicates of alumina,\r\nmagnesia, lime, iron, potash, and soda.\r\n\r\nComposition of Lavas.\r\n\r\n  Elements   Binary Compounds       Salts\r\n                       Acid      Bases\r\n    { Silicon         Silica--+\r\n    {                         |\r\n  O { Aluminum                +--Alumina       Silicate of Alumina\r\n  x {                         |\r\n  y { Magnesium               +--Magnesia          \"    \"  Magnesia\r\n  g {                         |\r\n  e { Calcium                 +--Lime              \"    \"  Lime\r\n  n {                         |\r\n    { Iron                    +--Iron              \"    \"  Iron\r\n    {                         |\r\n    { Potassium               +--Potash            \"    \"  Potash\r\n    {                         |\r\n    { Sodium                  +--Soda              \"    \"  Soda\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, in some lavas the acid constituent, or silica, is present in much\r\nlarger proportions than in others. Those lavas with a large proportion\r\nof silica are called 'acid lavas,' those with a lower percentage of\r\nsilica, and therefore a higher proportion of the bases, are known as\r\nthe 'basic lavas.' It is convenient to employ the term 'intermediate\r\nlavas' for those in which the proportion of silica is lower than in the\r\nacid lavas, and the proportion of the bases is lower than in the basic\r\nlavas.\r\n\r\nThe acid lavas contain from 66 to 80 per cent, of silica; they are poor\r\nin lime, magnesia, and oxide of iron, but rich in potash and soda. The\r\nbasic lavas contain from 45 to 55 per cent, of silica; they are rich in\r\nmagnesia, lime, and oxide of iron, but poor in soda and potash. In the\r\nintermediate lavas the proportion of silica varies from 55 to 66 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nAs the basic-lavas contain a larger proportion of oxide of iron and\r\nother heavy oxides than the acid-lavas, the former have usually a\r\nhigher specific gravity than the latter; it is, indeed, possible in\r\nmost cases to distinguish between these different varieties by simply\r\nweighing them in water and in air.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIFFERENT KINDS OF LAVA.]\r\n\r\nThe basic lavas are usually of much darker colour than the add\r\nlavas--the terms acid lavas, intermediate lavas, and basic lavas\r\ncorrespond indeed pretty closely with the names trachytes, greystones\r\nand basalt, which were given to the varieties of lavas by the older\r\nwriters on volcanoes, at a time when their chemical constitution had\r\nnot been accurately studied. Fresh lavas of acid composition are\r\nusually nearly white in colour, intermediate lavas are of various\r\ntints of grey, and basic lavas nearly black. It must be remembered,\r\nhowever, that colour is one of the least persistent, and therefore\r\none of the least valuable, characters by means of which rocks can\r\nbe discriminated, and also that by exposure to the influence of the\r\natmospheric moisture the iron present in all lavas is affected, and\r\nthe lavas belonging to all classes, when weathered, assume reddish and\r\nreddish-brown tints.\r\n\r\nGeologists have devised a great number of names for the various kinds\r\nof lava which have been found occurring round volcanic vents in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, and the study of these varieties is full\r\nof interest. For our present purpose, however, it will be sufficient\r\nto state that they nearly all fall into five great groups, known as\r\nthe Rhyolites, the Trachytes, the Andesites, the Phonolites, and the\r\nBasalts. The Rhyolites are acid lavas, the Basalts are basic lavas,\r\nand the Trachytes, Andesites, and Phonolites, different kinds of\r\nintermediate lavas, distinguished by the particular minerals which they\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\nBefore we part from this subject of the classification of lavas\r\naccording to their chemical composition, it will be well to point\r\nout that there exists a small group of lavas which stand quite by\r\nthemselves, and cannot be referred to either of the classes we have\r\nindicated. They contain a smaller proportion of silica, and a much\r\nlarger proportion of magnesia and oxide of iron than the other lavas,\r\nand may be made to constitute a small sub-group, to which we may apply\r\nthe term of 'ultra-basic lavas.' Although much less widely distributed\r\nthan the other varieties, they are, in some respects, as we shall\r\npresently have to point out, of far greater interest to the geologist\r\nthan all the other kinds of lavas.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINUTE STRUCTURE OF LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to consider the facts which are brought to light\r\nconcerning the nature of lavas, when they are studied by the aid\r\nof the microscope. Although most lavas appear at first sight to be\r\nopaque substances, yet it is easy to prepare slices of them which are\r\nsufficiently thin to transmit light. In such thin transparent slices\r\nwe are able to make out, by the aid of the microscope, certain very\r\ninteresting details of structure, which afford new and important\r\nevidence bearing on the mode of origin of these rocks.\r\n\r\nHost lavas are capable of being melted by the heat of our furnaces;\r\nbut the different kinds of lava vary greatly in the degree of their\r\nfusibility. The basic lavas, or those with the smallest proportion of\r\nsilica, are usually much more easily fusible than those which contain a\r\nhigh percentage of silica, the add lavas.\r\n\r\nNow, it is a very noteworthy circumstance, that when a lava is\r\nartificially fused it assumes on cooling very different physical\r\ncharacters to those which were presented by the original rock.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the freshly-broken surface of a piece of lava, we\r\nshall, in most cases, find that it contains a great number of those\r\nregular-shaped bodies which we call crystals; in some cases these\r\ncrystals are so small as to be scarcely visible to the naked eye, in\r\nothers they may be an inch or more in length. Most lavas are thus seen\r\nto be largely made up of crystals of different minerals. The minerals\r\nwhich are usually contained in lavas are quartz, the various kinds of\r\nfelspar, augite, hornblende, the different kinds of mica, olivine, and\r\nmagnetite.\r\n\r\nBut when a piece of lava is melted in a furnace, all these crystalline\r\nminerals disappear, and the resulting product is the homogeneous\r\nsubstance which we call glass. If, as many suppose, lavas acquire the\r\nfluidity which they possess when issuing from volcanic vents as the\r\nresult of simple fusion it is strange that artificially fused lavas do\r\nnot agree more closely in character with the natural products.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of different kinds of lavas, however, will\r\nshow that they vary very greatly in character among themselves. Some\r\nlavas are as perfectly glassy in structure as those which have been\r\nartificially fused, while others contain great numbers of crystals,\r\nwhich may sometimes be of very large size.\r\n\r\nIf we prepare thin transparent slices of these different kinds of\r\nlavas, and examine them by the aid of the microscope, we shall find\r\nthat lavas are made up of two kinds of materials, a base or groundmass\r\nof a glassy character, and distinct crystals of different minerals,\r\nwhich are irregularly distributed through this glassy base, like the\r\nraisins, currants, and pieces of candied peel in a cake. In some\r\ncases the glassy base makes up the whole mass of the rock; in others,\r\nsmaller or larger numbers of crystals are seen to be scattered through\r\na glassy base; while in others again the crystals are so numerous that\r\nthe presence of an intervening glassy base or groundmass can only be\r\ndetected by the aid of the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STUDY OF LAVAS WITH THE MICROSCOPE.]\r\n\r\nIf thin slices of the glassy materials of lavas be examined with high\r\nmagnifying powers, new and interesting facts are revealed. Through\r\nthe midst of the clear glassy substance cloudy patches are seen to be\r\ndiffused; and, if we examine them with a still higher power, these\r\ncloudy patches resolve themselves into innumerable particles, some\r\ntransparent and others opaque, having very definite outlines. At the\r\nsame time fresh cloudy patches are brought into view, which can only\r\nbe resolved by yet higher powers of the microscope. In examining these\r\nnatural glasses by the aid of the microscope, we are forcibly reminded\r\nof what occurs when the 'Milky Way' and some other parts of the heavens\r\nare studied with a telescope. As the power of the instrument is\r\nincreased the nebulous patches are resolved into distinct stars, but\r\nfresh nebulous masses come into view, which are in turn resolved into\r\nstars, when higher powers of the instrument are employed.\r\n\r\nIn the Frontispiece, No. 1 illustrates the appearance presented by\r\nthese volcanic glasses when examined with a high power of a microscope.\r\nThrough a glassy base is seen a number of diffused nebulous patches,\r\nwhich are in places resolved into definite particles.\r\n\r\nThese minute particles of definite form, which the microscope has\r\nrevealed in the midst of the glassy portions of lava, have received the\r\nname of microliths, or crystallites. The study of the characters and\r\nmode of arrangement of these microliths or crystallites has in recent\r\nyears thrown much new light on the interesting problems presented by\r\nlavas.\r\n\r\nIn some glassy lavas the microliths or crystallites, instead of being\r\nindiscriminately diffused through the mass of the base or groundmass,\r\nare found to be collected together into groups of very definite form.\r\nIn No. 2 of the Frontispiece we have a section of a glassy rock in\r\nwhich the crystallites have united together, so as to build up groups\r\npresenting the most striking resemblance to fronds of ferns. Around\r\nthese groups spaces of dear glass have been left by the gathering up\r\nof the crystallites, which in other parts of the mass are seen to be\r\nequally diffused through it. In this formation of groups of microliths\r\nwe cannot but recognise the action of those crystalline forces, which\r\non frosty mornings cover our windows with a mimic vegetation composed\r\nof icy particles.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, again, the crystallites scattered through the glassy\r\nportions of lavas unite in radial groups about certain centres, and\r\nthus build up globular masses to which the name of 'sphærulites' has\r\nbeen given. No. 3 in the Frontispiece illustrates the formation of\r\nthese sphærulites.\r\n\r\nNow, a careful study of the microliths or crystallites has proved that\r\nthey are the minute elements of which those wonderfully beautiful\r\nobjects which we call crystals are built up. In some cases we can\r\nsee that the crystallites are becoming united together in positions\r\ndetermined by mathematical laws, and the group is gradually assuming\r\nthe outward form and internal structure of a crystal. In other cases\r\ncrystals may be found which are undergoing a disintegrating action,\r\nand are then seen to be made up of minute elements similar to the\r\ncrystallites or microliths of glassy rocks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CRYSTALLITES AND CRYSTALS.]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is confirmed by the fact that if we take an artificially\r\nfused lava and allow it to cool slowly, it will be found that the\r\nglassy mass into which it has resolved itself contains numerous\r\ncrystallites. If the cooling process be still further prolonged, these\r\ncrystallites will be found to have united themselves into definite\r\ngroups, and sometimes distinct crystals are formed in the mass; under\r\nthese circumstances the rock frequently loses its glassy appearance and\r\nassumes a stony character.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject, it may be mentioned that some years\r\nago a very ingenious invention was submitted to trial in the Works\r\nof the Messrs. Chance, of Birmingham. It had been suggested that if\r\ncertain lavas of easy fusibility were melted and poured into moulds,\r\nwe might thus obtain elaborately ornamented stone-work, composed of\r\nthe hardest material, without the labour of the mason. The molten rock\r\nwhen quickly cooled was found to assume the form of a black glass, but\r\nwhen very slowly cooled passed into a stony material. Unfortunately,\r\nit was found that this material did not withstand the weather like\r\nordinary building stones, and, in consequence, the manufacture had to\r\nbe abandoned.\r\n\r\nNow, the study of the products of volcanoes has led geologists to\r\nrecognise the true relations between glassy and crystalline rocks.\r\n\r\nIn the amorphous mixture of various silicates which compose a glass,\r\nchemical affinity causes the separation of certain portions of\r\ndefinite composition, and these form the microliths or elements of\r\nwhich different crystalline minerals are built up. Under the influence\r\nof the crystalline forces, there is a great shaking or agitation in\r\nthe mass, and the microliths of similar kind come together and become\r\nunited, like the fragments in Ezekiel's valley of dry bones.\r\n\r\nAlthough we cannot see this process taking place under our eyes,\r\nin a mass of lava, yet we may study specimens in which the action\r\nhas been arrested in its different stages. In order to understand\r\nthe development of an acorn into an oak-tree, it is not necessary\r\nto watch the whole series of changes in a particular case. A visit\r\nto an oak-thicket, in which illustrations of every stage of the\r\ntransformation may be found, will afford us equally certain information\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the same way by the examination of such a series of rock-sections\r\nas that represented in the Frontispiece, we may understand how, in the\r\nmidst of a mass of mixed silicates constituting a natural glass, the\r\nseparation of microliths takes place; these unite into groups which are\r\nthe skeletons of crystals, and finally, by the filling up of the empty\r\nspaces in these skeletons, complete crystals are built up. The series\r\nof operations may, however, be interrupted at any stage, and this stage\r\nwe may have the chance of studying.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GLASSY AND CRYSTALLINE LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nWe are able, as we shall show in a future chapter, to examine many\r\nrock-masses that have evidently formed the reservoirs from which\r\nvolcanoes have been supplied, and others that fill up the ducts which\r\nconstituted the means of communication between these subterranean\r\nreservoirs, and the surface of the earth. Now in these subterranean\r\nregions the lavas have been placed under conditions especially\r\nfavourable for the action of the crystalline forces--they must have\r\ncooled with extreme slowness, and they must have been under an enormous\r\npressure, produced in part by the weight of the superincumbent rocks,\r\nand in part by the expansive force of the imprisoned steam. We are not,\r\ntherefore, surprised to find that in these subterranean regions, the\r\nlavas, while retaining the same chemical composition, have assumed a\r\nmuch more perfectly crystalline condition. In some cases, indeed, the\r\nwhole rock has become a mass of crystals without any base or groundmass\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the Frontispiece will illustrate this perfect\r\ngradation from the glassy to the crystalline condition of lavas. No.\r\n1 represents a glass through which microliths or crystallites of\r\ndifferent dimensions and character are diffused. In Nos. 2 and 3,\r\nthese crystallites have united to form regular groups. In No. 4, which\r\nmay be taken as typical of the features presented by most lavas, we\r\nhave a glassy groundmass containing microliths (a 'crypto-crystalline\r\nbase'), through which distinct crystals are distributed. Nos. 5 and 6\r\nillustrate the characters presented by lavas which have consolidated\r\nat considerable depths beneath the surface; in the former we have\r\na mans of small crystals (a 'micro-crystalline base') with larger\r\ncrystals scattered through it; while the latter is entirely made up of\r\nlarge crystals without any trace of a base or groundmass.\r\n\r\nNow, as all lavas are found sometimes assuming the glassy condition at\r\nthe surface, so when seen in the masses which have consolidated with\r\nextreme slowness, and under great pressure, in subterranean regions,\r\nthe same materials are found in the condition of a rock which is built\r\nup entirely of crystals. Chemists have found that artificial mixtures\r\nof silicates in which soda and potash are present in considerable\r\nquantities, have a great tendency to assume the glassy condition on\r\ncooling from a state of fusion, and glass manufacturers are always\r\ncareful to use considerable proportions of the alkalis as ingredients,\r\nin making glass. It is found, in like manner, that those lavas which\r\ncontain the largest portion of the silicates of soda and potash (the\r\n'acid lavas') most frequently assume the condition of a natural glass.\r\n\r\nGeologists have given distinct names to the glassy and the perfectly\r\ncrystalline conditions of the different kinds of lavas, the glassy\r\nvarieties being found in masses which have cooled rapidly near the\r\nsurface, and the crystalline varieties in masses which have cooled\r\nslowly at great depths. The names of these two conditions of the five\r\ngreat classes into which we have divided lavas are as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HIGHLY CRYSTALLINE IGNEOUS ROCKS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Crystalline Forms._     _Lavas._    _Glassy Forms._\r\n\r\n  Granite                 Rhyolite  }\r\n  Syenite                 Trachyte  }              Obsidian.\r\n  Diorite                 Andesite  }\r\n  Miascite                Phonolite }\r\n  Gabbro                  Basalt                   Tachylyte.\r\n\r\nAs vitreous rocks have little in their general appearance to\r\ndistinguish them from one another, the glassy forms of the first\r\nfour classes of lava have not hitherto received distinct names, but\r\nhave been confounded together under the name of obsidian. If we\r\ndetermine the specific gravities of rocks having the same composition\r\nbut different structures, we shall find that they become heavier in\r\nproportion as the crystalline structure is developed in them. Thus\r\ngabbro is heavier, but tachylyte is lighter than basalt, bulk for bulk,\r\nthough all have the same chemical composition.\r\n\r\nNor are the crystals contained in lavas less worthy of careful study,\r\nby the aid of the microscope, than the more or less glassy groundmass\r\nin which they are embedded. Mr. Sorby has shown that the crystals found\r\nin lavas, exhibit many interesting points of difference from those\r\nwhich separate out in the midst of a mass of the same rock, when it has\r\nbeen artificially melted and slowly cooled. There are other facts which\r\nalso point to the conclusion that, while the glassy groundmass of lavas\r\nmay have been formed by cooling from a state of fusion, the larger and\r\nwell-formed crystals in these lavas must have been formed under other\r\nand very different conditions.\r\n\r\nThe larger crystals in lavas exhibit evidence of having been slowly\r\nbuilt up in the midst of a glassy mass, containing crystallites and\r\nsmall crystals. We can frequently detect evidence of the interruptions\r\nwhich have occurred in the growth of these crystals in the concentric\r\nzones of different colour or texture which they exhibit; and portions\r\nof the glassy base or groundmass are often found to have been caught up\r\nand enclosed in these crystals during their growth.\r\n\r\nBut when we find, as in the porphyritic pitchstones, a glassy base\r\ncontaining only minute crystallites, through which large and perfectly\r\nformed crystals are distributed, we can scarcely doubt that the minute\r\ncrystallites and the larger crystals have separated from the base under\r\nvery different conditions. This is indicated by the bet that we detect\r\nin these cases no connecting links between the embryo microliths and\r\nthe perfect crystals; and a confirmation of the conclusion is seen in\r\nthe circumstance that many of the crystals are found to have suffered\r\ninjury as if from transport, their edges and angles being rounded and\r\nabraded, and portions being occasionally broken off from them.\r\n\r\nHence we are led to conclude that the larger crystals in lavas were\r\nprobably separated from the amorphous mass in the subterranean\r\nreservoirs beneath the volcano, and were carried up to the surface in\r\nthe midst of the liquefied glassy material which forms the groundmass\r\nof lavas. When we come to examine these crystals more closely, we find\r\nthat certain very curious phenomena are exhibited by them which lend\r\npowerful support to this conclusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Minute Cavities, containing Liquids, in the\r\nCrystals of Rocks.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LIQUID CAVITIES IN CRYSTALS.]\r\n\r\nIt is found convenient by geologists to designate those rocks which\r\nhave consolidated in deep-seated portions of the earth's crust\r\nas Platonic Rocks, confining the name of Volcanic rocks to those\r\nconsolidating At the surface; but Plutonic and Volcanic Rocks shade\r\ninto one another by the most insensible gradations.\r\n\r\nWhen the crystals embedded in granitic rocks, and in some lavas, are\r\nexamined with the higher powers of the microscope, they are frequently\r\nseen to contain great numbers of excessively minute cavities. Each of\r\nthese cavities resembles a small spirit-level, having a quantity of\r\nliquid and a bubble of gas within it. In fig. 7 we have given a series\r\nof drawings of these cavities in crystals as seen under a high power\r\nof the microscope. In No. 1 a group of such cavities is represented,\r\none of which is full of liquid, while two others are quite empty; the\r\nremaining cavities all contain a liquid with a moving bubble of gas.\r\nIn No. 2 two larger cavities are shown, containing a liquid and a\r\nbubble of gas; and it will be seen from these how varied in form these\r\ncavities sometimes are. In Nos. 3, 4 and 6 the liquid in the cavities\r\ncontains, besides the bubbles, several, minute crystals; and in No. 6\r\nwe have a cavity containing two liquids and a bubble.\r\n\r\nIn the largest of such cavities the bubble is seen to change its\r\nplace so as always to lie at the upper side of the cavity, when the\r\nposition of the latter is altered, just as in a spirit-level. But in\r\nthe smallest cavities the bubbles appear to be endowed with a power of\r\nspontaneous movement; like imprisoned creatures trying to escape, these\r\nbubbles are seen continually oscillating from side to side and from end\r\nto end of the cavities which enclose them. In fig. 8 a minute cavity\r\ncontaining a liquid and bubble is shown, the path pursued by the latter\r\nin its wonderful gyrations being indicated by the dark line. These\r\ncavities are exceedingly minute, and so numerous that in some crystals\r\nthere must be millions of them present; indeed, in certain cases, as\r\nwe increase the magnifying power of our microscopes, new and smaller\r\ncavities continually become visible. It has been estimated that in some\r\ninstances the number of these minute liquid-cavities in the crystals of\r\nrocks amounts to from one thousand millions to ten thousand millions in\r\na cubic inch of space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8--Minute Liquid-cavity in a Crystal, with a moving\r\nBubble. (The path of the bubble is indicated by the dark line.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NATURE OF LIQUIDS IN CAVITIES.]\r\n\r\nWhat is the nature of the liquids which are thus imprisoned in these\r\ncavities contained in the crystals of lavas and granites? Careful\r\nexperiments have given a conclusive answer to this question. In many\r\ncases the liquid is water, usually containing considerable quantities\r\nof saline matter dissolved in it. Sometimes the saline matters are\r\npresent in such abundance that they cannot all pass into solution, but\r\ncrystallise out, as in fig. 7--Nos. 3, 4, 5--where cubic crystals of\r\nthe chlorides of sodium and potassium are seen floating in the liquid;\r\nin other cases the liquid is a hydrocarbon like the mineral oil which\r\nis present in great abundance in deep-seated rocks in many parts of the\r\nglobe. But in some other cases the liquid contained in the cavities\r\nof crystals is found to be one which could scarcely be anticipated\r\nto occur under such circumstances--the gas known as carbonic add,\r\nwhich under extreme pressure can be reduced to a liquid condition. In\r\ncavities containing liquefied carbonic acid, if the rock be warmed up\r\nto 86° or 90° Fahrenheit the bubble suddenly vanishes, sometimes with\r\nan appearance like ebullition or boiling, as represented in fig. 9.\r\nNow the temperature which we have indicated is the 'critical point' of\r\ncarbonic acid, and above that temperature it cannot exist in a liquid\r\ncondition, however great may be the pressure to which it is subjected.\r\nThe liquid has been converted into a gas which completely fills the\r\ncavity. The carbonic acid in the cavities of crystals has frequently\r\nbeen isolated and its nature placed beyond doubt by spectroscopic and\r\nordinary chemical tests.\r\n\r\nThe presence of these liquids in the cavities of crystals clearly\r\nproves that the latter must have been formed under enormous pressure--a\r\npressure sufficiently great to reduce, not only steam, but also\r\nvolatile hydrocarbons and even gaseous carbonic acid, to the bulk of a\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Cavity in Crystal containing Carbonic-Acid Gas\r\nat a temperature of 86° F., and passing from the liquid to the gaseous\r\ncondition.]\r\n\r\nSuch conditions of enormous pressure we may infer to exist in the\r\ndeep-seated reservoirs beneath volcanoes, where, besides the weight\r\nof the superincumbent rock-masses, we have the compressing force of\r\ngreat quantities of elastic vapour held in confinement. The crystals of\r\nwhich granitic rocks are entirely built up exhibit clear evidence of\r\nhaving been all formed under these conditions of enormous pressure. The\r\nglassy base or groundmass of lavas, on the other hand, presents all the\r\ncharacters of materials that have cooled from a state of fusion. Most\r\nlavas consist in part of crystals, exhibiting fluid-cavities like those\r\npresent in granite, and in part of a base, which has evidently been\r\nformed by the cooling of a fused mass. We are therefore justified in\r\nconcluding that the crystals have been formed in subterranean recesses,\r\nand that the groundmass or base has consolidated at the surface. The\r\nbearing of these conclusions upon some of the great problems presented\r\nby volcanoes we shall have occasion to point out in the sequel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAUSE OF MOVEMENT OF BUBBLES.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting inquiries suggested by the study of\r\nthe liquid-cavities in volcanic rocks is that of the cause of the\r\napparently spontaneous movement of the bubbles which we have described\r\nas taking place in some of the smaller of them. The ingenious\r\nexperiments of Mr. Noel Hartley have suggested to Professor Stokes\r\nan explanation which is probably the true one. It appears that these\r\nminute globes of vapour are in such a state of unstable equilibrium as\r\nto be affected by the smallest changes of temperature, and that the\r\nvariations in the heat of the atmosphere, due to currents of air and\r\nthe movement of warm or cold bodies through it, are sufficient to cause\r\nthe oscillation of these sensitively poised bubbles.\r\n\r\nThe short account which we have been able to give in the foregoing\r\npages of the researches that have been carried on concerning the nature\r\nof the materials ejected from volcanoes will serve to show that these\r\ninvestigations have already made known many facts of great interest,\r\nand that the farther pursuit of them is full of the highest promise.\r\nTo the scientific worker no subject is too vast for his research, no\r\nobject so minute as to be unworthy of his most patient study. In some\r\nof our future inquiries concerning the nature of volcanic action, we\r\nshall be led to an investigation of the phenomena displayed in the sun,\r\nmoon, comets and other great bodies of the universe; but another road\r\nto truths of the same grandeur and importance is found, as we have\r\nseen, in an examination of the mode of development of crystallites, and\r\na study of the materials contained in the microscopic cavities of the\r\nminutest crystals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MATERIALS EJECTED FROM VOLCANIC VENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe escape of great quantities of steam and other gases from the midst\r\nof a mass of fluid or semi-fluid lava gives rise to the formation of\r\nvast quantities of froth or foam upon its surface. This froth or foam,\r\nwhich is formed upon the surface of lava by the escape of gaseous\r\nmatters from within it, is made up of portions of the lava distended\r\ninto vesicles, in the same way that bubbles are formed on the surface\r\nof water. It bears precisely the same relation to the liquid mass of\r\nlava that the white crest of foam upon an advancing wave does to the\r\nsea-water, from the bubbles of which it is formed.\r\n\r\nThis froth upon the surface of lavas varies greatly in character\r\naccording to the nature of the material from which it is formed. In\r\nthe majority of cases the lavas consist, as we have seen, of a mass\r\nof crystals floating in a liquid magma, and the distension of such a\r\nmass by the escape of steam from its midst gives rise to the formation\r\nof the rough cindery-looking material to which the name of 'scoria'\r\nis applied. But when the lava contains no ready-formed crystals, but\r\nconsists entirely of a glassy substance in a more or less perfect state\r\nof fusion, the liberation of steam gives rise to the formation of the\r\nbeautiful material known as 'pumice.' Pumice consists of a mass of\r\nminute glass bubbles; these bubbles have not usually, however, retained\r\ntheir globular form, but have been elongated in one direction through\r\nthe movement of the mass while it was still in a plastic state.\r\n\r\nThe steam frequently escapes from lava with such violence that the\r\nfroth or scum on its surface is broken up and scattered in all\r\ndirections, as the foam crests of waves are dispersed by the wind\r\nduring a storm. In this way fragments of scoria or pumice are often\r\nthrown to the height of many hundreds or thousands of feet into the\r\natmosphere, as we have seen is the case at Stromboli and Vesuvius.\r\nIndeed, during violent eruptions, a continuous upward discharge of\r\nthese fragments is maintained, the ragged cindery masses hurtling one\r\nanother in the atmosphere, as they are shot perpendicularly upwards\r\nto an enormous height and fall back into the vent; or they may rise\r\nobliquely and describe curves so as to descend outside the orifice from\r\nwhich they were ejected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FINENESS OF VOLCANIC DUST.]\r\n\r\nDuring their upward discharge and downward fall, the cindery fragments\r\nare by attrition continually reduced to smaller dimensions. The noise\r\nmade by these fragments, as they strike against one another in\r\nthe air during their rise and fall, is one of the most noteworthy\r\naccompaniments of volcanic eruptions. It has been noticed that in many\r\ncases there is a constant diminution in the size of the fragments\r\nejected during a volcanic outburst, this being doubtless due to the\r\nfriction of the masses as they are ejected and re-ejected from the\r\nvent. Thus it is related by Mr. Poulett Scrope, who watched the\r\nVesuvian eruption of 1822, which lasted for nearly a month, that\r\nduring the earlier stages of the outburst fragments of enormous size\r\nwere thrown out of the crater, but by constant re-ejection these were\r\ngradually reduced in size, till at last only the most impalpable dust\r\nissued from the vent. This dust filled the atmosphere, producing in\r\nthe city of Naples 'a darkness that might be felt,' and so excessively\r\nfinely divided was it, that it penetrated into all drawers, boxes, and\r\nthe most closely fastened receptacles, filling them completely. Mr.\r\nWhymper relates that, while standing on the summit of Chimborazo, he\r\nwitnessed an eruption of Cotopaxi, which is distant more than fifty\r\nmiles from the former mountain. The fine volcanic dust fell in great\r\nquantities around him, and he estimated that no less than two millions\r\nof tons must have been ejected during this slight outburst. Professor\r\nBonney has examined this volcanic dust from Cotopaxi, and calculates\r\nthat it would take from 4,000 to 25,000 particles to make up a grain in\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nVarious names have been given by geologists to the fragments ejected\r\nfrom volcanic vents, which, as we have seen, differ greatly in their\r\ndimensions and other characters. Sometimes masses of more or less\r\nfluid lava are flung bodily to a great height in the atmosphere.\r\nDuring their rise and fall these masses are caused to rotate, and in\r\nconsequence assume a globular or spheroidal form. The water imprisoned\r\nin these masses, during their passage through the atmosphere, tends to\r\nexpand into steam, and they become more or less completely distended\r\nwith bubbles. Such masses, which sometimes assume very regular and\r\nstriking forms, are known as 'volcanic bombs.' Many volcanic bombs have\r\na solid nucleus of refractory materials. The large, rough, angular,\r\ncindery-looking fragments are termed 'scoriæ.' When reduced to the\r\ndimensions of a marble or pea they are usually called by the Italian\r\nname of 'lapilli.' The still finer materials are known as volcanic sand\r\nand dust.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two names which are frequently applied to these\r\nfragmentary materials ejected from volcanoes, which are perhaps\r\nliable to give rise to misconception. These are the terms 'cinders'\r\nand 'ashes.' It must be remembered that the scoriæ or cindery-looking\r\nmasses are not, like the cinders of our fires, the product of the\r\npartial combustion of a material containing inflammable gases, but are,\r\nlike the clinkers of furnaces and brick-kilns, portions of partially\r\nvitrified and fused rock distended by gases. So, too, volcanic ashes\r\nonly resemble the ashes of our grates in being very finely divided;\r\nthey are not, like the latter, the incombustible residue of a mass\r\nwhich has been burnt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VOLCANIC BOMBS AND PELE'S HAIR.]\r\n\r\nThe glassy lavas, when distended by escaping gases, give rise to the\r\nformation of pumice, the white colour of which, as in the case of the\r\nfoam of a wave, is due to the reflection of a portion of the light in\r\nits frequent passage from one medium to another--in this case from\r\nair to glass, and from glass to air. The volcanic bombs formed from\r\nglassy lavas are often of especially beautiful and regular forms.\r\nSometimes the passage of steam through a mass of molten glass produces\r\nlarge quantities of a material resembling spun glass. Small particles\r\nor shots of the glass are carried into the air and leave behind them\r\nthin, glassy filaments like a tail. At the volcano of Kilauea in Hawaii\r\nthis filamentous volcanic glass is abundantly produced, and is known\r\nas 'Pele's Hair'--Pele being the name of the goddess of the mountain.\r\nBirds' nests are sometimes found composed of this beautiful material.\r\nIn recent years an artificial substance similar to this Pele's hair\r\nhas been extensively manufactured by passing jets of steam through the\r\nmolten slag of iron-furnaces; it resembles cotton-wool, but is made up\r\nof fine threads of glass, and is employed for the packing of boilers\r\nand other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe very finely-divided volcanic dust is often borne to enormous\r\ndistances from the volcano out of which it has been ejected. The force\r\nof the steam-current carrying the fragments into the atmosphere is\r\noften so great that they rise to the height of several miles above\r\nthe mountain. Here they may actually pass into the upper currents of\r\nthe atmosphere and be borne away to the distance of many hundreds\r\nor thousands of miles. Hence it is not an unusual circumstance for\r\nvessels at sea to encounter at great distances from land falling\r\nshowers of this finely divided, volcanic dust. We sometimes meet with\r\nthis far-travelled, volcanic dust under very unexpected circumstances.\r\nThus, in the spring of 1875 I had occasion to visit Prof. Vom Rath of\r\nBonn, who showed me a quantity of fine volcanic dust which had during\r\nthe past winter fallen in considerable quantities in certain parts\r\nof Norway. This dust, upon microscopic examination, proved to be so\r\nsimilar to what was known to be frequently ejected from the Icelandic\r\nvolcanoes that a strong presumption was raised that volcanic outbursts\r\nhad been going on in that island. On returning to England I found that\r\nthe first steamer of the season had just reached Leith from Iceland,\r\nbringing the intelligence that very violent eruptions had taken place\r\nduring the preceding months.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DISPERSION OF PUMICE AND VOLCANIC DUST.]\r\n\r\nThis finely-divided volcanic dust is thus carried by the winds and\r\nspread over every part of the ocean. Everyone is familiar with the\r\nfact that pumice floats upon water; this it does, not because it is a\r\nmaterial specifically lighter than water, but because cavities filled\r\nwith air make up a great part of its bulk. If we pulverise pumice, we\r\nfind the powder sinks readily in water, but the rock in its natural\r\ncondition floats for the same reason that an iron ship does--because\r\nof the air-chambers which it encloses. When this pumice is ejected from\r\na volcano and falls into a river or the ocean, it floats for a long\r\ntime, till decomposition causes the breaking down of the thin glassy\r\npartitions between the air chambers, and causes the admission of water\r\ninto the latter, by which means the whole mass gets water-logged. Near\r\nthe Liparis and other volcanic islands the sea is sometimes covered\r\nwith fragments of pumice to such an extent that it is difficult for a\r\nboat to make progress through it, and the same substance is frequently\r\nfound floating in the open ocean and is cast up on every shore.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1878 masses of floating pumice were reported as\r\nexisting in the vicinity of the Solomon Isles, and covering the surface\r\nof the sea to such extent that it took ships three days to force their\r\nway through them. Sometimes these masses of pumice accumulate in such\r\nquantities along coasts that it is difficult to determine the position\r\nof the shore within a mile or two, as we may land and walk about on\r\nthe great floating raft of pumice. Now, recent deep-sea soundings,\r\ncarried on in the 'Challenger' and other vessels, have shown that the\r\nbottom of the deepest portion of the ocean, far away from the land, is\r\ncovered with these volcanic materials which have been carried through\r\nthe air or floated on the surface of the ocean. To these deeper parts\r\nof the ocean no sediments carried down by the rivers are borne, and the\r\nremains of calcareous organisms are, in these abysses, soon dissolved;\r\nunder such conditions, therefore, almost the only material accumulating\r\non the sea bottom is the ubiquitous wind- and wave-borne volcanic\r\nproducts. These particles of volcanic dust and fragments of pumice by\r\ntheir disintegration give rise to a clayey material, and the oxidation\r\nof the magnetite, which all lavas contain, communicates to the mass a\r\nreddish tint. This appears to be the true origin of those masses of\r\n'red-clay' which, according to recent researches, are found to cover\r\nall the deeper parts of the ocean, but which probably attain to no\r\ngreat thickness.\r\n\r\nBut while some portion of the materials ejected from volcanoes may\r\nthus be carried by winds and waves, so as to be dispersed over every\r\npart of the land and the ocean-bed, another, and in most cases by far\r\nthe largest, portion of these ejections falls around the volcanic vent\r\nitself. It is by the constant accumulation of these ejected materials\r\nthat such great mountain masses as Etna, Teneriffe, Fusiyama, and\r\nChimborazo have been gradually built up around centres of volcanic\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThere are cases in which the formation of volcanic mountains on a small\r\nscale has actually been observed by trustworthy witnesses. There are\r\nother cases in which volcanic mountains of larger size can be shown\r\nto have increased in height and bulk by the fall upon their sides and\r\nsummits of fragmentary materials ejected from the volcanic vent. In all\r\ncases the examination of these mountain-masses leads to the conclusion\r\nthat they are entirely built up of just such materials as we constantly\r\nsee thrown out of volcanoes during eruption.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS.]\r\n\r\nThus we are led to the conclusion that all volcanic mountains are\r\nnothing but heaps of materials ejected from fissures in the earth's\r\ncrust, the smaller ones having been formed during a single volcanic\r\noutburst, the larger ones being the result of repeated eruptions from\r\nthe same orifice which may, in some cases, have continued in action for\r\ntens or hundreds of thousands of years.\r\n\r\nNo observer has done such useful work in connection with the study of\r\nthe mode of formation of volcanic mountains as our countryman, Sir\r\nWilliam Hamilton, who was ambassador at Naples from 1764 to 1800, and\r\nmade the best possible use of his opportunities for examining the\r\nnumerous volcanoes in Southern Italy.\r\n\r\nA little to the west of the town of Puzzuoli on the Bay of Naples there\r\nstands a conical hill rising to the height of 440 feet above the level\r\nof the Mediterranean, and covering an area more than half a mile in\r\ndiameter. Now we have the most conclusive evidence that in ancient\r\ntimes no such hill existed on this site, which was partly occupied by\r\nthe Lucrine Lake, and the fact is recognised in the name which the hill\r\nbears, that of Monte Nuovo, or the 'New Mountain.' See fig. 10.\r\n\r\nSir William Hamilton rendered admirable service to science by\r\ncollecting all the contemporary records relating to this interesting\r\ncase, and he was able to prove, by the testimony of several\r\nintelligent and trustworthy witnesses, that during the week following\r\nthe 29th of September, 1538, this hill had gradually been formed of\r\nmaterials ejected from a volcanic vent which had opened upon this site.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Monte Nuovo (440 ft. high) on the shores of the\r\nBay of Naples.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HISTORY OF THE FORMATION OF MONTE NUOVO.]\r\n\r\nThe records collected by Hamilton with others which have been\r\ndiscovered since his death prove most conclusively the following\r\nfacts. During more than two years, the country round was affected\r\nby earthquakes, which gradually increased in intensity and attained\r\ntheir climax in the month of September 1538; on the 27th and 28th of\r\nthat month these earthquake shocks are said to have been felt almost\r\ncontinuously day and night. About 8 o'clock on the morning of the 29th,\r\na depression of the ground was noticed on the site of the future hill,\r\nand from this depression, water, which was at first cold and afterwards\r\ntepid, began to issue. Four hours afterwards the ground was seen to\r\nswell up and open, forming a gaping fissure, within which incandescent\r\nmatter was visible. From this fissure numerous masses of stone, some of\r\nthem 'as large as an ox,' with vast quantities of pumice and mud, were\r\nthrown: up to a great height, and these falling upon the sides of the\r\nvent formed a great mound. This violent ejection of materials continued\r\nfor two days and nights, and on the third day a very considerable hill\r\nwas seen to have been built up by the falling fragments, and this hill\r\nwas climbed by some of the eye-witnesses of the eruption. The next day\r\nthe ejections were resumed, and many persons who had ventured on the\r\nhill were injured, and several killed by the falling stones. The later\r\nejections were however of less violence than the earlier ones, and seem\r\nto have died out on the seventh or eighth day after the beginning of\r\nthe outburst. The great mass of this considerable hill would appear,\r\naccording to the accounts which have been preserved, to have been built\r\nup by the materials which were ejected during two days and nights.\r\n\r\nMonte Nuovo is a hill of truncated conical form, which rises to the\r\nheight of 440 feet above the waters of the Mediterranean, and is now\r\ncovered with thickets of stone-pine. The hill is entirely made up\r\nof volcanic scoriæ, lapilli, and dust, and the sloping sides have\r\nevidently been produced by these fragmentary materials sliding over one\r\nanother till they attained the angle of rest; just as happens with the\r\nearth and stones tipped from railway-waggons during the construction of\r\nan embankment. In the centre of this conical hill is a vast circular\r\ndepression, with steeply sloping sides, which is of such depth that its\r\nbottom is but little above the sea-level. This cup-shaped depression is\r\nthe 'crater' of the volcano, and it has evidently been formed by the\r\nexplosive action which has thrown out the materials immediately above\r\nthe vent, and caused them to be accumulated around it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Map of the district around Naples, showing\r\nMonte Nuovo and the surrounding volcanoes of older date.]\r\n\r\nThe district lying to the west of Naples, in which the Monte Nuovo is\r\nsituated, contains a great number of hills, all of which present a most\r\nstriking similarity to that volcano. All these hills are truncated\r\ncones, with larger or smaller circular depressions at their summits,\r\nand they axe entirely composed of volcanic scoriæ, lapilli, and dust.\r\nSome of these hills are of considerably larger dimensions than the\r\nMonte Nuovo, while others are of smaller size, as shown in the annexed\r\nmap, fig. 11. No stranger visiting the district, without previous\r\ninformation upon the subject, would ever suspect the fact that, while\r\nall the other hills of the district have existed from time immemorial,\r\nand are constantly mentioned in the works of Greek and Roman writers,\r\nthis particular hill of Monte Nuovo came into existence less than 350\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OLDER VOLCANOES OF THE CAMPI PHLEGRÆI.]\r\n\r\nThe evidently fused condition of the materials of which these hills are\r\nbuilt up is a dear sign of the volcanic action which has taken place\r\nin it; and this feet was so fully recognised by the ancients that they\r\ncalled the district the Campi Phlegræi, or 'the Burning Fields,' and\r\nregarded one of the circular depressions in it as the entrance to Hades.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for anyone to examine this district without being\r\nconvinced that all the numerous cones and craters which cover it\r\nhave been formed by the same agency as that by which Monte Nuovo was\r\nproduced. We have shown that there is the most satisfactory historical\r\nevidence as to what that agency was.\r\n\r\nNow volcanic cones with craters in their centres occur in great numbers\r\nin many parts of the earth's surface. In some districts, like the\r\nAuvergne, the Catacecaumene in Asia Minor, and certain parts of New\r\nZealand, these volcanic cones occur by hundreds and thousands. In some\r\ninstances, these volcanic cones have been formed in historic times,\r\nbut in the great majority of cases we can only infer their mode of\r\norigin from their similarity to others of which the formation has been\r\nwitnessed.\r\n\r\nMost of the smaller volcanic hills, with their craters, have been\r\nthrown up during a single eruption from a volcanic fissure; but, as\r\nHamilton conclusively proved, the grandest volcanic mountains must\r\nhave been produced by frequent repetitions of similar operations upon\r\nthe same site. For not only are these great volcanic piles found to be\r\nentirely composed of materials which have evidently been ejected from\r\nvolcanic vents, but, when carefully watched, such mountains are found\r\nundergoing continual changes in form, by the addition of materials\r\nthrown out from the vent, and falling upon their sides.\r\n\r\nThis fact will be well illustrated by a comparison of the series of\r\ndrawings of the summit of Vesuvius which were made by Sir William\r\nHamilton in 1767, and which we have copied in fig. 12. During the\r\nearlier months of that year the summit of the mountain was seen to be\r\nof truncated form, a great crater having been originated by the violent\r\noutbursts of the preceding year. This condition of the mountain-top\r\nis represented in the first figure of the series. The drawing made by\r\nHamilton, on July 8, shows that not only was the outer rim of the great\r\ncrater being modified in form by the fall of materials upon it, but\r\nthat in the centre of the crater a small cone was being gradually built\r\nup by the quiet ejections which were taking place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Outlines of the Summit of Vesuvius during the\r\nEruption of 1767.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHANGES IN FORM OF VESUVIUS.]\r\n\r\nIf we compare the drawings made at successive dates, we shall find that\r\nthe constant showers of falling materials were not only raising the\r\nedge of the great crater but were at the same time increasing the size\r\nof the small cone inside the crater. By the end of October the small\r\ncone had grown to such an extent that its sides were confluent with\r\nthose of the principal cone, which had thus entirely lost its truncated\r\nform and been raised to a much greater height. The comparison of these\r\ndrawings will be facilitated by the dotted lines, which represent\r\nthe outline of the top of the mountain at the preceding observation;\r\nso that the space between the dotted and the continuous line in each\r\ndrawing shows the extent to which the bulk of the cone had increased in\r\nthe interval between two observations.\r\n\r\nBut, although the general tendency of the action going on at volcanic\r\nmountains is to increase their height and bulk by the materials falling\r\nupon their summits and aides, it must be remembered that this action\r\ndoes not take place by any means continuously and regularly. Not only\r\nare there periods of rest in the activity of the volcano, during which\r\nthe rain and winds may accomplish a great deal in the way of crumbling\r\ndown the loose materials of which volcanic mountains are largely built\r\nup, but sudden and violent eruptions may in a very short time undo the\r\nslow work of years by blowing away the whole summit of the mountain at\r\nonce. Thus, before the great eruption of 1822, the cone of Vesuvius, by\r\nthe almost constant ejection of ashes during several years, had been\r\nraised to the height of more than 4,000 feet above the level of the\r\nsea; but by the terrible outburst which then took place the cone was\r\nreduced in height by 400 feet, and a vast crater, which had a diameter\r\nof nearly a mile, and a depth of nearly 1,000 feet (see fig. 13), was\r\nformed at the top of the mountain. The enormous quantity of material\r\nthus removed was either distributed over the flanks of the mountain,\r\nor, when reduced to a finely comminuted condition, was carried by the\r\nwind to the distance of many miles, darkening the air, and coating the\r\nsurface of the ground with a thick covering of dust.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Crater of Vesuvius formed during the eruption\r\nin 1822. (It was nearly 1 mile in diameter and 1,000 ft. deep.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EARLY HISTORY OF VESUVIUS.]\r\n\r\nThe volcano of Vesuvius, although of somewhat insignificant dimensions\r\nwhen compared with the grander volcanic mountains of the globe,\r\npossesses great interest for the student of Vulcanology, inasmuch as\r\nbeing situated in the midst of a thickly populated district and in\r\nclose proximity to the city of Naples, it has attracted much attention\r\nduring past times, and there is no other volcano concerning which we\r\nhave so complete a series of historical records. The present cone of\r\nVesuvius, which rises within the great encircling crater-ring of Somma,\r\nhas a height of about 1,000 feet. But there is undoubted evidence that\r\nthis cone, to the top of which a railway has recently been constructed\r\nfor the convenience of tourists, has been entirely built up during the\r\nlast 1,800 years, and, what is more, that during this period it has\r\nbeen many times almost wholly destroyed and reconstructed.\r\n\r\nNothing is more certain than the bet that the Vesuvius upon which the\r\nancient Romans and the Greek settlers of Southern Italy looked, was a\r\nmountain differing entirely in its form and appearance from that with\r\nwhich we are familiar. The Vesuvius known to the ancients was a great\r\ntruncated cone, having a diameter at its base of eight or nine miles,\r\nand a height of about 4,000 feet. The summit of this mountain was\r\nformed by a circular depressed plain, nearly three miles in diameter,\r\nwithin which the gladiator Spartacus, with his followers, were\r\nbesieged by a Roman army. There is no evidence that at this time the\r\nvolcanic character of the mountain was generally recognised, and its\r\nslopes are described by the ancient geographers as being clothed with\r\nfertile fields and vineyards, while the hollow at the top was a waste\r\novergrown with wild vines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Crater of Vesuvius in 1756. (From a drawing\r\nmade on the spot)]\r\n\r\nBut in the year 79 a terrible and unexpected eruption occurred, by\r\nwhich a vast, crateral hollow was formed in the midst of Vesuvius, and\r\nall the southern side of the great rim surrounding this crater was\r\nbroken down. Under the materials ejected during this eruption, the\r\ncities of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiæ were overwhelmed and buried.\r\n\r\nNumerous descriptions and drawings enable us to understand how in the\r\nmidst of the vast crater formed in the year 79 the modern cone has\r\ngradually been built up. Fresh eruptions are continually increasing the\r\nbulk, or raising the height of the Vesuvian cone.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying drawings made by Sir William Hamilton enable us to\r\nunderstand the nature of the changes which have been continually\r\ntaking place at the summit of Vesuvius. The drawing fig. 14 shows the\r\nappearance presented by the crater in the year 1756.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--The Summit of Vesuvius in 1767. (From an\r\noriginal drawing.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VESUVIUS IN MODERN TIMES.]\r\n\r\nAt this time we see that inside the crater a series of cones had been\r\nbuilt up one within the other from which lava issued, filling the\r\nbottom of the crater and finding its way through a breach in its walls,\r\ndown the side of the cone. It is evident that the ejected materials\r\nfalling on the sides of the innermost cone would tend to enlarge the\r\nlatter till its sides became confluent with the cone surrounding it,\r\nand if this action went on long enough, the crater would be entirely\r\nfilled up and a perfect cone with only a small aperture at the top\r\nwould be produced. But from time to time, grand and paroxysmal\r\noutbursts have occurred at Vesuvius, which have truncated the cone,\r\nand sometimes formed great, cup-shaped cavities, reaching almost to its\r\nbase, like that shown in fig. 13.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 the crater of Vesuvius, as shown in fig. 15, contained a single\r\nsmall cone in a state of constant spasmodic outburst, like that of\r\nStromboli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Summit of Vesuvius in 1848.]\r\n\r\nIn 1843, we find that the crater of Vesuvius contained three such small\r\ncones arranged in a line along its bottom as depicted in fig. 16.\r\n\r\nThese drawings of the summit of Vesuvius give a fair notion of the\r\nchanges which have been continually going on there during the whole of\r\nthe historical period. Ever and anon a grand outburst, like that of\r\n1822, has produced a vast and deep crater such as is represented in\r\nfig. 13, and then a long continuance of quiet and regular ejections\r\nhas built up within the crater small cones like those shown in figs.\r\n14, 15 and 16, till at last the great crater has been completely filled\r\nup, and the cone reconstructed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Outlines of Vesuvius, showing its Form at\r\ndifferent periods of its history.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHANGES IN OUTLINE OF VESUVIUS.]\r\n\r\nIn the series of outlines in fig. 17, we have endeavoured to illustrate\r\nthe succession of changes which has taken place in Vesuvius during\r\nhistorical times. In the year 79 one side of the crater-wall of the\r\nvast mountain-mass was blown away. Subsequent ejections built up the\r\npresent cone of Vesuvius within the great encircling crater-wall of\r\nSomma, and the form of this cone and the crater at its summit have\r\nbeen undergoing continual changes during the successive eruptions of\r\neighteen centuries.\r\n\r\nWhat its _future_ history may be we can only conjecture from analogy.\r\nIt may be that a long continuance of eruptions of moderate energy may\r\ngradually raise the central cone till its sides are confluent with\r\nthose of the original mountain; or it may be that some violent paroxysm\r\nwill entirely destroy the modern cone, reducing the mountain to the\r\ncondition in which it was after the great outburst of 79. On the other\r\nhand, if the volcanic forces under Vesuvius are gradually becoming\r\nextinct (but of this we have certainly no evidence at present), the\r\nmountain may gradually sink into a state of quiescence, retaining its\r\nexisting form.\r\n\r\nThe series of changes in the shape of Vesuvius, which are proved by\r\ndocumentary evidence to have been going on during the last 2,000 years,\r\nprobably find their parallel in all active volcanoes. In all of these,\r\nas we shall hereafter show, the activity of the vents undergoes great\r\nvicissitudes. Periods of continuous moderate activity alternate with\r\nshort and violent paroxysmal outbursts and intervals of complete rest,\r\nwhich may in some cases last for hundreds or even thousands of years.\r\nDuring the periods of continuous moderate activity, the crater of the\r\nvolcano is slowly filled up by the growth of smaller cones within it;\r\nand the height of the mountain is raised. By the terrible paroxysmal\r\noutbursts the mountain is often completely gutted and its summit blown\r\naway; but the materials thus removed from the top and centre of the\r\nmass are for the most part spread over its aides, so that its bulk\r\nand the area of its base are thereby increased. During the intervals\r\nof rest, the sides of the mountain which are so largely composed of\r\nloose and pulverulent materials are washed downwards by rains and\r\ndriven about by winds. Thus all volcanoes in a state of activity are\r\ncontinually growing in size every ejection, except in the case of those\r\nwhere the materials are in the finest state of subdivision, adding to\r\ntheir bulk; the area of their bases being increased during paroxysmal\r\noutbursts, and their height during long-continued moderate eruptions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEVIATIONS FROM CONICAL FORM.]\r\n\r\nWe have pointed out that the conical form of volcanic mountains is\r\ndue to the slipping of the falling materials over one another till\r\nthey attain the angle at which they can rest. There are, however, some\r\ndeviations from this regular conical form of volcanoes which it may be\r\nwell to refer to.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of rain which falls during volcanic eruptions is often\r\nenormous, owing to the condensation of the great volumes of steam\r\nemitted from the vent. Consequently the falling lapilli and dust often\r\ndescend upon the mountain, not in a dry state but in the condition\r\nof a muddy paste. Many volcanic mountains have evidently been built\r\nup by the flow of successive masses of such muddy paste over their\r\nsurfaces. Some volcanic materials when mixed with water have the\r\nproperty of rapidly 'setting' like concrete. The ancient Romans and\r\nmodern Italians, well acquainted with this property of certain kinds of\r\nvolcanic dust and lapilli, have in all ages employed this 'puzzolana,'\r\nas it is called, as mortar for building. The volcanic muds have often\r\nset in their natural positions, so as to form a rock, which, though\r\nlight and porous, is of tolerably firm consistency. To this kind of\r\nrock, of which Naples and many other cities are built, the name of\r\n'tuff' or 'tufa' is applied. A similar material is known in Northern\r\nGermany as 'trass.'\r\n\r\nThe cause of the 'setting' of puzzolana and tufa is that rain-water\r\ncontaining a small proportion of carbonic acid acts on the lime in the\r\nvolcanic fragments, and these become cemented together by the carbonate\r\nof lime and the free silica, which are thus produced in the mass.\r\n\r\nWhen a strong wind is blowing during a volcanic outburst, the materials\r\nmay be driven to one side of the vent, and accumulate there more\r\nrapidly than on the other. Thus lop-sided cones are formed, such\r\nas may frequently be observed in some volcanic districts. In areas\r\nwhere constant currents of air, like the trade-winds, prevail, all\r\nthe scoria-cones of the district may thus be found to be unequally\r\ndeveloped on opposite sides, being lowest on those from which the\r\nprevalent winds blow, and highest on the sides towards which these\r\nwinds blow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANGLE OF SLOPE IN VOLCANIC CONES.]\r\n\r\nThe examination of any careful drawing, or better still of the\r\nphotograph, of a volcanic cone, will prove that the profile of such\r\ncones is not formed by straight lines, but by curves often of a\r\ndelicate and beautiful character. The delineations of the sacred\r\nvolcano of Fusiyama, which are so constantly found in the productions\r\nof Japanese artists, must have familiarised everyone with the elegant\r\ncurved lines exhibited by the profiles of volcanoes. The upper slope\r\nof the mountain is comparatively steep, often exhibiting angles of\r\n30° to 35°, but this steepness of slope gradually diminishes, till it\r\neventually merges in the surrounding plains. The cause of this elegant\r\nform assumed by most volcanic mountains is probably two-fold. In the\r\nfirst place we have to remember that the materials falling upon the\r\nflanks of the mountain differ in size and shape, and some will rest\r\non a steeper slope than others. Thus, while some of the materials\r\nremain on the upper part of the mountains, others are rolling outwards\r\nand downwards. Hence we find that those cones which are composed of\r\nuniform materials have straight sides. But in some cases, we shall\r\nsee hereafter, there has certainly been a central subsidence of the\r\nmountain mass, and it is this subsidence which has probably given rise\r\nto the curvature of its flanks.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto considered only the methods by which the froth or\r\nfoam, which accumulates on the surface of fluid lava, is dispersed.\r\nBut in many cases not only is this scum of the lava ejected from the\r\nvolcanic vent by the escaping steam, but the fluid lava itself is\r\nextruded forcibly, and often in enormous quantities.\r\n\r\nThe lava in a volcanic vent is always in a highly heated, usually\r\nincandescent, condition. Seen by night, its freshly exposed surface\r\nis glowing red, sometimes apparently white-hot. But by exposure to\r\nthe atmosphere the surface is rapidly chilled, appearing dull red by\r\nnight, and black by day. Many persons are surprised to find that a\r\nflowing stream of lava presents the appearance of a great mass of rough\r\ncinders, rolling along with a rattling sound, owing to the striking of\r\nthe clinker-like fragments against each other. When viewed by night,\r\nthe gleaming, red light between these rough, cindery masses betrays the\r\npresence of incandescent materials below the chilled surface of the\r\nlava-stream.\r\n\r\nNo fact in connection with lavas is more striking than the varying\r\ndegrees of liquidity presented by them in different cases. While some\r\nlava-streams seem to resemble rivers, the material flowing rapidly\r\nalong, filling every channel in its course, and deluging the whole\r\ncountry around, others would be more fitly compared to glaciers,\r\ncreeping along at so slow a rate that the fact of their movement can\r\nonly be demonstrated by the most careful observation. Even when falling\r\nover a precipice such lavas, owing to their imperfect liquidity, form\r\nheavy, pendent masses like a 'guttering' candle, as is shown by fig.\r\n18, which is taken from a drawing kindly furnished to me by Capt. S. P.\r\nOliver, R.A. The causes of these differences in the rate of motion of\r\nlava-streams we must proceed to consider.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Cascade of Lava tumbling over a cliff in the\r\nIsland of Bourbon.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TEMPERATURE OF LAVA-STREAMS.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the temperature of lavas varies greatly in\r\ndifferent cases. This is shown by the fact that while some lavas are in\r\na state of complete fusion, similar to that of the slags of furnaces,\r\nand like the latter, such lavas on cooling form a glassy mass, others\r\nconsist of a liquid magma in which a larger or smaller number of\r\ncrystals are found floating. In these latter cases the temperature of\r\nthe magma must be below the fusing-point of the minerals which exist\r\nin a crystalline condition in its midst. It has indeed been suggested\r\nthat the whole of the crystals in lavas are formed during the cooling\r\ndown of a completely fused mass; but no one can imagine that the\r\nenclosed crystals of quartz, felspar, leucite, olivine, &c., have\r\nbeen so formed, such crystals being sometimes more than an inch in\r\ndiameter. The microscopic examination of lavas usually enables us to\r\ndiscriminate between those complete crystals which have been formed at\r\ngreat depths and carried up to the surface, and the minute crystalline\r\nparticles and microliths which have been developed in the glassy mass\r\nduring cooling. Crystals of the former class, indeed, exhibit abundant\r\nevidence, in their liquid cavities and other peculiarities, that they\r\nhave not been formed by simple cooling from a state of fusion, but\r\nunder the combined action of heat, the presence of water and various\r\ngases, and intense pressure.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, the different lavas vary greatly in their\r\ndegrees of fusibility. The basic lavas, containing a low percentage\r\nof silica, are much more fusible than the acid lavas, which contain\r\na high percentage of silica. When the basic lavas are reduced to a\r\ncomplete state of fusion their liquidity is sometimes very perfect, as\r\nis the case at Kilauea in Hawaii, where the lava is thrown up into jets\r\nand fountains, falling in minute drops, and being drawn out into fine\r\nglassy threads. On the other hand, the less fusible acid lavas appear\r\nto be usually only reduced to the viscous or pasty condition, which\r\nartificial glasses assume long before their complete fusion. Of this\r\nfact I have found many proofs in the Lipari Islands, where such glassy,\r\nacid lavas abound. In fig. 6 (page 43) a lava-stream is represented on\r\nthe side of the cone of Vulcano.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IMPERFECTLY FLUID LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nThis lava is an obsidian--that is to say, it is of the add type and\r\ncompletely glassy--but its liquidity must have been very imperfect,\r\nseeing that the stream has come to a standstill before reaching the\r\nbottom of a steep slope of about 35°. In fig. 19 there is given a side\r\nview of the same stream of obsidian, from which it will be seen that\r\nit has flowed slowly down a steep slope and heaped itself up at the\r\nbottom, as its fluidity was not complete enough to enable it to move on\r\na slighter incline. An examination of the interior of such imperfectly\r\nfluid lavas affords fresh proofs of the slow and tortuous movements\r\nof the mass. Everywhere we find that the bands of crystallites and\r\nsphærulites are, by the movement of the mass, folded and crumpled and\r\npuckered in the most remarkable manner, as is illustrated in figs. 20\r\nand 21. Similar appearances occur again and again among the vitreous\r\nand semi-vitreous acid lavas of Hungary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Lava-stream (obsidian) in the Island of\r\nVulcano showing the imperfect liquidity of the mass.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Interior of a Rhyolitic Lava-stream in the\r\nIsland of Lipari, showing broad sigmoidal folds produced by the slow\r\nmovements of the mass.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Interior of a Rhyolitic Lava-stream in the\r\nIsland of Lipari, showing the complicated crumplings and puckerings\r\nproduced by the slow movements of the mass.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RATE OF MOVEMENT OF VESUVIAN LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nBut, although the temperature of lava-streams and the fusibility of\r\ntheir materials may in some cases account for their condition of\r\neither perfect liquidity or viscidity, it is clear that in other\r\ninstances there must be some other cause for this difference. Thus\r\nit has been found that at Vesuvius the lavas erupted in modern times\r\nhave all a striking similarity to one another in chemical composition,\r\nin the minerals which they contain, and in their structure. They are\r\nall basic lavas, which when examined by the microscope are seen to\r\nconsist of a more or less glassy magma, in the midst of which numerous\r\ncrystals of augite, leucite, olivine, magnetite, and other minerals\r\nare scattered. Yet nothing can be more strikingly different than the\r\nbehaviour of the lavas poured out from Vesuvius at various periods. In\r\nsome cases the lava appears to be in such a perfectly liquid condition\r\nthat, issuing from the crater, it has been described as rushing down\r\nthe slope of the cone like a stream of water, and such exceedingly\r\nliquid lavas have in some cases flowed to the distance of several\r\nmiles from the base of the mountain in a very short time. But other\r\nVesuvian lavas have been in such a viscid condition that their rate\r\nof movement has been so extremely slow as to be almost imperceptible.\r\nSuch lava-streams have continued in movement during many years, but the\r\nprogress has been so slow (often only a few inches in a day) that it\r\ncould only be proved by means of careful measurements.\r\n\r\nIf we examine some of these Vesuvian lavas which have exhibited such\r\nstriking differences in their rate of flow, we shall find that they\r\npresent equally marked differences in the character of their surfaces.\r\nThe lava-current of 1858 was a remarkable example of a slow-flowing\r\nstream, and its surface, as will be seen in fig. 22, which is taken\r\nfrom a photograph, has a very marked and peculiar character. A\r\ntenacious crust seems to have formed on the surface, and by the further\r\nmotion of the mass this crust or scum has been wrinkled and folded\r\nin a very remarkable manner. Sometimes this folded and twisted crust\r\npresents a striking resemblance to coils of rope. Precisely similar\r\nappearances may be observed on the surface of many artificial slags\r\nwhen they flow from furnaces, and are seen to be due to the same\r\ncause, namely, the wrinkling up of the chilled surface-crust by the\r\nmovement of the liquid mass below. Lavas which present this appearance\r\nare frequently called 'ropy lavas'; an admirable example of them is\r\nafforded in the lava-cascade of the Island of Bourbon represented in\r\nfig. 18 (page 93).\r\n\r\nBut lavas in which the rate of flow has been very rapid, exhibit\r\nquite a different kind of surface to that of the ropy lavas. The\r\nVesuvian lava-stream of 1872 was remarkable for the rapidity of its\r\nflow, and its surface presents a remarkable contrast to that of the\r\nslow-moving lava of 1858. The surface of the lava-current of 1872 is\r\ncovered with rough cindery masses, often of enormous dimensions, and\r\nit is exceedingly difficult to traverse it, as the ragged projecting\r\nfragments tear the boots and lacerate the skin. The appearance\r\npresented by this lava-stream is illustrated by fig. 23, which is also\r\ntaken from a photograph.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Vesuvian Lava-stream of 1858, exhibiting the\r\npeculiar 'Ropy' Surfaces of Slowly Moving Currents.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Vesuvian Lava-stream of 1872, exhibiting the\r\nRough Cindery Surfaces characteristic of Rapidly Flowing Currents.\r\n\r\n(_From a Photograph._)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VESUVIAN LAVA-STREAM OF 1872.]\r\n\r\nNow it is found that those lava-streams which move slowly and present\r\nropy surfaces give off but little steam during their flow, while those\r\nlava-streams which flow more rapidly and present a rough and cindery\r\nappearance give off vast quantities of steam. The extraordinary amount\r\nof vapour given off from the lava-streams which flowed from Vesuvius\r\nin 1872 is illustrated in the photograph copied in fig. 5 (facing page\r\n24), in which the three lava-currents are each seen to be surmounted\r\nby enormous vapour-clouds rising to the height of several thousands\r\nof feet above them, and mingling with the column that issued from\r\nthe central vent. By the escape of this enormous quantity of steam\r\nthe surface of the lava was thrown into rugged cindery projections,\r\nand in some places little cones were formed upon it, which threw out\r\nsmall scoriæ and dust. The quantity of vapour was, in fact, so great,\r\nthat little parasitical volcanoes were formed on the surface of the\r\nlava-stream. Some of these miniature volcanoes were of such small\r\ndimensions that they were carried away on boards to be employed as\r\nillustrations in the lecture-rooms of the University of Naples.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the materials forced out from fissures on the\r\nsurfaces of lava-streams by the disengaged vapours and gases depends\r\non the degree of fluidity of the lava, and the force of the escaping\r\nsteam-jets. In very viscous lavas the materials may issue quietly,\r\nforming great concentric masses like coils of rope; such were described\r\nby Mr. Heaphy as occurring in New Zealand (see fig. 24).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Concentric Folds on mass of cooled Lava.]\r\n\r\nIn other cases the lava, if somewhat more liquid, may in issuing\r\nquietly without great outbursts of steam, accumulate in great\r\nbottle-shaped masses, which have been compared to 'petrified\r\nfountains.' Cases of this kind have been described by Professor Dana as\r\noccurring on the slopes of Hawaii (see fig. 25).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Mass of cooled Lava formed over a spiracle on\r\nthe slopes of Hawaii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINIATURE CONES ON LAVA-STREAMS.]\r\n\r\nWhen the steam escapes with explosive violence from a spiracle\r\n('bocca') on the surface of a lava-stream, minute cinder cones,\r\nlike those described as being formed in 1872, are the result. Fig.\r\n26 represents a group of miniature cones thrown up on the Vesuvian\r\nlava-stream of 1855: it is taken from a drawing by Schmidt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Group of small Cones thrown up on the Vesuvian\r\nLava-current of 1856.]\r\n\r\nSome of these appear like burst blisters or bubbles, while others\r\nare built up of scoriaceous masses which have been ejected from the\r\naperture and have become united while in a semi-fluid condition. Other\r\nexamples of these spiracles or bocche on the surfaces of lava-currents\r\nmay be seen in the figs. 22 and 23, which are copied from photographs.\r\n\r\nThe facts we have described all point to the conclusion that the\r\npresence of large quantities of water imprisoned in a mass of lava\r\ncontributes greatly to its mobility. And this conclusion is supported\r\nby so many other considerations that it is now very generally accepted\r\nby geologists. The condition of this imprisoned water in lavas is one\r\nwhich demands further investigation at the hands of physicists. It has\r\nbeen suggested, with some show of reason, that the water may exist\r\nin the midst of the red-hot lava as minute particles in the curious\r\n'spheroidal condition' of Boutigny, and that these flash into steam as\r\nthe lava flows along.\r\n\r\nLava, when extruded from a volcanic crater in a more or less completely\r\nfluid state, flows down the side of the cone, and then finds its way\r\nalong any channel or valley that may lie in its course, obeying in its\r\nmovements all the laws of fluid bodies. The lava-currents thus formed\r\nare sometimes of enormous dimensions, and may flood the whole country\r\nfor many miles around the vent.\r\n\r\nLava-streams have been described, which have flowed for a distance of\r\nfrom fifty to a hundred miles from their source, and which have had\r\na breadth varying from ten to twenty miles. Some lava-streams have a\r\nthickness of 500 feet, or even more. These measures will give some\r\nidea of the enormous quantities of material brought from the earth's\r\ninterior by volcanic action and distributed over its surface. The mass\r\nof lava which flowed out during an eruption off Reykjanes in Iceland,\r\nin the year 1783, has been calculated to be equal in bulk to Mont Blanc.\r\n\r\nThere are many parts of the earth's surface, such as the Western Isles\r\nof Scotland and the North-east of Ireland, the Deccan of India, and\r\nlarge tracts in the Rocky Mountains, where successive lava-sheets have\r\nbeen piled upon one another to the height of several thousands of feet,\r\nand cover areas of many hundreds or even thousands of square miles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FEATURES OF LAVA-STREAMS.]\r\n\r\nThe more fusible basic lavas are as a general rule more liquid in\r\ncharacter than any others, and it is these very liquid lavas that are\r\nusually found forming plateaux built up of successive lava-streams. The\r\nless liquid lavas, like those of Hungary and Bohemia, are not usually\r\nfound flowing to such distances from the vent, but form dome-shaped\r\nmountain-masses.\r\n\r\nLava-streams usually exhibit in their upper and under surfaces a\r\nscoriaceous texture due to the escape of steam from the upper surface,\r\nportions of the cindery masses so formed falling off from the end of\r\nthe stream, and being rolled over by the stream so as to form its\r\nbase. The thickness of this scoriaceous upper and lower part of a\r\nlava-stream varies according to the quantity of steam imprisoned in\r\nit; but all thick lava-streams have a compact central portion which\r\nis composed of hard, solid rock. Very good examples of the internal\r\nstructure of lava-streams may sometimes be examined in the sea-cliffs\r\nof volcanic islands. In fig. 27 we have given a copy of a drawing made\r\nwhile sailing round the shores of Vulcano. The scoriaceous portions of\r\nlava-streams are sometimes employed, as at Volvic in the Auvergne, as\r\na building material, or as at Neidermendig in the Eifel and in Hungary\r\nfor mill-stones; the compact portions are employed for building and\r\npaving, and for road metal. The rock of some of the modern lava-streams\r\nof Vesuvius is largely quarried for paving the streets of Naples.\r\n\r\nThis solid portion of the lava-streams in slowly cooling down from its\r\nhighly-heated condition undergoes contraction, and in consequence is\r\nrent asunder by a number of cracks. Sometimes these cracks assume a\r\nwonderfully regular arrangement, and the rock may be broken up into\r\nvery symmetrical masses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Natural section of a Lava-stream in the Island\r\nof Vulcano, showing the compact central portion and the scoriaceous\r\nupper and under surfaces.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COLUMNAR STRUCTURE OF LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nIf we imagine a great sheet of heated material, like a lava-stream,\r\nslowly cooling down, it is evident that the contraction which must\r\ntake place in it will tend to produce fissures breaking up the mass\r\ninto prisms. A little consideration will convince us what the form of\r\nthese prisms must be. There are only three regular figures into which\r\na surface can be divided, namely, equilateral triangles, squares, and\r\nregular hexagons; the first being produced by the intersection of\r\nsets of six lines radiating at angles of 60° from certain centres;\r\nthe second by the intersection of sets of _four_ lines radiating from\r\ncentres at angles of 90°; and the third from sets of _three_ lines\r\nradiating from centres at an angle of 120°. It is evident that a less\r\namount of contractile force will be required to produce the sets of\r\n_three_ cracks rather than those of four or six cracks; or, in other\r\nwords, the contractile force in a mass will be competent to produce the\r\ncracks which give rise to hexagons rather than those which form squares\r\nor triangles. This is no doubt the reason why the prisms formed by the\r\ncooling of lava, as well as those produced during the drying of starch\r\nor clay, are hexagonal in form.\r\n\r\nThe hexagonal prisms or columns formed by contraction during the\r\nconsolidation of lavas vary greatly in size, according to the rate of\r\ncooling, the nature of the materials, and the conditions affecting the\r\nmass. Sometimes such columns may be found having a diameter of eight\r\nor ten feet and a length of five hundred feet, as in the Shiant Isles\r\nlying to the north of the Island of Skye; in other cases, as in certain\r\nvolcanic glasses, minute columns, an inch or two in length and scarcely\r\nthicker than a needle, are formed; and examples of almost every\r\nintermediate grade between these two extremes may sometimes be found.\r\nThe largest columns are those which are formed in very slowly cooling\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nThe columnar structure is exhibited by all kinds of lava, and indeed\r\nin other rock-masses which have been heated by contact with igneous\r\nmasses and gradually cooled. The rocks which display the structure in\r\ngreatest perfection, however, are the basalts.\r\n\r\nMr. Scrope first called attention to the fact that the upper and lower\r\nportions of lava-streams sometimes cool in very different ways, and\r\nhence produce columns of dissimilar character. The lower portion of the\r\nmass parts with its heat very slowly, by conduction to the underlying\r\nrocks, while the upper portions radiate heat more irregularly into\r\nthe surrounding atmosphere. Hence we often find the lower portions of\r\nthick lava-streams to be formed of stout, vertical columns of great\r\nregularity; while the upper part is made up of smaller and less regular\r\ncolumns, as shown in fig. 28.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Section of a Lava-stream exposed on the side\r\nof the river Ardèche, in the south-west of France.]\r\n\r\nThe remarkable grotto known as Fingal's Cave in the Island of Staffa\r\nhas been formed in the midst of a lava-stream such as we have been\r\ndescribing; the thick vertical columns, which rise from beneath the\r\nlevel of the sea, are divided by joints and have been broken away by\r\nthe action of the sea; in this way a great cavern has been produced,\r\nthe sides of which are formed by vertical columns, while the roof is\r\nmade up of smaller and interlacing ones. The whole structure bears some\r\nresemblance to a Gothic cathedral; the sea finding access to its floor\r\nof broken columns, and permitting the entrance of a boat during fine\r\nweather. Similar, though perhaps less striking, structures are found in\r\nmany other parts of the globe wherever basaltic and other lava-streams\r\nexhibit the remarkable columnar structure as the result of their slow\r\ncooling. Portions of basaltic columns are often employed for posts\r\nby the road-sides, as in Central Germany and Bohemia, or for paving\r\nstones, as in Pompeii and at the Monte Albano near Rome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--Portion of a Basaltic Column from the Giant's\r\nCauseway, exhibiting both the ball-and-socket and the tenon-and-mortise\r\nstructures.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OTHER JOINT-STRUCTURES IN LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally basaltic lava-streams exhibit other curious structures in\r\naddition to the columnar. Thus some basaltic columns are found divided\r\ninto regular joints by equidistant, curved surfaces, the joints thus\r\nfitting into one another by a kind of ball-and-socket arrangement.\r\nSometimes we find processes projecting from the angles of the curved\r\njoint-surfaces, which cause the blocks to fit together as with a tenon\r\nand mortise. This kind of structure is admirably displayed at the\r\nGiant's Causeway, Co. Antrim, in the North of Ireland. A portion of a\r\nbasaltic column from this locality is represented in fig. 29.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Vein of green Pitchstone, at Chiaja di Luna\r\nin the Island of Ponza, breaking up into regular columns, and into\r\nspherical masses with a concentric series of joints.]\r\n\r\nWhile the ordinary columnar structures are very common in basalts,\r\nthe ball-and-socket and tenon-and-mortise structures are exceedingly\r\nrare. The question of the mode of origin of these remarkable structures\r\nhas given rise to much discussion, and the opinions of geologists and\r\nphysicists are by no means unanimous upon the subject.\r\n\r\nSometimes we find masses of lava traversed by curved joints, and\r\noccasionally we find curious combinations of curved and plane joints,\r\ngiving rise to appearances scarcely less remarkable than those\r\npresented by the columns of the Giant's Causeway. Some of the more\r\nstriking examples of this kind have been described and explained by\r\nProfessor Bonney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Illustration of the 'Perlitic structure' in\r\nglassy Rocks.\r\n\r\n  a. Perlltic structure, as seen in a lava from Hungary.\r\n  b. The same structure, artificially produced in Canada Balsam\r\n       during cooling.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PERLITIC-STRUCTURE IN LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nIn the Ponza Islands there occurs a remarkable example of a columnar\r\npitchstone, which is also traversed by a member of curved concentric\r\njoints, causing the rock to break up into pieces like the coats of an\r\nonion. This remarkable rock-mass is represented in fig. 30.\r\n\r\nA very similar structure is often seen in certain glassy lavas, when\r\nthey are examined in thin sections under the microscope. Such glassy\r\nlavas exhibit the peculiar lustre of mother-of-pearly doubtless in\r\nconsequence of the interference of light along the cracks. Lavas\r\nexhibiting this character are known to geologists as 'perlites.' The\r\nperlitic structure has been produced artificially by Mr. Grenville Cole\r\nin Canada Balsam, and by MM. Fonqué and Michel Lévy, in chemically\r\ndeposited silica. See fig. 31.\r\n\r\nA thick lava-stream must take an enormous period to cool down--probably\r\nmany hundreds or even thousands of years. It is possible to walk over\r\nlava-streams in which at a few inches below the surface the rock is\r\nstill red-hot, so that a piece of stick is lighted if thrust into a\r\ncrack. Lava is a very bad conductor of heat, and loose scoriæ and\r\ndust are still worse conductors. During the eruption of Vesuvius in\r\n1872, masses of snow which were covered with a thick layer of scoriæ,\r\nand afterwards by a stream of lava, were found three years afterwards\r\nconsolidated into ice, but not melted. The city of Catania is\r\nconstantly supplied with ice from masses of snow which have been buried\r\nunder the ejections of Etna.\r\n\r\nDuring the cooling down of lavas, the escape of steam and various\r\ngases gives rise to the deposition of many beautiful crystalline\r\nsubstances in the cavities and on the surfaces of the lava. Deposits\r\nof sulphur, specular-iron, tridymite, and many other substances are\r\noften thus produced, and the colour and appearance of the rock-masses\r\nare sometimes completely disguised by these surface incrustations, or\r\nby the decomposition of the materials of the lava by the action of the\r\nadd gases, and vapours upon it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SINKING OF SURFACES OF LAVA-STREAMS.]\r\n\r\nVery frequently the surface of a lava-stream becomes solid, while the\r\ndeeper portions retain their fluid condition; under such circumstances\r\nthe central portions may flow away, leaving a great hollow chamber or\r\ncavern. In consequence of this action, we not unfrequently find the\r\nupper surface of a lava-current exhibiting a depression, due to the\r\nfalling in of the solidified upper portions when the liquid lava has\r\nflowed away and left it unsupported, as in fig. 32.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Transverse section of a Lava stream. (The\r\ndotted line indicates the original surface.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF VOLCANIC MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNear the high-road which passes between the towns of Eger and\r\nFranzenbad in Bohemia, there rises a small hill known as the Kammerbühl\r\n(see fig. 33), which has attracted to itself an amount of interest\r\nand attention quite out of proportion to its magnitude or importance.\r\nDuring the latter part of the last century and the earlier years of\r\nthe present one, the fiercest controversies were waged between the\r\npartisans of rival schools of cosmogony over this insignificant hill;\r\nsome maintaining that it originated in the combustion of a bed of coal,\r\nothers that its materials were entirely formed by some kind of 'aqueous\r\nprecipitation,' and others again that the hill was the relic of a small\r\nvolcanic cone.\r\n\r\nAmong those who took a very active part in this controversy was\r\nthe poet Goethe, who stoutly maintained the volcanic origin of the\r\nKammerbühl, styling it 'a pocket edition of a volcano.' To Goethe\r\nbelongs the merit of having suggested a Very simple method by which the\r\ncontroversies concerning this hill might be set at rest: he proposed\r\nthat a series of excavations should be undertaken around the hill, and\r\na tunnel driven right under its centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--The Kammerbühl of Kammerberg, Bohemia.\r\n\r\n(As seen from the south-west)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE KAMMERBÜHL.]\r\n\r\nThe poet's friend, Count Caspar von Sternberg, determined to put this\r\nproject into execution. This series of excavations, which was completed\r\nin 1837, has for ever set at rest all doubts as to the volcanic origin\r\nof the Kammerbühl. A plug of basalt was found filling the centre of\r\nthe mass, and connected with a small lava-stream flowing down the side\r\nof the hill; while the bulk of the hill was shown to be composed of\r\nvolcanic scoriæ and lapilli. The section fig. 34 will illustrate the\r\nstructure of the hill as revealed by these interesting excavations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Section of the Kammerbühl, in Bohemia.\r\n\r\n_a a._ Metamorphic rocks. _b._ Basaltic scoriæ. _c._ Solid plug\r\nof basalt rising through the centre of the volcanic pile, _d d._\r\nLava-stream composed of the same rock. _e e._ Alluvial matter\r\nsurrounding the old volcano.\r\n\r\n(The dotted lines indicate the probable former outline of the volcano.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VOLCANOES DISSECTED BY DENUDATION.]\r\n\r\nIt can of course very seldom happen that actual mining operations, like\r\nthose undertaken in the case of the Kammerbühl, will be resorted to\r\nin order to determine the structure of volcanic mountains. Geologists\r\nhave usually to avail themselves of less direct, but by no means less\r\ncertain, methods than that of making artificial excavations in order\r\nto investigate the earth's crust. Fortunately it happens that what we\r\ncannot accomplish ourselves, nature does for us. The action which we\r\ncall 'denudation' serves as a scalpel to dissect volcanic mountains\r\nfor us, and to expose their inner recesses to our view. Many portions\r\nof the earth's surface are complete museums crowded with volcanic\r\n'subjects,' exhibiting every stage of the process of dissection. In\r\nsome, rains and winds have stripped off the loose covering of cinders\r\nand dust, and exposed the harder and more solid parts--the skeleton of\r\nthe mountain. In others, the work of destruction has proceeded still\r\nfurther, and slowly wearing rivers or the waves of the sea may have cut\r\nperfect, vertical sections of the mountain-mass. Sometimes the removal\r\nof the materials of the volcanic mountain has gone on to such an extent\r\nthat its base and ground-plan are fully exposed. It only requires the\r\nnecessary skill in piecing together our observations on these dissected\r\nvolcanoes, in order to arrive at just views concerning the 'comparative\r\nanatomy' of volcanoes. As the knowledge of the structure of animals\r\nremained in the most rudimentary condition until the practice of\r\ndissection was commenced, so our knowledge of volcanoes was likewise\r\nexceedingly imperfect till geologists availed themselves of the\r\nopportunities afforded to them of studying naturally dissected volcanic\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nIn some cases we may find that the sea has encroached on the base\r\nof a volcanic hill, till one half of it has been washed away, and\r\nthe structure of the mass to its very centre is exposed to our view.\r\nThus in fig. 6 (page 43), it will be seen that there lies in front of\r\nVulcano a peninsula called Vulcanello, consisting of three volcanic\r\ncones, united at their base, with the lava-streams which have flowed\r\nfrom them. One half of the cone on the left-hand side of the picture\r\nhas been completely washed away by the sea, and a perfect section\r\nof the internal structure of the cone is exposed. The appearances\r\npresented in this section are shown in the sketch, fig. 35. Some\r\nportions of the face of this section are concealed by the heaps of\r\nfragments which have fallen from it, but enough is visible to convince\r\nus that three kinds of structures go to make up the cone. In the first\r\nplace, we have the loose scoriæ and lapilli, which in falling through\r\nthe air have arranged themselves in tolerably regular layers upon the\r\nsides of the cone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Natural section or a Volcanic Cone in the\r\nIsland of Vulcano.\r\n\r\n_a._ Crater. _b b._ Lava-streams. _c._ Dykes which have clearly formed\r\nthe ducts, through which the lava has risen to the crater. _d d._\r\nStratified volcanic scoriæ. _e._ Talus of fallen materials.]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, we have lava-streams which have been ejected from\r\nthe crater or from fissures on the flanks of the cone, and flowed down\r\nits sides. And thirdly, we find masses of lava filling up cracks in\r\nthe cone; these latter are called 'dykes.' Of these three kinds of\r\nstructures most volcanic mountains are built up, but in different\r\ncases the part played by these several elements may be very unequal.\r\nSometimes volcanoes consist entirely of fragmentary materials, at\r\nothers they are made up of lavas only, while in the majority of\r\ncases they have been formed by alternations of fragmentary and fluid\r\nejections, the whole being bound together by dykes, which are masses of\r\nlava injected into the cracks formed from time to time in the sides of\r\nthe growing cone.\r\n\r\nIf we direct our attention in the first place to the fragmentary\r\nejections, we shall find that they affect a very marked and peculiar\r\narrangement, which is best exhibited in those volcanic cones composed\r\nentirely of such materials.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF VOLCANIC CONES.]\r\n\r\nEveryone who examines volcanoes for the first time will probably be\r\nstruck by the regular stratification of materials of which they are\r\ncomposed. Thus the tuffs covering the city of Pompeii are found to\r\nconsist of numerous thin layers of lapilli and volcanic dust, perfectly\r\ndistinct from one another, and assuming even the arrangement which we\r\nusually regard as characteristic of materials that have been deposited\r\nfrom a state of suspension in water. The fragmentary materials in\r\nfalling through the air are sorted, the finer particles being carried\r\nfarther from the vent than the larger and heavier ones. The force\r\nof different volcanic outbursts also varies greatly, and sometimes\r\nmaterials of different character are thrown out during successive\r\nejections. These facts will be illustrated by fig. 36, which is a\r\ndrawing of a section exposed in a quarry opened in the side of the\r\nKammerbühl. In this section we see that the falling scoriæ have been\r\narranged in rudely parallel beds, but the regular deposition of these\r\nhas been interrupted by the ejection of masses of burnt slate torn from\r\nthe side of the vent, probably during some more than usually violent\r\nparoxysm of the volcano. In those volcanoes which are built up of tuffs\r\nand materials which have fallen in the condition of a muddy paste, the\r\nperfect stratification of the mass is often very striking indeed, and\r\nlarge cones are found built up of thin uniformly-spread layers of more\r\nor less finely-divided materials, disposed in parallel succession.\r\nSuch finely-stratified tuff-cones abound in the district of the Campi\r\nPhlegræi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Section in the side of the Kammerbühl, Bohemia.\r\n\r\n_a a._ stratified basaltic scoriæ. _b b._ Bands made up of fragments\r\nof burnt slate. _c._ Stratified basaltic scoriæ. _d d._ Pseudo-dykes\r\noccupying lines of fault.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARRANGEMENT OF FRAGMENTAL MATERIALS.]\r\n\r\nIf, in consequence of any subterranean movements, fissures are produced\r\nin the sides of the cones formed of fragmentary materials, these often\r\nbecome gradually filled with loose fragments from the sides of the\r\nfissure, and in this manner 'pseudo-dykes' are formed. An example of\r\nsuch pseudo-dykes is represented in fig. 36, where the beds composing\r\nthe volcanic cone of the Kammerbühl are seen to have been broken across\r\nor faulted, and the fissures produced in the mass have been gradually\r\nfilled with loose fragments.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to imitate, on a small scale, the conditions which\r\nexist at those volcanic vents from which only fragmentary materials\r\nare ejected. If we take a board having a hole in its centre, into\r\nwhich a pipe is inserted conveying a strong air-blast, we shall, by\r\nintroducing some light material like bran or sawdust into this pipe\r\ncause an ejection of fragments, which will, when the board is placed\r\nhorizontally, fall around the orifice of the pipe and accumulate there\r\nin a conical heap (fig. 37). It will be found necessary, as was shown\r\nby Mr. Woodward, who performed the experiment before the Physical\r\nSociety, to adopt some contrivance, such as a screw, for forcing the\r\nmaterial into the air-pipe. If we alternately introduce materials of\r\ndifferent colours, like mahogany- and deal-sawdust into the pipe, these\r\nmaterials will be arranged in layers which can be easily recognised,\r\nand the mode of accumulation of the mass will be evident. By means of\r\na sheet of tin or cardboard we may divide this miniature volcanic cone\r\nvertically into two portions, and if we sweep one of these away the\r\ninternal structure of the other half will be clearly displayed before\r\nour eyes.\r\n\r\nIn this way we shall find that the conical heap of sawdust with the\r\nhole in its centre has a very peculiar and definite arrangement of its\r\nmaterials. It is made up of a number of layers each of which slopes in\r\nopposite directions, towards the centre of ejection and away from that\r\ncentre. These layers are thickest along the line of the circle where\r\nthe change in slope takes place, and they thin away in the direction of\r\nthe two opposite slopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Experimental illustration of the mode of\r\nFormation of Volcanic Cones composed of fragmental materials.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAUSE OF THIS ARRANGEMENT.]\r\n\r\nThe cause of this peculiar arrangement of the materials is evident.\r\nThe sawdust thrown up by the air blast descends in a shower and tends\r\nto accumulate in a circular heap around the orifice, the area of this\r\ncircular heap being determined by the force of the blast. Within this\r\ncircular area, however, the quantity of falling fragments is not\r\neverywhere the same; along a circle surrounding the vent at a certain\r\ndistance, the maximum number of falling fragments will be found to\r\ndescend, and here the thickest deposit will take place. As this goes\r\non, a circular ridge will be formed, with slopes towards and away\r\nfrom the centre of injection. As the ridge increases in height, the\r\nmaterials will tend to roll down either one slope or the other, and\r\ngradually a structure of the form shown in the figure will be piled up.\r\nThe materials sliding down the outer slope will tend to increase the\r\narea of the base of the cone, while those which find their way down the\r\ninner slope will fall into the vent to be again ejected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Natural section of a Tuff-cone forming the\r\nCape of Misenum, and exhibiting the peculiar internal Arrangement\r\ncharacteristic of volcanoes composed of fragmentary materials.]\r\n\r\nVolcanic cones composed of scoriæ, dust, &c. are found to have exactly\r\nthe same internal structure as is exhibited by the miniature cone of\r\nsawdust. The more or less regular layers of which they are made up dip\r\nin opposite directions, away from and towards the vent, and thin out\r\nin the direction of their dip (see fig. 38). In small cones the crater\r\nor central cavity is of considerable size in proportion to the whole\r\nmass, but as the cone grows upwards and outwards, the dimensions of\r\nthe crater remain the same, while the area of the base and the height\r\nof the cone are continually increasing. This is the normal structure\r\nof volcanic cones formed of fragmentary materials, though, as we shall\r\nhereafter show, many irregularities are often produced by local and\r\ntemporary causes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Section of a small Scoria-cone formed within\r\nthe crater of Vesuvius in the year 1885, illustrating the filling-up of\r\nthe central tent of the cone by subsequent ejections.]\r\n\r\nIn some cases the central vent of a volcanic scoria-cone may be\r\nfilled up by subsequent ejections. A beautiful example of this kind\r\nwas observed by Abich, in the case of a small cone formed within the\r\ncrater of Vesuvius in 1835, and is represented in fig. 39.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Volcanic Cones composed of Scoriæ, and\r\nbreached on one side by the outflow of lava-currents.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BREACHED CONES.]\r\n\r\nMany cones formed in the first instance of scoriæ, tuff, and pumice may\r\ngive rise to streams of lava, before the vent which they surround sinks\r\ninto a state of quiescence. In these cases, the liquid lava in the vent\r\ngives off such quantities of steam that masses of froth or scoriæ are\r\nformed, which are ejected and accumulate around the orifice. When the\r\nforce of the explosive action is exhausted, the lava rises bodily in\r\nthe crater, which it more or less completely fills. But, eventually,\r\nthe weaker side of the crater-wall yields beneath the pressure of the\r\nliquid mass, and this part of the crater and cone is swept away before\r\nthe advancing lava-stream. Examples of such 'breached cones' abound in\r\nAuvergne and many other volcanic districts (see fig. 40). A beautiful\r\nexample of a cone formed of pumice, which has been breached by the\r\noutflow of a lava-stream of obsidian, occurs in the Lipari Islands, at\r\nthe Rocche Rosse. It is this locality which supplies the whole world\r\nwith pumice (see fig. 41).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Campo Bianco, in the Island of Lipari. A\r\nPumice-cone breached by the Outflow of an Obsidian Lava-current.]\r\n\r\nIt is often surprising to find how volcanic cones composed of loose\r\nmaterials, such as tuffs, scoriæ, or pumice, retain their distinctive\r\nforms, and even the sharpness of their outlines, during enormous\r\nperiods of time. Thus, in the scoria-cones which abound in the\r\nAuvergne, and were, in all probability, formed before the historical\r\nperiod, the sharp edges of the craters appear to have suffered scarcely\r\nany erosion, and the cones are as perfect in their outlines as though\r\nformed but yesterday. It is probable that the facility with which these\r\ncindery heaps are penetrated by the rain which falls upon them is the\r\ncause why they are not more frequently washed away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Volcanic Cones in Auvergne which have suffered\r\nto some extent from atmospheric denudation.]\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, scoria-cones are found reduced by atmospheric\r\nwaste to mere heaps of cinders, in which the position of the crater is\r\nindicated only by a slight depression, as in fig. 42.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONES COMPOSED OF LAVA.]\r\n\r\nWhen but little explosive action takes place at the volcanic vent, and\r\nonly fluid lava is ejected, mountains are formed differing very greatly\r\nin character from the cones composed of fragmentary materials.\r\n\r\nIf the lavas be of very perfect liquidity, like those erupted in the\r\nSandwich Islands, they flow outwards around the vent to enormous\r\ndistances. By the accumulation of materials during successive\r\noutbursts, a conical mass is built up which has but a slight elevation\r\nin proportion to the area of its base. Thus in Hawaii we find great\r\nvolcanic cones, composed of very fluid lavas, which have a height of\r\nnearly 14,000 feet with a diameter of base of seventy miles. In these\r\nHawaiian mountains the slope of the sides rarely exceeds 6° to 8°.\r\n\r\nBut if, on the other hand, the lavas be of much more viscid\r\nconsistency, the character of the volcanic cones which are produced by\r\ntheir extrusion will be very different. The outwelling material will\r\ntend to accumulate and heap itself up around the vent. By successive\r\nejections the first-formed shell is forced upwards and outwards, and\r\na steep-sided protuberant mass is formed, exhibiting in its interior\r\na marked concentric arrangement. Dr. Ed. Reyer, of Grätz, has devised\r\na very ingenious method for reproducing on a miniature scale the\r\ncharacteristic features of these eruptions of viscid lavas. He takes a\r\nquantity of plaster of Paris reduced to a pasty consistence, which he\r\nforces through a hole in a board. The plaster accumulates in a great\r\nrounded boss about the orifice through which it has been forced. If the\r\nplaster have some colouring matter introduced into it, the mass, on\r\nbeing cut across, will exhibit in the disposition of its colour-bands\r\nthe kind of action which has gone on during its extrusion, fig. 43.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Experimental illustration of the Mode of\r\nFormation of volcanic cones composed of viscid lavas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--The Grand Puy of Sarcoui, composed of\r\ntrachyte, rising between two breached scoria-cones (Auvergne).]\r\n\r\nThere are many volcanic cones which exhibit clear evidence of having\r\nthus been formed by the extrusion of a viscid mass of lava through\r\na volcanic fissure. Among such we may mention the domitic Puys of\r\nAuvergne, fig. 44, many andesitic volcanoes in Hungary, the phonolite\r\nhills of Bohemia, and the so-called 'mamelons' of the Island of\r\nBourbon. See figs. 45 and 46. When the interior of these masses is\r\nexposed by natural or artificial sections, they are all found to\r\nexhibit the onion-like structure which occurs in the plaster models.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF LAVA-CONES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Volcanic Cone (Mamelon) composed of very\r\nviscid lava. (Island of Bourbon.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Another Mamelon in the Island of Bourbon, with\r\na crater at its summit.]\r\n\r\nBut while some volcanoes are composed entirely of the fragmentary\r\nejections and others are wholly formed by successive outflows of lava,\r\nthe majority of volcanoes, especially those of larger dimensions, are\r\nbuilt up of alternations of these different kinds of materials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Cliff-section in the Island of Madeira,\r\nshowing how a composite volcano is built up of lava-streams, beds of\r\nscoriæ, and dykes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NATURAL SECTIONS OF CONES.]\r\n\r\nThe structure of these composite cones may be understood by an\r\ninspection of the accompanying fig. 47, which shows the appearances\r\npresented in a cliff on the coast of the Island of Madeira. We see\r\nthat the mass is made up of numerous layers of volcanic scoriæ,\r\nalternating with sheets of lava. The latter, which are represented\r\nin transverse section in the drawing, are seen to thin out on either\r\nside, and to vary greatly in breadth. Besides the alternating masses\r\nof scoriæ and the lava-sheets, there are seen in the section, bands\r\nof a bright-red colour, which are represented in the drawing by black\r\nlines. These are layers of soil, or volcanic dust, which, by the\r\npassage of a lava-stream over their surface, have been burnt so as\r\nto acquire a brick-red colour. These bands of red material, to which\r\nthe name of 'laterite' has been frequently applied, very commonly\r\noccur in sections of composite volcanic cones. Crossing the whole of\r\nthe horizontally-disposed masses in the section, we find a number of\r\n'dykes,' which are evidently great cracks filled with lava from below.\r\nSome of these run vertically through the cliffs, others obliquely. In\r\nsome cases the lava, rising to fill a dyke, has flowed as a lava-stream\r\nat the surface. Last of all, we must call attention to the fact that\r\nthe section exhibits evidence of great movements having taken place\r\nsubsequently to the accumulation of the whole of the materials. A\r\ngreat crack has been produced, on one side of which the whole mass has\r\nsubsided bodily, giving rise to the phenomenon which geologists call a\r\n'fault.'\r\n\r\nIn the section, fig. 27, p. 104, copied from a drawing of a sea-cliff\r\nin the Island of Vulcano, a transverse section of a lava-stream is\r\nrepresented on a somewhat larger scale. The upper and under surface of\r\nthe lava-stream is seen to have a scoriaceous structure, but the thick\r\ncentral mass is compact, and divided by regular joint-planes. This\r\nsection also illustrates the fact that, before the lava-stream flowed\r\ndown the sides of the mountain, a valley had been cut by meteoric\r\nagencies on the flanks of the volcano, the dykes which traverse the\r\nlower beds of tuff being abruptly truncated.\r\n\r\nIn mountain ravines, upon the slopes of ancient volcanoes, and in the\r\ncliffs of volcanic islands, we are often able to study the way in which\r\nthese great mountain masses are built up of alternating lava-currents,\r\nbeds of volcanic agglomerate, scoriæ, tuff and dust, and intersecting\r\ndykes. In fig. 48, the features above described are illustrated by a\r\nsection in the sides of the great volcano of Mont Dore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Section seen at the cascade. Bains du Mont\r\nDore.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--Section in the Island of Ventotienne, showing\r\na great stream of andesitic lava overlying stratified tuffs.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SECTIONS IN THE PONZA ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\nIn figs. 49, 50, 51, and 52, we have given drawings of portions of the\r\nsea-cliffs in several of the Ponza Islands, a small volcanic group off\r\nthe Italian coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--Cliff on the south side of the Island of San\r\nStephano.\r\n\r\n_a._ Trachyte lava-stream, with a scoriaceous upper surface overlaid by\r\nstratified tuffs, _b_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--The headland of Monte della Guardia, in the\r\nIsland of Ponza.\r\n\r\n_a._ Columnar trachyte. _b._ Stratified tuffs. _c._ Pumiceous\r\nagglomerates. _d._ Dyke of rhyolite.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Western side of the same headland, as seen\r\nfrom the north side of Luna Bay.\r\n\r\n_a._ Trachyte lava. _b._ Stratified tuffs. _c._ Dykes of rhyolite, with\r\ntheir edges passing into pitchstone. _d._ Pumiceous agglomerate.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--Sea-cliff at Il Capo, the north-east point of\r\nSalina showing stratified agglomerates traversed by numerous dykes, the\r\nwhole being unconformably overlaid by stratified aqueous deposits.]\r\n\r\nFig, 53 represents a cliff-section in the island of Salina, one of the\r\nLiparis, exhibiting evidence that a series of volcanic agglomerates\r\ntraversed by dykes of Andesite have been denuded and covered by a\r\nrecent stratified deposit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PART PLAYED BY DYKES IN CONE-BUILDING.]\r\n\r\nIn the formation of these great composite cones, a minor but by no\r\nmeans insignificant part is played by the dykes, or lava-filled\r\nfissures, which are seen traversing the mass in all directions. That\r\ndyke-fissures often reach the surface of a volcanic cone, and that\r\nthe material which injects them then issues as a lava-stream, is\r\nillustrated by fig. 54. The formation of these cracks in a volcanic\r\ncone, and their injection by liquid lava, must of course distend\r\nthe mountainous mass and increase its volume. If we visit the great\r\ncrater-walls of Somma in Vesuvius, and of the Val del Bove in Etna,\r\nwe shall find that the dykes are so numerous that they make up a\r\nconsiderable portion of the mass. When the loose scoriæ and tuffs are\r\nremoved by denudation, these hard dykes often stand up prominently like\r\ngreat walls, as represented in fig. 55. Even in such cases as these,\r\nhowever, it is doubtful whether the bulk of all the dykes put together\r\nexceeds one-tenth of that of the lavas and fragmentary materials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--Section observed in the Val del Bove, Etna,\r\nshowing a basaltic dyke, from the upper part of which a lava-current\r\nhas flowed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Basaltic Dykes projecting from masses of\r\nstratified scoriæ in the sides of the Val del Bove, Etna.]\r\n\r\nHence we are led by an examination of the internal structure of\r\nvolcanic mountains to conclude that scoriæ- and tuff-cones, and cones\r\nformed of very liquid lavas, increase by an _exogenous_ mode of growth,\r\nall new materials being added to them from without; in the cones formed\r\nof very viscid lavas, on the other hand, the growth is _endogenous_,\r\ntaking place by successive accretions within it. The composite cones\r\nowe their origin to both the _exogenous_ and the _endogenous_ modes of\r\ngrowth, but in a much greater degree to the former than the latter. The\r\nlayers of scoriæ, tuff, and dust, and the successive lava-streams are\r\nadded to the mass from without, and the lava forming the dykes from\r\nwithin it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THEORY OF ELEVATION CRATERS.]\r\n\r\nThere are doubtless cases in which, when a tuff-cone is formed, a mass\r\nof very viscid lavas is extruded into its interior, and the mass is\r\ndistended like a gigantic bubble. But inasmuch as the very viscid lavas\r\ndo not appear to give rise to scoriæ to anything like the same extent\r\nas the more liquid kinds, such 'cupolas,' as they have been called\r\nby some German geologists, are probably not very numerous, and may\r\nbe regarded as constituting the exception rather than the rule. The\r\nidea which was formerly entertained by some geologists that all great\r\nvolcanic mountains were formed of masses originally deposited in a\r\nhorizontal position, and subsequently blown up into a conical form, has\r\nbeen effectually disposed of by the observations of Lyell and Scrope.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the great fluid masses which underlie volcanic vents\r\nis another point on which much light has been thrown by the study\r\nof naturally-dissected volcanoes. In some cases, as was shown by\r\nHochstetter during his admirable researches among the New Zealand\r\nvolcanoes, the rising lavas form a great chamber for themselves in the\r\nmidst of a volcanic cinder-cone, taking the place of loose materials\r\nwhich are re-ejected from the vent, or have been re-fused and absorbed\r\ninto the mass of lava itself. From this central reservoir of lava,\r\neruptions are kept up for some time, but when the volcano sinks\r\ninto a state of quiescence the lava slowly consolidates. In such\r\nslowly solidified masses of lava, very beautiful groups of radiating\r\ncolumns are often exhibited Northern Germany abounds with examples\r\nof such basaltic masses, which have once formed the centres of great\r\ncinder-cones; but in consequence of the removal of the loose materials\r\nand the surrounding strata by denudation, these central reservoirs of\r\nthe volcanoes have been left standing above the surface, and exhibit\r\nthe peculiar arrangements of the columns formed in them during the\r\nprocess of cooling.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INTRUSIVE LAVA-SHEETS.]\r\n\r\nBut in the majority of the more solidly-built composite volcanoes no\r\nsuch liquid reservoir can be formed within the volcanic cone itself.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the lavas, especially those of more liquid\r\ncharacter, tend to force passages for themselves among the rocks\r\nthrough which they are extruded. Wherever a weak point exists, there\r\nsuch lavas will find their way, and as the planes of stratification\r\nin sedimentary rocks constitute such weak places, we constantly find\r\nsheets of lava thus inserted between beds of aqueous origin. The areas\r\nover which these intrusive sheets of rock sometimes extend may be very\r\ngreat, but the more fusible, basic lavas (basalt, &c.) usually form\r\nmuch more widely-spreading sheets than the less fusible, acid lavas.\r\nIn some cases these great intrusive sheets are found extending to a\r\ndistance of twenty or thirty miles from the centre at which they were\r\nejected, and they often follow the bedding of the strata with which\r\nthey are intercalated in so regular a manner, that it is difficult for\r\nan observer to believe at first sight that they can have been formed in\r\nthe way which we have described. A closer examination will generally\r\nreveal the fact that while these intrusive lava-sheets retain their\r\nparallelism with the strata among which they have been intruded, over\r\nconsiderable areas, yet they sometimes break across, or send offshoots\r\ninto them, as shown in fig. 56. In all cases, too, the rocks lying\r\nabove and below such sheets will be found to be more or less baked and\r\naltered, and this affords a very convincing evidence of the intrusion\r\nof the igneous mass between the strata so altered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--Sheets of Igneous Rock (Basalt) intruded\r\nbetween beds of sandstone, clay, and limestone. (Island of Skye.)]\r\n\r\nThat in the case of most great volcanic mountains, or systems of\r\nmountains, vast reservoirs of liquid lava must exist in the earth's\r\ncrust far below the surface, there can be little room for doubt.\r\nWhether such fluid masses are in direct or indirect communication with\r\na great central reservoir, even supposing such to exist, is a totally\r\ndifferent question. In many cases the outburst of volcanoes in more or\r\nless close proximity has been observed to take place simultaneously,\r\nwhile in others the commencement of the eruption of one volcano has\r\ncoincided with the lapse into quiescence of another in its vicinity.\r\nOn the other hand, the remarkable case of the volcanoes of Hawaii\r\nseems to indicate that two vents in close proximity may be supplied\r\nfrom perfectly distinct reservoirs of lava. The active craters of\r\nMauna Loa and Kilauea are situated at the heights of 14,000 and 4,000\r\nfeet respectively above the sea level; yet the former is sometimes\r\nin a state of violent activity, with which the latter shows no signs\r\nof sympathy whatever. We shall, in a future chapter, adduce evidence\r\nthat the liquid lavas in underground reservoirs may undergo various\r\nstages of change in the enormous periods of time during which habitual\r\nvolcanic vents are supplied from them.\r\n\r\nWe have already shown that the character assumed by a mass of fused\r\nmaterial in cooling varies greatly according as the cooling takes place\r\nrapidly at the surface or slowly under enormous pressure. In the former\r\ncase a glassy base is formed containing a greater or smaller number\r\nof crystallites or embryo crystals, in the latter the whole rock is\r\nconverted into a mass of fully-developed crystals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONSOLIDATION OF LAVAS AT GREAT DEPTHS.]\r\n\r\nThe lavas which are poured out at the surface consist, as we have\r\nseen, of a glassy magma in which a greater or smaller number of\r\ncrystals are found which have been borne up from below. The great\r\ndykes and intrusive sheets consist for the most part of a mass of\r\nsmall or imperfectly developed crystals in which a number of large and\r\nperfectly formed crystals are embedded. Such rocks are said to have a\r\n'porphyritic' structure. The rocks formed by the consolidation of the\r\nliquid masses in the underground reservoirs are found to be perfectly\r\ncrystallised, the crystals impressing one another on every side and\r\nmaking up the whole mass to the exclusion of any paste or magma between\r\nthem. The crystals in those rocks which have consolidated at these\r\nvast depths exhibit evidence, in their enclosed watery solutions and\r\nliquefied carbonic acid, of the enormous pressures under which they\r\nmust have been consolidated. The lavas, the more or less porphyritic\r\nrocks of the dykes and sheets, and the perfectly crystalline (granitic)\r\nrocks of the underground reservoirs pass into one another, however, by\r\nthe most insensible gradations.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes find examples of volcanoes which, by the action of\r\ndenuding forces, have had their very foundations exposed to our view.\r\nSuch examples occur in the Western Isles of Scotland, in the Euganean\r\nHills near Padua in Northern Italy, and in many other parts of the\r\nearth's surface. In these cases we are able to trace the ground-plan of\r\nthe volcanic pile, and to study the materials which have consolidated\r\ndeep beneath the surface in the very heart of the mountain.\r\n\r\nIn studying these 'basal wrecks' of old volcanoes it is always\r\nnecessary to bear in mind that the appearance and general characters of\r\na volcanic rock may be completely disguised by chemical changes going\r\non within it. It is through want of attention to this fact that so many\r\nmistakes were made by the Wernerian school of geologists who declared\r\nthat they could find no analogy between the basaltic rocks of the globe\r\nand the products of active volcanoes, and were hence led to refer the\r\norigin of the former to some kind of 'aqueous precipitation.'\r\n\r\nMany of the hard and crystalline marbles which are employed as\r\nornamental stones were originally loose masses of shells and corals,\r\nas we easily perceive when we examine the polished faces. But these\r\nincoherent heaps of organic _débris_ have been converted into a compact\r\nand solid rock in consequence of the mass being penetrated by water\r\ncontaining carbonate of lime in solution. Crystals of this substance\r\nwere deposited in every cavity and interstice of the mass, and thus\r\nthe accumulation of separate organisms was gradually transformed to a\r\nmaterial of great solidity and hardness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF AMYGDALOIDS.]\r\n\r\nIn precisely the same way loose heaps of scoriæ, lapilli, or pumice\r\nmay, by the passage through them of water containing various substances\r\nin solution, have their vesicles filled with crystals, and thus be\r\nconverted into the hardest and most solid of rock-masses. Similarly\r\nthe scoriaceous portions of lava-streams have their vesicles filled\r\nwith crystalline substances deposited from a state of solution, and\r\nare thus converted into a solid mass which may at first sight appear\r\nto offer but little resemblance to the vesicular materials of recent\r\nlava-streams. To these vesicular rocks which have their cavities filled\r\nwith crystalline substances geologists apply the name of amygdaloids\r\n(_L. amygdalus_, an almond). The cavities in lava-rocks are usually\r\nmore or less elongated, owing to the movement of the mass while in\r\na still plastic state, and the crystalline materials filling these\r\ncavities take the almond-like shape; hence the name.\r\n\r\nWhen the amygdaloids and altered fragmentary ejections of volcanoes\r\nare studied microscopically, their true character is at once made\r\nmanifest. The exposure of faces of these altered volcanic rocks to the\r\nweathering influences of the atmosphere, in many cases also causes\r\ntheir true nature to be revealed, the crystalline materials filling\r\nthe interstices and vesicles of the mass are dissolved away by the\r\nrain-water containing carbonic acid, and the rock regains its original\r\ncavernous structure and appearance. But this repeated passage of water\r\nthrough volcanic rock-masses may result in the removal of so large a\r\nportion of their materials that the remainder crumbles down into the\r\ncondition of a clay or mud.\r\n\r\nIn the basal wrecks of volcanoes, of which we have spoken, we usually\r\nfind only small and fragmentary remains of the great accumulations\r\nof loose and scoriaceous materials which originally constituted the\r\nbulk of the mountain mass. In the centre of the ground-plan of such\r\na denuded volcano we find great masses of highly crystalline or\r\ngranitic rock, which evidently occupy vast fissures broken through\r\nthe sedimentary or other rocks upon which the volcanic pile has been\r\nreared. These highly crystalline rocks exhibit, as we have shown,\r\nclear evidence of having been consolidated from a state of fusion\r\nwith extreme slowness and under enormous pressure, but their ultimate\r\nchemical composition is identical with that of the lavas which have\r\nbeen ejected from the volcano.\r\n\r\nWhen, as frequently happens, the volcano, after pouring out one kind\r\nof lava for a certain period, has changed the nature of its ejections,\r\nand given rise to materials of different composition, we find clear\r\nevidence of the fact in studying the basal wreck or ground-plan of\r\nthe volcano. A great intrusive crystalline mass, of the same chemical\r\ncomposition as the first-extruded lava, is found to be rent asunder and\r\npenetrated by a similarly crystalline mass having the composition of\r\nthe lavas of the second period. Thus, in the volcanoes of the Western\r\nIsles of Scotland, which are reduced by the action of denudation to\r\nthis condition of basal wrecks, we find that rhyolites, trachytes, and\r\nandesites were ejected during the earlier periods of their history, and\r\nbasalts during the later periods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Plan of the Dissected Volcano of Mull, in the\r\nInner Hebrides.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _a_ Rocks on which the Volcano has been built up.\r\n  _b_ Great intrusive masses of acid and intermediate rocks.\r\n  _c_ Lara currents of basalt which have flowed from _d_.\r\n  _d_ Intrusive masses of gabbros & dolerite.\r\n  _e_ Lava currents which have flowed from _b_.\r\n  _f_ Volcanic tuffs and agglomerates.\r\n\r\nFig. 58.--Section of the Volcano along the line _A B_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANCIENT VOLCANO OF MULL.]\r\n\r\nWe perceive on studying the ground-plan of these volcanoes that\r\ngreat masses of granite, syenite, and diorite--the crystalline\r\nrepresentatives of the first-extruded lavas--are penetrated by\r\nintrusions of gabbro--the granitic form of the later-ejected lavas.\r\nThese features are admirably illustrated by the ruined volcano now\r\nconstituting the Island of Mull, one of the Inner Hebrides, a plan\r\nof which is given in fig. 57, and a section in fig. 58. This volcano\r\nprobably had a diameter at its base of nearly thirty miles, and a\r\nheight of from 10,000 to 12,000 feet, but is now reduced to a group of\r\nhills few of which exceed 3,000 feet in height.\r\n\r\nFrom these great intrusive masses of highly crystalline rocks there\r\nproceed in every direction great spurs or dykes, which are evidently\r\nthe radiating fissures formed during the outwelling of igneous\r\nmaterials from below, injected by these fluid substances. The rock\r\nforming these dykes is often less perfectly crystalline than that which\r\nconstitutes the centre of the mass, and we may indeed detect among the\r\nmaterials of these dykes examples of every variety of structure, from\r\nthe perfectly crystalline granite to the more or less glassy substance\r\nof lavas. Besides the vertical or oblique dykes we also find horizontal\r\nsheets, which, passing from these central masses, have penetrated\r\nbetween the surrounding strata, often, as we have seen, to enormous\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of simplicity, we have spoken of these ground-plans, or\r\nbasal wrecks of volcanoes, as constituting a flat plain; as a matter of\r\nfact, however, the unequal hardness of the materials composing volcanic\r\nmountains causes them to assume, under the influence of denuding\r\nagencies, a very rugged and uneven surface. The hard crystalline\r\nmaterials filling the central vent stand up as great mountain groups;\r\neach large dyke, by the removal of the surrounding softer materials, is\r\nleft as a huge wall-like mass, while the remnants of lava-streams are\r\nseen constituting a number of isolated plateaux.\r\n\r\nThe great Island of Skye is the basal wreck of another volcano which\r\nwas also in eruption during Tertiary times; probably, many millions\r\nof years ago. This immense volcano had originally a diameter at its\r\nbase of about thirty miles, and a height of 12,000 to 15,000 feet,\r\nand must have been comparable to Etna or Teneriffe in its dimensions.\r\nAt the present time, there is nothing left of this vast pile but the\r\nhighly crystalline granites and gabbros filling up the great fissures\r\nthrough which the eruption of igneous materials took place. These, worn\r\nby denudation into rounded dome-like masses and wild rugged peaks,\r\nconstitute the Red Mountains and Coolin Hills of Skye, which rise to\r\nthe height of more than 3,000 feet above the sea-level. From these\r\ngreat, central masses of crystalline rocks, innumerable radiating dykes\r\nmay be found rising through the surrounding rock-masses, with isolated\r\npatches of the scoriæ and lapilli ejected from the volcano, which have\r\nhere and there escaped removal by denudation. Along what were the\r\noutskirts of this great mountain-mass are found flat-topped hills,\r\nbuilt up of lava-streams, only small portions of which have escaped\r\nremoval by denudation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RESERVOIRS BENEATH VOLCANOES.]\r\n\r\nBut this wearing away of the structure of a volcanic cone by the\r\ndenuding forces may proceed even one stage farther, and we may then\r\nhave revealed for our inspection and study the mass of originally fluid\r\nmaterials, from which one or more volcanoes have been fed, cooled and\r\nconsolidated in their original reservoir. There are many examples of\r\nmasses of granitic or highly crystalline rocks, having precisely the\r\nsame composition as the different varieties of lavas, which are found\r\nlying in the midst of the sedimentary rocks, and sending off into\r\nthese rocks veins and dykes of the same composition with themselves.\r\nNo one who has carefully studied the appearances presented by volcanic\r\nmountains in different stages of dissection, by the action of denuding\r\nforces, can avoid recognising these great granitic masses as the cooled\r\nreservoirs from which volcanoes have in all probability been supplied\r\nduring earlier periods of the earth's history.\r\n\r\nThe eruption of these great masses of incandescent rock, impregnated\r\nwith water and acid gases, through strata of limestone, sandstone,\r\nclay, coal, &c., may be expected to produce striking and wonderful\r\nchemical changes in the latter. Nor are we disappointed in these\r\nanticipations. Whenever we examine the sedimentary materials around\r\nvolcanic vents, we find that, in contact with the once-fused materials,\r\nthey everywhere exhibit remarkable evidences of the chemical action\r\nto which they have been subjected. The limestones are converted into\r\nstatuary marble, the sandstones pass into quartzite, the days assume\r\nthe hardness and lustre of porcelain, while the coals have lost their\r\nvolatile ingredients and assumed a form like coke or graphite. And\r\nthese changes are found to extend in many cases to the distance of many\r\nhundreds of yards from the planes of junction between the igneous and\r\nthe sedimentary materials.\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting effects resulting from the extrusion of\r\nmasses of incandescent rock, charged with water and various gases,\r\nthrough beds of limestone, clay, sandstone, &c., we may mention the\r\nproduction of those beautiful crystalline minerals which adorn our\r\nmuseums and are so highly prized as gems. By far the larger part of\r\nthese beautiful minerals have been formed, directly or indirectly, by\r\nvolcanic agencies.\r\n\r\nThese gems and beautiful minerals are, for the most part, substances\r\nof every-day occurrence, which entirely owe their beauty to the\r\ncrystalline forms they have assumed. The diamond is crystallised\r\ncarbon, the ruby and sapphire are crystallised alumina, the amethyst\r\nand a host of other gems are crystallised silica; and in almost all\r\ncases the materials of gems are common and widely diffused, it is only\r\nin their finely crystalline condition that they are rare and therefore\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF VOLCANIC MINERALS.]\r\n\r\nCrystals are formed during the slow deposition of a substance, either\r\nby the evaporation of a liquid in which it is dissolved, by its\r\nvolatilisation, or its cooling from a state of fusion. In many cases it\r\ncan be shown that the formation of large and regular crystals is aided\r\nif the work goes on with extreme slowness and under great pressure.\r\nBy sealing up various substances in tubes containing water which can\r\nbe kept at a high temperature, minute crystals of many well-known\r\nminerals have been artificially formed by chemists. Part of the water\r\nconverted into steam has formed a powerful spring, which, reacting\r\nupon the remainder of the liquid in the tube, has subjected it to\r\nenormous pressure, and under these conditions of extreme pressure and\r\ntemperature, chemical actions take place of which we have no experience\r\nunder ordinary circumstances. The experiments of Mr. Hannay seem to\r\nprove that when carbon is separated from certain organic substances\r\nat a high temperature and under great pressure, it may crystallise in\r\nthe form of the diamond. And the recent discovery of diamonds in the\r\nmidst of materials filling old volcanic vents in South Africa seems\r\nto show that this was in many cases the mode in which the gem was\r\noriginated. Even under the conditions which prevail at the earth's\r\nsurface, however, minute and unnoticed chemical actions taking place\r\nduring long periods of time, produce most remarkable results. This has\r\nbeen well illustrated by M. Daubrée, who has shown that in the midst of\r\nmasses of concrete which the Romans built up around the hot springs of\r\nPlombières and other localities, many crystalline minerals have been\r\nformed, in the course of 2,000 years, by the action of the waters upon\r\nthe ingredients of the concrete.\r\n\r\nBut most of the crystals of minerals which have been thus artificially\r\nformed are of minute, indeed often of microscopic, dimensions. In the\r\nunderground reservoirs beneath volcanoes, however, we have all the\r\nnecessary conditions for the formation of crystals of minerals on a\r\nfar grander scale. High temperatures, pressures far greater than any\r\nwe can command at the earth's surface, the action of superheated steam\r\nand many acid gases on the various constituents of both igneous and\r\nsedimentary rocks, and, above all, time of almost unlimited duration;\r\nthese constitute such a set of conditions as may fairly be expected\r\nto result in the formation of crystals, similar to those artificially\r\nproduced but of far greater size and beauty.\r\n\r\nIf we visit those parts of the earth's surface where great masses of\r\nfused volcanic rock have slowly cooled down in contact with sedimentary\r\nmaterials, we shall not be disappointed in our expectations. Diamonds,\r\nrubies, sapphires, emeralds, topazes, garnets, and a host of equally\r\nbeautiful, if less highly prized, crystalline substances, are found in\r\nsuch situations, lying in the subterranean chemical laboratories in\r\nwhich they have been formed, but now, by the action of denuding forces,\r\nrevealed to our view.\r\n\r\nIn some cases it is not necessary to penetrate to these subterranean\r\nlaboratories in order to find these beautiful gems and other\r\ncrystallised minerals; for the steam jets which issue from volcanic\r\nfissures carry up fragments of rock torn from the side of the vent,\r\nand in the cavities and fissures of such ejected masses beautiful\r\ncrystallised products are often found. Such rock-fragments containing\r\nminerals finely crystallised are found abundantly on the flanks of\r\nVesuvius and other active volcanoes, and among the materials of the\r\nLaacher See and other extinct volcanoes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF MINERAL-VEINS.]\r\n\r\nBut it is not only the finely crystallised minerals and gems which\r\nwe owe to volcanic action. The various metallic minerals have nearly\r\nall been brought from deep-seated portions of the earth's crust and\r\ndeposited upon the sides of rock-fissures by the agency of the same\r\nvolcanic forces. It is these forces which have, in the first instance,\r\nopened the cracks through the solid rock masses; and, in the second\r\nplace, have brought the metallic sulphides, oxides, and salts--either\r\nin fusion, in solution, or in a vaporised condition--from the\r\ndeep-seated masses within the earth, causing them to crystallise upon\r\nthe sides of the fissures, and thus form those metallic lodes and veins\r\nwhich are within reach of our mining operations.\r\n\r\nThere is still one other important class of minerals which owe the\r\nexistence, though indirectly, to volcanic agencies. The cavities of\r\nigneous rocks, especially the vesicles formed by the escape of steam,\r\nconstitute, when filled with water, laboratories in which complicated\r\nchemical reactions take place. The materials of the lava are gradually\r\ndissolved and re-crystallised in new combinations. By this means the\r\nmost beautiful examples of such minerals as the agates, the onyxes,\r\nthe rock-crystals, the Iceland-spars, and the numerous beautiful\r\ncrystals classed together as 'Zeolites' have been formed. No one can\r\nvisit a large collection of crystalline minerals without being struck\r\nwith the large number of beautiful substances which have thus been\r\nformed as secondary products from volcanic materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE VARIOUS STRUCTURES BUILT UP AROUND VOLCANIC VENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said in the preceding chapters it will be seen that\r\nwhile some of the materials ejected from volcanic vents are, by the\r\nmovements of the air and ocean, distributed over every part of the\r\nface of the globe, another, and by far the larger, part of the matter\r\nso ejected, accumulates in the immediate vicinity of the vent itself.\r\nBy this accumulation of erupted materials, various structures are\r\nbuilt up around the orifices from which the ejections take place, and\r\nthe size and character of these structures vary greatly in different\r\ncases, according to the quantity and nature of the ejected materials,\r\nand the intensity of the eruptive forces by which they were thrown from\r\nthe orifice. We shall proceed in the present chapter to notice the\r\nchief varieties in the forms and characters of the heaps of materials\r\naccumulated round volcanic vents.\r\n\r\nThese heaps of materials vary in size from masses no bigger than a\r\nmole-heap up to mountains like Etna, Teneriffe, and Chimborazo. The\r\nsize of volcanic mountains is principally determined by the conditions\r\nof the eruptive action at the vent around which they are formed. If\r\nthis action exhausts itself in a single effort, very considerable\r\nvolcanic cones, like the Monte Nuovo with many similar hills in its\r\nvicinity, and the Puys of Auvergne, may be formed; but if repeated\r\neruptions take place at longer or shorter intervals from the same vent,\r\nthere appears to be scarcely any limit to the size of the structures\r\nwhich may, under such conditions, be formed. It is by this repeated\r\naction from the same volcanic vent going on for thousands or even\r\nmillions of years, that the grandest volcanic mountains of the globe\r\nhave been built up. Such volcanoes have sometimes a diameter at their\r\nbase of from 30 to 100 miles, and an elevation of from 10,000 to 25,000\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe _form_ of volcanic mountains is determined in part by the nature\r\nof the materials ejected, and in part by the character of the eruptive\r\naction.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said in the preceding chapter, it will be gathered\r\nthat the volcanoes built up by ejections of fragmentary materials\r\ndiffer in many striking particulars from those formed by the outwelling\r\nof lavas from volcanic vents. In a less degree, the volcanoes composed\r\nof the same kind of volcanic materials also vary among themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARACTERS OF SCORIA-CONES.]\r\n\r\nWhen masses of scoriæ in a semi-fluid condition are thrown to only a\r\nlittle distance above the volcanic vent, so that they have not time to\r\nassume a perfectly solid condition before they fall round the vent, the\r\nrugged masses of lava unite to form heaps of most irregular shape. In\r\nsuch cases, the falling fragments being in a semi-plastic state, stick\r\nto the masses below, and do not tend to roll down the sides of the\r\nheap. Irregular heaps of such volcanic scoriæ abound on the surfaces\r\nof lava-streams, being piled up around each 'bocca' or vent which the\r\nsteam-jets escaping from the lava-currents form at their surfaces.\r\nSuch irregular accumulations of scoriæ were observed on the lavas of\r\nVesuvius during the eruptions of 1822, 1855, and 1872, and have also\r\nbeen described in the case of many other volcanoes. In fig. 26 (p. 101)\r\nwe have given representations of a group of such irregular scoria-cones\r\nwhich was observed by Schmidt on the Vesuvian lava of 1855. It will\r\nbe seen from this drawing that there is scarcely any limit to the\r\nsteepness of the sides of such scoria-heaps, in which the materials are\r\nin an imperfectly solidified condition when they reach the ground.\r\n\r\nBut in the majority of cases, the scoriæ ejected from volcanic vents\r\nare thrown to a great height, and are in a more or less perfectly\r\nsolidified condition when they fell to the ground again. In such cases\r\nthe fragments obey the ordinary mechanical laws of falling bodies,\r\nrolling and sliding over one another, till they acquire a slope which\r\nvaries according to the size and form of the fragments. In this way\r\nthe great conical mounds are formed which are known as 'cinder-cones,'\r\nor more properly as 'scoria-cones.' Scoria-cones usually vary in the\r\nslope of their sides from 35° to 40° and may differ in size from mere\r\nmonticules to hills a thousand feet or more in height. Scoria-cones\r\nof this character abound in many volcanic districts, as the Auvergne,\r\nwhere they may be numbered by thousands. The materials forming such\r\nscoria-cones vary in size from that of a nut to masses as large as a\r\nman's head, and fragments of even larger dimensions are by no means\r\nuncommon.\r\n\r\nWhen the lava in a volcanic vent is perfectly glassy, instead of being\r\npartially crystalline in structure, we find not scoriæ but pumice\r\nejected. In such cases, as in the Lipari Islands for example, we see\r\ncones entirely built up of pumice. Such pumice-cones resemble in\r\nthe angle of their slope (see fig. 41, facing p. 124), the ordinary\r\nscoria-cones, but are of a brilliant white colour, appearing as if\r\ncovered with snow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRESERVATION OF SCORIA-CONES.]\r\n\r\nOrdinary scoriæ are usually of a black colour when first ejected, but\r\nafter a short time the black oxide of iron (magnetite) which they\r\ncontain, attracts the oxygen of the air and moisture, and assumes the\r\nreddish-brown colour of iron-rust. Under such circumstances the heaps\r\nof black material gradually acquire the red-brown colour which is\r\ncharacteristic of so many of the scoria-cones around Etna, and in the\r\nAuvergne and the Eifel. The moisture of the air, and the rain falling\r\nupon these loose cindery heaps, cause them to decompose upon their\r\nsurfaces; the action is facilitated by the growth of the lower forms\r\nof vegetation, such as mosses and lichens, and thus at last a soil is\r\nproduced on the surfaces of these conical piles of loose materials\r\nwhich may support an abundant vegetation. Cinder- or scoria-cones are\r\nnot uncommonly found retaining in a most perfect manner their regular,\r\nconical form, the lips of their craters being sharp and unbroken as if\r\nthe cone were formed but yesterday, while their slopes may nevertheless\r\nbe covered with a rich soil supporting abundant grass and forest-trees.\r\nIt may at first sight seem difficult to understand how a loose mass of\r\nscoriæ could have so long withstood the action of the rain and floods,\r\nretaining so perfectly its even slopes and sharp ridges. A little\r\nconsideration will, however, convince us that it is the very loose and\r\npervious nature of the materials of which scoria-cones are composed,\r\nwhich tends to their perfect preservation. The rain at once sinks into\r\ntheir mass, before it has time to form rivulets and streams which would\r\nwear away their surfaces and destroy the regularity of their outlines.\r\n\r\nScoria- and pumice-cones are frequently found to be acted upon by acid\r\nvapours to such an extent that the whole of the materials is reduced\r\nto a white pulverulent mass. In these cases the oxides of iron and the\r\nalkalis have united with the sulphuric or hydrochloric or carbonic\r\nacids, the compounds being carried away in solution by the rain-water\r\nfalling on the mass; the materials left are silica, the hydrated\r\nsilicate of alumina, and hydrated sulphate of lime (gypsum), all of\r\nwhich are of a white colour.\r\n\r\nCinder- or scoria-cones, and pumice-cones, are often found raised\r\nby the action of winds to a greater elevation on one side than the\r\nother, in the manner already described. One side of the cone is often\r\nseen to be more or less completely swept away by an outwelling stream\r\nof lava, and thus breached cones are formed (see fig. 40, p. 123).\r\nNot unfrequently we find a number of cones which are united more or\r\nless completely at their bases, as in Vulcanello (fig. 6, p. 43), the\r\nseveral vents being so near together that their ejections have mingled\r\nwith one another. Cones composed entirely of fragmentary materials\r\noften show an approach to the beautifully curved slopes which we have\r\ndescribed as being so characteristic of volcanoes, as may be seen in\r\nfig. 41, facing p. 124. In the case of scoria- and pumice-cones this\r\ncurvature is probably due to the rolling downnwards and outwards of the\r\nlarger fragments.\r\n\r\nWe have already pointed out that with the scoriæ there are often\r\nejected fragments torn from the sides of the volcanic vents. Sometimes\r\nsuch fragments are so numerous as to make up a considerable portion of\r\nthe mass of the volcanic cones. Thus in the Eifel we find hills, of\r\nby no means insignificant size, completely built up of small scoriæ\r\nand broken fragments of slate torn from the rocks through which the\r\nvolcanic fissures have been opened. Occasionally we see that few or no\r\nscoriæ have been ejected, and the volcanic vents are surrounded simply\r\nby heaps of burnt slate.\r\n\r\nThe smaller fragmentary materials ejected from volcanic vents--such\r\nas lapilli and dust--rest in heaps, having a different angle of slope\r\nfrom those formed by scoriæ. In many cases, as we have seen, such\r\nfinely-divided materials descend in the condition of mud, which flows\r\nevenly over the surface of the growing cone and consolidates in beds of\r\nvery regularly stratified 'tufa' or 'tuff.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARACTERS OF TUFF-CONES.]\r\n\r\nThe 'tuff-cones' thus formed differ in many important respects from the\r\nscoria-cones already described. The slope of their sides varies from\r\n15° to 30°, and is almost always considerably less than in scoria- and\r\npumice-cones. The tuff-cones undergo much more rapid degradation from\r\nrain and moisture than do the scoria-cones; for, though the materials\r\nof the former 'set,' as we have seen, into a substance of considerable\r\nhardness, yet this substance, being much less pervious to water than\r\nthe loose scoria heaps, permits of the formation of surface-streams\r\nwhich furrow and wear away the sides of the cones. Sometimes the sides\r\nof the crater are found to be almost wholly removed by atmospheric\r\ndenudation, and only a shallow depression is found occupying the\r\nsite of the crater; such a case is represented in fig. 59. We not\r\nunfrequently find the whole slopes of such cones to be traversed by a\r\nseries of radiating grooves passing from the summit to the base of the\r\nmountains, these channels being formed by water, which has collected\r\ninto streams, flowing down the slopes of the mountains. The volcanic\r\ncone, under these circumstances, frequently presents the appearance of\r\na partially opened umbrella. Owing to the impervious character of the\r\nmaterials composing tuff-cones, their craters are frequently found to\r\nbe occupied by lakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--Summit of the volcano of Monte Sant' Angelo in\r\nLipari exhibiting a crater with walls worn down by denudatioh.]\r\n\r\nTufas have usually a white or yellowish-brown colour, and these are the\r\ncolours exhibited by the cones composed of this material before they\r\nbecome covered by vegetation. Tufas scoriæ, and lavas usually crumble\r\ndown to form a very rich soil, and many of the choicest wines are\r\nproduced from grapes grown on the fertile slopes of volcanic mountains.\r\nWhen, however, as not unfrequently happens, the materials are finely\r\ndivided and incoherent, they are so easily driven about by the winds\r\nthat cultivation of any kind is rendered almost impossible. In the\r\nIslands of Stromboli and Vulcano the gardens have to be surrounded by\r\nhigh fences to prevent them from being overwhelmed by the ever-shifting\r\nmasses of volcanic sand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARACTERS OF LAVA-CONES.]\r\n\r\nThere are some cones which are composed in part of scoriæ and in part\r\nof tufa. Hence we are sometimes at a loss whether to group them with\r\nthe one class of cones or the other. But in the majority of cases,\r\nscoria- and tuff-cones present the sufficiently well-marked and\r\ndistinctive characters which we have described.\r\n\r\nLava-cones differ quite as greatly in their forms as do the cones\r\ncomposed of fragmentary materials, the variations being principally\r\ndetermined by the degree of liquidity of the lavas.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes find that outwelling masses of lava, when issuing in small\r\nquantities from a vent, accumulate in cauliflower-shaped masses, or\r\nsometimes in the form of a column, or bottle. Professor J. D. Dana\r\ndescribes many such fantastically-formed masses of lava as being found\r\nin Hawaii, one of which is represented in fig. 25 (p. 100).\r\n\r\nWhen the lava issues from the vent in great quantities it tends to\r\nflow on all sides of it, and to build up a great conical heap above\r\nthe orifice. If the lava be very liquid it flows to great distances,\r\nresting at a very slight slope. Thus we find that the volcanoes of\r\nHawaii have been built up of successive ejections of very liquid lava,\r\nwhich have formed cones having a slope of only 6° to 8°, but of such\r\nenormous dimensions that the diameter of their bases is seventy miles\r\nand their height 14,000 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Outlines of Lava-cones.\r\n\r\n1. Mauna Loa, in Hawaii. Composed of very fluid lava. 3. The\r\nSchlossberg of Teplitz, Bohemia. Composed of very imperfectly fluid or\r\nviscid lava.]\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the lava be viscid, or very imperfectly liquid\r\nin character, it tends to accumulate immediately around the vent; fresh\r\nejections force the first extruded matter outwards, in the manner so\r\nwell illustrated by Dr. Reyer's experiments, and at last a more or less\r\nsteep-sided bulbous mass is formed over the vent. Such bulbous masses,\r\ncomposed of imperfectly fluid lavas, occur in many volcanic districts,\r\nand constitute hills of considerable size. From the tendency of matters\r\nthus extruded to choke up the vents, however, these volcanoes composed\r\nof viscid lavas cannot be expected to attain the vast dimensions\r\nreached by some of those composed of very liquid lavas. The difference\r\nin the forms of lava-cones composed of very fluid or of somewhat\r\nviscid materials is illustrated in fig. 58. When the interior of such\r\nsteep-sided volcanic mountains composed of viscid materials is exposed\r\nby the action of denuding forces, the peculiar internal structure we\r\nhave described is displayed by them. In the Chodi-Berg of Hungary,\r\na great bulbous mass of andesitic rock, this endogenous structure is\r\nadmirably displayed. It is also well seen in the excavation of the hill\r\nof the Grand Sarcoui, a similar mass, composed of altered trachyte,\r\nwhich has been erupted in the midst of a scoria-cone in the Auvergne.\r\nSee fig. 44 (p. 126).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARACTERS OF COMPOSITE CONES.]\r\n\r\nMost of the great volcanic mountains of the globe belong to the\r\nclass of 'composite cones,' and are built up by alternate ejections\r\nof fluid lava and fragmentary materials. The slope of the sides in\r\nsuch composite cones is subject to a wide range of variation, being\r\ndetermined in part by the degree of liquidity of the lavas, in part\r\nby the nature of the fragmentary materials ejected, and in part by\r\nthe proportions which the fragmentary and lava-ejections bear to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nBut there is another set of causes which tends to modify the form\r\nand character of these composite, volcanic cones. As we have already\r\npointed out, the sides of such cones are liable to be rent asunder from\r\ntime to time, and the fissures so produced are injected with masses of\r\nliquid lava from below. These fissures, rent in the sides of volcanic\r\ncones, often reach the surface and eruptive action takes place, giving\r\nrise to the formation of a cone, or series of cones, upon the line\r\nof the fissure (fig. 61). Such small cones thrown up on the flanks\r\nof a great volcanic mountain are known as 'parasitic cones'; though\r\nsubordinate to the great mountain mass, they may be in themselves of\r\nconsiderable dimensions. Among the hundreds of parasitic cones which\r\nstud the flanks of Etna, there are some which are nearly 800 feet in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--Diagram illustrating the formation of\r\nParasitic Cones along lines of fissure formed on the flanks of a great\r\nvolcanic mountain.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--Outline of Etna, as seen from Catania.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF PARASITIC CONES.]\r\n\r\nThe building up of parasitic cones upon the flanks of a volcanic\r\nmountain tends, of course, to destroy its regular conical form. This\r\nmay be well seen in Etna, which, by the accumulation of materials\r\nupon its flanks, has become a remarkably 'round-shouldered' mountain.\r\n(See figs. 62 and 63.) At the same time it must be remembered that\r\nmaterials erupted from the central vent tend to fill up the hollows\r\nbetween these parasitic cones, and thus to restore to the mountain its\r\nregularly conical form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--Outline of Etna, as seen from the Val del\r\nBronte.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--Plan of the Volcano forming the Island of\r\nIschia.\r\n\r\n  _a, a, a._ The semi-circular crater-ring of Epomeo.\r\n  _b, c, d._ Lava-currents which have flowed from the principal crater.\r\n  _e, f, g, h._ Plateaux formed by ancient lava-currents.\r\n  _k._ Montagnone.    }\r\n  _l._ Monte Rotaro.  }\r\n  _m._ Monte Tabor.   } Parasitic cones and craters on the slopes\r\n  _n._ Castiglione.   }   of the mountain.\r\n  _o._ Lago di Bagno. }\r\n  _p._ The Cremate.   }\r\n  _r._ Lava-stream of the Arso, which flowed from the Cremate in 1301.\r\n  _x, x, x._ Raised beaches on the shores of the island, showing that it\r\n     has recently undergone elevation.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Island of Ischia is a good example of a great volcanic cone the\r\nflanks of which are covered with numerous small parasitic cones. While\r\nthe great central volcano has evidently been long extinct, and one\r\nside of its crater-wall is completely broken down, some of the small\r\nparasitic cones around its base have been formed within the historical\r\nperiod--one of them as recently as the year 1302. Fig. 64 is a plan of\r\nthe Island of Ischia, showing the numerous parasitic cones scattered\r\nover the slopes of the principal cone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig, 65.--A primary Parasitic Cone with a secondary one\r\nat its base--Ischia.\r\n\r\n_a._ Monte Rotaro. _b._ Monte Tabor. _c._ Lava-stream flowing from the\r\nlatter.]\r\n\r\nIn one case we find that a parasitic cone, the Monte Rotaro, has itself\r\na similar smaller cone, which is parasitic to it, at its foot; this\r\nsecondary parasitic cone gives off a small lava-stream of trachyte,\r\nwhich has flowed down to the sea. (See fig. 65.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Scoria-cone near Auckland, New Zealand, with a\r\nlava-current flowing from it.\r\n\r\nThe strata beneath the volcanic cone are exposed in the sea-cliff, and\r\nexhibit proofs of depression having taken place.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--Section of rocks below the ancient triassic\r\nvolcano of Predazzo in the Tyrol.\r\n\r\nThe position of the strata _a b c_, etc., indicates a central\r\nsubsidence.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUBSIDENCE BENEATH VOLCANIC VENTS.]\r\n\r\nMost great volcanic mountains exhibit a tendency towards a subsidence\r\nof their central portions, which may take place either during or\r\nsubsequently to their period of activity. When we examine the strata\r\nupon which a volcano has been built up, but which are now exposed to\r\nour study by denuding forces, we usually find that they incline towards\r\nthe centre of the eruptive activity. (See figs. 66 and 67.) Two causes\r\nmay contribute to bring about this result. In the first instance,\r\nwe must remark that the piling up of materials around the volcanic\r\nvent causes the subjacent strata to be subjected to a degree of\r\npressure far is excess of that which acts upon the surrounding rocks.\r\nAnd secondly, it must be borne in mind that the continual removal\r\nof material from below the mountain must tend to the production of\r\nhollows, into which the overlying strata will sink. The effect of this\r\ncentral subsidence is to give to the flanks of volcanic cones those\r\nbeautifully curved outlines which constitute so striking a feature in\r\nVesuvius (see fig. 17, p. 87), Fusiyama (see fig. 77, No. 1, facing p.\r\n178), and many other volcanic mountains.\r\n\r\nThere seems, at first sight, to be scarcely any limit to the dimensions\r\nwhich these great composite volcanic cones may attain: the lateral\r\neruptions tending to enlarge the area of the base of the mountain,\r\nand, by the injection of the fissures, to knit together and strengthen\r\nits structure, while the central eruptions continually increase the\r\nelevation of the mass. Great, however, as is the force which is\r\nconcerned in the production of our terrestrial volcanoes, it has its\r\nlimits; and, at last, the piling up of materials will have gone on\r\nto such an extent, that the active forces beneath the volcano are no\r\nlonger competent either to raise materials to the elevated summit of\r\nthe mountain or to tear asunder its strengthened and fortified flanks.\r\nUnder these circumstances, the volcanic forces, if they have not\r\nalready exhausted themselves, will be compelled to find weak places in\r\nthe district surrounding the volcano, at which fissures may be produced\r\nand the phenomena of eruption displayed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHIFTING OF VOLCANIC FOCI.]\r\n\r\nSome volcanic cones exhibit evidence that during the series of\r\neruptions by which they have gradually been built up, the centre of\r\nvolcanic action has shifted to another point within the mountain. Thus\r\nLyell has shown, in the case of Etna, that during the earlier periods\r\nin the history of the mountain the piling up of materials went on\r\naround a centre which is now situated at a distance of nearly four\r\nmiles from the present focus of eruptive activity. Some of our old\r\nBritish volcanoes, of which the denuded wrecks exist in the Western\r\nIsles of Scotland, show similar evidence of a shifting of the axis of\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nOne of the most conspicuous features of a volcanic cone is the great\r\ndepression or crater found at its summit. In describing the internal\r\nstructure of volcanic cones, we have seen how these craters are\r\nproduced and acquire their inverted conical form, by the slipping and\r\nrolling back of materials towards the centre of eruptive action.\r\n\r\nAlmost all volcanic cones exhibit craters, but in those which are\r\nformed entirely by the outwelling of viscid lavas the central\r\ndepression is often slight and inconspicuous, and occasionally\r\naltogether wanting. It frequently happens, however, that eruptive\r\naction has ceased at the centre of a volcano, and its summit-crater\r\nmay by denudation be entirely destroyed, while new and active craters\r\nare formed upon its flanks. Stromboli furnishes us with an admirable\r\nexample of this kind (see fig. 1, facing p. 10). Other volcanoes may\r\nexhibit several craters, one at the summit of the mountain and others\r\nupon its flanks. Of this we find a good example in Vulcano (fig. 6, p.\r\n43).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--Cotopaxi (19,600 feet), as seen from a\r\ndistance of ninety miles.]\r\n\r\nWhen a volcano has been built up by regular and continuous eruptions\r\nfrom the same volcanic vent, the size of the crater remains the same,\r\nwhile the volcano continually grows in height and in the diameter of\r\nits base. The size of the crater will be determined by the eruptive\r\nforce at the volcanic centre, the size of the mountain by the duration\r\nof the volcanic activity and the quantity of material ejected. In the\r\nearliest stage of its history, such a volcano will resemble Monte\r\nNuovo, which has a crater reaching down almost to the base of the\r\nmountain; in the later stages of its history, such a volcano will\r\nresemble Cotopaxi (fig. 68) and Citlaltepetl (fig. 69), in which the\r\ncrater, though of far greater absolute dimensions than that of Monte\r\nNuovo, bears but a small proportion to the vast cone at the summit of\r\nwhich it is situated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--Citlaltepetl, or the Pic d'Orizaba, in Mexico\r\n(17,370 feet), as seem from the forest of Xalapa.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORIGIN OF VOLCANIC CRATERS.]\r\n\r\nIn the great majority of volcanoes, however, eruptive action does not\r\ngo on by any means regularly and continuously, but terrible paroxysmal\r\noutbursts occur, which suddenly enlarge the dimensions of the crater to\r\nan enormous extent.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1772, there occurred a volcanic eruption in the Island\r\nof Java, which is perhaps the most violent and terrible that has\r\nhappened within the historical period. A lofty volcanic cone, called\r\nPapandayang, 9,000 feet high, burst into eruption, and, in a single\r\nnight, 30,000,000,000 cubic feet of materials were thrown into the\r\natmosphere, falling upon the country around the mountain where no less\r\nthan forty villages were buried. After the eruption, the volcano was\r\nfound to have been reduced in height from 9,000 to 5,000 feet, and\r\nto present a vast crater in its midst, which had been formed by the\r\nejection of the enormous mass of materials.\r\n\r\nMany similar cases might be cited of the removal of a great part of a\r\nmountain-mass by a sudden, paroxysmal outburst. In some cases, indeed,\r\nthe whole mass of a mountain has been blown away during a terrific\r\neruption, and the site of the mountain is now occupied by a lake. This\r\nis said to have been the case with the Island of Timor, where an active\r\nvolcano, which was visible from a distance of 300 miles at sea, has\r\nentirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the central portion of great volcanic mountains by\r\nexplosive action, gives rise to the formation of those vast, circular,\r\ncrater-rings of which such remarkable examples occur in many volcanic\r\ndistricts. These crater-rings present a wall with an outer slope\r\nagreeing with that of the volcanic cone of which they originally formed\r\na part, but with steep inner cliffs, which exhibit good sections of the\r\nbeds of tuff, ash, and lava with the intersecting dykes of which the\r\noriginal volcano was built up. Near Naples, one of these crater-rings,\r\nwith sloping outer sides and steep inner ones, is employed to form the\r\nroyal game-preserve of Astroni, the only entrance to the crater being\r\nclosed by gates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF CRATER-LAKES.]\r\n\r\nAs these crater-rings are usually composed of materials more or\r\nless impervious to water, they often become the site of lakes. The\r\nbeautiful circular lake of Laach, in the Rhine Provinces, with the\r\nnumerous similar examples of Central Italy--Albano, Nemi, Bracciano,\r\nand Bolsena--the lakes of the Campi Phlegræi (Agnano, Avernus, &c.),\r\nand some similar lakes in the Auvergne, may be adduced as examples of\r\ncrater-rings which have become the site of lakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--Lac Paven, in the Auvergne.\r\n\r\n_a._ Scoriæ. _b._ Basalt.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most beautiful of the crater-lakes in the Auvergne is\r\nLac Paven (fig. 70), which lies at the foot of a scoria-cone, Mont\r\nChalme, and is itself surrounded by masses of ejected materials. The\r\ncrater-lake of Bagno, in Ischia (fig. 71), has had a channel cut\r\nbetween it and the sea, so that it serves as a natural harbour. The\r\nlake of Gustavila, in Mexico (fig. 72), is an example of a crater-lake\r\non a much larger scale.\r\n\r\nIn many of these crater-rings the diameter of the circular space\r\nenclosed by them is often very great indeed as compared with the height\r\nof the walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--The crater-lake called Lago del Bagno, in\r\nIschia, converted into a harbour.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.--Lake of Gustavila, in Mexico.\r\n\r\n(The terraces round the lake have been artificially formed.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIMENSIONS OF CRATER-LAKES.]\r\n\r\nTwo of the largest crater-rings in the world are found in Central\r\nItaly, and are both occupied by lakes, the circular forms of which\r\nmust strike every observer. The Lago di Bracciano, which lies to\r\nthe north-west of Rome, is a circular lake six and a half miles in\r\ndiameter, surrounded by hills which at their highest point rise to the\r\nheight of 1,486 feet above the sea, while the surface of the waters\r\nof the lake is 640 feet above the sea-level. The Lago di Bolsena is\r\nsomewhat less perfectly circular in outline than the Lago di Bracciano;\r\nit has a length from north to south of ten-and-a-quarter miles and a\r\nbreadth from east to west of nine miles; the surface of the waters of\r\nthis lake is 962 feet above that of the waters of the Mediterranean.\r\nThe lake of Bolsena, like that of Bracciano, is surrounded by hills\r\ncomposed of volcanic materials; the highest points of this ring of\r\nhills rise to elevations of 684, 780, and 985 feet respectively above\r\nthe waters of the lake.\r\n\r\nIn these great circular lakes of Bolsena and Bracciano, as well as in\r\nthe smaller ones of Albano, Nemi, and the lakes of Frascati in the same\r\ndistrict, the vast circular spaces enclosed by them, the gradual outer\r\nslope of the ring, and the inner precipices which bound the lake, all\r\nafford evidence of the explosive action to which they owe their origin.\r\n\r\nBut while the vast crater-rings we have mentioned are frequently found\r\nto be occupied by lakes, there are many other similar crater-rings\r\nwhich remain dry, either from the materials of which they are composed\r\nbeing of more pervious character, or from rivers having cut a channel\r\nthrough the walls of the crater, in this way draining off its waters.\r\n\r\nThus in the Campi Phlegræi, while we have the craters of Agnano and\r\nAvernus forming complete circular lakes, Astroni has only a few\r\ninsignificant lakelets on its floor, and the Pianura, the Piano di\r\nQuarto, which have each a diameter of three or four miles, with many\r\nothers, remain perfectly dry. In the vicinity of the great crater-lakes\r\nof Central Italy we find the crater-ring of the Vallariccia, which has\r\nevidently once been a lake but is now drained, its floor being covered\r\nwith villages and vineyards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CRATER-RINGS SURROUNDING CONES.]\r\n\r\nA comparison of these vast crater-rings leads us to the conclusion that\r\nin the majority of cases, if not in every instance, they are composed\r\nalmost entirely of volcanic tuff and dust. In the case of the more\r\nsolidly-built composite volcanic cones, the volcanic forces, as we have\r\nseen, produce fissures in the mass, and along these fissures parasitic\r\ncones are thrown up, the tension of the mass of imprisoned vapours\r\nbelow the mountain being thus from time to time relieved. But in the\r\ncase of a volcanic cone composed of loose fragmentary materials, such\r\ntemporary relief is impossible. The cracks, as soon as they originate,\r\nwill be filled up and choked by the falling in of materials from above\r\nand at their sides. In this way the eruptive action will be continually\r\nrepressed, till at last the imprisoned vapours acquire such a high\r\nstate of tension that the outburst, when it occurs, is of the most\r\nterrible character, and the whole central mass of the volcano is blown\r\ninto the air. It may often seem surprising that the ejection of such\r\nvast masses of material from the centre of a volcanic cone does not\r\neffect more in the way of raising the height of the crater-walls. But\r\nit must be remembered that, in the case of craters of such vast area,\r\nthe majority of the ejected materials must fall back again within\r\nits circumference. By repeated ejections these materials will at last\r\nbe reduced to such an extreme state of comminution that they can be\r\nborne away by the winds, and spread over the country to the distance of\r\nhundreds or thousands of miles. After great volcanic outbursts enormous\r\nareas are thus found covered with fine volcanic dust to the depth of\r\nmany inches or feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.--Peak of Teneriffe in the Canary Islands\r\n(12,182 ft.), surrounded by great crater-rings.]\r\n\r\nSometimes, as in the case of the Lago di Bracciano, the eruptive forces\r\nappear to have entirely exhausted themselves in the prodigious outburst\r\nby which the great crater was produced. But in other cases, as in that\r\nof the Lago di Bolsena, the eruptive action was resumed at a later\r\ndate, and small tuff-cones were thrown up upon the floor of the crater;\r\nthese now rise as islands above the surface of the lake. In other\r\ncases, again, the eruptive action was resumed after the formation of\r\nthe great crater-ring, with such effect that bulky volcanic cones were\r\nbuilt up in the midst of the crater-ring which surrounds them like a\r\nvast wall; examples of this are exhibited in the extinct volcanoes of\r\nRocca Monfina and Monte Albano. Some of the grandest volcanoes of the\r\nglobe, such as Teneriffe (fig. 73), the volcanoes of Mauritius and\r\nBourbon (figs. 74 and 75), and many others that might be cited, are\r\nthus found to be surrounded by vast crater-rings. Vesuvius itself is\r\nsurrounded by the crater-ring of Somma (fig. 76).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--The volcano of Bourbon, rising in the midst of\r\na crater-ring four miles in diameter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--The volcano of Bourbon, as seen from another\r\npoint of view, with three concentric crater-rings encircling its base.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BASALTIC CONES IN TRACHYTIC CRATER-RINGS.]\r\n\r\nThis formation of cone within crater, often many times repeated, is\r\nvery characteristic of volcanoes. The craters mark sudden and violent\r\nparoxysmal outbursts, the cones are the result of more moderate but\r\nlong-continued ejection. Sometimes, as at Vesuvius in 1767 (fig. 15,\r\np. 85), we find a nest of craters and cones which very strikingly\r\nexemplifies this kind of action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--Vesuvius, as seen from Sorrento, half\r\nencircled by the crater-ring of Somma.]\r\n\r\nWe shall point out, hereafter, that at most volcanic centres the\r\nejection of trachytic lavas precedes that of the basaltic lavas. Now it\r\nis these trachytic lavas which principally give rise to the formation\r\nof the light lapilli of which tuff-cones are formed. Hence it is that\r\nwe so frequently find, as in the case of Vesuvius, Rocca-Monfina, and\r\nmany other volcanoes, that a great crater-ring, largely composed of\r\ntuffs, encloses a cone built up of more basic lavas.\r\n\r\nIn fig. 77 we have shown by a series of outline sections the various\r\nforms assumed by volcanoes in consequence of the different kinds of\r\neruptive action going on in them:--\r\n\r\n1. Is an outline of Fusiyama, an almost perfect cone, with a small\r\ncrater at its summit. The sides of this volcano admirably illustrate\r\nthe beautiful double curves characteristic of volcanic cones.\r\n\r\n2.

Vulcano, in the Lipari Islands, in which, by the shifting of the\r\ncentre of volcanic activity along a line of fissure, a series of\r\noverlapping volcanic cones has been produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--Outlines of various Volcanoes, illustrating\r\nthe different relations of the craters to cones.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUBMARINE VOLCANOES.]\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of the varieties of form assumed by volcanic cones and\r\ncraters, we must not forget to notice the effects which are produced\r\nby denuding forces upon them. In the case of submarine volcanoes, like\r\nthe celebrated island called by the English Graham Isle, by the French\r\nIsle Julie, and by the Germans the Insel Ferdinandez (fig. 78), which\r\nwas thrown up off the coast of Sicily in 1831, it was evident that\r\nvolcanic outbursts taking place at some depth below the level of the\r\nsea gradually piled up a cone of scoriæ with a crater in its midst.\r\nBy constant accessions to its mass, this scoria-cone was eventually\r\nraised above the sea-level, but the action of the waves upon the loose\r\nmaterials soon destroyed the crater-walls and eventually reduced the\r\nisland to a shoal. It is evident that in all cases in which eruptions\r\ntake place beneath the sea-level, and the loose materials are exposed\r\nduring their accumulation to the beating of the sea-waves, the form\r\nof the volcanic cone so produced will be greatly modified by the\r\ninteraction of the two sets of opposed causes, the eruptive forces from\r\nbelow and the distributive action of the sea-waves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.--Island thrown up in the Mediterranean Sea in\r\nJuly and August 1881.\r\n\r\n(The view was taken in the month of September, after the sides of the\r\ncrater had been washed away by the waves.)]\r\n\r\nCraters when once formed are often rent across, along the line of the\r\nfissure above which they are thrown up. Thus the crater of Vesuvius was\r\nin 1872 rent completely asunder on one side, so that it was possible\r\nto climb through the fissure thus produced and reach the bottom of the\r\ncrater. Streams flowing down the sides of the crater, and escaping\r\nthrough such a rent, may in the end greatly modify the form and\r\ndisguise the characters of a volcanic crater. Of this kind of action we\r\nhave a striking example in the Val del Bove of Etna.\r\n\r\nVolcanoes, as we shall point out in the sequel, are after their\r\nextinction frequently submerged beneath the waters of the ocean. The\r\nsea entering the craters, eats back their cliff-like sides and enlarges\r\ntheir areas. Such denuded waters are called 'calderas,' the channels\r\ninto them 'barrancos.'\r\n\r\nSometimes the action of the waves upon a partially submerged volcano\r\nhas led to the cutting back of its slopes into steep cliffs, at the\r\nsame time that the crater-ring is enlarged. In such cases we have left\r\na more or less complete rocky ring, composed of alternating lavas and\r\nfragmentary materials. Of such a ruined crater-ring, the Island of St.\r\nPaul in the South Atlantic affords an admirable example.\r\n\r\nWhen the action of denudation has gone still further, all the lavas and\r\ntuffs composing the cone may be completely removed and nothing left but\r\nmasses of the hard and highly-crystalline rocks which have cooled down\r\nslowly in the heart of the volcano. An example of this kind is afforded\r\nto us by St. Kilda, the remotest member of the British Archipelago.\r\n\r\nBut although the majority of volcanic craters are clearly formed by\r\nexplosive action, there are some craters, like those of Kilauea in\r\nHawaii, which probably owe their origin to quite a different set of\r\ncauses. In this case the explosive action at the vent is but slight,\r\nand the crater, which is of very irregular form, appears to have\r\noriginated in a fissure, which has been slowly enlarged by the liquid\r\nlavas encroaching upon and eating away its sides. Such craters as\r\nthese, however, appear to be comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nBesides the great volcanic mountains composed of lava, scoriæ, tuff and\r\nash, there are other structures which are formed around volcanic vents\r\neven when these do not eject molten rock-masses. The water which issues\r\nin these cases either as steam or in a more or less highly heated\r\ncondition frequently carries materials in suspension or solution, and\r\nthese sometimes accumulate in considerable quantities around the vent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF MUD-VOLCANOES.]\r\n\r\nWhen fissures are formed in the midst of loose argillaceous materials,\r\nsuch as are frequently produced by the decomposition of volcanic rocks,\r\nthe waters which issue through them are sometimes so charged with muddy\r\nmatter that this accumulates to form cones having all the general\r\ncharacters of volcanic mountains, and which occasionally rise to the\r\nheight of 250 feet. The gases and vapours which issue from these\r\n'mud-volcanoes' are those which are known to be emitted from volcanic\r\nvents at which the action going on is not very intense. Daubeny and\r\nothers have suggested that these mud-volcanoes may be the result of\r\nactions which have little or no analogy with those which take place\r\nat ordinary volcanic vents, and that the combustion of subterranean\r\nbeds of sulphur and similar causes would be quite competent to their\r\nproduction. But inasmuch as these mud-volcanoes are almost always\r\nsituated in regions in which the more powerful volcanic action has\r\nonly recently died away, and the gases and vapours emitted by them are\r\nvery similar in character to those which issue from volcanoes, there\r\ndoes not appear to be any good reason for doubting that they should be\r\nclassed as truly volcanic phenomena.\r\n\r\nMud-volcanoes are found in Northern Italy near Modena, in Sicily near\r\nGirgenti, on the shores of the Sea of Azof and the Caspian, in Central\r\nAmerica, and in other parts of the globe. The gas frequently escapes\r\nfrom them with such violence that mud is thrown into the air to the\r\nheight of several hundreds of feet. Sometimes this gas is inflammable,\r\nconsisting of sulphuretted hydrogen, hydrogen, or some hydrocarbons,\r\nand these gases occasionally take fire, so that true flames issue from\r\nthese mud-volcanoes. In other cases the mud-volcanoes appear to be\r\nformed by either hot or cold springs containing large quantities of\r\nsuspended materials, and the liquid mud issues from the vent without\r\nany violent eruptive action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.--Sinter-cones surrounding the orifices of\r\nGeysers.\r\n\r\n1.

(2, 3, 4 and 5 are in\r\nthe Yellowstone Park district of the Rocky Mountains.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF SINTER-CONES.]\r\n\r\nThe soluble materials which waters issuing from volcanic vents deposit\r\non their sides are chiefly silica and carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nHot springs, whether intermittent or constant, often contain large\r\nquantities of silica in solution. The solution of this silica is\r\neffected, at the moment of its separation from combination with the\r\nalkali or alkaline earths, during the decomposition of volcanic rocks,\r\nand is favoured by the presence of alkaline carbonates in the water,\r\nand the high temperature and the pressure under which it exists in the\r\nsubterranean regions. When the water reaches the surface and, being\r\nrelieved from pressure, begins to cool down the silica is deposited.\r\nBy this deposited silica the basins around the geysers of Iceland are\r\nformed. Sometimes conical structures are built up around the vents of\r\nhot springs by the deposition of silica from their waters. Examples\r\nof this kind abound in the National Park of Colorado, where they have\r\nreceived fanciful names, such as the Beehive, Liberty Gap, &c. This\r\ndeposited silica is known to geologists as sinter. The forms of some of\r\nthe structures which surround the orifices of geysers is shown in fig.\r\n79. The 'Liberty Cap' is an extinct geyser-cone fifty feet high and\r\ntwenty feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nHot and cold springs rising in volcanic regions are often highly\r\ncharged with carbonic acid, and in passing through calcareous rocks\r\ndissolve large quantities of carbonate of lime. Upon exposure to the\r\natmosphere, the free carbonic acid escapes and the carbonate of lime\r\nis deposited in the form known as 'travertine.' Such springs occur\r\nin great numbers in many volcanic regions. In the Auvergne great\r\nrock-masses occur formed of carbonate of lime deposited from a state\r\nof solution and taking the form of natural aqueducts and bridges. In\r\nCarlsbad the numerous hot springs have deposited masses of pisolitic\r\nrock (Strudelstein) which have filled up the whole bottom of the\r\nvalley, and upon these deposits the town itself is mainly built.\r\nIn Central Italy the deposits of travertine formed by calcareous\r\nsprings are of enormous extent and thickness: St. Peter's and all the\r\nprincipal buildings of Rome being constructed of this travertine or\r\n'Tibur-stone.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF SINTER-TERRACES.]\r\n\r\nWhen springs charged with silica or carbonate of lime rise upon the\r\nslope of a hill composed of loose volcanic materials, they give rise\r\nto the remarkable structures known as sinter- and travertine-terraces\r\n(see fig. 80). The water flowing downwards from the vent forms a\r\nhard deposit upon the lower slope of the hill, while the continual\r\ndeposition of solid materials within the vent tends to choke it up.\r\nAs a new vent cannot be forced by the waters through the hard rock\r\nformed below, it is originated a little higher up. Thus the site of the\r\nspring is gradually shifted farther and farther back into the hill. As\r\ndeposition takes place along the surfaces over which this water flows,\r\nterraces are built up enclosing basins. Of structures of this kind we\r\nhave remarkable examples in the sinter-terraces of Rotomahana in New\r\nZealand and the travertine-terraces of the Gardiner's River in the\r\nYellowstone Park district of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.--Diagram illustrating the mode of formation of\r\nTravertine and Sinter Terraces on the sides of a hill of tuff.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE SUCCESSION OF OPERATIONS TAKING PLACE AT VOLCANIC CENTRES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat a volcanic vent, when once established, may display intense\r\nactivity during enormous periods of time, there cannot be the smallest\r\nreason for doubting; for the accumulation of materials around some\r\nexisting volcanic centres must certainly have been going on during\r\nmany thousands, perhaps millions, of years. To us, whose periods of\r\nobservation are so circumscribed, it may therefore at first sight\r\nappear a hopeless task to trace the 'life-history of a volcano,' to\r\ndiscover the stages of its development, and to indicate the various\r\nepisodes which have occurred during the long periods it has been in\r\nexistence. But when it is remembered that we have the opportunity of\r\nstudying and comparing hundreds of such volcanoes, exhibiting every\r\nvarying phase of their development, we shall see that such an attempt\r\nis by no means so unpromising as it at first sight appears to be. In\r\nthe present chapter, we shall give an account of the results which have\r\nalready been obtained by inquiries directed to this object.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CYCLES OF VOLCANIC PHENOMENA.]\r\n\r\nThere is not the smallest room for doubt that during the past history\r\nof our globe, exhibitions of subterranean energy have occurred at many\r\ndifferent parts of its surface. There is further evidence that at the\r\nseveral sites where these displays of the volcanic forces have taken\r\nplace, the succession of the outbursts has run through a regular cycle,\r\ngradually increasing in intensity to a maximum, and then as gradually\r\ndying away.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will show that the first portion of this cycle\r\nof events is the one which it is most difficult to examine and study.\r\nThe products of the earlier and feeble displays of volcanic activity,\r\nat any particular centre, are liable to be destroyed, or masked, during\r\nthe ejection of overwhelming masses of materials in the later stages\r\nof its more matured energy. That the feeble displays of volcanic\r\nforce now exhibited in some localities will gradually increase in\r\nintensity in the future, and eventually reach the grandest stage of\r\ndevelopment, there can be no reason for doubting. But, unfortunately,\r\nwe are quite unable to discriminate these feeble manifestations, which\r\nare the embryonic stages in the development of grand exhibitions of\r\nthe volcanic forces, from slight outbursts which die away and make no\r\nfarther sign.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been proved concerning the true nature of volcanic\r\naction, however, it is certain that the first step towards the\r\nexhibition of such action, at any particular locality, must be the\r\nproduction of an aperture in the earth's crust. Only by means of\r\nsuch an aperture can the vapours, gases, and rocky materials reach\r\nthe surface, and give rise to the phenomena there displayed. There is\r\nreason to believe that all such apertures are really of the nature of\r\nfissures, or cracks, which have been opened through the superjacent\r\nstrata by the efforts of the repressed subterranean forces.\r\n\r\nSome recent writers have, it is true, endeavoured to draw a distinction\r\nbetween what they call 'fissure-eruptions,' and eruptions taking\r\nplace from volcanic cones. But all volcanic outbursts are truly\r\n'fissure-eruptions'--the subterranean materials finding their way to\r\nthe surface through great cracks, which, in a more or less vertical\r\nposition, traverse the overlying rock-masses. It is true that in many\r\ncases portions of these cracks soon get choked up, while other portions\r\nbecome widened, and the volcanic energy is concentrated at such spots.\r\nThus the materials ejected from these fissures are usually emitted in\r\ngreatest quantities at one or more points along the fissure, and a\r\nsingle great volcanic vent, or a row of smaller vents, is established\r\nupon the line at which the fissure reaches the surface.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the amount of explosive action taking place at\r\ndifferent volcanic vents varies according to the proportion of\r\nimprisoned water contained in the lava. In the cases where there is\r\nmuch explosive action, vast accumulations of scoriæ, lapilli, and\r\ndust take place, and cones of great size are built up; but in those\r\ncases where the explosive action is small the lavas flow quietly from\r\nthe vent, and only small scoriæ-cones are thrown up, these being\r\nprobably soon swept away by the lava-currents themselves or by denuding\r\nagencies. But both kinds of eruption have equal claims to be called\r\n'fissure-eruptions.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF VOLCANIC FISSURES.]\r\n\r\nIn the expansive force of great masses of imprisoned vapour, we have\r\na competent cause for the production of the fissures through which\r\nvolcanic outbursts take place. Such fissures are found traversing the\r\nrocks lying above volcanic foci, and often extending to distances of\r\nmany miles, or even hundreds of miles, from the centres of activity.\r\nSome of these cracks are found to be injected with fused materials from\r\nbelow, others have been more or less completely filled with various\r\nminerals that have been volatilized, or carried by superheated waters\r\nfrom the deeper regions of the earth's crust. That many of the cracks\r\nthus produced in the superjacent rocks, by the heaving forces of\r\nimprisoned vapour seeking to escape, never reached the surface, we have\r\nsufficient proof in many mining regions.\r\n\r\nIf we now transfer our attention from the deeper portions of the\r\nearth's crust to the surface, we can well understand how the attempts\r\nof the imprisoned vapours to force a passage for themselves through the\r\nsolid rock-masses would lead to shocks and jars among the latter. Each\r\nof these shocks or jars would give rise, in the surrounding portions\r\nof the earth's crust, to those vibrations which we know as earthquakes.\r\nThe close connection between most earthquakes and volcanic phenomena is\r\na fact that does not admit of the smallest doubt; and though it would\r\nbe rash to define all earthquakes as 'uncompleted efforts to establish\r\na volcano,' yet, in the efforts of the repressed subterranean forces to\r\nfind a vent by the production of fissures in the overlying rock-masses,\r\nwe have a cause competent to the production of those shocks which are\r\ntransmitted to such enormous distances as waves of elastic compression.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the production of the fissure upon which the small\r\nvolcano of Monte Nuovo was thrown up was preceded by a succession\r\nof earthquakes, which for a period of over two years terrified the\r\ninhabitants of the district, and might have warned them of the\r\ncoming event. In the same manner, doubtless, the period before the\r\nappearance of volcanic phenomena in a new area would be marked by\r\npowerful subterranean disturbances within it, due to the efforts of the\r\nimprisoned vapours to force for themselves a channel to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NATURE OF FIRST EJECTIONS FROM FISSURES.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of Monte Nuovo, we have seen that the fissure, when\r\nproduced, emitted water--at first in a cold, then in a boiling\r\ncondition--and, eventually, steam and scoriæ. It is probable that\r\nthrough the first cracks which reached the surface, during the heaving\r\nof the subterranean forces, water, charged with carbonic acid, flowed\r\nabundantly, and that these cold springs, charged with carbonic acid\r\nand carbonate of lime, would be succeeded by others which were hot\r\nand contained silica in solution. In Hungary, the Western Isles of\r\nScotland, and many other volcanic districts, we find abundant evidence\r\nthat, before the eruption of lavas in the area, great masses of\r\ntravertine and siliceous sinter were formed by the action of cold and\r\nhot springs.\r\n\r\nAs the volcanic action became more intense by the more perfect opening\r\nof the fissures, the evolution of carbonic add gas would be succeeded\r\nby the appearance of sulphurous acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, boracic\r\nacid, and hydrochloric acid, which recent studies have shown to be\r\nsuccessively emitted from volcanic vents as the temperature within them\r\nrises. At last lava or molten rock becomes visible within the fissures,\r\nand the ejection of the frothy masses--scoriæ, pumice, lapilli and\r\ndust--commences, and this is sometimes succeeded by the outflow of\r\ncurrents of lava.\r\n\r\nThat volcanoes originate upon lines of fissure in the earth's crust\r\nwe have the most convincing proofs. Not only have such fissures been\r\nseen in actual course of formation at Vesuvius, Etna, and other active\r\nvolcanoes, but a study of the volcanoes dissected by denudation affords\r\nthe most convincing evidence of the same fact. The remarkable linear\r\narrangement seen in groups of volcanoes, which is conspicuous to the\r\nmost superficial observer, confirms this conclusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81.--Map of the volcanic group of the Lipari\r\nIslands, illustrating the position of the lines of fissure on which the\r\nvolcanoes have been built up.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHIFTING OF VENTS ALONG FISSURES.]\r\n\r\nWe have described the action going on at Stromboli as typical of that\r\nwhich occurs at all volcanic vents. Stromboli is, however, one among\r\na group of islands all of which are entirely of volcanic origin. The\r\nvolcanoes of this group of islands, the Æolian or Lipari Islands, are\r\narranged along a series of lines which doubtless mark fissures in the\r\nearth's crust. These fissures, as will be seen by the accompanying map\r\n(fig. 81), radiate from a centre at which we have proofs of the former\r\nexistence of a volcano of enormous dimensions. It is a very interesting\r\nfact, which the studies of Prof. Suess have established, that the\r\nearthquakes which have so often desolated Calabria appear to have\r\noriginated immediately beneath this great centre of volcanic activity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82.--The Puy de Pariou in the Auvergne,\r\nillustrating the shifting of the centre of eruption along a line of\r\nfissures.]\r\n\r\nWhen two volcanic cones are thrown up on the same line of fissure,\r\ntheir full development is interfered with, and irregularities in their\r\nform and characters are the consequence. In the plan (fig. 82) and the\r\nsection (fig. 83) an example is given of the results of such a shifting\r\nof the centre of eruption along a line of fissure. By the second\r\noutburst, one-half of the first-formed cone has been removed, and the\r\nsecond-formed overlaps the first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83.--Ideal section of the Puy de Pariou.]\r\n\r\nSometimes a number of scoria- or tuff-cones are thrown up in such close\r\nproximity to one another along a line of fissure, that they merge into\r\na long irregular heap on the summit of which a number of distinct\r\ncraters can be traced. An example of this kind was furnished by the\r\nline of scoria-cones formed above the fissure which opened on the\r\nflanks of Etna in 1865 (see fig. 84).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84.--Fissure formed on the flanks of Etna during\r\nthe eruption of 1865.\r\n\r\n_a._ Monte Frumento, an old parasitic cone. _b._ Line of fissure. _c,\r\nc, c._ New scoria-cones thrown up on line of fissure. _d._ Lava from\r\nsame.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85.--Plan of the Island of Vulcano, based on the\r\nmap of the Italian Government.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHIFTING OF ERUPTIONS ALONG FISSURES.]\r\n\r\nEven in the case of great composite cones, however, we sometimes find\r\nproofs of the centre of eruption having shifted its place along the\r\nline of fissure. No better example of this kind could possibly be\r\nadduced than that of the Island of Vulcano, with the peninsula of\r\nVulcanello, which is joined to it by a narrow isthmus (see the map,\r\nfig. 81, p 192). In fig. 85 we have given an enlarged plan of this\r\nisland which will make its peculiar structure more intelligible (see\r\nalso the section given in fig. 77, No. 6, facing p. 178).\r\n\r\nThe south-eastern part of the island consists of four crater-rings,\r\none half of each of Which has been successively destroyed, through\r\nthe shifting of the centre of eruption towards the north-west, along\r\nthe great line of fissure shown in the general map (fig. 81). The\r\nlast formed of these four crater-rings is the one which is now most\r\ncomplete, and culminates in Monte Saraceno (1581 ft.), _a_ in the\r\nplan, the highest point in the island. The older crater-rings have\r\nbeen in part removed by the inroads of the waters of the Mediterranean\r\non the shores of the island. In the centre of the great crater,\r\n_b_, which we have just described, rises the present active cone of\r\nVulcano, 1,266 feet high, and having a crater, _c_, about 600 yards\r\nin diameter and more than 500 feet in depth. From this cone, a great\r\nstream of obsidian, _e_, flowed in the year 1775, and a small crater,\r\n_d_, the Fossa Anticha, has been opened in the side of the cone. The\r\ncontinuation of the same line of fissure is indicated by a ruined\r\ntuff-cone, _f_, known as the Faraglione, and the three scoria-cones of\r\nVulcanello, _g, h_, which have been thrown up so close to one another\r\nas to have their lower portions merged in one common mass, as shown in\r\nfig. 86.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SYSTEMS OF VOLCANIC FISSURES.]\r\n\r\nEven in volcanoes of the largest dimensions we sometimes find proofs of\r\nthe centre of eruption having shifted along the line of fissure. Lyell\r\nshowed that such a change in the position of the central axis of the\r\nvolcano had taken place in Etna, and the same phenomenon is exhibited\r\nin the clearest manner' by some of the ancient volcanoes of the Inner\r\nHebrides, which have been dissected by the denuding forces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86.--Vulcanello, with its three craters.\r\n\r\n_a._ The most recently-formed and perfect crater, _b_ and _c_. Older\r\ncraters, the walls of which have been partly removed by denudation,\r\n_e._ Lava-currents proceeding from _b_. The section exposed in the\r\ncliff at _d_ is represented in fig. 35, p. 116.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Lipari Islands, the fissures along which the\r\nvolcanic mountains have been thrown up radiate from a common centre,\r\nand a similar arrangement can be traced in many volcanic regions,\r\nespecially those in which a great central volcano has existed. In other\r\ncases, however, as in the Campi Phlegræi, the volcanic vents appear\r\nto be formed along lines which assume a parallel arrangement, and\r\nthis doubtless marks the relative position of the original fissures\r\nproduced in the earth's crust when these volcanoes were formed. In some\r\nother cases we find evidences of the existence of a principal fissure\r\nfrom the sides of which smaller cracks originated. These three kinds of\r\narrangements of volcano-producing fissures are equally well illustrated\r\nwhen we study those denuded districts, in which, as we have seen, the\r\nground-plans of volcanic structures are revealed to our view.\r\n\r\nThere is now good ground for believing that in volcanic vents, at which\r\nlong-continued eruptive action takes place, the lavas of different\r\nchemical composition make their appearance in something like a definite\r\norder. It had been remarked by Scrope and other geologists at the\r\nbeginning of the present century, that in many volcanic areas the acid\r\nor trachytic lavas were erupted before the basic or basaltic.\r\n\r\nVon Richthofen, by his studies in Hungary and the volcanic districts\r\nof the Rocky Mountains, has been able to enunciate a law governing the\r\nnatural order of succession of volcanic products; and although some\r\nexception to this law may be mentioned, it is found to hold good for\r\nmany other districts than those in which it was first determined.\r\n\r\nIn a great number of cases it has been found that the first erupted\r\nrocks in a volcanic district are those of intermediate composition\r\nwhich are known as andesites. These andesites, which are especially\r\ncharacterised by the nature of their felspar, sometimes contain free\r\nquartz and are then known as quartz-andesites or dacites, from their\r\nabundance in Transylvania, the old Roman province of Dacia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORDER OF ERUPTION OF VOLCANIC PRODUCTS.]\r\n\r\nVon Richthofen suggests that another class of volcanic rocks, to which\r\nhe gives the name of 'propylites,' were in every case erupted before\r\nthe andesites, and in support of his views adduces the fact that in\r\nmany instances propylites are found underlying andesites. But the\r\npropylites are, in chemical composition, identical with the andesites,\r\nand like them present some varieties in which quartz occurs, and others\r\nin which that mineral is absent. In their microscopic characters the\r\npropylites differ from the andesites and dacites only in the fact that\r\nthe former are more perfectly crystalline in structure, being indeed in\r\nmany cases quite undistinguishable from the diorites or the plutonic\r\nrepresentatives of the andesites. The propylites also contain liquid\r\ncavities, which the andesites and dacites as a rule do not, and the\r\nformer class of rocks, as Prof. Szabo well points out, are usually much\r\naltered by the passage of sulphurous and other vapours, in consequence\r\nof which they frequently contain valuable metallic ores.\r\n\r\nThe extrusion of these andesitic lavas is sometimes accompanied, and\r\nsometimes preceded or followed, by eruptions of trachytic lavas--that\r\nis, of lavas of intermediate composition which have a different kind of\r\nfelspar from that prevailing in the andesites.\r\n\r\nIn the final stages of the eruptive action in most volcanic districts\r\nthe lavas poured forth belong to the classes of the rhyolitic or acid,\r\nand the basaltic or basic lavas.\r\n\r\nThese facts are admirably illustrated in the case of the volcanic\r\ndistrict of the Lipari Islands, to which we have had such frequent\r\noccasion to refer. The great central volcano of this district, which\r\nnow in a ruined condition constitutes a number of small islets (see\r\nthe map, fig. 81, p. 192), is composed of andesitic lavas. The other\r\ngreat volcanoes thrown up along the three radiating lines of fissure\r\nare composed of andesitic and trachytic rocks. But all the more recent\r\nejections of the volcanoes of the district have consisted either of\r\nrhyolites, as in Lipari and Vulcano, or of basalts, as in Stromboli and\r\nVulcanello.\r\n\r\nVon Richthofen and the geologists who most strongly maintain the\r\ngeneralisations which he has made concerning the order of appearance\r\nof volcanic products, go much farther than we have ventured to do,\r\nand insist that in all volcanic districts a constant and unvarying\r\nsuccession of different kinds of lavas can be made out. It appears to\r\nus, however, that the exceptions to the law, as thus precisely stated,\r\nare so numerous as to entirely destroy its value.\r\n\r\nThe generalisation that in most volcanic districts the first ejected\r\nlavas belong to the intermediate group of the andesites and trachytes,\r\nand that subsequently the acid rhyolites and the basic basalts made\r\ntheir appearance, is one that appears to admit of no doubt, and is\r\nfound to hold good in nearly all the volcanic regions of the globe\r\nwhich have been attentively studied.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary volcanic rocks of our own country, those of North\r\nGermany, Hungary, the Euganean Hills, the Lipari Islands, and many\r\nother districts in the Old World, together with the widespread volcanic\r\nrocks of the Rocky Mountains in the New World, all seem to conform to\r\nthis general rule.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THEORY OF VOLCANIC MAGMAS.]\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject, it may be well to refer to the\r\nideas on the composition of volcanic rocks which were enunciated by\r\nBunsen, and the theoretic views based on them by Durocher. Bunsen\r\njustly pointed out that all volcanic rocks might be regarded as\r\nmixtures in varying proportions of two typical kinds of materials,\r\nwhich he named the 'normal trachytic' and the 'normal pyroxenic'\r\nelements respectively. The first of these corresponds very closely in\r\ncomposition with the acid volcanic rocks or rhyolites, and the second\r\nwith the basic volcanic rocks or basalts. Durocher pointed out that\r\nif quantities of these different materials existed in admixture, the\r\nhigher specific gravity of the basic element would cause it gradually\r\nto sink to the bottom, while the acid element would rise to the top.\r\nCarrying out this idea still further, he propounded the theory that\r\nbeneath the earth's solid crust there exist two magmas, the upper\r\nconsisting of light acid materials, the lower of heavy basic ones; and\r\nhe supposed that by the varying intensity of the volcanic forces we may\r\nhave sometimes one or the other magma erupted and sometimes varying\r\nmixtures of the two.\r\n\r\nThe study of volcanic rocks in recent years has not lent much support\r\nto the theoretic views of Durocher concerning the existence of two\r\nuniversal magmas beneath the earth's crust; and there are not a few\r\nfacts which seem quite irreconcilable with such a theory. Thus we\r\nfind evidence that in the adjacent volcanic districts of Hungary and\r\nBohemia, volcanic action was going on during the whole of the latter\r\npart of the Tertiary period. But the products of the contemporaneous\r\nvolcanic outbursts in adjacent areas were as different in character\r\nas can well be imagined. The volcanic rocks all over Hungary present\r\na strong family likeness; the first erupted were trachytes, then\r\nfollowed andesites and dacites in great abundance, and lastly rhyolites\r\nand basalts containing felspar. But in Bohemia, the lavas poured out\r\nfrom the volcanoes during the same period were firstly phonolites\r\nand then basalts containing nepheline and leucite. It is scarcely\r\npossible to imagine that such very different classes of lavas could\r\nhave been poured out from vents which were in communication with the\r\nsame reservoirs of igneous rock, and we are driven to conclude that the\r\nHungarian and Bohemian volcanoes were supplied from different sources.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SEPARATION OF LAVAS IN RESERVOIRS.]\r\n\r\nBut the undoubted fact that in so many volcanic regions the eruption of\r\nandesitic and trachytic rocks, which are of intermediate composition,\r\nis followed by the appearance of the differentiated products, rhyolite\r\nand basalt, which are of acid and basic composition respectively, lends\r\nnot a little support to the view that under each volcanic district a\r\nreservoir of more or less completely molten rock exists, and that in\r\nthese reservoirs various changes take place during the long periods\r\nof igneous activity. During the earlier period of eruption the heavier\r\nand lighter elements of the contents of these subterranean reservoirs\r\nappear to be mingled together; but in the later stages of the volcanic\r\nhistory of the district, the lighter or acid elements rise to the top,\r\nand the heavier or basic sink to the bottom, and we have separate\r\neruptions of rhyolite and basalt. We even find some traces of this\r\naction being carried still further. Among the basalts ejected from the\r\nvolcanoes of Northern Germany, Bohemia, Styria, Auvergne, and many\r\nother regions, we not unfrequently find rounded masses consisting of\r\nolivine, enstatite, augite, and other heavier constituents of the rock.\r\nThese often form the centre of volcanic bombs, and are not improbably\r\nportions of a dense mass which may have sunk to the bottom of the\r\nreservoirs of basaltic materials.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the circumstance that the eruption of lavas of\r\nintermediate composition usually precedes that of other varieties, we\r\nusually find the central and older portions of great volcanoes to be\r\nformed of andesites, trachytes, or phonolites, while the outer and\r\nnewer portions of the mass are made up of acid or basic lavas. This is\r\nstrikingly exemplified in the great volcanoes of the Auvergne and the\r\nWestern Isles of Scotland, in all of which we find that great mountain\r\nmasses have, in the first instance, been built up by extrusions of lava\r\nof the intermediate types, and that through this central core fissures\r\nhave been opened conveying basic lavas to the surface. From these\r\nfissures great numbers of basaltic lava-streams have issued, greatly\r\nincreasing the height and bulk of the volcanic cones and deluging the\r\ncountry all around.\r\n\r\nThe lavas of intermediate composition--the andesites, trachytes, and\r\nphonolites--possess, as we have already seen, but very imperfect\r\nliquidity as they flow from the volcanic vents. Hence we find them\r\neither accumulating in great dome-shaped masses above the vent or\r\nforming lava-streams which are of great bulk and thickness, but do not\r\nflow far from the orifices whence they issue. The more fusible basaltic\r\nlavas, on the other hand, spread out evenly on issuing from a vent, and\r\nsometimes flow to the distance of many miles from it. This difference\r\nin the behaviour of the intermediate and basic lavas is admirably\r\nillustrated in the volcanic districts of the Auvergne and the Western\r\nIsles of Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, like Vesuvius, we find that great volcanic cones of\r\ntrachytic tuff have been built up, and that these masses of fragmentary\r\ntrachytic materials have been surrounded and enclosed by the ejection,\r\nat a later date, of great outbursts of basaltic lavas. In still\r\nother cases, of which Rocca Monfina in Southern Italy constitutes an\r\nexcellent example, we find that a great crater-ring of trachytic tuffs\r\nhas been formed in the first instance, and in the midst of this a cone,\r\ncomposed of more basic materials, has been thrown up.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL LAW.]\r\n\r\nIn all these volcanoes we see the tendency towards the eruption\r\nof intermediate lavas in the first instance, and of basaltic and\r\nacid lavas at a later date. Valuable, however, as are the early\r\ngeneralisations of Scrope, and the more precise law enunciated by Von\r\nRichthofen concerning the 'natural order of succession of volcanic\r\nproducts,' we must not forget that there are to be found a considerable\r\nnumber of exceptions to them. There are some volcanic centres from\r\nwhich only one kind of lava has been emitted, and this may be either\r\nacid, basic, or intermediate in composition; and on the other hand,\r\nthere are districts in which various kinds of lava have been ejected\r\nfrom the same vents within a short period of time, in such a way as to\r\ndefy every attempt to make out anything like a law as to the order of\r\ntheir appearance. Nevertheless the rules which we have indicated appear\r\nto hold good in so great a number of cases that they are well worthy\r\nof being remembered, and may serve as a basis on which we may reason\r\nconcerning the nature of the action going on beneath volcanic vents.\r\n\r\nFrom the study of the external appearances of volcanic mountains,\r\ncombined with investigations of those which have been dissected by\r\ndenudation, we are able to picture to our minds the series of actions\r\nby which the great volcanic mountains of the globe have been slowly and\r\ngradually built up.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance the eruptions appear to have taken place at\r\nseveral points along a line of fissure, but gradually all of these\r\nwould become choked up except one which became the centre of\r\nhabitual eruption. From this opening, ejections, firstly of lavas of\r\nintermediate composition, and afterwards of basic materials, would take\r\nplace, until a volcano of considerable dimensions was built up around\r\nit. But at last a point would be reached in the piling up of this\r\ncone, when the volcanic forces below would be inadequate to the work\r\nof raising the liquid lava through the whole length of the continually\r\nupward-growing tube of the volcano. Under these circumstances the\r\nexpansive force of the imprisoned steam would find it easier to rend\r\nasunder the sides of the volcanic cone than to force the liquid\r\nmaterial to the summit of the mountain. If these fissures reached the\r\nsurface explosive action would take place, in consequence of the escape\r\nof steam from the glowing mass, and scoria-, tuff-, and lava-cones\r\nwould be formed above the fissure. In this way, as we have already\r\npointed out, the numerous 'parasitic cones' which usually abound on\r\nthe flanks of the greater volcanic mountains have been formed. The\r\nextrusion of these masses of scoriæ and lava on the flanks of the\r\nmountain tends, not only to increase the bulk of the mass, but to\r\nstrengthen and fortify the sides. For by the powerful expansive force\r\nat work below, every weak place in the cone is discovered and a fissure\r\nproduced there; but by the extrusion of material at this fissure, and\r\nstill more by the consolidation of the lava in the fissure, the weak\r\nplace is converted into one of exceptional strength.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INTRUSIVE MASSES BENEATH VOLCANOES.]\r\n\r\nAs the sides of the cone are thus continually repaired and strengthened\r\nthey are rendered more capable of withstanding the heaving forces\r\nacting from below, and these forces can then only find vent for\r\nthemselves by again raising the liquefied lava to the central orifice\r\nof the mountain. Many volcanoes, like Etna, exhibit this alternation of\r\neruptive action from the crater at the summit of the mountain, and from\r\nfissures opened upon its flanks, the former tending to raise the height\r\nof the volcanic pile, the latter to increase its bulk.\r\n\r\nBut at last a stage will be reached when the volcanic forces are\r\nno longer able either to raise the lava up the long column of the\r\ncentral vent on the one hand, or to rend asunder the strongly-built\r\nand well-compacted flanks of the mountain on the other. It is probably\r\nunder these conditions, for the most part, that the lavas find their\r\nway between the masses of surrounding strata and force them asunder in\r\nthe way that we have already described.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the more fluid basaltic lavas, as was pointed out so\r\nlong ago by Macculloch, the liquefied materials may find their way\r\nbetween the strata to enormous distances from the volcanic centre. Such\r\nextended flat sheets of igneous rock retain their parallelism with the\r\nstrata among which they are intruded over large areas, and did not\r\nprobably produce any marked phenomena at the surface.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of less fluid lavas, such as those of intermediate or\r\nacid composition, for example, the effect would be far otherwise. Such\r\nlavas, not flowing readily from the centre of eruption, would tend to\r\nform great bulky lenticular masses between the strata which they forced\r\nasunder, and, in so doing, could not fail to upheave and fissure the\r\ngreat mountain-mass above. Vast lenticular masses of trachytic rock,\r\nthus evidently forced between strata, have been described by Mr. G.\r\nK. Gilbert, as occurring in the Henry Mountains of Southern Utah, and\r\nby him have been denominated 'laccolites,' or stone-cisterns. Whether\r\nthe great basaltic sheets, like those described by Macculloch, and\r\nthose more bulky lenticular reservoirs of rock of which Mr. Gilbert\r\nhas given us such an admirable account, were in all cases connected\r\nwith the surface, may well be a matter for doubt. It is quite possible\r\nthat, in some cases, liquefied masses of rocky materials in seeking\r\nto force their way to the surface only succeeded in thus finding a\r\nway for themselves between the strata, and their energy was expended\r\nbefore the surface was reached and explosive action took place. But it\r\nis an undoubted fact that beneath many of the old volcanoes, of which\r\nthe internal structure is now revealed to us by the action of denuding\r\nforces, great intrusive sheets and laccolites abound; and we cannot\r\ndoubt that beneath volcanoes now in a state of eruption, or in those\r\nwhich have but recently become extinct, similar structures must be in\r\ncourse of formation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EFFECTS OF INTRUSION BENEATH CONES.]\r\n\r\nThat great upheaving forces have operated on volcanoes, subsequently\r\nto the accumulation of their materials, we have sufficient evidence in\r\nthe Val del Bove of Etna, the Caldera of Palma, the Corral of Madeira,\r\n&c. In all of these cases we find a radial fissure ('barranco') leading\r\ninto a great crateral hollow; and these radial fissures are of such\r\nwidth and depth that their origin can only be referred to a disruptive\r\nforce like that which would be exercised by the intrusion of masses of\r\nmore or less imperfectly fluid material between the subjacent strata.\r\nThese facts, of course, lend no countenance to the views formerly held\r\nby many geologists, both in Germany and France, that the materials\r\nof which volcanoes are built up were deposited in an approximately\r\nhorizontal position, and were subsequently blown up like a gigantic\r\nbubble. In Etna, Palma, and Madeira we find abundant proofs that the\r\nmass existed as a great volcanic cone before the production of the\r\nfissures (barrancos), which we have referred to the force exercised\r\nduring the intrusion of great igneous masses beneath them.\r\n\r\nBut besides the horizontally-disposed intrusive sheets and laccolites,\r\ngreat, radiating, vertical fissures are produced by the heaving forces\r\nacting beneath those volcanic centres which have been closed up and\r\n'cicatrised' by the exudation from them of subterranean materials.\r\nThese vertical intrusions, which we call dykes, like the horizontal\r\nones, differ in character, according to the nature of the materials\r\nof which they are composed. Dykes of acid and intermediate lava are\r\nusually of considerable width, and do not extend to great distances\r\nfrom the centres of eruption. Dykes composed of the more-liquid, basic\r\nlavas, on the other hand, may extend to the distance of hundreds of\r\nmiles from the central vent. The way in which comparatively narrow,\r\nbasaltic dykes are found running in approximately straight lines\r\nfor such enormous distances is a very striking fact, and bears the\r\nstrongest evidence to the heaving and expanding forces at work at\r\nvolcanic centres, during and subsequently to the extrusion of the\r\nigneous products at the surface.\r\n\r\nThese basaltic dykes occur in such prodigious numbers around some\r\nvolcanic vents, that the whole of the stratified rocks in the immediate\r\nvicinity are broken up by a complete network of them, crossing and\r\ninterlacing in the most complicated fashion. Farther away from the\r\nvents, similar dykes are found in smaller numbers, evidently radiating\r\nfrom the same centre, and sometimes extending to a distance of more\r\nthan a hundred miles from it. Nowhere can we find more beautiful\r\nillustrations of such dykes than in the Western Isles of Scotland. When\r\ncomposed of materials which do not so easily undergo decomposition as\r\nthe surrounding rocks, they stand up like vast walls; but when, on the\r\nother hand, they are more readily acted on by atmospheric moisture than\r\nare the rocks which enclose them, they give rise to deep trenches with\r\nvertical sides, which render the country almost impassable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRUCTURE OF INTRUSIVE MASSES.]\r\n\r\nThe lava consolidating in these horizontal intrusions (sheets and\r\nlaccolites), and the vertical intrusions (dykes), is usually more\r\ncrystalline in structure than the similar materials poured out at the\r\nsurface. In the same dyke or sheet, when it is of great width, we\r\noften find every variation--from a glassy material formed by the rapid\r\ncooling of the mass where it is in contact with other rocks, to the\r\nperfectly crystalline or granitic varieties which form the centre of\r\nthe intrusion. It is in these dykes and other intrusions that we find\r\nthe most convincing evidence of the truth of the conclusions, which\r\nwe have enunciated in a former chapter, concerning the dependence of\r\nthe structure of an igneous rock upon the conditions under which it\r\nhas consolidated. One material is found, under varying conditions,\r\nassuming the characters of obsidian, rhyolite, quartz-felsite, or\r\ngranite; another, under the same set of conditions, taking the form of\r\ntachylyte, basalt, dolerite, and gabbro.\r\n\r\nThat these great intrusive masses, sheets and dykes, in their passage\r\nbetween the sedimentary rocks sometimes find places where the overlying\r\nstrata are of such thinness or incoherence that the liquefied rocks are\r\nable to force a way for themselves to the surface, we have the clearest\r\nproof. In some dykes we find the rock in their upper portions losing\r\nits compact character and becoming open and scoriaceous, showing that\r\nthe pressure had been so far diminished as to allow of the imprisoned\r\nwater flashing into steam.\r\n\r\nAll round great volcanoes which have become extinct we frequently find\r\nseries of small volcanic cones, which have evidently been thrown up\r\nalong the lines where the great lava-filled fissures, which we have\r\nbeen describing, have reached the surface and given rise to explosive\r\naction there. The linear arrangement of these small cones, which are\r\nthrown up in the plains surrounding vast volcanic mountains that have\r\nbecome extinct, is very striking. The numerous 'puys' of the Auvergne\r\nand adjoining volcanic regions of Central France are for the most part\r\nsmall scoria- and lava-cones which were thrown up along great lines\r\nof fissure radiating from the immense, central, volcanic mountains of\r\nthe district, after they had become extinct. These scoria-cones and\r\nthe small lava-streams which flow from them, as was so well shown by\r\nMr. Scrope, mark the latest efforts of the volcanic forces beneath the\r\ndistrict before they finally sank into complete extinction. In the\r\nWestern Isles of Scotland, as I have elsewhere shown, we can study the\r\nformation of these later-formed cones in the plains around extinct\r\nvolcanic mountains, with the additional advantage of having revealed\r\nto us, by the action of the denuding forces, their connection with the\r\ngreat radiating fissures.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the several stages in the decline of each\r\nvolcanic outburst is marked by the appearance at the vent of certain\r\nacid gases. In the same way, after the ejection of solid materials\r\nfrom a volcanic vent has come to an end, certain gaseous substances\r\ncontinue to be evolved; and as the temperature at the vents declines,\r\nthe nature of the volatile substances emitted from them undergoes a\r\nregular series of changes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORDER OF EMISSION OF VOLCANIC GASES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Fouqué, by a careful series of analyses of the gases which he\r\ncollected at different gaseous vents, or fumaroles as they are called,\r\nin the crater of Vulcano, has been able to define the general relations\r\nwhich appear to exist between the temperature at a volcanic orifice\r\nand the volatile substances which issue from it. He found that in\r\nfumaroles, in which the temperature exceeded 360° centigrade, and\r\nin which in consequence strips of zinc were fused by the stream of\r\nissuing gas, the analysis of the products showed sulphurous acid and\r\nhydrochloric add to be present in large quantities, and sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen and carbonic acid in much smaller proportions. Around these\r\nexcessively heated fumaroles, the lips of which often appear at night\r\nto be red-hot, considerable deposits of sulphide of arsenic, chloride\r\nof iron, chloride of ammonium, boracic acid, and sulphur were taking\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIt was found, however, that as the temperature of the vent declined,\r\nthe emission of the sulphurous acid and hydrochloric acid diminished,\r\nand the quantity of sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid mingled\r\nwith them was proportionately increased.\r\n\r\nIn the same way it appears to be a universal rule that when a volcanic\r\nvent sinks into a condition of temporary quiescence or complete\r\nextinction the powerfully acid gases, hydrochloric acid and sulphurous\r\nacid, make their appearance in the first instance, and at a later stage\r\nthese are gradually replaced by sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nOf these facts we find a very beautiful illustration in the Campi\r\nPhlegræi near Naples. With the exception of Monte Nuovo, the volcano\r\nwhich has most recently been in a state of activity in that district\r\nis the Solfatara. From certain apertures in the floor of the crater of\r\nthe Solfatara there issue continually watery vapours, sulphurous acid,\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, hydrochloric acid, and chloride of ammonium.\r\nThe action of these substances upon one another, and upon the volcanic\r\nrocks through which they pass, gives rise to the formation of certain\r\nchemical products which, from a very early period, have been collected\r\non account of their commercial value. The action of these add gases\r\nupon the surrounding rocks is very marked; efflorescent deposits of\r\nvarious sulphates and chlorides take place in all the crevices and\r\nvesicles of the rock; sulphur and sulphide of arsenic are also formed\r\nin considerable quantities; and the trachytic tuffs, deprived of their\r\niron-oxide, alkaline earths and alkalies, which are converted into\r\nsoluble sulphates and chlorides, are reduced to a white, powdery,\r\nsiliceous mass. Many volcanoes, which have sunk into a state of\r\nquiescence or extinction like the Solfatara of Naples, exhibit the same\r\ntendency to give off great quantities of the powerfully-acid gases\r\nwhich act upon the surrounding rocks, and deprive them of their colour\r\nand consistency. Such volcanoes are said by geologists to have sunk\r\ninto the 'solfatara stage.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOLFATARA-STAGE OF VOLCANOES.]\r\n\r\nAt the Lake of Agnano and some other points in the Campi Phlegræi,\r\nhowever, we find fissures from which the less-powerfully acid gases,\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid, issue. These gases as they,\r\nare poured forth from the vents are found to be little, if at all,\r\nabove the temperature of the atmosphere. Sulphuretted hydrogen is an\r\ninflammable gas, and in the so-called salses and mud-volcanoes, at\r\nwhich it is ejected in considerable quantities, it not unfrequently\r\ntakes fire and bums with a conspicuous flame. Carbonic acid on account\r\nof its great density tends to accumulate in volcanic fissures and\r\ncraters rather than to mingle with the surrounding atmosphere. At the\r\nso-called Grotto del Cane, beside the Lago Agnano, it is the custom to\r\nshow the presence of this heavy and suffocating gas by thrusting a dog\r\ninto it, the poor animal being revived, before life is quite extinct,\r\nby pouring cold water over it. At the Büdos Hegy or 'stinking hill' of\r\nTransylvania, carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen are emitted in\r\nconsiderable quantities, and it is possible to take a bath of the heavy\r\ngas, the head being kept carefully above the constant level of the\r\nexhalations.\r\n\r\nAlthough the stories of the ancient Avernian lake, across which no bird\r\ncould fly without suffocation, and of the Guevo Upas, or Poison Valley\r\nof Java, which it has been said no living being can cross, may not\r\nimprobably be exaggerations of the actual facts, yet there is a basis\r\nof truth in them in the existence of old volcanic fissures and craters\r\nwhich evolve the poisonous sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid\r\ngases.\r\n\r\nBesides the gases which we have already named, and which are the most\r\ncommon at and characteristic of volcanic vents, there are some others\r\nwhich are not unfrequently emitted. First among these we must mention\r\nboracic acid, which, though not a remarkably volatile substance, is\r\neasily carried along in a fine state of division in a current of steam.\r\nAt Monte Cerboli and Monte Rotondo in Tuscany, great quantities of\r\nsteam jets accompanied by sulphuretted hydrogen and boracic acid issue\r\nfrom the rocks, and these jets being directed into artificial basins of\r\nwater, the boracic acid is condensed and is recovered by evaporation.\r\nWe have already noticed that boracic add is evolved with the gases at\r\nVulcano and other craters; and the part which this substance plays in\r\nvolcanic districts is shown by the fact that many of the rocks, filling\r\nold subterranean volcanic reservoirs, are found to be greatly altered\r\nand to have new minerals developed in their midst through the action\r\nupon them of boracic acid.\r\n\r\nAmmonia and various compounds of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen are\r\namong the gases evolved from volcanic vents. In some cases these gases\r\nmay be produced by the destructive distillation of organic materials\r\nin the sedimentary rocks through which volcanic outbursts take place.\r\nBut it is far from impossible that under the conditions of temperature\r\nand pressure which exist at the volcanic foci, direct chemical union\r\nmay take place between substances, which at the surface appear to be\r\nperfectly inert in each other's presence.\r\n\r\nWhen the temperature at volcanic fissures is no longer sufficiently\r\nhigh to cause water to issue in the condition of vapour or steam, as is\r\nthe case at the 'stufas' which we have described, it comes forth in the\r\nliquid state. Water so issuing from old volcanic fissures may vary in\r\nits temperature, from the boiling point downwards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GEYSERS AND HOT-SPRINGS.]\r\n\r\nWhen the water issues at a temperature little removed from the boiling\r\npoint, it is apt to give rise to intermittent springs or geysers, the\r\neruptions of which exhibit a remarkable analogy with those of ordinary\r\nvolcanoes. Geysers may indeed be described as volcanoes in which heated\r\nwater, instead of molten rock, is forced out from the vent by the\r\nescaping steam. They occur in great abundance in districts in which the\r\nsubterranean action is becoming dormant or extinct, such as Iceland,\r\nthe North Island of New Zealand, and the district of the National Park\r\nin the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to explain the exact mechanism by which\r\nthe intermittent action of geysers is produced, but it is not at all\r\nprobable that any one such explanation will cover all the varied\r\nphenomena exhibited by them. Like volcanic outbursts, geyser eruptions\r\ndoubtless originate in the escape of bubbles of steam through a liquid\r\nmass, and this liberation of steam follows any relief of pressure.\r\nIn districts where vast masses of lava are slowly cooling down from\r\na state of incandescence, and surface waters are finding their way\r\ndownwards while subterranean waters are finding their way upwards,\r\nthere can be no lack of the necessary conditions for such outbursts.\r\nSometimes the eruptions of geysers take place at short and regular\r\nintervals, at other times they occur at wide and irregular intervals\r\nof time. In some cases the outbursts take place spontaneously, and at\r\nothers the action can be hastened by choking up the vent with stones or\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nOther hot springs, like the Strudel of Carlsbad, rise above the surface\r\nin a constant jet, while most of them issue quietly and flow like\r\nordinary springs.\r\n\r\nAlthough the violent and paroxysmal outbursts of volcanic mountains\r\narrest the attention, and powerfully impress us with a sense of the\r\nvolcanic activity going on beneath the earth's surface, yet it may\r\nwell be doubted whether the quantity of heat, which the earth gets rid\r\nof by their means, at all approaches in amount that which is quietly\r\ndissipated by means of the numerous 'stufas,' gaseous exhalations, and\r\nthermal springs which occur in such abundance all over its surface.\r\nFor while the former are intermittent in their action, and powerful\r\noutbursts are interrupted by long periods of rest, the action of the\r\nlatter, though feeble, is usually continuous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EFFECTS OF HOT-SPRINGS.]\r\n\r\nMost people may regard the hot spring of Bath as a very slight\r\nmanifestation of volcanic activity. This spring issues at a constant\r\ntemperature of 49° C, or 120° Fahr. As, however, no less than 180,000\r\ngallons of water issue daily from this source, we may well understand\r\nhow great is the amount of heat of which the earth's crust is relieved\r\nby its agency. It may indeed be doubted whether its action in this way\r\nis not at least equal to that of a considerable volcano which, though\r\nso much more violent, is intermittent in its action.\r\n\r\nNor are thermal springs by any means ineffective agents in bringing\r\nmaterials from the interior of the earth's crust and depositing it\r\nat the surface. The Bath spring contains various saline substances,\r\nprincipally sulphates and chlorides, in solution in its waters. These\r\nare quietly carried by rivers to the sea, and are lost to our view. The\r\nspring has certainly maintained its present condition since the time\r\nof the Romans, and I find that if the solid materials brought from the\r\ninterior of the earth during the last 2,000 years had been collected,\r\nthey would form a solid cone equal in height to Monte Nuovo. Yet we\r\nusually regard the Campi Phlegræi as a powerfully-active volcanic\r\ndistrict, and the subterranean action in our own country as quite\r\nunworthy of notice.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember the fact that on the continent of Europe the hot and\r\nsaline springs may be numbered by thousands, and that they especially\r\nabound in districts like Hungary, the Auvergne, the Rhine provinces,\r\nand Central Italy, where volcanic action has recently become extinct,\r\nwe shall be able to form some slight idea of the work performed\r\nby these agents, not only in relieving the earth's crust of its\r\nsuperfluous heat, but in transporting materials in a state of solution\r\nfrom the interior of that crust and depositing them at the surface. The\r\nvast deposits of siliceous sinter and of travertine also bear witness\r\nto the effects produced by hot and mineral springs.\r\n\r\nNor is the work of these springs confined to the surface. Mr. John\r\nArthur Phillips has shown that metallic gold and the sulphide of\r\nquicksilver (cinnabar) have been deposited with the silica and other\r\nminerals formed on the sides of a fissure from which hot springs issue\r\nat the surface. There cannot be any doubt that the metallic veins or\r\nlodes, which are the repositories of most of the metals employed in the\r\narts, have been formed in cracks connected with great volcanic foci,\r\nthe transfer of the various sulphides, oxides, and salts which fill\r\nthe vein having been effected either by solution, sublimation, or the\r\naction of powerful currents of steam.\r\n\r\nAs the igneous activity of the district declines, the temperature\r\nof the issuing gases and waters diminishes with it, until at last\r\nthe volcanic forces appear to wholly abandon that region and to be\r\ntransferred to another.\r\n\r\nYet even after all or nearly all indications of the volcanic agencies\r\ncease to make themselves visible at the surface, occasional tremblings\r\nof the earth's crust show that perfect equilibrium has not been\r\nrestored below, but that movements are taking place which result in\r\nshocks that are transmitted through the overlying and surrounding\r\nrock-masses as earthquake vibrations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NATURE OF VOLCANIC CYCLES.]\r\n\r\nSuch is the cycle of changes which appears to take place at each\r\ndistrict of the earth's surface, as it successively becomes the scene\r\nof volcanic activity.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of any particular area of the earth's surface by the\r\nvolcanic forces appears to be heralded by subterranean shocks causing\r\nearthquake vibrations. Presently the origination of fissures is\r\nindicated by the rise of saline and thermal springs, and the issuing\r\nof carbonic acid and other gases at the surface. As the subterranean\r\nactivity becomes more pronounced, the temperature of the springs and\r\nemitted gases is found to increase, and at last a visible rent is\r\nformed at the surface, exposing the incandescent materials below.\r\n\r\nFrom this open fissure which has thus been formed, the gas and vapours\r\nimprisoned in the incandescent rock-materials escape with such violence\r\nas to disperse the latter in scoriæ and dust, or to cause them to\r\nwell out in great streams as lava-flows. Usually the action becomes\r\nconcentrated at one or several points at which the ejected materials\r\naccumulate to form volcanic cones.\r\n\r\nSometimes the volcanic activity dies away entirely after these cones\r\nare thrown up along the line of fissure, but at others some such\r\ncentre becomes for a longer or shorter time the habitual vent for the\r\nvolcanic forces in the district, and by repeated ejections of lavas and\r\nfragmentary materials at longer or shorter intervals the cone increases\r\nboth in height and bulk.\r\n\r\nWhen the height of the cone has grown to a certain extent, it becomes\r\nmore easy for the volcanic energies below to rend the sides of the\r\ncone than to raise the molten materials to its summit. In this way\r\nlateral or parasitic cones are thrown up on the flanks of the volcanic\r\nmountain, the mass being alternately elevated and strengthened by the\r\nejections from the summit and sides respectively.\r\n\r\nWhen the volcanic energies no longer suffice to raise the fluid\r\nmaterials to the summit, nor to rend the sides of the volcano, fissures\r\nwith small cones may be formed in the plains around the great central\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, this energy diminishes so far that rock materials\r\ncan no longer be forced to the surface, the fissures become sealed up\r\nby consolidating lava, and the volcanic cones fall into a condition of\r\nextinction and decay.\r\n\r\nThe existence of heated materials at no great depth from the surface\r\nis indicated by the outburst of gases and vapours, the formation of\r\ngeysers, mud-volcanoes, and ordinary thermal springs. But as the\r\nunderlying rocks cool down, the issuing jets of gas and vapour lose\r\ntheir high temperature and diminish in quantity, the geysers and\r\nmud-volcanoes become extinct, and the thermal springs lose their\r\npeculiar character or disappear, and thus all manifestations of the\r\nigneous energies in the district gradually die away.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DURATION OF VOLCANIC CYCLES.]\r\n\r\nSuch a cycle of changes probably requires many hundreds of thousands,\r\nor even many millions, of years for its accomplishment; but by the\r\nstudy of volcanoes in every stage of their growth and decline we are\r\nable to reconstruct even the minutest details of their history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF VOLCANOES UPON THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not by any means an easy task to frame an estimate of the number\r\nof volcanoes in the world. Volcanoes, as we have seen, vary greatly\r\nin their dimensions--from vast mountain masses, rising to a height\r\nof nearly 25,000 feet above the sea-level, to mere molehills; the\r\nsmaller ones being in many cases subsidiary to larger, and constituting\r\neither parasitic cones on their flanks, or 'puys' around their bases.\r\nVolcanoes likewise exhibit every possible stage of development and\r\ndecay: while some are in a state of chronic active eruption, others\r\nare reduced to the condition of solfataras, and others again have\r\nfallen into a more or less complete state of ruin through the action of\r\ndenuding forces.\r\n\r\nEven if we confine our attention to the larger volcanoes, which merit\r\nthe name of 'mountains,' and such of these as we have reason to\r\nbelieve to be in a still active condition, our difficulties will be\r\ndiminished, but not by any means removed. Volcanoes, as we have seen,\r\nmay sink into a dormant condition that may endure for hundreds or\r\neven thousands of years, and then burst forth into a state of renewed\r\nactivity; and it is quite impossible, in many cases, to distinguish\r\nbetween the conditions of dormancy and extinction. Concerning certain\r\nsmall areas in Southern Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa,\r\nhistorical records, more or less reliable, extend back over periods of\r\nseveral thousands of years; but with regard to the greater part of the\r\nrest of the world we have no information beyond a few hundred years,\r\nand there are considerable areas which have been known only for far\r\nshorter periods, while some are as yet quite unexplored. In districts\r\nalmost wholly uninhabited, or roamed over by nomadic tribes, legend\r\nand tradition constitute our only guides--and very unsafe ones they\r\nare--in the attempt to determine what volcanoes have recently been in a\r\ncondition of activity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NUMBER OF ACTIVE VOLCANOES.]\r\n\r\nWe shall, however, probably be within the limits of truth in stating\r\nthat the number of great habitual volcanic vents upon the globe,\r\nwhich we have reason to believe are still in an active condition, is\r\nsomewhere between 300 and 350. Most of these active volcanic vents\r\nare marked by more or less considerable mountains, composed of the\r\nmaterials ejected from them. If we include the mountains which exhibit\r\nthe external conical form, the crateral hollows, and other features\r\nof volcanoes, but concerning the activity of which we have no record\r\nor tradition, the number will fall little, if anything, short of\r\n1,000. The mountains composed of volcanic materials, but which have\r\nlost through denudation the external form of volcanoes, are still more\r\nnumerous. The smaller temporary openings which are usually subordinate\r\nto the habitual vents, that have been active during the periods\r\ncovered by history and tradition, must be numbered by thousands and\r\ntens of thousands. The still feebler manifestations of the volcanic\r\nforces--such as are exhibited in 'stufas,' or steam-jets, geysers,\r\nor intermittent hot springs, thermal and mineral waters, fumaroles,\r\nemitting various gases, salses or spouting saline and muddy springs,\r\nand mud volcanoes--may be reckoned by millions. It is not improbable\r\nthat these less powerful manifestations of the volcanic forces, to a\r\ngreat extent make up in number what they want in individual energy; and\r\nthe relief which they afford to the imprisoned activities within the\r\nearth's crust may be scarcely less than that which results from the\r\noccasional outbursts at the 300 or 350 great habitual volcanic vents.\r\n\r\nIn taking a general survey of the volcanic phenomena of the globe,\r\nno fact comes out more strikingly than that of the very unequal\r\ndistribution, in different districts, both of the great habitual\r\nvolcanic vents, and of the minor exhibitions of subterranean energy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VOLCANOES OF THE CONTINENTS.]\r\n\r\nThus, on the whole of the continent of Europe, there is but one\r\nhabitual volcanic vent--that of Vesuvius--and this is situated upon\r\nthe shores of the Mediterranean. In the islands of the Mediterranean,\r\nhowever, there are no less than six volcanoes; namely, Stromboli and\r\nVulcano, in the Lipari Islands; Etna, in Sicily; Graham's Isle, a\r\nsubmarine volcano, off the Sicilian coast; and Santorin and Nisyros, in\r\nthe Ægean Sea.\r\n\r\nThe African continent is at present known to contain about ten active\r\nvolcanoes--four on the west coast, and six on the east coast; about ten\r\nother active volcanoes occur on islands close to the African coasts. In\r\nAsia, twenty-four active volcanoes are known, but no less than twelve\r\nof these are situated in the peninsula of Kamtschatka. No volcanoes are\r\nknown to exist in the Australian continent.\r\n\r\nThe American continent contains a greater number of volcanoes than\r\nthe divisions of the Old World. There are twenty in North America,\r\ntwenty-five in Central America, and thirty-seven in South America.\r\n\r\nThus, taken altogether, there are about one hundred and seventeen\r\nvolcanoes situated on the great continental lands of the globe, while\r\nnearly twice as many occur upon the islands scattered over the various\r\noceans.\r\n\r\nUpon examining further into the distribution of the continental\r\nvolcanoes, another very interesting fact presents itself. The volcanoes\r\nare in almost every case situated either close to the coasts of the\r\ncontinent, or at no great distance from them. There are, indeed, only\r\ntwo exceptions to this rule. In the great and almost wholly unexplored\r\ntable-land lying between Siberia and Tibet four volcanoes are said to\r\nexist, and in the Chinese province of Mantchouria several others. More\r\nreliable information is, however, needed concerning these volcanoes,\r\nsituated, unlike all others, at a great distance from the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable circumstance that all the oceanic islands which\r\nare not coral-reefs are composed of volcanic rocks; and many of these\r\noceanic islands, as well as others lying near the shores of the\r\ncontinents, contain active volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThrough the midst of the Atlantic Ocean runs a ridge, which, by the\r\nsoundings of the various exploring vessels sent out in recent years,\r\nhas been shown to divide the ocean longitudinally into two basins.\r\nUpon this great ridge, and the spurs proceeding from it, rise numerous\r\nmountainous masses, which constitute the well-known Atlantic islands\r\nand groups of islands. All of these are of volcanic origin, and among\r\nthem are numerous active volcanoes. The Island of Jan Mayen contains\r\nan active volcano, while Iceland contains thirteen, and not improbably\r\nmore; the Azores have six active volcanoes, the Canaries three; while\r\nabout eight volcanoes lie off the west coast of Africa. In the West\r\nIndies there are six active volcanoes; and three submarine volcanoes\r\nhave been recorded within the limits of the Atlantic Ocean. Altogether,\r\nno less than forty active volcanoes are situated upon the great\r\nsubmarine ridges which traverse the Atlantic longitudinally.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VOLCANOES ON THE OCEANIC ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\nBut along the same line the number of extinct volcanoes is far greater,\r\nand there are not wanting proofs that the volcanoes which are still\r\nactive are approaching the condition of extinction. At a somewhat\r\nearlier period of the earth's history the whole line of the present\r\nAtlantic Ocean was in all probability traversed by a chain of volcanoes\r\non the very grandest scale; but submergence has taken place, and only a\r\nfew portions of this great mountain range now rise above the sea-level,\r\nforming the isolated islands and island-groups of the Atlantic. Here\r\nand there among these a still active volcano exists.\r\n\r\nBut if the great medial chain of the Atlantic presents us with an\r\nexample of a chain of volcanic mountains verging on extinction, we have\r\nin the line of islands separating the Pacific and Indian Oceans an\r\nexample of a similar range of volcanic vents which are in a condition\r\nof the greatest activity. In the peninsula of Kamtschatka there are\r\ntwelve active volcanoes, in the Aleutian Islands thirty-one, and in\r\nthe peninsula of Alaska three. The chain of the Kuriles contains at\r\nleast ten active volcanoes; the Japanese Islands and the islands lying\r\nto the south of Japan twenty-five. The great group of islands lying\r\nto the south-east of the Asiatic continent is at the present time the\r\ngrandest focus of volcanic activity upon the globe. No less than fifty\r\nactive volcanoes occur here. Farther south, the same chain is probably\r\ncontinued by the four active volcanoes of New Guinea, one or more\r\nsubmarine volcanoes, and several vents in New Britain, the Solomon\r\nIsles, and the New Hebrides, the three active volcanoes of New Zealand,\r\nand possibly by Mount Erebus and Mount Terror in the Antarctic region.\r\nAltogether, no less than 150 active volcanoes exist in the chain of\r\nislands which stretch from Behring's Straits down to the Antarctic\r\ncircle; and if we include the volcanoes on Indian and Pacific islands\r\nwhich appear to be situated on lines branching from this particular\r\nband, we shall not be wrong in the assertion that this great system of\r\nvolcanic mountains includes at least one half of the habitually active\r\nvents of the globe.\r\n\r\nA third series of volcanoes starts from near the last in the\r\nneighbourhood of Behring's Straits, and stretches along the whole\r\nwestern coast of the American continent. In this great range there are\r\nabout eighty active volcanoes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LINEAR ARRANGEMENT OF VOLCANOES.]\r\n\r\nIn considering the facts connected with the distribution of volcanoes\r\nupon the globe, the one which, by its striking character, seems to\r\ndemand our attention in the first instance is that of the remarkable\r\nlinear arrangement of volcanic vents. We have already seen that small\r\nscoria-cones are often thrown up on the flanks, or at the base, of a\r\ngreat volcanic mountain, along lines which are manifestly lines of\r\nfissure. In the eruption of Etna, in 1865, and again in that of 1874,\r\nProfessor Silvestri, of Catania, witnessed the actual opening of great\r\nfissures on the north-east and north sides of the mountain: and\r\nalong the bottom of these cracks the glowing lava was clearly visible\r\n(fig. 84, page 194). In the course of a few days, there were thrown\r\nup a number of small scoria-cones along these lines of fissure--those\r\nformed on the fissure of 1865 being seven in number, and those on the\r\nfissure of 1874 being no less than thirty-six in number. Precisely\r\nfamiliar phenomena were witnessed upon the slopes of Vesuvius, in 1760,\r\nwhen a fissure opened on the south side of the mountain, and fifteen\r\nscoria-cones, which are still visible, were thrown up along it.\r\n\r\nWe have already considered the evidence pointing to the conclusion that\r\nsystems of volcanoes, like that of the Lipari Islands, are similarly\r\nranged along lines of fissures, and there is equally good ground for\r\nbelieving that the great linear bands of volcanoes, which, as we\r\nhave seen, stretch for thousands of miles, have had their positions\r\ndetermined by great lines of fissure in the earth's crust. While,\r\nhowever, the smaller fissures, upon which rows of scoria-cones are\r\nthrown up, seem to have been in many cases opened by a single effort\r\nof the volcanic forces, the enormous fissures, which traverse so large\r\na portion of the surface of the globe, are doubtless the result of\r\nnumerous manifestations of energy extending over vast periods of time.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of these bands along which the volcanic forces are so\r\npowerfully exhibited at the present day, is the one which stretches\r\nfrom near the Arctic circle at Behring's Straits to the Antarctic\r\ncircle at South Victoria. The line followed by this volcanic band,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, includes more than one half of the active\r\nvolcanoes of the globe, is a very sinuous one, and it gives off\r\nnumerous offshoots upon either side of it. The great focus of this\r\nintense volcanic action may be regarded as lying in the district\r\nbetween the islands of Borneo and New Guinea. From this centre there\r\nradiate a number of great lines, along which the volcanic forces are\r\nexhibited in the most powerful manner. The first of these extends\r\nnorthwards through the Philippine Isles, Japan, the Kurile Islands, and\r\nKamtschatka, giving off a branch to the east, which passes through the\r\nAleutian Islands and the peninsula of Alaska. This band, along which\r\nthe volcanic forces are very powerfully active, is continued towards\r\nthe south-east in the New Britain, the Solomon Islands, Santa Cruz, the\r\nNew Hebrides, New Zealand, and South Victoria. East and west from the\r\ngreat central focus there proceed two principal branches. The former\r\nof these extends through the Navigator Islands and Friendly Islands\r\nas far as Elizabeth Islands. The latter passes through Java, and then\r\nturns north-westward through Sumatra, the Nicobar Islands, the Andaman\r\nIslands up to the coast of Burmah.\r\n\r\nThe great band which we have been describing exhibits the most\r\nstriking examples of volcanic activity to be found upon the globe.\r\nBesides the 150 or more volcanoes which are known to have been in a\r\nstate of activity during the historical period, there are several\r\nhundred very perfect volcanic cones, many of which appear to have but\r\nrecently become extinct, if indeed, they are not simply in a dormant\r\ncondition. For long distances these chains of volcanic cones are almost\r\ncontinuous, and the only very considerable breaks in the series are\r\nthose between New Zealand and the New Hebrides on the one hand, and\r\nbetween the former islands and South Victoria on the other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GREAT VOLCANIC BANDS OF THE GLOBE.]\r\n\r\nMuch less continuous, but nevertheless very important, is the great\r\nband of volcanoes which extends along the western side of the great\r\nAmerican continent, and contains, with its branches, nearly a hundred\r\nactive volcanoes. On the north this great band is almost united with\r\nthe one we have already described by the chain of the Aleutian and\r\nAlaska volcanoes. In British Columbia about the parallel of 60° N.\r\nthere exist a number of volcanic mountains, one of which, Mount St.\r\nElias, is believed to be 18,000 feet in height, and several of these\r\nhave certainly been seen in a state of eruption. Farther south in the\r\npart of the United States, territories drained by the Columbia River,\r\na number of grand volcanic mountains exist, some of which are probably\r\nstill active, for geysers and other manifestations of volcanic activity\r\nabound. From the southern extremity of the peninsula of California\r\nan almost continuous chain of volcanoes stretches through Mexico and\r\nGuatemala, and from this part of the volcanic band a branch is given\r\noff which passes through the West Indies, and forms a connection with\r\nthe great volcanic band of the Atlantic Ocean. In South America the\r\nline is continued by the active volcanoes of Ecuador, Bolivia and\r\nChili, but at many intermediate points in the chain of the Andes\r\nextinct volcanoes occur, which to a great extent fill up the gaps\r\nin the series. A small offshoot to the westward passes through the\r\nGalapagos Islands. The great band of volcanoes which stretches through\r\nthe American continent is second only in importance, and in the\r\nactivity of its vents, to the band which divides the Pacific from the\r\nIndian Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe third volcanic band of the globe is that which traverses the\r\nAtlantic Ocean from north to south. This series of volcanic mountains\r\nis much more broken and interrupted than the other two, and a greater\r\nproportion of its vents are extinct. This chain, as we shall show in a\r\nfuture chapter, attained its condition of maximum activity during the\r\ndistant period of the Miocene, and now appears to be passing into a\r\nstate of gradual extinction. Beginning in the north with the volcanic\r\nrocks of Greenland and Bear Island, we pass southwards, by way of Jan\r\nMayen, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, to the Hebrides and the north\r\nof Ireland. Thence by way of the Azores, the Canaries and the Cape de\r\nVerde Islands, with some active vents, we pass to the ruined volcanoes\r\nof St. Paul, Fernando de Noronha, Ascension, St. Helena, Trinidad and\r\nTristan d'Acunha. From this great Atlantic band two branches proceed\r\nto the eastward, one through Central Europe, where all the vents are\r\nnow extinct, and the other through the Mediterranean to Asia Minor,\r\nthe great majority of the volcanoes along the latter line being now\r\nextinct, though a few are still active. The vol canoes on the eastern\r\ncoast of Africa may be regarded as situated on another branch from this\r\nAtlantic volcanic band. The number of active volcanoes on this Atlantic\r\nband and its branches, exclusive of those in the West Indies, does not\r\nexceed fifty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LENGTH OF THE VOLCANIC BANDS.]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it will be seen that, not only do the\r\nvolcanoes of the globe usually assume a linear arrangement, but nearly\r\nthe whole of them can be shown to be thrown up along three well-marked\r\nbands and the branches proceeding from them. The first and most\r\nimportant of these bands is nearly 10,000 miles in length, and with its\r\nbranches contains more than 150 active volcanoes; the second is 8,000\r\nmiles in length, and includes about 100 active volcanoes; the third is\r\nmuch more broken and interrupted, extends to a length of nearly 1,000\r\nmiles, and contains about 50 active vents. The volcanoes of the eastern\r\ncoast of Africa, with Mauritius, Bourbon, Rodriguez, and the vents\r\nalong the line of the Red Sea, may be regarded as forming a fourth and\r\nsubordinate band.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the surface of the globe is covered by a network\r\nof volcanic bands, all of which traverse it in sinuous lines with a\r\ngeneral north-and-south direction, giving off branches which often\r\nrun for hundreds of miles, and sometimes appear to form a connection\r\nbetween the great bands.\r\n\r\nThese four bands of volcanic vents, running in a general\r\nnorth-and-south direction, separate four unequal areas within which the\r\nexhibitions of volcanic activity are feeble or quite unknown. The two\r\ngrandest of the bands of volcanic activity, with their branches, form\r\nan almost complete series encircling the largest of the oceans.\r\n\r\nTo this rule of the linear arrangement of the volcanic vents of the\r\nglobe and their accumulation along certain well-marked bands, there are\r\ntwo very striking exceptions, which we must now proceed to notice.\r\n\r\nIn the very centre of the continent formed by Europe and Asia, the\r\nlargest unbroken land-mass of the globe, there rises from the great\r\ncentral plateau the remarkable volcanoes of the Thian Shan Range.\r\nThe existence of these volcanoes, of which only obscure traditional\r\naccounts had reached Europe before the year 1858, appears to be\r\ncompletely established by the researches of the Russian traveller\r\nSemenof. Three volcanic vents appear to exist in this region: the\r\nactive volcanoes of Boschan and Turfan or Hot-schen, and the solfatara\r\nof Urumtsi. At a point situated about half-way between these three\r\nvolcanoes and the sea, another active vent, that of Ujung-Holdongi, is\r\nsaid to exist. Other volcanic phenomena have been stated to occur in\r\nthe great plateau of Central Asia, but the existence of some at least\r\nof these appears to rest on very doubtful evidence. The only accounts\r\nwhich we have of the eruptions of these Thian Shan volcanoes are\r\ncontained in Chinese histories and treatises on geography; and a great\r\nservice would be rendered to science could they be visited by some\r\ncompetent explorer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXCEPTIONALLY-SITUATED VOLCANOES.]\r\n\r\nThe second exceptionally-situated volcanic group is that of the\r\nSandwich Islands. While the Thian Shan volcanoes rise in the centre of\r\nthe largest unbroken land-mass, and stand on the edge of the loftiest\r\nand greatest plateau in the world, the volcanoes of the Sandwich\r\nIslands rise almost in the centre of the largest ocean and from almost\r\nthe greatest depths in that ocean. All round the Sandwich Islands the\r\nsea has a depth of from 2,000 to 3,000 fathoms, and the island-group\r\nculminates in several volcanic cones which rise to the height of nearly\r\n14,000 feet above the sea-level. The volcanoes of the Sandwich Islands\r\nare unsurpassed in height and bulk by those of any other part of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the two isolated groups of the Thian Shan and\r\nthe Sandwich Islands, nearly all the active volcanoes of the globe\r\nare situated near the limits which separate the great land- and\r\nwater-masses of the globe--that is to say, they occur either on the\r\nparts of continents not far removed from their coast-lines, or on\r\nislands in the ocean not very distant from the shores.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the general proximity of volcanoes to the sea, is one which\r\nhas frequently been pointed out by geographers, and may now be regarded\r\nas being thoroughly established. Even the apparently anomalous case of\r\nthe Thian Shan volcanoes is susceptible of explanation if we remember\r\nthe fact, now well ascertained by geological researches, that as\r\nlate certainly as Pliocene times, a great inland sea spread over the\r\ndistricts where the Caspian, the Sea of Aral, and many other isolated\r\nlakes are now found. Upon the southern shore of this sea rose the\r\nvolcanoes of the Thian Shan, some of which have not yet fallen into a\r\nstate of complete extinction.\r\n\r\nBut although the facts concerning the general proximity of volcanoes to\r\nthe ocean may be admitted to be thoroughly established, yet inferences\r\nare sometimes hastily drawn from these facts which the latter, if\r\nfairly considered, will not be found to warrant. It is frequently\r\nassumed that we may refer all the remarkable phenomena of volcanic\r\naction to the penetration of sea-water to a mass of incandescent lava\r\nin the earth's crust, and to the chemical or mechanical action which\r\nwould result from this meeting of sea-water and molten rock. And this\r\nconclusion is supposed to find support in the circumstance that many\r\nof the gases and volatile substances emitted from volcanic vents are\r\nsuch as would be produced by the decomposition of the various salts\r\ncontained in sea-water.\r\n\r\nThis argument in favour of the production of volcanic outbursts by\r\nthe irruption of sea-water into subterranean reservoirs, involves, as\r\nMr. Scrope long ago pointed out, a curious example of reasoning in a\r\ncircle. It is assumed, on the one hand, that the heaving subterranean\r\nmovements, which give rise to the fissures by which steam and other\r\ngases escape to the surface, are the result of the passage of water\r\nto heated masses in the earth's crust. But, on the other hand, it is\r\nsupposed that it is the production of these fissures which leads to\r\nthe influx of water to the heated materials. If it is the passage of\r\nwater through these fissures which produces the eruptions, it may be\r\nfairly asked, what is it that gives rise to the fissures? And if, on\r\nthe other hand, there exist subterranean forces competent to produce\r\nthe fissures, may they not also give rise to the eruptions through the\r\nopenings which they have originated? Nor does the chemical argument\r\nappear to rest upon any surer ground. It is true that many of the\r\nvolatile substances emitted from volcanic vents are such as might be\r\nproduced by the decomposition of sea-water, but, upon the other hand,\r\nthere are not a few substances which cannot possibly be regarded as so\r\nproduced, and, all the materials may equally well be supposed to have\r\nbeen originally imprisoned in the masses of subterranean lava.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAUSE OF PROXIMITY OF VOLCANOES TO SEA.]\r\n\r\nThe problem before us is this. Granting that it is proved that active\r\nvolcanoes are always in close proximity to the ocean, are we to explain\r\nthe fact by supposing that the agency of sea-water is necessary to\r\nvolcanic outbursts, or by regarding the position of the coast-lines\r\nas to some extent determined by the distribution of volcanic action\r\nupon the surface of the globe? The first supposition is the one which\r\nperhaps most readily suggests itself, but the latter, as we shall\r\nhereafter show, is one in favour of which not a few weighty arguments\r\nmay be advanced.\r\n\r\nAnother problem which suggests itself in connection with the\r\ndistribution of volcanoes is the following. Are the great depressed\r\ntracts which form the bottom of the oceans, like the elevated tracts\r\nwhich constitute the continents, equally free from exhibitions of\r\nvolcanic energy?\r\n\r\nWhen we remember the fact that the area of the ocean beds is two and\r\nthree-quarter times as great as that of the continents, it will be seen\r\nhow important this question of the existence of volcanoes at the bottom\r\nof the ocean really is.\r\n\r\nThe fact that recent deep-sea soundings have shown the deepest parts\r\nof the ocean to be everywhere covered with volcanic _débris_ is by\r\nno means conclusive upon this question; for, as we have seen, the\r\nejections of sub-aerial volcanoes are by the wind and waves distributed\r\nover every part of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUBMARINE ERUPTIONS.]\r\n\r\nSubmarine volcanic outbursts have occurred in many parts of the\r\nglobe, but it may well be doubted whether any such outburst has ever\r\ncommenced at the bottom of a deep ocean, and has succeeded in building\r\nup a volcanic cone reaching to the surface. Most, if not all, of the\r\nrecorded submarine outbursts have occurred in the midst of volcanic\r\ndistricts, and the volcanic cones have been built up in water of no\r\ngreat depth. Indeed, when it is remembered that the pressure of each\r\n1,000 fathoms of water is equivalent to a weight of more than one ton\r\non every square inch of the ocean-bottom, it is difficult to imagine\r\nthe ordinary explosive action of volcanic vents taking place at abysmal\r\ndepths. If, however, fissures were opened in the beds of the ocean,\r\nquiet outwellings of lava might possibly occur.\r\n\r\nThe solution of this problem of the probable existence of volcanic\r\noutbursts on the floor of the ocean can only be hoped for from the\r\nresearches of the geologist. The small specimens of the ocean-beds\r\nbrought up by deep-sea sounding-lines, taken at wide distances apart,\r\nand including but a few inches from the surface, can certainly afford\r\nbut little information upon the question. But the geologist has the\r\nopportunity of studying the sea-bottoms of various geological periods\r\nwhich have been upheaved and are now exposed to his view. It was at\r\none time supposed by geologists that in the so-called 'trap-rocks' we\r\nhave great lava-sheets which must have been piled upon one another,\r\nwithout explosive action. But the more accurate researches of recent\r\nyears have shown that between the layers of 'trap-rock,' in every part\r\nof the globe, traces of terrestrial surfaces and freshwater deposits\r\nare found; and the supposed proofs of the absence of explosive action\r\nbreak down no less signally upon re-examination; for the loose,\r\nscoriaceous materials would either be removed by denudation, or\r\nconverted into hard and solid rocks by the infilling of their vesicles\r\nand air-cavities with crystalline minerals. It is not possible, among\r\nthe representatives of former geological periods, to point to any rocks\r\nthat can be fairly regarded as having issued from great submarine\r\nfissures, and it is therefore fair to conclude that no such great\r\noutbursts of the volcanic forces take plane at the present day on the\r\ndeep ocean-floors.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the question of the relation between the position of\r\nthe volcanic bands of the globe and the areas covered by the ocean, we\r\nmay mention a fact which deep-sea soundings appear to indicate, namely,\r\nthat the deepest holes in the ocean-floor are situated in volcanic\r\nareas. Near Japan, the soundings of the U.S. ship 'Tuscarora' showed\r\nthat at two points the depth exceeded 4,000 fathoms; and the deepest\r\nsounding obtained by H.M.S. 'Challenger,' amounting to 4,575 fathoms,\r\nwas taken in the voyage from New Gruinea to Japan, in the neighbourhood\r\nof the Ladrone Islands. Depths nearly as great were found in the\r\nsoundings carried on in the neighbourhood of the volcanic group of the\r\nWest Indian Islands. It must be remembered, however, that at present\r\nour knowledge of the depths of the abysmal portions of the ocean is\r\nvery limited. A few lines of soundings, often taken at great distances\r\napart, are all we have to guide us to any conclusions concerning the\r\nfloors of the great oceans, and between these lines are enormous areas\r\nwhich still remain altogether unexplored. It may be wise, therefore, to\r\nsuspend our judgment upon such questions till more numerous facts have\r\nbeen obtained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RELATIONS TO MOUNTAIN-CHAINS.]\r\n\r\nAnother fact concerning the distribution of volcanoes which is worthy\r\nof remark is their relation to the great mountain-ranges of the globe.\r\n\r\nMany of the grandest mountain-chains have bands of volcanoes\r\nlying parallel to them. This is stinkingly exhibited by the great\r\nmountain-masses which lie on the western side of the American\r\ncontinent. The Rocky Mountains and the Andes consist of folded and\r\ncrumpled masses of altered strata which, by the action of denuding\r\nforces, have been carved into series of ridges and summits. At many\r\npoints, however, along the sides of these great chains, we find that\r\nfissures have been opened and lines of volcanoes formed, from which\r\nenormous quantities of lava have flowed and covered great tracts of\r\ncountry. At some parts of the chain, however, the volcanoes are of such\r\nheight and dimensions as to overlook and dwarf the mountain-ranges by\r\nthe side of which they lie. Some of the volcanoes lying parallel to the\r\ngreat American axis appear to be quite extinct, while others are in\r\nfull activity.\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern continent we find still more striking examples of\r\nthe parallelism between great mountain-chains and the lands along\r\nwhich volcanic activity is exhibited. Stretching in a more or less\r\ncontinuous chain from east to west, through Europe and Asia, we find\r\nthe mountain-masses known in different parts of their course as the\r\nPyrenees, the Alps, the Balkan, the Caucasus, which form the axis\r\nof the Eastern continent. These chains consist of numerous parallel\r\nridges, and give off branches on either side of them. They are\r\ncontinued to the eastward by the Hindoo Koosh and the Himalaya, with\r\nthe four parallel ranges that cross the great Central-Asian plateau.\r\nNow, on either side of this grand axial system of mountains, we find\r\na great parallel band of volcanoes. The northern volcanic band is\r\nconstituted by the eruptive rocks of the Auvergne, the Eifel, the\r\nSiebengebirge, Central Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, and Transylvania,\r\nfew, if any, of the vents along this northern band being still active.\r\nThe remarkable volcanoes of the Thian Shan range and of Mantchouria may\r\nnot improbably be regarded as a continuation of the same great series.\r\n\r\nThe southern band of volcanoes, lying parallel to the great mountain\r\naxis of the Old World, also consists for the most part of extinct\r\nvolcanoes, but includes not a few vents which are still active. In\r\nthis band we include the extinct volcanoes of Spain and Sardinia, the\r\nnumerous extinct and active vents of the Italian peninsula and islands,\r\nand those of the Ægean Sea and Asia Minor. We may, perhaps, consider\r\nthe scattered volcanoes of Arabia and the northern part of the Indian\r\nOcean as a continuation of the same series. Both of these bands may\r\nbe regarded as offshoots from the great mid-Atlantic volcanic chain,\r\nand the condition of the vents, both in the principal band and its\r\noffshoots, is such as to indicate that they form parts of a system\r\nwhich is gradually sinking into a state of complete extinction.\r\n\r\nThere are some other volcanic bands which exhibit a similar parallelism\r\nwith mountain chains; but, on the other hand, there are some volcanoes\r\nbetween which and the nearest mountain axes no such connection can be\r\ntraced.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RELATION TO AREAS OF UPHEAVAL.]\r\n\r\nThere is yet one other fact concerning the mode of distribution of\r\nvolcanoes upon the surface of the globe, to which we must allude. It\r\nwas first established by Mr. Darwin as one of the conclusions derived\r\nfrom the valuable series of observations made by him during the voyage\r\nof H.M.S. 'Beagle,' and relates to the position of active volcanoes\r\nwith respect to the portions of the earth's crust which are undergoing\r\nupheaval or subsidence.\r\n\r\nFrom the relative position of the different kinds of coral-reefs, and\r\nthe fact that reef-forming corals cannot live at a depth of more than\r\ntwenty fathoms beneath the sea-level, or above tide-mark, we are led to\r\nthe conclusion that certain areas of the earth's surface are undergoing\r\nslow elevation, while other parts are as gradually subsiding. This\r\nconclusion is confirmed by the occurrence of raised beaches, which\r\nare sometimes found at heights of hundreds, or even thousands, of\r\nfeet above the sea-level, and of submerged forests, which are not\r\nunfrequently found beneath the waters of the ocean.\r\n\r\nBy a study of the evidences presented by coral-reefs, raised beaches,\r\nsubmerged forests, and other phenomena of a similar kind, it can be\r\nshown that certain wide areas of the land and of the ocean-floor are\r\nat the present time in a state of subsidence, while other equally\r\nlarge areas are being upheaved. And the observations of the geologist\r\nprove that similar upward and downward movements of portions of the\r\nearth's crust have been going on through all geological times. Now,\r\nas Mr. Darwin has so well shown in his work on 'Coral-Reefs,' if we\r\ntrace upon a map the areas of the earth's surface which are undergoing\r\nupheaval and subsidence respectively, we shall find that nearly all the\r\nactive volcanoes of the globe are situated upon rising areas, and that\r\nvolcanic phenomena are conspicuously absent from those parts of the\r\nearth's crust which can be proved at the present day to be undergoing\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nVOLCANIC ACTION AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE EARTH'S HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is only in comparatively recent times that the important doctrine of\r\ngeological continuity has come to be generally accepted, as furnishing\r\nus with a complete and satisfactory explanation of the mode of origin\r\nof the features of our globe. The great forces, which are ever at\r\nwork producing modifications in those features, operate so silently\r\nand slowly, though withal so surely, that without the closest and\r\nmost attentive observation their effects may be easily overlooked;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, there are so many phenomena upon our globe\r\nwhich seem at first sight to bear testimony to the action of sudden\r\nand catastrophic forces, very different to any which appear to be at\r\npresent at work, that the tendency to account for all past changes by\r\nthese violent actions is a very strong one. In spite of this tendency,\r\nhowever, the real potency of the forces now at work upon the earth's\r\ncrust has gradually made its way to recognition, and the capability of\r\nthese forces, when their effects are accumulated through sufficiently\r\nlong periods of time, to bring about the grandest changes, is now\r\nalmost universally admitted. The modern science of geology is based\r\nupon the principle that the history of the formation and development\r\nof the earth's surface-features, and of the organisms upon it, has\r\nbeen continuous during enormous periods of time, and that in the study\r\nof the operations taking place upon the earth at the present day, we\r\nmay find the true key to the changes which have occurred during former\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nIn no branch of geological science has the doctrine of continuity\r\nhad to encounter so much opposition and misconception as in that\r\nwhich relates to the volcanic phenomena of the globe. For a long time\r\nstudents of rocks utterly failed to recognise any relation between the\r\nmaterials which have been ejected from active volcanic vents and those\r\nwhich have been formed by similar agencies at earlier periods of the\r\nearth's history. And what was far worse, the subject became removed\r\nfrom the sphere of practical scientific inquiry to that of theological\r\ncontroversy, those who maintained the volcanic origin of some of the\r\nolder rocks being branded as the worst of heretics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONTROVERSY CONCERNING ORIGIN OF BASALT.]\r\n\r\nWith the theological aspects of the great controversy concerning the\r\norigin of basalt and similar rocks--a controversy which was carried\r\non with such violence and acrimony during the latter half of the\r\neighteenth century--we have here nothing to do. But it may not be\r\nuninstructive to notice the causes of the strange misconceptions which\r\nfor so long a period stood in the way of the acceptance of rational\r\nviews upon the subject.\r\n\r\nAt this period but little had been done in studying the chemical\r\ncharacters of aqueous and igneous rock-masses respectively; and while,\r\non the one hand, the close similarity in chemical composition between\r\nthe ancient basalts and many modern lavas was not recognised, the\r\nmarked distinction between the composition of such materials and most\r\naqueous sediments remained, on the other hand, equally unknown. Nor\r\nhad anything been yet accomplished in the direction of the study of\r\nrock-masses by the aid of the microscope. Hence there could be no\r\nappeal to those numerous structural peculiarities that at once enable\r\nus to distinguish the most crystalline aqueous rocks from the materials\r\nof igneous origin.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there undoubtedly exist rocks of a black colour\r\nand crystalline structure, sometimes presenting a striking similarity\r\nin general appearance to the basalts, which contain fossils and are\r\nundoubtedly of aqueous origin. Thus on the shore near Portrush, in the\r\nNorth of Ireland, and in the skerries which lie off that coast, there\r\noccur great rock-masses, some of which undoubtedly agree with basalt in\r\nall their characters, while others are dark-coloured and crystalline,\r\nand are frequently crowded with _Ammonites_ and other fossils. We now\r\nknow that the explanation of these facts is as follows. Near where\r\nthe town of Portrush is now situated, a volcanic vent was opened in\r\nMiocene times through rocks of Lias shale. From this igneous centre,\r\nsheets and dykes of basaltic lava were given off, and in consequence\r\nof their contact with these masses of lava, the Lias shales were baked\r\nand altered, and assumed a crystalline character, though the traces of\r\nthe fossils contained in them were not altogether obliterated. In the\r\nlast century the methods which had been devised for the discrimination\r\nof rocks were so imperfect that no distinction was recognised between\r\nthe true basalt and the altered shale, and specimens of the latter\r\ncontaining _Ammonites_ found their way to almost every museum in\r\nEurope, and were used as illustrations of the 'origin of basalt by\r\naqueous precipitation.'\r\n\r\nAnother source of the widely-spread error which prevailed concerning\r\nthe origin of basalt, was the failure to recognise the nature of\r\nthe alterations which take place in the character of rock-masses in\r\nconsequence of the passage through them, during enormous periods of\r\ntime, of water containing carbonic acid and other active chemical\r\nagents. The casual observer does not recognise the resemblance which\r\nexists between certain ornamental marbles and the loose accumulations\r\nof shells and corals which form many sea-beaches; but close examination\r\nshows that the former consist of the same materials as the latter,\r\nbound together by a crystalline infilling of carbonate of lime, which\r\nhas been deposited in all the cavities and interstices of the mass. In\r\nthe same way, as we have already seen, the vesicles and interstices\r\nof heaps of scoriæ may, by the percolation of water through the mass,\r\nbecome so filled with various crystalline substances, that its original\r\ncharacters are entirely masked.\r\n\r\nBut the progress of chemical and microscopic research has effectually\r\nremoved these sources of error. Many rocks of aqueous origin, formerly\r\nconfounded with the basalts, have now been relegated to their proper\r\nplaces among the different classes of rocks; while, on the other\r\nhand, it has been shown that the chemical and physical differences\r\nbetween the ancient basalts and the modern basic lavas are slight\r\nand accidental, and their resemblances are of the closest and most\r\nfundamental character.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VOLCANIC ORIGIN OF 'TRAP ROCKS.']\r\n\r\nThe notion of the aqueous origin of basalt, which was so long\r\nmaintained by the school of Werner, has now been entirely abandoned,\r\nand the so-called 'trap-rocks' are at the present day recognised as\r\nbeing as truly volcanic in their origin as the lavas of Etna and\r\nVesuvius.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a vestige of this doctrine of Werner, which still\r\nmaintains its ground with obstinate persistence. Many geologists in\r\nGermany who admit that volcanic phenomena, similar to those which are\r\ngoing on at the present day, must have occurred during the Tertiary and\r\nthe later Secondary periods, nevertheless insist that among the earlier\r\nrecords of the world's history we find no evidence whatever of such\r\nvolcanic action having taken place. By the geologists who hold these\r\nviews it is asserted that while the granites and other plutonic rocks\r\nwere formed during the earlier periods of the world's history, true\r\nvolcanic products are only known in connection with the sediment of the\r\nlater geological periods.\r\n\r\nSome geologists have gone farther even than this, and asserted that\r\neach of the great geological periods is characterised by the nature\r\nof the igneous ejections which have taken place in it. They declare\r\nthat granite was formed only during the earliest geological periods,\r\nand that at later dates the gabbros, diabases, porphyries, dolerites\r\nand basalts, successively made their appearance, and finally that the\r\nmodern lavas were poured out.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will suffice to convince us that these\r\nconclusions are not based upon any good evidence. The plutonic rocks,\r\nas we have already seen, exhibit sufficient proofs in their highly\r\ncrystalline character, and in their cavities containing water,\r\nliquefied carbonic acid, and other volatile substances, that they must\r\nhave been formed by the very slow consolidation of igneous materials\r\nunder enormous pressure. Such pressures, it is evident, could only\r\nexist at great depths beneath the earth's surface. Mr. Sorby and\r\nothers have endeavoured to calculate what was the actual thickness of\r\nrock under which certain granites must have been formed, by measuring\r\nthe amount of contraction in the liquids which have been imprisoned\r\nin the crystals of these rocks. The conclusions arrived at are of a\r\nsufficiently startling character. It is inferred that the granites\r\nwhich have been thus examined must have consolidated at depths varying\r\nfrom 30,000 to 80,000 feet beneath the earth's surface. It is true\r\nthat in arriving at these results certain assumptions have to be made,\r\nand to these exception may be taken, but the general conclusion that\r\ngranitic rocks could only have been formed under such high pressures as\r\nexist at great depths beneath the surface, appears to be one which is\r\nnot open to reasonable doubt.\r\n\r\nIf, then, granites and similar rocks were formed at the depth of some\r\nmiles, it is evident that they can only have made their appearance at\r\nthe surface by the removal of the vast thickness of overlying rocks;\r\nand the sole agency which we know of that is capable of effecting the\r\nremoval of such enormous quantities of rock-materials, is denudation.\r\nBut the agents of denudation--rain and frost, rivers and glaciers, and\r\nsea-waves--though producing grand results, yet work exceeding slowly;\r\nand almost inconceivably long periods of time must have elapsed before\r\nmasses of rock several miles in thickness could have been removed, and\r\nthe subjacent granites and other highly crystalline rocks have been\r\nexposed at the surface.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANCIENT AND MODERN VOLCANIC ROCKS.]\r\n\r\nIt is an admitted fact that among the older geological formations, we\r\nmuch more frequently find intrusions of granitic rocks than in the case\r\nof younger ones. It is equally true that among the sediments formed\r\nduring the most recent geological periods, no true granitic rocks have\r\nbeen detected. But if, as we insist is the case, granitic rocks can\r\nonly be formed at a great depth from the surface, the £acts we have\r\ndescribed are only just what we might expect to present themselves\r\nunder the circumstances. The older a mass of granitic rock, the greater\r\nchance there is that the denuding forces operating upon the overlying\r\nmasses, will have had an opportunity of so far removing the latter\r\nas to expose the underlying crystalline rocks at the surface. And,\r\non the other hand, the younger crystalline rocks are still, for the\r\nmost part, buried under such enormous thicknesses of superincumbent\r\nmaterials that it is hopeless for us to search for them. Nevertheless,\r\nit does occasionally happen that, where the work of denudation has been\r\nexceptionally rapid in its action, such crystalline rocks formed during\r\na comparatively recent geological period, are exposed at the surface.\r\nThis is the case in the Western Isles of Scotland and in the Pyrenees,\r\nwhere masses of granite and other highly crystalline rocks are found\r\nwhich were evidently formed during the Tertiary period.\r\n\r\nThe granites which were formed in Tertiary times present no essential\r\npoints of difference from those which had their origin during the\r\nearlier periods of the earth's history. The former, like the latter,\r\nconsist of a mass of crystals with no imperfectly crystalline base or\r\ngroundmass between them; and these crystals include numerous cavities\r\ncontaining liquids.\r\n\r\nBetween the granites and the quartz-felsites every possible\r\ngradation may be found, so that it is impossible to say where the one\r\ngroup ends and the other begins; indeed, many of the rocks called\r\n'granite-porphyries' have about equal claims to be placed in either\r\nclass. Nor is the distinction between the quartz-felsites and rhyolites\r\nany more strongly marked than that between the former class of rocks\r\nand the granites; some of the more crystalline rhyolites of Hungary\r\nbeing quite undistinguishable, in their chemical composition, their\r\nmineralogical constitution, and their microscopic characters, from\r\nthe quartz-felsites. The more crystalline rhyolites are in turn found\r\npassing by insensible gradations into the glassy varieties and finally\r\ninto obsidian.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RELATIONS BETWEEN GRANITE AND PUMICE.]\r\n\r\nA piece of granite and a piece of pumice may at first sight appear to\r\npresent so many points of difference, that it would seem quite futile\r\nto attempt to discover any connection between them. Yet, if we analyse\r\nthe two substances, we may find that in ultimate chemical composition\r\nthey are absolutely identical. There is nothing irrational, therefore,\r\nin the conclusion that the same materials under different conditions\r\nmay assume either the characters of granite on the one hand, or of\r\npumice on the other; the former being consolidated under circumstances\r\nin which the chemical and crystalline forces have had the freest play\r\nand have used up the whole of the materials to form crystallised\r\nminerals, while the latter has cooled down and solidified rapidly at\r\nthe surface, in such a way that only incipient crystallisation has\r\noccurred, and the glassy mass has been reduced to a frothy condition\r\nby the escape of steam-bubbles from its midst This conclusion receives\r\nthe strongest support from the fact that examples of every stage of\r\nthe change, between the glassy condition of pumice and the crystalline\r\ncondition of granite, may be detected among the materials of which the\r\nglobe is built up.\r\n\r\nThere is still another class of facts which may be adduced in\r\nsupport of the same conclusion. Many lavas, as we have seen, contain\r\ncrystals of much larger dimensions than those constituting the mass\r\nof the rock, which is then said to be 'porphyritic' in structure.\r\nThe porphyritically embedded crystals, when carefully examined, are\r\noften seen to be broken and injured, and to exhibit rounded edges,\r\nwith other indications of having undergone transport. When examined\r\nmicroscopically, too, they often present the cavities containing\r\nliquids which distinguish the crystals of plutonic rocks. All the\r\nfacts connected with these porphyritic lavas point to the conclusion\r\nthat while the crystals in their groundmass have separated from the\r\nliquefied materials near the surface, the large embedded crystal, have\r\nbeen floated up from great depths within the earth's crust, where they\r\nhad been originally formed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GRANITIC REPRESENTATIVES OF OTHER LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nThe careful consideration of all the facts of the case leads to the\r\nconclusion that where pumice, obsidian, and rhyolite are now being\r\nejected at the surface, the materials which form these substances\r\nare, at various depths in the earth's interior, slowly consolidating\r\nin the form of quartz-felsite, granite-porphyry and granite. It may\r\nbe that we can nowhere point to the example of a mass of rock which\r\ncan be traced from subterranean regions to the surface, and is, under\r\nsuch conditions, actually seen to pass from the dense and crystalline\r\ncondition of granite to the vesicular and glassy form of pumice;\r\nbut great granitic masses often exhibit a more coarsely crystalline\r\ncondition in their interior, and the offshoots and dykes which they\r\ngive off not infrequently assume the form of quartz-felsite; while,\r\non the other hand, the more slowly consolidated rocks found in the\r\ninterior of some rhyolite masses are not distinguishable in any way\r\nfrom some of the true quartz-felsites.\r\n\r\nThat which is true of the lavas of acid composition is equally true\r\nof the lavas of intermediate and basic character. The andesites,\r\nthe trachytes, the phonolites, and the basalts have all their exact\r\nrepresentatives among the plutonic rocks, and these have a perfectly\r\ncrystalline or granitic structure. The plutonic and the volcanic\r\nrepresentatives of each of these groups are identical in their chemical\r\ncomposition, and numerous intermediate gradations can be found between\r\nthe most completely granitic and the most perfectly vitreous or glassy\r\ntypes. In illustration of this fact, we may again refer to the series\r\nof microscopic sections of rocks given in the frontispiece.\r\n\r\nAnother objection to the conclusion that the volcanic products of\r\nearlier periods of the earth's history were identical in character with\r\nthose which are being ejected at the present day is based on the fact\r\nof the supposed non-existence of the scoriaceous and glassy materials\r\nwhich abound in the neighbourhood of the active volcanic vents. Where,\r\nit is asked, do we find among the older rocks of the globe the heaps of\r\nlapilli, dust, and scoriæ, with the glassy and pumiceous rocks that now\r\noccur so abundantly in all volcanic districts?\r\n\r\nIn reply to this objection, we may point out that these accumulations\r\nof loose materials are of such a nature as to be capable of easy\r\nremoval by denuding agents, and that as they are formed upon the land\r\nthey will, if not already washed away by the action of rain, floods,\r\nrivers, &c., run great risk of having their materials distributed,\r\nwhen the land sinks beneath the waters of the ocean and the surface\r\nis covered by new deposits. With respect to the glassy rocks it must\r\nbe remembered that the action of water, containing carbonic acid and\r\nother substances, in percolating through such masses has a tendency\r\nto set up crystalline action, and these glassy rocks easily undergo\r\n'devitrification'; it would therefore be illogical for us to expect\r\nglassy rock-masses to retain their vitreous character through long\r\ngeological periods, during which they have been subjected to the action\r\nof water and acid gases.\r\n\r\nBut careful observation has shown that the scoriaceous and vitreous\r\nrocks are by no means absent among the igneous materials ejected during\r\nearlier periods of the earth's history. Their comparative infrequency\r\nis easily accounted for when we remember, in the first place, the ease\r\nwith which such materials would be removed by denuding forces, and in\r\nthe second place, the tendency of the action of percolating water to\r\ndestroy their characteristic features, by filling up their vesicles\r\nwith crystalline products and by effecting devitrification in their\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIMILARITY OF ANCIENT AND RECENT LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nIf we go back to the very oldest known rock-masses of the globe, those\r\nwhich are found underlying the fossiliferous Cambrian strata, we find\r\nabundant evidence that volcanic action took place during the period\r\nin which these materials were being accumulated. Thus, in the Wrekin,\r\nas Mr. Allport has so well shown, we find clear proofs that before\r\nthe long-distant period of the Cambrian, there existed volcanoes\r\nwhich ejected scoriæ, lapilli, and volcanic dust, and also gave rise\r\nto streams of lava exhibiting the characteristic structures found in\r\nglassy rocks. In these rocks, which have undergone a curious alteration\r\nor devitrification, we still find all those peculiar structures--the\r\nsphærulitic, the perlitic, and the banded--so common in the rhyolites\r\nof Hungary, with which rocks the Wrekin lavas, in their chemical\r\ncomposition, precisely agree. Prof. Bonney, too, has shown that the\r\nrocks of Charnwood Forest, which are also probably of pre-Cambrian age,\r\ncontain great quantities of altered volcanic agglomerates, tuffs, and\r\nashes. I have found the sphærulitic, perlitic, and banded structures\r\nexhibited by British lavas of the Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous periods, as well as in those of Tertiary age; and in\r\nconnection with these different lavas we find vast accumulations,\r\nsometimes thousands of feet in thickness, of volcanic agglomerates and\r\ntuffs which have undergone great alteration.\r\n\r\nAll these facts point to one conclusion--namely, that during all past\r\ngeological periods, materials similar to those which are now being\r\nextruded from volcanic vents were poured out on the earth's surface\r\nby analogous agencies. If we could trace the lava-streams of the\r\npresent day down to the great subterranean reservoirs from which their\r\nmaterials have been derived, we should doubtless find that at gradually\r\nincreasing depths, where the pressure would be greater and the escape\r\nof heat from the mass slower, the rocky materials would by degrees\r\nassume more and more crystalline characters. We should thus find\r\nobsidian or rhyolite insensibly passing into quartz-felsite and finally\r\ninto granite; trachyte passing into orthoclase-porphyry and syenite;\r\nand basalt passing into dolerite, augite-porphyry, and gabbro.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we could replace the great masses of stratified\r\nrocks which must once have overlain the granites, syenites, diorites,\r\nand gabbros, we should find that, as we approached the original\r\nsurface, these igneous materials would gradually lose their crystalline\r\ncharacters, and when they were poured out at the surface would take the\r\nforms of rhyolite, trachyte, andesite, and basalt--all of which might\r\noccasionally assume the glassy forms known as obsidian or tachylyte.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALTERED FORMS OF ANCIENT LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nBut while we insist on the essential points of similarity between\r\nthe lavas poured out upon the surface of the earth during earlier\r\ngeological periods and those which are being extruded at the present\r\nday, we must not forget that by the action of percolating water and\r\nacid gases, the mineral constitution, the structure, and sometimes\r\neven the chemical composition of these ancient lavas may undergo\r\na vast amount of change. In not a few cases these changes in the\r\ncharacters of a lava may be carried so far that the altered rock bears\r\nbut little resemblance to the lava from which it was formed, and it may\r\nbe found desirable to give it a new name. Among the rocks of aqueous\r\norigin we find similar differences in the materials deposited at\r\ndifferent geological periods. Clay, shale and clay-slate have the same\r\ncomposition, and the two latter are evidently only altered forms of the\r\nfirst mentioned, yet so great is the difference in their characters\r\nthat it is not only allowable, but desirable, to give them distinctive\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, among the deposits of the earlier geological periods\r\nwe find rocks which were doubtless originally basalts, but in which\r\ngreat alterations have been produced by the percolation of water\r\nthrough the mass. The original rock has consisted of crystals of\r\nfelspar, augite, olivine, and magnetite distributed through a glassy\r\nbase. But the chemical action of water and carbonic acid may have\r\naffected all the ingredients of the rock. The outward form of the\r\nfelspar crystals may be retained while their substance is changed to\r\nkaolinite, various zeolites, and other minerals; the olivine maybe\r\naltered to serpentine and other analogous minerals; the magnetite\r\nchanged to hydrous peroxide of iron; the augite may be changed to\r\nuralite or hornblende; and the surrounding glassy mass more or\r\nless devitrified and decomposed. The hard, dense, and black rock\r\nknown as basalt has under these circumstances become a much softer,\r\nearthy-looking mass of a reddish-brown tint, and its difference from\r\nbasalt is so marked that geologists have agreed to call it by another\r\nname, that of 'melaphyre.' Even in their ultimate chemical compositions\r\nthe 'melaphyres' differ to some extent from the basalts, for some of\r\nthe materials of the latter may have been removed in solution, and\r\nwater, oxygen, and carbonic acid have been introduced to combine with\r\nthe remaining ingredients.\r\n\r\nBut if we carefully study, by the aid of the microscope, a large series\r\nof basalts and melaphyres, we shall find that many rocks of the former\r\nclass show the first incipient traces of those changes which would\r\nreduce them to the latter class. Indeed, it is quite easy to form a\r\nperfect series from quite unaltered basalts to the most completely\r\nchanged melaphyres. Hence we are justified in concluding that all the\r\nmelaphyres were originally basalts, just as we infer that all oaks were\r\nonce acorns.\r\n\r\nNow changes, similar to those which we have seen to take place in\r\nthe case of basaltic lavas, are exhibited by the lavas of every\r\nother class, which have been exposed to the influence of the same\r\nagencies,--namely, the passage of water and acid gases. But inasmuch as\r\nthe minerals composing the basic lavas are for the most part much more\r\neasily affected by such agencies than are the minerals of acid lavas,\r\nthe ancient basic rocks are usually found in a much more highly altered\r\ncondition than are the acid rocks of equivalent age.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NAMES GIVEN TO ALTERED LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nWe thus see that each of the classes of modern lavas has its\r\nrepresentative in earlier geological periods, in the form of rocks\r\nwhich have evidently been derived from these lavas, through alterations\r\neffected by the agency of water and acid-gases that have permeated\r\ntheir mass. Thus, while the basalts are represented among the ancient\r\ngeological formation by the melaphyres, the andesites are represented\r\nby the porphyrites, and the trachytes and rhyolites by different\r\nvarieties of felstones. And, as we can form perfect series illustrating\r\nthe gradual change from basalt to melaphyre, so we can arrange other\r\nseries demonstrating the passage of andesites into porphyrites, and of\r\ntrachytes and rhyolites into felsites.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that these changes do not take place\r\nin anything like determinate periods of time. Occasionally we may\r\nfind lavas of ancient date which have undergone surprisingly little\r\nalteration, and in other cases there occur lavas belonging to a\r\ncomparatively recent period which exhibit very marked signs of change.\r\n\r\nThe alteration of the lavas and other igneous rocks does not, however,\r\nstop with the production of the melaphyres, porphyrites, and felstones.\r\nBy the further action of the water and carbonic acid of the atmosphere,\r\nthe basic lavas are reduced to the soft earthy mass known as 'wacke,'\r\nand the intermediate and acid lavas to the similar material known as\r\n'claystone.' As the passage of water and carbonic acid gas through\r\nthese rock-masses goes on, they are eventually resolved into two\r\nportions, one of which is insoluble in water and the other is soluble.\r\nThe insoluble portion consists principally of quartz, the crystals\r\nof which are almost unattacked by water and carbonic acid, and the\r\nhydrated silicate of alumina. All the sands and clays, which together\r\nmake up more than nine-tenths of the stratified rocks of the globe,\r\nare doubtless derived, either directly or indirectly, from these\r\ninsoluble materials separated during the decomposition of volcanic and\r\nplutonic rocks. The soluble materials, which consist of the carbonates,\r\nsulphates and chlorides of lime, magnesia, soda, potash, and iron,\r\ngive rise to the formation of the limestones, gypsum, rock-salt,\r\nironstones, and other stratified masses of the earth's crust. We thus\r\nsee how the igneous materials of the globe, by their decomposition,\r\nfamish the materials for the stratified rock-masses. The relations of\r\nthe different plutonic and volcanic rocks to one another and to the\r\nmaterials which are derived from them are illustrated in the following\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RELATIONS OF ALTERED TO UNALTERED LAVAS.]\r\n\r\n                                      Unaltered   Altered   Decomposed\r\n          Plutonic Rocks                lavas       lavas      Rocks\r\n\r\n  Granite  {Quartz-felsite       } Rhyolite and }\r\n           {  ('quartz-porphyry')}   Obsidian   } Felstone   }\r\n                                                }            }\r\n  Syenite  {Orthoclase-porphyry  } Trachyte     }            } Claystones\r\n                                                             }\r\n  Diorite  {Hornblende-porphyry  } Andesite       Porphyrite }\r\n\r\n  Miascite {Liebnerite porphyry  } Phonolite          ?         --\r\n\r\n  Gabbro   {Augite-porphyry and  } Basalt         Melaphyre    Wacke\r\n           {Dolerite             }\r\n\r\nSome petrographers, indeed, have maintained the principle that rocks\r\nbelonging to widely separated geological periods, even when they\r\nexhibit no essential points of difference, should nevertheless be\r\ncalled by distinct names. But such a system of classification is\r\ncalculated rather to hinder than to advance the cause of science. If\r\nthe palæontologist were to adopt the same principle and give distinct\r\nnames to the same fossil, when it was found to occur in two different\r\ngeological formations, we can easily understand what confusion would\r\nbe occasioned, and how the comparison of the fauna and flora of the\r\ndifferent formations would be thereby rendered impossible. But the\r\nnaturalist, in his diagnosis of a species, wisely confines himself\r\nto the structure and affinities of the organism before him; and in\r\nthe same way the petrographer, in giving a name to a rock, ought\r\nto be guided only by his studies of its chemical composition, its\r\nmineralogical constitution, and its structure, putting altogether\r\nout of view its geographical distribution and geological age. Only\r\nby strict attention to this principle can we hope to arrive at such\r\ncomparisons of the rocks of different areas and different periods, as\r\nmay serve as the basis for safe inductions.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this question of the relation which exists between the\r\nigneous rocks of different ages, it may be well to notice several facts\r\nthat have been relied upon, as proving that the several geological\r\nperiods are distinguished by characteristic igneous products.\r\n\r\nIt has frequently been asserted that the acid igneous rocks are present\r\nin much greater quantities in connection with the older geological\r\nformations than axe the basic; while, on the other hand, the basic\r\nigneous rocks are said to have been extruded in greater abundance in\r\nthe more recent geological periods. But in considering this question it\r\nmust not be forgotten that, as a general rule, the basic rocks undergo\r\ndecomposition and disintegration far more rapidly than do the acid\r\nrocks. In consequence of this circumstance the chance of our finding\r\ntheir recognisable representatives among the older formations, is much\r\nless in the case of the former class of rocks than in the latter. As a\r\nmatter of fact, however, we do find great masses of gabbro, diabase,\r\nand melaphyre associated even with the oldest geological formations,\r\nwhile trachytes and rhyolites abound in many volcanic districts where\r\nactive vents exist at the present day. Upon a general review of the\r\nsubject, it may well be doubted whether the supposed preponderance of\r\nacid igneous materials in the earlier periods of the earth's history,\r\nand of basic igneous materials during the later periods, rests on any\r\nsubstantial basis of observation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AUGITIC AND HORNBLENDIC ROCKS.]\r\n\r\nAnother difference which has frequently been relied upon, as\r\ndistinguishing the older igneous rocks from those of more recent date,\r\nis the supposed fact that the former are characterised by the presence\r\nof hornblende, the latter by the presence of augite. It may be admitted\r\nthat this distinction is a real one, but its significance and value are\r\ngreatly diminished when we remember the relations which exist between\r\nthe two minerals in question. Hornblende and augite are interesting\r\nexamples of a dimorphous substance; in chemical composition they are\r\nidentical, or rather they are liable to variation between the same\r\nlimits, but in their crystalline forms and optical characters they\r\ndiffer from one another. It has been proved that hornblende is the\r\nstable, and augite the unstable condition of the substance in question.\r\nIf hornblende be fused and allowed to cool, it crystallises in the form\r\nof augite. On the other hand, augite-crystals in rocks of ancient date\r\nare found undergoing gradual change and passing into hornblende. The\r\nmineral uralite has the outward form of augite, but the cleavage and\r\noptical properties of hornblende; and there are not wanting many facts\r\npointing to the conclusion that rocks which now contain hornblende were\r\noriginally augitic masses, in which the unstable mineral in their\r\nmidst has been gradually converted into the stable one.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two minerals which up to the present time have\r\nbeen found in association only with the older and newer rock-masses\r\nrespectively. These are _muscovite_, or the white form of mica, which\r\noccurs in so many granites, but has not yet been discovered in any\r\nmodern representative of that rock; and leucite, which is not yet known\r\nin rocks of older date than the Tertiary.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that muscovite would appear to be a product of\r\ndeep-seated igneous action, and is only found in rock-masses that have\r\nbeen formed under such conditions, we shall be the less surprised at\r\nits non-occurrence in rocks of recent date, especially if we bear in\r\nmind the fact that very few of the younger granitic rocks have as yet\r\nbeen exposed at the surface by denudation.\r\n\r\nWith respect to leucite, on the other hand, it must be remembered that\r\nit is a very unstable mineral which appears to be easily changed into\r\nfelspar. It is by no means improbable, therefore, that some ancient\r\nigneous rocks which now contain felspar were originally leucitic rocks.\r\n\r\nTo the view that the action of volcanic forces upon the globe during\r\npast geological times was similar in kind to that which we now observe\r\ngoing on around us, still another objection has been raised. It has\r\nbeen asserted that some of the deposits of igneous rock associated\r\nwith the older geological formations are of such a nature that they\r\ncould not possibly have been accumulated around volcanic vents of the\r\nkind which we see in operation around us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VOLCANIC ORIGIN OF ANCIENT IGNEOUS ROCKS.]\r\n\r\nMr. Mallet has declared that the igneous products of the Palæozoic\r\nperiod differ fundamentally in character from those materials formed\r\nby volcanic action during the later Secondary and the Tertiary\r\nperiods. Upon what observations these generalisations are based he\r\nhas given us no information, and the enormous mass of facts which\r\nhave been collected in recent years concerning the structure of the\r\nlavas and fragmental volcanic deposits of the pre-Cambrian, Cambrian,\r\nSilurian, Devonian and Carboniferous periods, all point to a directly\r\nopposite conclusion. The more carefully we carry on our investigations\r\nconcerning these ancient lavas, by the aid of chemical analysis and\r\nmicroscopic study, the more are we convinced of the essential identity\r\nof the ancient and modern volcanic rocks, both in their composition\r\nand their minute structure. Of great masses of dust produced by\r\ncrushing, such as Mr. Mallet has supposed to have been formed during\r\nthe earlier geological periods, there is not the smallest evidence;\r\nbut we everywhere find proofs, when the rocks are minutely examined,\r\nof the vesicular structure so characteristic of materials produced by\r\nexplosive volcanic action.\r\n\r\nIt has frequently been asserted that in the great districts covered by\r\nbasaltic lavas which we find in the Rocky Mountains of North America,\r\nin the Deccan of India, in Abyssinia, and even in the Western Isles of\r\nScotland, we have proofs of the occurrence, during earlier geological\r\nperiods, of volcanic action very different in character from that\r\nwhich at present takes place on our globe. It has been asserted that\r\nthe phenomena observed in these districts can only be accounted for by\r\nsupposing that great fissures have opened in their midst, from which\r\nlavas have issued in enormous floods unaccompanied by the ordinary\r\nexplosive phenomena of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, however, that none of the districts in question\r\nhave been subjected to careful and systematic examination with a view\r\nto the discovery of the vents from which these masses of lava have\r\nissued, with the exception of that which occurs in our own islands. In\r\nthis case, in which superficial observers have spoken of the district\r\nas being covered with horizontal lava-sheets piled upon one another to\r\nthe depth of 3,000 feet, careful study of the rock-masses has shown\r\nthat the accumulations of basalt really consist of a great number of\r\nlava-currents which have issued at successive epochs covering enormous\r\nperiods of time. During the intervals between the emission of these\r\nsuccessive lava-currents the surfaces of the older ones have been\r\ndecomposed, and formed soils upon which forests have grown up; they\r\nhave been eroded by streams, the valleys so formed being filled with\r\ngravels; and lakes have been originated on their surfaces in which\r\nvarious accumulations have taken place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TRULY-VOLCANIC ORIGIN OF LAVA PLATEAUX.]\r\n\r\nIt has been demonstrated, moreover, that the basal-wrecks of no less\r\nthan five volcanic mountains, each of which must have rivalled Etna in\r\nits proportions, existed within this area, and the connection of the\r\nlava-currents, which have deluged the surrounding tracts, with these\r\ngreat volcanoes has been clearly proved. It is probable that when\r\nmore careful and systematic researches are carried on in the other\r\ndistricts, in which widely-spread sheets of basaltic rocks exist,\r\nsimilar volcanic vents will be discovered. It must also be remembered\r\nthat if such a country as Iceland were subjected to long-continued\r\ndenudation, the mountain peaks and cones of loose materials would be\r\nworn away, the whole island being thus reduced to a series of plateaux\r\ncomposed of lava-sheets, the connection of which with the crystalline\r\nmaterials filling the great volcanic vents, a superficial observer\r\nmight altogether fail to recognise.\r\n\r\nBut even where we cannot trace the former existence of great volcanic\r\nmountains, like those which once rose in the Hebrides, it would\r\nnevertheless be very rash to conclude that the vast plateaux of\r\nlava-rock must have been formed as gigantic floods unaccompanied by\r\nordinary volcanic action. Mr. Darwin has pointed out that in crossing\r\ndistricts covered by lava, he was frequently only able to determine\r\nthe limits of the different currents of which it was made up, by an\r\nexamination of the age of the trees and the nature of the vegetation\r\nwhich had sprung up on them. And everyone who has travelled much in\r\nvolcanic districts can confirm this observation; what appears at first\r\nsight to be a great continuous sheet of lava proves upon more careful\r\nobservation to be composed of a great number of distinctly different\r\nlava-currents, which have succeeded one another at longer or shorter\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\nWe must remember, too, how various in kind are the volcanic\r\nmanifestations which present themselves under different circumstances.\r\nSometimes the amount of explosive action at a volcanic vent is very\r\ngreat, and only fragmental ejections take place, composed of the frothy\r\nscum of the lava produced by the escape of gases and vapours from its\r\nmidst. But in other cases the amount of explosive action may be small,\r\nand great volumes of igneous materials may issue as lava-streams. In\r\nsuch cases, only small scoriæ-cones would be formed around the vents,\r\nand one half of such cones is commonly swept away by the efflux of the\r\nlava-currents, while the remainder may be easily removed by denuding\r\naction or be buried under the lava-currents issuing from other vents\r\nin the neighbourhood. Thus it may easily come to pass that what a\r\nsuperficial observer takes for an enormous mass of basaltic lava poured\r\nout from a great fissure at a single effort, may prove upon careful\r\nobservation to be made up of innumerable lava-currents, each of which\r\nis of moderate dimensions; and it may further be found that these\r\nlava-currents, instead of being the product of a single paroxysmal\r\neffort from one great fissure, have been accumulated by numerous small\r\noutbursts taking place at wide intervals, from a great number of minor\r\norifices.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SHIFTING OF VOLCANIC ACTION IN DIFFERENT AREAS.]\r\n\r\nHaving then considered the arguments which have been adduced in support\r\nof the view that the volcanic phenomena of former geological periods\r\ndiffer from those which are still occurring upon the globe, we may\r\nproceed to state the general conclusions which have been drawn from the\r\nstudy of the volcanic rocks of the different geological periods.\r\n\r\nFrom a survey of the volcanic rocks of different ages, we are led to\r\nthe interesting and important conclusion that the scene of volcanic\r\naction has been continually shifting to fresh areas at different\r\nperiods of the earth's history. We find repeated proofs that the\r\nvolcanic energy has made its appearance at a certain part of the\r\nearth's crust, has gradually increased in intensity to a maximum, and\r\nthen as slowly declined. But as these manifestations have died away\r\nat one part of the earth's surface, they have gradually made their\r\nappearance at another. In every district which has been examined, we\r\nfind abundant proofs that volcanic energy has been developed at certain\r\nperiods, has disappeared during longer or shorter periods, and then\r\nreappeared in the same area. And on the other hand, we find that there\r\nis no past geological period in which we have not abundant evidence\r\nthat volcanic outbursts took place at some portion of the earth's\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nTo take the case of our own islands for example. We know that during\r\nthe pre-Cambrian periods volcanic outbursts occurred, traces of which\r\nare found both in North and South Wales, in the Wrekin Chain in\r\nShropshire, in Charnwood Forest, and in parts of Scotland and Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn Cambro-Silurian times we have abundant proofs, both in North Wales\r\nand the Lake district, that volcanic action on the very grandest\r\nscale was taking place during the Arenig and the older portion of\r\nthe Llandeilo periods, and again during the deposition of the Bala\r\nor Caradoc beds. The lavas, tuffs, and volcanic agglomerates ejected\r\nduring these two periods have built up masses of rock many thousands of\r\nfeet in thickness. Snowdon and Cader Idris among the Welsh mountains,\r\nand some of the higher summits of the Lake district, have been carved\r\nby denudation from the vast piles of volcanic materials ejected during\r\nthese periods.\r\n\r\nIn Devonian or Old-Red-Sandstone times, volcanic activity was renewed\r\nwith fresh violence upon that part of the earth's surface now occupied\r\nby the British Islands. Along the line which now forms the Grampians\r\nthere rose a series of volcanoes of the very grandest dimensions. Ben\r\nNevis, and many others among the higher Scotch mountains, have been\r\ncarved by denudation from the hard masses of granite, quartz-felsite,\r\nand other plutonic rocks which formed the central cores of these\r\nancient volcanic piles. The remains of the great lava-sheets, and of\r\nthe masses of volcanic agglomerate ejected from these grand Devonian\r\nvolcanoes, make up hill-ranges of no mean altitude, like the Sidlaws,\r\nthe Ochils, and the Pentlands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANCIENT BRITISH VOLCANOES.]\r\n\r\nThe volcanic action of the Devonian period was prolonged into\r\nCarboniferous times, but was then evidently diminishing gradually in\r\nviolence. Instead of great central volcanoes, such as existed in the\r\nearlier period, we find innumerable small vents which threw out tuffs,\r\nagglomerates and lavas, and were scattered over the districts lying\r\naround the bases of the now extinct Devonian volcanoes. In the central\r\nvalley of Scotland and in many parts of England, we find abundant\r\nproofs of the existence of these small and scattered volcanic vents\r\nduring Carboniferous times. The well-known hill of Arthur's Seat, which\r\noverlooks the city of Edinburgh, and many castle-crowned crags of the\r\nForth and Clyde valleys, are the worn and denuded relics of these small\r\nvolcanoes. There are some indications which point to the conclusion\r\nthat the volcanic action of the Newer Palæozoic epoch had not entirely\r\ndied out in Permian times, but the evidence upon this point is not\r\naltogether clear and satisfactory.\r\n\r\nDuring nearly the whole of the Secondary or Mesozoic periods the\r\nvolcanic forces remained dormant in the area of the British Isles.\r\nSome small volcanic outbursts, however, appear to have occurred in\r\nTriassic times in Devonshire. But in other areas, such as the Tyrol,\r\nSouth-eastern Europe and Western America, the Triassic, Jurassic, and\r\nCretaceous periods were marked by grand manifestations of volcanic\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic forces which had during the long Mesozoic periods deserted\r\nour part of the earth's surface, appear to have returned to it in\r\nfull rigour in the Tertiary epoch. In the Newer-Palæozoic periods\r\nthe direction of the great volcanic band which traversed our islands\r\nappears to have been from north-east to south-west; but in Tertiary\r\ntimes a new set of fissures were opened running from north to south.\r\nThere is evidence that during the Eocene or Nummulitic period, the\r\nfirst indications of the subterranean forces having gathered strength\r\nbelow the district were afforded by the issue of calcareous and\r\nsiliceous springs, and soon fissures were opened which emitted scoriæ,\r\ntuffs, and lavas. The intensity of the volcanic action gradually\r\nincreased till it attained its maximum in the Miocene period, when\r\na great chain of volcanic mountains stretched north and south along\r\nthe line of the Inner Hebrides, the north-east of Ireland, and the\r\nsea which separates Great Britain from Ireland. The basal-wrecks of a\r\nnumber of these volcanoes can be traced in the islands of Skye, Mull,\r\nRum, and parts of the adjoining mainland. We have already seen that\r\nalong this great band of volcanic action, which traverses the Atlantic\r\nOcean from north to south, a number of active vents still exist, though\r\ntheir energy is now far less intense than was the case in former times.\r\nThe only vestiges of the action of these now declining volcanic forces,\r\nat present found in our islands, are the hot springs of Bath and a few\r\nother warm and mineral springs; but in connection with this subject it\r\nmust be remembered that our country occasionally participates in great\r\nearthquake-vibrations, like that which destroyed Lisbon in the year\r\n1759.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANCIENT VOLCANOES IN OTHER DISTRICTS.]\r\n\r\nIf we were to study any other part of the earth's surface, we should\r\narrive at precisely the same conclusion as those to which we have\r\nbeen conducted by our examination of the British Islands--namely,\r\nthat during past geological times the subterranean forces had made\r\nthemselves felt in the area, had gradually attained a maximum, and then\r\nas gradually declined, passing through all those varied cycles which we\r\nhave described in a former chapter. And we should also find that these\r\nperiods of volcanic activity alternated with other periods of complete\r\nquiescence which were of longer or shorter duration. But on comparing\r\ntwo different districts, we should discover that what was a period of\r\nvolcanic activity in the one was a period of repose in the other, and\r\n_vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts geologists have been led to the conclusion which we\r\nhave already enunciated--namely, that the subterranean forces are in a\r\nstate of continual flux over the surface of the globe. At one point of\r\nthe earth's crust these forces gradually gather such energy as to rend\r\nasunder the superincumbent rock-masses and make themselves manifest\r\nat the surface in the series of phenomena characteristic of volcanic\r\naction. But after a longer or shorter interval of time--an interval\r\nwhich must probably be measured by millions of years--the volcanic\r\nforces die out in that area to make their appearance in another.\r\n\r\nHence, although we may not be able to prove the fact by any\r\nmathematical demonstration, a strong presumption is raised in favour\r\nof the view that the subterranean energy in the earth's crust is a\r\nconstant quantity, and that the only variations which take place are in\r\nthe locality of its manifestation.\r\n\r\nUpon this question whether the amount of this subterranean energy\r\nwithin the earth's crust is at the present time increasing, stationary,\r\nor declining, we are not altogether destitute of evidence. There are\r\nsome considerations connected with certain astronomical hypotheses, to\r\nwhich we shall hereafter have to refer, that might lead us to entertain\r\nthe view that the subterranean activity was once far greater than it\r\nis at present, and that during the long periods of the earth's past\r\nhistory it has been slowly and gradually declining. And those who\r\nexamine the vast masses of igneous materials which have been poured\r\nout from volcanic vents during the earlier periods of the earth's\r\nhistory may be inclined, at first sight, to point to them as affording\r\nconclusive proof of this gradual decline.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUPPOSED DECLINE OF VOLCANIC ACTION.]\r\n\r\nBut a more careful study of the rocks in question will probably cause\r\na geologist to pause before jumping to such a conclusion. If we look\r\nat the vast masses of volcanic materials erupted in Miocene times in\r\nour own island and in Ireland, for example, we might be led to imagine\r\nthat we have the indications of a veritable 'Reign of Fire,' and that\r\nthe evidence points to a condition of things very different indeed\r\nfrom that which prevails at the present day. But in arriving at such\r\na conclusion we should be neglecting a most important consideration,\r\nthe disregard of which has been the fertile parent of many geological\r\nerrors. Many independent lines of evidence all point to the inference\r\nthat these volcanic ejections are not the result of one violent effort,\r\nbut are the product of numerous small outbreaks which have been\r\nscattered over enormous periods of time.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine with due care the lavas, tuffs, and other volcanic\r\nejections which constitute such mountain-masses as those of the\r\nHebrides, of the Auvergne, and of Hungary, we find clear proofs\r\nthat the ancient Miocene volcanoes of these districts were clothed\r\nwith luxuriant forests, through which wild animals roamed in the\r\ngreatest abundance. The intervals between the ejections of successive\r\nlava-streams were often so great, that soils were formed on the\r\nmountain-slope, and streams cut deep ravines and valleys in them.\r\n\r\nThe island of Java is situated near the very heart of what is at the\r\npresent day the most active volcanic centre on the face of the globe,\r\nyet vegetable and animal life flourish luxuriantly there, and the\r\nisland is one of the richest and most fertile spots upon the face of\r\nthe globe. Not all the terrors of occasional volcanic outbreaks will\r\never drive the Neapolitan vine-dressers from the fertile slopes of\r\nVesuvius, for its periods of repose are long, and its eruptions are of\r\nshort duration.\r\n\r\nThese considerations lead the geologist to conclude that the evidence\r\nafforded by the ancient volcanic rocks is clear and positive in support\r\nof the view that the manifestations of the subterranean forces in the\r\npast agree precisely in their nature and in their products with those\r\ntaking place around us at the present time. On the question of great\r\nsecular changes having occurred in the amount of volcanic energy in\r\npast geological periods, the evidence must be pronounced negative, or\r\nat the best doubtful.\r\n\r\nBut even if the geologist confesses himself unable to establish the\r\nfact of any decline in the subterranean energies during the vast\r\nperiods of which he takes cognisance, it must be remembered that such\r\ndecline may really be going on; for vast as was the duration of the\r\ngeological epochs, they probably constitute but a fraction of those far\r\ngrander periods which are required by the speculations of the physical\r\nastronomer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE PART PLAYED BY VOLCANOES IN THE ECONOMY OF NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first impression which is produced upon the mind, when the\r\nphenomena of volcanic action are studied, is that here we have\r\nexhibitions of destructive violence the effects of which must be\r\nentirely mischievous and disastrous to the living beings occupying the\r\nearth's surface. A little consideration will convince us, however, that\r\nthe grand and terrible character of the displays of volcanic energy\r\nhave given rise to exaggerated notions concerning their destructive\r\neffects. The fact that districts situated over the most powerful\r\nvolcanic foci, like Java and Japan, are luxuriant in their productions,\r\nand thickly inhabited, may well lead us to pause ere we condemn\r\nvolcanic action as productive only of mischief to the living beings\r\non the earth's surface. The actual slopes of Vesuvius and Etna, and\r\nmany other active volcanoes, are abundantly clothed with vineyards and\r\nforests and are thickly studded with populous villages.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the actual amount of damage to life and property\r\nwhich is effected by volcanic eruptions is small. Usually, the\r\ninhabitants of the district have sufficient warning to enable them\r\nto escape with their lives and to carry away their most valuable\r\npossessions. And though fertile tracts are covered by loose dust and\r\nashes, or by lava- and mud-currents, yet the sterility thus produced\r\nis generally of short duration, for by their decomposition volcanic\r\nmaterials give rise to the formation of the richest and most productive\r\nsoils.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes, as we have already seen, are far more destructive in\r\ntheir effects than are volcanoes. Houses and villages, nay even entire\r\ncities, are, by vibrations of portions of the earth's crust, reduced to\r\nheaps of ruins, and famines and pestilences too frequently follow, as\r\nthe consequence of the disorganisation of our social systems by these\r\nterrible catastrophes.\r\n\r\nIt may well be doubted, however, whether the annual average of\r\ndestruction to life and property caused by all kinds of subterranean\r\naction, exceeds that produced either by floods or by hurricanes. Yet\r\nwe know that the circulation of water and air over our globe are\r\nbeneficial and necessary operations, and that the mischief occasionally\r\nwrought by the moving bodies of water and air is quite insignificant\r\ncompared with the good which they effect.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, we shall be able to show that the subterranean\r\nenergies are necessary to the continued existence of our globe as\r\na place fitted for the habitation of living beings, and that the\r\nmischievous and destructive effects of these energies bear but a small\r\nand insignificant proportion to the beneficial results with which they\r\nmust be credited.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LEVELLING ACTION OF DENUDING FORCES.]\r\n\r\nWe have had frequent occasion in the preceding pages to refer to the\r\nwork--slow but sure, silent but effective--wrought by the action of\r\nthe denuding forces ever operating upon the surface of our globe. The\r\nwaters condensing from the atmosphere and falling upon the land in\r\nthe form of rain, snow, or hail, are charged with small quantities of\r\ndissolved gases, and these waters penetrating among the rock-masses\r\nof which the earth's crust is composed, give rise to various\r\nchemical actions of which we have already noticed such remarkable\r\nillustrations in studying the ancient volcanic products of our globe.\r\nBy this action the hardest and most solid rock-masses are reduced\r\nto a state of complete disintegration, certain of their ingredients\r\nundergoing decomposition, and the cementing materials which hold\r\ntheir particles together being removed in a state of solution. In the\r\nhigher regions of the atmosphere this work of rock-disintegration\r\nproceeds with the greatest rapidity; for there the chemical action is\r\nreinforced by the powerful mechanical action of freezing water. On\r\nhigh mountain-peaks the work of breaking up rock-masses goes on at the\r\nmost rapid rate, and every craggy pinnacle is swathed by the heaps\r\nof fragments which have fallen from it. The Alpine traveller justly\r\ndreads the continual fusillade of falling rock-fragments which is\r\nkept up by the ever-active power of the frost in these higher regions\r\nof the atmosphere; and fears lest the vibrations of his footsteps\r\nshould loosen, from their position of precarious rest, the rapidly\r\naccumulating piles of detritus. No mountain-peak attains to any very\r\ngreat elevation above the earth's surface, for the higher we rise in\r\nthe atmosphere the greater is the range of temperature and the more\r\ndestructive are the effects of the atmospheric water. The moon, which\r\nis a much smaller planet than our earth, has mountains of far greater\r\nelevation; but the moon possesses neither an atmosphere nor moisture on\r\nits surface, to produce those levelling effects which we see everywhere\r\ngoing on around us upon the earth.\r\n\r\nThe disintegrated materials, produced by chemical and mechanical\r\nactions of the atmospheric waters upon rock-masses, are by floods,\r\nrivers, and glaciers, gradually transported from higher to lower\r\nlevels; and sooner or later every fragment, when it has once been\r\nseparated from a mountain-top, must reach the ocean, where these\r\nmaterials are accumulated and arranged to form new rocks.\r\n\r\nOver every part of the earth's surface these three grand operations of\r\nthe disintegration of old rock-masses, the transport of the materials\r\nso produced to lower levels, and the accumulation of these materials\r\nto form new rocks, is continually going on. It is by the varied action\r\nof these denuding agents upon rocks of unequal hardness, occupying\r\ndifferent positions in relation to one another, that all the external\r\nfeatures of hills, and plains, and mountains owe their origin.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, which is capable of mathematical demonstration, that by\r\nthe action of these denuding forces the surface of all the lands of the\r\nglobe is being gradually but surely lowered; and this takes place at\r\nsuch a rate that in a few millions of years the whole of the existing\r\ncontinents must be washed away and their materials distributed over the\r\nbeds of the oceans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NECESSITY FOR COMPENSATING AGENCIES.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that there exists some agency by which this levelling\r\naction of the denuding forces of the globe is compensated; and a little\r\nconsideration will show that such compensating agency is found in the\r\nsubterranean forces ever at work within the earth's crust. The effects\r\nof these subterranean forces which most powerfully arrest our attention\r\nare volcanic outbursts and earthquake shocks, but a careful study of\r\nthe subject proves that these are by no means the most important of the\r\nresults of the action of such forces. Exact observation has proved that\r\nalmost every part of the earth's surface is either rising or falling,\r\nand the striking and destructive phenomena of volcanoes and earthquakes\r\nprobably bear only the same relation to those grand and useful\r\nactions of the subterranean forces, which floods do to the system of\r\ncirculating waters, and hurricanes to the system of moving air-currents.\r\n\r\nIf we ride in a well-appointed carriage with good springs, upon\r\na railway which is in excellent order, the movement is almost\r\nimperceptible to us; and the rate of speed may be increased\r\nindefinitely, without making itself apparent to our senses. The\r\nsmallest impediment to the evenness of the movement--such as that\r\nproduced by a small object placed upon the rails--at once makes itself\r\nfelt by a violent jar and vibration. How perfectly insensible we may\r\nbe of the grandest and most rapid movements is taught us by the facts\r\ndemonstrated by the astronomer. By the earth's daily rotation, we are\r\nborne along at a rate which in some places amounts to over 1,000 miles\r\nan hour; and by its annual revolution we are every hour transported\r\nthrough a distance of 70,000 miles; yet concerning the fact and\r\ndirection of these movements we are wholly unconscious.\r\n\r\nIn the case both of the railway train and of our planet, we can only\r\nestablish the reality of the movement, and its direction and rate, by\r\nmeans of observations upon external objects, which appear to us to\r\nhave a movement in the opposite direction. In the same way we can only\r\nestablish the fact of the movement of portions of the earth's crust\r\nby noticing the changing positions of parts of the earth's surface in\r\nrelation to the constant level of the ocean. When this is done we find\r\nabundant proof that while some parts of the earth's crust are rising,\r\nothers are as undoubtedly undergoing depression.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POTENCY OF THE SUBTERRANEAN FORCES.]\r\n\r\nWe shall be able to form some idea of the vastness of the effects\r\nproduced by the subterranean forces, by a very simple consideration.\r\nIt is certain that during the enormous periods of time of which the\r\nrecords have been discovered by the geologist, there have always been\r\ncontinents and oceans upon the earth's surface, just as at present,\r\nand it is almost equally certain that the proportions of the earth's\r\nsurface occupied by land and water respectively, have not varied very\r\nwidely from those which now prevail. But, at the same time, it is an\r\nequally well-established bet that the denuding forces ever at work\r\nupon the earth's surface would have been competent to the removal\r\nof existing continents many times over, in the vast periods covered\r\nby geological records. Hence we are driven to conclude that the\r\nsubterranean movements have in past times entirely compensated for the\r\nwaste produced by the denuding forces ever at work upon our globe. But\r\nthis is not all. The subterranean forces not only produce upheaval;\r\nin a great many cases the evidences of subsidence are as clear and\r\nconclusive as are those of upheaval in others. Hence we are driven to\r\nconclude that the forces producing upheaval of portions of the earth's\r\ncrust are sufficient, not only to balance those producing subsidence,\r\nbut also to compensate for the destructive action of denuding agents\r\nupon the land-masses of the globe.\r\n\r\nIt is only by a careful and attentive study and calculation of the\r\neffects produced by the denuding agents at work all around us, aided\r\nby an examination of the enormous thicknesses of strata formed by the\r\naction of such causes during past geological times, that we are able\r\nto form any idea of the reality and vastness of the agents of change\r\nwhich are ever operating to modify the earth's external features. When\r\nwe have clearly realised the grand effects produced on the surface\r\nof the globe by these external forces, through the action of its\r\ninvesting atmosphere and circulating waters, then, and only then,\r\nshall we be in a position to estimate the far greater effects resulting\r\nfrom the internal forces, of which the most striking, but not the most\r\nimportant, results are seen in the production of volcanic eruptions and\r\nearthquake-shocks.\r\n\r\nAnother series of facts which serve to convince the geologist of the\r\nreality and potency of the forces ever at work within the earth's\r\ncrust, and the way in which these have operated during past geological\r\nperiods, is found in the disturbed condition of many of the stratified\r\nrock-masses of which it is composed. Such stratified rock-masses, it is\r\nclear, must have been originally deposited in a position of approximate\r\nhorizontality; but they are now often found in inclined and even\r\nvertical positions; they are seen to be bent, crumpled, puckered, and\r\nfolded in the most remarkable manner, and have not unfrequently been\r\nbroken across by dislocations--'faults'--which have sometimes displaced\r\nmasses, originally in contact, to the extent of thousands of feet.\r\nThe slate-rocks of the globe, moreover, bear witness to the fact that\r\nstrata have been subjected to the action of lateral compression of\r\nenormous violence and vast duration; while in the metamorphic rocks\r\nwe see the effects of still more extreme mechanical strains, which\r\nhave been in part transformed into chemical action. No one who has\r\nnot studied the crushed, crumpled, fractured, and altered condition\r\nof many of the sedimentary rocks of the globe, can form the faintest\r\nidea of the enormous effects of the internal forces which have been in\r\noperation within the earth's crust during earlier geological periods.\r\nAnd it is only by such studies as these that we at last learn to regard\r\nthe earthquake and volcanic phenomena of our globe, not as the grandest\r\nand most important effects of these forces, but as their secondary\r\nand accidental accompaniments. 'Volcanoes,' it has been said, 'are\r\nthe safety-valves of the globe;' and when we come to realise the real\r\nextent and nature of the internal forces ceaselessly working in the\r\nearth's crust we shall scarcely be disposed to regard the simile as an\r\noverstrained one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RELATION TO CONTINENTAL MOVEMENTS.]\r\n\r\nThe first geologist who attempted to show the exact relations existing\r\nbetween those subterranean forces which cause the movements of\r\ncontinental masses of land, and those more startling displays of energy\r\nwhich are witnessed in volcanic outbursts, was the late Mr. Poulett\r\nScrope. At a somewhat later date Mr. Darwin, in his remarkable paper\r\n'On the Connexion of certain Volcanic Phenomena in South America, and\r\non the Formation of Mountain-chains and Volcanoes as the effect of\r\nContinental Elevations,' threw much new and important light upon the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nWhile, on the one hand, we are led by recent geological investigations\r\nto reject the notions which were formerly accepted, by which\r\nmountain-ranges were supposed to be suddenly and violently upheaved by\r\nvolcanic forces, we are, on the other hand, driven to conclude that\r\nwithout the action of these subterranean forces, the irregularities\r\nwhich are exhibited on the earth's surface could not have had any\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the actual forms of the mountain-ranges are due\r\ndirectly to the action of denuding forces, which have sculptured\r\nout from the rude rocky masses all the varied outlines of peaks and\r\ncrags, of ravines and valleys. But it is none the less true that\r\nthe determining causes which have directed and controlled all this\r\nearth-sculpture, are found in the relative positions of hard and soft\r\nmasses of rock; but these rock-masses have acquired their hardness and\r\nconsistency, and have assumed their present positions, in obedience\r\nto the action of subterranean forces. Hence we see that though the\r\nformation of mountain-ranges is proximately due to the denuding\r\nforces, which have sculptured the earth's surface, the primary cause\r\nfor the existence of such mountain-chains must be sought for in the\r\nfact that subterranean forces have been at work, folding, crumpling,\r\nand hardening the soft sediments, and placing them in such positions\r\nthat, by the action of denudation, the more indurated portions are left\r\nstanding as mountain-masses above the general surface.\r\n\r\nThe old notion that mountain-chains are due to a vertical upthrust\r\nfrom below, finds but little support when we come to study with due\r\ncare the positions of the rock-masses composing the earth's crust. On\r\nthe contrary, we find that mountain-ranges are usually carved out of\r\nthe crushed and crumpled edges of strata which have along certain lines\r\nbeen influenced by great mechanical strains, and subjected to more or\r\nless induration and chemical alteration. When we compare these folded\r\nand contorted portions of the strata with those parts of the same beds\r\nwhich are not so affected, we find the effects produced in the former\r\nare not such as would result from an upthrust from below, but from\r\nmovements by which a tangential strain would be brought about. If we\r\nimagine certain lines of weakness to exist in the solid crust of the\r\nearth, then any movements in the portions of the crust between these\r\nlines of weakness would cause crushing and crumpling of the strata\r\nalong the latter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF MOUNTAIN-CHAINS.]\r\n\r\nRecent investigations of Dana and other authors have thrown much new\r\nlight upon the question of the mode of formation of mountain-chains,\r\nand the relation between the movements by which they are produced and\r\nthe sudden and violent manifestations of force witnessed in volcanic\r\noutbursts. We cannot, perhaps, better illustrate this subject than by\r\ngiving a sketch of the series of operations to which the great Alpine\r\nchains owe their origin.\r\n\r\nThere are good grounds for believing that the great mountain-axis of\r\nSouthern Europe, with its continuation in Asia, had no existence\r\nduring the earlier geological periods. Indeed, it has been proved that\r\nall the higher among the existing mountain-chains of the globe have\r\nbeen almost entirely formed in Tertiary times. The reason of this\r\nremarkable fact is not far to seek. So rapid is the work of denudation\r\nin the higher regions of the atmosphere, that the elevated crags and\r\npinnacles are being broken up by the action of moisture and frost at\r\nan exceedingly rapid rate. This fact is attested by the existence\r\nof those enormous masses of angular rock-fragments which are found\r\nlodged on every vantage-ground among the mountain-summits, as well as\r\nby the continually descending materials which are borne by glaciers\r\nand mountain-torrents to the valleys below. Where such a rate of\r\ndisintegration as this is maintained, no elevated mountain-crests\r\ncould exist through long geological periods. It is true we find in all\r\nparts of the globe relics of many mountain-chains which were formed\r\nbefore the Tertiary period; but these have by long-continued denudation\r\nbeen worn down to 'mere stumps.' Of such worn-down and degraded\r\nmountain-ranges we have examples in the Scandinavian chains, and some\r\nof the low mountain-regions of Central Europe and North America.\r\n\r\nLet us now proceed to illustrate this subject by briefly sketching the\r\nhistory of that series of operations by which the great mountain-chains\r\nof the Alpine system have been formed.\r\n\r\nThe first stage of that grand series of operations appears from recent\r\ngeological researches to have consisted in the opening of a number\r\nof fissures running along a line near to that at which, in a long\r\nsubsequent period, the elevation of the mountain-masses took place.\r\nThis betrayal of the existence of a line of weakness in this part of\r\nthe earth's crust occurred in the Permian period, and from that time\r\nonward a series of wonderful movements and changes have been going\r\nforward, which have resulted in the production of the Alpine chains as\r\nwe now see them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VOLCANIC FISSURES OF PERMIAN PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nFrom the great fissures opened in Permian times along this line of\r\nweakness, great quantities of lava, scoriæ, and tuff were poured out,\r\nand these accumulated to form great volcanic mountains, which we can\r\nnow only study at a few isolated spots, as in the Tyrol, Carinthia,\r\nand about Lake Lugano. Everywhere else, these Permian volcanic rocks\r\nappear to be deeply buried under the later-formed sediments, from which\r\nthe Alpine chains have been carved. Few and imperfect, however, as are\r\nthe exposures of these ancient rhyolite and quartz-andesite lavas and\r\nagglomerates formed at the close of the Palæozoic epoch, their greatly\r\ndenuded relics form masses which are in places more than 9,000 feet in\r\nthickness. From this fact we are able to form some slight idea of the\r\nscale upon which the volcanic outbursts in question must have taken\r\nplace during Permian times.\r\n\r\nThe second stage in the series of operations by which the Alpine chains\r\nhave been formed, consisted in a general sinking of the surface along\r\nthat line of weakness in the earth's crust, the existence of which had\r\nbeen betrayed by the formation of fissures and the eruption of volcanic\r\nrocks. We have already had occasion to remark how frequently such\r\nsubsidences follow upon the extrusion of volcanic masses at any part\r\nof the earth's surface; and we have referred these downward movements\r\nin part to the removal of support from below the portion of the crust\r\naffected, and in part to the weight of the materials piled upon its\r\nsurface by the volcanic forces.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic energy which had been manifested with such violence\r\nduring the Permian period, does not appear to have died out altogether\r\nduring the succeeding Triassic period. A number of smaller volcanic\r\nvents were opened from time to time, and from these, lavas, tuffs, and\r\nagglomerates, chiefly of basic composition, were poured out. The relics\r\nof these old Triassic volcanoes are found at many points along the\r\nAlpine chain, but it is evident that the igneous forces were gradually\r\nbecoming exhausted during this period, and before the close of it they\r\nhad fallen into a state of complete extinction.\r\n\r\nBut the great subsidence which had commenced in the Triassic period,\r\nalong what was to become the future line of the Alpine chain, was\r\ncontinued almost without interruption during the Rhætic, the Jurassic,\r\nthe Tithonian, the Neocomian, the Cretaceous and the Nummulitic\r\nperiods. With respect to the strata formed during all these periods,\r\nit is found that their thiknesses, which away from the Alpine axis\r\nmay be measured by hundreds of feet, is along that axis increased\r\nto thousands of feet. The united thickness of sediments accumulated\r\nalong this great line of subsidence between the Permian and Nummulitic\r\nperiods probably exceeds 60,000 feet, or ten miles. The subsidence\r\nappears to have been very slow and gradual, but almost uninterrupted,\r\nand the deposition of sediments seems to have kept pace with the\r\nsinking of the sea-bottom, a fact which is proved by the circumstance\r\nthat nearly the whole of these sediments were such as must have been\r\naccumulated in comparatively shallow water.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF ALPINE GEOSYNCLINAL.]\r\n\r\nBy the means we have described there was thus formed a 'geosynclinal,'\r\nas geologists have called it, that is, a trough-like hollow filled\r\nwith masses of abnormally thickened sediments, which had been piled\r\none upon another during the long periods of time in which almost\r\nuninterrupted subsidence was going on along the Alpine line of\r\nweakness in the earth's crust. In this way was brought together that\r\nenormous accumulation of materials from which the hard masses of the\r\nAlpine chains were subsequently elaborated, and out of which the\r\nmountain-peaks were eventually carved by denudation.\r\n\r\nThe third stage in this grand work of mountain-making commenced in the\r\nOligocene period. It consisted of a series of movements affecting the\r\nparts of the earth's crust on either side of the line of weakness\r\nwhich had first exhibited itself in Permian times. By these movements\r\na series of tangential strains were produced, which resulted in the\r\nviolent crushing, folding, and crumpling of the sedimentary materials\r\ncomposing the geosynclinal.\r\n\r\nOne effect of this action was the violent flexure and frequent fracture\r\nof these stratified masses, which are now found in the Alpine regions\r\nassuming the most abnormal and unexpected positions and relations to\r\none another. Sometimes the strata are found tortured and twisted into\r\nthe most complicated folds and puckerings; at others they are seen to\r\nbe completely inverted, so that the older beds are found lying upon the\r\nnewer; and in others, again, great masses of strata have been traversed\r\nby numerous fractures or faults, the rocks on either side of which are\r\ndisplaced to the extent of thousands of feet.\r\n\r\nAnother effect of the great lateral thrusts by which the thick\r\nsedimentary masses of the geosynclinal were being so violently\r\ndisturbed, was the production of a great amount of induration and\r\nchemical change in these rocks. Masses of soft clay, of the age of\r\nthat upon which London is built, were by violent pressure reduced to\r\nthe condition of roofing-slate, similar to that of North Wales. One\r\nof the most important discoveries of modern times is that which has\r\nresulted in the recognition of the fact of the mutual convertibility\r\nof different kinds of energy. We now know that mechanical force\r\nmay be transformed into heat-force or chemical force; and of such\r\ntransformations we find abundant illustrations in the crushed and\r\ncrumpled rock-masses of the Alpine chains.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of these several kinds of force, not only was\r\nextreme consolidation and induration produced among the rock-masses,\r\nbut chemical affinity and crystalline action had the fullest play\r\namong the materials of which they were composed. In many cases we find\r\nthe originally soft muds, sands, and shell-banks converted into the\r\nmost highly crystalline rocks, which retain their primary chemical\r\ncomposition, but have entirely lost all their other original features.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FORMATION OF ALPINE GEANTICLINAL.]\r\n\r\nTo the mass of folded, crumpled, and altered strata, formed from a\r\ngeosynclinal by lateral pressure, geologists have given the name\r\nof a 'geanticlinal.' The formation of the Alpine geanticlinal was\r\ndue to movements which commenced in the Oligocene period, attained\r\ntheir maximum in the Miocene, and appear to have declined and almost\r\naltogether died out in the Pliocene period.\r\n\r\nThe movements which resulted in the crushing and crumpling of the\r\nthickened mass of sediments along the Alpine line of weakness, also\r\ngave rise to the formation of a series of fissures from which volcanic\r\naction took place. These fissures were not, however, formed along the\r\noriginal line of weakness, for this had been strengthened and repaired\r\nby the deposition of ten-miles' thickness of sediments upon it, but\r\nalong new fissures opened in directions parallel to the original lines\r\nof weakness, and in areas where a much less considerable amount of\r\ndeposition had taken place since Permian times.\r\n\r\nWe have abundant evidence that, just at the period when those great\r\nmovements were commencing which resulted in the formation of the great\r\nAlpine and Himalayan geanticlinal, earth-fissures were being opened\r\nupon either side of the latter from which volcanic outbursts took\r\nplace. At the period when the most violent mountain-forming movements\r\noccurred, these fissures were in their most active condition, and at\r\nthis time two great volcanic belts stretched east and west, on either\r\nside of, and parallel to, the great Alpine chain. The Northern volcanic\r\nband was formed by the numerous vents, now all extinct, in Auvergne,\r\nCentral Germany, Bohemia, and Hungary, and was probably continued in\r\nthe volcanoes of the Thian Shan and Mantchouria. The Southern volcanic\r\nband was formed by the numerous vents of the Iberian and Italian\r\npeninsulas, and the islands of the Mediterranean, and were continued\r\nto the eastward by those of Asia Minor, Arabia, and the North Indian\r\nOcean. As the earth-movements which produced the geanticlinal died\r\naway, the volcanic energy along these parallel volcanic bands died\r\naway at the same time. In studying the geology of Central and Southern\r\nEurope, no fact comes out more strikingly than that of the synchronism\r\nbetween the earth-movements by which the geanticlinal of the Alps was\r\nformed, and the volcanic manifestations which were exhibited along\r\nlines of fissure parallel to that geanticlinal. The earth-movements\r\nand the volcanic outbursts both commenced in the Oligocene period,\r\ngradually attained their maximum in the Miocene, and as slowly declined\r\nin the Pliocene.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCULPTURING OF ALPS BY DENUDATION.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth stage in the great work of mountain-building in the case\r\nof the Alps consisted in the operation of the denuding forces, the\r\ndisintegrating action of rain and frost, the transporting action\r\nof rivers and glaciers, by which the Alpine peaks were gradually\r\nsculptured out of the indurated and altered masses constituting the\r\ngeanticlinal. The action of this fourth stage went on to a great\r\nextent side by side with that of the third stage. So soon as the\r\nearth-movements had brought the submerged sedimentary masses of the\r\ngeosynclinal under the action of the surface tides and currents of the\r\nocean, marine denudation would commence; and, as the work of elevation\r\nwent on, the rock-masses would gradually be brought within the reach\r\nof those more silently-working but far more effective agents which\r\nare ever operating in the higher regions of the atmosphere. It is\r\nimpossible to say what would have been the height of the Alpine chain\r\nif the work of denudation had not to a great extent kept pace with\r\nthat of elevation. Only the harder and more crystalline masses have\r\nfor the most part escaped destruction, and stand up in high craggy\r\nsummits; while flanking hills, like the well-known Rigi, are Been to\r\nbe composed of conglomerates thousands of feet in thickness, composed\r\nof their disintegrated materials. It is a remarkable fact, as showing\r\nhow enormous was the work of elevation daring the formation of the\r\ngeanticlinal, that some of the youngest and least consolidated rocks of\r\nthe Nummulitic period are still found at a height of 11,000 feet in the\r\nAlps, and of 16,000 feet in the Himalaya.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it will be seen that mountain-chains may be\r\nregarded as cicatrised wounds in the earth's solid crust. A line of\r\nweakness first betrays itself at a certain part of the earth's surface\r\nby fissures, from which volcanic outbursts take place; and thus the\r\nposition of the future mountain-chain is determined. Next, subsidence\r\nduring many millions of years permits of the accumulation of the raw\r\nmaterials out of which the mountain-range is to be formed; subsequent\r\nearth-movements cause these raw materials to be elaborated into the\r\nhardest and most crystalline rock-masses, and place them in elevated\r\nand favourable positions; and lastly, denudation sculptures from these\r\nhardened rock-masses all the varied mountain forms. Thus the work of\r\nmountain-making is not, as was formerly supposed by geologists, the\r\nresult of a simple upheaving force, but is the outcome of a long and\r\ncomplicated series of operations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORIGIN OF OTHER MOUNTAIN-CHAINS.]\r\n\r\nThe careful study of other mountain-chains, especially those of the\r\nAmerican continent, has shown that the series of actions which we\r\nhave described as occurring in the Alps, took place in the same order\r\nin the formation of all mountain-masses. It is doubtful whether the\r\nline of weakness is always betrayed in the first instance by the\r\nformation along its course of volcanic fissures. But in all cases we\r\nhave evidence of the production of a geosynclinal, which is afterwards,\r\nby lateral pressure, converted into a geanticlinal, and from this the\r\nmountain-chains have been carved by denudation. Professor Dana has\r\nshown that the geosynclinal of the Appalachian chain was made up of\r\nsediments attaining a thickness of 40,000 feet, or eight miles; while\r\nMr. Clarence King has shown that a part of the geosynclinal of the\r\nRocky Mountains was built up of no less than 60,000 feet, or twelve\r\nmiles of strata.\r\n\r\nIt has thus been established that a very remarkable relation exists\r\nbetween the forces by which continental masses of land are raised\r\nand depressed, and mountain-ranges have been developed along lines\r\nof weakness separating such moving continental masses, and those\r\nmore sudden and striking manifestations of energy which give rise to\r\nvolcanic phenomena. It is in this relation between the widespread\r\nsubterranean energies and the local development of the same forces\r\nat volcanic vents, that we must in all probability seek for the\r\nexplanation of those interesting peculiarities of the distribution\r\nof volcanoes upon the face of the globe which we have described\r\nin a former chapter. The parallelism of volcanic bands to great\r\nmountain-chains is thus easily accounted for; and in the same way\r\nwe may probably explain the position of most volcanoes with regard\r\nto coast-lines. We have already pointed out the objections to the\r\ncommonly-received view that volcanoes depend for their supplies of\r\nwater on the proximity of the ocean. This proximity of the ocean to\r\nvolcanic vents we are thus inclined to regard, not as the cause, but as\r\nthe effect of the subterranean action. The positions of both volcanoes\r\nand coast-lines are determined by the limits of those great areas of\r\nthe earth's crust which are subjected to slow vertical movements, often\r\nin opposite directions.\r\n\r\nTerrible and striking, then, as are the phenomena connected with\r\nvolcanic action, such sudden and violent manifestations of the\r\nsubterranean energy must not be regarded as the only, or indeed the\r\nchief, effects which they produce. The internal forces continually\r\nat work within the earth's crust perform a series of most important\r\nfunctions in connection with the economy of the globe, and were the\r\naction of these forces to die out, our planet would soon cease to be\r\nfit for the habitation of living beings.\r\n\r\nThere is no fact which the geological student is more constantly\r\ncalled upon to bear in mind than that of the potency of seemingly\r\ninsignificant causes which continue in constant operation through long\r\nperiods of time. Indeed these small and almost unnoticed agencies at\r\nwork upon the earth's crust are often found, in the long ran, to\r\nproduce far grander effects than those of which the action is much\r\nmore striking and obvious. It is to the silent and imperceptible\r\naction of atmospheric moisture and frost that the disintegration of\r\nthe solid rock-masses must be mainly ascribed; and the noisy cataract\r\nand ocean-billow produce effects which are quite insignificant\r\ncompared with those which must be ascribed to the slight and almost\r\nunnoticed forces. Great masses of limestone are built up of the remains\r\nof microscopic organisms, while the larger and higher life-forms\r\ncontribute but little to the great work of rock-building.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EFFECTS OF SLOW CONTINENTAL MOVEMENTS.]\r\n\r\nIn the same way it is to the almost unnoticed action of the\r\nsubterranean forces in raising some vast areas of the earth's crust,\r\nin depressing others, and in bringing about the development of\r\nmountain-chains between them, that we must ascribe a far more important\r\npart in the economy of our globe than to the more conspicuous but less\r\nconstant action of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nA few simple considerations will serve to convince us, not only of the\r\nbeneficial effects of the action of the subterranean energies within\r\nthe earth's crust, but of the absolute necessity of the continued\r\noperation of those energies to the perpetuation of that set of\r\nconditions by which our planet is fitted to be the habitation of living\r\nbeings.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the prodigious effects which are constantly\r\nbeing produced around us by the action of the external forces at work\r\nupon the globe. The source of these external forces is found in the\r\nmovements and changes which are ever going on within the aqueous and\r\natmospheric media in which the globe is enveloped. The circulation of\r\nthe air, influencing the circulation of the waters in the shape of\r\nclouds, rain, snow, rivers, glaciers, and oceans, causes the breaking\r\nup of even the hardest rock-masses, and the continual removal of their\r\ndisintegrated fragments from higher to lower levels. This work goes on\r\nwith more or less regularity over every part of the land raised above\r\nthe level of the ocean, but the rate of destruction in the higher\r\nregions of the atmosphere is far more rapid than at lower levels. Hence\r\nthe circulating air and water of the globe are found to be continually\r\nacting as levellers of the land-masses of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means a difficult task to calculate the approximate rate\r\nat which the various continents and islands are being levelled down,\r\nand such calculations prove that in a very few millions of years the\r\nexisting forces operating upon the earth's surface would reduce the\r\nwhole of the land-masses to the level of the ocean.\r\n\r\nBut a little consideration will convince us that the circulation of\r\nthe air and waters of the globe are themselves dependent upon the\r\nexistence of those irregularities of the land-surfaces which they are\r\nconstantly tending to destroy. Without elevated mountain ridges the\r\nregular condensation of moisture, and its collection and distribution\r\nin streams and rivers over every part of the land surfaces, could\r\nnot take place. Under these circumstances the unchecked evaporation\r\nof the oceanic waters would probably go on, till the proportion\r\nof water-vapour increased to such an extent in the atmosphere as\r\neffectually to destroy those nicely-balanced conditions upon which the\r\ncontinued existence of both vegetable and animal life depend.\r\n\r\nBut the repeated upward and downward movements which have been shown\r\nto be going on in the great land-masses of the globe, giving rise\r\nin turns to those lateral thrusts and tangential strains to which\r\nmountain-chains owe their formation, afford a perfect compensation\r\nto the action of the external forces ever operating upon the earth's\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the uncompensated effect of the external forces acting on\r\nthe earth's crust is calculated to bring about the destruction of those\r\nconditions upon which the existence of life depends, the uncompensated\r\neffect of the internal forces acting on the earth's crust are fraught\r\nwith at least equal dangers to those necessary conditions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONTRAST BETWEEN THE EARTH AND MOON.]\r\n\r\nIn our nearest neighbour among the planets--the moon--the telescope has\r\nrevealed to us the existence of a globe, in which the internal forces\r\nhave not been checked and controlled by the operation of any external\r\nagencies--for the moon appears to be destitute of both atmosphere and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances we find its surface, as we might expect, to\r\nbe composed of rocks which appear to be entirely of igneous origin;\r\nthe mountain-masses, unworn by rain or frost, river or glacier, being\r\nof most prodigious dimensions as compared with those of our own globe,\r\nwhile no features at all resembling valleys, or plains, or alluvial\r\nflats are anywhere to be discerned upon the lunar surface.\r\n\r\nBut by the admirable balancing of the external and internal forces\r\non our own globe, the conditions necessary to animal and vegetable\r\nexistence are almost constantly maintained, and those interruptions\r\nof such conditions, produced by hurricanes and floods, by volcanic\r\noutbursts and earthquakes, may safely be regarded as the insignificant\r\naccidents of what is, on the whole, a very perfectly working piece of\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nThe ancients loved to liken the earth to a living being--the macrocosm\r\nof which man was the puny representative or microcosm; and when we\r\nstudy the well-adapted interplay of the forces at work upon the\r\nearth's crust, both from within and without, the analogy seems a\r\nscarcely strained one. In the macrocosm and the microcosm alike, slight\r\ninterferences with the regular functions occasionally take place, and\r\nboth of them exhibit the traces of a past evolution and the germs of an\r\neventual decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nWHAT VOLCANOES TEACH US CONCERNING THE NATURE OF THE EARTH'S INTERIOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn entering upon any speculations or enquiries concerning the nature of\r\nthe interior of our globe, it is necessary before all things that we\r\nshould clearly realise in our minds how small and almost infinitesimal\r\nis that part of the earth's mass which can be subjected to direct\r\nexamination. The distance from the surface to the centre of our globe\r\nis nearly 4,000 miles, but the deepest mines do not penetrate to much\r\nmore than half a mile from the surface, and the deepest borings fall\r\nfar short of a mile in depth. Sometimes, it is true, the geologist\r\nfinds means for drawing inferences as to the nature of the rocks at\r\ndepths of ten or fifteen miles below the surface; but the last-named\r\ndepth must be regarded as the utmost limit of that portion of our\r\nglobe which can be made the object of direct observation and study.\r\nThis thin exterior film of the earth's mass, which the geologist is\r\nable to investigate, we call the 'crust of the globe'; but it must be\r\nremembered that in using this term, it is not intended to imply that\r\nthe outer part of our globe differs in any essential respect from the\r\ninterior. The term 'crust of the globe' is employed by geologists as\r\na convenient way of referring to that portion of the earth which is\r\naccessible to their observation.\r\n\r\nBut if we are unable to make direct investigations concerning the\r\nnature of the internal portions of the globe, there are nevertheless a\r\nnumber of facts from which we may draw important inferences upon the\r\nsubject. These facts and the inferences based upon them we shall now\r\nproceed to consider.\r\n\r\nFirst in importance among these we may mention the results which have\r\nbeen obtained by weighing our globe. Various methods have been devised\r\nfor accomplishing this important object, and the conclusions arrived\r\nat by different methods agree so closely with one another, that there\r\nis no room for doubt as to the substantial accuracy of those results.\r\nIt may be taken as proved beyond the possibility of controversy that\r\nour globe is equal in weight to five and a half globes of the same size\r\ncomposed of water, or, in other words, that the average density of the\r\nmaterials composing the globe is five and a half times as great as that\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nNow the density of the materials which compose the crust of the globe\r\nis very much less than this, varying from about two-and-one-third to\r\nthree times that of water. Hence we are compelled to conclude that the\r\ninterior portions of the globe are of far greater density than the\r\nexterior portions; that, as a matter of fact, the mass of the globe is\r\ncomposed of materials having twice the density of the rocks exposed at\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DENSITY OF EARTH'S INTERIOR.]\r\n\r\nIt has been sometimes argued that as all materials under intense\r\npressure appear to yield to an appreciable extent, and to allow their\r\nparticles to be packed into a smaller compass, we may find in this fact\r\nan explanation of the great density of the internal parts of the globe.\r\nIt has in fact been suggested that under the enormous pressure which\r\nmust be exerted by masses of rock several thousand feet in thickness,\r\nthe materials of which our earth is composed may be compelled to pack\r\nthemselves into less than one-half the compass which they occupy at the\r\nsurface. But the ascription of such almost unlimited compressibility to\r\nsolid substances can be supported neither by experiment nor analogy.\r\nVarious considerations point to the probability that solid bodies yield\r\nto pressure up to a certain limit and no farther, and that when this\r\nlimit is reached an increase in pressure is no longer attended with a\r\nreduction in bulk.\r\n\r\nIf then we are compelled to reject the idea of the unlimited\r\ncompressibility of solid substances, we must conclude that the interior\r\nportions of our globe are composed of _materials of a different kind_\r\nfrom those which occur in its crust. And this conclusion, as we shall\r\npresently see, is borne out by a number of independent facts.\r\n\r\nThe study of the materials ejected from volcanic vents proves that even\r\nat very moderate depths there exist substances differing greatly in\r\ndensity, as well as in chemical composition. The lightest lavas have a\r\nspecific gravity of 2·3, the heaviest of over 3. And that materials of\r\neven greater density are sometimes brought by volcanic action from the\r\nearth's interior, we have now the clearest proofs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RELATION BETWEEN EARTH AND OTHER PLANETS.]\r\n\r\nBut in considering a question of this kind, it will be well to remember\r\nthat analogy may furnish us with hints upon the subject which may prove\r\nto be by no means unimportant. There is no question upon which modern\r\nscience has wrought out a more complete revolution in our ideas, than\r\nthat of the relation of our earth to the other bodies of the universe.\r\nWe know, as the result of recent research, that our globe is one of\r\na great family of bodies, moving through space in similar paths and\r\nin obedience to the same laws. A hundred years ago the primary and\r\nsecondary planets of the solar system could be almost numbered upon\r\nthe fingers; now we recognise the fact that they exist in countless\r\nmillions, presenting every variety of bulk from masses 1,400 times\r\nas large as our earth down to the merest planetary dust. Between the\r\norbits of Mars and Jupiter, more than 200 small planets have been\r\nrecognised as occurring, and every year additions are made to the\r\nnumber of these asteroids. Comets have now been identified with streams\r\nof such planetary bodies, of minute size, moving in regular orbits\r\nthrough our system. The magnificent showers of 'shooting-stars' have\r\nbeen proved to be caused by the passage of the earth through such\r\nbands of travelling bodies, and 'the zodiacal light' finds its most\r\nprobable explanation in the supposition that the sun is surrounded by\r\na great mass of such minute planets. Every increase in the power of\r\nthe telescope reveals to us the existence of new secondary planets\r\nor moons, revolving about the primaries; and the wonderful system\r\nof the Saturnian rings is now explained by the proved existence of\r\ngreat streams of such secondary planets circling around it. The solar\r\nsystem was formerly conceived of as a vast solitude through which a\r\nfew gigantic bodies moved at awful distances from one another. Now we\r\nknow that the supposed empty void is traversed by countless myriads of\r\nbodies of the most varied dimensions, all moving in certain definite\r\npaths, in obedience to the same laws, ever acting and reacting upon\r\neach other, and occasionally coming into collision.\r\n\r\nThere are not wanting further facts to prove that the other planets are\r\nlike our own in many of their phenomena and surroundings. In some of\r\nthem atmospheric phenomena have been detected, such as the formation of\r\nclouds and the deposition of snow, so that the external forces at work\r\non our globe act upon them also. And that internal forces, like those\r\nwe have been considering in the case of our earth, are at work in our\r\nneighbours, is proved by the great solar storms and the condition of\r\nthe moon's surface.\r\n\r\nBut the results of spectrum-analysis in recent years have furnished new\r\nfacts in proof of the close relationship of our earth to the numerous\r\nsimilar bodies by which it is surrounded. So far as observation has yet\r\ngone we have reason for believing that not only the members of the\r\nsolar system, but the more distant bodies of the universe, are all\r\ncomposed of the same elementary substances as those which enter into\r\nthe composition of our globe.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory information concerning the composition and nature\r\nof other planetary bodies is derived from the study of those small\r\nplanets which occasionally come into collision with our globe, and\r\nwhich have their own proper motion in space thereby arrested. These\r\nmeteorites, as such falling planetary bodies are called, have justly\r\nattracted great attention, and their fragments are treasured as the\r\nmost valuable objects in our museums.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COMPOSITION OF METEORITES.]\r\n\r\nThe first fact concerning these meteorites, which it is necessary\r\nto notice, is that they are composed of the same chemical elements\r\nas occur in the earth's crust. No element has yet been found in any\r\nmeteorite which was not previously known as existing in the earth, and\r\nof the sixty-five or seventy known terrestrial elements no less than\r\ntwenty-two have already been detected in meteorites.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a dozen elements which occur in overwhelming\r\nproportions in the earth's crust. We shall probably not be going too\r\nfar in saying that these twelve elements--namely, oxygen, silicon,\r\naluminium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron, carbon,\r\nhydrogen, sulphur, and chlorine--make up amongst them not less than 999\r\nout of 1,000 parts of the earth's crust, and that all the other fifty\r\nor sixty elements are 80 comparatively rare that they do not constitute\r\nwhen taken altogether more than one part in 1,000 of the rocks of the\r\nglobe. Now all of these twelve common terrestrial elements occur in\r\nmeteorites, and the fact that the rarer terrestrial elements have not\r\nas yet been found in them will not surprise anyone, who remembers how\r\nsmall is the bulk of all the specimens of these meteorites existing in\r\nour museums.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto insisted on the points of resemblance in the chemical\r\ncomposition of meteorites and that of the rocks of the globe, but we\r\nshall now have to indicate some very important points in which they\r\ndiffer.\r\n\r\nWhile in the rocks composing the earth's crust oxygen forms one-half of\r\ntheir mass, and silicon another quarter, we find that in the meteorites\r\nthese elements, though present, play a much less important part. The\r\nmost abundant element in the meteorites is iron; and nickel, chromium,\r\ncobalt, manganese, sulphur, and phosphorus, are much more abundant in\r\nthese extra-terrestrial bodies than they are in the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nWe have already referred to the remarkable fact that in our earth's\r\ncrust nearly all the other elementary substances are found combined\r\nin the first instance with oxygen, and that most rocks consist of the\r\noxide of silicon combined with the oxides of various metals. But this\r\nis by no means the case with the meteorites. In them we find metals\r\nlike iron, nickel, cobalt, &c., in their uncombined condition, and\r\nforming alloys with one another. The same and other metals also occur\r\nin combination with carbon, phosphorus, chlorine, and sulphur, and\r\nsome of the substances thus formed are quite unknown among terrestrial\r\nrocks. Compounds of the oxide of silicon with the oxides of the metals\r\nsuch as form the mass of the crust of the globe do occur in meteorites,\r\nbut they play a much less important part than in the case of the\r\nterrestrial rocks.\r\n\r\nAmong the substances found in meteorites are several which do not exist\r\namong the terrestrial rocks--some, indeed, which it seems impossible\r\nto conceive of as being formed and preserved under terrestrial\r\nconditions. Among these we may mention the phosphide of iron and nickel\r\n(Schreibersite), the sulphide of chromium and iron (Daubréelite), the\r\nprotosulphide of iron (Troilite), the sulphide of calcium (Oldhamite),\r\nthe protochloride of iron (Lawrencite), and a peculiar form of\r\ncrystallised silica, called by Professor Maskelyne 'Asmanite.'\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIFFERENT KINDS OF METEORITES.]\r\n\r\nThere are other phenomena exhibited by meteorites which indicate that\r\nthey must have been formed under conditions very different to those\r\nwhich prevail upon the earth's surface. Thus we find that fused iron\r\nand molten slag-like materials have remained entangled with each other,\r\nand have not separated as they would do if a great body like the earth\r\nwere near to exercise the varying force of gravity upon the two\r\nclasses of substances. Again, meteorites are found to have absorbed\r\nmany times their bulk of hydrogen gas, and to exhibit peculiarities in\r\ntheir microscopic structure which can probably be only accounted for\r\nwhen we remember that they were formed in the interplanetary spaces,\r\nfar away from any great attracting body.\r\n\r\nBut in recent years a number of very important facts have been\r\ndiscovered which may well lead us to devote a closer attention to the\r\ncomposition and structure of meteorites. It has been shown, on the\r\none hand, that some meteorites contain substances precisely similar\r\nto those which are sometimes brought from the earth's interior during\r\nvolcanic outbursts; and, on the other hand, there have been detected,\r\namong some of the ejections of volcanoes, bodies which so closely\r\nresemble meteorites that they were long mistaken for them. Both kinds\r\nof observation seem to point to the conclusion that the earth's\r\ninterior is composed of similar materials to those which we find in the\r\nsmall planets called meteorites.\r\n\r\nM. Daubrée has proposed a very convenient classification for\r\nmeteorites, dividing them into the following four groups:--\r\n\r\nI. _Holosiderites_; consisting almost entirely of metallic iron, or of\r\niron alloyed with nickel, stony matter being absent; but sulphides,\r\nphosphides, and carbides of several metals are often diffused through\r\nthe mass. The polished surfaces of these meteoric irons, when etched\r\nwith acid, often exhibit a remarkable crystalline structure.\r\n\r\nII. _Syssiderites_; in which a network of metallic iron encloses a\r\nnumber of granular masses of stony materials.\r\n\r\nIII. _Sporadosiderites_; which consist of a mass of stony materials,\r\nthrough which particles of metallic iron are disseminated.\r\n\r\nIV. _Asiderites_; containing no metallic iron, but consisting entirely\r\nof stony materials.\r\n\r\nThere are, besides the meteorites belonging to these principal groups,\r\na few of peculiar and exceptional composition, which we need not notice\r\nfurther for our present purpose.\r\n\r\nFrom the above classification it will be seen that most meteorites\r\nconsist of a mixture in varying proportions of metallic and stony\r\nmaterials. Sometimes the metallic constituents are present in greater\r\nproportions than the stony, at other times the stony materials\r\npredominate, while occasionally one or other of these elements may be\r\nwholly wanting.\r\n\r\nThe stony portions of meteorites, upon careful examination, prove to be\r\nbuilt up of certain minerals, agreeing in their chemical composition\r\nand their crystalline forms with those which occur in the rocks of the\r\nearth's crust. Among the ordinary terrestrial minerals occurring in\r\nthe stony portions of meteorites, we may especially mention olivine,\r\nenstatite, augite, anorthite, chromite, magnetite, and pyrrhotite.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: METEORITES AND ULTRA-BASIC ROCKS.]\r\n\r\nThe minerals which occur in meteorites are in every case such as are\r\nfound in the more basic volcanic rocks--quartz, and the acid felspars,\r\nwith the other minerals which occur in acid rocks, being entirely\r\nabsent in the 'extra-terrestrial' rocks.\r\n\r\nNow, besides the three great classes of lavas which we have described\r\nas being ejected from volcanic vents, there are some rarer materials\r\noccasionally brought from the earth's interior by the same agency,\r\nthat present a most wonderful resemblance to the stony portions of\r\nmeteorites. These materials we may call 'ultra-basic rocks.' Their\r\nspecific gravity is very high, usually exceeding 3, and they contain\r\na very low percentage of silica; on the other hand, the proportion of\r\niron and magnesia is often much greater than in ordinary terrestrial\r\nrocks. But the most remarkable fact about these ultra-basic rocks is,\r\nthat they are almost entirely composed of the minerals which occur in\r\nmeteorites; namely, olivine, enstatite, augite, anorthite, magnetite,\r\nand chromite.\r\n\r\nThe ultra-basic rocks often occur under very peculiar conditions.\r\nSometimes they are found forming ordinary volcanic protrusions\r\nthrough the sedimentary rocks. The rocks named pikrites, lherzolites,\r\ndunites, &c., are examples of such igneous protrusions composed of\r\nthese ultra-basic materials, and probably all the true serpentines are\r\nrocks of the same class which have absorbed water and undergone great\r\nalteration. The ultra-basic rocks sometimes contain platinum and other\r\nmetals in the free or uncombined state. But not unfrequently we find\r\namong the ordinary ejections of volcanoes, nodules and fragments of\r\nsuch ultra-basic materials, which have clearly been carried up with the\r\nother lavas from great depths in the earth's crust. Thus in Auvergne,\r\nthe Eifel, Bohemia, Styria, and many other volcanic districts, the\r\nbasaltic lavas and tuffs are found to contain nodules composed of\r\nthe minerals which are so highly characteristic of meteorites. Such\r\nnodules, too, often form the centres of the volcanic bombs which are\r\nthrown out of craters during eruptions.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that materials identical in composition and character with\r\nthe stony portions of meteorites, exist within the earth's interior,\r\nand are thrown out on its surface by volcanic action. A still more\r\ninteresting discovery has been made in recent years; namely, that\r\nmaterials similar to the metallic portion of meteorites, and consisting\r\nof nickeliferous iron, also occur in deep-seated portions of the\r\nearth's crust, and are brought to the surface during periods of igneous\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1870, Professor Nordenskiöld made a most important\r\ndiscovery at Ovifak, on the south side of the Island of Disko, off\r\nthe Greenland coast. On the shore of the island a number of blocks of\r\niron were seen, and the chemical examination of these proved that,\r\nlike ordinary metallic meteorites, they consisted of iron alloyed with\r\nnickel and cobalt.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IRON-MASSES OF OVIFAK.]\r\n\r\nNow, when the facts concerning the masses of native iron of Ovifak were\r\nmade known, the first and most natural explanation which presented\r\nitself to every mind was, that these were a number of meteorites which\r\nat some past period had fallen upon the earth's surface.\r\n\r\n  Metallic iron.\r\n\r\n  Opaque crystals of magnetite (black oxide of iron).\r\n\r\n  Transparent crystals of felspar, augite, and olivine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87.--Section of basalt from Ovifak, Greenland, with\r\nparticles of metallic iron diffused through its mass.]\r\n\r\nBut a further examination of the locality revealed a number of facts\r\nwhich, as Professor Steenstrup pointed out, it is very difficult\r\nto reconcile with the theory that the Ovifak masses of iron are of\r\nmeteoric origin. The district of Western Greenland, where these masses\r\nwere discovered, has been the scene of volcanic outbursts on the\r\ngrandest scale during the Miocene period. In close proximity to the\r\ngreat iron masses, there are seen a number of basaltic dykes; and, when\r\nthese dykes are carefully examined, the basaltic rock of which they are\r\ncomposed is seen to be full of particles of metallic iron. In fig. 87,\r\nwe have a drawing made from a section of the Ovifak basalts magnified\r\nfour or five diameters. The rock-mass is seen to be composed of black,\r\nopaque magnetite, and transparent crystals of augite, labradorite,\r\nolivine, &c.; while, through the whole, particles of metallic iron are\r\nfound entangled among the different crystals in the most remarkable\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that this singular rock might have been formed by\r\na meteorite falling, in Miocene times, into a lava-stream in a state\r\nof incandescence. But the relation of the metallic particles to the\r\nstony materials is such as to lend no support whatever to this rather\r\nstrained hypothesis.\r\n\r\nA careful study of all the facts of the case by Lawrence Smith,\r\nDaubrée, and others well acquainted with the phenomena exhibited by\r\nmeteorites, has led to the conclusion that the large iron-masses of\r\nOvifak, as well as the particles of metallic iron diffused through\r\nthe surrounding basalts, are all of terrestrial origin, and have been\r\nbrought by volcanic action from the earth's interior. It is probable\r\nthat, just as we find in many basaltic lavas nodules of ultra-basic\r\nmaterials similar to the stony parts of meteorites, so in these basalts\r\nof Ovifak we have masses of iron alloyed with nickel, similar to the\r\nmetallic portions of meteorites. Both the stony and metallic enclosures\r\nin the basalt are in all probability derived from deeper portions of\r\nthe earth's crust. By the weathering away of the basalt of Ovifak, the\r\nlarger masses of metallic iron have been left exposed upon the shore\r\nwhere they were found.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other facts which seem to support this startling\r\nconclusion. Thus it has been shown by Professor Andrews that certain\r\nbasalts in our own islands contain particles of metallic iron of\r\nmicroscopic dimensions, and it is not improbable that some of the\r\nmasses of nickeliferous iron found in various parts of the earth's\r\nsurface, which have hitherto been regarded as meteorites, are, like\r\nthose of Ovifak, of terrestrial origin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MATERIALS FILLING METALLIC-VEINS.]\r\n\r\nAnother piece of evidence pointing in the same direction, is derived\r\nfrom those great fissures communicating with the interior of our globe\r\nwhich become filled with metallic minerals, and are known to us as\r\nmineral-veins. In these mineral-veins the native metals, their alloys,\r\nand combinations of these with sulphur, chlorine, phosphorus, &c., are\r\nfrequently present. But oxides of the metals, except as products of\r\nsubsequent alteration, occur far less frequently than in the earth's\r\ncrust generally. Hence we are led to conclude that the substances which\r\nin the outer part of the earth's crust always exist in combination\r\nwith oxygen, are at greater depths in a free and uncombined condition.\r\n\r\nNor is it a circumstance altogether unworthy of attention that the\r\nresearches of Mr. Norman Lockyer and other astronomers, based on the\r\nknown facts of the relative densities of the several members of the\r\nsolar system, and the ascertained relations of the different solar\r\nenvelopes, have led to conclusions closely in accord with those arrived\r\nat by geologists. These researches appear to warrant the hypothesis\r\nthat the interior of our globe consists of metallic substances\r\nuncombined with oxygen, and that among these metallic substances iron\r\nplays an important part. Our globe, as we know, is a great magnet,\r\nand the remarkable phenomena of terrestrial magnetism may also not\r\nimprobably find their explanation in the fact that metallic iron forms\r\n80 large a portion of the earth's interior.\r\n\r\nThe interesting facts which we have been considering may be made\r\nclearer by the accompanying diagram (fig. 88). The materials ejected\r\nfrom volcanic vents (lavas) are in almost all cases compounds of\r\nsilicon and the various metals with oxygen. In the lighter or acid\r\nlavas oxygen constitutes one-half of their weight, and the proportion\r\nof metals of the iron-group is very small. As we pass to the heavier\r\nintermediate and basic lavas, we find the proportion of oxygen\r\ndiminishing, and the metals of the alkaline earths (magnesium and\r\ncalcium) with the metals of the iron-group increasing, in quantity. In\r\nthe small and interesting group of the ultra-basic lavas the proportion\r\nof oxygen is comparatively small, and the proportion of magnesium and\r\niron very high. So much for the terrestrial rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88.--Diagram illustrating the relation between the\r\nTerrestrial and the Extra-Terrestrial Rock.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TERRESTRIAL AND EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL ROCKS.]\r\n\r\nNow let us turn our attention to the extra-terrestrial rocks or those\r\nfound in meteorites. The Asiderites are quite identical in composition\r\nwith the ultra-basic lavas of our globe, but in the Sporadosiderites\r\nand the Syssiderites we find the proportion of oxygen rapidly\r\ndiminishing, and that of metallic iron increasing. Finally, in the\r\nHolosiderites the oxygen entirely disappears, and the whole mass\r\nbecomes metallic.\r\n\r\nFrom the Holosiderites at one end of the chain to the add lavas\r\nat the other, we find there is a complete and continuous series;\r\nthe rocks of terrestrial origin overlapping, in their least\r\noxydized representatives, the most highly oxydized representatives\r\nof the extra-terrestrial rocks. But the discovery at Ovifak of\r\nthe iron-masses, and the basalts with iron disseminated, has\r\nafforded another very important link, placing the terrestrial and\r\nextra-terrestrial rocks in closer relations with one another.\r\n\r\nAll these facts appear to point to the conclusion that the earth's\r\ninterior consists of metallic substances either quite uncombined\r\nor simply alloyed with one another, and among these iron is very\r\nconspicuous by its abundance. The outer crust, which is probably of no\r\ngreat thickness, contains an enormous proportion of oxygen and silicon\r\ncombined with the materials which constitute the interior portions of\r\nour globe. It may be, as has been suggested by astronomers, that our\r\nearth consisted at one time of a solid metallic mass surrounded by a\r\nvaporous envelope of metalloids, and that the whole of the latter, with\r\nthe exception of the constituents of the atmosphere and ocean, have\r\ngradually entered into combination with the metals of the nucleus to\r\nform the existing crust of the globe. But of this period the geologist\r\ncan take no cognisance. The records which he studies evidently\r\ncommenced at a long subsequent period, when the conditions prevailing\r\nat the earth's surface differed but little, if at all, from those which\r\nexist at the present day. Equally little has the geologist to do with\r\nspeculations concerning a far distant future when, as some philosophers\r\nhave suggested, the work of combination of the waters and atmosphere of\r\nthe earth's surface with the metallic substances of its interior shall\r\nbe completed, and our globe, entirely deprived of its fluid envelopes,\r\nreduced to the condition in which we find our satellite, the moon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHYSICAL CONDITION OF EARTH'S INTERIOR.]\r\n\r\nThere is another class of enquiries concerning the earth's interior to\r\nwhich the attention of both geologists and astronomers has long been\r\ndirected--that, namely, which deals with the problem of the _physical\r\ncondition_ of the interior of our globe.\r\n\r\nThe fact that masses of molten materials are seen at many points of the\r\nearth's surface to issue from figures in the crust of our globe, seems\r\nat first sight to find a simple explanation if we suppose our planet\r\nto consist of a fluid central mass surrounded by a solid crust. Hence\r\nwe find that among those who first thought upon this subject, this\r\nhypothesis of a liquid centre and a solid crust was almost universally\r\naccepted. This hypothesis was supposed to find further support in the\r\nfact that, as we penetrate into the earth's crust by mines or boring\r\noperations, the temperature is found to continually increase. It was\r\nimagined, too, that this condition of our planet would best agree with\r\nthe requirements of the nebular hypothesis of Laplace, which explains\r\nthe formations and movements of the bodies of the solar system by the\r\ncooling down of a nebulous mass.\r\n\r\nBut a more careful and critical examination of the question has led\r\nmany geologists and astronomers to reject the hypothesis that the earth\r\nconsists of a great fluid mass surrounded by a comparatively thin shell\r\nof solid materials.\r\n\r\nVolcanic outbursts and earthquake tremors, though so terrible and\r\ndestructive to man and his works, are but slight and inconsiderable\r\ndisturbances in a globe of such vast dimensions as that on which we\r\nlive. The condition of the crust of the globe is, in spite of volcanic\r\nand earthquake manifestations, one of general stability; and this\r\ngeneral stability has certainly been maintained during the vast periods\r\ncovered by the geological record. Such a state of things seems quite\r\nirreconcilable with the supposition that, at no great depth from the\r\nsurface, the whole mass of the globe is in a liquid condition. If, on\r\nthe other hand, it be supposed that the solid crust of the globe is\r\nseveral hundreds of miles in thickness, it is difficult to understand\r\nhow the local centres of volcanic activity could be supplied from such\r\ndeep-seated sources.\r\n\r\nThere are other facts which seem equally irreconcilable with the\r\nhypothesis of a fluid centre and a thin solid crust in our globe. If\r\nall igneous products were derived from one central reservoir, we might\r\nfairly expect to find a much greater uniformity of character among\r\nthose products than really exists. But in some cases, materials of\r\ntotally different composition are ejected at the same time from closely\r\nadjoining volcanic districts. Thus in Hungary and Bohemia, as we have\r\nseen, lavas of totally different character were being extruded during\r\nthe Miocene period. In the island of Hawaii, as Professor Dana has\r\npointed out, igneous ejections have taken place at a crater 14,000 feet\r\nabove the sea-level, while a closely adjoining open vent at a level\r\n10,000 feet lower exhibited no kind of sympathy with the disturbance.\r\nWhatever may be the cause of volcanic action, it seems clear that it\r\ndoes not originate in a universal mass of liquefied material situated\r\nat no great depth from the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions arrived at by astronomers and physicists is one quite\r\nin accord with those which geologists have reached by totally different\r\nmethods. It is now very generally admitted that if the earth were not\r\na rigid mass, its behaviour under the attract live influences of the\r\nsurrounding members of the solar system would be very different to what\r\nis found to be the case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARGUMENTS AGAINST LIQUID INTERIOR.]\r\n\r\nThat the earth is in a solid condition to a great depth from the\r\nsurface, and possibly quite to the centre, is a conclusion concerning\r\nwhich there can be little doubt; and in the next chapter we shall\r\nendeavour to show that such a condition of thirds is by no means\r\nincompatible with those manifestations of internal energy, the\r\nphenomena of which we are considering in this work. The question,\r\ntherefore, of the complete solidity of our globe, or of its consisting\r\nof a solid and a liquid portion, is one of speculative interest only,\r\nand is in no way involved in our investigations concerning the nature\r\nand origin of volcanic activity. We may conclude this chapter by\r\nenumerating the several hypotheses which have at different times been\r\nmaintained concerning the nature of the interior of our globe.\r\n\r\n_First._ It has been suggested that the earth consists of a fluid or\r\nsemi-fluid nucleus surrounded and enclosed in a solid shell. Some\r\nhave maintained this shell to be of such insignificant thickness, as\r\ncompared with the bulk of the interior liquid mass, that portions of\r\nthe latter are able to reach the earth's surface through movements\r\nand fractures of the outer shell, and that in this manner volcanic\r\nmanifestations originate. Others, impressed with the general stability\r\nand rigidity of the globe as a whole, have maintained that the outer\r\nsolid shell must have a very considerable thickness, amounting\r\nprobably to not less than several hundreds of miles. But through a\r\nshell of such thickness it is difficult to conceive of the liquid\r\nmasses of the interior finding their way to the surface, and those who\r\nhave held this view are driven to suggest some other means by which\r\nlocal developments of volcanic action might be brought about.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ Some physicists have asserted that a globe of liquid\r\nmatter radiating its heat into space, would tend to solidify both at\r\nthe surface and the centre, at the same time. The consequence of this\r\naction would be the production of a sphere with a solid external shell\r\nand a solid central nucleus, but with an interposed layer in a fluid\r\nor semi-fluid condition. It has been pointed out that if we suppose\r\nthe solidification to have gone so far, as to have caused the partial\r\nunion of the interior nucleus and the external shell, we may conceive a\r\ncondition of things in which the stability and rigidity is sufficient\r\nto satisfy both geologists and astronomers, but that in still\r\nunsolidified pockets or reservoirs, filled with liquefied rock, between\r\nthe nucleus and the shell, we should have a competent cause for the\r\nproduction of the volcanic phenomena of the globe. In this hypothesis,\r\nhowever, it is assumed that the cooling at the centre and the surface\r\nof the globe would go on at such rates that the reservoirs of liquid\r\nmaterial would be left at a moderate depth from the surface, so that\r\neasy communication could be opened between them and volcanic vents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REVIEW OF THE SEVERAL HYPOTHESES.]\r\n\r\n_Thirdly._ It has been maintained that the earth may have become\r\nperfectly solid from the centre to the surface. Those who hold this\r\nview endeavour to account for the phenomena of volcanoes in one of two\r\nways. It may be, they say, that the deep-seated rock-masses, though\r\nactually solid, are in a state of _potential_ liquidity; that though\r\nreduced to a solid state by the intense pressure of the superincumbent\r\nmasses, yet such is the condition of unstable equilibrium in the whole\r\nmass, that the comparatively slight movements and changes taking place\r\nat the earth's surface suffice to bring about the liquefaction of\r\nportions of its crust and consequent manifestations of volcanic energy.\r\nBut It may be, as other supporters of the doctrine of the earth's\r\ncomplete solidity have maintained, that the phenomena of volcanoes\r\nhave no direct connection with a supposed incandescent condition of\r\nour planet at all, and that there are chemical and mechanical forces\r\nat work within our globe which are quite competent to produce at the\r\nsurface all those remarkable phenomena which we identify with volcanic\r\naction.\r\n\r\nFrom this summary of the speculative views which have been entertained\r\nupon the subject of the physical condition of the earth's interior,\r\nit will be clear that at present we have not sufficient evidence for\r\narriving at anything like a definite solution of the problem. The\r\nconditions of temperature and pressure which exist in the interior of\r\na globe of such vast dimensions as our earth, are so far removed from\r\nthose which we can imitate in our experimental enquiries, and it is so\r\nunsafe to push the application of laws arrived at by the latter to the\r\nextreme limits required by the former, that we shall do well to pause\r\nbefore attempting to dogmatise on such a difficult question.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we shall endeavour to grapple with a somewhat more\r\nhopeful task, to point out how far observation and experiment have\r\nenabled us to offer a reasonable explanation of the wonderful series of\r\nphenomena which are displayed during outbursts of volcanic activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE ATTEMPTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE TO EXPLAIN THE CAUSES OF VOLCANIC\r\nACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery completed scientific investigation must consist of four series\r\nof operations. In the first of these an attempt is made to collect the\r\nwhole of the facts bearing on the question, by means of observation\r\nand experiment; the latter being only observation under conditions\r\ndetermined by ourselves. In the second stage of the enquiry, the\r\nattention is directed to classifying and grouping the isolated facts,\r\nso as to determine their bearings upon one another, and the general\r\nconclusions to which they appear to point. In the third stage, it is\r\nsought to frame an hypothesis which shall embrace all the observed\r\nfacts, and shall be in harmony with the general conclusions derived\r\nfrom them. In the fourth stage, this hypothesis is put to the most\r\nrigid test; comparing the results which must follow, if it be true,\r\nwith the phenomena actually observed, and rejecting or amending our\r\nhypothesis accordingly. Every great scientific theory has thus been\r\nestablished by these four processes--observation, generalisation,\r\nhypothesis, and verification.\r\n\r\nThe enquiry concerning the nature and causes of volcanic action is far\r\nfrom being a completed one. It is true that many hypotheses upon the\r\nsubject have been framed, but in too many instances these have not been\r\nbased on accurate observations and careful generalisations, and can be\r\nregarded as little better than mere guesses. Indeed, the state of the\r\nenquiry at the present time would seem to be as follows. Although much\r\nremains to be done in the direction both of observation and experiment,\r\nthe main facts of the case have been established upon irrefragable\r\nevidence. The classification and comparison of these facts have led to\r\nthe recognition of certain laws, which seem to embrace all the known\r\nfacts. To account for these facts and their demonstrated relations to\r\none another, certain tentative hypotheses have been suggested; but in\r\nno case can it be truly said that these latter have so far stood the\r\ntest of exact enquiry as to deserve to rank as demonstrated truths. A\r\ncomplete and consistent theory of volcanic action still remains to be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VALUE AND LIMITS OF HYPOTHESES.]\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the plan which we have sketched out for ourselves\r\nat the commencement of this work, we shall aim at following what has\r\nbeen the order of investigation and discovery in our study of volcanic\r\naction; and in this concluding chapter we shall indicate the different\r\nhypotheses by which it has been proposed to account for the varied\r\nphenomena, which we have discussed in the preceding pages, and their\r\nremarkable relations to one another. We shall endeavour, in passing,\r\nto indicate how far these several hypotheses appear to be probable,\r\nas satisfying a larger or smaller number of those conditions of the\r\nproblem which have been established by observation, experiment, and\r\ncareful reasoning; but we shall at the same time carefully avoid such\r\nadvocacy of any particular views as would tend to a prejudgment of\r\nthe question. Hypothesis is, as we have seen, one of the legitimate\r\nand necessary operations in scientific investigation. It only becomes\r\na dangerous and treacherous weapon when it is made to precede rather\r\nthan to follow observation and experiment, or when being regarded\r\nwith paternal indulgence, an attempt is made to shield it from the\r\nrelentless logic of facts. Good and bad hypotheses must be allowed to\r\n'grow together till the harvest;' such as are unable to accommodate\r\nthemselves to the surrounding conditions imposed by newly-discovered\r\nfacts and freshly-established laws will assuredly perish; and in this\r\n'struggle for existence' the true hypothesis will in the end survive,\r\nwhile the false ones perish.\r\n\r\nIt may well happen, however, that among the hypotheses which have up to\r\nthe present time been framed, none will be found to entirely satisfy\r\nall the conditions of the problem. New discoveries in physics and\r\nchemistry have suggested fresh explanations of volcanic phenomena in\r\nthe past, and may continue to do so in the future; and the true theory\r\nof volcanic action, when it is at last discovered, may combine many of\r\nthe principles which now seem to be peculiar to different hypotheses.\r\n\r\nLet us, in the first place, enquire what are the facts which must be\r\naccounted for in any theory of volcanic action. We have already been\r\nled to the conclusion that the phenomena exhibited by volcanoes were\r\nentirely produced by the escape of imprisoned water and other gases\r\nfrom masses of incandescent and fluid rock. Our subsequent examination\r\nof the problem confirmed the conclusion that in all cases of volcanic\r\noutburst we have molten rock-materials from which water and other\r\ngases issue with greater or less violence. The two great facts to\r\nbe accounted for, then, in any attempted explanation of volcanic\r\nphenomena, are the existence of this high temperature at certain points\r\nwithin the earth's crust, and the presence of great quantities of water\r\nand gas, imprisoned in the rocks. We shall perhaps simplify the enquiry\r\nif we examine these two questions separately, and, in the first place,\r\nreview those hypotheses which have been suggested to account for high\r\ntemperatures in the subterranean regions, and, in the second place,\r\nexamine those which seek to explain the presence of large quantities of\r\nimprisoned water and gases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE WITH DEPTH.]\r\n\r\nThat a high temperature exists in the earth's crust at some depth from\r\nthe surface is a £act which does not admit of any doubt. Every shaft\r\nsunk for mining operations, and every deep boring made for the purpose\r\nof obtaining water, proves that a more or less regular increase of\r\ntemperature takes place as we penetrate downwards. The average rate\r\nof this increase of temperature has been estimated to be about 1°\r\nFahrenheit for every 50 or 60 feet of depth.\r\n\r\nNow if it be assumed that this regular increase of temperature\r\ncontinues to great depths, a simple calculation proves that at a depth\r\nof 9,000 feet a temperature of 212° Fahrenheit will be found--one\r\nsufficient to boil water at the earth's surface--while at a depth of 28\r\nmiles the temperature will be high enough to melt cast-iron, and at 34\r\nmiles to fuse platinum.\r\n\r\nSo marked is this steady increase of temperature as we go downwards,\r\nthat it has been seriously proposed to make very deep borings in order\r\nto obtain supplies of warm water for heating our towns. Arago and\r\nWalferdin suggested this method for warming the Jardin des Plantes at\r\nParis; and now that such important improvements have been devised in\r\ncarrying borings to enormous depths, the time may not be far distant\r\nwhen we shall draw extensively upon these supplies of subterranean\r\nheat. At the present time the city of Buda-Pesth is extensively\r\nsupplied with hot-water from an underground source. Should our\r\ncoal-supply ever fail it may be well to remember that we have these\r\ninexhaustible supplies of heat everywhere beneath our feet.\r\n\r\nBut although we may conclude that at the moderate depths we have\r\nindicated such high temperatures exist, it would not be safe to\r\ninfer, as some have done, that at a distance of only 40 or 50 miles\r\nfrom the surface the materials composing our globe are in a state\r\nof actual fusion. Both theory and experiment indicate that under\r\nincreased pressure the fusing point of solid bodies is raised; and\r\njust as in a Papin's digester we may have water retained by high\r\npressure in a liquid condition at a temperature far above 212° F.,\r\nso in the interior of the earth, masses of rock may exist in a solid\r\nstate, at a temperature far above that at which they would fuse at\r\nthe earth's surface. We may speak of such rock-masses, retained in a\r\nsolid condition by intense pressure, at a temperature far above their\r\nfusing point at the earth's surface, as being in a 'potentially liquid\r\ncondition.' Upon any relief of pressure such masses would at once\r\nassume the liquid state, just as the superheated water in a Papin's\r\ndigester immediately flashes into steam upon the fracture of the strong\r\nvessel by which it is confined. We have already seen how the action\r\nat volcanic vents often appears to indicate just such a manifestation\r\nof elastic forces, as would be exhibited by the relief of superheated\r\nmasses from a state of confinement by pressure.\r\n\r\nIn reasoning upon questions of this kind, however, we must always be\r\nupon our guard against giving undue extension to principles and laws\r\nwhich seem to be clearly established by experiment at the earth's\r\nsurface. It is well to remember how exceedingly limited is our command\r\nof extreme pressures and high temperatures, when compared with those\r\nwhich may exist within a body of the dimensions of our globe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EFFECT OF PRESSURE ON FUSION-POINT.]\r\n\r\nIf we were to imagine a set of intelligent creatures, who were able to\r\ncommand only a range of temperatures from 50° to 200° F., engaged upon\r\nan investigation of the properties of water, we shall easily understand\r\nhow unsafe it may be to extend generalisations far beyond the limits\r\ncovered by actual experiment. Such beings, from their observation of\r\nthe regular changes of volume of water at all the temperatures they\r\ncould command, might infer that at still higher and lower temperatures\r\nthe same rates of expansion and contraction would be maintained. Yet,\r\nas we well know, such an inference would be quite wide of the truth;\r\nfor a little above 200° F. water suddenly expands to 1,700 times its\r\nvolume, and not far below 50° F. the contraction is suddenly changed\r\nfor expansion.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued by the late Mr. David Forbes and others that,\r\ninasmuch as experiment has shown that--though the fusing points of\r\nsolids are raised by pressure, yet that this rise of the fusing\r\npoints goes on in a diminishing ratio as compared with the pressures\r\napplied--a limit will probably be reached at which the most intense\r\npressure will not be sufficient to retain substances at a high\r\ntemperature in their solid state. The fact that gases cannot be\r\nretained in a liquid condition by the most intense pressure at a\r\ntemperature above their critical point, may seem by analogy to favour\r\nthe same conclusion. Hence, David Forbes, Dana, and other authors, have\r\nargued in favour of the existence of a great liquid nucleus in our\r\nglobe covered by a comparatively thin, solid crust. And if we accept\r\nthe supposed proofs of a constant increase of temperature from the\r\nsurface to the centre of the globe, such a conclusion appears to be at\r\nleast as well founded as that which regards the central masses of the\r\nearth as maintained in a solid condition by intense pressure.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will, however, convince us that the facts which\r\nhave been relied upon as proving the intensely heated condition of the\r\ncentral masses of our globe, are by no means so conclusive as has been\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nThe earth's form, which mathematicians have shown to be exactly that\r\nwhich would be acquired by a globe composed of yielding materials\r\nrotating on its axis at the rate which our planet does, has often\r\nbeen adduced as proving that the latter was not always in a rigid and\r\nunyielding condition. In the same way, all the remarkable facts and\r\nrelations of the bodies of the solar system, which have been shown by\r\nastronomers to lend such support to the nebular hypothesis, have been\r\nthought, at the same time, to favour the view that our earth is still\r\nin a condition of uncompleted solidification.\r\n\r\nBut it is quite admissible to accept the nebular hypothesis and the\r\nview that our globe attained its present form while still in a state\r\nof fluidity, and at the same time to maintain that our earth has long\r\nsince reached its condition of complete solidification. And there are\r\nnot a few facts which appear to lend support to such a conclusion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUPPOSED PROOFS OF LIQUID NUCLEUS.]\r\n\r\nIf the rapid rate of increase in temperature which has been\r\ndemonstrated to occur at so many parts of the earth's surface be\r\nmaintained to the centre, then, as argued by David Forbes and Dana, it\r\nis difficult to conceive of our earth as being in any other condition\r\nthan that of a liquid mass covered by a comparatively thin crust. The\r\nobjection to this view, both upon geological and astronomical grounds,\r\nwe have pointed out in the previous chapter.\r\n\r\nBefore accepting as a demonstrated conclusion this notion of a constant\r\nincrease of temperature from the surface to the centre of our globe, it\r\nmay be well to re-examine the facts which are relied upon as proving it.\r\n\r\nThat there is a general increase of temperature so far as we are able\r\nto go downwards in the earth's crust, there can, as we have seen,\r\nbe no doubt whatever. Yet it may be well to bear in mind how very\r\nlimited is the range of our observation on the subject. The deepest\r\nmines extend to little more than half-a-mile from the surface, and the\r\ndeepest borings to little more than three-quarters of a mile, while the\r\ndistance from the earth's surface to its centre is nearly 4,000 miles.\r\nWe may well pause before we extend conclusions, derived from such very\r\nlimited observations, to such enormous depths.\r\n\r\nBut when we examine critically these observations themselves, we\r\nshall find equal grounds for caution in generalising from them. There\r\nis the greatest and most startling divergence in the results of the\r\nobservations which have been made at different points at the earth's\r\nsurface. Even when every allowance is made for errors of observation,\r\nthese discrepancies still remain. In some places the increase of\r\ntemperature as we go downwards is so rapid that it amounts to 1°\r\nFahrenheit for every 20 feet in depth, while in other cases, in order\r\nto obtain the same increase in temperature of 1° Fahrenheit, we have to\r\ndescend as much as 100 feet.\r\n\r\nNow if, as is so often assumed, this increase of temperature as we\r\ngo downwards be due to our approach to incandescent masses forming\r\nthe interior portions of the globe, it is difficult to understand\r\nwhy greater uniformity is not exhibited in the rate of increase in\r\ndifferent areas. No difference in the conducting powers of the various\r\nrock-materials is sufficient to account for the fact that in some\r\nplaces the rate of increase in temperature in going downwards is no\r\nless than five times as great as it is in others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VARIATIONS IN UNDERGROUND TEMPERATURES.]\r\n\r\nAgain, there are some remarkable facts concerning the variation in\r\nthe rate of increase in temperature with depth which seem equally\r\nirreconcilable with the theory that the heat in question is directly\r\nderived from a great, central, incandescent mass. M. Walferdin, by a\r\nseries of careful observations in two shafts at Creuzot, proved that\r\ndown to the depth of 1,800 feet the increase of temperature amounted to\r\n1° Fahrenheit for every 55 feet of descent, but below the depth named,\r\nthe rate of increase was as much as 1° Fahrenheit for every 44 feet. On\r\nthe other hand, in the great boring of Grenelle at Paris, the increase\r\nin temperature down to the depth of 740 feet amounted to 1° Fahrenheit\r\nfor every 50 feet of descent, but from 740 feet down to 1,600 feet,\r\nthe rate of increase diminished to 1° for 75 feet of descent. The\r\nsame remarkable fact was strikingly shown in the case of the deepest\r\nboring in the world--that of Sperenberg, near Berlin, which attained\r\nthe great depth of 4,052 feet. In this case, the rate of increase in\r\ntemperature for the first 1,900 feet, was 1° Fahrenheit for every 55\r\nfeet of descent, and for the next 2,000, it diminished to 1° Fahrenheit\r\nfor every 62 feet of descent. In the deep well of Buda-Pesth there was\r\nactually found a decline in temperature below the depth of 3,000 feet.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting fact in connection with this question\r\nwhich has been discovered of late years, is that in districts which\r\nhave recently been the seat of volcanic agencies, the rate of increase\r\nin temperature, as we go downwards in the earth's crust, is abnormally\r\nhigh. Thus at Monte Massi in Tuscany, the temperature was found to\r\nincrease at the rate of 1° Fahrenheit for every 24 feet of descent.\r\nIn Hungary several deep wells and borings have been made, which prove\r\nthat a very rapid increase of temperature occurs. The deep boring at\r\nBuda-Pesth penetrates to a depth of 3,160 feet, and a temperature of\r\n178° Fahrenheit has been observed near the bottom. The rate of increase\r\nof temperature in this boring was about 1° for every 23 feet of\r\ndescent. In the mines opened in the great Comstock lode, in the western\r\nterritories of the United States, an abnormally high temperature has\r\nbeen met with amounting in some cases to 157° Fahrenheit. Although\r\nthis is the richest mineral-vein in the world, having yielded since\r\n1859, when it was first discovered, 60,000,000_l._ worth of gold and\r\nsilver, this rapid increase in temperature in going downwards threatens\r\nin the end to entirely baffle the enterprise of the miner. The rate\r\nof increase in temperature in the case of the Comstock mines has been\r\nestimated at 1° Fahrenheit for every 46 feet of descent, between 1,000\r\nand 2,000 feet from the surface, but as much as 1° Fahrenheit for every\r\n25 feet, at depths below 2,000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe facts which we have stated, with others of a similar kind, have\r\nled geologists to look with grave feelings of doubt upon the old\r\nhypothesis which regarded the increase of temperature found in making\r\nexcavations into the earth's crust as a proof that we are approaching a\r\ngreat incandescent nucleus. They have thus been led to enquire whether\r\nthere are any conceivable sources of high temperatures at moderate\r\ndepths--temperatures which would be quite competent to produce locally\r\nall the phenomena of volcanic action.\r\n\r\nThere are not wanting other facts which seem to point to the same\r\nconclusion: namely, that volcanic action is not due to the existence\r\nof a universal reservoir of incandescent material occupying the central\r\nportion of our globe, but to the local development of high temperatures\r\nat moderate depths from the surface.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEPTHS AT WHICH EARTHQUAKES ORIGINATE.]\r\n\r\nThe close connection between the phenomena of volcanoes and earthquakes\r\ncannot be doubted. It is true that some of those vibrations or tremors\r\nof the earth's crust, to which we apply the name of earthquakes,\r\noccur in areas which are not now the seat of volcanic action; and it\r\nis equally true that the stratified rock-masses of our globe, far\r\naway from any volcanic centres, exhibit proofs of violent movement\r\nand fracture, in the production of which, concussions giving rise\r\nto earthquake vibrations, could scarcely fail to have occurred. But\r\nit is none the less certain that earthquakes as a rule take place\r\nin those areas which are the seats of volcanic action, and that\r\ngreat earthquake-shocks precede and accompany volcanic outbursts.\r\nSometimes, too, it has been noticed that the manifestation of\r\nactivity at a volcanic centre is marked by the sudden decline of the\r\nearthquake-tremors of the district around, as though a safety-valve had\r\nbeen opened at that part of the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nMr. Mallet has shown that by the careful study of the effects\r\nproduced at the surface by earthquake-vibrations, we may determine\r\nwith considerable accuracy the point at which the shock or concussion\r\noccurred which gave rise to the vibration. Now it is a most remarkable\r\nfact that such calculations have led to the conclusion that, so far\r\nas is at present known, earthquake shocks never originate at greater\r\ndepths than thirty miles from the surface, and that in some cases\r\nthe focus from which the waves of elastic compression producing an\r\nearthquake proceed is only at the depth of seven or eight miles.\r\nAs we have already seen, there can be no doubt that in the great\r\nmajority of instances the forces originating earthquake-vibrations and\r\nvolcanic outbursts are the same, and independent lines of reasoning\r\nhave conducted us to the conclusion that these forces operate at very\r\nmoderate distances from the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, geologists have been led to enquire\r\nwhether there are any means by which we can conceive of such an\r\namount of heat, as would be competent to produce volcanic outbursts,\r\nbeing locally developed at certain points within the earth's crust.\r\nRecent discoveries in physical science which have shown the close\r\nrelation to one another of different kinds of force, and their mutual\r\nconvertibility, have at least suggested the possibility of the\r\nexistence of causes by which such high temperatures within certain\r\nportions of the earth's crust may be originated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DAVY'S CHEMICAL THEORY.]\r\n\r\nWhen, at the commencement of the present century, Sir Humphry Davy\r\ndiscovered the remarkable metals of the alkalies and alkaline earths,\r\nand at the same time demonstrated the striking phenomena which are\r\nexhibited if these metals be permitted to unite with oxygen, he at\r\nonce perceived that if such metals existed in an uncombined condition\r\nwithin the earth's crust, the access of water and air to the mass might\r\ngive rise to the development of such an amount of heat, as would be\r\ncompetent to produce volcanic phenomena at the surface. It is true that\r\nat a later date Davy recognised the chemical theory of volcanoes as\r\nbeing beset with considerable difficulties, and was disposed to abandon\r\nit altogether. It was argued, with considerable show of reason, that if\r\nthe heat at volcanic centres were produced by the access of water to\r\nmetallic substances, great quantities of hydrogen would necessarily be\r\nevolved, and this gas ought to be found in prodigious quantities among\r\nthe emanations of volcanoes. The fact that such enormous quantities of\r\nhydrogen gas are not emitted from volcanic vents has been held by many\r\nauthors to be fatal to the chemical theory of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nBut the later researches of Graham and others have made known facts\r\nwhich go far towards supplying an answer to the objections raised\r\nagainst the chemical theory of volcanoes. Various solids and liquids\r\nhave been shown to possess the power of absorbing many times their\r\nvolume of certain gases. Among the gases thus absorbed in large\r\nquantities by solids and liquids, hydrogen is very conspicuous. In\r\nsome cases gases are absorbed by metals or other solids in a state of\r\nfusion, and yielded up again by them as they cool.\r\n\r\nIt is a very remarkable circumstance that some meteorites are found\r\nto have absorbed large quantities of hydrogen gas, and this is given\r\noff when they are heated in vacuo. Thus it has been demonstrated that\r\ncertain meteorites have contained as much as forty seven times their\r\nown volume of hydrogen gas.\r\n\r\nWe have already pointed out that there are reasons for believing the\r\ninternal portions of our globe to be composed of materials similar to\r\nthose found in meteorites. If such be the case, the access of water\r\nto these metallic substances may result in the formation of oxides,\r\nattended with a great local development of heat, the hydrogen which\r\nis liberated being at once absorbed by the surrounding metallic\r\nsubstances. That this oxidation of the metallic substances in the\r\ninterior of our globe by the access of water and air from the surface\r\nis continually going on, can scarcely be doubted. We may even look\r\nforward to a far-distant period when the whole of the liquid and\r\ngaseous envelopes of the globe shall have been absorbed into its\r\nsubstance, and our earth thereby reduced to the condition in which we\r\nnow find the moon to be.\r\n\r\nThere is a second method by which high temperatures might be locally\r\ndeveloped within the earth's crust, which has been suggested by Vose,\r\nMallet, and other authors.\r\n\r\nWe have good grounds for believing that the temperature of our globe\r\nis continually diminishing by its radiation of heat into space. This\r\ncooling of our globe is attended by contraction, which results in\r\nmovements of portions of its crust. It may at first sight appear that\r\nsuch movements would be so small and insignificant as to be quite\r\nunworthy of notice. But if we take into account the vast size of our\r\nearth it will be seen that the movements of such enormous masses may be\r\nattended with the most wonderful results.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that if a part of the earth's crust fifty miles in\r\nthickness were to have its temperature raised 200° Fahrenheit, its\r\nsurface would be raised to the extent of 1,000 or 1,500 feet Le Conte\r\nhas pointed out that if we conceive the conduction of heat to take\r\nplace at slightly different rates along different radii of our globe,\r\nwe should at once be able to account for the existing inequalities of\r\nthe earth's surface, and for all those continental movements which can\r\nbe shown to have taken place in past geological periods.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DYNAMICAL THEORIES.]\r\n\r\nBut if we admit, as we have good grounds for doing, that the loss of\r\nheat from the external portions of our globe goes on more rapidly than\r\nin the case of the central masses, we have thereby introduced another\r\npowerful agent for the production of high temperatures within the\r\nearth's crust. The external shell of the globe will tend to contract\r\nupon the central mass, and in so doing a series of tangential strains\r\nwill result which will be capable of folding and crumpling the rocks\r\nalong any lines of weakness. That such crushing and crumpling has\r\nduring all geological periods taken place along lines of weakness\r\nin the earth's crust, is proved, as we have seen, by the phenomena\r\npresented by mountain-ranges. Now these crushings, crumplings, and\r\nother violent movements of great rock-masses must result in the\r\ndevelopment of a vast amount of heat, just as the forcing down of a\r\nbreak upon a moving wheel produces heat. This conclusion is strikingly\r\nconfirmed by the well-known geological fact that nearly all rocks which\r\nhave undergone great movement and contortion are found to present\r\nevidence of having been subjected to such chemical and crystalline\r\nactions, as would result from the development of a high temperature\r\nwithin their mass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECAPITULATION OF SEVERAL THEORIES.]\r\n\r\nLet us sum up briefly the various methods which have been suggested to\r\naccount for the high temperatures within certain parts of the earth's\r\ncrust by which volcanic phenomena are produced.\r\n\r\nOur globe may be conceived of as an incandescent liquid mass surrounded\r\nby a cooler, solid shell. If we regard this liquid interior mass as\r\nsupplying directly the various volcanic vents of the earth, it must be\r\nconceded that the outer shell is of comparatively slight thickness.\r\nBut astronomers are almost universally agreed that such a thin outer\r\nshell and inner liquid mass are quite incompatible with that rigidity\r\nwhich our planet exhibits under the attractions of its neighbours.\r\nGeologists are almost equally unanimous in regarding this hypothesis\r\nof a liquid nucleus and thin, solid shell as contradicted by the\r\nstability of the conditions which have been maintained during such\r\nlong past periods, and which exist at the present day. The extent and\r\ncharacter of volcanic action do not indicate a condition of general\r\ninstability in our earth, but one of stability subject to small and\r\nlocal interferences The grandest volcanic disturbances appear small and\r\ninsignificant, if we take into account the vast dimensions of the globe\r\nupon which they are displayed.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, we consider the outer solid shell to be of\r\ngreat thickness, we are met by the difficulty of accounting for the\r\nupheaval of liquid matter through such vast thicknesses of a solid\r\nshell. The differences in character of lavas extruded from closely\r\nadjoining volcanic districts seem equally difficult of explanation on\r\nany theory of a central, fluid nucleus and a solid, outer shell. Nor is\r\nthe distribution of heat within the earth's crust so uniform as might\r\nbe anticipated, if the source of that heat be a great central mass of\r\nhighly heated materials.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, geologists and physicists have enquired\r\nwhether any other conditions can be imagined as existing in the earth's\r\ninterior, which would better account for the observed phenomena than\r\ndoes the hypothesis of a liquid nucleus and a solid outer shell. Two\r\nsuch alternative hypotheses have been suggested.\r\n\r\nMr. Hopkins, adopting the theory that the earth has solidified both at\r\nthe centre and its outer surface, endeavoured to explain the occurrence\r\nof volcanoes and earthquakes by supposing that cavities of liquid\r\nmaterial have been left between the solid nucleus and the solid shell,\r\nand these cavities full of liquid material constitute the sources from\r\nwhich the existing volcanoes of the globe draw their supplies. But\r\nthis hypothesis is found to be beset with many difficulties when we\r\nattempt to apply it to the explanation of the phenomena of volcanic\r\naction. It entirely fails, among other things, to account for the\r\nremarkable fact that during past geological periods the scene of\r\nvolcanic action has been continually shifting over the surface of the\r\nearth, so that there is probably no considerable area of our globe\r\nwhich has not at one time or other been invaded by the volcanic forces.\r\n\r\nBy some other theorists, who have felt the full force of this last\r\nobjection, an attempt has been made to explain the phenomena of\r\nvolcanoes by supposing that the globe is solid from its surface to its\r\ncentre, but that the internal portions of the globe are at such a high\r\ntemperature that they are only retained in a solid condition by the\r\nenormous pressure to which they are subjected. The central masses of\r\nthe globe are thus regarded as being in an _actually_ solid, but in a\r\n_potentially_ liquid condition, and any local relief of pressure is at\r\nonce followed by the conversion of solid to liquefied materials, in the\r\ndistrict where the relief takes place, resulting in the manifestation\r\nof volcanic phenomena at the spot. It may be granted that this\r\nhypothesis better accords with the known facts of Vulcanology than any\r\nof those which we have previously described, but it is impossible to\r\nshut our eyes to the fact that not a few serious difficulties still\r\nremain. Thus it is based upon the assumption that the law of the\r\nelevation of the point of fusion by pressure is true at temperatures\r\nand pressures almost infinitely above those at which we are able to\r\nconduct observations; but neither experiment nor analogy warrant this\r\nconclusion, for the former shows that the elevation of the point of\r\nfusion by pressure goes on in a continually diminishing ratio, and the\r\nlatter famishes us with the example of volatile liquids which, above\r\ntheir critical points, obstinately remain in a gaseous condition under\r\nthe highest pressures. Nor is it easy upon this hypothesis to account\r\nfor the very irregular distribution of temperatures within the earth's\r\ncrust, as demonstrated by observations in mines, wells, and borings.\r\nThe hypothesis further requires the assumption that, at such very\r\nmoderate depths as are required for the reservoirs of volcanoes, the\r\neffects of pressure and temperature on the condition of rock-materials\r\nare so nicely balanced that the smallest changes at the surface lead to\r\na disturbance of the equilibrium.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIFFICULTIES NOT YET EXPLAINED.]\r\n\r\nIt is the weight of these several objections that has led geologists\r\nin recent years to regard with greater favour those hypotheses which\r\nseek to account for the production of high temperatures within parts of\r\nthe earth's crust, without having recourse to a supposed incandescent\r\nnucleus. If it can be shown that there are any chemical or mechanical\r\nforces at work within the crust of the globe which are capable of\r\nproducing local elevations of temperature, then we may conceive of a\r\ncondition of things existing in the earth's interior which is free\r\nfrom the objections raised by the astronomer on the score of the\r\nearth's proved rigidity, and by the geologist on the ground of its\r\ngeneral stability, and which at the same time seems to harmonise better\r\nwith the observed facts of the distribution of temperature within the\r\nearth's crust. How far the existence of such chemical and mechanical\r\nagencies capable of producing high temperatures within the crust of the\r\nglobe have been substantiated, we have already endeavoured to point out.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, then, that the questions of the nature of the\r\nearth's interior and the cause of the high temperatures which produce\r\nvolcanic phenomena, are still open ones. We have not yet got beyond the\r\nstage of endeavouring to account for the facts observed by means of\r\ntentative hypotheses. Some of these, as we have seen, agree with the\r\nfacts, so far as they are at present known, much better than others;\r\nbut the decision between them or the rejection of the whole of them in\r\nfavour of some new hypothesis, must depend on the results of future\r\nobservation and enquiry.\r\n\r\nIt may be well, before leaving this subject, to remark that they are\r\nall equally reconcilable with the nebular theory of Kant and Laplace.\r\nGranting that the matter composing our globe has passed successively\r\nthrough the gaseous and liquid conditions, it is open to us to imagine\r\nthe earth as now composed of a liquid nucleus with either a thick or\r\na thin solid shell; of a solid nucleus and a solid shell with more or\r\nless liquid matter between them; or, lastly, to conceive of it as\r\nhaving become perfectly solid from the centre to the surface.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF WATER IN LAVAS.]\r\n\r\nBut it is not upon the existence of a high temperature within certain\r\nparts of the earth's crust that the production of volcanic activity\r\nalone depends. The presence of water and other liquid and gaseous\r\nsubstances in a state of the most intimate admixture with the fused\r\nrock-masses, is, as we have seen, the main cause of the violent\r\ndisplays of energy exhibited at volcanic centres. And We shall now\r\nproceed to notice the hypotheses which have been suggested to account\r\nfor the presence of these liquid and gaseous bodies in the midst of the\r\nmasses of incandescent materials poured out from volcanic vents.\r\n\r\nThere is an explanation of this presence of water and various gases in\r\nthe masses of molten rock-materials within the earth's crust which at\r\nonce suggests itself, and which was formerly very generally accepted.\r\nVolcanoes, as we have seen, are usually situated near coast-lines, and\r\nif we imagine fissures to be produced by which sea-water finds access\r\nto masses of incandescent rock-materials, then we can regard volcanic\r\noutbursts as resulting from this meeting of water with rock-masses in a\r\nhighly healed condition. This supposition has been thought to receive\r\nmuch support from the fact that many of the gases evolved from volcanic\r\nvents are such as would be produced by the decomposition of substances\r\npresent in sea-water.\r\n\r\nBut it frequently happens that an explanation which at first sight\r\nappears to be very simple and obvious, turns out on more critical\r\nexamination to be quite the reverse, and this is the case with the\r\nsupposed origination of volcanic outbursts by the access of sea-water\r\nto incandescent rock-material by means of earth-fissures. It is\r\ndifficult to understand how, by such means, that wonderfully intimate\r\nunion between the liquefied rock and the water, evolved in such\r\nquantities during volcanic outbursts, could be brought about; and\r\nmoreover, we can scarcely regard the production of fissures in the\r\nearth's crust as being at the same time both the cause and the effect\r\nof this influx of water to the deep-seated rock-masses at a high\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ABSORPTION OF GASES BY LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS.]\r\n\r\nDuring recent years the attention of both geologists and physicists\r\nhas been directed to a remarkable property exhibited by many liquids\r\nand solids, as supplying a possible explanation of the phenomena of\r\nvolcanic action. The property to which we refer is that whereby some\r\nliquid and solid substances are able to absorb many times their volume\r\nof certain gases--which gases under different conditions may be given\r\noff again from the liquids or solids. This power of absorption is a\r\nvery remarkable one; it is not attended with chemical combination, but\r\nthe amount of condensation which gases must undergo within the solid or\r\nliquid substances is sometimes enormous. Water may be made to absorb\r\nmore than 1,000 times its volume of ammonia, and more than 500 times\r\nits volume of hydrochloric acid. Alcohol may absorb more than 300\r\ntimes its volume of sulphurous acid. Charcoal may absorb 100 times its\r\nvolume of ammonia, 85 times its volume of hydrochloric acid, 65 times\r\nits volume of sulphuretted hydrogen, 55 times its volume of sulphurous\r\nacid, and 35 times its volume of carbonic acid. Platinum-black absorbs\r\nmany times its volume of oxygen and other gases.\r\n\r\nThis power of absorption of gases varies in different solids and\r\nliquids according to the conditions to which they are subjected. Dr.\r\nHenry showed it to be a general law in liquids that, as the pressure is\r\naugmented, the weight of the gas absorbed is proportionately increased.\r\n\r\nSometimes this absorption of gases takes place only at high\r\ntemperatures. Thus silver in a state of fusion is able to absorb 22\r\ntimes its volume of oxygen gas. When the metal is allowed to cool this\r\ngas is given off, and if the cooling takes place suddenly a crust is\r\nformed on the surface, and the phenomenon known as the 'spitting of\r\nsilver' is exhibited. Sometimes during this operation miniature cones\r\nand lava-streams are formed on the surface of the cooling mass, which\r\npresent a striking resemblance to those formed on a grand scale upon\r\nthe surface of the globe. Similar phenomena are exhibited by several\r\nother metals and by the oxide of lead.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Troost and others have shown that molten iron and\r\nsteel possess the property of absorbing considerable quantities of\r\noxygen, hydrogen, carbonic acid, and carbonic oxide, and that these\r\ngases are given off in the operation known as 'seething,' when either\r\nthe pressure or the temperature is diminished.\r\n\r\nHochstetter has shown that in the process of extracting sulphur from\r\nthe residues obtained during the manufacture of soda, some very\r\ninteresting phenomena are manifested. The molten sulphur is exposed\r\nto a temperature of 262° Fahrenheit, and a pressure of two or three\r\natmospheres, in the presence of steam; under these circumstances it\r\nis found that the sulphur absorbs a considerable quantity of water,\r\nwhich is given off again with great violence from the mass as it\r\nundergoes solidification. The hardened crust which forms on the surface\r\nof the molten sulphur is agitated and fissured, miniature cones and\r\nlava-streams being formed upon it, which have a striking resemblance to\r\nthe grander phenomena of the same kind exhibited upon the crust of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nThe observations which we have described prove conclusively that many\r\nliquids and solids in a molten condition have the power of absorbing\r\nmany times their volume of certain gases, and that this action is aided\r\nby heat and pressure.\r\n\r\nThat the molten materials which issue from volcanic vents have\r\nabsorbed enormous quantities of steam and other gases, we have the\r\nmost undisputable evidence. The volume of such gases given off\r\nduring volcanic outbursts, and while the lava-streams are flowing\r\nand consolidating, is enormous, and can only be accounted for by\r\nsupposing that the masses of fluid rock have absorbed many times their\r\nvolume of the gases. But we have another not less convincing proof\r\nof the same fact in the circumstance that volcanic materials which\r\nhave consolidated under great pressure--such as granites, gabbros,\r\nporphyries, &c.--exhibit in their crystals innumerable cavities\r\ncontaining similar gases in a liquefied state.\r\n\r\nIt is to the violent escape of these gases from the molten rock-masses,\r\nas the pressure upon them is relieved, that nearly all the active\r\nphenomena of volcanoes must be referred; and it was the recognition of\r\nthis bet by Spallanzani, while he was watching the phenomena displayed\r\nin the crater of Stromboli, which laid the foundations of the science\r\nof Vulcanology.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOURCE OF THE ABSORBED GASES.]\r\n\r\nBut here another question presents itself to the investigator of the\r\nphenomena of volcanoes: it is this. At what period did the molten\r\nrock-masses issuing from vents absorb those gaseous materials which\r\nare given off so violently from their midst during eruptions? Two\r\ndifferent answers to this question have been suggested. It may be that\r\nthe original materials of which our globe was composed consisted of\r\nmetallic substances in a state of fusion which had absorbed many gases,\r\nand that, in the fluid masses below the solid crust, vast quantities of\r\nvapour and gas are stored up, which are being gradually added to the\r\natmosphere during volcanic outbursts. The fact that meteorites, which,\r\nas we have seen, in all probability closely resemble the materials\r\nforming the earth's interior, sometimes yield many times their volume\r\nof hydrogen and other gases, may be thought to lend some support to\r\nthis idea. If it be the correct one, we must regard our globe as\r\ngradually parting with its pent-up stores of energy, in those absorbed\r\ngases and vapours held in bondage by the solid and fluid materials of\r\nits interior.\r\n\r\nBut there is another hypothesis which is, to say the least, equally\r\nprobable. Water containing various gases in solution is continually\r\nfinding its way downwards by infiltration into the earth's crust.\r\nMuch of this water, after passing through pervious beds, reaches\r\nsome impervious stratum and is returned to the surface in the form\r\nof springs. But that some of this percolating water penetrates to\r\nenormous depths is shown by the fact that the deepest mines and borings\r\nencounter vast underground supplies of water. When we remember that\r\nnearly three-fourths of the earth's surface is covered by the waters\r\nof the ocean, and that the average depth of these oceanic waters is\r\nmore than 10,000 feet, we may easily understand how great a portion of\r\nthe earth's crust must be penetrated by infiltrating waters which can\r\nfind no outlet in springs. The penetration of the waters of the ocean\r\ninto the earth's crust will be aided, too, by the enormous pressure\r\namounting to not less than several tons to the square-inch upon the\r\ngreater part of the ocean-floor. It might be thought that this downward\r\npenetration of water would be counteracted by the upward current of\r\nsteam that would be produced as these subterranean waters reach the\r\nhotter portions of the earth's crust. But the experiments of Daubrée\r\nhave conclusively shown that the penetration of water through rocks\r\ntakes place in opposition to the powerful pressure of steam in the\r\ncontrary direction. Hence, we may assume that certain quantities of\r\nwater, containing various gases and solids in solution, are continually\r\nfinding their way by capillary infiltration from the surface to\r\nthe deeply seated portions of the earth's crust, there to undergo\r\nabsorption by the incandescent rock-masses and to produce oxidation of\r\nsome of their materials.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: POSITION OF THE ISOGEOTHERMS.]\r\n\r\nThe deep-sea soundings of the 'Challenger' have shown that the floor of\r\nthe ocean is constantly maintained at a temperature but little above\r\nthat of the freezing point of water. This low temperature is probably\r\nproduced by the absorption of heat from the earth's crust by the waters\r\nof the ocean, which distribute it by means of convection currents on\r\nthe grandest scale. Hence, the isogeotherms, or lines indicating the\r\ndepths at which the same mean temperature is found within the earth's\r\ncrust, are probably depressed beneath the great ocean-floors, and rise\r\ntowards the land-masses. It is to this circumstance, combined with\r\nthat of the enormous pressure of water on the ocean-beds, that we must\r\nprobably ascribe the general absence of volcanoes in the deep seas and\r\ntheir distribution near coast-lines.\r\n\r\nWe have thus briefly reviewed the chief hypotheses which have been\r\nsuggested in order to account for the two great factors in all volcanic\r\nphenomena--namely, the presence of highly heated rock-masses within\r\nthe earth's crust, and the existence of various vapours and gases in a\r\nstate of most intimate mechanical, but not chemical, union with these\r\nincandescent materials. It must be admitted that we do not at present\r\nappear to have the means for framing a complete and consistent theory\r\nof volcanic action, but we may hopefully look forward to the time when\r\nfurther observation and experiment shall have removed many of the\r\nexisting difficulties which beset the question, and when by the light\r\nof such future researches untenable hypotheses shall be eliminated and\r\nthe just ones improved and established.\r\n\r\nBut if we are constrained to admit that a study of the observed\r\nphenomena and established laws of volcanic action have not as yet\r\nenabled us to frame any complete and satisfactory theory on the\r\nsubject, we cannot lose sight of the fact that all modern speculation\r\nupon this question appears to be tending in one definite direction. It\r\nis every day becoming more and more clear that our earth is bound by\r\nties of the closest resemblance to the other members of that family of\r\nworlds to which it belongs, and that the materials entering into their\r\nconstitution, and the forces operating in all are the same.\r\n\r\nWe have had occasion in a previous chapter to point out that there\r\nare the strongest grounds for believing the interior of our globe to\r\nconsist of similar materials to those found in the small planetary\r\nbodies known as meteorites. That the comets are merely aggregations\r\nof such meteorites, and that the planets differ from them only in\r\ntheir greater dimensions, may be regarded as among the demonstrated\r\nconclusions of the astronomer. The materials found most abundantly in\r\nmeteorites and in the interior of our globe are precisely the same as\r\nthose which are proved to exist in an incandescent state in our sun.\r\nHence we are led to conclude that the whole of the bodies of the solar\r\nsystem are composed of the same chemical elements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ERUPTIVE ACTION IN THE SUN.]\r\n\r\nThat the forces operating in each of these distant bodies present\r\nstriking points of analogy is equally clear. The sun is of far greater\r\ndimensions than our earth, and is still in great part, if not entirely,\r\nin a gaseous condition. The great movements in the outer envelopes of\r\nthe sun exhibited in the 'sun-spots' and 'solar prominences,' recall\r\nto the mind the phenomena of volcanic activity upon our globe. But\r\nthe vast energy still existing in the intensely heated mass of the\r\nsun, and the wonderful mobility of its gaseous materials, give rise to\r\nappearances beside which all terrestrial outbursts seem to sink into\r\nutter insignificance. Vast cavities of such dimensions that many globes\r\nof the size of our earth might be swallowed up in them are formed\r\nin the solar envelopes in the course of a few days or hours. Within\r\nthese cavities or sun-spots incandescent vapours are observed, rushing\r\nupwards and downwards with almost inconceivable velocity.\r\n\r\nThe drawings made by Secchi, and reproduced in figs. 89 and 90, will\r\ngive some idea of the appearances presented by these great holes in the\r\nsolar envelopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89.--A group of Sun-spots. (After Secchi.)]\r\n\r\nIn fig. 89 a group of sun-spots is represented and, in their circular\r\noutlines and tendency to a linear arrangement, they can scarcely fail\r\nto remind anyone familiar with volcanic phenomena of terrestrial\r\ncraters, though their dimensions are so much greater.\r\n\r\nIn fig. 90 the sun-spot represented shows the presence of large\r\nfloating masses of incandescent materials rushing upwards and downwards\r\nwithin the yawning gulf.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PHENOMENA OF SUN-SPOTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 90.--A Sun-spot, showing the great masses of\r\nincandescent vapour rising or falling within it. (After Secchi.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 91.--The edge of a Sun-spot, showing a portion of\r\nthe prominent masses of incandescent gas (A), which detached itself at\r\nE and floated into the midst of the cavity.]\r\n\r\nFrom fig. 91, taken from a drawing by Mr. Norman Lockyer, we may\r\nunderstand the movements of these great protuberances of incandescent\r\ngas which are seen on the sides of the sun-spots.\r\n\r\nThe so-called solar prominences present even more striking resemblances\r\nto the volcanic outbursts of our globe.\r\n\r\nTwo drawings made by Mr. Norman Lockyer will serve to give some idea\r\nof the vast dimensions of these solar prominences, and of the rapid\r\nchanges which take place in their form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92.--Drawing of a Solar prominence, made by Mr.\r\nNorman Lockyer on March 14, 1869, at 11 H. 5 M. A.M.]\r\n\r\nThe masses of incandescent gas were estimated as being no less than\r\n27,000 feet in height, yet in ten minutes they had totally changed\r\ntheir form and appearance, as shown in fig. 93.\r\n\r\nEven still more striking are the changes recorded by Professor Young,\r\nof New-Haven, in a solar prominence, which he observed on September 7,\r\n1871.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93.--The same object, as seen at 11 H. 15 M. on the\r\nsame day.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SOLAR PROMINENCES.]\r\n\r\nThat astronomer described a mass of incandescent gas rising from\r\nthe surface of the sun to the height of 54,000 miles. In less than\r\ntwenty-five minutes he saw the whole mass torn to shreds and blown\r\nupwards, some of the fragments being in ten minutes hurled to the\r\nheight of 200,000 miles above the sun's surface. The masses of\r\nincandescent gas thus hurled upwards were of enormous dimensions, the\r\nsmallest being estimated as having a greater area than the whole of the\r\nBritish Islands, and the force with which they were urged upwards was\r\nso great that they acquired a velocity of 166 miles per second. The\r\naccompanying woodcut shows the successive appearances presented by this\r\ngrand eruptive outburst on the surface of the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94.--Drawings of a Solar prominence at four\r\ndifferent periods on Sept. 7, 1871. (After Young.)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: EXTINCT VOLCANOES OF THE MOON.]\r\n\r\nThe moon, which is of far smaller size than our earth, exhibits on\r\nits surface sufficiently striking evidences of the action of volcanic\r\nforces. Indeed the dimensions of the craters and fissures which cover\r\nthe whole visible lunar surface are such that we cannot but infer\r\nvolcanic activity to have been far more violent on the moon than it\r\nis at the present day upon the earth. This greater violence of the\r\nvolcanic forces on the moon is perhaps accounted for by the fact that\r\nthe force of gravity on the surface of the moon is only one-sixth of\r\nthat at the surface of the earth; and thus the eruptive energy will\r\nhave a much less smaller resistance to overcome in bursting asunder the\r\nsolid crust and accumulated heaps of ejected materials on its surface.\r\nBut the volcanic action on the moon appears now to have wholly ceased,\r\nand the absence of both water and atmosphere in our satellite suggests\r\nthat this extinction of volcanic energy may have been caused by the\r\ncomplete absorption of its gaseous envelope. The appearance presented\r\nby a portion of the moon's surface is shown in fig. 95.\r\n\r\nThe sun and the moon appear to exhibit two widely separated extremes\r\nin the condition assumed during the cooling down from a state\r\nof incandescence of great globes of vaporised materials. The\r\nseveral planets, our own among the number, probably exhibit various\r\nintermediate stages of consolidation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95.--A group of Lunar craters (Maurolycus,\r\nBarocius, etc.), the largest being more than 60 miles in diameter.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ERUPTIVE ACTION IN THE SUN, EARTH AND MOON.]\r\n\r\nOur earth is, as we have seen, closely allied to the other bodies of\r\nthe solar system in its movements, its relations, and its composition;\r\nand a true theory of terrestrial vulcanicity, when it is discovered,\r\nmay be expected not only to afford an explanation of the phenomena\r\ndisplayed on our own globe, but to account for those displays of\r\ninternal energy which have been manifested in other members of the same\r\ngreat family of worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n[The subjects illustrated in the engravings are indicated by _italics_,\r\nthe names of authors are in Capitals.]\r\n\r\n  ABICH, cited, 122\r\n  --
