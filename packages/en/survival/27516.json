The five entitled, \"The Farmer at Home,\" \"The\r\nLabourer's Daily Life,\" \"Field-faring Women,\" \"An English Homestead,\"\r\nand \"John Smith's Shanty,\" appeared in _Fraser's Magazine_ in 1874, long\r\nbefore Jefferies had gained any portion of that fame which was so long\r\nin coming, and came in full measure too late. Of the three letters to\r\nthe _Times_, written in 1872, one was republished, with the permission\r\nof Mrs. Jefferies, in an appendix to Mr. Walter Besant's \"Eulogy of\r\nRichard Jefferies.\" It finds its natural place in this volume with the\r\nother papers, which give so clear a picture of the life of all classes\r\nof the cultivators of the soil in the early seventies. The \"True Tale of\r\nthe Wiltshire Labourer\" has never previously been published, and is\r\nincluded in this volume by the kind permission of Mr. G. H. Harmer of\r\nthe _Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard_, for which paper it was written\r\nwhen Jefferies was on its staff, but for some reason was never used.\r\n\r\nAll the papers in Part II. have appeared in _Longman's Magazine_, since\r\nJefferies' death, and though they are with one exception very slight,\r\nyet they are all characteristic specimens of his work. From internal\r\nevidence it appears certain that the longest of them, entitled \"The\r\nComing of Summer,\" was written on June 1, 1881, and the subsequent days.\r\nIt contains one or two points of resemblance with the famous \"Pageant of\r\nSummer,\" which appeared in _Longman's Magazine_ for June 1883. It was\r\nperhaps the first study of which that paper is the finished picture.\r\n\r\nThe frontispiece is reproduced by kind permission of Mr. J. Owen of\r\nSalisbury, from a photograph taken by him of Miss Thomas' bust of\r\nJefferies in Salisbury Cathedral.\r\n\r\nC. J.

Whole\r\nstreets of houses present exact duplicates of each other, even to the\r\nnumber of steps up to the front door and the position of the scraper. In\r\nthe country, where a new farmhouse is erected about once in twenty\r\nyears, the styles of architecture are as varied and as irregular as in\r\ntown they are prim and uniform. The great mass of farmhouses are old,\r\nand some are very picturesque. There was a farmhouse I knew which was\r\nalmost entitled to be taken as the type of an English rural homestead.\r\nIt was built at a spot where the open wild down suddenly fell away into\r\nrich meadow land. Here there was a narrow steep-sided valley, or\r\n\"combe\"--and at the mouth of this, well sheltered on three sides from\r\nthe north, the east, and north-eastern winds, stood the homestead. A\r\nspring arose some way behind, and close to the house widened into a pool\r\nwhich was still further enlarged by means of a dam, forming a small lake\r\nof the clearest water. This lake fed a mill-race lower down. The\r\nfarmyard and rick-barton were a little way up the narrow valley, on one\r\nside of which there was a rookery. The house itself was built in the\r\npure Elizabethan style; with mullioned windows, and innumerable gables\r\nroofed with tiles. Nor was it wanting in the traditions of the olden\r\ntime. This fine old place was the homestead of a large farm comprising\r\nsome of the best land of the district, both down and meadow. Another\r\nfarmhouse, still used for that purpose, stands upon the wildest part of\r\nthe down, and is built of flint and concrete. It was erected nearly\r\nthree hundred years ago, and is of unusual size. The woodwork is all\r\nsolid black oak, good enough for an earl's mansion.\r\n\r\nThese are specimens of the highest class of farmhouse. Immediately\r\nbeneath them come the houses built in the early part of the present\r\ncentury. They vary in almost every architectural detail, and the\r\nmaterials differ in each county; but the general arrangement is the\r\nsame. They consist as it were of two distinct houses under one roof. The\r\nfront is the dwelling-house proper, usually containing a kitchen,\r\nsitting-room, and parlour. The back contains the wood-house (coal-house\r\nnow), the brewhouse--where the beer was brewed, which frequently also\r\nhad an oven--and, most important of all, the dairy. All this part of the\r\nplace is paved with stone flags, and the dairy is usually furnished with\r\nlattice-work in front of the windows, so that they can be left open to\r\nadmit the cool air and not thieves. Coolness is the great requisite in a\r\ndairy, and some gentlemen who make farming a science go to the length of\r\nhaving a fountain of water constantly playing in it. These houses,\r\nhowever, were built before scientific agriculture was thought of. The\r\nwood-house contained the wood used for cooking and domestic purposes;\r\nfor at that date wood was universally used in the country, and coal\r\nrarely seen. The wood was of course grown on the farm, for which purpose\r\nthose wide double mound hedges, now rapidly disappearing, were made. It\r\nwas considered a good arrangement to devote half-an-acre in some\r\noutlying portion of the farm entirely to wood, not only for the fire,\r\nbut for poles, to make posts and rails, gates, ladders, &c. The coal\r\ncould not in those days be conveyed so cheaply as it now is by railways.\r\nSuch as was used had to be brought by the slow barges on the canals, or\r\nelse was fetched by the farmers' waggons direct from the pit-mouth. The\r\nteams were not unfrequently absent two days and a night on the journey.\r\nIn the outlying districts this difficulty in obtaining coal practically\r\nrestricted the available fuel to wood. Now the wood-house is used as\r\nmuch for coal as wood. Of course the great stacks of wood--the piles of\r\nfaggots and logs--were kept outside, generally in the same enclosure as\r\nthe ricks, only a sufficient number for immediate use being kept under\r\ncover. The brewhouse was an important feature when all farmers brewed\r\ntheir own beer and baked their own bread. At present the great majority\r\npurchase their beer from the brewers, although some still brew large\r\nquantities for the labourers' drinking in harvest time. At a period when\r\ncomparatively little ready money passed between employer and employed,\r\nand the payment for work was made in kind, beer was a matter which\r\nrequired a great deal of the attention of the farmer, and absorbed no\r\nlittle of his time. At this day it is a disputed matter which is\r\ncheapest, to buy or to brew beer: at that time there was no question\r\nabout it. It was indisputably economical to brew. The brewhouse was not\r\nnecessarily confined to that use; when no brewing was in progress it was\r\noften made a kind of second dairy. Over these offices was the\r\ncheese-room. This was and still is a long, large, and lofty room in\r\nwhich the cheese after being made is taken to dry and harden. It is\r\nfurnished with a number of shelves upon which the cheeses are arranged,\r\nand as no two can be placed one on the other in the early stage of their\r\nmaturing, much space is required. It is the duty of the dairymaid and\r\nher assistant to turn these cheeses every morning--a work requiring some\r\nstrength. In this part of the house are the servants' rooms. In front of\r\nthe dairy and brewhouse is a paved court enclosed with a wall, and in\r\nthis court it was not uncommon to find a well, or hog-tub, for the\r\nrefuse of the dairy. Sometimes, but not often now, the pig-stye is just\r\noutside the wall which surrounds the court. In this court, too, the\r\nbutter is generally churned, under a \"skilling\" which covers half of it.\r\nHere also the buckets are washed, and other similar duties performed.\r\nThe labourers come here to receive their daily allowance of beer.\r\n\r\nMost farmhouses in large arable farms were originally built so as to\r\nhave a small dairy at the back; though there was a time when the arable\r\nfarmer never thought of keeping a cow, and butter and cheese were\r\nunknown, except as luxuries, in his establishment. This was during the\r\ncontinuance of the Corn Laws, when everything was sacrificed to the one\r\ngreat object of growing wheat. It was not impossible in those days to\r\nfind a whole parish (I know of one myself) in which there was not a\r\nsingle cow. Now the great object is meat, then it was corn. But at the\r\ntime when most of the farmhouses were erected, the system of agriculture\r\npursued was a judicious mixture of the dairy and the cornfield, so that\r\nvery few old farmhouses exist which have not some form of dairy\r\nattached. In the corn-growing times, most of the verdant meadows now\r\nemployed to graze cattle, or for producing hay, were ploughed up. This\r\nmay be seen by the regular furrows, unmistakable evidences of the\r\nplough. When corn declined in price through the influx of foreign\r\nproduce, the land was again laid down in grass, and most of it continues\r\nso till this hour. It might be roughly estimated that England now\r\ncontains a third more meadow land than in the early part of the present\r\ncentury, notwithstanding the attempt to plough up the downs.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the third class of farmsteads--low thatched buildings,\r\nlittle better than large cottages, and indeed frequently converted into\r\ndwellings for labourers. These are generally found on small farms, and\r\nin districts where there are a number of small landed proprietors. These\r\nfreeholders built houses according to their means. In process of time\r\nthey were bought up by the great landowners, and the farms thrown\r\ntogether, when the houses were used for other purposes. Some may still\r\nbe found, especially in dairy districts. In these the principal part of\r\nthe house is usually the dairy, which absorbs at least half of the\r\nground floor, and opens on the kitchen, in which the family sit, and in\r\nwhich their food is often cooked. The eaves of the house are low, and\r\nthere are scarcely any appliances for comfort. The yeomen who originally\r\nlived in these places in all respects resembled the labourers with whom\r\nthey ate and drank and held the most familiar intercourse. Their\r\nlabourers even slept in the same bedrooms as the family. But these men,\r\nthough they mingled so freely with the labourer, were his worst enemy.\r\nThe little profit they made was entirely accumulated by careful economy.\r\nThey were avaricious and penurious to the last degree, and grudged every\r\nhalfpenny to the labouring man. They were, and the remnant of them still\r\nare, the determined opponent of all progress. The interior of some of\r\nthese cottage-farmsteads, which still exist, is almost Dutch-like in\r\nsimplicity and homeliness. The fireplace is of a vast size, fitted with\r\nantique iron dogs for burning wood, and on it swing the irons to sustain\r\nthe great pot. On each side, right under the chimney, are seats, the\r\ningle-nook of olden times. The chimney itself is very large, being\r\nspecially built for the purpose of curing sides of bacon by smoking. The\r\nchimneypiece is ornamented with a few odd figures in crockery-ware,\r\nhalf-a-dozen old brass candlesticks, and perhaps a snuff-box or tobacco\r\ndish. The floor is composed of stone flags--apt to get slimy and damp\r\nwhen the weather is about to change--and the wide chinks between them\r\nare filled with hardened dirt. In the centre there is a piece of carpet\r\non which the table stands, but the rest of the room is bare of\r\ncarpeting, except the hearth-rug. The low window has a seat let into the\r\nwall under it. The furniture of the apartment is utilitarian in the\r\nstrictest sense. There is nothing there for ornament or luxury, or even\r\nfor ease; only what is absolutely necessary. Generally there is a\r\ndresser, above which, on shelves, the dishes and plates are arranged. A\r\ntall upright eight-day clock, with a brazen face, and an inscription\r\nwhich tells that it was manufactured in a neighbouring village, stands\r\nin one corner, and solemnly ticks in its coffin-like panelled case. On\r\neach side of the fireplace there is an arm-chair, often cushioned with\r\na fox or badger skin, and a great brazen warming-pan hangs near the\r\ndoor. There is no ceiling properly so called. These old houses were\r\nalways built with a huge beam, and you can see the boards of the floor\r\nabove, which are merely whitewashed. A fowling-piece, once a flint-lock,\r\nnow converted to the percussion cap system, hangs against the beam, and\r\nsometimes dried herbs may be seen there too. The use of herbs is,\r\nhowever, going out of date. In the evening when the great logs of wood\r\nsmoulder upon the enormous hearth and cast flickering shadows on the\r\nwalls, revealing the cat slumbering in the ingle-nook, and the dog\r\nblinking on the rug--when the farmer slowly smokes his long clay pipe\r\nwith his jug of ale beside him, such an interior might furnish a good\r\nsubject for a painter. Let the artist who wishes to secure such a scene\r\nfrom oblivion set to work speedily, for these things are fast fading\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAll these three classes of farmhouse are usually well supplied with\r\nvegetables from the garden attached. The garden in fact was, and still\r\nis, an object of considerable importance to the farmer, quite as much\r\nas the allotment to the labourer. He reckons to receive from it his\r\nwhole supply of potatoes, cabbages, beans, peas, and other varieties of\r\ntable vegetables, and salads. These constitute an important item when\r\nthere is a large family. I do not speak now of the great farmers,\r\nalthough even these set some store by such produce, but the middle\r\nclass. It is usual in these gardens to grow immense quantities of\r\ncabbage of a coarse kind, and also of lettuce, onions, and radishes, all\r\nof which are freely given to the men and women working on the place\r\nduring the harvest. They are, in fact, grown especially for them. At the\r\ndinner-hour one or more men of the number, deputed by the rest, come up\r\nto the house. One carries the wooden bottles, or small barrels of ale,\r\nwhich are handed out from the dairy. The other repairs to the garden,\r\nand pulls up a reasonable quantity of lettuce, onions, or radishes, as\r\nthe case may be, from the patches indicated to him by the employer.\r\nThese are then washed in the court by the dairy, where there is almost\r\nalways a pump, and are then taken out to the men and shared amongst\r\nthem. These salads make an agreeable addition to the dry bread and\r\ncheese, or bacon. The custom is an old one, and much to be commended. It\r\ncosts the employer next to nothing, and is an element in that goodwill\r\nwhich should exist between him and the labourer.\r\n\r\nOn some farms large quantities of fruit are grown--such as gooseberries,\r\ncurrants, plums, and damsons. Most have enough for their own use; some\r\nsell a considerable amount. Outside the garden is the orchard. Some of\r\nthese orchards are very extensive, even in districts where cider is not\r\nthe ordinary beverage, and in a good apple year the sale of the apples\r\nforms an important item in the peculiar emoluments of the farmer's wife.\r\nThere are, of course, many districts in which the soil is not adapted to\r\nthe apple, but as a rule the orchard is an adjunct of the garden. Some\r\nof the real old English farmsteads possess the crowning delight of a\r\nfilbert walk, but these are rare now. In fact the introduction of\r\nmachinery and steam, and the general revolution which has been going on\r\nin agriculture, has gone far to sweep away these more pleasant and\r\nhome-like features of the farm. It becomes daily more and more like a\r\nmere official residence, so to speak. The peculiar home-like aspect of a\r\nfarmhouse is gradually disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe daily life of the middle-class dairy farmer begins at five in the\r\nmorning. Rising about that hour, his first duty is to see that the men\r\nhave all appeared, and that they are engaged in milking the cows. He\r\nbreakfasts at six, or half-past, and the whole family have finished\r\nbreakfast before seven. By this time the day-labourers have come (the\r\nmilkers are usually hired by the year), and the master has to go out and\r\nput them on to their jobs. Meantime the dairy is a scene of work and\r\nbustle; cheesemaking being in full swing. This is at least\r\nsuperintended, if not partly performed, by the mistress of the house. At\r\nlarger farms it is the bailiff who rises early and sees that the\r\nlabourers are properly employed; and the cheesemaking is entrusted to a\r\ndairymaid hired at high wages, who often combines with that duty the\r\noffice of general housekeeper. It was once the practice to rise even\r\nearlier than five, but there are not many farmers who do so now. On the\r\narable farm, which is generally much larger, the master has almost\r\nalways got a bailiff, or head-carter, whom he can trust to see the men\r\nset to work. The master is therefore not obliged to come down so soon,\r\nexcept at important seasons. But the ordinary dairy-farm is not large\r\nenough to support a bailiff, and the master has to rise himself. The\r\nfresh morning air and the exercise give the farmer a tremendous appetite\r\nfor breakfast. The usual staple food consists of thick rashers of bacon\r\nonly just \"done,\" so as to retain most of the fat, the surplus of which\r\nis carefully caught on slices of bread. The town rasher is crisp,\r\ncurled, and brown, without a symptom of fat or grease. The farmer's\r\nearly rasher is to a town eye but half-done, bubbling with grease, and\r\nlaid on thick slices of bread, also saturated with the gravy. Sometimes\r\ncold bacon is preferred, but it is almost always very fat. With this he\r\ndrinks a pint or so of fairly strong beer, and afterwards has a hunch of\r\nbread and butter and a cup or two of tea. He is then well fortified for\r\nthe labour of the morning. This is the common breakfast of the\r\nworking-farmer, who is as much a labouring man as any cottager on his\r\nfarm, and requires a quantity of solid food. Some, however, who are\r\npretty well off, and have a better idea of the luxuries of the table,\r\nregale themselves on collared head, or rolled beef, or ham at breakfast.\r\nThese hams are usually preserved after a family receipt, and some of\r\nthem are exquisite. After breakfast the farmer walks round the place,\r\nwatches the men at work for a few minutes, and gives them instructions,\r\nand then settles himself down to some job that requires his immediate\r\nsuperintendence. If it is hay-time he takes a rake and works about the\r\nfield, knowing full well all the difference that his presence makes.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural labourers, both men and women, are a slow set, never in\r\na hurry; there is none of that bustle characteristic of the town people,\r\neven of the lowest class. They take every opportunity of leaning upon\r\nthe prong-handle, or standing in the shade--they seem to have no idea of\r\ntime. Women are a sore trial to the patience of the agriculturist in a\r\nbusy time. If you want to understand why, go and ensconce yourself\r\nbehind a hedge, out of sight but in view of a field in which ten or\r\ntwelve women are hoeing. By and by a pedlar or a van comes slowly along\r\nthe turnpike road which runs past the field. At the first sound of\r\nfootsteps or wheels all the bent backs are straight in an instant, and\r\nall the work is at a standstill. They stand staring at the van or tramp\r\nfor five or six minutes, till the object of attention has passed out of\r\nsight. Then there is a little hoeing for three or four consecutive\r\nminutes. By that time one of them has remembered some little bit of\r\ngossip, and stops to tell her nearest fellow-workwoman, and the rest at\r\nonce pause to listen. After a while they go on again. Now another\r\nvehicle passes along the road, and the same process of staring has to be\r\ngone through once more. If a lady or gentleman pass, the staring is\r\nsomething terrific, and it takes quite ten minutes to discuss all the\r\nprobabilities as to who they were, and where they were going. This sort\r\nof thing goes on all day, so that, in point of fact, they only do half a\r\nday's work. The men are not so bad as this; but they never let slip an\r\nopportunity for pausing in their work, and even when at work they do it\r\nin a slow, dawdling, lack-energy way that is positively irritating to\r\nwatch. The agriculturist has in consequence plenty to do to keep his\r\neye on them, and in the course of the day he walks over his farm\r\nhalf-a-dozen times at least. Very few ordinary working farmers walk much\r\nless than ten miles a day on the average, backwards and forwards over\r\nthe fields.\r\n\r\nHalf-past eleven used to be luncheon time, but now it is about twelve,\r\nexcept in harvest, when, as work begins earlier, it is at eleven. This\r\nluncheon hour is another source of constant irritation to the\r\nagriculturist. He does not wish to bind his men down to an exact minute,\r\nand if a man has some distance to walk to his cottage, will readily make\r\nall allowance. He does not stint the beer carried out either then or in\r\nthe field. But do what he likes, be as considerate as he will, and let\r\nthe season be never so pressing, it is impossible to get the labourers\r\nout to their work when the hour is up. Most of them go to sleep, and\r\nhave to be waked up, after which they are as stupid as owls for a\r\nquarter of an hour. One or two, it will be found, have strolled down to\r\nthe adjacent ale-house, and are missing. These will come on the field\r\nabout an hour later. Then one man has a rake too heavy for him, and\r\nanother a prong too light. There is always some difficulty in starting\r\nto work; the agriculturist must therefore be himself present if he\r\nwishes to get the labourers out to the field in anything like a moderate\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe nuisance of mowers must be gone through to be appreciated. They come\r\nand work very well for the first week. They slash down acre after acre,\r\nand stick to it almost day and night. In consequence the farmer puts on\r\nevery man who applies for work, everything goes on first-rate, and there\r\nis a prospect of getting the crop in speedily. At the end of the week\r\nthe mowers draw their money, quite a lump for them, and away they go to\r\nthe ale-house. Saturday night sees them as drunk as men can be. They lie\r\nabout the fields under the hedges all day Sunday, drinking when the\r\npublic-house is open. Monday morning they go on to work for\r\nhalf-an-hour, but the fever engendered by so much liquor, and the\r\ndisordered state of the stomach, cause a burning thirst. They fling the\r\nscythes down, and go off to the barrel. During all this week perhaps\r\nbetween them they manage to cut half an acre. What is the result? The\r\nhaymakers have made all the grass that was cut the first week into hay,\r\nand are standing about idle, unable to proceed, but still drawing their\r\nwages from the unfortunate agriculturist. The hot sun is burning\r\non--better weather for haymaking could not be--but there is not a rood\r\nof grass cut for them to work on. After a while the mowers come back,\r\nthoroughly tired and exhausted with their debauch, and go on feebly to\r\nwork. There is hope again. But our climate is notoriously changeable. A\r\nfortnight of warm, close heat is pretty sure to breed a thunderstorm.\r\nAccordingly, just as the scythes begin to lay the tall grass prostrate\r\nagain, there is a growl in the sky, and down comes the rain. A\r\nthunderstorm unsettles the weather, and here is perhaps another week\r\nlost. The farmer dares not discharge his haymakers, because he does not\r\nknow but that he may require them any day. They are put to turn\r\ndung-heaps, clean out the yards, pick up the weeds in the garden, and\r\nsuch like little jobs, over which they can dawdle as much as they like.\r\nAll the while they are on full pay. Now, what manufacturer could endure\r\nsuch conduct as this? Is it not enough to drive a saint out of his\r\npatience? Of course the larger farmers who can afford it have the\r\nresource of the mowing-machine, but there are hundreds and thousands of\r\nfarms upon which its sharp rattle has not yet been heard. There is still\r\na great divergence of opinion as to its merits, many maintaining that it\r\ndoes not cut so close to the ground, and therefore wastes a large\r\npercentage of the crop, and others that the action of the scissor-like\r\nknives bruises the grass, and prevents it growing up into a good\r\nafter-math. Therefore many farmers who could afford it will not admit\r\nthe mowing-machine into their fields, and the mowers may still be seen\r\nat work over miles and miles of meadow, and are still the plague of the\r\nagriculturist. The arable farmer has just the same difficulty to keep\r\nhis labourers at their work, and unless he is constantly on the watch\r\nvaluable time is lost daily. In the harvest, however, he has an\r\nadvantage. The corn is reaped by piece-work, and the labourers therefore\r\nstrain every nerve to do as much as they can. But then he must be on the\r\nlookout to see that they do not \"scamp\" it.\r\n\r\nThe traditional bacon and greens dinner is passing away, though still\r\nthe usual fare in the small farmhouses. Most of the fairly well-to-do\r\nfarmers have a joint twice or three times a week, well supported with\r\nevery kind of vegetable. There is no attempt at refinement in cooking,\r\nbut there is plenty of good substantial food.\r\n\r\nThe hill farmer, whose staple is sheep and wool, has generally a great\r\ndeal of walking or riding to get over in the day. The down farms are\r\nsometimes very large, running perhaps in long narrow strips of land for\r\ntwo or three miles. Although he employs a head-shepherd, and even a\r\nbailiff, he finds it necessary, if he would succeed in making a profit,\r\nto be pretty well ubiquitous. They all want looking after sharply. Not\r\nthat there is much actual dishonesty; but would any manufacturer endure\r\nto have his men sitting doing nothing on their benches for fifteen\r\nminutes out of every hour of the working day, just because his back was\r\nturned? The hill farmer has, perhaps, a preferable life in some respects\r\nto the agriculturist in the vale. He has not so much actual manual\r\nlabour to get through. On the other hand, he is at a great distance\r\nfrom any town, or even large village; he sees no one during the day, and\r\nhe has to run great risks. Wool may fall, so may the price of mutton,\r\neither of which would derange his calculations; or the fly may destroy\r\nhis turnips, or the season may be exceptionally dry and unfavourable.\r\nHis house is lonely, perched on the side of a hill, and exposed to the\r\nbitter blasts of winter which sweep over the downs with resistless fury,\r\nand which no doors nor windows can exclude. If there should be snow, it\r\nis sure to fall in greater quantities on the hills, and, driving before\r\nthe wind, fills up the hollows, till the roads are impassable for weeks.\r\n\r\nTaking all the year round, the work of the agriculturist begins and ends\r\nwith the rising and setting of the sun. There is an exception, because\r\nthe cows must be milked and foddered nearly as early in the winter, when\r\nthe sun rises very late, as at other seasons; but then, to make up for\r\nthat, work ends earlier in the afternoon. In the spring, as the evenings\r\ndraw out, there is almost always something to be done even after the\r\nlabourers have left. In harvest time, the superintendence of work\r\ncontinues till late, and in the autumn labour is not unfrequently\r\nprolonged into the moonlight, in order to carry the corn. It is a life,\r\non the whole, of hard work.\r\n\r\nIn all this I speak of the ordinary middle-class farmer. The life of the\r\nhigher class of agriculturists, who possess large capital, and employ\r\nbailiffs and all kinds of machinery, is of course not by any means so\r\nonerous. It is in general character pretty much that of an independent\r\ngentleman, with the addition of the sporting element, and a certain\r\nfreedom from drawing-room trammels.\r\n\r\nTo get at the physique of the agriculturists, the best plan is to pay a\r\nvisit to the market-town. Here almost every farmer in the neighbourhood,\r\nno matter of what class--highest, middle, or lowest--is nearly sure to\r\nbe seen on market-days. The upper class come in in their smart\r\nwaggonettes, or dog-carts, drawn by thoroughly good and stylish horses,\r\nwhich are little, if at all, inferior to those of the gentry. Some of\r\nthese keep their groom and coachman, who dress in livery of a quiet and\r\nsubdued kind, but still unmistakably a livery. The middle-class come in\r\nin traps, or old-fashioned four-wheelers, generally bringing their wives\r\nand daughters, to do the shopping of the week. The market-day is, in\r\nfact, the event of the week, and the streets of the market-town are the\r\nRotten Row of the neighbourhood. The wives and daughters come in their\r\nbest dresses, and promenade up and down, and many a flirtation goes on\r\nwith the young bucks of the district. The lower class of farmers jog in\r\non their mares, rough as cart-horses, and the rider generally so manages\r\nto seat himself as to show three or four inches of stocking between his\r\ntrousers and boots. After the market is over, and the dealing done, the\r\nfarmers resort to the various inns, and dine at the market ordinary. A\r\nvery good dinner is usually provided at a low charge on these days. Soup\r\nis not usual, the dinner generally beginning with fish, followed by\r\njoints, and fowl of various kinds. Wine \"whips\" are formed, and the\r\nsherry circulates freely. There is a regular chairman, always a man of\r\nproperty and influence, and an old frequenter of the place. After\r\ndinner they sit an hour or two discussing, not only the price of sheep\r\nand wool or mutton, but the political and other events of the day. The\r\nChambers of Agriculture are generally so arranged as to meet on\r\nmarket-days, about an hour after the ordinary finishes, and not\r\nunfrequently in the same room. The market-towns derive great benefit\r\nfrom this habit of congregating on the market-day. It is the day, too,\r\nfor paying visits by the ladies. Gay costumes pass through the streets,\r\nand bright eyes look out of the windows of the hotels upon the crowd of\r\nfarmers. The yards of the various hostelries are made almost impassable\r\nby the innumerable variety of vehicles. The young farmers take the\r\nopportunity of playing a game at billiards, which they rarely do on\r\nother days. The news of the whole countryside is exchanged, and spreads\r\nfrom mouth to mouth, and is carried home and sent farther on its way.\r\nOne great characteristic is the general good-humour that prevails. The\r\nlaugh and the joke are frequently heard--it is a kind of moderate\r\ngala-day. The fishmonger's shop is emptied, and the contents carried\r\nhome, this being the only day in the week when fish is bought by the\r\nmajority of agriculturists. Some towns have only what is called a\r\n\"gin-and-water\" market: that is, the \"deal\" is begun and concluded from\r\nsmall samples carried in the pocket and examined at an inn over a glass\r\nof spirits and water. But in the great market-towns there is now almost\r\nalways a large room, or hall, set aside for this special purpose. The\r\nmarket begins and concludes at a fixed time, indicated by the ringing of\r\na bell. In this hall the dealers have stands, furnished with desks, at\r\nwhich they may always be found, and here sacks of samples are pitched.\r\nThere is a clerk of the market, and the current prices are posted up,\r\nand afterwards sent to all the local newspapers. The cattle-market used\r\nto be carried on entirely in the streets, each farmer selling his own\r\nbeasts or sheep by private treaty with the dealers. The streets were\r\nthen often filled with cattle from one end to the other, and were almost\r\nimpassable for vehicles, and at times not a little dangerous for\r\nfoot-passengers. Now the practice of selling by auction has become very\r\ngeneral, and the cattle are either put into the auctioneer's private\r\nyard, or in an enclosure provided by the town authorities. The\r\ncorn-dealers are a most energetic class of men, well educated, and often\r\nemploying large capital in their business. They are perpetually\r\ntravelling, and often attend two markets a day. Having struck a bargain,\r\nthe farmer and the purchaser adjourn to the hotel, and have a glass of\r\nspirits, without which no transaction seems complete. The use of beer\r\nhas very much declined among the fairly well-to-do agriculturists. They\r\ndrink it at dinner and lunch, but whenever a glass is taken with a\r\nfriend, or in calling at an inn, it is almost invariably spirits. Whisky\r\nhas been most extensively drunk of late years.\r\n\r\nNo other class of men employing so much capital and so many labourers\r\nare so simple in their habits as the agriculturists. In dress they\r\nadhere to the plainest colours and shapes; there is no attempt to keep\r\npace with the fashion. The materials of the coat and vest are good, and\r\neven expensive, but the cut is old and out of date, and the whole effect\r\nquite plain. There is no shirt front, no studs, no rings, no kid gloves.\r\nThe boots are strong and thick, substantial, but not ornamental. A man\r\nwith his ten or fifteen thousand perhaps will walk down the street\r\nbuttoned up in an ungainly greatcoat and an old hat, not half so smartly\r\ndressed as a well-paid mechanic, and far behind the drapers' assistants\r\nin style. There is a species of contempt among them for the meretricious\r\nand showy; they believe in the solid. This very fact makes them good\r\nfriends to shopkeepers, who have no better customers. They carry this\r\nleading idea too far, for they admire an article in precisely a\r\ncorresponding ratio to the money it costs, totally oblivious of all\r\nconsiderations of art or ornament. The first question invariably is, if\r\nthey are asked to admire anything, \"What did it cost?\" This results in a\r\nheavy and cumbrous style of furniture even in the best farmsteads.\r\nEverything must be massive, costly, and strong. Artistic tendencies they\r\nhave none. They want something durable, and they get it. But on the\r\nwhole they make marvellously little show for their money. Hundreds of\r\nthe most substantial agriculturists, whose cheques would be honoured for\r\nthousands of pounds, seem absolutely to make no show at all. At the\r\nsame time it is quite true that some of the rising generation, who have\r\nvery little to do it on, make a great display with hunters and plated\r\nharness, and so forth. But they are not the rule. The generality go just\r\nthe other way, and live below their income, and take a lower station in\r\nsociety than they might reasonably claim.\r\n\r\nFarmers are decidedly a marrying class of men. The farm is a business in\r\nwhich a wife is of material service, and can really be a helpmate. The\r\nlower class of farmers usually marry quite as much or more for that\r\nreason than any others. The higher classes of agriculturists feel that\r\nthey have a right to marry because they too can show a home in which to\r\nkeep a wife. Though they may not have any large amount of capital, still\r\nthey possess a good house and sufficient provision. They are, therefore,\r\na marrying class of men, but do not commonly contract matrimonial\r\nalliances very early in life. The great object of an agriculturist who\r\nhas sons is to get them settled in farms, and it is astonishing to what\r\nan extent this is carried by men who do not seem to have much capital to\r\nstart their children with. Instances are common in which a man has\r\nthree or four sons all in farms, and doing fairly well. One of the\r\ngreatest difficulties he has to contend against is the necessity of\r\nproviding education. Where is a farmer, living perhaps two or three\r\nmiles, often enough four and six miles, from a town, to send his boys to\r\nschool? The upper class of agriculturists can, of course, afford to have\r\na proper governess at home till they are old enough, and then send them\r\nto one of the so-called middle-class schools. The lower class, on the\r\nother hand, who do not aspire very high, and whose ideas are little more\r\nambitious than those of their labourers, are contented with the school\r\nin the neighbouring village. Till recently these village schools were\r\nvery poor affairs, something a little better than the old dame school,\r\nbut not much. But since the new Education Act the lower class of farmers\r\nare in a better position with respect to education than those who\r\npossess much higher claims to social distinction. Where there is not a\r\nschool board, the clergyman and the landowners have combined, and built\r\nfirst-rate schools, up to all the requirements of the Act, and attended\r\nby properly certified teachers. The lower class farmer, who is troubled\r\nwith no scruples about the association of his boys with the labourers'\r\nchildren, can send them to this school at a very low charge indeed, and\r\nthey will there receive a good foundation. But the middle-class\r\nfarmer--the man who is neither an independent gentleman, nor obliged to\r\nlive on bacon and greens--is unprovided for, and yet this class is the\r\nmost numerous. They have better views for their sons than to confine\r\nthose early impressions upon which so much depends to the narrow and\r\nrude, if not coarse manners of the labourers' children. They look higher\r\nthan that, and they are fully justified in doing so. They do not,\r\ntherefore, at all relish the idea of sending their boys to the national\r\nschool of the parish, let it be never so well supplied with teachers.\r\nThere is another objection to it. It has a faint suspicion of the\r\npauper. Now if there is anything a downright English yeoman abominates\r\nmore than all the rest it is any approach to the \"parish.\" This is a\r\n\"parish\" school. It is not a paupers' school--that is admitted--but it\r\nis a \"parish\" school, to which the children of men who have often\r\nreceived relief are sent. The yeoman's instinct revolts at it. Attempts\r\nhave been made to get over this niceness of feeling by erecting a\r\nspecial class-room for farmers' sons, and patriotic baronets have even\r\ngone so far as to send their own boys so as to set the example. But it\r\nis in vain. The middle-class farmer is above all men exclusive in his\r\nideas. He detests the slightest flavour of communism. He likes to be\r\ncompletely and fully independent. He will not patronise the \"parish\"\r\nschool. What then is he to do? At this present moment most farmers' sons\r\nare sent into the neighbouring towns to the middle-class schools which\r\nare to be found there. If the farmer is within two or three miles the\r\nboys walk or ride on ponies every morning. If it is farther than that\r\nthey go as weekly boarders, and return home every Saturday. The fault in\r\nthis system is simply and solely in the character of the school. Too\r\noften it is a school in name only, where the boys learn next to nothing\r\nat all, except mischief. Very few schools exist in these small country\r\ntowns which afford a good education at a moderate price. It is almost\r\nimpossible that they should exist without an endowment, as the scholars\r\ncan never be numerous enough to make the profits exceed the expenditure.\r\nThe result is that the middle-class farmer cannot give his boys a good\r\neducation unless he sends them to what is called a middle-class school\r\nin some town at a great distance, and this he cannot afford. The sum\r\ndemanded by these so-called middle-class schools is beyond his reach. He\r\nmay, perhaps, if he has only one son, indulge in the expensive luxury of\r\na sound and thorough education for him. But if there are several the\r\nthing is out of the question. With the girls it is even worse--where can\r\nhe send them? They cannot very well walk or ride to and fro like the\r\nboys to the school in the nearest town, and if they are boarded at such\r\nschools, the education given is paltry and meagre in the extreme. A good\r\ngirls' school is one of the rarest things in the country. The result is\r\nthat a governess is kept while the girls are young. This governess is\r\nunderpaid, and has consequently herself been only partially educated.\r\nThen as the girls grow older they are sent for a year or two, to\r\n\"finish\" them, to some young ladies' academy, and the ultimate product\r\nis a smattering of French and music, and crude ideas of fashion and\r\nrefinement, which make them dissatisfied with their home and unfit for\r\nan agricultural life as the wife of a farmer.\r\n\r\nThe nonsense talked and published of farmers having pianos, and their\r\ndaughters strumming all day long instead of attending to the dairy, is\r\nperfectly absurd. It is quite true that in hundreds of farmhouses, just\r\nat the time when the dairy is in full work in the morning, a piano may\r\nbe heard going. This is the governess instructing the girls when the\r\nfarmer is not sufficiently rich to send them to a school. But when once\r\nthese girls are grown up, and have finished their education, poor as it\r\nis, and return home to take a part in the household duties, then the\r\npiano is never heard in the morning when work is about. The farmer's\r\nwife sees to that sharp enough. In the evening it may be heard--and why\r\nnot? If the agricultural labourer is to be polished up and refined, why\r\non earth should not his employer take a step in advance? It must be\r\nremembered that there is very little society in the country; scarcely\r\nany one even passing along the road. There are none of those cheap\r\nsights and amusements so readily accessible to the poorest in a great\r\ncity. The wives and daughters of the mechanics and workmen in London can\r\nonce a week at least afford to enjoy themselves at some theatre or place\r\nof amusement. They are far better off in this respect than the daughters\r\nof agriculturists who may be worth thousands. These have nothing\r\nwhatever to amuse themselves with during the long evenings; they cannot\r\neven take a stroll out and look at the shop windows. They are surely\r\nentitled to the simple and inexpensive amusement of a piano. It is in\r\nfact their only resource. There was a statement in the newspapers of\r\nfarmers taking their daughters to Paris. It is possible that some of the\r\nupper class of farmers, who are in fact independent gentlemen, may have\r\ndone so; but as for the ordinary middle-class farmers, such a thing is\r\nutterly unheard of. It is very few of them who even take their wives to\r\nLondon or the seaside for a week. But even if they did, it is nothing\r\nmore than they are entitled to do. Half the tradesmen who do such things\r\ndo not possess anything like the income of the farmers. The fact is,\r\nthat the agriculturists are a singularly stay-at-home race of men. The\r\ngreat majority never leave their farms to go farther than the\r\nmarket-town from one year's end to the other. Above all classes they are\r\nattached to their homes, and slow to go away even temporarily. To such a\r\nlength is this feeling carried that men have been known to go partially\r\ninsane for a while at the prospect of having to quit a farm through a\r\nlandlord's decease, even though no appreciable pecuniary loss was\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThe agriculturists are a remarkably observant race, and as a rule\r\npeculiarly well-informed. This is contrary to the popular belief, which\r\nrepresents the farmer as rude and ignorant, a pot-bellied beer-drinker,\r\nand nothing more. But the popular belief is a delusion. I do not say\r\nthat they are literary or scientific in their tastes and private\r\npursuits. There are no great names among them in geology, or astronomy,\r\nor anthropology, or any other science. They are not artists in any\r\nsense. But they are singularly well-informed. They possess more general\r\nknowledge than any other class, and can converse on subjects with which\r\ntownsmen seem unacquainted. Many of them have very fair libraries, not\r\nextensive, but containing books of sterling excellence. Farming is\r\nnecessarily an isolated business--there is little society. Except on\r\nmarket-days, there is scarcely any interchange of conversation. There\r\nis, too, at certain seasons of the year a good deal of leisure. What\r\nbooks they own, therefore, are well read, and the contents reflected\r\nupon. It is that habit of thinking over what is read that makes all the\r\ndifference. It is impossible to avoid being struck with the immense\r\namount of general information possessed by some agriculturists, and the\r\nwide field over which their knowledge ranges. Yet with all this\r\nknowledge and power of reflection they still remain attached to the\r\nold-world system of politics, religion, and social relations.\r\n\r\nThe habits of intemperance which were at one time a just and standing\r\nreproach against the agriculturist have almost entirely disappeared. A\r\ndrunken farmer is now unknown. They are as fond as ever of offering\r\nhospitality to a friend, and as ready to take a social glass--no total\r\nabstainers amongst them; but the steady hard-drinking sot has passed\r\naway. The old dodge of filling the bottle with gin instead of water,\r\nand so pouring out pure spirit, instead of spirit and water, when the\r\nguests were partially intoxicated, in order to complete the process, is\r\nno more known. They do not drink more than the inhabitants of towns.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that with so many streams and ponds scattered\r\nabout the country within easy reach, the farmers do not care for\r\nfishing. A farmer engaged in fishing is a rarity indeed. They are\r\neagerly fond of fox-hunting, coursing, and shooting, but fishing is a\r\ndead letter. A party will sometimes go out and net a pond, but as for\r\nfishing proper, with rod and line, it is almost unknown. Every chance of\r\nshooting is eagerly snatched at. In May the young rooks are shot, after\r\nwhich the gun is put aside for a while. At the end of July some of the\r\nyoung rabbits are ready, and are occasionally knocked over. Very few\r\ntenant farmers shoot game even when they could do so, leaving that for\r\nsome neighbouring gentleman with whom they are friendly, and this too\r\nwithout any remuneration, the fact being that winged game does little\r\ndamage. But they wage unceasing war on the rabbits, with dog and gun\r\nand ferret. All the winter long they are hunted in every possible way.\r\nThis is, of course, on farms where the tenant has permission to kill the\r\nrabbits. Whist and post and pair are the staple indoor amusements.\r\n\r\nOf all businesses that of agriculture is peculiarly adapted to descend\r\nfrom father to son. In point of fact, farms so frequently pass from the\r\nfather to the son as to be looked upon almost as a certain inheritance.\r\nIn agriculture, then, it must be expected that the effects of inherited\r\ninstincts and ideas should be very plainly shown. From this cause arises\r\nthe persistent and unreasoning Conservatism of the mass of\r\nagriculturists. Out of a list of one hundred farmers, I find that one\r\nresides upon a farm which has been in the occupation of members of the\r\nsame family for three hundred years. He possessed a series of documents,\r\nreceipts, special agreements, and so on, proving that descent beyond all\r\ncavil; but with the usual want of proper appreciation for antiquities,\r\nmost of these papers have been committed to the flames; still there is\r\nno question of the fact, which can still be shown from the landlord's\r\nfamily archives. Nominally that farm has been in the occupation of one\r\nfamily for ten generations, reckoning by the ordinary calculation of\r\nthirty years to each. But this average is not fairly applicable to the\r\nagricultural life, which is generally long, and occasionally extends\r\ninto extreme old age. There were probably about eight successors if the\r\nline was unbroken; if not, there may of course have been treble that\r\nnumber. A man may be excused some amount of pride when he thinks of such\r\na continuance as this in one spot, for it means not only an exceptional\r\nvitality of race, but an exceptional perseverance in the paths of\r\nhonesty and straightforwardness. But with this pride it also engenders a\r\nstubborn unchangeableness, a dislike and hatred of all things new and\r\nunfamiliar, a nervous dread of reform. Faithful to the logic of their\r\nclass, such men as these may in resisting innovations go to lengths\r\nwhich may appear foolish and wrong to others who live in a widely\r\ndifferent social atmosphere. To some extent the bitter opposition to\r\nchange in the position of the labourer, which is thrown in the teeth of\r\nthe tenant farmer, is the outcome of these very centuries of steady\r\nadherence to all that they believed upright and manly.\r\n\r\nAnother name on my list has been known at one spot for fully two hundred\r\nyears. These men attained a position beyond that of yeoman, but they\r\nnever sank beneath it. The rise of many of the great county families\r\nreally dates from the success of some ancestor, or the collective\r\nsuccess of a series of ancestors, in agriculture. They perhaps claim\r\nsome knight or nobleman as the founder of the race, although he may have\r\nreally done nothing for the practical advantage of the family; the true\r\nfounders being merely proprietors of land, dignified as J.P.'s, and\r\nsometimes sheriffs, throwing off branches into the clerical and legal\r\nprofessions. The real ancestor was the sturdy yeoman who accumulated the\r\nmoney to purchase the farm he tilled, and whose successors had the good\r\nsense to go on adding acre to acre till they finally expanded into the\r\nwide domains of the modern squire. Not the knight whose effigy in brass\r\npaves the aisle of the parish church laid the corner-stone of the wealth\r\nand power of to-day, but the shrewd and close-fisted producer and dealer\r\nin wool and corn. Their true claim to aristocratic privileges and\r\nimportance is the sense of centuries of independence. These others of\r\nwhom we have spoken, the yeoman who never aspired beyond the yeoman's\r\nposition, are as ancient and as \"worshipful\"--to use an old and disused\r\nterm--as they. I do not instance these descents of three and two hundred\r\nyears as extraordinary, because I believe that they could be paralleled\r\nand even extended by inquiry, but because they came under my own\r\nobservation. There are others on the list ranging from one hundred and\r\nsixty down to sixty and eighty years of continued occupation. But not to\r\ngo into details, I reckon on an average that thirty names out of a\r\nhundred have been the occupiers for three generations; forty for two\r\ngenerations; twenty for one hundred and fifty years; and ten are new\r\ncomers. But a still more curious and instructive fact is the permanence\r\nof certain names over a wide section of country; so much so that in\r\nplaces it is a common saying that one has only to be an A, or a B, or a\r\nT, to be certain of getting a farm. Whole parishes seem related, and not\r\nvery distantly related either; and yet there is not the remotest\r\nclass-feeling or _esprit de corps_. The isolation and independence of a\r\nfarm life are powerful agents in preventing anything like cohesion. Any\r\none who will take the trouble to look down the parish register in a\r\nstrictly agricultural district will be forcibly struck with the\r\npermanence of certain names. Page after page contains nothing but\r\nrecords of the marriages, intermarriages, burials, baptisms, and so on\r\nof two or three generic names. The population appears to have been\r\nstationary for scores upon scores of years. Say what you will, ridicule\r\nit as you like, there is a charm clinging round that which time has\r\nhallowed; and even the man of the hour, the successful speculator,\r\nyields to this. It is his most eager desire to become a landed\r\nproprietor, and if possible he buys a place where he can exercise\r\nmanorial rights.\r\n\r\nTaking these things into consideration, it is only reasonable to admit\r\nthat agriculture is a profession in which a man may, above all others,\r\nbe excused if he manifests a certain amount of irritability at the\r\nprospect of change. The slow round of uneventful years, the long\r\ncontinuance of manual labour, the perpetual iteration of a few ideas, in\r\ntime produce in the mind of the most powerfully intellectual men a\r\nspecies of unconscious creed; and this creed is religiously handed down\r\nfrom generation to generation. Setting aside those who have gone into\r\nagriculture as a science, and adapt everything to commercial\r\nprinciples--and they are as yet not very numerous--the great mass of\r\nfarmers believe nearly the same now as they did two centuries ago.\r\nLooking through a farmer's calendar published in the first few years of\r\nthis century, and containing a complete _resume_ of the system of\r\nagriculture practised then, I was struck by the remarkable fact that in\r\nall main features it was the same as that in use now. We have heard so\r\nmuch of the rapid progress of agriculture, of the important changes\r\nintroduced, and of the complete revolution which has taken place, that\r\nthis statement may appear incredible. It is nevertheless the fact that\r\nthat book might be put with advantage into the hands of any young man\r\nabout to enter upon a farm. With the exception of those operations which\r\nare now performed by steam, and making an allowance for the altered\r\nconditions introduced by the abolition of the Corn Laws, the\r\ninstructions given there are useful down to this very day. Here is the\r\nknowledge of the peculiarities and requirements of stock slowly\r\naccumulated during ages of agriculture, and at last written down and\r\nprinted for easy reference. However much the aspect of politics may\r\nchange, or however much the means of locomotion and communication may be\r\nfacilitated by the introduction of steam, Nature still remains\r\nunaltered. The cows and sheep retain their instincts and their internal\r\neconomy; their modes of feeding, times of rest, and seasons of increase,\r\nnever vary. The earth too has not changed. The corn is sown at the same\r\ntime; Nature goes on her way as before, heedless of the railway rattle.\r\nSo it is that the details of management in this book are as useful now\r\nas then, more than two generations since. It is the same with the\r\nunwritten faith of the men who labour and live among these things. Go\r\nout among them, and collect from the majority their views and\r\nsentiments, and in this age of progress they will be found to correspond\r\nalmost exactly with those of their forefathers, as recorded by history.\r\nThey know that such is the fact themselves; they know too that it would\r\nsubject them to sharp criticism and reproof if they published their real\r\nopinions. Therefore they remain silent, and it is only among themselves\r\nthat these ideas are earnestly insisted on.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest days of agriculture, when Abraham drove his flocks and\r\nherds to and fro under the Syrian sun, the father of the family was at\r\nonce the procreator, the law-giver, the judge, the leader in battle, the\r\npriest, and the king. He was absolute master under Heaven of all things\r\nvisible around him. The Pope claims to be infallible now, and to be the\r\nvicegerent of Heaven, but the patriarch of old actually possessed those\r\npowers upon his own domain. His sons were under his complete control--he\r\ncould sacrifice them alive to his God if he chose, or banish them from\r\ntheir native land. His daughters were still more completely in his hand,\r\nto be done with as he thought fit. His servants, his slaves, were as\r\nmuch his as the wooden pole of his tent, or the very sandals he walked\r\nin. They were as dust before him. There was no coming of age in those\r\ndays; no escape after the twenty-first year. The tie lasted till his\r\ndeath. At forty his sons and daughters were as much his own as they were\r\nat ten years old. They tell us that this system, to some extent, still\r\nsurvives in China. In all fundamental points such is the creed of the\r\nagricultural race of our own day. Circumstances have, no doubt, had\r\nsomething to do with the production and elaboration of such a faith. In\r\nno other profession do the sons and the daughters remain so long, and so\r\nnaturally, under the parental roof. The growth of half-a-dozen strong\r\nsons was a matter of self-congratulation, for each as he came to man's\r\nestate took the place of a labourer, and so reduced the\r\nmoney-expenditure. The daughters worked in the dairy, and did not\r\nhesitate to milk occasionally, or, at least, to labour in the hayfield.\r\nThey spun, too, the home-made stuffs in which all the family were\r\nclothed. A man's children were his servants. They could not stir a step\r\nwithout his permission. Obedience and reverence to the parent was the\r\nfirst and greatest of all virtues. Its influence was to extend through\r\nlife, and through the whole social system. They were to choose the wife\r\nor the husband approved of at home. At thirty, perhaps, the more\r\nfortunate of the sons were placed on farms of their own nominally, but\r\nstill really under the father's control. They dared not plough or sow\r\nexcept in the way that he approved. Their expenditure was strictly\r\nregulated by his orders. This lasted till his death, which might not\r\ntake place for another twenty years. At the present moment I could point\r\nout ten or twelve such cases, where men of thirty or forty are in farms,\r\nand to all appearance perfectly free and independent, and yet as\r\ncompletely under the parental thumb as they were at ten years old. Why\r\ndo they not throw off the burden? Because they have imbibed the same\r\ncreed, and intend to carry it out in their own persons. These men, if\r\nthey think thus of their own offspring, cannot be expected to be more\r\ntender towards the lower class around them. They did at one time, and\r\nsome still wish to, extend the same system to the labouring population.\r\nAs there was in those days little or no work for a man but upon a farm,\r\nand as the cottages were chiefly in the hands of the farmers, there was\r\nplenty of opportunity for carrying out these ideas. The old method of\r\npoor relief gave another handle. They did not want only to indulge in\r\ntyranny; what they did was to rule the labouring poor in the same way as\r\nthey did their own children--nothing more nor less. These labouring men,\r\nlike his own children, must do as the farmer thought best. They must\r\nlive here or there, marry so and so, or forfeit favour--in short, obey\r\nthe parental head. Each farmer was king in his own domain; the united\r\nfarmers of a parish were kings of the whole place. They did not use the\r\npower circumstances gave them harshly; but they paid very little regard\r\nto the liberty of the subject. To this very day something of the same\r\nsort goes on. It is wonderful with what eager zeal many of the old-style\r\nfarmers enter into the details of a labourer's life, and carefully\r\nascertain his birth, his parentage, his marriage, his wife's parentage,\r\nand the very minutest matters. These facts thus accumulated are talked\r\nover in the boardroom when an applicant comes to the union for relief.\r\nVery often such special knowledge possessed by a guardian of the\r\nantecedents of the applicant is most useful and beneficial in enabling\r\nthe Board to extend assistance to a deserving man. What I wish to show\r\nis the all-permeating influence of the parental system in the mind of\r\nthe typical agriculturist.\r\n\r\nIn religion it is, or lately was, the same. It was not a matter with the\r\nfarmer of the Athanasian creed, or the doctrine of salvation by faith,\r\nor any other theological dogma. To him the parish church was the centre\r\nof the social system of the parish. It was the keystone of that parental\r\nplan of government that he believed in. The very first doctrine preached\r\nfrom the pulpit was that of obedience. \"Honour thy father and mother\"\r\nwas inculcated there every seventh day. His father went to church, he\r\nwent to church himself, and everybody else ought to go. It was as much a\r\nsocial gathering as the dinner at the market ordinary, or the annual\r\naudit dinner of their common landlord. The dissenter, who declined to\r\npay church-rates, was an unsocial person. He had left the circle. It was\r\nnot the theology that they cared about, it was the social nonconformity.\r\nIn a spiritual sense, too, the clergyman was the father of the parish,\r\nthe shepherd of the flock--it was a part of the great system. To go a\r\nstep farther, in political affairs the one leading idea still threaded\r\nitself through all. The proper parliamentary representative--the natural\r\nlaw-giver--was the landlord of the district. He was born amongst them,\r\nwalked about amongst them, had been in their houses many a time. He knew\r\ntheir wants, their ideas, their views. His own interest was identical\r\nwith theirs. Therefore he was the man. The logic is indisputable. What\r\nis more, they acted up to it. In agricultural districts it is not\r\nuncommon even now to find men of diametrically opposite political views\r\nto the candidate at an election voting for and supporting him, simply\r\nand solely because he is the local man. It is natural and right that he\r\nshould represent them. That one word \"right\" is the key to the whole\r\nethical system of the agriculturists. They cherish and maintain their\r\nbelief in right, and in their \"rights\"--by which they understand much\r\nthe same thing--even when unaccompanied by any gain or advantage. In\r\nbrief outline, such is the creed of the agriculturists as a body. It is\r\nneither written nor spoken, but it is a living faith which influences\r\nevery hour of their lives.\r\n\r\nThis faith must ever be borne in mind by those who wish to understand\r\nthe movements of the agricultural world. Without making a proper\r\nallowance for it, the farmers will be easily misjudged.\r\n\r\nThe labouring class are imbued to a great extent with the very same\r\nideas. They stick to their rights. They will not give up an old pathway\r\nthat their fathers used, not if one twice as convenient be offered in\r\nlieu of it. They have a right to go that way, and go that way they will.\r\nThey are brutally tyrannical over their children. I use those words\r\ndeliberately. He who spares the rod spoils the child, is the practical\r\nrule of their conduct. They seem to look upon their offspring as merely\r\nslaves. They are fond of them in their way, no doubt, but the law of\r\nimplicit obedience is maintained by dint of blows and stripes. The\r\nchildren are kicked, punched, and thrashed perpetually. A good\r\nground-ash stick is the gospel of the labouring man. They carry the same\r\nplan into their work. How many carters have been severely fined and\r\nimprisoned for whipping, and sometimes even maiming, the boys under\r\ntheir commands? And yet the old practice still continues, only a little\r\nchecked by wholesome terror of the law.\r\n\r\nDespite of all the teaching of the Radical papers, all the whispers of\r\nthe Methodist itinerant preachers, despite the hatred which the\r\nLabourers' Union agents endeavour to sow between the labourer and the\r\nfarmer, still the great mass of labourers at the last election,[1]\r\nwherever they had a vote, supported the local candidate--the man who\r\nrepresented the soil--and declined to do more than listen to the\r\nbrilliant promises held out by the party of change. So strong above all\r\nthings is the force of tradition and custom.\r\n\r\nThe agriculturists are firmly and earnestly wedded to that unwritten\r\ncreed which has grown up among them out of the past. Why, then, should\r\nthey be so hardly dealt with, more than others, for adhering to this\r\nfaith? Argue with them, educate them up to your standard if you\r\nlike--but is it fair, is it just, is it in accordance with that spirit\r\nof liberalism and tolerance which their opponents profess, to taunt,\r\nabuse, and bully to the full length that words will permit? They are not\r\nfacile at expression, these same men of the soil. The flow of language\r\nseems denied to them. They are naturally a silent race--preferring deeds\r\nto speech. They live much with inarticulate nature. It may be, after\r\nall, they have learnt some useful and abiding lessons from that\r\nintercourse. The old shepherds on the plains of Chaldea, under the\r\nstarry skies of the East, watched the motions of those shining bodies\r\ntill they slowly built up a religion, which, mixed with much dross,\r\nnevertheless contained some truths which educated men profess to this\r\nhour. These English farmers also observe the changes of the seasons, and\r\nwatch the face of heaven. Their deepest convictions are not to be\r\nlightly set aside. There are men amongst them of great powers of\r\nthought. I remember one at this moment whose grand old head would have\r\nbeen a study for an artist. A large head he had, well-balanced, broad\r\nand high at the forehead, deep-set eyes, straight nose, and firm\r\nchin--every outward sign of the giant brain within. But the man was\r\ndumb. The thoughts that came to him he could communicate roughly to his\r\nfriends, but the pen failed him. The horny hand which results from\r\nmanual labour is too stiff to wield the swiftly-gliding quill. But there\r\nis another species of handwriting which is called Work--a handwriting\r\nwhich will endure when the scribblings of the hour are utterly\r\nforgotten. This writing he laboured at earnestly and eagerly, not for\r\nhis own good either, for it absorbed his own fortune, no small one, in\r\nthe attempt to realise his conception of machinery which would double\r\nthe yield of food. It has been done since his time, other men stepping\r\nover the bridge of experience which he had built. Now this man, who, on\r\nthe principles of the opponents of the agriculturists, was a benefactor\r\nto his species, and a pioneer of true progress, was, nevertheless, one\r\nof the firmest, staunchest, most uncompromising supporters of that creed\r\nwhich they are endeavouring to destroy, and which may be stated thus: \"I\r\nbelieve in the Sovereign, the Church, and the Land: the Sovereign being\r\nthe father of the people in a temporal sense; the Church in a spiritual\r\nsense; and the Land being the only substantial and enduring means of\r\nsubsistence. Cotton, coal, and iron cannot be eaten, but the land gives\r\nus corn and beef; therefore, the land stands first and foremost, and the\r\nagriculturist, as the tiller of land, possesses an inalienable right\r\nwhich it is his duty to maintain, and in so doing he is acting for the\r\ngood of the community. I believe that the son and the daughter should\r\nobey their parents, and show regard to their wishes even when legally\r\nindependent. Also that the servant should obey his employer. The\r\nconnection between employer and employed does not cease with the payment\r\nof wages. It is the duty of the servant to show consideration for the\r\nadvice of the master; and the master is not free from responsibility as\r\nto the education and the comfort of the man. The master is bound by all\r\nlaws, human and divine, to pay a fair amount of wages for a day's work.\r\nIf he does not do so he robs the workman as much as if he stole the\r\nmoney from his pocket. The workman is equally bound to do his work\r\nproperly, and in neglecting to do so he robs his employer. To demand\r\nmore wages than has been earned is an attempt at robbery. Both master\r\nand man should respect authority, and abide by its decisions.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is a slight outline of the home-life and the faith of the farmer.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] Feb. 1874.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE LABOURER'S DAILY LIFE._\r\n\r\n\r\nMany labourers can trace their descent from farmers or well-to-do\r\npeople, and it is not uncommon to find here and there a man who believes\r\nthat he is entitled to a large property in Chancery, or elsewhere, as\r\nthe heir. They are very fond of talking of these things, and naturally\r\ntake a pride in feeling themselves a little superior in point of\r\nancestry to the mass of labourers.\r\n\r\nHow this descent from a farmer to a labourer is managed there are at\r\nthis moment living examples going about the country. I knew a man who\r\nfor years made it the business of his life to go round from farm to farm\r\nsoliciting charity, and telling a pitiful tale of how he had once been a\r\nfarmer himself. This tale was quite true, and as no class likes to see\r\ntheir order degraded, he got a great deal of relief from the\r\nagriculturists where he was known. He was said to have been wild in his\r\nyouth, and now in his old age was become a living representative of the\r\nfarmer reduced to a labourer.\r\n\r\nThis reduction is, however, usually a slow process, and takes two\r\ngenerations to effect--not two generations of thirty years each, but at\r\nleast two successors in a farm.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the decline of a farming family began in an accession of\r\nunwonted prosperity. The wheat or the wool went up to a high price, and\r\nthe farmer happened to be fortunate and possessed a large quantity of\r\nthose materials. Or he had a legacy left him, or in some way or other\r\nmade money by good fortune rather than hard work. This elated his heart,\r\nand thinking to rise still higher in life, he took another, or perhaps\r\ntwo more large farms. But to stock these required more money than he\r\ncould produce, and he had to borrow a thousand or so. Then the\r\ndifficulty of attending to so large an acreage, much of it distant from\r\nhis home, made it impossible to farm in the best and most profitable\r\nmanner. By degrees the interest on the loan ate up all the profit on the\r\nnew farms. Then he attempted to restore the balance by violent high\r\nfarming. He bought manures to an unprecedented extent, invested in\r\ncostly machinery--anything to produce a double crop. All this would have\r\nbeen very well if he had had time to wait till the grass grew; but\r\nmeantime the steed starved. He had to relinquish the additional farms,\r\nand confine himself to the original one with a considerable loss both of\r\nmoney and prestige. He had no energy to rise again; he relapsed into\r\nslow, dawdling ways, perpetually regretting and dwelling on the past,\r\nyet making no effort to retrieve it.\r\n\r\nThis is a singular and strongly marked characteristic of the\r\nagricultural class, taken generally. They work and live and have their\r\nbeing in grooves. So long as they can continue in that groove, and go\r\nsteadily forward, without much thought or trouble beyond that of\r\npatience and perseverance, all goes well; but if any sudden jolt should\r\nthrow them out of this rut, they seem incapable of regaining it. They\r\nsay, \"I have lost my way; I shall never get it again.\" They sit down and\r\nregret the past, granting all their errors with the greatest candour;\r\nbut the efforts they make to regain their position are feeble in the\r\nextreme.\r\n\r\nSo our typical unfortunate farmer folds his hands, and in point of fact\r\nslumbers away the rest of his existence, content with the fireside and a\r\nroof over his head, and a jug of beer to drink. He does not know French,\r\nhe has never heard of Metternich, but he puts the famous maxim in\r\npractice, and, satisfied with to-day, says in his heart, _Apres nous le\r\nDeluge_. No one disturbs him; his landlord has a certain respect and\r\npity for him--respect, perhaps, for an old family that has tilled his\r\nland for a century, but which he now sees is slowly but irretrievably\r\npassing away. So the decayed farmer dozes out his existence.\r\n\r\nMeantime his sons are coming on, and it too often happens that the brief\r\nperiod of sunshine and prosperity has done its evil work with them too.\r\nThey have imbibed ideas of gentility and desire for excitement utterly\r\nforeign to the quiet, peaceful life of an agriculturist. They have\r\ngambled on the turf and become involved. Notwithstanding the fall of\r\ntheir father from his good position, they still retain the belief that\r\nin the end they shall find enough money to put all to rights; but when\r\nthe end comes there is a deficiency. Among them there is perhaps one\r\nmore plodding than the rest. He takes the farm, and keeps a house for\r\nthe younger children. In ten years he becomes a bankrupt, and the family\r\nare scattered abroad upon the face of the earth. The plodding one\r\nbecomes a bailiff, and lives respectably all his life; but his sons are\r\nnever educated, and he saves no money; there is nothing for them but to\r\ngo out to work as farm labourers.\r\n\r\nSuch is something like the usual way in which the decline and fall of a\r\nfarming family takes place, though it may of course arise from\r\nunforeseen circumstances, quite out of the control of the agriculturist.\r\nIn any case the children graduate downwards till they become labourers.\r\nNowadays many of them emigrate, but in the long time that has gone\r\nbefore, when emigration was not so easy, many hundreds of families have\r\nthus become reduced to the level of the labourers they once employed. So\r\nit is that many of the labourers of to-day bear names which less than\r\ntwo generations ago were well known and highly respected over a wide\r\ntract of country. It is natural for them to look back with a certain\r\ndegree of pleasure upon that past, and some may even have been incited\r\nto attempt a return to the old position.\r\n\r\nBut the great majority, the mass, of the agricultural labourers have\r\nbeen labourers time out of mind. Their fathers were labourers, their\r\ngrandfathers and their great-grandfathers have all worked upon the\r\nfarms, and very often almost continuously during that long period of\r\ntime upon the farms in one parish. All their relations have been, and\r\nstill are, labourers, varied by one here who has become a tinker, or one\r\nthere who keeps a small roadside beerhouse. When this is the case, when\r\na man and all his ancestors for generations have been hewers of wood and\r\ndrawers of water, it naturally follows that the present representative\r\nof the family holds strongly to the traditions, the instincts, acquired\r\nduring the slow process of time. What those instincts are will be better\r\ngathered from a faithful picture of his daily life.\r\n\r\nMost of the agricultural labourers are born in a thatched cottage by the\r\nroadside, or in some narrow lane. This cottage is usually an\r\nencroachment. In the olden time, when land was cheap, and the\r\ncompetition for it dull, there were many strips and scraps which were\r\nnever taken any notice of, and of which at this hour no record exists\r\neither in the parochial papers or the Imperial archives. Probably this\r\narose from the character of the country in the past, when the greater\r\npart was open, or, as it was called, champaign land, without hedge, or\r\nditch, or landmark. Near towns a certain portion was enclosed generally\r\nby the great landowners, or for the use of the tradesmen. There was also\r\na large enclosure called the common land, on which all burgesses or\r\ncitizens had a right to feed so many cattle, sheep, or horses. As a rule\r\nthe common land was not enclosed by hedges in fields, though instances\r\ndo occur in which it was. There were very few towns in the reign of\r\nCharles II. that had not got their commons attached to them; but outside\r\nand beyond these patches of cultivation round the towns the country was\r\nopen, unenclosed, and the boundaries ill-defined. The king's highway ran\r\nfrom one point to another, but its course was very wide. Roads were not\r\nthen macadamised and strictly confined to one line. The want of\r\nmetalling, and the consequent fearful ruts and sloughs, drove vehicles\r\nand travellers further and further from what was the original line,\r\ntill they formed a track perhaps a score or two of yards wide. When\r\nfields became more generally enclosed it was still only in patches, and\r\nthese strips and spaces of green sward were left utterly uncared for and\r\nunnoticed. These were encamped upon by the gipsies and travelling folk,\r\nand their unmolested occupation no doubt suggested to the agricultural\r\nlabourer that he might raise a cottage upon such places, or cultivate it\r\nfor his garden.\r\n\r\nI know of one spot at this present moment which was enclosed by an\r\nagricultural labourer fully sixty years ago. It is an oval piece of\r\nground of considerable size, situated almost exactly in the centre of a\r\nvery valuable estate. He and his descendants continued to crop this\r\ngarden of theirs entirely unmolested for the whole of that time, paying\r\nno rent whatever. It soon, however, became necessary to enlarge the size\r\nof the fields, which were small, in order to meet the requirements of\r\nthe modern style of agriculture. This oval piece was surrounded by\r\nhedges of enormous growth, and the cultivator was requested to remove to\r\nanother piece more out of the way. He refused to do so, and when the\r\nproprietors of the surrounding estate came to inquire into the\r\ncircumstances they found that they could do nothing. He had enjoyed\r\nundisturbed possession for sixty years; he had paid no rent--no quit\r\nrent or manor dues of any kind. But still further, when they came to\r\nexamine the maps and old documents, no mention whatever appeared of this\r\nparticular patch of ground. It was utterly unnoticed; it was not\r\nrecorded as any man's property. The labourer therefore retained\r\npossession. This was an extraordinary case, because the encroachment\r\ntook place in the middle of a cultivated estate, where one would have\r\nthought the tenants would have seen to it.\r\n\r\nCommonly the squatters pitched on a piece of land--a long unused\r\nstrip--running parallel to the highway or lane. This was no one's\r\nproperty; it was the property of the nation, which had no immediate\r\nrepresentative to look after its interests. The surrounding farmers did\r\nnot care to interfere; it was no business of theirs. The highway board,\r\nunless the instance was very glaring, and some actual obstruction of the\r\nroad was caused, winked at the trespass. Most of them were farmers, and\r\ndid not wish to interfere with a poor man, who they knew had no other\r\nway of getting a house of his own. By-and-by, when the cottage was\r\nbuilt, the labourer was summoned to the court-leet of the manor, and was\r\nassessed in quit rent, a mere nominal sum, perhaps fourpence or a\r\nshilling a year. He had no objection to this, because it gave him a\r\ntitle. As long as the quit rent was duly paid, and he could produce the\r\nreceipt, he was safe in the occupation of his cottage, and no one could\r\nturn him out. To be assessed by the court-leet in fact established his\r\ntitle. Some of these court-leets or manor courts are only held at\r\nintervals of three years, or even more, and are generally composed of\r\nfarmers, presided over by the legal agent of the lord of the manor. The\r\ntenants of the manor attend to pay their quit rent for the preceding\r\nyears, and it often happens that if the cottager has been ill, or is\r\nweak and infirm, the farmers composing the court subscribe and pay the\r\nquit rent for him.\r\n\r\nThe first step when a labourer intends to become a squatter is to\r\nenclose the strip of land which he has chosen. This he does by raising a\r\nlow bank of earth round it, on which he plants elder bushes, as that\r\nshrub grows quickest, and in the course of two seasons will form a\r\nrespectable fence. Then he makes a small sparred gate which he can\r\nfasten with a padlock, and the garden is complete. To build the cottage\r\nis quite another matter. That is an affair of the greatest importance,\r\nrequiring some months of thought and preparation. The first thing is to\r\nget the materials. If it is a clay country, of course bricks must be\r\nchosen; but in stone countries there are often quarries on the farm on\r\nwhich he works. His employer will let him have a considerable quantity\r\nof stone for nothing, and the rest at a nominal charge, and will lend\r\nhim a horse and cart at a leisure season; so that in a very short time\r\nhe can transport enough stone for his purpose. If he has no such friend,\r\nthere is almost sure to be in every parish a labouring man who keeps a\r\nwretched horse or two, fed on the grass by the roadside, and gains his\r\nliving by hauling. Our architect engages this man at a low price to haul\r\nhis materials for him. The lime to make mortar he must buy. In the\r\nparish there is nearly sure to be at least one native mason, who works\r\nfor the farmers, putting up pig-styes, mending walls, and doing small\r\njobs of that kind. This is the builder who engages to come on Saturday\r\nafternoons or in the evenings, while the would-be householder himself is\r\nthe hod-bearer and mixes the mortar. Nine times out of ten the site for\r\nthe cottage is chosen so as to have a ditch at the back. This ditch acts\r\nat once as the cesspool and the sewer, and, unless it happens to have a\r\ngood fall, speedily becomes a nuisance to the neighbourhood. A certain\r\nquantity of wood is of course required in building even this humble\r\nedifice. This is either given by the farmers or is purchased at a\r\nnominal rate.\r\n\r\nThe ground plan is extremely simple. It consists of two rooms, oblong,\r\nand generally of the same size--one to live in, the other to sleep\r\nin--for the great majority of the squatters' hovels have no upstair\r\nrooms. At one end there is a small shed for odds and ends. This shed\r\nused to be built with an oven, but now scarcely any labourers bake their\r\nown bread, but buy of the baker. The walls of the cottage having been\r\ncarried up some six feet, or six feet six--just a little higher than a\r\nman's head--the next process is to construct the roof, which is a very\r\nsimple process. The roof is then thatched, sometimes with flags cut from\r\nthe brooks, but more usually with straw, and practically the cottage is\r\nnow built, for there are no indoor fittings to speak of. The chimney is\r\nplaced at the end of the room set apart for day use. There is no\r\nceiling, nothing between the floor and the thatch and rafters, except\r\nperhaps at one end, where there is a kind of loft. The floor consists\r\nsimply of the earth itself rammed down hard, or sometimes of rough\r\npitching-stones, with large interstices between them. The furniture of\r\nthis room is of the simplest description. A few chairs, a deal table,\r\nthree or four shelves, and a cupboard, with a box or two in the corners,\r\nconstitute the whole. The domestic utensils are equally few, and\r\nstrictly utilitarian. A great pot, a kettle, a saucepan, a few plates,\r\ndishes and knives, half-a-dozen spoons, and that is about all. But on\r\nthe mantelpiece there is nearly sure to be a few ornaments in crockery,\r\nbought from some itinerant trader. The walls are whitewashed. The\r\nbedroom is plainly and rudely furnished. Some cottages do not even\r\nattain to this degree of comfort. They consist of four posts set in the\r\nground which support the cross-beam and the roof, and the walls are made\r\nof wattle and daub, _i.e._, of small split willow sticks, put upright\r\nand daubed over with coarse plaster. The roofs of these cottages are\r\noften half hidden with rank grass, moss, and sillgreen, a vegetation\r\nperhaps encouraged by the drippings from a tree overhanging the roof;\r\nand the situation of the cottage is itself in many cases low and damp.\r\n\r\nBut there is a class of squatters, who possess habitations more fit for\r\nhuman beings. These were originally built by men who had saved a little\r\nmoney, had showed, perhaps, a certain talent for hedge carpentering or\r\nthatching, become tinkers, or even blacksmiths. In such capacities a man\r\nmay save a little money--not much, perhaps L30 or L40 at furthest. With\r\nthe aid of this he manages to build a very tidy cottage, in the face of\r\nthe statement made by architects and builders that a good cottage cannot\r\nbe erected under L120. Their dwellings do not, indeed, compete with the\r\nneat, prim, and business-like work of the professional builder; but\r\nstill they are roomy and substantial cottages. The secret of cheapness\r\nlies in the fact that they work themselves at the erection, and do not\r\nentrust some one else with a contract. Moreover, they make shifts and\r\nput up with drawbacks as no business-man could possibly do. The\r\nmaterials they purchase are cheap and of second-class condition, but\r\ngood enough to hold together and to last some time. Their rude beams and\r\nrafters would not satisfy the eye of a landed proprietor, but they hold\r\nup the roof-tree equally well. Every pound they spend goes its full\r\nlength, and not a penny is wasted. After a while a substantial-looking\r\ncottage rises up, whitewashed and thatched. It has an upper storey with\r\ntwo rooms, and two, at least, downstairs, with the inevitable lean-to or\r\nshed, without which no labourer's cottage is complete. This is more like\r\na house, the residence of a man, than that of the poorer squatter. The\r\nfloor is composed of flag-stones, in this case always carefully washed\r\nand holystoned. There are the same chairs and deal table as in the\r\npoorer cottage, but there are many more domestic utensils, and the\r\nchimney-piece is ornamented with more crockery figures. A few coarse\r\nprints hang against the walls. Some of these old prints are great\r\ncuriosities in their way--hardly valuable enough for a collection, but\r\nvery amusing. A favourite set of prints is the ride of Dick Turpin to\r\nYork on Black Bess, representing every scene in that famous gallop. The\r\nupstair rooms are better furnished, and the beds often really good.\r\n\r\nSome of these cottages in summer-time really approach something of that\r\nArcadian beauty which is supposed to prevail in the country. Everything,\r\nof course, depends upon the character of the inmates. The dull tint of\r\nthe thatch is relieved here and there by great patches of sillgreen,\r\nwhich is religiously preserved as a good herb, though the exact ailments\r\nfor which it is \"good\" are often forgotten. One end of the cottage is\r\noften completely hidden with ivy, and woodbine grows in thickest\r\nprofusion over the porch. Near the door there are almost always a few\r\ncabbage-rose trees, and under the windows grow wall-flowers and\r\nhollyhocks, sweet peas, columbine, and sometimes the graceful lilies of\r\nthe valley. The garden stretches in a long strip from the door, one\r\nmass of green. It is enclosed by thick hedges, over which the dog-rose\r\ngrows, and the wild convolvulus will blossom in the autumn. Trees fill\r\nup every available space and corner--apple trees, pear trees, damsons,\r\nplums, bullaces--all varieties. The cottagers seem to like to have at\r\nleast one tree of every sort. These trees look very nice in the spring\r\nwhen the apple blossom is out, and again in the autumn when the fruit is\r\nripe. Under the trees are gooseberry bushes, raspberries, and numbers of\r\ncurrants. The patches are divided into strips producing potatoes,\r\ncabbage, lettuce, onions, radishes, parsnips; in this kitchen produce,\r\nas with the fruit, they like to possess a few of all kinds. There is\r\ngenerally a great bunch of rhubarb. In odd corners there are sure to be\r\na few specimens of southernwood, mugwort, and other herbs; not for use,\r\nbut from adherence to the old customs. The \"old people\" thought much of\r\nthese \"yherbs,\" so they must have some too, as well as a little mint and\r\nsimilar potherbs. In the windows you may see two or three geraniums, and\r\nover the porch a wicker cage, in which the \"ousel cock, with\r\norange-tawny bill,\" pours out his rich melodious notes. There is hardly\r\na cottage without its captive bird, or tame rabbit, or mongrel cur,\r\nwhich seems as much attached to his master as more high-bred dogs to\r\ntheir owners.\r\n\r\nThese better cottages are extremely pleasing to look upon. There is an\r\nold English, homely look about them. I know a man now whose cottage is\r\nornamented much in the way I have described, a man of sixty, who can\r\nneither read nor write, and is rude and uncouth in speech, yet\r\neverything about him seems pleasant and happy. To my eye the thatch and\r\ngables, and picturesque irregularity of this class of cottages, are more\r\npleasing than the modern glaring red brick and prim slate of dwellings\r\nbuilt to order, where everything is cut with a precise uniformity. If a\r\nman can be encouraged to build his own house, depend upon it it is\r\nbetter for him and his neighbours than that he should live in one which\r\nis not his own. The sense of ownership engenders a pride in the place,\r\nand all his better feelings are called into play. Some of these\r\ncottagers, living in such houses as these, are the very best labourers\r\nto be had. They stay on one farm a lifetime, and never leave it--an\r\ninvaluable aid to a farmer. They frequently possess some little special\r\nknowledge of carpentering or blacksmith's work, which renders them\r\nextremely useful, and at the same time increases their earnings. These\r\nmen are the real true peasantry, quiet and peaceful, yet strong and\r\ncourageous. These are the class that should be encouraged by every\r\npossible means; a man who keeps his little habitation in the state I\r\nhave described, who ornaments it within, and fills his garden with fruit\r\nand flowers, though he may be totally unable to read or to speak\r\ncorrectly, is nevertheless a good and useful citizen, and an addition to\r\nthe stability of the State.\r\n\r\nThough these cottages are worth the smallest sums comparatively, it is\r\ninteresting to note with what pride and satisfaction the possessors\r\ncontemplate leaving them to their children. Of course this very feeling,\r\nwhere there are quarrelsome relations, often leads to bickerings and\r\nstrife. It is astonishing with what tenacity a man who thinks he has a\r\nclaim to a part of such a small estate will cling to his cause, and will\r\nnot hesitate to spend to maintain his claim all his little earnings on\r\nthe third-class lawyers whom the agricultural poor mostly patronise.\r\nEven after every shadow of legal chance is gone, he still loudly\r\ndeclares his right; and there is more squabbling about the inheritance\r\nof these places than over the succession to great domains.\r\n\r\nAnother class of labourers' cottages is found chiefly in the villages.\r\nThese were not originally erected for the purpose to which they are now\r\napplied; they were farmhouses in the days when small farms were the\r\nrule, or they were built for tradesmen who have long since departed.\r\nThese buildings are divided into two, three, or more habitations, each\r\nwith its family; and many makeshifts have to be resorted to to render\r\nthem decent and comfortable. This class of cottage is to be avoided if\r\npossible, because the close and forced intercourse which must take place\r\nbetween the families generally leads to quarrels. Perhaps there is one\r\npump for the entire building, and one wants to use it just at the moment\r\nthat another requires water; or there is only one gateway to the court,\r\nand the passage is obstructed by the wheelbarrow of the other party. It\r\nis from these places that the greater part of the malcontents go up to\r\nthe magistrates in petty sessions. It is rare, indeed, that the cottager\r\nliving more or less isolated by the side of the road appears in a court\r\nof law. Of course, in these villages there are cottages which have been\r\nbuilt expressly for the use of labouring men, and these, like those in\r\nthe open country, may be divided into three classes--the hovel, the\r\ncottage proper, and the model modern cottage.\r\n\r\nIn the villages there is almost sure to be one or more cottages which\r\ncarries one's idea of Lilliputian dwellings to the extreme. These are\r\ngenerally sheds or outhouses which have been converted into cottages. I\r\nentered one not long since which consisted of two rooms, one above and\r\none below, and each of these rooms could not have measured, at a guess,\r\nmore than six feet six across. I had heard of this place, and expected\r\nto find it a perfect den of misery and wretchedness. No such thing. To\r\nmy surprise the woman who opened the door was neatly clad, clean, and\r\nbright. The floor of the cottage was of ordinary flag-stones, but there\r\nwas a ceiling whitewashed and clean. A good fire was burning in the\r\ngrate--it was the middle of winter--and the room felt warm and\r\ncomfortable. The walls were completely covered with engravings from the\r\n_Illustrated London News_. The furniture was equal to the furniture of\r\nthe best cottages, and everything was extremely clean. The woman said\r\nthey were quite comfortable; and although they could have had a larger\r\ncottage many times since, they never wished to change, as they had no\r\nchildren. That of course made a great difference. I never should have\r\nthought it possible for two human beings to have existed, much less been\r\ncomfortable, in such a diminutive place. Another cottage I know contains\r\nbut one room altogether, which is about eight feet square; it is\r\ninhabited by a solitary old woman, and looks like a toy-house. One or\r\ntwo such places as these may be found in most villages, but it does not\r\nby any means follow that because they are small the inhabitants are\r\nbadly off. The condition they are found in depends entirely upon the\r\ndisposition of the inmates. If they are slatternly and dirty, the\r\nlargest cottages would not improve them.\r\n\r\nIn some rural villages a great many cottages may be observed sadly out\r\nof repair--the thatch coming off and in holes, the windows broken, and\r\nother signs of dilapidation. This is usually set down to the landlord's\r\nfault, but if the circumstances are inquired into, it will often be\r\nfound that the fault lies with the inmates themselves. These cottages\r\nare let to labourers at a merely nominal rent, and with them a large\r\npiece of allotment ground. But although they thus get a house and garden\r\nalmost free, they refuse to do the slightest or simplest repairs. If the\r\nwindow gets broken--\"Oh, let it stop; the landlord can do that.\" If a\r\npiece of thatch comes off--\"Oh, 'tisn't my house; let the landlord do it\r\nup.\" So it goes on till the cottage is ready to tumble to pieces. What\r\nis the landlord to do? In his heart he would like to raze the whole\r\nvillage to the ground and rebuild it afresh. But there are not many who\r\ncan afford such an expense. Then, if it were done, the old women and old\r\nmen, and infirm persons who find a home in these places, would be driven\r\nforth. If the landlord puts up two hundred new cottages, he finds it\r\nabsolutely necessary to get some kind of return for the capital\r\ninvested. He does not want more than two and a half per cent.; but to\r\nask that means a rise of perhaps a shilling a week. That is enough; the\r\nlabourer seeks another tumbledown place where he can live for tenpence a\r\nweek, and the poor and infirm have to go to the workhouse. So, rather\r\nthan be annoyed with the endless complaints and troubles, to say nothing\r\nof the inevitable loss of money, the landlord allows things to go on as\r\nthey are.\r\n\r\nAmong our English cottages in out-of-the-way places may be found curious\r\nmaterials for the study of character in humble life. In one cottage you\r\nmay find an upright, stern-featured man, a great student of the Bible,\r\nand fond of using its language whenever opportunity offers, who is the\r\nrepresentative of the old Puritan, though the denomination to which he\r\nmay belong is technically known as the Methodist. He is stern, hard,\r\nuncompromising--one who sets duty above affection. His children are not\r\nspoiled because the rod is spared. He stands aloof from his fellows, and\r\nis never seen at the cottage alehouse, or lingering in groups at the\r\ncross-roads. He is certain to be at the \"anniversary,\" _i.e._, the\r\ncommemoration of the foundation of the Methodist chapel of the parish.\r\nThe very next cottage may contain the antithesis of this man. This is a\r\ngenius in his way. He has some idea of art, as you may gather from the\r\nfanciful patches into which his garden is divided. He has a considerable\r\ntalent for construction, and though he has never been an apprentice he\r\ncan do something towards mending a cart or a door. He makes stands with\r\nwires to put flowers in for the farmers' parlours, and strings the dry\r\noak-apples on wire, which he twists into baskets, to hold\r\nknicknackeries. He is witty, and has his jest for everybody. He can do\r\nsomething of everything--turn his hand any way--a perfect treasure on\r\nthe farm. In the old days there was another character in most villages;\r\nthis was the rhymer. He was commonly the fiddler too, and sang his own\r\nverses to tunes played by himself. Since the printing-press has come in,\r\nand flooded the country with cheap literature, this character has\r\ndisappeared, though many of the verses these men made still linger in\r\nthe countryside.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary adult farm labourer commonly rises at from four to five\r\no'clock; if he is a milker, and has to walk some little distance to his\r\nwork, even as early as half-past three. Four was the general rule, but\r\nof late years the hour has grown later. He milks till five or half-past,\r\ncarries the yokes to the dairy, and draws water for the dairymaid, or\r\nperhaps chops up some wood for her fire to scald the milk. At six he\r\ngoes to breakfast, which consists of a hunch of bread and cheese as the\r\nrule, with now and then a piece of bacon, and as a milker he receives\r\nhis quart of beer. At breakfast there is no hurry for half-an-hour or\r\nso; but some time before seven he is on at the ordinary work of the day.\r\nIf a milker and very early riser, he is not usually put at the heavy\r\njobs, but allowances are made for the work he has already done. The\r\nother men on the farm arrive at six. At eleven, or half-past, comes\r\nluncheon, which lasts a full hour, often an hour and a quarter. About\r\nthree o'clock the task of milking again commences; the buckets are got\r\nout with a good deal of rattling and noise, the yokes fitted to the\r\nshoulders, and away he goes for an hour or hour and a half of milking.\r\nThat done, he has to clean up the court and help the dairymaid put the\r\nheavier articles in place; then another quart of beer, and away home.\r\nThe time of leaving off work varies from half-past five to half-past\r\nsix. At ordinary seasons the other men leave at six, but in haymaking or\r\nharvest time they are expected to remain till the job in hand that day\r\nis finished, often till eight or half-past. This is compensated for by a\r\nhearty supper and almost unlimited beer. The women employed in field\r\nlabour generally leave at four, and hasten home to prepare the evening\r\nmeal. The evening meal is the great event of the day. Like the\r\nindependent gentleman in this one thing, the labourer dines late in the\r\nday. His midday meal, which is the farmer's dinner, is his luncheon. The\r\nlabourer's dinner is taken at half-past six to seven in the evening,\r\nafter he has got home, unlaced his heavy and cumbrous boots, combed his\r\nhair, and washed himself. His table is always well supplied with\r\nvegetables, potatoes, and particularly greens, of which he is peculiarly\r\nfond. The staple dish is, of course, a piece of bacon, and large\r\nquantities of bread are eaten. It is a common thing now, once or twice\r\nin the week, for a labourer to have a small joint of mutton, not a\r\nprime joint, of course, but still good and wholesome meat. Many of them\r\nlive in a style, so far as eating and drinking is concerned, quite equal\r\nto the small farmers, and far superior to what these small farmers were\r\nused to. Instead of beer, the agricultural labourer frequently drinks\r\ntea with his dinner--weak tea in large quantities. After the more solid\r\nparts comes a salad of onions or lettuce. These men eat quantities which\r\nwould half kill many townspeople. After dinner, if it is the season of\r\nthe year, they go out to the allotment and do a little work for\r\nthemselves, and then, unless the alehouse offers irresistible\r\nattractions, to bed. The genuine agricultural labourer goes early to\r\nbed. It is necessary for him, after the long toil of the day, on account\r\nof the hour at which he has to rise in the morning.\r\n\r\nMen employed on arable farms, as carters, for instance, have to rise\r\neven earlier than dairymen. They often begin to bait their horses at\r\nhalf-past three, or rather they used to. This operation of baiting is a\r\nmost serious and important one to the carter. On it depends the\r\nappearance of his team--with him a matter of honest and laudable\r\nambition. If he wishes his horses to look fat and well, with smooth\r\nshiny coats, he must take the greatest care with their food, not to give\r\nthem too much or too little, and to vary it properly. He must begin\r\nfeeding a long time before his horses start to plough. It is, therefore,\r\nan object with him to get to rest early. In the winter time especially\r\nthe labouring poor go to bed very soon, to save the expense of candles.\r\n\r\nBy the bye, the cottagers have a curious habit, which deserves to be\r\nrecorded even for its singularity. When the good woman of the cottage\r\ngoes out for half-an-hour to fetch a pail of water, or to gossip with a\r\nneighbour, she always leaves the door-key in the keyhole _outside_. The\r\nhouse is, in fact, at the mercy of any one who chooses to turn the key\r\nand enter. This practice of locking the door and leaving the key in it\r\nis very prevalent. The presence of the key is to intimate that the\r\ninmate has gone out, but will shortly return; and it is so understood by\r\nthe neighbours. If a cottager goes out for the day, he or she locks the\r\ndoor, and takes the key with them; but if the key is left in the door,\r\nit is a sign that the cottager will be back in ten minutes or so.\r\n\r\nThe alehouse is the terrible bane of the labourer. If he can keep clear\r\nof that, he is clean, tidy, and respectable; but if he once falls into\r\ndrinking habits, good-bye to all hopes of his rising in his occupation.\r\nWhere he is born there will he remain, and his children after him.\r\n\r\nSome of the cottagers who show a little talent for music combine under\r\nthe leadership of the parish clerk and the patronage of the clergyman,\r\nand form a small brass band which parades the village at the head of the\r\nOddfellows or other benefit club once a year. In the early summer,\r\nbefore the earnest work of harvest begins, and while the evenings begin\r\nto grow long, it is not unusual to see a number of the younger men at\r\nplay at cricket in the meadow with the more active of the farmers. Most\r\npopulous villages have their cricket club, which even the richest\r\nfarmers do not disdain to join, and their sons stand at the wicket.\r\n\r\nThe summer is the labourer's good season. Then he can make money and\r\nenjoy himself. In the summer three or four men will often join together\r\nand leave their native parish for a ramble. They walk off perhaps some\r\nforty or fifty miles, take a job of mowing or harvesting, and after a\r\nchange of scenery and associates, return in the later part of the\r\nautumn, full of the things they have seen, and eager to relate them to\r\nthe groups at the cross-roads or the alehouse. The winter is under the\r\nbest circumstances a hard time for the labourer. It is not altogether\r\nthat coals are dear and firewood growing scarcer year by year, but every\r\ncondition of his daily life has a harshness about it. In the summer the\r\nwarm sunshine cast a glamour over the rude walls, the decaying thatch,\r\nand the ivy-covered window. The blue smoke rose up curling beside the\r\ntall elm-tree. The hedge parting his garden from the road was green and\r\nthick, the garden itself full of trees, and flowers of more or less\r\nbeauty. Mud floors are not so bad in the summer; holes in the thatch do\r\nnot matter so much; an ill-fitting window-sash gives no concern. But\r\nwith the cold blasts and ceaseless rain of winter all this is changed.\r\nThe hedge next the road is usually only elder, and this, once the\r\nleaves are off, is the thinnest, most miserable of shelters. The rain\r\ncomes through the hole in the thatch (we are speaking of the large class\r\nof poor cottages), the mud floor is damp, and perhaps sticky. If the\r\nfloor is of uneven stones, these grow damp and slimy. The cold wind\r\ncomes through the ill-fitting sash, and drives with terrible force under\r\nthe door. Very often the floor is one step lower than the ground\r\noutside, and consequently there is a constant tendency in rainy weather\r\nfor the water to run or soak in. The elm-tree overhead, that appeared so\r\npicturesque in summer, is now a curse, for the great drops fall\r\nperpetually from it upon the thatch and on the pathway in front of the\r\ndoor. In great storms of wind it sways to and fro, causing no little\r\nalarm, and boughs are sometimes blown off it, and fall upon the\r\nroof-tree. The thatch of the cottage is saturated; the plants and\r\ngrasses that almost always grow on it, and the moss, are vividly, rankly\r\ngreen; till all dripping, soaked, overgrown with weeds, the wretched\r\nplace looks not unlike a dunghill. Inside, the draught is only one\r\ndegree better than the smoke. These low chimneys, overshadowed with\r\ntrees, smoke incessantly, and fill the room with smother. To avoid the\r\ndraught, many of the cottages are fitted with wooden screens, which\r\ndivide the room, small enough before, into two parts, the outer of\r\nwhich, towards the door, is a howling wilderness of draught and wet from\r\nunder the door; and the inner part close, stuffy, and dim with smoke\r\ndriven down the chimney by the shifting wind. Here the family are all\r\nhuddled up together close over the embers. Here the cooking is done,\r\nsuch as it is. Here they sit in the dark, or in such light as is\r\nsupplied by the carefully hoarded stock of fuel, till it is time to go\r\nto bed, and that is generally early enough. So rigid is the economy\r\npractised in many of these cottages that a candle is rarely if ever\r\nused. The light of the fire suffices, and they find their beds in the\r\ndark. Even when a labourer has risen in the scale, and has some small\r\nproperty, the enforced habits of early life cling to him; and I have\r\nfrequently found men who were really worth some little money sitting at\r\neight o'clock on a dark winter's night without a candle or lamp, their\r\nfeet close to a few dying embers. The older people especially go to bed\r\nearly. Going to some cottages once for a parish paper that had been\r\ncirculated for signature, I rapped at the closed door. This was at\r\nhalf-past seven one evening in November. Again and again I hammered at\r\nthe door; at last an old woman put her head out of window, and the\r\nfollowing colloquy ensued:--\r\n\r\n\"What do 'ee want?\"\r\n\r\n\"The paper; have you signed it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lor, I doan't know. He's on the table--a bin ther ever since a come.\r\nThee's can lift th' latch an' take 'un. _We bin gone to bed this two\r\nhours._\"\r\n\r\nThey must have gone upstairs at half-past five. To rise at five of a\r\nsummer's morning, and see the azure of the sky and the glorious sun, may\r\nbe, perhaps, no great hardship, although there are few persons who could\r\nlong remain poetical on bread and cheese. But to rise at five on a dark\r\nwinter's morning is a very different affair. To put on coarse nailed\r\nboots, weighing fully seven pounds, gaiters up above the knee, a short\r\ngreatcoat of some heavy material, and to step out into the driving rain\r\nand trudge wearily over field after field of wet grass, with the\r\nfurrows full of water; then to sit on a three-legged stool, with mud and\r\nmanure half-way up the ankles, and milk cows with one's head leaning\r\nagainst their damp, smoking hides for two hours, with the rain coming\r\nsteadily drip, drip, drip--this is a very different affair.\r\n\r\nThe \"fogger\" on a snowy morning in the winter has to encounter about the\r\nmost unpleasant circumstances imaginable. Icicles hang from the eaves of\r\nthe rick, and its thatch is covered with snow. Up the slippery ladder in\r\nthe dark morning, one knee out upon the snow-covered thatch, he plunges\r\nthe broad hay-knife in and cuts away an enormous truss--then a great\r\nprong is stuck into this, a prong made on purpose, with extra thick and\r\npowerful handle, and the truss, well bound round with a horse-hair rope,\r\nis hoisted on the head and shoulders. This heavy weight the fogger has\r\nto carry perhaps half-a-mile through the snow; the furrows in the field\r\nare frozen over, but his weight crashes through the ice, slush into the\r\nchilly water. Rain, snow, or bitter frost, or still more bitter east\r\nwinds--\"harsh winds,\" as he most truly calls them--the fogger must take\r\nno heed of either, for the cows must be fed.\r\n\r\nA quart of threepenny ale for breakfast, with a hunch of bread and\r\ncheese, then out to work again in the weather, let it be what it may.\r\nThe cowyards have to be cleaned out--if not done before breakfast--the\r\nmanure thrown up into heaps, and the heaps wheeled outside. Or, perhaps,\r\nthe master has given him a job of piece-work to fill up the middle of\r\nthe day with--a hedge to cut and ditch. This means more slush, wet,\r\ncold, and discomfort. About six or half-past he reaches home, thoroughly\r\nsaturated, worn-out, cross, and \"dummel.\" I don't know how to spell that\r\nword, nor what its etymology may be, but it well expresses the dumb,\r\nsullen churlishness which such a life as this engenders. For all the\r\nconditions and circumstances of such a life tend to one end only--the\r\nblunting of all the finer feelings, the total erasure of sensitiveness.\r\nThe coarse, half-cooked cabbage, the small bit of fat and rafty bacon,\r\nthe dry bread and pint of weak tea, makes no very hearty supper after\r\nsuch a day as this. The man grows insensible to the weather, so cold and\r\ndamp; his bodily frame becomes crusted over, case-hardened; and with\r\nthis indifference there rises up at the same time a corresponding\r\ndulness as regards all moral and social matters.\r\n\r\nGenerally the best conditions of cottage life are to be found wherever\r\nthere are, say, three or four great, tall, strong, unmarried sons\r\nlodging in the house with their aged parents. Each of these pays a small\r\nsum weekly for his lodging, and often an additional sum for the bare\r\nnecessaries of life. In the aggregate this mounts up to a considerable\r\nsum, and whatever is bought is equally shared by the parents. They live\r\nexceedingly well. Such young men as these earn good wages, and now and\r\nthen make extra time, and come home with a pocketful of money. Even\r\nafter the inevitable alehouse has claimed its share, there still remains\r\nenough to purchase fresh meat for supper; and it is not at all unusual\r\nin such cottages to find the whole family supping at seven (it is, in\r\nfact, dining) on a fairly good joint of mutton, with every species of\r\ncommon vegetables. In one case that was brought under my notice three\r\nbrothers lived with their aged mother. They were all strong,\r\nhard-working men, and tolerably steady. In that cottage there were no\r\nless than four separate barrels of beer, and all on tap. Four barrels in\r\none cottage seems an extraordinary thing, yet it resolved itself very\r\nsimply. The cottage was the mother's; they gave her so much for lodging,\r\nand she had her own barrel of beer, so that there should be no dispute.\r\nThe three brothers were mowers--mowers drink enormous quantities of\r\nliquor--and with the same view to prevent dispute each had his own\r\nespecial barrel. Families like this live fairly well, and have many\r\nlittle comforts. Still, at the best, in winter it is a rough and\r\nuncomfortable existence.\r\n\r\nIn the life of the English agricultural labourers there is absolutely no\r\npoetry, no colour. Even their marriages--times when if ever in life\r\npoetry will manifest itself--are sober, dull, tame, clumsy, and\r\ncolourless. I say sober in the sense of tint, for to get drunk appears\r\nto be the one social pleasure of the marriage-day. They, of course, walk\r\nto church; but then that walk usually leads across fields full of all\r\nthe beauties of the spring or the summer. There is nothing in the walk\r\nitself to flatten down the occasion. But the procession is so dull--so\r\nutterly ungenial--a stranger might pass it without guessing that a\r\nwedding was toward. Except a few rude jests; except that there is an\r\nattempt to walk arm-in-arm (it is only an attempt, for they forget to\r\nallow for each other's motions); except the Sunday dresses, utterly\r\ndevoid of taste, what is there to distinguish this day from the rest?\r\nThere is the drunken carousal, it is true, all the afternoon and\r\nevening. There are no fete days in the foreign sense in the English\r\nlabourer's life. There are the fairs and feasts, and a fair is the most\r\nmelancholy of sights. Showmen's vans, with pictures outside of unknown\r\nmonsters; merry-go-rounds, nut stalls, gingerbread stalls, cheap Jacks,\r\nand latterly photographic \"studios\"; behind all these the alehouse; the\r\nbeating of drums and the squalling of pigs, the blowing of horns, and\r\nthe neighing of horses trotted out for show, the roar of a rude\r\ncrowd--these constitute a country fair. There is no colour--nothing\r\nflowery or poetical about this festival of the labourer.\r\n\r\nThe village feasts are still less interesting. Here and there the\r\nclergyman of the parish has succeeded in turning what was a rude\r\nsaturnalia into a decorous \"fete,\" with tea in a tent. But generally the\r\nfeasts are falling into rapid disuse, and would perhaps have died away\r\naltogether had not the benefit societies often chosen that day for their\r\nannual club-dinner. A village feast consists of two or three gipsies\r\nlocated on the greensward by the side of the road, and displaying\r\nginger-beer, nuts, and toys for sale; an Aunt Sally; and, if the village\r\nis a large one, the day may be honoured by the presence of what is\r\ncalled a rifle-gallery; the \"feast\" really and truly does not exist.\r\nSome two or three of the old-fashioned farmers have the traditional\r\nroast beef and plum-pudding on that day, and invite a few friends; but\r\nthis custom is passing away. In what the agricultural labourer's feast\r\nnowadays consists no one can tell. It is an excuse for an extra quart or\r\ntwo of beer, that is all.\r\n\r\nThis dulness is not, perhaps, the fault of the labourer. It may be that\r\nit is the fault of the national character, shown more broadly in the\r\nlower class of the population. Speaking nationally, we have no fete\r\ndays--there is no colour in our mode of life. These English\r\nagricultural labourers have no passion plays, no peasant plays, no\r\nrustic stage and drama, few songs, very little music. The club dinner is\r\nthe real fete of the labourer; he gets plenty to eat and drink for that\r\nday. It is this lack of poetical feeling that makes the English\r\npeasantry so uninteresting a study. They have no appreciation of beauty.\r\nMany of them, it is true, grow quantities of flowers; but barely one in\r\na thousand could arrange those flowers in a bouquet.\r\n\r\nThe alehouse forms no inconsiderable part of the labourer's life. It is\r\nat once his stock exchange, his reading-room, his club, and his assembly\r\nrooms. It is here that his benefit society holds its annual dinner. The\r\nclub meetings take place weekly or monthly in the great room upstairs.\r\nHere he learns the news of the day; the local papers are always to be\r\nfound at the public-house, and if he cannot read himself he hears the\r\nnews from those who can. In the winter he finds heat and light, too\r\noften lacking at home; at all times he finds amusement; and who can\r\nblame him for seizing what little pleasure lies in his way? As a rule\r\nthe beerhouse is the only place of amusement to which he can resort: it\r\nis his theatre, his music-hall, picture-gallery, and Crystal Palace. The\r\nrecent enactments bearing upon the licensed victuallers have been rather\r\nhard upon the agricultural labourer. No doubt they are very excellent\r\nenactments, especially those relating to early closing; but in the\r\nvillages and outlying rural districts, where life is reduced to its most\r\nrude and simple form, many of the restrictions are unjust, and deprive\r\nthe labourer of what he feels to be his legitimate right. Playing at\r\nnine-pins, for instance, is practically forbidden, so also dominoes.\r\nNow, it was a great thing to put down skittle-sharping and cheating at\r\ngambling generally--a good thing to discourage gambling in every\r\nform--but in these thinly-populated outlying agricultural parishes,\r\nwhere money is scarce and wages low, there never existed any temptation\r\nto allure skittle-sharpers and similar cheaters to the spot. The game at\r\nskittles was a legitimate game--a fair and honest struggle of skill and\r\nstrength. Nine times out of ten it was played only for a quart of ale,\r\nto be drunk by the loser as well as the winner in good fellowship. Why\r\ndeprive the man who labours all day in wet and storm of so simple a\r\npleasure in the evening? The conditions are very different to those\r\nexisting in large manufacturing towns, and some modification of the law\r\nought to be made. The agricultural labourer has no cheap theatre at\r\nwhich he can spend an hour, no music-hall, no reading-room; his only\r\nresource is the public-house. Now that he is practically deprived of his\r\nskittles and such games, he has no amusement left except to drink, or\r\nplay at pitch and toss on the quiet, a far worse pastime than skittles.\r\nSkittles, of course, are allowed provided the players play for love\r\nonly; but what public-house keeper cares to put up the necessary\r\narrangements on such terms? The labourer will have his quart in the\r\nevening, and, despite of all \"cry\" to the contrary, I believe it to be\r\nhis right to have that quart; and it is better, if he must have it, that\r\nhis whole thoughts should not be concentrated on the liquor--that he\r\nshould earn it by skill and strength. There is an opprobrium about the\r\npublic-house, and let us grant that it is at least partially\r\ndeserved--but where else is the labourer to go? He cannot for ever work\r\nall day and sit in his narrow cabin in the evening. He cannot always\r\nread, and those of his class who do read do so imperfectly. A\r\nreading-room has been tried, but as a rule it fails to attract the\r\n_purely agricultural labourer_. The shoemaker, the tailor, the village\r\npost-master, grocer, and such people may use it; also a few of the\r\nbetter-educated of the young labourers, the rising generation; but not\r\nthe full-grown labourer with a wife and family and cottage. It does good\r\nundoubtedly; in the future, as education extends, it will become a place\r\nof resort. But at present it fails to reach the adult genuine\r\nagricultural labourer. For a short period in the dead of the winter the\r\nfarmers and gentry get up penny readings in many places, but these are\r\nconfined to at most one evening a week. What, then, is the labourer to\r\ndo? Let any one put himself in his place, try to realise his feelings\r\nand circumstances. At present, till education extends, he must go to the\r\npublic-house. Is he to be punished and deprived of his game of skill\r\nbecause in large towns it bears evil fruit? Surely the law could be\r\nsomewhat modified, and playing permitted under some restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe early closing has been an unalloyed good in these rural districts.\r\nThe labourer is a steady drinker. He does not toss down glasses of stiff\r\nbrandy and whisky. His beer requires time to produce an effect. The last\r\nhour does the mischief. Since the earlier closing the village streets\r\nhave been comparatively free from drunken men. In any case, the\r\nagricultural labourer is the most lamb-like of drunkards. He interferes\r\nwith no one. He unhinges no gates, smashes no windows, does no injury.\r\nHe either staggers home or quietly lies on the grass till the liquor\r\npasses off. He is not a quarrelsome man. He does not fight with\r\nknuckle-dusters or kick with his heavy boots. His fights, when he does\r\nfight, are very harmless affairs. No doubt his drunkenness is an\r\noffence; but it is comparatively innocuous to the general public.\r\n\r\nReligious feeling does not run high among the labourers. A large\r\nproportion of them are Nonconformists--principally Methodists. But this\r\nis not out of any very decided notion as to the difference of ceremony\r\nor theological dogma; it arises out of a class feeling. They say, or\r\nrather they feel, that this is _their_ church. The parish church is the\r\nchurch of the farmers and the gentry. There is no hostility to the\r\nclergyman of the parish, no bitter warfare of sect against sect, or of\r\nMethodist against Churchman. But you see very few of the farmers go to\r\nchapel. The labourer goes there, and finds his own friends--his cousins\r\nand uncles--his wife's relations. He is among his own class. There is no\r\nfeeling of inferiority. The religion taught, the service, the hymns, the\r\npreacher, all are his. He has a sense of proprietorship in them. He\r\nhelps to pay for them. The French peasant replied to the English\r\ntourist, who expressed surprise at the fanatic love of the populace for\r\nthe first Napoleon--\"he was as much a tyrant as King Louis was.\" \"Ah,\r\nbut Napoleon was _our_ king.\" So the labourers feel that this is their\r\nreligion. Therefore it is that so many of them gather together (where\r\nthere are no chapels) in the cottage of some man who takes the lead, and\r\nsit, with doors and windows shut, crammed together to pray and listen to\r\nothers pray. Any of them who wishes can, as it were, ascend the pulpit\r\nhere. This is why in so many parishes the pews of the parish church are\r\ncomparatively empty so far as agricultural labourers are concerned. The\r\nbest of clergymen must fail to fill them under such disadvantages.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult not only for the clergyman, but for others who wish\r\nto improve the condition of the labourer, to reach him. Better cottages\r\nare, of course, a most effectual way, but it is not in the power of\r\nevery one to confer so substantial a benefit. Perhaps one of the best\r\nmeans devised has been that of cottage flower-shows. These are, of\r\ncourse, not confined to flowers; in fact, the principal part of such\r\nshows consists of table vegetables and fruit. By rigidly excluding all\r\ngardeners, and all persons not strictly cottage people, the very best\r\nresults have often been arrived at in this way. For if there is one\r\nthing in which the labourer takes an interest it is his garden and his\r\nallotment. To offer him prizes for the finest productions of his garden\r\ntouches the most sensitive part of his moral organisation. It is\r\nwonderful what an amount of emulation these prizes excite--emulation not\r\nso much for the value of the prize as for the distinction. These\r\ncompetitions tend besides to provide him with a better class of food,\r\nfor he depends largely upon vegetables.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing connected with the condition of the agricultural poor\r\nthat is better worth the attention of improvers than the style of\r\ncookery pursued in these cottages. A more wretched cookery probably does\r\nnot exist on the face of the earth. The soddened cabbage is typical of\r\nthe whole thing. Since higher wages have come in it has become possible\r\nfor the labourer in many cases to provide himself with better food, such\r\nas mutton--the cheap parts--more bacon, pork, and so on; but the women\r\ndo not know how to make the most of it. It is very difficult to lay down\r\na way in which this defect may be remedied; for there is nothing a man,\r\nlet him be never so poor, so deeply resents as an inspection of the\r\ncontents of his pot. He would sooner eat half-raw bacon than have the\r\nteaching forced on him--how to make savoury meals of the simple\r\nprovisions within his reach; nor can he be blamed for this sturdy\r\nindependent feeling. Possibly the establishment of schools of cookery in\r\nvillages might do much good. They might be attached to the new schools\r\nnow building throughout the country. The labourer, from so long living\r\nupon coarse, ill-cooked food, acquires an artificial taste. Some men eat\r\ntheir bacon raw; others will drink large quantities of vinegar, and well\r\nthey may need it to correct by its acidity the effects of strong\r\nunwholesome cabbage. The cottage cook has no idea of those nutritious\r\nand pleasant soups which can be made to form so important a feature in\r\nthe economy of daily life.\r\n\r\nThe labourer is in a lower degree of the same class as the third-rate\r\nworking farmer of the past. He is the old small dairy farmer in a\r\ncoarser shape. With a little less education, ruder manners, with the\r\ninstincts of eating, drinking, and avarice more prominently displayed,\r\nhe presents in his actual condition at this day a striking analogy to\r\nthe agriculturist of a bygone time. In fact, those farmers of twenty or\r\nthirty acres, living in cottage-like homesteads, were barely\r\ndistinguishable as far as _personnel_ went from the labourers among whom\r\nthey lived. This being the case, it is not surprising to find that the\r\nlabourer of this day presents in general characteristics a marked\r\naffinity in ideas and sentiments to those entertained by the old\r\nfarmer. He has the same paternal creed in a more primeval form. He\r\nconsiders his children as his absolute property. He rules them with a\r\nrod of iron, or rather of ground-ash. In fact, the ground-ash stick is\r\nhis social religion. The agricultural labouring poor are very rough and\r\neven brutal towards their children. Not that they are without affection\r\ntowards them, but they are used to thrash them into obedience instead of\r\nleading them into it by the gentle means of moral persuasion.\r\n\r\nBystanders would call the agricultural labourer cruel. Carters, for\r\ninstance, had till lately a habit of knocking the boys under their\r\ncontrol about in a brutal manner. But I do not think that in the mass of\r\ncases it arose from deliberate cruelty, but from a species of stolid\r\nindifference or insensibility to suffering. Somehow they do not seem to\r\nunderstand that others suffer, whether this arises from the rough life\r\nthey lead, the endless battle with the weather, the hard fare--whether\r\nit has grown up out of the circumstances surrounding them. The same\r\nunfeeling brutality often extends to the cattle under their care. In\r\nthis there has been a decided improvement of late years; but it is not\r\nyet extinct.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the lights and shades of the labourer's daily life\r\nimpartially presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_FIELD-FARING WOMEN._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a thoughtful English peasant-woman rejoiced that in her house a son\r\nwas born, it would be, not because \"she had gotten a man from the Lord,\"\r\nbut a thanksgiving that it was not a girl. That most natural\r\nthanksgiving of the Hebrew woman is too rarely heard in the rural\r\ncottage, situated though it may be in the midst of meadows and fields\r\nabounding with the fat of the earth. The fact that a fresh being has\r\nentered upon life, with all its glorious possibilities, is not a subject\r\nfor joy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, John,\" the farmer says to his man, \"your wife has been confined,\r\nhasn't she? How's the young one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw, sir, a' be main weak and picked, an' like _to go back_--thank God!\"\r\nreplies the labourer with intense satisfaction, especially if he has two\r\nor three children already. \"Picked\" means thin, sharp-featured, wasted,\r\nemaciated. \"To go back\" is to die. The man does not like to say \"die,\"\r\ntherefore he puts it \"to go back\"--_i.e._, whence it came; from the\r\nunknown. Yet, with all this hard indifference, the labourer is as fond\r\nof his children as any one else. The \"ego\" that utters those apparently\r\nheartless words is not the real man, it is the \"ego\" produced by long\r\nexperience of the hardships of poverty; of coarse fare, rude labour,\r\nexposure. After all, it is in a spirit of tenderness towards the infant\r\nthat the parent half desires it to die. The real \"ego,\" the true man,\r\ndelights as all humanity does in watching the growth of the tiny limbs,\r\nthe expansion of the instincts into mind, and the first employment of\r\nthat mind. He feels as Marguerite in _Faust_ felt, tending the\r\nbabe--\"the holiest of all joys.\" But life is very, very hard, and\r\ncircumstances push him out of himself. Still more do these hardships\r\ntell upon his wife; and so it is, knowing what her sex have to go\r\nthrough, that she welcomes a boy more than a girl. An aged agricultural\r\nwoman said she would sooner have seven boys than one girl; for the\r\nformer, when they became lads, went out and earned their own living,\r\nbut the girls you never knew when they were got rid of--they were always\r\ncoming back. This expressed the practical view of the matter. But\r\nsupposing that the child should prove a girl; it must not be imagined\r\nthat it receives any ruder treatment in mere infancy than a boy would\r\nhave had. In early infancy children have no sex. But the poor mother has\r\nher trials. Though in the midst of a country teeming with milk, it is\r\noften with the utmost difficulty that she can obtain any for her babe,\r\nif Nature shall have rendered her dependent upon artificial supply. This\r\nhas become especially the case of late years, now that so much milk is\r\nsent to London, instead of being retained in the dairy for the\r\nmanufacture of butter and cheese. So that it actually happens that the\r\npoor mother in the courts of the metropolis can obtain milk easier than\r\nher far-away sister in those fabulous fields which the city woman has\r\nnever seen, and, perhaps, never will. Often in arable districts there\r\nare scarcely any cows kept. No one cares to retail a pennyworth of milk.\r\nIt is only by favour, through the interest taken by some farmer's wife,\r\nthat it can be got.\r\n\r\nVery few agricultural women have a medical man present at their\r\nconfinement; they usually entrust themselves to the care of some village\r\nnurse, who has a reputation for skill in such matters, but no\r\nscientifically acquired knowledge--who proceeds by rule of thumb. The\r\ndoctor--almost always the parish doctor, though sometimes the club\r\nofficer--is not called in till after the delivery. The poor woman will\r\nfrequently come downstairs on the fourth day; and it is to this\r\ndisregard of proper precautions that the distortions of figure and many\r\nof the illnesses of poor agricultural women are attributable. Nothing\r\nbut the severe training they have gone through from childhood\r\nupwards--the exposure to all kinds of weather--the life in the open air,\r\nthe physical strength induced by labour, can enable them to support the\r\nstrain upon the frame caused by so quickly endeavouring to resume their\r\nhousehold duties. It is probably this reserve of strength which enables\r\nthem to recover from so serious a matter so quickly. Certain it is that\r\nvery few die from confinement; and yet, from the point of view of the\r\nmiddle class of society, almost every precaution and every luxury by\r\nthem deemed necessary is omitted. Of course, in some instances,\r\nagricultural women whose husbands have, perhaps, worked for one master\r\nfrom boyhood, receive much more attention than here indicated--wines,\r\njellies, meat, and so on--but the majority have to rely upon the tender\r\nmercies of the parish. It has been often remarked that the labourer, let\r\nhim be in receipt of what wages he will, makes no provision for this,\r\nthe most serious and interesting of all domestic events. Though it can\r\nbe foreseen for months, he does not save a single sovereign. He does not\r\nconsider it in the least shameful to receive parish relief on these\r\noccasions; he leaves his partner entirely to the mercy of strangers, and\r\nwere it not for the clergyman's wife, she would frequently be without\r\nsympathy. There are no matters in which so much practical good is\r\naccomplished by the wives of the rural clergy as in these confinements\r\nof the poor women in their parishes. It is a matter peculiarly within\r\ntheir sphere, and, to their honour be it spoken, one which they carry\r\nout to the utmost of their ability.\r\n\r\nA cottage is at best a wretched place to be ill in. It is a marvel how\r\nmany poor women escape at all, from the close atmosphere of the\r\nlow-pitched holes in which they are confined. It is a wonder that, among\r\nthe many schemes of philanthropy which have attracted attention of late\r\nyears, something has not been done for these poor creatures. Why should\r\nnot every large village or cluster of villages--there are often three or\r\nfour within a mile or two--have their lying-in hospitals, on the cottage\r\nhospital system? Scarcely any parish but has its so-called\r\ncharities--money left by misguided but benevolent persons, for the\r\npurpose of annual distribution in small doles of groats, or loaves, or\r\nblankets. Often there is a piece of land called \"Poor's Mead,\" or some\r\nsimilar name, which has been devised like this, the annual rent from it\r\nto be applied for the poor. As it is, the benefit from these charities\r\nis problematical. If they were combined, and the aggregate funds applied\r\nto maintain a lying-in hospital for the district, a real and efficient\r\ngood would be arrived at. But of all places, villages are neglected. Let\r\nit be drainage, water supply, allotments--anything and everything--the\r\nvillages go on as they may, the fault being the absence of local\r\nauthority. There are plenty of gentlemen ready and willing to take part\r\nin and advance such schemes, but there is no combination. Spontaneous\r\ncombination is uncertain in its operation. If there were some system of\r\nvillage self-government, these wants would be soon supplied. It is true\r\nthat there is the Union Workhouse. A poor woman can go to the workhouse;\r\nbut is it right, is it desirable from any point of view, that decent\r\nwomen should be driven to the workhouse at such times? As a matter of\r\nfact, it is only the unfortunates who have illegitimate children that\r\nuse the workhouse lying-in wards. Such an institution as has been\r\nsuggested would be gladly welcomed by the agricultural poor. Most\r\ncottages have but two bedrooms, some only one; a better class of cottage\r\nis now being gradually erected with three, but even in these the third\r\nis very small. Now, take the case of a labouring man with seven or eight\r\nchildren, and living in a cottage with two bedrooms, and whose wife is\r\nconfined; and let it be remembered that large families are common\r\namongst this class. The wife must certainly have one room to herself and\r\nher attendant. The father, then, and his children must crowd into the\r\nother, or sleep as they can on the ground-floor. In the case of nearly\r\ngrown-up children the overcrowding is a serious matter. The relief\r\nafforded by a lying-in hospital would be immense; and the poor woman\r\nherself would be restored to her family with her health firmly\r\nre-established, whereas now she often lingers in a sickly state for\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIn the soft, warm summer-time, when the midsummer hum of the myriads of\r\ninsects in the air sheds a drowsy harmony over the tree-tops, the\r\nfield-faring woman goes out to haymaking, and leaves her baby in the\r\nshade by the hedge-side. A wooden sheepcage, turned upside down and\r\nfilled with new-made hay, forms not at all a despicable cradle; and here\r\nthe little thing lies on its back and inhales the fresh pure air, and\r\nfeels the warmth of the genial sun, cheered from time to time by visits\r\nfrom its busy mother. Perhaps this is the only true poetry of the\r\nhayfield, so much talked of and praised. The mother works with her rake,\r\nor with a shorter, smaller prong; and if it is a large farm, the women\r\nare kept as much as possible together, for their strength and skill\r\nwill not allow them to work at the same pace as the men, and if they\r\nwork in company the one hinders the other. A man can do the work of two\r\nwomen, and do it better in every way, besides being capable of the\r\nheavier tasks of pitching, cock-making, &c., which the women cannot\r\nmanage. Before the haymaking machines and horse-rakes came into vogue,\r\nit was not uncommon to see as many as twenty women following each other\r\nin _echelon_, turning a \"wallow,\" or shaking up the green swathes left\r\nby the mowers. Farmers were obliged to employ them, but were never\r\nsatisfied with their work, which was the dearest they paid for. Somehow,\r\nthere was no finish to it. Large numbers of women still work in the\r\nhayfield, but they are not used in gangs so much as formerly, but\r\ndistributed about to do light jobs for which a man cannot be spared, and\r\nin these they are useful. The pay used to be tenpence a day; now it is\r\none shilling and a pint of beer per day, and in some places\r\nfifteenpence. The Arcadian innocence of the hayfield, sung by the poets,\r\nis the most barefaced fiction; for those times are the rural saturnalia,\r\nand the broadest and coarsest of jokes and insinuations are freely\r\ncirculated; nor does it always stop at language only, provided the\r\nmaster be out of sight. Matrons and young girls alike come in for an\r\nequal share of this rude treatment, and are quite a match for the men in\r\nthe force of compliment. The women leave work an hour or so before the\r\nmen, except when there is a press, and the farmer is anxious to get in\r\nthe hay before a storm comes. It is not that the hayfield itself\r\noriginates this coarseness but this is almost the only time of the year\r\nwhen the labouring classes work together in large numbers. A great deal\r\nof farm-work is comparatively solitary; in harvest droves of people are\r\ncollected together, and the inherent vulgarity comes out more strongly.\r\nAt the wheat-harvest the women go reaping, and exceedingly hard they\r\nwork at it. There is no harder work done under the sun than reaping, if\r\nit is well followed up. From earliest dawn to latest night they swing\r\nthe sickles, staying with their husbands, and brothers, and friends,\r\ntill the moon silvers the yellow corn. The reason is because reaping is\r\npiece-work, and not paid by the day, so that the longer and the harder\r\nthey work the more money is earned. In this a man's whole family can\r\nassist. His wife, his grown-up sons and daughters cut the corn, the\r\nyounger ones can carry it and aid in various ways.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how the men stand the excessive and continuous labour;\r\nit is still more wonderful how the women endure it, trying as it is to\r\nthe back. It is the hottest season of the year--the early autumn; the\r\nsun burns and scorches, and the warm wind gives no relief; even the\r\nevenings are close and sultry. The heated earth reflects the rays, and\r\nthe straw is dry and warm to the touch. The standing corn, nearly as\r\nhigh as the reaper, keeps off the breeze, if there is any, from her\r\nbrow. Grasping the straw continuously cuts and wounds the hand, and even\r\ngloves will hardly give perfect protection. The woman's bare neck is\r\nturned to the colour of tan; her thin muscular arms bronze right up to\r\nthe shoulder. Short time is allowed for refreshment; right through the\r\nhottest part of the day they labour. It is remarkable that none, or very\r\nfew, cases of sunstroke occur. Cases of vertigo and vomiting are\r\nfrequent, but pass off in a few hours. Large quantities of liquor are\r\ntaken to sustain the frame weakened by perspiration.\r\n\r\nWhen night does arrive, even then the task is not over, for they have to\r\ncarry home on their heads the bundle of wheat gleaned by the smaller\r\nchildren, and perhaps walk two miles to the cottage. This is indeed work\r\nfor a woman still suckling her child. It is not easy to calculate what a\r\nwoman earns at such seasons, because they rarely work on their own\r\naccount: either the father or the husband receives the wages in a lump\r\nwith his own; but it cannot be much less than that earned by a man; for\r\nat these times they work with a will, and they do not at the haymaking.\r\nWhile reaping the baby is nestled down on a heap of coats or shawls\r\nunder the shelter of the shocks of corn, which form a little hut for it,\r\nand, as in the hayfield, is watched by one of the children. Often three\r\nor four women will place their babies close together, and leave one\r\ngreat girl in charge of the whole, which is an economy, releasing other\r\nchildren for work; for the hayfield and the corn-harvest are the\r\nlabourer's gold-mine. There is not so much rough joking in the\r\ncorn-field; they do not work so close together, and the husband or\r\nfather is near at hand; neither is there time nor inclination in the\r\nmidst of such severe labour, to which haymaking is play.\r\n\r\nHarvest-homes are going out of fashion. After one of these feasts there\r\nwas often much that was objectionable; and, wherever possible, farmers\r\nhave abolished them, giving a small sum of money instead; but in places\r\nthe labourers grumble greatly at the change, preferring the bacon and\r\nthe beer, and the unrestrained license. It is noticeable how the women\r\nmust have their tea. If it is far from home, the children collect\r\nsticks, and a fire is made in a corner of the field, and the kettle\r\nboiled; and about four o'clock they take a cup in company--always weak\r\ntea, with a little brown sugar and no milk, and usually small pieces of\r\nbread sopped in it, especially by the elder women. Tea is largely used\r\nby the agricultural labourers, though it does not by any means prevent\r\nthem from indulging in beer. Snuff is not taken by the women half so\r\nmuch as formerly, though some of the old ones are very fond of it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as ever the child is old enough to crawl about, it is sure to\r\nget out into the road and roll in the dust. It is a curious fact that\r\nthe agricultural children, with every advantage of green fields and wide\r\nopen downs, always choose the dusty hard road to play in. They are free\r\nto wander as they list over mead and leaze, and pluck the flowers out of\r\nthe hedges, and idle by the brooks, all the year round, the latter part\r\nof the spring, when the grass is nearly fit for mowing, only excepted.\r\nYet, excepting a few of the elder boys birdnesting, it is the rarest\r\nthing to meet a troop of children in the fields; but there they are in\r\nthe road, the younger ones sprawling in the dust, their naked limbs\r\nkicking it up in clouds, and the bigger boys clambering about in the\r\nhedge-mound bounding the road, making gaps, splashing in the dirty water\r\nof the ditches. Hardy young dogs one and all. Their food is of the\r\nrudest and scantiest, chiefly weak tea, without milk, sweetened with\r\nmoist sugar, and hunches of dry bread, sometimes with a little lard, or,\r\nfor a treat, with treacle. Butter is scarcely ever used in the\r\nagricultural labourer's cottage. It is too dear by far, and if he does\r\nbuy fats, he believes in the fats expressed from meats, and prefers lard\r\nor dripping. Children are frequently fed with bread and cheap sugar\r\nspread on it. This is much cheaper than butter. Sometimes they get a bit\r\nof cheese or bacon, but not often, and a good deal of strong cabbage,\r\nsoddened with pot-liquor. The elder boys get a little beer; the young\r\ngirls none, save perhaps a sip from their mother's pint, in summer. This\r\nis what they have to build up a frame on capable of sustaining heat and\r\ncold, exposure, and a life of endless labour. The boys it seems to suit,\r\nfor they are generally tolerably plump, though always very short for\r\ntheir age. Frequently teams of powerful horses drawing immense loads of\r\nhay or straw may be seen on the highway, in the charge of a boy who does\r\nnot look ten years old judged by the town standard, but who is really\r\nfifteen. These short, broad, stout lads, look able to stand anything,\r\nand in point of fact do stand it, from the kick of a carter's heavy boot\r\nto the long and bitter winter. If it is wished to breed up a race of men\r\nliterally \"hard as nails,\" no better process could be devised; but,\r\nlooked at from a mental and moral point of view, there may be a\r\ndifference of opinion.\r\n\r\nThe girls do not appear to thrive so well upon this dietary. They are as\r\ntall as the boys, taller if anything considering the ages, but thin and\r\nskinny, angular and bony. At seven or eight years old the girl's labour\r\nbegins. Before that she has been set to mind the baby, or watch the pot,\r\nand to scour about the hedges for sticks for the fire. Now she has not\r\nonly to mind the baby, but to nurse it; she carries it about with her in\r\nher arms; and really the infant looks almost as large as herself, and\r\nits weight compels her to lean backwards. She is left at home all day in\r\ncharge of the baby, the younger children, and the cottage. Perhaps a\r\nlittle bread is left for them to eat, but they get nothing more till the\r\nmother returns about half-past four, when, woe be to the girl if the\r\nfire is not lit, and the kettle on. The girl has to fetch the\r\nwater--often a hard and tedious task, for many villages have a most\r\nimperfect supply, and you may see the ditches by the roadside dammed up\r\nto yield a little dirty water. She may have to walk half-a-mile to the\r\nbrook, and then carry the bucket home as best she may, and repeat the\r\noperation till sufficient has been acquired; and when her mother is\r\nwashing, or, still worse, is a washerwoman by profession, this is her\r\nweary trudge all day. Of course there are villages where water is at\r\nhand, and sometimes too much of it. I know a large village where the\r\nbrook runs beside the highway, and you have to pass over a \"drock,\" or\r\nsmall bridge, to get to each of the cottages; but such instances are\r\nrare. The girl has also to walk into the adjacent town and bring back\r\nthe bread, particularly if her mother happens to be receiving parish\r\npay. A little older--at ten or eleven, or twelve--still more skinny and\r\nbony now as a rule, she follows her mother to the fields, and learns to\r\npick up stones from the young mowing grass, and place them in heaps to\r\nbe carted away to mend drinking places for cattle. She learns to beat\r\nclots and spread them with a small prong; she works in the hayfield, and\r\ngleans at the corn-harvest. Gleaning--poetical gleaning--is the most\r\nunpleasant and uncomfortable of labour, tedious, slow, back-aching work;\r\npicking up ear by ear the dropped wheat, searching among the prickly\r\nstubble.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all her labour, and the hardship she has to\r\nendure--coarse fare, and churlish treatment at the hands of those who\r\nshould love her most--the little agricultural girl still retains some of\r\nthat natural inclination towards the pretty and romantic inherent in the\r\nsex. In the spring she makes daisy chains, and winds them round the\r\nbaby's neck; or with the stalks of the dandelion makes a chain several\r\nfeet in length. She plucks great bunches of the beautiful bluebell, and\r\nof the purple orchis of the meadow; gathers heaps of the cowslip, and\r\nafter playing with them a little while, they are left to wither in the\r\ndust by the roadside, while she is sent two or three miles with her\r\nfather's dinner. She chants snatches of rural songs, and sometimes three\r\nor four together, joining hands, dance slowly round and round, singing\r\nslowly rude rhymes describing marriage--and not over decent some of\r\nthese rhymes are. She has no toys--not one in twenty such girls ever\r\nhave a doll; or, if they do, it is but some stick dressed in a rag. Poor\r\nthings! they need no artificial dolls; so soon as ever they can lift\r\nit, they are trusted with the real baby. Her parents probably do not\r\nmean to be unkind, and use makes this treatment bearable, but to an\r\noutsider it seems unnecessarily rough, and even brutal. Her mother\r\nshouts at her in a shrill treble perpetually; her father enforces his\r\norders with a harsh oath and a slap.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of hard circumstances, the endless battle with poverty,\r\nrender men and women both callous to others' feelings, and particularly\r\nstrict to those over whom they possess unlimited authority. But the\r\nlabourer must not be judged too harshly: there is a scale in these\r\nmatters; a proportion as in everything else; an oath from him, and even\r\na slap on the ear, is really the counterpart of the frown and emphasised\r\nwords of a father in a more fortunate class of life; and the children do\r\nnot feel it, or think it exceptionally cruel, as the children of a\r\nricher man would. Undoubtedly, however, it does lessen the bond between\r\nchild and parent. There is little filial affection among these\r\ncottagers--how should there be? The boy is driven away from home as\r\nearly as possible; the girl is made day by day to feel her fault in\r\nbeing a girl; to neither can the poor man give any small present, or any\r\noccasional treat. What love there is lasts longest between the mother\r\nand her daughter. The only way in which a labourer exhibits his\r\naffection is when another labourer in authority, as a carter, ill-treats\r\nhis boy--a too common case--and then he speaks loudly, and very\r\nproperly. But even in most serious matters there is a strange\r\ncallousness. I have known instances in which a father, aware that a\r\ncriminal assault has been attempted by another labourer upon a tender\r\nchild of twelve, has refused to prosecute, and the brutal offender would\r\nhave escaped without the slightest punishment had not the clergyman\r\nheard of the story.\r\n\r\nThe slow years roll by--they are indeed slow in an agricultural\r\nvillage--and the girl, now fifteen, has to go regularly to work in the\r\nfields; that is, if the family be not meantime largely increased. She\r\nhas in this latter case plenty of work at home to assist her mother.\r\nCottagers are not over-clean, but they are not wilfully dirty in their\r\nhouses; and with a large family there is much washing and other domestic\r\nmatters to attend to, which the mother, now fast growing feeble, cannot\r\nget through herself. In harvest the women get up at four or earlier, and\r\ndo their household work before starting for the fields. But, perhaps, by\r\nthis time another girl has grown up sufficiently to nurse baby, mind the\r\nyoung ones, and do slave's work generally. Then the elder daughter goes\r\nto the fields daily when there is work to be had. In arable districts\r\nthe women do much work, picking couch grass--a tedious operation--and\r\nhoeing. They never or rarely milk now. In the dead of winter there is\r\nnothing for women to do. At this age--fifteen or sixteen--the girl\r\nperhaps goes out to service at some farmhouse. If she is fortunate\r\nenough to enter the house of one of the modern class of farmers, it is a\r\nlucky day for her when she begins indoor labour. It is to be feared that\r\nthe life of a girl of this kind in the old time, and not so long ago, in\r\nthe houses of the poorer order of farmers, was a rough one indeed. But\r\nmuch of that is past, never to return, and our business is with the\r\npresent. Where they have a dairy she has to clean the buckets and\r\nmilk-cans and other utensils, to help turn the cheeses, and assist the\r\ndairymaid (a most important personage this last) in all kinds of ways.\r\nThe work is coarse and rude, but it only lasts a portion of the day, and\r\nshe has regular and ample meals. The bacon and cheese soon begin to tell\r\nupon her. The angular bones disappear, the skinny arms grow round, and\r\npresently enormously fat--not much the prettier, perhaps, but far more\r\npleasant to look at. Her face loses the pinched expression; her cheeks\r\nbecome full, and round, and rosy; in every way her physical frame\r\nimproves. It is wonderful what a difference a few months in a good\r\nfarmhouse makes to a girl of this kind. She soon begins to dress better,\r\nnot from her wages, for these are small enough, and may commence as low\r\nas L4; but her mistress gives her many things, and, if she is a good\r\ngirl, buys her a dress now and then; and with the shilling or two she\r\nasks in advance, she purchases cheap ornaments of the pedlar at the\r\ndoor. Her life is low enough socially--it is almost an annual round of\r\nworking, eating, and sleeping (no one sleeps like a farm-wench); but it\r\nis an infinite improvement upon the struggle for existence at the\r\ncottage. She has no trouble, no thought, no care now. Her mistress may\r\nsnap occasionally, her master may grumble, and the dairymaid may snarl;\r\nbut there are no slaps on the ear, no kicks, no going to bed supperless.\r\nIn summer she goes out in the afternoon haymaking as an extra hand, but\r\nonly works a few hours, and it is really only a relaxation. She picks up\r\nsome knowledge of cooking, learns how to make herself useful in the\r\nhouse, and in the course of a year or two, if moderately sharp, is\r\ncapable of rising a degree, and obtaining a better salary as a\r\nmaid-servant, having nothing to do with a dairy. The four or five pounds\r\nwith which she commences may seem a very low sum, but the state of her\r\ndomestic education at the time must be taken into consideration. She has\r\nto learn everything. All the years spent in working in the cottage at\r\nhome have to be unlearnt--all the old habits replaced by new ones. After\r\nthe first year or so her value rises considerably; she may continue in\r\nthe house at a higher salary, or go into the town as maid-servant in a\r\ntradesman's family. A large proportion of servant-girls thus find their\r\nway from the country into the town. With these we have nothing further\r\nto do--they are no longer field-farers. A few after several years learn\r\nthe art and mystery of butter and cheese, and become dairymaids; and\r\nthen, if they are clever, earn good wages--indeed, fabulous prices are\r\nasked by them. There are not, however, so many dairymaids as formerly,\r\nfor the small dairies are getting amalgamated and made into larger ones,\r\nand then the farmer, if he makes butter and cheese, employs a dairyman\r\nin preference. This rise to be maid-servant, or to be dairymaid, is the\r\nbright side of the girl's career. There are darker shades which must be\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe overcrowding in cottages leads to what may be called an indifference\r\nto decency. It is not that in families decency is wantonly and of a set\r\npurpose disregarded, but stern necessity leads to a coarseness and\r\nindelicacy which hardens the mind and deadens the natural modesty even\r\nof the best girls. Then the low scandals of the village talked over from\r\ncottage to cottage, the rude jokes of the hayfield, the general\r\nlooseness and indifference which prevail as to morality, all prepare the\r\ngirl for the too common fall. If she remains at home and works in the\r\nfields after the age of fifteen, unless uncommonly strong-minded, it is\r\nan open question whether she will or will not succumb. If she goes into\r\na farmhouse as servant, the chances are in favour of her escaping\r\ntemptation. But in farmhouses she may also sometimes run into the very\r\njaws of danger. It is not uncommon in some districts for young labourers\r\nto sleep in the house, one or two who milk and have to be on the spot\r\nearly. These take their supper in the kitchen or the brewhouse, and,\r\ndespite the strictest precautions on the part of the mistress, enjoy\r\nplenty of opportunities for flirting with the girl. Young, full of\r\nanimal spirits, giddy and ignorant, she thinks no harm of a romp, and\r\nfinally falls, and has to leave her service. If a little may be said in\r\nfavour of the poor girls, not a word can be said in favour of the\r\nagricultural men, who are immoral almost without exception, and will\r\nremain so until a better-educated generation with more self-respect\r\narises. The number of poor girls, from fifteen to five-and-twenty, in\r\nagricultural parishes who have illegitimate offspring is extremely\r\nlarge, and is illustrated by the fact that, out of the marriages that\r\ntake place--and agricultural poor are a marrying class--scarcely any\r\noccur until the condition of the girl is too manifest to be any longer\r\nconcealed. Instances could be mentioned where the clergyman's wife, with\r\na view to check the immorality around her, has offered a reward of a\r\npiece of furniture to the first married woman who does not bear a child\r\ntill nine months after marriage; the custom being within three months.\r\nThe frequency of the appeals to the petty sessions in rural districts\r\nfor orders of contribution, by young unmarried girls, also illustrates\r\nthe prevalent immorality. Of late the magistrates have taken the line of\r\nordering contributions on a higher scale, on the grounds that the\r\nlabourer earns larger wages, and that the cost of living has risen, and\r\nalso as a check upon the men. This well-intentioned step has had the\r\nprecisely opposite effect to what was wished. The labourer with higher\r\nwages feels the demand upon his pocket but very little more. The cost of\r\nliving in rural outlying districts has risen only to a very trifling\r\ndegree--barely perceptibly, in fact. Bread is cheap--that is the\r\nstaple--rents are the same, and there are more allotments than ever,\r\nmaking vegetables more easy to obtain. The result, therefore, is this,\r\nthat the girl feels she can sin with comparative immunity. She is almost\r\nsure to get her order (very few such appeals are refused); let this be\r\nsupplemented with some aid from the parish, and she is none the worse\r\noff than before, for there is no prejudice against employing her in the\r\nfields. Should her fall take place with some young farmer's son from\r\nwhom she may get a larger contribution in private, or by order of the\r\nmagistrates, she is really and truly in a pecuniary sense better off\r\nthan she was before, for she has a certain fixed income. The evil is\r\naggravated by the new law, which enables the order to be extended over a\r\nlonger term of years than formerly, so that for fifteen years is a\r\ncommon thing. If it is decided to recognise immorality, and to provide\r\nagainst the woman being unduly injured by it, then these orders are\r\ncertainly the correct procedure; but if it is desired to suppress it,\r\nthen they are a total failure. The girl who has had an illegitimate\r\nchild is thought very little the worse of by her friends and her own\r\nclass, especially if her seducer is a man who can afford to pay for\r\nit--that is the grand point. If she is fool enough to yield to a man who\r\nis badly off, she may be jeered at as a fool, but rarely reprimanded as\r\na sinner, not even by her own mother. Such things are not looked upon by\r\nthe rural poor as sins, but as accidents of their condition.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to be hard upon the poor girls, but consider their training.\r\nMany of them cannot read or write; how many even can sew well? The\r\ncottage girl is always a poor hand at her needle, and has to be taught\r\nby the elder servants when she first goes into her place. Accustomed\r\nfrom childhood to what would be considered abominable indecency in a\r\nhigher class of life; constantly hearing phrases which it is impossible\r\nto allude to; running wild about the lanes and fields with stalwart\r\nyoung men coarser and ruder than those at home; seeing other girls none\r\nthe worse off, and commiserated with rather than condemned, what wonder\r\nis it if the natural result takes place? The fairs have been credited\r\nwith much of the mischief, and undoubtedly they are productive of evil;\r\nbut if they were abolished, the average would in all probability remain\r\nabout the same. The evil is inherent, and does not depend upon\r\ncircumstances. It is the outcome of a long series of generations; it\r\ncannot be overcome in a decade. Education will do much, but not all.\r\nYouth is always led by the tone of the elder people. Until the tone of\r\nthe parent is improved, the conduct of the young will remain much the\r\nsame. The more distant a parish from a town, the more outlying and\r\nstrictly agricultural, and therefore stagnant, the greater the\r\nimmorality. It is the one blot upon the character of the agricultural\r\npoor. They are not thieves, they are not drunkards; if they do drink\r\nthey are harmless, and it evaporates in shouting and slang. They are not\r\nriotous; but the immorality cannot be gainsaid. No specific cure for\r\nthis state of things can be devised: it must slowly work itself out\r\nunder the gradual pressure of an advancing social state. It will be\r\nslow; for, up to the present, the woman has had but a small share of the\r\nbenefit that has befallen the labourer through higher wages. If higher\r\nwages mainly go for drink, the wife at home is not much the better. The\r\nwomen say themselves they are no better off.\r\n\r\nIf the girl at eighteen or twenty--in most agricultural marriages the\r\ngirls are very young--is fortunate enough to have placed her faith in a\r\nman who redeems his word, then comes the difficulty of the cottage and\r\nthe furniture to fill it. Cottages are often difficult to find,\r\nespecially anywhere near a man's work, which is the great object. The\r\nfurniture required is not much, but there must be some. The labourer\r\ndoes not deal much with the town furniture-dealer. A great deal of the\r\nfurniture in cottages has been picked up at the sales of farmers on\r\nquitting their tenancies. Such are the old chairs, the formal sideboards\r\nand eight-day clocks standing in tall, square oaken cases by the\r\nstaircase in the cottage. Such, too, are the great wooden bedsteads of\r\noak or maple upstairs; and from the same source come the really good\r\nfeather-beds and blankets. The women--especially the elder women--go to\r\ngreat trouble, and pinch themselves, to find a way of purchasing a good\r\nbed, and set no small pride upon it. These old oaken bedsteads, and\r\nsideboards, and chairs have perhaps been in the farmhouse for three or\r\nfour generations, and are at last sold because the final representative\r\nof the family is imbued with modern ideas, and quits farming for trade.\r\nThe cottagers always attend sales like this, and occasionally get hold\r\nof good bargains, and so it is that really good substantial furniture\r\nmay often be found in the possession of the better class of labourers.\r\nThe old people accumulate these things, and when their sons or daughters\r\nmarry, can generally spare a few chairs, a bedstead and bed, and with a\r\nlittle crockery from other relations, and a few utensils bought in the\r\nadjacent town, the cottage is furnished sufficiently well for a couple\r\nwhose habits are necessarily simple. After marriage the hard work of the\r\nwoman's life really begins--work compared with which her early\r\nexperience at home is nothing; and many, if they have left situations in\r\nfarmhouses, deeply regret the change. The labourer can hardly be\r\nexpected to feel the more exalted sentiments; and if in the upper\r\nclasses even it is said that romance ends with marriage, it is doubly,\r\nliterally true of the agricultural poor. In addition to her household\r\nwork, she has to labour in the fields, or to wash--perhaps worse than\r\nthe former alternative; and after a while her husband, too commonly\r\nwearying of his home, in which he finds nothing but a tired woman and\r\ntroublesome children, leaves her for the public-house, and consumes\r\ntwo-thirds of their slender income in beer. The attachment of the woman\r\nfor her husband lasts longer than that of the man for the woman. Even\r\nwhen he has become a confirmed drunkard, and her life with incessant\r\nlabour has become a burden to her, she will struggle on, striving to get\r\nbread for the children and the rent for the landlord. She knows that as\r\nevening comes on, instead of sitting down to rest, her duty will be to\r\ngo down to the public-house and wait till it pleases her lord and master\r\nto try to stagger home, and then to guide his clumsy steps to the\r\nthreshold. Of course there are wives who become as bad as their\r\nhusbands, who drink, or do worse, and neglect their homes, but they are\r\nthe exception. As a rule, the woman, once married, does her best to keep\r\nher home together.\r\n\r\nThe wife of the labourer does not get her shins smashed with heavy kicks\r\nfrom hobnailed boots, such as the Lancashire ruffians administer; but,\r\nalthough serious wife-beating cases are infrequent, there are few women\r\nwho escape an occasional blow from their husbands. Most of them get a\r\nmoderate amount of thrashing in the course of their lives, and take it\r\nmuch as they take the hardships and poverty of their condition, as a\r\nnecessity not to be escaped. The labourer is not downright brutal to his\r\nwife, but he certainly thinks he has a right to chastise her when she\r\ndispleases him. Once in authority, the labourer is stern, hard, and\r\ninconsiderate of the feelings of others, and he is in authority in his\r\nown cottage. The wife has been accustomed to such treatment more or less\r\nfrom her childhood; she has been slapped and banged about at home, and\r\ntherefore thinks comparatively little of a blow from her husband's hand.\r\nThe man does not mean it so brutally as it appears to outsiders. This\r\nsemi-wife-beating is only too prevalent.\r\n\r\nDoes the incessant labour undergone by an agricultural woman result in\r\nill effects to her physical frame? The day-work in the fields, the\r\nhaymaking, and such labour as is paid for by the day and not by the\r\npiece, cannot do any injury, for it is light, and the hours are short.\r\nIn some districts the women do not come before half-past eight, and\r\nleave a little after four, and they have a long hour out for dinner. It\r\nis the piece-work of the corn-harvest that tries the frame, when work\r\nbegins at sunrise or shortly after, and lasts till the latest twilight,\r\nand when it is work, real muscular strain. This cannot but leave its\r\nmark. Otherwise the field is not injurious to the woman so far as the\r\nlabour is concerned, and the exposure is not so great as has been\r\nsupposed, because women are scarcely ever expected to work in wet\r\nweather. The worst of the exposure is probably endured upon the arable\r\nfields in the bitter winds of spring; but this does not last very long.\r\nIn what way field-labour is degrading to the women it is difficult to\r\nunderstand. The only work of a disgusting nature now performed by women\r\nis the beating of clots on pasture-land, and that is quickly over. After\r\nall, there is nothing so very dreadful in it. Stone-picking,\r\ncouch-clearing, hoeing, haymaking, reaping, certainly none of these are\r\nin any way disgusting operations. Women do not attend to cattle now. As\r\nto the immorality, undoubtedly a great deal of what is coarse and rude\r\ndoes pass upon the hayfield, but the hayfield does not originate it; if\r\nthe same men and women met elsewhere, the same jokes would be uttered\r\nand conduct indulged in. The position of agricultural women is a painful\r\none to contemplate, and their lives full of hardships; but field-labour\r\ncannot be fairly accused as the cause of the evils they endure. Their\r\nstrength is overstrained in the cornfield; but what can you do? It is\r\ntheir gold-mine--their one grand opportunity of getting a little money.\r\nIt would be cruel kindness to deny it to them; and, in point of fact,\r\nexcept by interfering with the liberty of the subject, it would be\r\nimpossible to prevent them. Farm-labour is certainly to be preferred to\r\nmuch of the work that women do in manufacturing districts. At least\r\nthere is no overcrowding; there is plenty of fresh air, and the woman\r\nwho works in the field looks quite as robust and healthy as her sister\r\nsitting all day in a confined factory.\r\n\r\nIt used to be common to see women dressed in a kind of smock-frock; this\r\nwas in the days when they milked, and it is still occasionally worn. Now\r\nthey generally wear linsey dresses in the winter, and cotton in the\r\nsummer, at prices from 4-1/2d. to 6d. per yard. They wear boots nailed and\r\ntipped much like the men, but not so heavy, and in rough weather\r\ncorduroy gaiters. Their cooking is rude and detestable to any one else's\r\nideas; but it appears exactly suited to the coarse tastes and hearty\r\nappetite of their husbands. Being uneducated, and a large proportion\r\nunable to read, their chief intellectual amusement consists in\r\ntittle-tattle and gossip. They are generally inclined to be religious\r\nafter a fashion, and frequent the chapel or the cottage in which the\r\nitinerant preacher holds forth. In summer this preacher will mount upon\r\na waggon placed in a field by the roadside, and draw a large audience,\r\nchiefly women, who loudly respond and groan and mutter after the most\r\napproved manner. Now and then an elderly woman may be found who is\r\nconsidered to have a gift of preaching, and holds forth at great length,\r\nquoting Scripture right and left. The exhibitions of emotion on the part\r\nof the women at such meetings and in the services in their cottages are\r\nnot pleasant to listen to, but the impression left on the mind is that\r\nthey are in earnest.\r\n\r\nThey are a charitable race, and eager to help each other. They will\r\nwatch by the bedsides of their sick neighbours, divide the loaf of\r\nbread, look after the children and trudge weary miles to the town for\r\nmedicine. On the other hand, they are almost childlike in imbibing\r\njealousies and hatreds, and unsparing in abuse and imputation towards a\r\nsupposed enemy. They are bolder in speech than their husbands to those\r\nwho occupy higher places in the social scale. It cannot be said that\r\nagricultural women are handsome. In childhood they are too often thin\r\nand stunted; later they shoot up and grow taller, but remain thin and\r\nbony till from eighteen to twenty, when they get plumper, and then is\r\ntheir period of prettiness, if at all. Bright eyes, clear complexions,\r\nand glossy hair form their attractions, for their features are scarcely\r\never good. The brief beauty of the prime of youth speedily fades, and at\r\nfive-and-twenty the agricultural woman, especially if married, is pale\r\nor else burnt by the sun to a brown, with flat chest and rounded\r\nshoulders. It is rare indeed to see a woman with any pretensions to what\r\nis called a figure. It would be wonderful if there were, for much of the\r\nlabour induces a stooping position, and they are never taught when\r\nyoung to sit upright.\r\n\r\nGrowing plainer and plainer as years go by, the elder women are wrinkled\r\nand worn-looking, and have contracted a perpetual stoop. Many live to a\r\ngreat age. In small parishes it is common to find a large number of\r\nwomen of seventy and eighty, and there are few cottages which do not\r\ncontain an old woman. This is hardly a result in accordance with the\r\nlabour they have undergone. The explanation probably is that, continued\r\nthrough a series of generations, it has produced a strength and stamina\r\nwhich can survive almost anything. Certain it is that young couples\r\nabout to marry often experience much difficulty in finding cottages,\r\nbecause they are occupied by extremely aged pairs; and landlords,\r\nanxious to tear down and remove old cottages tumbling to pieces, are\r\nrestrained from doing so out of regard for the aged tenants, who cling\r\nwith a species of superstitious tenderness to the crumbling walls and\r\ndecayed thatch. At this age, at seventy-five or even eighty, the\r\nagricultural woman retains a strength of body astonishing to a town-bred\r\nwoman. She will walk eight or ten miles, without apparent fatigue, to\r\nand from the nearest town for her provisions. She will almost to the\r\nlast carry her prong out into the hayfield, and do a little work in some\r\ncorner, and bear her part in the gleaning after the harvest. She lives\r\nalmost entirely upon weak tea and bread sops. Her mental powers continue\r\nnearly unimpaired, and her eyes are still good, though her teeth have\r\nlong gone. She will laugh over memories of practical jokes played at\r\nharvest-homes half-a-century ago; and slowly spells over the service in\r\na prayer-book which asks blessings upon a king instead of a queen. She\r\noften keeps the village \"confectioner's\" shop--_i.e._, a few bottles of\r\nsweets and jumbles in the window, side by side with \"twists\" of whipcord\r\nfor the ploughboys and carters, and perhaps has a license for tobacco\r\nand snuff.\r\n\r\nBut long before this age they have in most cases been kept by the\r\nparish. The farmers who form the guardians know well the history of the\r\npoor of their parishes, and remembering the long years of hard work,\r\nalways allow as liberal a relief as they can to these women. Out of all\r\ntheir many children and grandchildren, it may happen that one has got on\r\nfairly well in life, has a business as a blacksmith, or tinker, or\r\ncarpenter, and gives her a shilling or so a week; and a shilling goes a\r\nlong way with a woman who lives upon tea and sops. In their latter days\r\nthese women resemble the pollard oaks, which linger on year after year,\r\nand finally fall from sheer decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_AN ENGLISH HOMESTEAD._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to pass along a country road without observing half of the\r\nfarmhouses, so many being situated at a distance from the highway, and\r\nothers hidden by the thick hedges and the foliage of the trees. This is\r\nespecially the case in districts chiefly occupied in pasture farming,\r\nmeadow land being usually found along the banks of rivers, on broad\r\nlevel plains, or in slightly undulating prairie-like country. A splendid\r\nbelt of meadows often runs at the base of the chalk hills, where the\r\nsprings break out; and it is here that some of the most beautiful\r\npastoral scenery is to be found.\r\n\r\nBy the side of the highway there are gates at intervals in the\r\nclose-cropped hedge--kept close-cropped by the strict orders of the road\r\nsurveyors--giving access to the green fields through which runs a\r\nwaggon-track, apparently losing itself in the grass. This track will\r\ntake the explorer to a farmhouse. It is not altogether pleasant to drive\r\nover in a spring trap, as the wheels jolt in the hard ruts, and the\r\nsprings are shaken in the deep furrows, the vehicle going up and down\r\nlike a boat upon the waves. Why there should be such furrows in a meadow\r\nis a question that naturally arises in the mind. Whether it be mown with\r\nthe scythe or the mowing-machine, it is of advantage to have the surface\r\nof the field as nearly as possible level; and it is therefore most\r\nprobable that these deep furrows had their origin at a period when a\r\ndifferent state of things prevailed, when the farmer strove to grow as\r\nmuch wheat as possible, and devoted every acre that he dared break up to\r\nthe plough. Many of these fields were ill adapted for the growth of\r\ncorn, the soil unsuitable and liable to be partially flooded;\r\nconsequently as soon as the market was opened, and the price of wheat\r\ndeclined, so that rapid fortunes could no longer be made by it, the\r\nfields were allowed to return to their natural condition. No trouble was\r\ntaken to relevel the land, and the furrows remain silent witnesses to\r\nthe past. They are useful as drains it is true; but, being so broad,\r\nthe water only passes off slowly and encourages the rough grass and\r\n\"bull-polls\" to spring up, which are as uneatable by cattle as the\r\nAustralian spinifex.\r\n\r\nThe waggon-track is not altogether creditable to the farmer, who would,\r\none would have thought, have had a good road up to his house at all\r\nevents. It is very wide, and in damp weather every one who drives along\r\nit goes further and further out into the grass to find a firm spot, till\r\nas much space is rendered barren as by one of the great hedges, now so\r\nabominated. The expense of laying down stone is considerable in some\r\nlocalities where the geological formation does not afford quarries; yet\r\neven then there is a plan, simple in itself, but rarely resorted to, by\r\nwhich a great saving in outlay may be effected. Any one who will look at\r\na cart-track will see that there are three parallel marks left by the\r\npassage of the cart upon the ground. The two outside ruts are caused by\r\nthe wheels, and between these is a third beaten in by the hoofs of the\r\nhorse. The plan consists in placing stone, broken up small, not across\r\nthe whole width of the track, but in these three ruts only; for it is in\r\nthese ruts alone that the wear takes place, and, if the ground were\r\nfirm there, no necessity would exist to go farther into the field. To be\r\nthoroughly successful, a trench, say six or eight inches wide, and about\r\nas deep, should be cut in the place of each rut, and these trenches\r\nmacadamised. Grass grows freely in the narrow green strips between the\r\nruts, and the track has something of the appearance of a railroad. It is\r\nastonishing how long these metals, as it were, will last, when once well\r\nput down; and the track has a neat, effective look. The foot-passenger\r\nis as much benefited as the tenant of the field. In wet weather he walks\r\nupon the macadamised strip dryshod, and in summer upon either of the\r\ngrass strips, easily and comfortably, without going out into the\r\nmowing-grass to have the pleasure of turf under his feet.\r\n\r\nThese deep furrows are also awkward to cross with heavy loads of hay or\r\nstraw, and it requires much skill to build a load able to withstand the\r\nsevere jolting and lurching. Some of the worst are often filled up with\r\na couple of large faggots in the harvest season. These tracks run by the\r\nside of the hedge, and the ditches are crossed by bridges or \"drocks.\"\r\nThe last gate opens into a small field surrounded with a high thick\r\nhawthorn hedge, itself a thing of beauty in May and June, first with the\r\nMay blossom and afterwards with the delicate-tinted dog or wild roses. A\r\nspreading ash-tree stands on either side of the gateway, from which on\r\nKing Charles's day the ploughboys carefully select small branches, those\r\nwith the leaves evenly arranged, instead of odd numbers, to place in\r\ntheir hats. Tall elm-trees grow close together in the hedge and upon the\r\n\"shore\" of the ditch, enclosing the place in a high wall of foliage. In\r\nthe branches are the rooks' nests, built of small twigs apparently\r\nthrown together, and yet so firmly intertwined as to stand the swaying\r\nof the tree-tops in the rough blasts of winter. In the spring the rook\r\nbuilds a second nest on the floor of the old one, and this continues\r\ntill five or six successive layers may be traced; and when at last some\r\nruder tempest strews the grass with its ruin, there is enough wood to\r\nfill a bushel basket.\r\n\r\nThe dovecot is fixed in the fork of one of the larger elms, where the\r\ntrunk divides into huge boughs, each the size of a tree; and in the long\r\nrank grass near the hedge the backs of a black Berkshire pig or two may\r\nbe seen like porpoises rolling in the green sea. Here and there an\r\nancient apple-tree, bent down and bowed to the ground with age, offers a\r\nmossy, shady seat upon one of its branches which has returned to the\r\nearth from which it sprung. Some wooden posts grown green and\r\nlichen-covered, standing at regular intervals, show where the housewife\r\ndries her linen. Right before the very door a great horse-chestnut tree\r\nrears itself in all the beauty of its thousands of blossoms, hiding half\r\nthe house. A small patch of ground in front is railed in with wooden\r\npalings to keep out the pigs, and poultry, and dogs--for almost every\r\nvisitor brings with him one or more dogs--and in this narrow garden grow\r\nvelvety wall-flowers, cloves, pinks, shrubs of lavender, and a few herbs\r\nwhich are useful for seasoning. The house is built of brick; but the\r\ncolour is toned down by age, and against the wall a pear-tree is trained\r\nupon one side, and upon the other a cherry-tree, so that at certain\r\nseasons one may rise in the morning and gather the fresh fruits from the\r\nwindow. The lower windows were once latticed; but the old frames have\r\nbeen replaced with the sash, which if not so picturesque, affords more\r\nlight, and most old farmhouses are deficient in the supply of light. The\r\nupper windows remain latticed still. The red tiles of the roof are dull\r\nwith lichen and the beating of the weather; and the chimney, if looked\r\nat closely, is full of tiny holes--it is where the leaden pellets from\r\nguns fired at the mischievous starlings have struck the bricks. A pair\r\nof doves perched upon the roof-tree coo amorously to each other, and a\r\nthin streak of blue smoke rises into the still air.\r\n\r\nThe door is ajar, or wide open. There is no fear here of thieves, or\r\nstreet-boys throwing stones into the hall. Excepting in rain or rough\r\nwind, and at night, that front door will be open almost all the summer\r\nlong. When shut at night it is fastened with a wooden bar passing across\r\nthe whole width of the door, and fitting into iron staples on each\r\npost--a simple contrivance, but very strong and not easily tampered\r\nwith. Many of the interior doors still open with the old thumb-latch;\r\nbut the piece of shoe-string to pull and lift it is now relegated to the\r\ncottages, and fast disappearing even there before brass-handled locks.\r\nThis house is not old enough to possess the nail-studded door of solid\r\noak and broad stone-built porch of some farmhouses still occasionally to\r\nbe found, and which date from the sixteenth century. The porch here\r\nsimply projects about two feet, and is supported by trellis-work, up\r\nwhich the honeysuckle has been trained. A path of stone slabs leads from\r\nthe palings up to the threshold, and the hall within is paved with\r\nsimilar flags. The staircase is opposite the doorway, narrow, and\r\nguiltless of oilcloth or carpeting; and with reason, for the tips and\r\nnails of the heavy boots which tramp up and down it would speedily wear\r\ncarpets into rags. There is a door at the bottom of the staircase closed\r\nat night. By the side of the staircase is a doorway which leads into the\r\ndairy--two steps lower than the front of the house.\r\n\r\nThe sitting-room is on the left of the hall, and the floor is of the\r\nsame cold stone flags, which in damp weather become wet and slimy. These\r\nflags, in fact, act as a barometer, and foretell rain with great\r\naccuracy, as it were perspiring with latent moisture at its approach.\r\nThe chimney was originally constructed for a wood fire upon the hearth,\r\nand of enormous size, so that several sides of bacon could be hung up\r\ninside to be smoke-dried. The fireplace was very broad, so that huge\r\nlogs could be thrown at once upon the fire with very little trouble of\r\nsawing them short. Since coal has come into general use, and wood grown\r\nscarce, the fireplace has been partly built up and an iron grate\r\ninserted, which looks out of place in so large a cavity. The curious\r\nfire-dogs, upon which the wood was thrown, may still, perhaps, be found\r\nupstairs in some corner of the lumber-room. On the mantelpiece are still\r\npreserved, well polished and bright, the several pieces of the \"jack\" or\r\ncooking apparatus; and a pair of great brazen candlesticks ornament it\r\nat each end. A leaden or latten tobacco-bowl, a brazen pestle and\r\nmortar, and half-a-dozen odd figures in china, are also scattered upon\r\nit, surmounted by a narrow looking-glass. In one corner stands an old\r\neight-day clock with a single hour hand--minute hands being a modern\r\nimprovement; but it is silent, and its duties are performed by an\r\nAmerican timepiece supported upon a bracket against the wall. Upstairs,\r\nhowever, upon the landing, a similar ancient piece of clockmaking still\r\nticks solemn and slow with a ponderous melancholy. The centre of the\r\nroom is occupied with an oaken table, solid and enduring, but\r\ninconvenient to sit at; and upon each side of the fireplace is a\r\nstiff-backed arm-chair. A ledge under the window forms a pleasant seat\r\nin summer. Before the fireplace is a rug, the favourite resort of the\r\nspaniels and cats. The rest of the floor used to be bare; but of late\r\nyears a square of cocoanut matting has been laid down. A cumbrous piece\r\nof furniture takes up almost half of one side--not known in modern\r\nmanufactories. It is of oak, rudely polished, and inlaid with brass. At\r\nthe bottom are great deep drawers, pulled open with brass rings\r\nornamented with dogs' heads. In these drawers are kept\r\ncow-drenches--bottles of oils for the wounds which cattle sometimes get\r\nfrom nails or kicks; dog-whips and pruning-knives; a shot-belt and\r\npowder-flask; an old horse-pistol; a dozen odd stones or fossils picked\r\nup upon the farm and kept as curiosities; twenty or thirty old almanacs,\r\nand a file of the county paper for forty years; and a hundred similar\r\nodds and ends. Above the drawers comes a desk with a few pigeon-holes;\r\na desk little used, for the farmer is less of a literary turn than\r\nalmost any other class. The pigeon-holes are stuffed full of old papers,\r\nrecipes for cattle medicines, and, perhaps, a book of divinity or\r\nsermons printed in the days of Charles II., leather-covered and\r\nworm-eaten. Still higher are a pair of cupboards where china, the\r\ntea-set, and the sugar and groceries in immediate use are kept. On the\r\ntop, which is three or four inches under the ceiling, are two or three\r\nsmall brown-paper parcels of grass seeds, and a variety of nondescript\r\narticles. Opposite, on the other wall, and close above the chimneypiece,\r\nso as to be kept dry, is the gun-rack with two double-barrels, a long\r\nsingle-barrel duck gun, and a cavalry sabre, worn once a year by a son\r\nof the house who goes out to training in the yeomanry.\r\n\r\nThere are a few pictures, not of a high class--three or four prints\r\ndepicting Dick Turpin's ride to York, and a coloured sketch of some\r\nsteeplechase winner, or a copy of a well-known engraving representing a\r\nfeat accomplished many years ago at a farm. A flock of sheep were shorn,\r\nthe wool carded and spun, and a coat made of it, and worn by the\r\nflockowner, and all in one day. From this room a door opens into the\r\ncellar and pantry, partly underground, and reached by three or four\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the hall is the parlour, which was originally\r\nfloored, like the sitting-room, with stone flags, since taken up and\r\nreplaced by boards. This is carpeted, and contains a comfortable\r\nold-fashioned sofa, horse-hair chairs, and upon the side tables may,\r\nperhaps, be found a few specimens of valuable old china, made to do duty\r\nas flower-vases, and filled with roses. The room has a fresh, sweet\r\nsmell from the open window and the flowers. It tempts almost\r\nirresistibly to repose in the noontide heat of a summer's day.\r\n\r\nUpstairs there are two fair-sized bedrooms, furnished with four-post\r\nwooden bedsteads. The second flight of stairs, going up to the attic,\r\nhas also a door at the foot. This house is built upon a simple but\r\neffective design, well calculated for the purposes to be served. It\r\nresembles two houses placed not end to end, as in a block, but side by\r\nside, and each part has a separate roof. Under the front roof, which is\r\nsomewhat higher than the other, are the living-rooms of the family:\r\nsitting-room, parlour, bedroom, and attics, or servants' bedrooms. Under\r\nthe lower roof are the offices, the cheese-loft, dairy, kitchen, cellar,\r\nand wood-house. Numerous doors give easy communication on each floor, so\r\nthat the house consists of two distinct portions, and the business is\r\nkept quite apart from the living rooms, and yet close to them. This is,\r\nperhaps, the most convenient manner in which a dairy farmhouse can be\r\nbuilt; and the plan was undoubtedly the result of experience. Of course,\r\nin dairy-farming upon a very extended scale, or as a gentlemanly\r\namusement, it would be preferable to have the offices entirely apart,\r\nand at some distance from the dwelling-house. These remarks apply to an\r\nordinary farm of moderate size.\r\n\r\nLeaving the hall by the door at the side of the staircase, two steps\r\ndescend into the dairy, which is almost invariably floored with stone\r\nflags, even in localities where brick is used for the flooring of the\r\nsitting-room. The great object aimed at in the construction of the dairy\r\nwas coolness, and freedom from dust as much as possible. The stone flags\r\nensure a cool floor; and the windows always open to the north, so that\r\nneither the summer sunshine nor the warm southern winds can injuriously\r\naffect the produce. It is a long open room, whitewashed, in the centre\r\nof which stands the cheese-tub, until lately invariably made of wood,\r\nbut now frequently of tin, this material taking much less trouble to\r\nkeep clean. The cheese-tub is large enough for a Roman lady's bath of\r\nmilk. Against one wall are the whey-leads--shallow, long, and broad\r\nvessels of wood, lined with lead, supported two or three feet above the\r\nfloor, so that buckets can be placed underneath. In these \"leads\" the\r\nwhey is kept, and drawn off by pulling up a wooden plug. Under the\r\n\"leads\"--as out of the way--are some of the great milk-pans into which\r\nthe milk is poured. Pussy sometimes dips her nose into these, and\r\nwhitens her whiskers with cream. At one end of the room is the\r\ncheese-press. The ancient press, with its complicated arrangement of\r\nlong iron levers weighted at the end something like a steelyard, and\r\ndrawn up by cords and pulleys, has been taken down and lies discarded in\r\nthe lumber-room. The pressure in the more modern machine is obtained\r\nfrom a screw. The rennet-vat is perhaps hidden behind the press, and\r\nthere are piles of the cheese-moulds or vats beside it, into which the\r\ncurd is placed when fit to be compressed into the proper shape and\r\nconsistency. All the utensils here are polished, and clean to the last\r\ndegree; without extreme cleanliness success in cheese or butter making\r\ncannot be achieved. The windows are devoid of glass; they are really\r\nwind doors, closed when necessary, with a shutter on hinges like a\r\ncupboard door. Cats and birds are prevented from entering by means of\r\nwire screens--like a coarse netting of wire--and an upright iron bar\r\nkeeps out more dangerous thieves. There is a copper for scalding milk.\r\nWhen in good order there is scarcely any odour in a dairy,\r\nnotwithstanding the decidedly strong smell of some of the materials\r\nemployed: free egress of air and perfect cleanliness takes off all but\r\nthe faintest _astringent_ flavour. In summer it is often the custom of\r\ndairymaids to leave buckets full of water standing under the \"leads\" or\r\nelsewhere out of the way, or a milk-pan is left with water in it, to\r\npurify the atmosphere. Water, it is well known, has a remarkable power\r\nof preventing the air from going \"dead\" as it were. A model dairy\r\nshould have a small fountain in some convenient position, with a jet\r\nconstantly playing. The state of the atmosphere has the most powerful\r\neffect upon the contents of the dairy, especially during times of\r\nelectrical tension.\r\n\r\nTo the right of the dairy is the brewhouse, now rarely used for the\r\npurpose implied in its name, though the tubs, and coolers, and other\r\n\"plant\" necessary for the process are still preserved. Here there is a\r\nlarge copper also; and the oven often opens on to the brewhouse. In this\r\nplace the men have their meals. Next to it is the wood-house, used for\r\nthe storage of the wood which is required for immediate use, and must\r\ntherefore be dry; and beyond that the kitchen, where the fire is still\r\nupon the hearth, though coal is mixed with the logs and faggots. Along\r\nthe whole length of this side of the house there is a paved or pitched\r\ncourtyard enclosed by a low brick wall, with one or two gates opening\r\nupon the paths which lead to the rickyards and the stalls. The\r\nbuttermilk and refuse from the dairy runs by a channel cut in the stone\r\nacross the court into a vault or well sunk in the ground, from whence\r\nit is dipped for the pigs. The vault is closed at the mouth by a heavy\r\nwooden lid. There is a well and pump for water here; sometimes with a\r\nwindlass, when the well is deep. If the water be low or out of\r\ncondition, it is fetched in yokes from the nearest running stream. The\r\nacid or \"eating\" power of the buttermilk, &c., may be noted in the\r\nstones, which in many places are scooped or hollowed out. A portion of\r\nthe court is roofed in, and is called the \"skilling.\" It is merely\r\ncovered in without walls, the roof supported upon oaken posts. Under\r\nthis the buckets are placed to dry after being cleaned, and here the\r\nchurn may often be seen. A separate staircase, rising from the dairy,\r\ngives access to the cheese-loft. It is an immense apartment, reaching\r\nfrom one end of the house to the other, and as lofty as the roof will\r\npermit, for it is not ceiled. The windows are like those of the dairy.\r\nDown the centre are long double shelves sustained upon strong upright\r\nbeams, tier upon tier from the floor as high as the arms can\r\nconveniently reach. Upon these shelves the cheese is stored, each lying\r\nupon its side; and, as no two cheeses are placed one upon the other\r\nuntil quite ready for eating, a ton or two occupies a considerable\r\nspace while in process of drying. They are also placed in rows upon the\r\nfloor, which is made exceptionally strong, and supported upon great\r\nbeams to bear the weight. The scales used to be hung from a beam\r\noverhead, and consisted of an iron bar, at each end of which a square\r\nboard was slung with ropes--one board to pile up the cheese on, and the\r\nother for the counterpoise of weights. These rude and primitive scales\r\nare now generally superseded by modern and more accurate instruments,\r\nweighing to a much smaller fraction. Stone half-hundredweights and stone\r\nquarters were in common use not long since. A cheese-loft, when full, is\r\na noble sight of its kind, and represents no little labour and skill.\r\nWhen sold, the cheese is carefully packed in the cart with straw to\r\nprevent its being injured. The oil or grease from the cheese gradually\r\nworks its way into the shelves and floor, and even into the staircase,\r\ntill the woodwork seems saturated with it. Rats and mice are the pests\r\nof the loft; and so great is their passion for cheese that neither cats,\r\ntraps, nor poison can wholly repress these invaders, against whom\r\nunceasing war is waged. The starlings--who, if the roof be of thatch,\r\nas it is in many farmhouses, make their nests in it--occasionally carry\r\ntheir holes right through, and are unmercifully exterminated when they\r\nventure within reach, or they would quickly let the rain and the\r\ndaylight in.\r\n\r\nAs the dairy and offices face the north, so the front of the house--the\r\nportion used for domestic purposes--has a southern aspect, which\r\nexperience has proved to be healthy. But at the same time, despite its\r\ncompactness and general convenience, there are many defects in the\r\nbuilding--defects chiefly of a sanitary character. It is very doubtful\r\nif there are any drains at all. Even though the soil be naturally dry,\r\nthe ground floor is almost always cold and damp. The stone flags are\r\nthemselves cold enough, and are often placed upon the bare earth. The\r\nthreshold is on a level with the ground outside, and sometimes a step\r\nlower, and in wet weather the water penetrates to the hall. There is\r\nanother disadvantage. If the door be left open, which it usually is,\r\nfrogs, toads, and creeping things generally, sometimes make their way\r\nin, though ruthlessly swept out again; and an occasional snake from the\r\nlong grass at the very door is an unpleasant, though perfectly harmless\r\nvisitor. The floor should be raised a foot or so above the level of the\r\nearth, and some provision made against the damp by a layer of concrete\r\nor something of the kind. If not, even if boards be substituted for the\r\nflags, they will soon decay. It often happens that farmhouses upon\r\nmeadow land are situated on low ground, which in winter is saturated\r\nwith water which stands in the furrows, and makes the footpaths leading\r\nto the house impassable except to water-tight boots. This must, and\r\nundoubtedly does affect the health of the inmates, and hence probably\r\nthe prevalence of rheumatism. The site upon which the house stands\r\nshould be so drained as to carry off the water. Some soils contract to\r\nan appreciable extent in a continuance of drought, and expand in an\r\nequal degree with wet--a fact apparent to any one who walks across a\r\nfield where the soil is clay, in a dry time, when the deep, wide cracks\r\ncannot be overlooked. Alternate swelling and contraction of the earth\r\nunder the foundations of a house produce a partial dislocation of the\r\nbrickwork, and hence it is common enough to see cracks running up the\r\nwalls. Had the site been properly drained, and the earth consequently\r\nalways dry, this would not have happened; and it is a matter of\r\nconsideration for the landlord, who in time may find it necessary to\r\nshore up a wall with a buttress. The great difference in the temperature\r\nof a drained soil and an undrained one has often been observed,\r\namounting sometimes to as much as twenty degrees--a serious matter where\r\nhealth is concerned. A foolish custom was observed in the building of\r\nmany old farmhouses, _i.e._, of carrying beams of wood across the\r\nchimney--a practice that has led to disastrous fires. The soot\r\naccumulates. These huge cavernous chimneys are rarely swept, and at last\r\ncatch alight and smoulder for many days: presently fire breaks out in\r\nthe middle of a room under which the beam passes.\r\n\r\nHouses erected in blocks or in towns do not encounter the full force of\r\nthe storms of winter to the same degree as a solitary farmhouse,\r\nstanding a quarter or half-a-mile from any other dwelling. This is the\r\nreason why the old farmers planted elm-trees and encouraged the growth\r\nof thick hawthorn hedges close to the homestead. The north-east and the\r\nsouth-west are the quarters from whence most is to be dreaded: the\r\nnorth-east for the bitter wind which sweeps along and grows colder from\r\nthe damp, wet meadows it passes over; and the south-west for the driving\r\nrain, lasting sometimes for days and weeks together. Trees and hedges\r\nbreak the force of the gales, and in summer shelter from the glaring\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nThe architectural arrangement of the farmhouse just described gives\r\nalmost perfect privacy. Except visitors, no one comes to the front door\r\nor passes unpleasantly close to the windows. Labourers and others all go\r\nto the courtyard at the back. The other plans upon which farmsteads are\r\nbuilt are far from affording similar privacy. There are some which, in\r\nfact, are nothing but an enlarged and somewhat elongated cottage, with\r\nthe dwelling-rooms at one end and the dairy and offices at the other,\r\nand the bedrooms over both. Everybody and everything brought to or taken\r\nfrom the place has to pass before the dwelling-room windows--a most\r\nunpleasant arrangement. Another style is square, with low stone walls\r\nwhitewashed, and thatched roof of immense height. Against it is a\r\nlean-to, the eaves of the roof of which are hardly three feet from the\r\nground. So high-pitched a roof necessitates the employment of a great\r\namount of woodwork, and the upper rooms have sloping ceilings. They may\r\nlook picturesque from a distance, but are inconvenient and uncouth\r\nwithin, and admirably calculated for burning. A somewhat superior\r\ndescription is built in the shape of a carpenter's \"square.\" The\r\ndwelling-rooms form, as it were, one house, and the offices, dairy and\r\ncheese-loft are added on at one end at right angles. The courtyard is in\r\nthe triangular space between. For some things this is a convenient\r\narrangement; but there still remains the disagreeableness of the noise,\r\nand, at times, strong odours from the courtyard under the windows of the\r\ndwelling-house. Nearly all farmsteads have awkwardly low ceilings, which\r\nin a town would cause a close atmosphere, but are not so injurious in\r\nthe open country, with doors constantly ajar. In erecting a modern house\r\nthis defect would, of course, be avoided. The great thickness of the\r\nwalls is sometimes a deception; for in pulling down old buildings it is\r\noccasionally found that the interior of the wall is nothing but loose\r\nbroken stones and bricks enclosed or rammed in between two walls. The\r\nstaircases are generally one of the worst features of the old houses,\r\nbeing between a wall and a partition--narrow, dark, steep, and awkwardly\r\nplaced, and without windows or handrails. These houses were obviously\r\nbuilt for a people living much out of doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_JOHN SMITH'S SHANTY._\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was standing in the ditch leaning heavily upon the long handle of his\r\naxe. It was a straight stick of ash, roughly shaved down to some sort of\r\nsemblance of smoothness, such as would have worked up an unpractised\r\nhand into a mass of blisters in ten minutes' usage, but which glided\r\neasily through those horny palms, leaving no mark of friction. The\r\ncontinuous outdoor labour, the beating of innumerable storms, and the\r\nhard, coarse fare, had dried up all the original moisture of the hand,\r\ntill it was rough, firm, and cracked or chapped like a piece of wood\r\nexposed to the sun and weather. The natural oil of the skin, which gives\r\nto the hand its beautiful suppleness and delicate sense of touch, was\r\ngone like the sap in the tree he was felling, for it was early in the\r\nwinter. However the brow might perspire, there was no dampness on the\r\nhand, and the helve of the axe was scarcely harder and drier. In order,\r\ntherefore, that the grasp might be firm, it was necessary to\r\nartificially wet the palms, and hence that custom which so often\r\ndisgusts lookers-on, of spitting on the hands before commencing work.\r\nThis apparently gratuitous piece of dirtiness is in reality absolutely\r\nnecessary. Men with hands in this state have hardly any feeling in them;\r\nthey find it difficult to pick up anything small, as a pin--the fingers\r\nfumble over it; and as for a pen, they hold it like a hammer. His chest\r\nwas open to the north wind, which whistled through the bare branches of\r\nthe tall elm overhead as if they were the cordage of a ship, and came in\r\nsudden blasts through the gaps in the hedge, blowing his shirt back, and\r\nexposing the immense breadth of bone, and rough dark skin tanned to a\r\nbrown-red by the summer sun while mowing. The neck rose from it short\r\nand thick like that of a bull, and the head was round, and covered with\r\na crop of short grizzled hair not yet quite grey, but fast losing its\r\noriginal chestnut colour. The features were fairly regular, but coarse,\r\nand the nose flattened. An almost worn-out old hat thrown back on the\r\nhead showed a low, broad, wrinkled forehead. The eyes were small and\r\nbleared, set deep under shaggy eyebrows. The corduroy trousers, yellow\r\nwith clay and sand, were shortened below the knee by leather straps like\r\ngarters, so as to exhibit the whole of the clumsy boots, with soles like\r\nplanks, and shod with iron at heel and tip. These boots weigh seven\r\npounds the pair; and in wet weather, with clay and dirt clinging to\r\nthem, must reach nearly double that.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the magnificent muscular development which this man\r\npossessed, there was nothing of the Hercules about him. The grace of\r\nstrength was wanting, the curved lines were lacking; all was gaunt,\r\nangular, and square. The chest was broad enough, but flat, a framework\r\nof bones hidden by a rough hairy skin; the breasts did not swell up like\r\nthe rounded prominences of the antique statue. The neck, strong enough\r\nas it was to bear the weight of a sack of corn with ease, was too short,\r\nand too much a part, as it were, of the shoulders. It did not rise up\r\nlike a tower, distinct in itself; and the muscles on it, as they moved,\r\nproduced hollow cavities distressing to the eye. It was strength\r\nwithout beauty; a mechanical kind of power, like that of an engine,\r\nworking through straight lines and sharp angles. There was too much of\r\nthe machine, and too little of the animal; the lithe, easy motion of the\r\nlion or the tiger was not there. The impression conveyed was, that such\r\nstrength had been gained through a course of incessant exertion of the\r\nrudest kind, unassisted by generous food and checked by unnatural\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nJohn Smith heaved up his axe and struck at the great bulging roots of\r\nthe elm, from which he had cleared away the earth with his spade. A\r\nheavy chip flew out with a dull thud on the sward. The straight handle\r\nof the axe increased the labour of the work, for in this curiously\r\nconservative country the American improvement of the double curved\r\nhandle has not yet been adopted. Chip after chip fell in the ditch, or\r\nwent spinning out into the field. The axe rose and fell with a slow,\r\nmonotonous motion. Though there was immense strength in every blow,\r\nthere was no vigour in it. Suddenly, while it was swinging in the air\r\noverhead, there came the faint, low echo of a distant railway whistle,\r\nand the axe was dropped at once, without even completing the blow.\r\n\"That's the express,\" he muttered, and began cleaning the dirt from his\r\nshoes. The daily whistle of the express was the signal for luncheon.\r\nHastily throwing on a slop hung on the bushes, and over that a coat, he\r\npicked up a small bag, and walked slowly off down the side of the hedge\r\nto where the highway road went by. Here he sat down, somewhat sheltered\r\nby a hawthorn bush, in the ditch, facing the road, and drew out his\r\nbread and cheese.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of a loaf of bread, or nearly, and one slice of cheese\r\nwas this full-grown and powerful man's dinner that cold, raw winter's\r\nday. His drink was a pint of cold weak tea, kept in a tin can, for these\r\nmen are moderate enough with liquor at their meals, whatever they may be\r\nat other times. He held the bread in his left hand and the cheese was\r\nplaced on it, and kept in its place by the thumb, the grimy dirt on\r\nwhich was shielded by a small piece of bread beneath it from the\r\nprecious cheese. His plate and dish was his broad palm, his only\r\nimplement a great jack-knife with a buck-horn handle. He ate slowly,\r\nthoughtfully, deliberately; weighing each mouthful, chewing the cud as\r\nit were. All the man's motions were heavy and slow, deadened as if\r\nclogged with a great load. There was no \"life\" in him. What little\r\nanimation there was left had taken him to eat his dinner by the\r\nroadside--the instinct of sociality--that if possible he might exchange\r\na word with some one passing. In factories men work in gangs, and\r\nhundreds are often within call of each other; a rough joke or an\r\noccasional question can be put and answered; there is a certain amount\r\nof sympathy, a sensation of company and companionship. But alone in the\r\nfields, the human instinct of friendship is checked, the man is driven\r\nback upon himself and his own narrow range of thought, till the mind and\r\nheart grow dull, and there only remains such a vague ill-defined want as\r\ncarried John Smith to the roadside that day.\r\n\r\nHe had finished his cheese and lit a short clay pipe, and thrust his\r\nhands deep in his pockets, when there was a rustling noise in the hedge\r\na little farther down, and a short man jumped out into the road--even\r\njumping with his hands in his pockets. He saw Smith directly and came\r\ntowards him, and sat himself on a heap of flints used for mending the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\"What's thee at to-day?\" asked John, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Ditching,\" said the other laconically, pushing out one foot by way of\r\nillustrating the fact. It was covered with black mud far above the\r\nankle, and there were splashes of mud up to his waist--his hands, as he\r\nproceeded to light his pipe, were black, too, from the same cause.\r\n\r\n\"Thee's bin in main deep,\" said John, after a slow survey of the other's\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe fellow stamped his boot on the ground, and the slime and slush oozed\r\nout of it and formed a puddle. \"That's pretty stuff to stand in for a\r\nman of sixty-four, yent it, John?\" With a volubility and energy of\r\nspeech little to be expected from his wizened appearance, the hedger and\r\nditcher entered into details of his job. He began work at six that\r\nmorning with stiff legs and swollen feet, and as he stood in the mingled\r\nmire and water, the rheumatism came gradually on, rising higher up his\r\nlimbs from the ankles, and growing sharper with every twinge, while the\r\ncold and bitter wind cut through his thin slop on his chest, which was\r\nnot so strong as it used to be. His arms got stiff with the labour of\r\nlifting up shovelful after shovelful of heavy mud to plaster the side of\r\nthe ditch, his feet turned cold as \"flints,\" and the sickly smell of the\r\nslime upset his stomach so that when he tried to eat his bread and\r\ncheese he could not. Through this speech John smoked steadily on, till\r\nthe other stopped and looked at him for sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jim, anyhow,\" said Smith, \"thee hasn't got far to walk to the\r\njob;\" and he pointed with the stem of his pipe to the low roof of a\r\ncottage just visible a few hundred yards distant.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, and a place it be to live in, that,\" said Jim. There were only two\r\nrooms, he explained, and both downstairs--no upstairs at all--and the\r\nfirst of these was so small he could reach across it, and the thatch had\r\ngot so thin in one place that the rain came through. The floor was only\r\nhard mud, and the garden not big enough to grow a sack of potatoes,\r\nwhile one wall of the house, which was only \"wattle and daub\" (_i.e._,\r\nlath and plaster), rose up from the very edge of a great stagnant pond.\r\nOverhead there was an elm, from the branches of which in wet weather\r\nthere was a perpetual drip, drip on the thatch, till the moss and grass\r\ngrew on the roof in profusion. All the sewage and drainage from the\r\ncottage ran into the pond, over which at night there was almost always a\r\nthick damp mist, which crept in through the crevices of the rotten\r\nwalls, and froze the blood in the sleepers' veins. Sometimes a flood\r\ncame down, and the pond rose and washed away the cabbages from the\r\ngarden, leaving a deposit of gritty sand which killed all vegetation,\r\nand they could only keep the water from coming indoors by making a small\r\ndam of clay across the doorway. There was only a low hedge of elder\r\nbetween the cottage and a dirty lane; and in the night, especially if\r\nthere happened to be a light burning, it was common enough for a stone\r\nto come through the window, flung by some half-drunken ploughboy. A\r\npretty place for a human being to live in: and again he looked up into\r\nSmith's face for comment.\r\n\r\n\"Thee built 'un thee-self, didn't 'ee?\" said John, in his slow way.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that I did,\" continued Jim, not seeing the drift of the remark. He\r\nnot only built it, but he brought up nineteen children in it, and\r\nfourteen of them lived to grow up, all the offspring of one wife. And a\r\ntime she had of it, too. None of them ever fell in that pond, though he\r\noften wished they would; and they were all pretty healthy, which was a\r\nbad thing, because it made them hungry, and if they had been ill the\r\nparish would have kept them. All that he had done on 12s. a week, and he\r\nminded the time when it was only 9s., ay, and even when it was 6s., and\r\n'twas better then than it was now with 15s. That was before the Unions\r\ncame about, in the time of the old workhouses in every parish. Then the\r\nfarmers used to find everybody a job. Every morning they had to go round\r\nfrom one farmer to the other, and if there was no work then they went to\r\nthe workhouse, or sometimes to the vestry-room in the church, where\r\nevery man had a loaf of bread for every head there was in his family, so\r\nthat the more children he had the more loaves of bread, which was a\r\ncapital thing when the children were small. He had known a man in those\r\ntimes sent seven miles with a wheelbarrow to fetch a barrow load of coal\r\nfrom the canal wharf, and then have to wheel it back seven miles, and\r\nget one shilling for his day's work. Still they were better times than\r\nthese, because the farmers for their own sake were forced to find the\r\nfellows something to do; but now they did not care, and it was a hard\r\nthing to find work, especially when a man grew old, and stiff about the\r\njoints. Now the Boards of Guardians would not give any relief unless the\r\napplicants were ill, or not able-bodied, and even then they were often\r\nrequired to break stones, and he was very much inclined to throw his\r\nspade in that old pond and go to the Union with the \"missis\" and all the\r\nlot for good. He had the rheumatism bad enough. It would serve them\r\nright. He had worked \"nigh handy\" sixty years; and all he had got by it\r\nhe could put in his eye. They ought to keep him now. It was not half so\r\ngood as the old times for all the talk; then the children could bring\r\nhome a bit of wood out of the hedges to boil the pot with, but now they\r\nmust not touch a stick, or there was the law on them in a minute. And\r\nthen coal at the price it was. Why didn't his sons keep him? Where were\r\nthey? One was a soldier, and another had gone to America, and the third\r\nwas married and had a hard job to keep himself, and the fourth was gone\r\nnobody knew where. As for the wenches, they were no good in that way. So\r\nhe and his \"missis\" muddled on at home with three of the youngest. And\r\nthey could not let them alone even in that. He did go into the Union\r\nworkhouse for a bit, a while ago, when the rheumatism was extraordinary\r\nbad, but some of the guardians smelt out that he had a cottage of his\r\nown, and it was against the law to relieve anybody that had property; so\r\nhe must pay back the relief as a loan or sell the cottage. He was\r\noffered L25 for the place and garden, and he meant to have taken it, but\r\nwhen they came to look into the writings it was not clear that he could\r\nsell it. It was quit-rent land, and although the landlord had not taken\r\nthe rent for twenty years, yet he had entered it in his book as paid\r\n(out of good nature), and the lawyers said it could not be done. But as\r\nthey would not let him sell it, he would not turn out, not he. There he\r\nwould stop--just to spite them. He knew that nook of his was wanted for\r\ncattle stalls on the new principle, and very handy it would be with all\r\nthat water close at hand, but he had worked for sixty years, and had had\r\nnineteen children there, and he would not turn out. Not he. The parson's\r\n\"missis\" and the squire's \"missis\" came the other day about that\r\nyoungest boy of his. They wanted to get him into some school up in\r\nLondon somewhere, but he remembered how the squire had served him just\r\nfor picking up a dead rabbit that laid in his path one hard snow time.\r\nSix weeks in gaol because he could not pay the fine. And the parson\r\nturned him out of his allotment because he saw him stagger a little in\r\nthe road one night with the rheumatism. It was a lie that he was drunk.\r\nAnd suppose he was? The parson had his wine, he reckoned. They should\r\nnot have his boy. He rather hoped he would grow up a bad one, and bother\r\nthem well. He minded when that sharp old Miss ---- was always coming\r\nround with tracts and blankets, like taking some straw to a lot of pigs,\r\nand lecturing his \"missis\" about economy. What a fuss she made, and\r\nscolded his wife as if she was a thief for having that fifteenth boy!\r\nHis \"missis\" turned on her at last, and said, \"Lor, miss, that's all the\r\npleasure me an' my old man got.\" As for this talk about the labourers'\r\nUnions, it was all very well for the young men; but it made it worse\r\nstill for the old ones. The farmers, if they had to give such a price,\r\nwould have young men in full strength: there was no chance at all for an\r\nold fellow of sixty-four with rheumatism. Some of them, too, were\r\nterribly offended--some of the old sort--and turned off the few\r\npensioners they had kept on at odd jobs for years. However, he supposed\r\nhe must get back to that ditch again.\r\n\r\nThis long oration was delivered not without a certain degree of power\r\nand effect, showing that the man, whatever his faults, might with\r\ntraining have become rather a clever fellow. The very way in which he\r\ncontradicted himself, and announced his intention of never doing that\r\nwhich a moment before he was determined on, was not without an amount of\r\noratorical art, since the turn in his view of the subject was led up to\r\nby a variety of reasons which were supposed to convince himself and his\r\nhearer at the same time. His remarks were all the more effective because\r\nthere was an evident substratum of stern truth beneath them. But they\r\nfailed to make much impression on Smith, who saw his companion depart\r\nwithout a word.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that Smith was too well acquainted with the private life\r\nof the orator. In his dull, dim way, he half recognised that the\r\nunfortunate old fellow's evils had been in great part of his own\r\ncreating. He knew that he was far from faultless. That poaching\r\nbusiness--a very venial offence in a labourer's eyes--he knew had been a\r\nserious one, a matter of some two-score pheasants and a desperate fight\r\nwith a gang. Looking at it as property, the squire had been merciful,\r\npleading with the magistrates for a mitigated penalty. The drunkenness\r\nwas habitual. In short, they were a bad lot--there was a name attached\r\nto the whole family for thieving, poaching, drinking, and even worse.\r\nYet still there were two points that did sink deep into Smith's mind,\r\nand made him pause several times that afternoon in his work. The first\r\nwas that long family of nineteen mouths, with the father and mother\r\nmaking twenty-one. What a number of sins, in the rude logic of the\r\nstruggle for existence, that terrible fact glossed over! Who could\r\nblame--what labourer at least could blame--the ragged, ill-clothed\r\nchildren for taking the dead wood from the hedges to warm their naked\r\nlimbs? What labourer could blame the father for taking the hares and\r\nrabbits running across his very path to fill that wretched hovel with\r\nsavoury steam from the pot? And further, what labourer could blame the\r\nmiserable old man for drowning his feelings, and his sensation of cold\r\nand hunger, in liquor?\r\n\r\nThe great evil of these things is that a fellow-feeling will arise with\r\nthe wrong-doer, till the original distinction between right and wrong is\r\nlost sight of entirely. John Smith had a family too. The other point was\r\nthe sixty years of labour and their fruit. After two generations of\r\nhardest toil and rudest exposure, still dependent upon the seasons even\r\nto permit him to work, when that work could be obtained. No rest, no\r\ncosy fireside nook: still the bitter wind, and the half-frozen slime\r\nand slush rising above the ankle. In an undefined way Smith had been\r\nproud of his broad, enormous strength, and rocklike hardihood. He had\r\nfelt a certain rude pleasure in opening his broad chest to the winter\r\nwind. But now he involuntarily closed his shirt and buttoned it. He did\r\nnot feel so confident in his own power of meeting all the contingencies\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\nThought without method and without logical sequence is apt to press\r\nheavily upon the uneducated mind. It was thus that these reflections\r\nleft a sensation of weight and discomfort upon Smith, and it was in a\r\nworse humour than was common to his usually well-balanced organisation\r\nthat he hid away his tools under the bushes as the evening grew too dark\r\nfor work, and slowly paced homewards. He had some two miles to walk, and\r\nhe had long since begun to feel hungry. Plodding along in a heavy,\r\nuneven gait, there overtook him a tall, raw young lad of eighteen or\r\ntwenty, slouching forward with vast strides and whistling merrily. The\r\nlad slackened his steps and joined company!\r\n\r\n\"Where bist thee working now, then?\" asked Smith.\r\n\r\nHe replied, evidently in high spirits, that he had that day got a job at\r\nthe new railway that was making. The wages were 18s. a week--3s. a\r\nday--and he had heard that as soon as the men grew to understand their\r\nwork and to be a little skilful, they could get 24s. easily, up by\r\nLondon. The only drawback was the long walk to the work. Lodgings close\r\nat hand were very dear, as also was food, so dear as to lower the actual\r\nreceipts to an equality, if not below that of the agricultural labourer.\r\nFour miles every morning and every night was the price he paid for 18s.\r\na week.\r\n\r\nSmith began in his slow, dull way to reckon up his wages aloud against\r\nthis. First he had 13s. a week for his daily work. Then he had 1s. extra\r\nfor milking on Sundays, and two good meals with beer on that day. Every\r\nweek-day he had a pint of beer on finishing work. The young navvy had to\r\nfind his own liquor. His cottage, it was true, was his own (that is, he\r\nonly paid a low quit-rent of 1s. a year for it), so that that could not\r\nbe reckoned in as part of his earnings, as it could with many other\r\nmen. But the navvy's wages were the same all the year round, while his\r\nin summer were often nearly double. As a stalwart mower he could earn\r\n25s. a week and more, as a haymaker 18s., and at harvesting perhaps 30s.\r\nIf the season was good, and there was a press for hands, he would get\r\nmore. But, looking forward, there was no prospect of rising higher in\r\nhis trade, of getting higher wages for more skilful work. He could not\r\nbe more skilful than he was in ordinary farm work; and as yet the call\r\nfor clever men to attend to machinery, &c., was very limited; nor were\r\nsuch a class of workmen usually drawn from the resident population where\r\nimprovements were introduced. The only hope of higher wages that was\r\nheld out to him was from the gradual rise of everything, or the forced\r\nrise consequent upon agitation. But, said he, the navvy must follow his\r\nwork from place to place, and lodgings are dear in the towns, and the\r\nfarmers in country places will not let their cottages except to their\r\nown labourers--how was the navvy even with higher wages to keep a wife?\r\nThe aspiring young fellow beside him replied at once sharply and\r\ndecisively, that he did not mean to have a wife, leastways not till he\r\nhad got his regular 30s. a week, which he might in time. Then John Smith\r\nmade a noise in his chest like a grunt.\r\n\r\nThey parted after this. Smith went into the farmhouse, and got his pint\r\nof beer, drinking it in one long slow draught, and then made his way\r\nthrough the scattered village to his cottage. There was a frown on his\r\nforehead as he lifted the latch of the long low thatched building which\r\nwas his home.\r\n\r\nThe flickering light of the fire on the hearth, throwing great shadows\r\nas it blazed up and fell, dazed his eyes as he stepped in, and he did\r\nnot notice a line stretched right across the room on which small\r\narticles of clothing were hanging to dry in a row. A damp worsted\r\nstocking flapped against his face, and his foot stumbled on the uneven\r\nflag stones which formed the floor. He sat down silently upon a\r\nthree-legged stool--an old milking-stool--and, putting his hands on his\r\nknees, stared into the fire. It was formed of a few sticks with just one\r\nknob of coal balanced on the top of them, evident care having been\r\ntaken that not a jot of its precious heat should be lost. A great black\r\npot with open lid swung over it, from which rose a slight steam and a\r\nbubbling noise; and this huge, gaunt, bareboned, hungry man, looking\r\ninto it, saw a large raw swede, just as from the field, with only the\r\ngreens cut off, simmering for his supper. That root in its day of life\r\nhad been fed well with superphosphate, and flourished exceedingly, till\r\nnow its globe could hardly go into the pot. Down the low chimney there\r\ncame the monotonous growl of the bitter winter wind, and a few spots of\r\nrain fell hissing on the embers.\r\n\r\n\"Is this all thee has got?\" he asked, turning to a woman who was busied\r\nwith some more damp clothes in a basket.\r\n\r\nShe faced round quickly--a short, narrow, meagre creature, flat-chested\r\nand square-shouldered, whose face was the hue of light-coloured clay, an\r\nalmost corpse-like complexion. Her thin lips hissed out, \"Ay, if thee\r\ntakes thee money to the pothouse thee won't get bacon for supper.\"\r\n\r\nSmith said nothing in reply, but stared again into the fire.\r\n\r\nThe children's voices, which had lowered the moment there seemed a\r\ncoming quarrel between their parents, rose again. There were three of\r\nthem--the youngest four, the eldest seven--playing on the stone flags of\r\nthe floor, between whose rough edges there were wide crevices of\r\nhardened mud. With a few short sticks and a broken piece of earthenware\r\nfor toys, they were happy in their way. Whatever their food might have\r\nbeen, they showed no traces of hard usage. Their red \"puddy\" fists were\r\nfat, and their naked legs round and plump enough. Their faces were full\r\nand rosy, and their voices clear and anything but querulous. The eager\r\npassions of childhood come out fierce and unrestrained, and blows were\r\nfreely interchanged, without, however, either cries or apparent hatred.\r\nTheir naked knees were on the stone-flags, and the wind, creeping in a\r\ndraught under the ill-fitting door, blew their ragged clothes about.\r\n\r\n\"Thee med well look at 'em, John,\" said the woman, seeing Smith cast a\r\nsideway glance at the children; and rapidly manipulating the clothing,\r\nher thin nervous lips poured forth a torrent of words upon the silent\r\nman. They had had nothing but bread that day, and nothing but bread and\r\nlard the day before, and now the lard was gone, and the baker would not\r\ntrust any more. There were no potatoes because the disease had destroyed\r\nthem, and the cabbages were sold for that bit of coal; and as for the\r\nswede, she took it out of Mr. ----'s field, and he was a cross-grained\r\nman, and who knew but what they might have the constable on them before\r\nmorning? Jane W. and Sarah Y. went to prison for seven days for stealing\r\nswedes. All along of that cursed drink. If she were the squire she'd\r\nshut up all the pothouses in the county. The men went there, and drank\r\nthe very shirts off their backs, and the clothes off their children, ay,\r\nand the shoes off their feet; and what was the use of their having more\r\nmoney when it only went into the publican's pocket? There they sat, and\r\ndrank the bread out of the babies' mouths. As for the women, the most of\r\nthem, poor things, never tasted beer from one year's end to another. Old\r\nCarter handed her a pint that day, and when she tasted it she did not\r\nknow what it was. He might smile, but it was true though: no more did\r\nJane W. and Sally Y.: they did not know what it tasted like. And yet\r\nthey had to be out in the fields at work at eight o'clock, and their\r\nwashing to do before that, and perhaps a baby in their arms, and the tea\r\nas weak as water, and no sugar. Milk, they could not get milk for\r\nmoney--he knew that very well; all the milk went to London. A precious\r\nlot of good the higher wages had done them. The farmers would not let\r\nthem have a drop of milk or a scrap of victuals, and talked about rising\r\nthe price of the allotment grounds. Allotment, did she say? and how did\r\nhe lose his allotment?--didn't he drink, drink, drink, till he had to\r\nhand over his allotment to the landlord of the pothouse, and did not\r\nthey take it away from both as soon as they heard of it? Served him\r\nright. They had not got a pound of potatoes, and the children did use to\r\nlick up the potato-pot liquor as if they liked it.\r\n\r\nSmith asked where Polly was, but that was only a signal for a fresh\r\noutburst. Polly, if he'd a looked after her she would have been all\r\nright. (Smith turned a sharp glance at her in some alarm at this.)\r\nLetting a great girl like that go about at night by herself while he\r\nwas a drink, drink, drinking, and there she was now, the bad hussy, gone\r\nto the workhouse to lie in. (Smith winced.) _She_ never disgraced\r\nherself like that; and if he had sent the wench to service, or stopped\r\nher going down to that pothouse with the fellows, this would not have\r\nhappened. She always told him how it would end. He was a\r\ngood-for-nothing, drunken brute of a man, and had brought her to all\r\nthis misery; and she began sobbing.\r\n\r\nAfter twelve long hours of toil, including the walk to and fro, exposed\r\nto the bitter cold, with but a slice of cheese to support the strength\r\nof that brawny chest, this welcome to his supper was more than the\r\nsturdy, silent man could bear. With a dull remembrance of the happy\r\nsunlit summer, twenty years ago, when Martha was a plump, laughing girl,\r\nof sloe-black eyes and nut-brown complexion--with a glimpse of that\r\nmerry courting time passing across his mind, Smith got up and walked out\r\ninto the dark rainy night. \"Ay, thee bist agoing to the liquor again,\"\r\nwere the last words he heard as he shut the door.\r\n\r\nIt was too true. But what labourer, let us ask, with a full conception\r\nof the circumstances, would blame him? Here there was nothing but hard\r\nand scanty fare, no heat, no light, nothing to cheer the heart, nothing\r\nto cause it to forget the toil of the day and the thought of the morrow,\r\nno generous liquor sung by poets to warm the physical man. But only a\r\nfew yards farther down the road there was a great house, with its\r\nshutters cosily closed, ablaze with heat and light, echoing with merry\r\nlaughter and song. There was an array of good fellows ready to welcome\r\nhim, to tell him the news, to listen eagerly to what he could tell them,\r\nto ask him to drink, and to drink from his cup in boon companionship.\r\nThere was a social circle in which his heart and intellect could expand,\r\nat least for a while, till the strong liquor mounted up and overcame his\r\nbrain; and then, even then, there was the forgetfulness, the deep\r\nslumber of intoxication, utterly oblivious of all things--perhaps the\r\ngreatest pleasure of all. Smith went there, and who of his own class\r\nwould blame him? And if his own class did not, of what use is it for\r\nother and higher classes to preach morality to him? It is a man's own\r\ncomrades, his own class, whose opinions he dreads and conforms to. If\r\nthey condemned him for going there, he would avoid the public-house. But\r\nthey would have called him a fool if he avoided it. In their logic who\r\ncould say they were wrong? A man who is happy is a long while getting\r\ndrunk, he talks as much as he drinks; but Smith was dull and silent, and\r\ndrank steadily. It was not late, but when the house closed he could but\r\njust keep his feet. In the thick darkness and the driving rain he\r\nstaggered on, unconscious of the road he was taking, but bearing roughly\r\ntowards home. The cold air rather more stupefied him than brought him to\r\nhimself. Insensibly he wandered with uncertain steps down a lane which\r\nled by a gentle slope out into the fields, the fall of the ground\r\nguiding his footsteps, and then stumbling over the root of an ash-tree,\r\nfell heavily on the wet grass. His eyes, half-shut before, closed as if\r\nby clockwork, and in a moment he was firm asleep. His hat had fallen\r\nfrom his brow, and the grizzled hair was blown about by the wind as it\r\ncame in gusts through the hedge. His body was a little sheltered by the\r\ntree, but his chest was open and bare half-way down his waistcoat; and\r\nthe heavy drops fell from the boughs of the ash on his stalwart neck,\r\ngradually saturating his shirt. It may have been that the cold numbed\r\nhim and rendered him more insensible than he otherwise would have been.\r\nNo star shone out that night; all was darkness, clouds, and rain till\r\nthe dawn broke.\r\n\r\nSoon after dawn, the young navvy, going to his work by a short cut,\r\nfound Smith still asleep, and shook him till he got up. He was stupid\r\nbeyond all power of words to express; but at last came to a dim idea\r\nthat he must get home. Then the young navvy left him, anxious about\r\nbeing late at his employment, and John Smith slowly _felt_ his way to\r\nhis own door. His wife, already up, opened it. \"Thee varmint! thee never\r\ngi'ed I that shilling last night for the baker.\" Smith felt hopelessly\r\nin his pocket, and then looked at her vacantly. \"Thee drunken, nasty\r\nold----,\" said the infuriated woman, almost unconsciously lifting her\r\nhand. Perhaps it was that action of hers which suggested the same to his\r\nmind, which was in a mechanical state. Perhaps the stinging words of\r\nlast night had at last sunk deep enough to scarify his self-esteem.\r\nPerhaps he did not at that moment fully remember the strength of his own\r\nmighty arm. But he struck her, and she fell. Her forehead came in\r\ncontact with the cradle, in which the youngest boy was sleeping, and\r\nwoke him with a cry. She lay quite still. Smith sat stupidly down on the\r\nold milking-stool, with his elbows on his knees. The shrill voice of his\r\nwife, as she met him at the door, had brought more than one female\r\nneighbour to the window; they saw what happened, and they were there in\r\na minute. Martha was only insensible, and they soon brought her to, but\r\nthe mark on the temple remained.\r\n\r\nFive days afterwards John Smith, agricultural labourer, aged forty-five,\r\nstood in the dock to answer a charge of assaulting his wife. There were\r\nfive magistrates on the Bench--two large landowners, a baronet in the\r\nchair, and two clergymen. Martha Smith hung her head as they placed her\r\nin the witness-box, and tried to evade kissing the Book, but the police\r\nsaw that that formality was complied with. The Clerk asked her what she\r\nhad to complain of. No answer. \"Come, tell us all about it,\" said the\r\neldest of the magistrates in a fatherly tone of voice. Still silence.\r\n\"Well, how did you get that mark on your forehead?\" asked the Clerk. No\r\nanswer. \"Speak up!\" cried a shrill voice in the body of the court. It\r\nwas one of Martha's cronies, who was immediately silenced by the police;\r\nbut the train had been fired. Martha would not fail before another\r\nwoman. But she did not commence about the assault. It was the drink she\r\nspoke of, nothing but the drink; and as she talked of that she warmed\r\nwith her subject and her grievances, and forgot the old love for her\r\nhusband, and her former hesitation, and placed that vice in all its\r\nnaked deformity and hideous results in plain but burning words before\r\nthe Bench. Had she been the cleverest advocate she could not have\r\nprepared the ground for her case better. This tale of drink predisposed\r\ntheir minds against the defendant. Only the Clerk, wedded to legal\r\nforms, fidgeted under this eloquence, and seized the first pause: \"But\r\nnow, how about the assault? Come to that,\" he said sharply. \"I'm coming,\r\nsir,\" said Martha; and she described Smith coming home, stupid and\r\nferocious, after staying out all night, and felling her to the ground\r\nbecause she asked him for a shilling to buy the children's daily bread.\r\nThen she pointed to the bruise on her forehead, and a suppressed murmur\r\nof indignation ran through the Court, and angry looks were directed at\r\nthe defendant. Did she do or say anything to provoke the blow? asked the\r\nChairman. No more than to ask for the shilling. Did she not abuse him?\r\nWell, yes, she did; she owned she did call him a drunken brute\r\nafterwards; she could not help it. These women, with their rapid\r\ntongues, have a terrible advantage over the slower-witted men.\r\n\r\nHad the defendant any questions to ask his wife? Smith began to say that\r\nhe was very sorry, sir, but the Clerk snapped him up short. \"That's your\r\ndefence. Have you any questions? No; well, call your witnesses.\" Martha\r\ncalled her witnesses, the women living next door. They did not do her\r\ncase much good; they were too evidently eager to obtain the defendant's\r\ncondemnation. But, on the other hand, they did not do it any harm, for\r\nin the main it was easy to see that they really corroborated her\r\nstatements. Smith asked them no questions; the labouring class rarely\r\nunderstand the object of cross-questioning. If asked to do so they\r\nalmost invariably begin to tell their own tale.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then,\" said the Clerk, \"what have you got to say for\r\nyourself--what's your defence?\" Smith looked down and stammered\r\nsomething. He was confused; they checked him from telling his story when\r\nhis mouth was full of language, now it would not come. He did not know\r\nbut that if he began he might be checked again. The eldest magistrate on\r\nthe Bench saw his embarrassment, and, willing to assist him, spoke as\r\nkindly as he could under the circumstances. \"Speak up, John; tell us all\r\nabout it. I am sorry to see you there.\" \"He's the finest, most stalwart\r\nman in my parish,\" he continued, turning to the Chairman. Thus\r\nencouraged, John got out a word or two. He was very sorry; he did not\r\nmean to hurt her; he knew he was tipsy, and 'twas his own fault; she had\r\nbeen a good wife to him; she asked him for money. Then all of a sudden\r\nJohn drew up his form to his full height, and his chest swelled out,\r\nand he spoke in his own strong voice clearly now that he had got a topic\r\napart from his disgrace. These were his words, a little softened into\r\nmore civilised pronunciation to make them intelligible:--\r\n\r\n\"She asked I for money, she did, and what was I to gi'e her? I hadn't a\r\ngot a shilling nor a sixpence, and she knew it, and knowed that I\r\ncouldn't get one either till Saturday night. I gets thirteen shillings a\r\nweek from Master H., and a shilling on Sundays, and I hev got five\r\nchildren and a wife to keep out of that--that's two shillings a week for\r\neach on us, that's just threepence halfpenny a day, look 'ee, sir. And\r\nwhat victuals be I to buy wi' that, let alone beer? and a man can't do\r\nno work wi'out a quart a day, and that's fourpence, and there's my\r\nshare, look 'ee, gone at onst. Wur be I to get any victuals, and wur be\r\nI to get any clothes an' boots, I should like for to know? And Jack he\r\ngets big and wants a main lot, and so did Polly, but her's gone to the\r\nwork'us', wuss luck. And parson wants I to send the young 'uns to\r\nschool, and pay a penny a week for 'em, and missis she wants a bit o'\r\nbacon in the house and a loaf, and what good is that of, among all we?\r\nI gets a slice of bacon twice a week, and sometimes narn. And beer--I\r\nknows I drinks beer, and more as I ought, but what's a chap to do when\r\nhe's a'most shrammed wi' cold, and nar a bit o' nothin' in the pot but\r\nan old yeller swede as hard as wood? And my teeth bean't as good as 'em\r\nused to be. I knows I drinks beer, and so would anybody in my place--it\r\nmakes me kinder stupid, as I don't feel nothing then. Wot's the\r\ngood--I've worked this thirty year or more, since I wur big enough to go\r\nwith the plough, and I've a knowed they as have worked for nigh handy\r\nsixty, and wot do 'em get for it? All he'd a got wur the rheumatiz. Yer\r\nmed as well drink while 'ee can. I never meaned to hurt her, and her\r\nknows it; and if it wurn't for a parcel of women a-shoving on her on,\r\nher would never a come here agen me. I knows I drinks, and what else be\r\nI to do? I can't work allus.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are you going to say in your defence--do you say she provoked\r\nyou or anything?\" asked the Clerk.\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't know as she provoked I. I wur provoked, though, I wur. I\r\ndon't bear no malice agen she. I ain't a got nothin' more for to say.\"\r\n\r\nThe magistrates retired, and the Chairman, on returning, said that this\r\nwas a most brutal and unprovoked assault, made all the worse by the\r\nprevious drinking habits of the defendant. If it had not been for the\r\ngood character he bore generally speaking (here he looked towards the\r\nelder magistrate, who had evidently said a word in Smith's behalf), he\r\nwould have had a month's imprisonment, or more. As it was, he was\r\ncommitted for a fortnight, and to pay the costs, or seven additional\r\ndays; and he hoped this would be a warning to him.\r\n\r\nThe elder magistrate looked at John Smith, and saw his jaw set firmly,\r\nand his brow contract, and his heart was moved towards him.\r\n\r\n\"Cannot you get better wages than that, John?\" he said. \"At the railway\r\nthey would give you eighteen or twenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's so far to walk, sir, and my legs bean't as lissom as they used to\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"But take the missis and live there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lodgings is too dear, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, exactly. Still I don't see how the farmers could pay you more.\r\nI'll see what can be done for you.\"\r\n\r\nSmith was led from the dock to the cell. The expenses were paid by an\r\nunknown hand; but he underwent his fortnight's imprisonment. His wife\r\nand children, with an empty larder, were obliged to go to the workhouse,\r\nwhere also his daughter was at the same time confined of an illegitimate\r\nchild. This is no fiction, but an uncompromising picture of things as\r\nthey are. Who is to blame for them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_WILTSHIRE LABOURERS._\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER I.\r\n\r\n(_To the Editor of the \"Times.\"_)\r\n\r\nSIR,--The Wiltshire agricultural labourer is not so highly paid as those\r\nof Northumberland, nor so low as those of Dorset; but in the amount of\r\nhis wages, as in intelligence and general position, he may fairly be\r\ntaken as an average specimen of his class throughout a large portion of\r\nthe kingdom.\r\n\r\nAs a man, he is usually strongly built, broad-shouldered, and massive in\r\nframe, but his appearance is spoilt by the clumsiness of his walk and\r\nthe want of grace in his movements. Though quite as large in muscle, it\r\nis very doubtful if he possesses the strength of the seamen who may be\r\nseen lounging about the ports. There is a want of firmness, a certain\r\ndisjointed style, about his limbs, and the muscles themselves have not\r\nthe hardness and tension of the sailor's. The labourer's muscle is that\r\nof a cart-horse, his motions lumbering and slow. His style of walk is\r\ncaused by following the plough in early childhood, when the weak limbs\r\nfind it a hard labour to pull the heavy nailed boots from the thick clay\r\nsoil. Ever afterwards he walks as if it were an exertion to lift his\r\nlegs. His food may, perhaps, have something to do with the deadened\r\nslowness which seems to pervade everything he does--there seems a lack\r\nof vitality about him. It consists chiefly of bread and cheese, with\r\nbacon twice or thrice a week, varied with onions, and if he be a milker\r\n(on some farms) with a good \"tuck-out\" at his employer's expense on\r\nSundays. On ordinary days he dines at the fashionable hour of six or\r\nseven in the evening--that is, about that time his cottage scents the\r\nroad with a powerful odour of boiled cabbage, of which he eats an\r\nimmense quantity. Vegetables are his luxuries, and a large garden,\r\ntherefore, is the greatest blessing he can have. He eats huge onions\r\nraw; he has no idea of flavouring his food with them, nor of making\r\nthose savoury and inviting messes or vegetable soups at which the French\r\npeasantry are so clever. In Picardy I have often dined in a peasant's\r\ncottage, and thoroughly enjoyed the excellent soup he puts upon the\r\ntable for his ordinary meal. To dine in an English labourer's cottage\r\nwould be impossible. His bread is generally good, certainly; but his\r\nbacon is the cheapest he can buy at small second-class shops--oily,\r\nsoft, wretched stuff; his vegetables are cooked in detestable style, and\r\neaten saturated with the pot liquor. Pot liquor is a favourite soup. I\r\nhave known cottagers actually apply at farmers' kitchens not only for\r\nthe pot liquor in which meat has been soddened, but for the water in\r\nwhich potatoes have been boiled--potato liquor--and sup it up with\r\navidity. And this not in times of dearth or scarcity, but rather as a\r\nrelish. They never buy anything but bacon; never butchers' meat.\r\nPhilanthropic ladies, to my knowledge, have demonstrated over and over\r\nagain even to their limited capacities that certain parts of butchers'\r\nmeat can be bought just as cheap, and will make more savoury and\r\nnutritive food; and even now, with the present high price of meat, a\r\ncertain proportion would be advantageous. In vain; the labourers\r\nobstinately adhere to the pig, and the pig only. When, however, an\r\nopportunity does occur the amount of food they will eat is something\r\nastonishing. Once a year, at the village club dinner, they gormandise to\r\nrepletion. In one instance I knew of a man eating a plate of roast beef\r\n(and the slices are cut enormously thick at these dinners), a plate of\r\nboiled beef, then another of boiled mutton, and then a fourth of roast\r\nmutton, and a fifth of ham. He said he could not do much to the bread\r\nand cheese; but didn't he go into the pudding! I have even heard of men\r\nstuffing to the fullest extent of their powers, and then retiring from\r\nthe table to take an emetic of mustard and return to a second gorging.\r\nThere is scarcely any limit to their power of absorbing beer. I have\r\nknown reapers and mowers make it their boast that they could lie on\r\ntheir backs and never take the wooden bottle (in the shape of a small\r\nbarrel) from their lips till they had drunk a gallon, and from the feats\r\nI have seen I verily believe it a fact. The beer they get is usually\r\npoor and thin, though sometimes in harvest the farmers bring out a taste\r\nof strong liquor, but not till the work is nearly over; for from this\r\nvery practice of drinking enormous quantities of small beer the labourer\r\ncannot drink more than a very limited amount of good liquor without\r\ngetting tipsy. This is why he so speedily gets inebriated at the\r\nalehouse. While mowing and reaping many of them lay in a small cask.\r\n\r\nThey are much better clothed now than formerly. Corduroy trousers and\r\nslops are the usual style. Smock-frocks are going out of use, except for\r\nmilkers and faggers. Almost every labourer has his Sunday suit, very\r\noften really good clothes, sometimes glossy black, with the regulation\r\n\"chimneypot.\" His unfortunate walk betrays him, dress how he will. Since\r\nlabour has become so expensive it has become a common remark among the\r\nfarmers that the labourer will go to church in broadcloth and the\r\nmasters in smock-frocks. The labourer never wears gloves--that has to\r\ncome with the march of the times; but he is particularly choice over\r\nhis necktie. The women must dress in the fashion. A very respectable\r\ndraper in an agricultural district was complaining to me the other day\r\nthat the poorest class of women would have everything in the fashionable\r\nstyle, let it change as often as it would. In former times, if he laid\r\nin a stock of goods suited to tradesmen, and farmers' wives and\r\ndaughters, if the fashion changed, or they got out of date, he could\r\ndispose of them easily to the servants. Now no such thing. The quality\r\ndid not matter so much, but the style must be the style of the day--no\r\nsale for remnants. The poorest girl, who had not got two yards of\r\nflannel on her back, must have the same style of dress as the squire's\r\ndaughter--Dolly Vardens, chignons, and parasols for ladies who can work\r\nall day reaping in the broiling sun of August! Gloves, kid, for hands\r\nthat milk the cows!\r\n\r\nThe cottages now are infinitely better than they were. There is scarcely\r\nroom for further improvement in the cottages now erected upon estates.\r\nThey have three bedrooms, and every appliance and comfort compatible\r\nwith their necessarily small size. It is only the cottages erected by\r\nthe labourers themselves on waste plots of ground which are open to\r\nobjection. Those he builds himself are, indeed, as a rule, miserable\r\nhuts, disgraceful to a Christian country. I have an instance before me\r\nat this moment where a man built a cottage with two rooms and no\r\nstaircase or upper apartments, and in those two rooms eight persons\r\nlived and slept--himself and wife, grown-up daughters, and children.\r\nThere was not a scrap of garden attached, not enough to grow\r\nhalf-a-dozen onions. The refuse and sewage was flung into the road, or\r\nfiltered down a ditch into the brook which supplied that part of the\r\nvillage with water. In another case at one time there was a cottage in\r\nwhich twelve persons lived. This had upper apartments, but so low was\r\nthe ceiling that a tall man could stand on the floor, with his head\r\nright through the opening for the staircase, and see along the upper\r\nfloor under the beds! These squatters are the curse of the community. It\r\nis among them that fever and kindred infectious diseases break out; it\r\nis among them that wretched couples are seen bent double with\r\nrheumatism and affections of the joints caused by damp. They have often\r\nbeen known to remain so long, generation after generation, in these\r\nwretched hovels, that at last the lord of the manor, having neglected to\r\nclaim quit-rent, they can defy him, and claim them as their own\r\nproperty, and there they stick, eyesores and blots, the fungi of the\r\nland. The cottages erected by farmers or by landlords are now, one and\r\nall, fit and proper habitations for human beings; and I verily believe\r\nit would be impossible throughout the length and breadth of Wiltshire to\r\nfind a single bad cottage on any large estate, so well and so thoroughly\r\nhave the landed proprietors done their work. On all farms gardens are\r\nattached to the cottages, in many instances very large, and always\r\nsufficient to produce enough vegetables for the resident. In villages\r\nthe allotment system has been greatly extended of late years, and has\r\nbeen found most beneficial, both to owners and tenants. As a rule the\r\nallotments are let at a rate which may be taken as L4 per annum--a sum\r\nwhich pays the landlord very well, and enables the labourer to\r\nremunerate himself. In one village which came under my observation the\r\nclergyman of the parish has turned a portion of his glebe land into\r\nallotments--a most excellent and noble example, which cannot be too\r\nwidely followed or too much extolled. He is thus enabled to benefit\r\nalmost every one of his poor parishioners, and yet without destroying\r\nthat sense of independence which is the great characteristic of a true\r\nEnglishman. He has issued a book of rules and conditions under which\r\nthese allotments are held, and he thus places a strong check upon\r\ndrunkenness and dissolute habits, indulgence in which is a sure way to\r\nlose the portions of ground. There is scarcely an end to the benefits of\r\nthe allotment system. In villages there cannot be extensive gardens, and\r\nthe allotments supply their place. The extra produce above that which\r\nsupplies the table and pays the rent is easily disposed of in the next\r\ntown, and places many additional comforts in the labourer's reach. The\r\nrefuse goes to help support and fatten the labourer's pig, which brings\r\nhim in profit enough to pay the rent of his cottage, and the pig, in\r\nturn, manures the allotment. Some towns have large common lands, held\r\nunder certain conditions; such are Malmesbury, with 500 acres, and\r\nTetbury (the common land of which extends two miles), both these being\r\narable, &c. These are not exactly in the use of labourers, but they are\r\nin the hands of a class to which the labourer often rises. Many\r\nlabourers have fruit-trees in their gardens, which, in some seasons,\r\nprove very profitable. In the present year, to my knowledge, a labourer\r\nsold L4 worth of apples; and another made L3, 10s. off the produce of\r\none pear-tree, pears being scarce.\r\n\r\nTo come at last to the difficult question of wages. In Wiltshire there\r\nhas been no extended strike, and very few meetings upon the subject, for\r\nthe simple reason that the agitators can gain no hold upon a county\r\nwhere, as a mass, the labourers are well paid. The common day-labourer\r\nreceives 10s., 11s., and 12s. a week, according to the state of supply\r\nand demand for labour in various districts; and, if he milks, 1s. more,\r\nmaking 13s. a week, now common wages. These figures are rather below the\r\nmark; I could give instances of much higher pay. To give a good idea of\r\nthe wages paid I will take the case of a hill farmer (arable,\r\nMarlborough Downs), who paid this last summer during harvest 18s. per\r\nweek per man. His reapers often earned 10s. a day--enough to pay their\r\nyear's rent in a week. These men lived in cottages on the farm, with\r\nthree bedrooms each, and some larger, with every modern appliance, each\r\nhaving a garden of a quarter of an acre attached and close at hand, for\r\nwhich cottage and garden they paid 1s. per week rent. The whole of these\r\ncottages were insured by the farmer himself, their furniture, &c., in\r\none lump, and the insurance policy cost him, as nearly as possible, 1s.\r\n3d. per cottage per year. For this he deducted 1s. per year each from\r\ntheir wages. None of the men would have insured unless he had insisted\r\nupon doing it for them. These men had from six to eight quarts of beer\r\nper man (over and above their 18s. a week) during harvest every day. In\r\nspring and autumn their wages are much increased by piece-work, hoeing,\r\n&c. In winter the farmer draws their coal for them in his waggons, a\r\ndistance of eight miles from the nearest wharf, enabling them to get it\r\nat cost price. This is no slight advantage, for, at the present high\r\nprice of coal, it is sold, delivered in the villages, at 2s. per cwt.\r\nMany who cannot afford it in the week buy a quarter of a cwt. on\r\nSaturday night, to cook their Sunday's dinner with, for 6d. This is at\r\nthe rate of L2 per ton. Another gentleman, a large steam cultivator in\r\nthe Vale, whose name is often before the public, informs me that his\r\nbooks show that he paid L100 in one year in cash to one cottage for\r\nlabour, showing the advantage the labourer possesses over the mechanic,\r\nsince his wife and child can add to his income. Many farmers pay L50 and\r\nL60 a year for beer drunk by their labourers--a serious addition to\r\ntheir wages. The railway companies and others who employ mechanics, do\r\nnot allow them any beer. The allowance of a good cottage and a quarter\r\nof an acre of garden for 1s. per week is not singular. Many who were at\r\nthe Autumn Manoeuvres of the present year may remember having a\r\nhandsome row of houses, rather than cottages, pointed out to them as\r\ninhabited by labourers at 1s. per week. In the immediate neighbourhood\r\nof large manufacturing towns 1s. 6d. a week is sometimes paid; but then\r\nthese cottages would in such positions readily let to mechanics for 3s.,\r\n4s., and even 5s. per week. There was a great outcry when the Duke of\r\nMarlborough issued an order that the cottages on his estate should in\r\nfuture only be let to such men as worked upon the farms where those\r\ncottages were situated. In reality this was the very greatest blessing\r\nthe Duke could have conferred upon the agricultural labourer; for it\r\nensured him a good cottage at a nearly nominal rent and close to his\r\nwork; whereas in many instances previously the cottages on the farms had\r\nbeen let at a high rate to the mechanics, and the labourer had to walk\r\nmiles before he got to his labour. Cottages are not erected by\r\nlandowners or by farmers as paying speculations. It is well known that\r\nthe condition of things prevents the agricultural labourer from being\r\nable to pay a sufficient rent to be a fair percentage upon the sum\r\nexpended. In one instance a landlord has built some cottages for his\r\ntenant, the tenant paying a certain amount of interest on the sum\r\ninvested by the landlord. Now, although this is a matter of\r\narrangement, and not of speculation--that is, although the interest paid\r\nby the tenant is a low percentage upon the money laid out, yet the rent\r\npaid by the labourers inhabiting these cottages to the tenant does not\r\nreimburse him what he pays his landlord as interest--not by a\r\nconsiderable margin. But then he has the advantage of his labourers\r\nclose to his work, always ready at hand.\r\n\r\nOver and above the actual cash wages of the labourer, which are now very\r\ngood, must be reckoned his cottage and garden, and often a small\r\norchard, at a nominal rent, his beer at his master's expense,\r\npiece-work, gleaning after harvest, &c., which alter his real position\r\nvery materially. In Gloucestershire, on the Cotswolds, the best-paid\r\nlabourers are the shepherds, for in that great sheep-country much trust\r\nis reposed in them. At the annual auctions of shearlings which are held\r\nupon the large farms a purse is made for the shepherd of the flock, into\r\nwhich every one who attends is expected to drop a shilling, often\r\nproducing L5. The shepherds on the Wiltshire downs are also well paid,\r\nespecially in lambing-time, when the greatest watchfulness and care are\r\nrequired. It has been stated that the labourer has no chance of rising\r\nfrom his position. This is sheer cant. He has very good opportunities of\r\nrising, and often does rise, to my knowledge. At this present moment I\r\ncould mention a person who has risen from a position scarcely equal to\r\nthat of a labourer, not only to have a farm himself, but to place his\r\nsons in farms. Another has just entered on a farm; and several more are\r\non the highroad to that desirable consummation. If a labourer possesses\r\nany amount of intelligence he becomes head-carter or head-fagger, as the\r\ncase may be; and from that to be assistant or under-bailiff, and finally\r\nbailiff. As a bailiff he has every opportunity to learn the working of a\r\nfarm, and is often placed in entire charge of a farm at a distance from\r\nhis employer's residence. In time he establishes a reputation as a\r\npractical man, and being in receipt of good wages, with very little\r\nexpenditure, saves some money. He has now little difficulty in obtaining\r\nthe promise of a farm, and with this can readily take up money. With\r\naverage care he is a made man. Others rise from petty trading, petty\r\ndealing in pigs and calves, till they save sufficient to rent a small\r\nfarm, and make that the basis of larger dealing operations. I question\r\nvery much whether a clerk in a firm would not find it much more\r\ndifficult, as requiring larger capital, to raise himself to a level with\r\nhis employer than an agricultural labourer does to the level of a\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nMany labourers now wander far and wide as navvies, &c., and perhaps when\r\nthese return home, as most of them do, to agricultural labour, they are\r\nthe most useful and intelligent of their class, from a readiness they\r\npossess to turn their hand to anything. I know one at this moment who\r\nmakes a large addition to his ordinary wages by brewing for the small\r\ninns, and very good liquor he brews, too. They pick up a large amount of\r\npractical knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural women are certainly not handsome; I know no peasantry\r\nso entirely uninviting. Occasionally there is a girl whose nut-brown\r\ncomplexion and sloe-black eyes are pretty, but their features are very\r\nrarely good, and they get plain quickly, so soon as the first flush of\r\nyouth is past. Many have really good hair in abundance, glossy and rich,\r\nperhaps from its exposure to the fresh air. But on Sundays they plaster\r\nit with strong-smelling pomade and hair-oil, which scents the air for\r\nyards most unpleasantly. As a rule, it may safely be laid down that the\r\nagricultural women are moral, far more so than those of the town. Rough\r\nand rude jokes and language are, indeed, too common; but that is all. No\r\nevil comes of it. The fairs are the chief cause of immorality. Many an\r\nhonest, hard-working servant-girl owes her ruin to these fatal mops and\r\nfairs, when liquor to which she is unaccustomed overcomes her. Yet it\r\nseems cruel to take from them the one day or two of the year on which\r\nthey can enjoy themselves fairly in their own fashion. The spread of\r\nfriendly societies, patronised by the gentry and clergy, with their\r\nannual festivities, is a remedy which is gradually supplying them with\r\nsafer, and yet congenial, amusement. In what may be termed lesser morals\r\nI cannot accord either them or the men the same praise. They are too\r\nungrateful for the many great benefits which are bountifully supplied\r\nthem--the brandy, the soup, and fresh meat readily extended without\r\nstint from the farmer's home in sickness to the cottage are too quickly\r\nforgotten. They who were most benefited are often the first to most\r\nloudly complain and to backbite. Never once in all my observation have I\r\nheard a labouring man or woman make a grateful remark; and yet I can\r\nconfidently say that there is no class of persons in England who receive\r\nso many attentions and benefits from their superiors as the agricultural\r\nlabourers. Stories are rife of their even refusing to work at disastrous\r\nfires because beer was not immediately forthcoming. I trust this is not\r\ntrue; but it is too much in character. No term is too strong in\r\ncondemnation for those persons who endeavour to arouse an agitation\r\namong a class of people so short-sighted and so ready to turn against\r\ntheir own benefactors and their own interest. I am credibly informed\r\nthat one of these agitators, immediately after the Bishop of\r\nGloucester's unfortunate but harmlessly intended speech at the\r\nGloucester Agricultural Society's dinner--one of these agitators mounted\r\na platform at a village meeting and in plain language incited and\r\nadvised the labourers to duck the farmers! The agricultural women either\r\ngo out to field-work or become indoor servants. In harvest they\r\nhay-make--chiefly light work, as raking--and reap, which is much harder\r\nlabour; but then, while reaping they work their own time, as it is done\r\nby the piece. Significantly enough, they make longer hours while\r\nreaping. They are notoriously late to arrive, and eager to return home,\r\non the hay-field. The children help both in haymaking and reaping. In\r\nspring and autumn they hoe and do other piece-work. On pasture farms\r\nthey beat clots or pick up stones out of the way of the mowers' scythes.\r\nOccasionally, but rarely now, they milk. In winter they wear gaiters,\r\nwhich give the ankles a most ungainly appearance. Those who go out to\r\nservice get very low wages at first from their extreme awkwardness, but\r\ngenerally quickly rise. As dairymaids they get very good wages indeed.\r\nDairymaids are scarce and valuable. A dairymaid who can be trusted to\r\ntake charge of a dairy will sometimes get L20 besides her board\r\n(liberal) and sundry perquisites. These often save money, marry\r\nbailiffs, and help their husbands to start a farm.\r\n\r\nIn the education provided for children Wiltshire compares favourably\r\nwith other counties. Long before the passing of the recent Act in\r\nreference to education the clergy had established schools in almost\r\nevery parish, and their exertions have enabled the greater number of\r\nplaces to come up to the standard required by the Act, without the\r\nassistance of a School Board. The great difficulty is the distance\r\nchildren have to walk to school, from the sparseness of population and\r\nthe number of outlying hamlets. This difficulty is felt equally by the\r\nfarmers, who, in the majority of cases, find themselves situated far\r\nfrom a good school. In only one place has anything like a cry for\r\neducation arisen, and that is on the extreme northern edge of the\r\ncounty. The Vice-Chairman of the Swindon Chamber of Agriculture recently\r\nstated that only one-half of the entire population of Inglesham could\r\nread and write. It subsequently appeared that the parish of Inglesham\r\nwas very sparsely populated, and that a variety of circumstances had\r\nprevented vigorous efforts being made. The children, however, could\r\nattend schools in adjoining parishes, not farther than two miles, a\r\ndistance which they frequently walk in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThose who are so ready to cast every blame upon the farmer, and to\r\nrepresent him as eating up the earnings of his men and enriching himself\r\nwith their ill-paid labour, should remember that farming, as a rule, is\r\ncarried on with a large amount of borrowed capital. In these days, when\r\nL6 an acre has been expended in growing roots for sheep, when the\r\nslightest derangement of calculation in the price of wool, meat, or\r\ncorn, or the loss of a crop, seriously interferes with a fair return for\r\ncapital invested, the farmer has to sail extremely close to the wind,\r\nand only a little more would find his canvas shaking. It was only\r\nrecently that the cashier of the principal bank of an agricultural\r\ncounty, after an unprosperous year, declared that such another season\r\nwould make almost every farmer insolvent. Under these circumstances it\r\nis really to be wondered at that they have done as much as they have for\r\nthe labourer in the last few years, finding him with better cottages,\r\nbetter wages, better education, and affording him better opportunities\r\nof rising in the social scale.--I am, Sir, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nRICHARD JEFFERIES.\r\n\r\nCOATE FARM, SWINDON, _Nov. 12, 1872._\r\n\r\n\r\nLord Shaftesbury, in the _Times_, Dec. 6th, says:--\r\n\r\n\"It is our duty and our interest to elevate the present condition of the\r\nlabourer, and to enable him to assert and enjoy every one of his rights.\r\nBut I must agree with Mr. Jefferies that, even under the actual system\r\nof things, numerous instances have occurred of a rise in the social\r\nscale as the result of temperance, good conduct, and economy. He has\r\nfurnished some examples. I will give only one from my own estate:--'T.\r\nM. was for many years shepherd to Farmer P----; he bought with his\r\nsavings a small leasehold property at ---- for L170, and he had\r\naccumulated L100 besides. He had brought up a son and three daughters,\r\nand his son now occupies the leasehold.' This is the statement as given\r\nto me in writing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER II.\r\n\r\n(_To the Editor of the \"Times.\"_)\r\n\r\nSIR,--I did not intend to make any reply to the numerous attacks made\r\nupon my letter published in the _Times_ of the 14th inst., but the\r\nstatements made by \"The Son of a Wiltshire Labourer\" are such as I feel\r\nbound to resent on the part of the farmers of this county.\r\n\r\nHe says he wishes the landed proprietors would take as much care to\r\nprovide cottages for their labourers as I represent them as doing. I\r\nrepeat what I said, that the cottages on large estates are now, one and\r\nall, fit habitations for human beings. The Duke of Marlborough is a\r\nlarge proprietor of cottages in this neighbourhood, and his plan has\r\nbeen, whenever a cottage did not appear sufficiently commodious, to\r\nthrow two into one. The owner of the largest estate near Swindon has\r\nbeen engaged for many years past in removing the old thatched mud\r\nhovels, and replacing them with substantial, roomy, and slate-roofed\r\nbuildings. Farmers are invariably anxious to have good cottages. There\r\nis a reluctance to destroy the existing ones, both from the\r\ninconvenience and the uncertainty sometimes of others being erected.\r\nOften, too, the poor have the strongest attachment to the cabin in which\r\nthey were born and bred, and would strongly resent its destruction,\r\nthough obviously for their good. Farmers never build bad cottages now.\r\nWhen a tenement falls in, either from decay or the death of the tenant,\r\nthe cottage which is erected on its site is invariably a good one. A row\r\nof splendid cottages has recently been erected at Wanborough. They are\r\nvery large, with extensive gardens attached. Some even begin to complain\r\nthat the cottages now erected are in a sense \"too good\" for the purpose.\r\nThe system of three bedrooms is undoubtedly the best from a sanitary\r\npoint of view, but it is a question whether the widespread belief in\r\nthat system, and that system alone, has not actually retarded the\r\nerection of reasonably good buildings. It is that third bedroom which\r\njust prevents the investment of building a cottage from paying a\r\nremunerative percentage on the capital expended. Two bedrooms are easily\r\nmade--the third puzzles the builder where to put it with due regard to\r\neconomy. Nor is a third bedroom always required. Out of ten families\r\nperhaps only two require a third bedroom; in this way there is a large\r\nwaste in erecting a row. It has been suggested that a row should consist\r\nof so many cottages with two bedrooms only for families who do not want\r\nmore, and at each end a building with three bedrooms for larger\r\nfamilies. In one instance two cottages were ordered to be erected on an\r\nestate, the estimate for which was L640; these when completed might have\r\nlet for L10 per annum, or 1-3/4 per cent, on the capital invested! The\r\nplans for these cottages had so many dormer windows, porches,\r\nintricacies of design in variegated tiles, &c., that the contractor gave\r\nit up as a bad job. I mention this to show that the tendency to build\r\ngood cottages has gone even beyond what was really required, and\r\nornamentation is added to utility.\r\n\r\nThen it is further stated that the labourer cannot build cottages. I\r\ncould name a lane at this moment the cottages in which were one and all\r\nbuilt by labourers; and there are half-a-dozen in this village which\r\nwere erected by regular farm labourers. The majority of these are, as I\r\nsaid before, wretched hovels, but there are two or three which\r\ndemonstrate that the labourer, if he is a thrifty man, earns quite\r\nsufficient to enable him to erect a reasonably good building. The worst\r\nhovel I ever saw (it was mentioned in my letter of the 14th) was built\r\nby a man who is notorious for his drinking habits. Some forty years ago,\r\nwhen wages were much lower than they are now, two labourers, to my\r\nknowledge, took possession of a strip of waste land by the roadside, and\r\nbuilt themselves cottages. One of these was a very fair building; the\r\nother would certainly be condemned now-a-days. The lord of the manor\r\nclaimed these; and the difficulty was thus adjusted:--The builders were\r\nto receive the value of their tenements from the lord of the manor, and\r\nwere to remain permanent tenants for life on payment of a small\r\npercentage, interest upon the purchase-money, as quit-rent. On their\r\ndeaths the cottages were to become the property of the lord of the\r\nmanor. One man received L40 for his cottage, the other L20, which sums\r\nforty years ago represented relatively a far higher value than now, and\r\ndemonstrate conclusively that the labourer, if he is a steady,\r\nhard-working man, can build a cottage. Another cottage I know of, built\r\nby a farm labourer, is really a very creditable building--good walls,\r\nfloors, staircase, sashes, doors; it stands high, and appears very\r\ncomfortable, and even pleasant, in summer, for they are a thrifty\r\nfamily, and can even display flower-pots in the window. Other cottages\r\nhave been built or largely added to in my memory by labourers. On these\r\noccasions they readily obtain help from the farmers. One lends his team\r\nand waggons to draw the stones; another supplies wood for nothing; but\r\nof late I must admit there has been some reluctance to assist in this\r\nway (unless for repairs) because it was so often found that the\r\nbuildings thus erected were not fit habitations. The Boards of Guardians\r\noften find a difficulty from the limited ownership of some of the\r\nlabourers, who apply for relief, of their cottages. Perhaps they have\r\nnot paid quit-rent for a year or two; but still they cannot sell, and\r\nyet it seems unjust to the ratepayers to assist a man who has a tenement\r\nwhich he at least calls his own, and from which he cannot be ejected, I\r\nknow a labourer at this moment living in a cottage originally built by\r\nhis father, and added to by himself by the assistance of the\r\nneighbouring farmers. This man has been greatly assisted by one farmer\r\nin particular, who advanced him money by which he purchased a horse and\r\ncart, and was enabled to do a quantity of hauling, flint-carting for the\r\nwaywardens, and occasionally to earn money by assisting to carry a\r\nfarmer's harvest. He rents a large piece of arable land, and ought to be\r\ncomparatively well off.\r\n\r\n\"The Son of a Wiltshire Labourer\" complains that the farmers or\r\nproprietors do not make sufficient efforts to supply the cottages with\r\nwater. The lord of the manor and the tenant of the largest farms in this\r\nimmediate neighbourhood have but just sunk a well for their cottages;\r\npreviously they had got their supply from a pump in an adjacent\r\nfarmyard thrown open by the proprietor to all the village.\r\n\r\nIt is the labourer himself who will not rise. In a village with which I\r\nam acquainted great efforts have been made by a farmer and a gentleman\r\nliving near to provide proper school instruction for the children. One\r\nlabourer was asked why he did not send his children to school. He\r\nreplied, \"Because he could not afford it.\" \"But,\" said the farmer, \"it\r\nis only threepence altogether.\" \"Oh, no; he could not afford it.\" The\r\nfarmer explained to him that the object was to avoid a School Board,\r\nwhich, in other places, had the power to fine for not sending children\r\nto school. \"No, he could not afford it.\" The farmer's books show that\r\nthis labourer, his wife, and two children received 28s. 6d. per week,\r\nhis cottage rent free, and a very large garden at a low rent. Yet he\r\ncould not afford the 3d. a week which would enable his children\r\nultimately to take a better position in the world! The same farmer, who\r\nis a liberal and large-minded man, has endeavoured, without success, to\r\nintroduce the practice of paying in cash instead of beer, and also the\r\nsystem of payment for overtime. The men say no, they would rather not.\r\n\"In wet weather,\" they say, \"we do no work, but you pay us; and if we\r\nwork a little later in harvest, it only makes it fair.\" They would not\r\ntake money instead of beer. In another case which came under my personal\r\nobservation in the middle of last summer, a farmer announced his\r\nintention of paying in cash instead of allowing beer. In the very press\r\nof the haymaking, with acres upon acres of grass spoiling, his men, one\r\nand all, struck work because he would not give them beer, and went over\r\nto a neighbour's field adjacent and worked for him for nothing but their\r\nshare in the beer. If labourers work longer hours in harvest (corn), it\r\nis because it is piece-work, and they thereby make more money. I contend\r\nthat the payment in kind, the beer, the gleanings, the piece-work, the\r\nlow and nominal cottage rent, the allotment ground and produce, and the\r\npig (not restricted to one pig in a year), may fairly be taken as an\r\naddition to their wages. I am informed that in one parish the cottage\r\nrents vary from 10d. to 1s. 2d. per week; nearly all have gardens, and\r\nall may have allotments up to a quarter of an acre each at 3d. per lug,\r\nor 40s. per acre. I am also informed of a labourer renting a cottage\r\nand garden at 1s. per week, the fruit-trees in whose garden produced\r\nthis year three sacks of damsons, which he sold at 1s. 6d. per gallon,\r\nor L6, 18s. I know of a case in which a labourer--an earnest,\r\nintelligent, hard-working man--makes L2 a week on an average all the\r\nyear round. But then he works only at piece-work, going from farm to\r\nfarm, and this is, of course, an exceptional case. The old men, worn out\r\nwith age and infirmity, are kept on year after year by many farmers out\r\nof charity, rather than let them go to the workhouse, though totally\r\nuseless and a dead loss, especially as occupying valuable cottage-room.\r\nThere is a society, the annual meetings of which are held at Chippenham,\r\nand which is supported by the clergy, gentry, and farmers generally of\r\nNorth Wilts, for the object of promoting steady habits among the\r\nlabourers and rewarding cases of long and deserving services. There is\r\nalso a friendly society on the best and most reliable basis, supported\r\nby the gentry, and introduced as far as possible into villages. The\r\nlabourers on the Great Western Railway works at Swindon earn from 15s. a\r\nweek upwards, according as they approach to skilled workmen. Attracted\r\nby these wages, most of the young men of the neighbourhood try the\r\nfactory, but, usually, after a short period return to farm-work, the\r\nresult of their experience being that they are better off as\r\nagricultural labourers. Lodgings in the town close to the factory are\r\nvery expensive, and food in proportion; consequently they have to walk\r\nlong distances to their labour--some from Wanborough, five miles;\r\nWroughton, three and a half miles; Purton, four miles; and even Wootton\r\nBassett, six miles, which twice a day is a day's work in itself. Add to\r\nthis the temptations to spend money in towns, and the severe labour, and\r\nthe man finds himself better off with his quiet cottage and garden on a\r\nfarm at 12s. a week, and 1s. for milking, with beer, and a meal on\r\nSundays. The skilled mechanics, who earn 36s. to L2 per week, rent\r\nhouses in the town at 6s. to 8s.; and in one case I knew of 12s. per\r\nweek paid by a lodger for two rooms. These prices cannot be paid out of\r\nthe mechanic's wage; consequently he sub-lets, or takes lodgers, and\r\nsometimes these sub-let, and the result is an overcrowding worse than\r\nthat of the agricultural cottages, around which there is at least fresh\r\nair and plenty of light (nearly as important), which are denied in a\r\ntown. The factory labourer and the mechanic are liable to instant\r\ndismissal. The agricultural labourers (half of them at least) are hired\r\nby the year or half-year, and cannot be summarily sent along unless for\r\nmisconduct. Wages have recently been increased by the farmers of\r\nWiltshire voluntarily and without pressure from threatened strikes. It\r\nis often those who receive the highest wages who are the first to come\r\nto the parish for relief. It is not uncommon for mechanics and others to\r\ngo for relief where it is discovered that they are in receipt of sick\r\npay from the yard club, and sometimes from two friendly societies,\r\nmaking 18s. a week. A manufacturing gentleman informed me that the very\r\nmen whom he had been paying L8 a week to were the first to apply for\r\nrelief when distress came and the mills stopped. It is not low wages,\r\nthen, which causes improvident habits. The only result of deporting\r\nagricultural labourers to different counties is to equalise the wages\r\npaid all over England. This union-assisted emigration affords the\r\nimprovident labourer a good opportunity of transporting himself to a\r\ndistant county, and leaving deeply in debt with the tradesmen with whom\r\nhe has long dealt. I am informed that this is commonly the case with\r\nemigrating labourers. A significant fact is noted in the leader of the\r\n_Labour News_ of the 16th of November; the return of certain emigrants\r\nfrom America is announced as \"indicative that higher quotations are not\r\nalways representative of greater positive advantages.\" The agricultural\r\nlabourer found that out when he returned from the factory at 15s. per\r\nweek to farm labour at 12s. I am positive that the morality of the\r\ncountry compares favourably with that of the town. I was particularly\r\nstruck with this fact on a visit to the Black Country. One of the worst\r\nparishes for immorality in Wiltshire is one where glovemaking is carried\r\non; singularly enough, manufactures and immorality seem to go together.\r\n\"The Son of a Labourer\" says that all the advantages the labourer does\r\npossess are owing to the exertions of the clergy; pray who support the\r\nclergy but the farmers?\r\n\r\nI think that the facts I have mentioned sufficiently demonstrate that\r\nthe farmers and the landlords of Wiltshire have done their duty, and\r\nmore than their mere duty, towards the labourers; and only a little\r\ninvestigation will show that at present it is out of their power to do\r\nmore. Take the case of a farmer entering a dairy-farm of, say, 250\r\nacres, and calculate his immediate outgoings--say fifty cows at L20,\r\nL1,000; two horses at L25, L50; waggons, carts, implements, L100;\r\nlabour, three men at 12s. per week, L94; harvest labour, L20; dairymaid\r\nL10; tithe, taxes, rates, &c., L100; rent, L2 per acre, L500. Total,\r\nL1874. In other words (exclusive of the capital invested in stock), the\r\noutgoings amount to L724 per annum; against which put--fifty cows' milk,\r\n&c., at L10 per head, L500; fifty calves, L100; fifty tons of hay at L3,\r\n10s., L175. Total income, L775; balance in hand, L51. Then comes the\r\nvillage school subscription; sometimes a church rate (legally voluntary,\r\nbut morally binding), &c.\r\n\r\nSo that, in hard figures (all these are below the mark, if anything),\r\nthere is positively nothing left for the farmer but a house and garden\r\nfree. How, then, is money made? By good judgment in crops, in stock, by\r\nlucky accidents. On a dairy-farm the returns begin immediately; on an\r\narable one there is half a year at least to wait. The care, the\r\njudgment, required to be exercised is something astonishing, and a\r\nfarmer is said to be all his life learning his trade. If sheep are dear\r\nand pay well, the farmer plants roots; then, perhaps, after a heavy\r\nexpenditure for manure, for labour, and seed, there comes the fly, or a\r\ndrought, and his capital is sunk. On the other hand, if the season be\r\ngood, roots are cheap and over-plentiful, and where is his profit then?\r\nHe works like a labourer himself in all weathers and at all times; he\r\nhas the responsibility and the loss, yet he is expected to find the\r\nlabourer, not only good cottages, allotments, schooling, good wages, but\r\nHeaven knows what besides. Supposing the L1874 (on the dairy-farm) be\r\nborrowed capital for which he must pay at least 4 per cent.--and few,\r\nindeed, are there who get money at that price--it is obvious how hard\r\nhe must personally work, how hard, too, he must live, to make both ends\r\nmeet. And it speaks well for his energy and thrift that I heard a bank\r\ndirector not long since remark that he had noticed, after all, with\r\nevery drawback, the tenant farmers had made as a rule more money in\r\nproportion than their landlords. A harder-working class of men does not\r\nexist than the Wiltshire farmers.\r\n\r\nOnly a few days ago I saw in your valuable paper a list, nearly a column\r\nlong, of the millionaires who had died in the last ten years. It would\r\nbe interesting to know how much they had spent for the benefit of the\r\nagricultural labourer. Yet no one attacks them. They pay no poor-rates,\r\nno local taxation, or nothing in proportion. The farmer pays the\r\npoor-rate which supports the labourer in disease, accident, and old age;\r\nthe highway rates on which the millionaire's carriage rolls; and very\r\nsoon the turnpike trusts will fall in, and the farmers--_i.e._, the\r\nland--will have to support the imperial roads also. With all these heavy\r\nburdens on his back, having to compete against the world, he has yet no\r\nright to compensation for his invested capital if he is ordered to quit.\r\nWithout some equalisation of local taxation--as I have shown, the local\r\ntaxes often make another rent almost--without a recognised tenant-right,\r\nnot revolutionary, but for unexhausted improvements, better security, so\r\nthat he can freely invest capital, the farmer cannot--I reiterate it, he\r\ncannot--do more than he has done for the labourer. He would then employ\r\nmore skilled labour, and wages would be better. And, after all that he\r\ndoes for them, he dares not find fault, or he may find his ricks blazing\r\naway--thanks to the teaching of the agitators that the farmers are\r\ntyrants, and, by inference, that to injure them is meritorious. There is\r\na poster in Swindon now offering L20 reward for the discovery of the\r\nperson who maliciously set fire to a rick of hay in Lord Bolingbroke's\r\npark at Lydiard.\r\n\r\nIf any farmers are hard upon their men, it is those who have themselves\r\nbeen labourers and have risen to be employers of labour. These very\r\noften thoroughly understand the art of getting the value of a man's wage\r\nout of him. I deliberately affirm that the true farmers, one and all,\r\nare in favour of that maxim of a well-known and respected agriculturist\r\nof our county--\"A fair day's wage for a fair day's work.\"\r\n\r\nI fear the farmers of Wiltshire would be only too happy to ride\r\nthorough-breds to the hunt, and see their daughters driving phaetons, as\r\nthey are accused of doing; but I also fear that very, very few enjoy\r\nthat privilege. Most farmers, it is true, do keep some kind of vehicle;\r\nit is necessary when their great distance from a town is considered, and\r\nthe keep of a horse or two comes to nothing on a large farm. It is\r\ncustomary for them to drive their wives or daughters once a week on\r\nmarket-days into the nearest town. If here and there an energetic man\r\nsucceeds in making money, and is able to send his son to a university,\r\nall honour to him. I hope the farmers will send their sons to\r\nuniversities; the spread of education in their class will be of as much\r\nadvantage to the community as among the labouring population, for it\r\nwill lead to the more general application of science to the land and a\r\nhigher amount of production. If the labourer attempted to rise he would\r\nbe praised; why not the farmer?\r\n\r\nIt is simply an unjustifiable libel on the entire class to accuse them\r\nof wilful extravagance. I deliberately affirm that the majority of\r\nfarmers in Wiltshire are exactly the reverse; that, while they practise\r\na generous hospitality to a friend or a stranger, they are decidedly\r\nsaving and frugal rather than extravagant, and they are compelled to be\r\nso by the condition of their finances. To prove that their efforts are\r\nfor the good of the community I need only allude to the work of the late\r\nMr. Stratton, so crowned with success in improving the breed of\r\ncattle--a work in the sister county of Gloucester so ably carried on at\r\nthis present moment by Mr. Edward Bowly, and by Mr. Lane and Mr. Garne\r\nin the noted Cotswold sheep. The breeds produced by these gentlemen have\r\nin a manner impregnated the whole world, imported as they have been to\r\nAmerica and Australia. It was once ably said that the readings of the\r\nEnglish Bible Sunday after Sunday in our churches had preserved our\r\nlanguage pure for centuries; and, in the same way, I do verily believe\r\nthat the English (not the Wiltshire only, but the English) farmer as an\r\ninstitution, with his upright, untainted ideas of honour, honesty, and\r\nmorality, has preserved the tone of society from that corruption which\r\nhas so miserably degraded France--so much so that Dumas recently\r\nscientifically predicted that France was _en route a prostitution\r\ngenerale_. Just in the same way his splendid constitution as a man\r\nrecruits the exhausted, pale, nervous race who dwell in cities, and\r\nprevents the Englishman from physically degenerating.--I am, Sir,\r\nfaithfully yours,\r\n\r\nRICHARD JEFFERIES.\r\n\r\nCOATE FARM, SWINDON, _November 25, 1872_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE ALLOTMENT SYSTEM._\r\n\r\n(_To the Editor of the \"Times.\"_)\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--Many gentlemen having written to me for further information upon\r\nthe system of glebe allotments for labourers mentioned in my letter to\r\nthe _Times_ of November 14, it has occurred to me that the following\r\nfacts may be interesting:--\r\n\r\nThe glebe alluded to was that of Lyddington, near Swindon, and the plan\r\nwas originated by the late incumbent, Mr. May, but carried out into a\r\ncomplete system by the present much-respected rector, the Rev. H. Munn.\r\nThe land itself is situated not more than 300 yards from the village of\r\nLyddington, by the side of a good turnpike-road, and is traversed by two\r\nroads giving easy access to every allotment. Each plot of ground is\r\ndivided from the next by a narrow green path: no hedges or mounds are\r\npermitted, and the field itself is enclosed without a hedge to harbour\r\nbirds. The soil is a rich dark loam, yielding good crops, with very\r\nlittle manure, and the surface is level. There are sixty-three tenants\r\noccupying plots varying in size, according to circumstances, from 48\r\n\"lug\" downwards--25, 30, 16, &c. A \"lug\" is a provincialism for perch.\r\nThe rent is 5d. per \"lug\" or perch, and each occupier on becoming a\r\ntenant receives a card on which the following rules are printed in large\r\ntype:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"LYDDINGTON GARDEN ALLOTMENTS.\r\n\r\n     \"RULES AND REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\n     \"1. The land shall be cultivated by the spade only, and proper\r\n     attention shall be paid to its cultivation.\r\n\r\n     \"2. No allotment, or any part thereof, shall be under-let or\r\n     exchanged.\r\n\r\n     \"3. The rent shall be due on the 1st of September in each year, and\r\n     shall be paid before the crop is taken off the ground.\r\n\r\n     \"4. All tenants shall maintain a character for morality and\r\n     sobriety, and shall not frequent a public-house on the Sabbath-day.\r\n\r\n     \"5. If any tenant fail to pay his rent or to perform any of the\r\n     foregoing conditions he shall immediately forfeit his allotment,\r\n     with his crop upon the same, and the landlord or his agent shall\r\n     take possession and enforce payment of the rent due by sale of the\r\n     crop or otherwise, as in arrears of rent.\r\n\r\n     \"All the tenants are earnestly requested to attend regularly at the\r\n     House of God during the times of Divine Service, with their\r\n     families, to the best of their abilities.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of Rule 2 is to enable the landlord to retain a certain\r\namount of influence over the tenant, to bring him in immediate contact\r\nwith the tenant, and to keep the land itself under his control. Many\r\noccupiers endeavour to under-let their allotments, which, if permitted,\r\nwould entirely defeat the main object of the landlord, besides\r\ncomplicating the already great labour of collecting the rents, &c.\r\n\r\nRule 3 prevents the produce of the allotment going to pay the\r\npublic-house score; while the date on which the rent falls due is so\r\nadjusted as to enable the occupier to receive his money for harvest-work\r\nbefore paying it.\r\n\r\nRule 4 places a great restraint upon drunkenness and dissolute habits.\r\nLast year the Rev. H. Munn addressed a private circular to his tenants,\r\nin which he says:--\r\n\r\n\"Sad reports have been brought to me lately of the conduct of some in\r\nthe parish, and among them, I am sorry to say, are tenants of the\r\nAllotment Gardens. Such conduct is contrary to the rules on which the\r\nallotments are held, and also contrary to the intentions of my\r\npredecessor in letting them out to the parishioners. They are intended\r\nto improve the condition of the labourers and their families, giving\r\nthem employment in the summer evenings, increasing their supply of food,\r\nand withdrawing them from the influence of the public-house. But when\r\ndrinking habits are indulged all these benefits are lost, and the\r\nallotments, which were intended to do the labourer good, only increase\r\nhis means of obtaining intoxicating drinks.\"\r\n\r\nThe landlord can, of course, exercise his discretion in enforcing Rule\r\n5--can allow time for payment, and in certain cases of misfortune, such\r\nas the failure of the potato crop, remit it entirely. But this power\r\nmust be sparingly used, otherwise every one would endeavour to find\r\nexcuses for non-fulfilment of the contract.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the allotment is written on the back of the card of rules,\r\nwith the name of the tenant, thus:--\"D. Hancock.--Lot 1, Lug 15; rent\r\n6s. 3d.;\" and each payment is receipted underneath, with the date and\r\ninitials of the landlord.\r\n\r\nThe present landlord has in no case disturbed or removed the tenants\r\nreceived by his predecessor, but where land has fallen in he has\r\nendeavoured to arrange the extent of the new allotments made to suit the\r\nrequirements of families, and to allow of a sufficient crop of potatoes\r\nbeing grown for one season on one half of the allotment, while the other\r\nhalf bears different vegetables, and _vice versa_ for the next season,\r\nbeing the same thing as a rotation of crops.\r\n\r\nThe field has recently been drained at the joint cost of landlord and\r\ntenant. The Rev. H. Munn provided the drain-pipes, and the occupiers\r\npaid for the labour, which latter came to L8, the amount being\r\nproportioned according to the size of each allotment. The highest\r\namount paid by any one tenant was, I believe, L1 (for 48 \"lug\"), others\r\ngoing down to 1s.\r\n\r\nThe rent at 5d. per \"lug\" or perch comes to L3, 6s. 8d. per acre, an\r\namount which bears a proper relation to the rent of arable farming land,\r\nwhen the labour of collecting so many small sums and other circumstances\r\nare taken into consideration. The moral effect of the arrangement has\r\nbeen incalculable--as one old woman pertinently remarked, \"We needn't\r\nsteal now, sir.\" In the olden times the farmers' gardens were constantly\r\nsubject to depredations. The ordinary rate at which gardens are let in\r\nthe neighbourhood is 6d. per \"lug.\" At Swindon, the nearest town (12,000\r\ninhabitants), there are large allotment fields let at 1s. 6d. per \"lug,\"\r\nor L12 per acre, and eagerly caught up at that price. These allotments\r\nare rented by every class, from labourers and mechanics to well-to-do\r\ntradesmen.\r\n\r\nThe very first desire of every agricultural labourer's heart is a\r\ngarden, and so strong is the feeling that I have known men apply for\r\npermission to cultivate the vacant space between the large double\r\nmounds of the hedges on some pasture farms, and work hard at it despite\r\nthe roots of the bushes and the thefts of the rooks.\r\n\r\nThe facts mentioned above only add one more to the numberless ways in\r\nwhich the noble clergy of the Church of England have been silently\r\nlabouring for the good of the people committed to their care for years\r\nbefore the agitators bestowed one thought on the agricultural poor.--I\r\nam, Sir, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nRICHARD JEFFERIES.\r\n\r\nCOATE FARM, SWINDON.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Published in the \"Times,\" Nov. 23, 1872._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A TRUE TALE OF THE WILTSHIRE LABOURER._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Now then--hold fast there--mind the furrow, Tim.\" The man who was\r\nloading prepared himself for the shock, and the waggon safely jolted\r\nover the furrow, and on between the wakes of light-brown hay, crackling\r\nto the touch as if it would catch fire in the brilliant sunshine. The\r\npitchers, one on each side, stuck their prongs into the wakes and sent\r\nup great \"pitches,\" clearing the ground rapidly, through emulation, for\r\nit was a point of honour to keep pace with each other. Tim, the old man\r\nwho had led the horses, resumed his rake in the rear among the women,\r\nwho instantly began teasing the poor wretch.\r\n\r\n\"Tim, she's allus in the way,\" said one, purposely hitching her rake in\r\nhis. \"Thur--get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shan't,\" said Tim, surly as crabbed age and incessant banter under a\r\nhot sun could make him. \"Now--mind, thee's break th' rake.\"\r\n\r\nThey both pulled as hard as they dared--each expecting the other to give\r\nway, for the master was in sight, on horseback, by the rick, and a rake\r\nbroken wantonly would bring a sharp reprimand.\r\n\r\n\"Go it, Sal!\" cried the loader on the waggon hoarsely, half choked with\r\nhay dust. \"Pull away!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pull, Tim!\" cried one of the pitchers.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha!\" laughed two or three more women, closing round as the girl\r\ngave a tug which nearly upset Tim and broke half-a-dozen teeth out of\r\nhis rake.\r\n\r\n\"Darn thee!\" growled the old fellow. The youngest of the girls at the\r\nsame moment gave him a push under the arm with the end of her\r\nrake-handle. It was the last straw which broke the back of Tim's temper.\r\nSwearing, he dropped the rake and seized a prong, and hobbled after the\r\ngirl, who danced away half in delight and half in terror.\r\n\r\n\"I'll job this into thee--darn thee--if I can come near thee, thee\r\nhussy!\"\r\n\r\nThe \"hussy\" let him come near, and danced away again gracefully. She\r\nwas at once the most handsome and most impudent of his tormentors.\r\nThere's no saying whether the old man, roused as he was and incensed\r\nbeyond control, might not really have \"jobbed,\" _i.e._, stabbed, his\r\nprong at her, had not one of the pitchers left his wake and rushed on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"My eye!\" shouted the loader, \"Absalom's at 'un!\"\r\n\r\nAbsalom took Tim by the shoulders and hurled him on the ground pretty\r\nheavily. Flinging the prong twenty yards away, he threatened to knock\r\nhis head off if he didn't let Madge alone. Old Tim slowly got up and\r\nwent off after his tool, growling to himself, while Madge clung hold of\r\nAbsalom's arm, who, turning round, kissed her. The other women looked\r\njealously on as she followed him back to his wake, and kept close to him\r\nat his work.\r\n\r\nMadge was tall and slenderly made. Her limbs were more delicately\r\nproportioned than is usual among women accustomed to manual labour from\r\nchildhood. The rosy glow of health lit up her brown but clear cheek,\r\nfree from freckles and sun-spots. Her eyes, black as sloes, were fringed\r\nwith long dark eyelashes which gave their glances an _espiegle_\r\nexpression. They were very wicked-looking eyes, full of fun and\r\nmischief. Her dress, open at the throat, displayed a faultless neck, but\r\nslightly sun-browned. Her curly dark-brown hair escaped in ringlets down\r\nher back. A lovely nut-brown maid!\r\n\r\nSoft glances passed rapidly between Madge and Absalom, as she raked\r\nbehind him. They did not escape the jealous notice of the other women.\r\nIt was the last day of the hay-harvest--it was \"hay home\" that night.\r\n\r\nHarvest is a time of freedom, but the last day resembles the ancient\r\nSaturnalia, or rather perhaps the vine season in Italy, when the\r\ngrape-gatherers indulged their rude wit on every one who came near.\r\nRaillery and banter poured incessantly on Madge and Absalom, who replied\r\nwith equal freedom.\r\n\r\n\"Grin away,\" shouted Absalom at last, half pleased, half irritated, as\r\nhe stuck his prong in the ground, and seizing Madge, kissed her before\r\nthem all. \"Thur--I bean't ashamed on her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! ha! Hoorah!\" shouted the men. Madge slipped away towards the\r\nrear, blushing scarlet. So absorbed had they been as not to notice the\r\napproach of another waggon coming in the opposite direction, which was\r\nnow alongside. Seeing the kiss and hearing the laugh, one of the men,\r\nfollowing it, shouted in a stentorian voice, for which he was renowned--\r\n\r\n\"Darn my buttons if I won't have one of they!\"\r\n\r\nIn an instant he was over the wake and caught Madge in his arms. But she\r\nstruggled and cried. Absalom was there in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Go it, Roaring Billy!\" shouted the followers of the other waggon. But\r\nAbsalom shook him free, and the girl darted away. The two men stood\r\nfronting each other. Absalom was angry. Billy had had a trifle too much\r\nbeer. A quarrel was imminent, and fists were doubled, when the pitchers\r\nrushed up and separated them.\r\n\r\nThe last pitch was now flung up, and the women began to decorate the\r\nhorses and the waggons with green boughs.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Madge,\" said Absalom, \"we'll ride whoam;\" and despite of much\r\nfeminine shyness and many objections, and after much trouble and\r\nblushing and rude jokes about legs, Madge was hoisted up, and Absalom\r\nfollowed her. To the rickyard they rode in triumph among green boughs,\r\nand to the rude chorus of a song.\r\n\r\nAt seven that evening the whole gang were collected in the farmer's\r\ngreat kitchen. A huge room it was, paved with stone flags, the walls\r\nwhitewashed, and the ceiling being the roof itself, whose black beams\r\nwere festooned with cobwebs. Three or four tables had been arranged in a\r\nrow, and there was a strong smell of \"dinner\" from smoking joints.\r\nAbsalom came in last. He had spent some time in adorning himself in a\r\nwhite clean slop and new corduroys, with a gay necktie and his\r\ngrandfather's watch. His face shone from a recent wash. It was an open\r\ncountenance, which unconsciously prepossessed one in his favour.\r\nLight-blue or grey eyes, which looked you straight in the face, were\r\novershadowed with rather thick eyebrows. His forehead was well\r\nproportioned, and crowned with a mass of curling yellow hair. A\r\nprofusion of whiskers hid his chin, which perhaps in its shape indicated\r\na character too easy and yielding. His shoulders were broad; his\r\nappearance one of great strength. But his mouth had a sensual look.\r\nAbsalom pushed in and out by Madge.\r\n\r\n\"What didst thee have to eat?\" asked a crony of his afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"Aw,\" said Absalom, fetching a sigh at the remembrance of the good\r\nthings. \"Fust I had a plate of rus beef, then a plate of boiled beef;\r\nthen I had one of boiled mutton, and next one of roast mutton; last,\r\nbacon. I found I couldn't git on at all wi' th' pudding, but when the\r\ncheese and th' salad came, didn't I pitch into that!\"\r\n\r\nAbsalom's love did not spoil his appetite.\r\n\r\nSoon as the dishes were removed, pipes were brought out and tankards\r\nsent on their rounds. By this time poor old Tim's weak brains were\r\nmuddled, and he was discovered leaning back against the wall and\r\nmumbling out the tag-end of an old song:--\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"On' Humphry wi' his flail,\r\n     But Kitty she wur the charming ma-aid\r\n       To carry th' milking pa-ail!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis set them on singing, and Roaring Billy insisted on bawling out at\r\nthe top of his stentorian lungs the doleful ditty of \"Lord Bateman and\r\nhis Daughters,\" which ran to thirty verses, and lasted half-an-hour.\r\nHardly were the last words out of his mouth, when an impatient wight\r\nstruck up the \"Leathern Bottel,\" and heartily did they all join in the\r\nchorus, down to where the ballad describes the married man wanting to\r\nbeat his wife, and using a glass bottle for the purpose, which broke and\r\nlet all the wine about:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Whereas it had been the Leathern Bottel,\r\n     The stopper been in he might banged away well,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwithout danger of creating an unanswerable argument in favour of\r\nleathern bottles.\r\n\r\nBy this time they were pretty well \"boozed.\" A thick cloud of\r\ntobacco-smoke filled the kitchen. Heads were rolling about from side to\r\nside and arms stretched over the tables among the _debris_ of broken\r\npipes and in pools of spilt beer and froth. Despite these rude,\r\nunromantic surroundings, Absalom and Madge were leaning close against\r\neach other, hand-in-hand, almost silent, but looking in each other's\r\neyes. What account takes passion of pipes or beer, smoke or drunken men,\r\nof snores and hoarse voices? None: they were oblivious of these things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nA month after the \"hay home\" a gaily dressed party passed through the\r\nfields towards the village church. Absalom and Madge went first,\r\narm-in-arm; followed by Roaring Billy, who was to give the bride away,\r\nwith his lady beside him. Behind these came two or three more couples,\r\nand last of all, toiling along by herself, an old woman, bent nearly\r\ndouble; it was Madge's mother. With laugh and light jest they pushed on\r\nmerrily over the stiles and through the brown autumn grass, covered with\r\na lacework of cobwebs. The ceremony passed off well enough, except that\r\nBilly, as best-man, made the old arches of the church echo again with\r\nhis response.\r\n\r\nAbsalom had taken a cottage of Farmer Humphreys. \"I'd 'ave sooner had\r\n'un of anybody else,\" said he, \"but thur war nur anuther to be had, and\r\nit bean't such a bad 'un nither, only Measter Humphreys be hardish in\r\nthe mouth.\" By the which he meant that Humphreys had the reputation of\r\nbeing rather harsh in his dealings with his workpeople. The cottage\r\nitself, however, was pleasant enough to look upon, half thatched and\r\nhalf slated, with a narrow strip of flower-garden in front full of\r\nhollyhocks, sun-flowers, and wall-flowers, enclosed in a high\r\nelder-hedge. Besides which, the occupier had a prescriptive right, by\r\ncustom, to a patch of potato ground in the allotments about a mile up\r\nthe road. And half-a-dozen damson-trees overshadowed the back of the\r\ncottage, their branches coquetting with the roof when the wind blew.\r\n\r\nHere the bridal party made a hearty dinner, and grew jolly and genial\r\nafterwards over several gallons of beer ordered from the \"Good Woman\"\r\ninn: a sign which represented a woman minus a head, and therefore\r\nsilent. It was the end of the harvest, and Absalom had plenty of money\r\nin his pocket: a week's holiday was therefore indispensable. The\r\nimbibing so much beer left a taste in the mouth next morning: this must\r\nbe washed away by a visit to the barrel. Then there was a stroll to the\r\ntop of a high hill in the neighbourhood, and as it was very hot, the\r\nparty was obliged to \"wet their whistles\" and \"wash the dust out of\r\ntheir throats\" at every sign on the road, there and back; always backed\r\nup with a second glass for the \"good of the house.\" The week wore on,\r\nand by Saturday Absalom had thoroughly emancipated himself from the\r\ntraces of control. Saturday evening brought a company together at the\r\n\"Good Woman,\" whom it behoved him to treat. Gallon after gallon was\r\ndisposed of; Absalom, as the hero of the evening, rising higher and\r\nhigher in his own estimation with every glass. At length a rude jest led\r\nto a blow. Absalom had his coat off in an instant, and felled Roaring\r\nBilly like an ox. A row began. The landlord, jealous of his license,\r\nturned them all out into the road, when one or two, overcome by the\r\nfresh air on top of so much liquor, quietly laid down in the dust.\r\nAbsalom, mad with drink and vanity, hit out right and left, and piled up\r\nthree half-stupefied fellows on top of each other, then, shouting--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"I'm the king of the castle!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nstood up in the middle of the road, and brandishing his arms, challenged\r\nall comers.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a pair of ponies dashed round the corner and suddenly\r\nstopped--obstructed by half-a-dozen men lying in the way. A tall\r\ngentleman, with a very broad forehead, a very small nose, and a\r\nprofusion of grey beard, sprang out, and went up to the landlord, who\r\nstood at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Johnson,\" said he sharply, \"this is disgraceful. What's that fellow's\r\nname?\" pointing to Absalom.\r\n\r\nThe landlord of course didn't know--was very sorry.\r\n\r\n\"I can tell 'ee, zur,\" said a voice, almost a childish treble, and old\r\nTim crept out from whence he had been sipping up the forsaken goblets.\r\n\"It be Absalom White--it be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said the Reverend J. Horton, and resuming his seat, drove\r\non; while Absalom, shouting and staggering, marched down the road,\r\nimagining he had carried all before him.\r\n\r\nThe Reverend J. Horton was the owner of the allotment grounds, which he\r\nhad broken up from the glebe land with the idea of benefiting the poor.\r\nEvery tenant received a circular of rules which were to be observed.\r\nForemost amongst these was a rule against fighting and drinking. Absalom\r\nnext week received an intimation that he must give up his allotment. He\r\nswore, and said it didn't matter a \"cuss,\" it was autumn, and the crop\r\nwas up, and he'd warrant he'd get another piece before spring somewhere.\r\nBut Madge cried, for her mother had prophesied evil from this offending\r\nof the \"gentle-folk.\" Absalom kissed her and went to his work.\r\n\r\nMadge, despite these things, was happy enough. Her education had not\r\ntaught her to expect great things. She went forth to her work in the\r\nmorning with a light heart. Merry as a cricket, she forgot in the\r\nsunshine all the ominous forebodings of her feeble old mother. It so\r\nchanced, however, that Absalom's master could not find her employment at\r\nthat season, and she therefore worked on a farm at a little distance.\r\nMadge saw little of Absalom, except at night, and then he was tired and\r\nwent early to bed. Her restless spirit could not be satisfied with so\r\nlittle companionship. Naturally fond of admiration, she thought no harm\r\nof talking and joking with the men, and her gossips encouraged her in\r\nit. The very same \"gossips\" reported her freedom to Absalom--very much\r\nexaggerated. Absalom said nothing. He was slow to understand any new\r\nidea. On her road home from her work Madge had to come down a lane with\r\nbut one solitary cottage in it. It belonged to an itinerant tinker, his\r\nown property, only paying quit-rent of a shilling a year. He was a\r\nbachelor, a gipsy sort of fellow, full of fun and rollicksome mirth,\r\nbetter educated than the labourers, and with a store of original ideas\r\nwhich he had acquired in travelling about. This fellow--\"Bellows,\" as\r\nhe was called--admired Madge exceedingly, and had tried to win her for\r\nhimself, but failed. Still, what pretty woman was ever displeased with\r\nthe attentions of a smart young fellow? After her marriage \"Bellows\"\r\ncourted her more and more. It became a \"talk,\" as the country people\r\ncall it. Madge, thinking her title as wife exonerated her from all\r\nremarks, perhaps allowed him to go further than she ought, but, in\r\nstrict earnestness, meant no harm. These things came to Absalom's ears.\r\nHe grew fonder and fonder of the public-house. Still, at home he said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nIt grew to be winter. One cold, frosty, but beautiful moonlight night\r\nAbsalom came home late from his work. He had been sent up on the hills\r\nwith some sheep, and did not return till two hours after his usual time.\r\nWeary and hungry, and not in the best of tempers, he walked in. The door\r\nwas ajar, and there were some embers on the hearth, but Madge was\r\nneither in sight nor call. Eager for his supper, Absalom went out, and\r\nsoon learned that she had gone up to the \"Good Woman.\" Madge indeed,\r\nfinding he did not come home, had gone up there to look for him.\r\n\"Bellows\" was there, and the landlord and he had been drinking pretty\r\nfreely. No sooner did Madge come in than the landlord blew out the\r\ncandle, slipped out, and locked the door with a loud guffaw, leaving the\r\npair alone in the dark. Unable to escape, Madge sat down, and they\r\nchatted away gaily enough.\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Absalom found them. He said nothing when he learnt\r\nwhere Madge was, but left the house and walked back to the cottage.\r\nAlarmed at his sullen demeanour, the landlord unlocked the door. Madge\r\nflew back to the cottage.\r\n\r\n\"Ab,\" said she, rushing in with an armful of sticks to make a blaze,\r\n\"you'll want your supper.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply was a blow which doubled her up in a corner senseless.\r\n\r\nAbsalom sat for a while sullenly glowering over the embers, and then\r\nwent to bed, leaving Madge sobbing on the bare, hard earthen floor. It\r\nwas midnight before she crept to his side.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning Absalom got up and dressed. Madge was sleeping\r\nsoundly, a dark circle under each eye; she had cried herself to sleep.\r\nHe went out and left her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nSix weeks passed, and Absalom did not return. Madge went over to her\r\nmother. \"He bean't come,\" she said, beginning to cry.\r\n\r\n\"I knowed a wassn't,\" said the old woman, rocking herself to and fro in\r\nher low rush-bottomed chair, with her feet on the hearth, almost among\r\nthe ashes. \"Thee's soon have to look out for theeself.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cos I'm going to die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"I be goin' to die,\" repeated the old woman in the same calm, hard tone.\r\nA life of incessant labour had crushed all sentiment out of her--except\r\nsuperstition--and she faced the hard facts of existence without emotion.\r\n\r\nMadge began to weep.\r\n\r\n\"Thee go and shut up the cottage, wench, and come and bide wi' I.\"\r\n\r\nMadge did so. In a few days the old woman took to her bed. She had it\r\ndragged out of the next room--there was but one floor--and placed near\r\nthe fire, which was constantly kept up. Madge waited on her assiduously\r\nwhen she was not out of doors at field-work. Work was growing scarcer\r\nand scarcer as the winter advanced. The old woman slowly grew weaker and\r\nweaker, till Madge could leave her no longer. So she stayed at home, and\r\nso lost the little employment she had. One evening, when the firelight\r\nwas growing low and dark shadows were flickering over the ceiling, the\r\nold woman seemed to recover a little strength, and sat up in bed.\r\n\r\n\"Madge!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thee must promise I one thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What be it, mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"As thee won't have I buried by the parish.\"\r\n\r\nMadge began to cry.\r\n\r\n\"Dost thee hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't.\"\r\n\r\nA long silence.\r\n\r\n\"Madge!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thee go to the fire. Dost thee see that brick in the chimbley as sticks\r\nout a little way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pull it out.\"\r\n\r\nMadge caught hold, and after a few tugs pulled the brick out.\r\n\r\n\"Put thee hand in!\"\r\n\r\nMadge thrust hand and arm into the cavity, and brought out a dirty\r\nstocking.\r\n\r\n\"Has thee got th' stocking?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bury I wi' wots in thur, and take care o' the rest on't. Thee's want it\r\nbad enough afore th' spring comes.\"\r\n\r\nMadge replaced the stocking without examining it. She was heavy at\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBefore morning her mother was dead.\r\n\r\nMadge went back to her own cottage, carrying with her just a sovereign\r\nin sixpences and fourpenny-bits. She sat down and wept. No one came near\r\nher. Her former gossips, always jealous of her beauty, left her alone\r\nwith her sorrow. But she knew that she could not remain idle. Something\r\nmust be done. So she went out to rick-work, but there was none to be\r\nhad. From farm to farm Madge wearily toiled along, meeting the same\r\nanswer everywhere--\"Had got more on now than they could find work for.\"\r\nMadge felt exceedingly ill as she slowly wended her way homewards. Then\r\nfor the first time she remembered that she must shortly become a mother.\r\n\r\nIn her weak state Madge caught cold. She shivered incessantly. The poor\r\nchild could not rise from her bed in the morning, her limbs were so\r\nstiff and her head so bad. She lay there all day, crying to herself.\r\nHunger at last, towards evening, compelled her to get up and seek food.\r\nThere was only a piece of crust in the cupboard and a little lard. She\r\nwas trying to masticate these when there came a tap at the door. \"Come\r\nin,\" said Madge. Farmer Humphreys now appeared in the doorway. He was a\r\nshort, thick man, with a shock-head of yellow hair, small grey eyes, and\r\nlips almost blue.\r\n\r\n\"There be ten weeks' rent a-owing,\" said he, sitting down; \"and we\r\ndon't mean to wait no longer. And there's a half-side o' bacon an' a\r\nload of faggots.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much is it altogether?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seventeen-and-six.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't a-got but a pound, and Absalom bean't come whoam.\"\r\n\r\n\"The vagabond--cuss 'im!\"\r\n\r\n\"A bean't no vagabond,\" cried Madge, firing up in defence of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"Bist thee a-goin' to pay--or bisn't?\" said the fellow, beginning to\r\nbully.\r\n\r\nMadge counted him out the money, and he left, casting an ugly leer on\r\nher as he went.\r\n\r\nHalf-a-crown remained. On that half-crown Madge lived for one whole\r\nmonth. The cold clung to her and grew worse. Her tongue burned and her\r\nlimbs shook; it was fever as well as cold--that low aguish fever, the\r\ncurse of the poor. Bread and lard day by day, bread and lard, and a\r\nlittle weak tea. And at the month's end the half-crown was gone:\r\nsixpence went for her last half-dozen faggots. Madge crawled upstairs\r\nand wrapped herself up in a blanket, sitting on the side of the bed. It\r\nwas her miserable loneliness which troubled the poor child most. Her\r\ncough, and the cold, and want of food and firing, might have been borne\r\nhad there been some one to talk to. But alone they did their work. Her\r\nform was dreadfully shrunken, her hands as thin and bony as those her\r\nold mother last stretched over the fire. The ale-house which had\r\nabsorbed her husband's earnings sent her no aid in this time of\r\ndistress, and he had offended the clergyman who would otherwise have\r\nfound her out. It grew dusky, as the poor creature sat on the edge of\r\nthe bed. Suddenly there was a hand on the latch of the door downstairs.\r\nMadge trembled with eagerness as a heavy step sounded on the\r\nfloor--could it be Absalom? Her black eyes, looking larger from the\r\npaleness of her sunken cheeks, began to blaze with a new light. The\r\nsteps came to the foot of the stairs and began ascending. She listened\r\neagerly. A head of yellow hair came up through the trap-door, and the\r\nsmall grey eyes of young Humphreys leered on her. Disappointed and\r\namazed, Madge remained silent. Humphreys came up and sat on the bed\r\nbeside her.\r\n\r\n\"Thee's got thin,\" he said, with a sort of chuckle. \"Like some grub,\r\nwouldn't ye?\"\r\n\r\nNo answer. He put his hand on her shoulder and muttered something in her\r\near. Madge seemed scarcely to understand him, but sat staring wildly.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give thee sixpence,\" said Humphreys, showing one.\r\n\r\nThen a full sense of his dishonourable intentions, mingled with shame\r\nand disgust at his unutterable meanness, came over Madge, and rising\r\nwith a flush on her cheek, she struck him with all her might. It was a\r\nfeeble blow, but he was unprepared: it over-balanced him; he staggered\r\nbackwards, and fell heavily down the stairs. Madge, her heart beating\r\npainfully fast, leaned back on the bed and listened. There was not a\r\nsound. A dreadful thought that he might be killed flashed across her\r\nmind. Her impulse was to go down and see, but her strength failed, and\r\nshe sat down again and waited. It seemed hours before she heard him stir\r\nand, after a noise like a great dog shaking himself, with mingled curses\r\nand threats, leave the house. Then a great pain came over her. She felt\r\nas if she should die, but the greatest dread was the dread of\r\nloneliness. She staggered to the window and looked out. A boy was\r\npassing, and she told him to go to Mrs. Green's and send her down. Then\r\nshe fell on the bed in a faint, with the window open and the cold,\r\nbitter, biting east wind blowing in.\r\n\r\nIt was half a mile to Mrs. Green's--one of Madge's old gossips. The boy\r\ngot there in two hours. Mrs. Green was putting her baby to bed, but\r\ninstantly transferred that duty to her eldest girl, and went off eager\r\nfor news.\r\n\r\nAt nine that night the \"Good Woman\" inn resounded with talk of Madge.\r\nNot a bit nor a drop was there in the house, according to Mrs. Green.\r\nThe landlord said Absalom owed him two shillings unpaid score: he could\r\nforgive her the debt, but he couldn't give nothing. Mrs. Green went home\r\nfor her supper, and returning, found Madge conscious. She would not have\r\nthe parish doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Bellows,\" the tinker, had during these late months been out on an\r\nitinerant journey. He came home that night, and at the \"Good Woman\"\r\nheard the news. His quick wit put him up to a plan to serve the poor\r\ngirl. Early in the morning he took his pack and went through the village\r\nup to the Rev. Mr. Horton's. There, under pretence of asking for kettles\r\nto mend, he told the most dismal tale to the housemaid. At\r\nbreakfast-time this was reported to Mrs. Horton. Distress at such a time\r\nwas sufficient to engage any lady's attention. Mrs. Horton was a frail,\r\ntender woman, but earnest in works of charity. The ponies were ordered,\r\nand down they drove. The tale was not overdrawn. \"Not a crust in the\r\ncupboard--not a stick to light a fire: the poor creature starved,\r\nand--and--you know, coming,\" said the good lady afterwards, describing\r\nthe scene. \"John drove after the doctor instantly, and I stayed. Poor\r\ngirl! It was still-born; and she, poor thing! we saw, could not live\r\nlong.\"\r\n\r\nMadge, indeed, died the same night, totally worn out at nineteen.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd Absalom? He had gone to work on a distant railway as a navvy, and,\r\nearning good wages and able to enjoy himself nightly at the taverns,\r\nforgot poor Madge. Months went on. News travels slowly among the poor,\r\nbut at last intelligence did reach him that his mother was dead and\r\nMadge starving. To do him justice, he had never thought of that, and he\r\nstarted at once for home, travelling on foot. But passing through a\r\nvillage with his bundle on his shoulders, he was arrested by a policeman\r\nwho observed some blood on it. It was on the slop he had worn in the\r\nfight at the \"Good Woman,\" and came only from the nose. But there had\r\nbeen a brutal murder in the neighbourhood, the public mind was excited,\r\nand Absalom was remanded for inquiries. It took a fortnight to prove his\r\nidentity, and by then Madge was dead.\r\n\r\nAbsalom went back to the railway and drank harder than ever. It was\r\nobserved that he drank now by himself and for drinking's sake, whereas\r\nbefore he had only been fond of liquor with company. After a year he\r\nfound his way back home. Madge was forgotten, and he easily got work.\r\nLikely young men are not so common on farms: strict inquiries are rarely\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe last that was heard of him appeared in the local newspaper:--\r\n\r\n\"DRUNK AND DISORDERLY.--Absalom White was brought up in custody, charged\r\nwith obstructing the road while in a state of intoxication. Fined five\r\nshillings and seven-and-six costs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE COMING OF SUMMER._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe June sky is of the deepest blue when seen above the fresh foliage of\r\nthe oaks in the morning before the sun has filled the heavens with his\r\nmeridian light. To see the blue at its best it needs something to form a\r\nscreen so that the azure may strike the eye with its fulness\r\nundiminished by its own beauty; for if you look at the open sky such a\r\nbreadth of the same hue tones itself down. But let the eye rise upwards\r\nalong a wall of oak spray, then at the rim the rich blue is thick, quite\r\nthick, opaque, and steeped in luscious colour. Unless, indeed, upon the\r\nhigh downs,--there the June sky is too deep even for the brilliance of\r\nthe light, and requires no more screen than the hand put up to shade the\r\neyes. These level plains by the Thames are different, and here I like to\r\nsee the sky behind and over an oak.\r\n\r\nAbout Surbiton the oaks come out into leaf earlier than in many places;\r\nthis spring[2] there were oak-leaves appearing on April 24, yet so\r\nbackward are some of them that, while all the rest were green, there\r\nwere two in the hedge of a field by the Ewell road still dark within ten\r\ndays of June. They looked dark because their trunks and boughs were\r\nleafless against a background of hawthorn, elm, and other trees in full\r\nfoliage, the clover flowering under them, and May bloom on the hedge.\r\nThey were black as winter, and even now, on the 1st of June, the leaves\r\nare not fully formed. The trees flowered in great perfection this\r\nspring; many oaks were covered with their green pendants, and they hung\r\nfrom the sycamores. Except the chestnuts, whose bloom can hardly be\r\noverlooked, the flowering of the trees is but little noticed; the elm is\r\none of the earliest, and becomes ruddy--it is as early as the catkins on\r\nthe hazel; willow, aspen, oak, sycamore, ash, all have flower or\r\ncatkin--even the pine, whose fructification is very interesting. The\r\npines or Scotch firs by the Long Ditton road hang their sweeping\r\nbranches to the verge of the footpath, and the new cones, the sulphur\r\nfarina, and the fresh shoots are easily seen. The very earliest oak to\r\nput forth its flowers is in a garden on Oak Hill; it is green with them,\r\nwhile yet the bitter winds have left a sense of winter in the air.\r\n\r\nThere is a broad streak of bright-yellow charlock--in the open arable\r\nfield beyond the Common. It lights up the level landscape; the glance\r\nfalls on it immediately. Field beans are in flower, and their scent\r\ncomes sweet even through the dust of the Derby Day. Red heads of\r\ntrifolium dot the ground; the vetches have long since been out, and are\r\nso still; along the hedges parsley forms a white fringe. The charlock\r\nseems late this year; it is generally up well before June--the first\r\nflowers by the roadside or rickyard, in a waste dry corner. Such dry\r\nwaste places send up plants to flower, such as charlock and poppy,\r\nquicker than happens in better soil, but they do not reach nearly the\r\nheight or size. The field beans are short from lack of rain; there are\r\nsome reeds in the ditch by them, and these too are short; they have not\r\nhalf shot up yet, for the same reason. On the sward by the Long Ditton\r\nroad the goat's-beard is up; it grows to some size there every season,\r\nbut is not very common elsewhere. It is said to close its sepals at\r\nnoon, and was therefore called \"Jack-go-to-bed-at-noon,\" but in fact it\r\nshuts much earlier, and often does not open at all, and you may pass\r\ntwenty times and not see it open. Its head is like that of the\r\ndandelion, and children blow it to see what's o'clock in the same way.\r\nIt forms a large ball, and browner; dandelion seed-balls are white. The\r\ngrass is dotted with them now; they give a glossy, silky appearance to\r\nthe meadows. Tiny pink geranium flowers show on bunches of dusty grass;\r\nsilver weed lays its yellow buttercup-like flower on the ground, placing\r\nit in the angle of the road and the sward, where the sward makes a\r\nridge. Cockspur grass--three claws and a spur like a cock's foot--is\r\nalready whitened with pollen; already in comparison, for the grasses are\r\nlate to lift their heads this summer. As the petals of the May fall the\r\nyoung leaves appear, small and green, to gradually enlarge through the\r\nhay-time.\r\n\r\nA slight movement of the leaves on a branch of birch shows that\r\nsomething living is there, and presently the little head and neck of a\r\nwhitethroat peers over them, and then under, looking above and beneath\r\neach leaf, and then with a noiseless motion passing on to the next.\r\nAnother whitethroat follows immediately, and there is not a leaf\r\nforgotten nor a creeping thing that can hide from them. Every tree and\r\nevery bush is visited by these birds, and others of the insect-feeders;\r\nthe whole summer's day they are searching, and the caterpillar, as it\r\ncomes down on a thread, slipping from the upper branches, only drops\r\ninto their beaks. Birds, too, that at other periods feed on grain and\r\nseed, now live themselves, and bring up their young, upon insects.\r\n\r\nI went to look over a gate to see how the corn was rising--it is so\r\nshort, now in June, that it will not hide a hare--and on coming near\r\nthere was a cock chaffinch perched on the top, a fine bird in full\r\ncolour. He did not move though I was now within three yards, nor till I\r\ncould have almost touched him did he fly; he had a large caterpillar in\r\nhis beak, and no doubt his nest or the young from it were in the hedge.\r\nIn feeding the young birds the old ones always perch first at a short\r\ndistance, and after waiting a minute proceed to their fledgelings.\r\nShould a blackbird come at full speed across the meadow and stay on a\r\nhedge-top, and then go down into the mound, it is certain that his nest\r\nis there. If a thrush frequents a tree, flying up into the branches for\r\na minute and then descending into the underwood, most likely the young\r\nthrushes are there.\r\n\r\nLittle indeed do the birds care for appropriate surroundings; anything\r\ndoes for them, they do not aim at effect. I heard a tit-lark singing his\r\nloudest, and found him perched on the edge of a tub, formed of a barrel\r\nsawn in two, placed in the field for the horses to drink from, as there\r\nwas no pond. Some swallows are very fond of a notice-board fastened to a\r\npole beside the Hogsmill bank. Upon its upper edge they perch and\r\ntwitter sweetly. There is a muddy pond by Tolworth Farm, near the road;\r\nit is muddy because a herd of cows drink from and stand in it, stirring\r\nup the bottom. An elm overhangs it, and the lower boughs are dead and\r\nleafless. On these there are always swallows twittering over the water.\r\nGrey and yellow wagtails run along the verge. In the morning the flock\r\nof goslings who began to swim in the pond, now grown large and grey,\r\narrange themselves in a double row, some twenty or thirty of them, in\r\nloose order, tuck their bills under their wings and sleep. Two old birds\r\nstand in the rear as if in command of the detachment. A sow, plastered\r\nwith mud like the rhinoceri in the African lakes, lies on the edge of\r\nthe brown water, so nearly the hue of the water and the mire, and so\r\nexactly at their juncture, as to be easily overlooked. But the sweet\r\nsummer swallows sing on the branches; they do not see the wallowing\r\nanimal, they see only the sunshine and the summer, golden buttercups and\r\nblue sky.\r\n\r\nIn the hollow at Long Ditton I had the delight, a day or two since, to\r\nsee a kingfisher. There is a quiet lane, and at the bottom, in a valley,\r\ntwo ponds, one in enclosed grounds, the other in a meadow opposite.\r\nStanding there a minute to see if there was a martin among the birds\r\nwith which the pond in the grounds is thickly covered, something came\r\nshooting straight towards me, and swerving only a yard or two to pass\r\nme, a kingfisher went by. His blue wings, his ruddy front, the white\r\nstreak beside his neck, and long bill, were all visible for a moment;\r\nthen he was away straight over the meadow, the directness of his course\r\nenabling it to be followed for some time till he cleared the distant\r\nhedge, probably going to visit his nest. Kingfishers, though living by\r\nthe stream, often build a good way from water. The months have\r\nlengthened into years since I saw one here before, sitting on the trunk\r\nof a willow which bends over the pond in the mead. The tree rises out of\r\nthe water and is partly in it; it is hung with moss, and the kingfisher\r\nwas on the trunk within a foot or so of the surface. After that there\r\ncame severe winters, and till now I did not see another here. So that\r\nthe bird came upon me unexpectedly out from the shadow of the trees that\r\noverhang the water, past me, and on into the sunshine over the\r\nbuttercups and sorrel of the field.\r\n\r\nThis hollow at Long Ditton is the very place of singing birds; never was\r\nsuch a place for singing--the valley is full of music. In the oaks\r\nblackbirds whistle. You do not often see them; they are concealed by the\r\nthick foliage up on high, for they seek the top branches, which are more\r\nleafy; but once now and then they quietly flutter across to another\r\nperch. The blackbird's whistle is very human, like a human being playing\r\nthe flute; an uncertain player, now drawing forth a bar of a beautiful\r\nmelody and then losing it again. He does not know what quiver or what\r\nturn his note will take before it ends; the note leads him and completes\r\nitself. It is a song which strives to express the singer's keen delight,\r\nthe singer's exquisite appreciation of the loveliness of the days; the\r\ngolden glory of the meadow, the light, the luxurious shadows, the\r\nindolent clouds reclining on their azure couch. Such thoughts can only\r\nbe expressed in fragments, like a sculptor's chips thrown off as the\r\ninspiration seizes him, not mechanically sawn to a set line. Now and\r\nagain the blackbird feels the beauty of the time, the large white daisy\r\nstars, the grass with yellow-dusted tips, the air which comes so softly\r\nunperceived by any precedent rustle of the hedge, the water which runs\r\nslower, held awhile by rootlet, flag, and forget-me-not. He feels the\r\nbeauty of the time and he must say it. His notes come like wild flowers,\r\nnot sown in order. The sunshine opens and shuts the stops of his\r\ninstrument. There is not an oak without a blackbird, and there are\r\nothers afar off in the hedges. The thrushes sing louder here than\r\nanywhere; they really seem to have louder notes; they are all round.\r\nThrushes appear to vary their songs with the period of the year; they\r\nsing loudly now, but more plaintively and delicately in the autumn.\r\nWarblers and willow wrens sing out of sight among the trees; they are\r\neasily hidden by a leaf; ivy-leaves are so smooth, with an enamelled\r\nsurface, that high up, as the wind moves them, they reflect the sunlight\r\nand scintillate. Greenfinches in the elms never cease love-making, and\r\nlove-making needs much soft talking. There is a nightingale in a bush by\r\nthe lane which sings so loud the hawthorn seems to shake with the vigour\r\nof his song; too loud, though a nightingale, if you stand at the verge\r\nof the boughs, as he would let you without alarm; farther away it\r\nbecomes sweet and softer. Yellowhammers call from the trees up towards\r\nthe arable fields. There are but a few of them: it is the place of\r\nsinging birds.\r\n\r\nThe doves in the copse are nearer the house this year; I see them more\r\noften in the field at the end of the garden. As the dove rises the white\r\nfringe on the tip of the tail becomes visible, especially when flying up\r\ninto a tree. One afternoon one flew up into a hornbeam close to the\r\ngarden, beside it in fact, and perched there full in view, not twenty\r\nyards at farthest. At first he sat upright, raising his neck and\r\nwatching us in the garden; then, in a minute or so, turned and fluttered\r\ndown to his nest. The wood-pigeons are more quiet now; their\r\nwhoo-hoo-ing is not so frequently heard. By the sounds up in the elms at\r\nthe top of the Brighton road (at the end of Langley Lane) the young\r\nrooks have not yet all flown, though it is the end of the first week in\r\nJune. There is a little pond near the rookeries, and by it a row of\r\nelms. From one of these a heavy bough has just fallen without the least\r\napparent cause. There is no sign of lightning, nor does it even look\r\ndecayed; the wood has fractured short off; it came down with such force\r\nthat the ends of the lesser branches are broken and turned up, though,\r\nas it was the lowest limb, it had not far to fall, showing the weight of\r\nthe timber. There has been no hurricane of wind, nothing at all to cause\r\nit, yet this thick bough snapped. No other tree is subject to these\r\ndangerous falls of immense limbs, without warning or apparent cause, so\r\nthat it is not safe to rest under elms. An accident might not occur once\r\nin ten years; nevertheless the risk is there. Elms topple over before\r\ngales which scarcely affect other trees, or only tear off a few twigs.\r\nTwo have thus been thrown recently--within eighteen months--in the\r\nfields opposite Tolworth Farm. The elm drags up its own roots, which are\r\noften only a fringe round its butt, and leaves a hollow in the earth, as\r\nif it had been simply stood on end and held by these guy-ropes. Other\r\ntrees do, indeed, fall in course of time, but not till they are\r\nobviously on the point of tottering, but the elm goes down in full pride\r\nof foliage. By this pond there is a rough old oak, which is the\r\npeculiar home of some titmice; they were there every day, far back on\r\nthe frost and snow, and their sharp notes sounded like some one chipping\r\nthe ice on the horse-pond with an iron instrument. Probably, before now,\r\nthey have had a nest in a crevice.\r\n\r\nThe tallest grass yet to be seen is in a little orchard on the\r\nright-hand side of the Long Ditton road. This little orchard is a\r\nfavourite spot of mine, meaning, of course, to look at: it is a natural\r\norchard and left to itself. The palings by the road are falling, and\r\nheld up chiefly by the brambles and the ivy that has climbed up them.\r\nThere are trees on the left and trees on the right; a fine spruce fir at\r\nthe back. The apple-trees are not set in straight lines; they were at\r\nfirst, but some have died away and left an irregularity. The trees\r\nthemselves lean this way and that; they are scarred and marked, as it\r\nwere, with lichen and moss. It is the home of birds. A blackbird had a\r\nnest this spring in the bushes on the left side, a nightingale in the\r\nbushes on the right side, and there he sang and sang for hours every\r\nmorning. A sharp, relentless shrike lives in one of the trees close by,\r\nand is perpetually darting across the road upon insects on the sward\r\namong the fern there. There are several thrushes who reside in this\r\norchard besides the lesser birds. Swallows sometimes twitter from the\r\ntops of the apple-trees. As the grass is so safe from intrusion, one of\r\nthe earliest buttercups flowers here. The apple-bloom appears rosy on\r\nthe bare boughs only lately scourged by the east wind. After a time the\r\ntrees are in full bloom, set about into the green of the hedges and\r\nbushes and the dark spruce behind. Bennets, the flower of the grass,\r\ncome up. The first bennet is to green things what a swallow is to the\r\nbreathing creatures of summer. White horse-chestnut blooms stand up in\r\ntheir stately way, lighting the path, which is strewn with fallen\r\noak-flower. May appears on the hawthorn: there is an early bush of it.\r\nNow the grass is so high the flowers are lost under it; even the\r\nbuttercups are overtopped; and soon as the young apples take form and\r\nshape white bramble-bloom will cover the bushes by the palings. Acorns\r\nwill show on the oaks: the berries will ripen from red to black\r\nbeneath. Along the edge of the path, where the dandelions and plantains\r\nare thick with seed, the greenfinches will come down and select those\r\nthey like best: this they often do by the footpath beside the road.\r\nLastly, the apples become red; the beech in the corner has an orange\r\nspray, and cones hang long and brown upon the spruce. The thrushes after\r\nsilence sing again, and autumn approaches. But, pass when you may, this\r\nlittle orchard has always something, because it is left to itself--I had\r\nwritten neglected. I struck the word out, for this is not neglect, this\r\nis true attention, to leave it to itself, so that the young trees trail\r\nover the bushes and stay till the berries fall of their own\r\nover-ripeness, if perchance spared by the birds; so that the dead brown\r\nleaves lie and are not swept away unless the wind pleases; so that all\r\nthings follow their own course and bent. Almost opposite, by autumn,\r\nwhen the reapers are busy with the sheaves, the hedge is white with the\r\nlarge trumpet-flowers of the greater convolvulus. The hedgerow seems\r\nmade of convolvulus then, nothing but convolvulus; nowhere else does the\r\nflower flourish so strongly, and the bines remain till the following\r\nspring. This little orchard, without a path through it, without a\r\nborder, or a parterre, or a terrace, is a place to sit down and dream\r\nin, notwithstanding that it touches the road, for thus left to itself it\r\nhas acquired an atmosphere of peace and stillness such as belongs to and\r\ngrows up in woods and far-away coombs of the hills. A stray passer-by\r\nwould go on without even noticing it, it is so commonplace and\r\nunpretentious, merely a corner of meadow irregularly dotted with\r\napple-trees; a place that needs frequent glances and a dreamy mood to\r\nunderstand as the birds understand it. They are always here, even in the\r\nwinter, starlings and blackbirds particularly, who resort to a kind of\r\nfurrow there, which, even in frost, seems to afford them some food. In\r\nthe spring thrushes move along, rustling the fallen leaves as they\r\nsearch behind the arum-sheaths unrolling beside the palings, or under\r\nthe shelter of the group of trees where arum-roots are plentiful. There\r\nare nooks and corners from which shy creatures can steal out from the\r\nshadow and be happy. The dew falls softly, more noiseless than snow, and\r\na star shines to the north over the spruce fir. By day there is a\r\nloving streak of sunshine somewhere among the tree-trunks; by night a\r\nstar above. The trees are nothing to speak of in size or height, but\r\nthey seem always to bloom well and to be fruitful; tree-climbers run up\r\nthese and then go off to the elms.\r\n\r\nBeside the Long Ditton road, up the gentle incline on the left side, the\r\nbroad sward is broken by thickets and brake like those of a forest. If a\r\nforest were cleared, as those in America are swept away before the axe,\r\nbut a line of underwood left beside the highway, the result would be\r\nmuch the same as may be seen here when the bushes and fern are in\r\nperfection. Thick hawthorn bushes stand at unequal distances surrounded\r\nwith brake; one with a young oak in the centre. Fern extends from one\r\nthicket to the other, and brambles fence the thorns, which are\r\nthemselves well around. From such coverts the boar was started in old\r\nEnglish days, the fawns hide behind and about them even now in many a\r\nfair park, and where there are no deer they are frequented by hares. So\r\nnear the dust which settles on them as the wheels raise it, of course,\r\nevery dog that passes runs through, and no game could stay an hour, but\r\nthey are the exact kind of cover game like. One morning this spring,\r\nindeed, I noticed a cock-pheasant calmly walking along the ridge of a\r\nfurrow in the ploughed field, parted from these bushes by the hedge. He\r\nwas so near the highway that I could see the ring about his neck. I have\r\nseen peewits or green plovers in the same field, which is now about to\r\nbe built on. But though no game could stay an hour in such places,\r\nlesser birds love them, white-throats build there, gold-crests come down\r\nfrom the dark pines opposite--they seem fond of pines--yellow-hammers\r\nsit and sing on them, and they are visited all day long by one or other.\r\nThe little yellow flowers of tormentil are common in the grass as autumn\r\napproaches, and grasshoppers, which do not seem plentiful here, sing\r\nthere. Some betony flowers are opposite on the other sward. There is a\r\nmarshy spot by one of the bushes where among the rushes various\r\nsemi-aquatic grasses grow. Blackberries are thick in favourable\r\nseasons--like all fruit, they are an uncertain crop; and hawkweeds are\r\nthere everywhere on the sward towards the edge. The peculiar green of\r\nfern, which is more of a relief to the eye than any other shrub with\r\nwhich I am acquainted, so much so that I wonder it is not more imitated,\r\nis remarkable here when the burning July sun shines on the white dust\r\nthus fringed. By then trees are gone off in colour, the hedges are tired\r\nwith heat, but the fern is a soft green which holds the glance. This\r\nvaries much with various seasons; this year the fern is particularly\r\nlate from a lack of moisture, but sometimes it is really beautiful\r\nbetween these bushes. It is cut down in its full growth by those who\r\nhave charge of the road, and the scene is entirely destroyed for the\r\nremainder of the season; it is not often that such bushes and such fern\r\nare found beside the highway, and, if not any annoyance to the\r\nresidents, are quite as worthy of preservation (not \"preservation\" by\r\nbeadle) as open spaces like commons. Children, and many of larger\r\ngrowth, revel about them, gathering the flowers in spring and summer,\r\nthe grasses and the blackberries in autumn. It is but a strip of sward,\r\nbut it is as wild as if in the midst of a forest. A pleasure to every\r\none--therefore destroy it.\r\n\r\nIn the evening from the rise of the road here I sometimes hear the cry\r\nof a barn owl skirting the hedge of Southborough Park, and disappearing\r\nunder the shadow of the elms that stand there. The stars appear and the\r\nwhole dome of the summer night is visible, for in a level plain like\r\nthis a slight elevation brings the horizon into view. Without moon the\r\nJune nights are white; a faint white light shows through the trees of\r\nSouthborough Park northwards; the west has not lost all its tint over\r\nthe Ditton hollow; white flowers stand in the grass; white road, white\r\nflint-heaps even, white clouds, and the stars, too, light without\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nBy day the breeze comes south and west, free over fields, over corn and\r\ngrass and hedgerow; so slight a mound as this mere rise in the\r\nriver-side plain lifts you up into the current of the air. Where the\r\nwind comes the sunlight is purer.\r\n\r\nThe sorrel is now high and ripening in the little meadows beside the\r\nroad just beyond the orchard. As it ripens the meadow becomes red, for\r\nthe stalks rise above the grass. This is the beginning of the feast of\r\nseeds. The sorrel ripens just as the fledgelings are leaving the nest;\r\nif you watch the meadow a minute you will see the birds go out to it,\r\nnow flying up a moment and then settling again. After a while comes the\r\nfeast of grain; then another feast of seeds among the stubble, and the\r\nample fields, and the furze of the hills; then berries, and then winter,\r\nand the last seed.\r\n\r\nA June rose. Something caught my eye on the top of the high hawthorn\r\nhedge beside the Brighton road one evening as it was growing dusk, and\r\non looking again there was a spray of briar in flower, two roses in full\r\nbloom and out of reach, and one spray of three growing buds. So it is\r\never with the June rose. It is found unexpectedly, and when you are not\r\nlooking for it. It is a gift, not a discovery, or anything earned--a\r\ngift like love and happiness. With ripening grasses the rose comes, and\r\nthe rose is summer: till then it is spring. On the green banks--waste\r\nplaces--beside the \"New Road\" (Kingsdown Road formerly) the streaked\r\npink convolvulus is in flower; a sign that the spring forces have spent\r\nthemselves, that the sun is near his fulness. The flower itself is\r\nshapely, yet it is not quite welcome; it says too plainly that we are\r\nnear the meridian. There are months of warmth to follow--brilliant\r\nsunshine and new beauties; but the freshness, the joyous looking forward\r\nof spring is gone. Upon these banks the first coltsfoot flowers in\r\nMarch, the first convolvulus in summer, and almost the last hawkweed in\r\nautumn. A yellow vetchling, too, is now opening its yellow petals beside\r\nthe Long Ditton road: another summer flower, which comes in as the blue\r\nveronica is leaving the sward.\r\n\r\nAs tall as the young corn the mayweed fringes the arable fields with its\r\nwhite rays and yellow centre, somewhat as the broad moon-daisies stand\r\nin the grass. By this time generally the corn is high above the mayweed,\r\nbut this year the flower is level with its shelter. The pale corn\r\nbuttercup is in flower by the New Road, not in the least overshadowed by\r\nthe crops at the edge of which it grows. By the stream through Tolworth\r\nCommon spotted persicaria is rising thickly, but even this\r\nstrong-growing plant is backward and checked on the verge of the\r\nshrunken stream. The showers that have since fallen have not made up for\r\nthe lack of the April rains, which in the most literal sense cause the\r\nflowers of May and June. Without those early spring rains the wild\r\nflowers cannot push their roots and develop their stalks in time for the\r\nsummer sun. The sunshine and heat finds them unprepared. In the ditches\r\nthe square-stemmed figwort is conspicuous by its dark green. It is very\r\nplentiful about Surbiton. Just outside the garden in a waste corner the\r\nyellow flowers of celandine are overhung by wild hops and white bryony,\r\ntwo strong plants of which have climbed up the copse hedge, twining in\r\nand out each other. Both have vine-like leaves; but the hops are\r\nwrinkled, those of the bryony hairy or rough to the touch. The hops seem\r\nto be the most powerful, and hold the bryony in the background. The\r\nyoung spruce firs which the wood-pigeon visited in the spring with an\r\nidea of building there look larger and thicker now the fresh green\r\nneedles have appeared.\r\n\r\nIn the woodland lane to Claygate the great elder-bushes are coming into\r\nflower, each petal a creamy-white. The dogwood, too, is opening, and the\r\nwild guelder-roses there are in full bloom. There is a stile from which\r\na path leads across the fields thence to Hook. The field by the stile\r\nwas fed off in spring, and now is yellow with birdsfoot lotus, which\r\ntints it because the grass is so short. From the grass at every footstep\r\na crowd of little \"hoppers\" leap in every direction, scattering\r\nthemselves hastily abroad. The little mead by the copse here is more\r\nopen to the view this year, as the dry winter has checked the growth of\r\nferns and rushes. There is a flock of missel-thrushes in it: the old\r\nbirds feed the young, who can fly well in the centre of the field.\r\nLesser birds come over from the hedges to the bunches of rushes. Slowly\r\nwandering along the lane and looking over the mound on the right hand\r\n(cow-wheat with yellow lip is in flower on the mound), there are\r\nglimpses between the bushes and the Spanish chestnut-trees of far-away\r\nblue hills--blue under the summer sky.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE GOLDEN-CRESTED WREN._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lovely little bird is so small and light that it can cling\r\nsuspended on the end of a single narrow leaf, or needle of pine, and it\r\ndoes not depress the least branch on which it may alight. The gold-crest\r\nfrequents the loneliest heath, the deepest pine wood, and the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of dwellings indifferently. A Scotch fir or pine grew so\r\nnear a house in which I once lived that the boughs almost brushed the\r\nwindow, and when confined to my room by illness, it gave me much\r\npleasure to watch a pair of these wrens who frequently visited the tree.\r\nThey are also fond of thick thorn hedges, and, like all birds, have\r\ntheir favourite localities, so that if you see them once or twice in one\r\nplace you should mark the tree or bush, for there they are almost\r\ncertain to return. It would be quite possible for a person to pass\r\nseveral years in the country and never see one of these birds. There is\r\na trick in finding birds' nests, and a trick in seeing birds. The first\r\nI noticed was in an orchard; soon after, I found a second in a yew-tree\r\n(close to a window), and after that constantly came upon them as they\r\ncrept through brambles or in hedgerows, or a mere speck up in a\r\nfir-tree. So soon as I had seen one I saw plenty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_AN EXTINCT RACE._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is something very mournful in a deserted house, and the feeling is\r\nstill further intensified if it happens to have once been a school,\r\nwhere a minor world played out its little drama, and left its history\r\nwritten on the walls. For a great boys' school is like a kingdom with\r\nits monarchs, its ministers, and executioners, and even its changes of\r\ndynasty. Such a house stood no long while since on the northern\r\nborder-land of Wilts and Berks, a mansion in its origin back in the days\r\nof Charles II., and not utterly unconnected with the great events of\r\nthose times, but which, for hard on a hundred years--from the middle of\r\nthe eighteenth to the middle of the nineteenth century--was used as a\r\nsuperior grammar-school, or college, as it would now be called.\r\nGradually falling in reputation, and supplanted by modern rivals for\r\nfifteen or twenty years, the huge hollow halls and endless dormitories\r\nwere silent, and the storms that sway with savage force down from the\r\nhills wreaked their will upon the windows and the rotting roof. Inside\r\nthe refectory--the windows being blown in--and over the antique-carved\r\nmantelpiece, two swallows' nests had been built to the ceiling or\r\ncornice. The whitewashed walls were yellow and green with damp, and\r\ncovered with patches of saltpetre efflorescence. But they still bore,\r\nlegible and plain, the hasty inscriptions scrawled on them, years and\r\nyears before, by hands then young, but by now returned to dust. The\r\nhistory of this little kingdom, the hopes and joys, the fears and\r\nhatreds of the subjects, still remained, and might be gathered from\r\nthese writings on the walls, just as are the history of Egypt and of\r\nAssyria now deciphered from the palaces and tombs. Here were the names\r\nof the kings--the head-masters--generally with some rough doggerel\r\nverse, not often very flattering, and illustrated with outline\r\nportraits. Here were caricatures of the ushers and tutors, hidden in\r\nsome corner of the dormitories once, no doubt, concealed by the\r\nfurniture, coupled with the very freest personalities, mostly in pencil,\r\nbut often done with a burnt stick. Dates were scattered everywhere--not\r\noften the year, but the day of the month, doubtless memorable from some\r\nexpedition or lark played off half a century since. Now and then there\r\nwas a quotation from the classics--one describing the groaning and\r\nshouting of the dying Hercules, till the rocks and the sad hills\r\nresounded, which irresistibly suggested the idea of a thorough caning.\r\nOther inscriptions were a mixture of Latin and any English words that\r\nhappened to rhyme, together producing the most extraordinary jumble.\r\nWhere now are the merry hearts that traced these lines upon the plaster\r\nin an idle mood? Attached to the mansion was a great garden, or rather\r\nwilderness, with yew hedges ten feet high and almost as thick, a\r\nsplendid filbert walk, an orchard, with a sun-dial. It is all--mansion\r\nand garden, noble yew-tree hedges and filbert walk, sun-dial and\r\nall--swept away now. The very plaster upon which generation after\r\ngeneration of boys recorded their history has been torn down, and has\r\ncrumbled into dust. Greater kingdoms than this have disappeared since\r\nthe world began, leaving not a sign even of their former existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_ORCHIS MASCULA._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Orchis mascula_ grew in the brook corner, and in early spring sent\r\nup a tall spike of purple flowers. This plant stood alone in an angle of\r\nthe brook and a hedge, within sound of water ceaselessly falling over a\r\ndam. In those days it had an aspect of enchantment to me; not only on\r\naccount of its singular appearance, so different from other flowers, but\r\nbecause in old folios I had read that it could call up the passion of\r\nlove. There was something in the root beneath the sward which could make\r\na heart beat faster. The common modern books--I call them common of\r\n_malice prepense_--were silent on these things. Their dry and formal\r\nknowledge was without interest, mere lists of petals and pistils, a\r\ndried herbarium of plants that fell to pieces at the touch of the\r\nfingers. Only by chipping away at hard old Latin, contracted and dogged\r\nin more senses than one, and by gathering together scattered passages in\r\nclassic authors, could anything be learned. Then there arose another\r\ndifficulty, how to identify the magic plants? The same description will\r\nvery nearly fit several flowers, especially when not actually in flower;\r\nhow determine which really was the true root? The uncertainty and\r\nspeculation kept up the pleasure, till at last I should not have cared\r\nto have had the original question answered. With my gun under my arm I\r\nused to look at the orchis from time to time, so long as the spotted\r\nleaves were visible, till the grass grew too long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE LIONS IN TRAFALGAR SQUARE._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lions in Trafalgar Square are to me the centre of London. By those\r\nlions began my London work; from them, as spokes from the middle of a\r\nwheel, radiate my London thoughts. Standing by them and looking south\r\nyou have in front the Houses of Parliament, where resides the mastership\r\nof England; at your back is the National Gallery--that is art; and\r\nfarther back the British Museum--books. To the right lies the wealth and\r\nluxury of the West End; to the left the roar and labour, the craft and\r\ngold, of the City. For themselves, they are the only monument in this\r\nvast capital worthy of a second visit as a monument. Over the entire\r\narea covered by the metropolis there does not exist another work of art\r\nin the open air. There are many structures and things, no other art. The\r\noutlines of the great animals, the bold curves and firm touches of the\r\nmaster hand, the deep indents, as it were, of his thumb on the plastic\r\nmetal, all the _technique_ and grasp written there, is legible at a\r\nglance. Then comes the _pose_ and expression of the whole, the calm\r\nstrength in repose, the indifference to little things, the resolute view\r\nof great ones. Lastly, the soul of the maker, the spirit which was taken\r\nfrom nature, abides in the massive bronze. These lions are finer than\r\nthose that crouch in the cages at the Zoological Gardens; these are\r\ntruer and more real, and, besides, these are lions to whom has been\r\nadded the heart of a man. Nothing disfigures them; smoke and, what is\r\nmuch worse, black rain--rain which washes the atmosphere of the\r\nsuspended mud--does not affect them in the least. If the choke-damp of\r\nfog obscures them, it leaves no stain on the design; if the surfaces be\r\nstained, the idea made tangible in metal is not. They are no more\r\ntouched than Time itself by the alternations of the seasons. The only\r\nnoble open-air work of native art in the four-million city, they rest\r\nthere supreme and are the centre. Did such a work exist now in Venice,\r\nwhat immense folios would be issued about it! All the language of the\r\nstudios would be huddled together in piled-up and running-over\r\nlaudation, and curses on our insular swine-eyes that could not see it. I\r\nhave not been to Venice, therefore I do not pretend to a knowledge of\r\nthat mediaeval potsherd; this I do know, that in all the endless pictures\r\non the walls of the galleries in London, year after year exposed and\r\ndisappearing like snow somewhere unseen, never has there appeared one\r\nwith such a subject as this. Weak, feeble, mosaic, gimcrack, coloured\r\ntiles, and far-fetched compound monsters, artificial as the graining on\r\na deal front door, they cannot be compared; it is the gingerbread gilt\r\non a circus car to the column of a Greek temple. This is pure open air,\r\ngrand as Nature herself, because it _is_ Nature with, as I say, the\r\nheart of a man added.\r\n\r\nBut if any one desire the meretricious painting of warm light and cool\r\nyet not hard shade, the effect of colour, with the twitching of\r\ntriangles, the spangles glittering, and all the arrangement contrived to\r\ntake the eye, then he can have it here as well as noble sculpture.\r\nAscend the steps to the National Gallery, and stand looking over the\r\nbalustrade down across the square in summer hours. Let the sun have\r\nsloped enough to throw a slant of shadow outward; let the fountains\r\nsplash whose bubbles restless speak of rest and leisure, idle and\r\ndreamy; let the blue-tinted pigeons nod their heads walking, and anon\r\ncrowd through the air to the roof-tops. Shadow upon the one side, bright\r\nlight upon the other, azure above and swallows. Ever rolling the human\r\nstream flows, mostly on the south side yonder, near enough to be\r\naudible, but toned to bearableness. A stream of human hearts, every atom\r\na living mind filled with what thoughts?--a stream that ran through Rome\r\nonce, but has altered its course and wears away the banks here now and\r\ntriturates its own atoms, the hearts, to dust in the process. Yellow\r\nomnibuses and red cabs, dark shining carriages, chestnut horses, all\r\nrushing, and by their motion mixing their colours so that the commonness\r\nof it disappears and the hues remain, a streak drawn in the groove of\r\nthe street--dashed hastily with thick camel's hair. In the midst the\r\ncalm lions, dusky, unmoved, full always of the one grand idea that was\r\ninfused into them. So full of it that the golden sun and the bright wall\r\nof the eastern houses, the shade that is slipping towards them, the\r\nsweet swallows and the azure sky, all the human stream holds of wealth\r\nand power and coroneted panels--nature, man, and city--pass as naught.\r\nMind is stronger than matter. The soul alone stands when the sun sinks,\r\nwhen the shade is universal night, when the van's wheels are silent and\r\nthe dust rises no more.\r\n\r\nAt summer noontide, when the day surrounds us and it is bright light\r\neven in the shadow, I like to stand by one of the lions and yield to the\r\nold feeling. The sunshine glows on the dusky creature, as it seems, not\r\non the surface, but under the skin, as if it came up from out of the\r\nlimb. The roar of the rolling wheels sinks and becomes distant as the\r\nsound of a waterfall when dreams are coming. All the abundant human life\r\nis smoothed and levelled, the abruptness of the individuals lost in the\r\nflowing current, like separate flowers drawn along in a border, like\r\nmusic heard so far off that the notes are molten and the theme only\r\nremains. The abyss of the sky over and the ancient sun are near. They\r\nonly are close at hand, they and immortal thought. When the yellow\r\nSyrian lions stood in old time of Egypt, then too, the sunlight gleamed\r\non the eyes of men, as now this hour on mine. The same consciousness of\r\nlight, the same sun, but the eyes that saw it and mine, how far apart!\r\nThe immense lion here beside me expresses larger nature--cosmos--the\r\never-existent thought which sustains the world. Massiveness exalts the\r\nmind till the vast roads of space which the sun tramples are as an\r\narm's-length. Such a moment cannot endure long; gradually the roar\r\ndeepens, the current resolves into individuals, the houses return--it is\r\nonly a square.\r\n\r\nBut a square potent. For London is the only _real_ place in the world.\r\nThe cities turn towards London as young partridges run to their mother.\r\nThe cities know that they are not real. They are only houses and\r\nwharves, and bricks and stucco; only outside. The minds of all men in\r\nthem, merchants, artists, thinkers, are bent on London. Thither they go\r\nas soon as they can. San Francisco thinks London; so does St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nMen amuse themselves in Paris; they work in London. Gold is made\r\nabroad, but London has a hook and line on every napoleon and dollar,\r\npulling the round discs hither. A house is not a dwelling if a man's\r\nheart be elsewhere. Now, the heart of the world is in London, and the\r\ncities with the simulacrum of man in them are empty. They are moving\r\nimages only; stand here and you are real.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinted by BALLANTYNE, HANSON & CO.\r\nEdinburgh & London\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Toilers of the Field, by Richard Jefferies",
