To be\r\nsure, he was an Englishman, his dress and manners were irreproachable,\r\nand he was in the prime of ripened youth. Yet Lady Bayrose was too\r\nconscientious a chaperon to be fully satisfied with her countryman's\r\nbare assertion that he was engaged on a diplomatic mission requiring\r\nreticence regarding his identity. She did not see why this should\r\nprevent him from confiding in _her_.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, Winthrope came aboard ship virtually as a member of\r\nher Ladyship's party. He was so quick, so thoughtful of her comfort,\r\nand paid so much more attention to her than to Miss Leslie, that her\r\nLadyship had decided to tolerate him, even before Blake became a factor\r\nin the situation.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment he crossed the gangway the American engineer entered\r\nupon a daily routine of drinking and gambling, varied only by attempts\r\nto strike up an off-hand acquaintance with Miss Leslie. This was\r\nWinthrope's opportunity, and his clever frustration of what Lady\r\nBayrose termed \"that low bounder's impudence\" served to install\r\nhim in the good graces of her Ladyship as well as in the favor of\r\nthe American heiress.\r\n\r\nSuch, at least, was what Winthrope intimated to the persistent engineer\r\nwith a superciliousness of tone and manner that would have stung even a\r\nBritish lackey to resentment. To Blake it was supremely galling. He\r\ncould not rejoin in kind, and the slightest attempt at physical\r\nretort would have meant irons and confinement. It was a British\r\nship. Behind Winthrope was Lady Bayrose; behind her Ladyship, as a\r\nmatter of course, was all the despotic authority of the captain. In\r\nthe circumstances, it was not surprising that the American drank\r\nheavier after each successive goading.\r\n\r\nMeantime the ship, having touched at Port Natal, steamed on up the East\r\nCoast, into the Mozambique Channel.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the cyclone, Blake had withdrawn into his stateroom with\r\na number of bottles, and throughout that fearful afternoon was blissfully\r\nunconscious of the danger. Even when the steamer went on the reef, he\r\nwas only partially roused by the shock.\r\n\r\nHe took a long pull from a quart flask of whiskey, placed the flask\r\nwith great care in his hip pocket, and lurched out through the open\r\ndoorway. There he reeled headlong against the mate, who had rushed below\r\nwith three of the crew to bring up Miss Leslie. The mate cursed him\r\nvirulently, and in the same breath ordered two of the men to fetch him\r\nup on deck.\r\n\r\nThe sea was breaking over the steamer in torrents; but between waves\r\nBlake was dragged across to the side and flung over into the bottom of\r\nthe one remaining boat. He served as a cushion to break the fall of Miss\r\nLeslie, who was tossed in after him. At the same time, Winthrope, frantic\r\nwith fear, scrambled into the bows and cut loose. One of the sailors\r\nleaped, but fell short and went down within arm's length of Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\nShe and Winthrope saw the steamer slip from the reef and sink back into\r\ndeep water, carrying down in the vortex the mate and the few remaining\r\nsailors. After that all was chaos to them. They were driven ashore before\r\nthe terrific gusts of the cyclone, blinded by the stinging spoondrift\r\nto all else but the hell of breakers and coral reefs in whose midst\r\nthey swirled so dizzily. And through it all Blake lay huddled on the\r\nbottom boards, gurgling blithely of spicy zephyrs and swaying hammocks.\r\n\r\nThere came the seemingly final moment when the boat went spinning stern\r\nover prow. . . . .\r\n\r\nHalf sobered, Blake opened his eyes and stared solemnly about him. He\r\nwas given little time to take his bearings. A smother of broken surf\r\ncame seething up from one of the great breakers, to roll him over and\r\nscrape him a little farther up the muddy shore. There the flood deposited\r\nhim for a moment, until it could gather force to sweep back and drag\r\nhim down again toward the roaring sea that had cast him up.\r\n\r\nBlake objected,--not to the danger of being drowned, but to interference\r\nwith his repose. He had reached the obstinate stage. He grunted a\r\nprotest. . . . . Again the flood seethed up the shore, and rolled him\r\naway from the danger. This was too much! He set his jaw, turned over,\r\nand staggered to his feet. Instantly one of the terrific wind-blasts\r\nstruck his broad back and sent him spinning for yards. He brought up\r\nin a shallow pool, beside a hummock.\r\n\r\nUnder the lee of the knoll lay Winthrope and Miss Leslie. Though\r\nconscious, both were draggled and bruised and beaten to exhaustion.\r\nThey were together because they had come ashore together. When the boat\r\ncapsized, Miss Leslie had been flung against the Englishman, and they\r\nhad held fast to each other with the desperate clutch of drowning\r\npersons. Neither of them ever recalled how they gained the shelter of\r\nthe hummock.\r\n\r\nBlake, sitting waist-deep in the pool, blinked at them benignly with\r\nhis pale blue eyes, and produced the quart flask, still a third full of\r\nwhiskey.\r\n\r\n\"I shay, fren's,\" he observed, \"ha' one on me. Won' cos' you\r\nshent--notta re' shent!\"\r\n\r\n\"You fuddled lout!\" shouted Winthrope. \"Come out of that pool.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wassama'er pool! Pool's allri'!\"\r\n\r\nThe Englishman squinted through the driving scud at the intoxicated\r\nman with an anxious frown. In all probability he felt no commiseration\r\nfor the American; but it was no light matter to be flung up barehanded\r\non the most unhealthful and savage stretch of the Mozambique coast, and\r\nBlake might be able to help them out of their predicament. To leave\r\nhim in the pool was therefore not to be thought of. So soon as he had\r\ndrained his bottle, he would lie down, and that would be the end of\r\nhim. As any attempt to move him forcibly was out of the question, the\r\nsituation demanded that Winthrope justify his intimations of diplomatic\r\ntraining. After considering the problem for several minutes, he met\r\nit in a way that proved he was at least not lacking in shrewdness and\r\ntact.\r\n\r\n\"See here, Blake,\" he called, in another lull between the shrieking\r\ngusts, \"the lady is fatigued. You're too much of a gentleman to ask\r\nher to come over there.\"\r\n\r\nIt required some moments for this to penetrate Blake's fuddled brain.\r\nAfter a futile attempt to gain his feet, he crawled out of the pool on\r\nall fours, and, with tears in his eyes, pressed his flask upon Miss\r\nLeslie. She shrank away from him, shuddering, and drew herself up in\r\na huddle of flaccid limbs and limp garments. Winthrope, however, not\r\nonly accepted the flask, but came near to draining it.\r\n\r\nBlake squinted at the diminished contents, hesitated, and cast a glance\r\nof maudlin gallantry at Miss Leslie. She lay coiled, closer than before,\r\nin a draggled heap. Her posture suggested sleep. Blake stared at her,\r\nthe flask extended waveringly before him. Then he brought it to his lips,\r\nand drained out the last drop.\r\n\r\n\"Time turn in,\" he mumbled, and sprawled full length in the brackish\r\nooze. Immediately he fell into a drunken stupor.\r\n\r\nWinthrope, invigorated by the liquor, rose to his knees, and peered\r\naround. It was impossible to face the scud and spoondrift from the\r\nfurious sea; but to leeward he caught a glimpse of a marsh flooded with\r\nsalt water, its reedy vegetation beaten flat by the storm. He himself was\r\nbeaten down by a terrific gust. Panting and trembling, he waited for\r\nthe wind to lull, in hope that he might obtain a clearer view of his\r\nsurroundings. Before he again dared rise to his feet, darkness swept\r\ndown with tropical suddenness and blurred out everything.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the whiskey soon passed, and Winthrope huddled between his\r\ncompanions, drenched and exhausted. Though he could hear Miss Leslie\r\nmoaning, he was too miserable himself to inquire whether he could do\r\nanything for her.\r\n\r\nPresently he became aware that the wind was falling. The centre of the\r\ncyclone had passed before the ship struck, and they were now in the\r\noutermost circle of the vast whirlwind. With the consciousness of this\r\nchange for the better, Winthrope's fear-racked nerves relaxed, and he\r\nfell into a heavy sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWORSE THAN WILDERNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nA wail from Miss Leslie roused the Englishman out of a dream in which he\r\nhad been swimming for life across a sea of boiling oil. He sat up and\r\ngazed about him, half dazed. The cyclone had been followed by a dead\r\ncalm, and the sun, already well above the horizon, was blazing upon them\r\nover the glassy surfaces of the dying swells with fierce heat.\r\n\r\nWinthrope felt about for his hat. It had been blown off when, at the\r\nstriking of the steamer, he had rushed up on deck. As he remembered,\r\nhe straightened, and looked at his companions. Blake lay snoring where\r\nhe had first outstretched himself, sleeping the sleep of the just--and\r\nof the drunkard. The girl, however, was already awake. She sat with her\r\nhands clasped in her lap, while the tears rolled slowly down her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"My--ah--dear Miss Genevieve, what is the matter?\" exclaimed Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Matter? Do you ask, when we are here on this wretched coast, and may\r\nnot get away for weeks? Oh, I did so count on the London season this\r\nyear! Lady Bayrose promised that I should be among those presented.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I--ah--fancy, Lady Bayrose will do no more presenting--unless it\r\nmay be to the heavenly choir, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what do you mean, Mr. Winthrope? You told me that she and the\r\nmaids had been put in the largest boat--\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Miss Genevieve, you must remember that I am a diplomat. It was\r\nall quite sufficiently harrowing, I assure you. They were, indeed, put\r\ninto the largest boat--Beastly muddle!--While they waited for the mate to\r\nfetch you, the boat was crushed alongside, and all in it drowned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drowned!--drowned! Oh, dear Lady Bayrose! And she'd travelled so\r\nmuch--oh, oh, it is horrible! Why did she persuade me to visit the Cape?\r\nIt was only to be with her--And then for us to start off for India, when\r\nwe might have sailed straight to England! Oh, it is horrible! horrible!\r\nAnd my maid, and all--It cannot be possible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, do not excite yourself, my dear Miss Genevieve. Their troubles\r\nare all over. Er--Gawd has taken them to Him, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the pity of it! To be drowned--so far from home!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, if that's all you're worrying about!--I must say I'd like to\r\nknow how we'll get a snack for breakfast. I'm hungry as a--er--groom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eating! How can you think of eating, Mr. Winthrope--and all the others\r\ndrowned? This sun is becoming dreadfully hot. It is unbearable! Can you\r\nnot put up some kind of an awning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, I must say, I was never much of a hand at such things, and\r\nreally I can't imagine what one could rig up. There might have been a\r\nbit of sail in the boat, but one can't see a sign of it. I fancy it was\r\nsmashed.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie ventured a glance at Blake. Though still lying as he had\r\nsprawled in his drunkenness, there was a comforting suggestion of power\r\nin his broad shoulders and square jaw.\r\n\r\n\"Is he still--in that condition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Must have slept it off by this time, and there's no more in the\r\nflask,\" answered Winthrope. Reaching over with his foot, he pushed\r\nagainst Blake's back.\r\n\r\n\"Huh! All right,\" grunted the sleeper, and sat up, as had Winthrope,\r\nhalf dazed. Then he stared around him, and rose to his feet. \"Well, what\r\nin hell! Say, this is damn cheerful!\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy we are in a nasty fix. But I say, my man, there is a woman\r\npresent, and your language, you know--\"\r\n\r\nBlake turned and fixed the Englishman with a cold stare.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, you bloomin' lud,\" he said, \"there's just one thing\r\nyou're going to understand, right here and now. I'm not your man,\r\nand we're not going to have any of that kind of blatter. Any fool\r\ncan see we're in a tight hole, and we're like to keep company for a\r\nwhile--probably long as we last.\"\r\n\r\n\"What--ah--may I ask, do you mean by that?\"\r\n\r\nBlake laughed harshly, and pointed from the reef-strewn sea to the vast\r\nstretches of desolate marsh. Far inland, across miles of brackish lagoons\r\nand reedy mud-flats, could be seen groups of scrubby, half-leafless\r\ntrees; ten or twelve miles to the southward a rocky headland jutted out\r\ninto the water; otherwise there was nothing in sight but sea and swamp.\r\nIf it could not properly be termed a sea-view, it was at least a very\r\nwet landscape.\r\n\r\n\"Fine prospect,\" remarked Blake, dryly. \"We'll be in luck if the\r\nfever don't get the last of us inside a month; and as for you two,\r\nyou'd have as much show of lasting a month as a toad with a rattlesnake,\r\nif it wasn't for Tom Blake,--that's my name--Tom Blake,--and as\r\nlong as this shindy lasts, you're welcome to call me Tom or Blake,\r\nwhichever suits. But understand, we're not going to have any more\r\nof your bloody, bloomin' English condescension. Aboard ship you had\r\nthe drop on me, and could pile on dog till the cows came home. Here\r\nI'm Blake, and you're Winthrope.\"\r\n\r\n\"Believe me, Mr. Blake, I quite appreciate the--ah--situation. And now,\r\nI fancy that, instead of wasting time--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's about time you introduced me to the lady,\" interrupted Blake,\r\nand he stared at them half defiantly, yet with a twinkle in his eyes.\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie flushed. Winthrope swore softly, and bit his lip. Aboard\r\nship, backed by Lady Bayrose and the captain, he had goaded the American\r\nat pleasure. Now, however, the situation was reversed. Both title and\r\nauthority had been swept away by the storm, and he was left to shift\r\nfor himself against the man who had every reason to hate him for his\r\noverbearing insolence. Worse still, both he and Miss Leslie were now\r\ndependent upon the American, in all probability for life itself. It was a\r\nbitter pill and hard to swallow.\r\n\r\nBlake was not slow to observe the Englishman's hesitancy. He grinned.\r\n\r\n\"Every dog has his day, and I guess this is mine,\" he said. \"Take\r\nyour time, if it comes hard. I can imagine it's a pretty stiff dose\r\nfor your ludship. But why in--why in frozen hades an American lady should\r\nobject to an introduction to a countryman who's going to do his level\r\nbest to save her pretty little self from the hyenas--well, it beats me.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope flushed redder than the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Leslie, Mr. Blake,\" he murmured, hoping to put an end to the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nBut yet Blake persisted. He bowed, openly exultant.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Miss,\" he said, \"I know the correct thing quite as much as\r\nyour swells. I knew all along you were Jenny Leslie. I ran a survey for\r\nyour dear papa when he was manipulating the Q. T. Railroad, and he did\r\nme out of my pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but Mr. Blake, I am sure it must be a mistake; I am sure that if\r\nit is explained to papa--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; we'll cable papa to-night. Meantime, we've something else to\r\ndo. Suppose you two get a hustle on yourselves, and scrape up something\r\nto eat. I'm going out to see what's left of that blamed old tub.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you'll not venture to swim out so far!\" protested Winthrope.\r\n\"I saw the steamer sink as we cast off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Looks like a mast sticking up out there. Maybe some of the rigging is\r\nloose.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the sharks! These waters swarm with the vile creatures. You must\r\nnot risk your life!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cause why? If I do, the babes in the woods will be left without even\r\nthe robins to cover them, poor things! But cheer up!--maybe the mud-hens\r\nwill do it with lovely water-lilies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, Mr. Blake, do not be so cruel!\" sobbed Miss Leslie, her tears\r\nstarting afresh. \"The sun makes my head ache dreadfully, and I have no\r\nhat or shade, and I'm becoming so thirsty!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think you've only to wait, and half a dozen stewards will\r\ncome running with parasols and ice water. Neither you nor Winthrope seem\r\nto 've got your eyes open. Just suppose you get busy and do something.\r\nWinthrope, chase yourself over the mud, and get together a mess of fish\r\nthat are not too dead. Must be dozens, after the blow. As for you, Miss\r\nJenny, I guess you can pick up some reeds, and rig a headgear out of this\r\nhandkerchief-- Wait a moment. Put on my coat, if you don't want to be\r\nbroiled alive through the holes of that peek-a-boo.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I say, Blake--\" began Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Don't say--do!\" rejoined Blake; and he started down the muddy shore.\r\n\r\nThough the tide was at flood, there was now no cyclone to drive the\r\nsea above the beach, and Blake walked a quarter of a mile before he\r\nreached the water's edge. There was little surf, and he paused only a\r\nfew moments to peer out across the low swells before he commenced to\r\nstrip.\r\n\r\nWinthrope and Miss Leslie had been watching his movements; now the girl\r\nrose in a little flurry of haste, and set to gathering reeds. Winthrope\r\nwould have spoken, but, seeing her embarrassment, smiled to himself, and\r\nbegan strolling about in search of fish.\r\n\r\nIt was no difficult search. The marshy ground was strewn with dead\r\nsea-creatures, many of which were already shrivelling and drying in\r\nthe sun. Some of the fish had a familiar look, and Winthrope turned them\r\nover with the tip of his shoe. He even went so far as to stoop to pick\r\nup a large mullet; but shrank back, repulsed by its stiffness and the\r\nunnatural shape into which the sun was warping it.\r\n\r\nHe found himself near the beach, and stood for half an hour or more\r\nwatching the black dot far out in the water,--all that was to be seen\r\nof Blake. The American, after wading off-shore another quarter of a\r\nmile, had reached swimming depth, and was heading out among the reefs\r\nwith steady, vigorous strokes. Half a mile or so beyond him Winthrope\r\ncould now make out the goal for which he was aiming,--the one remaining\r\ntopmast of the steamer.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, these waters are full of sharks!\" murmured Winthrope, staring\r\nat the steadily receding dot until it disappeared behind the wall of surf\r\nwhich spumed up over one of the outer reefs.\r\n\r\nA call from Miss Leslie interrupted his watch, and he hastened to\r\nrejoin her. After several failures, she had contrived to knot Blake's\r\nhandkerchief to three or four reeds in the form of a little sunshade. Her\r\nshoulders were protected by Blake's coat. It made a heavy wrap, but\r\nit shut out the blistering sun-rays, which, as Blake had foreseen, had\r\nquickly begun to burn the girl's delicate skin through her open-work\r\nbodice.\r\n\r\nThus protected, she was fairly safe from the sun. But the sun was by no\r\nmeans the worst feature of the situation. While Winthrope was yet several\r\nyards distant, the girl began to complain to him. \"I'm so thirsty,\r\nMr. Winthrope! Where is there any water? Please get me a drink at once,\r\nMr. Winthrope!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear Miss Leslie, there is no water. These pools are all\r\nsea-water. I must say, I'm deuced dry myself. I can't see why that\r\ncad should go off and leave us like this, when we need him most.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, it is a shame--Oh, I'm so thirsty! Do you think it would help\r\nif we ate something?\"\r\n\r\n\"Make it all the worse. Besides, how could we cook anything? All these\r\nreeds are green, or at least water-soaked.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Mr, Blake said to gather some fish. Had you not best--\"\r\n\r\n\"He can pick up all he wants. I shall not touch the beastly things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I suppose there is nothing to do but wait for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if the sharks do not get him.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie uttered a little moan, and Winthrope, seeing that she was\r\non the verge of tears, hastened to reassure her. \"Don't worry about\r\nhim, Miss Genevieve! He'll soon return, with nothing worse than a\r\nblistered back. Fellows of that sort are born to hang, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if he should be--if anything should happen to him!\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope shrugged his shoulders, and drew out his silver cigarette\r\ncase. It was more than half full, and he was highly gratified to find\r\nthat neither the cigarettes nor the vesta matches in the cover had been\r\nreached by the wet.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, here's luck!\" he exclaimed, and he bowed to Miss Leslie.\r\n\"Pardon me, but if you have no objections--\"\r\n\r\nThe girl nodded as a matter of form, and Winthrope hastened to light the\r\ncigarette already in his fingers. The smoke by no means tended to lessen\r\nthe dryness of his mouth; yet it put him in a reflective mood, and in\r\nthinking over what he had read of shipwrecked parties, he remembered that\r\na pebble held in the mouth is supposed to ease one's thirst.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, there was not a sign of a pebble within miles of where they\r\nsat; but after some reflection, it occurred to him that one of his steel\r\nkeys might do as well. At first Miss Leslie was reluctant to try the\r\nexperiment, and only the increasing dryness of her mouth forced her to\r\nseek the promised relief. Though it failed to quench her thirst, she\r\nwas agreeably surprised to find that the little flat bar of metal eased\r\nher craving to a marked degree.\r\n\r\nWinthrope now thought to rig a shade as Miss Leslie had done, out of\r\nreeds and his handkerchief, for the sun was scorching his unprotected\r\nhead. Thus sheltered, the two crouched as comfortably as they could\r\nupon the half-dried crest of the hummock, and waited impatiently for\r\nthe return of Blake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE WORTH OF FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nThough the sea within the reefs was fast smoothing to a glassy plain\r\nin the dead calm, they did not see Blake on his return until he struck\r\nshallow water and stood up to wade ashore. The tide had begun to ebb\r\nbefore he started landward, and though he was a powerful swimmer, the\r\nlong pull against the current had so tired him that when he took to\r\nwading he moved at a tortoise-like gait.\r\n\r\n\"The bloomin' loafer!\" commented Winthrope. He glanced quickly about,\r\nand at sight of Miss Leslie's arching brows, hastened to add: \"Beg\r\npardon! He--ah--reminds me so much of a navvy, you know.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie made no reply.\r\n\r\nAt last Blake was out of the water and toiling up the muddy beach to\r\nthe spot where he had left his clothes. While dressing he seemed to\r\nrecover from his exertions in the water, for the moment he had finished,\r\nhe sprang to his feet and came forward at a brisk pace.\r\n\r\nAs he approached, Winthrope waved his fifth cigarette at him with languid\r\nenthusiasm, and called out as heartily as his dry lips would permit:\r\n\"I say, Blake, deuced glad the sharks didn't get you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sharks?--bah! All you have to do is to splash a little, and they haul\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the steamer, Mr. Blake?\" asked Miss Leslie, turning to face\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"All under but the maintopmast--curse it!--wire rigging at that!\r\nCouldn't even get a bolt.\"\r\n\r\n\"A bolt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bolt; and here we are as good as naked on this infernal-- Hey,\r\nyou! what you doing with that match? Light your cigarette--light it!--\r\nDamnation!\"\r\n\r\nHeedless of Blake's warning cry, Winthrope had struck his last vesta,\r\nand now, angry and bewildered, he stood staring while the little taper\r\nburned itself out. With an oath, Blake sprang to catch it as it dropped\r\nfrom between Winthrope's fingers. But he was too far away. It fell among\r\nthe damp rushes, spluttered, and flared out.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Blake knelt, staring at the rushes as though stupefied; then\r\nhe sprang up before Winthrope, his bronzed face purple with anger.\r\n\r\n\"Where's your matchbox? Got any more?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Last one, I fancy--yes; last one, and there are still two cigarettes.\r\nBut look here, Blake, I can't tolerate your talking so deucedly--\"\r\n\r\n\"You idiot! you--you-- Hell! and every one for cigarettes!\"\r\n\r\nFrom a growl Blake's voice burst into a roar of fury, and he sprang upon\r\nWinthrope like a wild beast. His hands closed upon the Englishman's\r\nthroat, and he began to shake him about, paying no heed to the blows\r\nhis victim showered upon his face and body, blows which soon began to\r\nlessen in force.\r\n\r\nTerror-stricken, Miss Leslie put her hands over her eyes, and began\r\nto scream--the piercing shriek that will unnerve the strongest man.\r\nBlake paused as though transfixed, and as the half-suffocated Englishman\r\nstruggled in his grasp, he flung him on the ground, and turned to the\r\nscreaming girl.\r\n\r\n\"Stop that squawking!\" he said. The girl cowed down. \"So; that's\r\nbetter. Next time keep your mouth shut.\"\r\n\r\n\"You--you brute!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! You've got a little spunk, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"You coward--to attack a man not half your strength!\"\r\n\r\n\"Steady, steady, young lady! I'm warm enough yet; I've still half a\r\nmind to wring his fool neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should you be so angry! What has he done, that you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--why? Lord! what hasn't he done! This coast fairly swarms\r\nwith beasts. We've not the smell of a gun; and now this idiot--this\r\ndough-head--has gone and thrown away our only chance--fire--and on his\r\nmeasly cigarettes!\" Blake choked with returning rage.\r\n\r\nWinthrope, still panting for breath, began to creep away, at the\r\nsame time unclasping a small penknife. He was white with fear; but\r\nhis gray eyes--which on shipboard Blake had never seen other than\r\noffensively supercilious--now glinted in a manner that served to alter\r\nthe American's mood.\r\n\r\n\"That'll do,\" he said. \"Come here and show me that knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll show it you where it will do the most good,\" muttered Winthrope,\r\nrising hastily to repel the expected attack.\r\n\r\n\"So you've got a little sand, too,\" said Blake, almost good-naturedly.\r\n\"Say, that's not so bad. We'll call it quits on the matches. Though\r\nhow you could go and throw them away--\"\r\n\r\n\"Deuce take it, man! How should I know? I've never before been in a\r\nwreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither have I--this kind. But I tell you, we've got to keep our think\r\ntanks going. It's a guess if we see to-morrow, and that's no joke. Now\r\ndo you wonder I got hot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, no! I've been an ass, and here's my hand to it--if you really\r\nmean it's quits.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's quits all right, long as you don't run out of sand,\" responded\r\nBlake, and he gripped the other's soft hand until the Englishman winced.\r\n\"So; that's settled. I've got a hot temper, but I don't hold grudges.\r\nNow, where're your fish?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--well, they were all spoiled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoiled?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sun had shrivelled them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you call that spoiled! We're like to eat them rotten before we're\r\nthrough with this picnic. How about the pools?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pools? Do you know, Blake, I never thought of the pools. I stopped to\r\nwatch you, and then we were so anxious about you--\"\r\n\r\nBlake grunted, and turned on his heel to wade into the half-drained pool\r\nin whose midst he had been deposited by the hurricane.\r\n\r\nTwo or three small fish lay faintly wriggling on the surface. As Blake\r\nsplashed through the water to seize them, his foot struck against a\r\nliving body which floundered violently and flashed a brilliant forked\r\ntail above the muddy water. Blake sprang over the fish, which was\r\nentangled in the reeds, and with a kick, flung it clear out upon the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"A coryphene!\" cried Winthrope, and he ran forward to stare at the\r\ngorgeously colored prize.\r\n\r\n\"Coryphene?\" repeated Blake, following his example. \"Good to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine as salmon. This is only a small one, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Fifteen pounds, if an ounce!\" cried Blake, and he thrust his hand in\r\nhis pocket. There was a moment's silence, and Winthrope, glancing up,\r\nsaw the other staring in blank dismay.\r\n\r\n\"What's up!\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Lost my knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?--in the pool? If we felt about--\"\r\n\r\n\"No; aboard ship, or in the surf--\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is my knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; almost big enough to whittle a match! Mine would have done us some\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the best steel.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; let's see you cut up the fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know, Blake, I shouldn't know how to go about it. I never did\r\nsuch a thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Miss Jenny? Girls are supposed to know about cooking.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never cooked anything in all my life, Mr. Blake, and it's\r\nalive,--and--and I am very thirsty, Mr. Blake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord!\" commented Blake. \"Give me that knife.\"\r\n\r\nThough the blade was so small, the American's hand was strong. After\r\nsome little haggling, the coryphene was killed and dressed. Blake washed\r\nboth it and his hands in the pool, and began to cut slices of flesh from\r\nthe fish's tail.\r\n\r\n\"We have no fire,\" Winthrope reminded him, flushing at the word.\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" assented Blake, in a cheerful tone, and he offered\r\nWinthrope two of the pieces of raw flesh. \"Here's your breakfast. The\r\ntrimmed piece is for Miss Leslie.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's raw! Really, I could not think of eating raw fish. Could you,\r\nMiss Leslie?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie shuddered. \"Oh, no!--and I'm so thirsty I could not eat\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet you can!\" replied Blake. \"Both of you take that fish, and go\r\nto chewing. It's the stuff to ease your thirst while we look for water.\r\nGood Lord!--in a week you'll be glad to eat raw snake. Finnicky over\r\nclean fish, when you swallow canvas-back all but raw, and beef running\r\nblood, and raw oysters with their stomachs full of disintegrated animal\r\nmatter, to put it politely! You couldn't tell rattlesnake broth from\r\nchicken, and dog makes first-rate veal--when you've got to eat it. I've\r\nhad it straight from them that know, that over in France they eat snails\r\nand fish-worms. It's all a matter of custom or the style.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, the Japanese eat raw fish,\" admitted Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and you'd swallow your share of it if you had an invite to a\r\nswell dinner in Tokio. Go on now, both of you. It's no joke, I tell\r\nyou. You've got to eat, if you expect to get to water before night.\r\nUnderstand? See that headland south? Well, it's a hundred to one\r\nwe'll not find water short of there, and if we make it by night, we'll\r\nbe doing better than I figure from the look of these bogs. Now go to\r\nchewing. That's it! That's fine, Miss Jenny!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie had forced herself to take a nibble of the raw fish. The\r\nflavor proved less repulsive than she had expected, and its moisture was\r\nso grateful to her parched mouth that she began to eat with eagerness.\r\nNot to be outdone, Winthrope promptly followed her lead. Blake had\r\nalready cut himself a second slice. After he had cut more for his\r\ncompanions, he began to look them over with a closeness that proved\r\nembarrassing to Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Here's more of the good stuff,\" he said. \"While you're chewing\r\nit, we'll sort of take stock. Everybody shell out everything. Here's\r\nmy outfit--three shillings, half a dozen poker chips, and not another\r\nblessed-- Say, what's become of that whiskey flask? Have you seen my\r\nflask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here it is, right beside me, Mr. Blake,\" answered Miss Leslie. \"But\r\nit is empty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might be worse! What you got?--hair-pins, watch? No pocket, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"None; and no watch. Even most of my pins are gone,\" replied the girl,\r\nand she raised her hand to her loosely coiled hair.\r\n\r\n\"Well, hold on to what you've got left. They may come in for\r\nfish-hooks. Let's see your shoes.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie slowly thrust a slender little foot just beyond the hem of\r\nher draggled white skirt.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord!\" groaned Blake, \"slippers, and high heels at that! How\r\ndo you expect to walk in those things?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can at least try,\" replied the girl, with spirit.\r\n\r\n\"Hobble! Pass 'em over here, Winnie, my boy.\"\r\n\r\nThe slippers were handed over. Blake took one after the other, and\r\nwrenched off the heel close to its base.\r\n\r\n\"Now you've at least got a pair of slippers,\" he said, tossing them\r\nback to their owner. \"Tie them on tight with a couple of your ribbons,\r\nif you don't want to lose them in the mud. Now, Winthrope, what you got\r\nbeside the knife?\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope held out a bunch of long flat keys and his cigarette case.\r\nHe opened the latter, and was about to throw away the two remaining\r\ncigarettes when Blake grasped his wrist.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on! even they may come in for something. We'll at least keep them\r\nuntil we need the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the keys!\"\r\n\r\n\"Make arrow-heads, if we can get fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard of savages making fire by rubbing wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and we're a long way from being savages,--at present. All the\r\nshow we have is to find some kind of quartz or flint, and the sooner we\r\nstart to look the better. Got your slippers tied, Miss Jenny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I think they'll do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Think! It's knowing's the thing. Here, let me look.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl shrank back; but Blake stooped and examined first one slipper\r\nand then the other. The ribbons about both were tied in dainty bows.\r\nBlake jerked them loose and twisted them firmly over and under the\r\nslippers and about the girl's slender ankles before knotting the ends.\r\n\r\n\"There; that's more like. You're not going to a dance,\" he growled.\r\n\r\nHe thrust the empty whiskey flask into his hip pocket, and went back to\r\npass a sling of reeds through the gills of the coryphene.\r\n\r\n\"All ready now,\" he called. \"Let's get a move on. Keep my coat closer\r\nabout your shoulders, Miss Jenny, and keep your shade up, if you don't\r\nwant a sunstroke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Blake, I'll see to that,\" said Winthrope. \"I'm going to\r\nhelp Miss Leslie along. I've fastened our two shades together, so that\r\nthey will answer for both of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about yourself, Mr. Blake?\" inquired the girl. \"Do you not find\r\nthe sun fearfully hot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure; but I wet my head in the sea, and here's another souse.\"\r\n\r\nAs he rose with dripping head from beside the pool, he slung the\r\ncoryphene on his back, and started off without further words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA JOURNEY IN DESOLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning was well advanced, and the sun beat down upon the three with\r\nalmost overpowering fierceness. The heat would have rendered their thirst\r\nunendurable had not Blake hacked off for them bit after bit of the moist\r\ncoryphene flesh.\r\n\r\nIn a temperate climate, ten miles over firm ground is a pleasant walk\r\nfor one accustomed to the exercise. Quite a different matter is ten\r\nmiles across mud-flats, covered with a tangle of reeds and rushes,\r\nand frequently dipping into salt marsh and ooze. Before they had gone\r\na mile Miss Leslie would have lost her slippers had it not been for\r\nBlake's forethought in tying them so securely. Within a little more\r\nthan three miles the girl's strength began to fail.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Blake,\" called Winthrope, for the American was some yards in\r\nthe lead, \"pull up a bit on that knoll. We'll have to rest a while, I\r\nfancy. Miss Leslie is about pegged.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" demanded Blake. \"We're not half-way yet!\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope did not reply. It was all he could do to drag the girl up on\r\nthe hummock. She sank, half-fainting, upon the dry reeds, and he sat down\r\nbeside her to protect her with the shade. Blake stared at the miles of\r\nswampy flats which yet lay between them and the out-jutting headland of\r\ngray rock. The base of the cliff was screened by a belt of trees; but\r\nthe nearest clump of green did not look more than a mile nearer than\r\nthe headland.\r\n\r\n\"Hell!\" muttered Blake, despondently. \"Not even a short four miles.\r\nMush and sassiety girls!\"\r\n\r\nThough he spoke to himself, the others heard him. Miss Leslie flushed,\r\nand would have risen had not Winthrope put his hand on her arm.\r\n\r\n\"Could you not go on, and bring back a flask of water for Miss Leslie?\"\r\nhe asked. \"By that time she will be rested.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I don't fetch back any flasks of water. She's going when I go,\r\nor you can come on to suit yourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blake, you--you won't go, and leave me here! If you have a\r\nsister--if your mother--\"\r\n\r\n\"She died of drink, and both my sisters did worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"My God, man! do you mean to say you'll abandon a helpless young girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit more helpless than were my sisters when you rich folks'\r\nguardians of law and order jugged me for the winter, 'cause I didn't\r\nhave a job, and turned both girls into the street--onto the street, if\r\nyou know what that means--one only sixteen and the other seventeen. Talk\r\nabout helpless young girls-- Damnation!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie cringed back as though she had been struck. Blake, however,\r\nseemed to have vented his anger in the curse, for when he again spoke,\r\nthere was nothing more than impatience in his tone. \"Come on, now; get\r\naboard. Winthrope couldn't lug you a half-mile, and long's it's the\r\nonly way, don't be all day about it. Here, Winthrope, look to the fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear fellow, I don't quite take your idea, nor does Miss\r\nLeslie, I fancy,\" ventured Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we've got to get to water, or die; and as the lady can't walk,\r\nshe's going on my back. It's a case of have-to.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! I am not--I am not! I'd sooner die!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you'll find that easy enough, later on, Miss Jenny. Stand\r\nby, Winthrope, to help her up. Do you hear? Take the knife and fish, and\r\nlend a hand.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a note in Blake's voice that neither Winthrope nor Miss\r\nLeslie dared disregard. Though scarlet with mortification, she permitted\r\nherself to be taken pick-a-back upon Blake's broad shoulders, and meekly\r\nobeyed his command to clasp her hands about his throat. Yet even at\r\nthat moment, such are the inconsistencies of human nature, she could\r\nnot but admire the ease with which he rose under her weight.\r\n\r\nNow that he no longer had the slow pace of the girl to consider, he\r\nadvanced at his natural gait, the quick, tireless stride of an American\r\nrailroad-surveyor. His feet, trained to swamp travel in Louisiana and\r\nPanama, seemed to find the firmest ground as by instinct, and whether\r\non the half-dried mud of the hummocks or in the ankle-deep water of the\r\nbogs, they felt their way without slip or stumble.\r\n\r\nWinthrope, though burdened only with the half-eaten coryphene, toiled\r\nalong behind, greatly troubled by the mud and the tangled reeds, and now\r\nand then flung down by some unlucky misstep. His modish suit, already\r\nmuch damaged by the salt water, was soon smeared afresh with a coating\r\nof greenish slime. His one consolation was that Blake, after jeering\r\nat his first tumble, paid no more attention to him. On the other hand,\r\nhe was cut by the seeming indifference of Miss Leslie. Intent on his\r\nown misery, he failed to consider that the girl might be suffering far\r\ngreater discomfort and humiliation.\r\n\r\nMore than three miles had been covered before Blake stopped on a hummock.\r\nReleasing Miss Leslie, he stretched out on the dry crest of the knoll,\r\nand called for a slice of the fish. At his urging, the others took a\r\nfew mouthfuls, although their throats were now so parched that even\r\nthe moist flesh afforded scant relief. Fortunately for them all, Blake\r\nhad been thoroughly trained to endure thirst. He rested less than ten\r\nminutes; then, taking Miss Leslie up again like a rag doll, he swung away\r\nat a good pace.\r\n\r\nThe trees were less than half a mile distant when he halted for the\r\nsecond time. He would have gone to them without a pause though his\r\nmuscles were quivering with exhaustion, had not Miss Leslie chanced to\r\nlook around and discover that Winthrope was no longer following them.\r\nFor the last mile he had been lagging farther and farther behind, and\r\nnow he had suddenly disappeared. At the girl's dismayed exclamation,\r\nBlake released his hold, and she found herself standing in a foot or\r\nmore of mud and water. The sweat was streaming down Blake's face. As he\r\nturned around, he wiped it off with his shirtsleeves.\r\n\r\n\"Do you--can it be, Mr. Blake, that he has had a sunstroke?\" asked Miss\r\nLeslie.\r\n\r\n\"Sunstroke? No; he's just laid down, that's all. I thought he had more\r\nsand--confound him!\"\r\n\r\n\"But the sun is so dreadfully hot, and I have his shade.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he's been tumbling into every other pool. No; it's not the sun.\r\nI've half a mind to let him lie--the paper-legged swell! It would no\r\nmore than square our aboard-ship accounts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, you would not do that, Mr. Blake! It may be that he has hurt\r\nhimself in falling.\"\r\n\r\n\"In this mud?--bah! But I guess I'm in for the pack-mule stunt all\r\naround. Now, now; don't yowl, Miss Jenny. I'm going. But you can't\r\nexpect me to love the snob.\"\r\n\r\nAs he splashed away on the return trail, Miss Leslie dabbed at her eyes\r\nto check the starting tears.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear--Oh, dear!\" she moaned; \"what have I done, to be so treated?\r\nSuch a brute, Oh, dear!--and I am so thirsty!\"\r\n\r\nIn her despair she would have sunk down where she stood had not the\r\nsliminess of the water repelled her. She gazed longingly at the trees,\r\nin the fore of which stood a grove of stately palms. The half-mile seemed\r\nan insuperable distance, but the ride on Blake's back had rested her,\r\nand thirst goaded her forward.\r\n\r\nStumbling and slipping, she waded on across the inundated ground, and\r\ncame out upon a half-baked mud-flat, where the walking was much easier.\r\nBut the sun was now almost directly overhead, and between her thirst and\r\nthe heat, she soon found herself faltering. She tottered on a few steps\r\nfarther, and then stopped, utterly spent As she sank upon the dried\r\nrushes, she glanced around, and was vaguely conscious of a strange,\r\ndouble-headed figure following her path across the marsh. All about\r\nher became black.\r\n\r\nThe next she knew, Blake was splashing her head and face with brackish\r\nwater out of the whiskey flask. She raised her hand to shield her face,\r\nand sat up, sick and dizzy.\r\n\r\n\"That's it!\" said Blake. He spoke in a kindly tone, though his voice\r\nwas harsh and broken with thirst. \"You're all right now. Pull yourself\r\ntogether, and we'll get to the trees in a jiffy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Winthrope--?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm here, Miss Genevieve. It was only a wrenched ankle. If I had a\r\nstick, Blake, I fancy I could make a go of it over this drier ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"And lay yourself up for a month. Come, Miss Jenny, brace up for\r\nanother try. It's only a quarter-mile, and I've got to pack him.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl was gasping with thirst; yet she made an effort, and assisted\r\nby Blake managed to gain her feet. She was still dizzy; but as Blake\r\nswung Winthrope upon his back, he told her to take hold of his arm.\r\nWinthrope held the shade over her head. Thus assisted, and sheltered from\r\nthe direct beat of the sun-rays, she tottered along beside Blake, half\r\nunconscious.\r\n\r\nFortunately the remaining distance lay across a stretch of bare dry\r\nground, for even Blake had all but reached the limit of endurance. Step\r\nby step he labored on, staggering under the weight of the Englishman,\r\nand gasping with a thirst which his exertions rendered even greater\r\nthan that of his companions. But through the trees and brush which\r\nstretched away inland in a wall of verdure he had caught glimpses of a\r\nbroad stream, and the hope of fresh water called out every ounce of his\r\nreserve strength.\r\n\r\nAt last the nearest palm was only a few paces distant. Blake clutched\r\nMiss Leslie's arm, and dragged her forward with a rush, in a final\r\noutburst of energy. A moment later all three lay gasping in the shade.\r\nBut the river was yet another hundred yards distant. Blake waited only\r\nto regain his breath; then he staggered up and went on. The others,\r\nunable to rise, gazed after him in silent misery.\r\n\r\nSoon Blake found himself rushing through the jungle along a broad trail\r\npitted with enormous footprints; but he was so near mad with thirst\r\nthat he paid no heed to the spoor other than to curse the holes for\r\nthe trouble they gave him. Suddenly the trail turned to the left and\r\nsloped down a low bank into the river. Blind to all else, Blake ran\r\ndown the slope, and dropping upon his knees, plunged his head into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAt first his throat was so dry that he could no more than rinse his\r\nmouth. With the first swallow, his swollen tongue mocked him with\r\nthe salt, bitter taste of sea-water. The tide was flowing! He rose,\r\nsputtering and choking and gasping. He stared around. There was no\r\nquestion that he was on the bank of a river and would be certain of\r\nfresh water with the ebb tide. But could he endure the agony of his\r\nthirst all those hours?\r\n\r\nHe thought of his companions.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" he groaned, \"they're goners anyway!\"\r\n\r\nHe stared dully up the river at the thousands of waterfowl which lined\r\nits banks. Within close view were herons and black ibises, geese,\r\npelicans, flamingoes, and a dozen other species of birds of which he\r\ndid not know the names. But he sat as though in a stupor, and did not\r\nmove even when one of the driftwood logs on a mud-shoal a few yards\r\nup-stream opened an enormous mouth and displayed two rows of hooked\r\nfangs. It was otherwise when the noontime stillness was broken by a\r\nviolent splashing and loud snortings down-stream. He glanced about,\r\nand saw six or eight monstrous heads drifting towards him with the tide.\r\n\r\n\"What in-- Whee! a whole herd of hippos!\" he muttered. \"That's what\r\nthe holes mean.\"\r\n\r\nThe foremost hippopotamus was headed directly for him. He glared at the\r\nhuge head with sullen resentment. For all his stupor, he perceived at\r\nonce that the beast intended to land; and he sat in the middle of its\r\naccustomed path. His first impulse was to spring up and yell at the\r\ncreature. Then he remembered hearing that a white hunter had recently\r\nbeen killed by these beasts on one of the South African lakes. Instead\r\nof leaping up, he sank down almost flat, and crawled back around the\r\nturn in the path. Once certain that he was hidden from the beasts, he\r\nrose to his feet and hastened back through the jungle.\r\n\r\nHe was almost in view of the spot where he had left Winthrope and Miss\r\nLeslie, when he stopped and stood hesitating.\r\n\r\n\"I can't do it,\" he muttered; \"I can't tell her,--poor girl!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and pushed into the thicket. Forcing a way through the tangle\r\nof thorny shrubs and creepers, until several yards from the path, he\r\nbegan to edge towards the face of the jungle, that he might peer out at\r\nhis companions, unseen by them.\r\n\r\nThere was more of the thicket before him than he had thought, and he was\r\nstill fighting his way through it, when he was brought to a stand by a\r\npeculiar cry that might have been the bleat of a young lamb: \"Ba--ba!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that!\" he croaked.\r\n\r\nHe stood listening, and in a moment he again heard the cry, this time\r\nmore distinctly: \"Blak!--Blak!\"\r\n\r\nThere could be no mistake. It was Winthrope calling for him, and calling\r\nwith a clearness of voice that would have been physically impossible half\r\nan hour since. Blake's sunken eyes lighted with hope. He burst through\r\nthe last screen of jungle, and stared towards the palm under which he\r\nhad left his companions. They were not there.\r\n\r\nAnother call from Winthrope directed his gaze more seaward. The two were\r\nseated beside a fallen palm, and Miss Leslie had a large round object\r\nraised to her lips. Winthrope was waving to him.\r\n\r\n\"Cocoanuts!\" he yelled. \"Come on!\"\r\n\r\nThree of the palms had been overthrown by the hurricane, and when Blake\r\ncame up, he found the ground strewn with nuts. He seized the first he\r\ncame to; but Winthrope held out one already opened. He snatched it\r\nfrom him, and placed the hole to his swollen lips. Never had champagne\r\ntasted half so delicious as that cocoanut milk. Before he could drain\r\nthe last of it through the little opening, Winthrope had the husks torn\r\nfrom the ends of two other nuts, and the convenient germinal spots\r\ngouged open with his penknife.\r\n\r\nBlake emptied the third before he spoke. Even then his voice was hoarse\r\nand strained. \"How'd you strike 'em?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't help it,\" explained Winthrope. \"Hardly had you\r\ndisappeared when I noticed the tops of the fallen palms, and thought of\r\nthe nuts. There was one in the grass not twenty feet from where we lay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky for you--and for me, too, I guess,\" said Blake. \"We were all\r\nthree down for the count. But this settles the first round in our favor.\r\nHow do you like the picnic, Miss Jenny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Leslie, if you please,\" replied the girl, with hauteur.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, say, Miss Jenny!\" protested Blake, genially. \"We live in the same\r\nboarding-house now. Why not be folksy? You're free to call me Tom. Pass\r\nme another nut, Winthrope. Thanks! By the way, what's your front name?\r\nSaw it aboard ship--Cyril--\"\r\n\r\n\"Cecil,\" corrected Winthrope, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n\"Cecil--Lord Cecil, eh?--or is it only The Honorable Cecil?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir, I have intimated before that, for reasons of--er--State--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; you're travelling incog., in the secret service. Sort of\r\ndetective--\"\r\n\r\n\"Detective!\" echoed Winthrope, in a peculiar tone.\r\n\r\nBlake grinned. \"Well, it is rawther a nawsty business for your honorable\r\nludship. But there's nothing like calling things by their right names.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right names--er--I don't quite take you. I have told you distinctly,\r\nmy name is Cecil Winthrope!\"\r\n\r\n\"O-h-h! how lovely!--See-sill! See-seal!--Bet they called you Sissy\r\nat school. English, chum of mine told me your schools are corkers for\r\nnicknames. What'll we make it--Sis or Sissy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer my patronymic, Mr. Blake,\" replied Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"All right, then; we'll make it Pat, if that's your choice. I say,\r\nPat, this juice is the stuff for wetness, but it makes a fellow remember\r\nhis grub. Where'd you leave that fish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, I can't just say, but it must have been where I wrenched my\r\nankle.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cawn't just say! And what are we going to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here are the cocoanuts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bright boy! go to the head of the class! Just take some more husk off\r\nthose empty ones.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope caught up one of the nuts, and with the aid of his knife,\r\nstripped it of its husk. At a gesture from Blake, he laid it on the\r\nbare ground, and the American burst it open with a blow of his heel.\r\nIt was an immature nut, and the meat proved to be little thicker than\r\nclotted cream. Blake divided it into three parts, handing Miss Leslie\r\nthe cleanest.\r\n\r\nThough his companions began with more restraint, they finished their\r\nshares with equal gusto. Winthrope needed no further orders to return to\r\nhis husking. One after another, the nuts were cracked and divided among\r\nthe three, until even Blake could not swallow another mouthful of the\r\nluscious cream.\r\n\r\nToward the end Miss Leslie had become drowsy. At Winthrope's urging,\r\nshe now lay down for a nap, Blake's coat serving as a pillow. She fell\r\nasleep while Winthrope was yet arranging it for her. Blake had turned\r\nhis back on her, and was staring moodily at the hippopotamus trail, when\r\nWinthrope hobbled around and sat down on the palm trunk beside him.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Blake,\" he suggested, \"I feel deuced fagged myself. Why not\r\nall take a nap?\"\r\n\r\n\"'And when they awoke, they were all dead men,'\" remarked Blake.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, that sounds like a joke,\" protested the Englishman. \"Don't\r\nrag me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Joke!\" repeated Blake. \"Why, that's Scripture, Pat, Scripture!\r\nAnyway, you'd think it no joke to wake up and find yourself going down\r\nthe throat of a hippo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hippo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dozens of them over in the river. Shouldn't wonder if they've all\r\nlanded, and 're tracking me down by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But hippopotami are not carnivorous--they're not at all dangerous,\r\nunless one wounds them, out in the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be; but I'm not taking chances. They've got mouths like\r\nsperm whales--I saw one take a yawn. Another thing, that bayou is chuck\r\nfull of alligators, and a fellow down on the Rand told me they're like\r\nthe Central American gavials for keenness to nip a swimmer.\"\r\n\r\n\"They will not come out on this dry land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they won't--there're no other animals in Africa but sheep,\r\neh?\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we do? The captain told me that there are both lions and\r\nleopards on this coast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nice place for them, too, around these trees,\" added Blake. \"Lucky\r\nfor us, they're night-birds mostly,--if that Rand fellow didn't lie.\r\nHe was a Boer, so I guess he ought to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure. It's a nasty fix we're in for to-night. Could we not\r\nbuild some kind of a barricade?\"\r\n\r\n\"With a penknife! Guess we'll roost in a tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"But cannot leopards climb? It seems to me that I have heard--\"\r\n\r\n\"How about lions?\"\r\n\r\n\"They cannot; I'm sure of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll chance the leopards. Just stretch out here, and nurse that\r\nankle of yours. I don't want to be lugging you all year. I'm going to\r\nhunt a likely tree.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE RE-ASCENT OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nAfternoon was far advanced, and Winthrope was beginning to feel anxious,\r\nwhen at last Blake pushed out from among the close thickets. As he\r\napproached, he swung an unshapely club of green wood, pausing every few\r\npaces to test its weight and balance on a bush or knob of dirt.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" called Winthrope; \"that's not half bad! You look as if\r\nyou could bowl over an ox.\"\r\n\r\nBlake showed that he was flattered.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" he responded; \"the thing's blamed unhandy. Just\r\nthe same, I guess we'll be ready for callers to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Show you later, Pat, me b'y. Now trot out some nuts. We'll feed\r\nbefore we move camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Leslie is still sleeping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Time, then, to roust her out. Hey, Miss Jenny, turn out! Time to chew.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie sat up and gazed around in bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, Miss Genevieve,\" reassured Winthrope. \"Blake has\r\nfound a safe place for the night, and he wishes us to eat before we leave\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Save lugging the grub,\" added Blake. \"Get busy, Pat.\"\r\n\r\nAs Winthrope caught up a nut, the girl began to arrange her disordered\r\nhair and dress with the deft and graceful movements of a woman thoroughly\r\ntrained in the art of self-adornment. There was admiration in Blake's\r\ndeep eyes as he watched her dainty preening. She was not a beautiful\r\ngirl--at present she could hardly be termed pretty; yet even in her\r\ndraggled, muddy dress she retained all the subtle charms of culture\r\nwhich appeal so strongly to a man. Blake was subdued. His feelings even\r\ncarried him so far as an attempt at formal politeness, when they had\r\nfinished their meal.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Miss Leslie,\" he began, \"it's little more than half an hour\r\nto sundown; so, if you please, if you're quite ready, we'd best be\r\nstarting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it far?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so very. But we've got to chase through the jungle. Are you sure\r\nyou're quite ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite, thank you. But how about Mr. Winthrope's ankle?\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll ride as far as the trees. I can't squeeze through with him,\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall walk all the way,\" put in Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't. Climb aboard,\" replied Blake, and catching up his\r\nclub, he stooped for Winthrope to mount his back. As he rose with his\r\nburden, Miss Leslie caught sight of his coat, which still lay in a roll\r\nbeside the palm trunk.\r\n\r\n\"How about your coat, Mr. Blake?\" she asked. \"Should you not put it\r\non?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I'm loaded now. Have to ask you to look after it. You may need\r\nit before morning, anyway. If the dews here are like those in Central\r\nAmerica, they are d-darned liable to bring on malarial fever.\"\r\n\r\nNothing more was said until they had crossed the open space between the\r\npalms and the belt of jungle along the river. At other times Winthrope\r\nand Miss Leslie might have been interested in the towering screw-palms,\r\nfestooned to the top with climbers, and in the huge ferns which they\r\ncould see beneath the mangroves, in the swampy ground on their left.\r\nNow, however, they were far too concerned with the question of how\r\nthey should penetrate the dense tangle of thorny brush and creepers\r\nwhich rose before them like a green wall. Even Blake hesitated as he\r\nreleased Winthrope, and looked at Miss Leslie's costume. Her white\r\nskirt was of stout duck; but the flimsy material of her waist was\r\nill-suited for rough usage.\r\n\r\n\"Better put the coat on, unless you want to come out on the other side\r\nin full evening dress,\" he said. \"There's no use kicking; but I wish\r\nyou'd happened to have on some sort of a jacket when we got spilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no path through the thicket?\" inquired Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Only the hippo trail, and it don't go our way. We've got to run our\r\nown line. Here's a stick for your game ankle.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope took the half-green branch which Blake broke from the nearest\r\ntree, and turned to assist Miss Leslie with the coat. The garment was\r\nof such coarse cloth that as Winthrope drew the collar close about her\r\nthroat Miss Leslie could not forego a little grimace of repugnance. The\r\ncrease between Blake's eyes deepened, and the girl hastened to utter\r\nan explanatory exclamation: \"Not so tight, Mr. Winthrope, please! It\r\nscratches my neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd find those thorns a whole lot worse,\" muttered Blake.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure; and Miss Leslie fully appreciates your kindness,\"\r\ninterposed Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"I do indeed, Mr. Blake! I'm sure I never could go through here without\r\nyour coat.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right. Got the handkerchief?\"\r\n\r\n\"I put it in one of the pockets.\"\r\n\r\n\"It'll do to tie up your hair.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie took the suggestion, knotting the big square of linen over\r\nher fluffy brown hair.\r\n\r\nBlake waited only for her to draw out the kerchief, before he began to\r\nforce a way through the jungle. Now and then he beat at the tangled\r\nvegetation with his club. Though he held to the line by which he had\r\nleft the thicket, yet all his efforts failed to open an easy passage\r\nfor the others. Many of the thorny branches sprang back into place behind\r\nhim, and as Miss Leslie, who was the first to follow, sought to thrust\r\nthem aside, the thorns pierced her delicate skin, until her hands were\r\ncovered with blood. Nor did Winthrope, stumbling and hobbling behind her,\r\nfare any better. Twice he tripped headlong into the brush, scratching\r\nhis arms and face.\r\n\r\nBlake took his own punishment as a matter of course, though his tougher\r\nand thicker skin made his injuries less painful. He advanced steadily\r\nalong the line of bent and broken twigs that marked his outward passage,\r\nuntil the thicket opened on a strip of grassy ground beneath a wild\r\nfig-tree.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" exclaimed Winthrope, \"a banyan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Banyan? Well, if that's British for a daisy, you've hit it,\"\r\nresponded Blake. \"Just take a squint up here. How's that for a roost?\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope and Miss Leslie stared up dubiously at the edge of a bed of\r\nreeds gathered in the hollow of one of the huge flattened branches at its\r\njunction with the main trunk of the banyan, twenty feet above them.\r\n\r\n\"Will not the mosquitoes pester us, here among the trees?\" objected\r\nWinthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Storm must have blown 'em away. I haven't seen any yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be millions after sunset.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe; but I bet they keep below our roost\"\r\n\r\n\"But how are we to get up so high?\" inquired Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"I can swarm this drop root, and I've a creeper ready for you two,\"\r\nexplained Blake.\r\n\r\nSuiting action to words, he climbed up the small trunk of the air root,\r\nand swung over into the hollow where he had piled the reeds. Across the\r\nbroad limb dangled a rope-like creeper, one end of which he had fastened\r\nto a branch higher up. He flung down the free end to Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Look lively, Pat,\" he called. \"The sun's most gone, and the twilight\r\ndon't last all night in these parts. Get the line around Miss Leslie,\r\nand do what you can on a boost.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see; but, you know, the vine is too stiff to tie.\"\r\n\r\nBlake stifled an oath, and jerked the end of the creeper up into his\r\nhand. When he threw it down again, it was looped around and fastened in\r\na bowline knot.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Miss Leslie, get aboard, and we'll have you up in a jiffy,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you can lift me?\" asked the girl, as Winthrope slipped\r\nthe loop over her shoulders.\r\n\r\nBlake laughed down at them. \"Well, I guess yes! Once hoisted a fellow\r\nout of a fifty-foot prospect hole--big fat Dutchman at that. You don't\r\nweigh over a hundred and twenty.\"\r\n\r\nHe had stretched out across the broadest part of the branch. As Miss\r\nLeslie seated herself in the loop, he reached down and began to haul up\r\non the creeper, hand over hand. Though frightened by the novel manner\r\nof ascent, the girl clung tightly to the line above her head, and Blake\r\nhad no difficulty in raising her until she swung directly beneath him.\r\nHere, however, he found himself in a quandary. The girl seemed as\r\nhelpless as a child, and he was lying flat. How could he lift her above\r\nthe level of the branch?\r\n\r\n\"Take hold the other line,\" he said. The girl hesitated. \"Do you hear?\r\nGrab it quick, and pull up hard, if you don't want a tumble!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl seized the part of the creeper which was fastened above, and\r\ndrew herself up with convulsive energy. Instantly Blake rose to his\r\nknees, and grasping the taut creeper with one hand, reached down with\r\nthe other, to swing the girl up beside him on the branch.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Miss Jenny,\" he reassured her as he felt her tremble.\r\n\"Sorry to scare you, but I couldn't have made it without. Now, if\r\nyou'll just hold down my legs, we'll soon hoist his ludship.\"\r\n\r\nHe had seated her in the broadest part of the shallow hollow, where the\r\nbranch joined the main trunk of the fig. Heaped with the reeds which\r\nhe had gathered during the afternoon, it made such a cozy shelter that\r\nshe at once forgot her dizziness and fright. Nestling among the reeds,\r\nshe leaned over and pressed down on his ankles with all her strength.\r\n\r\nThe loose end of the creeper had fallen to the ground when Blake lifted\r\nher upon the branch, and Winthrope was already slipping into the loop.\r\nBlake ordered him to take it off, and send up the club. As the creeper\r\nwas again flung down, a black shadow swept over the jungle.\r\n\r\n\"Hello! Sunset!\" called Blake. \"Look sharp, there!\"\r\n\r\n\"All ready,\" responded Winthrope.\r\n\r\nBlake drew in a full breath, and began to hoist. The position was an\r\nawkward one, and Winthrope weighed thirty or forty pounds more than Miss\r\nLeslie. But as the Englishman came within reach of the descending loop,\r\nhe grasped it and did what he could to ease Blake's efforts. A few\r\nmoments found him as high above the ground as Blake could raise him.\r\nWithout waiting for orders, he swung himself upon the upper part of\r\nthe creeper, and climbed the last few feet unaided. Blake grunted with\r\nsatisfaction as he pulled him in upon the branch.\r\n\r\n\"You may do, after all,\" he said. \"At any rate, we're all aboard for\r\nthe night; and none too soon. Hear that!\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lion, I guess--Not that yelping. Listen!\"\r\n\r\nThe brief twilight was already fading into the darkness of a moonless\r\nnight, and as the three crouched together in their shallow nest, they\r\nwere soon made audibly aware of the savage nature of their surroundings.\r\nWith the gathering night the jungle wakened into full life. From all\r\nsides came the harsh squawking of birds, the weird cries of monkeys and\r\nother small creatures, the crash of heavy animals moving through the\r\njungle, and above all the yelp and howl and roar of beasts of prey.\r\n\r\nAfter some contention with Winthrope, Blake conceded that the roars\r\nof his lion might be nothing worse than the snorting of the hippopotami\r\nas they came out to browse for the night. In this, however, there was\r\nsmall comfort, since Winthrope presently reasserted his belief in the\r\nclimbing ability of leopards, and expressed his opinion that, whether\r\nor not there were lions in the neighborhood, certain of the barking\r\nroars they could hear came from the throats of the spotted climbers. Even\r\nBlake's hair bristled as his imagination pictured one of the great\r\ncats creeping upon them in the darkness from the far end of their nest\r\nlimb, or leaping down out of the upper branches.\r\n\r\nThe nerves of all three were at their highest tension when a dark form\r\nswept past through the air within a yard of their faces. Miss Leslie\r\nuttered a stifled scream, and Blake brandished his club. But Winthrope,\r\nwho had caught a glimpse of the creature's shape, broke into a nervous\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"It's only a fruit bat,\" he explained. \"They feed on the banyan figs,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\nIn the reaction from this false alarm, both men relaxed, and began\r\nto yield to the effects of the tramp across the mud-flats. Arranging\r\nthe reeds as best they could, they stretched out on either side of\r\nMiss Leslie, and fell asleep in the middle of an argument on how the\r\nprospective leopard was most likely to attack.\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie remained awake for two or three hours longer. Naturally\r\nshe was more nervous than her companions, and she had been refreshed by\r\nher afternoon's nap. Her nervousness was not entirely due to the wild\r\nbeasts. Though Blake had taken pains to secure himself and his companions\r\nin loops of the creeper, fastened to the branch above, Winthrope moved\r\nabout so restlessly in his sleep that the girl feared he would roll from\r\nthe hollow.\r\n\r\nAt last her limbs became so cramped that she was compelled to change\r\nher position. She leaned back upon her elbow, determined to rise again\r\nand maintain her watch the moment she was rested. But sleep was close\r\nupon her. There was a lull in the louder noises of the jungle. Her eyes\r\nclosed, and her head sank lower. In a little time it was lying upon\r\nWinthrope's shoulder, and she was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nAs Blake had asserted, the mosquitoes had either been blown away by\r\nthe cyclone, or did not fly to such a height. None came to trouble the\r\nexhausted sleepers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMAN AND GENTLEMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nNight had almost passed, and all three, soothed by the refreshing\r\ncoolness which preceded the dawn, were sleeping their soundest, when\r\na sudden fierce roar followed instantly by a piercing squeal caused\r\neven Blake to start up in panic. Miss Leslie, too terrified to scream,\r\nclung to Winthrope, who crouched on his haunches, little less overcome.\r\n\r\nBlake was the first to recover and puzzle out the meaning of the crashing\r\nin the jungle and the ferocious growls directly beneath them.\r\n\r\n\"Lie still,\" he whispered. \"We're all right. It's only a beast\r\nthat's killed something down below us.\"\r\n\r\nAll sat listening, and as the noise of the animals in the thicket died\r\naway, they could hear the beast beneath them tear at the body of its\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\n\"The air feels like dawn,\" whispered Winthrope. \"We'll soon be able\r\nto see the brute.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he us,\" rejoined Blake.\r\n\r\nIn this both were mistaken. During the brief false dawn they were puzzled\r\nby the odd appearance of the ground. The sudden flood of full daylight\r\nfound them staring down into a dense white fog.\r\n\r\n\"So they have that here!\" muttered Blake--\"fever-fog!\"\r\n\r\n\"Beastly shame!\" echoed Winthrope. \"I'm sure the creature has gone\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\nThis assertion was met by an outburst of snarls and yells that made all\r\nstart back and crouch down again in their sheltering hollow. As before,\r\nBlake was the first to recover.\r\n\r\n\"Bet you're right,\" he said. \"The big one has gone off, and a pack\r\nof these African coyotes are having a scrap over the bones.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean jackals. It sounds like the nasty beasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it wasn't for that fog, I'd go down and get our share of the\r\ngame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be very dangerous, Mr. Blake?\" asked Miss Leslie. \"What\r\na fearful noise!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've chased coyotes off a calf with a rope; but that's not the\r\nproposition. You don't find me fooling around in that sewer gas of a\r\nfog. We'll roost right where we are till the sun does for it. We've\r\ngot enough malaria in us already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will it be long, Blake?\" asked Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Huh? Getting hungry this quick? Wait till you've tramped around a\r\nweek, with nothing to eat but your shoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, Mr. Blake, it will not be so bad!\" protested Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Miss Jenny; but cocoanut palms don't blow over every day, and\r\nwhen those nuts are gone, what are we going to do for the next meal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Could we not make bows?\" suggested Winthrope. \"There seems to be no\r\nend of game about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bows--and arrows without points! Neither of us could hit a barn door,\r\nanyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could practise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure--six weeks' training on air pudding. I can do better with a\r\nhandful of stones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we should go at once to the cliffs,\" said Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Now you're talking--and it's Pike Peak or bust, for ours. Here's\r\none night to the good; but we won't last many more if we don't get\r\nfire. It's flints we're after now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could we not make fire by rubbing sticks?\" said Winthrope, recalling\r\nhis suggestion of the previous morning. \"I've heard that natives have\r\nno trouble--\"\r\n\r\n\"So've I, and what's more, I've seen 'em do it. Never could make\r\na go of it myself, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you remember how it is done, we have at least some chance--\"\r\n\r\n\"Give you ten to one odds! No; we'll scratch around for a flint good\r\nand plenty before we waste time that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mist is going,\" observed Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"That's no lie. Now for our coyotes. Where's my club?\"\r\n\r\n\"They've all left,\" said Winthrope, peering down. \"I can see the\r\nground clearly, and there is not a sign of the beasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are the bones--what's left of them,\" added Blake. \"It's a\r\nsmall deer, I suppose. Well, here goes.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw down his club, and dropped the loose end of the creeper after\r\nit. As the line straightened, he twisted the upper part around his leg,\r\nand was about to slide to the ground, when he remembered Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Think you can make it alone?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe girl held up her hands, sore and swollen from the lacerations of the\r\nthorns. Blake looked at them, frowned, and turned to Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Um! you got it, too, and in the face,\" he grunted. \"How's your\r\nankle?\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope wriggled his foot about, and felt the injured ankle.\r\n\r\n\"I fancy it is much better,\" he answered. \"There seems to be no\r\nswelling, and there is no pain now.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's lucky; though it will tune up later. Take a slide, now. We've\r\ngot to hustle our breakfast, and find a way to get over the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"How wide is it?\" inquired Winthrope, gazing at his swollen hands.\r\n\r\n\"About three hundred yards at high tide. May be narrower at ebb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you not build a raft?\" suggested Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\nBlake smiled at her simplicity. \"Why not a boat? We've got a penknife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I can swim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bully for you! Guess, though, we'll try something else. The river is\r\nchuck full of alligators. What you waiting for, Pat? We haven't got all\r\nday to fool around here.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope twisted the creeper about his leg and slid to the ground, doing\r\nall he could to favor his hands. He found that he could walk without\r\npain, and at once stepped over beside Blake's club, glancing nervously\r\naround at the jungle.\r\n\r\nBlake jerked up the end of the creeper, and passed the loop about Miss\r\nLeslie. Before she had time to become frightened, he swung her over and\r\nlowered her to the ground lightly as a feather. He followed, hand under\r\nhand, and stood for a moment beside her, staring at the dew-dripping\r\nfoliage of the jungle. Then the remains of the night's quarry caught\r\nhis eye, and he walked over to examine them.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Pat,\" he called, \"these don't look like deer bones. I'd\r\nsay--yes; there's the feet--it's a pig.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any tusks?\" demanded Winthrope.\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie looked away. A heap of bones, however cleanly gnawed, is\r\nnot a pleasant sight. The skull of the animal seemed to be missing; but\r\nBlake stumbled upon it in a tuft of grass, and kicked it out upon the\r\nopen ground. Every shred of hide and gristle had been gnawed from it\r\nby the jackals; yet if there had been any doubt as to the creature's\r\nidentity, there was evidence to spare in the savage tusks which projected\r\nfrom the jaws.\r\n\r\n\"Je-rusalem!\" observed Blake; \"this old boar must have been something\r\nof a scrapper his own self.\"\r\n\r\n\"In India they have been known to kill a tiger. Can you knock out the\r\ntusks?\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you said we had nothing for arrow points--\"\r\n\r\n\"Good boy! We'll cinch them, and ask questions later.\"\r\n\r\nA few blows with the club loosened the tusks. Blake handed them over to\r\nWinthrope, together with the whiskey flask, and led the way to the\r\nhalf-broken path through the thicket. A free use of his club made the\r\npath a little more worthy of the name, and as there was less need of\r\nhaste than on the previous evening, Winthrope and Miss Leslie came\r\nthrough with only a few fresh scratches. Once on open ground again,\r\nthey soon gained the fallen palms.\r\n\r\nAt a word from Blake, Miss Leslie hastened to fetch nuts for Winthrope\r\nto husk and open. Blake, who had plucked three leaves from a fan palm\r\nnear the edge of the jungle, began to split long shreds from one of the\r\nhuge leaves of a cocoanut palm. This gave him a quantity of coarse, stiff\r\nfibre, part of which he twisted in a cord and used to tie one of the\r\nleaves of the fan palm over his head.\r\n\r\n\"How's that for a bonnet?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\nThe improvised head-gear bore so grotesque a resemblance to a recent type\r\nof picture hat that Winthrope could not repress a derisive laugh. Miss\r\nLeslie, however, examined the hat and gave her opinion without a sign\r\nof amusement. \"I think it is splendid, Mr. Blake. If we must go out in\r\nthe sun again, it is just the thing to protect one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Here's two more I've fixed for you. Ready yet, Winthrope?\"\r\n\r\nThe Englishman nodded, and the three sat down to their third feast of\r\ncocoanuts. They were hungry enough at the start, and Blake added no\r\nlittle keenness even to his own appetite by a grim joke on the slender\r\nprospects of the next meal, to the effect that, if in the meantime not\r\neaten themselves, they might possibly find their next meal within a week.\r\n\r\n\"But if we must move, could we not take some of the nuts with us?\"\r\nsuggested Winthrope.\r\n\r\nBlake pondered over this as he ate, and when, fully satisfied, he helped\r\nhimself up with his club, he motioned the others to remain seated.\r\n\r\n\"There are your hats and the strings,\" he said, \"but you won't need\r\nthem now. I'm going to take a prospect along the river; and while I'm\r\ngone, you can make a try at stringing nuts on some of this leaf fibre.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Blake, do you think it's quite safe?\" asked Miss Leslie,\r\nand she glanced from him to the jungle.\r\n\r\n\"Safe?\" he repeated. \"Well, nothing ate you yesterday, if that's\r\nanything to go by. It's all I know about it.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not wait for further protests. Swinging his club on his shoulder,\r\nhe started for the break in the jungle which marked the hippopotamus\r\npath. The others looked at each other, and Miss Leslie sighed.\r\n\r\n\"If only he were a gentleman!\" she complained.\r\n\r\nWinthrope turned abruptly to the cocoanuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nAROUND THE HEADLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was mid morning before Blake reappeared. He came from the mangrove\r\nswamp where it ran down into the sea. His trousers were smeared to the\r\nthigh with slimy mud; but as he approached, the drooping brim of his\r\npalm-leaf hat failed to hide his exultant expression.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" he called. \"I've struck it. We'll be over in half an\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\" asked Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Bar,\" answered Blake, hurrying forward. \"Sling on your hats, and get\r\ninto my coat again, Miss Jenny. The sun's hot as yesterday. How about\r\nthe nuts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here they are. Three strings; all that I fancied we could carry,\"\r\nexplained Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"All right. The big one is mine, I suppose. I'll take two. We'll leave\r\nthe other. Lean on me, if your ankle is still weak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks; I can make it alone. But must we go through mud like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on this side, at least. Come on! We don't want to miss the ebb.\"\r\n\r\nBlake's impatience discouraged further inquiries. He had turned as he\r\nspoke, and the others followed him, walking close together. The pace\r\nwas sharp for Winthrope, and his ankle soon began to twinge. He was\r\ncompelled to accept Miss Leslie's invitation to take her arm. With her\r\nhelp, he managed to keep within a few yards of Blake.\r\n\r\nInstead of plunging into the mangrove wood, which here was undergrown\r\nwith a thicket of giant ferns, Blake skirted around in the open until\r\nthey came to the seashore. The tide was at its lowest, and he waved his\r\nclub towards a long sand spit which curved out around the seaward edge\r\nof the mangroves. Whether this was part of the river's bar, or had been\r\nheaped up by the cyclone would have been beyond Winthrope's knowledge,\r\nhad the question occurred to him. It was enough for him that the sand was\r\nsmooth and hard as a race track.\r\n\r\nPresently the party came to the end of the spit, where the river water\r\nrippled over the sand with the last feeble out-suck of the ebb. On their\r\nright they had a sweeping view of the river, around the flank of the\r\nmangrove screen. Blake halted at the edge of the water, and half turned.\r\n\r\n\"Close up,\" he said. \"It's shallow enough; but do you see those logs\r\nover on the mud-bank? Those are alligators.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy!--and you expect me to wade among such creatures?\" cried Miss\r\nLeslie.\r\n\r\n\"I went almost across an hour ago, and they didn't bother me any. Come\r\non! There's wind in that cloud out seaward. Inside half an hour the\r\nsurf'll be rolling up on this bar like all Niagara.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we must, we must, Miss Genevieve,\" urged Winthrope. \"Step behind\r\nme, and gather up your skirts. It's best to keep one's clothes dry in\r\nthe tropics.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl blushed, and retained his arm.\r\n\r\n\"I prefer to help you,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" called Blake, and he splashed out into the water.\r\n\r\nThe others followed within arm's-length, nervously conscious of the rows\r\nof motionless reptiles on the mud-flat, not a hundred yards distant.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the bar, where the water was a trifle over knee-deep,\r\nsome large creature came darting down-stream beneath the surface, and\r\npassed with a violent swirl between Blake and his companions. At Miss\r\nLeslie's scream, Blake whirled about and jabbed with his club at the\r\nsupposed alligator.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the brute? Has he got you?\" he shouted.\r\n\r\n\"No, no; he went by!\" gasped Winthrope. \"There he is!\"\r\n\r\nA long bony snout, fringed on either side by a row of lateral teeth, was\r\nflung up into view.\r\n\r\n\"Sawfish!\" said Blake, and he waded on across the bar, without further\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie had been on the point of fainting. The tone of Blake's voice\r\nrevived her instantly.\r\n\r\nThere were no more scares. A few minutes later they waded out upon a\r\nstretch of clean sand on the south side of the river. Before them the\r\nbeach lay in a flattened curve, which at the far end hooked sharply\r\nto the left, and appeared to terminate at the foot of the towering\r\nlimestone cliffs of the headland. A mile or more inland the river jungle\r\nedged in close to the cliffs; but from there to the beach the forest\r\nwas separated from the wall of rock by a little sandy plain, covered\r\nwith creeping plants and small palms. The greatest width of the open\r\nspace was hardly more than a quarter of a mile.\r\n\r\nBlake paused for a moment at high-tide mark, and Winthrope instantly\r\nsquatted down to nurse his ankle.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Blake,\" he said, \"can't you find me some kind of a crutch?\r\nIt is only a few yards around to those trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord! you haven't been fool enough to overstrain that ankle--\r\nYes, you have. Dammit! why couldn't you tell me before?\"\r\n\r\n\"It did not feel so painful in the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"I helped the best I could,\" interposed Miss Leslie. \"I think if you\r\ncould get Mr. Winthrope a crutch--\"\r\n\r\n\"Crutch!\" growled Blake. \"How long do you think it would take me to\r\nwade through the mud? And look at that cloud! We're in for a squall.\r\nHere!\"\r\n\r\nHe handed the girl the smaller string of cocoanuts, flung the other up\r\nthe beach, and stooped for Winthrope to mount his back. He then started\r\noff along the beach at a sharp trot. Miss Leslie followed as best she\r\ncould, the heavy cocoanuts swinging about with every step and bruising\r\nher tender body.\r\n\r\nThe wind was coming faster than Blake had calculated. Before they had\r\nrun two hundred paces, they heard the roar of rain-lashed water, and the\r\nsquall struck them with a force that almost overthrew the girl. With the\r\nwind came torrents of rain that drove through their thickest garments\r\nand drenched them to the skin within the first half-minute.\r\n\r\nBlake slackened his pace to a walk, and plodded sullenly along beneath\r\nthe driving down-pour. He kept to the lower edge of the beach, where the\r\nsand was firmest, for the force of the falling deluge beat down the waves\r\nand held in check the breakers which the wind sought to roll up the beach.\r\n\r\nThe rain storm was at its height when they reached the foot of the\r\ncliffs. The gray rock towered above them, thirty or forty feet high.\r\nBlake deposited Winthrope upon a wet ledge, and straightened up to scan\r\nthe headland. Here and there ledges ran more than half-way up the rocky\r\nwall; in other places the crest was notched by deep clefts; but nowhere\r\nwithin sight did either offer a continuous path to the summit. Blake\r\ngrunted with disgust.\r\n\r\n\"It'd take a fire ladder to get up this side,\" he said. \"We'll\r\nhave to try the other, if we can get around the point. I'm going on\r\nahead. You can follow, after Pat has rested his ankle. Keep a sharp\r\neye out for anything in the flint line--quartz or agate. That means\r\nfire. Another thing, when this rain blows over, don't let your clothes\r\ndry on you. I've got my hands full enough, without having to nurse you\r\nthrough malarial fever. Don't forget the cocoanuts, and if I don't\r\nshow up by noon, save me some.\"\r\n\r\nHe stooped to drink from a pool in the rock which was overflowing with\r\nthe cool, pure rainwater, and started off at his sharpest pace. Winthrope\r\nand Miss Leslie, seated side by side in dripping misery, watched him\r\nswing away through the rain, without energy enough to call out a parting\r\nword.\r\n\r\nBeneath the cliff the sand beach was succeeded by a talus of rocky debris\r\nwhich in places sloped up from the water ten or fifteen feet. The lower\r\npart of the slope consisted of boulders and water-worn stones, over which\r\nthe surf, reinforced by the rising tide, was beginning to break with\r\nan angry roar.\r\n\r\nBlake picked his way quickly over the smaller stones near the top of\r\nthe slope, now and then bending to snatch up a fragment that seemed to\r\ndiffer from the others. Finding nothing but limestone, he soon turned\r\nhis attention solely to the passage around the headland. Here he had\r\nexpected to find the surf much heavier. But the shore was protected by\r\na double line of reefs, so close in that the channel between did not\r\nshow a whitecap. This was fortunate, since in places the talus here sank\r\ndown almost to the level of low tide. Even a moderate surf would have\r\nrendered farther progress impracticable.\r\n\r\nAnother hundred paces brought Blake to the second corner of the cliff,\r\nwhich jutted out in a little point. He clambered around it, and stopped\r\nto survey the coast beyond. Within the last few minutes the squall had\r\nblown over, and the rain began to moderate its down-pour. The sun,\r\nbursting through the clouds, told that the storm was almost past, and\r\nits flood of direct light cleared the view.\r\n\r\nAlong the south side of the cliff the sea extended in twice as far as\r\non the north. From the end of the talus the coast trended off four or\r\nfive miles to the south-southwest in a shallow bight, whose southern\r\nextremity was bounded by a second limestone headland. This ridge ran\r\ninland parallel to the first, and from a point some little distance back\r\nfrom the shore was covered with a growth of leafless trees.\r\n\r\nBetween the two ridges lay a plain, open along the shore, but a short\r\ndistance inland covered with a jungle of tall yellow grass, above\r\nwhich, here and there, rose the tops of scrubby, leafless trees and the\r\ngraceful crests of slender-shafted palms. Blake's attention was drawn\r\nto the latter by that feeling of artificiality which their exotic\r\nappearance so often wakens in the mind of the Northern-bred man even\r\nafter long residence in the tropics. But in a moment he turned away,\r\nwith a growl. \"More of those darned feather-dusters!\" He was not\r\nlooking for palms.\r\n\r\nThe last ragged bit of cloud, with its showery accompaniment, drifted\r\npast before the breeze which followed the squall, and the end of the\r\nstorm was proclaimed by a deafening chorus of squawks and screams along\r\nthe higher ledges of the cliff. Staring upward, Blake for the first time\r\nobserved that the face of the cliff swarmed with seafowl.\r\n\r\n\"That's luck!\" he muttered. \"Guess I haven't forgot how to rob\r\nnests. Bet our fine lady'll shy at sucking them raw! All the same,\r\nshe'll have to, if I don't run across other rock than this, poor girl!\"\r\n\r\nHe advanced again along the talus, and did not stop until he reached\r\nthe sand beach. There he halted to make a careful examination, not\r\nonly of the loose debris, but of the solid rock above. Finding no sign\r\nof flint or quartz, he growled out a curse, and backed off along the\r\nbeach, to get a view of the cliff top. From a point a little beyond him,\r\noutward to the extremity of the headland, he could see that the upper\r\nledges and the crest of the cliff, as well, were fairly crowded with\r\nseafowl and their nests. His smile of satisfaction broadened when he\r\nglanced inland and saw, less than half a mile distant, a wooded cleft\r\nwhich apparently ran up to the summit of the ridge. From a point near\r\nthe top a gigantic baobab tree towered up against the skyline like a\r\nBrobdingnagian cabbage.\r\n\r\n\"Say, we may have a run for our money, after all,\" he murmured.\r\n\"Shade, and no end of grub, and, by the green of those trees, a\r\nspring--limestone water at that. Next thing, I'll find a flint!\"\r\n\r\nHe slapped his leg, and both sound and feeling reminded him that his\r\nclothes were drenched.\r\n\r\n\"Guess we'll wait about that flint,\" he said, and he made for a clump\r\nof thorn scrub a little way inland.\r\n\r\nAs the tall grass did not grow here within a mile of the shore, there\r\nwas nothing to obstruct him. The creeping plants which during the rainy\r\nseason had matted over the sandy soil were now leafless and withered by\r\nthe heat of the dry season. Even the thorn scrub was half bare of leaves.\r\n\r\nBlake walked around the clump to the shadiest side, and began to strip.\r\nIn quick succession, one garment after another was flung across a branch\r\nwhere the sun would strike it. Last of all, the shoes were emptied of\r\nrainwater and set out to dry. Without a pause, he then gave himself a\r\nquick, light rub-down, just sufficient to invigorate the skin without\r\nstarting the perspiration.\r\n\r\nPhysically the man was magnificent. His muscles were wiry and compact,\r\nrather than bulky, and as he moved, they played beneath his white skin\r\nwith the smoothness and ease of a tiger's.\r\n\r\nAfter the rub-down, he squatted on his heels, and spent some time trying\r\nto bend his palm-leaf hat back into shape. When he had placed this also\r\nout in the sun, he found himself beginning to yawn. The dry, sultry\r\nair had made him drowsy. A touch with his bare foot showed him that the\r\nsand beneath the thorn bush had already absorbed the rain and offered\r\na dry surface. He glanced around, drew his club nearer, and stretched\r\nhimself out for a nap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE CLUB AGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was past two o'clock when the sun, striking in where Blake lay\r\noutstretched, began to scorch one of his legs. He stirred uneasily, and\r\nsat upright. Like a sailor, he was wide awake the moment he opened his\r\neyes. He stood up, and peered around through the half leafless branches.\r\n\r\nOver the water thousands of gulls and terns, boobies and cormorants\r\nwere skimming and diving, while above them a number of graceful frigate\r\nbirds--those swart, scarlet-throated pirates of the air,--hung poised,\r\nready to swoop down and rob the weaker birds of their fish. All about\r\nthe headland and the surrounding water was life in fullest action. Even\r\nfrom where he stood Blake could hear the harsh clamor of the seafowl.\r\n\r\nIn marked contrast to this scene, the plain was apparently lifeless.\r\nWhen Blake rose, a small brown lizard darted away across the sand.\r\nOtherwise there was neither sight nor sound of a living creature. Blake\r\npondered this as he gathered his clothes into the shade and began to\r\ndress.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like the siesta is the all-round style in this God-forsaken\r\nhole,\" he grumbled. \"Haven't seen so much as a rabbit, nor even one\r\nland bird. May be a drought--no; must be the dry season-- Whee, these\r\nthings are hot! I'm thirsty as a shark. Now, where's that softy and\r\nher Ladyship? 'Fraid she's in for a tough time!\"\r\n\r\nHe drew on his shoes with a jerk, growled at their stiffness, and club in\r\nhand, stepped clear of the brush to look for his companions. The first\r\nglance along the foot of the cliff showed him Winthrope lying under the\r\nshade of the overhanging ledges, a few yards beyond the sand beach. Of\r\nMiss Leslie there was no sign. Half alarmed by this, Blake started for\r\nthe beach with his swinging stride. Winthrope was awake, and on Blake's\r\napproach, sat up to greet him.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" he called. \"Where have you been all this time?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Sleep. Where's Miss Leslie?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's around the point.\"\r\n\r\nBlake grinned mockingly. \"Indeed! But I fawncy she won't be for long.\"\r\n\r\nHe would have passed on, but Winthrope stepped before him.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go out there, Blake,\" he protested. \"I--ah--think it would be\r\nbetter if I went.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" demanded Blake.\r\n\r\nWinthrope hesitated; but an impatient movement by Blake forced an answer:\r\n\"Well, you remember, this morning, telling us to dry our clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I remember,\" said Blake. \"So you want to serve as lady's\r\nvalet?\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope's plump face turned a sickly yellow.\r\n\r\n\"I--ah--valet?--What do you mean, sir? I protest--I do not understand\r\nyou!\" he stammered. But in the midst, catching sight of Blake's\r\nbewildered stare, he suddenly flushed crimson, and burst out in\r\nunrestrained anger: \"You--you bounder--you beastly cad! Any man with\r\nan ounce of decency--\"\r\n\r\nBlake uttered a jeering laugh-- \"Wow! Hark, how the British lion\r\nr-r-ro-ars when his tail's twisted!\"\r\n\r\n\"You beastly cad!\" repeated the Englishman, now purple with rage.\r\n\r\nBlake's unpleasant pleasantry gave place to a scowl. His jaw thrust\r\nout like a bulldog's, and he bent towards Winthrope with a menacing\r\nlook. For a moment the Englishman faced him, sustained by his anger. But\r\nthere was a steely light in Blake's eyes that he could not withstand.\r\nWinthrope's defiant stare wavered and fell. He shrank back, the color\r\nfast ebbing from his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\" growled Blake. \"Guess you won't blat any more about cads! You\r\ndamned hypocrite! Maybe I'm not on to how you've been hanging around\r\nMiss Leslie just because she's an heiress. Anything is fair enough for\r\nyou swells. But let a fellow so much as open his mouth about your exalted\r\nset, and it's perfectly dreadful, you know!\"\r\n\r\nHe paused for a reply. Winthrope only drew back a step farther, and\r\neyed him with a furtive, sidelong glance. This brought Blake back to\r\nhis mocking jeer. \"You'll learn, Pat, me b'y. There's lots of\r\nthings'll show up different to you before we get through this picnic.\r\nFor one thing, I'm boss here--president, congress, and supreme court.\r\nUnderstand?\"\r\n\r\n\"By what right, may I ask?\" murmured Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" answered Blake. \"That hasn't anything to do with the\r\nquestion--it's might. Back in civilized parts, your little crowd has\r\nthe drop on my big crowd, and runs things to suit themselves. But\r\nhere we've sort of reverted to primitive society. This happens to be\r\nthe Club Age, and I'm the Man with the Big Stick. See?\"\r\n\r\n\"I myself sympathize with the lower classes, Mr. Blake. Above all, I\r\nthink it barbarous the way they punish one who is forced by circumstances\r\nto appropriate part of the ill-gotten gains of the rich upstarts. But\r\ndo you believe, Mr. Blake, that brute strength--\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet! Now shut up. Where're the cocoanuts?\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope picked up two nuts and handed them over.\r\n\r\n\"There were only five,\" he explained.\r\n\r\n\"All right. I'm no captain of industry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, true; you said we had reverted to barbarism,\" rejoined Winthrope,\r\nventuring an attempt at sarcasm.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky for you!\" retorted Blake. \"But where's Miss Leslie all this\r\ntime? Her clothes must have dried hours ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"They did. We had luncheon together just this side of the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you did! Then why shouldn't I go for her?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I--there was a shaded pool around the point, and she thought a dip\r\nin the salt water would refresh her. She went not more than half an hour\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that's it. Well, while I eat, you go and call her--and say, you\r\nkeep this side the point. I'm looking out for Miss Leslie now.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope hurried away, clenching his fists and almost weeping with\r\nimpotent rage. Truly, matters were now very different from what they had\r\nbeen aboard ship. Fortunately he had not gone a dozen steps before Miss\r\nLeslie appeared around the corner of the cliff. He was scrambling along\r\nover the loose stones of the slope without the slightest consideration\r\nfor his ankle. The girl, more thoughtful, waved to him to wait for her\r\nwhere he was.\r\n\r\nAs she approached, Blake's frown gave place to a look that made his\r\nface positively pleasant. He had already drained the cocoanuts; now\r\nhe proceeded to smash the shells into small bits, that he might eat the\r\nmeat, and at the same time keep his gaze on the girl. The cliff foot\r\nbeing well shaded by the towering wall of rock, she had taken off his\r\ncoat, and was carrying it on her arm; so that there was nothing to mar\r\nthe effect of her dainty openwork waist, with its elbow sleeves and\r\ngraceful collar and the filmy veil of lace over the shoulders and bosom.\r\nHer skirt had been washed clean by the rain, and she had managed to\r\nstretch it into shape before drying.\r\n\r\nRefreshed by a nap in the forenoon and by her salt-water dip, she showed\r\nmore vivacity than at any time that Winthrope could remember during their\r\nacquaintance. Her suffering during and since the storm had left its\r\nmark in the dark circles beneath her hazel eyes, but this in no wise\r\nlessened their brightness; while the elasticity of her step showed that\r\nshe had quite recovered her well-bred ease and grace of movement.\r\n\r\nShe bowed and smiled to the two men impartially. \"Good-afternoon,\r\ngentlemen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Same to you, Miss Leslie!\" responded Blake, staring at her with frank\r\nadmiration. \"You look fresh as a daisy.\"\r\n\r\nGenial and sincere as was his tone, the familiarity jarred on her\r\nsensitive ear. She colored as she turned from him.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything new, Mr. Winthrope?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not, Miss Genevieve. Like ourselves, Blake took a nap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but Blake first took a squint at the scenery. Just see if you've\r\ngot everything, and fix your hats. We'll be in the sun for half a mile\r\nor so. Better get on the coat, Miss Leslie. It's hotter than yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Permit me,\" said Winthrope.\r\n\r\nBlake watched while the Englishman held the coat for the girl and rather\r\nfussily raised the collar about her neck and turned back the sleeves,\r\nwhich extended beyond the tips of her fingers. The American's face\r\nwas stolid; but his glance took in every little look and act of his\r\ncompanions. He was not altogether unversed in the ways of good society,\r\nand it seemed to him that the Englishman was somewhat over-assiduous in\r\nhis attentions.\r\n\r\n\"All ready, Blake,\" remarked Winthrope, finally, with a last lingering\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout time!\" grunted Blake. \"You're fussy as a tailor. Got the\r\nflask and cigarette case and the knife?\"\r\n\r\n\"All safe, sir--er--all safe, Blake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you two follow me slow enough not to worry that ankle. I don't\r\nwant any more of the pack-mule in mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are we going, Mr. Blake?\" exclaimed Miss Leslie. \"You will not\r\nleave us again!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's only a half-mile, Miss Jenny. There's a break in the ridge. I'm\r\ngoing on ahead to find if it's hard to climb.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should we climb?\"\r\n\r\n\"Food, for one thing. You see, this end of the cliff is covered with\r\nsea-birds. Another thing, I expect to strike a spring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I hope you do! The water in the rain pools is already warm.\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll be dry in a day or two. Say, Winthrope, you might fetch some\r\nof those stones--size of a ball. I used to be a fancy pitcher when I was\r\na kid, and we might scare up a rabbit or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"I play cricket myself. But these stones--\"\r\n\r\n\"Better'n a gun, when you haven't got the gun. Come on. We'll go in\r\na bunch, after all, in case I need stones.\"\r\n\r\nWith due consideration for Winthrope's ankle,--not for Winthrope,--Blake\r\nset so slow a pace that the half-mile's walk consumed over half an\r\nhour. But his smouldering irritation was soon quenched when they drew\r\nnear the green thicket at the foot of the cleft. In the almost\r\ndeathlike stillness of mid-afternoon, the sound of trickling water came\r\nto their ears, clear and musical.\r\n\r\n\"A spring!\" shouted Blake. \"I guessed right. Look at those green\r\nplants and grass; there's the channel where it runs out in the sand and\r\ndries up.\"\r\n\r\nThe others followed him eagerly as he pushed in among the trees. They\r\nsaw no running water, for the tiny rill that trickled down the ledges\r\nwas matted over with vines. But at the foot of the slope lay a pool, some\r\nten yards across, and overshadowed by the surrounding trees. There was\r\nno underbrush, and the ground was trampled bare as a floor.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove,\" said Winthrope; \"see the tracks! There must have been a\r\ndrove of sheep about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Deer, you mean,\" replied Blake, bending to examine the deeper prints\r\nat the edge of the pool. \"These ain't sheep tracks. A lot of them are\r\nlarger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you not uncover the brook?\" asked Miss Leslie. \"If animals have\r\nbeen drinking here, one would prefer cleaner water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" assented Blake. \"If you're game for a climb, and can wait a\r\nfew minutes, we'll get it out of the spring itself. We've got to go\r\nup anyway, to get at our poultry yard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's a place that looks like a path,\" called Winthrope, who had\r\ncircled about the edge of the pool to the farther side.\r\n\r\nBlake ran around beside him, and stared at the tunnel-like passage which\r\nwound up the limestone ledges beneath the over-arching thickets.\r\n\r\n\"Odd place, is it not?\" observed Winthrope. \"Looks like a fox run,\r\nonly larger, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too low for deer, though--and their hoofs would have cut up the moss\r\nand ferns more. Let's get a close look.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Blake stooped and climbed a few yards up the trail to an\r\noverhanging ledge, four or five feet high. Where the trail ran up over\r\nthis break in the slope the stone was bare of all vegetation. Blake\r\nlaid his club on the top of the ledge, and was about to vault after it,\r\nwhen, directly beneath his nose, he saw the print of a great catlike paw,\r\noutlined in dried mud. At the same instant a deep growl came rumbling\r\ndown the \"fox run.\" Without waiting for a second warning, Blake drew\r\nhis club to him, and crept back down the trail. His stealthy movements\r\nand furtive backward glances filled his companions with vague terror.\r\nHe himself was hardly less alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Get out of the trees--into the open!\" he exclaimed in a hoarse\r\nwhisper, and as they crept away, white with dread of the unknown danger,\r\nhe followed at their heels, looking backward, his club raised in\r\nreadiness to strike.\r\n\r\nOnce clear of the trees, Winthrope caught Miss Leslie by the hand, and\r\nbroke into a run. In their terror, they paid no heed to Blake's command\r\nto stop. They had darted off so unexpectedly that he did not overtake\r\nthem short of a hundred yards.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" he said, gripping Winthrope roughly by the shoulder. \"It's\r\nsafe enough here, and you'll knock out that blamed ankle.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it? What did you see?\" gasped Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Footprint,\" mumbled Blake, ashamed of his fright.\r\n\r\n\"A lion's?\" cried Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Not so large--'bout the size of a puma's. Must be a leopard's den\r\nup there. I heard a growl, and thought it about time to clear out.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, we'd better withdraw around the point!\"\r\n\r\n\"Withdraw your aunty! There's no leopard going to tackle us out here in\r\nopen ground this time of day. The sneaking tomcat! If only I had a match,\r\nI'd show him how we smoke rat holes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Winthrope spoke of rubbing sticks to make fire,\" suggested Miss\r\nLeslie.\r\n\r\n\"Make sweat, you mean. But we may as well try it now, if we're going\r\nto at all. The sun's hot enough to fry eggs. We'll go back to a shady\r\nplace, and pick up sticks on the way.\"\r\n\r\nThough there was shade under the cliff within some six hundred feet,\r\nthey had to go some distance to the nearest dry wood--a dead thorp-bush.\r\nHere they gathered a quantity of branches, even Miss Leslie volunteering\r\nto carry a load.\r\n\r\nAll was thrown down in a heap near the cliff, and Blake squatted beside\r\nit, penknife in hand. Having selected the dryest of the larger sticks,\r\nhe bored a hole in one side and dropped in a pinch of powdered bark.\r\nLaying the stick in the full glare of the sun, he thrust a twig into the\r\nhole, and began to twirl it between his palms. This movement he kept up\r\nfor several minutes; but whether he was unable to twirl the twig fast\r\nenough, or whether the right kind of wood or tinder was lacking, all his\r\nefforts failed to produce a spark.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to accept the failure, Winthrope insisted upon trying in turn,\r\nand pride held him to the task until he was drenched with sweat. The\r\nresult was the same.\r\n\r\n\"Told you so,\" jeered Blake from where he. lay in the shade. \"We'd\r\nstand more chance cracking stones together.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what shall we do now?\" asked Miss Leslie. \"I am becoming very\r\ntired of cocoanuts, and there seems to be nothing else around here.\r\nIndeed, I think this is all such a waste of time. If we had walked\r\nstraight along the shore this morning we might have reached a town.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might, Miss Jenny, and then, again, we mightn't. I happened to\r\noverhaul the captain's chart--Quilimane, Mozambique--that's all\r\nfor hundreds of miles. Towns on this coast are about as thick as\r\nhens'-teeth.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about native villages?\" demanded Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; maybe I'm fool enough to go into a wild nigger town without a\r\ngun. Maybe I didn't talk with fellows down on the Rand.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what shall we do?\" repeated Miss Leslie, with a little frightened\r\ncatch in her voice. She was at last beginning to realize what this rude\r\nbreak in her sheltered, pampered life might mean. \"What shall we do?\r\nIt's--it's absurd to think of having to stay in this horrid country\r\nfor weeks or perhaps months--unless some ship comes for us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Miss Leslie,\" answered Blake, sharply yet not unkindly;\r\n\"suppose you just sit back and use your thinker a bit. If you're\r\nyour daddy's daughter, you've got brains somewhere down under the\r\nboarding-school stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't get huffy, please! It's a question of think, not of\r\nputting on airs. Here we are, worse off than the people of the Stone\r\nAge. They had fire and flint axes; we've got nothing but our think\r\ntanks, and as to lions and leopards and that sort of thing, it strikes me\r\nwe've got about as many on hand as they had.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you and Mr. Winthrope should immediately arm yourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?--But we'll leave that till later. What else?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl gazed at the surrounding objects, her forehead wrinkled in the\r\neffort at concentration. \"We must have water. Think how we suffered\r\nyesterday! Then there is shelter from wild beasts, and food, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"All right here under our hands, if we had fire. Understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand about the water. You would frighten the leopard away with\r\nthe fire; and if it would do that, it would also keep away the other\r\nanimals at night. But as for food, unless we return for cocoanuts--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't give it up! Keep your thinker going on the side, while Pat tells\r\nus our next move. Now that he's got the fire sticks out of his head--\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Blake, I wish you would drop that name. It is no harder to say\r\nWinthrope.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're off, there,\" rejoined Blake. \"But look here, I'll make it\r\nWin, if you figure out what we ought to do next.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Blake, that would not be half bad. They--er--they called me Win\r\nat Harrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That so? My English chum went to Harrow--Jimmy Scarbridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord James!--your chum?\"\r\n\r\n\"He started in like you, sort of top-lofty. But he chummed all\r\nright--after I took out a lot of his British starch with a good\r\nwalloping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, really now, Blake, you can't expect any one with brains to believe\r\nthat, you know!\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I don't know, you know,--and I don't know if you've got any\r\nbrains, you know. Here's your chance to show us. What's our next move?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, now, I have had no experience in this sort of thing--don't\r\ninterrupt, please! It seems to me that our first concern is shelter for\r\nthe night. If we should return to your tree nest, we should also be near\r\nthe cocoa palms.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's one side. Here's the other. Bar to wade across--sharks and\r\nalligators; then swampy ground--malaria, mosquitoes, thorn jungle. Guess\r\nthe hands of both of you are still sore enough, by their look.\"\r\n\r\n\"If only I had a pot of cold cream!\" sighed Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"If only I had a hunk of jerked beef!\" echoed Blake.\r\n\r\n\"I say, why couldn't we chance it for the night around on the seaward\r\nface of the cliff?\" asked Winthrope. \"I noticed a place where the\r\nledges overhang--almost a cave. Do you think it probable that any wild\r\nbeast would venture so close to the sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't say. Didn't see any tracks; so we'll chance it for to-night.\r\nNext!\"\r\n\r\n\"By morning I believe my ankle will be in such shape that I could go\r\nback for the string of cocoanuts which we dropped on the beach.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go myself, to-day, else we'll have no supper. Now we're getting\r\ndown to bedrock. If those nuts haven't been washed away by the tide,\r\nwe're fixed for to-night; and for two meals, such as they are. But what\r\nnext? Even the rain pools will be dried up by another day or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are not sea-birds good to eat?\" inquired Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Some.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, if only we could climb the cliff--might there not be another\r\nplace?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I've looked at both sides. What's more, that spotted tomcat has\r\ngot a monopoly on our water supply. The river may be fresh at low tide;\r\nbut we've got nothing to boil water in, and such bayou stuff is just\r\nconcentrated malaria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must find water elsewhere,\" responded Miss Leslie. \"Might\r\nwe not succeed if we went on to the other ridge?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the ticket! You've got a headpiece, Miss Jenny! It's too\r\nlate to start now. But first thing to-morrow I'll take a run down that\r\nway, while you two lay around camp and see if you can twist some sort of\r\nfish-line out of cocoanut fibre. By braiding your hair, Miss Jenny, you\r\ncan spare us your hair-pins for hooks.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Blake, I'm afraid--I'd rather you'd take us with you. With\r\nthat dreadful creature so near--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know. Let's see your feet?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie glanced at him, and thrust a slender foot from beneath her\r\nskirt.\r\n\r\n\"Um-m--stocking torn; but those slippers are tougher than I thought.\r\nMost of the way will be good walking, along the beach. We'll leave the\r\nfishing to Pat--er--beg pardon--Win! With his ankle--\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, Blake, I'll chance the ankle. Don't leave me behind. I give\r\nyou my word, you'll not have to lug me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, of course, Mr. Winthrope must go with us!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Fraid to go alone, eh?\" demanded Blake, frowning.\r\n\r\nHis tone startled and offended her; yet all he saw was a politely\r\nquizzical lifting of her brows.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I be afraid, Mr. Blake?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nBlake stared at her moodily. But when she met his gaze with a confiding\r\nsmile, he flushed and looked away.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he muttered; \"well move camp together. But don't expect\r\nme to pack his ludship, if we draw a blank and have to trek back without\r\nfood or water.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE LEOPARDS' DEN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Blake made a successful trip for the abandoned cocoanuts, his\r\ncompanions levelled the stones beneath the ledges chosen by Winthrope,\r\nand gathered enough dried sea-weed along the talus to soften the hard\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\nSoothed by the monotonous wash of the sea among the rocks, even Miss\r\nLeslie slept well. Blake, who had insisted that she should retain his\r\ncoat, was wakened by the chilliness preceding the dawn. Five minutes\r\nlater they started on their journey.\r\n\r\nThe starlight glimmered on the waves and shed a faint radiance over the\r\nrocks. This and their knowledge of the way enabled them to pick a path\r\nalong the foot of the cliff without difficulty. Once on the beach, they\r\nswung along at a smart gait, invigorated by the cool air.\r\n\r\nDawn found them half way to their goal. Blake called a halt when the\r\nfirst red streaks shot up the eastern sky. All stood waiting until\r\nthe quickly following sun sprang forth from the sea. Blake's first\r\nact was to glance from one headland to the other, estimating their\r\nrelative distances. His grunt of satisfaction was lost in Winthrope's\r\nexclamation, \"By Jove, look at the cattle!\"\r\n\r\nBlake and Miss Leslie turned to stare at the droves of animals moving\r\nabout between them and the border of the tall grass. Miss Leslie was the\r\nfirst to speak. \"They can't be cattle, Mr. Winthrope. There are some\r\nwith stripes. I do believe they're zebras!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get down!\" commanded Blake. \"They're all wild game. Those big\r\nox-like fellows to the left of the zebras are eland. Whee! wouldn't we\r\nbe in it if we owned that water hole? I'll bet I'd have one of those\r\nfat beeves inside three days.\"\r\n\r\n\"How I should enjoy a juicy steak!\" murmured Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Raw or jerked?\" questioned Blake.\r\n\r\n\"What is 'jerked'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dried.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; I mean broiled--just red inside.\"\r\n\r\n\"I prefer mine quite rare,\" added Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"That's the way you'll get it, damned rare--Beg your pardon, Miss\r\nJenny! Without fire, we'll have the choice of raw or jerked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrors!\"\r\n\r\n\"Jerked meat is all right. You cut your game in strips--\"\r\n\r\n\"With a penknife!\" laughed Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\nBlake stared at her glumly. \"That's so. You've got it back on\r\nme-- Butcher a beef with a penknife! We'll have to take it raw, and\r\ndog-fashion at that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't I heard of bamboo knives?\" said Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Bamboo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I can't say, but as I remember, it seems to me that the\r\nvarnish-like glaze--\"\r\n\r\n\"Silica? Say, that would cut meat. But where in--where in hades are the\r\nbamboos?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I can't say. Only I remember that I have seen them in other\r\ntropical places, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meantime I prefer cocoanuts, until we have a fire to broil our\r\nsteaks,\" remarked Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Ditto, Miss Jenny, long's we have the nuts and no meat. I'm a\r\nvegetarian now--but maybe my mouth ain't watering for something else.\r\nLook at all those chops and roasts and stews running around out there!\"\r\n\r\n\"They are making for the grass,\" observed Winthrope. \"Hadn't we\r\nbetter start?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nuts won't weigh so much without the shells. We'll eat right here.\"\r\n\r\nThere were only a few nuts left. They were drained and cracked and\r\nscooped out, one after another. The last chanced to break evenly across\r\nthe middle.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" said Blake, \"the lower part of this will do for a bowl, Miss\r\nJenny. When you've eaten the cream, put it in your pocket. Say, Win,\r\nhave you got the bottle and keys and--\"\r\n\r\n\"All safe--everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure, Mr. Winthrope?\" asked Miss Leslie. \"Men's pockets seem\r\nso open. Twice I've had to pick up Mr. Blake's locket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Locket?\" echoed Blake.\r\n\r\n\"The ivory locket. Women may be curious, Mr. Blake, but I assure you, I\r\ndid not look inside, though--\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me--give it here--quick!\" gasped Blake.\r\n\r\nStartled by his tone and look, Miss Leslie caught an oval object from\r\nthe side pocket of the coat, and thrust it into Blake's outstretched\r\nhand. For a moment he stared at it, unable to believe his eyes; then\r\nhe leaped up, with a yell that sent the droves of zebras and antelope\r\nflying into the tall grass.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh!\" screamed Miss Leslie. \"Is it a snake? Are you bitten?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bitten?--Yes, by John Barleycorn! Must have been fuzzy drunk to put it\r\nin my coat. Always carry it in my fob pocket. What a blasted infernal\r\nidiot I've been! Kick me, Win,--kick me hard!\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Blake, what is it? I don't quite take you. If you would only--\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire!--_fire!_ Can't you see? We've got all hell beat! Look here.\"\r\n\r\nHe snapped open the slide of the supposed locket, and before either of\r\nhis companions could realize what he would be about, was focussing the\r\nlens of a surveyor's magnifying-glass upon the back of Winthrope's\r\nhand. The Englishman jerked the hand away--\r\n\r\n\"_Ow!_ That burns!\"\r\n\r\nBlake shook the glass in their bewildered faces.\r\n\r\n\"Look there!\" he shouted, \"there's fire; there's water; there's\r\nbirds' eggs and beefsteaks! Here's where we trek on the back trail.\r\nWe'll smoke out that leopard in short order!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say, Blake--\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I mean to do! Don't worry. You can hide with Miss Jenny on the\r\npoint, while I engineer the deal. Fall in.\"\r\n\r\nThe day was still fresh when they found themselves back at the foot of\r\nthe cliff. Here arose a heated debate between the men. Winthrope, stung\r\nby Blake's jeering words, insisted upon sharing the attack, though with\r\nno great enthusiasm. Much to Blake's surprise, Miss Leslie came to the\r\nsupport of the Englishman.\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Blake,\" she argued, \"you say it will be perfectly safe for\r\nus here. If so, it will be safe for myself alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can play this game without him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt. Yet if, as you say, you expect to keep off the leopard with\r\na torch, would it not be well to have Mr. Winthrope at hand with other\r\ntorches, should yours burn out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; if I thought he'd be at hand after the first scare.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope started off, almost on a run. At that moment he might have\r\nfaced the leopard single-handed. Blake chuckled as he swung away after\r\nhis victim. Within ten paces, however, he paused to call back over his\r\nshoulder: \"Get around the point, Miss Jenny, and if you want something\r\nto do, try braiding the cocoanut fibre.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie made no response; but she stood for some time gazing after\r\nthe two men. There was so much that was characteristic even in this rear\r\nview. For all his anger and his haste, the Englishman bore himself\r\nwith an air of well-bred nicety. His trim, erect figure needed only a\r\nfresh suit to be irreproachable. On the other hand, a careless observer,\r\nat first glance, might have mistaken Blake, with his flannel shirt and\r\nshouldered club, for a hulking navvy. But there was nothing of the\r\nnavvy in his swinging stride or in the resolute poise of his head as he\r\ncame up with Winthrope.\r\n\r\nThough the girl was not given to reflection, the contrast between the two\r\ncould not but impress her. How well her countryman--coarse, uncultured,\r\nbut full of brute strength and courage--fitted in with these primitive\r\nsurroundings. Whereas Winthrope . . . . and herself . . . .\r\n\r\nShe fell into a kind of disquieted brown study. Her eyes had an odd\r\nlook, both startled and meditative,--such a look as might be expected\r\nof one who for the first time is peering beneath the surface of things,\r\nand sees the naked Realities of Life, the real values, bared of masking\r\nconventions. It may have been that she was seeking to ponder the meaning\r\nof her own existence--that she had caught a glimpse of the vanity and\r\nwastefulness, the utter futility of her life. At the best, it could\r\nonly have been a glimpse. But was not that enough?\r\n\r\n\"Of what use are such people as I?\" she cried. \"That man may be rough\r\nand coarse,--even a brute; but he at least does things--I'll show him\r\nthat I can do things, too!\"\r\n\r\nShe hastened out around the corner of the cliff to the spot where they\r\nhad spent the night. Here she gathered together the cocoanut husks,\r\nand seating herself in the shade of the overhanging ledges, began to\r\npick at the coarse fibre. It was cruel work for her soft fingers,\r\nnot yet fully healed from the thorn wounds. At times the pain and an\r\noverpowering sense of injury brought tears to her eyes; still more\r\noften she dropped the work in despair of her awkwardness. Yet always\r\nshe returned to the task with renewed energy.\r\n\r\nAfter no little perseverance, she found how to twist the fibre and plait\r\nit into cord. At best it was slow work, and she did not see how she\r\nshould ever make enough cord for a fish-line. Yet, as she caught the\r\nknack of the work and her fingers became more nimble, she began to enjoy\r\nthe novel pleasure of producing something.\r\n\r\nShe had quite forgot to feel injured, and was learning to endure with\r\npatience the rasping of the fibre between her fingers, when Winthrope\r\ncame clambering around the corner of the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" she exclaimed, springing up and hurrying to meet him. He\r\nwas white and quivering, and the look in his eyes filled her with dread.\r\n\r\nHer voice shrilled to a scream, \"He's dead!\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Then he's hurt!--he's hurt by that savage creature, and you've run\r\noff and left him--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Miss Genevieve, I must insist! The fellow is not even\r\nscratched.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why--?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the horror of it all. It actually made me ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"You frightened me almost to death. Did the beast chase you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That would have been better, in a way. Really, it was horrible! I'm\r\nstill sick over it, Miss Genevieve.\"\r\n\r\n\"But tell me about it. Did you set fire to the bushes in the cleft, as\r\nMr. Blake--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; after we had fetched what we could carry of that long grass--two\r\nbig trusses. It grows ten or twelve feet tall, and is now quite dry.\r\nPart of it Blake made into torches, and we fired the bush all across\r\nthe foot of the cleft. Really, one would not have thought there was that\r\nmuch dry wood in so green a dell. On either side of the rill the grass\r\nand brush flared like tinder, and the flames swept up the cleft far\r\nquicker than we had expected. We could hear them crackling and roaring\r\nlouder than ever after the smoke shut out our view.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, there is nothing so very horrible in that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, oh, no; it was not that. But the beast--the leopard! At first we\r\nheard one roar; then it was that dreadful snarling and yelling--most\r\nawful squalling! . . . . The wretched thing came leaping and\r\ntumbling down the path, all singed and blinded. Blake fired the big\r\ntruss of grass, and the brute rolled right into the flames. It was\r\nshocking--dreadfully shocking! The wretched creature writhed and leaped\r\nabout till it plunged into the pool. . . . . When it sought to crawl\r\nout, all black and hideous, Blake went up and killed it with his\r\nclub--crushed in its skull--Ugh!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie gazed at the unnerved Englishman with calm scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\"But why should you feel so about it?\" she asked. \"Was it not the\r\nbeast's life against ours?\"\r\n\r\n\"But so horrible a death!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure Mr. Blake would have preferred to shoot the creature, had he\r\na gun. Having nothing else than fire, I think it was all very brave of\r\nhim. Now we are sure of water and food. Had we not best be going?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was to fetch you that Blake sent me.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope spoke with perceptible stiffness. He was chagrined, not only\r\nby her commendation of Blake, but by the indifference with which she had\r\nmet his agitation.\r\n\r\nThey started at once, Miss Leslie in the lead. As they rounded the point,\r\nshe caught sight of the smoke still rising from the cleft. A little later\r\nshe noticed the vultures which were streaming down out of the sky from\r\nall quarters other than seaward. Their focal point seemed to be the trees\r\nat the foot of the cleft. A nearer view showed that they were alighting\r\nin the thorn bushes on the south border of the wood.\r\n\r\nOf Blake there was nothing to be seen until Miss Leslie, still in the\r\nlead, pushed in among the trees. There they found him crouched beside\r\na small fire, near the edge of the pool. He did not look up. His eyes\r\nwere riveted in a hungry stare upon several pieces of flesh, suspended\r\nover the flames on spits of green twigs.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" he sang out, as he heard their footsteps. \"Just in time, Miss\r\nJenny. Your broiled steak'll be ready in short order.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, build up the fire! I'm simply ravenous!\" she exclaimed, between\r\nimpatience and delight.\r\n\r\nWinthrope was hardly less keen; yet his hunger did not altogether blunt\r\nhis curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Blake,\" he inquired, \"where did you get the meat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stow it, Win, my boy. This ain't a packing house. The stuff may be\r\ntough, but it's not--er--the other thing. Here you are, Miss Jenny. Chew\r\nit off the stick.\"\r\n\r\nThough Winthrope had his suspicions, he took the piece of half-burned\r\nflesh which Blake handed him in turn, and fell to eating without further\r\nquestion. As Blake had surmised, the roast proved far other than\r\ntender. Hunger, however, lent it a most appetizing flavor. The repast\r\nended when there was nothing left to devour. Blake threw away his empty\r\nspit, and rose to stretch. He waited for Miss Leslie to swallow her\r\nlast mouthful, and then began to chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"What's the joke?\" asked Winthrope.\r\n\r\nBlake looked at him solemnly.\r\n\r\n\"Well now, that was downright mean of me,\" he drawled; \"after robbing\r\nthem, to laugh at it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Robbing who?\"\r\n\r\n\"The buzzards.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've fed us on leopard meat! It's--it's disgusting!\"\r\n\r\n\"I found it filling. How about you, Miss Jenny?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie did not know whether to laugh or to give way to a feeling\r\nof nausea. She did neither.\r\n\r\n\"Can we not find the spring of which you spoke?\" she asked. \"I am\r\nthirsty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess the fire is about burnt out,\" assented Blake. \"Come on;\r\nwe'll see.\"\r\n\r\nThe cleft now had a far different aspect from what it had presented on\r\ntheir first visit. The largest of the trees, though scorched about the\r\nbase, still stood with unwithered foliage, little harmed by the fire.\r\nBut many of their small companions had been killed and partly destroyed\r\nby the heat and flames from the burning brush. In places the fire was yet\r\nsmouldering.\r\n\r\nBlake picked a path along the edge of the rill, where the moist\r\nvegetation, though scorched, had refused to burn. After the first\r\nabrupt ledge, up which Blake had to drag his companions, the ascent\r\nwas easy. But as they climbed around an outjutting corner of the steep\r\nright wall of the cleft, Blake muttered a curse of disappointment. He\r\ncould now see that the cleft did not run to the top of the cliff, but\r\nthrough it, like a tiny box canyon. The sides rose sheer and smooth as\r\nwalls. Midway, at the highest point of the cleft, the baobab towered high\r\nabove the ridge crest, its gigantic trunk filling a third of the breadth\r\nof the little gorge. Unfortunately it stood close to the left wall.\r\n\r\n\"Here's luck for you!\" growled Blake. \"Why couldn't the blamed old\r\ntree have grown on the other side? We might have found a way to climb it.\r\nGuess we'll have to smoke out another leopard. We're no nearer those\r\nbirds' nests than we were yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, look here!\" exclaimed Winthrope. \"This is our chance for\r\nantelope! Here by the spring are bamboos--real bamboos,--and only half\r\nthe thicket burned.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of them?\" demanded Blake.\r\n\r\n\"Bows--arrows--and did you not agree that they would make knives?\"\r\n\r\n\"Umph--we'll see. What is it, Miss Jenny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that a hole in the big tree?\"\r\n\r\n\"Looks like it. These baobabs are often hollow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that is where the leopard had his den,\" added Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Shouldn't wonder. We'll go and see.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Blake,\" protested the girl, \"may there not be other\r\nleopards?\"\r\n\r\n\"Might have been; but I'll bet they lit out with the other. Look how\r\nthe tree is scorched. Must have been stacks of dry brush around the hole,\r\n'nough to smoke out a fireman. We'll look and see if they left any soup\r\nbones lying around. First, though, here's your drink, Miss Jenny.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Blake kicked aside some smouldering branches, and led the\r\nway to the crevice whence the spring trickled from the rock into a\r\nshallow stone basin. When all had drunk their fill of the clear cool\r\nwater, Blake took up his club and walked straight across to the baobab.\r\nLess than thirty steps brought him to the narrow opening in the trunk\r\nof the huge tree. At first he could make out nothing in the dimly lit\r\ninterior; but the fetid, catty odor was enough to convince him that he\r\nhad found the leopards' den.\r\n\r\nHe caught the vague outlines of a long body, crouched five or six\r\nyards away, on the far side of the hollow. He sprang back, his club\r\nbrandished to strike. But the expected attack did not follow. Blake\r\nglanced about as though considering the advisability of a retreat.\r\nWinthrope and Miss Leslie were staring at him, white-faced. The sight of\r\ntheir terror seemed to spur him to dare-devil bravado; though his\r\nactions may rather have been due to the fact that he realized the\r\nfutility of flight, and so rose to the requirements of the situation--the\r\ngrim need to stand and face the danger.\r\n\r\n\"Get behind the bamboos!\" he called, and as they hurriedly obeyed, he\r\ncaught up a stone and flung it in at the crouching beast.\r\n\r\nHe heard the missile strike with a soft thud that told him he had not\r\nmissed his mark, and he swung up his club in both hands. Given half a\r\nchance, he would smash the skull of the female leopard as he had crushed\r\nher blinded mate. . . . . One moment after another passed, and he stood\r\npoised for the shock, tense and scowling. . . . . Not so much as a snarl\r\ncame from within. The truth flashed upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Smothered!\" he yelled.\r\n\r\nThe others saw him dart in through the hole. A moment later two limp\r\ngrayish bodies were flung out into the open. Immediately after, Blake\r\nreappeared, dragging the body of the mother leopard.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right; they're dead!\" cried Winthrope, and he ran forward\r\nto look at the bodies.\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie followed, hardly less curious.\r\n\r\n\"Are they all dead, Mr. Blake?\" she inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Wiped out--whole family. The old cat stayed by her kittens, and all\r\nsmothered together--lucky for us! Get busy with those bamboos, Win. I'm\r\ngoing to have these skins, and the sooner we get the cub meat hung up\r\nand curing, the better for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leopard meat again!\" rejoined Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Spring leopard, young and tender! What more could you ask? Get a move\r\non you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I do anything, Mr. Blake?\" asked Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Hunt a shady spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I really mean it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if that's straight, you might go on along the gully, and see if\r\nthere's any place to get to the top. You could pick up sticks on the\r\nway back, if any are left. We'll have to fumigate this tree hole before\r\nwe adopt it for a residence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will it be long before you finish with your--with the bodies?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, look here, Miss Jenny; it's going to be a mess, and I\r\nwouldn't mind hauling the carcasses clear down the gully, out of sight,\r\nif it was to be the only time. But it's not, and you've got to get\r\nused to it, sooner or later. So we'll start now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, if I must, Mr. Blake-- Really, I wish to help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good. That's something like! Think you can learn to cook?\"\r\n\r\n\"See what I did this morning.\"\r\n\r\nBlake took the cord of cocoanut fibre which she held out to him, and\r\ntested its strength.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be--blessed!\" he said. \"This _is_ something like. If\r\nyou don't look out, you'll make quite a camp-mate, Miss Jenny. But\r\nnow, trot along. This is hardly arctic weather, and our abattoir don't\r\ninclude a cold-storage plant. The sooner these lambs are dressed, the\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS IN WOODCRAFT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was no pleasant sight that met Miss Leslie's gaze upon her return.\r\nThe neatest of butchering can hardly be termed aesthetic; and Blake\r\nand Winthrope lacked both skill and tools. Between the penknife and an\r\nimprovised blade of bamboo, they had flayed the two cubs and haggled\r\noff the flesh. The ragged strips, spitted on bamboo rods, were already\r\nsearing in the fierce sun-rays.\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie would have slipped into the hollow of the baobab with her\r\narmful of fagots and brush; but Blake waved a bloody knife above the body\r\nof the mother leopard, and beckoned the girl to come nearer.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on a minute, please,\" he said. \"What did you find out?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie drew a few steps nearer, and forced herself to look at the\r\nrevolting sight. She found it still more difficult to withstand the\r\nodor of the fresh blood. Winthrope was pale and nauseated. The sight of\r\nhis distress caused the girl to forget her own loathing. She drew a\r\ndeep breath, and succeeded in countering Blake's expectant look with a\r\nhalf-smile.\r\n\r\n\"How well you are getting along!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't think you could stand it. But you've got grit all right, if\r\nyou _are_ a lady,\" Blake said admiringly. \"Say, you'll make it yet!\r\nNow, how about the gully?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no place to climb up. It runs along like this, and then slopes\r\ndown. But there is a cliff at the end, as high as these walls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty feet,\" muttered Blake. \"Confound the luck! It isn't that\r\njump-off; but how in--how are we going to get up on the cliff? There's\r\nan everlasting lot of omelettes in those birds' nests. If only that\r\nbloomin'--how's that, Win, me b'y?--that bloomin', blawsted baobab\r\nwas on t' other side. The wood's almost soft as punk. We could drive in\r\npegs, and climb up the trunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are other trees beyond it,\" remarked Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Then maybe we can shin up--\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear the branches that overhang the cliff are too slender to bear any\r\nweight.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it's too infernally high to climb up to this overhanging baobab\r\nlimb.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" ventured Winthrope, \"if we had a axe, now, we might cut up\r\none of the trees, and make a ladder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; and if we had a ladder, we might climb up the cliff!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Blake, is there not some way to cut down one of the trees? The\r\ntree itself would be a ladder if it fell in such a way as to lean against\r\nthe cliff.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's only the penknife,\" answered Blake. \"So I guess we'll\r\nhave to scratch eggs off our menu card. Spring leopard for ours! Now, if\r\nyou really want to help, you might scrape the soup bones out of your\r\nboudoir, and fetch a lot more brush. It'll take a big fire to rid the\r\nhole of that cat smell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will not the tree burn?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; these hollow baobabs have green bark on the inside as well as out.\r\nFunny thing, that! We'd have to keep a fire going a long time to burn\r\nthrough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet it would burn in time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but we're not going to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why not burn through the trunk of one of those small trees,\r\ninstead of chopping it down?\"\r\n\r\n\"By--heck, Miss Jenny, you've got an American headpiece! Come on.\r\nSooner we get the thing started, the better.\"\r\n\r\nNeither Winthrope nor Miss Leslie was reluctant to leave the vicinity\r\nof the carcasses. They followed close after Blake, around the monstrous\r\nbole of the baobab. A little beyond it stood a group of slender trees,\r\nwhose trunks averaged eight inches thick at the base. Blake stopped at\r\nthe second one, which grew nearest to the seaward side of the cleft.\r\n\r\n\"Here's our ladder,\" he said. \"Get some firewood. Pound the bushes,\r\nthough, before you go poking into them. May be snakes here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Snakes?--oh!\" cried Miss Leslie, and she stood shuddering at the\r\ndanger she had already incurred.\r\n\r\nThe fire had burnt itself out on a bare ledge of rock between them and\r\nthe baobab, and the clumps of dry brush left standing in this end of the\r\ncleft were very suggestive of snakes, now that Blake had called attention\r\nto the possibility of their presence.\r\n\r\nHe laughed at his hesitating companions. \"Go on, go on! Don't squeal\r\ntill you're bit. Most snakes hike out, if you give them half a chance.\r\nTake a stick, each of you, and pound the bushes.\"\r\n\r\nThus urged, both started to work. But neither ventured into the thicker\r\nclumps. When they returned, with large armfuls of sticks and twigs, they\r\nfound that Blake had used his glass to light a handful of dry bark,\r\nout in the sun, and was nursing it into a small fire at the base of the\r\ntree, on the side next the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Miss Jenny,\" he directed, \"you're to keep this going--not too\r\nbig a fire--understand? Same time you can keep on fetching brush to\r\nfumigate your cat hole. It needs it, all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will not that be rather too much for Miss Leslie?\" asked Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if she'd rather come and rub brains on the skins,--Indian tan,\r\nyou know,--or--\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you mention such things before a lady?\" protested Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Beg your pardon, Miss Leslie! you see, I'm not much used to ladies'\r\ncompany. Anyway, you've got to see and hear about these things. And\r\nnow I'll have to get the strings for Win's bamboo bows. Come on, Win.\r\nWe've got that old tabby to peel, and a lot more besides.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie's first impulse was to protest against being left alone,\r\nwhen at any moment some awful venomous serpent might come darting at\r\nher out of the brush or the crevices in the rocks. But her half-parted\r\nlips drew firmly together, and after a moment's hesitancy, she forced\r\nherself to the task which had been assigned her. The fire, once started,\r\nrequired little attention. She could give most of her time to gathering\r\nbrush for the fumigation of the leopard den.\r\n\r\nShe had collected quite a heap of fuel at the entrance of the hollow,\r\nwhen she remembered that the place would first have to be cleared of its\r\naccumulation of bones. A glance at her companions showed that they were\r\nin the midst of tasks even more revolting. It was certainly disagreeable\r\nto do such things; yet, as Mr. Blake had said, others had to do them. It\r\nwas now her time to learn. She could see him smile at her hesitation.\r\n\r\nStung by the thought of his half contemptuous pity, she caught up a\r\nforked stick, and forced herself to enter the tree-cave. The stench met\r\nher like a blow. It nauseated and all but overpowered her. She stood\r\nfor several moments in the centre of the cavity, sick and faint. Had it\r\nbeen even the previous day, she would have run out into the open air.\r\n\r\nPresently she grew a little more accustomed to the stench, and began to\r\nrake over the soft dry mould of the den floor with her forked stick.\r\nBones!--who had ever dreamed of such a mess of bones?--big bones and\r\nlittle bones and skulls; old bones, dry and almost buried; mouldy bones;\r\nbones still half-covered with bits of flesh and gristle--the remnants\r\nof the leopard family's last meal.\r\n\r\nAt last all were scraped out and flung in a heap, three or four yards\r\naway from the entrance. Miss Leslie looked at the result of her labor\r\nwith a satisfied glance, followed by a sigh of relief. Between the heat\r\nand her unwonted exercise, she was greatly fatigued. She stepped around\r\nto a shadier spot to rest.\r\n\r\nWith a start, she remembered the fire.\r\n\r\nWhen she reached it there were only a few dying embers left. She gathered\r\ndead leaves and shreds of fibrous inner bark, and knelt beside the\r\ndull coals to blow them into life. She could not bear the thought of\r\nhaving to confess her carelessness to Blake.\r\n\r\nThe hot ashes flew up in her face and powdered her hair with their gray\r\ndust; yet she persisted, blowing steadily until a shred of bark caught\r\nthe sparks and flared up in a tiny flame. A little more, and she had a\r\nstrong fire blazing against the tree trunk.\r\n\r\nShe rested a short time, relaxing both mentally and physically in the\r\nsatisfying consciousness that Blake never should know how near she had\r\ncome to failing in her trust.\r\n\r\nSoon she became aware of a keen feeling of thirst and hunger. She rose,\r\npiled a fresh supply of sticks on the fire, and hastened back through\r\nthe cleft towards the spring. Around the baobab she came upon Winthrope,\r\nworking in the shade of the great tree. The three leopard skins had been\r\nstretched upon bamboo frames, and he was resignedly scraping at their\r\ninner surfaces with a smooth-edged stone. Miss Leslie did not look too\r\nclosely at the operation.\r\n\r\n\"Where is--he?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nWinthrope motioned down the cleft.\r\n\r\n\"I hope he hasn't gone far. I'm half famished. Aren't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Miss Genevieve, it is odd, you know. Not an hour since, the\r\nvery thought of food--\"\r\n\r\n\"And now you're as hungry as I am. Oh, I do wish he had not gone off\r\njust at the wrong time!\"\r\n\r\n\"He went to take a dip in the sea. You know, he got so messed up over\r\nthe nastiest part of the work, which I positively refused to do--\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that beyond the bamboos?--There's something alive!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, don't be alarmed. It is--er--it's all right, Miss Genevieve, I\r\nassure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is it? Such queer noises, and I see something alive!\"\r\n\r\n\"Only the vultures, if you must know. Nothing else, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is all out of sight from the spring. You are not to go around the\r\nbamboos until the--that is, not to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Mr. Blake say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes--to be sure. He also said to tell you that the cutlets were\r\non the top shelf.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean --?\"\r\n\r\n\"His way of ordering you to cook our dinner. Really, Miss Genevieve,\r\nI should be pleased to take your place, but I have been told to keep\r\nto this. It is hard to take orders from a low fellow,--very hard for\r\na gentleman, you know.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie gazed at her shapely hands. Three days since she could not\r\nhave conceived of their being so rough and scratched and dirty. Yet her\r\ndisgust at their condition was not entirely unqualified.\r\n\r\n\"At least I have something to show for them,\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"I beg pardon,\" said Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Just look at my hands--like a servant's! And yet I am not nearly so\r\nashamed of them as I would have fancied. It is very amusing, but do you\r\nknow, I actually feel proud that I have done something--something useful,\r\nI mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Useful?--I call it shocking, Miss Genevieve. It is simply vile that\r\npeople of our breeding should be compelled to do such menial work. They\r\nwrite no end of romances about castaways; but I fail to see the romance\r\nin scraping skins Indian fashion, as this fellow Blake calls it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, though, we should remember how much Mr. Blake is doing for\r\nus, and should try to make the best of the situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has no best. It is all a beastly muddle,\" complained Winthrope,\r\nand he resumed his nervous scraping at the big leopard skin.\r\n\r\nThe girl studied his face for a moment, and turned away. She had been\r\ntrying so hard to forget.\r\n\r\nHe heard her leave, and called after, without looking up: \"Please\r\nremember. He said to cook some meat.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. Having satisfied her thirst at the spring, she took\r\none of the bamboo rods, with its haggled blackening pieces of flesh, and\r\nreturned to the fire. After some little experimenting, she contrived\r\na way to support the rod beside the fire so that all the meat would\r\nroast without burning.\r\n\r\nAt first, keen as was her hunger, she turned with disgust from the\r\nflabby sun-seared flesh; but as it began to roast, the odor restored her\r\nappetite to full vigor. Her mouth fairly watered. It seemed as though\r\nWinthrope and Blake would never come. She heard their voices, and took\r\nthe bamboo spit from the fire for the meat to cool. Still they failed to\r\nappear, and unable to wait longer, she began to eat. The cub meat proved\r\nfar more tender than that of the old leopard. She had helped herself to\r\nthe second piece before the two men appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on, Miss Jenny; fair play!\" sang out Blake. \"You've set to\r\nwithout tooting the dinner-horn. I don't blame you, though. That smells\r\nmighty good.\"\r\n\r\nBoth men caught at the hot meat with eagerness, and Winthrope promptly\r\nforgot all else in the animal pleasure of satisfying his hunger. Blake,\r\nthough no less hungry, only waited to fill his mouth before investigating\r\nthe condition of the prospective tree ladder. The result of the attempt\r\nto burn the trunk did not seem encouraging to the others, and Miss\r\nLeslie looked away, that her face might not betray her, should he have\r\nan inkling of her neglect. She was relieved by the cheerfulness of his\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"Slow work, this fire business--eh? Guess, though, it'll go faster this\r\nafternoon. The green wood is killed and is getting dried out. Anyway,\r\nwe've got to keep at it till the tree goes over. This spring leopard\r\nwon't last long at the present rate of consumption, and we'll need\r\nthe eggs to keep us going till we get the hang of our bows.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is that smoke back there?\" interrupted Miss Leslie. \"Can it be\r\nthat the fire down the cleft has sprung up again?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it's your fumigation. You had plenty of brush on hand, so I heaved\r\nit into the hole, and touched it off. While it's burning out, you can\r\nput in time gathering grass and leaves for a bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would you and Mr. Winthrope mind breaking off some bamboos for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie colored and hesitated. \"I--I should like to divide off a\r\ncorner of the place with a wall or screen.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope tried to catch Blake's eye; but the American was gazing at\r\nMiss Leslie's embarrassed face with a puzzled look. Her meaning dawned\r\nupon him, and he hastened to reply.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Miss Jenny. You can build your wall to suit yourself. But\r\nthere'll be no hurry over it. Until the rains begin, Win and I'll\r\nsleep out in the open. We'll have to take turn about on watch at night,\r\nanyway. If we don't keep up a fire, some other spotted kitty will be\r\nsure to come nosing up the gully.\"\r\n\r\n\"There must also be lions in the vicinity,\" added Winthrope.\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie said nothing until after the last pieces of meat had been\r\nhanded around, and Blake sprang up to resume work.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blake,\" she called, in a low tone; \"one moment, please. Would it\r\nsave much bother if a door was made, and you and Mr. Winthrope should\r\nsleep inside?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see about that later,\" replied Blake, carelessly.\r\n\r\nThe girl bit her lip, and the tears started to her eyes. Even Winthrope\r\nhad started off without expressing his appreciation. Yet he at least\r\nshould have realized how much it had cost her to make such an offer.\r\n\r\nBy evening she had her tree-cave--house, she preferred to name it to\r\nherself--in a habitable condition. When the purifying fire had burnt\r\nitself out, leaving the place free from all odors other than the\r\nwholesome smell of wood smoke, she had asked Blake how she could rake out\r\nthe ashes. His advice was to wet them down where they lay.\r\n\r\nThis was easier said than done. Fortunately, the spring was only a few\r\nyards distant, and after many trips, with her palm-leaf hat for bowl,\r\nthe girl carried enough water to sprinkle all the powdery ashes. Over\r\nthem she strewed the leaves and grass which she had gathered while the\r\nfire was burning. The driest of the grass, arranged in a far corner,\r\npromised a more comfortable bed than had been her lot for the last three\r\nnights.\r\n\r\nDuring this work she had been careful not to forget the fire at the\r\ntree. Yet when, near sundown, she called the others to the third meal\r\nof leopard meat, Blake grumbled at the tree for being what he termed\r\nsuch a confounded tough proposition.\r\n\r\n\"Good thing there's lots of wood here, Win,\" he added. \"We'll keep\r\nthis fire going till the blamed thing topples over, if it takes a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but you surely will not stay so far from the baobab to-night!\"\r\nexclaimed Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Hold hard!\" soothed Blake. \"You've no license to get the jumps yet\r\na while. We'll have another fire by the baobab. So you needn't worry.\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes later they went back to the baobab, and Winthrope began\r\nhelping Miss Leslie to construct a bamboo screen in the narrow entrance\r\nof the tree-cave, while Blake built the second fire.\r\n\r\nAs Winthrope was unable to tell time by the stars, Blake took the first\r\nwatch. At sunset, following the engineer's advice, Winthrope lay down\r\nwith his feet to the small watch-fire, and was asleep before twilight\r\nhad deepened into night. Fagged out by the mental and bodily stress of\r\nthe day, he slept so soundly that it seemed to him he had hardly lost\r\nconsciousness when he was roused by a rough hand on his forehead.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" he mumbled.\r\n\r\n\"'Bout one o'clock,\" said Blake. \"Wake up! I ran overtime, 'cause\r\nthe morning watch is the toughest. But I can't keep 'wake any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, this is a beastly bore,\" remarked Winthrope, sitting up.\r\n\r\n\"Um-m,\" grunted Blake, who was already on his back.\r\n\r\nWinthrope rubbed his eyes, rose wearily, and drew a blazing stick from\r\nthe fire. With this upraised as a torch, he peered around into the\r\ndarkness, and advanced towards the spring.\r\n\r\nWhen, having satisfied his thirst, he returned somewhat hurriedly to the\r\nfire, he was startled by the sight of a pale face gazing at him from\r\nbetween the leaves of the bamboo screen.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Miss Genevieve, what is the matter?\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Hush! Is he asleep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a top.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank Heaven! . . . . Good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night--er--I say, Miss Genevieve--\"\r\n\r\nBut the girl disappeared, and Winthrope, after a glance at Blake's\r\nplacid face, hurried along the cleft to stack the other fire. When he\r\nreturned he noticed two bamboo rods which Blake had begun to shape into\r\nbow staves. He looked them over, with a sneer at Blake's seemingly\r\nunskilful workmanship; but he made no attempt to finish the bows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA DESPOILED WARDROBE\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after sunrise Miss Leslie was awakened by the snap and dull crash of\r\na falling tree. She made a hasty toilet, and ran out around the baobab.\r\nThe burned tree, eaten half through by the fire, had been pushed over\r\nagainst the cliff by Blake and Winthrope. Both had already climbed up,\r\nand now stood on the edge of the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Miss Jenny!\" shouted Blake. \"We've got here at last. Want\r\nto come up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now, thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's easy enough. But you're right. Try your hand again at the\r\ncutlets, won't you? While they're frying, we'll get some eggs for\r\ndessert How does that strike you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no way to cook them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Roast 'em in the ashes. So long!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie cooked breakfast over the watch-fire, for the other had\r\nbeen scattered and stamped out by the men when the tree fell. They came\r\nback in good time, walking carefully, that they might not break the\r\neggs with which their pockets bulged. Between them, they had brought\r\na round dozen and a half. Blake promptly began stowing all in the hot\r\nashes, while Winthrope related their little adventure with unwonted\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"You should have come with us, Miss Genevieve,\" he began. \"This time\r\nof day it is glorious on the cliff top. Though the rock is bare, there\r\nis a fine view--\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine view of grub near the end,\" interpolated Blake.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes; the birds--you must take a look at them, Miss Genevieve! The\r\nsea end of the cliff is alive with them--hundreds and thousands, all\r\nhuddled together and fighting for room. They are a sight, I assure you!\r\nThey're plucky, too. It was well we took sticks with us. As it was,\r\none of the gannets--boobies, Blake calls them--caught me a nasty nip\r\nwhen I went to lift her off the nest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Best way is to kick them off,\" explained Blake. \"But the point\r\nis that we've hopped over the starvation stile. Understand? The\r\nwhole blessed cliff end is an omelette waiting for our pan. Pass the\r\nleopardettes, Miss Jenny.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the last bit of meat had disappeared, Blake raked the eggs from the\r\nashes, and began to crack them, solemnly sniffing at each before he laid\r\nit on its leaf platter. Some were a trifle \"high.\" None, however, were\r\nthrown away.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over, Winthrope contemplated the scattered shells with\r\na satisfied air.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know,\" he remarked, \"this is the first time I have\r\nfelt--er--replenished since we found those cocoanuts.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about one of 'em now to top off on?\" questioned Blake.\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie sighed. \"Why did you speak of them! I am still hungry enough\r\nto eat more eggs--a dozen--that is, if we had a little salt and butter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a silver cup and napkins!\" added Blake. \"About the salt, though,\r\nwe'll have to get some before long, and some kind of vegetable food. It\r\nwon't do to keep up this whole meat menu.\"\r\n\r\n\"If only those little bamboo sprouts were as good as they look--like a\r\nkind of asparagus!\" murmured Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard that the Chinese eat them,\" said Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"They eat rats, too,\" commented Blake.\r\n\r\n\"We might at least try them,\" persisted Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"How? Raw?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard papa tell of roasting corn when he was a boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so; and roasting-ears are better than boiled. Win, I guess\r\nwe'll have a sample of bamboo asparagus _à la_ Les-lee!\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope took the penknife, and fetched a handful of young sprouts from\r\nthe bamboo thicket. They were heated over the coals on a grill of green\r\nbranches, and devoured half raw.\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" mumbled Blake, as he ruminated on the last shoot, \"we're\r\ngetting on some for this smell hole of a coast: house and chicken ranch,\r\nand vegetables in our front yard-- We've got old Bobbie Crusoe beat,\r\nhands down, on the start-off, and he with his shipful of stuff for\r\nhandicap!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you believe that the situation looks more hopeful, Mr. Blake?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we've at least got an extension on our note for a week or two.\r\nBut I'm not going to coddle you with a lot of lies, Miss Jenny. There's\r\nthe fever coming, sure as fate. I may stave it off a while; you and Win,\r\nten to one, will be down in a few days--and not a smell of quinine\r\nin our commissary. Then there'll be dysentery and snakes and wild\r\nbeasts--No; we're not out of the woods yet, not by a--considerable.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, Blake,\" muttered Winthrope, \"I must say, you're not very\r\nencouraging.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't say I was trying to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Blake, I am sure papa will offer a large reward when the\r\nsteamer is reported as lost. There will be ships searching for us--\"\r\n\r\n\"We're not in the British Channel, and I'll bet what few boats do\r\ncoast along here don't nose about much among these coral reefs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy it would do no harm to erect a signal,\" said Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Only thing that would make a show is Miss Leslie's skirt,\" replied\r\nBlake.\r\n\r\n\"There is the big leopard skin,\" persisted Winthrope. To his surprise\r\nthe engineer took the suggestion under serious consideration.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know,\" he said. \"If we had a water background, now.\r\nBut against the rock and trees,--no; what we want is white. I'll tell\r\nyou--when Miss Jenny sets to and makes herself a dress of that skin,\r\nI'll fly her skirt to the zephyrs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blake! I really think that is cruel of you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come now; that's not fair! I wouldn't have said a word, but you\r\nsaid you wanted to help.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Blake. I--I did not quite understand you. I\r\nreally do want to help--to do my share--\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you're talking! You see, it's not only a question of the signal,\r\nbut of clothes. We've got to figure anyway on needing new ones before\r\nlong. Look at my pants and vest, and Win's too. Inside a month we'll\r\nall be in hide--or in hiding. That's a joke, Win, me b'y; see?\"\r\n\r\n\"But in the meantime--\" began Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime we're like to miss a chance or two of being picked\r\nup, just because we've failed to stick out a signal that'd catch the\r\neye twice as far off as any other color than scarlet. Do you suppose I\r\nworked my way up from axeman to engineer, and didn't learn anything\r\nabout flags?\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is all really too absurd! I do not know the first thing about\r\nsewing, and I have neither thread nor needle.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's up to you, though, if you want to help. My sisters sewed mighty\r\nsoon after they learned to toddle. 'Bout time you learned-- There, now;\r\nI didn't mean to hurt your feelings. You've made a fair stagger at\r\ncooking, and I bet you win out on the dressmaking. For needle you can use\r\none of these long slim thorns--poke a hole, and then slip the thread\r\nthrough, like a shoemaker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes; but the thread?\" put in Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"The cocoanut fibre would hardly do,\" said Miss Leslie, forgetting to\r\ndry her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"No. We could get fairly good fibres out of the palm leaves; but catgut\r\nwill be a whole lot better. I'll slit up a lot for you, fine enough\r\nto sew with. And now, let's get down to tacks. No offence--but did\r\neither of you ever learn to do anything useful in all your blessed\r\nlittle lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Blake, of course I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course what?\" demanded Blake, as Miss Leslie hesitated. \"We know\r\nall about your cooking and sewing. What else?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I see what you meant. I fear that nothing of what I learned would\r\nbe of service now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boarding-school rot, eh? And you, Winthrope?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you would kindly name over what you have in mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Um!\" grunted Blake. \"Well, it's first of all a question of a\r\npractical--practical, mind you,--knowledge of metallurgy, ceramics, and\r\nhow to stick an arrow through a beef roast.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--ah--I believe I intimated that I have some knowledge of archery. But\r\nI doubt--\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut it out! You'll have enough else to do. Get busy over those bows\r\nand arrows, and don't quit till you've got them in shape. Leave my bow\r\ngood and stiff. I can pull like a mule can kick. Well, Miss Jenny; what\r\nis it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is not--has not ceramics something to do with burning china?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure!--china, pottery, and all that. Know anything about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I have a friend who amuses herself by painting china, and I know\r\nit has to be burned.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's all!\" grunted Blake. \"Well, let me tell you. When I was\r\na little kid I used to work in a pottery. All I can remember is that\r\nthey'd take clay, shape it into a pot, dry it, and bake the thing in a\r\nkiln. We've got to work the same game somehow. This kind of eating will\r\nmean dysentery in short order. So there's going to be a bean-pot for\r\nour stews, or Tom Blake'll know the reason why. Nurse up that ankle of\r\nyours, Win. We'll trek it to-morrow--cocoanuts, and maybe something\r\nelse. There's clay on the far bank of the river, and across from it I\r\nsaw a streak that looked like brown hæmatite.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next four days slipped by almost unheeded. Blake saw to it that\r\nnot only himself but his companions had work to occupy every hour of\r\ndaylight. When not engaged in cooking and fuel gathering, Miss Leslie\r\nwas learning by painful experience the rudiments of dressmaking.\r\n\r\nAt the start she had all but ruined the beautiful skin of the mother\r\nleopard before Blake chanced to see her and took over the task of cutting\r\nit into shape for a skirt. But when it came to making a waist of the\r\ncub fur, he said that she would have to puzzle out the pattern from\r\nher other one. Between cooking three meals a day over an open fire,\r\ngathering several armfuls of wood, and making a dress with penknife,\r\nthorn, and catgut, the girl had little time to think of other matters\r\nthan her work.\r\n\r\nWinthrope had been gazetted as hunter in ordinary. His task was to\r\nkeep Miss Leslie supplied with fresh eggs and each day to kill as many\r\nof the boobies and cormorants as he could skin and split for drying.\r\nBlake had changed his mind about taking him when he went for cocoanuts.\r\nInstead, he had gone alone on several trips, bringing three or four loads\r\nof nuts, then a little salt from the seashore, dirty but very welcome,\r\nand last of all a great lump of clay, wrapped in palm fronds.\r\n\r\nWith this clay he at once began experiments in the art of pottery. Having\r\nmixed and beaten a small quantity, he moulded it into little cups and\r\nbowls, and tried burning them over night in the watch-fire. A few came\r\nout without crack or flaw. Vastly elated by this success, he fashioned\r\nlarger vessels from his clay, and within the week could brag of two pots\r\nsuitable for cooking stews, and four large nondescript pieces which he\r\ncalled plates. What was more, all had a fairly good sand glaze, for he\r\nhad been quick to observe a glaze on the bottoms of the first pots, and\r\nhad reasoned out that it was due to the sand which had adhered while\r\nthey stood drying in the sun.\r\n\r\nHe next turned his attention to metallurgy. The first move was to search\r\nthe river bank for the brown bog iron ore which he believed he had seen\r\nfrom the farther side. After a dangerous and exhausting day's work in\r\nthe mire and jungle, he came back with nothing more to show for his pains\r\nthan an armful of creepers. Late in the afternoon, he had located the\r\nhæmatite, only to find it lying in a streak so thin that he could not\r\nhope to collect enough for practical purposes.\r\n\r\n\"Lucky we've got something to fall back on,\" he added, after telling\r\nof his failure. \"Pass over those keys of yours, Win. Good! Now untangle\r\nthose creepers. To-night we'll take turns knotting them up into some\r\nsort of a rope-ladder. I'm getting mighty weary of hoofing it all around\r\nthe point every time I trot to the river. After this I'll go down\r\nthe cliff at that end of the gully.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope, who had become very irritable and depressed during the last\r\ntwo days, turned on his heel, with the look of a fretful child.\r\n\r\nTo cover this undiplomatic rudeness, Miss Leslie spoke somewhat\r\nhurriedly. \"But why should you return again to the river, Mr. Blake?\r\nI'm sure you are risking the fever; and there must be savage beasts in\r\nthe jungle.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my business,\" growled Blake. He paused a moment, and added,\r\nrather less ungraciously, \"Well, if you care, it's this way--I'm\r\ngoing to keep on looking for ore. Give me a little iron ore, and we'll\r\nmighty soon have a lot of steel knives and arrow-heads that'll amount to\r\nsomething. How're we going to bag anything worth while with bamboo\r\ntips on our arrows? Those boar tusks are a fizzle.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you will continue to risk your life for us? I think that is very\r\nbrave and generous, Mr. Blake!\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\" demanded Blake, not a little puzzled. He was fully\r\nconscious of the risk; but this was the first intimation he had received\r\nor conceived that his motives were other than selfish--\"Um-m! So that's\r\nthe ticket. Getting generous, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not getting--you _are_ generous! When I think of all you have done for\r\nus! Had it not been for you, I am sure we should have died that first day\r\nashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't blame me. I couldn't have let a dog die that way; and\r\nthen, a fellow needs a Man Friday for this sort of thing. As for you, I\r\nhaven't always had the luck to be favored with ladies' company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Blake. I quite appreciate the compliment. But now, I\r\nmust put on supper.\"\r\n\r\nBlake followed her graceful movements with an intentness which, in\r\nturn, drew Winthrope's attention to himself. The Englishman smiled\r\nin a disagreeable manner, and resumed his work on the bows, with the\r\nlook of one mentally preoccupied. After supper he found occasion to\r\nspend some little time among the bamboos.\r\n\r\nWhen at sunset Miss Leslie withdrew into the baobab, Winthrope somewhat\r\nofficiously insisted upon helping her set up her screen in the entrance.\r\nAs he did so, he took the opportunity to hand her a bamboo knife, and\r\nto draw her attention to several double-pointed bamboo stakes which he\r\nhad hidden under the litter.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" she asked, troubled by his furtive glance back at Blake.\r\n\r\n\"Merely precaution, you know,\" he whispered. \"The ground in there is\r\nquite soft. It will be no trouble, I fancy, to put up the stakes, with\r\ntheir points inclined towards the entrance.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so loud, Miss Genevieve! It struck me that if any one should seek\r\nto enter in the night, he would find these stakes deucedly unpleasant.\r\nBe careful how you handle them. As you see, the sharper points, which\r\nare to be set uppermost, run off into a razor edge. Put them up now,\r\nbefore it grows too dark. You know how ninepins are set--that shape.\r\nGood-night! You see, with these to guard the entrance, you need not be\r\nafraid to go to sleep at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she whispered, and began to thrust the stakes into the\r\nground as he had directed.\r\n\r\nHe had not been mistaken. The vague doubts and fears which she already\r\nentertained would have kept her awake throughout the night, but thanks\r\nto the sense of security afforded by the sword-bayonets of her silent\r\nlittle sentries, the girl was soon able to calm herself, and was fast\r\nasleep long before Blake wakened Winthrope.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast, Blake--who had spent his watch in grinding\r\nthe edges from a stone and experimenting with split and bent twigs--put\r\nWinthrope's keys in the fire, and began an attempt to shape them into\r\na knife-blade. To heat the steel to the required temperature, he used\r\na bamboo blowpipe, with his lungs for bellows.\r\n\r\nWinthrope turned away with an indifferent bearing; but Miss Leslie found\r\nherself compelled to stop and admire his dexterous use of his rude tools.\r\n\r\nOne after another, the keys were welded together, end to end, in a narrow\r\nribbon of steel. The thinnest one, however, was not fastened to the tip\r\nuntil it had been used to burn a groove in the edge of a rib, selected\r\nfrom among the bones which Miss Leslie had thrown out of the baobab.\r\nThe last key was then fastened to the others; the blade ground sharp,\r\ntempered, and inserted in the groove. Finally, pieces of the key-ring\r\nwere fitted in bands around the bone, through notches cut in the ends of\r\nthe steel blade. The result was a bone-handled, bone-backed knife, with a\r\nnarrow cutting edge of fine steel.\r\n\r\nLong before it was finished Miss Leslie had been forced away by the\r\nrequirements of her own work. In fact, Blake did not complete his task\r\nuntil late in the afternoon. At the end, he spent more than an hour\r\ngrinding the handle into shape. When he came to show the completed knife\r\nto Miss Leslie, he was fairly aglow with justifiable pride.\r\n\r\n\"How's that for an Eskimo job?\" he demanded. \"Bunch of keys and a\r\nbone, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are certainly very ingenious, Mr. Blake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nixy! There's little of the inventor in my top piece--only some hustle\r\nand a good memory. I was up in Alaska, you know. Saw a sight of Eskimo\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, it is very skilfully done.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be--Look out for the edge! It'd do to shave. No more bamboo\r\nsplinters for me--dull when you hit a piece of bone. I'm ready now to\r\nskin a rhinoceros.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you can catch one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess we could find enough of them around here, all right. But we'll\r\nstart in on some of Win's sheep and cattle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do! One grows tired of eggs, and all these sea-birds are so tough\r\nand fishy, no matter how I cook them.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll sneak down to the pool, and make a try with the bows this\r\nevening. I'll give odds, though, that we draw a blank. Win's got the\r\naim, but no drive; I've got the drive, but no aim. Even if I hit an\r\nantelope, I don't think a bamboo-pointed arrow would bother him much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't the savages kill game without iron weapons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure; but a lot have flint points, and a lot of others use poison. I\r\nknow that the Apaches and some of those other Southern Indians used to\r\nfix their arrows with rattlesnake poison.\"\r\n\r\n\"How horrible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that depends on how you look at it. I guess they thought guns\r\nmore horrible when they tackled the whites and got the daylight let\r\nthrough 'em. At any rate, they swapped arrows for rifles mighty quick,\r\nand any one who knows Apaches will tell you it wasn't because they\r\nthought bullets would do less damage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet the thought of poison--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but the thought of self-preservation! Sooner than starve, I'd\r\npoison every animal in Africa--and so would you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I--You put it in such a horrible way. One must consider others,\r\nanimals as well as people; and yet--\"\r\n\r\n\"Survival of the fittest. I've read some things, and I'm no fool,\r\nif I do say it myself. For instance, I'm the boss here, because I'm the\r\nfittest of our crowd in this environment; but back in what's called\r\ncivilized parts, where the law lets a few shrewd fellows monopolize the\r\nmeans of production, a man like your father--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blake, it is not my fault if papa's position in the business\r\nworld--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor his, either--it's the cussed system! No; that's all right, Miss\r\nJenny. I was only illustrating. Now, I take it, both you and Win would\r\nlike to get rid of a boss like me, if you could get rid of Africa at the\r\nsame time. As it is, though, I guess you'd rather have me for boss,\r\nand live, than be left all by your lonesomes, to starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I'm sure there is no question of your leadership, Mr. Blake. We\r\nhave both tried our best to do what you have asked of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_ have, at least. But I know. If a ship should come to-morrow,\r\nit'd be Blake to the back seat. 'Papa, give this--er--person a check\r\nfor his services, while I chase off with Winnie, to get my look-in on\r\n'Is Ri-yal 'Igh-ness.'\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie flushed crimson-- \"I'm sure, Mr. Blake--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't let that worry you, Miss Jenny. It don't me. I couldn't\r\nbe sore with you if I tried. Just the same, I know what it'll be like.\r\nI've rubbed elbows enough with snobs and big bugs to know what kind of\r\nconsideration they give one of the mahsses--unless one of the mahsses\r\nhas the drop on them. Hello, Win! What's kept you so late?\"\r\n\r\n\"None of your business!\" snapped Winthrope.\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie glanced at him, even more puzzled and startled by this\r\noutbreak than she had been by Blake's strange talk. But if Blake was\r\nangered, he did not show it.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Win,\" he remarked gravely, \"I was going to take you down to the\r\npool after supper, on a try with the bows. But I guess you'd better stay\r\nclose by the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it is time you gave a little consideration to those who deserve\r\nit,\" rejoined Winthrope, with a peevishness of tone and manner which\r\nsurprised Miss Leslie. \"I tell you, I'm tired of being treated like a\r\ndog.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, all right, old man. Just draw up your chair, and get all\r\nthe hot broth aboard you can stow,\" answered Blake, soothingly.\r\n\r\nWinthrope sat down; but throughout the meal, he continued to complain\r\nover trifles with the peevishness of a spoiled child, until Miss Leslie\r\nblushed for him. Greatly to her astonishment, Blake endured the nagging\r\nwithout a sign of irritation, and in the end took his bow and arrows and\r\nwent off down the cleft, with no more than a quiet reminder to Winthrope\r\nthat he should keep near the fire.\r\n\r\nWhen, shortly after dark, the engineer came groping his way back up the\r\ngorge, he was by no means so calm. Out of six shots, he had hit one\r\nantelope in the neck and another in the haunch; yet both animals had\r\nmade off all the swifter for their wounds.\r\n\r\nThe noise of his approach awakened Winthrope, who turned over, and began\r\nto complain in a whining falsetto. Miss Leslie, who was peering out\r\nthrough the bars of her screen, looked to see Blake kick the prostrate\r\nman. His frown showed only too clearly that he was in a savage temper. To\r\nher astonishment, he spoke in a soothing tone until Winthrope again\r\nfell asleep. Then he quietly set about erecting a canopy of bamboos\r\nover the sleeper.\r\n\r\nJust why he should build this was a puzzle to the girl. But when she\r\ncaught a glimpse of Blake's altered expression, she drew a deep breath\r\nof relief, and picked her way around the edge of her bamboo stakes, to\r\nlie down without a trace of the fear which had been haunting her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE MARK OF THE BEAST\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning found Winthrope more irritable and peevish than ever. Though\r\nhe had not been called on watch by Blake until long after midnight, he\r\nhad soon fallen asleep at his post and permitted the fire to die out.\r\nShortly before dawn, Blake was roused by a pack of jackals, snarling\r\nand quarrelling over the half-dried seafowl. To charge upon the thieves\r\nand put them to flight with a few blows of his club took but a moment.\r\nYet daylight showed more than half the drying frames empty.\r\n\r\nBlake was staring glumly at them, with his broad back to Winthrope, when\r\nMiss Leslie appeared. The sudden cessation of Winthrope's complaints\r\nbrought his companion around on the instant. The girl stood before him,\r\nclad from neck to foot in her leopard-skin dress.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be--dashed!\" he exclaimed, and he stood staring at her\r\nopen-mouthed.\r\n\r\n\"I fear it will be warm. Do you think it becoming?\" she asked,\r\nflushing, and turning as though to show the fit of the costume.\r\n\r\n\"Do I?\" he echoed. \"Miss Jenny, you're a peach!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" she said. \"And here is the skirt. I have ripped it open.\r\nYou see, it will make a fine flag.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it's put up. Seems a pity, though, to do that, when we're getting\r\non so fine. What do you say to leaving it down, and starting a little\r\ncolony of our own?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie raised the skirt in her outstretched hands. Behind it her\r\nface became white as the cloth.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" demanded Blake soberly, though his eyes were twinkling.\r\n\r\n\"You forget the fever,\" she retorted mockingly, and Blake failed to\r\ncatch the quaver beneath the light remark.\r\n\r\n\"Say, you've got me there!\" he admitted. \"Just pass over your flag,\r\nand scrape up some grub. I'll be breaking out a big bamboo. There are\r\nplenty of holes and loose stones on the cliff. We'll have the signal\r\nup before noon.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie murmured her thanks, and immediately set about the\r\npreparation of breakfast.\r\n\r\nWhen Blake had the bamboo ready, with one edge of the broad piece of\r\nwhite duck lashed to it with catgut as high up as the tapering staff\r\nwould bear, he called upon Winthrope to accompany him.\r\n\r\n\"You can go, too, Miss Jenny,\" he added. \"You haven't been on the\r\ncliff yet, and you ought to celebrate the occasion.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you,\" replied the girl. \"I'm still unprepared to climb\r\nprecipices, even though my costume is that of a savage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Savage? Great Scott! that leopard dress would win out against any set\r\nof Russian furs a-going, and I've heard they're considered all kinds\r\nof dog. Come on. I can swing you into the branches, and it's easy from\r\nthere up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse me, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you can go alone,\" interposed Winthrope. \"I am indisposed this\r\nmorning, and, what is more, I have had enough of your dictation.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have, have you?\" growled Blake, his patience suddenly come to an\r\nend. \"Well, let me tell you, Miss Leslie is a lady, and if she don't\r\nwant to go, that settles it. But as for you, you'll go, if I have to\r\nkick you every step.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope cringed back, and broke into a childish whine. \"Don't--don't\r\ndo it, Blake--Oh, I say, Miss Genevieve, how can you stand by and see\r\nhim abuse me like this?\"\r\n\r\nBlake was grinning as he turned to Miss Leslie. Her face was flushed and\r\ndowncast with humiliation for her friend. It seemed incredible that a man\r\nof his breeding should betray such weakness. A quick change came over\r\nBlake's face.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" he muttered, \"I guess I'm enough of a sport to know\r\nsomething about fair play. Win's coming down with the fever, and's\r\nno more to blame for doing the baby act than he'll be when he gets the\r\ndelirium, and gabbles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will thank you to attend to your own affairs,\" said Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"You're entirely welcome. It's what I'm doing.-- Do you understand,\r\nMiss Jenny?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, yes; and I wish to thank you. I have noticed how patient you\r\nhave been--\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Miss Leslie,\" rasped Winthrope. \"Can you not see that for\r\na fellow of this class to talk of fair play and patience is the height\r\nof impertinence? In England, now, such insufferable impudence--\"\r\n\r\n\"That'll do,\" broke in Blake. \"It's time for us to trot along.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Blake, if he is ill--\"\r\n\r\n\"Just the reason why he should keep moving. No more of your gab, Win!\r\nGive your jaw a lay-off, and try wiggling your legs instead.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope turned away, crimson with indignation. Blake paused only for\r\na parting word with Miss Leslie. \"If you want something to do, Miss\r\nJenny, try making yourself a pair of moccasins out of the scraps of skin.\r\nYou can't stay in this gully all the time. You've got to tramp around\r\nsome, and those slippers must be about done for.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are still serviceable. Yet if you think--\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll need good tough moccasins soon enough. Singe off the hair, and\r\nmake soles of the thicker pieces. If you do a fair job, maybe I'll\r\nemploy you as my cobbler, soon as I get the hide off one of those\r\nskittish antelope.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie nodded and smiled in response to his jesting tone. But as\r\nhe swung away after Winthrope, she stood for some time wondering at\r\nherself. A few days since she knew she would have taken Blake's remark\r\nas an insult. Now she was puzzled to find herself rather pleased that\r\nhe should so note her ability to be of service.\r\n\r\nWhen she roused herself, and began singeing the hair from the odds and\r\nends of leopard skin, she discovered a new sensation to add to her\r\nlist of unpleasant experiences. But she did not pause until the last\r\npatch of hair crisped close to the half-cured surface of the hide.\r\nFetching the penknife and her thorn and catgut from the baobab, she\r\ngathered the pieces of skin together, and walked along the cleft to\r\nthe ladder-tree. There had been time enough for Blake and Winthrope\r\nto set up the signal, and she was curious to see how it looked.\r\n\r\nShe paused at the foot of the tree, and gazed up to where the withered\r\ncrown lay crushed against the edge of the cliff. The height of the rocky\r\nwall made her hesitate; yet the men, in passing up and down, had so\r\ncleared away the twigs and leaves and broken the branches on the upper\r\nside of the trunk, that it offered a means of ascent far from difficult\r\neven for a young lady.\r\n\r\nThe one difficulty was to reach the lower branches. She could hardly\r\ntouch them with her finger-tips. But her barbaric costume must have\r\ninspired her. She listened for a moment, and hearing no sound to indicate\r\nthe return of the men, clasped the upper side of the trunk with her hands\r\nand knees, and made an energetic attempt to climb. The posture was\r\nfar from dignified, but the girl's eyes sparkled with satisfaction\r\nas she found herself slowly mounting.\r\n\r\nWhen, flushed and breathless, she gained a foothold among the branches,\r\nshe looked down at the ground, and permitted herself a merry little\r\ngiggle such as she had not indulged in since leaving boarding-school.\r\nShe had actually climbed a tree! She would show Mr. Blake that she was\r\nnot so helpless as he fancied.\r\n\r\nAt the thought, she clambered on up, finding that the branches made\r\nconvenient steps. She did not look back, and the screen of tree-tops\r\nbeneath saved her from any sense of giddiness. As her head came above\r\nthe level of the cliff, she peered through the foliage, and saw the\r\nsignal-flag far over near the end of the headland. The big piece of white\r\nduck stood out bravely against the blue sky, all the more conspicuous\r\nfor the flocks of frightened seafowl which wheeled above and around it.\r\n\r\nSurprised that she did not see the men, Miss Leslie started to draw\r\nherself up over the cliff edge. She heard Winthrope's voice a few yards\r\naway on her left. A sudden realization that the Englishman might consider\r\nher exploit ill-bred caused her to sink back out of sight.\r\n\r\nShe was hesitating whether to descend or to climb on up, when\r\nWinthrope's peevish whine was cut short by a loud and angry retort\r\nfrom Blake. Every word came to the girl's ears with the force of a blow.\r\n\r\n\"You do, do you? Well, I'd like to know where in hell you come in.\r\nShe's not your sister, nor your mother, nor your aunt, and if she's\r\nyour sweetheart, you've both been damned close-mouthed over it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an irritable, rasping murmur from Winthrope, and again came\r\nBlake's loud retort.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, young man, don't you forget you called me a cad once\r\nbefore. I can stand a good deal from a sick man; but I'll give it to you\r\nstraight, you'd better cut that out. Call me a brute or a savage, if\r\nthat'll let off your steam; but, understand, I'm none of your English\r\nkinds.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Winthrope spoke, this time in a fretful whine.\r\n\r\nBlake replied with less anger: \"That's so; and I'm going to show\r\nyou that I'm the real thing when it comes to being a sport. Give you\r\nmy word, I'll make no move till you're through the fever and on your\r\nlegs again. What I'll do then depends on my own sweet will, and don't\r\nyou forget it. I'm not after her fortune. It's the lady herself that\r\ntakes my fancy. Remember what I said to you when you called me a cad\r\nthe other time. You had your turn aboard ship. Now I can do as I please;\r\nand that's what I'm going to do, if I have to kick you over the cliff\r\nend first, to shut off your pesky interference.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl crouched back into the withered foliage, dazed with terror.\r\nAgain she heard Blake speak. He had dropped into a bitter sneer.\r\n\r\n\"No chance? It's no nerve, you mean. You could brain me, easy enough,\r\nany night--just walk up with a club when I'm asleep. Trouble is,\r\nyou're like most other under dogs--'fraid that if you licked your\r\nboss, there'd be no soup bones. So I guess I'm slated to stay boss of\r\nthis colony--grand Poo Bah and Mikado, all in one. Understand? You\r\nmind your own business, and don't go to interfering with me any more!\r\n. . . . Now, if you've stared enough at the lady's skirt--\"\r\n\r\nThe threat of discovery stung the girl to instant action. With almost\r\nfrantic haste, she scrambled down to the lower branches, and sprang to\r\nthe ground. She had never ventured such a leap even in childhood. She\r\nstruck lightly but without proper balance, and pitched over sideways.\r\nHer hands chanced to alight upon the remnants of leopard skin. Great\r\nas was her fear, she stopped to gather all together in the edge of her\r\nskirt before darting up the cleft.\r\n\r\nAt the baobab she turned and gazed back along the cliff edge. Before\r\nshe had time to draw a second breath, she caught a glimpse of Blake's\r\npalm-leaf hat, near the crown of the ladder tree.\r\n\r\n\"O-o-h!--he didn't see me!\" she murmured. Her frantic strength\r\nvanished, and a deathly sickness came upon her. She felt herself going,\r\nand sought to kneel to ease the fall.\r\n\r\nShe was roused from the swoon by Blake's resonant shout: \"Hey, Miss\r\nJenny! where are you? We've got your laundry on the pole in fine shape!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's flaccid limbs grew tense, and her body quivered with a\r\nshudder of dread and loathing. Yet she set her little white teeth, and\r\nforced herself to rise and go out to face the men. Both met her look\r\nwith a blank stare of consternation.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Miss Genevieve?\" cried Winthrope. \"You're white as\r\nchalk!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the fever!\" growled Blake. \"She's in the cold stage. Get a\r\npot on. We'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; it's not that! It's only--I've been frightened!\"\r\n\r\n\"Frightened?\"\r\n\r\n\"By a--a dreadful beast!\"\r\n\r\n\"Beast!\" repeated Blake, and his pale eyes flashed as he sprang across\r\nto where his bow and arrows and his club leaned against the baobab.\r\n\"I'll have no beasts nosing around my dooryard! Must be that skulking\r\nlion I heard last night. I'll show him!\" He caught up his weapons\r\nand stalked off down the cleft.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" exclaimed Winthrope; \"the man really must be mad. Call him\r\nback, Miss Genevieve. If anything should happen to him--\"\r\n\r\n\"If only there might!\" gasped the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nShe burst into a hysterical laugh. \"Oh! oh! it's such a joke--such a\r\njoke! At least he's not a hyena--oh, no; a brave beast! Hear him shout!\r\nAnd he actually thinks it's a lion! But it isn't--it's himself! Oh,\r\ndear! oh, dear! what shall I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Genevieve, what do you mean? Be calm, pray, be calm!\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm!--when I heard what he said? Yes; I heard every word! In the top\r\nof the tree--\"\r\n\r\n\"In the tree? Heavens! Miss--er--Miss Genevieve!\" stammered Winthrope,\r\nhis face paling. \"Did you--did you hear all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything--everything he said! What shall I do? I am so frightened!\r\nWhat shall I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything _he_ said?\" echoed Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"You spoke too low for me to hear; but I'm sure you faced him like a\r\ngentleman--I must believe it of you--\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope drew in a deep breath. \"Ah, yes; I did, Miss Genevieve--I\r\nassure you. The beast! Yet you see the plight I am in. It is a nasty\r\nmuddle--indeed it is! But what can I do? He is strong as a gorilla.\r\nReally, there is only one way--no doubt you heard him taunt me over\r\nit. I assure you I should not be afraid--but it would be so horrid--so\r\ncold-blooded. As a gentleman, you know--\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it is not that!\" broke in the girl. \"He is right. Neither of us\r\nhas the courage--even when he is asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Miss Genevieve, this beast instinct to kill--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but think of him. If he is a beast, he is at least a brave one.\r\nWhile we--we haven't the courage of rabbits. I thought you called\r\nyourself an English gentleman. Are you going to stand by, and not lift\r\na finger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, now, Miss Genevieve, to murder a man--\"\r\n\r\n\"Self-defence is not a crime--self-preservation. If you have a spark of\r\nmanhood--\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear--\"\r\n\r\n\"For Heaven's sake, if you can't do anything, at least keep still! Oh,\r\nI'm sure I shall go mad! If only I had been drowned!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, to be sure. But really now, what you ask is a good deal for a\r\nman to risk. The fellow might wake up and murder me! Should I take the\r\nrisk, might I--er--expect some manifestation of your gratitude, Miss\r\nGenevieve?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! of course! I should always--\"\r\n\r\n\"I--ah--refer to the--the--bestowal of your hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"My hand? I-- Would you bargain for my esteem? I thought you a\r\ngentleman!\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure--to be sure! Who says I am not? But all is fair in love\r\nand war, you know. Your choice is quite free. I take it, you will not\r\nconsider his--er--proposals. But if you do not wish my aid, you have\r\nanother way of escape--that is--at least other women have done it.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl gazed at him, her eyes dilating with horror as she realized his\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\n\"No, no; not that!\" she gasped. \"I want to live--I've a right to\r\nlive! Why, I'm only just twenty-two--I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" cautioned Winthrope. \"He's coming back. Be calm! There will\r\nbe time until I get over this vile malaria. It may be that he himself\r\nwill have the fever.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not have the fever,\" replied the girl, in a hopeless tone,\r\nand she leaned back listlessly against the baobab, as Blake swung himself\r\nup, frowning and sullen, and flung his weapons from him.\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" he grumbled, \"I told you that brute was a sneak. I've chased\r\nclean down to the pool and into the open, and not a smell of him. Must\r\nhave hiked off into the tall grass the minute he heard me.\"\r\n\r\n\"If only he had gone off for good!\" murmured Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he has; though you never can count on a sneak. Even you might\r\nbe able to shoo him off next time; but, like as not, he'd come along\r\nwhen we were all out calling, and clean out our commissary. Guess I'll\r\nset to and run up a barricade down there where the gully is narrowest.\r\nThere're shoals of dead thorn-brush to the right of the pool.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes; I fancy the vultures will be so vexed when they find your\r\nhedge in the way,\" remarked Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"My! how smart we're getting!\" retorted Blake. \"Don't worry,\r\nthough. We'll stow the stuff in Miss Jenny's boudoir, and I guess the\r\nbirdies'll be polite enough to keep out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must say, Blake, I do not see why you should wish to drag us away\r\nfrom here.\"\r\n\r\n\"There're lots of things you don't see, Win, me b'y--jokes, for\r\ninstance. But what could you expect?--you're English. Now, don't get\r\nmad. Worst thing in the world for malaria.\"\r\n\r\n\"One would fancy you could see that I am not angry. I've a splitting\r\nheadache, and my back hurts. I am ill.\"\r\n\r\nBlake looked him over critically, and nodded. \"That's no lie, old\r\nman. You're entitled to a hospital check all right. Miss Jenny, we'll\r\nappoint you chief nurse. Make him comfortable as you can, and give him\r\nhot broth whenever he'll take it. You can do your sewing on the side.\r\nWhenever you need help, call on me. I'm going to begin that barricade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nFEVER AND FIRE AND FEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nBy nightfall Winthrope was tossing and groaning on the bed of leaves\r\nwhich Miss Leslie had heaped beneath his canopy. Though not delirious,\r\nhis high temperature, coupled with the pains which racked every nerve and\r\nbone in his body, rendered him light-headed. He would catch himself up in\r\nthe midst of some rambling nonsense to inquire anxiously whether he had\r\nsaid anything silly or strange. On being reassured upon this, he would\r\nrelax again, and, as likely as not, break into a babyish wail over his\r\naches and pains.\r\n\r\nBlake shook his head when he learned that the attack had not been\r\npreceded by a chill.\r\n\r\n\"Guess he's in for a hot time,\" he said. \"There is more'n one kind\r\nof malarial fever. Some are a whole lot like typhus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Typhus? What is that?\" asked Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Sort of rapid fire, double action typhoid. Not that I think Win's got\r\nit--only malaria. What gets me is that we've only been here these few\r\ndays, and yet it looks like he's got the continuous, no-chill kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you think he will be very ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess he'll think so. It ought to run out in a week or ten\r\ndays, though. We've had good water, and it usually takes time for\r\nmalaria to soak in deep. Now, don't worry, Miss Jenny. It'll do him no\r\ngood, and you a lot of harm. Take things easy as you can, for you've\r\ngot to keep up your strength. If you don't, you'll be down yourself\r\nbefore Win is up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ill while he is helpless and unable--? Oh, no; that cannot be! I must\r\nnot give way to the fever until--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry. You'll likely stave it off for a couple of weeks or so.\r\nYou're lively yet, and that's a good sign. I knew Win was in for it\r\nwhen he began to grouch and loaf and do the baby act. I haven't much use\r\nfor dudes in general, and English dudes in particular; but I'll admit\r\nthat, while Win's soft enough in spots, he's not all mush and milk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Blake.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're welcome. I couldn't say less, seeing that Win can't speak for\r\nhimself. Now you tumble in and get a good sleep. I'll go on as night\r\nnurse, and work at the barricade same time. You're not going to do any\r\nnight-nursing. I can gather the thorn-brush in the afternoons, and pile\r\nit up at night.\"\r\n\r\nIn the morning Miss Leslie found that Blake had built a substantial\r\ncanopy over the invalid, in place of the first ramshackle structure.\r\n\r\n\"It's best for him to be out in the air,\" he explained; \"so I fixed\r\nthis up to keep off the dew. But whenever it rains, we'll have to tote\r\nhim inside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes; to be sure. How is he?\" murmured the girl.\r\n\r\n\"He's about the same this morning. But he got a little sleep. Keep him\r\ndosed with all the hot broth he'll take. And say, roust me out at noon.\r\nI've had my breakfast. Now I'll have a snooze. So long!\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded, and crawled under the shade of the nearest bush, too drowsy\r\nto observe her look of dismay.\r\n\r\nAt noon, having learned that Winthrope's condition showed little change,\r\nBlake ate a hearty meal, and at once set off down the cleft. He did not\r\nreappear until nightfall; though at intervals Miss Leslie had heard\r\nhis step as he came up the ravine with his loads of thorn-brush.\r\n\r\nThis course of action became the routine for the following ten days. It\r\nwas broken only by three incidents, all relating to the important matter\r\nof food supply. Winthrope had soon tired of broth, and showed such an\r\ninsatiable craving for cocoanut milk that the stock on hand had become\r\nexhausted within the week.\r\n\r\nThe day after, Blake took the rope ladder, as he called the tangle of\r\nknotted creepers, and went off towards the north end of the cleft. When\r\nhe returned, a little before dark, the lower part of his trousers was\r\ntorn to shreds, and the palms of his hands were blistered and raw; but he\r\ncarried a heavy load of cocoanuts. After a vain attempt to climb the\r\ngiant palms on the far side of the river, he had found another grove\r\nnear at hand, in the little plain, and had succeeded in reaching the tops\r\nof two of the smaller palms.\r\n\r\nUnder his directions, Miss Leslie clarified a bowl of bird\r\nfat--goose-grease, Blake called it,--and dressed his hands. Yet even\r\nwith the bandages which she made of soft inner bark and the\r\nhandkerchiefs, he was unable to handle the thorn-brush the following day.\r\nUnfortunately for him, he was not content to sit idle. During the night\r\nhe had cut a bamboo fishing-pole and lengthened Miss Leslie's line of\r\nplaited cocoanut-fibre with a long catgut leader. In the afternoon he\r\ncompleted his outfit with a hairpin hook and a piece of half-dried meat.\r\n\r\nHe was back an hour earlier than usual, and he brought with him a dozen\r\nor more fair-sized fish. His mouth was watering over the prospective\r\nfeast, and Miss Leslie showed herself hardly less eager for a change\r\nfrom their monotonous diet. As the fish were already dressed, she raked\r\nup the coals and quickly contrived a grill of green bamboos.\r\n\r\nWhen the odor of the broiling fish spread about in the still air, even\r\nWinthrope sniffed and turned over, while Blake watched the crisping\r\ndelicacies with a ravenous look. Unable to restrain himself, he caught\r\nup the smallest fish, half cooked, and bolted it down with such haste\r\nthat he burnt his mouth. He ran over to the spring for a drink, and\r\nWinthrope cackled derisively.\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie was too absorbed in her cooking to observe the result of\r\nBlake's greediness. She had turned the fish for the last time, and was\r\nabout to lift them off the fire, when Blake came running back, and sent\r\ngrill and all flying with a violent kick.\r\n\r\n\"Salt!\" he gasped--\"where's the salt? I'm poisoned!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poisoned?\"\r\n\r\n\"Poison fish! Don't eat! God!--Where's the salt?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl stared at him. His agony was so great that beads of sweat\r\nwere rolling down his face. He writhed, and stretched out a quivering\r\nhand--\"Salt, quick!--warm water--salt!\"\r\n\r\n\"But there's none left! You remember, yesterday--\"\r\n\r\n\"God!\" groaned Blake, and for a moment he sank down, overcome by a\r\nracking convulsion. Then his jaw closed like a bulldog's, and gritting\r\nhis teeth with the effort, he staggered up and rushed off down the cleft.\r\n\r\n\"Stop! stop, Mr. Blake! Where are you going?\" screamed the girl.\r\n\r\nShe started to run after him, but was halted by an outburst of delirious\r\nlaughter. Winthrope was sitting upright and waving his fever-blotched\r\nhands--\"Hi, hi! look at 'im run! 'E's got w'at'll do for 'im! Run,\r\nyou swine; you--\"\r\n\r\nThere followed a torrent of cockney abuse so foul that Miss Leslie\r\nblushed scarlet with shame as she sought to quiet him. But the excitement\r\nhad so heightened his fever that he was in a raving delirium. It was\r\nclose upon midnight before his temperature fell, and he sank into a\r\ndeath-like torpor. In her ignorance, she supposed that he had fallen\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nHer relief was short-lived, for soon she remembered Blake. She could\r\nsee him lying beside the pool or out on the bare plain, his resolute\r\neyes cold and glassy, his powerful body contorted in the death agony.\r\nThe vision filled her with dismay. With all his coarseness, the man had\r\nshowed himself so resourceful, so indomitable, that when she sought to\r\ndwell upon her reasons to fear him, she found herself admiring his virile\r\nmanliness. He might be a brute, but he did not belong among the jackals\r\nand hyenas. Indeed, as she called to mind his strong face and frank,\r\nblunt speech she all but disbelieved what her own ears had heard.\r\n\r\nAnd anyway, without his aid, what should she do? Winthrope had already\r\nbecome as weak as a child. The emaciation of his jaundiced features was a\r\nmockery of their former plumpness. Blake had said that the fever might\r\nrun on for another week, and that even if Winthrope recovered, he would\r\nprobably be helpless for several days besides.\r\n\r\nWhat was no less serious, though she had concealed the fact from Blake,\r\nshe herself had been troubled the past week with the depression and\r\nlassitude which had preceded Winthrope's attack. If Blake was dead,\r\nand she should fall ill before Winthrope recovered, they would both die\r\nfrom lack of care. And if they did not die of the fever, what of their\r\nfuture, here on this desolate savage coast!\r\n\r\nBut the very keenness of her mental anguish so exhausted and numbed the\r\ngirl's brain that she at last fell into a heavy sleep. The fire burned\r\nlow, and shadowy forms began to creep from behind the bamboos and the\r\ntrees and rocks down the gorge. There was no sound; but greedy, wolfish\r\neyes gleamed in the starlight.\r\n\r\nOnly the day before Blake had told Miss Leslie to store the last rack of\r\ncured meat inside the baobab. The two sleepers lay between the fire and\r\nthe entrance to the hollow. Slowly the embers of the fire died away\r\ninto gray ashes, and slowly the night prowlers drew nearer. The boldest\r\nof the pack crept close to Miss Leslie, and, with teeth bared and back\r\nbristling, sniffed at the edge of her skirt. Whether because of her\r\nheavy breathing or the odor of the leopard skin, the beast drew away,\r\nwith an uneasy whine.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause; then, backed by three others, the leader approached\r\nWinthrope. He was still lying in the death-like torpor, and he lacked\r\nthe protection which, in all likelihood, the leopard skin had given Miss\r\nLeslie. The cowardly brutes took him for dead or dying. They sniffed at\r\nhim from head to foot, and then, with a ferocious outburst of snarls and\r\nyells, flung themselves upon him.\r\n\r\nHad it not chanced that Winthrope was lying upon his side, with one arm\r\nthrown up, he would have been fatally wounded by the first slashing\r\nbites of his assailants. The two which sought to tear him were baffled\r\nby the thick folds of Blake's coat, while their leader's slash at the\r\nvictim's throat was barred by the upraised arm. With a savage snap,\r\nthe beast's jaws closed on the arm, biting through to the bone. At the\r\nsame instant the fourth jackal tore ravenously at one of the outstretched\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nWith a shriek of agony, Winthrope started up from his torpor, and struck\r\nout frantically in a fury of pain and terror. Startled by the violence\r\nof this unexpected resistance, the jackals leaped back--only to spring\r\nin again as the remainder of the pack made a rush to forestall them.\r\n\r\nWinthrope was staggering to his feet, when the foremost brute leaped\r\nupon him. He fell heavily against one of the main supports of his bamboo\r\ncanopy, and the entire structure came down with a crash. Two of the\r\njackals, caught beneath the roof, howled with fear as they sought to\r\nfree themselves. The others, with brute dread of an unknown danger,\r\ndrew away, snarling and gnashing their teeth.\r\n\r\nWakened by the first ferocious yelps of Winthrope's assailants, Miss\r\nLeslie had started up and stared about in the darkness. On all sides she\r\ncould see pairs of fiery eyes and dim forms like the phantom creatures\r\nof a nightmare. Winthrope's shriek, instead of spurring her to action,\r\nonly confused her the more and benumbed her faculties. She thought it\r\nwas his death cry, and stood trembling, transfixed with horror.\r\n\r\nThen came the fall of the canopy. His cries as he sought to throw it off\r\nshowed that he was still alive. In a flash her bewilderment vanished. The\r\nstagnant blood surged again through her arteries in a fiery, stimulating\r\ntorrent. With a cry, to which primeval instinct lent a menacing note,\r\nshe groped her way to the fallen canopy, and stooped to lift up one side.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!--into the tree!\" she called.\r\n\r\nStill frantic with terror, Winthrope struggled to his feet. She thrust\r\nhim towards the baobab, and followed, dragging the mass of interwoven\r\nbamboos. Emboldened by the retreat of their quarry, the snarling pack\r\ninstantly began to close in. Fortunately they were too cowardly to rush\r\nat once, and fear spurred their intended victims to the utmost haste.\r\nGroping and stumbling, the two felt their way to the baobab, and Miss\r\nLeslie pushed Winthrope headlong through the entrance. As he fell, she\r\nturned to face the pack.\r\n\r\nThe foremost beasts were at the rear edge of the bamboo framework, their\r\neyes close to the ground. Instinct told her that they were crouching to\r\nleap. With desperate strength she caught up the canopy before her like\r\na great shield, and drew it in after her until the ends of the cross-bars\r\nwere wedged fast against the sides of the opening. Though it seemed\r\nso firm, she clung to it with a convulsive grasp as she felt the pack\r\nleaders fling themselves against the outer side.\r\n\r\nBut Blake had lashed the bamboos securely together, and none of the\r\nbeasts was heavy enough to snap the supple bars. Finding that they could\r\nnot break down the barrier, they began to scratch and tear at the thatch\r\nwhich covered the frame. Soon a pair of lean jaws thrust in and snapped\r\nat the girl's skirt. She sprang back, with a cry: \"Help! Quick, Mr.\r\nWinthrope! They're breaking through!\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope made no response. She stooped, and found him lying inert where\r\nhe had fallen. She had only herself to depend upon. A screen of sharp\r\nsticks which she had made for the entrance was leaning against the inner\r\nwall, within easy reach. To grasp it and thrust it against the other\r\nframework was the work of an instant.\r\n\r\nStill she trembled, for the eager beasts had ripped the thatch from the\r\ncanopy, and their inthrust jaws made short work of the few leaves on her\r\nscreen. Unaware that even a lion or a tiger is quickly discouraged by\r\nthe knife-like splinters of broken bamboo, she expected every moment that\r\nthe jackals would bite their way through her frail barrier.\r\n\r\nShe remembered the stakes given her by Winthrope, hidden under the leaves\r\nand grass of her bed. She groped her way across the hollow, and uncovered\r\none of the stakes. In her haste she cut her hand on its razor-like edge.\r\nAll unheeding, she sprang back towards the entrance. She was none too\r\nsoon. One of the smaller jackals had forced its head and one leg between\r\nthe bars, and was struggling to enlarge the opening.\r\n\r\nFearful that the whole pack was about to burst in upon her, the girl\r\ngrasped the bamboo stake in both hands, and began stabbing and lunging\r\nat the beast with all her strength. The jackal squirmed and snarled and\r\nsnapped viciously. But the girl was now frantic. She pressed nearer,\r\nand though the white teeth grazed her wrist, she drove home a thrust\r\nthat changed the beast's snarls into a howl of pain. Before she could\r\nstrike again, it had struggled back out of the hole, beyond reach.\r\n\r\nTense and panting with excitement, she leaned forward, ready to stab at\r\nthe next beast. None appeared, and presently she became aware that the\r\npack had been daunted by the experience of their unlucky fellow. Their\r\nsnarls and yells had subsided to whines, which seemed to be coming from\r\na greater distance. Still she waited, with the bamboo stake upraised\r\nready to strike, every nerve and muscle of her body tense with the strain.\r\n\r\nSo great was the stress of her fear and excitement that she had not\r\nheeded the first gray lessening of the night. But now the glorious\r\ntropical dawn came streaming out of the east in all its red effulgence.\r\nAbove and through the bamboo barrier glowed a light such as might have\r\ncome from a great fire on the cliff top. Still tense and immovable, the\r\ngirl stared out up the cleft. There was not a jackal in sight. She\r\nleaned forward and peered around, unable to believe such good fortune.\r\nBut the night prowlers had slunk off in the first gray dawn.\r\n\r\nThe girl drew in a deep, shuddering sigh, and sank back. Her hand struck\r\nagainst Winthrope's foot. She turned about quickly and looked at him. He\r\nwas lying upon his face. She hastened to turn him upon his side, and\r\nto feel his forehead. It was cool and moist. He was fast asleep and\r\ndrenched with sweat. The great shock of his pain and fear and excitement\r\nhad broken his fever.\r\n\r\nWith the relief and joy of this discovery, the girl completely relaxed.\r\nNot observing Winthrope's wounds, which had bled little, she sought\r\nto force a way out through the entrance. It was by no means an easy task\r\nto free the wedged framework, and when, after much pulling and pushing,\r\nshe at last tore the mass loose, she found herself perspiring no less\r\nfreely than Winthrope.\r\n\r\nShe was far too preoccupied, however, to consider what this might mean.\r\nHer first thought was of the fire. She ran to her rude stone fireplace\r\nand raked over the ashes. They were still warm, but there was not a live\r\nember among them. Yet she realized that Winthrope must have hot food\r\nwhen he wakened, and Blake had carried with him the magnifying glass.\r\nFor a little she stood hesitating. But the defeat of the jackals had\r\ngiven her courage and resolution such as she had never before known. She\r\nreturned into the cave, and chose the sharpest of her stakes. Having\r\nmade certain that Winthrope was still asleep, she set off boldly down\r\nthe cleft.\r\n\r\nAt the first turn she came upon Blake's thorn barricade. It stretched\r\nacross the narrowest part of the cleft in an impenetrable wall, twelve\r\nfeet high. Only in the centre was a gap, which could have been filled by\r\nBlake in less than two hours' work. The girl's eyes brightened. She\r\nherself could gather the thorn-brush and fill the gap before night. They\r\nno longer need fear the jackals or even the larger beasts of prey. None\r\nthe less, they must have fire.\r\n\r\nSpurred on by the thought, she was about to spring through the barricade\r\nwhen she heard the tread of feet on the path beyond. She crouched down,\r\nand peered through the tangle of brush in the edge of the gap. Less\r\nthan ten paces away Blake was plodding heavily up the trail. She stepped\r\nout before him.\r\n\r\n\"You--you! Are you alive?\" she gasped.\r\n\r\n\"'Live? You bet your boots!\" came back the grim response. \"You bet\r\nI'm alive--though I had to go Jonah one better to do it. The whale\r\nheaved him up; I heaved up the whale--and it took about a barrel of\r\nsea-water to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sea-water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure . . . . I tumbled over twice on the way. But I made the beach.\r\nLord! how I pumped in the briny deep! Guess I won't go into details--but\r\nif you think you know anything about seasickness-- _Whew!_ Lucky for\r\nyours truly, the tide was just starting out, and the wind off shore.\r\nI'd fallen in the water, and the Jonah business laid me out cold.\r\nDidn't know anything until the tide came up again and soused me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad you're not dead. But how you must have suffered! You\r\nare still white, and your face is all creased.\"\r\n\r\nBlake attempted a careless laugh. \"Don't worry about me. I'm here,\r\nO. K., all that's left,--a little wobbly on my pins, but hungry as\r\na shark. But say, what's up with you? You're sweating like a-- Good\r\nthing, though. It'll stave off your spell of fever a while. How 'd\r\nyou happen to be coming down here so early?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was starting to find you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not you--that is, I thought you were dead. I was going to make certain,\r\nand to--to get the burning-glass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Um-m. I see. Let the fire go out, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not blame me, Mr. Blake! I was so ill and worn out, and I've paid\r\nfor it twice over, really I have. Didn't those awful beasts attack you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Beasts? How's that?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but you must have heard them! The horrid things tried to kill\r\nus!\" she cried, and she poured out a half incoherent account of all that\r\nhad happened since he left.\r\n\r\nBlake listened intently, his jaw thrust out, his eyes glowing upon her\r\nwith a look which she had never before seen in any man's eyes. But his\r\nfirst comment had nothing to do with her conduct.\r\n\r\n\"How's that?--sorry Win got rousted out of his nice little snooze--\r\nSnooze! Why, don't you know, we'd been all alone in our glory by\r\nto-night if it hadn't been for those brutes. He was in the stupor,\r\nand that would have been the end of him if the beasts hadn't stirred\r\nhim up so lively. I've heard of such a thing before, but I always\r\nthought it was a fake. Here you are sweating, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel much better than yesterday. I did not tell you, but I have felt\r\nill for nearly a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Fraid to tell, eh?--and you were so scared over the beasts-- Scared!\r\nBy Jiminy, you've got grit, little woman! There's two kinds of\r\nscaredness; you've got the Stonewall Jackson kind. If anybody asks\r\nyou, just refer them to Tommy Blake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Blake. But should we not hasten back now to prepare\r\nsomething for Mr. Winthrope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ditto for yours truly. I'm like that sepulchre you read about--white\r\noutside, and within nothing but bare bones and emptiness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nWITH BOW AND CLUB\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fire was soon re-lit, and a pot of meat set on to stew. It had ample\r\ntime to simmer. Winthrope was wrapped in a life-giving sleep, out of\r\nwhich he did not waken until evening, while Blake, unable to wait for\r\nthe pot to boil, and nauseated by the fishy odor of the dried seafowl,\r\nhunted out the jerked leopard meat, and having devoured enough to satisfy\r\na native, fell asleep under a bush.\r\n\r\nThe sun was half down the sky when he sat up and looked around, wide\r\nawake the moment he opened his eyes. Miss Leslie was quietly placing an\r\narmful of sticks on the fuel heap beside the baobab.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Miss Jenny! Hard at it, I see,\" he called cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" she cautioned. \"Mr. Winthrope is still asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good thing for him. He'll need all of that he can get.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you think--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, between you and me, I don't believe Win was built for the\r\ntropics. This fever of his, coming on so soon, wouldn't have hit nine\r\nmen in ten half so hard. He's bound to have another spell in a month\r\nor two, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"But cannot we possibly get away from here before then? Is there no way?\r\nSurely, you are so resourceful--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing doing, Miss Jenny! Give me tools, and I'd engage to turn out\r\na seagoing boat. But as it is, the only thing I could do would be to\r\nfire-burn a log. That would take two or three months, and in the end\r\nwe'd have a lop-sided canoe that'd live about half a second in one of\r\nthese tropic squalls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not the natives sail in canoes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe they do--and they make fire by rubbing sticks. We don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take our medicine, and wait for a ship to show up.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have no medicine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have no-- Say, Miss Jenny, you really ought to have stayed home from\r\nboarding-school and England long enough to learn your own language. I\r\nmeant, we've got to take what's coming to us, without laying down or\r\ngrouching. Both are the worst thing out for malaria.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that we must resign ourselves to this intolerable\r\nsituation--that we must calmly sit here and wait until the fever--\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I'll take care we don't sit around very much. We'll go on the\r\nhike, soon as Win can wobble. Which reminds me, I've got a little hike\r\non hand now. I'm going to close up that barricade before dark. Me for\r\na quiet night!\"\r\n\r\nWithout waiting for a reply, he took his weapons, and swung briskly away\r\ndown the cleft.\r\n\r\nHe returned a few minutes before sunset, with what appeared to be a\r\nlarge fur bag upon his back. Miss Leslie was pouring a bowl of broth\r\nfrom the stew-pot, and did not notice him until he sang out to her:\r\n\"Hey, Miss Jenny, spill over that stuff! No more of that in ours!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's for Mr. Winthrope. He has just wakened,\" she replied, still\r\nintent on her pouring.\r\n\r\n\"And you'd kill him with that slop! Heave it over. He's going to have\r\nbeef juice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! what's that on your back? You've killed an antelope!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure! Bushbuck, I guess they call him. Sneaked up when he was drinking,\r\nand stuck an arrow into his side. He jumped off a little way, and turned\r\nto see what'd bit him. I hauled off and put the second arrow right\r\nthrough his eye, into his brain. Neatest thing you ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"You surely are becoming a splendid archer!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; Jim dandy! I could do it again about once in ten thousand shots.\r\nAll the same, I've raked in this peacherino. Trot out your grill and\r\nwe'll have something fit to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"You spoke of beef juice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've a dozen steaks ready to broil. Slap 'em on the fire, and I'll\r\nsqueeze out enough juice with my fist to do Win for to-night.\"\r\n\r\nHe made good his assertion, using several of the steaks, which, having\r\nlost less than half their juices in the process, were eaten with great\r\nrelish by Miss Leslie and himself.\r\n\r\nWinthrope, after drinking the stimulating beef juice and a quantity of\r\nhot water, turned over and fell asleep again while Blake was dressing\r\nhis wounds. None of these was serious of itself; but Blake knew the\r\ndanger of infection in the tropics, and carefully washed out the gashes\r\nbefore applying the tallow salve which Miss Leslie had tried out from\r\nthe antelope fat.\r\n\r\nThe dressing was completed by torchlight. Blake then rolled the sleeper\r\ninto a comfortable position, took the torch from Miss Leslie, and left\r\nthe cave, pausing at the entrance to mutter a gruff good-night. The\r\ngirl murmured a response, but watched him anxiously as he passed out.\r\nA step beyond the entrance he paused and turned again. In the red\r\nglare of the torch, his face took on an expression that filled her with\r\nfright. Shrouded by the gloom of the hollow, she drew back to her bed,\r\nand without turning her eyes away from him, groped for one of her\r\nbamboo stakes.\r\n\r\nBut before she could arm herself, she saw Blake stoop over and grasp\r\nwith his free hand the mass of interwoven bamboos. He straightened\r\nhimself, and the framework swung lightly up and over, until it stood\r\non end across the cave entrance. The girl stole around and peered out\r\nat him. He had spread open the antelope skin, and was beginning to slice\r\nthe meat for drying. Though his forehead was furrowed, his expression\r\nwas by no means sinister. Relieved at the thought that the light must\r\nhave deceived her, she returned to her bed and was soon sleeping as\r\nsoundly as Winthrope.\r\n\r\nBlake strung the greater part of the meat on the drying racks, built a\r\nsmudge fire beneath, and stretched the antelope skin on a frame. This\r\ndone, he took his club and a small piece of bloody meat, and walked\r\nstealthily down the cleft to the barricade. Quiet as was his approach,\r\nit was met by a warning yelp on the farther side of the thorny wall,\r\nand he could hear the scurry of fleeing animals.\r\n\r\nHe kept on until the barricade loomed up before him in the starlight.\r\nFrom cliff to cliff the wall now stretched across the gorge without hole\r\nor gap. But Blake grasped the trunk of a young date-palm which projected\r\nfrom the barricade near the bottom, and pushed it out. The displacement\r\nof the spiky fronds disclosed the low passage which he had made in the\r\ncentre of the barricade. He placed the piece of meat on one side, two\r\nor three feet from the hole, and squatted down across from it, with his\r\nclub balanced on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour passed--an hour; and still he waited, silent and motionless\r\nas a statue. At last stealthy footsteps sounded on the outer side of\r\nthe thorn wall, and an animal began to creep through the wall, sniffing\r\nfor the bait. Blake waited with the immobility of an Eskimo. The delay\r\nwas brief.\r\n\r\nWith a boldness for which Blake had not been prepared, the beast leaped\r\nthrough and seized the meat. Even in the dim light, Blake could see that\r\nhe had lured an animal larger than any jackal. But this only served to\r\nlend greater force to his blow. As he struck, he leaped to his feet The\r\nbrute fell as though struck by lightning and lay still.\r\n\r\nBlake prodded the inert form warily; then knelt and passed his hands\r\nover it. The beast had whirled about just in time to meet the descending\r\nclub, and the blow had crushed in its skull. Chuckling at the success\r\nof his ruse, he drew the palm back into the opening, and swung his prize\r\nover his shoulder. When he came to the fire, a glance showed him that\r\nhe had killed a full-grown spotted hyena.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when Miss Leslie appeared, there were two hides stretched\r\non bamboo frames, and the air was dark with vultures streaming down\r\ninto the cleft near the barricade. Blake was sleeping the sleep of the\r\njust, and did not waken until she had built the fire and begun to broil\r\nthe steaks which he had saved.\r\n\r\nAgain they had a feast of the fresh antelope meat. But with repletion\r\ncame more of fastidiousness, and Blake agreed with Miss Leslie when she\r\nremarked that salt would have added to the flavor. He set off presently,\r\nand spent half a day on the talus of the headland, gathering salt from\r\nthe rock crannies.\r\n\r\nFor the next three days he left the cleft only to gather eggs. The\r\ngreater part of his time was spent in tanning the hyena and antelope\r\nskins. Meantime Miss Leslie continued to nurse Winthrope and to gather\r\nfirewood. Under Blake's directions, she also purified the salt by\r\ndissolving it in a pot of water, and allowing the dirt to settle, when\r\nthe clarified solution was poured off and evaporated over the fire in one\r\nof the earthenware pans.\r\n\r\nAt first Winthrope had been too weak to sit up. But treated to a liberal\r\ndiet of antelope broth, raw eggs, hot water, and cocoanut milk, he gained\r\nstrength faster than Blake had expected. On the fourth day Blake set him\r\nto work on the final rubbing of the new skins; on the fifth, he ordered\r\nhim to go for eggs.\r\n\r\nMuch to Miss Leslie's surprise, Winthrope started off without a word of\r\nprotest. All his peevish irritability and childishness had gone with the\r\nfever, and the girl was gratified to see the quiet manner in which he\r\nset about a task which seemed an imposition upon his half-regained\r\nstrength. But the very motive which, seemingly, prevented him from\r\nprotesting, impelled her to speak for him.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blake!\" she exclaimed, \"Mr. Winthrope is going off without a\r\nword; but I can't endure it! You have no right to send him on such an\r\nerrand. It will kill him!\"\r\n\r\nBlake met her indignant look with a sober stare.\r\n\r\n\"What if it does!\" he said. \"Better for him to die in the gallant\r\nservice of his fellows, than to sit here and rot. Eh, Win?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not trouble yourself, Miss Genevieve. I hope I shall pull through\r\nall right. If not--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you shall not! I'll go myself!\"\r\n\r\n\"See here, Miss Leslie,\" said Blake, somewhat sternly; \"who's got\r\nthe responsibility of keeping you two alive for the next month or so?\r\nI've been in the tropics before, and I know something of the way people\r\nhave to live to get out again. I'm trying to do my best, and I tell you\r\nstraight, if you won't mind me, I'm going to make you, no matter how\r\nmuch it hurts your feelings. You see how nice and meek Win takes his\r\norders. I explained matters to him last night--\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you, Blake, you shall have no cause for complaint as to my\r\nconduct,\" muttered Winthrope. \"I should like to observe, however, that\r\nin speaking to Miss Leslie--\"\r\n\r\n\"There you are again, with your everlasting talk. Cut it out, and get\r\nbusy. To-morrow we all go on a hike to the river.\"\r\n\r\nAs Winthrope started off, Blake turned to Miss Leslie, with a\r\ngood-natured grin.\r\n\r\n\"You see, it's this way, Miss Jenny--\" he began. He caught her look of\r\ndisdain, and his face darkened. \"Mad, eh? So that's the racket!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blake, I will not have you talk to me in that way. Mr. Winthrope\r\nis a gentleman, but nothing more to me than a friend such as any young\r\nwoman--\"\r\n\r\n\"That settles it! I'll take your word for it, Miss Jenny,\" broke in\r\nBlake, and springing up, he set about his work, whistling.\r\n\r\nThe girl gazed at his broad back and erect head, uncertain whether\r\nshe should feel relieved or anxious. The more she thought the matter\r\nover, the more uncertain she became, and the more she wondered at her\r\nuncertainty. Could it be possible that she was becoming interested in\r\na man who, if her ears had not deceived her-- But no! That could not be\r\npossible!\r\n\r\nYet what a ring there was to his voice!--so clear and tonic after\r\nWinthrope's precise, modulated drawl. And her countryman's firmness! He\r\ncould be rude if need be; but he would make her do what he thought was\r\nbest for her health. Was it not possible that she had misunderstood his\r\nwords on the cliff, and so misjudged--wronged--him?--that Winthrope, so\r\neager to stipulate for her hand-- But then Winthrope had more than\r\nconfirmed her dreadful conclusions taken from Blake's words, and\r\nWinthrope was an English gentleman. It could not be possible that an\r\nEnglish gentleman--\r\n\r\nShe ended in a state of utter bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE SAVAGE MANIFEST\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Winthrope had succeeded in dragging himself to and from the headland\r\nwithout a collapse, the following morning, as soon as the dew was dry,\r\nBlake called out all hands for the expedition. He was in the best of\r\nhumors, and showed unexpected consideration by presenting Winthrope with\r\na cane, which he had cut and trimmed during the night.\r\n\r\nHaving sent Miss Leslie to fill the whiskey flask with spring water,\r\nhe dropped three cocoanut-shell bowls, a piece of meat and a lump of\r\nsalt into one of the earthenware pots, and slung all over his shoulder\r\nin the antelope skin. With his bow hung over the other shoulder, knife\r\nand arrows in his belt, and his big club in hand, he looked ready for\r\nany contingency.\r\n\r\n\"We'll hit first for the mouth of the river,\" he said. \"I'm going\r\non ahead. If I'm not in sight when you come up, pick a tree where the\r\nground is dry, and wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I say, Blake,\" replied Winthrope, \"I see animals over in the\r\ncoppices, and you should know that I am physically unable--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but antelope,\" interrupted Blake. \"I've seen them enough\r\nnow to know them twice as far off. And you can bet on it they'd not be\r\nthere if any dangerous beast was in smelling distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so clever of you, Mr. Blake,\" remarked Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Simple enough when you happen to think of it,\" responded Blake. \"Yes;\r\nthe only thing you've got to look out for's the ticks in the grass.\r\nThey'll keep you interested. They bit me up in great shape.\"\r\n\r\nHe scowled at the recollection, nodded by way of emphasis, and was off\r\nlike a shot. The edge of the plain beneath the cliff was strewn with\r\nrocks, among which, even with Miss Leslie's help, Winthrope could pick\r\nhis way but slowly. Before they were clear of the rough ground, they saw\r\nBlake disappear among the mangroves.\r\n\r\nThe ticks proved less annoying than they had apprehended after Blake's\r\nwarning. But when they approached the mouth of the river, they were\r\nalarmed to hear, above the roar of the surf, loud snorting, such as\r\ncould only be made by large animals. Fearful lest Blake had roused and\r\nangered some forest beast, they veered to the right, and ran to hide\r\nbehind a clump of thorns. Winthrope sank down exhausted the moment they\r\nreached cover; but Miss Leslie crept to the far end of the thicket and\r\npeered around.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, look here!\" she cried. \"It's a whole herd of elephants trying\r\nto cross the river mouth where we did, and they're being drowned, poor\r\nthings!\"\r\n\r\n\"Elephants?\" panted Winthrope, and he dragged himself forward beside\r\nher. \"Why, so there are; quite a drove of the beasts. Yet, I must say,\r\nthey appear smaller--ah, yes; see their heads. They must be the hippos\r\nBlake saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those ugly creatures? I once saw some at the zoo. Just the same, they\r\nwill be drowned. Some are right in the surf!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say, I'm sure, Miss Genevieve, but I have an idea that the\r\nbeasts are quite at home in the water. I fancy they enjoy surf bathing\r\nas keenly as ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do believe you are right. There is one going in from the quiet water.\r\nBut look at those funny little ones on the backs of the others!\"\r\n\r\n\"Must be the baby hippos,\" replied Winthrope, indifferently. \"If you\r\nplease, I'll take a pull at the flask. I am very dry.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he had half emptied the flask, he stretched out in the shade to\r\ndoze. But Miss Leslie continued to watch the movements of the snorting\r\nhippos, amused by the ponderous antics of the grown ones in the surf,\r\nand the comic appearance of the barrel-like infants as they mounted the\r\nbacks of their obese mothers.\r\n\r\nPresently Blake came out from among the mangroves, and walked across to\r\nthe beach, a few yards away from the huge bathers. To all appearances,\r\nthey paid as little attention to him as he to them. Miss Leslie glanced\r\nabout at Winthrope. He was fast asleep. She waited a few moments to see\r\nif the hippopotami would attack Blake. They continued to ignore him,\r\nand gaining courage from their indifference, she stepped out from behind\r\nthe thicket, and advanced to where Blake was crouched on the beach. When\r\nshe came up, she saw beside him a heap of oysters, which he was opening\r\nin rapid succession.\r\n\r\n\"Hello! You're just in time to help,\" he called. \"Where's Win!\"\r\n\r\n\"Asleep behind those bushes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Worst thing he could do. But lend a hand, and we'll shuck these\r\noysters before rousting him out. You can rinse those I've opened.\r\nFill the pot with water, and put them in to soak.\"\r\n\r\n\"They look very tempting. How did you chance to find them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Saw 'em on the mangrove roots at low tide, first time I nosed around\r\nhere. Tide was well up to-day; but I managed to get these all right with\r\na little diving. Only trouble, the skeets most ate me alive.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie glanced at her companion's dry clothing, and came back to\r\nthe oysters themselves. \"These look very tempting. Do you like them\r\nraw?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't say I like them much any way, as a rule. But if I did, I\r\nwouldn't eat this mess raw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"This must be the dry season here, and the river is running mighty\r\nclear. Just the same, it's nothing more than liquid malaria. We'll not\r\neat these oysters till they've been pasteurized.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the water is so dangerous, I fear we will suffer before we can\r\nreturn,\" replied Miss Leslie, and she held up the flask.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Blake. \"Half gone already? That was Winthrope.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was very thirsty. Could we not boil a potful of the river water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, when the ebb gets strong, if we run too dry. First, though, we'll\r\nmake a try for cocoanuts. Let's hit out for the nearest grove now. The\r\nmain thing is to keep moving.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, Blake caught up the pot and his club, and started for the\r\nthorn clump, leaving the skin, together with the meat and the salt, for\r\nMiss Leslie to carry. Winthrope was wakened by a touch of Blake's foot,\r\nand all three were soon walking away from the seashore, just within the\r\nshady border of the mangrove wood.\r\n\r\nAt the first fan-palm Blake stopped to gather a number of leaves, for\r\ntheir palm-leaf hats were now cracked and broken. A little farther on\r\na ruddy antelope, with lyrate horns, leaped out of the bush before them\r\nand dashed off towards the river before Blake could string his bow. As\r\nif in mockery of his lack of readiness, a troupe of large green monkeys\r\nset up a wild chattering in a tree above the party.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Miss Jenny, do you think you can lug the pot, if we go slow?\r\nIt isn't far now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for you, little woman! That'll give me a chance to shoot quick.\"\r\n\r\nThey moved on again for a hundred yards or more; but though Blake kept\r\na sharp lookout both above and below, he saw no game other than a few\r\nsmall birds and a pair of blue wood-pigeons. When he sought to creep up\r\non the latter, they flew into the next tree. In following them, he came\r\nupon a conical mound of hard clay, nearly four feet high.\r\n\r\n\"Hello; this must be one of those white anthills,\" he said, and he gave\r\nthe mound a kick.\r\n\r\nInstantly a tiny object whirred up and struck him in the face.\r\n\r\n\"Whee!\" he exclaimed, springing back and striking out. \"A hornet! No;\r\nit's a bee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did it sting you?\" cried Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Sting? Keep back; there's a lot more of 'em. Sting? Oh, no; he only\r\nhypodermicked me with a red-hot darning needle! Shy around here. There's\r\na whole swarm of the little devils, and they're hopping mad. Hear 'em\r\nbuzz!\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is their hive?\" asked Winthrope, as all three drew back\r\nbehind the nearest bushes.\r\n\r\n\"Guess they've borrowed that ant-hill,\" replied Blake, gingerly\r\nfingering the white lump which marked the spot where the bee had struck\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't it be delightful if we had some honey?\" exclaimed Miss\r\nLeslie.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove, that really wouldn't be half bad!\" chimed in Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we can, Miss Jenny; only we'll need a fire to tackle those\r\nbuzzers. Guess it'll be as well to let them cool off a bit also. The\r\ncocoanuts are only a little way ahead now. Here; give me the pot.\"\r\n\r\nThey soon came to a small grove of cocoanut palms, where Blake threw down\r\nhis club and bow and handed his burning-glass to Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he said; \"you and Win start a fire. It's early yet, but I'm\r\nthinking we'll all be ready enough for oyster stew.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the meat?\" asked Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Keep that till later. Here goes for our dessert.\"\r\n\r\nSelecting one of the smaller palms, Blake spat on his hands, and began\r\nto climb the slender trunk. Aided by previous experiences, he mounted\r\nsteadily to the top. The descent was made with even more care and\r\nsteadiness, for he did not wish to tear the skin from his hands again.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Win,\" he said, as he neared the bottom and sprang down, \"leave\r\nthe cooking to Miss Leslie, and husk some of those nuts. You won't\r\nmore'n have time to do it before the stew is ready.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope's response was to draw out his penknife. Blake stretched\r\nhimself at ease in the shade, but kept a critical eye on his companions.\r\nAlthough Winthrope's fingers trembled with weakness, he worked with\r\na precision and rapidity that drew a grunt of approval from Blake.\r\nPresently Miss Leslie, who had been stirring the stew with a twig, threw\r\nin a little salt, and drew the pot from the fire.\r\n\r\n\"_En avant_, gentlemen! Dinner is served,\" she called gayly.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" demanded Blake. \"Oh; sure. Hold on, Miss Jenny.\r\nYou'll dump it all.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrapped a wisp of grass about the pot, and filled the three cocoanut\r\nbowls. The stew was boiling hot; but they fished up the oysters with\r\nthe bamboo forks that Blake had carved some days since. By the time the\r\noysters were eaten, the liquor in the bowl was cool enough to drink.\r\nThe process was repeated until the pot had been emptied of its contents.\r\n\r\n\"Say, but that was something like,\" murmured Blake. \"If only we'd had\r\npretzels and beer to go with it! But these nuts won't be bad.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they finished the cocoanuts, Winthrope asked for a drink of water.\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be best to keep it until later?\" replied Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" put in Blake. \"We've had enough liquid refreshments to do\r\nany one. If I don't look out, you'll both be drinking river water.\r\nJust bear in mind the work I'd have to carve a pair of gravestones.\r\nNo; that flask has got to do you till we get home. I don't shin up any\r\nmore telegraph poles to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be best for Mr. Winthrope to rest during the noon hours?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Fraid not, Miss Jenny. We're not on t'other side of Jordan yet,\r\nand there's no rest for the weary this side.\"\r\n\r\n\"What odd expressions you use, Mr. Blake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just giving you the reverse application of one of those songs they\r\njolly us with in the mission churches--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure, Mr. Blake--\"\r\n\r\n\"Me, too, Miss Jenny! So, as that's settled, we'll be moving. Chuck\r\nsome live coals in the pot, and come on.\"\r\n\r\nHe started off, weapons in hand. Winthrope made a languid effort to take\r\npossession of the pot. But Miss Leslie pushed him aside, and wrapping all\r\nin the antelope skin, slung it upon her back.\r\n\r\n\"The brute!\" exclaimed Winthrope. \"To leave such a load for you, when\r\nhe knew that I can do so little!\"\r\n\r\nThe girl met his outburst with a brave attempt at a smile. \"Please try\r\nto look at the bright side, Mr. Winthrope. Really, I believe he thinks it\r\nis best for us to exert ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has other opinions with which we of the cultured class would hardly\r\nagree, Miss Leslie. Consider his command that we shall go thirsty\r\nuntil he permits us to return to the cliffs. The man's impertinence\r\nis intolerable. I shall go to the river and drink when I choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but the danger of malaria!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense. Malaria, like yellow fever, comes only from the bite of\r\ncertain species of mosquitoes. If we have the fever, it will be entirely\r\nhis fault. We have been bitten repeatedly this morning, and all because\r\nhe must compel us to come with him to this infected lowland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, I think we should do what Mr. Blake says.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Miss Genevieve, for your sake I will endeavor not to break with\r\nthe fellow. Only, you know, it is deuced hard to keep one's temper when\r\none considers what a bounder--what an unmitigated cad--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop! I will not listen to another word!\" exclaimed the girl, and she\r\nhurried after Blake, leaving Winthrope staring in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"My word!\" he muttered; \"can it be, after all I've done--and him,\r\nof all the low fellows--\"\r\n\r\nHe stood for several moments in deep thought. The look on his sallow face\r\nwas far from pleasant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE SERPENT STRIKES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Winthrope came up with the others, they were gathering green leaves\r\nto throw on the fire which was blazing close beside the ant-hill.\r\n\r\n\"Get a move on you!\" called Blake. \"You're slow. Grab a bunch of\r\nleaves, and get into the smoke, if you don't want to be stung.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope neither gathered any leaves nor hurried himself, until he was\r\nvisited by a highly irritated bee. Then he obeyed with alacrity. Blake\r\nwas far too intent on other matters to heed the Englishman. Leaping in\r\nand out of the thick of the smoke, he pounded the ant-hill with his club,\r\nuntil he had broken a gaping hole into the cavity. The smoke, pouring\r\ninto the hive, made short work of the bees that had not already been\r\nsuffocated.\r\n\r\nAlthough the antelope skin was drawn into the shape of a sack, both it\r\nand the pot were filled to overflowing with honey, and there were still\r\nmore combs left than the three could eat.\r\n\r\nBlake caught Winthrope smiling with satisfaction as he licked his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with my expedition now, old man?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I--ah--must admit, Blake, we have had a most enjoyable change of food.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you are sure it will agree with you,\" remarked Miss Leslie.\r\n\r\n\"But I am sure of that, Miss Genevieve. I could digest anything to-day.\r\nI'm fairly ravenous.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the more reason to be careful,\" rejoined Blake. \"I guess, though,\r\nwhat we've had'll do no harm. We'll let it settle a bit, here in the\r\nshade, and then hit the home trail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could we not first go to the river, Mr. Blake? My hands are dreadfully\r\nsticky.\"\r\n\r\n\"Win will take you. It's only a little way to the bank here and\r\nthere's not much underbrush.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you think it's quite safe--\" remarked Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"It's safe enough. Go on. You'll see the river in half a minute. Only\r\nthing, you'd better watch out for alligators.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that--er--properly speaking, these are crocodiles.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say! Heap of difference it will make if one gets you.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie caught Winthrope's eye. He turned on his heel, and led the\r\nway for her through the first thicket. Beyond this they came to a little\r\nglade which ran through to the river. When they reached the bank, they\r\nstepped cautiously down the muddy slope, and bathed their hands in the\r\nclear water. As Miss Leslie rose, Winthrope bent over and began to drink.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Winthrope!\" she exclaimed; \"please don't! In your weak\r\ncondition, I'm so afraid--\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not alarm yourself. I am perfectly well, and I am quite as competent\r\nto judge what is good for me as your--ah--countryman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Winthrope, I am thinking only of your own good.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope took another deep draught, rinsed his fingers fastidiously, and\r\narose.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Miss Genevieve,\" he observed, \"a woman looks at these matters\r\nin such a different light from a man. But you should know that there are\r\nsome things a gentleman cannot tolerate.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were welcome to all the water in the flask. Surely with that you\r\ncould have waited, if only to please me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, if you put it that way, I must beg pardon. Anything to please you,\r\nI'm sure! Pray forgive me, and forget the incident. It is now past.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so!\" she murmured; but her heart sank as she glanced at his\r\nsallow face, and she recalled his languid, feeble movements.\r\n\r\nPiqued by her look, Winthrope started back through the glade. Miss\r\nLeslie was turning to follow, when she caught sight of a gorgeous crimson\r\nblossom under the nearest tree. It was the first flower she had seen\r\nsince being shipwrecked. She uttered a little cry of delight, and ran to\r\npluck the blossom.\r\n\r\nWinthrope, glancing about at her exclamation, saw her stoop over the\r\nflower--and in the same instant he saw a huge vivid coil, all black and\r\ngreen and yellow, flash up out of the bedded leaves and strike against\r\nthe girl. She staggered back, screaming with horror, yet seemed unable\r\nto run.\r\n\r\nWinthrope swung up his stick, and dashed across the glade towards her.\r\n\r\n\"What is it--a snake?\" he cried.\r\n\r\nThe girl did not seem to hear him. She had ceased screaming, and stood\r\nrigid with fright, glaring down at the ground before her. In a moment\r\nWinthrope was near enough, to make out the brilliant glistening body,\r\nnow extended full length in the grass. It was nearly five feet long and\r\nthick as his thigh. Another step, and he saw the hideous triangular\r\nhead, lifted a few inches on the thick neck. The cold eyes were fixed\r\nupon the girl in a malignant, deadly stare.\r\n\r\n\"Snake! snake!\" he yelled, and thrust his cane at the reptile's tail.\r\n\r\nAgain came a flashing leap of the beautiful ornate coil, and the\r\nstick was struck from Winthrope's hand. He danced backward, wild\r\nwith excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Snake!--Hi, Blake! monster!--Run, Miss Leslie! I'll hold him--I'll\r\nget another stick!\"\r\n\r\nHe darted aside to catch up a branch, and then ran in and struck boldly\r\nat the adder, which reared hissing to meet him. But the blow fell short,\r\nand the rotten wood shattered on the ground. Again Winthrope ran aside\r\nfor a stick. There was none near, and as he paused to glance about,\r\nBlake came sprinting down the glade.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" he shouted.\r\n\r\n\"There--Hi! look out! You'll be on him!\"\r\n\r\nBlake stopped short, barely beyond striking distance of the hissing\r\nreptile.\r\n\r\n\"Wow!\" he yelled. \"Puff adder! I'll fix him.\"\r\n\r\nHe leaped back, and thrust his bow at the snake. The challenge was met\r\nby a vicious lunge. Even where he stood Winthrope heard the thud of the\r\nreptile's head upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Now, once more, tootsie!\" mocked Blake, swinging up his club.\r\n\r\nAgain the adder struck at the bow tip, more viciously than before. With\r\nthe flash of the stroke, Blake's right foot thrust forward, and his\r\nclub came down with all the drive of his sinewy arm behind it. The blow\r\nfell across the thickest part of the adder's outstretched body.\r\n\r\n\"Told you so! See him wiggle!\" shouted Blake. \"Broke his back, first\r\nlick-- What's the matter, Miss Jenny? He can't do anything now.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie did not answer. She stood rigid, her face ashy-gray, her\r\ndilated eyes fixed upon the writhing, hissing adder.\r\n\r\n\"I--I think the snake struck her!\" gasped Winthrope, suddenly overcome\r\nwith horror.\r\n\r\n\"God!\" cried Blake. He dropped his club, and rushed to the girl. In\r\na moment he had knelt before her and flung up her leopard-skin skirt.\r\nHer stockings ripped to shreds in his frantic grasp. There, a little\r\nbelow her right knee, was a tiny red wound. Blake put his lips to it,\r\nand sucked with fierce energy.\r\n\r\nThen the girl found her voice.\r\n\r\n\"Go away--go away! How dare you!\" she cried, as her face flushed\r\nscarlet.\r\n\r\nBlake turned, spat, and burst out with a loud demand of Winthrope:\r\n\"Quick! the little knife--I'll have to slash it! Ten times worse\r\nthan a rattlesnake-- Lord! you're slow--I'll use mine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let go of me--let go! What do you mean, sir?\" cried the girl,\r\nstruggling to free herself.\r\n\r\n\"Hold still, you little fool!\" he shouted. \"It's death--sure death,\r\nif I don't get the poison from that bite!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not bitten-- Let go, I say! It struck in the fold of my skirt.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Jenny, don't lie! It's certain death! I saw the\r\nmark--\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a thorn. I drew it out an hour ago.\"\r\n\r\nBlake looked up into her hazel eyes. They were blazing with indignant\r\nscorn. He freed her, and rose with clumsy slowness. Again he glanced at\r\nher quivering, scarlet face, only to look away with a sheepish expression.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you think I'm just a damned meddlesome idiot,\" he mumbled.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer. He stood for a little, rubbing a finger across his\r\nsun-blistered lips. Suddenly he stopped and looked at the finger. It was\r\nstreaked with blood.\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" he exclaimed. \"Didn't stop to think of that! It's just as\r\nwell for me, Miss Jenny, that wasn't an adder bite. A little poison on\r\nmy sore lip would have done for me. Ten to one, we'd both have turned\r\nup our toes at the same time. Of course, though, that'd be nothing to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie put her hands before her face, and burst into hysterical\r\nweeping.\r\n\r\nBlake looked around, far more alarmed than when facing the adder.\r\n\r\n\"Here, you blooming lud!\" he shouted; \"take the lady away, and be\r\nquick about it. She'll go dotty if she sees any more snake stunts. Clear\r\nout with her, while I smash the wriggler.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope, who had been staring fixedly at the beautiful coloring and\r\nloathsome form of the writhing adder, started at Blake's harsh command\r\nas though struck.\r\n\r\n\"I--er--to be sure,\" he stammered, and darting around to the hysterical\r\ngirl, he took her arm and hurried her away up the glade.\r\n\r\nThey had gone several paces when Blake came running up behind them.\r\nWinthrope looked back with a glance of inquiry. Blake shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" he said. \"Give me your cigarette case. I've thought of\r\nsomething-- Hold on; take out the cigarettes. Smoke 'em, if you like.\"\r\n\r\nCase in hand, Blake returned to the wounded adder, and picked up his\r\nclub. A second smashing blow would have ended the matter at once; but\r\nBlake did not strike. Instead, he feinted with his club until he managed\r\nto pin down the venomous head. The club lay across the monster's neck,\r\nand he held it fast with the pressure of his foot.\r\n\r\nWhen, half an hour later, he wiped his knife on a wisp of grass and stood\r\nup, the cigarette case contained over a tablespoonful of a crystalline\r\nliquid. He peered in at it, his heavy jaw thrust out, his eyes glowing\r\nwith savage elation.\r\n\r\n\"Talk about your meat trusts and Winchesters!\" he exulted; \"here's a\r\nwhole carload of beef in this little box--enough dope to morgue a herd of\r\nsteers. Good God, though, that was a close shave for her!\"\r\n\r\nHis face sobered, and he stood for several moments staring thoughtfully\r\ninto space. Then his gaze chanced to fall upon the great crimson blossom\r\nwhich had so nearly lured the girl to her death.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" he exclaimed; \"that's an amaryllis. Wonder if she wasn't\r\ncoming to pick it--\" He snapped shut the lid of the cigarette case,\r\nthrust it carefully into his shirt pocket, and stepped forward to pluck\r\nthe flower. \"Makes a fellow feel like a kid; but maybe it'll make her\r\nfeel less sore at me.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood gazing at the flower for several moments, his eyes aglow with a\r\nsoft blue light.\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" he sighed; \"if only-- But what's the use? She's 'way out of\r\nmy class--a rough brute like me! All the same, it's up to me to take\r\ncare of her. She can't keep me from being her friend--and she sure\r\ncan't object to my picking flowers for her.\"\r\n\r\nAmaryllis in hand, he gathered up his bow and club. Then he paused to\r\nstudy the skin of the decapitated adder. The inspection ended with a\r\nshake of his head.\r\n\r\n\"Better not, Thomas. It would make a dandy quiver; but then, it might\r\nget on her nerves.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the ant-hill, he found companions and honey alike gone.\r\nHe went on to the cocoanuts. There he came upon Winthrope stretched flat\r\nbeside the skin of honey. Miss Leslie was seated a little way beyond,\r\nnervously bending a palm-leaf into shape for a hat.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Blake,\" drawled Winthrope, \"you've been a deuced long time\r\nin coming. It was no end of a task to lug the honey--\"\r\n\r\nBlake brushed past without replying, and went on until he stood before\r\nthe girl. As she glanced up at him, he held out the crimson blossom.\r\n\r\n\"Thought you might like posies,\" he said, in a hesitating voice.\r\n\r\nInstead of taking the flower, she drew back with a gesture of repulsion.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, take it away!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nBlake flung the rejected gift on the ground, and crushed it beneath his\r\nheel.\r\n\r\n\"Catch me making a fool of myself again!\" he growled.\r\n\r\n\"I--I did not mean it that way--really I didn't, Mr. Blake. It was the\r\nthought of that awful snake.\"\r\n\r\nBut Blake, cut to the quick, had turned away, far too angry to heed what\r\nshe said. He stopped short beside the Englishman; but only to sling the\r\nskin of honey upon his back. The load was by no means a light one, even\r\nfor his strength. Yet he caught up the heavy pot as well, and made off\r\nacross the plain at a pace which the others could not hope to equal.\r\n\r\nAs Winthrope rose and came forward to join Miss Leslie, he looked about\r\nclosely for the bruised flower. It was nowhere in sight.\r\n\r\n\"Er--beg pardon, Miss Genevieve, but did not Blake drop the\r\nbloom--er--blossom somewhere about here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he did,\" replied Miss Leslie. She spoke with studied\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\n\"I--ah--saw the fellow exhibit his impudence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye-es?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know, I think it high time the bounder is taken down a peg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed! Then why do you not try it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Genevieve! you know that at present I am physically so much his\r\ninferior--\"\r\n\r\n\"How about mentally?\"\r\n\r\nThough the girl's eyes were veiled by their lashes, she saw Winthrope\r\ncast after Blake a look that seemed to her almost fiercely vindictive.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" she said, smiling, but watching him closely.\r\n\r\n\"Mentally!--We'll soon see about that!\" he muttered. \"I must say,\r\nMiss Genevieve, it strikes me as deuced odd, you know, to hear you speak\r\nso pleasantly of a person who--not to mention past occurrences--has\r\nto-day, with the most shocking disregard of--er--decency--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!--stop this instant!\" screamed the girl, her nerves overwrought.\r\n\r\nWinthrope smiled with complacent assurance.\r\n\r\n\"My dear young lady,\" he drawled, \"allow me to repeat, 'All is fair\r\nin love and war.' Believe me, I love you most ardently.\"\r\n\r\n\"No gentleman would press his suit at such a time as this!\"\r\n\r\n\"Really now, I fancy I have always comported myself as a gentleman--\"\r\n\r\n\"A trifle too much so, truth to say!\" she retorted.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed. However, this is now quite another matter. Has it not\r\noccurred to you, my dear, that this entire experience of ours since\r\nthat beastly storm is rather--er--compromising?\"\r\n\r\n\"You--you dare say such a thing! I'll go this instant and tell Mr.\r\nBlake! I'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"Begging your pardon, madam,--but are you prepared to marry that\r\nbarbarous clodhopper?\"\r\n\r\n\"Marry? What do you mean, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely that. It is a question of marriage, if you'll pardon me.\r\nAnd, you see, I flatter myself, that when it comes to the point, it will\r\nnot be Blake, but myself--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed! And if I should prefer neither of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Begging your pardon,--I fancy you will honor me with your hand, my\r\ndear. For one thing, you admit that I am a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment, please! I am trying to intimate to you, as delicately as\r\npossible, how--er--embarrassing you would find it to have these little\r\noccurrences--above all, to-day's--noised abroad to the vulgar crowd,\r\nor even among your friends--\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? What do you want?\" cried the girl, staring at him\r\nwith a deepening fear in her bewildered eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Believe me, my dear, it grieves me to so perturb you; but--er--love\r\nmust have its way, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget. There is Mr. Blake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, to be sure! But really now, you would not ask, or even permit\r\nhim to murder me; and one is not legally bound, you know, to observe\r\npromises--a pledge of silence, for example--when extorted under duress,\r\nunder violence, you know.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie looked the Englishman up and down, her brown eyes sparkling\r\nwith quick-returning anger. He met her scorn with a smile of smug\r\ncomplacency.\r\n\r\n\"Cad!\" she cried, and turning her back upon him, she set out across\r\nthe plain after Blake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE EAVESDROPPER CAUGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nEven had it not been for her doubts of Blake, the girl's modesty would\r\nhave caused her to think twice before repeating to him the Englishman's\r\ninsulting proposal. While she yet hesitated and delayed, Winthrope\r\ncame down with a second attack of fever. Blake, who until then had held\r\nhimself sullenly apart from him as well as from Miss Leslie, at once\r\nsoftened to a gentler, or, at least, to a more considerate mood. Though\r\nhis speech and bearing continued morose, he took upon himself all the\r\nduties of night nurse, besides working and foraging several hours each\r\nday.\r\n\r\nMuch to Miss Leslie's surprise, she found herself tending the invalid\r\nthrough the daytime almost as though nothing had happened. But everything\r\nabout this wild and perilous life was so strange and unnatural to her\r\nthat she found herself accepting the most unconventional relations as\r\na regular consequence of the situation. She was feverishly eager for\r\nanything that might occupy her mind; for she felt that to brood over\r\nthe future might mean madness. The mere thought of the possibilities was\r\nfar too terrifying to be calmly dwelt upon. Though slight, there had been\r\nsome little comfort in the belief that she could rely on Winthrope.\r\nBut now she was left alone with her doubt and dread. Even if she had\r\nnothing to fear from Blake, there were all the savage dangers of the\r\ncoast, and behind those, far worse, the fever.\r\n\r\nMeantime Blake went about his share of the camp work, gruff and silent,\r\nbut with the usual concrete results. He brought load after load of fresh\r\ncocoanuts, and took great pains to hunt out the deliciously flavored\r\neggs of the frigate birds to tempt Winthrope's failing appetite.\r\nWhen Miss Leslie suggested that beef juice would be much better for the\r\ninvalid than broth, he went out immediately in search of a gum-bearing\r\ntree, and that night, after heating a small quantity of gum in the\r\ncigarette case with the adder poison, he spent hours replacing his\r\narrow-heads with small barbed tips that could be loosened from their\r\nsockets by a slight pull.\r\n\r\nA little before dawn he dipped two of his new arrow-heads in the sticky\r\ncontents of the cigarette case, fitted them carefully to their shafts,\r\nand stole away down the cleft. Dawn found him crouched low in the grass\r\nwhere the overflow from the pool ran out into the plain along its little\r\nchannel. He could see large forms moving away from him; then came the\r\nflood of crimson light, and he made out that the figures were a drove of\r\nhuge eland.\r\n\r\nHis eyes flashed with eagerness. It was a long shot; but he knew that\r\nno more was required than to pierce the skin on any part of his quarry's\r\nbody. He put his fingers between his teeth, and sent out a piercing\r\nwhistle. It was a trick he had tried more than once on deer and pronghorn\r\nantelope. As he expected, the eland halted and swung half around. Their\r\nox-like sides presented a mark hard to miss.\r\n\r\nHe rose and shot as they were wheeling to fly. Before he could fit\r\nhis second arrow to the string, the whole herd were running off at a\r\nlumbering gallop. He lowered his bow, and walked after the animals,\r\nsmiling with grim anticipation. He had seen his arrow strike against\r\nthe side of the young bull at which he had aimed.\r\n\r\nA little beyond where the bull had stood, he came upon the headless shaft\r\nof his arrow. As he stooped and caught it up, he saw one of the fleeing\r\nanimals fall. When he came up with the dead bull, his first act was to\r\nrecover his arrow-tip and cut out the flesh around the wound. Provided\r\nonly with his weak-bladed knife, he found it no easy task to butcher\r\nso large a beast. Though he had now acquired considerable dexterity in\r\nthe art, noon had passed before he brought the first load of meat up the\r\ncleft.\r\n\r\nSo great was the abundance of meat that Blake worked all the remainder\r\nof the day and all night stringing the flesh on the curing racks, and\r\nMiss Leslie tried out pot after pot of fat and tallow, until every spare\r\nvessel was filled, and she had to resort to a hollow in the rock beside\r\nthe spring. Blake promised to make more pots as soon as he could fetch\r\nthe clay, but he had first to dress the eland hide, and prepare a new\r\nstock of thread and cord from parts of the animal which he was careful\r\nnot to let her see.\r\n\r\nWhatever their concern for the future,--and even Blake's was keen and\r\nbitter,--the party, as a party, for the time being might have been\r\nconsidered extremely fortunate. They had a shelter secure alike from\r\nthe weather and from wild beasts; an abundance of nutritious food, and,\r\nas material for clothing, the bushbuck, hyena, and eland hides. To\r\nobtain more skins and more meat Blake now knew would be a simple matter\r\nso long as he had enough poison left in the cigarette case to moisten\r\nthe tips of his arrows.\r\n\r\nEven Winthrope's relapse proved far less serious than might reasonably\r\nhave been expected. The fever soon left him, and within a few days he\r\nregained strength enough to care for himself. Here, however, much to\r\nBlake's perplexity and concern, his progress seemed to stop, and all\r\nBlake's urging could do no more than cause him to move languidly from\r\none shady spot to another. He would receive Blake's orders with a smile\r\nand a drawling \"Ya-as, to be sure!\"--and would then absolutely ignore\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nOnly in two ways did the invalid exhibit any signs of energy. He could\r\nand did eat with a heartiness little short of that shown by Blake,\r\nand he would insist upon seeking opportunities to press his attentions\r\nupon Miss Leslie. He was careful to avoid all offensive remarks; yet\r\nthe veriest commonplace from his lips was now an offence to the girl.\r\nWhile he needed her as nurse, she had endured his talk as part of her\r\nduty. But now she felt that she could no longer do so. Taking advantage\r\nof a time when the Englishman was, as she supposed, enjoying a noonday\r\nsiesta down towards the barricade, she went to meet Blake, who had\r\nbeen up on the cliff for eggs.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" he sang out, as he swung down the tree, one hand gripping the\r\nclay pot in which he had gathered the eggs. \"What you doing out in the\r\nsun? Get into the shade.\"\r\n\r\nShe stepped into the shade, and waited until he had climbed down the pile\r\nof stones which he had built for steps at the foot of the tree.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blake,\" she began, \"could not I do this work,--gather the eggs?\"\r\n\r\n\"You could, if I'd let you, Miss Jenny. But it strikes me you've got\r\nquite enough to do. Tell you the truth, I'd like to make Win take it\r\nin hand again. But all my cussing won't budge him an inch, and you know,\r\nwhen it comes to the rub, I couldn't wallop a fellow who can hardly\r\nstand up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he really so weak?\" she murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know how-- Say, you don't mean that you think he's\r\nshamming?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not say that I thought so, Mr. Blake. I do not care to talk about\r\nhim. What I wish is that you will let me attend to this work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't think of it, Miss Jenny! You're already doing your share.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blake,--if you must know,--I wish to have a place where I can go\r\nand be apart--alone.\"\r\n\r\nBlake scowled. \"Alone with that dude! He'd soon find enough strength to\r\nclimb up with you on the cliff.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--ah--Mr. Blake, would he be apt to follow me, if I told you\r\ndistinctly I should rather be alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would he? Well, I should rather guess not!\" cried Blake, making no\r\nattempt to conceal his delight. \"I'll give him a hint that'll make\r\nhis hair curl. From now on, nobody climbs up this tree but you, without\r\nfirst asking your permission.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Blake! You are very kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kind to let you do more work! But say, I'll help out all I can on the\r\nother work. You know, Miss Jenny,--a rough fellow like me don't know\r\nhow to say it, but he can think it just the same,--I'd do anything in\r\nthe world for you!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he held out his rough, powerful hand. She shrank back a\r\nlittle, and caught her breath in sudden fright. But when she met his\r\nsteady gaze, her fear left her as quickly as it had come. She impulsively\r\nthrust out her hand, and he seized it in a grip that brought the tears\r\nto her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Jenny! Miss Jenny!\" he murmured, utterly unconscious that he was\r\nhurting her, \"you know now that I'm your friend, Miss Jenny!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Blake,\" she answered, blushing and drawing her hand free.\r\n\"I believe you are a friend--I believe I can trust you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can, by--Jiminy! But say,\" he continued, blundering with dense\r\nstupidity, \"do you really mean that? Can you forgive me for being so\r\nconfounded meddlesome, the other day, after the snake--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, for upon the instant she was facing him, as on that\r\neventful day, scarlet with shame and anger.\r\n\r\n\"How dare you speak of it?\" she cried. \"You're--you're not a\r\ngentleman!\"\r\n\r\nBefore he could reply, she turned and left him, walking rapidly and with\r\nher head held high. Blake stared after her in bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what in--what in thunder have I done now?\" he exclaimed.\r\n\"Ladies are certainly mighty funny! To go off at a touch--and just\r\nwhen I thought we were going to be chums! But then, of course, I've\r\nthe whole thing to learn about nice girls--like her!\"\r\n\r\n\"I--ah--must certainly agree with you there, Blake,\" drawled Winthrope,\r\nfrom beside the nearest bush.\r\n\r\nBlake turned upon him with savage fury: \"You dirty sneak!--you\r\n_gentleman!_ You've been eavesdropping!\"\r\n\r\nThe Englishman's yellow face paled to a sallow mottled gray. He had seen\r\nthe same look in Blake's eyes twice before, and this time Blake was far\r\nmore angry.\r\n\r\n\"You sneak!--you sham gent!\" repeated the American, his voice sinking\r\nominously.\r\n\r\nWinthrope dropped in an abject heap, as though Blake had struck him with\r\nhis club.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" he protested shrilly. \"I am a real--I am--I'm a not--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it--you're a not! That's true!\" broke in Blake, with sudden\r\ngrim humor. \"You're a nothing. A fellow can't even wipe his shoes on\r\nnothing!\"\r\n\r\nThe change to sarcasm came as an immense relief to Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I say now, Blake,\" he drawled, pulling together his assurance the\r\ninstant the dangerous light left Blake's eyes, \"I say now, do you think\r\nit fair to pick on a man who is so much your--er--who is ill and weak?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it--do the baby act,\" jeered Blake. \"But say, I don't\r\nknow just how much eavesdropping you did; so there's one thing I'll\r\nrepeat for the special benefit of your ludship. It'll be good for your\r\ndelicate health to pay attention. From now on, the cliff top belongs to\r\nMiss Leslie. Gents and book agents not allowed. Understand? You don't\r\ngo up there without her special invite. If you do, I'll twist your\r\ndamned neck!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned on his heel, and left the Englishman cowering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nAN OMINOUS LULL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three saw nothing more of each other that day. Miss Leslie had\r\nwithdrawn into the baobab, and Blake had gone off down the cleft for\r\nmore salt. He did not return until after the others were asleep. Miss\r\nLeslie had gone without her supper, or had eaten some of the food stored\r\nwithin the tree.\r\n\r\nWhen, late the next morning, she finally left her seclusion, Blake was\r\nnowhere in sight. Ignoring Winthrope's attempts to start a conversation,\r\nshe hurried through her breakfast, and having gathered a supply of food\r\nand water, went to spend the day on the headland.\r\n\r\nEvening forced her to return to the cleft. She had emptied the water\r\nflask by noon, and was thirsty. Winthrope was dozing beneath his canopy,\r\nwhich Blake had moved some yards down towards the barricade. Blake was\r\ncooking supper.\r\n\r\nHe did not look up, and met her attempt at a pleasant greeting with an\r\ninarticulate grunt. When she turned to enter the baobab, she found the\r\nopening littered with bamboos and green creepers and pieces of large\r\nbranches with charred ends. On either side, midway through the entrance,\r\na vertical row of holes had been sunk through the bark of the tree into\r\nthe soft wood.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" she asked. \"Are you planning a porch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"But why should you make the holes so far in? I know so little about\r\nthese matters, but I should have fancied the holes would come on the\r\nfront of the tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll see in a day or two.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you make the holes? They look black, as though--\"\r\n\r\n\"Burnt 'em, of course--hot stones.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was so clever of you!\"\r\n\r\nHe made no response.\r\n\r\nSupper was eaten in silence. Even Winthrope's presence would have\r\nbeen a relief to the girl; yet she could not go to waken him, or even\r\nsuggest that her companion do so. Blake sat throughout the meal sullen\r\nand stolid, and carefully avoided meeting her gaze. Before they had\r\nfinished, twilight had come and gone, and night was upon them. Yet\r\nshe lingered for a last attempt.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, friend!\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nHe sprang up as though she had struck him, and blundered away into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nIn the morning it was as before. He had gone off before she wakened. She\r\nlingered over breakfast; but he did not appear, and she could not endure\r\nWinthrope's suave drawl. She went for another day on the headland.\r\n\r\nShe returned somewhat earlier than on the previous day. As before,\r\nWinthrope was dozing in the shade. But Blake was under the baobab, raking\r\ntogether a heap of rubbish. His hands were scratched and bleeding. To the\r\ngirl's surprise, he met her with a cheerful grin and a clear, direct\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" he called.\r\n\r\nShe stepped around the baobab, and stood staring. The entrance, from the\r\nground to the height of twelve feet, was walled up with a mass of thorny\r\nbranches, interwoven with yet thornier creepers.\r\n\r\n\"How's that for a front door?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Door?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's so big. I could never move it.\"\r\n\r\n\"A child could. Look.\" He grasped a projecting handle near the bottom\r\nof the thorny mass. The lower half of the door swung up and outward, the\r\nupper half in and downward. \"See; it's balanced on a crossbar in the\r\nmiddle. Come on in.\"\r\n\r\nShe walked after him in under the now horizontal door. He gave the inner\r\nend a light upward thrust, and the door swung back in its vertical\r\ncircle until it again stood upright in the opening. From the inside the\r\ngirl could see the strong framework to which was lashed the facing of\r\nthorns. It was made of bamboo and strong pieces of branches, bound\r\ntogether with tough creepers.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty good grating, eh?\" remarked Blake. \"When those green creepers\r\ndry, they'll shrink and hold tight as iron clamps. Even now nothing\r\nshort of a rhinoceros could walk through when the bars are fast. See\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped up to the novel door, and slid several socketed crossbars\r\nuntil their outer ends were deep in the holes in the tree trunk, three\r\non each side.\r\n\r\n\"How's that for a set of bolts?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful! Really, you are very, very clever! But why should you go\r\nto all this trouble, when the barricade--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, it's best to be on the safe side.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it's absurd for you to go to all this needless work. Not that I do\r\nnot appreciate your kind thought for my safety. Yet look at your hands!\"\r\n\r\nBlake hastened to put his bleeding hands behind him.\r\n\r\n\"They are no sight for a lady!\" he muttered apologetically.\r\n\r\n\"Go and wash them at once, and I'll put on a dressing.\"\r\n\r\nBlake glowed with frank pleasure, yet shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you, Miss Jenny. You needn't bother. They'll do all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must! It would please me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, of course-- But first, I want to make sure you understand\r\nfastening the door. Try the bars yourself.\"\r\n\r\nShe obeyed, sliding the bars in and out until he nodded his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" he said. \"Now promise me you'll slide 'em fast every night.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you ask it. But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to make perfectly safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Safe? But am I not secure with--\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Miss Leslie; I'm not going to say anything about anybody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you had better say no more, Mr. Blake.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. But whatever happens, you'll believe I've done my\r\nbest, won't you?--even if I'm not a-- Promise me straight, you'll\r\nlock up tight every night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I promise,\" responded the girl, not a little troubled by\r\nthe strangeness of his expression.\r\n\r\nHe turned at once, swung open the door, and went out. During supper he\r\nwas markedly taciturn, and immediately afterwards went off to his bed.\r\n\r\nThat night Miss Leslie dutifully fastened herself in with all six bars.\r\nShe wakened at dawn, and hastened out to prepare Blake's breakfast, but\r\nshe found herself too late. There were evidences that he had eaten and\r\ngone off before dawn. The stretching frame of one of the antelope skins\r\nhad been moved around by the fire, and on the smooth inner surface of\r\nthe hide was a laconic note, written with charcoal in a firm, bold hand:--\r\n\r\n\"_Exploring inland. Back by night, if can_.\"\r\n\r\nShe bit her lip in her disappointment, for she had planned to show him\r\nhow much she appreciated his absurd but well-meant concern for her\r\nsafety. As it was, he had gone off without a word, and left her to\r\nthe questionable pleasure of a _tête-à-tête_ with Winthrope. Hoping to\r\navoid this, she hurried her preparations for a day on the cliff. But\r\nbefore she could get off, Winthrope sauntered up, hiding his yawns behind\r\na hand which had regained most of its normal plumpness. His eye was at\r\nonce caught by the charcoal note.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he drawled; \"really now, this is too kind of him to give us the\r\npleasure of his absence all day!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye-es!\" murmured Miss Leslie. \"Permit me to add that you will also\r\nhave the pleasure of my absence. I am going now.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope looked down, and began to speak very rapidly: \"Miss Genevieve,\r\nI--I wish to apologize. I've thought it over. I've made a mistake--I--I\r\nmean, my conduct the other day was vile, utterly vile! Permit me to\r\nappeal to your considerateness for a man who has been unfortunate--who,\r\nI mean, has been--er--was carried away by his feelings. Your favoring\r\nof that bloom--er--that--er--bounder so angered me that I--that I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Winthrope!\" interrupted the girl, \"I will have you to understand\r\nthat you do not advance yourself in my esteem by such references to Mr.\r\nBlake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye! aye, that Blake!\" panted Winthrope. \"Don't you see? It's 'im,\r\nan' that blossom! W'en a man's daffy--w'en 'e's in love!--\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie burst into a nervous laugh; but checked herself on the\r\ninstant.\r\n\r\n\"Really, Mr. Winthrope!\" she exclaimed, \"you must pardon me. I--I\r\nnever knew that cultured Englishmen ever dropped their h's. As it\r\nhappens, you know, I never saw one excited before this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes; to be sure--to be sure!\" murmured Winthrope, in an odd tone.\r\n\r\nThe girl threw out her hand in a little gesture of protest.\r\n\r\n\"Really, I'm sorry to have hurt--to have been so thoughtless!\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope stood silent. She spoke again: \"I'll do what you ask. I'll\r\nmake allowances for your--for your feelings towards me, and will try\r\nto forget all you said the other day. Let me begin by asking a favor of\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Miss Genevieve, anything, to be sure, that I may do!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is that I wish your opinion. When Mr. Blake finished that absurd\r\ndoor last evening, he would not tell me why he had built it--only a vague\r\nstatement about my safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! He did not go into particulars?\" drawled Winthrope.\r\n\r\n\"No, not even a hint; and he looked so--odd.\"\r\n\r\nWinthrope slowly rubbed his soft palms on upon the other.\r\n\r\n\"Do you--er--really desire to know his--the motive which actuated him?\"\r\nhe murmured.\r\n\r\n\"I should not have mentioned it to you, if I did not,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well--er--\" He hesitated and paused for a full minute. \"You see,\r\nit is a rather difficult undertaking to intimate such a matter to a\r\nlady--just the right touch of delicacy, you know. But I will begin by\r\nexplaining that I have known it since the first--\"\r\n\r\n\"Known what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of that bound--of--er--Blake's trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Perhaps I should have said affliction; yes, that is the better\r\nword. To own the truth, the fellow has some good qualities. It was no\r\ndoubt because he realised, when in his better moments--\"\r\n\r\n\"Better moments? Mr. Winthrope, I am not a child. In justice both to\r\nmyself and to Mr. Blake, I must ask you to speak out plainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Miss Leslie, may I first ask if you have not observed how\r\nstrangely at times the fellow acts,--'looks odd,' as you put it,--how\r\nhe falls into melancholia or senseless rages? I may truthfully state\r\nthat he has three times threatened my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I thought his anger quite natural, after I had so rudely--and so\r\nmany people are given to brooding-- But if he was violent to you--\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Miss Genevieve, I hold nothing against the miserable fellow. At\r\nsuch times he is not--er--responsible, you know. Let us give the fellow\r\nfull credit--that is why he himself built your door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I can't believe it! I can't believe it!\" cried the girl.\r\n\"It's not possible! He's so strong, so true and manly, so kind, for\r\nall his gruffness!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my dear!\" soothed Winthrope, \"that is the pity of it. But when\r\na man must needs be his worst enemy, when he must needs lead a certain\r\nkind of life, he must take the consequences. To put it as delicately as\r\npossible, yet explain all, I need only say one word--paranoia.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie gathered up her day's outfit with trembling fingers, and\r\nwent to mount the cliff.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a few minutes Winthrope walked hurriedly through the cleft,\r\nand climbed the tree-ladder with an agility that would have amazed his\r\ncompanions. But he did not draw himself up on the cliff. Having satisfied\r\nhimself that Miss Leslie was well out toward the signal, he returned to\r\nthe baobab, and proceeded to examine Blake's door with minute scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThat evening, shortly before dark, Blake came in almost exhausted by his\r\njourney. Few men could have covered the same ground in twice the time. It\r\nhad been one continuous round of grass jungle, thorn scrub, rocks, and\r\nswamp. And for all his pains, he brought back with him nothing more\r\nthan the discouraging information that the back-country was worse\r\nthan the shore. Yet he betrayed no trace of depression over the bad\r\nnews, and for all his fatigue, maintained a tone of hearty cheerfulness\r\nuntil, having eaten his fill, he suddenly observed Miss Leslie's\r\nfrigid politeness.\r\n\r\n\"What's up now?\" he demanded. \"You're not mad 'cause I hiked off\r\nthis morning without notice?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, of course not, Mr. Blake. Nothing of the kind. But I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,-what?\" he broke in, as she hesitated. \"I can't, for the world,\r\nthink of anything else I've done--\"\r\n\r\n\"You've done! Perhaps I might suggest that it is a question of what\r\nyou haven't done.\" The girl was trembling on the verge of hysterics.\r\n\"Yes, what you've not done! All these weeks, and not a single attempt\r\nto get us away from here, except that miserable signal; and I as good as\r\nput that up! You call yourself a man! But I--I--\" She stopped short,\r\nwhite with a sudden overpowering fear.\r\n\r\nWinthrope looked from her to Blake with a sidelong glance, his lips drawn\r\nup in an odd twist.\r\n\r\nThere followed several moments of tense silence; then Blake mumbled\r\napologetically: \"Well, I suppose I might have done more. I was so dead\r\nanxious to make sure of food and shelter. But this trip to-day--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr.--Mr. Blake, pray do not get excited--I--I mean, please excuse me.\r\nI'm--\"\r\n\r\n\"You're coming down sick!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"No, no! I have no fever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it's the sun. Yet you ought to keep up there where the air is\r\nfreshest. I'll make you a shade.\"\r\n\r\nShe protested, and withdrew, somewhat hurriedly, to her tree.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Blake was gone again; but instead of a note, beside\r\nthe fire stood the smaller antelope skin, converted into a great\r\nbamboo-ribbed sunshade.\r\n\r\nShe spent the day as usual on the headland. There was no wind, and the\r\nsun was scorching hot. But with her big sunshade to protect her from the\r\ndirect rays, the heat was at least endurable. She even found energy to\r\nwork at a basket which she was attempting to weave out of long, coarse\r\ngrass; yet there were frequent intervals when her hands sank idle in\r\nher lap, and she gazed away over the shimmering glassy expanse of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the heat became oppressively sultry, and a long slow\r\nswell began to roll shoreward from beyond the distant horizon, showing\r\nno trace of white along its oily crests until they broke over the coral\r\nreefs. There was not a breath of air stirring, and for a time the reefs\r\nso checked the rollers that they lacked force to drive on in and break\r\nupon the beach.\r\n\r\nSteadily, however, the swell grew heavier, though not so much as a\r\ncat's-paw ruffled the dead surfaces of the watery hillocks. By sunset\r\nthey were rolling high over both lines of reefs and racing shoreward to\r\nbreak upon the beach and the cliff foot in furious surf. The still air\r\nreverberated with the booming of the breakers. Yet the girl, inland bred\r\nand unversed in weather lore, sat heedless and indifferent, her eyes\r\nfixed upon the horizon in a vacant stare.\r\n\r\nHer reverie was at last disturbed by the peculiar behavior of the\r\nseafowl. Those in the air circled around in a manner strange to her,\r\nwhile their mates on the ledges waddled restlessly about over and between\r\ntheir nests. There was a shriller note than usual in their discordant\r\nclamor.\r\n\r\nYet even when she gave heed to the birds, the girl failed to realize\r\ntheir alarm or to sense the impending danger. It was only that a feeling\r\nof disquiet had broken the spell of her reverie; it did not obtrude\r\nupon the field of her conscious thought. She sighed, and rose to return\r\nto the cleft, idly wondering that the air should seem more sultry than at\r\nmid-day. The peculiar appearance of the sun and the western sky meant\r\nnothing more to her than an odd effect of color and light. She smilingly\r\ncompared it with an attempt at a sunset painted by an artist friend of\r\nthe impressionist school.\r\n\r\nNeither Winthrope nor Blake was in sight when she reached the baobab,\r\nand neither appeared, though she delayed supper until dark. It was quite\r\npossible that they had eaten before her return and had gone off again,\r\nthe Englishman to doze, and Blake on an evening hunt.\r\n\r\nAt last, tired of waiting, she covered the fire, and retired into her\r\ntree-cave. The air in the cleft was still more stifling than on the\r\nheadland. She paused, with her hand upraised to close the swinging\r\ndoor. She had propped it open when she came out in the morning. After a\r\nmoment's hesitation, she went on across the hollow, leaving the door\r\nwide open.\r\n\r\n\"I will rest a little, and close it later,\" she sighed. She was feeling\r\nweary and depressed.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed. An ominous stillness lay upon the cleft. Even the\r\ncicadas had hushed their shrill note. The only sound was a muffled\r\nreverberating echo of the surf roaring upon the seashore. Beneath the\r\ngiant spread of the baobab all was blackness.\r\n\r\nSomething moved in a bush a little way down the cleft. A crouching figure\r\nappeared, dimly outlined in the starlight. The figure crept stealthily\r\nacross into the denser night of the baobab. The darkness closed about\r\nit like a shroud.\r\n\r\nA blinding flash of light pierced the blackness. The figure halted\r\nand crouched lower, though the flash had gone again in a fraction of\r\na second. A dull rumbling mingled with the ceaseless boom of the surf.\r\n\r\nA second flash lighted the cleft with its dazzling coruscation. This time\r\nthe creeping figure did not halt.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the forked lightning streaked across the sky, every\r\nstroke more vivid than the one before. The rumble of the distant thunder\r\ndeepened to a heavy rolling which dominated the dull roar of the\r\nbreakers. The storm was coming with the on-rush of a tornado. Yet\r\nthe leaves hung motionless in the still air, and there was no sound\r\nother than the thunder and the booming of the surf.\r\n\r\nThe lightning flared, one stroke upon the other, with a brilliancy that\r\nlit up the cave's interior brighter than at mid-day.\r\n\r\nIn the white glare the girl saw Winthrope, crouched beneath her upswung\r\ndoor; and his face was as the face of a beast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE HURRICANE BLAST\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment that seemed a moment of eternity, she lay on her bed,\r\nstaring into the blank darkness. The storm burst with a crashing uproar\r\nthat brought her to her feet, with a shriek. Her giant tree creaked\r\nand strained under the impact of the terrific hurricane blasts that\r\ncame howling through the cleft like a rout of shrieking fiends. The\r\npeals of thunder merged into one continuous roar, beneath which the\r\nsolid ledges of rock jarred and quivered. The sky was a pall of black\r\nclouds, meshed with a dazzling network of forked lightning.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood motionless, stunned by the uproar, appalled by the\r\nblinding glare of the thunder-bolts; yet even more fearful of the\r\nfigure which every flash showed her still lurking beneath the door.\r\nA gust-borne bough struck with numbing force against her upraised arm.\r\nBut she took no heed. She was unaware of the swirl of rain and sticks\r\nand leaves that was driving in through the open entrance.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden the door shook free from its props and whirled violently\r\naround on its balance-bar. There was a shriek that pierced above the\r\nshrilling of the cyclone,--a single human shriek.\r\n\r\nThe girl sprang across the cave. The heavy door swished up before her\r\nand down again, its lower edge all but grazing her face. For a moment\r\nit stopped in a vertical position, and hung quivering, like a beast about\r\nto leap upon its prey. Too excited to comprehend the danger of the act,\r\nthe girl sprang forward and shot one of the thick bars into its socket.\r\n\r\nA fierce gust leaped against the outer face of the door and thrust in\r\nupon it, striving to burst it bodily from its bearings. The top and the\r\nfree side of the bottom bowed in. But the branches were still green\r\nand tough, the bamboo like whalebone, and the shrunken creepers held\r\nthe frame together as though the joints were lashed with wire rope.\r\nFailing to smash in the elastic structure, or to snap the crossbar, it\r\nwere as if the blast flung itself alternately against the top and bottom\r\nin a fierce attempt to again whirl the frame about. The white glare\r\nstreaming in through the interstices showed the girl her opportunity.\r\nShe grasped another bar and shot it into its socket as the lower part of\r\nthe door gave back with the shifting of the pressure to the top. It was\r\nthen a simple matter to slide the remaining bars into the deep-sunk\r\nholes. Within half a minute she had made the door fast, from the first\r\nbar to the sixth.\r\n\r\nA heavy spray was beating in upon her through the chinks of the\r\nframework. She drew back and sought shelter in a niche at the side.\r\nNarrow as was the slit above the top of the door, it let in a torrent of\r\nwater, which spouted clear across and against the far wall of the cave.\r\nIt gushed down upon her bed and was already flooding the cave floor.\r\n\r\nShe piled higher the cocoanuts stored in her niche, and perched herself\r\nupon the heap to keep above the water. But even in her sheltered corner\r\nthe eddying wind showered her with spray. She waded across for her\r\nskin-covered sunshade, and returned to huddle beneath it, in the still\r\nmisery and terror of a hunted animal that has crept wounded into a hole.\r\n\r\nDuring the first hurricane there had been companions to whom she could\r\nlook for help and comfort, and she had been to a degree unaware of the\r\ngreatness of the danger. But in the few short weeks since, she had caught\r\nmore than one glimpse of Primeval Nature,--she of the bloody fang, blind,\r\nremorseless, insensate, destroying, ever destroying.\r\n\r\nTrue, this was on solid land, while before there had been the peril\r\nof the sea. But now the girl was alone. Outside the straining walls of\r\nher refuge, the hurricane yelled and shrieked and roared,--a headless,\r\nformless monster, furious to burst in upon her, to overthrow her stanch\r\nold tree giant, that in his fall his shattered trunk might crush and\r\nmangle her. Or at any instant a thunder-bolt might rend open the great\r\ntower of living wood, and hurl her blackened body into the pool on the\r\ncave floor.\r\n\r\nOnce she fancied that she heard Blake shouting outside the door; but\r\nwhen she screamed a shrill response, the blast mocked her with echoing\r\nshrieks, and she dared not venture to free the door. If it were Blake, he\r\ndid not shout again. After a time she began to think that the sound\r\nhad been no more than a freak of the shifting wind. Yet the thought of\r\nhim out in the full fury of the cyclone served to turn her thoughts from\r\nher own danger. She prayed aloud for his safety, beseeching her God\r\nthat he be spared. She sought to pray even for Winthrope. But the vision\r\nof that beastly face rose up before her, and she could not--then.\r\n\r\nPresently she became aware of a change in the storm. The terrific\r\ngusts blew with yet greater violence, the thunder crashed heavier,\r\nthe lightning filled the air with a flame of dazzling white light. But\r\nthe rain no longer gushed across on the spot where her bed had been.\r\nIt was entering at a different angle, and its force was broken by the\r\nbend in the thick wall of the entrance. After a time the deluge dashed\r\naslant the entrance, gushing down the door in a cataract of foam.\r\n\r\nAnother interval, and the driving downpour no longer struck even the\r\nedge of the opening. The wind was veering rapidly as the cyclone centre\r\nmoved past on one side. The area of the hurricane was little more than\r\nthrice that of a tornado, and it was advancing along its course at\r\ngreat speed. An hour more, and the outermost rim of the huge whirl\r\nwas passing over the cleft.\r\n\r\nQuickly the hurricane gusts fell away to a gale; the gale became a\r\nbreeze; the breeze lulled and died away, stifled by the torrential rain.\r\n\r\nWithin the baobab all was again dark and silent. Utterly exhausted, the\r\ngirl had sunk back against the friendly wall of the tree, and fallen\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nShe was wakened by a hoarse call: \"Miss Jenny! Miss Jenny, answer me!\r\nAre you all right?\"\r\n\r\nShe started up, barely saving herself from a fall as the big unhusked\r\nnuts rolled beneath her feet. The morning sunlight was streaming in over\r\nher door. She sprang down ankle-deep into the mire of the cave floor,\r\nand ran to loosen the bars. As the door swung up, she darted out, with a\r\ncry of delight: \"You are safe--safe! Oh, I was so afraid for you! But\r\nyou're drenched! You must build a fire--dry yourself--at once!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" said Blake. \"I've got to tell you something.\"\r\n\r\nHe caught her outstretched hands, and pushed them down with gentle force.\r\nHis face was grave, almost solemn.\r\n\r\n\"Think you can stand bad news--a shock?\"\r\n\r\n\"I-- What is it? You look so strange!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's about Winthrope,--something very bad--\"\r\n\r\nShe turned, with a gasp, and hid her face in her hands, shuddering with\r\nhorror and loathing.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! oh!\" she cried, \"I know already--I know all!\"\r\n\r\n\"All?\" demanded Blake, staring blankly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; all! And--and he made me think it was you!\" She gasped, and fell\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nBlake's face went white. He spoke in a clear, vibrant voice, tense as an\r\noverstrained violin string: \"I am speaking about Winthrope--understand\r\nme?--Winthrope. He has been badly hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"The door swung down and struck him, when he was creeping in.\"\r\n\r\n\"God!\" roared Blake. \"I picked him up like a sick baby--the\r\nbeast!--'stead of grinding my heel in his face! God! I'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom! don't--don't even speak it! Tom!\"\r\n\r\n\"God! When a helpless girl--when a --!\" He choked, beside himself with\r\nrage.\r\n\r\nShe sprang to him, and caught his sleeve in a convulsive grasp. \"Hush,\r\nfor mercy's sake! Tom Blake, remember--you're a man!\"\r\n\r\nHe calmed like a ferocious dog at the voice of its master; but it was\r\nseveral minutes before he could bring himself to obey her insistent\r\nurging that he should return to the injured man.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go,\" he at last growled. \"Wouldn't do it even for you, but\r\nhe's good as dead--lucky for him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dying. . . . . You stay away.\"\r\n\r\nHe went around the baobab and a few paces along the cleft to the place\r\nwhere a limp form lay huddled on the ledges, out of the mud. Slowly, as\r\nthough drawn by the fascination of horror, the girl crept after him.\r\nWhen she saw the broken, storm-beaten thing that had been Winthrope,\r\nshe stopped, and would have turned back. After all, as Blake had said,\r\nhe was dying--\r\n\r\nWhen she stood at the feet of the writhing figure, and looked down into\r\nthe battered face, it required all her will-power to keep from fainting.\r\nBlake frowned up at her for an instant, but said nothing.\r\n\r\nWinthrope was speaking, feebly and brokenly, yet distinctly: \"Really, I\r\ndid not mean any harm--at first--you know. But a man does not always have\r\ncontrol--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a beast like you!\" growled Blake.\r\n\r\n\"Ow! Don't 'it me! I say now, I'm done for! My legs are cold\r\nalready--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, quick, Mr. Blake! build a fire! It may be, some hot broth--\"\r\n\r\n\"Too late,\" muttered Blake. \"See here, Winthrope, there's no use\r\nlying about it. You're going out mighty soon. See if you can't die\r\nlike a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Die! . . . Gawd, but I can't die--I can't die--Ow! it burns!\"\r\n\r\nHe flung up a hand, and sought to tear at his wounds.\r\n\r\n\"Hold hard!\" cried Blake, catching the hand in an iron grip.\r\n\r\nSomething in his touch, or the tone of command, seemed to cower the\r\nwretched man into a state of abject submission.\r\n\r\n\"S'elp me, I'll confess!--I'll confess all!\" he babbled. \"The\r\nstones are sewed in the stomach pad; I 'ad to take 'em hout of their\r\nsettings, and melt up the gold.\" He paused, and a cunning smile stole\r\nover his distorted features. \"Ho, wot a bloomin' lark! Valet plays the\r\ngent, an' they never 'as a hinkling! Mr. Cecil Winthrope, hif you\r\nplease, an' a 'int of a title--wot a lark! 'Awkings, me lad, you're\r\na gay 'oaxer! Wot a lark! wot a lark!\"\r\n\r\nAgain there was a pause. The breath of the wounded man came in labored\r\ngasps. There was an ominous rattling in his throat. Yet once again he\r\nrallied, and this time his eyes turned to Miss Leslie, bright with an\r\nagonized consciousness of her presence and of all his guilt and shame.\r\n\r\nHis voice shrilled out in quavering appeal: \"Don't--don't look at me,\r\nmiss! I tried to make myself a gentleman; God knows I tried! I fought\r\nmy way up out of the East End--out of that hell--and none ever lifted\r\nfinger to help me. I educated myself like a scholar--then the stock\r\nsharks cheated me of my savings--out of the last penny; and I had to\r\ntake service. My God! a valet--his Grace's valet, and I a scholar! Do\r\nyou wonder the devil got into me? Do you--\"\r\n\r\nBlake's deep voice, firm but strangely husky, broke in upon and silenced\r\nthe cry of agony: \"There, I guess you've said enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough!--and last night--My God! to be such a beast! The devil tempted\r\nme--aye, and he's paid me out in my own coin! I'm done for! God ha'\r\nmercy on me!--God ha' mercy--\"\r\n\r\nAgain came the gasping rattle; this time there was no rally.\r\n\r\nBlake thrust himself between Miss Leslie and the crumpled figure.\r\n\r\n\"Get back around the tree,\" he said harshly.\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my business,\" he replied. He thrust his burning-glass into\r\nher hand. \"Here; go and build a fire, if you can find any dry stuff.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not going to-- You'll bury him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Whatever he may have been, he's dead now, poor devil!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't go,\" she half whispered, \"not until--until I've learned--\r\nDo you--can you tell me just what is paranoia?\"\r\n\r\nBlake studied a little, and tapped the top of his head.\r\n\r\n\"Near as I can say, it's softening of the brain.--up there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think that--\" she hesitated--\"that he had it?\"\r\n\r\nAgain Blake paused to consider.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm no alienist. I thought him a softy from the first. But\r\nthat was all in line with what he was playing on us--British dude.\r\nFooled me, and I'd been chumming with Jimmy Scarbridge,--and Jimmy\r\nwas the straight goods, fresh imported--monocle even--when I first ran up\r\nagainst him. No; this--this Hawkins, if that's his name, had brains\r\nall right. Still, he may have been cracked. When folks go dotty, they\r\nsometimes get extra 'cute. The best I can think of him is that losing\r\nhis savings may have made him slip a cog, and then the scare over the\r\nway we landed here and his spells of fever probably hurried up the\r\nsoftening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you believe his story?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do. But if you'll go, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"One thing more--I must know now! Do you remember the day when you set\r\nup the signal, and you--you quarrelled with him?\"\r\n\r\nBlake reddened, and dropped his gaze. \"Did he go and tell you that? The\r\nsneak!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, let us say nothing more about him. But would you care\r\nto tell me what you meant--what you said then?\"\r\n\r\nBlake's flush deepened; but he raised his head, and faced her squarely\r\nas he answered: \"No; I'm not going to repeat any dead man's talk; and\r\nas for what I said, this isn't the time or place to say anything in\r\nthat line--now that we're alone. Understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I do not, Mr. Blake. Please explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask me, Miss Jenny. I can't tell you now. You'll have to wait\r\ntill we get aboard ship. We'll catch a steamer before long. 'T isn't\r\nevery one of them that goes ashore in these blows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you build that door? Did you suspect--\" She glanced down at\r\nthe huddled figure between them.\r\n\r\nBlake frowned and hesitated; then burst out almost angrily: \"Well, you\r\nknow now he was a sneak; so it's not blabbing to tell that much--I knew\r\nhe was before; and it's never safe to trust a sneak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!\" she said, and she turned away quickly that she might not\r\nagain look at the prostrate figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nWRECKAGE AND SALVAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the wood in the cleft was sodden from the fierce downpour that had\r\naccompanied the cyclone; all the cleft bottom other than the bare ledges\r\nwas a bed of mud; everything without the tree-cave had been either blown\r\naway or heaped with broken boughs and mud-spattered rubbish. But the girl\r\nhad far too much to think about to feel any concern over the mere damage\r\nand destruction of things. It was rather a relief to find something that\r\ncalled for work.\r\n\r\nNot being able to find dry fuel, she gathered a quantity of the least\r\nsodden of the twigs and branches, and spread them out on a ledge in the\r\nclear sunshine. While her firewood was drying, she scraped away the mud\r\nand litter heaped upon her rude hearth. She then began a search for lost\r\narticles. When she dug out the pottery ware, she found her favorite\r\nstew-pot and one of the platters in fragments. The drying-frames for\r\nthe meat had been blown away, and so had the antelope and hyena skins.\r\n\r\nCatching sight of a bit of white down among the bamboos, she went to it,\r\nand was not a little surprised to see the tattered remnant of her duck\r\nskirt. It had evidently been torn from the signal staff by the first gust\r\nof the cyclone, whirled down into the cleft by some flaw or eddy in the\r\nwind, and wadded so tightly into the heart of the thick clump of stems\r\nthat all the fury of the storm had failed to dislodge it. Its recovery\r\nseemed to the girl a special providence; for of course they must keep up\r\na signal on the cliff.\r\n\r\nHaving started her fire and set on a stew, she hunted out her sewing\r\nmaterials from their crevice in the cave, and began mending the slits\r\nin the torn flag. While she worked she sat on a shaded ledge, her bare\r\nfeet toasting in the sun, and her soggy, mud-smeared moccasins drying\r\nwithin reach. When Blake appeared, the moccasins were still where she had\r\nfirst set them; but the little pink feet were safely tucked up beneath\r\nthe tattered flag. Fortunately, the sight of the white cloth prevented\r\nBlake from noticing the moccasins.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" he exclaimed. \"What's that?--the flag? Say, that's luck!\r\nI'll break out a bamboo right off. Old staff's carried clean away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blake,--just a moment, please. What have you done with--with it?\"\r\n\r\nBlake jerked his thumb upward.\r\n\r\n\"You have carried him up on the cliff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Best place I could think of. No animals--and I piled stones over....\r\nBut, I say, look here.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew out a piece of wadded cloth, marked off into little squares by\r\ncrossing lines of stitches. One of the squares near the edge had been\r\nripped open. Blake thrust in his finger, and worked out an emerald the\r\nsize of a large pea.\r\n\r\n\"O-h-h!\" cried Miss Leslie, as he held the glittering gem out to her\r\nin his rough palm.\r\n\r\nHe drew it back, and carefully thrust it again into its pocket.\r\n\r\n\"That's one,\" he said. \"There's another in every square of this\r\ninnocent, harmless rag--dozens of them. He must have made a clean sweep\r\nof the duke's--or, more like, the duchess's jewels. Now, if you please,\r\nI want you to sew this up tight again, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot--I cannot touch it!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"Say, I didn't mean to-- It was confounded stupid of me,\" mumbled\r\nBlake. \"Won't you excuse me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course! It was only the--the thought that--\"\r\n\r\n\"No wonder. I always am a fool when it comes to ladies. I'll fix the\r\nthing all right.\"\r\n\r\nCatching up the nearest small pot, he crammed the quilted cloth down\r\nwithin it, and filled it to the brim with sticky mud.\r\n\r\n\"There! Guess nobody's going to run off with a jug of mud--and it\r\nwon't hurt the stones till we get a chance to look up the owner. He\r\nwon't be hard to find--English duke minus a pint of first-class\r\nsparklers! Will you mind its setting in the cave after things are fixed\r\nup?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; not as it is.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded soberly. \"All right, then. Now I'll go for the new\r\nflag-staff. You might set out breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded in turn, and when he came back from the bamboos with the\r\nlargest of the great canes on his shoulder, his breakfast was waiting\r\nfor him. She set it before him, and turned to go again to her sewing.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on,\" he said. \"This won't do. You've got to eat your share.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not--I am not hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's no matter. Here!\"\r\n\r\nHe forced upon her a bowl of hot broth, and she drank it because she\r\ncould not resist his rough kindness.\r\n\r\n\"Good! Now a piece of meat,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Please, Mr. Blake!\" she protested.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you must!\"\r\n\r\nShe took a bite, and sought to eat; but there was such a lump in her\r\nthroat that she could not swallow. The tears gushed into her eyes, and\r\nshe began to weep.\r\n\r\nBlake's close-set lips relaxed, and he nodded.\r\n\r\n\"That's it; let it run out. You're overwrought. There's nothing like\r\na good cry to ease off a woman's nerves--and I guess ladies aren't\r\nmuch different from women when it comes to such things.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I--I want to get the flag mended!\" she sobbed.\r\n\r\n\"All right, all right; plenty of time!\" he soothed. \"I'm going to see\r\nhow things look down the cleft.\"\r\n\r\nHe bolted the last of his meat, and at once left her alone to cry\r\nherself back to calmness over the stitching of the signal.\r\n\r\nHis first concern was for the barricade. As he had feared, he found that\r\nit had been blown to pieces. The greater part of the thorn branches\r\nwhich he had gathered with so much labor were scattered to the four\r\ncorners of the earth. He stood staring at the wreckage in glum silence;\r\nbut he did not swear, as he would have done the week before. Presently\r\nhis face cleared, and he began to whistle in a plaintive minor key. He\r\nwas thinking of how she had looked when she darted out of the tree at\r\nhis call--of her concern for him. When he was so angered at Winthrope,\r\nshe had called him Tom!\r\n\r\nAfter a time he started on, picking his way over the remnant of the\r\nbarricade, without a falter in his whistling. The deluge of rain had\r\npoured down the cleft in a torrent, tearing away the root-matted soil\r\nand laying bare the ledges in the channel of the spring rill. But aside\r\nfrom an occasional boggy hole, the water had drained away.\r\n\r\nAt the foot, about the swollen pool, was a wide stretch of rubbish and\r\nmud. He worked his way around the edge, and came out on the plain, where\r\nthe sandy soil was all the firmer for its drenching. He swung away at a\r\nlively clip. The air was fresh and pure after the storm, and a slight\r\nbreeze tempered the sun-rays.\r\n\r\nHe kept on along the cliff until he turned the point. It was not\r\naltogether advisable to bathe at this time of day; but he had been caught\r\nout by the cyclone in a corner of the swamp, across the river, where the\r\nsoil was of clay. Only his anxiety for Miss Leslie had enabled him to\r\nfight his way out of the all but impassable morass which the storm\r\ndeluge had made of the half-dry swamp. At dawn he had reached the\r\nriver, and swam across, reckless of the crocodiles. The turbid water of\r\nthe stream had rid him of only part of his accumulated slime and\r\nooze. So now he washed out his tattered garments as well as he could\r\nwithout soap, and while they were drying on the sun-scorched rocks,\r\nswam about in the clear, tonic sea-water, quite as reckless of the\r\nsharks as he had been of the ugly crocodiles in the river.\r\n\r\nFor all this, he was back at the baobab before Miss Leslie had stitched\r\nup the last slit in the torn flag.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him, with a brave attempt at a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I'm not much of a needle-woman,\" she sighed. \"Look at\r\nthose stitches!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't fret. They'll hold all right, and that's what we want,\" he\r\nreassured her. \"Give it me, now. I've got to get it up, and hurry\r\nback for a nap. No sleep last night--I was out beyond the river, in\r\nthe swamp--and to-night I'll have to go on watch. The barricade is\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that is too bad! Couldn't I take a turn on watch?\"\r\n\r\nBlake shook his head. \"No; I'll sleep to-day, and work rebuilding the\r\nbarricade to-night. Toward morning I might build up the fire, and take a\r\nnap.\"\r\n\r\nHe caught up the flag and its new staff, and swung away through the cleft.\r\n\r\nHe returned much sooner than Miss Leslie expected, and at once began to\r\nthrow up a small lean-to of bamboos over a ledge at the cliff foot,\r\nbehind the baobab. The girl thought he was making himself a hut, in\r\nplace of the canopy under which he had slept before the storm, which,\r\nlike Winthrope's, had been carried away. But when he stopped work, he\r\nlaconically informed her that all she had to do to complete her new\r\nhouse was to dry some leaves.\r\n\r\n\"But I thought it was for yourself!\" she protested. \"I will sleep\r\ninside the tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doc Blake says no!\" he rejoined--\"not till it's dried out.\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced at his face, and replied, without a moment's hesitancy:\r\n\"Very well. I will do what you think best.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good,\" he said, and went at once to lie down for his much\r\nneeded sleep.\r\n\r\nHe awoke just soon enough before dark to see the results of her hard\r\nday's labor. All the provisions stored in the tree had been brought\r\nout to dry, and a great stack of fuel, ready for burning, was piled\r\nup against the baobab; while all about the tree the rubbish had been\r\nneatly gathered together in heaps. Blake looked his admiration for her\r\nindustry. But then his forehead wrinkled.\r\n\r\n\"You oughtn't to've done so much,\" he admonished.\r\n\r\n\"I'll show you I can tote fair!\" she rejoined. During the afternoon\r\nshe had called to mind that odd expression of a Southern girl chum, and\r\nhad been waiting her opportunity to banter him with it.\r\n\r\nHe stared at her open-eyed, and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Say, Miss Jenny, you'd better look out. You'll be speaking American,\r\nfirst thing!\"\r\n\r\nThereupon, they fell to chattering like children out of school, each\r\nhappy to be able to forget for the moment that broken figure up on the\r\ncliff top and the haunting fear of what another day might bring to them.\r\n\r\nWhen they had eaten their meal, both with keen appetites, Blake sprang\r\nup, with a curt \"Good-night!\" and swung off down the cleft. The girl\r\nlooked after him, with a lingering smile.\r\n\r\n\"I wish he hadn't rushed off so suddenly,\" she murmured. \"I was just\r\ngoing to thank him for--for everything!\"\r\n\r\nThe color swept over her face in a deep blush, and she darted around to\r\nher tiny hut as though some one might have overheard her whisper.\r\n\r\nYet, after all, she had said nothing; or, at least, she had merely said\r\n\"everything.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nUNDERSTANDING AND MISUNDERSTANDING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning she found Blake scraping energetically at the inner\r\nsurfaces of a pair of raw hyena skins.\r\n\r\n\"So you've killed more game!\" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Game? No; hyenas. I hated to waste good poison on the brutes; but\r\nnothing else showed up, and I need a new pair of pa--er--trousers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it not dangerous--great beasts like these!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even enough to make it interesting. I'd have had some fun, though,\r\nwith that confounded lion when the moon came up, if he hadn't sneaked\r\noff into the grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Didn't you hear him? The skulking brute prowled around for hours\r\nbefore the moon rose, when it was pitch dark. It was mighty lonesome,\r\nwith him yowling down by the pool. Half a chance, and I'd given him\r\nsomething to yowl about. But it wasn't any use firing off my arrows\r\nin the dark, and, as I said, he sneaked off before--\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom--Mr. Blake!--you must not risk your life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you worry about me. I've learned how to look out for Tom Blake.\r\nAnd you can just bank on it I'm going to look out for Miss Jenny Leslie,\r\ntoo! . . . . But say, after breakfast, suppose we take a run out on the\r\ncliffs for eggs?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish any to-day, thank you.\"\r\n\r\nHe waited a little, studying her down-bent face.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he muttered; \"you don't have to come. I know I oughtn't to\r\ntake a moment's time. I did quite a bit last night; but if you think--\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced up, puzzled. His meaning flashed upon her, and she rose.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not that! I will come,\" she answered, and hastened to prepare the\r\nmorning meal.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the tree-ladder, she found that the heap of stones\r\nbuilt up by Blake to facilitate the first part of the ascent was now\r\nso high that she could climb into the branches without difficulty. She\r\nsurmised that Blake had found it necessary to build up the pile before he\r\ncould ascend with his burden.\r\n\r\nThey were at the foot of the heap, when, with a sharp exclamation, Blake\r\nsprang up into the branches, and scrambled to the top in hot haste.\r\nWondering what this might mean, Miss Leslie followed as fast as she\r\ncould. When she reached the top, she saw him running across towards an\r\nout-jutting point on the north edge of the cliff.\r\n\r\nShe had hurried after him for more than half the distance before she\r\nperceived the vultures that were gathered in a solemn circle about a\r\nlong and narrow heap of stones, on a ledge, down on the sloping brink\r\nof the cliff. While at the foot of the tree Blake had seen one of the\r\ngrewsome flock descending to join the others, and, fearful of what might\r\nbe happening, had rushed on ahead.\r\n\r\nAt his approach, the croaking watchers hopped awkwardly from the\r\nledges, and soared away; only to wheel, and circle back overhead. Miss\r\nLeslie shrank down, shuddering. Blake came back near her, and began to\r\ngather up the pieces of loose rock which were strewn about beneath the\r\nledges on that part of the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"I know I piled up enough,\" he explained, in response to her look.\r\n\"All the same, a few more will do no harm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are sure those awful birds have not--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\nHe carried an armful of rocks to lay on the mound. When he began to\r\ngather more, she followed his example. They worked in silence, piling\r\nthe rough stones gently one upon another, until the cairn had grown\r\nto twice its former size. The air on the open cliff top was fresher\r\nthan in the cleft, and Miss Leslie gave little heed to the absence of\r\nshade. She would have worked on under the burning sun without thought\r\nof consequences. But Blake knew the need of moderation.\r\n\r\n\"There; that'll do,\" he said. \"He may have been--all he was; but\r\nwe've no more than done our duty. Now, we'll stroll out on the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should prefer to return.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt. But it's time you learned how to go nesting. What if you\r\nshould be left alone here? Besides, it looks to me like the signal is\r\ntearing loose.\"\r\n\r\nShe accompanied him out along the cliff crest until they stood in the\r\nmidst of the bird colony, half deafened by their harsh clamor. She had\r\nnever ventured into their concourse when alone. Even now she cried\r\nout, and would have retreated before the sharp bills and beating wings\r\nhad not Blake walked ahead and kicked the squawking birds out of the\r\npath. Having made certain that the big white flag was still secure on\r\nits staff, he led the way along the seaward brink of the cliff, pointing\r\nout the different kinds of seafowl, and shouting information about\r\nsuch of their habits and qualities as were of concern to hungry castaways.\r\n\r\nHe concluded the lesson by descending a dizzy flight of ledges to rob the\r\nnest of a frigate bird. It was a foolhardy feat at best, and doubly so\r\nin view of the thousands of eggs lying all around in the hollows of the\r\ncliff top. But from these Blake had recently culled out all the fresh\r\nsettings of the frigate birds, and none of the other eggs equalled them\r\nin delicacy of flavor.\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\" he demanded, as he drew himself up over the edge of the\r\ncliff, and handed the big chalky-white egg into her keeping.\r\n\r\n\"I would rather go without than see you take such risks,\" she replied\r\ncoldly.\r\n\r\n\"You would, eh!\" he cried, quite misunderstanding her, and angered\r\nby what seemed to him a gratuitous rebuff. \"Well, I'd rather you'd say\r\nnothing than speak in that tone. If you don't want the egg heave it\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\nUnable to conceive any cause for his sudden anger, she was alarmed, and\r\ndrew back, watching him with sidelong glances.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" he demanded. \"Think I'm going to bite you?\"\r\n\r\nShe shrank farther away, and did not answer. He stared at her, his eyes\r\nhard and bright. Suddenly he burst into a harsh laugh, and strode away\r\ntowards the cliff, savagely kicking aside the birds that came in his path.\r\n\r\nWhen, an hour later, the girl crept back along the cleft to the baobab,\r\nshe saw him hard at work building a little hut, several yards down\r\ntowards the barricade. The moment she perceived what he was about her\r\nbearing became less guarded, and she took up her own work with a spirit\r\nand energy which she had not shown since the adventure with the puff\r\nadder.\r\n\r\nAt her call to the noon meal, Blake took his time to respond, and when he\r\nat last came to join her, he was morose and taciturn. She met him with\r\na smile, and exerted all her womanly tact to conciliate him.\r\n\r\n\"You must help me eat the egg,\" she said. \"I've boiled it hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather eat beef,\" he mumbled.\r\n\r\n\"But just to please me--when I've cooked it your way!\"\r\n\r\nHe uttered an inarticulate sound which she chose to interpret as assent.\r\nThe egg was already shelled. She cut it exactly in half, and served one\r\nof the pieces to him with a bit of warm fat and a pinch of salt. As he\r\ntook the dish, he raised his sullen eyes to her face. She met his gaze\r\nwith a look of smiling insistence.\r\n\r\n\"Come now,\" she said; \"please don't refuse. I'm sorry I was so\r\nrude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you feel that way about it!--not that I care for fancy\r\ndishes,\" he responded gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"It would be missing half the enjoyment to eat such a delicacy without\r\nsome one to share it,\" she said.\r\n\r\nBlake looked away without answer. But she could see that his face was\r\nbeginning to clear. Greatly encouraged, she chatted away as though they\r\nwere seated at her father's dinner-table, and he was an elderly friend\r\nfrom the business world whom it was her duty to entertain.\r\n\r\nFor a while Blake betrayed little interest, confining himself to\r\nmonosyllables except when he commented on the care with which she had\r\ncooked the various dishes. When she least expected, he looked up at\r\nher, his lips parted in a broad smile. She stopped short, for she had\r\nbeen describing her first social triumphs, and his untimely levity\r\nembarrassed her.\r\n\r\n\"Don't get mad, Miss Jenny,\" he said, his eyes twinkling. \"You don't\r\nknow how funny it seems to sit here and listen to you talking about those\r\nthings. It's like serving up ice cream and onions in the same dish.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure, Mr. Blake--\"\r\n\r\n\"Beats a burlesque all hollow--Mrs. Sint-Regis-Waldoff's chop-sooey\r\ntea and young Mrs. Vandam-Jones's auto-cotillon--with us sitting here\r\nlike troglodytes, chewing snake-poisoned antelope, and you in that Kundry\r\ndress--\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you--I was not aware that you knew about music.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know a note. But give me a chance to hear good music, and I'm\r\nthere, if I have to stand in the peanut gallery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm so glad! I'm very, very fond of music! Have you been to\r\nBayreuth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"In Germany. It is where his operas are given as staged by Wagner\r\nhimself. It is indescribably grand and inspiring--above all, the\r\nParsifal!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll most certainly take that in, even if I have to cut short my\r\nengagement in this gee-lorious clime--not but what, when it comes to\r\nleopard ladies--\" He paused, and surveyed her with frank admiration.\r\n\r\nThe blood leaped into her face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she gasped, \"I never dreamed that even such a man as you would\r\ncompare me with--with a creature like that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Such a man as me!\" repeated Blake, staring. \"What do you mean? I\r\nknow I'm not much of a ladies' man; but to be yanked up like this when\r\na fellow is trying to pay a compliment--well, it's not just what you'd\r\ncall pleasant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Blake. I misunderstood. I--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right, Miss Jenny! I don't ask any lady to beg my pardon.\r\nThe only thing is I don't see why you should flare out at me that way.\"\r\n\r\nFor a full minute she sat, with down-bent head, her face clouded with\r\ndoubt and indecision. At last she bravely raised her eyes to meet his.\r\n\r\n\"Do you wonder that I am not quite myself?\" she asked. \"You should\r\nremember that I have always had the utmost comforts of life, and have\r\nbeen cared for-- Don't you see how terrible it is for me? And then the\r\ndeath of--of--\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't be sorry for that!\"\r\n\r\n\"But even you felt how terrible it was . . . . and then--Oh, surely,\r\nyou must see how--how embarrassing--\"\r\n\r\nIt was Blake's turn to look down and hesitate. She studied his face,\r\nher bosom heaving with quick-drawn breath; but she could make nothing\r\nof his square jaw and firm-set lips. His eyes were concealed by the brim\r\nof his leaf hat. When he spoke, seemingly it was to change the subject:\r\n\"Guess you saw me making my hut. I'm fixing it so it'll do me even\r\nwhen it rains.\"\r\n\r\nHad he been the kind of man that she had been educated to consider as\r\nalone entitled to the name of gentleman, she could have felt certain\r\nthat he had intended the remark for a delicately worded assurance. But\r\nwas Tom Blake, for all his blunt kindliness, capable of such tact? She\r\nchose to consider that he was.\r\n\r\n\"It's a cunning little bungalow. But will not the rain flood you out?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's going to have a raised floor. You're more like to have the rain\r\ndrive in on you again. I'll have to rig up a porch over your door. It\r\nwon't do to stuff up the hole. You've little enough air as it is.\r\nBut that can wait a while. There's other work more pressing. First,\r\nthere's the barricade. By the time that's done, those hyena skins\r\nwill be cured enough to use. I've got to have new trousers soon, and new\r\nshoes, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can do the sewing, if you will cut out the pattern.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I'll take a stagger at it myself first. I'd rather you'd go\r\negging. You need to run around more, to keep in trim.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel quite well now, and I am growing so strong! The only thing is\r\nthis constant heat.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to grin and bear it. After all, it's not so bad, if only\r\nwe can stave off the fever. Another reason I want you to go for eggs is\r\nthat you can take your time about it, and keep a look-out for steamers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you think --?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't screw up your hopes too high. We've little show of being picked\r\nup by a chance boat on a coast with reefs like this. But I figure that if\r\nI was in your daddy's shoes, it'd be high time for me to be cabling\r\na ship to run up from Natal, or down from Zanzibar, to look around for\r\njettison, et cetera.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure papa will offer a big reward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Second the motion! I've a sort of idea I wouldn't mind coming in for\r\na reward myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You? Oh, yes; to be sure. Papa is generous, and he will be grateful\r\nto any one who--\"\r\n\r\n\"You think I mean his dirty money!\" broke in Blake, hotly.\r\n\r\nHer confusion told him that he had not been mistaken. His face, only a\r\nmoment since bright and pleasant, took on its sullenest frown.\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie rose hurriedly, and started along the cleft.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" he called. \"Not going for eggs now, are you?\"\r\n\r\nShe did not reply.\r\n\r\n\"Hang it all, Miss Jenny! Don't go off like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask you to excuse me, Mr. Blake? Is that sufficient?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sufficient? It's enough to give a fellow a chill! Come now; don't go\r\noff mad. You know I've a quick temper. Can't you make allowances?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've--you've no right to look so angry, even if I did misunderstand\r\nyou. You misunderstood me!\" She caught herself up with a half sob.\r\nHis silence gave her time to recover her composure. She continued with\r\nexcessive politeness, \"Need I repeat my request to be excused, Mr.\r\nBlake?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; once is enough! But honest now, I didn't mean to be nasty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-day, Mr. Blake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, da-darn it, good-day!\" he groaned.\r\n\r\nWhen, a few minutes later, she returned, he was gone. He did not come\r\nback until some time after dark, when she had withdrawn to her lean-to\r\nfor the night. His hands were bleeding from thorn scratches; but after\r\na hasty supper, he went back down the cleft to build up the new wall\r\nof the barricade with the great stack of fresh thorn-brush that he had\r\ngathered during the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning he met Miss Leslie with a sullen bearing, which, however,\r\ndid not altogether conceal his desire to be on friendly terms. Having\r\nregained her self-control, she responded to this with such tact that\r\nby evening each felt more at ease in the new relationship, and Blake\r\nhad lost every trace of his moroseness. The fact that both were\r\npassionately fond of music proved an immense help. It gave them an\r\nimpersonal source of mutual sympathy and understanding,--a common\r\nmeeting-ground in the world of art and culture, apart from and above\r\nthe plane of their material wants.\r\n\r\nYet for all his enjoyment of the girl's wide knowledge of everything\r\nrelating to music, Blake took care that their talks and discussions did\r\nnot interfere with the activities of their primitive mode of life. As\r\nsoon as he had finished with the barricade, he devoted himself to his\r\ntailoring and shoe-making; while Miss Leslie, between her cooking and\r\nwood-gathering and daily visits to the cliff for eggs, had much to occupy\r\nboth her thoughts and her hands.\r\n\r\nAt first every ascent of the cliff was embittered by a painful\r\nconsciousness of the cairn upon the north edge. Fortunately it was not\r\nin sight from the direct path to the headland, and, as she refrained\r\nfrom visiting it, the new happenings of her wild life soon thrust\r\nWinthrope and his death out of the foreground of her thoughts. Each day\r\nshe had to nerve herself to meet the beaks and wings of the despoiled\r\nnest-owners; each day she looked with greater hope for the expected\r\nrescue ship, only to be increasingly disappointed.\r\n\r\nBut the hours she spent on the cliff crest after gathering the day's\r\nsupply of eggs were not spent merely in watching and longing. The\r\ninconvenience of carrying the eggs in a handkerchief or in one of the\r\nheavy jars suggested a renewal of her attempt at basket-making. Memory,\r\nperseverance, and a trace of inventiveness enabled her to produce a\r\nsmall but serviceable hamper of split bamboo.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this success she gathered a quantity of tough, wiry grass,\r\nand wove a hat to take the place of the flimsy palm-leaf makeshift.\r\nThe result was by no means satisfactory with regard to style, its shape\r\nbeing intermediate between a Mexican sombrero and a funnel; but aside\r\nfrom its appearance, she could not have wished for a more comfortable\r\nhead-cover. Before showing it to Blake, she wove a second one for him,\r\nso that they were able to cast aside the grotesque, palm-leaf affairs\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nThe following morning Blake appeared in an outfit to match her\r\nleopard-skin dress. He had singed off the hair of the hide out of which\r\nhe had made his moccasins, and his hyena-skin trousers quite matched\r\nthe bristling stubble on his face.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Miss Jenny!\" he hailed; \"what d' you think of this for fancy\r\nneedlework?\"\r\n\r\n\"Splendid! You're the very picture of an Argentine vaquero.\"\r\n\r\n\"Greaser?--ugh! Let me get back to the Weary Willy pants!\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean you are very picturesque.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it, is it? Glad I've got something to call your leopardine\r\ngown that won't make you huffy.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can at least call our costumes serviceable, and mine has proved much\r\ncooler than I expected.\"\r\n\r\n\"But our new hats beat all for that--regular sunshades. What do you\r\nsay?--there's a good breeze-- Let's take a hike.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to the river! The very thought of that dreadful snake--\"\r\n\r\n\"No; just the other way. I've been thinking for some time that we\r\nought to run down to that south headland, and take a squint at the coast\r\nbeyond. Ten to one, it's another stretch of swamps, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"You think there is a chance we may find a town?\"\r\n\r\n\"About one chance in a million, even for a native village. The slave\r\ntrade wiped the niggers off this coast, and I guess those that hit out\r\nupcountry ran so hard they haven't been able to get back yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it has been years since the slave trade was forbidden.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they don't sell beer in Kansas--oh, no! I'll bet the dhows still\r\nslip over from Madagascar when the moon is in the right quarter. At\r\nany rate, niggers are mighty scarce or mighty shy around here. I've\r\nkept a watch for smoke, and haven't seen a suspicion of it anywhere.\r\nMaybe the swamps swing around inland and cut off this strip of coast.\r\nIt looked that way to me when I made that trip along the ridge. But\r\nthere's a chance it used to be inhabited, and we may run across an\r\nabandoned village.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not see that the discovery would do us any good.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the chance of grain or bananas still growing? But that's\r\nall a guess. We're going because we need a change.\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, and hastened to prepare breakfast, while he packed a skin\r\nbag with food, and examined the slender tips of his arrows. As a matter\r\nof precaution, he had been keeping them in the cigarette case, where\r\nthe points would be certain of a coat of the sticky poison and at the\r\nsame time guarded against inflicting a chance wound. But as he was now\r\nabout to set out on a journey, he fitted tips into the heads of his\r\ntwo straightest shafts.\r\n\r\nThe morning was still fresh when they closed the barricade behind them\r\nand descended to the pool. There was no game in sight, but Blake had no\r\nwish to hunt at the commencement of the trip. The steady southwest wind\r\nhad blown the sky clear of its malarial haze, and gave promise of a day\r\nwhich should know nothing of sultry calm--a day on which game would be\r\nhard to stalk, but one perfectly suited for a long tramp.\r\n\r\nMindful of ticks, Blake headed obliquely across to the beach. Once on\r\nthe smooth, hard sand, they swung along at a brisk pace, light-hearted\r\nand keen with the spirit of adventure. Never had they felt more\r\ncompanionable. Miss Leslie laughed and chatted and sang snatches of\r\nsongs, while Blake beat time with his club, or sought to whistle grand\r\nopera--he had healed his blistered lips some time before by liberal\r\napplications of antelope tallow.\r\n\r\nGulls and terns circled about them, or hovered over the water, ready to\r\nswoop down upon their finny prey. Sandpipers ran along the beach within a\r\nstone's throw, but the curlews showed their greater knowledge of mankind\r\nby keeping beyond gunshot.\r\n\r\nOnce a great flock of geese drove high overhead, their leader honking\r\nthe alarm as they swept above the suspicious figures on the beach. Like\r\nthe curlews, they had knowledge of mankind. But the flock of white\r\npelicans which came sailing along in stately leisure on their immense\r\nwings floated past so low that Blake felt certain he could shoot one.\r\nHe raised his bow and took aim, but refrained from shooting, at the\r\nthought that it might be a sheer waste of his precious poison.\r\n\r\nA little later a herd of large animals appeared on the border of the\r\ngrass jungle, but wheeled and dashed back into cover so quickly that\r\nBlake barely had time to make out that they were buffaloes--the first\r\nhe had seen on this coast, but easily recognized by their resemblance\r\nto the Cape variety. Their flight gave him small concern; for the time\r\nbeing he was more interested in topography than game.\r\n\r\nThe southern headland now lay close before them, its seaward face rearing\r\nup sheer and lofty, but the approach behind running down in broken\r\nterraces. Mid-morning found the explorers at the foot of the ridge.\r\nBlake squinted up at the boulder-strewn slopes and the crannies of the\r\nbroken ledges.\r\n\r\n\"Likely place for snakes, Miss Jenny,\" he remarked. \"Guess I'd better\r\nlead.\"\r\n\r\nEager as she was to look over into the country beyond, the girl dropped\r\ninto second place, and made no complaint about the wary slowness of\r\nher companion's advance. She found the most difficult parts of the\r\nascent quite easy after her training on the tree-ladder. Blake could\r\nhave taken ledges and all at a run, but as he mounted each terrace, he\r\nhalted to spy out the ground before him. Like Miss Leslie, he was looking\r\nfor snakes, though for an exactly opposite reason. He wished to add\r\nto the contents of the cigarette case.\r\n\r\nGreatly to his disappointment and the girl's relief, neither snake nor\r\nsign of snake was to be seen all the way up the ridge. As they neared\r\nthe crest Blake turned to offer her his hand up the last ledges, and in\r\nthe instant they gained the top.\r\n\r\nThe wind, now freshening to a gale, struck the girl with such force that\r\nshe would have been blown back down the ledges had not Blake clutched\r\nher wrist. Heedless alike of the painful grip which held her and of the\r\ngusts which tore at her skirt, the girl stood gazing out across the\r\ndesolate swamps which stretched away to the southwest as far as the\r\neye could see. She did not speak until Blake led her down behind the\r\nshelter of the crest ledges.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" he demanded. \"Didn't I warn you?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked away to hide the tears which sprang into her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I can't explain--only, it makes me feel so--so lonely!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come now, little woman; don't take on so!\" he urged. \"It might\r\nbe a lot worse, you know. We've gotten along pretty well, considering.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been very kind, Mr. Blake, and as you say, matters might have\r\nbeen worse. I do not forget how far more terrible was our situation the\r\nmorning after the storm. Yet you must realize how disappointing it is to\r\nlose even the slightest hope of escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know. If it wasn't for the fever that's bound to come\r\nwith the rains, I, for one, would just as leave stick to this camp right\r\nalong, providing the company don't change.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned upon him with flashing eyes, all thought of caution lost in\r\nher anger. \"How dare you say such a thing? You are contemptible! I\r\ndespise you!\"\r\n\r\n\"My, Miss Jenny, but you are pretty when you get mad!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe answer took her completely aback. He was neither angry nor laughing\r\nat her, but met her defiant glance with candid, sober admiration. There\r\nwas something more than admiration in his glowing eyes; yet she could\r\nnot but see that her alarm had been baseless. His manner had never been\r\nmore respectful. Suddenly she found that she could no longer meet his\r\ngaze. She looked away and stammered lamely, \"You--you shouldn't say\r\nsuch things, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? Hasn't everything been running smooth the last few days?\r\nHaven't we been good chummy comrades? Of course you've got the worst of\r\nthe deal. I know I'm not much on fancy talk; but I like to hear it when\r\nI've a chance. I've led a lonesome sort of life since they did for my\r\nsisters-- No; I'm not going to rake that up again. I'm only trying\r\nto give you an idea what it means to a fellow to be with a lady like\r\nyou. May be it isn't polite to tell you all this, but it's just what\r\nI feel, and I never did amount to shucks as a liar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe I understand you, Mr. Blake, and I really feel highly\r\ncomplimented.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you don't, any such thing, Miss Jenny. Own up, now! If I met you\r\nto-morrow on your papa's doorstep, you'd cut me cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should if you continued to be so rude. Have you no regard for my\r\nfeelings? But here we are, talking nonsense, when we should be going--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it nonsense?\" he broke in. \"What does life mean, anyway? Here we\r\ncan be true friends and comrades,--real, free living people. It can't\r\nbe that you want to go back to all those society shams, after you've\r\nseen real life! As for me, what have I to gain by going back to the\r\neverlasting grind? I don't mind work; but when a man has nothing ahead\r\nto work for but a bank account, when it's grind, grind, grind till\r\nyour head goes stale and all the world looks black, then there's no\r\nchoice but throw up your job and go on a drunk, if you want to keep from\r\na gun accident. Maybe you don't understand it. But that's what I've\r\nhad to go through, time and again. Do you wonder I like to fancy an\r\neverlasting picnic here, with a little partner who wouldn't let me\r\ncome within shouting distance of her in the land of lavender--trousers\r\nand peek-a-boos?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blake, really you are most unjust! I could not be so--so\r\nungrateful, after all your kindness. I--we should certainly be glad to\r\nnumber you among our friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drink and all, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"A man of your will-power has no need whatever to give way to such a\r\nhabit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Course not, if he's got anything in sight worth while. Guess, though,\r\nmy folks must have been poor white trash. I never could go after money\r\njust for the fun of the game. No family, no friends, no--what-you\r\n-call-it?--culture-- What's the use? I have a fair head for figures; but\r\nall the mathematics that I know I've had to catch hot off the bat.\r\nIt's true I grubbed my C. E. out of a correspondence school; but a\r\nfellow has to have an all-round, crack-up education to put him where\r\nit's worth while.\"\r\n\r\n\"You still have time to work up. You are not much over thirty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-seven! I should have thought-- What a hard life you must have\r\nhad!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hard work? Well, I suppose Panama did do for me some. But it wasn't\r\nso much that. Few fellows could hit up the pace I've set and come out\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just what you might expect of a fellow in my fix--all kinds of gamble\r\nand drink and--the rest of it.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Leslie looked away, visibly distressed. She had not been reared\r\nafter the French method. Young as she was, she had fluttered at will\r\nabout the borders of the garden of vice, knowing well that the gaudy\r\nblossoms were lures to entice one into the pitfall. Yet never before\r\nhad she caught so clear a glimpse of the slimy depths.\r\n\r\n\"That's it!\" growled Blake. \"Throw me down cold, just because I'm\r\nsquare enough to tell you straight out. You make me tired! I'm not\r\none of the work-ox sort, that can chew the cud all the year round, and\r\ncork the blood out of their brains. I've got to cut loose from the\r\ninfernal grind once in a while, and barring a chance now and then at\r\nopera, there's never been anything but a spree--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but that's so dreadfully shocking, Mr. Blake!\"\r\n\r\n\"And then like all the other little hypocrites, you'll go and marry\r\none of those swell dudes who's made that sort of thing his business, and\r\neverybody knows it, but it's all politely understood to've been done\r\nsub rosa, so it's all right, because he knows how to part his name in\r\nthe middle and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, please stop, Mr. Blake! You don't know how cruel you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cruel? Suppose I told you about the millionaire cur that-- Oh, now,\r\ndon't go and cry! Please don't cry, Miss Jenny! I wouldn't hurt your\r\nfeelings for the world! I didn't mean anything out of the way, really\r\nI didn't! It's only that when I get to thinking of--of things, it sets\r\nme half crazy. And now, can't you see how it's going to be ten times\r\nworse for me after--with you so altogether beyond me--\" He stopped\r\nshort, flushed, and stammered lamely, \"I--I didn't mean to say that!\"\r\n\r\nShe looked down, no less embarrassed.\r\n\r\n\"Please let us talk of something else,\" she murmured. \"It has\r\nbeen such a pleasant morning, until you--until we began this silly\r\ndiscussion.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, all right! Only mop up the dewdrops, and we'll turn on\r\nthe sun machine. I really didn't mean to rip out that way at all. But,\r\nyou see, the thing's been rankling in me ever since we came aboard ship\r\nat the Cape, and Winthrope and Lady Bayrose had my seat changed so I\r\ncouldn't see you-- Not that I hold anything against them now--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Blake, I suppose you know that this African coast is particularly\r\ndangerous for women. So far I have escaped the fever. But you yourself\r\nsaid that the longer the attack is delayed, the worse it will be.\"\r\n\r\nBlake's face darkened, and he turned to stare inland along the ridge.\r\nShe had flicked him on the raw, and he thought that she had done so\r\nintentionally.\r\n\r\n\"You think I haven't tried--that I've been shamming!\" he burst out\r\nbitterly. \"You're right. There's the one chance-- But I couldn't\r\nleave you till the barricade was finished, and it's been only a few days\r\nsince-- All the same, I oughtn't to've waited a day. I'll start it\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Start what?\"\r\n\r\n\"A catamaran. I can rig one up, in short order, that, with a skin\r\nsail and an outrigger, will do fairly well to coast along inside the\r\nreefs--barring squalls. Worst thing is that it's all a guess whether\r\nthe nearest settlement is up the coast or down.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you can think of going, and leaving me all alone here!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's better than letting you risk two-to-one chances on feeding the\r\nsharks.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you'd be risking it!\"\r\n\r\nBlake uttered a short harsh laugh.\r\n\r\n\"What's the difference?\" He paused a moment; then added, with grim\r\nhumor, \"Anyway, they'll have earned a meal by the time they get me\r\nchewed up.\"\r\n\r\n\"You sha'n't go!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know. We'll see about it to-morrow. There's a grove\r\nof cocoanuts yonder. Come on, and I'll get some nuts. I can't see any\r\nwater around here, and it would be dry eating, with only the flask.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nA LION LEADS THEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe palm grove stood under the lee of the ridge, on a stretch of bare\r\nground. Other than seaward, the open space was hemmed in by grass\r\njungle, interspersed with clumps of thorn-brush. On the north side a\r\njutting corner of the tall, yellow spear-grass curved out and around,\r\nwith the point of the hook some fifty yards from the palms. Elsewhere the\r\ndistance to the jungle was nearly twice as far.\r\n\r\nBlake dropped the bag and his weapons, flung down his hat, and started\r\nup a palm shaft. The down-pointing bristles of his skin trousers aided\r\nhis grip. Though the lofty crown of the palm was swaying in the wind, he\r\nreached the top and was down again before Miss Leslie had arranged the\r\ncontents of the lunch bag.\r\n\r\n\"Guess you're not extra hungry,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\nShe made no response.\r\n\r\n\"Mad, eh? Well, toss me the little knife. Mine has got too good a\r\nmeat-edge to spoil on these husks.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was very kind of you to climb for the nuts, and the wind blowing\r\nso hard up there,\" she said, as she handed over the penknife. \"I am\r\nnot angry. It is only that I feel tired and depressed. I hope I am not\r\ngoing to be--\"\r\n\r\n\"No; you're not going to have the fever, or any such thing! You're\r\nplayed out, that's all. I'm a fool for bringing you so far. You'll be\r\nall right after you eat and rest. Here; drink this cocoa milk.\"\r\n\r\nShe drained the nut, and upon his insistence, made a pretence at eating.\r\nHe was deceived until, with the satisfying of his first keen hunger, he\r\nagain became observant.\r\n\r\n\"Say, that won't do!\" he exclaimed. \"Look at your bowl. You haven't\r\nnibbled enough to keep a mouse alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, I am not hungry. But I am resting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try another nut. I'll have one ready in two shakes.\"\r\n\r\nHe caught his hat, which was dragging past in a downward eddy of the\r\nwind, and weighted it with a cocoanut. He wedged another nut between\r\nhis knees, and bent over it, tearing at the husk. It took him only a\r\nfew moments to strip the fibre from the end and gouge open the germ hole.\r\nHe held out the nut, and glanced up to meet her smile of acceptance.\r\n\r\nShe was staring past him, her eyes wide with terror, and the color fast\r\nreceding from her face.\r\n\r\n\"What in-- Another snake?\" he demanded, twisting warily about to glare\r\nat the ground behind him.\r\n\r\n\"There--over in the grass!\" she whispered, \"It looked out at me with\r\nterrible, savage eyes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Snake?--that far off?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!--a monster--a huge, fierce beast!\"\r\n\r\n\"Beast?\" echoed Blake, grasping his bow and arrows. \"Where is he?\r\nMaybe only one of these African buffaloes. How'd he look?--horns?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I didn't see any. It was all shaggy, and yellow like the grass,\r\nand terrible eyes--_Oh!_\"\r\n\r\nThe girl's scream was met by a ferocious, snarling roar, so deep and\r\nprolonged that the air quivered and the very ground seemed to shake.\r\n\r\n\"God!--a lion!\" cried Blake, the hair on his bare head bristling like\r\na startled animal's.\r\n\r\nHe turned squarely about toward the ridge, his bow half drawn. Had the\r\nlion shown himself then, Blake would have shot on the instant. As it\r\nwas, the beast remained behind the screening border of grass, where he\r\ncould watch his intended quarry without being seen in turn. The delay\r\ngave Blake time for reflection. He spoke sharply, as it were biting off\r\nhis words: \"Hit out. I'll stop the bluffer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't. Oh, I'm afraid!\"\r\n\r\nAgain the hidden beast gave voice to his mighty rumbling challenge. Still\r\nhe did not appear, and Blake attempted a derisive jeer: \"Hey, there,\r\nlouder! We've not run yet! It's all right, little woman. The skulking\r\nsneak is trying to bluff us. 'Fraid to come out if we don't stampede.\r\nHe'll make off when he finds we don't scare. Lions never tackle men in\r\nthe daytime. Just keep cool a while. He'll--\"\r\n\r\n\"Look!--there to the right!--I saw him again! He's creeping around!\r\nSee the grass move!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's only the wind. It eddies down--God! he is stalking around.\r\nTrying to take us from behind--curse him! He may get me, but I'll get\r\nhim too,--the dirty sneak!\"\r\n\r\nThe blood had flowed back into Blake's face, and showed on each cheek\r\nin a little red patch. His broad chest rose and fell slowly to deep\r\nrespirations; his eyes glowed like balls of white-hot steel. He drew\r\nhis bow a little tauter, and wheeled slowly to keep the arrow pointed at\r\nthe slight wave in the grass which marked the stealthy movements of the\r\nlion. Miss Leslie, more terrified with every added moment of suspense,\r\ncringed around, that she might keep him between her and the hidden beast.\r\n\r\nMinute after minute dragged by. Only a man of Blake's obstinate, sullen\r\ntemperament could have withstood the strain and kept cool. Even he\r\nfound the impulse to leap up and run all but irresistible. Miss Leslie\r\ncrouched behind him, no more able to run than a mouse with which a cat\r\nhas been playing.\r\n\r\nOnce they caught a glimpse of the sinuous, tawny form gliding among the\r\nleafless stems of a thorn clump. Blake took quick aim; but the outlines\r\nof the beast were indistinct and the range long. He hesitated, and the\r\nopportunity was lost.\r\n\r\nYard by yard they watched the slight swaying of the grass tops which\r\nbetrayed the cautious advance of the grim stalker. The beast did not\r\nroar again. Having failed to flush his game, he was seeking to catch\r\nthem off their guard, or perhaps was warily taking stock of the strange\r\ncreatures, whose like he had never seen.\r\n\r\nNow and then there was a pause, and the grass tops swayed only to\r\nthe down-puffs of the heightening gale. At such moments the two grew\r\nrigid, watching and waiting in breathless suspense. They could see, as\r\ndistinctly as though there had been no screening grass, the baleful\r\neyes of the huge cat and the shaggy forebody as the beast stood still\r\nand glared out at them.\r\n\r\nThen the sinuous wave would start on again around the grass border, and\r\nBlake would draw in a deep breath and mutter a word of encouragement to\r\nthe girl: \"Look, now--the dirty sneak! Trying to give us the creeps,\r\nis he? I'll creeps him! 'Fraid to show his pretty mug!\"\r\n\r\nNot until the beast had circled half around the glade did his purpose\r\nflash upon Blake. With the wariness of all savage hunters, the animal\r\nhad marked out the spur of jungle on the north side, where he could creep\r\ncloser to his quarry before leaping from cover.\r\n\r\n\"The damned sneak!\" growled Blake. \"You there, Jenny?\"\r\n\r\nShe could not speak, but he heard her gasp.\r\n\r\n\"Brace up, little woman! Where's your grit? You're out of this deal,\r\nanyway. He'll choke to death swallowing me-- But say; couldn't you\r\nmanage to shin up a palm, twenty feet or so, and hang on for a couple\r\nof minutes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I--can't move--I am--\"\r\n\r\n\"Make a try! It'll give me a run for my money. I'll take the next\r\nelevator after you. That'll bring the bluffer out on the hot-foot. I\r\nslip a surprise between his ribs, and we view the scenery while he's\r\npassing in his checks. Come; make a spurt! He's around the turn, and\r\ngetting nearer every step.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't--Tom,--there is no need that both of us-- You climb up--\"\r\n\r\nHe turned about as the meaning of her whisper dawned upon him. Her eyes\r\nwere shining with the ecstasy of self-sacrifice. It was only the glance\r\nof an instant; then he was again facing the jungle.\r\n\r\n\"God! You think I'd do that!\"\r\n\r\nShe made no reply. There was a pause. Blake--crouched on one knee, tense\r\nand alert--waited until the sinister wave was advancing into the point\r\nof the incurved jungle. Then he spoke, in a low, even tone: \"Feel if my\r\nglass is there.\"\r\n\r\nHer hand reached around and pressed against the fob pocket which he had\r\nsewn in the belt of his skin trousers.\r\n\r\n\"Right. Now slip my club up under my elbow--big end. Lick on the\r\nnose'll stop a dog or a bull. It's a chance.\"\r\n\r\nShe thrust the club under his right elbow, and he gripped it against his\r\nside.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the lion bounded from cover, with a roar like a clap of\r\nthunder. Blake sprang erect. The beast checked himself in the act of\r\nleaping, and crouched with his great paws outstretched, every hooked\r\nclaw thrust out, ready to tear and mangle. In two or three bounds he\r\ncould have leaped upon Blake and crushed him with a single stroke of his\r\npaw. As he rose to repeat his deafening roar, it seemed to Blake that he\r\nstood higher than a horse--that his mouth gaped wide as the end of a\r\nhogshead. And yet the beast stood hesitating, restrained by brute dread\r\nof the unknown. Never before had any animal that he had hunted reared\r\nup to meet his attack in this strange manner.\r\n\r\n\"Lie flat!\" commanded Blake; \"lie flat, and don't move! I'm going\r\nto call his bluff. Keep still till the poison gets in its work. I'll\r\nkeep him busy long as I can. When it's over, hit out for home along the\r\nbeach. Keep inside the barricade, and watch all you can from the cliffs.\r\nMight light a fire up there nights. There's sure to be a steamer before\r\nlong--\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom!\" she cried, struggling to her knees,--\"Tom!\"\r\n\r\nBut he did not pause or look around. He was beginning to circle slowly\r\nto the left across the open ground, in a spiral curve that would bring\r\nhim to the edge of the jungle within thirty yards of the lion. There\r\nwas red now showing in his eyes. His hair was bristling, no longer with\r\nfear, but with sheer brute fury; his lips were drawn back from the\r\nclenched teeth; his nostrils distended and quivering; his forehead\r\nwrinkled like that of an angry mastiff. His look was more ferocious\r\nthan that of the snarling beast he faced. All the primeval in him was\r\nroused. He was become a man of the Cave Age. He went to meet death, his\r\nmind and body aflame with fierce lust to kill.\r\n\r\nThe lion stilled his roars, and crouched as if to spring, snarling and\r\ngrinning with rage and uncertainty. His eyes, unaccustomed to the glare\r\nof the mid-day sun, blinked incessantly, though he followed the man's\r\nevery movement, his snarls deepening into growls at the slightest change\r\nof attitude.\r\n\r\nIn his blind animal rage, Blake had forgotten that the purpose of his\r\nlateral advance was to place as great a distance as possible between him\r\nand the girl before the clash. Yet instinct kept him moving along his\r\nspiral course, on the chance that he might catch his foe off his guard.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the lion half rose and stretched forward, sniffing. There was\r\nan uneasy whining note in his growls. Blake let the club slip from\r\nbeneath his arm, and drew his bow until the arrow-head lay upon his\r\nthumb. His outstretched arm was rigid as a bar of steel. So tense and\r\nalert were all his nerves that he knew he could drive home both arrows,\r\nand still have time to swing his club before the beast was upon him.\r\n\r\nA puff of wind struck against his back, and swept on to the nostrils of\r\nthe lion, laden with the odor of man. The beast uttered a short, startled\r\nroar, and whirling about, leaped away into the jungle so quickly that\r\nBlake's arrow flashed past a full yard behind.\r\n\r\nThe second arrow was on the string before the first had struck the\r\nground. But the lion had vanished in the grass. With a yell, Blake\r\ndashed on across to the nearest point of the jungle. As he ran, he\r\ndrew the burning-glass from his fob, and flipped it open, ready for use.\r\nIf the lion had turned behind the sheltering grass stems, he was too\r\ncowardly to charge out again. Within a minute the jungle border was a\r\nwall of roaring flame.\r\n\r\nThe grass, long since dead, and bone-dry with the days of tropical\r\nsunshine since the cyclone, flared up before the wind like gunpowder.\r\nEven against the wind the fire ate its way along the ground with fearful\r\nrapidity, trailing behind it an upwhirling vortex of smoke and flame.\r\nNo living creature could have burst through that belt of fire.\r\n\r\nA wave of fierce heat sent Blake staggering back, scorched and blistered.\r\nThere was no exultance in his bearing. For the moment all thought of\r\nthe lion was swallowed up in awe of his own work. He stared at the\r\nhell of leaping, roaring flames from beneath his upraised arm. To\r\nthe north sparks and lighted wisps of grass driven by the gale had\r\nalready fired the jungle half way to the farther ridge.\r\n\r\nStep by step Blake drew back. His heel struck against something soft.\r\nHe looked down, and saw Miss Leslie lying on the sand, white and still.\r\nShe had fainted, overcome by fear or by the unendurable heat. The heat\r\nmust have stupefied him as well. He stared at her, dull-eyed, wondering\r\nif she was dead. His brain cleared. He sprang over to where the flask\r\nlay beside the remnants of the lunch.\r\n\r\nHe was dashing the last drops of the tepid water in her face, when she\r\nmoaned, and her eyelids began to flutter. He flung down the flask, and\r\nfell to chafing her wrist.\r\n\r\n\"Tom!\" she moaned.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Jenny, I'm here. It's all right,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Have I had a sunstroke? Is that why it seems so-- I can hardly\r\nbreathe--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, I tell you. Only a little bonfire I touched off. Guess\r\nyou must have fainted, but it's all right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was silly of me to faint. But when I saw that dreadful thing\r\nleap--\" She faltered, and lay shuddering. Fearful that she was about to\r\nswoon again, Blake slapped her hand between his palms with stinging force.\r\n\r\n\"You're it!\" he shouted. \"The joke's on you! Kitty jumped just the\r\nother way, and he won't come back in a hurry with that fire to head him\r\noff. Jump up now, and we'll do a jig on the strength of it.\"\r\n\r\nShe attempted a smile, and a trace of color showed in her cheeks. With an\r\nidea that action would further her recovery, he drew her to a sitting\r\nposition, stepped quickly behind, and, with his hands beneath her elbows,\r\nlifted her upright. But she was still too weak and giddy to stand alone.\r\nAs he released his grip, she swayed and would have fallen had he not\r\ncaught her arm.\r\n\r\n\"Steady!\" he admonished. \"Brace up; you're all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm--I'm just a little dizzy,\" she murmured, clinging to his\r\nshoulder. \"It will pass in a minute. It's so silly, but I'm that\r\nway--Tom, I--I think you are the bravest man--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes--but that's not the point. Leave go now, like a sensible\r\ngirl. It's about time to hit the trail.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew himself free, and without a glance at her blushing face, began to\r\ngather up their scattered outfit. His hat lay where he had weighted it\r\ndown with the cocoanut. He tossed the nut into the skin bag, and jammed\r\nthe hat on his head, pulling the brim far down over his eyes. When he\r\nhad fetched his club, he walked back past the girl, with his eyes averted.\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" he muttered.\r\n\r\nThe scarlet in the girl's cheeks swept over her whole face in a burning\r\nwave, which ebbed slowly and left her colorless. Blake had started off\r\nwithout a backward glance. She gazed about with a bewildered look at the\r\npalms and the barren ridge and the fiery tidal wave of flame. Her gaze\r\ncame back to Blake, and she followed him.\r\n\r\nWithin a short distance she found herself out of the sheltering lee of\r\nthe ridge. The first wind gust almost overthrew her. She could never\r\nhave walked against such a gale; but with the wind at her back she was\r\nbuoyed up and borne along as though on wings. Her sole effort was to\r\nkeep her foothold. Had it been their morning trip, she could have cried\r\nout with joy and skipped along before the gusts like a school-girl. Now\r\nshe walked as soberly as the wind would permit, and took care not to\r\nlessen the distance between herself and Blake.\r\n\r\nMile by mile they hastened back across the plain,--on their right the\r\nblue sea of water, with its white-caps and spray; on their left the\r\nyellow sea of fire, with its dun fog of smoke.\r\n\r\nOnce only had Blake looked back to see if the girl was following. After\r\nthat he swung along, with down-bent head, his gaze upon the ground.\r\nEven when he passed in under the grove and around the pool to the foot\r\nof the cleft, he began the ascent without waiting to assist her up the\r\nbreak in the path. The girl came after, her lips firm, her eyes bright\r\nand expectant. She drew herself up the ledge as though she had been bred\r\nto mountain climbing.\r\n\r\nInside the barricade Blake was waiting to close the opening. She crept\r\nthrough, and rose to catch him by the sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Tom, look at me,\" she said. \"Once I was most unjust to you in my\r\nthoughts. I wronged you. Now I must tell you that I think you are the\r\nbravest--the noblest man--\"\r\n\r\n\"Get away!\" he exclaimed, and he shook off her hand roughly. \"Don't\r\nbe a fool! You don't know what you're talking about.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do, Tom. I believe that you are--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a blackguard--do you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"No blackguard is brave. The way you faced that terrible beast--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, blackguard--to've gone and shown to you that I--to've let you\r\nsay a single word--Can't you see? Even if I'm not what you call a\r\ngentleman, I thought I knew how any man ought to treat a woman--but to go\r\nand let you know, before we'd got back among people!\"\r\n\r\n\"But--but, Tom, why not, if we--\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he retorted harshly. \"I'm going now to pile up wood on the\r\ncliff for a beacon fire. In the morning I'll start making that\r\ncatamaran--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you shall not-- You shall not go off, and leave me, and--and risk\r\nyour life! I can't bear to think of it! Stay with me, Tom--dear! Even\r\nif a ship never came--\"\r\n\r\nHe turned resolutely, so as not to see her blushing face.\r\n\r\n\"Come now, Miss Leslie,\" he said in a dry, even tone; \"don't make\r\nit so awfully hard. Let's be sensible, and shake hands on it, like two\r\nreal comrades--\"\r\n\r\nShe struck frantically at his outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\"Keep away--I hate you!\" she cried.\r\n\r\nBefore he could speak, she was running up the cleft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nIN DOUBLE SALVATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen, an hour or more after dawn the next morning, the girl slowly drew\r\nopen her door and came out of the cave, Blake was nowhere in sight. She\r\nsighed, vastly relieved, and hastened across to bathe her flushed face\r\nin the spring. Stopping every few moments to listen for his step down\r\nthe cleft, she gathered up a hamper of food and fled to the tree-ladder.\r\n\r\nAs she drew herself up on the cliff, she noticed a thin column of smoke\r\nrising from the last smouldering brands of a beacon fire that had been\r\nbuilt in the midst of the bird colony, on the extreme outer edge of the\r\nheadland. She did not, however, observe that, while the smoke column\r\nstreamed up from the fire directly skyward, beyond it there was a much\r\nlarger volume of smoke, which seemed to have eddied down the cliff face\r\nand was now rolling up into view from out over the sea. She gave no heed\r\nto this, for the sight of the beacon had instantly alarmed her with the\r\npossibility that Blake was still on the headland, and would imagine that\r\nshe was seeking him.\r\n\r\nShe paused, her cheeks aflame. But the only sign of Blake that she could\r\nsee was the fire itself. She reflected that he might very well have\r\nleft before dawn. As likely as not, he had descended at the north end\r\nof the cleft, and had gone off to the river to start his catamaran. At\r\nthe thought all the color ebbed from her cheeks and left her white and\r\ntrembling. Again she stood hesitating. With a sigh she started on toward\r\nthe signal staff.\r\n\r\nShe was close upon the border of the bird colony, when Blake sat up from\r\nbehind a ledge, and she found herself staring into his blinking eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" he mumbled drowsily. He sprang up, wide awake, and flushing\r\nwith the guilty consciousness of what he had done. \"Look at the sun--way\r\nup! Didn't mean to oversleep, Miss Leslie. You see I was up pretty late,\r\ntending the beacon. But of course that's no excuse--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\" she exclaimed. There were tears in her eyes; yet she smiled\r\nas she spoke. \"I know what you mean by 'pretty late.' You've been\r\nup all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I haven't. Not all night--\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure! I quite understand, Mr. Thomas Blake!... Now, sit down,\r\nand eat this luncheon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't. Haven't time. I've got to get to the river and set to work.\r\nI'll get some jerked beef and eat it on the way. You see--\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom!\" she protested.\r\n\r\n\"It's for you,\" he rejoined, and his lips closed together resolutely.\r\n\r\nHe was stepping past her, when over the seaward edge of the cliff there\r\ncame a sound like the yell of a raging sea-monster.\r\n\r\n\"Siren!\" shouted Blake, whirling about.\r\n\r\nThe cloud of smoke beyond the cliff end was now rolling up more to the\r\nleft. He dashed away towards the north edge of the cliff as though he\r\nintended to leap off into space. The girl ran after him as fast as she\r\ncould over the loose stones. Before she had covered half the distance\r\nshe saw him halt on the very brink of the cliff, and begin to wave and\r\nshout like a madman. A few steps farther on she caught sight of the\r\nsteamer. It was lying close in, only a little way off the north point of\r\nthe headland.\r\n\r\nEven as she saw the vessel, its siren responded to Blake's wild gestures\r\nwith a series of joyous screams. There could be no mistake. He had been\r\nseen. Already they were letting go anchor, and there was a little crowd\r\nof men gathering about one of the boats. Blake turned and started on\r\na run for the cliff. But Miss Leslie darted before him, compelling him\r\nto halt.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" she cried, her eyes sparkling with happy tears. \"Tom, it's\r\ncome now. You needn't--\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me by! I'm going to meet them. I want to--\"\r\n\r\nBut she put her hands upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Tom!\" she whispered, \"let it be now, before any one--anything can\r\npossibly come between us! Let it be a part of our life here--here, where\r\nI've learned how brave and true a real man can be!\"\r\n\r\n\"And then have him prove himself a sneak!\" he cried. \"No; I won't,\r\nJenny! I've got you to think of. Wait till I've seen your father. Ten\r\nto one, he'll not hear of it--he'll cut you off without a cent. Not but\r\nwhat I'd be glad myself; but you're used to luxuries, girlie, and I'm\r\na poor man. I can't give them to you--\"\r\n\r\nShe laid a hand on his mouth, and smiled up at him in tender mockery.\r\n\r\n\"Come, now, Mr. Blake; you're not very complimentary. After surviving\r\nmy cooking all these weeks, don't you think I might do, at a pinch, for\r\na poor man's wife!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Jenny!\" he protested, trying to draw back. \"You oughtn't to\r\ndecide now. When you get back among your friends, things may look\r\ndifferent. Think of your society friends! Wait till you see me with\r\nother men--gentlemen! I'm just a rough, uncultured, ordinary--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" she cried, and she again placed her hand on his mouth. \"You\r\nsha'n't say such cruel things about Tom--my Tom--the man I trust--that\r\nI--\"\r\n\r\nHer arms slipped about his neck, and her eyes shone up into his with\r\ntender radiance.\r\n\r\n\"Don't!\" he begged hoarsely. \"'T ain't fair! I--I can't stand it!\"\r\n\r\n\"The man I love!\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nHe crushed her to him in his great arms.\r\n\r\n\"My little girl!--dear little girl!\" he repeated, and he pressed his\r\nlips to her hair.\r\n\r\nShe snuggled her face closer against his shoulder, and replied in a\r\nvery small voice, \"I--I suppose you know that ship captains can m-marry\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I haven't even a job yet!\" he exclaimed. \"Suppose your father--\"\r\n\r\n\"Please listen!\" she pleaded. There was a sound like suppressed sobbing.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" he ventured, and he listened, greatly perturbed. The\r\nmuffled voice sounded very meek and plaintive: \"I'll try to do my\r\npart, Mr. Blake,--really I will! I--I hope we can manage to struggle\r\nalong--somehow. You know, I have a little of my own. It's only\r\nthree--three million; but--\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" he demanded, and he held her out at arm's length, to stare at\r\nher in frowning bewilderment. \"If I'd known that, I'd--\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd never have given me a chance to--to propose to you, you dear\r\nold silly!\" she cried, her eyes dancing with tender mirth. \"See here!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned from him, and back again, and held up a withered, crumpled\r\nflower. He looked, and saw that it was the amaryllis blossom.\r\n\r\n\"You--kept it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Because--because, even then, down in the bottom of my heart, I had\r\nbegun to realize--to know what you were like--and of course that meant--\r\nTom, tell me! Do you think I'm utterly shameless? Do you blame me for\r\nbeing the one to--to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Blame you!\" he cried. He paused to put a finger under her chin and\r\nraise her down-bent face. His eyes were very blue, but there was a\r\ntwinkle in their depths. \"Oh, yes; it was dreadful, wasn't it? But\r\nI guess I've no complaint to file just now.\"\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPopular Copyright Books\r\n\r\nAT MODERATE PRICES\r\n\r\n  Any of the following titles can be bought of\r\n  your bookseller at 50 cents per volume.\r\n\r\n    The Shepherd of the Hills.
