The rock, still\r\nretaining its stratification, was deposited layer upon layer\r\nhorizontally mostly as sand upon the floor of a sea which covered the\r\nregion fully 25,000,000 years ago. That the sea was of very early\r\nPaleozoic (i.e., Cambrian) age has been proved by fossils in associated\r\nstrata. Long after their deep burial and consolidation within the\r\nearth, the strata were subjected to tremendous mountain-making\r\npressure, notably altered to a rock called \"Quartzite,\" raised high\r\nabove sea level, and tilted almost vertically. Then through long ages\r\n(millions of years) overlying rocks of great thickness have been cut\r\naway (eroded) by weathering and stream action, laying bare the ledge as\r\nwe see it to-day._\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Popular Science Library\r\n\r\n                            EDITOR-IN-CHIEF\r\n                          GARRETT P.

Each of the relatively few scientific terms is explained where\r\nfirst used in the text, and a glossary of common geological terms has\r\nbeen appended.\r\n\r\nThe matter of illustrations has received very careful attention, and\r\nonly pictures, maps, and diagrams are used which actually illustrate\r\nimportant features of the text. A special point has been made to\r\nintroduce only cuts of simple construction comparatively free from\r\ntechnicalities. Nearly every illustration is accompanied by a really\r\nexplanatory title.\r\n\r\nA number of the pictures are from the author's collection of\r\nphotographs, and many of the line-cuts have either been made or\r\nconsiderably modified by the author. Among the numerous sources of\r\nillustrations, special mention should be made of the United States\r\nGeological Survey, the New York State Museum, the American Museum\r\nof Natural History, the University of Chicago Press, and various\r\nindividuals, full credit being given wherever due.\r\n\r\n                                                  William J.

The person of ordinary intelligence,\r\nsurrounded as he is by a great variety of physical features, is, unless\r\nhe has devoted some study to the subject, very likely to regard those\r\nfeatures as practically unchangeable, and to think that they are now\r\nessentially as they were in the beginning of the earth's history. Some\r\nof the most fundamental ideas taught in this book are that the physical\r\nfeatures of the earth, as we behold them to-day, represent but a single\r\nphase of a very long-continued history; that significant changes\r\nare now going on all around us; and that we are able to interpret\r\npresent-day earth features only by an understanding of earth changes in\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n_Geology_, meaning literally \"earth science,\" deals with the history of\r\nthe earth and its inhabitants as revealed in the rocks. The science is\r\nvery broad in its scope. It treats of the processes by which the earth\r\nhas been, and is now being, changed; the structure of the earth; the\r\nstages through which it has passed; and the evolution of the organisms\r\nwhich have lived upon it.\r\n\r\n_Geography_ deals with the distribution of the earth's physical\r\nfeatures, in their relation to one another, to the life of sea and\r\nland, and human life and culture. It is the present and outward\r\nexpression of geological effects.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the work of many able students of geology during the\r\npast century and a quarter, it is now well established that our planet\r\nhas a definitely recorded history of many millions of years, and that\r\nduring the lapse of those eons, revolutionary changes in earth features\r\nhave occurred, and also that there has been a vast succession of\r\nliving things which, from very early times, have gradually passed from\r\nsimple into more and more complex forms. The physical changes and the\r\norganisms of past ages have left abundant evidence of their character,\r\nand the study of the rock formations has shown that within them we have\r\na fairly complete record of the earth's history. Although very much yet\r\nremains to be learned about this old earth, it is a remarkable fact\r\nthat man, through the exercise of his highest faculty, has come to know\r\nso much concerning it.\r\n\r\nThe following words, by the late Professor Barrell, admirably summarize\r\nthe significance of geological history. \"The great lesson taught by the\r\nstudy of the outer crust is that the earth mother, like her children,\r\nhas attained her present form through ceaseless change, which marks\r\nthe pulse of life and which shall cease only when her internal forces\r\nslumber and the cloudy air and surf-bound ocean no more are moving\r\ngarments. The flowing landscapes of geologic time may be likened to a\r\nkinetoscopic panorama. The scenes transform from age to age, as from\r\nact to act; seas and plains and mountains of different types follow and\r\nreplace each other through time, as the traveler sees them succeed each\r\nother in space. At times the drama hastens, and unusual rapidity of\r\ngeologic action has, in fact, marked those epochs since man has been\r\na spectator upon the earth. Science demonstrates that mountains are\r\ntransitory forms, but the eye of man through all his lifetime sees no\r\nchange, and his reason is appalled at the conception of a duration so\r\nvast that the milleniums of written history have not accomplished the\r\nshifting of even one of the fleeting views which blend into the moving\r\npicture.\"[A]\r\n\r\n[A] Central Connecticut in the Geologic Past, pp. 1-2.\r\n\r\nOr in the words of Tennyson:\r\n\r\n  There rolls the deep where grew the tree.\r\n  O, earth, what changes hast thou seen!\r\n  There where the long street roars, hath been\r\n  The stillness of the central sea.\r\n  The hills are shadows, and they flow\r\n  From form to form, and nothing stands;\r\n  They melt like mist, the solid lands,\r\n  Like clouds they shape themselves and go.\r\n\r\nThe following statement of some of the more definite important\r\nconclusions regarding earth changes may serve to make still clearer the\r\ngeneral scope of the science of geology. The evidences upon which these\r\nconclusions are based are discussed in various parts of this book. For\r\nuntold millions of years the rocks at and near the earth's surface\r\nhave been crumbling; streams have been incessantly sawing into the\r\nlands; the sea has been eating into continental masses; the winds have\r\nbeen sculpturing desert lands; and, more intermittently and locally,\r\nglaciers have plowed through mountain valleys, and even great sheets of\r\nice have spread over considerable portions of continents. Throughout\r\ngeologic time, the crust of the earth has shown marked instability.\r\nSlow upward and downward movements of the lands relative to sea level\r\nhave been very common, in many cases amounting to even thousands of\r\nfeet. Various parts of the earth have been notably affected by sudden\r\nmovements (resulting in earthquakes) along fractures in the outer\r\ncrust. During millions of years molten materials have, at various\r\ntimes, been forced into the earth's crust, and in many cases to its\r\nsurface. Mountain ranges have been brought forth and cut down. The site\r\nof the Appalachian Mountains was, millions of years ago, the bottom of\r\na shallow sea. Lakes have come and gone. The Great Lakes have come into\r\nexistence very recently (geologically), that is to say, since the great\r\nIce Age. A study of stratified rocks of marine origin shows that all,\r\nor nearly all, of the earth's surface has at some time, or times, been\r\ncovered by sea water. Over certain districts the sea has transgressed\r\nand retrogressed repeatedly. Organisms have inhabited the earth for\r\nmany millions of years. In earlier known geologic time, the plants and\r\nanimals were comparatively simple and low in the scale of organization,\r\nand through the succeeding ages higher and more complex types were\r\ngradually evolved until the highly organized forms of the present time,\r\nincluding the human race, were produced.\r\n\r\nThe rocks of the earth constitute the special field of study for the\r\ngeologist because they contain the records of events through which the\r\nearth and its inhabitants have passed during the millions of years of\r\ntime until their present conditions have been reached. All the rocks of\r\nthe earth's crust may be divided into three great classes: _igneous_,\r\n_sedimentary_, and _metamorphic_.\r\n\r\n_Igneous_ rocks comprise all those which have ever been in a molten\r\ncondition, and of these we have the _volcanic_ rocks (for example,\r\nlavas), which have cooled at or near the surface; _plutonic_ rocks (for\r\nexample, granites), which have cooled in great masses at considerable\r\ndepths below the surface; and the _dike_ rocks which, when molten, have\r\nbeen forced into fissures in the earth's crust and there cooled.\r\n\r\n_Sedimentary_ rocks comprise all those which have been deposited under\r\nwater, except some wind-blown deposits, and they are nearly always\r\narranged in layers (stratified). Such rocks are called strata. They may\r\nbe of mechanical origin such as clay or mud which hardens to _shale_;\r\nsand, which consolidates into _sandstone_; and gravel, which when\r\ncemented becomes _conglomerate_. They may be of organic origin such as\r\nlimestone, most of which is formed by the accumulation of calcareous\r\nshells; _flint_ and _chert_, which are accumulations of siliceous\r\nshells; or _coal_, which is formed by the accumulation of partly\r\ndecayed organic matter. Or, finally, they may be formed by chemical\r\nprecipitation, as beds of _salt_, _gypsum_, _bog iron ore_, etc.\r\n\r\n_Metamorphic_ rocks include both sedimentary and igneous rocks which\r\nhave been notably changed from their original condition. Traces or\r\nremains of plants and animals preserved in the rocks are known as\r\nfossils. The term originally meant anything dug out of the earth,\r\nwhether organic or inorganic, but for many years it has been strictly\r\napplied to organic remains. Many thousands of species of fossils are\r\nknown from rocks of all ages except the oldest, and more are constantly\r\nbeing brought to light, but these represent only a small part of\r\nthe life of past ages because relatively few organic remains were\r\ndeposited under conditions favorable for preservation in fossil form.\r\nThe fossils in the rocks are, however, a fair average of the groups of\r\norganisms to which they belong. It is really remarkable that such a\r\nvast number of fossils are imbedded in the rocks, and from a study of\r\nthese many fundamental conclusions regarding the history of life on our\r\nplanet may be drawn.\r\n\r\nAs early as the fifth century B. C., Xenophanes is said to have\r\nobserved fossil shells and plants in the rocks of Paros, and to\r\nhave attributed their presence to incursions of the sea over the\r\nland. Herodotus, about a century later, came to a similar conclusion\r\nregarding fossil shells in the mountains of Egypt. None of the\r\nancients, however, seemed to have the slightest conception of the\r\nsignificance of fossils as time markers in the history of the earth.\r\n(See discussion below.)\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, distinguished writers held curious views regarding\r\nfossils. Thus Avicenna (980-1037) believed that fossils represented\r\nunsuccessful attempts on the part of nature to change inorganic\r\nmaterials into organisms within the earth by a peculiar creative force\r\n(_vis plastica_). About two centuries later, Albertus Magnus held\r\na somewhat similar view. Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), the famous\r\nartist, architect, and engineer, while engaged in canal building in\r\nnorthern Italy, saw fossils imbedded in the rocks, and concluded\r\nthat these were the remains of organisms which actually lived in\r\nsea water which spread over the region. During the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries, many correctly held that fossils were really\r\nof organic origin, but it was commonly taught that all fossils\r\nrepresented remains of organisms of an earlier creation which were\r\nburied in the rocks during the great Deluge (Noah's Flood). William\r\nSmith (1769-1839), of England, was, however, the first to recognize\r\nthe fundamental significance of fossils for determining the relative\r\nages of sedimentary rocks. This discovery laid the foundation for the\r\ndetermination of earth chronology which is of great importance in the\r\nstudy of the history of the earth. (See discussions below.)\r\n\r\nOrganic remains, dating as far back as tens of millions of years, have\r\nbeen preserved in the rocks of the earth in various ways. A very common\r\nkind of fossilization is the preservation of only the hard parts of\r\norganisms. Thus the soft parts have disappeared by decomposition, while\r\nthe hard parts, such as bones, shells, etc., remain. In many cases\r\npractically complete skeletons of large and small animals which lived\r\nmillions of years ago have been found intact in the rocks. Fossils\r\nwhich show none of the original material, but only the shape or form,\r\nare also very abundant. When sediment hardens around an imbedded\r\norganism, and the organism then decomposes or dissolves away, a cavity\r\nor fossil mold only is left. Casts of organisms or parts of them are\r\nformed by filling shells or molds with sediment or with mineral matter\r\ncarried in solution by underground water. Only rarely have casts of\r\nwholly soft animals been found in ancient rocks. In other cases both\r\noriginal form and structure are preserved, but none of the original\r\nmaterial. This is known as petrifaction which takes place when a plant\r\nor hard part of an animal has been replaced, particle by particle,\r\nby mineral matter from solution in underground water. Not uncommonly\r\norganic matter, such as wood, or inorganic matter, such as carbonate\r\nof lime shells, has been so perfectly replaced that the original\r\nstructures are preserved almost as in life. The popular idea that\r\npetrified wood is wood which has been changed into stone is, of course,\r\nincorrect. It is doubtful if flesh has ever been truly petrified. In\r\nmany cases mainly the carbon only of organisms has been preserved.\r\nThis is also true of plants where, under conditions of slow chemical\r\nchange or decomposition, the hydrogen and oxygen mostly disappear,\r\nleaving much of the carbon with original structures often remarkably\r\npreserved. Fine examples are fossil plants in the great coal-bearing\r\nstrata. Much more rarely entire organisms have been preserved either\r\nby freezing or by natural embalmment. Most remarkable are the species\r\nof mammoths and rhinoceroses, extinct for thousands of years, bodies\r\nof which, with flesh, hide, and hair still intact, have been held in\r\ncold storage in the frozen soils of Siberia, or other cases. Insects\r\nhave been perfectly preserved in amber, as, for example, in the Baltic\r\nregion. This amber is a hardened resin in which the insects were\r\ncaught while it was still soft and exuding from the trees. Finally, we\r\nshould mention the preservation of tracks and trails of land and water\r\nanimals. Thousands of tracks of long-extinct great reptiles occur in\r\nthe sandstones and shales of the Connecticut Valley of Massachusetts.\r\nThe footprints were made in soft sandy mud which hardened and then\r\nbecame covered with more sediment.\r\n\r\nFew fossils occur in other than the sedimentary rocks. Most numerous,\r\nby far, are fossils in rocks of marine origin, because on relatively\r\nshallow sea bottoms, where sediments of the geologic ages have\r\nlargely accumulated, the conditions for fossilization have been\r\nmost favorable. Among the many conditions which have produced great\r\ndiversity in numbers and distribution of marine organisms during\r\ngeologic time are temperature, depth of water, clearness of water,\r\nnature of sea bottom, degree of salinity, and food supply. River\r\nand lake deposits also not uncommonly contain remains of organisms\r\nwhich inhabited the waters, but also others which were carried in.\r\n\"Surrounding trees drop their leaves, flowers, and fruit upon the mud\r\nflats, insects fall into the quiet waters, while quadrupeds are mired\r\nin mud or quicksand and soon buried out of sight. Flooded streams bring\r\nin quantities of vegetable debris, together with carcasses of land\r\nanimals drowned by the sudden rise of the flood\" (W. B. Scott).\r\n\r\nIn the study of the many changes which have taken place in the history\r\nof the earth, a fundamental consideration is the determination of\r\nthe relative ages of the rocks, especially the strata. How can the\r\ngeologist assign a rock formation of any part of the earth to a\r\nparticular age in the history of the earth? How can it be proved that\r\ncertain rock formations in various parts of the earth originated\r\npractically at the same time? There are two important criteria.\r\nFirst, in any region where the strata have not been disturbed from\r\ntheir normal order, the older strata underlie the younger because the\r\nunderlying sediments must have been deposited first. Now, the total\r\nthickness of the stratified series of the earth has been estimated to\r\nbe no less than 200,000 feet and only a small part of this is actually\r\npresent in any given locality or region. It is, therefore, evident\r\nthat the order of superposition of strata is in itself not sufficient\r\nfor the determination of the relative ages of all the strata in even\r\na considerable portion of a single continent, not to mention its utter\r\ninadequacy in building up the geological column of the whole earth.\r\nWhen, however, the second criterion, namely, the fossil content of the\r\nstrata, is used in direct connection with the order of superposition,\r\nwe have the real basis for determining the relative ages of strata for\r\nall parts of the earth. The discovery of this method was very largely\r\ndue to the painstaking field work in England by William Smith about the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-established fact that organisms have inhabited the earth\r\nfor many millions of years and that, through the geologic ages,\r\nthey have continuously changed, with gradual development of higher\r\nand higher types. Tens of thousands of species have come and gone.\r\nAccepting this fact, it is then clear that strata which were formed\r\nat notably different times must contain notably different fossils,\r\nwhile strata which accumulated at practically the same time contain\r\nsimilar fossils, allowing, of course, for reasonable differences in\r\ngeographical distribution of organisms as at the present time. Each\r\nepoch of earth history or series of strata has its characteristic\r\nassemblage of organisms. In short, \"a geological chronology is\r\nconstructed by carefully determining, first of all, the order of\r\nsuperposition of the stratified rocks, and next by learning the fossils\r\ncharacteristic of each group of strata.... The order of succession\r\namong the fossils is determined from the order of superposition of\r\nthe strata in which they occur. When that succession has been thus\r\nestablished, it may be employed as a general standard\" (W. B. Scott).\r\nIt should, however, be borne in mind that precise contemporaneity of\r\nstrata in widely separated districts can rarely, if ever, be determined\r\nbecause of the very great length of geologic time and the general\r\nslowness of the evolution of organisms. Rocks carrying remarkably\r\nsimilar fossils may really be several thousand years different in age;\r\nbut this is, indeed, a very small limit of error when one considers the\r\nvast antiquity of the earth. Much very accurate and satisfactory work\r\nhas been done, especially in Europe and North America, in correlating\r\nstrata and assigning them to their places in the geological time table\r\n(see below), but a vast amount of work yet remains to be done before\r\nthe task is complete.\r\n\r\nCertain types or species of organisms are much more useful than others\r\nin the determination of earth chronology. Best of all for world-wide\r\ncorrelations are species which were widely distributed and which\r\npersisted for relatively short times. Thus any species which lived in\r\nthe surface waters of the ocean and was easily distributed over wide\r\nareas, while, at the same time, it existed as such only a short time,\r\nis the best type of chronologic indicator.\r\n\r\nThe known history of the earth has been more or less definitely divided\r\ninto great eras and lesser periods and epochs, constituting what may\r\nbe called the geologic time scale. In the accompanying table the era\r\nand period names, except those representing earlier time, are mostly\r\nworld-wide in their usage. Epoch names, being more or less locally\r\napplied, are omitted from the table. Very conservative estimates of\r\nthe length of time represented by the eras and the most characteristic\r\ngeneral features of the life of the main divisions are also given.\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL DIVISIONS OF GEOLOGIC TIME\r\n\r\n(Modified after U.

The one is measured\r\nby thousands of years, while the other must be measured by tens of\r\nmillions of years. Just as we may roughly divide human history into\r\ncertain ages according to some notable person, nation, principle, or\r\nforce as, for example, the \"Age of Pericles,\" the \"Roman Period,\"\r\nthe \"Age of the French Revolution,\" or the \"Age of Electricity,\" so\r\ngeologic history may be subdivided according to great predominant\r\nphysical or organic phenomena, such as \"the Appalachian Mountain\r\nRevolution\" (toward the end of the Paleozoic era), the \"Age of Fishes\"\r\n(Devonian period), or the \"Age of Reptiles\" (Mesozoic era).\r\n\r\nIn the study of earth history, as in the study of human history, it\r\nis important to distinguish between events and records of events.\r\nHistorical events are continuous, but they are by no means all\r\nrecorded. Records of events are often interrupted and seemingly sharply\r\nseparated from each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWEATHERING AND EROSION\r\n\r\n\r\nAll rocks at and near the surface of the earth crumble or decay.\r\nThe term \"weathering\" includes all the processes whereby rocks are\r\nbroken up, decomposed, or dissolved. A mass of very hard and seemingly\r\nindestructible granite, taken from a quarry, will, in a very short\r\ntime, geologically considered, crumble (Plate 1). During the short\r\nspan of the ordinary human life weathering effects are generally of\r\nvery little consequence, but during the long ages of geologic time the\r\nvarious processes of weathering have been slowly and ceaselessly at\r\nwork upon the outer crust of the earth, and such tremendous quantities\r\nof rock material have been broken up that the lands of the earth have\r\neverywhere been profoundly affected.\r\n\r\nMost of us have noticed buildings and monuments in which the stones\r\nshow marked effects of weathering. A good case in point is Westminster\r\nAbbey, London, in which many of the stones are badly weathering, some\r\nof the more ornamental parts having crumbled beyond recognition since\r\nthe building was erected in the thirteenth century. In many countries,\r\ntombstones and monuments only one or two centuries old are so badly\r\nweathered that the inscriptions are scarcely if at all legible.\r\n\r\nWhat are some of the processes of nature whereby rocks are weathered?\r\nIn cold countries, and often in mountains of generally mild climate\r\nregions, the alternate freezing and thawing of water is a potent agency\r\nin breaking up rocks where the soils are thin or absent. On freezing,\r\nwater expands about one-tenth of its volume and exerts the enormous\r\npressure of over 2,000 pounds per square inch. Nearly all relatively\r\nhard rock formations are separated into more or less distinct blocks by\r\nnatural cracks called \"joints\" (Plate 8). Very commonly the rocks also\r\ncontain minute crevices, fissures, and pores. Repeated freezing and\r\nthawing of water which finds its way into such openings finally causes\r\neven the most resistant rocks to break up into smaller and smaller\r\nfragments. A very striking example of difference in climatic effect\r\nupon a given rock mass is the obelisk in Central Park, New York. For\r\nmany centuries this famous monument stood practically without change in\r\nthe dry, frostless climate of Egypt, but very soon after its removal to\r\nthe moist, frosty climate of New York, it began to crumble so rapidly\r\nthat it was necessary to cover it with a coating of glaze to protect it\r\nfrom the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nTemperature change, especially in dry regions, is also an important\r\nagency for mechanical breaking up of rocks. On high mountains and on\r\ndeserts, a daily range of temperature of from 70 degrees to 80 degrees\r\nis frequent. Due to heat absorption, rocks in desert regions, during\r\nthe day, not uncommonly reach temperatures of fully 120 degrees, while\r\nduring the night, due to heat radiation, their temperature falls\r\ngreatly. During the heating of the outer portion of the rock, the\r\nvarious minerals each expand differently, thus setting up a series\r\nof stresses and strains tending to cause the minerals to pull apart.\r\nThe outer portions of the rocks which are subjected to unstable and\r\nrelatively rapid temperature changes, often crack or peel off in slabs\r\nor flakes, this process being called exfoliation. Stone Mountain in\r\nGeorgia, and some of the mountains of the southern Sierra Nevada range\r\nin California, are excellent examples of mountains which are being\r\nrounded off by exfoliation. The principle is the same as that which\r\ncauses the \"spalling\" of stones in buildings during fires.\r\n\r\nMasses of débris consisting of more or less angular rock fragments of\r\nall sizes commonly occur at the bases of cliffs and mountains. They\r\nrepresent materials which have weathered off the ledges mainly by frost\r\naction and temperature changes.\r\n\r\nWhere electrical storms are frequent, lightning often shatters\r\nportions of rock ledges. Many such cases have come under the writer's\r\nobservation in the Adirondack Mountains of New York. The total effect\r\nof lightning as a weathering agency is, however, relatively small.\r\n\r\nAnother minor weathering effect is the mechanical action of plants. The\r\nprinciple is well illustrated by the breaking or tilting of sidewalks\r\nby the wedging action of the growing roots of trees. In many places the\r\nroots of plants growing in cracks in rocks, exert powerful pressure\r\ncausing the rocks or blocks of rocks to wedge apart.\r\n\r\nLet us now briefly consider some of the chemical processes of\r\nweathering. The solvent effect of perfectly pure water upon rocks is\r\nvery slight and slow. But such water is not found in nature because\r\ncertain atmospheric gases, especially oxygen and carbonic acid gas, are\r\nalways present in it, and they notably increase the solvent power of\r\nthe water. Such water has the power to slowly but completely dissolve\r\nthe common rock called limestone which consists of carbonate of lime.\r\nThis material is then carried away by the streams. Rocks, like certain\r\nsandstones which contain carbonate of lime cementing material, are\r\ncaused to crumble due to removal of the cement in solution. Carbonic\r\nacid gas in water also has the power to chemically alter various\r\nminerals in many common rocks and thus the rocks fall apart and the\r\ncarbonates which result from the action usually are carried away in\r\nsolution. One of the most important changes of this kind takes place\r\nwhen the very common mineral feldspar is attacked by water containing\r\ncarbonic acid gas and the mineral alters to a soluble carbonate, kaolin\r\n(or clay) and silica.\r\n\r\nThe oxygen, both of the air and that which is contained in water, is\r\na very important chemical agent of decomposition of many rocks. Water\r\nat the surface and the upper part of the crust of the earth as well\r\nas moisture in the air are also important chemical agents which bring\r\nabout rock decay. We are all familiar with the rusting of iron which\r\nis due to the chemical union of the iron with oxygen, thus forming an\r\niron oxide which in turn commonly unites with water from air or earth.\r\nNow, many rocks contain iron, not as such, but held in combination with\r\nother substances in the form of various minerals, and this iron of the\r\nrocks, where subjected to the oxygen and moisture of air or water,\r\nslowly unites with the oxygen and water to form a hydrated iron oxide\r\nwhich is essentially iron-rust. The minerals containing considerable\r\niron are, therefore, decomposed and the rocks crumble. There are\r\nvarious iron oxides, usually more or less hydrated, ranging in color\r\nfrom red through brown to yellow, and these constitute probably\r\nthe most common and striking colors of the rocks of the earth. The\r\ngorgeously colored Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River is a very fine\r\nexample of large scale coloring due to development of much hydrated\r\noxide of iron during the weathering of lava rock, the process having\r\nbeen aided by the action of heated underground waters.\r\n\r\nMost of the soils of the earth are the direct result of weathering.\r\nImportant exceptions are soils which have been transported by the\r\naction of water, ice, or wind. Although the process of weathering is\r\nvery slow and relatively superficial, it is, nevertheless, true that\r\nin many places, the products of weathering form faster than they can\r\nbe carried away. Such weathered materials accumulate in their place\r\nof origin to form soils. The upper few hundred feet of the earth's\r\ncrust is everywhere more or less fractured and porous and the rocks\r\nare there affected in varying degrees by most of the ordinary agents\r\nof weathering. In such cases, outside the areas which were recently\r\ncovered by ice during the great Ice Age, it is common to find the loose\r\nsoil grading downward into rotten rock, and this in turn into the fresh\r\npractically unaltered bedrock. Soils of this kind are generally not\r\nmore than ten or twenty feet deep, though under exceptional conditions,\r\nas in parts of Brazil, they attain depths of several hundred feet.\r\n\r\nIn order to make still clearer some of the above principles of\r\nweathering and also to give the reader some understanding of the most\r\ncommon types of residual soils, we shall consider what happens to a\r\nfew rather definite types of ordinary rocks when they are subjected to\r\nweathering. A very simple case is that of a sandstone, the mineral\r\ngrains (mostly quartz) of which are held together by carbonate of\r\nlime. The lime simply dissolves and is carried away, while many of\r\nthe mineral grains may remain to form a soil of nearly pure sand.\r\nWhere oxide of iron forms the cementing material, the rock yields less\r\nreadily to weathering, and the sandy soil will be yellowish brown or\r\nred according to the climate. Another simple case is that of limestone\r\nwhich when perfectly pure yields no soil because it is all soluble.\r\nPure limestone is, however, rare, and the various mineral impurities\r\nin it, being to a considerable degree insoluble, tend to remain to\r\nform a residual soil which may vary from sandy to clayey, and usually\r\nbrown or red due to the setting free of oxides of iron. According to\r\none estimate a thickness of about 100 feet of a certain fairly impure\r\nlimestone formation in Virginia must weather to yield a layer of soil\r\none foot thick. Soils of this kind, which are usually rich, are common\r\nin many limestone valleys of the Appalachian Mountains. In the case of\r\nshale rock, which is hardened mud, the cementing materials are removed,\r\nsome chemical changes in the minerals may take place, and the rock\r\ncrumbles to a claylike soil. What happens to a very hard, resistant\r\nigneous rock like granite when attacked by the weather? Such a rock\r\nalways consists mainly of the two very common minerals feldspar and\r\nquartz, usually with smaller amounts of other minerals such as mica,\r\nhornblende, augite, or magnetite. The feldspar, which when fresh is\r\nharder than steel, slowly yields when attacked by water containing\r\ncarbonic acid gas and crumbles or decays to a mixture of kaolin (clay),\r\ncarbonate of potash, and silica (quartz). Clay is an important\r\nconstituent of most good soils, while the carbonate of potash is\r\nessential as a food for most plants. Due to yielding of the grains\r\nor crystals of feldspar, the granite falls apart (see Plate 1). The\r\ngrains of quartz remain chemically unchanged, though they may be more\r\nor less broken by changes of temperature, and the other minerals, which\r\nare mostly iron-bearing, yield more or less to weathering, resulting\r\nin a variety of products, among which are oxides of iron. A typical\r\ngranite, therefore, gives rise to a good heavy soil which is yellow,\r\nbrown or red according to climate. Such granite soils are common in\r\nmany parts of the Piedmont Plateau from Maryland to Georgia. Most of\r\nthe dark-colored igneous rocks, like ordinary basaltic lava, contain\r\nmuch feldspar, various iron-bearing minerals, and little or no quartz.\r\nSuch rocks yield to the weather like granite but, because of lack of\r\nquartz, the soils are more clayey. Rich soils of this kind occur in the\r\ngreat lava fields of the northwestern United States and in the Hawaiian\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the breaking down of feldspar under the influence of\r\nthe weather, as above described, not only from the standpoint of soil\r\ndevelopment, but also as regards the wearing down of the lands of the\r\nearth, is difficult to overemphasize because that mineral is by far the\r\nmost abundant constituent of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nThe term \"erosion\" is one of the most important in geologic science.\r\nIt comprises all the processes whereby the lands of the earth are\r\nworn down. It involves the breaking up of earth material, and its\r\ntransportation through the agency of water, ice, or wind. Weathering,\r\nincluding the various subprocesses as above described, is a very\r\nimportant process of erosion. By this process much rock material is\r\ngot into condition for transportation. Another process of erosion,\r\ncalled \"corrasion,\" consists in the rubbing or bumping of rocks\r\nfragments of all sizes carried by water, ice, or wind against the\r\ngeneral country rock, thus causing the latter to be gradually worn\r\naway. A fine illustration of exceedingly rapid corrasion of very hard\r\nrock was that of the Sill tunnel in Austria, which was paved with\r\ngranite blocks several feet thick. Water carrying large quantities of\r\nrock fragments over the pavement at high velocity caused the granite\r\nblocks to be worn through in only one year. Ordinarily in nature,\r\nhowever, the rate of wear is much slower than this. Pressure exerted\r\nupon the country rock by any agency of transportation may cause\r\nrelatively loose joint blocks, into which most rock formations are\r\nseparated, to be pushed away. This process, called \"plucking,\" is\r\nespecially effective in the case of flowing ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSTREAM WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nMost streams are incessantly at work cutting or eroding their way into\r\nthe earth's crust and carrying off the products of weathering. By this\r\nmeans the general level of lands is gradually being reduced to nearer\r\nand nearer sea level. Base level of erosion is reached when any stream\r\nhas eroded to its greatest possible depth, and a whole region is said\r\nto be base-leveled when, by the action of streams, it has been reduced\r\nto a practically flat condition. A region of this kind is known as a\r\n\"peneplain.\"\r\n\r\nTo one who has not seriously considered the matter, the power of even\r\nmoderately swift water to transport rock débris seems incredible.\r\nA well-established law of transportation by running water is that\r\nthe transporting power of a current varies as the sixth power of its\r\nvelocity. For example, a current which is just able to move a rock\r\nfragment of a given size will, when its velocity is merely doubled, be\r\nable to move along a piece of similar rock sixty-four times as large!\r\nThat this must be the case may be readily proved as follows: A current\r\nof given velocity is just able to move a block of rock, say, of one\r\ncubic inch in the form of a cube. A cubic block sixty-four times as\r\nlarge has a face of sixteen square inches. By doubling the velocity of\r\nthe current, therefore, twice as much water must strike each of the\r\nsixteen square inches of the face of the larger block with twice the\r\nforce, thus exerting sixty-four times the power against the face of the\r\nlarger block, or enough to move it along. This surprising law accounts\r\nfor the fact that in certain floods, like the one which rushed over\r\nJohnstown, Pennsylvania, in 1889, locomotives, massive iron bridges,\r\nand great bowlders were swept along with great velocity. It is obvious,\r\nthen, that ordinarily swift rivers in time of flood accomplish far more\r\nwork of erosion (especially transportation) than during many days or\r\neven some months of low water.\r\n\r\nFew people have the slightest idea as to the enormous amount of earth\r\nmaterial which the rivers are carrying into the sea each year. The\r\nburden carried by the Mississippi River has been carefully studied for\r\nmany years. Each year this river discharges about 400,000,000 tons of\r\nmaterial in suspension; 120,000,000 tons in solution; and 40,000,000\r\ntons rolled along the bottom. This all represents earth material\r\neroded from the drainage basin of the river. It is sufficient to cover\r\na square mile 325 feet deep, or if placed in ordinary freight cars\r\nit would require a train reaching around the earth several times to\r\ncontain it. Since the drainage basin of the Mississippi covers about\r\n1,250,000 square miles, it is, therefore, evident that this drainage\r\narea is being worn down at the average rate of about one foot in\r\n3,840 years, and this is perhaps, a fair average for the rivers of\r\nthe earth. The Ganges River, being unusually favorably situated for\r\nrapid erosion, wears down its drainage basin about one foot in 1,750\r\nyears. It has been estimated that nearly 800,000,000 tons of material\r\nare annually carried into the sea by the rivers of the United States.\r\nAccording to this the country, as a whole, is being cut down at the\r\nrate of about one foot in 9,000 years. In arriving at this figure it\r\nshould, of course, be borne in mind that the average level of hundreds\r\nof thousands of square miles of the western United States, particularly\r\nthe so-called Great Basin, is practically not being reduced at all\r\nbecause none of the streams there reach the sea.\r\n\r\nDeposition of sediment is an important natural consequence of erosion.\r\nThe destination of most streams is the sea, and where tides are\r\nrelatively slight the sediments discharged mostly accumulate relatively\r\nnear the mouths of the rivers in the form of flat, fan-shaped delta\r\ndeposits. Some rivers, like the Ganges, which carry such unusual\r\nquantities of sediment, are able to construct deltas in spite of\r\nconsiderable tides. Deltas also form in lakes. In most cases, however,\r\nrivers enter the sea where there are considerable tides and their\r\nloads are more widely spread over the marginal sea bottom. But in many\r\ncases some of the sediment does not reach the mouth of the stream. It\r\nis, instead, deposited along its course either where the velocity is\r\nsufficiently checked, as is the case over many flood-plain areas of\r\nrivers, or where a heavily loaded, relatively swift stream has its\r\ngeneral velocity notably diminished. An excellent example of the latter\r\ntype of stream is the Platte River, which is swift and loaded with\r\nsediment in its descent from the Rocky Mountains, but, on reaching\r\nthe relatively more nearly level Nebraska country, it has its current\r\nsufficiently checked to force it to deposit sediment and build up its\r\nchannel along many miles of its course, and this in spite of the fact\r\nthat it still maintains a considerable current. In a mountainous arid\r\nregion a more or less intermittent stream at times of flood becomes\r\nheavily loaded with rock débris and rushes down the mountain side.\r\nOn reaching the valley floor the velocity is greatly checked and most\r\nof the load is deposited at the base of the mountain, successive\r\naccumulations of such materials, called alluvial cones or fans, having\r\nnot uncommonly built up to depths of hundreds, or even several thousand\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 1.--(_a_) Granite Weathering to Soil near\r\nNorthampton, Mass.

The wonderful coloring is due to iron oxides\r\nset free during weathering of the lava rock. (_Photo by Hillers, U. S.\r\nGeological Survey._)]\r\n\r\nAny newly formed land surface, like a recently drained lake bed or\r\npart of the marginal sea bottom which has been raised into land, has\r\na drainage system developed upon it. In the early or youthful stage\r\nof such a new land area lying well above sea level, under ordinary\r\nclimatic conditions a few streams only form and these tend to follow\r\nthe natural or initial slope of the land. These streams carve out\r\nnarrow, steep-sided valleys, and all of them are actively engaged\r\nin cutting down their channels, or, in other words, none of them\r\nhave reached base level, and flood plains and meandering curves are\r\ntherefore lacking. During this youthful stage there are no sharp\r\ndrainage divides; gorges and waterfalls are not uncommonly present;\r\nand the relief of the land in general is not rugged. A good example of\r\nyouthful topography is the region around Fargo, North Dakota, which is\r\npart of the bed of a great recently drained lake. The Grand Canyon of\r\nthe Yellowstone River is an excellent illustration of a youthful valley\r\ncut in a high plateau of geologically recent origin. (Plate 2.)\r\n\r\nAs time goes on, a region in youth gradually gives way to a region in\r\nmaturity, during which stage the maximum number (usually a network)\r\nof streams in broader V-shaped valleys have developed; divisions of\r\ndrainage are sharp; the maximum ruggedness of relief has developed;\r\nthe larger streams only have cut down so near base level that winding\r\n(meandering) courses and flood plains are well developed along them;\r\nand waterfalls and gorges are rarely present. An almost perfect example\r\nof a region in maturity is that around Charleston, West Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe old-age stage develops next in the history of the region, during\r\nwhich only a moderate number of streams remain, most of these being\r\nat or close to base level so that sweeping curves or meanders (Plate\r\n4) and cut-off meanders or \"ox bows\" and wide flood plains are\r\ncharacteristic and common. The relief is greatly subdued and the term\r\n\"rolling country\" might be applied to the moderately hilly region.\r\nDivisions of drainage are, of course, not at all sharp and the valleys\r\nare wide and shallow. Oxbow lakes are common, but gorges and waterfalls\r\nare absent. A region typical of old-age topography is that around\r\nCaldwell, Kansas.\r\n\r\nFinally, after the remaining low hills have been cut down, the region\r\nis in the condition of a broad monotonous plain, practically devoid\r\nof relief, over which the sluggish streams pursue very winding, more\r\nor less shifting or indefinite courses. For the attainment of this\r\nfinal stage (called a \"peneplain\") in the normal cycle of erosion\r\na proportionately very long time is necessary, because the rate of\r\nerosion becomes slower and slower as the region is being cut down.\r\nThen, too, some change of level between the land and the sea is very\r\nlikely to take place before the peneplain stage is reached. It is\r\ndoubtful if any extensive region was ever brought to the condition of\r\na perfect peneplain. Some masses of more resistant or more favorably\r\nsituated rocks are almost sure to maintain at least moderate heights\r\nabove the general plain level. Geologically recently upraised, fairly\r\nwell developed peneplains are southern New England and the great\r\nregion of eastern Canada. The remarkably even sky lines of these\r\nregions mark the peneplain level before the uplift took place, and\r\noccasionally masses, called \"monadnocks\" from Mount Monadnock in\r\nsouthern New Hampshire, rise above the general level. The valleys in\r\nsuch an uplifted peneplain region have been carved out by streams\r\nsince the uplift began. We have positive evidence that more or less\r\nwell-developed peneplains of considerable extent existed in various\r\nparts of the earth at various times during the many millions of years\r\nof known earth history.\r\n\r\nThe normal cycle of erosion which, as outlined above, tends toward the\r\npeneplain condition may be interrupted at any stage by other processes.\r\nAn excellent case in point is the upper Mississippi Valley, which had\r\nreached the old-age stage, even approximating a peneplain, just before\r\nthe great Ice Age. Then, during the withdrawal of the vast sheet of ice\r\nfrom the region toward the close of the Ice Age, extensive deposits\r\n(moraines, etc.) of glacial débris were left irregularly strewn over\r\nthe country, giving rise to many low hills, lake basins, and altered\r\ndrainage lines, in some cases with resultant gorge development. Some\r\ndistinct features of a youthful topography are, therefore, plastered\r\nover what was otherwise a region well along in old age. The general\r\ndistrict around the Dells of Wisconsin River well illustrates this\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nChanges in level between land and sea which take place during the\r\nerosion of a region may also disturb the normal cycle of erosion. For\r\nexample, a region in old age may be considerably upraised so that\r\nthe streams have their velocities notably increased. Such a region\r\nis said to be \"rejuvenated\" and the streams, which are revived in\r\nactivity, begin to cut youthful valleys in the bottom of the old ones\r\nand, after a time, the general surface of the region is subjected to\r\nvigorous erosion and a new cycle of erosion will be carried out unless\r\ninterfered with in some way, as by relative change of level between the\r\nland and the sea. In this connection the history of the topography in\r\nthe general vicinity of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, may be of interest by\r\nway of illustration of the principle just described. The long, narrow,\r\nparallel Appalachian Mountain ridges there rise to about the same\r\nlevel, causing a remarkably even sky line as viewed from one of the\r\nsummits. This even sky line marks approximately the surface of what was\r\na peneplain late in the Mesozoic era. Early in the succeeding Cenozoic\r\nera, the broad peneplain was notably upraised to nearly the present\r\naltitudes of the ridge tops. The revived Susquehanna River left the\r\nold course which it had on the peneplain surface, and began to carve\r\nout its present valley, while tributaries (subsequent streams) to it\r\ndeveloped along belts of weaker rock and thus they formed the present\r\nparallel valleys separated by belts of more resistant rocks which stand\r\nout as ridges. In this way, the mature stage of topography was reached.\r\nVery recently, geologically, the region has been rejuvenated enough to\r\ncause the larger streams to appreciably sink their channels below the\r\ngeneral valley floors. The reader will find a general discussion of\r\nmovements of the earth's crust in a succeeding chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--The submerged Hudson River channel is clearly\r\nshown by the contour lines on the sea floor. Figures indicate depth of\r\nwater in fathoms. Geologically recent sinking of the land has caused\r\nthe \"drowning\" of the river valley. (Coast and Geodetic Survey).]\r\n\r\nIf, for example, a region along the seaboard has reached the mature\r\nstage of erosion, and the land notably subsides relative to sea level,\r\nthe tidewater will enter the lower valleys to form estuaries and the\r\nvalleys are said to be \"drowned.\" The large streams, or at least their\r\nlower courses, are thus obliterated and also the general erosion of the\r\nregion is distinctly diminished. The recently sunken coast of Maine\r\nwell illustrates the idea of \"drowned valleys.\" The drowned valley of\r\nthe lower Hudson River is another fine example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Sketch maps showing how the Shenandoah River\r\ncaptured the upper waters of Beaverdam Creek in Virginia. The abandoned\r\nvalley of the creek across Blue Ridge is now called a \"wind gap.\"\r\n(After B. Willis.)]\r\n\r\nWhat is termed stream \"piracy\" is of special interest in connection\r\nwith stream work. By this is meant the stealing of one stream or\r\npart of a stream by another. We shall here explain only one of the\r\nvarious ways by which stream capture may be effected. One of two\r\nfairly active streams, flowing roughly parallel to each other, is more\r\nfavorably situated and has cut its channel deeper. Its tributaries\r\nare, therefore, more favorable to extension of headwaters and, in\r\ntime, one of its tributaries eats back far enough to tap a branch of\r\nthe less favorably situated stream so that the waters of this branch\r\nare diverted into the more favorably situated stream. The Shenandoah\r\nRiver of Virginia has been such a pirate. This river developed as a\r\ntributary of the Potomac. By headward extension toward the south, the\r\nShenandoah finally tapped and diverted the upper waters of the smaller,\r\nless favorably situated Beaverdam Creek. The notch or so-called \"wind\r\ngap\" through which the upper waters of Beaverdam Creek formerly flowed\r\nacross the Blue Ridge is still plainly visible. Such abandoned water\r\ngaps, known as \"wind gaps,\" are common in the central Appalachian\r\nMountain region.\r\n\r\nA remarkable type of river is one which has been able to maintain\r\nits course through a barrier, even a mountain range, which has been\r\nbuilt across it. Thus, the Columbia River, after flowing many miles\r\nacross the great lava plateau, has maintained its course right across\r\nthe growing Cascade Range by cutting a deep canyon while the mountain\r\nuplift has been in progress. In a similar manner the Ogden River of\r\nUtah has kept its westward course by cutting a deep canyon into the\r\nWasatch Range which has geologically recently, though slowly, risen\r\nacross its path. In no other way can we possibly explain the fact that\r\nsuch a river, rising on one side of a high mountain range, cuts right\r\nacross it.\r\n\r\nA feature of minor though considerable popular interest is the\r\ndevelopment of \"potholes\" by stream action. Where eddies occur, in\r\nrather active streams, rock fragments of varying sizes may be whirled\r\naround in such manner as to corrode or grind the bedrock, resulting\r\nin the development of cylinder-shaped \"potholes.\" Such holes vary in\r\ndiameter up to fifty feet or more in very exceptional cases. In the\r\nproduction of large \"potholes\" many rock fragments are worn away and\r\nnew ones supplied to continue the work. Locally, some stream beds are\r\nhoneycombed with \"potholes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Grand Canyon, Arizona. (From Darton's \"Story of\r\nthe Grand Canyon.\")]\r\n\r\nStrikingly narrow and deep valleys, called gorges and canyons, are\r\nrather exceptional features of stream action. Most wonderful of all\r\nfeatures of this kind is the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River in\r\nArizona. In fact, this canyon takes high rank among the most remarkable\r\nworks of nature. The canyon is over 200 miles long, from 4,000 to 6,000\r\nfeet deep, and from 8 to 15 miles wide. Contrary to popular opinion,\r\nthis mighty canyon is not a result of some violent process, such as\r\nvolcanic action, or the sudden sinking of part of the earth's crust.\r\nNor is it the result of the scouring action of a great glacier. It is\r\nsimply a result of the operation of the ordinary processes of erosion\r\nwhere the conditions have been exceptionally favorable. Some of the\r\nfavorable conditions have been, and are, a large volume of very swift\r\nwater (Colorado River) continually charged with an abundance of rock\r\nfragments for the work of corrasion, and a great thickness of rock\r\nwhich the river must cut through before reaching base-level. Aridity of\r\nclimate also tends to preserve the canyon form. The whole work has been\r\naccomplished in very late geological time, and the tremendous volume of\r\nrock which has been weathered and eroded to produce the canyon has all\r\nbeen carried away by the Colorado River and accumulated in the great\r\ndelta deposit near where the river empties into the Gulf of California.\r\nEven now the canyon is growing deeper and wider because the very active\r\nColorado River is still from 2,000 to 3,000 feet above sea level.\r\nStanding on the southern rim near Grand Canyon station at an altitude\r\nof nearly 7,000 feet, and looking down into the canyon, one beholds a\r\nvast maze of side canyons, high, vertical rock walls which follow very\r\nsinuous courses, giving rise to a steplike topography, and countless\r\nrock pinnacles, towers, and mesas often of mountain-like proportions.\r\nThe side canyons are the result of erosion by tributaries to the main\r\nriver which have gradually developed and worked headward as the main\r\nriver has cut down. The mountain-like sculptured forms which rise out\r\nof the canyon are erosion remnants, or, in other words, masses of rock\r\nwhich were more favorably situated against erosion by either the main\r\nriver or any of its tributaries. All of the rocks of the broader, main\r\nportions of the canyon are strata of Paleozoic age, arranged as a vast\r\npile of almost horizontal layers, including sandstone, limestone,\r\nand shale. Some of these layers, being distinctly more resistant\r\nthan others, stand out in the canyon wall in the form of conspicuous\r\ncliffs, in some cases hundreds of feet high. The very striking color\r\nbands (mostly light gray, red, and greenish gray), which may be traced\r\nin and out along the canyon sides, represent the outcropping edges\r\nof variously colored rock layers. Far down in the canyon lies the\r\nsteep-sided, V-shaped inner gorge, or canyon which is fully 1,000 feet\r\ndeep. The rocks are there not ordinary strata, but rather metamorphic\r\nand igneous rocks, mostly dark gray, not in layers, and about uniformly\r\nresistant to erosion. There is reason to believe that this inner gorge\r\nhas developed mainly since a distinct renewed uplift (rejuvenation)\r\nof the Colorado Plateau after the river began its canyon cutting. The\r\nnarrow, steep-sided inner gorge may thus be readily accounted for and\r\nthe general lack of steplike forms on its sides is due to essential\r\nuniformity of the rock material as regards resistance to erosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Profile and structure section across the\r\nline A-A in Fig. 3. Length of section 10 miles, vertical scale not\r\nexaggerated. The main relief features, and the relations of the rocks\r\nbelow the surface are shown. The granite and gneiss are of Archeozoic\r\nage, and the overlying nearly horizontal strata are of Paleozoic age.\r\n(After Darton, U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nThe wonderful King's River Canyon of the southern Sierras in California\r\nis remarkable for its combined narrowness and depth. It is a steep\r\nV-shaped canyon whose maximum depth is 6,900 feet, carved out in\r\nmostly solid granite by the action of weathering and running water.\r\nSome idea of the vast antiquity of the earth may be gleaned from the\r\nfact that this tremendously deep canyon has been produced by erosion\r\nin one of the most resistant of all known rocks in very late geologic\r\ntime! Conditions favorable for cutting this canyon have been volume and\r\nswiftness of water and a liberal supply of grinding tools.\r\n\r\nAmong the many other great canyons of the western United States brief\r\nmention may be made of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River\r\nin the National Park. The plateau into which the river has cut its\r\nsteep-sided, narrow, V-shaped canyon, with a maximum depth of 1,200\r\nfeet, has been geologically recently built up by outpourings of\r\nvast sheets of lava. The large volume of very swift water, aided by\r\ndecomposition and weakening of the ordinarily very hard rock by the\r\naction of the hot springs, has been able to carve out this deep canyon\r\npractically within the last period of earth history. The deepening\r\nprocess is still vigorously in progress. The wonderful coloring of the\r\nrock, mostly in tones of yellow and brown, is due to the hydrated iron\r\noxides developed during the decay of the iron-bearing minerals of the\r\nlava, the chemical action having been greatly aided by the action of\r\nthe hot waters. (See Plate 2.)\r\n\r\nIn regard to its origin, the marvelous Yosemite Valley, or canyon,\r\nfalls in a somewhat different category, and it is discussed beyond in\r\nconnection with the work of ice. Suffice it to say here that running\r\nwater has been a very important factor in its origin.\r\n\r\nIn New York and New England there are many gorges which have developed\r\nby the action of running water since the Great Ice Age. Famous among\r\nthese are Ausable Chasm and Watkins Glen of New York, and the Flume in\r\nthe White Mountains of New Hampshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Sketch map showing the retreat of the crest\r\nof Niagara Falls from 1842 to 1905, based upon actual surveys. The\r\nretreat of the inner part of the Horseshoe Fall was more than 300 feet.\r\n(Modified by the author after Gilbert, U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving our discussion of the work of running water, we should\r\nbriefly consider waterfalls. True waterfalls originate in a number of\r\nways. Most common of all is what may be termed the \"Niagara type\"\r\nof waterfall. Niagara Falls merit more than passing mention not only\r\nbecause of their scenic grandeur, but also because of the unusual\r\nnumber of geologic principles which their origin and history so clearly\r\nillustrate. Niagara Falls are divided into two main portions, the\r\nCanadian, or so-called \"Horseshoe Fall,\" and the \"American Fall,\"\r\nseparated by a large island. The crest of the American Fall is about\r\n1,000 feet long and nearly straight, while the crest of the Canadian\r\nFall is notably curved inward upstream, and it is about 3,000 feet\r\nlong. The height of the Falls is 167 feet. Downstream from the Falls\r\nthere is a very steep-sided gorge about 200 feet deep and seven miles\r\nlong. The exposed rocks of the region are nearly horizontal layers of\r\nlimestone underlain with shales. Relatively more resistant limestone\r\nforms the crest of the falls, and directly underneath are the much\r\nweaker shales. Herein lies the principle of this type of waterfall\r\nbecause, due to weathering and the swirling action of the water, the\r\nweaker underlying rocks erode faster, thus causing the overlying rock\r\nto overhang so that from time to time blocks of it already more or less\r\nseparated by cracks (joints), fall down and are mostly carried away\r\nin the swift current. Thus the waterfall maintains itself while it\r\nsteadily retreats upstream. Careful estimates based upon observations\r\nmade between 1827 and 1905 show that the Canadian Fall retreated at\r\nthe rate of from three to five feet per year, while the American Fall\r\nretreated during the same time at the rate of only several inches\r\nper year. It has been well established that Niagara Falls came into\r\nexistence soon after the ice of the great Ice Age had retreated\r\nfrom the district. The falls started by plunging over a limestone\r\nescarpment, situated at what is now the mouth of the gorge seven miles\r\ndownstream from the present falls. If we consider the rate of recession\r\nof the falls to have been always five feet per year, the length of time\r\nrequired to cut the gorge would be something over 7,000 years. But\r\nthe problem is not so simple, because we know that, at the time of,\r\nor shortly after, the beginning of the falls, the upper Great Lakes\r\ndrained farther north and not over the falls; and that this continued\r\nfor a considerable, though unknown, length of time. During this\r\ninterval the volume of water in Niagara River was notably diminished,\r\nand hence the recession of the falls must have been slower. On the\r\nother hand, judging by the width of the gorge, the length of the crest\r\nof the falls has generally been considerably less than at present,\r\nwhich in turn means greater concentration of water over the crest\r\nand more rapid wear. Various factors considered, the best estimates\r\nfor the age of the falls vary from 7,000 to 50,000 years, an average\r\nbeing about 25,000 years. Although this figure is not precise, it is,\r\nnevertheless, of considerable geologic interest because it shows that\r\nthe age of Niagara Falls (and gorge) is to be reckoned in some tens of\r\nthousands of years, rather than hundreds of thousands or millions of\r\nyears. Although waterfalls of the Niagara type are the most common of\r\nall, it is by no means necessary that the particular rocks should be\r\nlimestone and shale.\r\n\r\nAnother common kind of waterfall may be termed the \"Yosemite type,\"\r\nso named from the high falls in the Yosemite Valley of California. At\r\nthe great falls of the Yosemite, the rock is a homogeneous granite and\r\nthe undermining process does not operate. Yosemite Creek first plunges\r\nvertically over a granite cliff for 1,430 feet to form the Upper Falls,\r\nwhich must rank among the very highest of all true water falls. The\r\nwater then descends about 800 feet by cascading through a narrow gorge,\r\nafter which it makes a final vertical plunge of over 300 feet. A brief\r\nhistory of the falls is about as follows. A great steep-sided V-shaped\r\ncanyon several thousand feet deep had been carved out by the action\r\nof the Merced River which now flows through the valley. Then, during\r\nthe Ice Age, a mighty glacier plowed through the canyon, filling it\r\nto overflowing. The granite of this district having been unusually\r\nhighly fractured by great vertical joint cracks was relatively easy\r\nprey for ice erosion. Due to its great weight, the erosive power of\r\nthe ice was most potent toward the bottom, successive joint blocks\r\nwere removed, and the valley was thus widened and the sides steepened\r\nor even commonly made practically vertical. (See Plate 6.) After the\r\nmelting of the ice, certain of the streams, like Yosemite Creek and\r\nBridal Veil Creek, were forced to enter the valley by plunging over\r\ngreat perpendicular, granite cliffs which are in reality joint faces.\r\nThis type of waterfall does not retreat, but it constantly diminishes\r\nin height by cutting into the crest. A number of other high falls of\r\nthis kind occur in the Yosemite region, and also in other mountain\r\nvalleys which formerly contained glaciers, as in the Canadian Rockies,\r\nthe Alps, and Norway, the rocks in these regions being of various kinds.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the \"Yellowstone type\" of waterfall a different\r\nprinciple is involved, namely, a distinctly harder or more resistant\r\nmass of rock which extends vertically across the channel of the stream.\r\nAt the Great Falls of the Yellowstone a mass of relatively fresh, hard\r\nlava lies athwart the course of the river, while just below it the lava\r\nhas been much weakened by decomposition. The harder rock therefore\r\nacts as a barrier, while, in the course of time, the weak rock on the\r\ndownstream side has been worn away until a waterfall 308 feet high has\r\ndeveloped. This waterfall does not retreat very appreciably, but it is\r\nprobably increasing in height, due both to the scouring action of the\r\nwater at the base of the fall and the unusual clearness of the river\r\nwater here, thus causing little wear at the crest. It should be noted,\r\nin this connection, that the channel just on the upstream side of the\r\nbarrier cannot be cut down faster than the top of the barrier itself.\r\n\r\nThe famous Victoria Falls of the Zambezi River in South Africa,\r\nrepresents a relatively uncommon type of waterfall. Considering height\r\nof the fall, length of crest, and volume of water, this is perhaps\r\nthe greatest waterfall in the world. The Zambezi River, a mile wide,\r\nplunges over 400 feet vertically into a chasm only a few hundred feet\r\nwide and at right angles to the main course of the stream. The general\r\ncountry rock is hard lava, but locally a narrow belt of the rock has\r\nbeen highly fractured vertically, due to earth movements or faulting\r\n(see explanation beyond) and therefore weakened and more subject\r\nto weathering than the general body of the lava rock. This belt of\r\nweakened rock has been easy prey for erosion by the Zambezi River\r\nand the chasm has there developed. In fact the chasm is still being\r\nincreased in depth. Leaving the chasm toward one end, the river flows\r\nthrough a narrow zig-zag gorge whose position has been determined by\r\nbig joint cracks. The mile-wide crest of the falls is interrupted by\r\na good many ledges and even small islands. The thundering noise of\r\nthis great waterfall is most impressive, but a good complete view is\r\nimpossible because most of the chasm is constantly filled with dense\r\nspray.\r\n\r\nStill another type of waterfall develops by the removal of joint blocks\r\nby the action of running water. Falls of this type are fairly common\r\nthough they seldom attain really great heights. Where the rock in the\r\nbed of a stream is traversed by well-developed vertical joint cracks,\r\nslabs of rock cleaved by the joints may fall away due to weathering or\r\nthey may be pushed away by pressure of the water. Such a fall retreats\r\nupstream by removal of joint blocks even in comparatively homogeneous\r\nrocks. Taughannock Falls, 215 feet high, in southern central New York,\r\nhas developed by this manner in a shaly sandstone. The several falls\r\n(one 50 feet high) in the famous gorge at Trenton Falls, in central New\r\nYork, have developed in this way in limestone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE SEA AND ITS WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the waters of the sea cover nearly three-fourths\r\nof the surface of the earth. We think of the United States as being a\r\nlarge piece of land of over three million square miles--but the sea\r\nis about forty-five times as large, that is, it covers approximately\r\n140,000,000 square miles. It is a remarkable fact that the average\r\ndepth of the great oceans of the earth is nearly two and one-half\r\nmiles. If the sea were universally present everywhere with the same\r\ndepth, it would be almost two miles deep. Yet this vast body of water\r\nis an extremely thin layer when compared with the earth's diameter\r\nof 8,000 miles. The Pacific is the deepest of the oceans with an\r\naverage depth of about two and three-fourths miles. The deepest ocean\r\nwater ever sounded is 32,114 feet (over six miles), not far from\r\nthe Philippine Islands. This is known as the Planet Deep, and was\r\ndiscovered in 1912. Second deepest is 30,930 feet near the island of\r\nGuam. In the Pacific Ocean there are five places where the water is\r\nover five miles deep and eleven places were it is over four miles deep.\r\nThe deepest sounding ever made in the Atlantic Ocean was 27,972 feet,\r\nnot far from Porto Rico.\r\n\r\nMany substances are known to be in solution in sea water, but in spite\r\nof this the composition is remarkably uniform. The most abundant\r\nsubstance by far in solution is common salt. In every 100 pounds of\r\nsea water, there are 3.5 pounds of mineral matter of various kinds\r\ndissolved. Nearly 78 per cent of the dissolved matter is common salt.\r\nThe principal other constituents in solution are chloride and sulphate\r\nof magnesia, and the sulphates of lime and potash. All other dissolved\r\nmineral substances together make up less than one per cent of the\r\ntotal. It has been estimated that if all the dissolved mineral matter\r\nshould be brought together, it would form a layer 175 feet thick over\r\nthe whole sea bottom. The salts of the sea have been mostly supplied by\r\nthe rivers, which in turn have derived them from the disintegration and\r\nchemical decay of the rocks.\r\n\r\nIf we make a general comparison with the surface of the land, the\r\nfloor of the ocean is a vast monotonous plain. None of the sea bottom\r\ncompares with the ruggedness of mountains, and even the more level\r\nportions of land surface show many sharp minor irregularities such as\r\nstream trenches. But the sea bottom is characterized by its smoothness\r\nof surface. There are under the sea, however, mountain-like ridges,\r\nplateaus, submarine volcanoes and valleys known as \"deeps.\" But these\r\nrarely show ruggedness of relief like similar features on land.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable relief features of the ocean bottom is the\r\nso-called \"continental shelf.\" This is a relatively narrow platform\r\ncovered by shallow water bordering nearly all the lands of the earth.\r\nSeaward, the depth of water is greatest, and it is seldom over 600 or\r\n800 feet. The continental shelves of the world cover about 10,000,000\r\nsquare miles or about one-fourteenth of the area of the sea.\r\n\r\nViewed in a broad way, there are two great classes of marine deposits;\r\nfirst, those laid down comparatively near the borders of the land,\r\nthat is, on the continental shelf and continental slope, and second,\r\nthe abysmal deposits laid down on the bottom of the deep ocean. Those\r\nfound along and near the continental borders are largely land-derived\r\nmaterials, that is to say, they are mostly sediments carried from the\r\nland into the sea by rivers, and to a lesser extent rock material\r\nbroken up by waves along many shores. Practically all such land-derived\r\nmaterial is deposited within 100 to 300 miles of the shores. The\r\ncontinental border deposits are extremely variable. Near shore they\r\nare chiefly gravel and sands, while farther out they become gradually\r\nfiner, and on the continental slope only very fine muds are deposited.\r\nThese deposits usually contain more or less organic materials and\r\nshells or skeletons of organisms. In some cases the shells or skeletons\r\nof organisms predominate or even exist to the exclusion of nearly\r\nall other material, as is true of the coral deposits or reefs which\r\nform only in shallow water. Deposits like those just described as\r\naccumulating on the bottom of the shallow sea, comparatively near the\r\nlands, are of great significance to the geologist because just such\r\nmarine deposits now consolidated into sandstone, conglomerate, shale,\r\nand limestone, are so widely exposed over the various continents.\r\nA knowledge of the conditions under which shallow sea deposits are\r\nnow forming, is, therefore, of great value in interpreting events of\r\nearth history as they are recorded in similar rocks which have been\r\naccumulating through millions of years of time. One specific instance\r\nwill make this matter clearer. Using the method outlined in Chapter I\r\nfor the determination of earth chronology, and our knowledge of present\r\nconditions under which shallow sea deposits are formed, it has been\r\nwell established that a shallow sea spread over fully four-fifths of\r\nthe area of North America during the middle Ordovician period of the\r\nearly Paleozoic era. Beyond this main conclusion, a careful study of\r\nthese rocks has revealed many important facts regarding the physical\r\ngeography, life, and climate of that time. The importance of this whole\r\nmatter is still further emphasized by the statement that five-sixths of\r\nthe exposed rocks of the earth are strata--mostly of shallow sea origin.\r\n\r\nThe deposits on the deep sea bottom are very largely either organic or\r\nthe shells and skeletons of organisms which have fallen to the bottom\r\nfrom near the surface as already explained. Most common of these are\r\nthe deep sea \"oozes\" which are made up of the remains and shells of\r\ntiny organisms called \"foraminifers.\" These \"oozes\" cover about 50\r\nmillion square miles of the sea bottom down to depths of from two to\r\nthree miles.\r\n\r\nAt depths greater than from two to three miles, a peculiar red clay is\r\nthe prevailing deposit. This is most extensive of all, covering an area\r\nof 55 million square miles, or nearly the total area of lands of the\r\nearth. Some remains of organisms are mixed with this clay, but since\r\nmost of the shells are of carbonate of lime and very thin, they are\r\ndissolved without reaching the bottom in the deep sea water which is\r\nunder great pressure and rich in carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\nThe deep sea deposits, both \"oozes\" and red clay, do, however, contain\r\nsome land-derived and other materials. Thus off the west coast of\r\nAfrica some dust carried by the prevailing winds from the Sahara\r\nDesert, is known to fall in the deep sea several hundred miles from\r\nshore. Volcanic dust is carried for many miles and deposited in the\r\ndeep sea--particularly in the South Pacific Ocean. Bits of porous\r\nvolcanic rock called \"pumice\" sometimes float long distances out over\r\nthe deep sea, before becoming water soaked. Icebergs often drift far\r\nout from the polar regions over the deep sea, and on melting the rock\r\ndébris which they carry is dropped to the sea bottom. Also, particles\r\nof iron and dust from meteorites (\"shooting stars\") have been dredged\r\nfrom the deep sea.\r\n\r\nOne important geological significance of the deep sea deposits is\r\nthe proof which they furnish that, from at least as far back as the\r\nbeginning of the Paleozoic era, fully twenty-five million years ago, to\r\nthe present time, the two great deep ocean basins--the Atlantic and the\r\nPacific--have maintained essentially the same positions on the earth.\r\nThis is proved by the fact that nowhere, on any continent among the\r\nrocks of all ages, as old at least as the early Paleozoic, do we find\r\nany really typical deep-sea deposits. There is then no evidence that a\r\ndeep sea ever spread over any considerable part of any continent, and\r\nthis in spite of the fact that marine deposits of shallow water origin\r\nfurnish abundant evidence of former sea extensions. The shallow seas\r\nhave at various times spread over large portions of the continents.\r\n\r\nOn many rocky coasts the waves are incessantly pounding and wearing\r\naway the rocks. In such places the sea, like a mighty horizontal saw,\r\nis cutting into the borders of the lands. The finer materials produced\r\nby the grinding up of the rocks are carried seaward by the undertow.\r\nBut, if the land remains stationary with reference to the sea, this\r\nlandward cutting by the waves reaches a limit. Since even big waves\r\nhave very little effect in water 100 or 200 feet deep, a shelf is cut\r\nby the waves and this shelf, not many miles wide, is covered by shallow\r\nwater. The finer ground-up rock materials carried out by the undertow\r\nare dumped just beyond the edge of the shelf which is thus built out\r\nseaward as a terrace. In traveling over this shelf and terrace, the\r\nwaves, due to friction, lose their power. With gradually sinking land,\r\na much wider shelf may be cut, because the power of the waves is then\r\nallowed to continue.\r\n\r\nIt might be of interest to cite a few cases of relatively rapid coast\r\ndestruction by the waves which have come under human observation. A\r\nremarkable example is the island of Heligoland on which is (or was)\r\nlocated the powerful German fort which guards the entrance to the Kiel\r\nCanal. In the year 800 A. D. this island had 120 miles of shore line;\r\nin 1300 it had 45 miles of shore; in 1649 only 8 miles; and in 1900\r\nbut 3 miles of shore line remained. In southeastern England \"whole\r\nfarms and villages have been washed away in the last few centuries,\r\nthe sea cliffs retreating from 7 to 15 feet a year.\" A church located\r\na mile from the sea shore near the mouth of the Thames river, in the\r\nsixteenth century, now stands on a cliff overlooking the sea. An island\r\nin Chesapeake Bay covered over 400 acres in 1848, and the waves have\r\nsince reduced it to about fifty acres. Study showed that the relatively\r\nsoft unconsolidated strata of the Nashaquitsa Cliffs on the island of\r\nMartha's Vineyard, were cut back at the rate of 5-1/2 feet per year,\r\nbetween 1846 and 1886.\r\n\r\nIf part of the relatively smooth sea bottom should be raised into land,\r\nthe resulting shore line would of course, be regular and free from\r\nindentations or sharp embayments. Examples of such coast which are\r\nvery young are at Cape Nome, Alaska; the northern coast of Spain; and\r\nthe west coast of northern South America. Soon, however, such a shore\r\nline is attacked, and, either where the waves are greatest or the rocks\r\nare weakest, indentations will result and the whole coast is gradually\r\neaten back until the power of the waves is largely spent in traveling\r\nacross the shallow water shelf. Sand bars are then built across the\r\nmouths of the bays or indentations which later the rivers gradually\r\nfill up with sediment. The result is a relatively straight or regular\r\nold shore line. The coast of Texas has about reached this stage.\r\n\r\nIf a portion of the relatively rugged land surface should become\r\nsubmerged under the sea, a very irregular, deeply indented shore line\r\nwould result, due to the entrance of tidewater into the valleys. The\r\ndeeply indented coast of Maine is a fine example of a very irregular\r\nyouthful shore line produced by geologically recent sinking of a\r\nrugged, hilly region so that tidewater backs for miles into the\r\nlower reaches of the river valleys. The promontories and islands are\r\nundergoing rapid wear, and the development of bars across the inlets\r\nhas scarcely begun. Other excellent examples are the coasts of Norway\r\nand southern Alaska. Such a coast is then attacked by the ocean waves\r\nand the promontories are cut back until the broad shallow water shelf\r\nis formed, after which sand bars are built across the remaining\r\nembayments and the shore line becomes relatively regular.\r\n\r\nIt is, then, a remarkable fact that, whether shore lines originate\r\nby emergence of sea bottom, or by sinking of land, there is a very\r\nstrong tendency on the part of nature to develop regular shore lines.\r\nIt should be stated that the principles of wave work and shore-form\r\ndevelopment just outlined apply almost equally well to lakes,\r\nespecially large ones.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject of shore-line development, mention should\r\nbe made of the fact that bars and beaches are often built part way\r\nor wholly across embayments of the coast with surprising rapidity.\r\nTo illustrate, Sandy Hook, New Jersey, is advancing northward, while\r\nRockaway Beach, New York, is extending westward, the tendency being\r\nto close up the entrance to New York harbor and to make the line of\r\nseashore more nearly regular. Records show that Rockaway Beach actually\r\nadvanced westward more than three miles between the years 1835 and\r\n1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nGLACIERS AND THEIR WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nA glacier may be defined as a mass of flowing ice. The motion may\r\nnot be that of flowage in the usually accepted sense of the term. A\r\ndiscussion of the various theories of glacier motion will not here be\r\nattempted. Glaciers form only in regions of perpetual snow, but they\r\ncommonly move down far below the line of perpetual snow of any given\r\nregion. In the polar regions they may form near sea level, while in the\r\ntropics they form at altitudes of two to three miles, and there only\r\nrarely. In southern Alaska, the lower limit of perpetual snow is about\r\n5,000 feet above sea level, and many of the glaciers come down to sea\r\n(Plate 4), while in the Alps, the lower limit of perpetual snow is at\r\nabout 9,000 feet, and the glaciers descend as much as 5,000 feet below\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn regions of perpetual snow there is a tendency for more or less snow\r\nto accumulate faster than it can be removed by evaporation or melting.\r\nAs such snow accumulates it gradually undergoes a change, especially in\r\nits lower parts, first into granulated snow (so-called \"névé\") and then\r\ninto solid ice. Snow drifts in the northern United States often undergo\r\nsimilar transformation, after a few months first to névé, and then to\r\nice. This transformation seems to be brought about mainly by weight of\r\noverlying snow which compacts the snow crystals; by rain or melting\r\nsnow percolating into the snow to freeze and fill spaces between the\r\nsnow crystals; and by the actual growth of the crystals themselves.\r\nWhen ice of sufficient thickness has accumulated (probably at best\r\nseveral hundred feet), the spreading action or flowage begins and a\r\nglacier has developed. Renewed snowfalls over the gathering ground keep\r\nup the supply of ice.\r\n\r\nThere are several types of glaciers: valley or alpine glaciers; cliff\r\nor hanging glaciers; piedmont glaciers; ice caps; and continental ice\r\nsheets. A valley or alpine glacier consists essentially of a stream\r\nof ice slowly flowing down a valley and fed from a catchment basin of\r\nsnow within a region of perpetual snow. In the Alps, where glaciers of\r\nthis sort are very typically shown, they vary in length up to eight or\r\nnine miles. Perhaps the grandest display of great valley glaciers is in\r\nsouthern Alaska where they attain lengths up to forty or fifty miles\r\nand widths of one or two miles (Plate 4).\r\n\r\nHanging or cliff glaciers are in many ways like valley glaciers, but\r\nthey are generally smaller; they develop in snow-filled basins above\r\nthe snow line usually on steep mountain sides; and they do not reach\r\ndown into well-defined valleys. Most of the glaciers of the Glacier\r\nNational Park in Montana and many of those in the Cascade Mountains are\r\nof this type. Mount Rainier in Washington is one of the most remarkable\r\nsingle large mountain peaks in the world, in regard to development of\r\nglaciers over it. Great tongues of ice, starting mostly at 8,000 to\r\n10,000 feet above sea level, flow down the sides of the mountain for\r\ndistances of to four and even six miles. The total area of ice in this\r\nremarkable system of radiating glaciers on this one mountain is over\r\nforty square miles. These Mount Rainier glaciers are in general best\r\nclassified as intermediate in type between valley and hanging glaciers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Map of Mount Rainier, Washington, showing its\r\nwonderful system of glaciers which covers more than 40 square miles.\r\nDotted portions represent moraines. (U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nIn some high latitude areas, as in Iceland and Spitzbergen, snow and\r\nice may accumulate on relatively level plains or plateaus and slowly\r\nspread or flow radially from their centers. These are called ice caps.\r\nOrdinary ice caps usually do not cover more than some hundreds of\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\nContinental glaciers or ice sheets are, in principle, much like ice\r\ncaps, but they are larger. Greenland is buried under an ice sheet of\r\nmoderate size (about 500,000 square miles), the motion being outward in\r\nall directions toward the sea. Tongues of ice, like valley glaciers,\r\nare commonly sent off from the main body of ice across the land\r\nborder of Greenland into the sea. The size of the great ice sheet of\r\nAntarctica is not definitely known, but it covers probably at least\r\nseveral million square miles. Two continental ice sheets of special\r\ninterest to the geologist are those which existed during the great\r\nIce Age of the Quaternary period. One of these then covered nearly\r\n4,000,000 square miles of North America, while the other covered about\r\n600,000 square miles of northern Europe. The main facts regarding\r\nthe Ice Age are given in a succeeding chapter. The facts brought out\r\nin the present discussion of existing glaciers will greatly aid in\r\nunderstanding the Ice Age.\r\n\r\nHow fast do glaciers flow? Based upon many observations, we may say\r\nthat an average rate of flow for the glaciers of the world is not more\r\nthan a few feet per day. A very exceptional case is a large glacier,\r\nbranching off as a tongue from the ice sheet of Greenland, which is\r\nsaid to move sixty to seventy-five feet per day. Some of the great\r\nAlaskan glaciers have been found to flow from four to forty feet per\r\nday. Most glaciers of the Alps move only one to two feet per day. A\r\nglacier advances only when the rate of motion is greater than the rate\r\nof melting of its lower end and vice versa in the case of retreat. Thus\r\nit is true, though seemingly paradoxical, to assert that a glacier has\r\na constant forward motion even when it is retreating by melting.\r\n\r\nBy watching the changing position of marked objects placed in the ice,\r\nit has been proved that, in a valley glacier, the top moves faster\r\nthan the bottom; the middle moves faster than the sides; the rate of\r\nmotion increases with thickness of ice, slope of floor over which it\r\nmoves, and temperature.\r\n\r\nIce, like molasses candy, tends to crack when subjected to a relatively\r\nsudden force, and where the ice rides over a salient on the bed of\r\nthe glacier, transverse cracks or fissures often develop. Due to more\r\nrapid motion of the central part of a valley glacier, stresses and\r\nstrains are set up and crevasses are formed, usually pointing obliquely\r\nupstream. Where the ice tends to spread laterally in a broad portion\r\nof a valley, longitudinal cracks may develop. Crevasses vary in size\r\nup to several feet in width and hundreds of feet in depth. Owing to\r\nthe forward motion of the ice, old fissures tend to close up and new\r\nones form, and, aided by uneven melting, the surface of a glacier is\r\ngenerally very rough.\r\n\r\nLike running water, ice may have considerable erosive power when it is\r\nproperly supplied with tools. The total erosive effect which has been,\r\nand is now being, accomplished by ice compared with that of running\r\nwater is, however, slight. One of the main processes by which ice\r\nerosion is accomplished is \"corrasion\" due to the rubbing or grinding\r\naction of hard rock fragments frozen into the bottom and sides of the\r\nglacier. Thick ice, shod with hard rock fragments and flowing through a\r\ndeep, narrow valley of soft rock, is especially powerful as an erosive\r\nagent because the abrasive tools are supplied; the work to be done is\r\neasy; and the deep ice causes great pressure on the bottom and lower\r\nsides of the valley. Rock surfaces which have been thus subjected to\r\nice erosion are characteristically smoothed and more or less scratched,\r\nstriated, or ground due to the corrosive effects of small and large\r\nrock fragments. This affords one of the best means of proving the\r\nformer presence of a glacier over a region or in a valley. A typical\r\nV-shaped stream cut (eroded) valley is changed into one with a U-shaped\r\nprofile or cross section by glacier erosion (Plate 5).\r\n\r\nAnother important process of ice erosion is \"plucking,\" which consists\r\nin pushing among already more or less loosened joint blocks by the\r\npressure of the moving ice. The pressure thus exerted, especially by\r\na deep valley glacier, may be enormous. This process was an important\r\nfactor in the development of the famous Yosemite Valley, a very brief\r\naccount of whose history it will now be instructive to give.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 3.--The Gorge of Niagara River Below the Great\r\nFalls. The strata (containing fossils) were accumulated on the bottom\r\nof the Silurian sea which overspread the region at least 18,000,000\r\nyears ago. Since the Ice Age or within 20,000 to 40,000 years, the\r\nriver has carved out the gorge.

Due to its low velocity the stream cuts its channel\r\ndown very little, but it swings or \"meanders\" slowly from one side of\r\nits valley to the other, developing a wide flood plain. The stream once\r\nflowed against the valley wall shown at the middle left. (_Photo by the\r\nauthor._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 4.--(_b_) Davidson Glacier, Alaska. This glacier\r\nis at work slowly grinding down the valley floor and cutting back its\r\nwalls, thus changing the original stream-cut, V-shaped profile, like\r\nthat of Plate 5. (_Photo by Wright, U. S. Geological Survey._)]\r\n\r\nThe Yosemite Valley, about 7 miles long, less than one mile wide,\r\nand from 2,000 to 4,000 feet deep, lies on the western slope of the\r\nSierra Nevada Mountains of California. Great cliffs of granite,\r\nmostly from 1,000 to over 3,000 feet high, bound the valley on either\r\nside. The floor of the valley is wide and remarkably flat (Plate 6).\r\nJust prior to the Ice Age, by the processes of erosion already set\r\nforth, the Merced River had carved out a great steep-sided V-shaped\r\ncanyon commonly from 1,000 to 3,000 feet deep. During the Ice Age,\r\ntwo glaciers joined to form an extra deep powerful glacier, which\r\nflowed through a deep part of the Merced Canyon and modified it into\r\nthe Yosemite Valley, essentially as we see it to-day. Because the ice\r\nwas shod with many fragments of hard rock (granite), and the pressure\r\nat the bottom and lower sides of the glacier (several thousand feet\r\nthick) was so great, the V-shaped stream-cut canyon was changed to a\r\nU-shaped canyon with very steep to even vertical walls. A factor of\r\ngreat importance which notably aided the erosive power of the glacier\r\nin this case was the existence of an unusual number of large vertical\r\njoint cracks in the granite in this local region. The plucking action\r\nof the ice was thus very greatly facilitated and great slabs of rock,\r\nseparated by the vertical joints, especially toward the lower sides\r\nand bottom of the valley, were pushed away one after another by the\r\nice. When the ice disappeared, great precipitous joint faces from 1,000\r\nto 3,000 feet high were left along the valley sides. At its lower\r\nend the glacier left a dam of glacial débris (moraine) across the\r\nvalley, thus causing a lake to form over the valley floor. The wide\r\nflat bottom of the valley was caused by filling up of the lake with\r\nsediment. The uniqueness of the Yosemite Valley is, then, due to a\r\nremarkable combination of several main factors; one, the presence of\r\na large swift river well supplied with tools which carved out a deep\r\nV-shaped canyon; two, a mighty glacier which plowed its way through\r\nthis canyon and converted it by erosion into a U-shaped canyon;\r\nthree, the weakening of the rock by many joint cracks, thus greatly\r\nfacilitating the ice erosion; and four, a postglacial lake covering\r\nthe valley floor which became filled with sediment. As a result of the\r\nice work, several streams, tributary to the main stream (Merced River)\r\nwhich flows through the bottom of the valley, were forced to plunge\r\nover great vertical rock walls (joint faces), thus producing high and\r\nbeautiful true waterfalls, including the very high Upper Yosemite Fall\r\nwhere Yosemite Creek makes a straight drop of 1,430 feet. A tributary\r\nvalley like that of Yosemite Creek, which ends abruptly well above\r\nthe main valley, is known as a \"hanging\" valley. The valley of Bridal\r\nVeil Creek is another good example. (See Plate 6.) Valleys which were\r\nonce occupied by active glaciers are generally characterized by their\r\nU-shaped cross sections and their hanging (tributary) valleys, but\r\nthe great height and steepness of the valley walls in Yosemite are\r\nexceptional.\r\n\r\nA type of glacial erosion which is of special interest is the\r\nsculpturing of so-called \"cirques\" or \"amphitheaters\" in mountains\r\nwithin the region of perpetual snow. Where the main mass of snow and\r\nice in the catchment basin or gathering ground of a valley glacier\r\npulls away from the snow and névé on the upper slopes, the rock wall\r\nis more or less exposed in the deep crevasse. During warm days water\r\nfills the joint cracks in the rocks down in this crevasse (so-called\r\n\"Bergschrund\"), and during cold nights the water freezes and forces\r\nthe blocks of rock apart. This is greatest toward the bottom of the\r\ncrevasse and so, by this excavating or quarrying process, vertical or\r\nvery steep walls are developed around a great bowlike basin or cirque.\r\nSuch cirques, now free from glacial ice, with precipitous walls 500 to\r\n2,000 feet high and one-fourth of a mile to one-half of a mile across,\r\nare common in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Ranges and in the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of the materials eroded by the ice? An answer to this\r\nquestion involves at least a brief discussion of the deposition of\r\nglacial débris, this constituting an important feature of the work\r\nof ice. The débris transported by a glacier is carried either on\r\nits surface or within it, or pushed along under it. It is generally\r\nheterogeneous material ranging from the finest clay through sand and\r\ngravel, to bowlders of many tons' weight. Various types of glacial\r\ndeposits are abundantly illustrated by débris left strewn over much\r\nof the northeastern United States and some reference to these will be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nMost valley glaciers carry considerable débris on their surfaces, this\r\nrepresenting material which falls or is carried down from the valley\r\nwalls upon the margins of the ice, thus forming marginal moraines.\r\nWhen two glaciers flow together, one marginal moraine from each will\r\ncoalesce to form a medial moraine. The material carried along at the\r\nbottom of a glacier is called the ground moraine. Where it contains\r\nmuch very fine grained material with pebbles or bowlders scattered\r\nthrough its mass, it is called \"till\" or \"bowlder clay.\" The pebbles or\r\nbowlders of the ground moraine are commonly facetted and striated as a\r\nresult of having been rubbed against the bedrock on which the glacier\r\nmoved. Ground moraine material is the most extensively developed of\r\nall glacial deposits. It is so widely scattered over the glaciated\r\nnortheastern portion of the United States that most of the soils\r\nconsist of it, having been left strewn over the country during the\r\nmelting of the vast ice sheet.\r\n\r\nWhen a glacier remains practically stationary for some time, more or\r\nless material which it carries is piled up at its lower end to form\r\na terminal moraine. Repeated pauses during general glacier retreat\r\npermit the accumulations of so-called recessional moraines. A wonderful\r\ndisplay of recessional moraines occurs from the Great Lakes south,\r\nwhere they are festooned one within another and remain almost exactly\r\nas they were formed during pauses in retreat of great lobes of ice\r\nduring the closing stages of the Ice Age. A great terminal moraine\r\nmarks the southernmost limit of the ice sheet during the Ice Age,\r\na very fine illustration being the ridge of low irregular hills\r\nextending the whole length of Long Island. Some of the material in that\r\nmorainic ridge was transported by the ice from northern New England.\r\n\r\nConsiderable rock débris is transported within the ice, and such\r\n\"englacial\" material in part results from rock débris which falls\r\non the surface in the catchment basin and becomes buried under new\r\nsnowfalls which change to ice, and in part from material which falls\r\ninto the crevasses in the glacier farther down the valley. Marked\r\nobjects thrown into the catchment basin have, after many years, emerged\r\nat or near the end of the glacier; thus the rate of motion can be very\r\naccurately told. A very remarkable case of transportation through the\r\nbody of a glacier is the following: In 1820, three men were buried\r\nunder an avalanche in the catchment basin of the Bossons Glacier in\r\nthe Alps. Forty-one years later several parts of the bodies, including\r\nthe three heads together with some pieces of clothing, emerged at the\r\nfoot of the glacier after traveling most of its length at the rate of\r\neight inches per day. The heads were so perfectly preserved after their\r\nremarkable journey in cold storage that they were clearly recognized by\r\nformer friends!\r\n\r\nWhere a valley floor slopes downward away from the end of a glacier,\r\nwaters emerging from the ice, heavily loaded with rock débris, cause\r\nmore or less deposition of the débris on the valley floor often for\r\nmiles beyond the ice front. Such a deposit is called a \"valley train.\"\r\nWhen the ice front pauses for a considerable time upon a rather flat\r\nsurface, the débris-laden waters emerging from the ice develop an\r\n\"outwash plain\" by deposition of sediment rather uniformly over the\r\nflat surface. A very fine example is the plain which constitutes most\r\nof the southern half of Long Island just beyond the southern limit of\r\nthe great terminal moraine ridge.\r\n\r\nA type of glacial deposit of particular interest is the \"drumlin\"\r\nwhich is, in reality, only a special form of ground moraine material\r\n(commonly till), and, therefore, essentially unstratified. Typical\r\ndrumlins are low, rounded mounds of till with roughly elliptical bases\r\nand steeper fronts facing the direction from which the ice flowed.\r\nTheir long axes are always parallel to the direction of ice movement.\r\nIn height they commonly range from 50 to 200 feet. Their mode of origin\r\nis not yet definitely known, but they form near the margins of broad\r\nlobes of ice either by erosion of earlier glacial deposits, or by\r\naccumulation beneath the ice under peculiarly favorable conditions,\r\nas perhaps in the longitudinal crevasses. One of the finest and most\r\nextensive exhibitions of drumlins in the world is in western New York\r\nbetween Syracuse and Rochester. Thousands of drumlins there rise above\r\nthe general level of the Ontario plain, the New York Central Railroad\r\npassing through the very midst of them. Drumlins are also abundant in\r\neastern Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nAnother type of glacial deposit in the form of low hills is the \"kame\"\r\nwhich, unlike the drumlin, always consists of more or less stratified\r\nmaterial. Kames are seldom over 200 feet high, and they are of various\r\nshapes. In many cases they form irregular groups of hills, and in\r\nother cases fairly well defined kame ridges. Kames form as deposits\r\nfrom débris-laden streams emerging from the margins of glaciers, the\r\nwater sometimes rising as great fountains because of the pressure. Such\r\ndeposits are now actually in process of formation along the edge of\r\nthe great Malaspina Glacier of Alaska. Kames are commonly associated\r\nwith terminal and recessional moraines. \"Eskers\" are similar except\r\nthat they are long winding low ridges of stratified material deposited\r\nby débris-laden streams, probably in longitudinal fissures in the ice\r\nnear its margin. (See Plate 20.)\r\n\r\nGlacial bowlders, or \"erratics\" are blocks of rock or bowlders left\r\nstrewn over the country during the melting of the ice. They vary in\r\nsize from small pebbles to those of many tons of weight, and most of\r\nthem were derived from ledges of relatively hard, resistant rocks. (See\r\nPlate 20.) Erratics have very commonly been carried a few miles from\r\ntheir parent ledges, while more rarely they have traveled even hundreds\r\nof miles. They are extremely abundant in New York and New England,\r\nmany occurring even high up on the mountains. In some cases erratics\r\nof ten or more tons' weight have been left in such remarkably balanced\r\npositions on bedrock that a child can cause one of them to swing back\r\nand forth slightly. Such a bowlder is literally a \"rocking stone.\"\r\nIn the Adirondack Mountains the writer recently observed a rounded\r\nerratic of very hard rock fourteen feet in diameter resting in a very\r\nremarkably balanced position on top of another large round glacial\r\nbowlder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE ACTION OF WIND\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly during the last quarter of a century have geologists come to\r\nproperly appreciate the really important geological work of the wind.\r\nOne reason for this is the fact that people live mostly in humid\r\nregions where the soils are largely effectually protected against\r\nwind action by the vegetation. But even in such regions, wind action\r\nis by no means negligible. One has but to observe the great clouds of\r\ndust raised by strong wind from freshly cultivated fields during a\r\nlittle dry weather in the late spring. Much of this dust is carried\r\nconsiderable distances, often miles, and in some cases young crops\r\nare injured by removal of soil from around the roots, while in other\r\ncases young plants are buried by deposition of the wind-blown material\r\nover them. In humid regions, the action of the wind is perhaps most\r\nstrikingly exhibited along and near shores of sea and lakes, where\r\nloose dry sands are picked up and transported in great quantities,\r\noften depositing them as sand dunes, which may form groups of hills\r\ncovering considerable areas. Very conspicuous examples are the sand\r\ndunes of Dune Park in northern Indiana, and the dunes along the coast\r\nof New Jersey.\r\n\r\nBut the action of wind is most strikingly effective in desert and\r\nsemiarid regions. The importance of the work of wind is made more\r\nimpressive when we realize that about one-fifth of the land of the\r\nearth is desert.\r\n\r\nIn deserts some of the ordinary agents of weathering and erosion\r\nare either absent or notably reduced in effectiveness. Thus, stream\r\naction is, in general, reduced to a minimum; weathering effects due\r\nto moisture in the air are notably reduced, and either frost action,\r\nor wedge work of ice, is relatively unimportant due to lack of water.\r\nChange of temperature between night and day is, however, unusually\r\nimportant as a process whereby rocks are broken up due to relatively\r\nrapid expansion and contraction in deserts because such temperature\r\nchanges are exceptionally great, and rocks and soils are almost\r\neverywhere directly exposed, being free from vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe finer grained materials, especially sand grains, in deserts\r\nare picked up by the wind and driven, often with great velocity,\r\nagainst barren rock ledges and large and small rock fragments. By\r\nthis process (corrasion) the rocks are worn and often polished by the\r\nmaterials blown against them. The principle is that of the artificial\r\nsand-blast, used in etching glass, or cleaning and polishing building\r\nand decorative stones. Under favorable conditions wind-driven sand\r\naccomplishes noticeable erosion in a surprisingly short time. Thus, in\r\na hard wind storm, a plate glass window in a lighthouse on Cape Cod was\r\nworn to opaqueness, while in a few weeks or months the directly exposed\r\nwindow glass may there be worn through.\r\n\r\nThe great erosive effect of wind-driven sand is relatively close to\r\nthe ground because the larger and heavier fragments are not lifted to\r\nvery considerable heights. For this reason ordinary telegraph poles\r\nare difficult to maintain in desert regions because, unless they are\r\nspecially protected, they are soon cut down by sand swept against\r\ntheir bases. In the desert regions of our Southwestern States cliffs\r\nrising above the general level of the country are often undercut by\r\nwind erosion, sometimes with the development of large caverns. (See\r\nPlate 1.) Even the high portions of great ledges are there more or less\r\nfantastically sculptured by wind erosion, the softer portions being\r\nmore deeply cut into than the harder. The famous sphinx of Egypt has\r\nbeen notably roughened by action of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe enormous power of high winds to transport rock material in desert\r\nregions is strikingly illustrated by the great sand storms of the\r\nSahara Desert, where sand and dust, forming clouds with cubic miles of\r\nvolume, sweep for many miles across the country. Some one has estimated\r\nthat every cubic mile of air in such a storm contains more than\r\n100,000 tons of rock material. It is said that an army of 50,000 men\r\nunder Cambyses was buried under the sands of a storm in the desert of\r\nnorthern Africa.\r\n\r\nDust from some of these storms is known to be driven hundreds of miles\r\nout over the Atlantic Ocean, there to settle in the sea. In mountainous\r\ndesert regions, like the Great Basin of our Western States, the general\r\ntendency is for the rock materials wind-eroded from the mountains to\r\nbe carried into the intermontane basins or valleys. Some basins of\r\nthis sort are believed to contain depths of 1,000 to 2,000 feet of\r\nwind-blown material.\r\n\r\nA special kind of wind-blown material called \"loess,\" is a sort\r\nof fine-grained yellow, or brown loam which, though relatively\r\nunconsolidated, has a remarkable property of standing out as high\r\nsteep cliffs or bluffs along the banks of streams. Many thousands of\r\nsquare miles of northern China are covered with loess. Among many other\r\nregions, thousands of square miles of parts of the States of Iowa,\r\nNebraska, and Kansas are covered with loess, which, in this case, is\r\nbelieved to be fine material gathered by winds from the region just\r\nafter the retreat of one of the ice sheets of the great Ice Age, when\r\nthere was very little vegetation to hold down the loose soils of\r\nglacial origin.\r\n\r\nMuch as snowdrifts are formed, so, in many places, the wind-driven\r\nsands are built up into sand hills or so-called \"dunes.\" Dunes are very\r\ncommon in many places, as for example, along our middle Atlantic coast;\r\nin Dune Park of northern Indiana; and in the great arid and semiarid\r\nregions of the Western States. Where there is a distinctly prevailing\r\ndirection of wind, the sand is blown to the leeward side from the\r\nwindward side, and the dunes are caused to migrate in the direction of\r\nthe wind. The burial and destruction of forests, and the uncovering of\r\nthe dead trees is not uncommonly caused by migration of sand dunes, all\r\nstages of this phenomenon being well exhibited in Dune Park, Indiana.\r\nThe rate of dune migration is very variable, but study in a number of\r\nplaces has shown a rate of from a few feet to more than 100 feet per\r\nyear. Arable lands, buildings, and even towns have been encroached upon\r\nand buried under drifting sand. An interesting example is a church in\r\nthe village of Kunzen, on the Baltic seashore which, in a period of\r\nsixty years, became completely buried under a dune and then completely\r\nuncovered by migration of the dune. Much destruction has been wrought\r\nby shifting sands on the Bay of Biscay, where farms and even villages\r\nhave been overwhelmed. The ruins of the ancient cities of Babylon and\r\nNineveh are buried mostly under wind-blown sand and dust. There is\r\ngood reason to believe that the climate of central and western Asia is\r\nnow notably drier than it was a few thousand years ago, and this may\r\nhelp to explain the burial of many old cities and villages there under\r\nwind-blown deposits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nINSTABILITY OF THE EARTH'S CRUST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crust of the earth is unstable. To the modern student of\r\ngeology the old notion of a \"terra firma\" is outworn. The idea of\r\nan unshakable, immovable earth could never have emanated from the\r\ninhabitants of an earthquake country. In general we may recognize\r\ntwo types of crustal movements--slow and sudden. To most people the\r\nsudden movements accompanied by earthquakes are more significant and\r\nimpressive because they are more localized and evident, and often\r\naccompanied by destruction of property, or quick, though minor, changes\r\nin the landscape. But movements which take place slowly and quietly are\r\noften of far greater significance in the interpretation of the profound\r\nphysical changes which have affected the earth during its millions of\r\nyears of known history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Structure section across the Hudson River\r\nValley near West Point, New York. The shafts and tunnel, 1,200 feet\r\nbelow sea level, in solid rock, show the position of the New York City\r\naqueduct from the Catskills. The Preglacial valley has been submerged\r\nand filled with Postglacial sediment to a depth of nearly 800 feet.\r\n(Redrawn by the author after Berkey, from New York State Museum\r\nBulletin.)]\r\n\r\nA few well-known examples will serve to prove that upward, downward,\r\nand differential movements of the earth's crust have actually taken\r\nplace not only in the remote ages of geologic time, but also that\r\nsuch movements have geologically recently taken place, and that\r\nsimilar movements are still going on. It is very important that the\r\nreader thoroughly appreciate the fact that crustal disturbances,\r\noften profound ones, do take place, because this is one of the most\r\nfundamental tenets of geologic science. Let us consider the case of the\r\nHudson-Champlain-St. Lawrence Valley region. That the whole region was\r\nonce notably higher (at least 1,000 feet) than at present is proved by\r\nthe drowned character of the Hudson Valley, in which tidewater extends\r\nnorthward for 150 miles to near Troy. Where the New York City Aqueduct\r\npasses under the Hudson River near Newburgh, the bedrock bottom of the\r\nold river channel is now about 800 feet below sea level as determined\r\nby drilling. This old channel is there filled up nearly to sea level\r\nwith glacial and postglacial rock débris, which shows that the old\r\nchannel must have been cut before the oncoming of the ice of the great\r\nIce Age. Before the Ice Age, then, the lower Hudson Valley must have\r\nbeen considerably more than 800 feet higher than at present, because it\r\nthen contained a river with sufficient current to be an active agent\r\nof erosion, carving out the canyonlike valley in the vicinity of West\r\nPoint. This conclusion is strongly reenforced by the fact that the old\r\nvalley of the Hudson River has been definitely traced as a distinct\r\ntrench across the shallow sea bottom for about 100 miles eastward from\r\nthe entrance to New York harbor. Toward the eastern end of this trench\r\nthe depth of water is now considerably over 1,000 feet, and thus it is\r\nobvious that, preceding the Ice Age, the earth's crust in the vicinity\r\nof New York City must have been much higher than at present, so that\r\nthe Hudson River was able to erode its now completely drowned channel.\r\nSomewhat similar evidence has also established the fact that the lower\r\nSt. Lawrence Valley region was much higher before the Ice Age. It is\r\nevident, therefore, that the general Hudson-St. Lawrence Valley region\r\nis now notably lower with reference to sea level than it was before the\r\nIce Age. That this was caused by actual sinking of the earth's crust\r\nrather than by a rise of sea level is proved by the fact that similar\r\nchanges of level between land and sea did not take place at the same\r\ntime even along the Atlantic and Gulf coast of our Southern States.\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed to the next step in the geologically recent\r\nhistory of earth-crust movements in the Hudson-Champlain-St. Lawrence\r\nValley region by asserting that, since the Ice Age, the land was\r\nactually notably lower than at present. In fact, the land was enough\r\nlower to allow tidewater to extend up the St. Lawrence Valley into\r\nthe Ontario basin, and all through the Champlain-Hudson Valley. Many\r\nbeaches, bars, and delta deposits formed in these arms of the sea are\r\nstill plainly preserved, in some cases with shells and bones of marine\r\nanimals in them, now hundreds of feet above sea level. These marine\r\ndeposits are highest above sea level in the northern portion of the\r\nChamplain Valley, where they lie at an altitude of 700 feet or more and\r\ntheir altitude steadily diminishes southward to about 300 to 400 feet\r\nin the general vicinity of Albany, and to near sea level in the general\r\nvicinity of New York City. Obviously, then, the land stood lower during\r\npart or all of the interval of not more than a few tens of thousands\r\nof years since the Ice Age than at present. This leads us to the third\r\nimportant conclusion regarding earth movements in this region, namely,\r\nthat still later the land has undergone a differential uplift, the rate\r\nhaving steadily increased toward the north where the total uplift is\r\nmany hundreds of feet. We have discussed this region somewhat in detail\r\nbecause the principles of slow up and down movements of the earth's\r\ncrust are there so plainly recorded.\r\n\r\nAmong many other regions where earth movements similar to those above\r\ndescribed have taken place, brief mention may be made of Norway. The\r\ngreat fjords of Norway were, just before the Ice Age, stream-cut\r\nvalleys which were then more or less modified by glacial erosion,\r\nand after the Ice Age the rivers in them were drowned due to land\r\nsubsidence. The kind of evidence is like that above given for the lower\r\nHudson River. Since the subsidence there has been partial reelevation,\r\nas proved by the fact that along the sides of the larger fjords marine\r\nterraces and beaches may be traced with gradually increasing altitude\r\nfor many miles (150 or more) back into the country where they are\r\nhundreds of feet above tidewater.\r\n\r\nScandinavia is of still further special interest because very\r\nappreciable earth movements have there come under human observation.\r\nMarks carefully placed along the shores of Sweden by the government\r\nhave proved that during the last 150 years the southern end of the\r\ncountry has actually subsided several feet, while from Stockholm north\r\nthe land has risen in increasing amount, reaching a maximum of seven or\r\neight feet. In southern Sweden, at Malmo, a certain street now at times\r\nbecomes covered by wind-driven high water, and during excavations made\r\nsome years ago an older street eight feet below the present one was\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nA theory which appears to be in perfect harmony with the facts to\r\naccount for the subsidence and partial reelevation of central eastern\r\nNorth America and Scandinavia since the beginning of the Ice Age is\r\nthat the great weight of ice during the Ice Age pressed the land down,\r\nand that since the removal of the ice there has been an appreciable\r\ntendency for the land to spring back.\r\n\r\nCertain crustal movements which have occurred about the Bay of Naples\r\nare of very special interest because actual human history dates can be\r\nplaced upon them. Most remarkable are the records in connection with\r\nthe temple of Jupiter Serapis which was built near the shore before\r\nthe Christian era. The land sank about five feet and a new pavement\r\nhad to be constructed; then, by the middle of the third century A. D.,\r\nthe temple rose to well above sea level. By about the ninth century\r\nthe land had subsided fully thirty feet, so that marble columns of\r\nthe temple were bored full of holes as high as twenty-one feet above\r\ntheir bases by marine-shelled animals, species of which still live in\r\nthe bay. Then a slow uplift of twenty-three feet began, bringing the\r\nbases of the columns two feet above sea level by 1749. Since that time\r\na slight sinking has taken place and this seems to be still going on.\r\nThree of the marble columns with the borings still stand in upright\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nWhile the movements just described were taking place, the island of\r\nCapri, twenty miles across the Bay of Naples, has slowly sunk to an\r\namount estimated at thirty or forty feet as proved by evidence from the\r\nfamous Blue Grotto. About the beginning of the Christian era a large\r\nancient wave-cut cave, part of which is now called the Blue Grotto, had\r\nits floor above sea level, and it was used by certain Romans as a cool\r\nplace to retire to from the heat. In order to obtain better light an\r\nopening was cut through its upper portion. The land has sunk so much\r\nthat at the present time even part of the artificial opening (through\r\nwhich tourists pass) is now under water.\r\n\r\nBy way of illustrating remarkable contrasts in direction of crustal\r\nmovements on very considerable scales in a given region, we shall\r\nbriefly mention some facts regarding part of the coast of southern\r\nCalifornia and the neighboring islands of Santa Catalina and San\r\nClemente, respectively twenty-five and fifty miles offshore. Those\r\nmovements were not, however, checked up by human history records.\r\nThe mainland at San Pedro has clearly risen 1,240 feet, as proved by\r\nthe presence of unusually perfect coast terraces (so-called \"raised\r\nbeaches\"), while San Clemente has risen 1,500 feet as proved by the\r\nraised beaches into which deep, youthful V-shaped stream-cut valleys\r\nhave been sunk, and a shore line characteristic of recent notable\r\nuplift. It is a remarkable fact that at the same time the intervening\r\nisland (Santa Catalina) has notably sunk, as proved by the nature\r\nof its shore line, and the distinctly more mature character of its\r\ntopography.\r\n\r\nWe are, however, by no means dependent upon lands along sea shores\r\nfor evidences of slow rising and sinking of land. Thus, by careful\r\nmeasurements it has been shown that the general region of the Great\r\nLakes is now differentially rising toward the northeast at the rate\r\nof about five inches per 100 miles per century. At Chicago the rise\r\nof water is estimated at about nine inches per century, which means\r\nincrease of flowage through the Chicago Canal. At this rate the upper\r\nlakes would, in some thousands of years, drain through this canal to\r\nthe Mississippi. A well-preserved shore line of the large ancestor\r\nof Lake Ontario shows a steady increase in altitude at the rate of\r\nseveral feet per mile toward the northeast from near Niagara to the St.\r\nLawrence Valley, thus proving a tilting of the land since the shore\r\nline was formed.\r\n\r\nShore lines of the great ancestor of Great Salt Lake also show warping\r\nof the earth's crust, some parts of a definite shore line being several\r\nhundred feet higher than others.\r\n\r\nVery significant evidence pointing to profound crustal movements\r\nconsist in the finding of fossil remains of marine animals in the\r\nstrata high above sea level, very commonly from one to three miles, in\r\nmany parts of the world, especially in the high mountains. In Wyoming,\r\nnearly horizontal strata of the Mesozoic Age carrying marine fossils\r\nlie two miles or more above sea level. The fact that given formations,\r\ncarrying marine fossils representing certain definite portions of\r\ngeologic time, are found at various altitudes up to several miles in\r\nmany parts of the world, shows that the land in those places has\r\nreally risen relative to sea level.\r\n\r\nIt should not be presumed from the above discussion that the sea level\r\nitself has never changed. Thus, the vast areas of thick ice sheets in\r\nboth North America and Europe during the Great Ice Age represented\r\nsufficient water withdrawn from the sea to very appreciably lower its\r\nlevel. All land-derived materials, carried into the sea mainly by\r\nrivers, displace sea water, with consequent rise of its level. If all\r\nexisting lands were worn down and carried into the sea, its level would\r\nbe raised some hundreds of feet. Subsidence of any part of the ocean\r\nbottom would cause a lowering of sea level. There is a strong reason\r\nto believe that some such shiftings of sea level have occurred during\r\nthe vast lapse of geologic time. During certain periods erosion of the\r\nland predominated, and during other periods building up of the land\r\npredominated, as pointed out in the chapters on geologic history. It is\r\nnot thought that shifting of sea level has ever amounted to more than a\r\nfew hundred feet, at least not during the millions of years of the more\r\nclearly recorded earth history.\r\n\r\nWe have thus far considered slow upward and downward movements of the\r\nearth's crust without notable structural changes in the rocks. Another\r\ntype of crustal disturbance causes more or less profound changes in\r\nthe structures of the rocks themselves. Just how the earth originated\r\nis a matter of uncertainty, but we can be sure that for many millions\r\nof years it has been a shrinking body. The outer, or crustal, portion\r\nof the earth, in adjusting itself to the contracting interior, has had\r\nmany pressures, stresses, and strains set up within it. As results of\r\nsuch forces the rocks at and near the earth's surface have in various\r\nplaces, and at various times, been broken (faulted) and subjected to\r\nsudden movements (see discussion beyond), while those well within the\r\ncrustal portion, that is to say a few miles or more down, have, in\r\nmany cases, been bent (folded), or even crumpled. For these reasons\r\nthe surface and near-surface crustal portions are called the \"zone of\r\nfracture,\" while the more deeply buried portions comprise the \"zone\r\nof flowage.\" In the zone of flowage the rocks, where subjected to\r\ngreat lateral pressure, act like plastic materials and therefore bend\r\nrather than break, because of the great weight of overlying materials.\r\nLaboratory experiments have confirmed the findings of geologists in\r\nthis regard. Small masses of rocks properly inclosed in nickel-steel\r\ncylinders have been subjected to slow differential pressures equivalent\r\nto those which obtain twenty to forty miles within the earth. Under\r\nsuch conditions rocks have been made to change shape very notably\r\nwithout fracturing. Both geological observations and experiments have\r\nled us to conclude that not even small fractures or crevices can remain\r\nopen at a depth greater than ten or twelve miles even in the hardest\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, during the long history of the earth, forces of\r\nlateral pressure have been slowly exerted along more or less localized\r\nzones or belts within the earth's crust, and the rocks have been\r\ndeformed chiefly by bending or folding, especially in those regions\r\nwhere mountains of the folded type have developed. Movements of this\r\ntype are considered beyond in the chapter on mountains. Rock folds vary\r\nin size from microscopic to miles across, and they exhibit many shapes.\r\nPlate 7 will give the reader a good idea of actual rock folds of\r\ncommon sizes and shapes in various places. Folded structures are most\r\nclearly discernible in sedimentary rocks, because of their stratified\r\n(layered) arrangement. Since folds in hard rocks rarely, if ever,\r\ndevelop except at a depth of some miles within the earth, they show at\r\nthe surface only where great thicknesses of overlying materials have\r\nbeen stripped off by erosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--An outcrop of stratified crystalline limestone\r\n(or marble) exhibiting two small sharp folds--a syncline on the\r\nleft and an anticline on the right--near Lenox, Mass, These folds\r\ndeveloped during the great mountain-making disturbance at the end of\r\nthe Ordovician period fully 20,000,000 years ago. (After Dale, U. S.\r\nGeological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of our consideration of slow earth-crust movements,\r\nit is important to bear in mind that lateral pressure in the zone of\r\nflowage has not only notably deformed rocks, but that, as a result\r\nof the buckling forces, given rock masses have, in many cases, been\r\nnotably shifted downward or upward--mainly upward--from their original\r\npositions. Folded strata carrying shells of sea animals are commonly\r\nfound thousands of feet above sea level in many of the great mountain\r\nranges of the world. During the process of folding on a large scale the\r\ncrust of the earth is very appreciably shortened at right angles to\r\nthe direction of applied pressure, due to squeezing or bending of the\r\nstrata. In the case of the Appalachian mountains of Pennsylvania it has\r\nbeen estimated that such shortening amounts to about twenty-six miles\r\nor, in other words, that the strata originally spread out horizontally\r\nacross an area whose width was about 100 miles have been squeezed or\r\nfolded into an area whose width is twenty-six miles less.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Structure section showing the profile of the\r\nmountains and relations of rocks below the surface near Livingston,\r\nMontana. The strata were crowded together until they bent into great\r\nsharply defined folds at the time of the Rocky Mountain Revolution\r\nseveral million years ago. Then the rocks broke along the fault\r\nfracture and the mass on the right was shoved over upon the mass on the\r\nleft. (After U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nWe shall now turn to a consideration of sudden earth movements and some\r\nof their effects, including earthquakes. Mention has already been made\r\nof the fact that, when pressures and strains are set up in the outer\r\nportion (\"zone of fracture\") of the earth's crust, the rocks yield\r\nmainly by breaking or fracturing because the rocks not being under a\r\ngreat load of overlying material are there brittle. The earth's crust\r\nhas been fractured on small and large scales in many places during\r\nthe long space of geologic time. Where one block of earth's crust\r\nhas slipped or moved past another along a fracture we have what is\r\ncalled a \"fault.\" Such displacements of rock masses vary in amount\r\nfrom less than an inch to some miles, and they constitute one of the\r\nmost important features of the architecture of the outer portion of\r\nthe earth. There are two types of faults fundamentally different as\r\nto cause. In one type (so-called \"normal fault\") the rocks suddenly\r\nyield to a force of tension; a fracture develops and the earth block on\r\none side of the fracture or fault drops with reference to that on the\r\nother. In the other type (so-called \"thrust faults\") the rocks yield\r\nsuddenly to a force of compression or lateral thrust, and one block\r\nof earth is pushed or thrust partly over another along the surface of\r\nfracture or fault. (See Plate 8.)\r\n\r\nFaults range in length up to hundreds of miles, those from one to\r\ntwenty miles in length being very common. Where an earth block has been\r\ndisplaced thousands of feet along a fault surface, it is not to be\r\nunderstood that the whole displacement resulted from a single movement,\r\nbut rather from a series of sudden movements separated by greater or\r\nless intervals of time. Each sudden movement along a fault surface\r\nproduces a vibration of the earth near by. Many such sudden movements\r\nare known to have caused violent earthquakes. Displacements of twenty\r\nto fifty feet, as a result of single movements, are definitely known\r\nto have taken place in various regions during the last fifty years;\r\nand rarely, if ever, has any sudden displacement of as much as several\r\nhundred feet occurred. Cliffs and steep slopes very commonly result\r\nfrom faulting, but, because of the long lapse of time required for the\r\nrepeated movements in the case of great faults, the cliffs or steep\r\nslopes begin to wear back and become more or less subdued long before\r\nthe last of the movements take place. In regions where movements along\r\ngreat faults have long since ceased, the original steep slopes may be\r\ncompletely obliterated by erosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Vertical sections through strata illustrating\r\ncommon kinds of faults: a, \"normal faults\" where one mass simply sinks\r\nbelow another; b, a \"thrust fault\" where one mass is shoved over\r\nanother. (After U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nHow does the geologist determine the actual amount of displacement,\r\nespecially in the case of a large fault in stratified rocks? First, the\r\nvarious formations of the region, where unaffected by faulting, are\r\ncarefully studied, especially in regard to the character and thickness\r\nof each, and their relative geologic ages or normal order as they\r\nwere deposited one layer above the other. Then, in the simple case of\r\na normal-fault surface at right angles to horizontal strata, it is\r\nonly necessary to find out what two formations or parts of formations\r\ncome together along the fault fracture, and the actual amount of\r\ndisplacement is readily determined. Where strata and normal fault\r\nsurfaces lie at various angles, and also in thrust faults, those angles\r\nmust be determined in addition to the data above named. In many mining\r\nregions, where valuable deposits are affected by faulting, accurate\r\nknowledge of the direction and amount of displacements of faults is of\r\ngreat economic importance.\r\n\r\nA few examples of normal faults from well-known districts will now be\r\nbriefly described. The whole eastern front of the central and southern\r\nSierra Nevada Range of California is a great, steep fault slope, from\r\na few thousand to ten thousand or more feet high and hundreds of miles\r\nlong, of such recent geologic age that it has been only moderately\r\naffected by erosion. In fact, it is well known that the southern\r\ntwo-thirds of the range is a great tilted fault block, the total\r\ndisplacement having resulted from repeated sudden movements since about\r\nthe middle of the present geologic era. A great fault also extends\r\nalong the eastern base of the great Wasatch Range of Utah and the steep\r\nslope thousands of feet high is a fault scarp only slightly modified\r\nby erosion. Renewed movements along this profound fault have very\r\nrecently taken place as proved by the presence of fresh fault scarps\r\nin loose deposits which have accumulated across the mouths of some of\r\nthe canyons, as, for example, near Ogden. In fact, practically all of\r\nthe north-south ranges of the Great Basin from Utah to California are\r\nessentially a series of tilted fault blocks. Another great fault, less\r\nconspicuous from the topographic standpoint, is hundreds of miles long\r\nin the Coast Range Mountains of California. At the time of the San\r\nFrancisco earthquake of 1906 there was a renewed sudden movement along\r\nthis great fracture. The eastern one-half of the Adirondack Mountains\r\nof New York is literally a mosaic of hundreds of fault blocks. Many\r\nof these faults are from two to thirty miles long and they commonly\r\nshow displacements of from a few hundred to 2,000 or more feet. A\r\nglance at the geological map (in colors) of the vicinity of the great\r\ncopper mines at Bisbee, Arizona, shows most of that region to contain\r\na network of normal faults which separate it into a mosaic of fault\r\nblocks. In each of the examples of faults just given a block of earth\r\nhas sunk relative to the other, or in other words, each is a \"normal\r\nfault.\"\r\n\r\nWe shall now turn to some large scale cases of faults in which great\r\nmasses of earth have been pushed one over another--so-called \"thrust\r\nfaults.\" In the southern Appalachian Range, and especially well\r\nexhibited in the vicinity of Rome, Georgia, one portion of the mountain\r\nmass has literally been shoved over another, at a low angle over a\r\nfault surface many miles long, for fully seven miles westward. Both the\r\ntremendous weight of rock material actually translated and the number\r\nof sudden movements required in the operation stagger the imagination.\r\nIt is safe to say that during the long time of this great operation\r\nviolent earthquakes were not uncommon. In the Rocky Mountains of the\r\nnorthern United States and southern Canada there is the greatest known\r\nthrust fault on the continent. It is hundreds of miles long, and the\r\nactual displacement is commonly at least several miles. In the Glacier\r\nNational Park of Montana it has been established that the front range\r\nportion of the Rockies has actually been pushed at least seven miles,\r\nand possibly as much as twenty miles, eastward over a fault surface,\r\nand out upon the Great Plains. In some cases rocks of the Prepaleozoic\r\nAge have there been pushed upon rocks of the late Mesozoic Age, thus\r\nlocally upsetting the geologic column.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--East-west profile and vertical structure\r\nsections fifty-two miles long in the Mohawk Valley region of New York,\r\nshowing numerous tilted fault blocks which notably influence the\r\ntopography. Vertical scale exaggerated. The rocks are Prepaleozoic and\r\nearly Paleozoic in age. (Modified by the author after Darton, New York\r\nState Museum.)]\r\n\r\nThe Wasatch Range of Utah, in addition to the great normal fault along\r\nits western base, contains a remarkable system of thrust faults. In\r\nthe region now occupied by the Wasatch Mountains a number of parallel\r\n(thrust) faults were developed close together and the broken pieces of\r\nthe earth's crust between them were pushed up, the rocks on one side\r\nof each crack riding up over those on the other side until a great\r\nmountain range was formed where once lay a plain. In the Ogden Canyon\r\none great earth block of Prepaleozoic (Algonkian) Age has been shoved\r\nthousands of feet over late Paleozoic (Carboniferous) rock, which\r\nlatter has in turn been thrust over early Paleozoic (Cambrian) rock.\r\nThis thrust faulting was accomplished before the development of the\r\ngeologically recent normal fault along the western base of the range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Vertical (structure) section through a part\r\nof the earth's crust several miles long in Ogden Canyon, Utah, showing\r\nthe system of great thrust faults. Prepaleozoic (Algonkian) rocks have\r\nbeen pushed far over upon late Paleozoic (Carboniferous) strata, which\r\nlatter have in turn been shoved over early Paleozoic (Cambrian) strata,\r\netc. (After U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nAny sudden movement of part of the crust of the earth, due to a natural\r\ncause, produces a trembling or shaking called an earthquake. Though\r\nearthquakes are generally classed among the most terrifying of all\r\nnatural phenomena, those which have occurred during human historic\r\ntimes have had scarcely any geological or topographical effects of\r\nreal consequence on the face of the earth. Locally, the effects may\r\nbe notable and the destruction of life and property may be great. The\r\nearth may be locally cracked and rent, small fault scarps may develop,\r\nlandslides and avalanches may result from the shaking of the earth,\r\nbuildings may be demolished, and sea waves may be rolled upon the\r\nland. On the other hand, many earthquakes, called \"tremors,\" are too\r\nslight to be noticed by people, though they are recorded by specially\r\nconstructed instruments called \"seismographs.\" We have already stated\r\nthat actual sudden displacements causing earthquakes have amounted to\r\ntwenty or even fifty feet right along fault fractures, but during the\r\nvibrations or quakings, which are often so destructively sent out into\r\nthe neighboring country, the earth's surface rarely actually moves\r\nmore than a small fraction of an inch. Because of the suddenness of\r\nthe movement objects on the surface may be moved inches or even feet.\r\nViolent shocks may last one or two minutes and cause the whole earth\r\nto tremble, though at distant points only seismographs record the\r\nmovement. It is probably true that some part of the earth is shaking\r\nall the time.\r\n\r\nStudies during the last fifty years have made it certain that the main\r\ncause of earthquakes is the sudden slipping of earth blocks past each\r\nother along fault fractures, the sudden slipping furnishing the impulse\r\nwhich sends out the vibrations into the surrounding more or less\r\nelastic crust of the earth. The low rumbling to roaring sound, which\r\nsometimes immediately precedes an earthquake, is probably due to the\r\ngrinding of the rocks together below the surface.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes generally accompany volcanic outbursts of the violent\r\nor explosive type, and in such cases subterranean explosions cause\r\nboth the eruptions and the quakings of the earth. It is well known\r\nthat the principal volcanic districts or belts of the earth are also\r\nthe belts of most frequent earthquakes, but this does not mean that\r\nvolcanic action causes most of the earthquakes. Active volcanoes and\r\nearthquakes are so commonly associated in the same belts because those\r\nbelts no doubt represent portions of the crust which are now most\r\nactively yielding to the forces directly resulting from the shrinkage\r\nof the earth. Within the volcanic belts many earthquakes take place\r\nunaccompanied by any volcanic action, and many others take place\r\nfar from volcanoes. Some earthquakes have been caused by the impact\r\nof great landslides or avalanches, or by the sudden caving in of\r\nunderground openings.\r\n\r\nBrief descriptions of a few typical carefully studied earthquakes\r\nduring recent years will serve to make the main features of earthquakes\r\nstill clearer to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe violent Japanese earthquake of 1891 was caused by the sinking of\r\na block of earth forty miles long from two to thirty feet below that\r\non the other side of a fault fracture. There was also considerable\r\nhorizontal shifting, and cracks developed in the adjacent region. A\r\ndistinct fault scarp, fifteen to twenty feet high, developed, and in\r\nsome cases extended right across cultivated fields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Map of the United States, showing the large\r\nareas over which three of the greatest of our earthquakes were actually\r\nfelt by people. These earthquakes were recorded in many parts of the\r\nworld by delicate instruments: New Madrid, 1811; Charleston, 1886; San\r\nFrancisco, 1906.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Sketch map showing the trace of the great\r\nfault fracture along which a renewed sudden movement of as much as\r\ntwenty feet took place to cause the San Francisco earthquake of 1906.\r\n(After U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco earthquake of 1906 was produced by renewed movement\r\nalong the great fault which extends lengthwise through the Coast Range\r\nMountains for several hundred miles. It is literally correct to say\r\nthat, for 250 miles along this great earth fracture, one part of the\r\nCoast Range instantaneously slipped from two to twenty-two feet past\r\nthe other. More or less of the movement extended at least several\r\nthousand feet down into the earth. In this case both sides slipped and\r\nthe movement was very largely horizontal rather than vertical. The\r\nland on the east side of the fault moved south and that on the west\r\nside moved north, the amount diminishing away from the fault on each\r\nside so that some miles out the actual crustal movement was only a few\r\ninches. When one thinks of the tremendous volumes of earth material\r\ninvolved in this shifting of the earth's crust, is it any wonder\r\nthat such destructive earthquake waves were produced? Many buildings\r\nwere wrecked, several hundred people were killed, the disastrous San\r\nFrancisco fire resulted, water mains were broken, and fences and roads\r\ncrossed by the fault were dislocated as much as fifteen to twenty feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 5.--Swift Current Valley in Glacier National Park,\r\nMontana. This was once a deep V-shaped canyon carved out (eroded)\r\nby stream action. Then a great valley glacier slowly plowed its way\r\nthrough it during the Ice Age and, by ice erosion, the present nearly\r\nstraight U-shaped canyon has resulted. (_Photo by Campbell, U. S.\r\nGeological Survey._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 6.--View in the Yosemite Valley from Near the\r\nWestern Entrance. The great rock called \"El Capitan,\" on the left rises\r\n3,500 feet above the river, and Bridal Veil Falls on the right is 620\r\nfeet high. All the rock is granite, the nearly vertical walls of which\r\nhave resulted from the action of a great glacier which plowed its way\r\nthrough the valley during the Ice Age; the valley walls have been cut\r\nback by the removal of large vertical joint blocks. The flat bottom of\r\nthe valley has resulted from the filling with sediment of a postglacial\r\nlake in the valley. (_Photo by F. N. Kneeland, Northampton, Mass._)]\r\n\r\nDuring the great earthquake on the coast of Alaska in 1899 notable\r\nchanges took place along the shore for some miles, one portion having\r\nsuddenly risen as much as forty-seven feet, while another portion sank\r\nbelow sea level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Map showing the principal earthquake regions\r\nof the world.]\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the earthquake centering near Charleston, S. C., was preceded\r\nby rumbling and roaring noises and the slight quaking increased to\r\nviolent shaking which lasted more than a minute. Eight minutes later\r\na rather violent earthquake shock took place, followed during the\r\nnext ten or twelve hours by less severe shocks. Most buildings in the\r\ncity were wrecked or more or less badly damaged, and some people\r\nwere killed. The shocks were so violent that the quaking was actually\r\nfelt by people over an area of more than 2,000,000 square miles, the\r\ndisturbance having spread at the rate of about 150 miles per minute.\r\nNear Charleston openings and fissures were formed through which sand\r\nand muddy water were ejected, but the cause of the disturbance was most\r\nlikely slipping of the old very hard rocks below the loose deposits of\r\nthe Coastal Plain.\r\n\r\nFrom 1811 to 1813 a series of violent earthquakes developed in the\r\ngeneral vicinity of New Madrid, Missouri. In an area of over 2,000\r\nsquare miles, now called the \"sunk country,\" many portions suddenly\r\nsank giving rise to small fault scarps or cliffs, and various lake\r\nbasins were formed. Development of a fissure caused a local change in\r\nthe course of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, Assam, India, was shaken by an earthquake of unusual\r\nmagnitude, which lasted 2-1/2 minutes. An area of 150,000 square miles\r\nwas disastrously shaken, and the shocks were distinctly felt over\r\nan area of 750,000 square miles. A number of notable fault scarps\r\ndeveloped, the movement on one having been thirty-five feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nVOLCANOES AND IGNEOUS ROCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only because of the great power and terrifying grandeur of violent\r\neruptions, but also because of their destruction of life and property,\r\nvolcanoes stand out in the popular mind as among the most real and\r\nimportant of all geological phenomena. But great volcanic outbursts,\r\nlike violent earthquakes, are in truth only outward, sensible,\r\nrelatively minor manifestations of the tremendous earth-changing forces\r\nbelow the surface. They are far less important as geological agencies\r\nthan the mighty interior forces which cause parts of continents to\r\nbe slowly upraised and the rocks folded, or even than the incessant\r\naction of streams whereby the lands are cut down. Even as an igneous\r\nagency, volcanoes are notably less important than the development and\r\nshifting of molten materials within the earth's crust. Volcanic action\r\nis, however, not only conspicuous, but it is also of real significance\r\nas a means of changing the earth, such action having taken place since\r\nvery early known geologic time. After bringing out the main facts and\r\nprinciples of volcanoes, aided by descriptions of specific eruptions,\r\nwe shall turn to a consideration of igneous activity within the earth's\r\ncrust.\r\n\r\nMount Vesuvius in Italy is perhaps the most famous active volcano in\r\nthe world. Its eruptions have been more or less carefully studied for\r\na longer time than any other. The eruption in the year 79 A. D. was\r\nreally a tremendous explosion causing a large part of the old crater to\r\nbe blown away, and sending immense volumes of rock fragments, mostly\r\nfinely divided (so-called \"ashes\") into the air which completely buried\r\nthe small city of Pompeii. Water from the great clouds of condensing\r\nsteam, mixed with \"ashes,\" formed muddy floods which overwhelmed\r\nHerculaneum. Little or no lava was erupted. Since that time the crater\r\nhas been more or less active and the present cone, 4,000 feet high, has\r\nbeen built up. During the last fifty years the greatest eruptions took\r\nplace in 1872 and 1906, when, streams of molten rock flowed down the\r\nsides of the mountain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Map showing the distribution of active and\r\nrecently active volcanoes of the world.]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest volcanic explosions ever recorded was that of the\r\nisland of Krakatoa, between Sumatra and Java, in 1883. The greater part\r\nof the island was blown away and there was water 1,000 feet deep,\r\nwhere just before the island stood hundreds of feet high. About a cubic\r\nmile of rock material was sent into the air mostly in the form of fine\r\ndust--some of it for seventeen miles--and completely hid the sun,\r\ncausing total darkness during the eruption. Dust fell over an area of\r\nseveral hundred thousand square miles. Several days after the explosion\r\nships more than 1,000 miles away were dust covered. Such enormous\r\nquantities of a light porous lava called \"pumice\" fell and floated\r\nupon the sea that navigation was badly obstructed many miles from the\r\nvolcano. Extremely fine dust gradually spread through the whole earth's\r\natmosphere, causing the extraordinary red sunsets for several months.\r\nThe sound of the explosion was heard for hundreds of miles. Great\r\nsea waves 50 to 100 feet high were stirred up and they swept inland\r\nfor several miles over the low-lying coast lands of neighboring Java\r\nand Sumatra, overwhelming hundreds of villages and drowning tens of\r\nthousands of people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--The great hole left after the top of Mt.\r\nKatmai in southern Alaska was blown off in 1912 by one of the most\r\ntremendous volcanic explosions in the annals of human history.\r\nThe water in the lake is hot. (After Griggs, National Geographic\r\nMagazine.)]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest explosions on record was that of Katmai volcano,\r\nseveral thousand feet high, on the coast of Alaska, in June, 1912.\r\nNot only was the top of the mountain completely blown off, but also a\r\ngreat crater pit, three miles wide across the top and several thousand\r\nfeet deep, was developed in the stump of the former mountain. Volcanic\r\ndust fell to a depth of several feet within twenty-five to fifty miles\r\nof the mountain. Dust accumulated to a depth of nearly a foot in the\r\nvillage of Kodiak, 100 miles east of the mountain, where total darkness\r\nprevailed for more than two days. A lake of very hot water now occupies\r\nthe bottom of the great new crater. The noise of the explosion was\r\nheard for at least 750 miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Diagrammatic vertical or structure section\r\nthrough a portion of the earth illustrating the common modes of\r\noccurrence of igneous rocks. P, deep-seated (plutonic) igneous rock; S,\r\nstrata; D, dikes; M, mass of igneous rock forced between strata bending\r\nthem upward; F, feeding channel of volcano; V, volcano; L, lava sheets.\r\n(By the author.)]\r\n\r\nOne of the most frightful volcanic catastrophes of recent years was the\r\neruption of Mont Pelée, island of Martinique, West Indies, in 1902.\r\nIn this case, also, no lava was poured out, but violent explosions\r\nsent great clouds of very highly heated gases and vapors, mingled with\r\nincandescent dust, thousands of feet into the air. One of these great\r\nclouds rushed down the mountain at hurricane speed and destroyed the\r\ncity of St. Pierre with its 30,000 inhabitants. After the main eruption\r\na spine or core of hard rock began to rise out of the crater and it\r\nslowly grew to a height of 1,000 feet in several months, after which it\r\nbegan to crumble away. This spine probably represented nearly frozen\r\nlava which solidified as it was gradually forced out of the mountain.\r\n\r\nOf special interest to us, though not of great importance is the only\r\nactive volcano in the United States. In May, 1914, Mount Lassen (or\r\nLassen Peak), a long inactive volcano in northern California, suddenly\r\nburst forth explosively and during the next several years hundreds of\r\neruptions occurred. Little or no lava appeared, but great clouds of\r\nsteam and dust often shot into the air from one to three miles above\r\nthe top of the mountain, which lies over 10,000 feet above sea level.\r\n(Plate 10.) Great quantities of dust have accumulated for miles around\r\nthe mountain. At this writing (October, 1920) the mountain is again\r\nactive.\r\n\r\nIt should not be presumed, however, that all, or nearly all, volcanoes\r\nare of the explosive type. Others of the more quiet type are well\r\nexemplified by the two great Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Loa and\r\nKilauea. Any but relatively very minor explosions rarely, if ever,\r\noccur, the product of such volcanoes being almost wholly lava, which\r\nflows down the mountainsides in molten streams. The Hawaiian Islands\r\nhave, in fact, been almost entirely built up by successive eruptions\r\nof lava, the building-up process having begun well below sea level.\r\nMauna Loa rises to nearly 14,000 feet above the sea, but, due to the\r\nfact that the streams of lava have spread so far, the mountain has an\r\nexceptionally low angle of slope which makes it difficult to realize\r\nthat it is so high. Considering its submarine portion, Mauna Loa\r\nreally rises nearly 30,000 feet above the sea floor. Although Kilauea\r\nlies nearly 4,000 feet above sea level on the flank of Mauna Loa, and\r\nonly twenty miles distant from it, the two volcanoes are singularly\r\nindependent in regard to their eruptions. Each mountain has a crater\r\nirregularly oval in shape, nearly three miles long, bounded by almost\r\nvertical walls of hard lava, in some cases arranged in terraces. The\r\nfloors of the great crater pits are relatively level, and consist of\r\nblack lava in which are lakes of molten and even boiling lava. The\r\nblack lava floor is, in each case, only a frozen or hardened crust upon\r\na great column of molten lava extending down into the mountain. Prior\r\nto an eruption of Mauna Loa the lava column rises hundreds of feet in\r\nthe crater, but during recent years the lava seldom, if ever, flows out\r\nover the crater rim. Instead, it breaks through the mountainsides at\r\nvarious altitudes, the great flow of 1919 having started at an altitude\r\nof about 8,000 feet. This stream of liquid rock, fully one-half of a\r\nmile wide, flowed for weeks down the mountainside and into the ocean,\r\nthe waters of which, in contact with the highly heated lava, were\r\nthrown into terrific commotion. In 1885 a stream of lava several miles\r\nwide flowed forty-five miles. In one case, lava traveled the first\r\nfifteen miles in two hours, but this is an unusually great rate of\r\nspeed. Lava streams in general seldom move faster than one or two miles\r\nper hour, and as the liquid rock gradually cools and becomes more and\r\nmore viscous, the speed diminishes to zero. Almost incredible volumes\r\nof steam emanate from streams of molten lava.\r\n\r\nIn 1840 an outflow of lava took place from the side of Kilauea Mountain\r\nand ran into the sea. Since that time the floor of the great crater\r\npit (quoting Professor W. H. Hobbs) \"has been essentially a movable\r\nplatform of frozen lava of unknown and doubtless variable thickness\r\nwhich has risen and descended (hundreds of feet) like the floor of an\r\nelevator car between its guiding ways. The floor has, however, never\r\nbeen complete, for one or more open lakes are always to be seen, that\r\nof Halemaumau, located near the southwestern margin, having been\r\nmuch the most persistent. Within the open lakes the boiling lava is\r\napparently white hot at a depth of but a few inches below the surface,\r\nand in the overturnings of the mass these hotter portions are brought\r\nto the surface and appear as white streaks marking the redder surface\r\nportions. From time to time the surface freezes over, the cracks open\r\nand erupt at favored points along the fissures, sending up jets and\r\nfountains of lava, the material of which falls in pasty fragments\r\nthat build up driblet cones. Small fluid clots are shot out, carrying\r\nthreadlike lines of lava glass behind them, the well-known 'Pelée's\r\nhair.' Sometimes the open lakes build up congealed walls, rising above\r\nthe general level of the pit, and from their rim the lava spills over\r\nin cascades to spread out upon the frozen floor.\"\r\n\r\nIn some regions, like the Columbian Plateau of the northwestern United\r\nStates and the Deccan of India, each covering about 200,000 square\r\nmiles, vast quantities of lava have been poured out layer upon layer to\r\ndepths of even thousands of feet. Distinct volcanic cones or mountains\r\nin those regions are either absent or too scarce to look to as sources\r\nof so much lava. Such lava floods were probably mostly erupted from\r\ngreat fissures in the earth's crust, the fluidity to spread many miles.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the quantitative geological importance of volcanism may be\r\nconveyed to the reader when we assert that, according to a conservative\r\nestimate, fully one-half of a million cubic miles of molten rocks have\r\nbeen poured out upon the surface of the earth through volcanic action\r\nin relatively recent geological time! The Cascade Range with its lofty\r\npeaks, including Mount Shasta and Mount Rainier, each rising more than\r\n14,000 feet above the sea, has been built up very largely by volcanic\r\naction during the last era of geologic time. Many other mountain peaks\r\nand various ranges have been similarly developed either wholly or in\r\npart. The great chain of Aleutian Islands extending hundreds of miles\r\ninto the sea, is the scene of much volcanic activity where a great\r\nmountain range is now literally being born out of the sea by the\r\nprocesses of vulcanism.\r\n\r\nBefore this the reader has more than likely wondered about the source\r\nof the heat, vapors (mainly water), and power involved in volcanic\r\naction. Answers to these questions are closely tied up with the precise\r\ncause (or causes) of volcanic action which remains one of the most\r\nuncertain of the larger problems of geologic science. Before briefly\r\ndiscussing the causes, a few additional facts should be stated. First,\r\nin regard to the heat, a careful determination of the temperature\r\nof the molten lava of Kilauea in 1911 showed it to be 1,260 degrees\r\nCentigrade, or 2,300 degrees F. This is, however, a relatively low\r\ntemperature, because many lavas from other regions show melting points\r\nall the way up to at least 2,000 degrees Centigrade (3,600 degrees\r\nF.). Water in the form of steam is quantitatively one of the greatest\r\nproducts of volcanoes. A fair idea of the tremendous volumes of water\r\ninvolved may be gained from the statement that a careful estimate shows\r\nthat fully 460,000,000 gallons of water in the form of steam erupted\r\nfrom a single secondary cone of Mount Etna during a period of 100\r\ndays. Among other gases which are given off in greater or less amounts\r\nduring volcanic activity are carbonic acid gas, sulphureted hydrogen,\r\nsulphur dioxide, and hydrochloric acid. Some idea of the power back of\r\nvolcanoes may be gained not only from the tremendous explosions such\r\nas those above described, but also from the fact that the pressure\r\nnecessary to raise the column of lava from sea level to the top of\r\nMauna Loa (nearly 14,000 feet) is about 1,150 atmospheres, or about\r\n17,000 pounds per square inch. The actual pressure must there be much\r\ngreater because the lava is forced up from far below sea level.\r\n\r\nA long-held idea that a relatively thin crust covers a molten interior,\r\nand that downward pressure of this crust due to earth contraction\r\ncauses molten rocks to be forced out, has been too thoroughly disproved\r\nto now be at all seriously entertained. The fact that near-by volcanoes\r\ncommonly erupt entirely independently, as in the case of Mauna Loa\r\nand Kilauea, shows that there can be no universal liquid beneath a\r\nrelatively thin crust. Other arguments against liquidity of the earth's\r\ninterior are that the earth acts like a body nearly as rigid as steel\r\nagainst the powerful tide-producing forces, and that earthquake waves\r\nwhich pass through the earth to a depth of at least 2,000 miles are the\r\nkind which require a solid medium for transmission.\r\n\r\nLet us then briefly consider more plausible views regarding the cause\r\nof volcanic action. First of all we may be sure that the earth is\r\nhighly heated inside. Measurements in many deep borings show that the\r\ntemperature increases at the rate of about 1 degree F. for each 50 to\r\n60 feet downward, to depths greater than a mile. Accordingly, on the\r\nbasis of 1 degree rise in 50 feet, at depths of 20 to 35 miles, the\r\ntemperature must be great enough (2,120 degrees to 3,590 degrees F.),\r\nto cause all ordinary rocks to melt _if they were at the surface_. At\r\nsuch depths, however, the downward pressure upon the rocks is so great\r\nthat their melting points are notably raised, and there is every reason\r\nto believe that under ordinary conditions the rocks 20 to 35 miles down\r\nare not molten. If we adhere to the older (nebular) hypothesis of earth\r\norigin, the interior heat of the earth is left over from the cooling,\r\nonce molten, earth. On the basis of another (planetesimal) hypothesis,\r\nthe earth's heat is due to the steady, powerful action of gravity\r\ncausing the earth to contract. In any case, the earth is hot inside as\r\nproved by deep well records and igneous phenomena in general, and it is\r\na contracting or shrinking body as proved by the many large scale zones\r\nof wrinkling or folding of rocks. If, then, highly heated solid rocks\r\nat reasonable distances down in any part of the earth are subjected\r\nto relief of pressure by an earth movement such as upward crumpling\r\nof the crust, or by readjustment of large fault blocks, such heated\r\nsolid rocks would become molten. The very earth movement which brings\r\nabout relief of pressure and melting may very reasonably be regarded\r\nas the power which forces some of the newly formed molten material\r\nhigher up into the earth's crust, and even out upon the surface. This\r\nview harmonizes with the well-known fact, already mentioned, that the\r\nmain belts of active volcanoes are also the main belts of active earth\r\nmovements, such as earthquakes.\r\n\r\nAnother source of power behind volcanic action is steam pressure. We\r\nhave already mentioned the fact that vast amounts of water in the form\r\nof steam escape from volcanoes or even from streams of molten lava. The\r\nviolent volcanic explosions are quite certainly all, or nearly all,\r\ndirect results of sudden giving way of volcanoes to steam pressure\r\nwhich accumulates during greater or less periods of time, and with\r\nlittle or no possibility of escape, without rupturing the mountain.\r\nSteam alone, or combined with some of the other gases so common as\r\nvolcanic products, may also aid in forcing out molten rock. What is\r\nthe source of the steam and other gases or vapors? According to one\r\nview they were originally in the earth, while according to another view\r\nthe water at least has been absorbed by the molten rocks from surface\r\nwaters which worked their way downward. At least two arguments oppose\r\nthe second hypothesis: first, that not a few volcanoes are really many\r\nmiles from the sea or other bodies of water, while downward percolation\r\nof rain water would fall far short of supplying the tremendous\r\nquantities of water ejected, and second, any water taken up by molten\r\nrock must be absorbed within a very few miles of the surface because,\r\nas we have learned, farther down there are no openings large enough to\r\npermit the downward passage of water, but, as a matter of fact, the\r\nvery upper part of the earth's crust is just the place where molten\r\nrocks begin to give up their water, often with terrific violence.\r\n\r\nWe may now turn to a consideration of the other very important kind of\r\nigneous activity, namely, the rise and transfer of molten materials\r\nwithin the earth's crust, but not to the surface. The quantity of such\r\ndeep-seated (so-called \"plutonic\") igneous rock material which has\r\nbeen intruded into the earth's crust within known geologic time, is\r\nfar greater than that which has been forced to surface, that is the\r\nso-called \"volcanic\" material. The plutonic rocks are always thoroughly\r\ncrystallized, and they are generally coarser grained than the volcanic\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nWhere molten materials have been forced into cracks or fissures in the\r\ncrust of the earth and there congealed, we have a very common mode of\r\noccurrence called \"dikes\" (Plate 9). In many regions often one set of\r\ndikes was formed, after which one or more succeeding injections from\r\nthe same or different deep-seated bodies of molten rock took place,\r\nand some of the later dikes were forced to cut across earlier ones.\r\nDikes of all lengths up to at least thirty miles, and of all widths up\r\nto many hundreds of feet, are known, but they are generally less than\r\na mile long and not more than a few feet or rods wide. They have been\r\nintruded into all kinds of rock formations--igneous, sedimentary, and\r\nmetamorphic. Dikes are common in many parts of the world and they often\r\nexcite the interest of lay-men. They are wonderfully displayed along\r\nthe southern coast of Maine. Plate 9 shows small dikes where the molten\r\nmaterial was forced from a larger mass into a body of older dark\r\nrock. The Palisades of the Hudson River, just north of New York City,\r\nconsists of a layer of igneous rock several hundred feet thick which,\r\nin the molten condition, was forced nearly horizontally between layers\r\nof sandstone millions of years ago, that is in the early Mesozoic era.\r\nThe palisade or columnar structure was caused by cracking of the rock\r\nduring the cooling and contraction. This is the explanation of most\r\ncolumnar structures of igneous rocks, exceptionally fine exhibitions\r\nbeing at the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, and Devil's Tower, Wyoming\r\n(Plate 10).\r\n\r\nA type of occurrence not so common, but of special interest, is where\r\na body of molten rock rising in nearly horizontal strata becomes\r\ncooler and therefore stiffer or more viscous and, losing its power to\r\npenetrate, forces its way between the layers causing the strata to be\r\narched or domed over it. Sufficient removal of overlying material by\r\nerosion has revealed many fine examples of this type of occurrence.\r\n\r\nAnother type of interest is the volcanic neck, which is the core or\r\nplug filling the feeding channel of a volcano. In certain regions, like\r\nparts of Arizona and New Mexico, extinct volcanic mountains may be all\r\ncut away by erosion, except the central cores or necks which, both\r\nbecause they are more resistant and are last to be reached by erosion,\r\nstand out conspicuously as great towers on the landscape (Plate 9).\r\n\r\nMost important of all from the quantitative standpoint, however, are\r\nthe great bodies of igneous rocks, ranging up to many miles across,\r\nwhich, in a molten condition, were forced irregularly into the earth's\r\ncrust from unknown depths.\r\n\r\nThe common rock called granite belongs in this category of rocks, which\r\nare the best and most extensively developed of all igneous types.\r\nThe roots or cores of great mountain ranges often consist of such\r\nrocks which are exposed to view only after removal of great thickness\r\nof overlying material. Immense areas of granite and other plutonic\r\nrocks of extra deep-seated origin are exposed, because of removal of\r\noverlying material by erosion, in southeastern Canada, the Adirondack\r\nMountains, New England, the Piedmont Plateau of the Atlantic Coast, and\r\nin the Sierra Nevada Mountains. All the rock forming the lofty walls of\r\nYosemite Valley is granite, which was forced into the earth's crust in\r\nrelatively late Mesozoic time, and which has since been laid bare by\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWATERS WITHIN THE EARTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been estimated that approximately 1,500 cubic miles of water\r\nfall upon the surface of the United States each year. About one-half\r\nof this goes back into the atmosphere by evaporation; about one-third\r\nof it flows away in surface streams; and the remaining one-sixth\r\nenters the crust of the earth. Considerable water which enters the\r\nearth returns to the surface as springs, by capillarity of soils and\r\nrocks, or by being drawn up into plants and evaporated. Some idea of\r\nthe amount of ground water may be gleaned from the statement, based\r\nupon a careful estimate, that all the water in the rocks and soils of\r\nthe first 100 feet below the surface of the United States would make a\r\nlayer seventeen feet thick. In most humid regions the soils and loose\r\nrock formations are saturated with water at greater or less depths\r\n(usually less than 100 feet) below the surface. The surface of this\r\nsaturated layer is called the ground-water level, or more familiarly\r\nthe \"water table.\" The water table shifts up and down more or less\r\naccording to variation in rainfall.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the water held in the loose rocks and soils near the\r\nearth's surface, large quantities occur in definite layers (usually\r\nstrata) of porous rocks which very commonly extend at various angles,\r\nhundreds or even thousands of feet into the earth. A very fine\r\nillustration of this principle is the case of the Dakota sandstone\r\nformation of Nebraska. Almost anywhere across the State a well drilled\r\nthrough a bed of clay and into the porous sandstone layer encounters\r\nwater. (Figure 19.) Another principle is also well illustrated,\r\nnamely, that water in such a porous layer may actually travel hundreds\r\nof miles, water obtained from a well sunk to the Dakota sandstone\r\nhaving actually traveled under the surface of the State all the way\r\nfrom the eastern face of the Rocky Mountains, where rain and melting\r\nsnow entered the upturned and exposed porous rock layer. Another good\r\nexample is Iowa, where certain porous rock layers outcropping in the\r\nnorthwestern and northeastern corners of that and adjacent States\r\ngradually bend down under the State, reaching the greatest depths (up\r\nto 3,000 feet) far in the interior. From wells 3,000 feet deep near\r\nBoone, Iowa, it is, therefore, a fact that some of the water pumped\r\nout of the earth actually traveled underground all the way from beyond\r\nthe corners of the State. This sort of travel of underground water is\r\ncommon in many parts of the world. It should be clearly understood\r\nthat such water does not flow freely as in a pipe along subterranean\r\npassageways, but rather it slowly works its way between the grains of\r\nporous rock. Where such water moves distinctly downward, and the porous\r\nlayer has both above and below it an impervious rock layer like shale\r\nor clay, it gradually gets under greater and greater pressure. In some\r\ncases such pressure has actually been found by deep drilling to be\r\nequivalent to that of a column of water several thousand feet high. The\r\nrate of motion of water in porous underground rock layers is very slow,\r\ndata from various sources indicating a rate of speed of not more than\r\none-fifth of a mile a year in coarse porous sandstone, while in many\r\nrocks it cannot be more than ten to fifty feet per year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Vertical (structure) section from the Rocky\r\nMountains to Omaha, Nebraska, illustrating a widespread underground\r\nporous rock layer (the Dakota sandstone) charged with water under\r\npressure, the clay formation acting as a cap rock. (After Darton, U. S.\r\nGeological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nWe still have to consider a third mode of occurrence of waters within\r\nthe earth. Many formations, like granite and other types of crystalline\r\nrocks are neither in definite layers, nor are they sufficiently porous\r\nto allow water to really flow through them. Where such rocks extend\r\nfar down from or near the surface, how does rain water descend? It\r\ndoes so along cracks or fractures (both joints and faults) which we\r\nhave learned are almost universally abundantly present in all hard\r\nrocks in the upper (or zone of fracture) portion of the earth's crust.\r\nJoint cracks are generally very irregular in direction and spacing,\r\nwhile fault fractures are usually fairly regular and straight. Many\r\ncracks are not wide enough to allow anything like good passageways for\r\nwater, while others are sufficiently open to allow water to travel\r\nalong them for hundreds, or even thousands of feet. In canyons of the\r\nWest, springs not rarely emerge from the bottoms of great, nearly\r\nvertical ledges of granite and other hard crystalline rocks, the waters\r\ncertainly having entered the rocks hundreds, or even some thousands of\r\nfeet, higher. In rocks of the kind here considered it is evident, then,\r\nthat the movements of subterranean waters must be mostly exceedingly\r\nirregular and usually not in great quantities. In many deep mines of\r\nthe world, underground water causes little or no trouble except often\r\nnear the surface. Occasionally a shaft or tunnel strikes a prominent\r\njoint or fault fracture filled with water.\r\n\r\nWhat we might really call underground streams may occur only under\r\nexceptional conditions in rocks other than limestone, but in limestone\r\nthey are not uncommon because the slow solubility of the rock allows\r\nunderground waters to slowly enlarge the passageways to form distinct\r\nchannels. Echo River, which flows through Mammoth Cave, is a fine case\r\nin point.\r\n\r\nMost water by far which emerges as springs, was at one time surface\r\nwater. A simple, but common case is where rain water soaking through\r\nporous soil (e.g., sand) or rock, sinks to the top of an underlying\r\nimpervious layer (e.g., clay) along whose surface it flows until it\r\nreaches the side of a valley where a spring results. In fact, wherever\r\nthe water table is crossed by the surface of the ground, water must\r\neither seep or flow out. Where underground streams which are common in\r\nlimestone regions reach the surface on hill or valley sides, springs\r\nresult. Another source of springs is where under proper conditions of\r\nslope a porous rock layer, charged with water well below the surface,\r\nappears at a lower level than its source of water. Still another type\r\nof spring is where a fissure or fracture crosses a water-bearing layer\r\nin which the pressure is great enough to cause the water to rise to the\r\nsurface along the relatively open fissure or fracture.\r\n\r\nIn various localities we hear of springs in seemingly paradoxical\r\nsituations on tops of hills and even mountains. Such a mystery is not\r\ndifficult to clear up. In the first place, such springs are rarely at\r\nthe summit of the hill or mountain. A case well known to many persons\r\nis the small, but never-failing spring a little below the summit of\r\nMount Whiteface, a peak in the Adirondacks, rising 3,000 feet above the\r\ngeneral level of the immediately surrounding country. In this case, a\r\nmass of highly fractured rock, subjected to much rainfall and lying\r\nabove the level of the spring, is sufficiently large easily to contain\r\nand give forth enough water to account for several such springs. In\r\nrare cases, however, springs or flowing wells are located on summits,\r\nand in such places it is only necessary to bear in mind some of the\r\nprinciples above set forth, but mainly the facts that water may travel\r\nunder pressure long distances underground, and that the point of\r\nemergence may be on a hill which is actually lower than the source of\r\nthe water far away.\r\n\r\nThe economic significance of underground waters is forcibly brought\r\nto our attention when we realize that 75 per cent of the people of\r\nthe United States depend upon wells for their water supply. Many city\r\nsupplies, most farm supplies, and much irrigation water come from\r\nwells. The 3,000,000 people of Iowa, for example, are dependent upon\r\nunderground waters from wells varying in depth from a few feet to\r\nseveral thousand feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Ideal section illustrating the chief requisite\r\nconditions of artesian wells. A, a porous stratum; B and C, impervious\r\nbeds below and above A, acting as confining strata; F, the height of\r\nthe water level in the porous bed A, or, in other words, the height of\r\nthe reservoir or fountainhead; D and E, flowing wells springing from\r\nthe porous water-filled bed A. (After U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nMost wells are simply dug to depths a little below the water table. In\r\nhumid climate regions the depths seldom exceed fifty feet. The water\r\nencountered in such wells is rarely under pressure. In some regions of\r\ndeep soils or loose formations, wells are actually bored with an auger\r\nto depths of as great as 200 feet. Deep wells in relatively hard rocks\r\nare always drilled to depths of even thousands of feet. In such cases\r\nthe purpose is to strike either a porous rock layer charged with water,\r\nor a crack or fissure filled with water, the water almost always being\r\nunder pressure (sometimes very great), under such conditions. These are\r\ncalled artesian wells whether the water under pressure actually flows\r\nout at the surface or not.\r\n\r\nWe may now inquire as to the necessary conditions for artesian wells.\r\nThis may best be done by the aid of diagrams. Figure 20 illustrates a\r\nvery common case where a porous layer, lying between impervious layers,\r\npassing under a valley, comes to the surface of the hills on each side\r\nwhere the water enters the porous layer. On sinking a well to the\r\nwater-charged layer, the water rushes through the hole to a greater or\r\nless distance above the surface. In Figure 21 the porous and impervious\r\nlayers are simply tilted, and the water under pressure rises through\r\nthe free opening to the surface. Wells of this kind are also common\r\nin the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the United States. In another case,\r\nless comprehensible to the layman, the porous water-bearing stratum\r\ncurves downward under a hill or mountain, water entering it where it\r\nis exposed on each side. Under such conditions a flowing artesian well\r\ncannot be drilled at or near the summit, but since the water is under\r\npressure it will rise in the hole to a level approaching that of the\r\nlowest part of the outcrop of the porous layer on either side of the\r\nhill or mountain. This is essentially the condition of things toward\r\nthe interior of Iowa, where water from the deeper wells rises 2,000\r\nfeet or more in the holes, but does not reach the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Section illustrating the thinning out of a\r\nporous water-bearing bed. A, inclosed between impervious beds B and C,\r\nthus furnishing the necessary conditions for an artesian fountain at D.\r\n(After U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nThe drilling of deep wells, where records, including samples of rock\r\nmaterials brought up, have been kept, has been a great aid to the\r\ngeologist in determining, or rendering more precise, the knowledge of\r\nnot only the kinds of rocks underground, but also the thicknesses and\r\nstructural relations of the formations.\r\n\r\nIn yet another way deep wells are of special significance, that is in\r\nregard to the light which they throw upon the subterranean temperature\r\nof the earth. Very recently the deepest well in the world was drilled\r\nnear Fairmont, West Virginia, to a depth of 7,579 feet, in quest of\r\noil or gas. At a depth of 7,500 feet, the temperature was found to be\r\n168 degrees F. Allowing for a near-surface temperature 50 degrees,\r\nthis means an average rate of increase downward of 1 degree in 62\r\nfeet. The second deepest well is near Clarksburg, West Virginia, sunk\r\nto a depth of 7,386 feet, with a temperature of 172 degrees at the\r\n7,000-foot level, or at the rate Of 1 degree in 57 feet, allowing for\r\na near-surface temperature of 50 degrees. It is a remarkable fact,\r\nthat little or no water was encountered all the way down. A well 7,348\r\nfeet deep in southeastern Germany gave a temperature of 186 degrees\r\nat the bottom, or a rate of increase of 1 degree in 54 feet. These\r\nthree records are about the average for the deep holes of the world.\r\nNext to the deepest mining shafts in the world are in the copper\r\nmining region of northern Michigan, where over 5,000 feet (counted\r\nvertically, not down the slope) down the temperature is nearly 90\r\ndegrees the year round. The rate of increase is here less than in most\r\nwells of such depth, because of the cooling air currents. Many years\r\nago a rather remarkable experiment in well drilling was tried by the\r\ncity of Budapest, Hungary, the attempt being to get a supply of water\r\nat the brewing temperature of 176 degrees in order to encourage the\r\nmanufacture of beer. After getting a good supply of water at a depth\r\nof 3,120 feet and a temperature of 158 degrees, work was stopped. In\r\nbuilding the two great tunnels (St. Gotthard and Simplon) through\r\nportions of the Alps, such high temperatures were encountered that work\r\nwas continued only under great difficulties. In the famous Comstock\r\ngold and silver mine of Nevada, over forty years ago, temperatures as\r\nhigh as 157 degrees were encountered in the shafts at a depth of only\r\n2,000 feet or a little over, the exceptional temperature for such depth\r\nno doubt being due to occurrence of the ores in geologically recent\r\nigneous rocks which have not yet cooled to the normal temperature for\r\nthe depth of 2,000 feet.\r\n\r\nFrom the sanitary standpoint, wells are of very great significance,\r\nespecially in view of the fact that such a large proportion of people\r\ndepend upon well water. It is generally understood that typhoid\r\nfever is more common in the country than in cities, in spite of what\r\nmight reasonably be expected. What are some of the causes leading\r\nup to such a situation? The idea that water purifies itself after\r\nflowing a relatively short distance is, in many cases, far from being\r\ntrue, especially when we are dealing with underground water. Actual\r\nobservations prove that germ-laden water may travel surprisingly far\r\nunderground. Germ-laden water from barns, cesspools, or outhouses\r\nspreads notably on sinking to the water table and it is easy to see\r\nhow so many wells become contaminated. On general principles, a\r\ngeologist is especially wary of water from a well in a barn yard.\r\nThe well for human use at least should be located out of reasonable\r\nrange of such contamination. Under the condition of the diagram a\r\nwell or spring some distance down the side of the hill may actually\r\nbe unfit for use, though a serious situation is much less likely to\r\ndevelop there. Nor should one assume that by locating the well on\r\nthe uphill side of the house, and the outhouses or cesspool on the\r\ndownhill side, safety is assured. From what we have learned in regard\r\nto earth movements, and the tilting of strata from their original\r\npositions, we know how the movement of water in the saturated zone\r\nnear the surface may be downhill roughly following the hill slope,\r\nwhile in a tilted porous layer of rock farther below the surface the\r\nmovement of water may be in just the opposite direction. A well drilled\r\ninto the solid rock for safety on the uphill side of a house might\r\nderive its water from this very same porous layer, whose water has\r\nbeen contaminated from a cesspool or other source down the side of\r\nthe hill. Such a case is by no means a theory or a rarity. There is\r\nalso real danger of contamination in cases where the water flows more\r\nlike streams underground through cracks or fissures in hard or dense\r\nrocks, or through channels developed by solution in limestone. It may\r\nhappen that water becoming contaminated from barn sites, cesspools, or\r\nouthouses finds its way along such a channel to the side or bottom of\r\na well. The author well remembers the case of a farmer whose house,\r\nbarn, and well were close together on a little limestone terrace and\r\nwho continued to use the well water although he complained of its\r\ndisagreeable taste, especially after a rain when he could \"taste the\r\nbarn in it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Diagram illustrating a danger of contamination\r\nof wells by impure underground water. S, soil; B, bedrock; P, porous\r\nstratum. Impure water from cesspool moves through porous layer to\r\nbottom of well. (By the author.)]\r\n\r\nFinally, in this connection, it may be said that wells should be\r\nlocated in the light of the principles above explained, best of all\r\nupon the advice of some one with geological training, and that, to\r\ninsure safety to health from the well water, sanitary analyses (at\r\nsmall cost) should be made once or twice a year. A bad well should be\r\nabandoned and a new one sunk.\r\n\r\nA large amount of money has been wasted upon, and much mystery and\r\nsuperstition has surrounded so-called \"water witches,\" or those who\r\nclaim some special or supernatural power of locating supplies of\r\nunderground water. Most common of all devices used is the so-called\r\n\"divining rod,\" which is a forked stick of willow, witch-hazel, or\r\nother wood, according to the seemingly special requirement of the\r\noperator. Certain mechanical and electrical devices are also employed.\r\nWith one fork of the divining rod grasped in each hand and the main\r\npart of the stick upright, the operator walks about until, due to\r\nsome \"mysterious\" influence, a place is found where underground\r\nwater pulls the upright portion of the stick downward in spite of\r\nthe grasp of the holder. Some operators even claim to know just how\r\ndeep a well must be sunk. Without any attempt to question the honesty\r\nof all operators, geologists are in full accord with the following\r\nquotation from a paper published by M. L. Fuller, for the United States\r\nGeological Survey: \"The uselessness of the divining rod is indicated\r\nby the facts that it may be worked at will by the operator, that he\r\nfails to detect strong water currents in tunnels and other channels\r\nthat afford no surface indications of water, and that his locations\r\nin limestone regions where water flows in well-defined channels are\r\nno more successful than those dependent upon mere guesses. In fact,\r\nits operators are successful only in regions in which ground water\r\noccurs in definite sheets in porous material, or in more or less\r\nclayey deposits, such as pebbly clay or till. In such regions (which\r\nare extremely common) few failures can occur, for wells can get water\r\nalmost anywhere. Ground water occurs under certain definite conditions,\r\nand just as surface streams may be expected wherever there is a valley,\r\nso ground water may be found where certain rocks and conditions exist.\r\nNo appliance, either mechanical or electrical, has yet been devised\r\nthat will detect water in places where plain common sense will not show\r\nits presence just as well. The only advantage of employing a 'water\r\nwitch,' as the operator of the divining rod is sometimes called, is\r\nthat crudely skilled services are thus occasionally obtained, since\r\nthe men so employed, if endowed with any natural shrewdness, become,\r\nthrough their experience in locating wells, better observers of the\r\noccurrences and movements of ground water than the average person.\"\r\n\r\nIt should not be assumed, however, from the above statement that the\r\nlocation or foretelling of underground water is mostly hopeless from\r\na scientific point of view. In most regions the kinds of rocks which\r\nwould be pierced by wells can be more or less accurately foretold by\r\ncareful studies of the rocks exposed at the surface. But foretelling\r\nthe underground water is often much more uncertain. Where the geologic\r\nstructure or arrangement of rocks in a region is fairly regular, as\r\nin the case of most sedimentary rocks, and a few scattering deep\r\nwells have been drilled, with records preserved, the geologist, by\r\ncombining such data with his surface studies, can do much toward\r\nputting the facts regarding the underground waters of the region on a\r\nscientific basis. There are many such regions, an excellent case in\r\npoint being Iowa, regarding which State the United States Geological\r\nSurvey has published a report containing data by the use of which\r\nit is possible to foretell almost exactly what formations would be\r\npierced by drilling from 1,000 to 3,000 feet or more, the thickness\r\nof each, which ones are water-bearing and, in many cases, even the\r\ncharacter of the mineralization of the water for almost any part of\r\nthe State. Such knowledge, through the years, is worth untold millions\r\nof dollars to the State. Where the rocks are igneous and rather\r\nuniformly dense, usually little or nothing can be accurately foretold\r\nabout the underground water supplies, because in such rocks the water\r\nfollows exceedingly variable and irregular cracks and fissures. In\r\nmetamorphic rocks the difficulties are usually about as great. In\r\nlimestone regions, with humid climate, much water travels in channels\r\nunderground, but these are so exceedingly irregular that there is no\r\nway of locating them by surface studies. In humid climates it seldom\r\nhappens, however, that a well does not reach at least a fair supply of\r\nwater within a few thousand feet even in rock formations in which the\r\nwater travels along irregular cracks and channels.\r\n\r\nCertain other important features of the geological work of underground\r\nwater should be brought to the attention of the reader. One of these\r\nis its power to dissolve mineral substances of many kinds more or less\r\nrapidly. As already pointed out, limestone is especially susceptible to\r\nsolution in water, both surface and underground.\r\n\r\nThe carbonate of lime taken into solution from limestone is the\r\nprincipal substance which causes so-called \"hard water.\" Most of the\r\nsolution takes place in the upper part of the zone of fracture of the\r\nearth's crust and the dissolved substances are carried along generally\r\nto the lower levels where they tend to deposit (and crystallize),\r\nfilling fissures, cracks, and even tiny spaces between mineral grains.\r\nCracks and fissures thus filled by mineral matter from solution\r\nare called \"veins.\" In many mining regions valuable ores and other\r\nsubstances have been deposited from underground water solutions and\r\nconcentrated in veins. In many places underground waters with certain\r\nsubstances in solution travel through various rocks or encounter\r\nsolutions of other substances and, as a result of chemical action, many\r\nnew mineral combinations result. Such actions through the millions\r\nof years of geologic time have effected great changes in many rock\r\nformations. In the case of petrification, like that of petrified wood,\r\nthe buried organism slowly decomposes cell by cell, and particle by\r\nparticle it is replaced by mineral matter from underground water\r\nsolutions. In this manner the remarkable so-called petrified forests\r\n(not really forests) of Arizona and the Yellowstone Park were formed,\r\nthe petrifying material there having been the very common substance\r\ncalled silica which is the same in composition as the familiar mineral\r\nquartz. Mineral matter carried in solution in surface streams is\r\nderived from ground waters which reach the surface. An idea of the\r\ntremendous quantity of mineral matter thus removed may be gained from\r\nthe statement that by careful determination the Mississippi River\r\ncarries 120,000,000 tons in solution into the Gulf of Mexico each year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Structure section and part of landscape in a\r\nlimestone region showing how caves and natural bridges are formed by\r\nthe dissolving action of underground water. AA, limestone; BB, sink\r\nholes; DD, caves and galleries; and an arch (natural bridge) which is\r\nthe remnant of a large cave. (After Shaler, U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nOne interesting effect of the dissolving power of underground water\r\nin limestone regions is the development of caves or caverns. Most\r\nremarkable of all is Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, with its hundreds of\r\nmiles of passageways and galleries. This marvelous work of nature is\r\nall a result of the action of underground water which has dissolved\r\nand carried away vast quantities of limestone. Echo River, which flows\r\nthrough the cavern, is still carrying on the work aided by various\r\nunderground tributaries. The stalactites and stalagmites, which are\r\nso strikingly displayed in many caves, as at Luray, Virginia, in\r\nwhich water with carbonate of lime drips or oozes from the roof and,\r\ndue mainly to evaporation, deposits the lime. Many wonderful and\r\nfantastic effects are thus produced. Where part of the roof of a cave\r\nis dissolved out, or falls in, a \"sink hole\" results. Where all but a\r\nportion of the roof of a cave or underground channel has fallen in,\r\na natural bridge, like the famous one in Virginia, results, though\r\nnatural bridges are also formed by other means.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter we shall briefly discuss hot underground\r\nwaters, hot springs, and geysers. There are two well-known ways by\r\nwhich underground waters may become heated. One is by the movement of\r\nwater downward into the normally heated portion of the earth, the rate\r\nof increase downward being, as above stated, 1 degree F. for about\r\n50 to 60 feet. Water descending two miles would, therefore, attain a\r\ntemperature of about 200 degrees F. In some regions such a temperature\r\nmay be reached at depths considerably less. Such water (under pressure)\r\ntaking a short course to the surface (forming springs) at a lower\r\nlevel would retain much of its heat taken up far below the surface.\r\nIn regions where there are great down-folds of the strata (i.e.,\r\nsynclines), as in the central to southern Appalachians, conditions\r\nappear to be favorable for such warm or hot springs, as, for example,\r\nat Hot Springs, Virginia. A second cause of the heating of underground\r\nwater is by the descent of surface waters into contact with masses of\r\nstill hot igneous rock of relatively recent geologic age. In some such\r\ncases the water does not go more than some hundreds of feet down and\r\nwhen, under proper conditions, it returns to the surface hot and even\r\nboiling springs may result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 7.--An Upbend Fold (_anticline_) in the\r\nAppalachian Mountain Strata Near Hancock, Maryland. The strata were\r\ndeposited in horizontal layers upon the sea bottom, covering the region\r\nmany millions of years ago in middle Paleozoic time. At the time of\r\nthe Appalachian Mountain revolution, near the end of Paleozoic time,\r\nthis and many other folds developed well below the surface. Removal\r\nof overlying material by erosion has laid bare the fold as we see it\r\nto-day. (_Photo by Russell, U. S.

They are most wonderfully displayed\r\nin the Yellowstone National Park, where they send columns of hot\r\nwater to all heights up to 250 feet at various intervals of time.\r\nAlmost incredible amounts of hot water are sent into the air every\r\nday in the geyser basins of Yellowstone Park. The single geyser \"Old\r\nFaithful,\" which erupts at intervals of about seventy minutes, sends\r\na column of water several feet in diameter to heights of from 125 to\r\n150 feet. During each eruption about 1,500,000 gallons of water are\r\nsent forth, or every day enough to supply the need of a fairly large\r\ncity. A very brief explanation of the cause of geyser eruptions may\r\nbe stated as follows: The very irregular, narrow, geyser tube extends\r\nnearly vertically downward into yet uncooled lava. The tube is more or\r\nless rapidly filled by underground water. The bottom, or near-bottom,\r\nportion of the water gradually becomes heated by the lava until finally\r\nthe boiling point is reached for that depth. But, because of the\r\npressure of the overlying water column, the boiling point at that depth\r\nis considerably greater than for the surface. A little steam develops\r\nfar down and this causes the whole column of water above it to lift\r\nslightly, thus relieving the pressure on the superheated water far\r\ndown. This relief of pressure allows much of the superheated water far\r\ndown to flash into steam, which violently forces the column of water\r\nout of the geyser tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nHOW MOUNTAINS COME AND GO\r\n\r\n\r\nMountains constitute the grandest relief features of the earth, and\r\nsome of the most profound lessons of earth changes may be learned by\r\nstudying them. To the layman who views great mountains in all their\r\ngrandeur and massiveness, the expression \"everlasting hills\" seems\r\nappropriate. But the geologist knows that even the loftiest mountains\r\nare only temporary features on the face of the earth. Like organisms,\r\nthey come and go. For example, where the great Rocky Mountains now\r\nstand was only a few million years ago (in late Mesozoic time) the\r\nbottom of an interior sea. Where the Appalachians now stand there were\r\nno mountains late in the Paleozoic era (not less than ten or twelve\r\nmillion years ago), but instead sea water covered the district. Then\r\nthe Appalachians were formed, lifting their heads much higher than at\r\npresent, after which they were cut down almost to sea level, and then\r\nonce more upraised. The Coast Range Mountains of our Pacific Coast have\r\ncome into existence since the middle of the present (Cenozoic) geologic\r\nera. Every mountain, like every organism, has a life history, in some\r\ncases simple, and other cases complex. All pass through stages of\r\nbirth, youth, maturity, old age, and death. Some rear their heads and\r\ndisappear after a short (geological) existence. Others continue their\r\ngrowth and persist much longer, while still others undergo periods of\r\nprofound rejuvenation.\r\n\r\nAmong the various processes by which mountain ranges have been\r\nformed, the folding and accompanying general uplift of strata are\r\nthe most important. In fact, in most of the great mountain ranges of\r\nthe world the folded structure is conspicuously developed, so much\r\nso that they may well be called \"folded mountains.\" Very commonly,\r\nhowever, mountains of this type have also been subjected to more or\r\nless fracturing of the rocks (faulting), and not uncommonly they have\r\nalso been subjected to igneous activity, including both intrusion and\r\nextrusion of molten material. It is among the folded mountains of\r\ngreater or less degree of complexity that the \"greatest exhibitions of\r\ngeologic phenomena are seen and the lessons which geology as a sciences\r\nteaches may be learned. If one desires to know the history of a region,\r\none turns naturally to its mountain ranges, for here may be found the\r\nupturned and dissected strata, a study of whose kinds, thickness,\r\nand fossils throws light upon past events, while their foldings and\r\ndislocations show the nature and results of those great dynamic\r\nagencies which, from time to time, have operated upon the outer portion\r\nof the earth, and given to it the broad distinctive features which\r\ncharacterize it to-day.\" (L. V. Pirsson.) Among the great mountains we\r\nmay also see wonderful exhibitions of the results of weathering and\r\nerosion, especially the work of rivers and glaciers.\r\n\r\nWe can, perhaps, best convey to the reader some of the main facts\r\nand principles regarding folded mountains by considering certain\r\nobservations which may be readily made in a short trip across a folded\r\nrange of not too complex kind--for example, across the Appalachian\r\nrange along the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, west of\r\nWashington, or the Pennsylvania Railroad, west of Philadelphia. It\r\nwould be most evident that the mountains consist of strata, that is\r\nsedimentary rocks, such as sandstone, shale and limestone, which were\r\ndeposited under water. A few measurements would reveal the fact that\r\nthousands of feet in thickness of strata are represented. Careful\r\nmeasurements by geologists have, in fact, shown that the strata were\r\noriginally piled up layer upon layer to a thickness of 25,000 to 30,000\r\nfeet. The fact that they are strata of such great thickness proves that\r\nsediments must there have accumulated under water for some millions\r\nof years at least. Closer examination of a few good exposures (i.e.,\r\noutcrops) would further reveal the presence of fossil shells and\r\nimpressions of marine organisms, thus definitely leading us to conclude\r\nthat the strata were accumulated under sea water, which, of course,\r\nmeans that the present site of the mountain range was once sea floor.\r\n\r\nExamination of the rock materials also establishes the fact that the\r\nstrata are such as were deposited in relatively shallow sea water--that\r\nis to say, none are at all of the sort which are now forming under\r\nreally deep ocean water. Most of the strata represent original\r\nsands (and even gravels) and muds which could have accumulated only\r\nrelatively near shore, that is within about 100 miles, which harmonizes\r\nwith a statement made in a preceding chapter to the effect that very\r\nlittle land-derived sediment is at present depositing more than 100\r\nmiles out from shore. The coarse materials (sands and gravels) could\r\nnot, of course, be carried many miles out, while many of the strata are\r\ncovered with ripple marks, thus positively proving their shallow-water\r\norigin. We conclude, therefore, that the Appalachian strata are of\r\nmarine, shallow-water origin. But we have already stated that these\r\nstrata are at least 25,000 feet thick. How, then, do we reconcile\r\nthese two seemingly paradoxical statements? All that is necessary is\r\nto realize that the floor of the shallow sea, in which the sediments\r\neroded from adjacent land were being deposited, slowly, though more\r\nor less irregularly, subsided or sank during the long ages (millions\r\nof years) of their accumulation. It would carry us too far afield to\r\nreally attempt an explanation of this remarkable type of geologic\r\nphenomenon, and it must suffice to suggest that, starting with the\r\nearth's crust in equilibrium, the very weight of accumulating strata\r\nwould tend to destroy that equilibrium and so cause subsidence.\r\n\r\nIn our trip across the mountains it would be strikingly evident that\r\nthe strata are no longer in their original horizontal position, as\r\nthey were piled up layer upon layer, but that they have been notably\r\ndisturbed and thrown into folds (Plate 7), large and small, some masses\r\nof the strata having been bent upward (anticlines) and others downward\r\n(synclines). Such folded structures could have been developed only by a\r\ngreat force of lateral compression in the earth's crust within the zone\r\nof flowage. Under compression the strata were mashed together, notably\r\nbent into curves (folds), and more or less upraised. It would also be\r\nreadily observed that the main axes of the folds extend essentially\r\nparallel to the main trend of the mountain range, thus proving that\r\nthe force of compression was exerted at right angles to the trend of\r\nthe range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.--Diagrammatic sections illustrating the\r\ndevelopment of a typical folded mountain range. Upper figure: A, the\r\nold land eroded to furnish sediments deposited under the adjacent\r\nsea at C. Middle figure: strata (C) folded as they would appear if\r\nunaffected by erosion, and a down-warp (B) between A and C. Lower\r\nfigure: condition after profound erosion, and filling of B with\r\nsediment. (Drawn by the author.)]\r\n\r\nUsing a biological analogy, a brief history of a typical folded\r\nmountain range may be stated as follows: First, there is the prenatal\r\nor embryonic stage when the materials of the range are gathering, that\r\nis when the sediments are piling up layer upon layer relatively near\r\nshore on a sinking sea bottom. Next comes the birth of the range when,\r\ndue to the great lateral compressive force, the strata are thrown into\r\nfolds and forced to appear above sea level, the range thus literally\r\nbeing born out of the sea. During the next, or youthful stage,\r\nthe range grows (with increasing altitudes) because of continued\r\napplication of the compressive force. Even during the youthful growing\r\nstage weathering and erosion attack the range and tend to reduce it.\r\nThen comes the stage of maturity, when the upbuilding (compressive)\r\nforce and the tearing down (erosive) force about counterbalance each\r\nother. At this time the range has reached its maximum height and\r\nruggedness of relief, with ridges and valleys higher and deeper than\r\nat any other time. The old-age stage sets in when the upbuilding power\r\nwanes or actually ceases, and erosion dominates or reigns supreme.\r\nSlowly but surely, unless there be a renewal by an upbuilding power,\r\nthe range is cut down until little or nothing of it remains well\r\nabove sea level, or, in other words, until a peneplain is developed.\r\nThis last stage may truly be called the death of the range. Usually,\r\nhowever, some local portions of the disappearing range, which are more\r\nresistant or more favorably situated against erosion, are left standing\r\nto at least moderate heights above the general level of the plain of\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\nThe above normal order of events may be disturbed at any stage,\r\nespecially after maturity, by renewed uplift when the streams are\r\nrevived in activity and increased ruggedness results. Even after the\r\nwhole range as a relief feature has been planed away, the site of the\r\nrange may be uplifted and a new cycle of erosion started.\r\n\r\nBy the use of two well-known examples we shall not only illustrate the\r\nabove principles of mountain history, but also show that no less than a\r\nfew million years must be allowed for the growth and decay of a great\r\nfolded range. During the last (Permian) period of the Paleozoic era\r\nthe Appalachian strata began to buckle and the yielding to pressure\r\ncontinued till well into the succeeding (Triassic) period. The climax\r\nwas reached about the close of the Permian. Then, throughout the\r\nMesozoic era, erosion reduced the central Appalachians to a great plain\r\n(peneplain) near sea level, after which, about the beginning of the\r\npresent (Cenozoic era), the site of the former range was distinctly\r\nupraised (without folding of the rocks), causing the revived streams to\r\nbegin their work of carving out the present ridges and valleys, this\r\nwork still being in progress.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Sierra Nevadas, the strata were folded into a lofty\r\nmountain range relatively late in the Mesozoic era and, by the middle\r\nof the Cenozoic era, the old-age stage of erosion was well advanced\r\nwhen the range was not more than a few thousand feet high. Then (in\r\nthe middle of the Cenozoic era) uplift, accompanied by faulting on a\r\nlarge scale, but not by folding, took place, and the range was notably\r\nrejuvenated to about its present height. All the remarkably deep\r\ncanyons of the Sierras have been carved out since the rejuvenation.\r\n\r\nHow is the geological birthday of a mountain range determined? In the\r\npreceding paragraph we stated that the Appalachians were folded and\r\nborn out of the sea about the close of the Paleozoic era. This is\r\nreadily proved by calling attention to two facts. First, the youngest\r\nstrata involved in the folding are of Permian, or late Paleozoic Age\r\nin the geologic column, as proved by their fossil content, etc.,\r\nand obviously the folding must have taken place after they had been\r\ndeposited. Clearly, then, the folding could not have taken place before\r\nvery late Paleozoic time. Second, the oldest strata resting upon the\r\nfolded rocks are of early (not the very earliest) Mesozoic Age, and\r\nthese strata are somewhat tilted but not folded. Obviously, then, the\r\nfolding must have occurred before the nonfolded strata were deposited,\r\nwhich means that the folding must have been essentially completed\r\nin not later than early Mesozoic time. Or, in the case of the Rocky\r\nMountains, we know that strata were there folded late in the Mesozoic\r\nera or very early in the Cenozoic era, because folded rocks as late\r\nin age as late Mesozoic (Cretaceous) have resting upon them, in some\r\nplaces, nonfolded strata of early Cenozoic (Tertiary) Age. The figure\r\nclearly shows how the Ordovician strata must have been folded before\r\nthe next (Silurian and Devonian) strata were deposited upon them in\r\nsoutheastern New York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Diagram illustrating the topography and\r\nfolded structure of the Appalachian Mountains west of Harrisburg,\r\nPennsylvania. The valleys have been etched out of belts of weak rocks,\r\nwhile outcropping resistant rocks stand out to form ridges. Note the\r\ncourse of the Susquehanna River across the mountain ridges, this being\r\na \"superimposed river\" (see text, p. 233). (Drawn by A. K. Lobeck.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Only slightly tilted strata of Silurian and\r\nDevonian ages resting upon folded strata of Cambrian and Ordovician\r\nages in an east-west section across the Catskill Mountains and Hudson\r\nValley of New York. The folding took place at the time of the Taconic\r\nMountain Revolution toward the end of the Ordovician period. (Drawn by\r\nthe author.)]\r\n\r\nAs already suggested, however, folding is not the only method by\r\nwhich mountains are formed. Many ranges are either entirely due to\r\nthe tilting of earth blocks by faulting or fracturing of the earth,\r\nor their present altitude, at least, is a direct result of faulting.\r\nSuch may be called block mountains. They are wonderfully represented\r\nby the various north-south ranges rising some thousands of feet above\r\nthe general level of the Great Basin region of Utah and Nevada.\r\nThese ranges are, in short, somewhat eroded edges of approximately\r\nparallel-tilted fault blocks lying between the Sierra Nevada Range and\r\nthe Wasatch Range. In southeastern Oregon a series of nearly parallel\r\nblock mountains, up to forty miles in length and over 1,000 feet in\r\nheight, show very steep eastern fronts only slightly modified by\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of origin of mountains is by the rise of molten material\r\nto the surface, especially where a chain of volcanoes is located. Thus\r\nthe Cascade Mountains from northern California through Oregon and\r\nWashington, including Mounts Lassen, Shasta, Pitt, Baker, St. Helens,\r\nand Rainier, are very largely the result of volcanic action. The long\r\nchain of Aleutian Islands of Alaska, referred to in our study of\r\nvolcanoes, is an excellent example of a great mountain range now being\r\nbuilt up out of the sea by volcanic action. More locally molten rocks\r\nunder pressure may not reach the surface but instead simply bulge or\r\ndome the strata over them, as in the case of the group known as the\r\nHenry Mountains of Utah, and also in other parts of the West.\r\n\r\nIn still other cases mountains of considerable area and altitude have\r\nresulted from erosion of uplifted regions where the uplift has been\r\npractically unaccompanied by either folding, faulting, or igneous\r\nactivity. Any low-lying area, regardless of the character of its rocks,\r\nstructure, or previous history, may be notably upraised and simply\r\nsubjected to erosion. An excellent illustration is afforded by the\r\nCatskill Mountains of New York, where numerous deep valleys and narrow\r\nridges have been carved out of upraised nearly horizontal strata. The\r\nso-called \"Bad Lands\" region of parts of South Dakota and Wyoming is\r\nalso essentially of this type, where deep, narrow valleys and sharp\r\nridges have been etched out of high, relatively soft, nearly horizontal\r\nstrata, resulting in an almost impassable maze of mountains. In the\r\nhigh, recently upraised Colorado Plateau of parts of Arizona, New\r\nMexico, Colorado, and Utah, nearly horizontal strata are being etched\r\nout, the result being numerous buttes, mesas (flat-topped hills and\r\nmountains) and deep canyons, including the Grand Canyon with its maze\r\nof peaks and pinnacles, many of them rising like mountains out of the\r\ncanyon depths.\r\n\r\nMountains of the pure types just described are not the prevailing\r\nones of the earth. Most mountains and their structures, as we see\r\nthem to-day, are products of two or more of the processes of folding,\r\nfaulting, igneous action, and erosion. A few well-known examples will\r\nsuffice to make this matter clearer. Thus, the Appalachian Mountains\r\noriginally developed by severe folding of thick strata. After\r\nconsiderable erosion, numerous small and large thrust faults developed,\r\nsome of the dislocations amounting to miles. Then the whole range was\r\ncut down nearly to sea level by erosion, after which the district was\r\nupraised (without folding) mostly from 2,000 to 4,000 feet, and the\r\npresent long, narrow mountain ridges and valleys have been carved out\r\nby stream erosion. Thus folding, faulting, and erosion all enter into\r\nthe height and structure of the Appalachians.\r\n\r\nA lofty mountain range still more complex in its history is the Sierra\r\nNevada of California. First, thick strata were highly folded, upraised,\r\nand intruded by great masses of molten granite. Erosion then proceeded\r\nto cut the range down to hills, after which a great fracture (fault)\r\ndeveloped along the eastern side and the Sierra Nevada earth block was\r\nnotably tilted with steep eastern front and long western slope. Erosion\r\nhas considerably modified the eastern fault face, and the deep canyons\r\nlike Yosemite, King's River and American River, have been carved out\r\nof the western slope of the great tilted fault block. Geologically\r\nrecently the central to northern portion of the range has been affected\r\nby volcanic action, streams of lava in some cases having flowed down\r\nthe valleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA STUDY OF LAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nLakes are ephemeral features on the face of the earth. Compared to the\r\ntens of millions of years of known earth history, lakes, even large\r\nones, are very short lived. They may, in truth, be regarded as merely\r\nresults of the temporary obstructions to drainage. Lake basins are\r\nknown to originate in many ways, and there are various means by which\r\nthey are destroyed. Not attempting an exhaustive, scientific treatment\r\nof the subject, our present purpose may be well served by describing\r\nand explaining some of the better known and more remarkable lakes of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nEven a cursory examination of a large map of the world reveals the fact\r\nthat the regions of most numerous lakes are those which were recently\r\noccupied by glaciers--either the vast ice sheets of the Glacial epoch\r\nor mountain (or valley) glaciers. This is because more lakes of the\r\npresent time have come into existence as direct or indirect results\r\nof glaciation than by any other cause. A considerable number of these\r\nlakes occupy rock basins which have been eroded or excavated by the\r\ndirect action of flowing ice. Small lakes of this sort are commonly\r\nfound in the upper parts of valleys formerly occupied by mountain or\r\nso-called Alpine glaciers, because there the excavating power of such\r\nglaciers was especially effective. More rarely rock basins have been\r\nscoured out by glaciers farther down their valleys. Many lakes occupy\r\nrock basins excavated by ice in the high Sierra Nevada and Cascade\r\nRanges, in the Rocky Mountains from Colorado into Canada, in the Alps,\r\nand in the mountains of Norway. Few, if any of them are, however,\r\nlarge or famous. Other lakes, some of very considerable size, occupy\r\nrock basins scoured out by the passage of the great ice sheets of\r\nthe Glacial epoch in North America and Europe, though they are less\r\ncommon than formerly supposed. Some of the many lake basins of Ontario,\r\nCanada, are quite certainly of this origin, as might well be expected,\r\nbecause the power of the great ice sheet was there in general notably\r\ngreater than south of the Great Lakes where the tendency was to unload\r\nor deposit the eroded materials as shown by the great accumulations of\r\nglacial débris (moraines).\r\n\r\nWhere the ice walls of certain existing glaciers form dams across\r\nvalleys, waters are ponded, a small lake of this kind occurring\r\nalongside the Great Aletsch Glacier of the Alps, where its wall is\r\nslowly moving past a tributary valley. Lakes of this kind also occur\r\nin Greenland and in Alaska, but none are of considerable size. During\r\nthe Great Ice Age, however, literally thousands of large and small\r\nlakes were formed, both during the advance and the retreat of the\r\nice, wherever the glacier wall blocked valleys which sloped downward\r\ntoward the ice. New York State furnishes many fine examples of large\r\nand small lakes of this sort. Thus, when the great glacier was melting\r\nin northern New York, waters hundreds of feet deep and many miles long\r\nwere ponded between two ice lobes--one retreating eastward and the\r\nother westward from the Mohawk Valley. An ice dam lake was also formed\r\na little later, when an ice wall blocked the northern part of the\r\nBlack River Valley just west of the Adirondack Mountains and caused a\r\nlake covering about 200 square miles. One of the largest of all known\r\nice dam lakes has been called Lake Agassiz, which attained a maximum\r\nlength of over 700 miles and a width of 250 miles in the Red River of\r\nthe North region of eastern North Dakota, western and northwestern\r\nMinnesota, and northward into Canada, most of its area having been\r\nin Canada. It began as a small lake with southward drainage into the\r\nMississippi when the great northward retreating ice sheet formed a dam\r\nacross the valley of the Red River of the North. The retreating ice\r\ncontinued to block the northward drainage until the vast lake, covering\r\na greater territory than all of the present Great Lakes combined,\r\nwas developed. Beaches, bars, deltas and the outflow channel of this\r\nremarkable lake are wonderfully well preserved. Lake Winnipeg is a mere\r\nremnant of great Lake Agassiz.\r\n\r\nMany ponds and small lakes occupy basins formed by irregular\r\naccumulations of glacial (morainic) materials. Still others lie in\r\ndepressions which formed by the melting of masses of ice which became\r\nwholly or partly buried by ice deposits, or by sediments washed into\r\nbodies of water which were held up by ice dams. Depressions of the\r\nlatter kind are commonly found as pits or so-called \"kettle holes\"\r\nbelow the general level of sand flats or sand plains of glacial lake\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nMost common of all lake basins of glacial origin are those formed by\r\naccumulation of glacial débris or morainic materials acting as natural\r\ndams across valleys. This is, in fact, the most common of all ways by\r\nwhich existing lake basins, some of them very large, have been formed.\r\nMost of the thousands of ponds and lakes of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and\r\nnorthern New York belong in this category.\r\n\r\nIn the Adirondack Mountains, for example, most of the lakes, like the\r\nwell-known Lake Placid, Saranac Lakes, Long Lake, and Schroon Lake,\r\nhave their waters ponded by single dams of glacial débris across\r\nvalleys. In some cases a series of such dams blockades a valley\r\nand forms a chain of lakes like the well-known Fulton Chain in the\r\nAdirondacks. Less commonly the lake may have its waters ponded by two\r\nnatural dams of glacial débris, one across a valley at each end of a\r\nlake. A very fine, large scale example of the last-named type is the\r\nfamous Lake George in the southeastern Adirondacks. It is over 30 miles\r\nlong and from 1 to 2-1/2 miles wide. It lies in the bottom of a deep,\r\nnarrow mountain valley, mountain sides rising very steeply from a few\r\nhundred feet to 2,000 or more feet above its shores. There are many\r\nislands, especially in the so-called \"Narrows,\" thus greatly enhancing\r\nthe scenic effect. The valley itself has been produced by a combination\r\nof faulting and erosion. There was a preglacial stream divide at the\r\npresent location of the \"Narrows.\" This divide was somewhat reduced by\r\nice erosion when the deep, narrow body of ice plowed its way through\r\nthe valley during the Ice Age. During the retreat of the ice heavy\r\nmorainic accumulations were left as dams across the valley at each end\r\nof the lake.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable body of water, similar to Lake George in its origin,\r\nis Chautauqua Lake of western New York, famous for its Chautauqua\r\nassemblies. It lies 1,338 feet above sea level, with its northern end\r\nnear the edge of the steep front of the plateau overlooking Lake Erie.\r\nChautauqua Lake really consists of parts of two valleys, one sloping\r\nnorth and the other sloping south, each dammed by glacial deposits.\r\n\r\nThe famous Alpine lakes--Garda, Como, and Maggiore--have resulted from\r\ndeposition of glacial morainic materials under conditions different\r\nfrom those above described. In these cases great mountain or valley\r\nglaciers once flowed down the valleys and spread out part way upon the\r\nItalian plain. Great accumulations of glacial débris took place around\r\nthe borders of the glacier lobes, and, after retreat of the ice, the\r\nglacial deposits acted as dams ponding the waters far back into the\r\nmountain valleys.\r\n\r\nThe origin and history of the Great Lakes constitutes one of the most\r\ninteresting and remarkable chapters in the recent geological history of\r\nNorth America. Most of the salient points have been well worked out and\r\nthey may be very briefly summarized, as follows: Before the Ice Age the\r\nGreat Lakes did not exist, because the region, prior to that time, had\r\nbeen land subjected to erosion for millions of years--a time altogether\r\ntoo long for any lake to survive. Their sites were occupied by broad,\r\nlow, stream-cut valleys which were quite certainly locally somewhat\r\ndeepened by ice erosion during the Ice Age. Ice erosion is, however,\r\naltogether insufficient to account for the great closed basins.\r\nThe two most important factors entering into the formation of the\r\nbasins of the Great Lakes were doubtless the great glacial (morainic)\r\naccumulations acting as dams along the south side, and the tilting\r\nof the land downward on the north side of the region. In support of\r\nthis explanation it has been established that the great dumping ground\r\nof ice-transported materials from the north was in general along the\r\nsouthern side of the Great Lakes and southward. It has also been well\r\nestablished that, late in the Ice Age, the land on the southern side\r\nof the Great Lakes region was lower than at present, as proved by the\r\ntilted character of beaches of the well-known extinct glacial lakes\r\nwhich were the ancestors of the present lakes. Such a down-warp of the\r\nland must have helped to form the closed basins by tending to stop the\r\nsouthward and southwestward drainage of the region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Sketch map showing a very early stage in the\r\nhistory of the Great Lakes when two relatively small lakes in front of\r\nthe ice wall separately drained into the Mississippi River. (Drawn by\r\nthe author from map by Taylor & Leverett.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--Lake Whittlesey stage of the Great Lakes\r\nhistory when the ice had retreated far enough to allow the eastern and\r\nwestern ice margin waters to join with a single outlet past Chicago.\r\n(Drawn by the author from a map by Taylor & Leverett.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.--The Algonquin-Iroquois stage of the Great\r\nLakes when their whole area was ice-free, and all their waters drained\r\nthrough the Mohawk-Hudson Valleys of New York into the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n(After Taylor, published by New York State Museum.)]\r\n\r\nWe shall now very briefly trace out the principal stages in the\r\nhistory of the Great Lakes during the final retreat of the vast ice\r\nsheet. This may best be done by the aid of maps which need only brief\r\nexplanation. When the ice sheet had retreated far enough northward to\r\nuncover the very southern end of the Lake Michigan basin and a little\r\nbeyond, a small glacial lake (Lake Chicago) developed against the ice\r\nwall. Its outlet was through the Illinois River and thence into the\r\nMississippi. At the same time a larger glacial lake, held up by the ice\r\nwall, developed over the western part of the Erie basin and beyond.\r\nIts outlet was through the Wabash River. With further retreat of the\r\nice a large lake (Whittlesey) covering considerably more than the area\r\nof Lake Erie developed, with outlet westward across Michigan into the\r\nenlarged Lake Chicago which continued to drain into the Illinois River.\r\nDuring a still later stage of ice withdrawal the remarkable set of\r\nthree glacial lakes existed--Lakes Duluth, Chicago, and Lundy. Each of\r\nthese large lakes had its own outlet. Lake Duluth covered about half\r\nof the Lake Superior basin and drained through the St. Croix River\r\ninto the Mississippi. Lake Chicago expanded to cover nearly all of the\r\nMichigan basin and continued to drain through the Illinois River. Lake\r\nLundy covered not only more than the area of the Erie basin, but also\r\nconsiderable territory north of Detroit, and drained eastward alongside\r\nthe ice lobe of the Ontario basin through the Mohawk and Hudson\r\nvalleys of New York, and into the Atlantic Ocean. Just after the ice\r\ncompletely withdrew from the area now occupied by the Great Lakes, but\r\nstill blocked the St. Lawrence Valley, the vast body of water called\r\nLake Algonquin more than covered the sites of the present Superior,\r\nMichigan, and Huron. At this time the land was distinctly lower toward\r\nthe northeast than at present, causing the outlets to the west to\r\nbe abandoned. The great Lake Algonquin poured its waters eastward\r\nthrough the Trent River channel of Ontario, Canada, into glacial Lake\r\nIroquois, which was the great ancestor of Lake Ontario. Lake Iroquois,\r\nin turn, had its outlet eastward through the Mohawk and Hudson Valleys\r\nof New York. For part of the time at least, Lake Erie maintained a\r\nseparate existence discharging into Lake Iroquois near Buffalo. During\r\nthe Algonquin-Iroquois stage the combined area of all the lakes was\r\nnotably greater than the present area of the Great Lakes. The volume\r\nof water discharged by the lakes through the Mohawk Valley of New York\r\nwas doubtless greater than that which now goes over Niagara Falls.\r\nGradually, as the St. Lawrence ice lobe waned, the outlet waters of the\r\nlakes began to move alongside the ice through the St. Lawrence Valley.\r\nFinally the ice withdrew far enough to free the St. Lawrence Valley and\r\nthe waters of the Great Lakes region dropped to a still lower level,\r\nbringing about the Nipissing Great Lakes stage not greatly different\r\nfrom the present. East and northeast of the Lakes the land was low\r\nenough to allow tidewater (the so-called Champlain Sea) to extend\r\nthrough the Hudson, Champlain, and St. Lawrence Valleys, and possibly\r\ninto the Ontario basin, as proved by the occurrence of marine beaches\r\nand fossils. The waters in the Erie and Ontario basins covered about\r\nthe present areas, while the Nipissing Lakes, which covered a little\r\nmore than the present areas of the three upper Great Lakes, had their\r\noutlet through the Ottawa River channel into tidewater (Champlain\r\nSea). Postglacial warping of the land has brought the whole region to\r\nthe present condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Map showing next to the present stage of the\r\nGreat Lakes history when the land was lower on the north and the upper\r\n(Nipissing) lakes drained through the Ottawa River Valley into an arm\r\nof the sea (Champlain Sea) which reached through the Champlain and\r\nHudson Valleys. (After Taylor, published by New York State Museum.)]\r\n\r\nMany lakes, including some remarkable ones, occupy basins which are\r\ndirectly due to movements of the earth's crust--either faulting or\r\nwarping. An example of a lake occupying part of a fault basin is the\r\nfamous Dead Sea of Palestine. This lake lies in the lowest part of the\r\nJordan Valley, which has geologically recently come into existence\r\nby the sinking of a long, narrow block of earth for several thousand\r\nfeet between two great earth fractures (faults). The Dead Sea covers\r\nabout 500 square miles and its surface lies about 1,300 feet below\r\nsea level, which makes it the lowest lake in the world. Almost equally\r\nremarkable is the fact that its depth is about 1,300 feet, so that the\r\nlowest part of the lake basin is 2,600 feet below sea level. The lake\r\ncontains approximately 24 per cent salt, mostly common table salt,\r\ncausing it to be a thick brine in which there is neither plant nor\r\nanimal life--hence the name \"Dead Sea.\" At one time, probably just\r\nafter the Ice Age, the lake was much larger and deeper, when it filled\r\na considerable part of the Jordan Valley and had an outlet to the\r\nsouth. During the high-level stage the water was fresh, but gradually,\r\nas the climate became drier, evaporation was greater than intake,\r\nthe outlet was abandoned, and the mineral matter (mostly chloride of\r\nmagnesia and common table salt) carried by the streams in solution\r\ninto the shrinking lake steadily accumulated until the high degree of\r\nsalinity of the present time has been reached.\r\n\r\nGreat Salt Lake, Utah, is a remarkable lake whose history has been\r\ncarefully studied. It occupies the lowest position of an extensive\r\nbasin which, in turn, forms but part of the whole great district of\r\nUtah which has geologically recently sunk thousands of feet on the\r\nwest side of the great fault already described as occurring along the\r\nwestern base of the Wasatch Mountains. At present the lake covers\r\nabout 2,000 square miles, but its area fluctuates considerably. It is\r\nscarcely believable that this big lake has an average depth of only\r\nfifteen feet and a maximum depth of only fifty feet. It lies 4,200 feet\r\nabove sea level, and it carries about 18 per cent salts in solution.\r\nMost abundant by far is common table salt, of which there are no less\r\nthan 5,000,000,000 tons in solution. The waters also contain about\r\n900,000,000 tons of other salts. Should the lake completely disappear\r\nby evaporation, these salts would be deposited. Allowing for cars 40\r\nfeet long and of 40 tons capacity, a train more than 1,000,000 miles\r\nlong would be required to carry the salts. What has been the source of\r\nthese salts? Great Salt Lake is not, as supposed by some, a remnant\r\nof an ocean once covering the region. Briefly, the explanation is as\r\nfollows: At one time, when the climate was moister, the basin now only\r\nin part occupied by the lake was filled to overflowing with an outlet\r\nnorth into the Snake and Columbia rivers. That great body of water\r\n(called \"Lake Bonneville\") covered nearly 20,000 square miles and its\r\ndepth was about 1,000 feet deeper than now, the present depth being\r\nvery small. Because it had an outlet that lake was, of course, fresh.\r\nBeaches and shore lines 1,000 feet above the present lake, and at\r\nvarious lower levels, are still wonderfully well preserved. When, due\r\nto climatic change, evaporation exceeded intake by streams, the outlet\r\nwas cut off. But slowly, as the lake shrank, streams (especially the\r\nJordan River) carried a little salt in solution, the percentage of salt\r\nincreasing until the present stage has been reached. In a real sense,\r\nmuch of the salt was once in the sea, because it has been dissolved out\r\nof strata which accumulated under sea water long before the basin of\r\nGreat Salt Lake came into existence.\r\n\r\nAnother famous lake, which also occupies part of a basin due to\r\nfaulting, is Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, near Truckee,\r\nCalifornia. This lake, whose length is 21 miles, and width 12 miles,\r\nlies 6,225 feet above sea level. On almost all sides steep mountains\r\nrise several thousand feet above its waters. Its great depth of\r\n1,635 feet makes it, so far as known, the second deepest lake in\r\nNorth America, Crater Lake, Oregon, only outranking it. The water\r\nis exceedingly clear. An experiment some years ago showed that a\r\nwhite disk eight inches in diameter could actually be seen through\r\na thickness of 216 feet of its water. \"The statement sometimes made\r\nthat 'Tahoe is an old volcanic crater' is not true. The region about\r\nthe lake shows evidences of volcanic activity of various kinds, and\r\nthe lake waters themselves have probably been dammed at times by\r\noutpourings of lava. A lava flow appears to have temporarily filled\r\nthe outlet channel below Tahoe City. The lake, however, lies in a\r\nstructural depression--a dropped (fault) block in the earth's crust.\"\r\n(U. S. Geological Survey.)\r\n\r\nThe basin of the largest lake in the world--the Caspian Sea--has\r\nresulted from warping of the earth's crust. It has an area of 170,000\r\nsquare miles, a maximum depth of 3,200 feet, and its surface is about\r\n90 feet below sea level. The composition of its water and some of its\r\nanimal life indicate that it was once an arm of the sea. It has been\r\ndetached or cut off by an upwarp of the land between it and the Black\r\nSea region. If this great lake is a cut-off arm of the sea, with no\r\noutlet, how do we explain the fact that its salinity is much less than\r\nthat of the ocean? Toward the north, where it is shallow and fed by so\r\nmuch river water, it is, in fact, almost fresh water. Even the southern\r\none-half carries not over 1 per cent of salt. The explanation is that\r\na steady current passes through a narrow passageway into a gulf or bay\r\non its eastern side where evaporation is much greater than over the\r\ngeneral surface of the Caspian. The salt is, therefore, gradually\r\naccumulating at the estimated rate of 350,000 tons per day in this\r\ngulf, while the sea itself is becoming fresher.\r\n\r\nThe basin of Lake Champlain, about 100 miles long, was occupied by\r\ntidewater geologically very recently (that is, since the Ice Age),\r\nbut it has been cut off by uplift of the land on the north, since\r\nwhich time the waters of the lake have been completely rinsed out and\r\nfreshened.\r\n\r\nMany lake basins directly result from volcanic action. In many parts of\r\nthe world lakes, usually of small size, occupy craters of volcanoes as,\r\nfor example, in the Eifel region of Germany, the Auvergne district of\r\nFrance, and near Rome and Naples in Italy. Such a lake of exceptional\r\ninterest fills part of the great crater, several thousand feet deep,\r\nwhich resulted from the explosion of Mt. Katmai, Alaska, in 1912. The\r\nwater of this lake, more than a mile wide and of unknown depth, is hot.\r\n\r\nOne of the most unique and beautiful lakes of the world is Crater Lake\r\nin the Cascade Mountains of southern Oregon. It partly fills a great,\r\nnearly circular hole, six miles in diameter, with a maximum depth of\r\nabout 4,000 feet, in the top of a mountain (Plate 11). The lake is\r\nover five miles in diameter and nearly 2,000 feet deep, making it the\r\ndeepest in North America. Its surface is about 6,200 feet above sea\r\nlevel. Precipitous rock walls rising 500 to 2,000 feet completely\r\nencircle the lake, the main body of whose water is of a marvelous\r\ndeep, sapphire-blue color, while the shallow portions around some of\r\nthe shore are of emerald-green. Crater Lake has very little intake\r\nexcept direct rainfall and snowfall, and its water is fresh. The great\r\nhole was not produced by an explosion like that of Katmai, but rather\r\nby the sinking of the top of a once much greater mountain. That the\r\nmountain was once about the size and shape of Mt. Shasta is proved\r\nby the fact that deep glaciated valleys lead up the slopes and end\r\nabruptly at the very rim of the present mountain. Obviously these\r\nvalleys were scoured out in recent geologic time by glaciers whose\r\nsources were several thousand feet up on a former cone-shaped mountain.\r\nThat the mountain top sank rather than exploded is proved by the\r\nabsence of volcanic débris over the sides and base of the mountain.\r\n\r\nStill another way by which lakes are formed by volcanic action is\r\nby streams of lava blocking valleys. The famous Sea of Galilee in\r\nPalestine was thus formed by a stream of lava, which geologically\r\nrecently flowed down from the east into the Jordan Valley and across\r\nit, where it cooled to form a dam ponding the waters of the Jordan\r\nRiver. Because the river flows through the lake, its water is fresh.\r\nOne of the most remarkable facts about this lake is that its surface\r\nlies nearly 700 feet below sea level. A number of lava-dam lakes are\r\nknown in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountains.\r\n\r\nA very interesting case of a lake basin, formed by cutting off an arm\r\nof the sea without any movement of the earth's crust, is the Salton\r\nSink of southern California. This basin, many miles long and wide, lies\r\nbelow sea level, its lowest point being 287 feet below tide. The Gulf\r\nof California formerly reached much farther north and into California\r\nwhere it covered the site of the Salton Sink. Gradually the Colorado\r\nRiver, always loaded with sediment, built a broad delta deposit right\r\nacross the gulf, the northern end of which thus became cut off,\r\nleaving a big salt lake. But the river flowed into the gulf, while in\r\nthe dry climate the evaporation was great enough to gradually dry away\r\nthe salt lake. This was the condition of things until 1904, when much\r\nof the river at a time of flood got out of control and, following the\r\ngeneral course of a great irrigating canal, it flowed for several years\r\ninto the lowest part of the Salton Sink, partly filling it to form a\r\nlake 45 miles long, 17 miles wide, and 83 feet deep. Since 1907 the\r\nlake has been notably decreasing in size, and it may entirely disappear.\r\n\r\nOther ways by which lakes, mostly relatively small ones, may develop\r\nare by landslides blocking valley drainages; by streams cutting across\r\nwinding curves leaving so-called \"oxbow lakes\" which are common, for\r\nexample, along the lower Mississippi River; by wave and wind action\r\nalong shores of lakes or sea; by filling so-called \"sink holes\" which\r\nresult from dissolving or falling in of roofs of caves; and by beavers\r\nthrough whose industry dams are built across valleys or streams.\r\n\r\nSome of the most common ways by which lakes may be destroyed are the\r\nfollowing: by being filled with sediment carried in by streams, or by\r\nvegetation, or by both; by cutting down outlets; by evaporation due\r\nto a change in climate; by removal of the ice dam in certain types of\r\nglacial lakes; and by movements or warping of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHOW THE EARTH MAY HAVE ORIGINATED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of the origin of the earth is essentially astronomical\r\nrather than geological, because geological history is considered to\r\nhave begun when common earth processes, such as erosion, deposition,\r\nand transportation of sediments, etc., were brought into play. It\r\nis quite certain, however, that the earth in its pregeologic state\r\ngradually merged into its geological condition. For this reason the\r\ngeologist is interested in the more important doctrines or hypotheses\r\nwhich have been put forth to account for the origin of the earth.\r\nIn fact, one of the few hypotheses which must be taken seriously is\r\nlargely the work of a geologist. The most acceptable hypothesis not\r\nonly best satisfies the facts regarding the earth's astronomical\r\nrelationships, but also best harmonizes with our knowledge of the\r\noldest known rocks and their history.\r\n\r\nSince the problem of the origin of the earth is an essential part of\r\nthe problem of the origin of the solar system, the following well-known\r\nfacts should be clearly in the mind of the reader. Eight planets,\r\nincluding the earth, revolve in nearly circular paths around the\r\ncentral sun, whose diameter is 866,000 miles. The radius of the solar\r\nsystem is at least 2,800,000,000 miles, this being the distance of\r\nthe outermost known planet (Neptune) from the Sun. Neptune requires\r\n164 years for a trip around the sun, while the earth, which averages\r\nabout 93,000,000 miles from the sun, makes its circuit once a year. The\r\nplanets all revolve around the sun in the same direction, and in nearly\r\nthe same plane. The sun and all eight planets rotate on their axes\r\nin the same direction, the earth's rotation being accomplished every\r\ntwenty-four hours. Most of the planets have one or more smaller bodies\r\ncalled satellites revolving about them, such as Earth, with its one\r\nsatellite (the moon), and Saturn, with its eight satellites, etc. It is\r\nwell known that this solar system is only a very small part of the vast\r\nuniverse, as shown by the facts that no star is nearer the earth than\r\nseveral trillion miles, and that some stars are so far away that light\r\ntraveling at the rate of 186,000 miles per second requires a thousand\r\nyears to reach the earth!\r\n\r\nToward the end of the eighteenth century the famous nebular or ring\r\nhypothesis was set forth by the astronomer named Laplace. This assumes\r\nan original very hot incandescent mass of gas spheroidal in shape and\r\ngreater in diameter than the present solar system. This mass rotated\r\nin the direction of rotation of our sun and its planets. Loss of heat\r\nby radiation caused the mass to shrink, and this in turn not only made\r\nit rotate faster, but also caused the centrifugal force (i.e., the\r\nforce whose direction was from the center) in its equatorial portion\r\nto gradually become stronger. Finally a time came when the force of\r\ngravity (i.e., the force whose direction was toward the center) and the\r\ncentrifugal force became equal and a ring was left (not thrown) off,\r\nwhile the rest of the mass of gas continued to shrink. After a time the\r\nmaterial of the ring collected to form the outermost planet. The other\r\nplanets were similarly formed from other rings which were left off as\r\ncontraction of the great mass of gas went on. The sun represents the\r\nremainder of the great mass of rotating gas.\r\n\r\nWhat is the bearing of this nebular hypothesis upon the early\r\ngeological history of the earth? According to the hypothesis the earth\r\nmust once have been much more highly heated and larger than now. It\r\ncondensed to a liquid and then it cooled enough to permit the formation\r\nof a solid crust over a liquid interior. It then had a hot dense\r\natmosphere containing all the water of the earth in the form of vapor,\r\nand this atmosphere steadily became thinner due to absorption by the\r\nearth. When the pressure and temperature conditions became favorable,\r\nmuch of the water vapor condensed to form the ocean and the atmosphere\r\ngradually changed to its present condition. According to this view the\r\noldest rocks of the earth must have been igneous because they resulted\r\nfrom the solidification of the outer part of the molten globe.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years certain serious objections to the nebular\r\nhypothesis have been raised, and Chamberlin and Moulton have formulated\r\nthe planetesimal or spiral hypothesis as an attempt at a more rational\r\nexplanation of the origin of the solar system. Some of the objections\r\nto the older doctrine are that among the many thousands of known\r\nnebulæ in the universe very few only are of the Laplacian or ring\r\ntype, while spiral forms are abundant. Spectroscopic study shows\r\nthat the nebulæ are not gaseous, but made up of either liquid or\r\nsolid particles, and that the leaving off of rings would necessitate\r\nthe assumption of an intermittent process which could scarcely have\r\noperated under the conditions of the hypothesis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 9.--(_a_) Molten Lava Flowing Over a Cliff Into\r\nWater in the Hawaiian Islands.

(Modified after Moulton.)]\r\n\r\nAnything like a full understanding of the planetesimal hypothesis\r\nwould be difficult to obtain, and, in the brief space at our disposal,\r\nwe shall attempt to make clear only a few of the salient points.\r\nAccording to this hypothesis the solar system was, during a previous\r\nstage of its evolution, a great, flat, spiral nebula, made up of finely\r\ndivided solid or possibly liquid particles called planetesimals,\r\namong which were scattered some larger \"knots\" or masses. Each tiny\r\nparticle and larger mass or knot is considered to have traveled in\r\nits own particular orbit or path about a central very large mass--the\r\nfuture sun. It is even suggested that the spiral nebula originated by\r\ndisruption of one star by a swift-moving passing star. Each disrupted\r\nparticle and large mass at first started straight for the large passing\r\nstar, but because of change of position of the latter the particles and\r\nlarger masses were gradually pulled around so that their paths curved\r\ninto spirals. Because of crossing of paths, the larger masses or knots\r\ngradually increased in size by accretion of the small particles or\r\nplanetesimals. Meteors (so-called \"shooting stars\") which now strike\r\nthe earth are thought to be disrupted materials still being gathered\r\nin, though very slowly at present. After the passing star got well out\r\nof range, the spiral paths of the disrupted masses gradually changed to\r\nnearly circular, due to a wrapping-up process around the central body\r\n(sun) which then controlled the movements of the both larger masses\r\n(future planets) and small masses (planetesimals).\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire briefly into the bearing of this planetesimal\r\nhypothesis upon the early geological history of the earth. According\r\nto this doctrine the earth was never in the form of a highly heated\r\ngas, nor was it ever necessarily hotter than now. Instead of beginning\r\nas a much larger body which has gradually diminished in size, the\r\nearth steadily grew, up to a certain stage, by ingathering of\r\nplanetesimals. Increase in size caused the force of gravity to increase\r\nand this caused not only steady contraction of the earth's matter,\r\nbut also a development of greater internal heat. The earth has been\r\ngetting smaller ever since the force of compression has predominated\r\nover the building-up process, because of the diminishing supply of\r\nplanetesimals. Due to steadily increasing internal pressure and heat\r\nthe various gases, including water vapor, have been driven out of the\r\nearth to form an atmosphere which has gradually become larger and\r\ndenser. After sufficient accumulation of water vapor, condensation\r\nand rainfall took place; the waters of the earth began to gather to\r\nform the oceans; and the ordinary geologic processes of erosion and\r\ndeposition of strata were initiated. According to this view stratified\r\nrocks could have been formed very early in the history of the earth,\r\nand in this connection it is interesting to note that the oldest known\r\nrocks are actually of sedimentary origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nVERY ANCIENT EARTH HISTORY\r\n\r\n(_Archeozoic and Proterozoic Eras_)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider the older rocks of the Earth, including those\r\nof Archeozoic, Proterozoic, and Paleozoic ages. What are the salient\r\npoints in the very early history of the earth (not including the\r\nevolution of organisms) shown by these very ancient rocks? Beginning\r\nwith the oldest known rocks, it will be our purpose to trace out the\r\nprincipal recorded events of earth history in the regular order of\r\ntheir occurrence. As in human history, so in earth history the recorded\r\nevents of very early times are fewest and most difficult of all to\r\nunderstand. In spite of this difficulty it is best to begin with the\r\noldest known rocks or, as Le Conte has said, \"to follow the natural\r\norder of events. This has the great advantage of bringing out the\r\nphilosophy of the history--the law of evolution.\" Because of limitation\r\nof space we shall give special attention to the physical history of\r\nNorth America, but the general principles brought out apply almost\r\nequally well to the other continents.\r\n\r\nThe Archeozoic rocks contain the earliest known records of geological\r\nhistory, or, in other words, the oldest recorded ordinary geological\r\nprocesses such as weathering and erosion, deposition of strata,\r\nigneous activity, etc. Although we are here dealing with the most\r\nobscure records of any great rock system, partly because the rocks\r\nhave been so profoundly altered (metamorphosed), and partly because of\r\nthe absence of anything like definitely determinable fossils, it is,\r\nnevertheless, true that certain very important conclusions have been\r\nreached regarding this very ancient geological era.\r\n\r\nAmong the very oldest of all known rocks of North America are the\r\nGrenville strata, so named from a town in the St. Lawrence Valley.\r\nIn fact, no rocks elsewhere in the world have been proved to be more\r\nancient. The Grenville series consists of a great mass of sediments\r\n(strata)--original muds, sands, and limes--which were deposited layer\r\nupon layer under water (Plate 12). The widespread extent and character\r\nof the series in southeastern Canada and the Adirondacks, and more than\r\nlikely far beyond these limits, make it certain that the Grenville\r\nstrata were accumulated on the bottom of a relatively shallow sea very\r\nmuch as sediments are now piling up on shallow sea bottoms. Thus,\r\nthe most ancient definitely known condition of the region where the\r\nGrenville strata are exposed was an expanse of the sea covering the\r\nwhole area. Wherever, in other parts of the world, the Archeozoic rocks\r\nhave been studied, stratified rocks also seem to be the very oldest\r\nwhich are recognizable, but up to the present time no such rocks have\r\nbeen proved to be any older than, or even as old as, the Grenville\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nIt may occur to the reader to ask, how long ago did the Grenville\r\nocean exist? There are grave difficulties in the way of answering\r\nthis question in terms of years since we have nothing like an exact\r\nstandard for such a measurement or comparison. Although we must concede\r\nthat not even approximate figures can be given, it can, nevertheless,\r\nbe demonstrated by several independent lines of reasoning that the\r\ntime must be measured by at least tens of millions of years, a very\r\nconservative estimate of the minimum time which must be allowed\r\nbeing about 50 million years. In any case, the time is so utterly\r\ninconceivable to us that the important thing to bear in mind is that\r\nthe great well-known events of earth history, which have transpired\r\nsince the existence of the Grenville ocean, require a lapse of many\r\nmillions of years, as shown by revolutionary changes in geographic and\r\ngeologic conditions such as the long periods of erosion, the enormous\r\naccumulations of sediment, the repeated spreading out and disappearance\r\nof sea water over many portions of the earth, and the building up and\r\ntearing down of great mountain ranges at various times. The ideas here\r\nexpressed will be much better appreciated by the reader after following\r\nthrough the salient points in the history of North America as set forth\r\nin the succeeding pages.\r\n\r\nAgain, the reader may ask, by what line of reasoning do we conclude\r\nthat these stratified rocks are so exceedingly ancient? All rocks of\r\nArcheozoic Age, including strata as well as certain younger igneous\r\nrocks (see below), invariably occupy a basal position in relation to\r\nall other rock systems. They constitute a complex lot of crystalline\r\nmetamorphic rocks, combining certain characteristics which lie below\r\nthe base of the determined sedimentary succession. Where rocks with\r\nthe characteristics of the Archeozoic are separated from the oldest\r\nPaleozoic (Cambrian) strata by the great sedimentary or metamorphic\r\nsystem known as the Proterozoic (see below), we may be sure that we\r\nare dealing with Archeozoic rocks. If the series of rocks in question\r\nbelongs in the Archeozoic system, all that remains is to determine its\r\nage position in that system. This can usually readily be done because\r\nwherever they have been studied the Archeozoic rocks may be subdivided\r\ninto two groups of rocks, a sedimentary and an igneous. Where the\r\nigneous rocks, mainly granites and related types, occur associated with\r\nthe sedimentary rocks (e.g., Grenville), they very clearly were forced\r\nor intruded, while molten, into the sedimentary rocks, thus proving\r\nthese latter to be the older.\r\n\r\nSince the Archeozoic strata of the Adirondack Mountains, southeastern\r\nCanada, and also all, or nearly all, other known districts are mostly\r\nbadly disturbed, tilted, and more or less bent or folded, and since\r\nneither top nor bottom of the piles of strata has ever been recognized\r\nas such, it is impossible to give anything like an exact figure for\r\nthe thickness of the series. Continuous successions of strata have,\r\nhowever, been observed in enough places to show that they were commonly\r\ndeposited layer upon layer to a thickness of at least some tens of\r\nthousands of feet. A thickness of over 100,000 feet has been reported\r\nfrom southeastern Canada. The clear implication is that the Archeozoic\r\nsea which received sediments must have existed for a vast length of\r\ntime which must be measured by at least some millions of years, because\r\nin the light of all our knowledge regarding the rate of accumulation\r\nof sediments a very long time was necessary for the piling up of such\r\nthick masses of strata. It does not, however, necessarily follow that\r\nthe Grenville ocean was many thousands of feet deep where deposition\r\ntook place. In fact, the very character of the original sediments\r\n(muds, sands, and limes) clearly indicates that the Archeozoic sea in\r\nwhich they accumulated was, for most part at least, of shallow water\r\nbecause such sediments have rarely, if ever, been carried out into\r\nan ocean of deep water. The great ocean abysses of to-day are not\r\nreceiving any appreciable amount of land-derived sediment. Thus we are\r\nforced to conclude that in Archeozoic time, as well as many times in\r\nlater ages, the shallow sea bottom gradually sank while the sediments\r\naccumulated. Even more conclusive proof of such subsidence has been\r\nobtained from the study of so-called \"folded\" mountain ranges of\r\nPaleozoic and later time, an excellent example being the Appalachian\r\nRange.\r\n\r\nHaving established the sedimentary origin and great antiquity of\r\nthe Grenville series, we are led to the interesting and important\r\nconclusion that these oldest known rocks are not the most ancient\r\nwhich ever existed, because the Grenville strata must have been\r\ndeposited layer upon layer, upon a floor of still older rocks. If such\r\nstill older rocks are anywhere exposed to view, they have never been\r\nrecognized as such. Again, the fact that the most ancient known rocks\r\nwere deposited under water carries with it the corollary that there\r\nmust have been lands at no great distances from the areas of deposition\r\nbecause, then as now, such sediments as muds and sands could have been\r\nderived only from the wear or erosion of lands, and have been deposited\r\nin layers under water adjacent to those lands. But we are utterly in\r\nthe dark regarding any knowledge of the location or character of such\r\nvery ancient lands.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient known strata, as we see them to-day, do not look like\r\nordinary sediments such as shales, sandstones, and limestones. They\r\nhave been profoundly changed from their original condition, that is\r\nto say, they have undergone metamorphism. The Archeozoic strata now\r\nexposed to view were formerly buried at least some miles below the\r\nearth's surface, the overlying younger rocks having since been removed\r\nby erosion through the millions of years of time. Far below the earth's\r\nsurface, under conditions of relatively high temperature, pressure, and\r\nmoisture, the materials of the strata were completely crystallized into\r\nvarious minerals. The surfaces of separation of the very ancient layers\r\nof sediment are still usually more or less clearly present (Plate 12).\r\nOriginal limestone has been changed into crystalline limestone or\r\nmarble; sandstone has been changed into quartzite, and shale, sandy\r\nshale, and shaly sandstone have been changed into various schists and\r\ngneisses.\r\n\r\nIn western Ontario there are also stratified rocks (called the Keewatin\r\nseries) which seem to be of about the same age as the Grenville strata\r\nfarther east. A point of special interest in connection with the\r\nKeewatin strata is the presence of layers of lava in portions of the\r\nseries, thus proving that molten rock materials were poured out on\r\nthe earth's surface during the most ancient known era of the earth's\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAfter the accumulation of the very ancient Archeozoic sediments igneous\r\nactivity took place on grand scales when great masses of molten rock\r\nwere forced (intruded) into the sediments from below. Masses of molten\r\nmaterials are known to have been thus intruded at several different\r\ntimes, but of these the most common by far cooled to form a great\r\nseries of granite and closely related rocks. The general effect was\r\nto break the old strata up into patches or masses of varying sizes as\r\nclearly shown by the present distribution and modes of occurrence of\r\nthese igneous rocks. In most cases the strata were pushed aside by,\r\nor tilted or domed over, the upwelling molten floods--in many cases\r\nthe molten materials were, under great pressure, intimately forced or\r\ninjected into the strata; numerous large and small masses of strata\r\nwere caught up or enveloped (as inclusions) in the molten floods; in\r\nsome cases there was local digestion or assimilation of the strata\r\nby the molten materials, while in still other places large bodies of\r\nstrata seem to have been left practically intact and undisturbed. Such\r\nigneous rocks, which are very widespread, are all of the plutonic or\r\ndeep-seated types; that is, they were never forced up to the earth's\r\nsurface like lavas, but they solidified at considerable depths (at\r\nleast some thousands of feet) below the surface. We see them exposed\r\nto-day only because a tremendous amount of overlying rock materials\r\nhas been removed by erosion. These igneous rocks are generally easily\r\ndistinguished from the old sediments of Grenville age because of their\r\nmore general homogeneity in large masses, and their lack of sharply\r\ndefined bands or layers of varying composition. The fact that the\r\nminerals have always crystallized to form medium to coarse-grained\r\nrocks shows that these rocks solidified under deep-seated conditions,\r\nsince it is well known that surface flows (lavas) are much finer\r\ngrained commonly with more or less of the rock not crystallized\r\nat all. Slow cooling under great pressure favors more complete\r\ncrystallization with growth of larger crystals.\r\n\r\nAs we have just learned, the very character and structure of the\r\nArcheozoic rocks now exposed to view show conclusively that they were\r\nformerly deeply buried, and the inference is perfectly plain that the\r\noverlying rock materials were removed by erosion. Profound erosion of\r\nany land mass means that the land must have stood well above sea level,\r\nand thus we come to the important conclusion that the great mass of\r\nArcheozoic rocks (both strata and igneous rocks) were upraised well\r\nabove sea level. Just when the uplift occurred cannot be positively\r\nstated, but in every region where the matter has been studied it took\r\nplace before the strata of the next geological era began to deposit\r\nas shown by the fact that such later strata rest upon the profoundly\r\neroded surface of the Archeozoic rocks. Such an erosion surface, called\r\nan \"unconformity,\" marks a gap in the geological record of the district\r\nwhere it occurs. There is much to support the view that the uplift\r\nwas concomitant with the great igneous intrusions, especially the\r\ngranite. It is reasonable to believe that the same great force which\r\ncaused the welling up of such tremendous bodies of liquid rock into\r\nthe earth's crust might easily have caused a decided uplift of a whole\r\nlarge region, but even so the process must have been geologically slow.\r\nIn regard to the height of those ancient lands, the character of the\r\ntopography, and the drainage lines we are as yet utterly in the dark.\r\nThe fact that many thousands of feet in thickness of materials were\r\nremoved by erosion to expose the once deeply buried rocks, does not\r\nnecessarily imply that the lands at any time had great height, because\r\nit is possible that while elevation slowly progressed, much material\r\nwas steadily removed by erosion. In the light of our knowledge of the\r\norigin and growth of mountain ranges of later time there is little\r\ndoubt that at least some of the Archeozoic lands were raised to such\r\nmountain heights.\r\n\r\nThus far in our study of the Archeozoic rocks attention has been\r\nmainly directed to southeastern Canada and the Adirondack mountains,\r\nwhere careful studies have been made. In all parts of the world\r\nwhere the most ancient known (Archeozoic) rocks have been studied in\r\ndetail the same general principles apply. Particular attention has\r\nbeen given to the Archeozoic rocks south of Lake Superior, and in the\r\nPiedmont Plateau of the eastern United States. In the accompanying\r\nmap Archeozoic rocks are widely exposed to view within the areas\r\nshown in black. It has been estimated that Archeozoic rocks appear\r\nat the surface over about one-fifth of the land area of the earth.\r\nWhere they are not at the surface it is believed that they everywhere\r\nexist under cover of later rocks. In other words, Archeozoic rocks are\r\nconsidered to be almost universally present either at or under the\r\nearth's surface. This is true of the rocks of no other age. Special\r\nmention should be made of the fine exhibitions of Archeozoic rocks in\r\nScandinavia and the Highlands of Scotland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Map showing the surface distribution of\r\nArcheozoic and Proterozoic rocks in North America. (Redrawn by the\r\nauthor after U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nAll known evidence leads us to the remarkable conclusion that\r\nthe climate of much, or possibly all, of Archeozoic time was not\r\nfundamentally different from that of to-day. There must have been\r\nweathering of rocks, rainfall, and streams much as at present as\r\nproved by the character and composition of the stratified rocks which\r\nformed in that remote era. The presence of graphite (\"black lead\") in\r\ncrystalline flakes scattered through many of the strata shows that the\r\nclimate must have been favorable to some form of life, because graphite\r\nthus occurring quite certainly represents the remains of organisms,\r\nthis matter being more fully discussed in a succeeding chapter. In\r\npassing it may be stated that climatic zones were then probably\r\nscarcely if at all marked off, as they quite certainly were not even\r\nduring Paleozoic time. One of the great contributions of geology to\r\nhuman knowledge is that during the tens of millions of years from\r\nArcheozoic times to the present the earth's climate has undergone no\r\nfundamental change or evolution. In the earlier ages there was greater\r\nuniformity of climate over the earth, and, during known geologic\r\ntime there have been rather localized relatively minor fluctuations\r\ngiving rise to glaciers, deserts, etc., but there has been no real\r\nevolution of climate at all comparable to the marvelous evolution of\r\norganisms--both animals and plants.\r\n\r\nWe shall now turn our attention briefly to a consideration of the\r\nsecond great subdivision of geologic time--the Proterozoic era. Rocks\r\nof Proterozoic Age comprise all of those which were formed after the\r\nArcheozoic rocks and before the deposition of the earliest Paleozoic\r\n(Cambrian) strata, these latter being rather definitely recognizable\r\nbecause they contain fossils characteristic of the time. Cambrian\r\nstrata are, in fact, the oldest rocks which contain anything like\r\nan abundance of fossils, so that the separation of rocks of either\r\nArcheozoic or Proterozoic Age from the earliest Paleozoic is seldom\r\ndifficult. But how may we separate the Proterozoic rocks from the\r\nArcheozoic? Fossils afford us no aid whatever, because no determinable\r\nfossils have been found in rocks as old even as the earlier\r\nProterozoic. The two great groups of very ancient rocks do, however,\r\nshow a number of differences which must be considered together.\r\nThus, igneous rocks distinctly predominate in the Archeozoic, while\r\nstratified rocks predominate in the Proterozoic. All Archeozoic strata\r\nare thoroughly metamorphosed (changed from their original condition),\r\nwhile large masses of the Proterozoic strata are only moderately\r\nmetamorphosed, or even unaltered, and therefore look much like ordinary\r\nstrata of later ages. Archeozoic rocks have almost invariably been\r\nnotably deformed by more or less folding, tilting, etc., while the\r\nProterozoic rocks show relatively much less deformation. Another\r\nimportant criterion is the fact that the Proterozoic rocks, wherever\r\nthey have been studied in relation to the Archeozoic rocks, always\r\nrest upon a profoundly eroded surface of the latter, that is, an\r\nunconformity separates the two great sets of rocks. This erosion\r\nsurface is of still further interest because it is the very oldest one\r\nknown, none having been recognized within the Archeozoic group itself.\r\nEven where the Proterozoic strata have been considerably metamorphosed\r\nand deformed, this old erosion surface may be recognized, and if the\r\nrocks below that surface possess the characteristics of the Archeozoic\r\nrocks as described above, the two great very ancient rock groups may be\r\ndistinguished. One of the triumphs of geology during the last 25 to 30\r\nyears has been the recognition of the great rock group (Proterozoic)\r\nbetween the Archeozoic and Paleozoic, thus bringing to light the\r\nrecords of an era which lasted many millions of years.\r\n\r\nThe length of time represented by the Proterozoic era is by many\r\nbelieved to have been fully as long as all succeeding eras--Paleozoic,\r\nMesozoic, and Cenozoic--combined. Twenty million years would be a\r\nvery conservative estimate for the duration of the era. What is the\r\nnature of the evidence as recorded in the rocks which lead us to\r\nconclude that the Proterozoic era lasted such a vast length of time?\r\nThe great thickness of Proterozoic strata (over 30,000 feet in the\r\nLake Superior region), in the light of what we have already learned\r\nregarding the present rate of wear (erosion) of lands and deposition\r\nof the eroded materials under ordinary conditions, clearly implies\r\nmillions of years of time for their accumulation. But the Proterozoic\r\nstrata as we now see them are in most places not a continuous pile,\r\nthat is they were not accumulated layer upon layer without notable\r\ninterruption. Thus, the thick Proterozoic group of the Lake Superior\r\nregion has been divided into four distinct, mainly sedimentary series\r\nseparated from each other by erosion surfaces (unconformities). Each\r\nerosion surface represents a long time when the area was elevated and\r\nunderwent profound wear before the next series of strata accumulated on\r\nthe worn surface. That such times of erosion were geologically long is\r\nproved not only by the profound alteration (metamorphism) of one set of\r\nstrata before another accumulated, but also by the fact that granite,\r\nwhich, as we have learned, is never exposed except where much overlying\r\nmaterial has been eroded, actually formed parts of surfaces of earlier\r\nProterozoic rocks upon which later ones were deposited. In the Lake\r\nSuperior region there are not only three great erosion surfaces\r\n(unconformities) within the Proterozoic group, but also one at the base\r\nseparating it as a whole from the Archeozoic group, and another at the\r\ntop separating it from the Paleozoic group. It is, therefore, fair to\r\nconclude that the amount of time (millions of years) represented by\r\nthese great erosion intervals was fully as great as the time needed for\r\ndeposition of the existing Proterozoic strata.\r\n\r\nIn the Lake Superior region the older Proterozoic strata are nearly all\r\nmore or less folded and altered (metamorphosed), and they have been\r\nintruded by considerable bodies of molten rock, mostly granite. The\r\nlater Proterozoic strata have been much less deformed and in many cases\r\nthey are practically unaltered. In this region a very remarkable event\r\ntook place in late Proterozoic time. This was volcanic activity on a\r\ngrand scale. We may gain some idea of the stupendous and long-continued\r\nvolcanic outpourings from the fact that, based upon actual measurements\r\nof thickness, lava sheets, averaging about 100 feet thick, poured out\r\none upon another until a pile about six miles high had accumulated.\r\n\r\nIn parts of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado tilted Proterozoic\r\nstrata may be seen resting upon the profoundly eroded surface of the\r\nArcheozoic rocks of the inner gorge. The Proterozoic strata, 12,000\r\nfeet thick, consist of practically unaltered sandstones, shales, and\r\nlimestones, associated with some layers of basaltic lava. An erosion\r\nsurface (unconformity) separates the whole group into two distinct\r\nseries, and the group is separated from the overlying nearly horizontal\r\nPaleozoic (Cambrian) strata in the walls of the Canyon by another\r\nerosion surface.\r\n\r\nMore recently the Proterozoic strata so finely displayed in the\r\nRocky Mountains of Montana and southern Canada have been studied.\r\nThese strata, at least two or three miles thick, are mostly\r\nunaltered sandstones, shales, and limestones, associated with some\r\nmetamorphic and igneous rocks. As usual, these strata rest upon\r\nthe eroded Archeozoic. They were more or less upturned and folded\r\nbefore deposition of the succeeding Paleozoic strata. Satisfactory\r\nsubdivisions have not yet been worked out.\r\n\r\nIn North America most of the areas shown on the accompanying map\r\ncontain more or less Proterozoic rocks. Rocks of this age are known to\r\nsome extent in all continents where their general relationships seem\r\nto be much like those of North America. They have perhaps been most\r\ncarefully studied in Scandinavia and the Highlands of Scotland, where\r\nthe strata portions are about two miles thick.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Proterozoic time must, for most part, have been about\r\nlike that of to-day except, of course, for its much greater uniformity\r\nover the earth. About a dozen years ago very typical glacial deposits\r\nwere discovered within the early Proterozoic rocks of western Ontario,\r\nCanada. A climatic condition favorable for the development of glaciers\r\nso early in the history of the earth is, to say the least, directly\r\nopposed to an idea (based upon the nebular hypothesis) long held that\r\nthe climate of early geologic time must have been much warmer than that\r\nof the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nANCIENT EARTH HISTORY\r\n\r\n(_Paleozoic Era_)\r\n\r\n\r\nBeginning with the earliest Paleozoic, the legible records of events\r\nof earth history are far more abundant and less defaced than those\r\nof earlier times. Stratified rocks of the ordinary kinds greatly\r\npredominate over the igneous and metamorphic rocks, and the strata\r\nare in general far less disturbed than those of the Archeozoic and\r\nProterozoic groups. From the earliest Paleozoic we have also the first\r\nabundant records (fossils) of the life of the earth, so that the\r\nordinary methods of subdividing and determining the relative ages of\r\nthe Paleozoic and later strata, as well as correlating the subdivisions\r\n(formations) in widely separated regions, can be used. From here on in\r\nour discussion of earth history we shall be able to trace the salient\r\nfeatures of the changing outlines of the face of the earth, the coming\r\nand going of the seas over the lands, and the evolution of animals and\r\nplants with a considerable degree of definiteness and satisfaction.\r\n\r\nFirst, we shall trace out, in the regular order of their occurrence,\r\nthe main physical history events of Paleozoic time, leaving a\r\nconsideration of the evolution of life for other chapters. Because\r\nof limitation of space, our attention will be almost wholly centered\r\nupon the continent of North America, but the reader should bear in\r\nmind that the general principles and facts set forth apply with about\r\nequal force to most other continents. In Europe the wonderful records\r\nof Paleozoic history are found in strata, whose estimated maximum\r\nthickness is about 100,000 feet! It must not be thought, however, that\r\nall these strata are piled up in a single locality, but the figure does\r\nactually represent the sum total of the greatest thickness of the many\r\nsubdivisions (formations) of the Paleozoic rocks in different portions\r\nof the continent. In North America the maximum thickness of all\r\nPaleozoic rocks seems to be no less than 50,000 feet. More than 25,000\r\nfeet of strata may actually be observed piled layer upon layer in the\r\nhighly folded and deeply eroded central Appalachian Mountains. The\r\ngreat thickness of the strata, combined with the facts that the fossils\r\nshow that many marvelous, mostly progressive, changes took place among\r\nliving things, that seas came and went repeatedly over many parts of\r\nthe continent, and that great changes took place in the configuration\r\nof the land, force us to conclude that Paleozoic time must have lasted\r\nfor many millions of years.\r\n\r\nJust before the opening of the Paleozoic era practically all of North\r\nAmerica appears to have been dry land, which had undergone so much\r\nerosion that it was low and far less rugged in relief than at present.\r\nThis we know, because the rather widespread early Paleozoic (Cambrian)\r\nstrata almost everywhere rest upon deeply eroded rocks of either\r\nArcheozoic or Proterozoic age. Considering both the time involved and\r\nthe wide area affected, we have no record of anything like such a\r\nprofound erosion interval since the beginning of the Paleozoic era. It\r\nseems that the constructive or upbuilding forces within the earth were\r\nthen remarkably quiescent, while the destructive forces (erosion) were\r\nalmost unhampered in their work of cutting down the land.\r\n\r\nHave we any definite idea of the relations of land and water in North\r\nAmerica during the first or Cambrian period of the Paleozoic era? In\r\nthe affirmative answer to this question, certain principles will be\r\nbrought out which the reader should keep in mind as we trace out the\r\nsucceeding great physical changes in the history of North America.\r\nIt should, however, be remembered that, in the brief space at our\r\ndisposal, only the most general, or the most significant localized,\r\nphysical changes in the long and intricate known history of the\r\ncontinent since the opening of the Paleozoic era can be brought out.\r\n\r\nIn early Cambrian time a narrow arm of the sea (like a strait) extended\r\nfrom the Gulf of St. Lawrence southward across eastern New York and\r\nover the site of the present Appalachian Mountains connecting with the\r\nGulf of Mexico on the south. On the west, a much larger and broader arm\r\nof the sea (like a mediterranean) extended from Alaska southward over\r\nthe site of the Rocky Mountains of Canada and across the sites of the\r\nColumbia Plateau to Great Basin of the western United States. All the\r\nrest of the continent was land, apparently almost or wholly devoid of\r\nhigh mountains.\r\n\r\nBy what process of reasoning do we conclude that arms of the early\r\nCambrian sea reached across eastern and western North America? First,\r\nwherever marine strata of definitely determined early Cambrian age now\r\noccur, the early Cambrian sea must have existed because those strata\r\nwere obviously deposited in that sea. Second, to those areas we must\r\nadd others from which it can be demonstrated that early Cambrian marine\r\nstrata have been removed by erosion. Enough field work along these\r\nlines has been done in North America to render it practically certain\r\nthat the relations of land and water during early Cambrian time were\r\nessentially as above outlined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Map showing the relations of land and water\r\nin North America during early Cambrian time, at least 25,000,000 years\r\nago. Lined areas represent land.

Lined areas represent\r\nland. (Principal data from a map published by Willis in the Journal of\r\nGeology.)]\r\n\r\nAs Cambrian time went on, the marine waters gradually spread from\r\nsouth to north across most of the Mississippi Valley area, causing the\r\neastern and western arms of the sea to be connected, thus forming an\r\ninterior continental sea. Otherwise the relations of land and water\r\nwere much as in early Cambrian time. We know that the sea transgressed\r\nnorthward across the Mississippi Valley district because, on the\r\nsouth, the whole Cambrian system of strata (lower, middle, and upper)\r\nis present, while, farther north, only middle and upper Cambrian are\r\npresent, and, farthest north, only upper Cambrian strata occur. This\r\nprogressive northward overlap of younger and younger (later) Cambrian\r\nstrata upon the old rock floor proves, that the Cambrian sea steadily\r\nspread farther and farther northward over the Mississippi Valley area.\r\nThat this spreading sea was shallow is amply demonstrated by the\r\ndeposits it left, such as shales, conglomerates (i.e., consolidated\r\ngravels) and sandstones, often ripple-marked. The Cambrian strata of\r\nNorth America vary in thickness from less than 1,000 feet to about\r\n12,000 feet.\r\n\r\nIn the Mississippi Valley the Cambrian strata are unaltered and almost\r\nundisturbed from their original horizontal position. In the Appalachian\r\nMountains of the east, and the Rocky Mountains of the west, the strata\r\nare commonly notably folded and faulted. In some places, as in western\r\nNew England, the strata have been notably altered (metamorphosed).\r\n\r\nThe best estimates for the duration of the Cambrian period range from\r\n2,000,000 to 3,000,000 years. It is a remarkable fact that, during this\r\ngreat lapse of time, North America was unaffected by any great physical\r\ndisturbances such as mountain making, emergence of large tracts of\r\nland, or igneous activity. The one great physical event of the Cambrian\r\nwas the gradual submergence of a considerable portion of the continent.\r\n\r\nThat the climate of the earliest Cambrian was at least locally\r\nfavorable for the existence of glaciers, is proved by the occurrences\r\nof true glacial deposits in rocks of that age in China, Norway, and\r\nAustralia. It is a remarkable fact that the glacial materials of China\r\noccur along the Yangtse River, thus demonstrating that conditions for\r\nglaciers then existed at a latitude as far south as New Orleans. These\r\nevidences of glaciation directly refute the old idea, based upon the\r\nnebular hypothesis, that the climate of the Paleozoic was distinctly\r\nwarmer than now. The glacial evidence, added to our knowledge of the\r\ncharacter and world-wide distribution of many identical species of\r\nanimals, leads us to conclude that early Paleozoic climate was not\r\nessentially different from that of very recent geologic time, but that\r\nthe climate was then much more uniform than at present.\r\n\r\nDuring the second or Ordovician period of the Paleozoic era, the\r\nprogressive submergence of Cambrian time continued until a climax\r\nwas reached toward the middle of the period when fully four-fifths\r\nof the continent was submerged under shallow sea water. Since middle\r\nOrdovician marine strata are more widespread than the rocks of any\r\nsucceeding age, we can be reasonably sure that so much of the continent\r\nwas never again covered by the sea. In fact, so far as the records\r\nhave been interpreted, this came nearest to being a universal flood in\r\nthe whole known history of the continent. By the very character of the\r\nrocks deposited (seldom over a few thousand feet thick), we can be sure\r\nthat the middle Ordovician continental sea was everywhere far shallower\r\nthan the great ocean abysses of to-day. Because the lands were so low\r\nand restricted, relatively little land-derived sediment washed into the\r\nsea. But the shallow sea water was inhabited by millions of animals,\r\nthe shells of many of which slowly accumulated to build up the thick\r\nbodies of limestone strata (Plate 14) which constitute the main bulk of\r\nrock of early and middle Ordovician age. The famous Trenton limestone,\r\nnamed from a locality in central New York, with its great abundance of\r\nfossils, was formed mostly by the accumulation of shells of animals\r\nduring middle Ordovician time.\r\n\r\nLater in the Ordovician there was a considerable shift in level between\r\nland and water causing a withdrawal of much of the widespread sea. As\r\na result of the generally more elevated lands, erosion proceeded more\r\nvigorously, and sands and muds were more abundantly deposited in the\r\nrestricted sea, these sediments having consolidated to form the shales\r\nand sandstones which predominate among the upper Ordovician rocks.\r\n\r\nA principle above briefly explained in the discussion of the Cambrian\r\nmay be reemphasized here. It is as follows: In making a map to show the\r\nrelations of land and water, say during middle Ordovician time, the\r\ngeologist is by no means dependent only upon actual surface exposures\r\nof middle Ordovician strata. Such exposures fall far short of giving an\r\nadequate conception of the former or even present real extent of such\r\nstrata. In many places originally present Ordovician strata have been\r\nremoved by erosion. An excellent case in point is the Adirondack region\r\nof northern New York. On the west side of the Adirondacks a great pile\r\nof marine Ordovician strata 1,500 feet thick end abruptly on the gently\r\nsloping flank of the mountains, thus clearly proving that the strata\r\nformerly extended at least twenty to thirty miles eastward. Again, in\r\nthe southern Adirondacks a small area of very typical marine middle\r\nOrdovician strata lies fully fifteen miles from the general area of\r\nsuch rocks to the south. This small body of rock is very clearly only\r\nan erosion remnant of a general sheet of middle Ordovician rock which\r\nonce covered the whole intervening district. In many other regions\r\nthe middle Ordovician strata are definitely known to be concealed\r\nunder cover of later rocks, as in the Mississippi Valley, where the\r\nactual surface exposures constitute only a fraction of the middle\r\nOrdovician strata which underlie nearly all the valley, as proved by\r\ndeep well drillings, study of the scattering outcrops, etc. In still\r\nother places, middle Ordovician strata, associated with other rocks,\r\nare highly folded, as in the Appalachians, where such strata outcrop\r\nin only narrow belts following the trend of the folds. In short, then,\r\nwherever it can be proved that middle Ordovician marine strata are\r\nvisible at the surface, or are concealed under other rocks, or were\r\nonce present, we can be sure that the middle Ordovician sea existed.\r\nExactly this principle applies to any subdivision of geologic time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--Structure section showing rocks representing\r\nthree geologic eras separated by millions of years of time. Length\r\nof section 12 miles, vertical scale much exaggerated. At the bottom\r\nare Archeozoic (Precambric) rocks and resting upon them on the left\r\nare early Paleozoic strata 1,500 feet thick. A glacial lake deposit\r\nof late Cenozoic age lies on the Archeozoic rock toward the right. It\r\nis evident that the Paleozoic strata formerly extended much farther\r\neastward. (By the author as published in a New York State Museum\r\nBulletin.)]\r\n\r\nThe Ordovician period closed with a great mountain-making disturbance\r\nin eastern North America, and at the same time all, or nearly all, of\r\nthe continent was land. Throughout most of the Cambrian and Ordovician\r\nperiods, the strata accumulated to a thickness of thousands of feet in\r\nthe marine waters which spread over the eastern border of New York,\r\nthe sites of the Green Mountains of Vermont, the Berkshire Hills of\r\nMassachusetts, and southward at least as far as Virginia, over the area\r\nof the Piedmont Plateau. At, or toward the close of the Ordovician\r\nperiod, a great compressive force in the earth's crust was brought to\r\nbear upon the mass of strata and they were tilted, highly folded, and\r\nraised above sea level into a great mountain range known to geologists\r\nas the Taconic Range. It is quite the rule throughout this region of\r\nTaconic disturbance to find the strata either on edge or making high\r\nangles with the plane of the horizon. Many of the folds were actually\r\noverturned, and in some cases notable thrust faults developed, that is,\r\nthe upper strata broke across and great masses were shoved over each\r\nother. These facts all go to show that the mountain-making compressive\r\nforce applied to the region was of rather an extreme type. Since the\r\norigin of the Taconic Range a tremendous amount of erosion has taken\r\nplace, so that literally only the roots of the range are now exposed in\r\nthe Green Mountains, Berkshire Hills, Highlands-of-the-Hudson, and the\r\nnorthern Piedmont Plateau.\r\n\r\nHow do we know that the Taconic disturbance took place toward the close\r\nof the Ordovician period? By way of answer to this question two facts\r\nneed to be considered. First, relatively late (or young) Ordovician\r\nstrata are involved with the folds, thus proving that the folds\r\nformed after those late Ordovician sediments were deposited. Second,\r\nundisturbed strata formed during the middle of the next (Silurian)\r\nperiod, rest upon the eroded edges of the folds, which proves that the\r\nfolds must have developed well before middle Silurian time because the\r\nonly time they were subjected to erosion must have been during early\r\nSilurian time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--Structure section showing profile\r\nand underground relations of the rocks across part of the\r\nHighlands-of-the-Hudson region in southeastern New York. Length of\r\nsection, sixteen miles. The rocks are mostly of Prepaleozoic Age, but\r\nwith belts of highly infolded early Paleozoic strata toward the middle\r\nright. (After Berkey, New York Museum Report.)]\r\n\r\nMention should also be made of the profound metamorphism (alteration)\r\nof the Cambrian and Ordovician strata along the main axis of the range,\r\nwhere the intense compression, aided by heat and moisture, caused the\r\ndeeply buried portions of the strata to become plastic, and hence\r\nthey became more or less foliated (cleavable) and crystallized into\r\nvarious metamorphic rock types, the limestone having changed to marble,\r\nthe shale to slate or schist, and the sandstone to quartzite. Thus\r\nwe explain the rocks of the extensive marble quarries of Vermont and\r\nwestern Massachusetts, the slate quarries of central eastern New York,\r\nand the Berkshire schist of the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nOne of the grandest and most significant of all the profound geological\r\nprocesses is the birth and history of a great folded mountain range.\r\nSince the Taconic Range affords us such an excellent example of a\r\nlarge-scale, well-understood folded range of great antiquity we may do\r\nwell to consider it in the light of certain other broad relationships.\r\nThe great compressive force which folded and upraised the Taconic\r\nMountains did not accomplish its work rapidly in the ordinary human\r\nhistory sense of the word. The force was slowly and irresistibly\r\napplied, and the strata well below the surface were gradually bulged\r\nor folded, or fractured where near the surface, the length of time\r\nrequired for the operation having been, at the very least calculation,\r\nsome hundreds of thousands of years, and more than likely a million\r\nyears or more. Such a length of time is, however, so short compared\r\nwith all known earth history, that we are accustomed to refer to the\r\nformation of such a mountain range as simply an event of geological\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nEven before such a range attains its maximum height a very considerable\r\namount of erosion has already taken place. When the first fold appears\r\nabove sea level, erosion begins its work and continues with increasing\r\nvigor as the mountain masses get higher and higher. Thus we have\r\nwarfare between two great natural processes--the building up and the\r\ntearing down. After a time the building-up process wanes and then\r\nceases, while the tearing-down process (erosion) continues either\r\nuntil the whole range has been completely worn down or until some\r\nrejuvenating force causes a renewed uplift. Here is an example of one\r\nof the remarkable procedures of nature. After millions of years of work\r\ncausing the deposition of thousands of feet of strata, piled layer upon\r\nlayer on the sea floor, a force of lateral pressure is brought to bear\r\nand a mountain range is literally born out of the sea. No sooner is the\r\nrange well formed than the destructive processes (erosion) unceasingly\r\nset to work to destroy this marvelous work. But the sediments derived\r\nfrom the wear of the range are carried into the nearest ocean again to\r\naccumulate and, perchance, after long ages, to be raised into another\r\nrange; and so the process may be often repeated. From this we learn\r\nthat the mountain ranges of the earth are by no means all of the same\r\nage. The original Adirondacks were formed long before the Taconics,\r\nwhich originated millions of years before the Appalachians, these\r\nlatter having been folded up long before the Sierras. The Rockies,\r\nfollowed by the Coast Ranges, are each younger than the Sierras as\r\nregards their original folding and uplift. Among foreign countries\r\nspecial mention should be made of the British Isles, where Ordovician\r\nstrata thousands of feet thick were, late in the period, notably folded\r\nand upraised, the crustal disturbance having been accompanied by great\r\nintrusions of molten rocks and vast outpourings of lavas, so that\r\nthis region ranks among the greatest of the ancient volcanic areas of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Map showing the general relations of land and\r\nwater in North America during middle and late middle Devonian time\r\nfully 15,000,000 years ago. (After Willis, courtesy of the Journal of\r\nGeology.)]\r\n\r\nWe shall now turn our attention to a very brief consideration of the\r\nsalient points in the physical history of North America during the\r\nnext great period (Silurian) of the Paleozoic era. As a result of\r\nthe physical disturbance late in the Ordovician the great interior\r\nsea was largely or wholly expelled from the continent, and this was\r\nessentially the condition of the continent at the beginning of the\r\nSilurian. But this condition was of short duration, for early in the\r\nSilurian the sea again began to spread, gradually increasing in extent\r\nto a climax in about the middle of the period. At this time the famous\r\nand extensive Niagara limestone, so named from the rock at the crest\r\nof Niagara Falls, was deposited. Except for the newly formed Taconic\r\nRange, standing out as a bold topographic feature along the middle\r\nAtlantic Coast, and a somewhat wider extent of land, the condition of\r\nthe continent during middle Silurian time was very similar to that of\r\nmiddle Ordovician time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Map showing the general relations of land and\r\nwater in North America during middle Mississippian time. (After Willis,\r\ncourtesy of the Journal of Geology.)]\r\n\r\nSoon after mid-Silurian time the seas became greatly restricted almost\r\nto disappearance as such. In the eastern United States and southeastern\r\nCanada strata of that particular age are found only in parts of\r\nOntario, New York, Ohio, Michigan, and from Pennsylvania southward\r\nto West Virginia, where they are characterized by red shales and\r\nsandstones, and salt and gypsum deposits. Such materials containing\r\nfew fossils very clearly indicate deposition in either extensive\r\nlagoons or more or less cut-off arms of the sea under arid climate\r\nconditions rather than in ordinary marine water.\r\n\r\nStill later in the Silurian the interior seas were partially restored,\r\nas shown by the fact that true marine strata corresponding to that\r\nage not only cover the salt and gypsum deposits, but are notably more\r\nextensive than they. About the close of the Silurian period almost all\r\nof the continent was dry land.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Ordovician period, the Silurian closed without any\r\nmountain-making disturbance or great uplift of land. The Silurian\r\nperiod, like the preceding Ordovician and Cambrian, seems to have been\r\nfree from any more than slight igneous activity as, for example, in\r\nMaine and New Brunswick. The total thickness of Silurian strata in\r\nNorth America is seldom more than a few thousand feet.\r\n\r\nThe salient features of the physical history of the next, or Devonian\r\nperiod, are much like those of the preceding Silurian. At the beginning\r\nof the Devonian almost all of the continent was dry land, but soon a\r\nlong, narrow arm of the sea extended across the eastern side of the\r\ncontinent from the Gulf of St. Lawrence southward through western\r\nNew England, southeastern New York and throughout the Appalachian\r\ndistrict, thus reminding us of the long, narrow sound which occupied\r\nalmost exactly the same territory during the early part of the Cambrian\r\nperiod. In the west the only water was a small embayment reaching\r\nacross southern California into Nevada. By middle Devonian time these\r\nwater areas had considerably expanded. During relatively late Devonian\r\ntime the sea was so expanded as to cover much of the Mississippi\r\nValley area, the Appalachian Mountains and St. Lawrence Valley areas,\r\nand most of the site of the Rocky Mountains, except for an island\r\nof considerable size reaching from New Mexico through Wyoming. The\r\nmain lands were most of northeastern North America, a large land area\r\nextending from Florida to Nova Scotia, and a large area on the western\r\nside of the continent from California to Alaska.\r\n\r\nA remarkable formation of late Devonian Age should be briefly\r\ndescribed. In southeastern New York and the northern Appalachian\r\nregion there was a tremendous accumulation of sediments which have\r\nconsolidated into sandstone, together with some shale and conglomerate.\r\nThis so-called \"Catskill\" formation is from 1,500 to 8,000 feet thick\r\nand is well shown as the main body of rock in the Catskill Mountains.\r\nIt is largely a shallow-water deposit of essentially nonmarine origin,\r\nas proved by coarseness of material, ripple marks, and nonmarine\r\nfossils. All evidence points to the origin of this remarkable formation\r\nas a great delta deposit built out into the shallow interior sea.\r\nNotable thinning toward the west, with increasing fineness of grain\r\nof material, shows that the sediment came from the east, no doubt\r\ncarried by a large river from the small continental land mass (called\r\n\"Appalachia\") on the eastern side of North America.\r\n\r\nThe maximum thickness of the North American Devonian seems to be about\r\n15,000 feet in the northern Appalachian region, but elsewhere it\r\ngenerally ranges from 1,000 to 4,000 feet thick. In North America the\r\nsubdivisions of the Devonian strata of New York are taken as a standard\r\nfor comparison, both because of the wonderful completeness and almost\r\nundisturbed character of the rocks there, and because they have been\r\nso carefully studied. The Devonian system is there fully 4,000 feet\r\nthick, with scarcely a minor subdivision missing, and it covers a wide\r\narea (one-third of the State) with many excellent outcrops. There was\r\npractically uninterrupted deposition of Devonian strata in southern\r\nNew York. It is doubtful if there is greater refinement of knowledge\r\nregarding the Devonian or any other Paleozoic system of strata anywhere\r\nelse in North America.\r\n\r\nDuring middle to late Devonian time the region from southern New\r\nEngland to Nova Scotia and the St. Lawrence Valley was notably\r\ndisturbed by earth movements, the lands having been considerably\r\nelevated and the rocks more or less folded. The great delta deposit of\r\nlate Devonian time, already described as being thousands of feet thick\r\nin New York and Pennsylvania, was formed by one or more streams which\r\ncarved much sediment from the newly upraised lands. Accompanying the\r\nuplift and folding of the rocks considerable masses of molten granite\r\nwere forced into the earth's crust and some molten rock was forced to\r\nthe surface, producing volcanoes. Much of the granite may now be seen\r\nat the surface in various portions of the region, while deeply eroded\r\nvolcanoes occur near the city of Montreal.\r\n\r\nExcept for the disturbance of the region from New England to the St.\r\nLawrence, the Devonian period seems to have closed rather quietly, with\r\nfairly widespread sea water over the land as already outlined. This is\r\nproved by the fact that the early strata of the next period mostly rest\r\nin regular order upon the undisturbed late Devonian strata.\r\n\r\nFor many years the term \"Carboniferous\" period was used to\r\ndesignate a single period of geologic time which, in America at\r\nleast, is now divided into two periods--the Mississippian and\r\nPennsylvanian--corresponding, respectively, to the earliest and latest\r\nCarboniferous. In regard to the relations of land and water during the\r\nMississippian period, the general statement may be made that the sea,\r\nalready fairly extensive in the late Devonian, continued to spread\r\nuntil during the second half of the Mississippian, when most of the\r\nUnited States west of the eastern border of the Appalachians (except\r\nthe Pacific Northwest), and also the Rocky Mountain region through\r\nCanada, were submerged.\r\n\r\nA significant physical change marked the close of the Mississippian.\r\nThis was the withdrawal of sea water from nearly all of the continent,\r\nthe emergence of the land having been generally sufficient to allow\r\nconsiderable erosion. The fact that the Mississippian and the next,\r\nor Pennsylvanian, strata are separated by the most extensive distinct\r\nerosion surface in the whole Paleozoic group of rocks is the chief\r\nreason for considering those two sets of strata to have formed during\r\nseparate periods of geologic time.\r\n\r\nIn eastern North America the Mississippian strata vary in thickness\r\nfrom a few hundred feet to a maximum of about 5,000 feet in eastern\r\nPennsylvania. In the West, where the thickness is commonly several\r\nthousand feet, limestone greatly predominates. There appears to have\r\nbeen vigorous volcanic activity during the period from northern\r\nCalifornia to Alaska.\r\n\r\nCertain profound crustal disturbances marked the close of the period in\r\nwestern Europe, resulting in upturning and folding of rocks during the\r\nprocess of mountain forming from Ireland to Germany, and from Bohemia\r\nto southern France. Abundant intrusions and extrusions of molten rocks\r\naccompanied the disturbances.\r\n\r\nWe turn next to a consideration of the Pennsylvanian period, which is\r\nof very special interest, because within the rocks of that age in North\r\nAmerica, Europe, and China occur the greatest known coal deposits. The\r\nperiod opened with almost all of North America dry land undergoing\r\nmore or less erosion. Early in Pennsylvanian time marine water began\r\nto overspread the western side of the continent, especially most of\r\nthe western two-thirds of the area of the United States, where strata\r\nthousands of feet thick piled up. The sea was most widespread before\r\nthe middle of the period, when the relations of land and water were\r\nabout as shown by Figure 39.\r\n\r\nOver the site of the Appalachians and most of the eastern half of the\r\nMississippi Valley area the land either stood near sea level and was\r\noften swampy or marshy, or at other times it was a little below sea\r\nlevel, allowing tidewater to overspread the area. Such conditions\r\nalternated repeatedly, usually more or less locally, over different\r\nparts of the districts in which the great coal mines of the east are\r\nlocated. Under such conditions strata from 1,000 to 8,000 feet thick\r\naccumulated. Remarkable physical geography of this kind resulted in the\r\ngrowth and accumulation of vast quantities of vegetable matter which\r\nhas changed into the world's greatest coal beds. Similar conditions\r\nprevailed over parts of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Rhode Island,\r\nwhere strata fully 13,000 feet thick accumulated.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the most perfect resemblance to coal-forming condition is\r\nthat now found on such coastal plains as that of southern Florida\r\nand the Dismal Swamps of Virginia and North Carolina. Both of these\r\nareas are very level, though with slight depressions in which there\r\nis either standing water or swamp condition. In both regions there is\r\nsuch general interference with free drainage that there are extensive\r\nareas of swamp, and in both there are beds of vegetable accumulations.\r\nIn each of these areas there is a general absence of sediment and\r\ntherefore a marked variety of vegetable deposit. If either of these\r\nareas were submerged beneath the sea, the vegetable remains would be\r\nburied and a further step made toward the formation of a coal bed.\r\nReelevation, making a coastal plain, would permit the accumulation of\r\nanother coal bed above the first, and this process might be continued\r\nagain and again.\" (H. Ries.) But it is not necessary to assume repeated\r\noscillations of a swamp area up and down as the only way of accounting\r\nfor a succession of coal beds one above another in a given region,\r\nbecause a general, but intermittent, subsidence, with possibly some\r\nupward movements, would occasionally cause the prolific plant life\r\nof a swamp to be killed, after which sediment would deposit over the\r\nsite. Shoaling of water by accumulation of sediment would permit the\r\ndevelopment of more swamp plant life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.--Map showing the general relations of land and\r\nwater, including the great coal-plant swamp areas (vertical lines), in\r\nNorth America during the Pennsylvanian period at least 10,000,000 years\r\nago. Lined areas represent land. (After Willis, courtesy of the Journal\r\nof Geology.)]\r\n\r\nIn most coal-mining districts there are at least several coal beds, one\r\nabove another. In Illinois there are nine; in Pennsylvania at least\r\ntwenty; in Alabama, thirty-five; and in Nova Scotia seventy-six, but\r\nnot all are important commercially. Each coal bed in such a region\r\nrepresents a swamp which existed in Pennsylvanian time at least ten\r\nor twelve million years ago, and in which there grew a luxuriant\r\nvegetation. Many individual swamps of that time were of wide extent.\r\nThe famous Pittsburgh bituminous coal bed represents probably the\r\nlargest one of all. It extends from western Pennsylvania into parts\r\nof Ohio and West Virginia over an area of fully 15,000 square miles.\r\nMore than 6,000 square miles of it are being worked and the coal bed\r\naverages seven feet in thickness over an area of 2,000 square miles.\r\nAmong the various anthracite coal beds of the same age in eastern\r\nPennsylvania the Mammoth bed is exceptionally thick, reaching a maximum\r\nof fifty feet or more.\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may not gain the impression that coal beds\r\nmake up a very considerable bulk of the strata in coal-mining regions,\r\nwe should state that, on the average, coal actually constitutes less\r\nthan 2 per cent of the containing strata.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the tremendous length of the geologic ages may be gained\r\nby a consideration of the time which must reasonably be allowed for\r\nthe accumulation of so many coal beds and their containing strata. It\r\nhas been estimated that a luxuriant growth of vegetation would produce\r\n100 tons of dried organic matter per hundred years. Compressed to\r\nthe specific gravity of coal (1.4) this would form a layer less than\r\ntwo-thirds of an inch deep on an acre. During the chemical alteration\r\nof vegetable matter to coal about four-fifths of the organic matter\r\ndisappears in the form of gases. On this basis, then, it would take\r\nabout 10,000 years to accumulate the vegetable matter represented in\r\na coal bed one foot thick. When we realize that the total thickness\r\nof the coal beds of the Pennsylvanian system of strata in the great\r\nmining regions is commonly from 100 to 250 feet, we conclude that the\r\ntime they represent is from 1,000,000 to 2,500,000 years. It seems\r\nmost reasonable that the time necessary for the deposition of the\r\ncontaining strata must have been at least as long. It is, therefore, a\r\nfair conclusion that the Pennsylvanian period lasted from 2,000,000 to\r\n5,000,000 years.\r\n\r\nThat the climate of the great Coal Age was warm (not tropical), very\r\nmoist, and uniform, is borne out by such facts as the following,\r\naccording to D. White: The succulent nature of the plants with their\r\nspongy leaves indicates prolific growth in moist, mild climate; lack of\r\nyearly rings of growth points to lack of distinct seasons; as in the\r\ncase of many existing plants the aerial roots signify a warm, moist\r\nclimate; plants of to-day nearest like the coal plants thrive best\r\nin warm, moist regions; vegetable matter at present accumulates best\r\nin temperate rather than tropical climates, because there decay is\r\nnot so rapid; and the remarkable uniformity of climate over the earth\r\nis clearly indicated by finding fossil plants of almost or exactly\r\nidentical types in rocks of Pennsylvanian Age from the Polar regions to\r\nthe Tropics. The more remarkable plants of the great Coal Age time are\r\ndescribed in the chapter on the evolution of plants (Plate 15).\r\n\r\nDuring the last (Permian) period of the Paleozoic era the marine waters\r\nof the west, and the alternating shallow tidewater, swamps, and near\r\nsea level lands of the east gradually gave way to dry lands, so that\r\nby the close of the period marine water covered only a small part of\r\nthe Southwest from Oklahoma across central Texas to southern California\r\nand northwestern Mexico, where strata as much as several thousand feet\r\nthick formed. In the middle western part of the area of the United\r\nStates, especially from northern Texas to Nebraska and Wyoming, the\r\nclimate was arid and red strata (so-called \"Red Beds\"), salt, and\r\ngypsum were extensively deposited on land and in great salt lakes or\r\nmore or less cut-off arms of the sea. Strata commonly from 2,000 to\r\n7,000 feet thick were there deposited. Similar conditions prevailed\r\nin parts of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland, where strata\r\n8,000 feet thick accumulated. Over the site of most of the Appalachians\r\nthe coal swamp conditions, with local sea incursions, continued from\r\nthe preceding period, as shown by the character of the strata (1,000\r\nfeet thick) containing some coal.\r\n\r\nVigorous volcanic activity which, as already mentioned, began in the\r\nMississippian period from northern California to Alaska continued not\r\nonly through the Pennsylvanian and Permian but also into the early\r\nMesozoic era, as shown by the great quantities of volcanic materials\r\nassociated with rocks of those ages.\r\n\r\nThe Permian presents a puzzling combination of climatic conditions\r\nwhich causes it to stand out in marked contrast against the generally\r\nmild and uniform climates of nearly all of preceding Paleozoic time.\r\nMost remarkable of all are the records of a great Ice Age during early\r\nPermian time. One surprising fact is the widespread distribution of the\r\nglacial deposits in both the north and south temperate zones, and even\r\nwell within the torrid zone. They are perhaps most extensive and best\r\nknown in Australia, South Africa, India, and Brazil. Glacial deposits\r\nalmost certainly of the same age on smaller scales occur in eastern\r\nMassachusetts, southern England, eastern Russia and the Caucasus\r\nregion. Although the areas occupied by the Permian glaciers, which in\r\nmany cases must have been extensive ice sheets, cannot be accurately\r\ndelimited, it is, nevertheless, quite certain that the ice was notably\r\nmore extensively developed than it was during the great \"Ice Age\"\r\nof late (Quaternary) geologic time. Another surprising fact is that\r\ncertain of the glaciers must have come down to, or nearly to, sea\r\nlevel, as shown by the direct association of marine strata with glacial\r\ndeposits. Thus, in southern Australia at least eight beds of glacial\r\nmaterials (some of them 100 to 200 feet thick) occur within true marine\r\nstrata 2,000 feet thick. A third remarkable fact is that the Permian\r\nIce Age, like the Quaternary Ice Age, had interglacial epochs of\r\nrelatively mild climate, as proved by the occurrences of beds of coal\r\nbetween certain of the layers of glacial materials in Australia, South\r\nAfrica, and Brazil.\r\n\r\nDuring much of Permian time the climate was arid over large areas as,\r\nfor example, much of the western interior of the United States, from\r\nIreland to central Germany, and in eastern Russia, as proved by great\r\ndeposits of salt, gypsum, and red sediments. During late Permian time\r\nthe greatest salt beds in the world were deposited in northern Germany,\r\na well near Berlin having penetrated a practically solid body of salt\r\nassociated with certain potash and magnesia salts to a depth of about\r\n4,000 feet without reaching the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of some coal beds, especially in the earlier Permian\r\nrocks shows that, temporarily at least, climatic conditions must have\r\nfavored luxurious growths of coal-forming plants in South Africa,\r\nBrazil, Australia, and our own Appalachian district.\r\n\r\nFrom the above facts we see that the Permian represents a remarkable\r\ncombination of very extensive glaciation, widespread aridity, and\r\nwarmth and moisture favorable to prolific plant growth all in a single\r\nperiod of geologic time.\r\n\r\nThe Permian period, and, therefore, the great Paleozoic era, was\r\nbrought to a close by one of the most profound physical disturbances\r\nin the known history of North America. This has been called the\r\nAppalachian Revolution because at that time the Appalachian Mountain\r\nrange was born out of the sea by folding and upheaval of the strata.\r\nIn fact, \"the Appalachian Revolution was one of the most critical\r\nperiods in the history of the earth, and may have been the greatest\r\nof them all in its results.\" (C. Schuchert). Mountains were brought\r\nforth in all the continents, including Australia. All of the mountains\r\nwhich were formed late in the Paleozoic have since been profoundly\r\naffected by erosion, and the only ones (e.g., Appalachians) which now\r\nshow considerable altitudes are those which have been rejuvenated by\r\nrelatively (geologically) recent earth movements.\r\n\r\nWe shall now turn our attention to the origin of the Appalachian\r\nRange. All through the vast time (probably fully 20,000,000 years) of\r\nthe Paleozoic era a large land mass was remarkably persistent along\r\nthe eastern side of North America. This land, which has been called\r\n\"Appalachia,\" had its western boundary approximately along the eastern\r\nborder of the sites of the Appalachian Range and the western part of\r\nNew England. It extended east of the present coast line at least to the\r\nborder of the continental shelf from 100 to 200 miles out. Concerning\r\nthe actual altitude and topography of Appalachia we know little or\r\nnothing, but the tremendous quantities of sediment derived from its\r\nerosion show that it was high enough during nearly all of its history\r\nto undergo vigorous erosion.\r\n\r\nBarring certain minor oscillations of level, the region just west\r\nof Appalachia was mostly occupied by sea water throughout much of\r\nPaleozoic time, and sediments derived from the erosion of Appalachia\r\nwere laid down layer upon layer as strata upon that sea bottom. In\r\ngeneral, the coarsest and greatest thickness of sediments accumulated\r\nrelatively near the land, while finer materials, in thinner sheets,\r\ndeposited well out over much of the eastern Mississippi Valley area\r\nin the shallow seas which were there so commonly present. By actual\r\nmeasurement we know that the thickness of strata deposited over the\r\nsite of the Appalachians was at least 25,000 feet. Since these latter\r\nstrata are mostly of comparatively shallow sea-water origin, as proved\r\nby coarseness of grain of material, ripple marks, fossil coral reefs,\r\netc., we are forced to conclude that this marginal sea bottom gradually\r\nsank while the process of sedimentation was in progress. Otherwise\r\nwe cannot possibly explain the great pile of strata of shallow water\r\norigin. The very weight of accumulating strata may either have aided or\r\nactually caused the sinking of the long, relatively narrow trough.\r\n\r\nFinally, toward the close of the Paleozoic era, sinking of the marginal\r\nsea floor and deposition of sediments gave way to a yielding of the\r\nearth's crust by a great force of lateral compression, causing the\r\nstrata to be thrown into folds well below the surface and more or less\r\nfractured in their upper portion. Thus, along the eastern side of the\r\nsite of the great interior Paleozoic sea, the Appalachian Mountains\r\nrose out of what for millions of years had been a long, narrow, sinking\r\nsea floor. There was more or less folding from the Gulf of St. Lawrence\r\nto central Alabama. Figure 24 diagrammatically represents the principal\r\nstages in the history of the Appalachian Range.\r\n\r\nWhile the most pronounced earth disturbance occurred through the\r\nlong Appalachian belt, the whole eastern side of the continent was\r\nprofoundly affected. Thus the Mississippi Valley area east of the Great\r\nPlains was considerably upraised never again to be submerged except\r\nalong the Gulf Coast, and an eastern interior sea has never since\r\noverspread the region which was repeatedly sea-covered during Paleozoic\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nMEDIEVAL EARTH HISTORY\r\n\r\n(_Mesozoic Era_)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the condition of North America during the first or Triassic\r\nperiod of the Mesozoic era, approximately 8 or 10 million years ago?\r\nAs a result of the Appalachian Revolution the sea was excluded from\r\nall the land except along much of the western side from southern\r\nCalifornia to parts of Alaska. On this western side of the continent\r\nthe Appalachian Revolution had little or no effect and the Permian\r\nconditions continued, essentially without change through the Triassic.\r\nThe Triassic strata up to 4,000 feet thick are there of typical marine\r\norigin. In British Columbia and Alaska there was much igneous activity.\r\n\r\nThroughout much of the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains region of the\r\nwestern United States there are extensive deposits of red sediments\r\n(so-called \"Red Beds\"), containing layers of salt and gypsum, from 200\r\nto 1,000 or more feet thick. These strata commonly rest in regular\r\norder on Permian Red Beds, so that conditions of deposition of Permian\r\ntime continued through Triassic time, that is continental deposits\r\nformed mostly in salt lakes, fresh lakes, along stream courses, and on\r\nland in part by the action of wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.--Map showing the general relations of land\r\nand water in North America during the Triassic period. Lined areas\r\nrepresent land; vertical-lined areas, basins in which continental\r\ndeposits formed. (Based upon map by Willis; courtesy of the Journal of\r\nGeology.)]\r\n\r\nIn the eastern half of North America there is no record of accumulation\r\nof any marine strata whatever, because, as a result of the Appalachian\r\nRevolution, the land was brought well above sea level. There was,\r\nhowever, deposition of a remarkable series of nonmarine strata in\r\nseveral long, narrow, troughlike depressions whose trend was parallel\r\nto, and just east of, the main axis of the newly formed Appalachian\r\nRange. These troughs lay between the Appalachians and the very\r\npersistent old land mass called Appalachia which we have already\r\ndescribed. The facts that these troughs are truly down-warps; that\r\nthey so perfectly follow the trend of the Appalachian Mountain folds;\r\nand that the strata in them are of late Triassic Age, make it certain\r\nthat they were formed by a great lateral pressure which must have been\r\na continuation of the Appalachian Revolution. Thus the Appalachian\r\nMountains continued to grow well into the Triassic period, and, while\r\nthe Paleozoic strata were being folded, the surface of old Appalachia\r\n(including part of the Taconic Mountain region) was down-warped to\r\nform the troughs in which the late Triassic strata accumulated. One\r\ntrough extended through the Connecticut Valley; another (the largest)\r\nfrom southeastern New York through northern New Jersey, southeastern\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, and into Virginia; while several smaller ones\r\noccurred in Virginia and North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe down-warps or troughlike basins were very favorably situated\r\nfor rapid accumulation of thick sedimentary deposits because of\r\ntheir position just between large, high land masses which were being\r\nvigorously eroded. The sediments derived from the erosion of the young\r\nAppalachians were especially abundant because of the vigorous wearing\r\ndown of the newly formed high mountains. A thickness of from 5,000\r\nto fully 15,000 feet of mostly red sandstones and shales accumulated\r\nin these down-warps, the character and great thickness of the strata\r\nstrongly pointing to gradual down-warping as the deposition of the\r\nsediments went on. It is often stated that these strata were formed in\r\nestuaries, but, in the northern areas, at least from Massachusetts to\r\nMaryland, many of the layers show ripple marks, sun cracks, rain-drop\r\npits, fossil plants, and fossil bones and tracks of land reptiles. Such\r\nstrata may well have formed in very shallow water, such as river-flood\r\nplains or temporary lakes, where changing conditions frequently allowed\r\nthe surface layers to lie exposed to the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.--Block diagram of the region westward from\r\nNew York City and vicinity, showing the main relief features, the\r\nunderground relations of rocks of widely different ages, and the\r\nrelation of the relief to the rock formations. (Part of larger drawing\r\nby A. K. Lobeck.)]\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the accumulation of the late Triassic strata in the\r\ndown-warp basins there was considerable igneous activity, as proved by\r\nthe occurrence of sheets of igneous rock within the body of strata. In\r\nsome cases true lava flows with cindery tops were forced out on the\r\nsurface and then buried under later sediments, while in other cases\r\nthe sheets of molten rock were forced up either between the strata or\r\nobliquely through them, thus proving their intrusive character. As a\r\nresult of subsequent erosion, these very resistant lava masses often\r\nstand out conspicuously as relief features. Perhaps the most noteworthy\r\nexample is the great layer of such intrusive igneous rock, part of\r\nwhich outcrops for seventy miles mostly as a bold cliff forming the\r\nfamous Palisades of the Hudson, near New York City. During the process\r\nof cooling and solidification of the molten mass there was contraction\r\nwhich expressed itself by breaking the rock mass into great, crude,\r\nnearly vertical columns, and hence the origin of the name \"Palisades.\"\r\nThe cliff character of the outcrop is due to the fact that the lava\r\nis much more resistant to erosion than the sandstone above and below\r\nit. In the Connecticut Valley of Massachusetts a layer of lava several\r\nhundred feet thick boldly outcrops, forming the crest of the well-known\r\nMount Tom-Mount Holyoke Range.\r\n\r\nThe close of the Triassic period was marked by enough uplift to leave\r\nthe whole eastern two-thirds of the continent dry land undergoing\r\nerosion. The Triassic deposits of the Atlantic Coast are much broken up\r\ninto large fault blocks, and this faulting probably took place as a\r\nresult of the crustal disturbances toward the end of the period. In the\r\nwest the Triassic conditions seem to have continued without much change\r\ninto the next (or Jurassic) period.\r\n\r\nDuring the Jurassic period the relations of land and water in North\r\nAmerica were very simple. In the earlier Jurassic all was dry land\r\nexcept portions of the western fringe of the continent from southern\r\nCalifornia to Alaska, where marine strata 2,000 to 10,000 feet thick\r\naccumulated. Late in the period the conditions were the same, except\r\nfor a long, narrow arm of the sea or mediterranean which extended from\r\nthe Arctic Ocean southward across the site of the Rocky Mountains to\r\nArizona. There is no evidence for the existence of anything like real\r\nmountains anywhere on the continent during the period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.--Structure section showing profile and\r\nunderground relations of rocks across the Connecticut Valley (through\r\nMount Tom) of Massachusetts. Js and Jl are sandstone strata, with\r\nincluded lava sheets (in black) resting upon Paleozoic rocks on either\r\nside. The rocks have been notably tilted and faulted. (After Emerson,\r\nU. S. Geological Survey.)] Profound crustal disturbances marked the\r\nclose of the Jurassic period in the western part of the continent.\r\nStrata which had accumulated to great thickness during millions\r\nof years of time, mainly over the sites of the Sierra Nevada and\r\nCascade Mountains, finally yielded to a tremendous force of lateral\r\ncompression, especially in the Sierra region, and were folded,\r\ncrumpled, and upraised. Thus the Sierra-Cascade district was originally\r\nbuilt up into a high mountain range. Since that time the Sierras\r\nhave been much cut down by erosion and they have been rejuvenated\r\nby faulting and tilting of the great earth block. The Cascade Range\r\nfrom northern California into British Columbia was apparently not so\r\nprofoundly raised, and its present height is mainly due to subsequent\r\nvolcanic activity. The rocks of the Klamath Mountains of northwestern\r\nCalifornia, and of the Humboldt Range of Nevada, were also folded at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nDuring the mountain-making disturbances on the western side of the\r\ncontinent great quantities of molten granite were forced up into the\r\nlower portions of the folding strata. Because of profound subsequent\r\nerosion this granite is now widely exposed as, for example, in the\r\ngreat walls of the Yosemite Valley.\r\n\r\nDuring the earlier half of the last period (the Cretaceous) of the\r\nMesozoic era, sea water spread from Mississippi northwestward to the\r\nsite of Denver and southward over Texas and much of Mexico. At the\r\nsame time much of the western margin of the continent from Alaska to\r\nCalifornia was submerged. All the rest of the continent was land.\r\nDuring this time sediments accumulated on low lands just east of the\r\nsite of the present Rocky Mountains, and also east of the Appalachians,\r\nas proved by the numerous fossils of land plants found in these\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.--Map Showing the general rotations of land\r\nand water in North America during later Cretaceous time, several\r\nmillion years ago. Lined areas represent land; vertical lines, mainly\r\ncontinental deposits. (Principal data from a map by Willis, published\r\nin the Journal of Geology.)]\r\n\r\nAs Cretaceous time went on the marine waters gradually spread until\r\nthe whole Atlantic and Gulf coastal plain regions from Long Island,\r\nNew York, to Mexico became submerged under marine water, and a wide\r\narm of the sea, or great mediterranean, spread from Texas north to the\r\nmouth of the Mackenzie River. The Gulf of Mexico was thus directly\r\nconnected with the Arctic Ocean. This great interior sea was nowhere\r\nconnected with the Pacific Ocean, though portions of the Pacific\r\nborder of the continent were submerged. This vast interior sea was not\r\nonly the largest of any which reached well into the continent since\r\nthe Mississippian period of the Paleozoic era, but it was the last\r\nbody of marine water which ever extended well into the continent. It\r\nshould be stated that the later Cretaceous was also a time of unusually\r\nwidespread submergence of the continents, when most of southern Europe\r\nand southeastern Asia, as well as about one-half of both Africa and\r\nSouth America were submerged. Over much of the site of the Rocky\r\nMountains during the late Cretaceous there were low lands receiving\r\ncontinental deposits, and extensive marshes supporting prolific\r\nvegetation were common. Much of this vegetable matter became buried,\r\nand has since been converted into workable coal.\r\n\r\nThe maximum thickness of strata accumulated during all of Cretaceous\r\ntime over the Atlantic coastal plain area was about 1,700 feet; over\r\nthe Gulf coastal plain region fully 7,500 feet; over the western\r\ninterior 10,000 to 15,000; and over parts of the Pacific border 25,000\r\nto 30,000 feet, as in California. The last-named figures are truly\r\nphenomenal, representing a thickness about equal to the total thickness\r\nof all the strata accumulated during the whole Paleozoic era (seven\r\nperiods) and piled up in the Appalachian Mountain region. This great\r\ndeposit of strata of mostly early Cretaceous Age is readily accounted\r\nfor when we realize that these sediments, which accumulated in the\r\nmarginal sea bottom, were derived from the very rapidly eroding, newly\r\nformed lofty Sierra Nevada Range.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.--Sketch of a mountain range along Skolat Creek,\r\nAlaska, showing Tertiary lava beds resting upon deeply eroded tilted\r\nlimestones and lavas of late Paleozoic (Carboniferous) Age. The present\r\ntopography has been produced by erosion since the Tertiary lavas flowed\r\nout. (After U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nEspecially in Alabama and Texas the Cretaceous system is remarkable for\r\nits richness in chalk deposits. In Alabama a widespread formation of\r\nlate Cretaceous Age, about 1,000 feet thick, contains much nearly pure\r\nwhite chalk, and in Texas a similarly constituted formation of early\r\nmiddle Cretaceous Age is from 1,000 to 5,000 feet thick. These chalk\r\ndeposits consist almost wholly of carbonate of lime shells or very\r\ntiny single-celled animals which accumulated under exceptionally clear\r\nsea water which spread over those parts of Alabama and Texas where the\r\nchalk now occurs. Here again we have a bit of evidence supporting the\r\nfact of very long geologic time. Think of how long it must have taken\r\nfor the tiny (even microscopic) shells to form a widespread layer of\r\nchalk nearly a mile thick!\r\n\r\nThe close of the Cretaceous period, or what is the same, the close\r\nof the Mesozoic era, was marked by some of the grandest crustal\r\ndisturbances in the known history of the earth. In fact, it is not\r\nknown that the western hemisphere was ever affected by more profound\r\nand widespread mountain-making disturbances than those which took\r\nplace toward the close of the Mesozoic era, and continued into the\r\nsucceeding Tertiary period. These disturbances were of three kinds:\r\nfolding of strata, volcanic activity, and renewed uplift of old\r\nmountains without folding of the rocks. Greatest of all was the \"Rocky\r\nMountain Revolution,\" during which the thick strata, which accumulated\r\nduring the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras over the site of the Rockies,\r\nyielded to vigorous deformation when they were more or less folded\r\nand dislocated from Alaska to Central America. This was in truth the\r\nbirth of the Rocky Mountains, although their existing altitude and\r\nconfiguration have, to a very considerable degree, resulted from later\r\nuplift and erosion. In the northern United States and southern Canada\r\nthe Rocky Mountain strata, up to over 40,000 feet thick, were most\r\nseverely folded and fractured, forming a range which quite certainly\r\nwas fully 20,000 feet high. In this district a great thrust fault,\r\nhundreds of miles long, developed, and rocks as old as the Proterozoic\r\nwere shoved at least seven miles, and probably as much as twenty\r\nmiles, westward, over Cretaceous and other rocks much later than the\r\nProterozoic. At the same time the Andes Mountains throughout South\r\nAmerica were notably upraised and the rocks folded.\r\n\r\nThe second type of physical disturbance was volcanic activity which\r\ntook place on a tremendous scale, and which appears to have started as\r\na direct accompaniment of the Rocky Mountain Revolution. This igneous\r\nactivity took place not only in the Rocky Mountains but also westward\r\nto and in the Sierra-Cascade Range, as well as in the mountains of\r\nwestern British Columbia and Alaska. This activity continued well into\r\nthe succeeding Cenozoic era, and it is more fully considered in the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\nThe third type of crustal disturbance took place on a large scale when\r\nthe Appalachian Mountains, which had been almost wholly planed away by\r\nerosion during Mesozoic time, were reelevated from 1,000 to 3,000 feet\r\nby an uplifting force not accompanied by folding. All or nearly all\r\nof New York and New England, as well as much of southeastern Canada,\r\nwere similarly upraised at the same time. This notable uplift of so\r\nmuch of eastern North America is a matter of great importance because\r\nthe major relief features of that area have been produced by erosion\r\nor dissection of the upraised surface since late Mesozoic or early\r\nCenozoic time. In view of the fact that this work of erosion took\r\nplace almost wholly during the Cenozoic era, it will be discussed in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, brief mention may be made of the kind of climate of the\r\nMesozoic era. As shown by the character and distribution of fossil\r\nplants and animals, the Mesozoic climate was in general mild and rather\r\nuniform over the earth, but with some distinction of climatic zones.\r\nSuch distinction of climatic zones is unknown for the Paleozoic era,\r\nwhile it was notably less than at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nMODERN EARTH HISTORY\r\n\r\n(_Cenozoic Era_)\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the Cenozoic era is the last one of geologic time, it will be of\r\nparticular interest to trace out the main events which have led up to\r\nthe present day conditions, especially in North America. Both because\r\nof the recency of the time and the unusual accessibility of the rocks,\r\nwhich are mostly at or near the surface, our knowledge of the Cenozoic\r\nera is exceptionally detailed and accurate. It will, therefore, be more\r\nnecessary than ever to select only the very significant features of\r\nthis history for our brief discussion.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the Tertiary period portions only of the\r\nAtlantic coastal plain were submerged under shallow water, but soon\r\nafter the middle of the period (Miocene epoch) the sea spread over\r\npractically the whole Atlantic coastal plain area from Martha's\r\nVineyard south to and including Florida. During the late Tertiary the\r\nmarine waters had become greatly restricted, and by the close of the\r\nperiod the sea was entirely excluded from the Atlantic seaboard. The\r\ntotal thickness of these Tertiary strata is less than 1,000 feet, and\r\nthey all tilt downward gently toward the sea. The strata consist mostly\r\nof unconsolidated sands, gravels, clays, marls, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf coastal plain area from Florida through Texas and south\r\nthrough eastern Mexico was largely overspread by the sea during most\r\nof Tertiary time, except the latest. During early Tertiary time an arm\r\nof the Gulf reached north to the mouth of the Ohio River. Late in the\r\nperiod but little of the Gulf Plain was submerged, and at its close sea\r\nwater was wholly excluded. On the Gulf Coast the Tertiary strata from\r\n2,000 to 4,000 feet thick are also mainly sands, gravels, clays, and\r\nmarls. They are commonly rich in fossils, and they show a gentle tilt\r\ndownward toward the Gulf.\r\n\r\nThroughout Tertiary time local portions of the Pacific border of\r\nthe continent were submerged, this having been especially true of\r\nportions of California, Oregon, and Washington. In spite of the very\r\nrestricted marine waters, the Tertiary strata of the Pacific Coast,\r\nespecially in California, are remarkably thick, 10,000 to 20,000 feet\r\nbeing common, while the maximum thickness is fully 30,000 feet. Such\r\ngreat thicknesses are readily explained when we realize that erosion\r\nwas notably speeded up by pronounced uplifts resulting from crustal\r\ndisturbances toward the close of the preceding period, and again in the\r\nmidst of the Tertiary period itself.\r\n\r\nTo summarize the Tertiary relations of sea and land for North America\r\nwe may say that only local portions of the continental border ever\r\nbecame submerged, and that, by late Tertiary time, practically the\r\nwhole continent was a land area. At the close of the period the\r\ncontinent was, as we shall see, even larger than now because the\r\ncontinental shelves of the ocean were then also largely above water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.--Map showing the general relations of land\r\nand water in North America during part of the middle Tertiary period.\r\n(After Willis, courtesy of the Journal of Geology.)]\r\n\r\nThe whole of the Cenozoic era, including both the Tertiary and\r\nQuaternary periods, has been a time of profound crustal disturbances\r\nthroughout much of the continent, certain of these movements having\r\ncontinued right up to the present time, with positive evidence that\r\nsome of them are still continuing. These great movements have included\r\nnotable foldings of strata, uplifts without folding, faulting, and\r\nigneous activity, the whole effect having been to greatly increase\r\nthe general altitude and ruggedness of the continent. In fact, North\r\nAmerica is not known ever to have been at once higher, broader, and\r\nmore rugged than it was very late in the Tertiary, or early in the\r\nQuaternary, period. Since that time the only notable change (barring\r\nthe great Ice Age and its effects) has been a restriction of the area\r\nof the continent to its present size by spreading of sea waters over\r\nthe borders of the continent, that is over the continental shelves.\r\n\r\nWe shall now rather systematically consider the more profound earth\r\nchanges which have affected the continent, producing the existing major\r\nrelief features, from west to east.\r\n\r\nThe \"Coast Range Revolution\" took place in the midst of the Tertiary\r\nperiod. Over the site of the Coast Ranges, strata had accumulated,\r\nespecially during Cretaceous and earlier Tertiary times, to a\r\nthickness of thousands of feet. In middle Tertiary time these strata\r\nwere subjected to a mountain-making force of compression and more or\r\nless folded, faulted (fractured), and uplifted into the Coast Range\r\nMountains. Some portions of the range were intensely folded and faulted\r\nand upraised many thousands of feet, while other portions were only\r\nmoderately folded and uplifted. It is an interesting fact that the\r\ngreat San Francisco earthquake rift or fault originated at this time.\r\nIt was a renewed, sudden movement of a few feet along this fault which\r\ncaused the disastrous earthquake of 1906. Still other considerable\r\nearth movements took place in the Coast Range region during late\r\nTertiary and Quaternary times, as, for example, uplift without folding,\r\nas proved by distinct sea-cut terraces at altitudes of more than a\r\nthousand feet, like those north of San Francisco and south of Los\r\nAngeles. A moderate amount of still later subsidence has caused the\r\ndevelopment of San Francisco Bay. The large islands off the coast\r\nof southern California have in very recent geologic time (probably\r\nQuaternary) been cut off from the mainland by sinking of the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 11.--(_a_) Part of the Mammoth Hot Springs Terrace\r\nin the Yellowstone Park.

The limestone was\r\nenveloped in the granite while it was being forced in molten condition\r\ninto the earth's crust. (_Photo by the author._)]\r\n\r\nThe Sierra Nevada Range, which originated by intense folding of rocks\r\nlate in the Jurassic period, underwent profound erosion until about\r\nthe middle of the Tertiary period, by which time it had been cut down\r\nto a range of hills or low mountains. Then the great fault (fracture)\r\npreviously described began to develop along the eastern side. As a\r\nresult of many sudden movements along this fault, which is hundreds of\r\nmiles long, the vast earth block has been tilted westward with a very\r\nsteep eastern face and a long, more gradual western slope, the crest of\r\nthe fault block forming the summit of the range. The amount of nearly\r\nvertical displacement along this fault has been commonly from 10,000\r\nto 20,000 feet, and, in spite of considerable erosion of the top of\r\nthe fault block and accumulation of sediment at its eastern base, the\r\nmodified fault face now usually stands out boldly from 2,000 to 10,000\r\nfeet high. As an evidence that this movement of faulting has not yet\r\nceased we may cite the Inyo earthquake of 1872, when there was a sudden\r\nrenewal of movement of ten to twenty-five feet along this fault for\r\nmany miles. Since the great Sierra block began to tilt, the many mighty\r\ncanyons, like Yosemite, Hetch-Hetchy, King's River, and Feather River,\r\nhave been carved out by the action of streams, in some cases aided by\r\nformer glaciers. King's River canyon has been sunk to a maximum depth\r\nof 6,900 feet in solid granite solely by the erosive action of the\r\nriver!\r\n\r\nThe Cascade Mountains, too, were reduced to nearly a peneplain\r\ncondition by late Tertiary time when they began to be rejuvenated by\r\narching or bowing of the surface unaccompanied by great faulting or\r\nfracturing, and many canyons, like that of the Columbia River, have\r\nsince been carved out.\r\n\r\nMention should now be made of the vigorous volcanic activity which took\r\nplace in the Cascade and Sierra Nevada Ranges. Most of this activity\r\noccurred during Tertiary time (particularly in the latter part) and it\r\nhas continued with diminishing force practically to the present time.\r\nIn California streams of lava buried many gold-bearing river gravels\r\nwhich have yielded rich mines. Many well-known mountain peaks, such\r\nas Shasta, Lassen, Pitt, Hood, and Rainier, from northern California\r\nto Washington, are great volcanic cones which date from Tertiary\r\ntime, and which are now mostly inactive. That this volcanic activity\r\nhas not yet altogether ceased is shown by renewed eruptions of Mount\r\nLassen (or Lassen Peak, altitude 10,437 feet) in northern California.\r\nSince the beginning of this renewed activity in 1914, several hundred\r\noutbursts have occurred. No molten rock has flowed out, but large\r\nquantities of rock fragments, dust and steam have been erupted, in many\r\ncases forming great clouds two or three miles high over the top of the\r\nmountain (Plate 10). At this writing (October, 1920), Mount Lassen is\r\nstill showing vigorous activity. At Cinder Cone, only ten miles from\r\nMount Lassen, there were two eruptions of cinders and a considerable\r\noutpouring of lava within the last 200 years. Still other very recent\r\ncinder cones occur in southeastern California and Arizona.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.--Sketch map showing the distribution of\r\nvolcanic rocks of Cenozoic (mostly Tertiary) Age in western North\r\nAmerica. Only one volcano (Mount Lassen, California) is now active\r\nin the United States proper, but a number are more or less active\r\nin Mexico and Central America. (Data from Willis, U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey.)]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest lava fields in the world forms the Columbian\r\nPlateau between western Wyoming (including the Yellowstone National\r\nPark) and the Cascade Mountains from northeastern California to\r\nnorthern Washington. It covers fully 200,000 square miles and is really\r\nconsiderably larger than shown on the map because the lava in parts of\r\nthe plateau region are covered by very recent sedimentary materials.\r\n\r\nThe great lava fields of the Deccan, India, and of the plateau region\r\nof western Mexico are comparable in size to the Columbian field and\r\nthese lava fields are all of the same age. In the Columbian Plateau\r\nmost of the lava was poured out during later Tertiary time. Sheets of\r\nmolten rock, averaging fifty to one hundred feet in thickness, spread\r\nout over various parts of the region and piled up by overlapping\r\nlayers one over another until the lava plateau more than a mile high\r\nwas built up. Many hills and low mountains were completely buried\r\nunder the molten floods, and in other places the liquid rock masses\r\nflowed against the higher mountains. \"For thousands of square miles\r\nthe surface is a lava plain which meets the boundary mountains as a\r\nlake or sea meets a rugged and deeply indented coast.... The plateau\r\nwas long in building. Between the layers are found in places old soil\r\nbeds and forest grounds and the sediments of lakes.... So ancient are\r\nthe latest floods in the Columbia River Basin that they have weathered\r\nto a residual yellow clay from thirty to sixty feet in depth, and\r\nmarvelously rich in the mineral substances on which plants feed. In\r\nthe Snake River Valley the latest lavas are much younger (Quaternary).\r\nTheir surfaces are so fresh and undecayed that here the effusive\r\neruptions may have continued to within the period of human history.\"\r\n(W. H. Norton.) Many of the lava layers are plainly visible where the\r\nColumbia River has cut its great gorge or canyon. The Snake River in\r\nplaces has sunk its channel several thousand feet into the lava plateau\r\nwithout reaching underlying rock.\r\n\r\nBoth north and south of the Columbian Plateau there was also much\r\nvolcanic activity in the Rocky Mountain region during Tertiary time. A\r\nsingle formation in Colorado consists mostly of volcanic \"ash\" or dust\r\nover 2,000 feet thick. There was also much volcanic activity over the\r\nColorado Plateau area of southern Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona. The\r\nvolcanoes there exhibit all stages from those which are very recent and\r\npractically unaffected by erosion to others which have been completely\r\ncut away with the exception of the cores or \"volcanic necks.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the Tertiary period the whole region known\r\nas the Great Basin, between the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California\r\nand the Wasatch Mountains of Utah, began to be affected by profound\r\nfaulting or fracturing and tilting of portions of the earth's crust.\r\nThe two largest faults, one on the western side of the Wasatch Range\r\nand the other on the eastern side of the Sierra Range, are each\r\nhundreds of miles long. Each of these ranges owes most of its present\r\naltitude to the uptilting of great fault blocks, and most of the many\r\nnearly north-south Basin Ranges of Nevada and Utah are in reality\r\nrecently tilted fault blocks.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the Colorado Plateau, studies have shown that region\r\nto have been more or less periodically raised fully 20,000 feet since\r\nthe beginning of Tertiary time, but because of profound erosion in\r\nthe meantime its present altitude is only 6,000 to 9,000 feet. During\r\nlate Tertiary time the land stood at a much lower level than to-day,\r\nso that, practically during the last period (Quaternary) of geologic\r\ntime, the region has been elevated to its present position. As a\r\ndirect result of this profound rejuvenation the Colorado River has\r\nhad its erosive activity tremendously increased, and it has carved\r\nout the mightiest of all existing canyons--the Grand Canyon. The work\r\nof deepening and widening the canyon is still proceeding at a rapid\r\ngeologic rate.\r\n\r\nAs we have learned, the Rocky Mountains and many of its subsidiary\r\nranges were formed by folding and uplift of strata toward the close\r\nof the Mesozoic era (Cretaceous period). During much of Tertiary time\r\nthe newly formed mountains had been considerably reduced by erosion.\r\nThen, late in the Tertiary period, much of the Rocky Mountain region,\r\nas well as much of the Great Plains area just east of the mountains,\r\nbecame rejuvenated by differential uplift without any notable folding\r\nof strata. We can tell that this general uplift amounted to at least\r\nseveral thousand feet because definite formations of relatively late\r\nTertiary strata, originally horizontally deposited under inland bodies\r\nof water, gradually rise so that at the base of the Front Range of\r\nthe Rockies they are fully 3,000 feet higher than they are 200 miles\r\nor more farther east. Thus, the original folding and faulting of the\r\nRockies, Tertiary volcanic activity, late Tertiary rejuvenation, and\r\nsubsequent erosion account for the present altitude and relief features\r\nof the great Rocky Mountain system.\r\n\r\nPortions of the rejuvenated Great Plains region have been notably\r\ndissected by erosion since the late Tertiary, this being particularly\r\ntrue of the so-called \"Bad Lands,\" especially in parts of Wyoming and\r\nSouth Dakota, where mostly relatively soft Tertiary strata have been\r\ncut to pieces.\r\n\r\nTurning our attention now to the eastern half of the continent we find\r\nthat all, or nearly all, of it was more or less raised toward the\r\nclose of the Tertiary period. Practically the whole Mississippi Valley\r\neast of the Great Plains, as well as much of the country to the north\r\nin Canada, was elevated some hundreds of feet and the streams have\r\nsince the late Tertiary uplift (except where the land was ice-covered\r\nduring the Ice Age) been at work sinking their channels below the newly\r\nupraised surface.\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out, the lowlands of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal\r\nPlains were mostly submerged under the sea during early middle Tertiary\r\ntime. By the close of the period they had emerged practically to their\r\npresent positions, and they have been only moderately affected by\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\nWe have still to explain the existing topography or relief of a large\r\nand important part of eastern North America, including the whole of\r\nthe Appalachian Mountains, Allegheny Plateau, Piedmont Plateau, New\r\nYork, New England, and the Canadian region to the north. As a starting\r\npoint in this discussion we should recall the fact that, after the\r\ngreat Appalachian Mountain Revolution toward the close of the Paleozoic\r\nera, the predominant geologic process which affected the region under\r\nconsideration was erosion throughout the succeeding Mesozoic era. By\r\nabout the close of the Mesozoic (Cretaceous period) the whole region,\r\nwith some local exceptions, has been worn down to a comparatively\r\nsmooth plain (peneplain) not far above sea level. Local exceptions\r\nwere mainly in the New York and New England region as, for example,\r\nsome of the higher parts of the Adirondack and White Mountains, Mount\r\nMonadnock in southern New Hampshire, and Mount Greylock in western\r\nMassachusetts. These and other masses rose rather conspicuously above\r\nthe general level of the great plain of erosion commonly called the\r\n\"Cretaceous peneplain\" because it is believed to have been well\r\ndeveloped by the close of that period.\r\n\r\nThe uplift of the vast Cretaceous peneplain about the beginning of\r\nthe Cenozoic era (Tertiary period) was an event of prime importance\r\nin the recent geological history of eastern North America because\r\nit was literally the initial step in bringing about nearly all of\r\nthe existing major relief features of the Appalachian-New York-New\r\nEngland-St. Lawrence region. The amount of uplift (unaccompanied by\r\nfolding) of the peneplain was commonly from a few hundred to a few\r\nthousand feet with the greatest amount in general along the main trend\r\nof the Appalachians. The fact should be emphasized that nearly all the\r\nprincipal topographic features of the great upraised region have been\r\nproduced by dissection (erosion) of the uplifted peneplain surface.\r\nThus nearly all the valleys, small and large, including those of the\r\nSt. Lawrence, Hudson, Mohawk, Connecticut, and Susquehanna, have been\r\ncarved out by streams since the uplift of the great peneplain.\r\n\r\nThe streams which flowed upon the old low-lying peneplain surface\r\nmeandered sluggishly over deep alluvial or flood-plain deposits, and\r\ntheir courses were little if any determined by the character and\r\nstructure of the underlying rocks, because, with few exceptions, all\r\nrocks were worn down to the general plain level. The uplift of the\r\npeneplain, however, caused great revival of activity of erosive power\r\nby the streams, the larger ones of which soon cut through the loose\r\nsuperficial alluvial deposits and then into the underlying bedrock.\r\nThus the large, original streams had their courses well determined in\r\nthe overlying deposits, and when the underlying rocks were reached\r\nthe same courses had to be pursued entirely without reference to the\r\nunderlying rock character and structure. Such streams are said to be\r\n\"superimposed\" because they have, so to speak, been let down upon and\r\ninto the underlying rock masses. As Professor Berkey has well said:\r\n\"The larger rivers, the great master streams, of the superimposed\r\ndrainage system, in some cases were so efficient in the corrosion of\r\ntheir channels that the discovery of discordant structures (in the\r\nunderlying rocks) has not been of sufficient influence to displace\r\nthem, or reverse them, or even to shift them very far from their\r\noriginal direct course to the sea. They cut directly across mountain\r\nridges because they flowed over the plain out of which these ridges\r\nhave been carved, and because their own erosive and transporting power\r\nhave exceeded those of any of their tributaries or neighbors.\"\r\n\r\nFine examples of such superimposed streams which are now entirely\r\nout of harmony with the structure of regions through which they flow\r\nare the Susquehanna, Delaware, and Hudson. Thus the Susquehanna cuts\r\nacross a whole succession of Appalachian ridges while, in accordance\r\nwith the same explanation, the Delaware cuts through the Kittatiny\r\nrange or ridge at the famous Delaware Water Gap. The ridges are\r\nexplained as follows: while the great master streams were cutting deep\r\ntrenches or channels in hard and soft rock alike, numerous side streams\r\n(tributaries) came into existence and naturally mostly developed\r\nalong belts of weak, easily eroded rock parallel to geologic (folded)\r\nstructure. Thus the Appalachian valleys have been, and are being,\r\nformed, while the ridges represent the more resistant rock formations\r\nwhich have more effectually stood out against erosion. The lower Hudson\r\nRiver flows at a considerable angle across folded formations above the\r\nHighlands, after which it passes though a deep gorge which it has cut\r\ninto the hard granite and other rocks of the Highlands. The simple\r\nexplanation is that the Hudson had its course determined upon the\r\nsurface of the upraised Cretaceous peneplain, and that it has been able\r\nto keep that course in spite of discordant structure and character of\r\nthe underlying rocks. In a similar manner we may readily account for\r\nthe passage of the Connecticut River through a great gap in the Holyoke\r\nridge or range of hard lava in western Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this part of our discussion we shall briefly present\r\nsome evidence showing that the New York-New England-St. Lawrence region\r\nat least must have been considerably higher shortly before the Ice Age\r\n(Quaternary period). An old channel of the Hudson River has been traced\r\nabout 100 miles eastward beyond the present mouth of the river and it\r\nforms a distinct trench under the shallow sea in the continental shelf.\r\nEven in the Hudson Valley, many miles above New York City, the bedrock\r\nbottom of the river lies hundreds of feet (near West Point, 800 feet)\r\nbelow sea level. Obviously this submerged channel must have been cut\r\nwhen the land in the general vicinity of New York City was fully 1,000\r\nfeet higher than at present. That the land thus stood higher late in\r\nthe Tertiary and possibly early in the Quaternary periods is proved as\r\nfollows: (1) because most of Tertiary time must have been needed for\r\nthe river to erode such a deep valley after the initial uplift of the\r\npeneplain about the beginning of the period; and (2) because glacial\r\ndeposits of Quaternary age filled the former channel to a considerable\r\ndepth. The valleys of the coast of Maine, and the submerged lower St.\r\nLawrence Valley (Gulf of St. Lawrence), in a similar way lead us to\r\nconclude that the region farther north was also notably higher just\r\nbefore the Ice Age.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern hemisphere early in the Tertiary period a great\r\nsubmergence set in and marine waters spread over much of western and\r\nsouthern Europe, northern Africa, and southern Asia. The sites of the\r\nHimalayas, Alps, Pyrenees, Apennines and other mountains were then\r\nmostly submerged. A very remarkable marine deposit, made up almost\r\nwholly of carbonate of lime shells of a single-celled animal called\r\nNummulites, formed on the floor of this vastly expanded early Tertiary\r\nmediterranean. This rock attains a thickness of several thousand feet.\r\nIt is doubtful if any other single formation made up almost entirely of\r\nthe shells of but one species is at once so widespread and thick. In\r\nthe Alps this remarkable marine deposit may be seen 10,000 feet above\r\nsea level, and in Tibet fully 20,000 feet. Much of the rock in the\r\nEgyptian pyramids was quarried from this formation.\r\n\r\nLater in the Tertiary in Eurasia and Africa the marine waters\r\ngradually became very restricted, so that by the close of the period\r\nthe relations of land and sea were not strikingly different from\r\nthe present, although northwestern Europe, like northeastern North\r\nAmerica, was notably higher just before the Ice Age than it is to-day.\r\n\r\nEurasia witnessed tremendous crustal disturbances during the middle and\r\nlater Tertiary time when, due to intense folding and uplift of great\r\nzones, the Himalayas, Caucasus, Alps, Pyrenees, Apennines, and other\r\ngreat ranges were formed. The crustal disturbance was most remarkable\r\nin the region of the Alps, where the movement resulted in \"elevating\r\nand folding the Tertiary and older strata into overturned, recumbent,\r\nand nearly horizontal folds, and pushing the southern or Lepontine Alps\r\nabout sixty miles (over a low angle fault fracture) to the northward\r\ninto the Helvetic region. Erosion has since carved up these overthrust\r\nsheets, leaving remnants lying on foundations which belong to a more\r\nnorthern portion of the ancient (early Tertiary) sea. Most noted of\r\nthese residuals of overthrust masses is the Matterhorn, a mighty\r\nmountain without roots, a stranger in a foreign geologic environment.\"\r\n(C. Schuchert.)\r\n\r\nThe last period of geological time--the Quaternary--was ushered in\r\nby the spreading of vast sheets of ice over much of northern North\r\nAmerica and northern Europe, and this ranks among the most interesting\r\nand remarkable events of known geological time. On first thought the\r\nformer existence of such vast ice sheets seems unbelievable, but the\r\nIce Age occurred so short a time ago that the records of the event\r\nare perfectly clear and conclusive. The fact of this great Ice Age\r\nwas discovered by Louis Agassiz in 1837, and fully announced before\r\nthe British Scientific Association in 1840. For some years the idea\r\nwas opposed, especially by advocates of the so-called iceberg theory.\r\nNow, however, no important event of earth history is more firmly\r\nestablished, and no student of the subject ever questions the fact of\r\nthe Quaternary Ice Age.\r\n\r\nSome of the proofs of the former presence of the great ice sheet\r\nare as follows: (1) polished and striated rock surfaces which are\r\nprecisely like those produced by existing glaciers, and which could not\r\npossibly have been produced by any other agency; (2) glacial bowlders\r\nor \"erratics\" which are often somewhat rounded and scratched, and\r\nwhich have often been transported many miles from their parent rock\r\nledges (Plate 20); (3) true glacial moraines, especially terminal\r\nmoraines, like that which extends the full length of Long Island and\r\nmarks the southernmost limit of the great ice sheet; and (4) the\r\ngenerally widespread distribution over most of the glaciated area of\r\nheterogeneous glacial débris, both unstratified and stratified, which\r\nis clearly transported material and typically rests upon the bedrock by\r\nsharp contact.\r\n\r\nThe best known existing great ice sheets are those of Greenland and\r\nAntarctica, especially the former, which covers about 500,000 square\r\nmiles. This glacier is so large and deep that only an occasional high\r\nrocky mountain projects above its surface, and the ice is known to\r\nbe slowly moving outward in all directions from the interior to the\r\nmargins of Greenland. Along the margins, where melting is more rapid,\r\nsome land is exposed, and often the ice flows out into the ocean where\r\nit breaks off to form large icebergs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.--Map of North America showing the area buried\r\nunder ice during the Great Ice Age of the Quaternary period; the three\r\ngreat glacial centers; and the extent of mountain glaciers in the west.\r\n(After U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying map shows the area of nearly 4,000,000 square miles\r\nof North America covered by ice at the time of maximum glaciation, and\r\nalso the three great centers of accumulation and dispersal of the ice.\r\nThe directions of flow from these centers have been determined by the\r\nstudy of the directions of many thousands of glacial scratches on rock\r\nledges. The Labradorean (or Laurentide) glacier spread out 1,600 miles\r\nto the south to Long Island and near the mouth of the Ohio River. The\r\nvast Keewatin glacier sent a great lobe of ice nearly as far south,\r\nthat is into northern Missouri. \"One of the most marvelous features of\r\nthe ice dispersion was the great extension of the Keewatin sheet from\r\na low flat center westward and southward over what is now a semiarid\r\nplain, rising in the direction in which the ice moved, while the\r\nmountain glaciers on the west (Cordilleran region), where now known,\r\npushed eastward but little beyond the foot-hills.\" (Chamberlin and\r\nSalisbury.)\r\n\r\nThe Labradorean and Keewatin ice sheets everywhere coalesced except in\r\ntwo places. One of these is an area of about 10,000 square miles mostly\r\nin southwestern Wisconsin. In spite of several ice invasions during\r\nthe Ice Age, this area, hundreds of miles north of the southern limit\r\nof the ice sheets, was never ice-covered. There is a total absence\r\nof records of glaciation within this area, and so we here have an\r\nexcellent sample of the kind of topography which prevailed over the\r\nnorthern Mississippi Valley just before the advent of the ice. A much\r\nsmaller, nonglaciated area occurs in northeastern Missouri near the\r\nsouthern limit of ice extension.\r\n\r\nThe Cordilleran ice sheet was the smallest of the three, and it was\r\nprobably not such a continuous mass of ice, the higher mountains\r\nprojecting above its surface. A surprising fact is that neither\r\nthis ice sheet nor any other overspread northern Alaska, which is\r\nwell within the Arctic Circle, during the Ice Age. More than likely\r\nthe temperature was low enough, but precipitation of snow was not\r\nsufficient to permit the building up of a great glacier.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that nearly 4,000,000 square miles of North America\r\nwere ice-covered, about 600,000 square miles of northern Europe\r\nwere buried under ice which spread from the one great center over\r\nScandinavia southwest, south, and southeast over most of the British\r\nIsles, well into Germany, and well into Russia.\r\n\r\nIn both North America and Europe the high mountains, well south of the\r\ngreat glacier limits, especially the Sierras, Rockies, Alps, Pyrenees,\r\nand Caucasus, supported many large local glaciers in valleys which now\r\ncontain none at all or only relatively small ones.\r\n\r\nRecords of glaciation, such as glacial scratches, bowlders, lakes,\r\netc., occur high up in the White and Green Mountains, Adirondacks,\r\nCatskills, and the Berkshire Hills, thus proving that the ice must\r\nhave been at least some thousands of feet thick over New England\r\nand New York. We have good reason to believe that even the highest\r\nsummits, except possibly in the Catskills, from 4,000 to over 6,000\r\nfeet above sea level, were completely submerged under the ice. On top\r\nof a mountain of Archeozoic granite nearly 4,000 feet in altitude,\r\nfacing the St. Lawrence Valley in northern New York, the writer has\r\nfound many fragments of sandstone which were picked off by the ice in\r\nthe low valley, moved southward a good many miles, and uphill several\r\nthousand feet to the top of the mountain. The reader may wonder how a\r\ngreat glacier at least a mile thick in northern New York could have\r\nthinned out to disappearance within the short distance to the southern\r\nborder of the State, but observations on existing large glaciers show\r\nthat it is quite the habit for them to thin out very rapidly near their\r\nmargins, thus producing steep ice fronts.\r\n\r\nThe fact that glacial ice flows as though it were a viscous substance\r\nis well known from studies of valley glaciers in the Alps and Alaska,\r\nand the great ice sheet of Greenland. A common assumption, either that\r\nthe land at one of the great centers of ice accumulation during the Ice\r\nAge must have been many thousands of feet higher, or that the ice must\r\nthere have been immensely thick, in order to permit ice flowage so far\r\nout from the center, is not necessary. Viscous tar slowly poured upon\r\na level surface will gradually flow out in all directions, and at no\r\ntime need the tar at the center of accumulation be very much thicker\r\nthan elsewhere. The movement of glacial ice from the great centers of\r\ndispersal during the Ice Age was much the same in principle, only in\r\nthe case of the glaciers the accumulations of snow and ice were by no\r\nmeans confined to the immediate centers.\r\n\r\nThe fronts of the vast ice sheets, like those of ordinary valley\r\nglaciers, must have undergone many advances and retreats of greater\r\nor less consequence. In the northern Mississippi Valley, and also in\r\nEurope, there is positive proof for five or six important advances and\r\nretreats of the ice which gave rise to the true interglacial stages.\r\nThe strongest evidence is the presence of successive layers of glacial\r\n(morainic) débris piled one upon another, a given layer often having\r\nbeen oxidized, eroded, and even covered with plant life before the\r\nnext or overlying layer was deposited. Such is the condition of things\r\nthroughout much of Iowa, where wells sunk into the glacial deposits\r\ncommonly pass through layers of partly decomposed vegetable matter\r\nat depths of from 100 to 300 feet. Near Toronto, Canada, the finding\r\nof warm climate plants between two glacial deposits proves that the\r\nclimate there during an interglacial stage was much like that of the\r\nsouthern States to-day. During the great interglacial stages the vast\r\nglaciers were notably restricted in size, and in some or possibly all,\r\ncases they may have wholly disappeared from the continent.\r\n\r\nIn former years there was a tendency to ascribe mighty erosive power\r\nto the vast slow-moving ice sheets, but to-day scarcely any geologist\r\nwould hold that the ice really produced large valleys solely by ice\r\nerosion, or that mountains were notably cut down. Throughout the\r\nglaciated region, especially toward the north, the deep preglacial\r\nresidual soils and rotten rocks were nearly all scoured off by the\r\npassage of the ice. That the ice, where properly shod with rock\r\nfragments, actually eroded to at least little depths into hard and\r\nfresh rocks is well known, but the evidence is clear and conclusive\r\nthat the preglacial hills and mountains, and most of the valleys\r\n(including all the large ones), were rarely more than a little modified\r\nin shape and size.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal effects of the Ice Age is the widespread\r\ndistribution of glacial deposits, and other deposits which were formed\r\nunder water in direct association with the ice. Such materials have\r\nbeen described in the chapter on \"Glaciers and Their Work.\"\r\n\r\nAs a direct result of the Ice Age, many thousands of lakes came into\r\nexistence throughout the glaciated region where few, if any, previously\r\nexisted. Many of these lasted only while the ice was present because\r\ntheir waters were held up by walls of ice acting as dams. Thousands\r\nof others still persist, most of these having their water levels\r\nmaintained by dams of glacial débris left by the ice across valleys.\r\nGood examples of lakes of both types, including a summary of the\r\nremarkable history of the Great Lakes, are considered in the chapter on\r\n\"A Study of Lakes.\"\r\n\r\nMany drainage changes, gorges, and waterfalls have also directly\r\nresulted from the great Ice Age. In fact it is not too much to say\r\nthat practically all true gorges and waterfalls of the glaciated\r\nregion have originated as a direct result of the Ice Age. The most\r\nremarkable combination of waterfall and gorge thus produced is that of\r\nthe world-famous Niagara, described in the chapter on \"Stream Work.\"\r\nNot only are Niagara Falls and gorge of postglacial origin but there\r\nwas no Niagara River as such before the Ice Age. In New York the\r\nwell-known Ausable Chasm, Trenton Falls Gorge, and Watkins Glen are all\r\nexcellent examples of gorges cut since the Ice Age by streams which,\r\nbecause their old valleys were filled with glacial débris, have been\r\nforced to take new courses. A gorge of very special interest is that at\r\nLittle Falls in central New York. This gorge, two miles long, with its\r\nprecipitous walls hundreds of feet high, is the most important gateway\r\nfor traffic between the Atlantic border and the Great Lakes region.\r\nThe bottom of this defile contains six tracks of the New York Central\r\nand West Shore Railroads, the Barge Canal, an important highway, and\r\nthe Mohawk River. Before the Ice Age there was a stream divide instead\r\nof a gorge, several hundred feet above the present river level. During\r\na late stage of the Ice Age, when the Great Lakes drained through the\r\nMohawk Valley, a tremendous volume of water passed over the divide and\r\ncut it down to form nearly all of the gorge except the inner or bottom\r\ntrench which has since been eroded by the Mohawk River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.--Sketch map of the region between Lake George\r\nand Schenectady, New York, showing how certain of the main drainage\r\ncourses have been revolutionized by the great retreating ice sheet and\r\nthe deposits it left. Preglacial courses shown by dotted lines only\r\nwhere essentially different from the present streams. (By the author,\r\nas published by New York State Museum.)]\r\n\r\nOnly a few of the numerous stream changes directly due to the Ice Age\r\nwill be briefly referred to. Certain of the principles involved are\r\nexceptionally well illustrated in the general vicinity of Saratoga\r\nSprings and Lake George, New York. During the retreat of the great\r\nglacier a lobe of ice occupied the Lake George Valley and forced the\r\nHudson River west over a divide at Stony Creek. Then, because of heavy\r\nglacial deposits near Corinth, the Hudson could not continue south\r\nthrough what had been the preglacial valley of Luzerne River, but it\r\nwas forced eastward over a divide in a low mountain ridge to Glens\r\nFalls. The remarkable shift of the Sacandaga River from its preglacial\r\nchannel was caused by the building up of a great morainic ridge across\r\nthe valley in the vicinity of Broadalbin.\r\n\r\nThe drainage of the basin of the upper Ohio River has also been\r\nrevolutionized as a result of the glaciation. All the drainage of\r\nwestern Pennsylvania passed northward into Lake Erie just before the\r\nIce Age instead of southwestward through the Ohio River as at present.\r\n\r\nRivers as large as the Mississippi and the Missouri were also more\r\nor less locally deflected from their preglacial courses. Thus the\r\nMissouri, which in preglacial time followed the James River Valley of\r\neastern South Dakota, was forced, by a great lobe of retreating ice, to\r\nfind its present course many miles farther west.\r\n\r\nHow long ago did the Ice Age end? In seeking an answer to this question\r\nwe should bear in mind not only the fact that the Ice Age ended at\r\ndifferent times, according to latitude, the more southern districts\r\nhaving been first freed from ice, but also the fact that approximately\r\n4,000,000 square miles of the polar regions are now ice-covered, so\r\nthat in a real sense those portions of the earth are still in an Ice\r\nAge. Some of the best estimates of the length of postglacial time for\r\na given place are based upon the rate of recession of Niagara Falls,\r\nthe average of the estimates being about 25,000 years. The evidence for\r\nthis conclusion is briefly set forth in Chapter III. A careful study of\r\nthe rate of recession of St. Anthony Falls, Minnesota, has led to the\r\nconclusion that the last retreat of the ice occurred there from 10,000\r\nto 16,000 years ago. Certain clays deposited under tidewater since\r\nthe last withdrawal of ice in Sweden show a remarkable succession of\r\nalternating layers thought to represent seasonal changes. By counting\r\nthe layers it has been estimated that Stockholm was freed from ice only\r\n9,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nAlthough the actual duration of the Ice Age is by no means accurately\r\nknown, we can be quite sure that the time represented is far longer\r\nthan that of postglacial time. That it must have lasted fully 500,000\r\nyears seems certain when due consideration is given to amount of time\r\nnecessary to bring about the repeated changes of climate between the\r\nglacial and interglacial stages; the amount of plant accumulation\r\nduring the interglacial stages; the amount of weathering and erosion\r\nof the various layers of glacial deposits. Some estimates run as high\r\nas 1,500,000 years for the duration of the Ice Age, and an average is\r\nabout 1,000,000 years, which probably indicates, at least roughly, the\r\norder of magnitude of the time involved.\r\n\r\nWhen it is considered not only that the fact of the great Ice Age\r\nwas not even thought of until 1837, but also that many factors enter\r\ninto the general problem of the climate of geologic time, it is not\r\nsurprising that the cause (or causes) of the glacial climate is still\r\nnot definitely known. A few of the various hypotheses which have been\r\nadvocated to account for the glacial climate will now be very briefly\r\nreferred to. One is that the increased cold (not more than 10 to 15\r\ndegrees for the yearly average) was brought about by the notably\r\nincreased altitudes of late Tertiary and early Quaternary times in\r\nnorthern North America and Europe. In this connection it is interesting\r\nto note that the four times of real glaciation during geologic time\r\n(mid-Proterozoic, early Paleozoic, late Paleozoic, and early Cenozoic)\r\ndid occur directly after great crustal disturbances and notable uplifts\r\nof land. According to this hypothesis the interglacial stages would\r\nhave to be explained by a rather unreasonable assumption of repeated\r\nrising and sinking of the glaciated lands.\r\n\r\nAnother hypothesis, long held in favor, is based upon certain\r\nastronomical considerations. Thus we now have winter in the northern\r\nhemisphere when the earth is nearest the sun, but in about 10,500\r\nyears, due to wobbling of the earth on its axis, our winter will occur\r\nwhen the earth is farthest from the sun, thus making the winters longer\r\nand colder, and the summers shorter and hotter. After a much longer\r\nperiod of time the earth will be millions of miles farther from the\r\nsun in winter than in summer and this would still further accentuate\r\nthe length and coldness of the winters. The interglacial stages\r\nrepresent the 10,500 year periods when the earth in winter (northern\r\nhemisphere) is nearest the sun. A difficulty in the way of accepting\r\nthis hypothesis is that it is inconceivable that each glacial and\r\ninterglacial stage lasted only 10,500 years. Another objection to the\r\nhypothesis as an explanation of Ice Ages is that it is directly opposed\r\nby the fact of widespread glaciation at low latitudes either side of\r\nthe equator during the late Paleozoic Ice Age.\r\n\r\nAnother hypothesis is based upon variations in quantity of carbonic\r\nacid gas and water vapor in the air. Increase or decrease of these\r\nconstituents causes increase or decrease of temperature because they\r\nhave high capacities for absorbing heat. \"The great elevation of the\r\nland at the close of the Tertiary seems to afford conditions favorable\r\nboth for the consumption of carbon dioxide in large quantities (by\r\nweathering of rocks) and for the reduction of the water content of\r\nthe air. Depletion of these heat-absorbing elements was equivalent\r\nto the thinning of the thermal blanket which they constitute. If it\r\nwas thinned, the temperature was reduced.... By variations in the\r\nconsumption of carbon dioxide, especially in its absorption and escape\r\nfrom the ocean, the hypothesis attempts to explain the periodicity of\r\nglaciation (i.e., glacial and interglacial stages).\" (Chamberlin and\r\nSalisbury.)\r\n\r\nStill another suggested explanation is based upon variability of amount\r\nof heat radiated by the sun. Slight variations are now known to take\r\nplace, and possibly in the past during certain periods of time these\r\nvariations may have been sufficiently great to cause a glacial climate\r\nwith interglacial stages.\r\n\r\nHere, as in the case of so many other great natural phenomena, a\r\nsingle, simple explanation does not seem sufficient to account for all\r\nthe features of the several well-known glacial epochs of geologic time.\r\nTwo or more hypotheses, or parts of hypotheses, must more than likely\r\nbe combined to explain a particular Ice Age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OF PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nHave we any knowledge regarding the beginning of life on our planet?\r\nOur answer to this question must be decidedly in the negative. We can,\r\nhowever, be very positive in regard to two important matters concerning\r\nlife in early geological time, namely, that plants must have existed\r\nbefore animals, and that the very oldest known (Archeozoic) rocks of\r\nthe earth contain vestiges of organisms. We may be sure that plants\r\npreceded animals because animal life ultimately depends upon plants\r\nfor its food supply or, in other words, all animals could never have\r\nbeen carnivorous. Now, if we can prove that organisms existed during\r\nArcheozoic time, it is evident that plants at least must have lived in\r\nthat oldest known era of earth history. That living things did then\r\nexist is proved by the common occurrence of graphite, a crystallized\r\nform of carbon, in the oldest known of the Archeozoic rocks. The facts\r\nthat flakes of graphite are abundantly scattered through many layers of\r\nstrata of Archeozoic Age, and that adjacent layers of strata contain\r\nsuch varying amounts of graphite, render it practically certain that\r\nsuch graphite represents the carbon of organisms. Graphite existing\r\nunder such conditions could not be of igneous origin. Carbonaceous\r\nor bituminous strata, so called because they contain more or less\r\ndecomposed organic matter, would, when crystallized under conditions\r\nof metamorphism, yield graphite-bearing rocks exactly like those of\r\nArcheozoic Age, and there is every reason to believe that this was\r\ntheir origin. But, since only graphite (carbon) of the Archeozoic\r\norganisms remains, the rest having disappeared through chemical change\r\nor decomposition, it is impossible to say whether much or all of it\r\nrepresents original plants or animals. In any case we can be very sure\r\nabout the existence of plants (probably very simple or primitive types)\r\nin Archeozoic time, but the presence of any form of animal life has not\r\nbeen proved.\r\n\r\nIn the next, or Proterozoic era, some plants and animals of definite\r\ntypes are known to have existed and, from here on in the present\r\nchapter, it is our purpose to consider the salient points in the\r\ngeological history of plants, taking up the main types in the regular\r\norder of their appearance from the remote Proterozoic days to the\r\npresent. The very oldest known definitely determinable fossils of any\r\nkind are the more or less rounded masses of crudely concentric layers\r\nof carbonate of lime from one to fifteen inches in diameter found in\r\nmiddle Proterozoic limestone of western Ontario, Canada. Similar forms\r\nare abundant in late Proterozoic strata of Montana. They occur in large\r\nnumbers as layers or reefs, in many cases repeating themselves through\r\nhundreds or even thousands of feet of strata. Careful studies have\r\nshown that these forms are the limey secretions of some of the very\r\nsimplest types of plants, that is thallophytes (e.g., seaweeds), which\r\nlived in water.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to describe the plants of Paleozoic and later time,\r\nthe reader should be impressed with the important fact that plants of\r\nhigher and higher types came into existence throughout geological time\r\nin almost exactly the botanical order of their classification, that\r\nis to say, from the very simplest types (thallophytes) of Proterozoic\r\ntime there were gradually evolved, through the long geological ages,\r\nhigher and higher plant forms reaching a climax in the complex\r\nand highly organized plants of the present time. This is the most\r\nsignificant general fact in regard to the geological history of plants.\r\nFor the convenience of the reader the largest subdivisions in the\r\nclassification of plants are here given.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS\r\n\r\n  I.   Cryptogams      {1. Thallophytes (e.g., seaweeds, mushrooms)\r\n       (seedless and   {2. Bryophytes (e.g., mosses)\r\n         flowerless)   {3. Pteridophytes (e.g., \"club mosses,\"\r\n                             \"horsetails,\" ferns)\r\n\r\n  II.  Pteridosperms   {\r\n       (seed-bearing,  { (e.g., seed ferns--wholly extinct)\r\n         flowerless)   {\r\n\r\n  III. Phanerogams     {1. Gymnosperms (e.g., cycads, conifers)\r\n       (seed-bearing,  {2. Angiosperms (e.g., grasses, lilies,\r\n         flowering)    {     oaks, roses)\r\n\r\nThroughout the first two periods--Cambrian and Ordovician--of the\r\nPaleozoic era, plant life appears to have made little or no progress\r\ntoward higher forms. The very simple Thallophytes (e.g., seaweeds)\r\ncontinued to secrete concentric layers of carbonate of lime in almost\r\nexactly the same way as during the middle and late Proterozoic era.\r\nRemarkable reefs of such forms occur in the late Cambrian limestone\r\nnear Saratoga Springs, New York, where one locality has been set aside\r\nas a state park. During the Ordovician there were seaweeds of the more\r\nfamiliar branching types without carbonate of lime supports, and these\r\nhave left very perfect impressions in some of the Ordovician strata.\r\n\r\nDuring the Silurian period seaweeds continued, as, in fact, they did\r\nthroughout succeeding geologic time to the present. The Silurian strata\r\nseem to contain some vestiges of the first-known land plants, though\r\nthe records are meager and some of the specimens are of a doubtful\r\ncharacter. Most interesting of all is a fern or fernlike plant found\r\nin France. When we consider the profusion of land plants (all of\r\nrelatively simple types) of the next or Devonian period, it seems\r\ncertain that their progenitors must have existed in the Silurian, and\r\ntheir remains may very likely be discovered.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the Devonian period of the Paleozoic era the records\r\nshow that important advances had taken place in the evolution of the\r\nplant kingdom. Among the very simple Thallophyte plants some seaweeds\r\nof unusually large size occur in fossil form, but the important\r\nfact is that all the principal subdivisions of the typical higher\r\nnon-flowering plants (Pteridophytes) as well as Pteridosperms, and even\r\nsome primitive representatives of the lower order flowering plants\r\n(gymnosperms) were well represented in the Devonian. Our knowledge\r\nof land plants earlier than the Devonian amounts to almost nothing\r\nand they certainly could not have been at all prominent, but the\r\nfossil records make it very clear that many Devonian land areas were\r\nclad with rich and diversified plant life. There were even forests,\r\nprobably the first on earth, but they were far different, both in\r\ngeneral and in particular, from those of to-day because the trees\r\nwere all of exceptionally low organization types. During the next two\r\nperiods--Mississippian and Pennsylvanian--there was no really important\r\nprogress in the evolution of plants, and since these remarkable\r\ntypes of land plants have left such wonderfully preserved records in\r\nstrata of the Pennsylvanian or great Coal Age, we shall proceed to\r\ndescriptions of the main types of that time, especially those which\r\ncontributed to the formation of beds of coal.\r\n\r\nAs shown by the abundant records, the land plant life of Pennsylvanian\r\ntime must have been not only prolific but exceedingly varied. Thousands\r\nof species have been unearthed from the coal-bearing formations\r\nalone, and these must represent only a fraction of all species of\r\nplants which lived during the period. Most prominent of all were\r\nthe giant Lycopods constituting the lowest main subdivision of the\r\nPteridophytes (see above classification). These great, non-flowering\r\nplants were at once the biggest, most common and conspicuous trees of\r\nthe extensive swamp forests, and they were the greatest contributors\r\nto the formation of coal (Plate 15). Many species have been described.\r\nThey commonly attained heights of 50 to 100 feet and diameters of 2 to\r\n6 feet. In one important type the fairly numerous branches bristled\r\nwith stiff, needle-shaped leaves. When the leaves dropped off the\r\nolder or trunk portions, scars were left spirally arranged around the\r\ntrunks of the trees. In another important type the leaf scars were\r\nvertically arranged on the lower portions of the tree trunks. The upper\r\nportions of the trunks (rarely branched) were thickly set with long,\r\nslender leaves, which in some species were two or three feet long. An\r\ninteresting fact is that the inner parts of the trunks of the great\r\nLycopods were filled with soft, pithy material. This explains why the\r\nfossil trees are nearly always flattened out, as a result of burial\r\nwithin the earth. The nonbranching type of Lycopod has been totally\r\nextinct for millions of years, while the branching type is to-day\r\nrepresented only by small, mostly delicate, trailing plants familiarly\r\nknown as \"club mosses\" and \"ground pines.\" The most conspicuous\r\ntrees of the great Pennsylvanian lowlands and swamps have, indeed,\r\nleft meager modern representatives, and here we have an excellent\r\nillustration of a once prominent group of plants which has dwindled\r\naway almost to extinction.\r\n\r\nAnother common type of Pennsylvanian vegetation was the so-called\r\n\"horsetail\" plant or giant rush. The much smaller scouring rush,\r\nrepresented by several species to-day, is the direct descendant of\r\nthis type which, during later Paleozoic time, grew to be 50 to 90 feet\r\nhigh and 1 to 2 feet in diameter. The long, slender trunks filled with\r\npith were segmented with variously shaped leaves arranged in whorls\r\naround the joints. A fine, vertical-fluted structure without leaf scars\r\ncharacterized the surfaces of the trunk.\r\n\r\nRecent study has shown that many of the Pennsylvanian plants, long\r\nclassed as true ferns, were really \"seed ferns,\" as described below.\r\nMany of the true ferns grew to be real trees up to fifty or sixty feet\r\nhigh, but all Paleozoic types were primitive in structure as compared\r\nwith modern ferns.\r\n\r\nVery remarkable among the later Paleozoic plants were the\r\nPteridosperms, represented by the so-called \"seed ferns.\" These now\r\nwholly extinct plants seem to have formed the connecting link between\r\nthe seedless, flowerless plants (Cryptogams) and the seed-bearing,\r\nflowering plants (Phanerogams), because they bore seeds but not\r\nflowers. Many of them were small and herbaceous, but others were tall\r\ntrees, in general appearance resembling the tree ferns. \"Seed ferns,\"\r\nwhich play such an important part in the evolution of plants, are not\r\nknown to have existed after Paleozoic time.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter half of the Paleozoic era some very primitive types\r\nof flowering plants (Gymnosperms) existed. Most abundant of these were\r\nthe so-called Cordaites, which were the tallest trees of the time,\r\nsome having reached heights of over 100 feet. The upper portions only\r\nbore numerous branches supplied with many simple, parallel-veined,\r\nstrap-shaped leaves up to six feet long and six inches wide. Excepting\r\nthe pithy cores the trunks of these trees were of real wood covered\r\nwith thick bark. Trees of this kind became extinct in the early\r\nMesozoic era.\r\n\r\nVery late in the Paleozoic (Permian period) two other types of the\r\nsimple flowering plants (Gymnosperms) made their appearance. These were\r\nthe cycads and conifers, which were the most conspicuous trees during\r\nthe first two periods of the Mesozoic era. The cycads reached their\r\nculmination in the Jurassic period, but they still exist in modified\r\nform in some parts of the world. The short, stout trunk was crowned\r\nwith long, stiff, palm-like leaves. In fact, the cycads are distantly\r\nrelated to the palms, which belong to a higher group of plants. Some\r\nspecimens of cycads, especially from the Mesozoic strata of South\r\nDakota, are so wonderfully fossilized that even the detailed structures\r\nof trunks, leaves, flowers, and seeds are so perfectly preserved that\r\nalmost as much is known about these plants of millions of years ago as\r\nthough they were living forms.\r\n\r\nThe conifers, with which are classed present-day pines, spruces, and\r\nmany other evergreen trees, gradually took on a more modern aspect, so\r\nthat late in the Mesozoic era they were much like those now living.\r\nAmong the most interesting trees were the sequoias, to which the\r\nliving \"big trees\" and red-woods of California belong. These began in\r\nrelatively late Mesozoic time, reached their climax in numbers, variety\r\nof species, and widespread distribution in the early Cenozoic era;\r\nand are now almost extinct, being represented by only two species in\r\nlocal portions of California. Cordaites, trees which were so large and\r\nabundant in later Paleozoic time, were reduced to extinction in the\r\nearly Mesozoic era.\r\n\r\nDuring Mesozoic time the Thallophytes, represented by seaweeds, were\r\ncommon. Among the Pteridophytes the ferns and \"horsetail\" plants\r\nwere fairly common, but the very large forms gradually gave way to\r\nmuch smaller ones during Mesozoic time. The giant Lycopods of later\r\nPaleozoic time dwindled almost to extinction even in early Mesozoic\r\ntime, so that from that time to the present they have been very small\r\nand relatively insignificant.\r\n\r\nTens of millions of years of earth history had passed before the\r\ntrue flowering plants--the Angiosperms--appeared upon the earth. The\r\nCretaceous period marks their advent. So far as known, these plants\r\noriginated along the eastern side of North America, and very soon after\r\ntheir establishment they spread over the earth with amazing rapidity\r\nand dominated the vegetation as they do to-day, more than half of the\r\nexisting species of plants being Angiosperms. Among the common types\r\nwhich have been unearthed from Cretaceous strata are palms, grasses,\r\nmaples, oaks, elms, figs, magnolias, willows, beeches, chestnuts, and\r\npoplars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 13.--A Slab of Very Early Paleozoic (Cambrian)\r\nRock, Covered with Some of the Oldest Known Definitely Determinable\r\nAnimal Remains. These creatures lived in a sea which overspread the\r\nsite of the Rocky Mountains of southern Canada fully 25,000,000 years\r\nago. Most of the fossils are trilobites (including some very small\r\nones) and other related crustacean forms (lighter portions). (_After C.\r\nD. Wolcott, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.

The material was deposited on the floor\r\nof the Ordovician sea which overspread much of the continent. (_Photo\r\nby the author._)]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the higher flowering plants (Angiosperms) \"was,\r\nperhaps, the most important and far-reaching event in the whole\r\nhistory of vegetation, not only because they almost immediately became\r\ndominant, but also because of their influence upon the animal life of\r\nthe succeeding periods. Hardly had flowers appeared, before a great\r\nhorde of insects, which fed upon their honey or pollen, seem to have\r\nsprung into existence. The nutritious grasses and the various nuts,\r\nseeds, and fruits afforded a better food for noncarnivores than ever\r\nbefore in the history of the world. It was to be expected, therefore,\r\nthat some new type of animal life would be developed to take advantage\r\nof this superior food supply. As we shall see in the discussion of\r\nthe Tertiary (next chapter), the mammals, which kept a subordinate\r\nposition throughout the Mesozoic, rapidly took on bulk and variety and\r\nacquired possession of the earth as soon as they became adapted to this\r\nnew food, quickly supplanting the great reptiles of the Mesozoic.\"\r\n(Cleland.)\r\n\r\nDuring the present or Cenozoic era vegetation gradually took on a more\r\nand more modern aspect until the existing species were developed. The\r\ngrasses especially developed and spread rapidly, but the cereals did\r\nnot evolve until late in the era. Certain single-celled plants, called\r\ndiatoms, may be especially mentioned, for they must have literally\r\nswarmed in some of the Tertiary seas which spread over parts of the\r\npresent lands. \"The microscopic plants which form siliceous shells,\r\ncalled diatoms, make extensive deposits in some places. One stratum\r\nnear Richmond, Virginia, is thirty feet thick and is many miles in\r\nextent; another, near Monterey, California, is fifty feet thick, and\r\nthe material is as white and fine as chalk, which it resembles in\r\nappearance; another, near Bilin, in Bohemia, is fourteen feet thick....\r\nEhrenberg has calculated that a cubic inch of the fine, earthy\r\nrock contains about forty-one thousand millions of organisms. Such\r\naccumulations of diatoms are made both in fresh waters and salt, and in\r\nthose of the ocean at all depths.\" (J. D. Dana.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF ANIMALS (EXCLUDING VERTEBRATES)\r\n\r\n\r\nA study of the animals of the past is not only of great interest in\r\nitself, but also it furnishes a mainstay of the great doctrine of\r\norganic evolution. At the very outset of our discussion the reader\r\nshould have already in mind at least the main subdivisions of the\r\nanimal kingdom in order to reasonably well understand where the\r\nimportant animal types of the different geological ages fit in, and\r\nhow those types bear upon the doctrine of evolution. The accompanying,\r\nvery brief, general classification includes the usually recognized\r\nsubkingdoms with special reference to representatives of those which\r\nare of most geological and evolutionary significance. Reading downward\r\nin this classification, the degree of complexity of organization\r\nsteadily increases from single-celled animals to man himself.\r\n\r\n    I.

These conclusions may be summarized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. Animal life existed many millions of years ago.\r\n\r\n2. Not only the animals of to-day, but also those of any given\r\ngeological period, directly descended from those of preceding\r\ngeological periods.\r\n\r\n3. Animal life has undergone continuous change since its introduction\r\nupon the earth, so that each group of strata, representing a particular\r\ngeological age, contains a characteristic assemblage of fossil animals.\r\n\r\n4. Many of the changes in the history of animals have been progressive\r\nor evolutionary, so that strata of early geological time contain\r\ndistinctly more primitive or lower order forms than the strata of late\r\ngeological time. But, while the line of evolution has been maintained\r\nwithout a break, culminating in man, there have been many offshoots of\r\na retrogressive nature.\r\n\r\n5. Even as far along in geological time as the early Paleozoic era,\r\nthe highest subkingdom--vertebrates--had no representative whatever.\r\nIn other words, all the important subdivisions of animal life from a\r\nlittle below fishes to man have been evolved since about the close of\r\nthe Ordovician period.\r\n\r\n6. Any species of animal which ever became extinct has never been known\r\nto reappear, and literally tens of thousands of species are known to\r\nhave become extinct.\r\n\r\n7. No species like those now living are found in the more ancient\r\nstrata, such being confined to the strata of relatively recent\r\ngeological dates.\r\n\r\n8. While more and more highly organized animals have continuously\r\nbeen evolved, many of the earlier and simpler types have persisted,\r\na remarkable case in point being the single-celled animals called\r\nforaminifers which may be traced, without very notable change, through\r\nthe tens of millions of years of geological time from the late\r\nProterozoic era to the present day.\r\n\r\n9. Many species have been able to maintain themselves practically\r\nwithout change through long stretches of geological time, while others\r\nhave had only very brief existence.\r\n\r\nWhen did animal life begin on the earth, and what were the first forms\r\nlike? We can only partially answer the first question by saying that\r\nanimals have existed for tens of millions of years, certainly as early\r\nat least as Proterozoic time. Up to the present time we are utterly\r\nin the dark as to what the earliest animal forms looked like, but we\r\nhave positive knowledge that the oldest forms found as fossils in the\r\nrocks represent creatures which were far more primitive and lower in\r\norganization than many animals of to-day, and that since those oldest\r\nknown forms lived, the animal kingdom has undergone various profound\r\nalterations. In view of the above statements, and also the fact that\r\nthe oldest known plant forms were extremely simple or single-celled,\r\nit is more than likely that the first animal life of the earth was\r\nsingle-celled. In harmony with this view is the fact that fossil\r\nsingle-celled animals are found in the very oldest (Proterozoic) rocks\r\nwhich contain any definitely determinable fossil animals.\r\n\r\nDo the most ancient known rocks show that animal life existed during\r\nArcheozoic time? In the preceding chapter we pointed out the fact that\r\nthe carbon (in the form of graphite), so commonly present in those most\r\nancient known strata, proves the existence of life of some kind during\r\nArcheozoic time. But because nothing like definitely determinable\r\nfossil forms have thus far been discovered in those rocks, we cannot be\r\nsure whether the carbon represents plant or animal life or both, though\r\ncertainly plants of very low order at least must have existed. Because\r\nof the intense alteration (metamorphism) of those very old strata,\r\nall definite forms have long since been obliterated as such. We may,\r\nhowever, in the light of the vast evolution which took place through\r\nsucceeding geological time, be very sure that any animals which may\r\nhave existed during Archeozoic time were in general much simpler forms\r\nthan those of even early Paleozoic time.\r\n\r\nThe early and middle Proterozoic strata throw no more light upon the\r\nearly history of animal life than do the Archeozoic strata. The upper\r\nor later Proterozoic rocks, however, contain the oldest recognizable\r\nanimal fossils. Very recently fossil remains of single-celled,\r\nshell-bearing Protozoans have been found in northern France, while\r\nthe upper Proterozoic strata of the Rocky Mountains in Montana, and\r\nthe Grand Canyon of Arizona have yielded worm tracks, a Molluscoid\r\n(brachiopod) and fragments of lower forms of Arthropods. This record,\r\nalthough very meager, clearly proves that animal life was so well\r\nadvanced by late Proterozoic time, that next to the highest subkingdom\r\nwas actually represented (see above classification), and that there\r\nmust have been a long line of simpler and simpler ancestors, probably\r\nextending far back into the Archeozoic era. When we stop to consider\r\nthat Archeozoic and Proterozoic time was fully as long as all\r\nsucceeding geological time, it is not so surprising that fairly highly\r\ndeveloped animals (except Vertebrates) had been evolved before the\r\nclose of the Proterozoic era.\r\n\r\nIn regard to abundance of fossil animals the oldest (Cambrian)\r\nPaleozoic strata stand out in marked contrast to the Proterozoic. Many\r\nhundreds of species of animal fossils have been described from Cambrian\r\nstrata, and a great many others yet remain to be discovered. Cambrian\r\nfossils are remarkably numerous, varied in species, and complex\r\nin organization (Plate 13). All subkingdoms of animals except the\r\nVertebrates were represented, though usually only by the simpler types\r\nin each subkingdom. It is quite generally agreed that no less than 50\r\nper cent of animal evolution had taken place before the beginning of\r\nthe Cambrian period. The reader should, however, clearly bear in mind\r\nthat tremendous advances in evolution have taken place since early\r\nCambrian time when not only all forms from lower scale Arthropods to\r\nthe highest mammals (including man) have evolved, but also when many\r\nthousands of species of lower subkingdom animals developed.\r\n\r\nWhy are the very early Paleozoic strata so rich in fossils, while the\r\nimmediately preceding Proterozoic rocks show so few? The seemingly\r\nsudden appearance of so many highly developed animals in earliest\r\nPaleozoic (Cambrian) time is one of the most important considerations\r\nin the history of animal life, and it is by no means definitely\r\nunderstood. The following statements bear directly upon the problem:\r\nThe early animal forms were probably soft or gelatinous without shells\r\nand lived mostly in the open sea where food (seaweeds, etc.) was\r\nabundant. Such animals were very unfavorable for preservation in fossil\r\nform. Then, late in Proterozoic time or very early in the Paleozoic,\r\na severe struggle for existence set in, probably due to crowding\r\nalong shores, and hard parts began to develop both for support and\r\ndefensive purposes. Such hard parts or shells were commonly favorable\r\nfor fossilization. This view is strongly supported by the fact that\r\nvery thin shells only are known from late Proterozoic rocks, and mostly\r\nvery thin shells from the earliest Cambrian, the heavier shells having\r\nbeen evolved later. A fact of importance to bear in mind in this\r\nconnection is that just at the critical time (late Proterozoic) in\r\nshell development, the lands of the earth were undergoing widespread\r\nand deep erosion as pointed out early in the chapter on \"Ancient Earth\r\nHistory.\" The earliest Cambrian strata, therefore, nearly everywhere\r\nrest upon the deeply eroded surface of the Proterozoic rocks so that\r\nthe transition strata--the very ones which would contain most fossils\r\nof the early shell development stage--are nearly everywhere missing.\r\nFinally, mention should be made of the fact, that all Archeozoic\r\nstrata are profoundly altered (metamorphosed), and so are nearly\r\nall Proterozoic strata, except the later. Fossils once present in\r\nthose rocks would of course have been obliterated by the process of\r\nmetamorphism, but the fact remains that very considerable thicknesses\r\nof practically unaltered Proterozoic strata show few if any animal\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\nWe shall now proceed to a rather systematic consideration of the most\r\ninteresting and significant types of creatures which have inhabited\r\nthe earth since the beginning of Paleozoic time at least twenty-five\r\nmillion years ago. It is our purpose to bring out the salient features\r\nin the history of each subkingdom of animals, beginning with the lowest\r\nor simplest, and taking up in turn the higher and higher subkingdoms.\r\nBy this method the reader may easily follow the main thread of organic\r\nevolution or progressive change which runs through most of the known\r\nhistory of animal life of our planet, and which is so important in the\r\nscience of geology.\r\n\r\nProtozoans, which include all the tiny single-celled animals, are\r\nknown in fossil form even in late Proterozoic rocks and, as proved by\r\nthe fossil records, they have been more or less abundant ever since,\r\neven now swarming in large portions of the surface sea waters. One of\r\nthe most remarkable facts in the history of animal life is, that such\r\nexceedingly simple creatures persisted almost without change through\r\nthe tens of millions of years when such profound and even revolutionary\r\nchanges took place in the animal kingdom in general. The only fossil\r\nProtozoans are those which developed delicate shells either of\r\ncarbonate of lime (the foraminifers) or silica. Special mention should\r\nbe made of the Cretaceous period when foraminifers must have been\r\nexceedingly profuse in clear sea waters which spread over the Gulf\r\nCoastal Plain of the United States, parts of southern England, much of\r\nFrance, and other areas, as proved by their accumulated shells which\r\nmake up formations of chalk hundreds of feet in thickness and many\r\nmiles in extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.--A compound colony of fossil graptolites\r\ncharacteristic of late Ordovician time, fully 20,000,000 years ago.\r\nEach little prong once held a tiny individual living graptolite which\r\nwas a very simple type of animal belonging to the subkingdom called\r\n\"Coelenterates.\" (Modified after Ruedemann.)]\r\n\r\nThe Coelenterates, which comprise the simplest of the many-celled\r\nanimals, are saclike forms with mouth openings, but with few other\r\ndifferentiations of parts. All are marine animals. Of these the sponges\r\nare porous, and the other types (including corals) have tentacles\r\naround their mouths. Sponges have been more or less common from early\r\nPaleozoic time to the present, and they have undergone relatively\r\nlittle change. \"Jellyfishes,\" which are in truth not fishes at all,\r\nare wholly soft or gelatinous Coelenterates which have left some very\r\nremarkable impressions and casts in strata of very early Paleozoic age,\r\nthose very ancient forms evidently having been almost exactly like\r\nthose of to-day. Graptolites were slender, plumelike, delicate forms\r\nconsisting of colonies of tiny individuals, in many cases in branching\r\nor radiating combinations. They existed only during the first half of\r\nthe Paleozoic era. Both because they floated in the open sea, thus\r\npermitting widespread distribution, and because they underwent many\r\ndistinct species changes during short geologic intervals, they are\r\namong the most useful fossils for separating the various subdivisions\r\nof strata of the earlier Paleozoic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.--Corals, representing the very simple\r\nsubkingdom of animals called \"Coelenterates\": a, fossil shell of an\r\nindividual \"cup coral\" found only in Paleozoic strata; b, a compound or\r\n\"chain coral\" skeleton found only in relatively old Paleozoic strata;\r\nand c, part of a modern coral colony showing living corals.]\r\n\r\nCorals comprise another important branch of the Coelenterates. During\r\nthe Cambrian period there were corallike sponges and possibly simple\r\ncorals, but from the early Ordovician to the present true corals\r\nhave been common, especially in the clearer, warmer seas. Their\r\ncarbonate of lime skeletons have accumulated to help build up great\r\nlimestone formations representing almost every geologic age from early\r\nPaleozoic time to the present. Paleozoic corals were in general\r\nnotably different from those of later time. There were three main\r\ntypes including the compound \"honeycomb\" and \"chain\" types, and the\r\nsolitary or compound \"cup\" type. They all had four, or multiples of\r\nfour, radiating partitions; were rarely branched; and were generally\r\nlarge, some individual cup corals ranging in length from half an inch\r\nto a foot or more. Modern corals (beginning with the Mesozoic) have six\r\nor eight partitions; are nearly all profusely branched; and are mostly\r\ntiny individuals.\r\n\r\nEchinoderms are all marine animals, including the so-called\r\n\"starfishes,\" which are not really fishes. They have body cavity, with\r\ndigestive canal, low order nervous system, and a water circulatory\r\nsystem. Most of them have radially segmented shells or skeletons. The\r\noldest fossil forms are found in Cambrian strata, these being very\r\nsimple or primitive types, with a bladderlike head set on the end of a\r\nsegmented stem, both head and stem having been supported by carbonate\r\nof lime. Such forms lived only to middle Paleozoic time. Ordovician\r\nstrata contain representatives of all the main types of Echinoderms in\r\nwell-fossilized forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.--Fossil Echinoderms or so-called \"starfishes\":\r\na, simple type known as the \"stone lily\" with head, stem, and roots\r\nintact from Silurian strata; b and c, irregular and regular higher type\r\nEchinoderms called \"sea urchins\" from Cretaceous strata.]\r\n\r\nA stemmed Echinoderm of special interest, first known from the\r\nOrdovician, has persisted to the present day. It is the so-called\r\n\"sea lily\" or \"stone lily,\" consisting of a complex, headlike portion\r\nattached to the sea bottom by a long segmented stem, the whole being\r\nsupported by lime carbonate. They were very numerous during the\r\nSilurian, but they seem to have culminated in variety of species and\r\nnumbers of individuals during the Mississippian period when they were\r\nexceedingly profuse. Hundreds of species of \"stone lilies\" are known\r\nfrom Mississippian strata alone, and in certain localities, as at\r\nCrawfordsville, Ind., and Burlington, Ia., the \"stone lily\" remains are\r\nso numerous that when living they must have literally forested parts of\r\nthe sea bottom. From Mississippian time to middle Mesozoic time they\r\noccupied a relatively subordinate position when they again developed in\r\ngreat profusion. The Mesozoic forms were distinctly more like those\r\nof to-day, and it scarcely seems credible that any creature could have\r\ncontained such a multiplicity of hard parts, more than 600,000 segments\r\nhaving been counted in a single fossil from Jurassic strata. The \"sea\r\nlilies\" of to-day are relatively unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe familiar five-pointed \"starfishes,\" so common along our seacoasts,\r\nare first known from the Ordovician, and they persisted through the\r\nmany millions of years to the present time with remarkably little\r\nchange. The so-called \"sea urchins\" live in rounded, segmented\r\nlime-carbonate shells bristling with movable spines. \"Sea urchins\"\r\nare first known from the Ordovician, but they did not become abundant\r\nand diversified until Mesozoic time, when many of them took on a very\r\nmodern aspect.\r\n\r\nWorms are known to have existed ever since late Proterozoic time,\r\nas proved by the occurrence of tracks, borings and more rarely\r\ndelicate impressions on rock surfaces. Because of their softness they\r\nhave rarely been well fossilized and are, therefore, of no great\r\nevolutionary or geological importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.--Fossil brachiopods belonging to the subkingdom\r\nof animals known as \"Molluscoids\": a, b, c, forms characteristic of the\r\nOrdovician, Devonian, and Triassic periods, respectively.]\r\n\r\nThe subkingdom Molluscoids has been richly represented by both the\r\nso-called \"sea mosses\" and brachiopods. The \"sea mosses\" form colonies\r\nof tiny mosslike tufts, resembling corals outwardly, though they are\r\nmuch more highly organized. They have been common from Ordovician\r\ntime to the present, their carbonate of lime skeletons often having\r\ncontributed to the building of limestone formations. Brachiopods always\r\nhave two external shells or valves, in most cases working on a hinge,\r\nand also a pair of long, spiral-fringed arms associated with the soft\r\npart of the animal inside the shells. They differ from the other type\r\nof bivalve (e.g., clam, oyster) in that they are symmetrical with\r\nreference to a plane passed through the middle of the shells at right\r\nangles to the hinge line. They have rarely grown to be more than a few\r\ninches long. A few scant brachiopod remains are known from the late\r\nProterozoic, but throughout known geologic time they reached their\r\ngreatest development in the Paleozoic era, more especially in the\r\nDevonian period. Combining number of species and number of individuals,\r\nthe brachiopods probably hold the record of all important groups of\r\nfossil animals, more than 7,000 species being known. Many layers of\r\nrock are filled with their shells (Plate 14). Since the close of the\r\nPaleozoic they have fallen off notably, and are now represented by\r\nrelatively few small forms. From the standpoint of evolution it is\r\ninteresting to note that in very early Paleozoic time the brachiopods\r\nwere mostly small, of relatively simple organization, and their thin\r\nshells were not joined by hinges. Later they became larger and more\r\ncomplex and their thicker shells worked on hinges. Nearly all the\r\nPaleozoic forms had long, straight hinge lines, which made it difficult\r\nfor their enemies to open them. Along with the change to narrower,\r\ncurved hinge lines came the decline of the tribe. They have been of\r\ngreat value to the geologist in subdividing the geological column of\r\nstrata into its many formations.\r\n\r\nThe Mollusks, which are more highly organized than the Molluscoids,\r\nhave more or less distinctly developed heads and locomotive organs.\r\nMany thousands of species are now extinct, the classes of most\r\ngeological importance being represented by clams, snails, and the\r\npearly nautilus. Most of them have shells and gills for breathing. The\r\nmembers of the simplest group, well represented by the clam tribe,\r\npossess two similar shells working on hinges, so that in this regard\r\nthey are much like brachiopods, but, unlike the latter, they are not\r\nsymmetrical with reference to a plane at right angles to the hinge\r\nline. Cambrian strata contain the oldest known of the fossil forms\r\nwhere they are small, relatively thin-shelled, and rare. In marked\r\ncontrast to the brachiopods these bivalves have rather steadily\r\nincreased in numbers of species and individuals to the present time,\r\nnow being represented by thousands of forms. During the Mesozoic era\r\nthey greatly out-numbered the brachiopod bivalves and took on a more\r\ndistinctly modern aspect, when the oyster tribe and closely related\r\ntypes were prominently developed. Culmination in size and thickness of\r\nshell seem to have been reached in early Cenozoic time, strata of that\r\nage in certain places, for example in Georgia and southern California,\r\nbeing filled with oyster shells 10 to 20 inches long and 4 to 6 inches\r\nthick! In addition to their gigantic size and thickness, many of the\r\nshells were fluted or ribbed, and so they represented an extreme type\r\nof defensive armor among the lower animals.\r\n\r\nSnails have existed from the earliest Paleozoic era to the present\r\ntime, and the outstanding fact of interest concerning them is that\r\nthey furnish one of the finest illustrations of an important class\r\nof animals which has undergone practically no conspicuous change or\r\nevolution during all those millions of years of time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.--Sketches of chambered cephalopods showing\r\nthe main steps in the evolution of the shell forms and compartment\r\npartitions: a, b, the only kinds in Cambrian time; c, d, forms added\r\nin the Ordovician; e, added in the Devonian; f, added in the late\r\nPaleozoic; g, h, characteristic of the Mesozoic era; and i, a living\r\nform (pearly nautilus) cut through. (Drawn by the author.)]\r\n\r\nWe shall now turn our attention to the highest order of Mollusks--the\r\ncephalopods. These creatures, whose heads are armed with powerful\r\ntentacles and supplied with complex eyes, propel themselves by forcible\r\nejection of water. One general type--the chambered cephalopod--has a\r\nshell divided into compartments (e.g., modern pearly nautilus) which\r\nare successively built up and abandoned by the animal as it grows\r\nlarger. These chamber-shelled cephalopods constitute one of the most\r\nremarkable and instructive illustrations of evolutionary change within\r\nany important subgroup of invertebrate animals, ranging from early\r\nPaleozoic to the present. Both because of the abundance of fossil\r\nforms in rocks of all these periods of geological times, and because\r\ncertain of the evolutionary changes are so clearly expressed in the\r\nwell preserved shell portions, they are specially adapted for study. In\r\nthe late Cambrian only straight and slightly curved forms with smooth,\r\nnearly straight chamber partitions existed. Notable advance took place\r\nduring the next (Ordovician) period when there were straight, curved,\r\nopen-coiled, and even close-coiled forms. All had simple partitions,\r\nand the straighter forms predominated. \"The size attained by the\r\nOrdovician cephalopods was probably never surpassed by representatives\r\nof the class. Some of the (straight) shells were twelve to fifteen feet\r\nin length, and a foot in diameter. From this great size they ranged\r\ndown to or below the size of a pipe stem.\" (Chamberlin and Salisbury.)\r\nThey were more than likely the undisputed masters of the Ordovician\r\nseas. Silurian time marked no important change in their structures,\r\nbut the coiled forms predominated for the first time. During the second\r\nhalf of the Paleozoic era all preceding types with simple partitions\r\npersisted, but in some forms the simple partitions gradually became\r\nangled and finally rather complexly curved. During the Mesozoic era\r\nthe partition lines of the close-coiled forms evolved until a most\r\nremarkable degree of complexity was attained, comparable, indeed, to\r\nthe sutures of the human skull plates. These remarkable forms called\r\nammonites, of which more than 2,000 species are known, began with the\r\nMesozoic, reached their climax, and passed out of existence toward the\r\nclose of the same era. Certain strata of Jurassic age are literally\r\nfilled with ammonites, some shells being several feet in diameter.\r\nVarious eccentric changes took place in the ammonites shortly before\r\ntheir extinction. Some shells became uncoiled and even straight, thus\r\noutwardly at least showing reversion to the original early Paleozoic\r\nancestors, but with retention of the complex partitions. Others assumed\r\nspiral shapes and still others became curved or coiled at each end.\r\nWhile these extraordinary evolutionary changes were going on among\r\nthe chambers of cephalopods during Mesozoic time, some of the ancient\r\nclose-coiled forms with very simple partitions managed to persist.\r\nIn fact this simple type, almost exactly like its early Paleozoic\r\nancestor, has been the only one out of this whole remarkable class of\r\nanimals to persist to the present time, being now barely represented by\r\nthe well-known pearly nautilus of the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nDuring the Mesozoic era the highest type of cephalopod, represented by\r\nmodern squids and so-called \"cuttlefishes,\" branched off and developed\r\nin great profusion. These had slender internal shells, but no external\r\nchambered shells. An inky black liquid secreted in a bag was forced\r\nout to cloud the water when the animal was escaping its enemy, thus\r\nantedating by millions of years the principle of smoke screen so\r\neffectively used by ships during the World War. Some Jurassic species\r\ngot to be over two feet long, and a few specimens of that age have\r\nbeen found in such perfect state of preservation that drawings of the\r\nfossils have actually been made with the ink (after moistening) taken\r\nfrom their own ink bags.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.--A fossil nonchambered cephalopod of Jurassic\r\nage. It was closely related to the modern squid, and its ink bag is\r\nwell shown just to the left of the middle. (Modified after Mantell.)]\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this chapter we shall take up the salient points\r\nin the geological history of Arthropods which constitute the highest\r\nsubkingdom of all animals except the Vertebrates. They are now very\r\nabundant and varied, familiar examples being crabs and insects. A few\r\nscant remains of simpler forms are known from the Proterozoic, but\r\nsince very early Paleozoic time they have been very common and have\r\nundergone great evolutionary changes. A few striking examples only will\r\nbe dwelt upon. Among the most common and interesting of all Paleozoic\r\nanimals were the trilobites, distantly related to modern lobsters and\r\ncrabs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.--Restorations of trilobites based upon actual\r\nfossils characteristic of earlier Paleozoic time: a, Cambrian; b,\r\nOrdovician; c, Devonian; b shows the appendages.]\r\n\r\nSome of these grew to be two feet long, but usually they were only\r\none or two inches long. First known from the earliest Paleozoic, they\r\nreached their culmination relatively early in the era and then dwindled\r\naway to utter extinction before its close. \"They were characteristic\r\nof the Paleozoic era, beginning in great variety in the Lower Cambrian\r\nand dominating the seas of the Cambrian (300 species) and Ordovician\r\n(950 species). In the Silurian, though they were still common, the\r\ntrilobites were nevertheless on the decline (485 species), and this\r\nebbing of their vital force is seemingly shown in many picturesque\r\nforms replete with protuberances, spines, and exaggeration of parts.\r\nAs a rule, in evolution, one finds that when an organic stock is\r\nlosing its vital force there arises in it an exaggeration of parts,\r\nas if heroic efforts were being made to maintain the race. Spinosity\r\nin animals is often the prophecy of tribal death. In the Devonian,\r\nthe variety and number of the trilobites were greatly reduced\r\n(105 species), at a time when the ancient types of fishes, which\r\nundoubtedly fed on these crustaceans (trilobites), began to be common\r\nin the seas. In the later Paleozoic seas, the trilobites were relics,\r\nor animals surviving from a time better suited to their needs, and one\r\nby one they vanished, until a little before the close of the Paleozoic\r\nera none were left.\" (Schuchert.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.--A giant, sea scorpion of Devonian time. Length\r\nnearly 3 feet. (After Clarke and Ruedemann, New York State Museum.)]\r\n\r\nAn extraordinary type of Arthropod which ranged throughout Paleozoic\r\ntime and became extinct at its close was the so-called \"sea scorpion,\"\r\nclosely related to the modern scorpion. Their five or six pairs of\r\nappendages all came out from the head portion, one pair in some cases\r\nhaving been developed as powerful pincers. Their culmination in size\r\nwas reached during the Devonian when some forms grew to the astonishing\r\nlength of over eight feet! Such gigantic creatures must have been\r\ntyrants of the seas until they were subdued by the oncoming powerful\r\nfishes. True scorpions are known from rocks as old as the Silurian.\r\nLobsters and crabs made their appearance during the Mesozoic era.\r\n\r\nSince insects constitute the highest subdivision of Arthropods, they\r\ninclude the very highest forms of animal life except the Vertebrates.\r\nThe oldest known fossil insects are from Pennsylvanian strata, more\r\nthan 1,000 species having been described from rocks of that age.\r\nThey were all simple or primitive types like cockroaches and dragon\r\nflies, and were remarkable for size. Giant cockroaches got to be four\r\ninches long. One form of dragon fly, with a spread of wing of over two\r\nfeet, was probably the largest insect which ever lived (Plate 15).\r\nDevelopment of insect life was especially favored during the great\r\nCoal Age because of the prolific vegetation, but more than likely\r\ninsects originated somewhat earlier. Early in the Mesozoic era a great\r\nprogressive change began to come over insect life and higher forms\r\ngradually evolved until by the close of the era many of the highest\r\ntypes like flies, ants, and bees were common. As might be expected, the\r\nhighest insects did not develop until after the appearance of the true\r\nflowering plants in later Mesozoic time, butterflies apparently not\r\nhaving evolved until early in Cenozoic time. Many of the thousands of\r\nknown species of fossil insects are from strata of Tertiary age during\r\nwhich time they may have been even more numerous than to-day, although\r\nthere are about 400,000 species now living. An almost incredible case\r\nis a Tertiary stratum only a few feet thick in Switzerland from which\r\nnearly 1,000 species of insects have been unearthed. Another famous\r\nlocality is Florissant, Colorado, where during early Tertiary time\r\nthere was a small lake into which showers of fine volcanic dust fell\r\nand entombed vast numbers of insects, more than 2,000 species having\r\nbeen unearthed. Still another extraordinary occurrence is along the\r\nshores of the southern Baltic Sea where more than 2,000 species of\r\ninsects have been found in a fossil resin called amber. The insects\r\nwere caught in the still soft sticky resin while it was exuding from\r\nthe trees, and thus we have the insects, fully two or three million\r\nyears old, literally embalmed and marvelously preserved, often in\r\nbeautifully transparent amber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF VERTEBRATE ANIMALS (INCLUDING MAN)\r\n\r\n\r\nVertebrates comprise the highest subkingdom of all animals with man\r\nhimself at the very top. They are characterized by the possession of\r\na vertebral column, which, in all but the very simple or primitive\r\nforms, is an ossified backbone. Their main subdivisions are given\r\nin the classification table near the beginning of the preceding\r\nchapter. The oldest known Vertebrates, found in fossil form in middle\r\nOrdovician strata, were represented by curious and bizarre creatures\r\ncalled ostracoderms, or more popularly \"armor fishes.\" They were not\r\ntrue fishes because they were really somewhat lower in the scale of\r\norganization than fishes. Some were distinctly fishlike in appearance,\r\nand others notably resembled certain of the Arthropods, so that some\r\nstudents consider them to have formed the connecting link between\r\nthe highest Invertebrates (Arthropods) and low order fishes of the\r\nVertebrates. The vertebral column always consisted of cartilage or\r\ngristle and, in most forms, it extended through tail fin. None had true\r\nside fins like fishes, but many were provided with a pair of jointed\r\nflappers or paddles. The jawlike portions of the heads moved over each\r\nother sidewise as, for example, in beetles and not up and down in true\r\nVertebrate fashion. Two eyes were always very close together. One of\r\nthe most striking features was the protection of the head and fore part\r\nof the body by an armor of bony plates, while the rest of the body had\r\nscales. They seldom grew to be more than six or seven inches long.\r\nBeginning in the Devonian, they remained rare during the Silurian, and\r\nthen in the Devonian period they reached their climax of development\r\nonly to become extinct at its close. Many species were abundantly\r\nrepresented in many parts of the world. By some the Ostracoderms are\r\nthought to have been a primitive (sharklike) fish development in the\r\nwrong direction, and hence they became extinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.--Two restored forms of very primitive and\r\nancient (Devonian) types of Vertebrates called \"ostracoderms.\" They\r\nwere lower in organization than true fishes. (After Dean-Woodward and\r\nBritish Museum, respectively.)]\r\n\r\nFishes, represented only by very primitive sharks, are known to\r\nhave existed as early as the Silurian period, but the remains are\r\nscant. During the Devonian period, however, they showed a marvelous\r\ndevelopment into many species and countless myriads of individuals.\r\nThe Devonian is, therefore, commonly called the \"Age of Fishes.\"\r\nThese very ancient (Devonian) primitive (fish) types of Vertebrate\r\nanimal life are of profound significance in organic evolution because\r\nthey were the direct progenitors of the great groups of still higher\r\nVertebrates which since later Paleozoic time gradually increased in\r\ndiversity and complexity of structure through amphibians, reptiles,\r\nbirds, and mammals finally to man himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.--Restorations of characteristic Devonian\r\nfishes, based upon actual fossils: a, a \"lung fish\" with leglike fins\r\n(after Huasakof); b, a \"ganoid.\" (After Nicholson.)]\r\n\r\nIn marked contrast to the most typical and highly organized fishes\r\nso abundant to-day, all Devonian fishes were of simple types with\r\ncartilaginous skeletons and vertebrated tails. Many of them were also\r\ngeneralized types, that is, associated with their clearly defined fish\r\ncharacters were others connecting them with certain higher Vertebrates,\r\nas, for example, amphibians and reptiles. Thus all their tail fins\r\nwere vertebrated as in reptiles; their labyrinthine, internal tooth\r\nstructure was to be an amphibian feature when those creatures evolved;\r\nmany had protective armor or bony scales like most early amphibians and\r\nmany modern reptiles; and many had paired fins which were something\r\nlike jointed legs. Most abundant and highly organized of the Devonian\r\nfishes were \"ganoids,\" characterized by a covering of small plates or\r\nbony scales set together but not overlapping like in typical modern\r\nfishes. Their intricate tooth structure and limblike fins strongly\r\nsuggest the amphibians of later Paleozoic time. The skeleton of\r\ncartilage gradually became somewhat ossified during succeeding geologic\r\nperiods. From their great profusion and diversity in the Devonian\r\nperiod the ganoids have steadily fallen away until they now have very\r\nfew descendants like the gar pike.\r\n\r\nAnother important group of remarkable fishes, now totally extinct,\r\nbut common in Devonian and somewhat later time, had heavy, bony armor\r\nplates over the fore part of the body. Those which grew to be fifteen\r\nto twenty-five feet long were probably the rulers of the middle\r\nPaleozoic seas. Another remarkable Devonian fish was able to breathe in\r\nboth water and air because, like their few modern descendants, they had\r\nboth gills and lungs. Because of their leglike fins and lung sac, it\r\nis commonly believed that they were progenitors of the later Paleozoic\r\namphibians. The simplest of all fishes, the sharks, began in the\r\nSilurian, underwent no important change through the millions of years\r\nsince, and are now of course well represented. During early Cenozoic\r\ntime the sharks seem to have reached culmination in size--sixty to\r\neighty feet long, with teeth five or six inches long.\r\n\r\nAmong modern fishes the most abundant by far, and the most highly\r\norganized, are the true bony fishes, called the \"teleosts,\" which\r\nmade their first appearance in the middle of the Mesozoic era. Those\r\nearliest forms clearly show their descent from the ganoids. Apparently\r\nthey have not yet passed their prime.\r\n\r\nWe shall now consider the next higher group of Vertebrates, the\r\namphibians, which breathe by gills when young and later develop\r\nlungs. Many live both on land and in water like the frogs. Unlike\r\nfishes they have legs with toes and not fins. Beginning probably in\r\nthe Devonian as a branch of the fishes, amphibians showed a marvelous\r\ndevelopment during later Paleozoic and very early Mesozoic times when\r\nthey reached their climax, after which they fell off remarkably, being\r\nnow relatively unimportant like the frogs and salamanders. They are of\r\nspecial significance because they were the first of all the back-boned\r\nanimals (Vertebrates) to inhabit the land which they dominated only\r\nuntil the great rise of reptiles of Mesozoic time. The reptiles in fact\r\nevolved from the amphibians in the late Paleozoic when many transition\r\nforms occurred. (Plate 15.) During those ancient days the numerous and\r\nvery diversified amphibians were like giant salamanders, commonly five\r\nto eight feet long, with one Triassic form fifteen to twenty feet long,\r\nand with heavily armored skulls two to four feet long.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the reptiles we find that they are much more distinctly\r\nland animals than the preceding types of Vertebrates. Reptilian life\r\nof the earth began in late Paleozoic time as an evolutionary branch\r\nof the amphibians. The earliest forms were in many ways much like the\r\namphibians, but gradually they diversified and progressed so that\r\nbefore the close of the Mesozoic era, which has long been called the\r\n\"Age of Reptiles,\" they were the rulers of the world. \"They covered\r\nthe land with gigantic herbivorous and carnivorous forms; they swarmed\r\nin the sea, and, as literal dragons, they dominated the air.\" (Scott.)\r\nMesozoic reptiles are of special interest and significance not only in\r\nthemselves, but also because from one of their branches the birds were\r\nevolved, and from another the mammals. \"In advancing from the amphibian\r\nto the reptile the evolution of the Vertebrates was far from finished.\r\nThe cold-blooded, clumsy and sluggish, small-brained and unintelligent\r\nreptile is as far inferior to the higher mammals, whose day was still\r\nto come, as it is superior to the amphibian and the fish.\" (Norton.)\r\n\r\nSince the reptiles of the Mesozoic era constitute one of the few most\r\nremarkable and diversified classes of animals which ever inhabited the\r\nearth, we shall attempt to give the reader a fair idea of the most\r\ntypical groups which have been totally extinct since the close of the\r\nMesozoic era some millions of years ago. Of the swimming reptiles\r\nwhich lived in the seas many types are known and only a few will be\r\ndescribed. Among these one important type was the ichthyosaur, a\r\nfishlike form which not uncommonly grew to be twenty to even forty feet\r\nlong (Plate 18). The large head, sometimes four or five feet long,\r\ncontained as many as 200 big sharp teeth and enormous eyes up to a foot\r\nin diameter. The body was heavy set, and the neck very short. There\r\nwere four short, stout swimming paddles, and the tail was vertebrated.\r\nSome specimens of ichthyosaurs have been so perfectly preserved in\r\nMesozoic strata that even the unborn young are plainly seen in the\r\nbodies! In some cases it is actually possible to tell what was the last\r\nmeal of a particular ichthyosaur those millions of years ago; in one\r\nspecimen, for example, remains of 200 creatures of the \"cuttle-fish\"\r\ntribe having been found in the exact position of the stomach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.--Chart showing the main branches in the history\r\nof Vertebrate (back-boned) animal life reaching its culmination in man.\r\n(By the author, in part after Cleland.)]\r\n\r\nThe mosasaurs of the late Mesozoic were the only real sea serpents of\r\nthe geologic ages. They were something like the ichthyosaurs, but with\r\nsmaller heads and much longer, more slender, serpentlike bodies. Some\r\ngrew to be thirty or forty feet long.\r\n\r\nPlesiosaurs were perhaps the strangest of all the Mesozoic marine\r\nreptiles. They grew to be forty to fifty feet long, with stout body,\r\nvery long, slender neck, small head, short tail, and four long,\r\npowerful swimming paddles which were distinctly leglike. These and the\r\nmosasaurs were both flesh eaters, as shown by the sharp teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 15.--(_a_) Restoration of a Late Paleozoic (Coal\r\nAge) Landscape.

A mounted\r\nskeleton in the American Museum of Natural History is sixty-seven feet\r\nlong, and the skeleton of a similar creature in the Carnegie Museum,\r\nPittsburgh, is eighty-seven feet long. They lived millions of years ago\r\nduring the middle and late Mesozoic era. (_After C. R. Knight. Courtesy\r\nof the American Museum of Natural History, New York._)]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable walking reptiles of all time were the dinosaurs\r\nor \"terrible lizards.\" We shall describe enough types of these unique\r\ncreatures to give the reader a fair idea of their appearance and\r\nhabits. Most astonishing of all were the sauropods including the\r\nlargest animals which ever trod the earth. They grew to be as much\r\nas sixty to ninety feet or more in length. Remarkably well preserved\r\nskeletons have been found, one from Utah, eighty-seven feet long, being\r\nmounted in the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh. The largest of these\r\nbrutes stood fifteen to twenty feet high and they must have weighed\r\nthirty to fifty tons. The very long, serpentlike neck and tail, and\r\nvery small head were grotesque features. Considering the structure of\r\nthe dinosaurs, the kind of strata in which they are embedded, and the\r\nassociated fossil remains, it seems clear that they mostly lived in\r\nand near fresh water and on near-by lowlands. The character of their\r\nteeth shows that they fed entirely on soft plants which they must have\r\nhabitually bolted because their teeth were not well adapted to grinding\r\nfood. It is difficult to believe that a single huge beast could have\r\nconsumed less than a few hundred pounds of vegetable matter per day,\r\nand, on account of the very small size of the head, he must have spent\r\nmost of his time eating. Also the comparatively very small size of\r\nthe brain, and its simplicity of structure, render it certain that\r\nthey were extremely stupid creatures. \"To make up for this they had an\r\nenormous enlargement of the spinal cord in the sacral region (i.e.,\r\nover the hind legs). This sacral brain--if we may so call it--was ten\r\nto twenty times bigger than the cranial brain. It was necessary in\r\norder to work the powerful hind legs and tail.\" (Le Conte.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.--Skeleton of a great four-legged (sauropod)\r\ndinosaur. A mounted skeleton in the American Museum of Natural History,\r\nNew York, is sixty-seven feet long. This creature lived millions of\r\nyears ago during the Jurassic period. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nAnother dinosaur, in some respects like the sauropod, was the stegosaur\r\nwhich grew to be twenty to thirty feet long, and heavier than the\r\nelephant. Unlike the sauropod, it had a short neck and was armored with\r\na double row of great plates over its back, and sharp spines (one to\r\nthree feet long) toward the end of the tail. The excessive stupidity of\r\nthe creature is proved by the fact that its very simple brain weighed\r\nless than three ounces! Stegosaurs were plant eaters as indicated by\r\nthe tooth structure, and, though they looked ferocious, they were\r\nprobably not fighters, certainly at least nothing like the carnivorous\r\ntypes of dinosaurs we shall soon describe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.--Skeleton of the curious kind of dinosaur\r\n(stegosaur) of Mesozoic Age with great bony plates over the back.\r\nLength about thirty feet. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nThe ferocious dinosaurs of Mesozoic time were carnivorous, or flesh\r\neaters, as shown by their numerous sharp teeth in relatively large\r\nheads. The largest known type is the tyrannosaur, an almost perfect\r\nskeleton of which, 40 feet long and 16 feet high, is mounted in the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History in New York (Plate 17). So far as\r\nknown, this was the largest carnivorous animal which ever walked on\r\nthe earth. It is evident from the structure that it walked on its\r\nhind legs, the front ones having been much shorter and used something\r\nlike arms. There were also various other smaller forms of two-legged\r\nflesh-eating dinosaurs, many of the wonderfully preserved tracks in\r\nthe Triassic sandstones of the Connecticut River Valley having been\r\nmade by such creatures when they walked around over soft, sandy mud\r\nflats at least eight or ten million years ago. The sandy mud with its\r\ntracks became somewhat hardened and then deeply buried under much more\r\nsediment which, through the ages, has been eroded off, thus exposing to\r\nview certain of the layers covered with tracks. Some bones of dinosaurs\r\nhave also been found in the Connecticut Valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.--Skeleton (restored) of a great two-legged\r\ndinosaur of the Mesozoic era. This type of plant eater grew to be fully\r\ntwenty-five feet long. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable type of two-legged dinosaur was much like the flesh\r\neaters just described, but they were plant eaters. The largest of these\r\ngrew to be 30 feet long and 15 to 20 feet high, comparable, therefore,\r\nto the tyrannosaur in size. A wonderful collection of almost perfect\r\nskeletons may be seen in the museum in Brussels, Belgium. In mining\r\ncoal 1,000 feet below the surface in Belgium, twenty-two complete\r\nskeletons and several partial skeletons were found in an ancient river\r\ndeposit of Cretaceous Age. A marvelously preserved specimen of one\r\nof these two-legged plant eaters found in Wyoming, has been called a\r\n\"dinosaur mummy\" because the skin and much of the flesh of the creature\r\nhad shriveled down upon its bones. The minutest details of the texture\r\nof its skin are almost perfectly preserved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.--Skeleton of a dinosaur (triceratops) with a\r\nlarge remarkable head. This creature grew to be twenty-five feet long\r\nduring Cretaceous time. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nAnother type of dinosaur, so different from the others, should be\r\nbriefly described. This was triceratops, or the \"three-horned face\"\r\nbeast, so named because of the three powerful horns which projected\r\nforward from the top of the very large, flattened skull. It grew to be\r\ntwenty to twenty-five feet long. Skulls six to eight feet long have\r\nbeen unearthed. Just where the brain might have developed, the skull\r\ndished downward, and so one authority considers triceratops to have had\r\nthe largest head and smallest brain of all the great reptiles.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that dinosaurs of many types lived during the great\r\n\"Age of Reptiles,\" though by no means all types ranged through the\r\nwhole era. No dinosaurs are definitely known to have crossed the line\r\ninto the Cenozoic era. One of the most astonishing facts in the history\r\nof animal life is the extinction of the mighty dinosaurs, but no very\r\nsatisfactory explanation has yet been offered. Probably their great\r\nsize was a contributing factor, for it is well known \"that while very\r\nlarge animals spend nearly all their time in eating, small animals\r\nspend a small proportion of theirs, and most of it in other activities.\r\nNow, as long as food is abundant, the larger animals of a race have the\r\nbetter chances, but if a scarcity of food ensues, the larger animals\r\nmay all be suddenly swept out of existence.\" (Matthew.) Whatever may\r\nhave been the real reason for dinosaur extinction we can at least be\r\nsure \"that with the extensive changes in the elevation of land areas\r\n(Rocky Mountain Revolution) which mark the close of the Mesozoic, came\r\nthe withdrawing of the great inland Cretaceous seas along the low-lying\r\nshores of which the dinosaurs had their home, and with the consequent\r\nrestriction of old haunts, came the blotting out of a heroic race.\r\nTheir career was not a brief one, for the duration of their recorded\r\nevolution was twice that of the subsequent mammalian (Cenozoic) age.\r\nThey do not represent a futile attempt on the part of nature to people\r\nthe world with creatures of insignificant moment, but are comparable\r\nin majestic rise, slow culmination, and dramatic fall to the greatest\r\nnations of antiquity.\" (Schuchert.)\r\n\r\nAmong the most extraordinary animals not only of the Mesozoic, but also\r\nof all time, were the flying reptiles or literal dragons of the air.\r\nSome were very small, while others were the largest creatures which\r\never flew, with a spread of wing of twenty to twenty-five feet--twice\r\nthat of any modern bird. Unlike birds they had no feathers, but the\r\ntwo wings consisted of large membranes (batlike) supported by one\r\nenormously elongated finger of each front limb. The other fingers\r\nwere armed with sharp claws. The early Mesozoic flying reptiles had\r\nsharp teeth, while the later ones were mostly entirely toothless, but\r\nall were carnivorous. Their short bodies were supplied with tails of\r\nvarying lengths, one long-tailed species having a rudder at the end.\r\nTheir heads were fairly large, but of light build. The creature called\r\n\"pteranodon\" was not only the largest of the flying reptiles, but\r\nalso probably the most highly specialized creature which ever lived,\r\neverything possible apparently having been sacrificed to facilitate\r\nflight (Plate 18). The hollow bones were so wonderfully light and\r\nstrong that it has been estimated that the living animal, with\r\ntwenty-five foot spread of wing, and head four feet long, could not\r\nhave weighed more than twenty-five pounds! The rear portions of the\r\nbody and hind limbs were very weak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.--A small carnivorous flying reptile of Mesozoic\r\ntime. Spread of wings about two feet. (Restored by Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nIt should not be thought that the above-described groups of reptiles\r\nwere the only ones which existed during Mesozoic time. There were also\r\ncertain groups still living, like turtles, lizards, and crocodiles, but\r\nthey were doubtless mostly completely under the dominance of certain\r\nof the now long-extinct types above described. The oldest-known fossil\r\nsnakes are from very late Mesozoic rocks, where they are small and\r\ncomparatively rare. More than likely they evolved from lizards by\r\ndeterioration of the legs. Poisonous snakes were not evolved until\r\nearly in the next (Cenozoic) era.\r\n\r\nWe shall now turn our attention to next to the highest class of\r\nVertebrate animals--the birds. They and the mammals are the only\r\nwarm-blooded animals. What is their ancestry? From what original stock\r\ndid they branch off? The oldest-known bird lived during the Jurassic\r\nperiod, and it was so decidedly reptilian in character as to render it\r\npractically certain that birds are specialized descendants of certain\r\nMesozoic reptiles, though not, as might be supposed, of the flying\r\nreptiles. The few known specimens of the Jurassic birds were found\r\nin the famous lithographic limestone quarries of Bavaria. At least\r\ntwo of the specimens are in a marvelous state of preservation, with\r\npractically the whole skeleton intact and almost perfect impressions of\r\nthe feathers on the rock. That the creature was really a bird is proved\r\nnot only by its feathers, but also its beak, brain, limb bones, and\r\nfeet. Among the reptilian characters are its long, vertebrated tail,\r\nteeth set in sockets, and long claws on the wings. This reptilian bird\r\nwas about the size of a small crow.\r\n\r\nBy late Cretaceous time the birds made notable evolutionary progress\r\nand they became diversified, more than thirty species being known from\r\nCretaceous rocks. These were distinctly more modern in structure\r\nand appearance than the Jurassic bird. The only important reptilian\r\ncharacteristic still retained was the possession of teeth. The tail\r\nhad become much shortened and the brain was still relatively smaller\r\nthan in modern birds. One type, about nine inches high, was a powerful\r\nflier, as shown by the strong keel and wing bones. Another important\r\nCretaceous type was almost wholly a water dweller, with powerfully\r\ndeveloped legs used in swimming. Its teeth were set in grooves instead\r\nof in sockets, thus indicating degeneration of tooth structure. This\r\ntype was notable for its size--five to six feet in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.--An early type of bird with teeth. This bird\r\ngrew to a height of about nine inches in Cretaceous time, millions of\r\nyears ago. (Restored by Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the Cenozoic era birds became still more\r\nadvanced and numerous, with many modern groups represented. Some of\r\nthe more primitive types were, however, still left over during the\r\nTertiary, as, for example, a toothed bird, in which the teeth were\r\nmerely dentations of the bill, thus being the most degenerate of all\r\ntypes of tooth structure.\r\n\r\nMammals comprise the highest class of all animals. They are, of course,\r\nall warm blooded and characterized by suckling their young. So far\r\nas known, mammal life began in the early Mesozoic era as a branch of\r\nprimitive reptiles, but they made little progress throughout the era\r\nwhen they occupied a very subordinate position in the animal world.\r\nThey were few in number, small, and primitive in structure. There is\r\nno evidence for the Mesozoic existence of any of the higher forms of\r\nmammals, that is, those which give birth to well-formed young which\r\nare prenatally attached to the mother by the so-called placentum.\r\n\"During the eons of the Mesozoic, from late Triassic time until its\r\nclose, the mammals (including the remote progenitors of humanity) were\r\nin existence, but held in such effective check (by reptiles) that\r\ntheir evolutionary progress was practically insignificant. This curb\r\nis strikingly illustrated by the wonderful series of tiny jaws and\r\nteeth of these diminutive creatures found in the Comanchian (early\r\nCretaceous) of Wyoming, in actual association with the single tooth of\r\na carnivorous dinosaur, many times the bulk of the largest mammalian\r\njaw. The removal of this check resulted (in the Tertiary period) in the\r\nspeedy evolution of the archaic mammals.\" (Schuchert.)\r\n\r\nThe phenomenal development of mammals during the Tertiary period forms\r\none of the most wonderful chapters in the whole evolution of organisms.\r\nEven very early in the Tertiary, many important higher (placental)\r\ntypes of mammals had evolved, and the simpler, more primitive Mesozoic\r\nforms became very subordinate. By the close of the Tertiary the higher\r\ntypes of mammals had become marvelously differentiated into most of\r\nthe present-day groups or types. A very significant feature of the\r\nevolution was the steady increase in relative size of brain. The vast\r\nnumbers of fossil skeletons and bones of mammals found in Tertiary\r\nstrata is scarcely believable. In our brief discussion we can do no\r\nmore than describe a few representative examples of the Cenozoic\r\nevolution of mammals.\r\n\r\nThe great diversity of modern placental animals may be suggested by\r\na few examples, as the tiger, dog, horse, camel, elephant, squirrel,\r\nhedgehog, whale, monkey, and man. Forms like these, traced back\r\nthrough their ancestors to the very early part of the Tertiary period,\r\ngradually become less and less distinct until they cannot be at all\r\ndistinguished as separate groups, but rather there are ancestral\r\ngeneralized forms which show combinations of features of the later\r\ngroups. Those early Tertiary generalized placental mammals had four\r\nfeet of primitive character, with five toes on each foot; the whole\r\nfoot, which from toe to heel touched the ground, was not adapted to\r\nswift running; the teeth were simple (primitive) in type and of full\r\noriginal number (forty-four); the toes were supplied with nails which\r\nwere about intermediate between real claws and hoofs in structure; and\r\nthe brain was relatively much smaller and simpler in structure than in\r\nmost modern mammals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.--Chart showing the main features of interest\r\nin the evolution of the horse family through several million years of\r\nthe present (Cenozoic) era of geologic time. (After Matthew, American\r\nMuseum of Natural History.)]\r\n\r\nThe history of the horse family furnishes an excellent illustration of\r\ncertain evolutionary changes among mammals. Skeletons of many species,\r\nranging from the early Tertiary to the present, have been found in\r\nremarkable state of preservation representing every important change\r\nin the history of the horse family. A study of the chart will make\r\nclear some of the most striking changes which have taken place. The\r\noldest member of the horse family represented on the chart was about\r\nthe size of a small fox, with four toes and a degenerated fifth toe\r\n(splint) on the front foot, and three toes and splint on the hind\r\nfoot. Since the chart was made a still more primitive form, even more\r\nclosely resembling the original five-toed ancestor, has been found.\r\nGradually the middle toe enlarged, while the others disappeared except\r\nthe two splints or very degenerate toes still left in the modern horse.\r\nIncrease in size of the animal and brain capacity accompanied these\r\nchanges. Also the teeth underwent notable change, and two originally\r\nseparate bones (radius and ulna) of the foreleg became consolidated\r\ninto a single stronger bone.\r\n\r\nThe even-toed hoofed mammals of to-day, like the deer, pig, and camel,\r\nare also the product of evolution much like that of the horse, except\r\nthat two of the original five toes have been equally developed,\r\nwhile the others have either greatly degenerated, as in the pig, or\r\ndisappeared entirely, as in the camel.\r\n\r\nThe elephants, or trunk-bearing animals, illustrate a very different\r\nkind of evolution. They seem to have reached their climax of\r\ndevelopment in the late Tertiary when they grew to be as much as 14\r\nfeet high, and were more abundant and widespread over the earth than at\r\nany other time. The modern elephant, like the horse, has been traced\r\nback through many intermediate forms to its primitive early Tertiary\r\nancestry. Some of the most important evolutionary changes took place\r\nin the head portion. The trunk is a highly developed form of snout,\r\nthe earliest form of which was much like that of the modern tapir. The\r\ntusks are highly specialized and elongated teeth. During the earlier\r\nhistory the chin was very long and supported short tusks, so that there\r\nwere then four tusks.\r\n\r\nCarnivorous mammals, like tigers and wolves, and gnawers, like rats and\r\nsquirrels, may also be traced back to generalized early Tertiary types.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of evolution is well illustrated by certain mammals which,\r\neven in early Tertiary time, so thoroughly adapted themselves to a\r\nwater environment as to become whales, porpoises, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.--Comparison of feet of monkeys and man.]\r\n\r\nThe primates include the highest group of all Vertebrates, and\r\ntherefore of all animals. Monkeys, apes, and man belong to the\r\nprimates. There is no evidence whatever for the appearance of even the\r\nsimplest and most primitive forms before the opening of the Cenozoic\r\nera, but even very early in Tertiary time, lemurs and primitive types\r\nof monkeys existed. Later in the Tertiary true monkeys and apes were\r\ncommon, and by the close of the period some apes were highly enough\r\ndeveloped to strongly resemble certain of the oldest and most primitive\r\ntypes of man. We have, however, no positive knowledge of the existence\r\nof man in even the latest Tertiary. In the light of much evidence in\r\nregard to the antiquity of man, it seems improbable that true human\r\nfossils will ever be found in rocks older than the Quaternary, though\r\nif we are willing to descend (far enough in the human scale toward\r\napes) it is not unlikely that man-apes may be discovered in very late\r\nTertiary rocks. The difficulty comes in the classification. Where\r\nare we to draw the line between the higher apes and the lowest forms\r\nof man? But this very difficulty is one of the strongest arguments\r\nin favor of the organic evolution of man because practically all\r\nintermediate forms between true man and certain other high-grade\r\nprimates are known from the strata. The following tabular summary of\r\nthe geological history of man is based upon the work of most of the\r\nablest students of the subject.\r\n\r\n  ==========================+===============================+==============\r\n  3.

One of\r\nthese, known as _Pithecanthropus erectus_, was a remarkable creature\r\nwhose partial skeleton, consisting of the upper part of a skull, lower\r\njaw, several teeth, and a thigh bone, was found in early Quaternary\r\ndeposits in Java in 1891. It was certainly a man-ape or possibly\r\nape-man of low order, about 5-1/2 feet high. The skull has a low crown,\r\nvery receding forehead, and prominent brow ridges, but the brain\r\ncapacity is 850 cubic centimeters, as compared to 500 cubic centimeters\r\nin ordinary higher apes, and nearly 1,500 cubic centimeters in the\r\naverage modern man. The very recently extinct very low-type aborigines\r\nof Tasmania had a skull capacity of 1,199 cubic centimeters.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 the lower jaw of an anthropoid or manlike ape set with rather\r\nhuman teeth was found associated with very crude stone implements\r\nseventy-five feet below the surface in river-deposited sand in Germany.\r\nIt is of either early or middle Glacial time and quite certainly\r\nrepresents a lower order creature than the oldest Paleolithic man as\r\ndescribed below.\r\n\r\nMany bones and implements of Paleolithic man (see above table) have\r\nbeen found mainly in river gravels and caves. The relative ages\r\nof Paleolithic human bones and implements are best determined by\r\nthe associated fossil animals. Thus the most ancient truly human\r\nfossils are found directly associated with bones of very old types of\r\nelephants, rhinoceroses, and hippopotamuses which are definitely known\r\nto have lived during middle or early middle Glacial (Quaternary) time\r\ncorresponding to early Paleolithic time. A very conservative estimate\r\nwould make the age of such very old human remains at least 150,000 to\r\n250,000 years because the Ice Age was at least 500,000 years long. In a\r\nlater human stage there are many associations with extinct animals like\r\nan older type of mammoth, cave bear, cave hyena, and others of later\r\nGlacial time estimated at 50,000 to 150,000 years ago. Last of all was\r\nthe latest Paleolithic stage corresponding to the close of the Ice Age,\r\nthe human remains of which are found associated with reindeer and the\r\nlatest mammoths which roamed in great numbers across Europe. This was\r\nprobably not more than 30,000 to 50,000 years ago.\r\n\r\nPaleolithic man is so called because he fashioned stone weapons and\r\nimplements. The structure of skull and skeleton shows him to have\r\nbeen a low-type savage, something over five feet high on the average,\r\nwith a forward stooping carriage. The average Paleolithic brain was\r\nnot greatly inferior in size to that of modern civilized man, but\r\nit was not so highly organized and occupied a thick skull with much\r\nlower forehead and heavy brow ridges. The bushmen of Australia and\r\nthe recently extinct Tasmanians are the nearest modern resemblances.\r\nMany fine specimens of Paleolithic man have been found, especially in\r\ncave deposits. That he was an expert hunter is proved by the great\r\naccumulation of bones of now extinct animals found in and about his\r\nhaunts or camps, bones representing at least 100,000 horses having been\r\nfound around a single camp site!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68.--Comparison of skulls: a, Paleolithic\r\n(Neanderthal) man; b, modern man. (After Woodward, British Museum.)]\r\n\r\nOnly two among the many known Paleolithic man localities will be\r\nbriefly described. In the Perigord district of southwestern France a\r\nnumber of caves contain human relics ranging in age from early to late\r\nPaleolithic. Of special interest among these relics are fishhooks\r\nmade of bone, and crude sketches of animals such as the mammoth and\r\nreindeer now extinct in that region. The Aurignac cave, also in France,\r\nwas no doubt a family or tribal burial place. Seventeen Paleolithic\r\nhuman skeletons, associated with bones of extinct animals and crude\r\nart works, were found in the cave. Near the entrance there were ashes\r\nand charcoal mixed with burned and split bones of extinct animals.\r\nCertain of the caves occupied by late Paleolithic man have their\r\nwalls decorated with sketches and even colored pictures. These are,\r\ntherefore, the oldest known art galleries. An excellent example is the\r\ncave at Altamira in northern Spain. \"As we glance at the pictures one\r\nof the first things to impress us is the excellence of the drawing, the\r\nproportions and postures being unusually good.... The next observation\r\nmay be that, in spite of this perfection of technique, there is no\r\nperspective composition--that is, no attempt to combine or group the\r\nfigures.... It is also clear that the work of many different artists\r\nis represented, covering a considerable period of time. The walls show\r\ntraces of many other paintings that were erased to make way for new\r\nwork.\" (Wissler.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69.--Sketch of a painting by Paleolithic man found\r\nin a cave in west-central France. Various animals, including the\r\nextinct mammoth elephant, are represented. (Courtesy of American Museum\r\nof Natural History.)]\r\n\r\nThe Neolithic, or \"recent stone\" age was a gradual development from\r\nthe late Paleolithic, and man was then more highly developed and more\r\nsimilar in structure to modern man. His stone implements were more\r\nperfectly made, and often more or less polished and ground at the\r\nedges. \"The remains of Neolithic man are found, much as are those of\r\nthe North American Indians, upon or near the surface, in burial mounds,\r\nin shell heaps (the refuse heaps of their settlements), in peat bogs,\r\ncaves, recent flood-plain deposits, and in beds of lakes near shore\r\nwhere they sometimes built their dwellings upon piles.... Neolithic man\r\nin Europe had learned to make pottery, to spin and weave linen, to hew\r\ntimber, and build boats, and to grow wheat and barley. The dog, horse,\r\nox, sheep, goat, and hog had been domesticated.\" (Norton.)\r\n\r\n\"Man is linked to the past through the system of life, of which he is\r\nthe last, the completing creation. But, unlike other species of that\r\nclosing system of the past, he, through his spiritual nature, is more\r\nintimately connected with the opening future.\" (J. D. Dana.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nMINERALOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are more or less familiar with the division of all materials of\r\nnature into the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms. With slight\r\nexceptions minerals are the materials which make up the known part\r\nof the earth. In a very real sense, then, mineralogy is the most\r\nfundamental of the various branches of the great science of geology\r\nbecause the events of earth history, as interpreted by the geologist,\r\nare recorded in the mineral matter (including most rocks) of the\r\nearth. When we examine the rocky material or mineral matter of the\r\nearth in any region we find that it consists of various kinds of\r\nsubstances each of which may be recognized by certain characteristics.\r\nEach definite substance (barring those of organic origin) is called\r\na mineral. Or, more specifically, a mineral is a natural, inorganic,\r\nhomogeneous substance of definite chemical composition. According to\r\nthis definition a mineral must be found ready made in nature, must not\r\nbe a product of life, must be of the same nature throughout, and its\r\ncomposition must be so definite that it can be expressed by a chemical\r\nformula. All artificial substances, such as laboratory and furnace\r\nproducts, are excluded from the category of minerals. Coal is not a\r\nmineral because it is both organic and of indefinite composition. A\r\nfew examples of very common substances which perfectly satisfy the\r\ndefinition of a mineral are quartz, feldspar, mica, calcite, and\r\nmagnetite. Only two substances--water and mercury--are ordinarily\r\nliquid minerals. There are nearly a thousand distinct mineral species,\r\nand to them and their varieties several thousand names have been\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nIt is a surprising fact that of the eighty or more chemical elements,\r\nthat is substances which cannot be subdivided into simpler ones, only\r\neight make up more than 98 per cent of the weight of the crust of the\r\nearth, though, with one very slight exception, none of the eight exist\r\nas such in mineral form. The eight elements are oxygen (nearly 50 per\r\ncent), silicon (over 25 per cent), aluminum (over 7 per cent), iron\r\n(over 5 per cent), calcium (or \"lime\"), magnesium (or \"magnesia\"),\r\nsodium (or \"soda\"), and potassium (or \"potash\").\r\n\r\nCertain rock formations are made up essentially of but one mineral\r\nin the form of numerous grains as, for example, limestone, which\r\nconsists of calcite (carbonate of lime). Most of the ordinary rocks\r\nare, however, made up of two or more minerals mechanically bound\r\ntogether. Thus, in a specimen of granite on the author's desk several\r\ndistinct mineral substances are distinguishable by the naked eye.\r\nThese mineral grains are from one to five millimeters across. Most\r\ncommon among them are hard, clear, glassy grains called quartz; nearly\r\nwhite, hard grains, with smooth faces, called feldspar; small, silvery\r\nwhite plates, easily separable into very thin flakes, called mica;\r\nand small, hard, black grains, called magnetite. It is the business\r\nof the mineralogist to learn the characters of each mineral, how they\r\nmay be distinguished from each other, how they may be classified, how\r\nthey are found in nature, and what economic value they may have. It\r\nis an important part of the business of the geologist to learn what\r\nindividual minerals combine to form the many kinds of rocks, how such\r\nrocks originate, what changes they have undergone, and what geological\r\nhistory they record. It is thus clear that the great science of geology\r\nis much broader in its scope than mineralogy.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable facts about minerals is that most of them\r\nby far have a crystalline structure, that is they are built up of tiny\r\nparticles known as molecules. Such crystalline minerals are often more\r\nor less regular solid forms bounded by plane faces and sharp angles,\r\nsuch forms being known as \"crystals.\" How do crystals develop such\r\nregularity of form? Any solid is considered to be made up of many very\r\ntiny (submicroscopic) molecules held together by an attractive force\r\ncalled cohesion. In liquids the molecules may more or less freely roll\r\nover each other, thus altering the shape of the mass without disrupting\r\nit. In gases the molecules are considered to be relatively long\r\ndistances apart and moving rapidly. During the process of change of a\r\nsubstance from the condition of a liquid or gas to that of a solid, due\r\nto lowering of temperature or evaporation, the cohesive force pulls\r\nthe particles (molecules) together into a rigid mass. Under favorable\r\nconditions such a solid has a regular polyhedral form. \"This results\r\nfrom the fact that the particles or molecules of the substance which,\r\nwhile it was liquid or gaseous, rolled about on one another, have\r\nbeen in some way arranged, grouped and built up. To illustrate this,\r\nsuppose a quantity of small shot to be poured into a glass: the shot\r\nwill represent the molecules of a substance in the liquid state, as\r\nfor example a solution of alum. If, now, we suppose these same shot to\r\nbe coated with varnish or glue so that they will adhere to each other,\r\nand imagine them grouped as shown in Figure 70a, they will represent\r\nthe arrangement of the molecules of the alum after it has become solid\r\nor crystallized. This arranging, grouping, and piling up of molecules\r\nis called crystallization, and the solid formed in this way is called\r\na crystal. Figures 70b and 70c show the shot arranged to reproduce two\r\ncommon forms of crystals (e.g., fluorite and calcite).\" (Whitlock.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70.--Piles of shot arranged to give some idea of\r\nthe manner in which molecules are bound together in various crystal\r\nforms. (After Whitlock, New York Museum.)]\r\n\r\nA combination of certain facts regarding crystals furnish all but\r\nabsolute proof of some sort of regularity of arrangement of particles\r\nwithin them. Among such facts are the following: (1) the wonderful\r\nregularity of arrangement of faces upon crystals is practically\r\nimpossible to account for except as the outward manifestation of\r\nregularity of structure or systematic network arrangement of the\r\ninterior; (2) most crystals split or cleave more or less perfectly\r\nin one or more directions presumably in accordance with certain\r\nlayered structure of the constituent particles; (3) all of the many\r\nknown forms of crystals can be accurately grouped in regard to their\r\neffects upon the passage of light (especially polarized light) through\r\nthem, each kind or type of network structure presumably producing a\r\ndifferent effect upon light; and (4) X-ray photographs have proved that\r\nparticles, or at least groups of particles, are very systematically\r\narranged within crystals.\r\n\r\nIt will be instructive for us to make a comparison between the\r\ngrowth of crystals and organisms. Both really grow, but each species\r\nof organism is rather definitely limited in size while there is no\r\nknown limit to the size which may be attained by a crystal so long as\r\nmaterial is supplied to it under proper conditions. As a matter of\r\nfact crystals vary in size from microscopic to several feet in length,\r\nthose less than an inch in length being most abundant by far. Organisms\r\nmostly grow from within, while crystals grow from material externally\r\nadded. It is an astonishing fact that in crystals as well as organisms\r\ngrowth takes most rapidly on a wound or broken place. Thus if a crystal\r\nis removed from the solution in which it is growing and put back\r\nafter a corner has been broken off, the fractured surface will build\r\nup more rapidly than the rest. Finally, crystals are not necessarily\r\nlimited in age like organisms. Under certain natural conditions, as,\r\nfor example, weathering, crystals may decay or be broken up; but where\r\nthey are protected as constituent parts of rock formations well below\r\nthe earth's surface they may remain unchanged for indefinite millions\r\nof years. Thus in a ledge of the most ancient known or Archeozoic rock\r\nonly recently laid bare by erosion one may see crystals which are\r\nprecisely as they were when they crystallized many millions of years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable properties of a crystal is its symmetry,\r\nby which is meant the greater or less degree of regularity in the\r\narrangement of its faces, edges, and vertices. A given substance may,\r\naccording to circumstances, crystallize in a variety of forms or\r\ncombinations of forms, but, with very few exceptions, all crystals of\r\na given substance exhibit the same kind or grade of symmetry. There\r\nare three kinds of crystal symmetry, namely, in respect to a plane,\r\na line or axis, and a point or center. A plane of symmetry divides a\r\ncrystal into halves in such a way that for every point on one side of\r\nthe plane there is a corresponding point directly opposite on the other\r\nside. Crystals may be cut into halves along various surfaces which\r\nare not symmetry planes. An axis of symmetry is a line about which a\r\ncomplete rotation (or in a few cases rotation combined with reflection)\r\nbrings the crystal into the same relative position two, three, four\r\nor six times, these being called two, three, four, and sixfold axes\r\nof symmetry--no others being possible. A crystal has a center of\r\nsymmetry when any line passing through it encounters corresponding\r\npoints at equal distances from it on opposite sides. There are just\r\n32 classes or combinations of the symmetry elements among crystals\r\nand just 232 definite crystal forms. Not only is it demonstrable that\r\nno more can exist, but actual experience with crystals of hundreds\r\nof species of minerals has never revealed any more. Obviously, then,\r\nsymmetry furnishes us with a very scientific basis of classification\r\nof crystals, all of the 232 crystal forms constituting the 32 symmetry\r\nclasses being in turn referable to seven fundamental crystal systems.\r\nTo bring out the relations of the faces of a crystal and further aid\r\nin classification, prominent, straight lines or directions passing\r\nthrough the center of a crystal are chosen as crystallographic axes.\r\nSuch axes may or may not coincide with symmetry axes. Basing our\r\ndefinitions upon both symmetry axes and crystallographic axes, the\r\nseven systems are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Isometric. There must be at least four threefold axes of symmetry,\r\nwhile the highest grade symmetry class of the five in the system\r\nincludes three fourfold, four threefold, and six twofold axes of\r\nsymmetry; nine planes of symmetry; and a center of symmetry. There are\r\nthree interchangeable crystallographic axes at right angles to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71.--Figures showing, a, crystal axes of Isometric\r\nsystem; b, points of emergence of the nine axes of symmetry in a cube\r\nof the Isometric system; c, nine planes of symmetry in a cubic crystal.\r\n(After Whitlock, New York State Museum.)]\r\n\r\n2. Tetragonal. There must be one and only one fourfold symmetry axis,\r\nwhile the highest of its seven symmetry classes contains also four\r\ntwofold axes of symmetry; five planes; and a center. Characterized by\r\nthree crystallographic axes at right angles to each other, only two of\r\nthem interchangeable.\r\n\r\n3. Trigonal. Characterized by one and only one threefold symmetry axis,\r\nthe highest of the five classes having also three twofold axes; four\r\nplanes; and a center. Crystallographic axes as for hexagonal.\r\n\r\n4. Hexagonal. One and only one sixfold axis of symmetry must\r\nbe present, but the highest of the seven classes also has six\r\ntwofold axes; seven planes; and a center. Characterized by four\r\ncrystallographic axes, one vertical and three interchangeable\r\nhorizontal axes making angles of 60 degrees with each other.\r\n\r\n5. Orthorhombic. There must be no axis of symmetry higher than a\r\ntwofold and three prominent directions (i.e., parallel to important\r\nfaces) at right angles to each other, the highest grade of the three\r\nclasses having three twofold axes; three planes; and a center. There\r\nare three noninterchangeable crystallographic axes at right angles.\r\n\r\n6. Monoclinic. There is no axis of symmetry higher than a twofold\r\nand only two prominent directions at right angles to each other, the\r\nhighest of the three classes having one twofold axis; one plane; and a\r\ncenter. There are three noninterchangeable crystallographic axes, only\r\ntwo of which are at right angles.\r\n\r\n7. Triclinic. There is no axis of symmetry of any kind, and there\r\nare no prominent directions at right angles. One of the two classes\r\nhas a center of symmetry only, and the other no symmetry at all.\r\nCharacterized by three noninterchangeable crystallographic axes, none\r\nat right angles.\r\n\r\nA fact which should be strongly emphasized is that crystals only, of\r\nall the objects of nature, can be definitely referred to the above\r\nseven systems comprising the 32 classes of symmetry, and 232 crystal\r\nforms. Since there are about 1,000 mineral species and only 232\r\nfundamental forms, it necessarily follows that two or more species may\r\ncrystallize in the same form within a class, so that it is not always\r\npossible to tell the species of mineral merely by its crystal form.\r\nIt is, however, a remarkable fact that, where two or more substances\r\ncrystallize in the same class (i.e., show the same grade of symmetry)\r\neach substance almost invariably exhibits \"crystal habit\" which is a\r\npronounced tendency to crystallize in certain relatively few forms or\r\ncombinations of forms out of the many possibilities. It is clear, then,\r\nthat grade of symmetry combined with \"habit\" are of great practical\r\nvalue in determining crystallized minerals, because, on the basis of\r\nsymmetry, a crystal is referred to a certain definite symmetry class in\r\nwhich only a limited number of substances crystallize, and then, by its\r\ncharacteristic \"habit,\" the particular substance can be told.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72.--Figures illustrating three crystal forms\r\nwith exactly the same symmetry elements; a and b are separate forms,\r\nand c is a combination of the two. The mineral \"garnet\" nearly always\r\ncrystallizes in one of these forms.]\r\n\r\nFrom the above discussion it should not be presumed that crystals\r\nalways develop with perfect geometric symmetry. As a matter of fact\r\nsuch is seldom the case because, due to variations of conditions or\r\ninterference of surrounding crystals in liquids (ordinary or molten), a\r\ncrystal usually grows more rapidly (by building out faces) in certain\r\ndirections than in others. Under such conditions actual crystals are\r\nsaid to become distorted because they are not geometrically perfect.\r\n\r\nWhether geometrically perfect or not, all crystals respond to the law\r\nof constancy of interfacial angles which means that on all crystals of\r\nthe same substances the angles between similar (corresponding) faces\r\nare always equal. This is one of the most fundamental and remarkable\r\nlaws of minerals. That it must be true follows from the fact that the\r\ncrystal faces merely outwardly express in definite form the definite\r\ninternal structure or arrangement of particles which have built up the\r\ncrystal. In other words, the real structural symmetry of a crystal\r\nnever varies no matter how much its geometric symmetry may vary.\r\nThe practical application of the law of constancy of interfacial\r\nangles lies in the fact that in many cases a mineral may actually be\r\nidentified merely by measuring the interfacial angles of its crystal\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe relative lengths of the crystallographic axes is a very important\r\nfeature of all crystals except those of the isometric system in which\r\nthe axes are always of equal length so that the ratio is 1:1:1. In\r\nall the other systems, however, at least one axis differs in length\r\nfrom the others and, since the amount of difference is absolutely\r\ncharacteristic of each substance, the axial ratio of a crystal, when\r\ncarefully determined by measurement of the angles between the different\r\nfaces, affords a never-failing method of determining the mineral\r\nfor all systems except the isometric. By way of illustration, the\r\ntetragonal crystal of the mineral zircon, with only one axis different\r\nin length, shows the very definite axial ratio 1:1:0.64, while the\r\northorhombic crystal of sulphur, with all three axes of different\r\nlengths, has an axial ratio 0.813:1:1.903. These ratios of course\r\nalways hold true no matter what the size or particular outward form of\r\nthe crystal.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected from the above discussion of the remarkable\r\nstructure of crystals, experience has proved that the relative lengths\r\nof all intercepts (or distances from the center) of all faces upon\r\nany crystal can be expressed by whole numbers, definite fractions, or\r\ninfinity. It necessarily follows that the ratios between the intercepts\r\nof the faces of any face on a crystal to those of any other face on\r\nthe same crystal may always be expressed by rational numbers, and this\r\nis known as the law of definite mathematical ratio. It is a remarkable\r\nfact that very small whole numbers or fractions, or infinity or zero,\r\nwill always express the intercepts of any crystal face.\r\n\r\nThus far our discussion has centered about crystals as individuals,\r\nbut, in most cases by far, they form groups or aggregates. Most\r\ncommonly crystal grouping is very irregular, but by no means rare\r\nis parallel grouping where whole crystals, or more usually parts of\r\ncrystals, have all corresponding parts exactly parallel. But most\r\nremarkable of all are the twin crystals in which two or more crystals\r\nintergrown or in contact have all corresponding parts in exactly\r\nreverse order. The conditioning circumstances under which twin crystals\r\ndevelop are unknown.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the facts and principles above explained, the reader\r\nwill more than likely agree with the author that crystals rank very\r\nhigh among nature's most wonderful objects. But there are still other\r\ncharacteristic features of crystals naturally resulting from their\r\nmarvelous structure. Some of these will now be briefly referred to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73.--Figures illustrating twin crystals: a, gypsum\r\n(Monoclinic system); b, fluorite (Isometric system); c, cassiterite\r\n(Tetragonal system). (After New York State Museum Bulletin.)]\r\n\r\nMany crystals and crystalline substances exhibit the important property\r\nknown as cleavage which is the marked tendency to break easily in\r\ncertain directions yielding more or less smooth plane surfaces. As\r\nwould be expected, a cleavage surface is always parallel to an actual,\r\nor at least a possible, crystal face, and it takes place along the\r\nsurfaces of weaker molecular cohesion. The degree of cleavage varies\r\nfrom almost perfect, as in mica, to very poor or none at all, as in\r\nquartz. The number of cleavage directions exhibited by common minerals\r\nis illustrated as follows: mica, one; feldspar, two; calcite, three;\r\nand fluorite, four.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking fact that when a crystal or cleavage piece is placed\r\nin a solvent, the action proceeds with different velocities in\r\ncrystallographically different directions and little pits or cavities,\r\ncalled etching figures, are developed on some or all of the faces.\r\nSince the symmetry of these etching figures and their arrangement upon\r\nthe faces are directly related to, and natural effects of the crystal\r\nsymmetry, the figures often furnish an important method of placing\r\na doubtful crystal or even merely a cleavage fragment in its proper\r\nsymmetry class.\r\n\r\nAnother marvelous property of crystals and crystalline substances\r\nis their effect upon light. Since the study of the passage of light\r\nthrough crystals has really become a large separate branch of\r\nmineralogical study, we can no more than state a few fundamental facts\r\nand principles in the short space at our disposal. Light is caused by\r\nvibrations of the so-called \"ether,\" and always travels in straight\r\nlines. The vibration directions are at right angles to the direction\r\nof transmission of the light. When a ray of light enters a crystal\r\nor crystalline mineral representing any crystal system except the\r\nisometric it is doubly refracted (i.e., broken into two rays), each\r\nof the two rays is polarized (i.e., made to vibrate in a single plane\r\nonly), and one ray vibrates almost at right angles to the other. Double\r\nrefraction is strikingly shown by placing a piece of clear calcite\r\n(Iceland spar) over a dot on paper when two dots instead of one are\r\nvisible. The amount of double refraction varies with the substance, and\r\nin some degree according to the direction of passage of light through\r\na crystal. Isometric crystals only are singly refracting and hence a\r\nray of light is not affected in passing through them. Crystals of all\r\nthe other six systems doubly refract and polarize light and in three\r\nsystems--tetragonal, hexagonal, and trigonal--one direction (coincident\r\nwith the main axis of symmetry) produces single refraction only,\r\nwhile in the remaining three systems--orthorhombic, monoclinic, and\r\ntriclinic--there are always two directions of single refraction whose\r\npositions vary with the substance. Many crystals outside the isometric\r\nsystem also exhibit a remarkable tendency to absorb light differently\r\nin different crystallographic directions, thus producing two or three\r\ncolor tints, which vary according to the substance. After gaining a\r\npractical knowledge of the above and many other optical properties\r\nof crystals, it is possible by the aid of a specially constructed\r\n(polarizing) microscope, to recognize (with few exceptions) each one of\r\nthe many mineral species. This method is of great value in determining\r\nthe various minerals which are aggregated in the form of a rock, in\r\nwhich case a very thin slice of the rock is studied with the microscope.\r\n\r\nAn important criterion for the recognition of minerals is hardness,\r\nby which is meant the resistance of a smooth surface to abrasion or\r\nscratching. The generally adopted scale of hardness follows:\r\n\r\n  1.--Soft, greasy feel, and easily scratched by the finger nail (e.g.,\r\n        talc).\r\n\r\n  2.--Just scratched by the finger nail (e.g., gypsum).\r\n\r\n  3.--Just scratched by a copper coin (e.g., calcite).\r\n\r\n  4.--Easily cut by a knife, but does not cut glass (e.g., fluorite).\r\n\r\n  5.--Just scratches soft glass, and is cut by a knife (e.g., apatite).\r\n\r\n  6.--Harder than steel, and scratches glass easily (e.g., orthoclase).\r\n\r\n  7, 8, 9, and 10.--Harder than any ordinary substance and\r\n        represented in order by quartz, topaz, corundum, and diamond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 17.--Skeleton of the Great Two-Legged, Carnivorous\r\nDinosaur Reptile, Called \"Tyrannosaurus,\" Which Lived During Cretaceous\r\nTime.

Length about twelve feet. Parts of skeletons of unborn\r\nyoung are seen. (_Courtesy of the American Museum of Natural History._)\r\n\r\nMinerals also show a great variety of colors. Many of them like quartz\r\nand calcite are colorless or white, others like galena (steel-gray)\r\nand pyrite (brass-yellow) show inherently characteristic colors, while\r\nstill others like amethyst (purple) and sapphire (blue) are colored by\r\nimpurities.\r\n\r\nThere is also a great range in relative weights or density of minerals,\r\ncommonly called the specific gravity, which range from less than one\r\nfor ice to 21.5 for platinum, and even somewhat higher. The average\r\nspecific gravity of all minerals of the earth is about 2.6.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the above discussion of the general properties of\r\nminerals, we shall now proceed to name and briefly describe some of the\r\nminerals which are either very common, or of special interest, or of\r\nspecial economic importance. Only those features are listed by which\r\nthe mineral species may be recognized at sight, or by the aid of very\r\nsimple nonchemical tests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74.--Drawings showing forms of crystals of common\r\nminerals: a and b, garnet (Isometric); c and d, feldspars (Monoclinic);\r\ne, f, and g, quartz (Trigonal); h, i, and j, calcite (Hexagonal); k,\r\naugite (Monoclinic); l. hornblende (Monoclinic); m, pyrite (Isometric).]\r\n\r\nAmphibole. A number of species closely related in composition, crystal\r\nform, and properties are here included. They are silicates of lime\r\nand magnesia usually with aluminum and iron. Most common by far are\r\nthose which crystallize in the monoclinic system with prismatic faces\r\nand two good prismatic cleavages meeting at about 24 degrees. Color,\r\ncommonly brown to black, but sometimes green or white. Hardness varies\r\nfrom 5 to 6, and specific gravity from 3 to 3.4. _Hornblende_, the\r\nmost common species, is a dark colored silicate of lime, magnesia,\r\naluminum, and iron. It is one of the few most common of all mineral\r\nspecies, especially in igneous and metamorphic rocks. _Tremolite_ is\r\na white to light gray silicate of lime and magnesia found especially\r\nin metamorphic limestones. _Actinolite_ is a green silicate of lime,\r\nmagnesia, and iron especially common in certain metamorphic rocks. One\r\nkind of jade is an amphibole similar to tremolite and actinolite in\r\ncomposition, while the other kind is a pyroxene (see below). _Jade_ is\r\nand has been highly prized in the east (especially in China) where it\r\nhas been carved into many objects of exceptional variety and beauty.\r\nJade is probably the toughest (not hardest) of all minerals because of\r\nits wonderful microscopically fibrous structure. In color it is white,\r\ngray, and green.\r\n\r\nApatite. Crystallizes in the hexagonal system with a six-sided prism\r\nusually capped at each end by a six-sided pyramid (see Figure 75g).\r\nComposition, a phosphate of lime. Color variable, but mostly white,\r\ngreen, or brown. Hardness of 5, or just enough to scratch soft glass.\r\nSpecific gravity, 3.2. No good cleavage. Tiny crystals are widely\r\ndisseminated through many common rocks--igneous, metamorphic, and\r\nsedimentary. In certain metamorphic limestones excellent crystals\r\na foot or more in length have been found. Apatite, mostly in\r\nuncrystallized form, is the source of most of our phosphate fertilizers.\r\n\r\nAzurite. An azure-blue hydrous carbonate of copper which crystallizes\r\ncommonly in small monoclinic crystals. Hardness, nearly 4, and specific\r\ngravity, nearly 4. Commonly occurs in veins deposited by underground\r\nwater. One of the great ores of copper, especially in Arizona, Chile,\r\nand Australia.\r\n\r\nBarite. A sulphate of barium crystallizing in orthorhombic prisms\r\nusually of tabular habit. White to light color shades. Hardness, 3.5;\r\nspecific gravity, 4.5, which is notably higher than the average of\r\nlight-colored minerals. Three good cleavages parallel to principal\r\ncrystal faces. A common and widely distributed mineral, especially in\r\nmany vein deposits associated with certain ores. Used in ground form to\r\ngive weight to certain kinds of paper and cloth, and a barium compound\r\nused for refining sugar is made from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75.--Crystal forms cf common minerals: a, galena\r\n(Isometric); b, sphalerite (Isometric); c, beryl (Hexagonal);\r\nd, hematite (Hexagonal); e, magnetite (Isometric); f, barite\r\n(Orthorhombic); g, apatite (Hexagonal); h. sulphur (Monoclinic);\r\ni, gypsum (Monoclinic); j, chalcopyrite (Tetragonal); k, fluorite\r\n(Isometric); l, zircon (Tetragonal); m, tourmaline (Trigonal); n,\r\ncorundum (Hexagonal).]\r\n\r\nBeryl. A silicate of aluminum and the rare chemical element beryllium.\r\nHexagonal crystals usually of very simple six-sided prismatic habit\r\n(see Figure 75c). Color white, green, blue, or yellow. Specific\r\ngravity, 2.8. Cleavage practically absent. It is a very exceptionally\r\nhard mineral, being 8 in the scale. Very large crystals have been\r\nfound, as, for example, in New Hampshire, where single crystals several\r\nfeet long weigh a ton or more. Beryl is also of special interest\r\nbecause two of its varieties--_emerald_ (green) and _aquamarine_\r\n(blue)--are well-known gem stones, the emerald being one of the most\r\nhighly prized gems. The colors are due to slight impurities. Beryl most\r\ncommonly occurs in dikes of coarse granite called pegmatite, but also\r\nin certain metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.\r\n\r\nCalcite. Commonly called \"calc spar.\" A carbonate of lime. Hexagonal\r\ncrystals in a great variety of forms, but all with crystal faces\r\narranged in sixes around the principal or vertical axis forming\r\nrhombohedrons, prisms, or double-pointed pyramids. The principal axis\r\nof symmetry is sixfold by a combination of rotation and reflection.\r\nVery perfect cleavages in three directions yielding fragments whose\r\nfaces make angles of 75 and 105 degrees. Color, white when pure, but\r\nvariously colored when impure. Hardness, 3 (very easily scratched by\r\na knife); specific gravity, 2.7. Calcite is a very common mineral,\r\nespecially in limestone (including _chalk_) and marble which are\r\nusually largely made up of it. Also commonly found in veins, and as\r\nspring and cave deposits (stalactites). A porous, stringy variety,\r\ncalled _travertine_, is deposited by certain hot springs, as at Mammoth\r\nHot Springs in Yellowstone Park. A very transparent crystalline variety\r\nis called _Iceland spar_. Calcite is a very useful mineral. Limestone\r\nand marble are widely used as a building stone, and for decorative\r\npurposes, statuary, etc. Limestone is burned for quicklime, used as a\r\nflux in smelting certain ores, in glass making, etc.\r\n\r\nCassiterite. The one great ore of tin whose composition is oxide of\r\ntin. Tetragonal crystallization (Figure 73c). Hardness greater than\r\nsteel, being over 6 in the scale. Specific gravity 7, which is notably\r\nhigh. Color, brown to nearly black. Cleavage, practically absent.\r\nFairly widespread in small amounts, and in commercial quantities in\r\nonly a few localities, usually in veins in granite or metamorphic rocks\r\nnear granite, as at Cornwall, England, also in the form of rounded\r\nmasses in gravel deposition as in the Malay region.\r\n\r\nChalcocite. Crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, usually in tabular\r\nform, but crystals not common. A black sulphide of copper with metallic\r\nluster. Hardness, nearly 3; specific gravity, nearly 6. No cleavage.\r\nChalcocite occurs in vein deposits as one of the important copper ores,\r\nespecially at Butte, Montana.\r\n\r\nChalcopyrite. Known as \"copper pyrites,\" (Figure 75j). A deep\r\nbrass-yellow sulphide of iron and copper. Seldom crystallized in\r\ntetragonal forms. Hardness, 3.5; specific gravity, over 4. No cleavage.\r\nMetallic luster. Widely distributed in vein deposits associated\r\nwith other metal-bearing minerals. A very important ore of copper,\r\nespecially at Rio Tinto, Spain.\r\n\r\nChlorite. A soft, green mineral, usually in small tabular crystals,\r\nin general appearance much like mica (see below), but unlike mica,\r\nthe almost perfect cleavage leaves are not elastic, though they are\r\nflexible. Composition, a silicate of aluminum and magnesia. Always of\r\nsecondary origin as a result of chemical alteration of certain other\r\nminerals, such as biotite-mica, pyroxene or amphibole.\r\n\r\nCinnabar. A vermilion-red sulphide of mercury. An extra soft metallic\r\nmineral, only 2.5 in the scale. Specific gravity over 8, which is\r\nnotably high. Completely vaporizes on being heated. Small trigonal\r\ncrystals rare. Cinnabar is the one great ore of mercury, occurring in\r\nveins, especially in California and Spain.\r\n\r\nCopper. Copper as such (so-called \"native copper\") is widely\r\ndistributed in veins, usually in small amounts with other copper\r\nminerals, but in the great mines of northern Michigan it occurs in\r\nimmense quantities as the only important ore. It is readily recognized\r\nby its color, softness (less than 3), and notable weight (specific\r\ngravity, nearly 9). Isometric crystals uncommon.\r\n\r\nCorundum. An oxide of aluminum of hexagonal crystallization, usually\r\nin six-sided prisms, capped by very steep pyramidal faces (see Figure\r\n75n). It is next to the hardest of all known minerals (9 in the scale),\r\nthe diamond only exceeding it. Specific gravity about 4. Three good\r\ncleavages making angles of nearly 90 degrees with each other. The\r\ncolor of corundum is usually brown, but it varies greatly. Two of the\r\nmost highly prized of all precious stones--_ruby_ (red) and _sapphire_\r\n(blue)--are nearly transparent varieties of corundum, colored by\r\ncertain impurities. _Oriental topaz_ (yellow), _oriental emerald_\r\n(green), and _oriental amethyst_ (purple) are also clear varieties of\r\ncorundum. It occurs in various igneous and metamorphic rocks, and in\r\nsome stream gravels. The finest rubies, associated with some sapphires,\r\noccur in gravels in Burma, Siam, and Ceylon. _Emery_ is a fine-grained\r\nmixture of corundum and other minerals, especially magnetite.\r\n\r\nDiamond. This mineral is remarkable not only because it is the king\r\nof precious stones, but also because it is easily the hardest known\r\nsubstance (10 in the scale). Specific gravity, 3.5. Very brilliant\r\nluster. Crystals of usually octahedral habit in the isometric system.\r\nUsually colorless, but often variously tinted. Composition, pure\r\ncarbon. Burns completely away at high temperature. The greatest mines\r\nin the world are in South Africa, where the diamonds occur in masses of\r\nrather soft (decomposed) igneous rock, evidently having crystallized\r\nduring the cooling of the molten masses. In Brazil and India diamonds\r\nare found in stream gravels.\r\n\r\nFeldspar Group. The feldspars are by far the most abundant of all\r\nminerals in the crust of the earth. (Figures 74c, 74d.) There are\r\nseveral important species or varieties of feldspar with certain\r\nfeatures in common as follows: crystal forms, either monoclinic\r\nor triclinic (closely resembling monoclinic), in prismatic forms\r\nwhose faces usually meet at or near 90 or 120 degrees; two good\r\ncleavages at or near 90 degrees, hardness at or near 6; specific\r\ngravity, a little over 2.5; color, usually white, gray, or pink; and\r\ncomposition, silicate of aluminum with potash, soda, or lime. The two\r\npotash feldspars are _orthoclase_ and _microcline_, the former being\r\nmonoclinic, with cleavages at exactly 90 degrees, and the latter\r\ntriclinic, with cleavages a little less than 90 degrees. A kind of\r\ngreen microcline is known as _Amazon stone_. The soda-lime feldspars\r\ngo by the general name _plagioclase_. They are triclinic, with\r\ncleavages meeting at approximately 86 degrees. Very commonly one of\r\nthe cleavage faces exhibits characteristic, well defined striations\r\nor fine parallel lines caused by multiple twinning during crystal\r\ngrowth. Some of the common plagioclases are _albite_, a white soda\r\nfeldspar, including most so-called _moonstone_; _oligoclase_, a usually\r\ngreenish-white to reddish-gray soda-lime feldspar including _sunstone_;\r\nand _labradorite_, a lime-soda feldspar, usually gray to greenish-gray\r\nwith a beautiful play of colors. The feldspars occur in all three great\r\ngroups of rocks, but they have most commonly crystallized during the\r\ncooling of molten masses of igneous rocks. Where many sedimentary rocks\r\nhave undergone great change (metamorphism) under conditions of heat,\r\npressure, and moisture, feldspars have very commonly formed. Orthoclase\r\nand microcline feldspar are used in the manufacture of porcelain and\r\nchinaware. Some special varieties of feldspar are cut or polished for\r\nsemiprecious stones or decorative purposes.\r\n\r\nFluorite. A common mineral whose composition is fluoride of lime.\r\n(Figure 73b.) Isometric crystals, usually cubes with edges modified,\r\nare common. Twinned cubes are also common. Easily scratched by a\r\nknife (hardness, 4), and specific gravity a little over 3. Clear\r\nand colorless when pure, but variously colored, especially green,\r\nblue, yellow, and brown, due to impurities in solution during\r\ncrystallization. Remarkable because of its four good cleavages meeting\r\nat such angles as to permit good cleavage octahedrons to be broken out\r\nof crystals. Fluorite is widely distributed, most commonly in vein\r\ndeposits, often associated with metallic ores. Occurs also as crystals\r\nin some limestones and igneous rocks. Some fissure veins of fluorite\r\nin limestone in southern Illinois are twenty to forty feet wide. Used\r\nmostly as a flux in the manufacture of certain steel, in glass making,\r\nand in making enamel ware.\r\n\r\nGalena. Commonly as isometric crystals either as cubes or combinations\r\nof cubes and octahedrons. Composition, sulphide of lead. (Figure 75a.)\r\nColor, lead-gray with metallic luster. Hardness, 2.5; specific gravity\r\nhigh, 7.5. Very brittle. Three excellent cleavages at right angles and\r\nparallel to the crystal faces of the cube. Nearly all of the lead of\r\ncommerce comes from the smelting of galena. It is mined in many parts\r\nof the world where it nearly always occurs in typical vein deposits\r\noften associated with sphalerite (see below).\r\n\r\nGarnet Group. The members of this very interesting mineral group very\r\ncommonly occur in isometric crystallized forms, mostly twelve and\r\ntwenty-four faced figures or both combined, as shown by Figure 72. All\r\nthe six species of garnets are silicates, mostly of aluminum usually\r\nwith either lime, magnesia, or iron. Cleavage, very imperfect or\r\nabsent. Hardness great, 6.5 to 7.5, and specific gravity 3.1 to 4.3,\r\nvarying according to species. Color also varies with composition, but\r\nmost commonly red, brown, and more rarely yellow, black, and green.\r\nGarnets are most common as crystals embedded in metamorphic rocks,\r\nespecially highly altered strata. Also occurs in many igneous rocks and\r\nin some sands. Commonly used as a semiprecious stone, and also ground\r\nfor use as an abrasive, especially in making a kind of sand (or garnet)\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nGold. Gold as such (\"native gold\") is, in small amounts, really a very\r\nwidely distributed mineral. It is characterized by its yellow color,\r\nsoftness (less than 3 in the scale), great weight (specific gravity,\r\nover 19), and extreme malleability. Most of the commercial gold occurs\r\nin river gravels (so-called \"placer deposits\"), and in veins associated\r\nwith the very common mineral quartz.\r\n\r\nGraphite. Commonly called \"black lead,\" but it is not lead at all. Its\r\ncomposition is pure carbon--the same as that of the diamond. We here\r\nhave a very remarkable example of a single substance (carbon) which,\r\naccording to circumstances, crystallizes in two distinctly different\r\nsystems (diamond in isometric, and graphite in hexagonal) yielding very\r\nthin, flexible flakes; greasy in feel; and easily rubs off on paper. It\r\nweighs less than the average mineral (specific gravity, a little over\r\n2). Good crystals of hexagonal tabular form are rare. The most natural\r\nhome of graphite is in the metamorphic rocks, especially certain of\r\nthe highly altered strata, where it occurs in the form of more or less\r\nabundant flakes, having originated from organic matter. Some also\r\noccurs in igneous rocks and in veins. Large quantities are made at\r\nNiagara Falls from anthracite by electricity.\r\n\r\nGypsum. Monoclinic crystals common, usually of simple forms, as shown\r\nby Figure 75i. Sometimes twin crystals. Composition, sulphate of lime.\r\nColorless or white when pure. Can be scratched by the finger nail\r\n(hardness, 2). Specific gravity, 2.3. Three good cleavages, especially\r\nthe prismatic, yielding cleavage plates with angles of 66 and 114\r\ndegrees. Thin cleavage layers, moderately flexible. There are several\r\nvarieties: (1) _selenite_, which is clear, crystalline; (2) _satin\r\nspar_, fibrous with silky luster; (3) _alabaster_, fine-grained and\r\ncompact crystalline; and (4) _rock gypsum_, massive granular or earthy.\r\nGypsum is common and widespread especially among stratified rocks\r\noften as thick beds which have mostly resulted from evaporation of\r\nbodies of water containing it in solution, and often associated with\r\nsalt beds. Also occurs as scattering crystals in shales and clays, and\r\nin some veins. In greatest quantities it is burned to make plaster\r\nof Paris. Satin spar and alabaster are often cut and polished for\r\nornaments, etc. (See Figure 73a.)\r\n\r\nHalite. Common salt. Composition, chloride of soda. Isometric crystals,\r\nnearly always in cubes with three good cleavages at right angles, and\r\nparallel to the faces of the cube. Hardness, 2.5; specific gravity,\r\n2.5. Colorless to white when pure. Characteristic salty taste. Abundant\r\nand widespread, often as extensive strata in rocks of nearly all ages,\r\nhaving resulted from evaporation of inland bodies of salt water. Also\r\nin vast quantities in solution in salt lakes and the sea. Halite\r\nhas many uses, as for example, cooking and preservative purposes,\r\nindirectly in glass making and soap making, glazing pottery, and in\r\nmany ore-smelting and chemical processes.\r\n\r\nHematite.--One of the common and important iron oxides with less iron\r\nthan magnetite and no water as has limonite. Crystallizes in hexagonal\r\nforms. Color, black, with metallic luster, when crystalline, otherwise\r\nusually dull red. Hardness, about 6; specific gravity, about 5. No\r\ncleavage. Red streak when rubbed on rough porcelain. Hematite is\r\nextremely widespread in rocks of all ages, especially in metamorphic\r\nand sedimentary rocks. Some occurs as crystals in igneous rocks, and\r\nsome in vein deposits. It is the greatest ore of iron in the United\r\nStates, especially in Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Alabama.\r\n\r\nKaolin. Commonly called \"China clay.\" Composition, a hydrous silicate\r\nof aluminum. Crystallizes in scalelike monoclinic forms, but usually\r\nforms compact claylike masses. Hardness, a little over 2; specific\r\ngravity, 2.6. Color when pure, white. Usually feels smooth and plastic.\r\nVery abundant and widespread, especially forming the main body of clay\r\nand of much shale. Always of secondary origin, generally resulting from\r\nthe decomposition of feldspar. It is the main constituent of chinaware,\r\npottery, porcelain, tiles, bricks, etc.\r\n\r\nLimonite. An important oxide of iron in composition like hematite\r\nexcept for its variable water content. Never crystallized. Hardness,\r\nabout 5; specific gravity, nearly 4. Color, light to dark brown to\r\nnearly black. Leaves a characteristic yellowish-brown streak when\r\nrubbed on rough porcelain. Exceedingly common and widely distributed,\r\nalways as a mineral of secondary origin as a product of weathering\r\nof various iron-bearing minerals. Where accumulated in considerable\r\ndeposits it is an iron ore of some importance.\r\n\r\nMagnetite. One of the three important oxides of iron containing no\r\nwater, and richer in iron than hematite. (See Figure 75e.) Commonly\r\ncrystallizes in isometric octahedral forms alone or combined with\r\ntwelve-faced forms. Hardness, 6; specific gravity, 5. Color, black\r\nwith metallic luster. Leaves black streaks on rough porcelain.\r\nCharacteristically highly magnetic. Wide-spread as crystals in nearly\r\nall kinds of igneous rocks, and as large segregation masses in certain\r\nigneous rocks. Also very common in metamorphic rocks, in many cases\r\nforming lenses and beds as ore deposits. Occurs in some strata and\r\nsands. It is an important ore of iron.\r\n\r\nMalachite. A light-green hydrous carbonate of copper. In almost every\r\nway, except difference in color and slight difference in composition,\r\nit is very much like azurite (see above).\r\n\r\nMica Group. The micas rank high in abundance among the most common\r\nminerals of the earth. All of the several species are silicates of\r\naluminum combined with other chemical elements according to the\r\nspecies. All crystallize in monoclinic six-sided prisms whose angles\r\nare nearly 120 degrees. These prisms closely approach true hexagonal\r\nforms. All are characterized by one exceedingly good cleavage at right\r\nangles to the prismatic faces, yielding very thin elastic cleavage\r\nsheets. Hardness, 2 to 2.5; specific gravity, 2.7 to 3. The various\r\nspecies or varieties are not always sharply separated from each other.\r\nMost common are: _muscovite_, or so-called _isinglass_, a potash mica\r\nwhich is colorless and transparent in thin sheets when pure; _biotite_,\r\nan iron-magnesia mica, black to dark green; and _phlogopite_, a brown\r\nmagnesia mica.\r\n\r\nOlivine. Often called _chrysolite_. A silicate of iron and magnesia.\r\nOrthorhombic crystals, usually in stout prismatic form. Color, usually\r\nyellowish green. Hardness, nearly 7; specific gravity, 3.3. Transparent\r\nto translucent. No real cleavage. Its hardness, color, and crystal form\r\ngenerally characterize it. It is a fairly common mineral found mainly\r\nas crystalline grains in certain dark-colored igneous rocks. A clear\r\ngreen variety, called _peridot_, is used as a gem stone.\r\n\r\nOpal. An oxide of silicon, like quartz in composition except that it\r\nis combined with a varying amount of water. It never crystallizes,\r\nprobably because of its rather indefinite composition. Hardness 5.5\r\nto 6.5 (softer than quartz); specific gravity, about 2. Varieties\r\nvariously colored. _Common opal_, usually translucent with greasy\r\nluster. _Precious opal_, translucent with beautiful play of colors,\r\nused as a gem. _Fire opal_, with bright red to orange internal\r\nreflections. _Hyalite_, colorless and transparent in small rounded\r\nmasses. _Wood opal_, wood petrified by opal. _Geyserite_, a white,\r\nporous, stringy variety deposited by certain hot springs like\r\nthe Yellowstone geysers. _Tripolite_, fine-grained, chalklike in\r\nappearance, consisting of tiny siliceous shells of very simple plants\r\ncalled diatoms.\r\n\r\nPlatinum. This mineral occurs as an impure native metal, usually\r\nalloyed with certain other metals. Native platinum, hardness, 4.5\r\n(exceptionally high for a metal); specific gravity as usually alloyed,\r\n14 to 19. Pure platinum, specific gravity, over 21, or one of the very\r\nheaviest known substances. Color, light steel-gray, with metallic\r\nluster. Very malleable and ductile. A rare metal found commercially\r\nmostly in gravel or \"placer\" deposits mostly in the Ural Mountains,\r\nalso as grains in certain dark igneous rocks. Used for many scientific\r\ninstruments, in the electrical industry, as jewelry, etc.\r\n\r\nPyrite. Commonly called \"iron pyrites.\" Sometimes called \"fool's gold.\"\r\n(See Figure 74m.) A sulphide of iron which commonly crystallizes in\r\nthe isometric system mostly as cubes, twelve-faced pyritohedrons,\r\noctahedrons, or combinations of these. Color, light brass-yellow, with\r\nmetallic luster. Cleavage, practically absent. Hardness, greater than\r\nthat of steel (over 6 in the scale); specific gravity, about 5. Leaves\r\ngreenish black streak when rubbed on rough porcelain. Differs from\r\nchalcopyrite by paler color and much greater hardness. It is a common\r\nand very widely disseminated mineral in rocks of all kinds and ages,\r\nbut especially in metamorphic rocks as veins, and banded or lenslike\r\ndeposits. Most igneous rocks contain small scattering grains of pyrite.\r\nMany deposits of commercial value are known. Great quantities are\r\nburned for the manufacture of sulphuric acid (\"oil of vitriol\") which\r\nis one of the most important of all chemicals.\r\n\r\nPyroxene Group. Along with quartz and feldspars, the pyroxenes rank\r\namong the most common of all minerals. (See Figure 74k.) Composition,\r\nvery similar to amphibole (see above). Pyroxenes crystallizing in the\r\nmonoclinic system are the most important. These crystals are prismatic\r\nin habit, with prism faces making angles of nearly 45 or 90 degrees\r\ninstead of about 124 degrees as in the monoclinic amphiboles which\r\nthe monoclinic pyroxenes greatly resemble. Two fairly good prismatic\r\ncleavages cross at an angle of nearly 90 degrees, instead of at\r\nabout 124 degrees as in the monoclinic amphiboles. Hardness, 5 to 6;\r\nspecific gravity, 3.2 to 3.6. Color, variable according to species.\r\nThe most common variety of pyroxene is _augite_, a dark-green to black\r\nsilicate of aluminum, iron, lime, and magnesia. Certain pyroxenes also\r\ncrystallize in the orthorhombic system. Pyroxene is most abundantly\r\nrepresented as crystals in many kinds of igneous and metamorphic rocks.\r\nIt is practically useless except as one kind of _jade_.\r\n\r\nQuartz. Next to the feldspars, quartz is probably the most common\r\nof all minerals, especially at and near the earth's surface. (See\r\nFigures 74e, 74f, and 74g.) Composition, oxide of silicon. Often\r\ncrystallizes in the trigonal system almost always as six-sided prisms\r\ncapped by six-sided pyramids, which are really combined three-sided\r\nforms, often with alternate corners modified by small faces. These\r\nsmall modifying faces, etching figures, and microscopic tests show that\r\nquartz is really trigonal in spite of the common occurrence of simple\r\nsix-sided outward forms. The pyramidal faces make different angles\r\nthan those of either apatite or beryl, both of which are somewhat\r\nlike quartz in crystal form. Hardness, 7 (distinctly high, cannot be\r\nscratched by the knife); specific gravity, 2.6 (about average for\r\nall minerals). Cleavage, practically absent, and breaks like glass.\r\nColorless when pure, but varieties exhibit many colors. A few only of\r\nthe many varieties will be briefly described. Among the distinctly\r\ncrystalline varieties are: _rock crystal_, pure colorless; _amethyst_,\r\npurple; _rose quartz_, pink; _milky quartz_, white; and _smoky quartz_,\r\ndark--due to tiny inclusions of carbon. Among the fine-grained, compact\r\nmore or less indistinctly crystalline or noncrystalline varieties,\r\nusually translucent with a waxy luster, are: _chalcedony_, bluish\r\ngray, waxy looking, usually in small rounded masses; _carnelian_,\r\nred; _prase_, green; _agate_, with parallel bands, usually variously\r\ncolored; _flint_ and _jasper_, opaque to translucent, dark to red.\r\n\r\nQuartz is exceedingly abundant in all the great groups of rocks. It\r\nconstitutes the main bulk of sandstones, is common in shales, and\r\noccurs in certain other strata. In many igneous rocks, like granite, it\r\nis a very prominent constituent. Most of the metamorphic rocks contain\r\nits crystalline forms in greater or less amounts. Quartz is the most\r\ncommon of all vein minerals, in many cases associated with valuable\r\nores. Various varieties are widely used for ornamental purposes. Used\r\nin making sandpaper, glass, porcelain, mortar, concrete, and in certain\r\nore-smelting processes. Sandstone is widely used as a building stone.\r\n\r\nSerpentine. A hydrous silicate of magnesia never in distinct\r\ncrystals as such, but shown to be monoclinic under the microscope.\r\nHardness variable, 2.5 to 5; specific gravity, about 2.6. Mostly of\r\nvariegated green or yellowish green color with waxy luster, except\r\na fibrous variety (_asbestos_) which is light green to white. The\r\nfibrous variety of serpentine is the principal source of asbestos, an\r\namphibole asbestos being less common. Ordinary serpentine (sometimes\r\nmiscalled \"green marble\") is widely used as a building and decorative\r\nstone. Serpentine is common and widespread, especially in igneous and\r\nmetamorphic rocks, but never as a really original mineral. It always\r\nresults from alteration of certain other magnesia-bearing silicate\r\nminerals, such as pyroxene, amphibole, olivine, etc.\r\n\r\nSilver. Native silver is not a very rare mineral and it is mined in\r\ncertain parts of the world, but most of the metal is obtained from\r\ncertain silver-bearing minerals, especially sulphides and a chloride.\r\nSilver crystallizes rather rarely in the isometric system. More\r\ncommonly it occurs as irregular masses, plates, and wirelike forms.\r\nCharacterized by its color, metallic luster, softness (less than 3 in\r\nthe scale), and exceptional weight (specific gravity, 10.5). Usually\r\noccurs in vein deposits, commonly associated with other metals or\r\nmetal-bearing minerals, especially copper.\r\n\r\nSphalerite. A sulphide of zinc commonly in crystalline form belonging\r\nin the isometric system, especially in tetrahedral combination forms\r\n(see Figure 75b). Color, usually brown, yellow or nearly black with\r\nresinous luster. Hardness, nearly 4; specific gravity, 4. Several good\r\ncleavages, yielding fragments whose faces meet at 90 and 120 degrees.\r\nSphalerite is a fairly common and widespread mineral, occurring nearly\r\nalways in veins in most kinds of rocks. It is very often associated\r\nwith other ores, particularly the great ore of lead (galena).\r\nSphalerite is by far the greatest ore of zinc.\r\n\r\nSulphur. Native sulphur. Crystallization, orthorhombic, usually in\r\ncombination pyramidal forms. (See Figure 75h.) Characterized by\r\nyellow color, resinous luster, softness (about 2 in the scale),\r\nlow specific gravity (about 2), and very poor cleavages. It has\r\nmost commonly resulted from alteration of certain sulphur-bearing\r\nminerals, especially gypsum, the decomposition of which has yielded\r\nvast deposits. Some also of volcanic origin. Great quantities are\r\nused in making sulphuric acid, matches, gunpowder, fireworks, and for\r\nvulcanizing and bleaching rubber goods.\r\n\r\nTalc. Often called _steatite_. Monoclinic crystals rare. One perfect\r\ncleavage, yielding very thin, flexible leaves. Very soft (hardness,\r\n1). Feels greasy, and looks waxy to pearly. Color, white, gray, to\r\nlight green. Specific gravity, 2.8. Composition, a hydrous silicate of\r\nmagnesia, much like that of serpentine. Talc is always of secondary\r\norigin, generally derived by chemical alteration of various common\r\nminerals rich in silicate of magnesia. _Soapstone_ is a common variety\r\nresulting from alteration of whole rock masses. Soapstone has many\r\npractical uses as for washtubs, table tops, electrical switchboards,\r\nhearthstones, stove and furnace linings, blackboards, gas tips, etc.\r\nTalc proper is used as a lubricant, to weight paper, in soap, as\r\ndustless crayon, talcum powder, etc.\r\n\r\nTopaz. A silicate of aluminum and fluorine. Orthorhombic crystals\r\ncommon, usually prisms capped at one end by pyramided faces and\r\nabruptly terminated at the other. Colorless when pure, but often\r\nvariously colored due to impurities. Very exceptionally hard (8 in\r\nthe scale); specific gravity, 3.5. One good cleavage across the prism\r\nzone; usually found as crystals in, and in cavities in, igneous rocks.\r\nAppears always to have formed from highly heated vapors or liquids\r\ngiven off by cooling molten rock masses. Topaz is one of the more\r\nhighly prized of the gem stones.\r\n\r\nTourmaline. Composition, very complex, but chiefly a silicate of boron\r\nand several metals and semimetals. Commonly as crystals in the trigonal\r\nsystem in both long and short prismatic forms, as shown by Figure 75m,\r\nwith opposite ends not unlike. Extra hard (7 in the scale); specific\r\ngravity, about 3. Color, widely various, but brown and black are most\r\ncommon. Practically no cleavage. Tourmaline probably always originated\r\nas a high temperature mineral, especially as crystals in granites\r\nand related rocks and in certain metamorphic rocks which have been\r\nsubjected to high temperature and pressure. Certain transparent colored\r\nvarieties of tourmaline rank high among the semiprecious stones.\r\n\r\nTurquoise. A hydrous phosphate of aluminum. Massive noncrystalline,\r\nblue to green, waxy luster, mostly opaque, hardness of 6, and specific\r\ngravity of about 2.7. Turquoise is a high temperature mineral found in\r\nveins and cavities in certain igneous rocks. It is a rare mineral used\r\nas a gem stone.\r\n\r\nZircon. A silicate of zirconium usually crystallized in the tetragonal\r\nsystem as simple four-sided prisms capped by four-sided pyramids. (See\r\nFigure 75l.) Very poor cleavages. Color usually brown. Hardness, 7.5\r\n(extra high); specific gravity, nearly 4.7. Brilliant luster. Zircon\r\nis very commonly present as scattering crystals of varying size in\r\nmost igneous rocks. Also common as crystals in various metamorphosed\r\nstratified rocks, and less common in some sand and gravel deposits.\r\nCertain transparent varieties, especially the brown and pink ones\r\ncalled _hyacinth_, are used as gem stones. Zircon is also the source\r\nof oxide of zirconium used in making mantles for certain incandescent\r\nlights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nECONOMIC GEOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter it is our purpose to briefly consider geology in its\r\ndirect relations to the arts and industries. When we realize that the\r\nvalue of strictly geologic products taken from the earth each year\r\nin the United States alone amounts to billions of dollars, we can\r\nbetter appreciate the practical application of geological science.\r\nSuch products include coal, petroleum, natural gas, many valuable\r\nmetal-bearing minerals, and many nonmetalliferous minerals and rocks.\r\nIn most cases these valuable products of nature have been slowly\r\naccumulated or concentrated at many times and under widely varying\r\nconditions throughout the millions of years of known geological time.\r\nTo trace the extent of, and most advantageously remove, such deposits\r\nfor the use of man is always invariably impossible unless geological\r\nknowledge is brought to bear. In many cases the problems involved\r\nare intricate, and only the trained geologist is able to at all\r\nsuccessfully cope with them. In such cases it is necessary not only\r\nto have a thorough knowledge of minerals and rocks as such, but also\r\nof their origin and structure. Much of the practical application of\r\ngeology is carried out by the mining engineer who should have, above\r\nall, a thorough knowledge of the great principles of geology.\r\n\r\nOur plan of discussion is to consider, first, coal, petroleum, and\r\nnatural gas; then the most important metalliferous deposits of ores;\r\nand finally nonmetalliferous minerals and rocks of exceptional\r\ncommercial importance. Underground waters have already been discussed\r\nfrom the practical standpoint in the chapter on \"Waters Within the\r\nEarth.\" Certain minerals have already been sufficiently considered from\r\nthe economic standpoint in the chapter on \"Mineralogy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL, PETROLEUM, AND NATURAL GAS\r\n\r\nCoal. Most valuable of all geological products is coal. Although it is\r\nnot, strictly speaking, a mineral, both because of its organic origin\r\nand lack of definite chemical composition, coal is generally classed\r\namong our mineral resources. Some idea of the national importance of\r\ncoal in the United States may be gained when we realize that the energy\r\nderived from a single year's output is equivalent to that of hundreds\r\nof millions of men working full time through the year. The uses of coal\r\nare too well known to need mention here.\r\n\r\nCoal is, beyond question, of organic (plant) origin as shown by its\r\nvery composition; perfect gradations between plant deposits like peat\r\nand true coal; and the presence of microscopic plant remains and spores\r\nin the coal. An excellent summary of just what happens during the\r\ntransition of ordinary vegetable matter into coal has been given by\r\nD. White as follows: \"All coal was laid down in beds analogous to the\r\npeat beds of to-day. All kinds of plants, especially such species as\r\nwere adapted to the particular region where the deposit was located, in\r\nwhole or in part went into the deposit.\r\n\r\n\"Plants are composed chiefly of cellulose and proteins. The former,\r\ncomprising by far the larger bulk, constitute the framework, whereas\r\nthe latter are concerned in the vital functions. With these are\r\nassociated many other substances, among which are chiefly starch,\r\nsugars, and fats and oils, constituting reserve foodstuffs; waxes,\r\nresin waxes, resins, and higher fats, performing mainly protective\r\nfunctions.... These components differ widely in their resistance to\r\nvarious agencies. Those substances involved in the life function\r\nand the support of the plant are relatively very stable under the\r\nconditions imposed upon them.\r\n\r\n\"At the death of the plants, governed by conditions imposed in the\r\nbog, a partial decomposition, maceration, elimination, and chemical\r\nreduction begins, brought about by various agencies, chiefly organic,\r\nmainly fungi at first and bacteria later. The most labile are removed\r\nfirst, the more resistant next, and so on, as the conditions require,\r\nleaving the most resistant behind in a residue called peat.\r\n\r\n\"The process of decomposition, elimination, and chemical reduction\r\nbegun in peat, chiefly by biochemical means, is taken up and continued\r\nby dynamochemical means into and through the various successive\r\nlater stages, and results in the various grades of coal, as lignite,\r\nsub-bituminous, and cannel coal, and anthracite.\"\r\n\r\nThe principal chemical elements involved in the changes which take\r\nplace are carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, as shown by the following\r\nanalyses of about average samples of each member of the so-called \"coal\r\nseries.\"\r\n\r\n=========================+========+========+==========+=========\r\n    The \"coal series\"  | Carbon | Oxygen | Hydrogen | Nitrogen\r\n-------------------------+--------+--------+----------+---------\r\nWood (cellulose)         |   50   |   43   |    6     |     1\r\nPeat                     |   59   |   33   |    6     |     2\r\nLignite                  |   69   |   25   |    5.5   |   0.8\r\nBituminous coal          |   82   |   13   |    5     |   0.8\r\nAnthracite coal          |   95   |   2.5  |    2.5   | trace\r\nGraphite                 |  100   |   ..   |    ..    |    ..\r\n-------------------------+--------+--------+----------+---------\r\n\r\nFrom this table it is seen that the oxygen relatively diminishes while\r\nthe carbon relatively increases, though, of course, all three elements\r\nactually decrease during the chemical change from cellulose to coal.\r\nThese three elements disappear mainly in the form of gases, such as\r\nwater vapor, marsh gas, and carbonic acid gas. The final or graphite\r\nstage is almost reached by the graphitic anthracite of Rhode Island,\r\nwhich is so nearly pure carbon as to be really useless as coal.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which successive layers of vegetable matter (later\r\nturned into coal) become embedded in the earth's crust have been\r\noutlined in the chapter on the \"Evolution of Plants.\" The most perfect\r\nconditions for prolific plant growth, and accumulation as great beds\r\nin the earth's crust, were during the Pennsylvanian period of the late\r\nPaleozoic era in many parts of the world, but especially in the United\r\nStates, China, Great Britain, and Germany. Most of the world's great\r\nsupply of coal comes from rocks of Pennsylvanian Age, while next in\r\nimportance are Cretaceous rocks, and some comes from strata of other\r\nages later than the Pennsylvanian, even as late as the Tertiary.\r\n\r\nThe United States not only has the greatest known coal fields, but\r\nit also produces far more coal than any other country. In 1918 the\r\nproduction was 678,000,000 tons, the greatest in our history, or\r\nenough, if loaded into cars of forty tons capacity, to fill a train\r\nwhich would reach around the earth at the equator about six times!\r\nEqually amazing is the fact that this coal was nearly all consumed by\r\nthis one nation! In 1919 the production fell to 544,000,000 tons. Is\r\nthere real danger that our supply of coal will soon run out? Hardly so\r\nwhen we consider, first, the fact that probably not more than 1 per\r\ncent of the readily available coal has thus far been removed, and,\r\nsecond, the high probability that rate of increase in coal production\r\nfor the last twenty years will not continue. In fact, during the last\r\ntwo or three years the production has fallen off considerably. But even\r\nso, coal, which is our greatest natural resource, and which can never\r\nbe replaced, should be scientifically conserved. In the case of the\r\nvery restricted anthracite coal fields what might be called a crisis\r\nhas already been reached, because a very considerable part of the\r\navailable supply has been taken out.\r\n\r\nSomething like 350,000 square miles of the United States are underlain\r\nwith one or more beds of workable coal (not including lignite)--in\r\nsome areas five to twenty or more beds one above the other. There are\r\nalso about 150,000 square miles of country underlain with the more or\r\nless imperfect coal called lignite. It has been estimated that there\r\nare more than a trillion tons of easily accessible coal, and another\r\ntrillion tons accessible with some difficulty in the principal coal\r\nfields of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe greatest production of coal by far is from the Appalachian Mountain\r\nand Allegheny Plateau districts, from the western half of Pennsylvania\r\nto Alabama, where all the coal is bituminous of Pennsylvanian Age.\r\nHere as well as elsewhere the coal beds are interstratified with\r\nvarious kinds of sedimentary rocks, most commonly with shales and\r\nsandstones. In the Appalachian field the strata including coal beds are\r\nmore or less folded toward the east, while they are nearly horizontal\r\ntoward the west. The famous Pittsburgh coal bed is probably the most\r\nextensive important single coal bed known. It covers an area of over\r\n12,000 square miles and is workable, with a thickness of five to\r\nfifteen feet, over an area of 6,000 square miles of parts of western\r\nPennsylvania, Ohio, and West Virginia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76.--Map of the United States, showing the\r\nprincipal coal fields. Cross-lined areas represent lignitic coals.\r\n(After U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nThe greatest production of anthracite coal by far is from\r\ncentral-eastern Pennsylvania, where strata of Pennsylvania Age,\r\nincluding a number of anthracite beds, are mostly highly folded. Most\r\nremarkable of all in this district is the so-called \"mammoth bed\" of\r\nanthracite, nearly everywhere present, with a thickness up to as much\r\nas fifty or sixty feet. Less than 500 square miles are there underlain\r\nby workable anthracite coal.\r\n\r\nNext to the greatest production of coal in the United States is from\r\nthe two large areas in the middle of the Mississippi Valley. It is\r\nall bituminous coal, associated with nearly horizontal strata of\r\nPennsylvanian Age.\r\n\r\nThe scattering areas through the Rocky Mountains yield all types of\r\ncoal--anthracite, bituminous, and lignite. In some of these areas the\r\ncoal beds have been but little disturbed from their original horizontal\r\nposition, but usually they are more or less folded along with the\r\ninclosing strata, the crustal disturbances affecting the coal beds\r\nhaving taken place late in the Mesozoic era and early in the Cenozoic\r\nera. Practically all of these coals are of Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\nAges, the best being Cretaceous. Very little of the Rocky Mountain coal\r\nis anthracite.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific Coast coal production is relatively very small. The\r\ncoals are there bituminous to lignitic of Tertiary Age, usually folded\r\nin with the strata.\r\n\r\nIn Alaska there are widely distributed, relatively small coal fields,\r\nbut they have been little developed. Alaskan coals range in age from\r\nPennsylvanian to Tertiary, and in kind from anthracite to lignite.\r\n\r\nPetroleum. Crude oil or petroleum is an organic substance consisting\r\nof a mixture of hydrocarbons, that is, it is made up very largely of\r\nthe two chemical elements carbon and hydrogen, in rather complex and\r\nvariable combinations. It is practically certain that petroleum has\r\nbeen derived by a sort of slow process of distillation from organic\r\nmatter--animal or vegetable or both--in stratified rocks within the\r\nearth. Many strata, as for example carbonaceous shales, are more or\r\nless charged with dark-colored decomposing organic matter. The chemical\r\ncomposition itself, the kinds of rocks with which it is associated, and\r\ncertain optical (microscopic) tests all point to the organic origin of\r\npetroleum. In southern California at least, certain of the oils have\r\nquite certainly been derived from the very tiny oily plants called\r\ndiatoms which fill many of the strata.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77.--Profile and structure section showing folding\r\nof strata, with included coal beds, across one of the anthracite coal\r\nfields of eastern Pennsylvania. Length of section, a little over 2\r\nmiles. (After U. S. Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\nDuring the last twenty years petroleum has come to be one of the most\r\nimportant and useful natural products. Among the many substances\r\nartificially derived from petroleum are kerosene, gasoline, naphtha,\r\nbenzine, vaseline, and paraffine. The United States leads in the\r\nproduction of petroleum, while southern Russia and Mexico are very\r\nimportant producers. In the United States the principal areas\r\nunderlain with petroleum-bearing strata are the northern Appalachian\r\nfield (through western Pennsylvania to central West Virginia); the\r\nOhio-Indiana field (central Indiana to northwestern Ohio); the\r\nmid-continental field (southeastern Kansas and northeastern Oklahoma);\r\nthe southeastern Texas-Louisiana field; and the southwestern California\r\nfield. The total areas underlain with oil total about 10,000 square\r\nmiles. In the Appalachian, Ohio-Indiana, and mid-continental fields the\r\nstrata carrying oil range in age from Ordovician to Pennsylvanian, and\r\nthey are mostly but little disturbed from their original horizontal\r\nposition. The Texas-Louisiana oils come mainly from Cretaceous and\r\nTertiary strata which gently downtilt under the Coastal Plain toward\r\nthe Gulf. In California the oil-bearing strata are of Tertiary Age and\r\ngenerally considerably disturbed and folded.\r\n\r\nUnder proper conditions below the earth's surface the derived oil\r\naccumulates in porous or fractured rocks. There must, of course, be a\r\nsource from which the petroleum is derived or distilled; a porous or\r\nfractured rock formation to take it up; a cap rock or impervious layer\r\nto hold it in; and a proper geologic structure to favor accumulation.\r\nThe most common porous (containing) rock is sandstone, and the most\r\ncommon cap rock is shale. Oil is rarely found without gas, and\r\nsaline water is likewise often present. If the containing strata are\r\nhorizontal, the oil and gas are usually irregularly scattered, but\r\nif tilted or folded, and the beds porous throughout, they appear\r\nto collect at the highest point possible. It was the result of\r\nobservations along this line that led I. C. White to develop what is\r\nknown as the \"anticlinal theory.\" According to this theory, in folded\r\nareas the gas collects at the summit of the fold (anticline), with the\r\noil immediately below, on either side, followed by the water. It is,\r\nof course, necessary that the oil-bearing stratum shall be capped by a\r\npractically impervious one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78.--Map showing the principal petroleum and\r\nnatural gas fields of the United States. (After U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79.--A vertical (structure) section showing a very\r\ncommon type of oil-bearing structure. In this anticline, water, oil,\r\nand gas arranged in order of their specific gravities. Removal of the\r\ngas would allow the oil and water to rise higher toward the apex of the\r\nporous layer. (After Indiana Geological Survey.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 19.--General View in the Appalachian Mountains\r\nAlong New River, Virginia. This is a typical portion of the great area\r\nwhich, during Mesozoic time, was reduced by erosion to the condition\r\nof a low-lying plain (\"peneplain\"). Since early Cenozoic time the\r\npeneplain has been upraised and New River has carved out its V-shaped\r\nvalley to its present depth, while tributary streams have carved out a\r\nseries of valleys along belts of weak rocks nearly at right angles to\r\nthe main valley. The remarkably even sky line marks approximately the\r\nold peneplain surface. (_Photo by Hillers, U. S. Geological Survey._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate 20.--(_a_) A Big Glacial Bowlder of Plutonic\r\nIgneous Rock Carried Miles from Its Parent Ledge by the Ice Sheet Which\r\nPassed Over the Adirondack Mountains During the Ice Age.

(_Photo by the author._)]\r\n\r\n\"If the rocks are dry, then the chief points of accumulation of the oil\r\nwill be at or near the bottom of the syncline (downfold), or lowest\r\nportion of the porous bed. If the rocks are partially saturated with\r\nwater, then the oil accumulates at the upper level of saturation. In a\r\ntilted bed, which is locally porous, and not so throughout, the oil,\r\ngas, and water may arrange themselves according to their gravity in\r\nthis porous part.\" (Ries.)\r\n\r\nAlthough the term \"oil pool\" is commonly used, there is really no\r\nactual pool or underground lake of oil, but rather porous rock\r\nsaturated with oil. It has been estimated that in an oil field of\r\naverage productiveness a cubic foot of the porous rock contains from\r\nsix to twelve pints of oil. The life of a well drilled into an \"oil\r\npool\" varies from a few months to twenty or thirty years, or sometimes\r\neven more, but a heavy producer (especially a \"gusher\") almost\r\ninvariably falls off very notably in production in a few months, or at\r\nmost a few years. The typical Pennsylvanian oil well is said to last\r\nabout seven years. The fact that the United States is still able to\r\nincrease oil output is because new fields are found and developed, the\r\nmost recent being in the interior and northern parts of Texas. It is\r\npractically certain, however, that the climax of oil production in the\r\nUnited States will be reached before many years--long before that of\r\nbituminous coal.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that oil, as well as natural gas, is usually\r\nunder more or less pressure within the earth. The pressure is so\r\ngreat in some cases that where, in the course of drilling, oil or\r\ngas accumulated under proper conditions, as for example those shown\r\nby Figure 79, are encountered the pressure may be hundreds of pounds\r\nper square inch, or enough to blow to pieces much of the drilling\r\noutfit. It is under such conditions that great \"gushers\" are struck.\r\nA wonderful case in point was the famous Lakeview gusher, struck\r\nin California in 1910. \"Within a few days the well was far beyond\r\ncontrol. It continued to flow (for a time shooting high into the air)\r\nfor eighteen months, finally stopping after it had produced over\r\n8,000,000 barrels of oil, about 6,000,000 of which had been saved.\r\nThe daily production of the well varied greatly, reaching a maximum\r\nof 65,000 barrels.\" (Pack.) One very common cause of oil pressure is\r\nthe expansive force of the associated imprisoned gas which steadily\r\nincreases as the gas is generated. Another cause which is seemingly\r\napplicable in many cases is hydrostatic pressure, where under certain\r\nstructural conditions the pressure of water in a long-tilted layer is\r\nexerted against oil accumulated toward the top of an anticline (or\r\nupbend) in the strata.\r\n\r\nThe world's output of petroleum for 1917 was nearly 559,000,000\r\nbarrels, of which the United States produced nearly 338,000,000\r\nbarrels, Mexico 87,000,000 barrels, and Russia 34,000,000 barrels of 42\r\ngallons.\r\n\r\nNatural Gas. The most perfect fuel with which nature has provided\r\nus is natural gas. Not only is it easily transported even long\r\ndistances through pipes, but also as a fuel it is easily regulated,\r\nleaves no refuse, and is less damaging to boilers than coal. It is\r\na colorless, odorless, free-burning gas, consisting very largely\r\nof the simple hydrocarbon called marsh gas or fire damp. Petroleum\r\nnearly always has more or less natural gas associated with it, but in\r\nsome cases considerable quantities of gas may exist alone. Natural\r\ngas, like petroleum, is of organic origin--a product of slow natural\r\ndistillation of vegetable or animal matter, or both, within the\r\nearth's crust.\r\n\r\nOne of the most common modes of occurrence of gas is at the top of an\r\nanticline (upfold) in porous rock (like sandstone) between impervious\r\nlayers (like shale). Figure 79 well illustrates the principle, the\r\ngas lying above the oil, and the oil above the water; that is, the\r\nthree substances are arranged according to specific gravity. Gas may\r\nalso exist in considerable quantities in irregular bodies of porous or\r\nfractured rocks. Natural gas is nearly always under pressure within\r\nthe earth, hundreds of pounds per square inch being common, while more\r\nexceptionally, as in certain West Virginia wells, pressures of over\r\n1,000 pounds have been registered.\r\n\r\nThe United States is by far the greatest world producer of natural\r\ngas, the output for 1918 having been 720,000,000,000 cubic feet. West\r\nVirginia easily headed the list, with Oklahoma and Pennsylvania next in\r\norder. Areas underlain with natural gas are, in the main, the same as\r\nfor petroleum, and they total more than 10,000 square miles. During the\r\nlast forty years the waste of natural gas in the United States has been\r\nappalling. In many cases wells in quest of oil have encountered gas and\r\noften such abandoned wells have been allowed to play millions of cubic\r\nfeet of gas daily into the air for years. A striking example was the\r\nMurraysville well of western Pennsylvania, which shot 20,000,000 cubic\r\nfeet of gas per day into the air for six years!\r\n\r\n\r\nMETAL-BEARING (ORE) DEPOSITS\r\n\r\nIron. Without question the most useful of all metals is iron. As\r\nsuch it is rare in nature, but in chemical combination with other\r\nsubstances it is extremely widespread and very common. Iron makes up\r\nabout 5 per cent of the weight of the earth's crust, but in the form\r\nof ore (i.e., a metal-bearing mineral or rock of sufficient value to\r\nbe mined) it is notably restricted in occurrence. The three great ores\r\nof iron are the minerals hematite, magnetite, and limonite, whose\r\ncomposition and characteristic properties the reader will find stated\r\nin the preceding chapter on \"Mineralogy.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the worst impurities in iron ore is phosphorus, which makes\r\niron \"cold short,\" i.e., brittle when cold. Ore for the manufacture of\r\nBessemer steel must contain very little phosphorus (less than 1/1000 of\r\nthe metallic iron content of the ore). Sulphur as an impurity in the\r\nore tends to make the iron \"hot short.\" Silica (quartz) is bad because\r\nit necessitates the use of more lime for flux in the furnace.\r\n\r\nIron ores occur in rocks of most of the great geologic ages, but in\r\nthe United States principally in the pre-Paleozoic and Paleozoic. The\r\nUnited States is by far the greatest producer of iron ore in the world,\r\nthe output for 1917 having been about 75,288,000 tons, the greatest in\r\nthe history of this or any other country. This one year's output loaded\r\ninto cars of 40 tons capacity would have made a train about 15,000\r\nmiles long! All but about 5,000,000 tons of this tremendous production\r\nwas hematite ore. In 1919 the output of iron ore dropped to about\r\n60,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80.--Drawing showing details of part of an\r\nore-bearing vein at Pinos Altos, New Mexico. The chalcopyrite and\r\nsphalerite are the ores. Somewhat reduced in size. (After Paige, U. S.\r\nGeological Survey.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe shall now very briefly consider several of the greatest iron-mining\r\ndistricts of the United States, giving some idea of the modes of\r\noccurrence and origin of the ores. Greatest of all is the Lake Superior\r\nregion, not far west and south of the lake in Minnesota, Michigan,\r\nand Wisconsin. Considerably more than one-half the iron ore mined\r\nin the United States comes from the single State of Minnesota, and\r\nabout one-fourth of it from Michigan. Most of the Minnesota ore by\r\nfar is obtained from the so-called \"Mesaba Range,\" which in 1917\r\nproduced 41,000,000 tons of hematite ore. The ore deposits are there\r\nof irregular shape, lying at or near the surface (usually covered only\r\nby glacial deposits). None of them extend downward more than a few\r\nhundred feet. The soft, high-grade ore is removed by steam shovels in\r\ngreat open pits. In the several districts of northern Michigan and\r\nWisconsin the ores (nearly all hematite) are associated with more or\r\nless highly folded rocks at considerable depths. The Lake Superior iron\r\nores all occur in rocks of Archeozoic and Proterozoic Ages. According\r\nto the best explanation of their origin the iron of the ores was once\r\npart of a sedimentary series of rocks in the form of iron carbonate and\r\nsilicate, interstratified with layers of a flintlike rock associated\r\nwith slate, quartzite, etc. After these rocks were raised into land and\r\nsubjected to weathering the old iron compounds were altered to oxides,\r\nmainly hematite, and somewhat concentrated. Further concentration of\r\nthe ore was caused by dissolving out the flintlike layers of the old\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham, Ala., region is the second most important iron ore\r\nproducer in the United States, with an output of nearly 6,000,000 tons\r\nin 1918. The ore is hematite, forming part of the famous Clinton iron\r\nore deposits of Silurian Age. This deposit, named from Clinton, N.\r\nY., extends through central New York and in more or less interrupted\r\nparallel bands through the Appalachian Mountains to near Birmingham\r\nwhere the richest deposits occur. This ore appears to be an original\r\nbed (or locally several beds) of fairly rich iron ore deposited on the\r\nshallow Silurian sea bottom and then covered by other strata. At the\r\ntime of the Appalachian Mountain revolution the iron ore was more or\r\nless highly folded in with other strata throughout the Appalachians. A\r\nremarkable fact regarding the Birmingham district is that in the near\r\nvicinity of the ore there are both coal for fuel and limestone flux for\r\nsmelting the ores.\r\n\r\nThe next most important mining region of the United States is the\r\nAdirondack Mountain region of northern New York, where about 1,000,000\r\ntons of ore are obtained yearly. Magnetite is the ore, and it occurs\r\nin more or less irregular lenses and bands in granite and closely\r\nassociated rocks of pre-Paleozoic Age. One view regarding the origin\r\nof this ore is that it segregated during the process of cooling of the\r\nmolten granite, and another view (recently advocated by the author) is\r\nthat it was derived from an older iron-rich igneous formation by either\r\nthe molten granite or very hot solutions from it and concentrated into\r\nthe ores. About 2,500,000 tons of magnetite were mined in the United\r\nStates in 1916, nearly one-half of it in the Adirondacks.\r\n\r\nThe third important iron ore is limonite, nearly 2,000,000 tons of\r\nwhich were produced in the United States in 1916. Most of it came from\r\nthe Appalachian Mountains. All of this limonite is of secondary origin;\r\nthat is, it has been derived from certain early Paleozoic iron-bearing\r\nlimestones either by weathering or solution, and concentrated into ore\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nCopper. This is one of the most useful of all metals. Several of its\r\nvery important uses are as a conductor of electricity in the form\r\nof wire; in making alloys such as brass and bronze; in copperplate\r\nengraving; and in roofing and plumbing. Various minerals containing\r\ncopper are found in many parts of the world, but only about six of them\r\nare really important as ores. These are native copper, chalcopyrite,\r\nchalcocite, azurite, malachite, and cuprite, most of which are\r\ndescribed in the chapter on \"Mineralogy.\" The number of places where\r\nthey may be profitably mined as ore is distinctly limited. Fifteen or\r\ntwenty countries produce more or less copper, but the United States is\r\nby far the greatest producer, with an output of nearly 2,000,000,000\r\npounds of copper in 1916, the output having fallen off some in 1918.\r\nThis was two-thirds of the world's output and ten times as much as\r\nthe nearest competitor. The other leading countries are Japan, Chile,\r\nMexico, Spain, and Canada. In 1918 the four leading States in order\r\nwere Arizona, Montana, Michigan, and Utah, with production ranging from\r\nnearly 765,000,000 pounds to about 230,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nIn Arizona several great copper-mining districts lie in the\r\nsoutheastern one-fourth of the State. Almost invariably the ores are\r\ndirectly associated with limestone and an igneous rock (granite), both\r\nof late Paleozoic Age. The ores are almost always near the border\r\nbetween the two rocks, mostly as great irregular deposits within the\r\nlimestone, and less commonly as veins within the granite. The original\r\nores were carried in solution and deposited by hot liquids (or vapors)\r\nfrom the cooling granite. At lower levels the ores are mainly sulphides\r\nof copper (e.g., chalcopyrite and chalcocite), while at higher levels\r\nthey are mostly carbonates (malachite and azurite) and oxides (e.g.\r\ncuprite). The difference is due to the fact that the ores nearer\r\nthe surface have been subjected to weathering and altered from their\r\noriginal condition.\r\n\r\nThe region around Butte, Mont., is next to the greatest copper\r\nproducer. Nearly all the ores are sulphides of copper (mainly\r\nchalcocite) which occur with quartz in a great system of nearly\r\nparallel veins in granite of Tertiary Age. \"It is supposed that in the\r\ncopper veins the hot ore-bearing solutions ascended the fractures in\r\nthe granite, replacing the rock by ore, and resulting in an intense\r\nalteration of the walls.\" (Ries.)\r\n\r\nThird in rank among the copper-producing States is Michigan, the mines\r\nbeing located on Keweenaw Peninsula, which extends into Lake Superior.\r\nFor fully fifty years this district has been one of the most famous and\r\nimportant copper producers in the world. A unique feature is that the\r\nore is native copper, associated with some native silver. The rocks\r\ncontaining the ore are steeply tilted lava sheets and conglomerate\r\n(cemented gravel) strata of Proterozoic Age. Openings in porous\r\nlava and spaces between the conglomerate pebbles have been filled\r\nby metallic copper, which was carried off in hot solutions from the\r\ncooling lavas. Certain of the mining shafts have been sunk more than\r\n5,000 feet below the surface, these being next to the deepest in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nUtah ranks fourth among the copper producers, the greatest mining\r\ndistrict being at Bingham Canyon, southwest of Salt Lake City. The\r\nrocks are late Paleozoic strata, pierced by a large body of igneous\r\nrock. Some of the sulphide ores (mainly chalcopyrite) occur in veins\r\nin the igneous rock and some in large tabular masses in the adjacent\r\nlimestone. Hot solutions from lower portions of the uncooled igneous\r\nrock carried the ore in solution into the limestone and into cracks in\r\nthe upper cooled igneous rock.\r\n\r\nLead. Lead must surely be counted among the five or six most useful\r\nmetals. As in the case of nearly all the other most important natural\r\nresources, the United States is the world's greatest producer of\r\nlead, the output of metallic lead having been 552,000 tons in 1916\r\nand somewhat less in 1918. Most of this came from Missouri, Idaho,\r\nUtah, and Colorado. The leading other countries are in order--Spain,\r\nGermany, Mexico, and Australia. Nearly all the lead comes from the\r\nmineral galena (a sulphide of lead), which is described in the chapter\r\non \"Mineralogy.\" Among the many uses of lead are the following:\r\nmanufacture of certain high-grade paints from lead compounds; making\r\nalloys such as pewter, type metal, solder, babbit metal; in plumbing;\r\nin glass making; and in the manufacture of shot.\r\n\r\nThe greatest lead-mining district is in the vicinity of Joplin, Mo.,\r\nwhere the ore (galena), associated with much zinc ore, occurs as veins\r\nand great irregular deposits in limestone of early Paleozoic Age. It\r\nis generally agreed that underground waters dissolved the ores out of\r\nthe limestone in which they were disseminated as tiny particles and\r\ndeposited them in concentrated form at lower levels.\r\n\r\nIn the famous Coeur d'Alene district of northern Idaho the great output\r\nof lead is really obtained from a lead-silver ore; that is, galena\r\nrich in silver. This ore is in composition a lead-silver sulphide. It\r\noccurs in great fissure veins, mostly following fault fractures in\r\nhighly folded strata of Proterozoic Age. Igneous rocks cut through the\r\nstrata, and it is believed that hot ore-bearing solutions given off\r\nfrom the highly heated igneous rocks rose in the fissures and deposited\r\nthe ores.\r\n\r\nThe Park City and Tintic districts of Utah are great producers of lead.\r\nThe lead ore (galena) is usually rich in silver. It occurs mainly in\r\nveins and irregular deposits in limestone of Paleozoic Age closely\r\nassociated with certain igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous mining districts in the world is that around\r\nLeadville, Col., where ores of four metals--gold, silver, lead, and\r\nzinc--have been extensively mined. The salient points in the rather\r\ncomplex geology are the following: Paleozoic strata, including much\r\nlimestone, rest upon a foundation of pre-Paleozoic granite. Sheets\r\nof igneous rock are interbedded with the strata and many dikes of\r\nigneous rocks cut through the whole combination. After the last igneous\r\nactivity all the rocks were somewhat folded and notably faulted in\r\nmany places. The ores were dissolved out of the igneous rock and\r\ndeposited in large masses mostly in the limestone and in fissure veins,\r\nespecially along and near the fault zones.\r\n\r\nZinc. Another of the few most useful metals is zinc. It never occurs\r\nin metallic form in nature, but most of it by far is obtained from the\r\nore mineral sphalerite (sulphide of zinc) described in the chapter on\r\n\"Mineralogy.\" A red oxide of zinc ore, called zincite, assumes great\r\neconomic importance in New Jersey. In 1917 the United States produced\r\n686,000 tons of metallic zinc and was easily the world's leader. Since\r\n1917 the production has fallen notably. The four greatest producing\r\nStates are Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, and Colorado. Germany and\r\nBelgium are the greatest foreign producers.\r\n\r\nMost important of all in the United States is the district around\r\nJoplin, Mo., where the ore is closely associated with lead ore. The\r\nmode of occurrence and origin of these ores are above referred to in\r\nthe discussion of lead.\r\n\r\nIn Montana some of the great east-west fissure veins in granite are\r\nrich in silver ores in the upper levels, and in zinc ores (mainly\r\nsphalerite) at depths of from some hundreds of feet to nearly 2,000\r\nfeet, that is as far down as they have been mined. They, like the\r\ngreat copper veins of the same general district, were carried by\r\nhot solutions which rose from the lower still very hot granite and\r\ndeposited the ores in fissures of the same cooler rock higher up.\r\n\r\nTwo great ore bodies in the general vicinity of Franklin, N. J., are of\r\nunique interest, because they are mostly the red oxide of zinc called\r\nzincite. The ore deposits occur in white limestone along or close to\r\nits contact with metamorphosed (altered) strata and granite of early\r\nPaleozoic Age. It is not definitely known how the ore originated, but\r\nit was probably derived in solution from the hot granite and deposited\r\nin the limestone by replacement of the latter.\r\n\r\nIn Colorado the principal zinc mines are around Leadville, where lead\r\nore is nearly always directly associated with the zinc ore. This\r\ndistrict is above described in the discussion of lead.\r\n\r\nAmong many uses of zinc are for galvanizing; for making certain\r\nhigh-grade paints; brass and white metal; and for roofing and plumbing.\r\n\r\nGold. This precious metal has been used and highly prized by man for\r\nthousands of years. The discovery of gold in California in 1848 was\r\none of the most important events in the history of the mining world.\r\nAs early as 1852 that State reached its climax of production with an\r\noutput of at least $81,000,000 worth of the metal. The Transvaal region\r\nof South Africa has for two decades been the world's greatest gold\r\nproducer. Though long known, the metal has there been worked only since\r\n1886. In 1915 the peak of gold production in the world ($468,700,000)\r\nwas reached and nearly maintained in 1916, but since that time there\r\nhas been a great falling off. In 1916 South Africa produced gold to\r\nthe value of about $200,000,000; the United States over $90,000,000;\r\nAustralia over $40,000,000; Russia over $26,000,000; and Canada over\r\n$19,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn tiny amounts gold is really very widespread. It occurs in many\r\nstream gravels where so-called \"color\" may be obtained by washing\r\ngravel, and it is even dissolved in sea water. Gold-mining localities\r\nare also numerous in many parts of the world, but relatively few of\r\nthem only have ever paid. The total amount of money spent in actual\r\ngold-mining operations; in hopeless but honest operations; and for\r\nstock in fake gold mines has no doubt exceeded the actual value of gold\r\nproduced. In many a case acceptance of a report based upon a very brief\r\nexamination of the ground by a competent geologist would have saved\r\nthe cost of hopeless expenditure of money. Some one in nearly every\r\ncommunity has a so-called \"gold mine.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the commercially valuable gold occurs in nature as native\r\ngold, either mixed with gravel and sand (i.e., placer deposits) along\r\nexisting or ancient stream beds, or in veins mechanically held in the\r\nmineral pyrite (described in the preceding chapter) in submicroscopic\r\nform, or visibly mixed with quartz in vein deposits. Another kind of\r\nore which assumes considerable importance, as in parts of Colorado, is\r\nin the form of telluride of gold always found in veins. In deep vein\r\ndeposits it is quite the rule to find free or native gold mechanically\r\nand visibly mixed with quartz in the upper levels, while deeper down\r\nthe gold is mechanically, but invisibly, held in combination usually\r\nin pyrite, which latter is associated with quartz. This difference is\r\ndue to the fact that the lower level ores are now just as they were\r\nformed, while in the upper levels the ores have been weathered, and the\r\ngold set free and often more or less further concentrated by solutions.\r\nVein deposits, including also telluride ores, are found in many kinds\r\nof rocks--igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic--of nearly all ages\r\ngenerally directly associated with igneous rocks. In nearly all cases\r\nthe best evidence indicates that the vein fillings were formed by hot\r\nore-bearing solutions from the igneous rock, which solutions deposited\r\nthe ore plus quartz in fissures in either the igneous or adjacent\r\nrocks. Among the many localities where fissure veins of the kind just\r\ndescribed are of great economic importance are the \"Mother Lode\" belt\r\nof the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California; Cripple Creek (telluride\r\nore), Georgetown and the San Juan region of Colorado; Goldfield,\r\nTonopah, and Comstock Lode of Nevada; and near Juneau, Alaska.\r\n\r\nPlacer deposits, that is, free gold mixed with gravel and sand, also\r\nyield much gold. They are most prominently developed in California\r\nand Alaska. These gold-bearing \"gravels represent the more resistant\r\nproducts of weathering, such as quartz and native gold, which have\r\nbeen washed down from the hills on whose slopes the gold-bearing\r\nquartz veins outcrop, and were too heavy to be carried any distance,\r\nunless the grade was steep. They have consequently settled down in the\r\nstream channels, the gold, on account of its higher specific gravity,\r\ncollecting usually in the lower part of the gravel (placer) deposit.\"\r\n(Ries.) Such gold occurs as grains, flakes, or nuggets. When a chunk of\r\ngold-bearing vein quartz, with crevices filled by thin plates of the\r\nmetal, is carried downstream pieces are gradually broken away, and the\r\ntough, very malleable gold bends or welds together into a single mass\r\ncalled a \"nugget.\" Nuggets varying in weight up to over 2,000 ounces\r\nhave been found. Many placer deposits are along existing drainage\r\nchannels, while others occur in abandoned and even buried former\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nMost of the gold of South Africa comes from Witwatersrand district\r\nwhere the native metal occurs in a unique manner in beds or layers\r\nof conglomerate associated with other strata, all the rocks being\r\nconsiderably folded and somewhat faulted. Some of the mines are more\r\nthan a mile deep (vertically), the deepest in the world. The gold\r\neither accumulated in placer form with gravel which later consolidated\r\ninto conglomerate, or it was introduced into spaces between the pebbles\r\nsubsequently by ore-bearing solutions.\r\n\r\nSilver. For many years the United States and Mexico have been the\r\nworld's greatest silver producers, sometimes one and sometimes the\r\nother leading, with Canada third, and Australasia fourth. In 1918 the\r\nUnited States produced nearly 68,000,000 ounces of silver and Mexico\r\nover 62,000,000 ounces. In the United States in 1918 the four leading\r\nStates were Montana, Utah, Idaho and Nevada with outputs ranging from\r\nover 10,000,000 to over 15,000,000 ounces each.\r\n\r\nIn Montana most of the silver is in the native form, more especially\r\nin the upper portions of the great veins rich in copper and zinc ores\r\nnear Butte. These ores and their origin are described above under the\r\ncaptions \"Copper\" and \"Zinc.\"\r\n\r\nThe two greatest silver districts of Nevada are Tonopah and Comstock\r\nLode where silver and gold minerals are associated as ores in Tertiary\r\nigneous rocks, the ores having been deposited in veins by hot\r\nore-bearing solutions from the igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nIn Idaho the Coeur d'Alene district produces most of the silver, the\r\nore there being a silver-bearing lead ore (galena). The nature and\r\norigin of these deposits are described above under the caption \"Lead.\"\r\n\r\nIn Utah the silver is also obtained from silver-bearing galena\r\nespecially in the Tintic, Cottonwood Canyon, and Bingham Canyon\r\ndistricts where the ores occur mainly as irregular deposits and\r\nin fissure veins in Paleozoic strata (chiefly limestone) directly\r\nassociated with igneous rocks, hot ore-bearing solutions from the\r\nigneous rocks having furnished the ores.\r\n\r\nTin. Production of tin in the United States has never amounted to much,\r\na little mining having been carried on from time to time in South\r\nCarolina, Black Hills of South Dakota, and southern California. About\r\none-half of the world's supply of tin (121,000 long tons 1918) comes\r\nfrom the Malay Peninsula and two small islands near by. The only other\r\ngreat producer is Bolivia, though a number of other countries produce\r\nfrom 1,000 to 9,000 tons each.\r\n\r\nThe only important ore of tin is the mineral cassiterite (oxide of tin)\r\ndescribed above in the chapter on \"Mineralogy.\" In the Malay region\r\nthe ore all occurs in placer deposits and is, therefore, of secondary\r\norigin, the source of the ore not being known. In Bolivia the tin ore\r\noccurs in veins in and close to granite, the ore having been carried\r\nby very hot vapors or liquids which were derived from the still highly\r\nheated granite.\r\n\r\nTin is used chiefly in the making of tin plate, bronze, pewter, gun\r\nmetal, and bell metal.\r\n\r\nAluminum. The mineral called bauxite (a hydrous oxide of aluminum)\r\nis the great ore from which aluminum is obtained by an electrical\r\nprocess. Bauxite is noncrystalline, relatively light in weight, white\r\nto yellowish in color, and in the form of rounded grains, or earthy or\r\nclaylike masses. The United States and France are the only two great\r\nproducers of bauxite, most of which is treated for metallic aluminum.\r\nIn 1918 the United States produced more than 100,000 tons of aluminum.\r\nIn the United States the principal deposits are in Georgia, Alabama,\r\nand Arkansas. Bauxite is probably always a secondary mineral formed\r\nby decomposition of igneous rocks rich in certain aluminum silicate\r\nminerals. In some cases, as in the Georgia-Alabama region, the bauxite\r\nappears to have been formed and concentrated in deposits by hot\r\nsolutions from uncooled igneous rocks.\r\n\r\nAluminum is most used in the manufacture of wire for electric current\r\ntransmission. It is also mixed with certain other metals like copper,\r\nzinc, magnesium, and tungsten to form special types of alloys, some of\r\nwhich possess remarkable tensile strength up to nearly 50,000 pounds\r\nper square inch. Aluminum is used in powdered form to generate very\r\nhigh temperatures in certain welding processes. It is also made into\r\nmany kinds of utensils and instruments.\r\n\r\nMercury. This metal, commonly known as \"quicksilver,\" is of special\r\ninterest because it is the only one which exists in liquid form at\r\nordinary temperatures. The metal occurs in only small quantities in\r\nnature, most of it by far being obtained from the red mineral cinnabar\r\ndescribed in the chapter on \"Mineralogy.\" In order of importance the\r\ngreatest quicksilver producing countries in 1916 were Italy, United\r\nStates, Austria, and Spain. In the United States, California is by far\r\nthe leading State, while Texas and Nevada are the only other important\r\nproducers.\r\n\r\nIn California most of the ore occurs in veins and irregular deposits\r\nin metamorphosed strata of Mesozoic and Cenozoic ages usually closely\r\nassociated with igneous rocks. There, as well as in other parts of the\r\nworld, hot vapors from igneous rocks carried the volatile ore upward\r\nand deposited it in fissures.\r\n\r\nAmong the many uses of mercury are in making fulminate for explosives;\r\nmaking certain drugs and chemicals, pigments, electrical and physical\r\napparatus; silvering mirrors; and in the amalgamation process of\r\nextracting gold and silver.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER ECONOMIC PRODUCTS\r\n\r\nBuilding Stones. Some of the principal features which should be\r\nconsidered in building stones are power to resist weathering, power to\r\nwithstand heat, color, hardness, and density, and crushing strength.\r\nBuilding stones representing rocks of nearly all important geologic\r\nages are widely distributed throughout the world.\r\n\r\n_Granite_, including certain other closely related rocks, is one of\r\nthe oldest and most useful building stones. The New England States\r\nare the greatest producers, while the Piedmont Plateau district (east\r\nof the Appalachians) from Philadelphia to Alabama also contains\r\nimportant granite quarries. In the Adirondack Mountains, in Wisconsin\r\nand Minnesota, through the Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada\r\nMountains there are extensive areas of granite which are relatively\r\nlittle quarried. The granite occurs only in regions of highly disturbed\r\nrocks, usually in mountains or hills, where great volumes of the molten\r\nrock were forced into the earth's crust, cooled, and later laid bare by\r\nerosion.\r\n\r\n_Marble_, according to geological definition, is a metamorphosed\r\nlimestone, that is a limestone which has been crystallized under\r\nconditions of heat, pressure, and moisture within the earth. More\r\nloosely in trade any limestone which takes a polish may be called\r\nmarble. The greatest marble-producing districts of the United States\r\nare western New England (especially Vermont) and the Piedmont Plateau\r\nand Appalachian Mountains in rocks of Paleozoic age. In northern New\r\nYork and the mountains of the west there are relatively few marble\r\nquarries.\r\n\r\nOrdinary _limestones_ are widely distributed in many States where they\r\nrange in age from early Paleozoic to Tertiary. Most of the quarries\r\nsupply stone for near-by markets. The so-called Bedford limestone\r\nof Indiana has, for many years, been perhaps the most widely used\r\nlimestone for building purposes in the United States.\r\n\r\n_Sandstones_, which are stratified rocks consisting mainly of\r\nrounded quartz grains cemented together, are widely used in building\r\noperations. Like limestones, they are very widespread in formations\r\nof all ages except the very old. There are many sandstone quarries\r\nsupplying more or less local markets throughout the country. Two of\r\nthe best known and most widely used sandstones are the so-called\r\nbrown-stone of Triassic Age extending interruptedly from the\r\nConnecticut Valley of Massachusetts to North Carolina, and the Berea,\r\nOhio, sandstone of light gray color and uniform texture.\r\n\r\n_Slate_ is mostly a metamorphosed shale, that is a shale which has been\r\nsubjected to great pressure within the earth so that the stratification\r\nhas been obliterated and a well defined cleavage has been developed\r\nat right angles to the direction of application of the pressure.\r\nGood slate is fine-grained, dense, and splits readily into wide thin\r\nplates. It occurs only where mountain making pressure and metamorphism\r\nhave been brought to bear upon the strata. Most of our great slate\r\nquarries are located in early Paleozoic rocks from New England through\r\nthe Piedmont Plateau. Some quarries are also located in Arkansas,\r\nMinnesota, and westward to California.\r\n\r\nClay. \"Clay, which is one of the most widely distributed materials\r\nand one of the most valuable, commercially, may be defined as a\r\nfine-grained mixture of the mineral kaolinite with fragments of other\r\nminerals, such as silicates, oxides, and hydrates, and also often\r\norganic compounds, the mass possessing plasticity when wet and\r\nbecoming rock-hard when burned to at least a temperature of redness.\"\r\n(Ries.)\r\n\r\nMost clays originate by the weathering of rocks, particularly igneous\r\nand metamorphic rocks rich in the mineral feldspar. As a result of the\r\ndecomposition of the feldspar, much clay is formed, the main substance\r\nof which is kaolin. Both feldspar and kaolin are described in the\r\npreceding chapter. When the resulting clay rests upon the rock from\r\nwhich it has been derived it is called residual clay. Much of the clay\r\nis, however, carried away, mainly by streams, and deposited in lakes or\r\nthe sea, or on river flood plains. Some clay deposits are of wind-blown\r\norigin, and still others are formed by the grinding action of glaciers.\r\nClays are very widespread, and they are directly associated with rocks\r\nof all geologic ages.\r\n\r\nAmong the many important uses of clay are the following: manufacture of\r\ncommon brick, fire brick, pottery, chinaware, porcelain ware, tiles,\r\nterra cotta, and Portland cement.\r\n\r\nLime and Cement. Limestone, which is one of the most common and\r\nwidespread of all stratified rocks, forms the basis for the manufacture\r\nof the important substances lime (or \"quicklime\") and Portland cement.\r\nLime results when pure limestone (carbonate of lime) is \"burned\" or\r\nheated to a temperature high enough to drive off the carbonic acid\r\ngas. The greatest use of lime is for mixing with water and sand to\r\nmake mortar. A few of its other numerous uses are in plastering;\r\nwhitewashing; purifying certain steel; in making gas, paper, and soap;\r\nand as a fertilizer.\r\n\r\nCertain limestones containing clay of the right kind and proportion\r\nare called natural cement rocks because, after being \"burned,\" they\r\ndevelop the property of \"setting,\" like cement when mixed with water.\r\nThe \"setting\" of a cement is due to the fact that certain chemical\r\ncompounds formed during the heating crystallize when mixed with water,\r\nand the hard, tiny interlocking crystals of the newly formed silicate\r\nminerals give rigidity to the mass. Of recent years Portland cement\r\nhas largely superseded the natural rock cements. \"Portland cement is\r\nthe product obtained by burning a finely ground artificial mixture\r\nconsisting essentially of lime, silica, alumina, and some iron oxide,\r\nthese substances being present in certain definite proportions.\"\r\n(Ries.) The necessary ingredients are generally obtained by grinding\r\nand burning carefully selected mixtures of limestone in some form,\r\nand clay or shale. The great and growing uses of cement need not be\r\ndetailed here.\r\n\r\nSalt. Most of the common salt (the mineral \"halite\") of commercial\r\nvalue occurs in nature in sea or salt lake water; or in beds or strata\r\nof rock salt associated with other strata; or as natural brine in\r\nopenings or pores in certain rocks. Considerable salt is obtained by\r\nevaporation of tidewater, as around San Francisco Bay, and of salt lake\r\nwater, as at Great Salt Lake, Utah. It has been estimated that the\r\nGreat Salt Lake, whose area is about 2,000 square miles and greatest\r\ndepth 50 feet, contains several hundred million tons of common salt.\r\nThis salt has been washed out of the rocks of the surrounding country\r\nand gradually accumulated in the lake because it has no outlet.\r\n\r\nMost important of all sources of salt is the rock salt which occurs\r\nin the form of strata within the earth's crust. Such strata are found\r\nin rocks of nearly all ages from the early Paleozoic to the present.\r\nThey resulted from the evaporation of salt lakes or salty more or\r\nless cut-off arms of the sea, after which other strata accumulated on\r\ntop of them. Thus in the Silurian system of strata underlying all of\r\nsouthwestern New York State there occur almost universally from one to\r\nseven beds of salt. The strata including the salt dip gently southward\r\nso that at Ithaca, New York, seven salt beds were struck in a well\r\nat a depth of about 2,200 feet. Northward the salt comes nearer and\r\nnearer the surface. One well penetrated a layer of solid salt 325 feet\r\nthick. Some of this salt is being mined much like coal, but most of it\r\nis obtained by running water into deep wells to dissolve the salt, the\r\nresulting brine being pumped out and evaporated.\r\n\r\nUnder portions of southern Michigan there are both salt beds and\r\nnatural brines charging certain porous rock layers. Both the salt beds\r\n(of Silurian Age) and the brines (of Mississippian Age) supply great\r\nquantities of salt from brines pumped out and evaporated.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 the United States produced 51,000,000 barrels (280 lbs. each)\r\nof salt. Michigan (17,000,000 barrels) and New York were the leading\r\nStates, followed by Kansas, Ohio, West Virginia, and California. Some\r\nof the uses of common salt are given in the description of halite in\r\nthe preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nGypsum. The composition and properties of this common and useful\r\nmineral are given in the chapter on \"Mineralogy.\" Rock gypsum is\r\nthe variety of great commercial importance. It is widespread, being\r\nquarried in many States, and occurs interstratified with rocks of many\r\nages where it has originated by evaporation or partial evaporation of\r\nsalt water lakes or more or less cut-off arms of the sea. Salt beds\r\nare often associated with gypsum.\r\n\r\nFor about ten years the average yearly production of gypsum in the\r\nUnited States has been approximately 2,500,000 tons, or about ten\r\ntimes that of the nearest foreign competitor (Canada). New York, Iowa,\r\nMichigan, and Ohio are the chief producers. In New York the rock gypsum\r\n(usually four to ten feet thick) lies between shale and limestone\r\nstrata of Silurian age, and it is quarried from the central to the\r\nwestern part of the State. In Michigan the rock gypsum beds, commonly\r\nfive to twenty feet thick, lie in Mississippian strata in the southern\r\nportion of the State. A great bed of exceptionally pure rock gypsum\r\nunderlies about twenty-five square miles of Webster County, Iowa, in\r\nrocks of late Paleozoic Age. The Kansas gypsum deposits extend across\r\nthe central part of the State in rocks of Permian Age.\r\n\r\nRock gypsum is mainly used in making \"plaster of Paris,\" as a retarder\r\nin cement, and as a fertilizer (so-called \"land plaster\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY OF COMMON\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL TERMS\r\n\r\n\r\nNames of subkingdoms and important classes of fossil plants and\r\nanimals, and mineral species, are not included; these being briefly and\r\nsystematically discussed in chapters 17, 18, 19, and 20, respectively.\r\nBy using the index the reader can quickly locate the page where any\r\none of these names is discussed.

It is a process of\r\n     weathering.\r\n\r\n  _Fault._--A fracture in the earth's crust accompanied by movement of\r\n     the rock on one side of the break past that on the other. If the\r\n     fracture is inclined and the rock on one side appears to have slid\r\n     down the slope of the fracture the fault is termed a normal fault.\r\n     If, on the other hand, the rock on one side appears to have been\r\n     shoved up the inclined plane of the break, the fault is termed a\r\n     reverse or thrust fault.\r\n\r\n  _Fault-block._--A part of the earth's crust bounded wholly or in part\r\n     by faults.\r\n\r\n  _Fault-scarp._--The cliff formed by a fault. Most fault scarps have\r\n     been modified by erosion since the faulting.\r\n\r\n  _Fissure._--A crack, break, or fracture in the earth's crust or in a\r\n     mass of rock.\r\n\r\n  _Flood-plain._--The nearly level land that borders a stream and is\r\n     subject to occasional overflow.

Preservation is invariably accompanied by some change\r\n     in substance, and from some fossils the original substance has all\r\n     been removed.\r\n\r\n  _Geography._--The study of the distribution of the earth's physical\r\n     features, in their relation to each other to the life of sea and\r\n     land, and human life and culture.\r\n\r\n  _Geology._--The science which deals with the history of the earth and\r\n     its inhabitants as revealed in the rocks.\r\n\r\n  _Glacier._--A body of ice which slowly spreads or moves over the land\r\n     from its place of accumulation.\r\n\r\n  _Gneiss_ (pronounced nice).--A metamorphic, crystalline rock with\r\n     mineral grains arranged with long axes more or less parallel,\r\n     giving the rock a banded appearance. Derived from either igneous\r\n     or stratified rocks well within the earth under conditions of\r\n     pressure, and usually also heat and moisture.\r\n\r\n  _Igneous Rocks._--Rocks formed by the cooling and solidification\r\n     of a hot liquid material, known as magma, that has originated\r\n     at unknown depths within the earth. Those that have solidified\r\n     beneath the surface are known as intrusive rocks, or if the\r\n     cooling has taken place slowly at great depth, as plutonic rocks,\r\n     e.g. granite. Those that have flowed out over the surface are\r\n     known as effusive rocks, extrusive rocks, or lavas, e.g., basalt.\r\n     Volcanic rocks include not only lavas, but bombs, pumice, tuff,\r\n     volcanic ash, and other fragmental materials or ejecta thrown out\r\n     from volcanoes.\r\n\r\n  _Joints._--Nearly all rocks, except very loose surface materials, are\r\n     separated into blocks of varying size and shape by a system of\r\n     cracks called joints. They may be caused by earth-crust movements,\r\n     contraction during solidification of molten rocks, or contraction\r\n     during drying out of sediments.\r\n\r\n  _Jurassic._--The middle one of the three periods of the Mesozoic era\r\n     of geologic time.\r\n\r\n  _Lava._--An igneous rock which in molten condition has poured out\r\n     upon or close to the earth's surface, e.g. basalt.\r\n\r\n  _Limestone._--A sedimentary rock consisting essentially of carbonate\r\n     of lime which generally represents accumulation of shells of\r\n     organisms, but in some cases precipitates from solution.

A loop in a stream. Most\r\n     streams in flowing across plains develop meanders.\r\n\r\n  _Mesa._--A flat-topped hill or mountain left isolated during the\r\n     general erosion or cutting down of a region.\r\n\r\n  _Mesozoic._--Next to the present era of geologic time. _ Metamorphic\r\n     Rock._--Any igneous or sedimentary rock which has undergone\r\n     metamorphism, that is notable alteration from its original\r\n     condition. (See Metamorphism.)\r\n\r\n  _Metamorphism._--Any change in rocks effected in the earth by heat,\r\n     pressure, solutions, or gases. A common cause of the metamorphism\r\n     of rocks is the intrusion into them of igneous rocks. Rocks that\r\n     have been so changed are termed metamorphic. Marble, for example,\r\n     is metamorphosed limestone.\r\n\r\n  _Mineral._--An inorganic substance of definite chemical composition\r\n     found ready made in nature, e.g. calcite, quartz.\r\n\r\n  _Mississippian._--A period of the Paleozoic era of geologic time--in\r\n     order of age, the third from the last of the era.\r\n\r\n  _Moraine._--Glacial drift carried on, within, or under a glacier and\r\n     deposited at the end, along the sides, or under the glacier.\r\n\r\n  _Oil-pool._--An accumulation or body of oil in sedimentary rock that\r\n     yields petroleum on drilling. The oil occurs in the pores of the\r\n     rock and is not a pool or pond in the ordinary sense of these\r\n     words.\r\n\r\n  _Ordovician._--Next to the earliest period of the Paleozoic era of\r\n     geologic time.\r\n\r\n  _Ore._--A metal-bearing mineral or rock of sufficient value to be\r\n     mined.\r\n\r\n  _Outcrop._--That part of a rock formation which appears at the\r\n     surface. The appearance of a rock at the surface or its projection\r\n     above the soil. Often called an exposure.\r\n\r\n  _Paleontology._--The study of the world's (geologically) ancient\r\n     life, either plant or animal, by means of fossils.\r\n\r\n  _Paleozoic._--An old era of geologic time--third back from the\r\n     present.\r\n\r\n  _Peneplain._--A region reduced almost to a plain by the\r\n     long-continued normal erosion of a land surface. It should be\r\n     distinguished from a plain produced by the attack of waves along a\r\n     coast or the built-up flood plain of a river.\r\n\r\n  _Pennsylvanian._--Next to the last period of the Paleozoic era of\r\n     geologic time.\r\n\r\n  _Period._--A name applied to one of the subdivisions of an era of\r\n     geologic time, e.g. Cambrian period.\r\n\r\n  _Permian._--The last period of the Paleozoic era of geologic time.\r\n\r\n  _Petrology._--The study of rocks, including igneous, sedimentary, and\r\n     metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\n  _Physiography._--The study of the relief features of the earth and\r\n     how they were produced.\r\n\r\n  _Placer Deposit._--A mass of gravel, sand, or similar material\r\n     resulting from the crumbling and erosion of solid rocks and\r\n     containing particles or nuggets of gold, platinum, tin, or other\r\n     valuable minerals, which have been derived from rocks or veins.\r\n\r\n  _Plutonic Rock._--An igneous rock solidified from a molten condition\r\n     well within the earth. (See Igneous Rocks.)\r\n\r\n  _Proterozoic._--Next to the earliest known era of geologic time.\r\n\r\n  _Quartzite._--A metamorphic rock composed of sand grains cemented by\r\n     silica into an extremely hard mass.\r\n\r\n  _Quaternary._--The later of the two periods of the Cenozoic era of\r\n     geologic time.\r\n\r\n  _Rejuvenated._--Any region which has been subjected to erosion for\r\n     a greater or less length of time and then reelevated so that the\r\n     streams are renewed in activity.\r\n\r\n  _Rock._--Any extensive constituent of the crust of the earth, usually\r\n     consisting of a mechanical mixture of two or more minerals, e.g.\r\n     granite, shale. Less commonly a rock consists of a single mineral\r\n     (e.g. pure marble), or of organic matter (e.g. coal).\r\n\r\n  _Sandstone._--A sedimentary rock consisting of consolidated or\r\n     cemented sand. Often shaly or limy.\r\n\r\n  _Schist._--A rock that by subjection to heat and pressure and usually\r\n     moisture within the earth has undergone a change in the character\r\n     of the particles or minerals that compose it and has these\r\n     minerals arranged in such a way that the rock splits more easily\r\n     in certain directions than in others. It is a metamorphic rock\r\n     derived from either sedimentary or igneous rock, more commonly the\r\n     former.\r\n\r\n  _Sedimentary Rocks._--Rocks formed by the accumulation of sediment\r\n     in water (aqueous deposits) or from air (eolian deposits). The\r\n     sediment may consist of rock fragments or particles of various\r\n     sizes (conglomerate, sandstone, shale); of the remains or products\r\n     of animals or plants (certain limestones and coal); of the product\r\n     of chemical action or of evaporation (salt, gypsum, etc.); or of\r\n     mixtures of these materials. Some sedimentary deposits (tuffs)\r\n     are composed of fragments blown from volcanoes and deposited on\r\n     land or in water. A characteristic feature of sedimentary deposits\r\n     is a layered structure known as bedding or stratification. Each\r\n     layer is a bed or stratum. Sedimentary beds as deposited lie flat\r\n     or nearly flat, but subsequently they have often been deformed by\r\n     folding and faulting.\r\n\r\n  _Shale._--A sedimentary rock consisting of hardened thin layers of\r\n     fine mud.\r\n\r\n  _Silurian._--A period of the Paleozoic era of geologic time--in order\r\n     of age, the third from the beginning of the era.\r\n\r\n  _Slate._--A rock that by subjection to pressure within the earth has\r\n     acquired the property of splitting smoothly into thin plates. The\r\n     cleavage is smoother and more regular than the splitting of schist\r\n     along its grain. It is a metamorphic rock nearly always derived\r\n     from shale.\r\n\r\n  _Soil._--The mantle of loose material resting upon bedrock, either in\r\n     its place of origin or transported by water, wind, or ice.\r\n\r\n  _Strata_ (or stratified rocks).--Sedimentary rocks which, by the\r\n     sorting power of water (less often by wind), are arranged in\r\n     more or less definite layers or beds separated by stratification\r\n     surfaces.\r\n\r\n  _Stratification._--The separation of sedimentary rocks into more or\r\n     less parallel layers or beds.\r\n\r\n  _Stratigraphy._--The branch of geologic science that deals with the\r\n     order and relations of the strata of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\n  _Structure._--In geology, the forms assumed by sedimentary beds and\r\n     igneous rocks that have been moved from their original position by\r\n     forces within the earth, or the forms taken by intrusive masses\r\n     of igneous rock in connection with effects produced mechanically\r\n     on neighboring rocks by the intrusion. Folds (anticlines and\r\n     synclines) and faults are the principal mechanical effects\r\n     considered under structure. Schistosity and cleavage are also\r\n     structural features.\r\n\r\n  _Syncline._--A kind of folded structure in which strata have been\r\n     bent downward. It is an inverted arch--the opposite of an\r\n     anticline.\r\n\r\n  _Talus_ (pronounced t[=a]y'lus).--The mass of loose rock fragments\r\n     that accumulates at the base of a cliff or steep slope.\r\n\r\n  _Terrace._--A steplike bench on a hillside. Most terraces along\r\n     rivers are remnants of valley bottoms formed when the stream\r\n     flowed at higher levels. Other terraces have been formed by waves.\r\n     Some terraces have been cut in solid rock, others have been built\r\n     up of sand and gravel, and still others have been partly cut and\r\n     partly built up.\r\n\r\n  _Tertiary._--The earlier of the two periods of the Cenozoic era of\r\n     geologic time.\r\n\r\n  _Triassic._--The earliest period of the Mesozoic Era of geologic time.\r\n\r\n  _Unconformity._--A break in the regular succession of sedimentary\r\n     rocks, indicated by the fact that one bed rests on the eroded\r\n     surface of one or more beds which may have a distinctly different\r\n     dip from the bed above. An unconformity may indicate that the beds\r\n     below it have at some time been raised above the sea and have been\r\n     eroded. In some places beds thousands of feet thick have been\r\n     washed away before the land again became submerged and the first\r\n     bed above the surface of unconformity was deposited. If beds of\r\n     rock may be regarded as leaves in the volume of geologic history,\r\n     an unconformity marks a gap in the record.\r\n\r\n  _Vein._--A mass of mineral material that has been deposited in or\r\n     along a fissure in the rocks. A vein differs from a dike in that\r\n     the vein material was introduced gradually by deposition from\r\n     solution, whereas a dike was intruded in a molten condition.\r\n     Quartz and calcite are very common vein minerals.\r\n\r\n  _Volcanic Rocks._--Igneous rocks erupted at or near the earth's\r\n     surface, including lavas, tuffs, volcanic ashes, and like material.\r\n\r\n  _Weathering._--The group of processes, such as the chemical action of\r\n     air and rain water, and of plants and bacteria, and the mechanical\r\n     action of changes of temperature, whereby rocks on exposure to the\r\n     weather change in character, decay, and finally crumble into soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Note\r\n\r\n\r\nAll illustrations splitting paragraphs were moved before or after the\r\nparagraph.
