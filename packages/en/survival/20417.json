Arthur Thomson\r\n\r\n\r\nWas it not the great philosopher and mathematician Leibnitz who said\r\nthat the more knowledge advances the more it becomes possible to\r\ncondense it into little books? Now this \"Outline of Science\" is\r\ncertainly not a little book, and yet it illustrates part of the meaning\r\nof Leibnitz's wise saying. For here within reasonable compass there is a\r\nlibrary of little books--an outline of many sciences.\r\n\r\nIt will be profitable to the student in proportion to the discrimination\r\nwith which it is used. For it is not in the least meant to be of the\r\nnature of an Encyclopædia, giving condensed and comprehensive articles\r\nwith a big full stop at the end of each. Nor is it a collection of\r\n\"primers,\" beginning at the very beginning of each subject and working\r\nmethodically onwards. That is not the idea.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the aim of this book? It is to give the intelligent\r\nstudent-citizen, otherwise called \"the man in the street,\" a bunch of\r\nintellectual keys by which to open doors which have been hitherto shut\r\nto him, partly because he got no glimpse of the treasures behind the\r\ndoors, and partly because the portals were made forbidding by an\r\nunnecessary display of technicalities. Laying aside conventional modes\r\nof treatment and seeking rather to open up the subject as one might on a\r\nwalk with a friend, the work offers the student what might be called\r\ninformal introductions to the various departments of knowledge. To put\r\nit in another way, the articles are meant to be clues which the reader\r\nmay follow till he has left his starting point very far behind. Perhaps\r\nwhen he has gone far on his own he will not be ungrateful to the simple\r\nbook of \"instructions to travellers\" which this \"Outline of Science\" is\r\nintended to be. The simple \"bibliographies\" appended to the various\r\narticles will be enough to indicate \"first books.\" Each article is meant\r\nto be an invitation to an intellectual adventure, and the short lists of\r\nbooks are merely finger-posts for the beginning of the journey.\r\n\r\nWe confess to being greatly encouraged by the reception that has been\r\ngiven to the English serial issue of \"The Outline of Science.\" It has\r\nbeen very hearty--we might almost say enthusiastic. For we agree with\r\nProfessor John Dewey, that \"the future of our civilisation depends upon\r\nthe widening spread and deepening hold of the scientific habit of mind.\"\r\nAnd we hope that this is what \"The Outline of Science\" makes for.\r\nInformation is all to the good; interesting information is better still;\r\nbut best of all is the education of the scientific habit of mind.\r\nAnother modern philosopher, Professor L. T. Hobhouse, has declared that\r\nthe evolutionist's mundane goal is \"the mastery by the human mind of the\r\nconditions, internal as well as external, of its life and growth.\" Under\r\nthe influence of this conviction \"The Outline of Science\" has been\r\nwritten. For life is not for science, but science for life. And even\r\nmore than science, to our way of thinking, is the individual development\r\nof the scientific way of looking at things. Science is our legacy; we\r\nmust use it if it is to be our very own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION                                                           3\r\n\r\nI.

How could it be otherwise when we think of the magnitude and\r\nthe eventfulness of recent advances?\r\n\r\nBut the interest of the general public would be even greater than it is\r\nif the makers of new knowledge were more willing to expound their\r\ndiscoveries in ways that could be \"understanded of the people.\" No one\r\nobjects very much to technicalities in a game or on board a yacht, and\r\nthey are clearly necessary for terse and precise scientific description.\r\nIt is certain, however, that they can be reduced to a minimum without\r\nsacrificing accuracy, when the object in view is to explain \"the gist of\r\nthe matter.\" So this OUTLINE OF SCIENCE is meant for the general reader,\r\nwho lacks both time and opportunity for special study, and yet would\r\ntake an intelligent interest in the progress of science which is making\r\nthe world always new.\r\n\r\nThe story of the triumphs of modern science is one of which Man may well\r\nbe proud. Science reads the secret of the distant star and anatomises\r\nthe atom; foretells the date of the comet's return and predicts the\r\nkinds of chickens that will hatch from a dozen eggs; discovers the laws\r\nof the wind that bloweth where it listeth and reduces to order the\r\ndisorder of disease. Science is always setting forth on Columbus\r\nvoyages, discovering new worlds and conquering them by understanding.\r\nFor Knowledge means Foresight and Foresight means Power.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Evolution has influenced all the sciences, forcing us to\r\nthink of _everything_ as with a history behind it, for we have travelled\r\nfar since Darwin's day. The solar system, the earth, the mountain\r\nranges, and the great deeps, the rocks and crystals, the plants and\r\nanimals, man himself and his social institutions--all must be seen as\r\nthe outcome of a long process of Becoming. There are some eighty-odd\r\nchemical elements on the earth to-day, and it is now much more than a\r\nsuggestion that these are the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element\r\ngiving rise to element, going back and back to some primeval stuff, from\r\nwhich they were all originally derived, infinitely long ago. No idea has\r\nbeen so powerful a tool in the fashioning of New Knowledge as this\r\nsimple but profound idea of Evolution, that the present is the child of\r\nthe past and the parent of the future. And with the picture of a\r\ncontinuity of evolution from nebula to social systems comes a promise of\r\nan increasing control--a promise that Man will become not only a more\r\naccurate student, but a more complete master of his world.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of modern science that the whole world is seen to\r\nbe more vital than before. Everywhere there has been a passage from the\r\nstatic to the dynamic. Thus the new revelations of the constitution of\r\nmatter, which we owe to the discoveries of men like Professor Sir J. J.\r\nThomson, Professor Sir Ernest Rutherford, and Professor Frederick Soddy,\r\nhave shown the very dust to have a complexity and an activity heretofore\r\nunimagined. Such phrases as \"dead\" matter and \"inert\" matter have gone\r\nby the board.\r\n\r\nThe new theory of the atom amounts almost to a new conception of the\r\nuniverse. It bids fair to reveal to us many of nature's hidden secrets.\r\nThe atom is no longer the indivisible particle of matter it was once\r\nunderstood to be. We know now that there is an atom within the\r\natom--that what we thought was elementary can be dissociated and broken\r\nup. The present-day theories of the atom and the constitution of matter\r\nare the outcome of the comparatively recent discovery of such things as\r\nradium, the X-rays, and the wonderful revelations of such instruments as\r\nthe spectroscope and other highly perfected scientific instruments.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the electron theory has thrown a flood of light on what\r\nbefore was hidden or only dimly guessed at. It has given us a new\r\nconception of the framework of the universe. We are beginning to know\r\nand realise of what matter is made and what electric phenomena mean. We\r\ncan glimpse the vast stores of energy locked up in matter. The new\r\nknowledge has much to tell us about the origin and phenomena, not only\r\nof our own planet, but other planets, of the stars, and the sun. New\r\nlight is thrown on the source of the sun's heat; we can make more than\r\nguesses as to its probable age. The great question to-day is: is there\r\n_one_ primordial substance from which all the varying forms of matter\r\nhave been evolved?\r\n\r\nBut the discovery of electrons is only one of the revolutionary changes\r\nwhich give modern science an entrancing interest.\r\n\r\nAs in chemistry and physics, so in the science of living creatures there\r\nhave been recent advances that have changed the whole prospect. A good\r\ninstance is afforded by the discovery of the \"hormones,\" or chemical\r\nmessengers, which are produced by ductless glands, such as the thyroid,\r\nthe supra-renal, and the pituitary, and are distributed throughout the\r\nbody by the blood. The work of physiologists like Professor Starling and\r\nProfessor Bayliss has shown that these chemical messengers regulate what\r\nmay be called the \"pace\" of the body, and bring about that regulated\r\nharmony and smoothness of working which we know as health. It is not too\r\nmuch to say that the discovery of hormones has changed the whole of\r\nphysiology. Our knowledge of the human body far surpasses that of the\r\npast generation.\r\n\r\nThe persistent patience of microscopists and technical improvements like\r\nthe \"ultramicroscope\" have greatly increased our knowledge of the\r\ninvisible world of life. To the bacteria of a past generation have been\r\nadded a multitude of microscopic _animal_ microbes, such as that which\r\ncauses Sleeping Sickness. The life-histories and the weird ways of many\r\nimportant parasites have been unravelled; and here again knowledge means\r\nmastery. To a degree which has almost surpassed expectations there has\r\nbeen a revelation of the intricacy of the stones and mortar of the house\r\nof life, and the microscopic study of germ-cells has wonderfully\r\nsupplemented the epoch-making experimental study of heredity which began\r\nwith Mendel. It goes without saying that no one can call himself\r\neducated who does not understand the central and simple ideas of\r\nMendelism and other new departures in biology.\r\n\r\nThe procession of life through the ages and the factors in the sublime\r\nmovement; the peopling of the earth by plants and animals and the\r\nlinking of life to life in subtle inter-relations, such as those between\r\nflowers and their insect-visitors; the life-histories of individual\r\ntypes and the extraordinary results of the new inquiry called\r\n\"experimental embryology\"--these also are among the subjects with which\r\nthis OUTLINE will deal.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of animals is another fascinating study, leading to a\r\nprovisional picture of the dawn of mind. Indeed, no branch of science\r\nsurpasses in interest that which deals with the ways and habits--the\r\ntruly wonderful devices, adaptations, and instincts--of insects, birds,\r\nand mammals. We no longer deny a degree of intelligence to some members\r\nof the animal world--even the line between intelligence and reason is\r\nsometimes difficult to find.\r\n\r\nFresh contacts between physiology and the study of man's mental life;\r\nprecise studies of the ways of children and wild peoples; and new\r\nmethods like those of the psycho-analyst must also receive the attention\r\nthey deserve, for they are giving us a \"New Psychology\" and the claims\r\nof psychical research must also be recognised by the open-minded.\r\n\r\nThe general aim of the OUTLINE is to give the reader a clear and concise\r\nview of the essentials of present-day science, so that he may follow\r\nwith intelligence the modern advance and share appreciatively in man's\r\ncontinued conquest of his kingdom.\r\n\r\nJ. ARTHUR THOMSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF THE HEAVENS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE--THE SOLAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nThe story of the triumphs of modern science naturally opens with\r\nAstronomy. The picture of the Universe which the astronomer offers to us\r\nis imperfect; the lines he traces are often faint and uncertain. There\r\nare many problems which have been solved, there are just as many about\r\nwhich there is doubt, and notwithstanding our great increase in\r\nknowledge, there remain just as many which are entirely unsolved.\r\n\r\n    The problem of the structure and duration of the universe [said the\r\n    great astronomer Simon Newcomb] is the most far-reaching with which\r\n    the mind has to deal. Its solution may be regarded as the ultimate\r\n    object of stellar astronomy, the possibility of reaching which has\r\n    occupied the minds of thinkers since the beginning of civilisation.\r\n    Before our time the problem could be considered only from the\r\n    imaginative or the speculative point of view. Although we can to-day\r\n    attack it to a limited extent by scientific methods, it must be\r\n    admitted that we have scarcely taken more than the first step toward\r\n    the actual solution.... What is the duration of the universe in\r\n    time? Is it fitted to last for ever in its present form, or does it\r\n    contain within itself the seeds of dissolution? Must it, in the\r\n    course of time, in we know not how many millions of ages, be\r\n    transformed into something very different from what it now is? This\r\n    question is intimately associated with the question whether the\r\n    stars form a system. If they do, we may suppose that system to be\r\n    permanent in its general features; if not, we must look further for\r\n    our conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Heavenly Bodies\r\n\r\nThe heavenly bodies fall into two very distinct classes so far as their\r\nrelation to our Earth is concerned; the one class, a very small one,\r\ncomprises a sort of colony of which the Earth is a member. These bodies\r\nare called _planets_, or wanderers. There are eight of them, including\r\nthe Earth, and they all circle round the sun. Their names, in the order\r\nof their distance from the sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,\r\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and of these Mercury, the nearest to\r\nthe sun, is rarely seen by the naked eye. Uranus is practically\r\ninvisible, and Neptune quite so. These eight planets, together with the\r\nsun, constitute, as we have said, a sort of little colony; this colony\r\nis called the Solar System.\r\n\r\nThe second class of heavenly bodies are those which lie _outside_ the\r\nsolar system. Every one of those glittering points we see on a starlit\r\nnight is at an immensely greater distance from us than is any member of\r\nthe Solar System. Yet the members of this little colony of ours, judged\r\nby terrestrial standards, are at enormous distances from one another. If\r\na shell were shot in a straight line from one side of Neptune's orbit to\r\nthe other it would take five hundred years to complete its journey. Yet\r\nthis distance, the greatest in the Solar System as now known (excepting\r\nthe far swing of some of the comets), is insignificant compared to the\r\ndistances of the stars. One of the nearest stars to the earth that we\r\nknow of is Alpha Centauri, estimated to be some twenty-five million\r\nmillions of miles away. Sirius, the brightest star in the firmament, is\r\ndouble this distance from the earth.\r\n\r\nWe must imagine the colony of planets to which we belong as a compact\r\nlittle family swimming in an immense void. At distances which would take\r\nour shell, not hundreds, but millions of years to traverse, we reach\r\nthe stars--or rather, a star, for the distances between stars are as\r\ngreat as the distance between the nearest of them and our Sun. The\r\nEarth, the planet on which we live, is a mighty globe bounded by a crust\r\nof rock many miles in thickness; the great volumes of water which we\r\ncall our oceans lie in the deeper hollows of the crust. Above the\r\nsurface an ocean of invisible gas, the atmosphere, rises to a height of\r\nabout three hundred miles, getting thinner and thinner as it ascends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAPLACE\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest mathematical astronomers of all time and the\r\noriginator of the nebular theory.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Royal Astronomical Society._\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR J.

On the above scale the\r\n_nearest_ star (at a distance of 25 trillions of miles) would be over\r\n_one half mile_ away. The hours, days, and years are the measures of\r\ntime as we use them; that is: Jupiter's \"Day\" (one rotation of the\r\nplanet) is made in ten of _our hours_; Mercury's \"Year\" (one revolution\r\nof the planet around the Sun) is eighty-eight of _our days_. Mercury's\r\n\"Day\" and \"Year\" are the same. This planet turns always the same side to\r\nthe Sun.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COMPARATIVE SIZES OF THE SUN AND THE PLANETS (Drawn\r\napproximately to scale)\r\n\r\nOn this scale the Sun would be 17-1/2 inches in diameter; it is far\r\ngreater than all the planets put together. Jupiter, in turn, is greater\r\nthan all the other planets put together.]\r\n\r\nExcept when the winds rise to a high speed, we seem to live in a very\r\ntranquil world. At night, when the glare of the sun passes out of our\r\natmosphere, the stars and planets seem to move across the heavens with a\r\nstately and solemn slowness. It was one of the first discoveries of\r\nmodern astronomy that this movement is only apparent. The apparent\r\ncreeping of the stars across the heavens at night is accounted for by\r\nthe fact that the earth turns upon its axis once in every twenty-four\r\nhours. When we remember the size of the earth we see that this implies a\r\nprodigious speed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this the earth revolves round the sun at a speed of more\r\nthan a thousand miles a minute. Its path round the sun, year in year\r\nout, measures about 580,000,000 miles. The earth is held closely to this\r\npath by the gravitational pull of the sun, which has a mass 333,432\r\ntimes that of the earth. If at any moment the sun ceased to exert this\r\npull the earth would instantly fly off into space straight in the\r\ndirection in which it was moving at the time, that is to say, at a\r\ntangent. This tendency to fly off at a tangent is continuous. It is the\r\nbalance between it and the sun's pull which keeps the earth to her\r\nalmost circular orbit. In the same way the seven other planets are held\r\nto their orbits.\r\n\r\nCircling round the earth, in the same way as the earth circles round the\r\nsun, is our moon. Sometimes the moon passes directly between us and the\r\nsun, and cuts off the light from us. We then have a total or partial\r\neclipse of the sun. At other times the earth passes directly between the\r\nsun and the moon, and causes an eclipse of the moon. The great ball of\r\nthe earth naturally trails a mighty shadow across space, and the moon is\r\n\"eclipsed\" when it passes into this.\r\n\r\nThe other seven planets, five of which have moons of their own, circle\r\nround the sun as the earth does. The sun's mass is immensely larger than\r\nthat of all the planets put together, and all of them would be drawn\r\ninto it and perish if they did not travel rapidly round it in gigantic\r\norbits. So the eight planets, spinning round on their axes, follow their\r\nfixed paths round the sun. The planets are secondary bodies, but they\r\nare most important, because they are the only globes in which there can\r\nbe life, as we know life.\r\n\r\nIf we could be transported in some magical way to an immense distance in\r\nspace above the sun, we should see our Solar System as it is drawn in\r\nthe accompanying diagram (Fig. 1), except that the planets would be mere\r\nspecks, faintly visible in the light which they receive from the sun.\r\n(This diagram is drawn approximately to scale.) If we moved still\r\nfarther away, trillions of miles away, the planets would fade entirely\r\nout of view, and the sun would shrink into a point of fire, a star. And\r\nhere you begin to realize the nature of the universe. _The sun is a\r\nstar. The stars are suns._ Our sun looks big simply because of its\r\ncomparative nearness to us. The universe is a stupendous collection of\r\nmillions of stars or suns, many of which may have planetary families\r\nlike ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nThe Scale of the Universe\r\n\r\nHow many stars are there? A glance at a photograph of star-clouds will\r\ntell at once that it is quite impossible to count them. The fine\r\nphotograph reproduced in Figure 2 represents a very small patch of that\r\npale-white belt, the Milky Way, which spans the sky at night. It is true\r\nthat this is a particularly rich area of the Milky Way, but the entire\r\nbelt of light has been resolved in this way into masses or clouds of\r\nstars. Astronomers have counted the stars in typical districts here and\r\nthere, and from these partial counts we get some idea of the total\r\nnumber of stars. There are estimated to be between two and three\r\nthousand million stars.\r\n\r\nYet these stars are separated by inconceivable distances from each\r\nother, and it is one of the greatest triumphs of modern astronomy to\r\nhave mastered, so far, the scale of the universe. For several centuries\r\nastronomers have known the relative distances from each other of the sun\r\nand the planets. If they could discover the actual distance of any one\r\nplanet from any other, they could at once tell all the distances within\r\nthe Solar System.\r\n\r\nThe sun is, on the latest measurements, at an average distance of\r\n92,830,000 miles from the earth, for as the orbit of the earth is not a\r\ntrue circle, this distance varies. This means that in six months from\r\nnow the earth will be right at the opposite side of its path round the\r\nsun, or 185,000,000 miles away from where it is now. Viewed or\r\nphotographed from two positions so wide apart, the nearest stars show a\r\ntiny \"shift\" against the background of the most distant stars, and that\r\nis enough for the mathematician. He can calculate the distance of any\r\nstar near enough to show this \"shift.\" We have found that the nearest\r\nstar to the earth, a recently discovered star, is twenty-five trillion\r\nmiles away. Only thirty stars are known to be within a hundred trillion\r\nmiles of us.\r\n\r\nThis way of measuring does not, however, take us very far away in the\r\nheavens. There are only a few hundred stars within five hundred trillion\r\nmiles of the earth, and at that distance the \"shift\" of a star against\r\nthe background (parallax, the astronomer calls it) is so minute that\r\nfigures are very uncertain. At this point the astronomer takes up a new\r\nmethod. He learns the different types of stars, and then he is able to\r\ndeduce more or less accurately the distance of a star of a known type\r\nfrom its faintness. He, of course, has instruments for gauging their\r\nlight. As a result of twenty years work in this field, it is now known\r\nthat the more distant stars of the Milky Way are at least a hundred\r\nthousand trillion (100,000,000,000,000,000) miles away from the sun.\r\n\r\nOur sun is in a more or less central region of the universe, or a few\r\nhundred trillion miles from the actual centre. The remainder of the\r\nstars, which are all outside our Solar System, are spread out,\r\napparently, in an enormous disc-like collection, so vast that even a ray\r\nof light, which travels at the rate of 186,000 miles a second, would\r\ntake 50,000 years to travel from one end of it to the other. This, then\r\nis what we call our universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there other Universes?\r\n\r\nWhy do we say \"our universe\"? Why not _the_ universe? It is now believed\r\nby many of our most distinguished astronomers that our colossal family\r\nof stars is only one of many universes. By a universe an astronomer\r\nmeans any collection of stars which are close enough to control each\r\nother's movements by gravitation; and it is clear that there might be\r\nmany universes, in this sense, separated from each other by profound\r\nabysses of space. Probably there are.\r\n\r\nFor a long time we have been familiar with certain strange objects in\r\nthe heavens which are called \"spiral nebulæ\" (Fig 4). We shall see at a\r\nlater stage what a nebula is, and we shall see that some astronomers\r\nregard these spiral nebulæ as worlds \"in the making.\" But some of the\r\nmost eminent astronomers believe that they are separate\r\nuniverses--\"island-universes\" they call them--or great collections of\r\nmillions of stars like our universe. There are certain peculiarities in\r\nthe structure of the Milky Way which lead these astronomers to think\r\nthat our universe may be a spiral nebula, and that the other spiral\r\nnebulæ are \"other universes.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Harvard College Observatory._\r\n\r\nFIG. 2.--THE MILKY WAY\r\n\r\nNote the cloud-like effect.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3--THE MOON ENTERING THE SHADOW CAST BY THE EARTH\r\n\r\nThe diagram shows the Moon partially eclipsed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From a photograph taken at the Yerkes Observatory_\r\n\r\nFIG. 4.--THE GREAT NEBULA IN ANDROMEDA, MESSIER 31]\r\n\r\nVast as is the Solar System, then, it is excessively minute in\r\ncomparison with the Stellar System, the universe of the Stars, which is\r\non a scale far transcending anything the human mind can apprehend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\nTHE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nBut now let us turn to the Solar System, and consider the members of our\r\nown little colony.\r\n\r\nWithin the Solar System there are a large number of problems that\r\ninterest us. What is the size, mass, and distance of each of the\r\nplanets? What satellites, like our Moon, do they possess? What are their\r\ntemperatures? And those other, sporadic members of our system, comets\r\nand meteors, what are they? What are their movements? How do they\r\noriginate? And the Sun itself, what is its composition, what is the\r\nsource of its heat, how did it originate? Is it running down?\r\n\r\nThese last questions introduce us to a branch of astronomy which is\r\nconcerned with the physical constitution of the stars, a study which,\r\nnot so very many years ago, may well have appeared inconceivable. But\r\nthe spectroscope enables us to answer even these questions, and the\r\nanswer opens up questions of yet greater interest. We find that the\r\nstars can be arranged in an order of development--that there are stars\r\nat all stages of their life-history. The main lines of the evolution of\r\nthe stellar universe can be worked out. In the sun and stars we have\r\nfurnaces with temperatures enormously high; it is in such conditions\r\nthat substances are resolved into their simplest forms, and it is thus\r\nwe are enabled to obtain a knowledge of the most primitive forms of\r\nmatter. It is in this direction that the spectroscope (which we shall\r\nrefer to immediately) has helped us so much. It is to this wonderful\r\ninstrument that we owe our knowledge of the composition of the sun and\r\nstars, as we shall see.\r\n\r\n    \"That the spectroscope will detect the millionth of a milligram of\r\n    matter, and on that account has discovered new elements, commands\r\n    our admiration; but when we find in addition that it will detect the\r\n    nature of forms of matter trillions of miles away, and moreover,\r\n    that it will measure the velocities with which these forms of matter\r\n    are moving with an absurdly small per cent. of possible error, we\r\n    can easily acquiesce in the statement that it is the greatest\r\n    instrument ever devised by the brain and hand of man.\"\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the questions with which modern astronomy deals. To\r\nanswer them requires the employment of instruments of almost incredible\r\nrefinement and exactitude and also the full resources of mathematical\r\ngenius. Whether astronomy be judged from the point of view of the\r\nphenomena studied, the vast masses, the immense distances, the æons of\r\ntime, or whether it be judged as a monument of human ingenuity,\r\npatience, and the rarest type of genius, it is certainly one of the\r\ngrandest, as it is also one of the oldest, of the sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Solar System\r\n\r\nIn the Solar System we include all those bodies dependent on the sun\r\nwhich circulate round it at various distances, deriving their light and\r\nheat from the sun--the planets and their moons, certain comets and a\r\nmultitude of meteors: in other words, all bodies whose movements in\r\nspace are determined by the gravitational pull of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sun\r\n\r\nThanks to our wonderful modern instruments and the ingenious methods\r\nused by astronomers, we have to-day a remarkable knowledge of the sun.\r\n\r\nLook at the figure of the sun in the frontispiece. The picture\r\nrepresents an eclipse of the sun; the dark body of the moon has screened\r\nthe sun's shining disc and taken the glare out of our eyes; we see a\r\nsilvery halo surrounding the great orb on every side. It is the sun's\r\natmosphere, or \"crown\" (corona), stretching for millions of miles into\r\nspace in the form of a soft silvery-looking light; probably much of its\r\nlight is sunlight reflected from particles of dust, although the\r\nspectroscope shows an element in the corona that has not so far been\r\ndetected anywhere else in the universe and which in consequence has been\r\nnamed Coronium.\r\n\r\nWe next notice in the illustration that at the base of the halo there\r\nare red flames peeping out from the edges of the hidden disc. When one\r\nremembers that the sun is 866,000 miles in diameter, one hardly needs to\r\nbe told that these flames are really gigantic. We shall see what they\r\nare presently.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegions of the Sun\r\n\r\nThe astronomer has divided the sun into definite concentric regions or\r\nlayers. These layers envelop the nucleus or central body of the sun\r\nsomewhat as the atmosphere envelops our earth. It is through these\r\nvapour layers that the bright white body of the sun is seen. Of the\r\ninnermost region, the heart or nucleus of the sun, we know almost\r\nnothing. The central body or nucleus is surrounded by a brilliantly\r\nluminous envelope or layer of vaporous matter which is what we see when\r\nwe look at the sun and which the astronomer calls the photosphere.\r\n\r\nAbove--that is, overlying--the photosphere there is a second layer of\r\nglowing gases, which is known as the reversing layer. This layer is\r\ncooler than the underlying photosphere; it forms a veil of smoke-like\r\nhaze and is of from 500 to 1,000 miles in thickness.\r\n\r\nA third layer or envelope immediately lying over the last one is the\r\nregion known as the chromosphere. The chromosphere extends from 5,000\r\nto 10,000 miles in thickness--a \"sea\" of red tumultuous surging fire.\r\nChief among the glowing gases is the vapour of hydrogen. The intense\r\nwhite heat of the photosphere beneath shines through this layer,\r\noverpowering its brilliant redness. From the uppermost portion of the\r\nchromosphere great fiery tongues of glowing hydrogen and calcium vapour\r\nshoot out for many thousands of miles, driven outward by some prodigious\r\nexpulsive force. It is these red \"prominences\" which are such a notable\r\nfeature in the picture of the eclipse of the sun already referred to.\r\n\r\nDuring the solar eclipse of 1919 one of these red flames rose in less\r\nthan seven hours from a height of 130,000 miles to more than 500,000\r\nmiles above the sun's surface. This immense column of red-hot gas, four\r\nor five times the thickness of the earth, was soaring upward at the rate\r\nof 60,000 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThese flaming jets or prominences shooting out from the chromosphere are\r\nnot to be seen every day by the naked eye; the dazzling light of the sun\r\nobscures them, gigantic as they are. They can be observed, however, by\r\nthe spectroscope any day, and they are visible to us for a very short\r\ntime during an eclipse of the sun. Some extraordinary outbursts have\r\nbeen witnessed. Thus the late Professor Young described one on September\r\n7, 1871, when he had been examining a prominence by the spectroscope:\r\n\r\n    It had remained unchanged since noon of the previous day--a long,\r\n    low, quiet-looking cloud, not very dense, or brilliant, or in any\r\n    way remarkable except for its size. At 12:30 p.m. the Professor left\r\n    the spectroscope for a short time, and on returning half an hour\r\n    later to his observations, he was astonished to find the gigantic\r\n    Sun flame shattered to pieces. The solar atmosphere was filled with\r\n    flying debris, and some of these portions reached a height of\r\n    100,000 miles above the solar surface. Moving with a velocity which,\r\n    even at the distance of 93,000,000 miles, was almost perceptible to\r\n    the eye, these fragments doubled their height in ten minutes. On\r\n    January 30, 1885, another distinguished solar observer, the late\r\n    Professor Tacchini of Rome, observed one of the greatest prominences\r\n    ever seen by man. Its height was no less than 142,000\r\n    miles--eighteen times the diameter of the earth. Another mighty\r\n    flame was so vast that supposing the eight large planets of the\r\n    solar system ranged one on top of the other, the prominence would\r\n    still tower above them.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] _The Romance of Astronomy_, by H. Macpherson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--DIAGRAM SHOWING THE MAIN LAYERS OF THE SUN\r\n\r\nCompare with frontispiece.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Royal Observatory, Greenwich._\r\n\r\nFIG. 6.--SOLAR PROMINENCES SEEN AT TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE, May 29, 1919.\r\nTAKEN AT SOBRAL, BRAZIL.\r\n\r\nThe small Corona is also visible.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--THE VISIBLE SURFACE OF THE SUN\r\n\r\nA photograph taken at the Mount Wilson Observatory of the Carnegie\r\nInstitution at Washington.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--THE SUN\r\n\r\nPhotographed in the light of glowing hydrogen, at the Mount Wilson\r\nObservatory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington: vortex phenomena\r\nnear the spots are especially prominent.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth and uppermost layer or region is that of the corona, of\r\nimmense extent and fading away into the surrounding sky--this we have\r\nalready referred to. The diagram (Fig. 5) shows the dispositions of\r\nthese various layers of the sun. It is through these several transparent\r\nlayers that we see the white light body of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nThe Surface of the Sun\r\n\r\nHere let us return to and see what more we know about the\r\nphotosphere--the sun's surface. It is from the photosphere that we have\r\ngained most of our knowledge of the composition of the sun, which is\r\nbelieved not to be a solid body. Examination of the photosphere shows\r\nthat the outer surface is never at rest. Small bright cloudlets come and\r\ngo in rapid succession, giving the surface, through contrasts in\r\nluminosity, a granular appearance. Of course, to be visible at all at\r\n92,830,000 miles the cloudlets cannot be small. They imply enormous\r\nactivity in the photosphere. If we might speak picturesquely the sun's\r\nsurface resembles a boiling ocean of white-hot metal vapours. We have\r\nto-day a wonderful instrument, which will be described later, which\r\ndilutes, as it were, the general glare of the sun, and enables us to\r\nobserve these fiery eruptions at any hour. The \"oceans\" of red-hot gas\r\nand white-hot metal vapour at the sun's surface are constantly driven by\r\ngreat storms. Some unimaginable energy streams out from the body or\r\nmuscles of the sun and blows its outer layers into gigantic shreds, as\r\nit were.\r\n\r\nThe actual temperature at the sun's surface, or what appears to us to be\r\nthe surface--the photosphere--is, of course, unknown, but careful\r\ncalculation suggests that it is from 5,000° C. to 7,000° C. The interior\r\nis vastly hotter. We can form no conception of such temperatures as must\r\nexist there. Not even the most obdurate solid could resist such\r\ntemperatures, but would be converted almost instantaneously into gas.\r\nBut it would not be gas as we know gases on the earth. The enormous\r\npressures that exist on the sun must convert even gases into thick\r\ntreacly fluids. We can only infer this state of matter. It is beyond our\r\npower to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSun-spots\r\n\r\nIt is in the brilliant photosphere that the dark areas known as\r\nsun-spots appear. Some of these dark spots--they are dark only by\r\ncontrast with the photosphere surrounding them--are of enormous size,\r\ncovering many thousands of square miles of surface. What they are we\r\ncannot positively say. They look like great cavities in the sun's\r\nsurface. Some think they are giant whirlpools. Certainly they seem to be\r\ngreat whirling streams of glowing gases with vapours above them and\r\nimmense upward and downward currents within them. Round the edges of the\r\nsun-spots rise great tongues of flame.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most popularly known fact about sun-spots is that they are\r\nsomehow connected with what we call magnetic storms on earth. These\r\nmagnetic storms manifest themselves in interruptions of our telegraphic\r\nand telephonic communications, in violent disturbances of the mariner's\r\ncompass, and in exceptional auroral displays. The connection between the\r\ntwo sets of phenomena cannot be doubted, even although at times there\r\nmay be a great spot on the sun without any corresponding \"magnetic\r\nstorm\" effects on the earth.\r\n\r\nA surprising fact about sun-spots is that they show definite periodic\r\nvariations in number. The best-defined period is one of about eleven\r\nyears. During this period the spots increase to a maximum in number and\r\nthen diminish to a minimum, the variation being more or less regular.\r\nNow this can only mean one thing. To be periodic the spots must have\r\nsome deep-seated connection with the fundamental facts of the sun's\r\nstructure and activities. Looked at from this point of view their\r\nimportance becomes great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Reproduction from \"The Forces of Nature\"_ (_Messrs.\r\nMacmillan_)\r\n\r\nTHE AURORA BOREALIS\r\n\r\nThe aurora borealis is one of the most beautiful spectacles in the sky.\r\nThe colours and shape change every instant; sometimes a fan-like cluster\r\nof rays, at other times long golden draperies gliding one over the\r\nother. Blue, green, yellow, red, and white combine to give a glorious\r\ndisplay of colour. The theory of its origin is still, in part, obscure,\r\nbut there can be no doubt that the aurora is related to the magnetic\r\nphenomena of the earth and therefore is connected with the electrical\r\ninfluence of the sun.]\r\n\r\nIt is from the study of sun-spots that we have learned that the sun's\r\nsurface does not appear to rotate all at the same speed. The\r\n\"equatorial\" regions are rotating quicker than regions farther north or\r\nsouth. A point forty-five degrees from the equator seems to take about\r\ntwo and a half days longer to complete one rotation than a point on the\r\nequator. This, of course, confirms our belief that the sun cannot be a\r\nsolid body.\r\n\r\nWhat is its composition? We know that there are present, in a gaseous\r\nstate, such well-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and\r\nmagnesium; indeed, we know that there is practically every element in\r\nthe sun that we know to be in the earth. How do we know?\r\n\r\nIt is from the photosphere, as has been said, that we have won most of\r\nour knowledge of the sun. The instrument used for this purpose is the\r\nspectroscope; and before proceeding to deal further with the sun and the\r\nsource of its energy it will be better to describe this instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nA WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT AND WHAT IT REVEALS\r\n\r\nThe spectroscope is an instrument for analysing light. So important is\r\nit in the revelations it has given us that it will be best to describe\r\nit fully. Every substance to be examined must first be made to glow,\r\nmade luminous; and as nearly everything in the heavens _is_ luminous the\r\ninstrument has a great range in Astronomy. And when we speak of\r\nanalysing light, we mean that the light may be broken up into waves of\r\ndifferent lengths. What we call light is a series of minute waves in\r\nether, and these waves are--measuring them from crest to crest, so to\r\nsay--of various lengths. Each wave-length corresponds to a colour of the\r\nrainbow. The shortest waves give us a sensation of violet colour, and\r\nthe largest waves cause a sensation of red. The rainbow, in fact, is a\r\nsort of natural spectrum. (The meaning of the rainbow is that the\r\nmoisture-laden air has sorted out these waves, in the sun's light,\r\naccording to their length.) Now the simplest form of spectroscope is a\r\nglass prism--a triangular-shaped piece of glass. If white light\r\n(sunlight, for example) passes through a glass prism, we see a series of\r\nrainbow-tinted colours. Anyone can notice this effect when sunlight is\r\nshining through any kind of cut glass--the stopper of a wine decanter,\r\nfor instance. If, instead of catching with the eye the coloured lights\r\nas they emerge from the glass prism, we allow them to fall on a screen,\r\nwe shall find that they pass, by continuous gradations, from red at the\r\none end of the screen, through orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo,\r\nto violet at the other end. _In other words, what we call white light is\r\ncomposed of rays of these several colours. They go to make up the effect\r\nwhich we call white._ And now just as water can be split up into its two\r\nelements, oxygen and hydrogen, so sunlight can be broken up into its\r\nprimary colours, which are those we have just mentioned.\r\n\r\nThis range of colours, produced by the spectroscope, we call the solar\r\nspectrum, and these are, from the spectroscopic point of view, primary\r\ncolours. Each shade of colour has its definite position in the spectrum.\r\nThat is to say, the light of each shade of colour (corresponding to its\r\nwave-length) is reflected through a certain fixed angle on passing\r\nthrough the glass prism. Every possible kind of light has its definite\r\nposition, and is denoted by a number which gives the wave-length of the\r\nvibrations constituting that particular kind of light.\r\n\r\nNow, other kinds of light besides sunlight can be analysed. Light\r\nfrom any substance which has been made incandescent may be observed with\r\nthe spectroscope in the same way, and each element can be thus\r\nseparated. It is found that each substance (in the same conditions of\r\npressure, etc.) gives a constant spectrum of its own. _Each metal\r\ndisplays its own distinctive colour. It is obvious, therefore, that the\r\nspectrum provides the means for identifying a particular substance._ It\r\nwas by this method that we discovered in the sun the presence of such\r\nwell-known elements as sodium, iron, copper, zinc, and magnesium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Yerkes Observatory._\r\n\r\nFIG. 9.--THE GREAT SUN-SPOT OF JULY 17, 1905]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From photographs taken at the Yerkes Observatory._\r\n\r\nFIG. 10.--SOLAR PROMINENCES\r\n\r\nThese are about 60,000 miles in height.

E. Barnard, Yerkes Observatory._\r\n\r\nFIG. 13.--SATURN, November 19, 1911\r\n\r\nShowing the rings, mighty swarms of meteorites.]\r\n\r\nEvery chemical element known, then, has a distinctive spectrum of its\r\nown when it is raised to incandescence, and this distinctive spectrum is\r\nas reliable a means of identification for the element as a human face is\r\nfor its owner. Whether it is a substance glowing in the laboratory or in\r\na remote star makes no difference to the spectroscope; if the light of\r\nany substance reaches it, that substance will be recognised and\r\nidentified by the characteristic set of waves.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of a glowing mass of gas will consist in a number of bright\r\nlines of various colours, and at various intervals; corresponding to\r\neach kind of gas, there will be a peculiar and distinctive arrangement\r\nof bright lines. But if the light from such a mass of glowing gas be\r\nmade to pass through a cool mass of the _same_ gas it will be found that\r\ndark lines replace the bright lines in the spectrum, the reason for this\r\nbeing that the cool gas absorbs the rays of light emitted by the hot\r\ngas. Experiments of this kind enable us to reach the important general\r\nstatement that every gas, when cold, absorbs the same rays of light\r\nwhich it emits when hot.\r\n\r\nCrossing the solar spectrum are hundreds and hundreds of dark lines.\r\nThese could not at first be explained, because this fact of\r\ndiscriminative absorption was not known. We understand now. The sun's\r\nwhite light comes from the photosphere, but between us and the\r\nphotosphere there is, as we have seen, another solar envelope of\r\nrelatively cooler vapours--the reversing layer. Each constituent\r\nelement in this outer envelope stops its own kind of light, that is, the\r\nkind of light made by incandescent atoms of the same element in the\r\nphotosphere. The \"stoppages\" register themselves in the solar spectrum\r\nas dark lines placed exactly where the corresponding bright lines would\r\nhave been. The explanation once attained, dark lines became as\r\nsignificant as bright lines. The secret of the sun's composition was\r\nout. We have found practically every element in the sun that we know to\r\nbe in the earth. We have identified an element in the sun before we were\r\nable to isolate it on the earth. We have been able even to point to the\r\ncoolest places on the sun, the centres of sun-spots, where alone the\r\ntemperature seems to have fallen sufficiently low to allow chemical\r\ncompounds to form.\r\n\r\nIt is thus we have been able to determine what the stars, comets, or\r\nnebulæ are made of.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Unique Discovery\r\n\r\nIn 1868 Sir Norman Lockyer detected a light coming from the prominences\r\nof the sun which was not given by any substance known on earth, and\r\nattributed this to an unknown gas which he called helium, from the Greek\r\n_helios_, the sun. _In 1895 Sir William Ramsay discovered in certain\r\nminerals the same gas identified by the spectroscope._ We can say,\r\ntherefore, that this gas was discovered in the sun nearly thirty years\r\nbefore it was found on earth; this discovery of the long-lost heir is as\r\nthrilling a chapter in the detective story of science as any in the\r\nsensational stories of the day, and makes us feel quite certain that our\r\nmethods really tell us of what elements sun and stars are built up. The\r\nlight from the corona of the sun, as we have mentioned indicates a gas\r\nstill unknown on earth, which has been christened Coronium.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasuring the Speed of Light\r\n\r\nBut this is not all; soon a new use was found for the spectroscope. We\r\nfound that we could measure with it the most difficult of all speeds\r\nto measure, speed in the line of sight. Movement at right angles to the\r\ndirection in which one is looking is, if there is sufficient of it, easy\r\nto detect, and, if the distance of the moving body is known, easy to\r\nmeasure. But movement in the line of vision is both difficult to detect\r\nand difficult to measure. Yet, even at the enormous distances with which\r\nastronomers have to deal, the spectroscope can detect such movement and\r\nfurnish data for its measurement. If a luminous body containing, say,\r\nsodium is moving rapidly towards the spectroscope, it will be found that\r\nthe sodium lines in the spectrum have moved slightly from their usual\r\ndefinite positions towards the violet end of the spectrum, the amount of\r\nthe change of position increasing with the speed of the luminous body.\r\nIf the body is moving away from the spectroscope the shifting of the\r\nspectral lines will be in the opposite direction, towards the red end of\r\nthe spectrum. In this way we have discovered and measured movements that\r\notherwise would probably not have revealed themselves unmistakably to us\r\nfor thousands of years. In the same way we have watched, and measured\r\nthe speed of, tremendous movements on the sun, and so gained proof that\r\nthe vast disturbances we should expect there actually do occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPECTROSCOPE IS AN INSTRUMENT FOR ANALYSING LIGHT; IT\r\nPROVIDES THE MEANS FOR IDENTIFYING DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES\r\n\r\nThis pictorial diagram illustrates the principal of Spectrum Analysis,\r\nshowing how sunlight is decomposed into its primary colours. What we\r\ncall white light is composed of seven different colours. The diagram is\r\nrelieved of all detail which would unduly obscure the simple process by\r\nwhich a ray of light is broken up by a prism into different\r\nwave-lengths. The spectrum rays have been greatly magnified.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIS THE SUN DYING?\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nNow let us return to our consideration of the sun.\r\n\r\nTo us on the earth the most patent and most astonishing fact about the\r\nsun is its tremendous energy. Heat and light in amazing quantities pour\r\nfrom it without ceasing.\r\n\r\nWhere does this energy come from? Enormous jets of red glowing gases can\r\nbe seen shooting outwards from the sun, like flames from a fire, for\r\nthousands of miles. Does this argue fire, as we know fire on the earth?\r\nOn this point the scientist is sure. The sun is not burning, and\r\ncombustion is not the source of its heat. Combustion is a chemical\r\nreaction between atoms. The conditions that make it possible are known\r\nand the results are predictable and measurable. But no chemical reaction\r\nof the nature of combustion as we know it will explain the sun's energy,\r\nnor indeed will any ordinary chemical reaction of any kind. If the sun\r\nwere composed of combustible material throughout and the conditions of\r\ncombustion as we understand them were always present, the sun would burn\r\nitself out in some thousands of years, with marked changes in its heat\r\nand light production as the process advanced. There is no evidence of\r\nsuch changes. There is, instead, strong evidence that the sun has been\r\nemitting light and heat in prodigious quantities, not for thousands, but\r\nfor millions of years. Every addition to our knowledge that throws light\r\non the sun's age seems to make for increase rather than decrease of its\r\nyears. This makes the wonder of its energy greater.\r\n\r\nAnd we cannot avoid the issue of the source of the energy by saying\r\nmerely that the sun is gradually radiating away an energy that\r\noriginated in some unknown manner, away back at the beginning of things.\r\nReliable calculations show that the years required for the mere cooling\r\nof a globe like the sun could not possibly run to millions. In other\r\nwords, the sun's energy must be subject to continuous and more or less\r\nsteady renewal. However it may have acquired its enormous energy in the\r\npast, it must have some source of energy in the present.\r\n\r\nThe best explanation that we have to-day of this continuous accretion of\r\nenergy is that it is due to shrinkage of the sun's bulk under the force\r\nof gravity. Gravity is one of the most mysterious forces of nature, but\r\nit is an obvious fact that bodies behave as if they attracted one\r\nanother, and Newton worked out the law of this attraction. We may say,\r\nwithout trying to go too deeply into things, that every particle of\r\nmatter attracts every other throughout the universe. If the diameter of\r\nthe sun were to shrink by one mile all round, this would mean that all\r\nthe millions of tons in the outer one-mile thickness would have a\r\nstraight drop of one mile towards the centre. And that is not all,\r\nbecause obviously the layers below this outer mile would also drop\r\ninwards, each to a less degree than the one above it. What a tremendous\r\nmovement of matter, however slowly it might take place! And what a\r\ntremendous energy would be involved! Astronomers calculate that the\r\nabove shrinkage of one mile all round would require fifty years for its\r\ncompletion, assuming, reasonably, that there is close and continuous\r\nrelationship between loss of heat by radiation and shrinkage. Even if\r\nthis were true we need not feel over-anxious on this theory; before the\r\nsun became too cold to support life many millions of years would be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested at one time that falls of meteoric matter into the sun\r\nwould account for the sun's heat. This position is hardly tenable now.\r\nThe mere bulk of the meteoric matter required by the hypothesis, apart\r\nfrom other reasons, is against it. There is undoubtedly an enormous\r\namount of meteoric matter moving about within the bounds of the solar\r\nsystem, but most of it seems to be following definite routes round the\r\nsun like the planets. The stray erratic quantities destined to meet\r\ntheir doom by collision with the sun can hardly be sufficient to account\r\nfor the sun's heat.\r\n\r\nRecent study of radio-active bodies has suggested another factor that\r\nmay be working powerfully along with the force of gravitation to\r\nmaintain the sun's store of heat. In radio-active bodies certain atoms\r\nseem to be undergoing disintegration. These atoms appear to be splitting\r\nup into very minute and primitive constituents. But since matter may be\r\nsplit up into such constituents, may it not be built up from them?\r\n\r\nThe question is whether these \"radio-active\" elements are undergoing\r\ndisintegration, or formation, in the sun. If they are undergoing\r\ndisintegration--and the sun itself is undoubtedly radio-active--then we\r\nhave another source of heat for the sun that will last indefinitely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANETS\r\n\r\nLIFE IN OTHER WORLDS?\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that there cannot be life on the stars. Nothing solid\r\nor even liquid can exist in such furnaces as they are. Life exists only\r\non planets, and even on these its possibilities are limited. Whether all\r\nthe stars, or how many of them, have planetary families like our sun, we\r\ncannot positively say. If they have, such planets would be too faint and\r\nsmall to be visible tens of trillions of miles away. Some astronomers\r\nthink that our sun may be exceptional in having planets, but their\r\nreasons are speculative and unconvincing. Probably a large proportion at\r\nleast of the stars have planets, and we may therefore survey the globes\r\nof our own solar system and in a general way extend the results to the\r\nrest of the universe.\r\n\r\nIn considering the possibility of life as we know it we may at once rule\r\nout the most distant planets from the sun, Uranus and Neptune. They are\r\nprobably intrinsically too hot. We may also pass over the nearest planet\r\nto the sun, Mercury. We have reason to believe that it turns on its axis\r\nin the same period as it revolves round the sun, and it must therefore\r\nalways present the same side to the sun. This means that the heat on the\r\nsunlit side of Mercury is above boiling-point, while the cold on the\r\nother side must be between two and three hundred degrees below\r\nfreezing-point.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Planet Venus\r\n\r\nThe planet Venus, the bright globe which is known to all as the morning\r\nand evening \"star,\" seems at first sight more promising as regards the\r\npossibility of life. It is of nearly the same size as the earth, and it\r\nhas a good atmosphere, but there are many astronomers who believe that,\r\nlike Mercury, it always presents the same face to the sun, and it would\r\ntherefore have the same disadvantage--a broiling heat on the sunny side\r\nand the cold of space on the opposite side. We are not sure. The\r\nsurface of Venus is so bright--the light of the sun is reflected to us\r\nby such dense masses of cloud and dust--that it is difficult to trace\r\nany permanent markings on it, and thus ascertain how long it takes to\r\nrotate on its axis. Many astronomers believe that they have succeeded,\r\nand that the planet always turns the same face to the sun. If it does,\r\nwe can hardly conceive of life on its surface, in spite of the\r\ncloud-screen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--THE MOON\r\n\r\nShowing a great plain and some typical craters. There are thousands of\r\nthese craters, and some theories of their origin are explained on page\r\n34.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--MARS\r\n\r\n 1} Drawings by Prof. Lowell to accompany actual photographs of Mars\r\n     showing many of the\r\n 2} canals.

Now Mars is very much smaller than the earth, and must have\r\ncooled at its surface millions of years before the earth did. Hence, if\r\na story of life began on Mars at all, it began long before the story of\r\nlife on the earth. We cannot guess what sort of life-forms would be\r\nevolved in a different world, but we can confidently say that they would\r\ntend toward increasing intelligence; and thus we are disposed to look\r\nfor highly intelligent beings on Mars.\r\n\r\nBut this argument supposes that the conditions of life, namely air and\r\nwater, are found on Mars, and it is disputed whether they are found\r\nthere in sufficient quantity. The late Professor Percival Lowell, who\r\nmade a lifelong study of Mars, maintained that there are hundreds of\r\nstraight lines drawn across the surface of the planet, and he claimed\r\nthat they are beds of vegetation marking the sites of great channels or\r\npipes by means of which the \"Martians\" draw water from their polar\r\nocean. Professor W. H. Pickering, another high authority, thinks that\r\nthe lines are long, narrow marshes fed by moist winds from the poles.\r\nThere are certainly white polar caps on Mars. They seem to melt in the\r\nspring, and the dark fringe round them grows broader.\r\n\r\nOther astronomers, however, say that they find no trace of water-vapour\r\nin the atmosphere of Mars, and they think that the polar caps may be\r\nsimply thin sheets of hoar-frost or frozen gas. They point out that, as\r\nthe atmosphere of Mars is certainly scanty, and the distance from the\r\nsun is so great, it may be too cold for the fluid water to exist on the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nIf one asks why our wonderful instruments cannot settle these points,\r\none must be reminded that Mars is never nearer than 34,000,000 miles\r\nfrom the earth, and only approaches to this distance once in fifteen or\r\nseventeen years. The image of Mars on the photographic negative taken in\r\na big telescope is very small. Astronomers rely to a great extent on the\r\neye, which is more sensitive than the photographic plate. But it is easy\r\nto have differences of opinion as to what the eye sees, and so there is\r\na good deal of controversy.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1924, the planet will again be well placed for observation,\r\nand we may learn more about it. Already a few of the much-disputed\r\nlines, which people wrongly call \"canals,\" have been traced on\r\nphotographs. Astronomers who are sceptical about life on Mars are often\r\nnot fully aware of the extraordinary adaptability of life. There was a\r\ntime when the climate of the whole earth, from pole to pole, was\r\nsemi-tropical for millions of years. No animal could then endure the\r\nleast cold, yet now we have plenty of Arctic plants and animals. If the\r\ncold came slowly on Mars, as we have reason to suppose, the population\r\ncould be gradually adapted to it. On the whole, it is possible that\r\nthere is advanced life on Mars, and it is not impossible, in spite of\r\nthe very great difficulties of a code of communication, that our \"elder\r\nbrothers\" may yet flash across space the solution of many of our\r\nproblems.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nJupiter and Saturn\r\n\r\nNext to Mars, going outward from the sun, is Jupiter. Between Mars and\r\nJupiter, however, there are more than three hundred million miles of\r\nspace, and the older astronomers wondered why this was not occupied by a\r\nplanet. We now know that it contains about nine hundred \"planetoids,\" or\r\nsmall globes of from five to five hundred miles in diameter. It was at\r\none time thought that a planet might have burst into these fragments (a\r\ntheory which is not mathematically satisfactory), or it may be that the\r\nmaterial which is scattered in them was prevented by the nearness of the\r\ngreat bulk of Jupiter from uniting into one globe.\r\n\r\nFor Jupiter is a giant planet, and its gravitational influence must\r\nextend far over space. It is 1,300 times as large as the earth, and has\r\nnine moons, four of which are large, in attendance on it. It is\r\ninteresting to note that the outermost moons of Jupiter and Saturn\r\nrevolve round these planets in a direction contrary to the usual\r\ndirection taken by moons round planets, and by planets round the sun.\r\nBut there is no life on Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe surface which we see in photographs (Fig. 12) is a mass of cloud or\r\nsteam which always envelops the body of the planet. It is apparently\r\nred-hot. A red tinge is seen sometimes at the edges of its cloud-belts,\r\nand a large red region (the \"red spot\"), 23,000 miles in length, has\r\nbeen visible on it for half a century. There may be a liquid or solid\r\ncore to the planet, but as a whole it is a mass of seething vapours\r\nwhirling round on its axis once in every ten hours. As in the case of\r\nthe sun, however, different latitudes appear to rotate at different\r\nrates. The interior of Jupiter is very hot, but the planet is not\r\nself-luminous. The planets Venus and Jupiter shine very brightly, but\r\nthey have no light of their own; they reflect the sunlight.\r\n\r\nSaturn is in the same interesting condition. The surface in the\r\nphotograph (Fig. 13) is steam, and Saturn is so far away from the sun\r\nthat the vaporisation of its oceans must necessarily be due to its own\r\ninternal heat. It is too hot for water to settle on its surface. Like\r\nJupiter, the great globe turns on its axis once in ten hours--a\r\nprodigious speed--and must be a swirling, seething mass of metallic\r\nvapours and gases. It is instructive to compare Jupiter and Saturn in\r\nthis respect with the sun. They are smaller globes and have cooled down\r\nmore than the central fire.\r\n\r\nSaturn is a beautiful object in the telescope because it has ten moons\r\n(to include one which is disputed) and a wonderful system of \"rings\"\r\nround it. The so-called rings are a mighty swarm of meteorites--pieces\r\nof iron and stone of all sorts and sizes, which reflect the light of the\r\nsun to us. This ocean of matter is some miles deep, and stretches from a\r\nfew thousand miles from the surface of the planet to 172,000 miles out\r\nin space. Some astronomers think that this is volcanic material which\r\nhas been shot out of the planet. Others regard it as stuff which would\r\nhave combined to form an eleventh moon but was prevented by the nearness\r\nof Saturn itself. There is no evidence of life on Saturn.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOON\r\n\r\nMars and Venus are therefore the only planets, besides the earth, on\r\nwhich we may look for life; and in the case of Venus, the possibility is\r\nvery faint. But what about the moons which attend the planets? They\r\nrange in size from the little ten-miles-wide moons of Mars, to Titan, a\r\nmoon of Saturn, and Ganymede, a satellite of Jupiter, which are about\r\n3,000 miles in diameter. May there not be life on some of the larger of\r\nthese moons? We will take our own moon as a type of the class.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Dead World\r\n\r\nThe moon is so very much nearer to us than any other heavenly body that\r\nwe have a remarkable knowledge of it. In Fig. 14 you have a photograph,\r\ntaken in one of our largest telescopes, of part of its surface. In a\r\nsense such a telescope brings the moon to within about fifty miles of\r\nus. We should see a city like London as a dark, sprawling blotch on the\r\nglobe. We could just detect a Zeppelin or a Diplodocus as a moving speck\r\nagainst the surface. But we find none of these things. It is true that a\r\nfew astronomers believe that they see signs of some sort of feeble life\r\nor movement on the moon. Professor Pickering thinks that he can trace\r\nsome volcanic activity. He believes that there are areas of vegetation,\r\nprobably of a low order, and that the soil of the moon may retain a\r\ncertain amount of water in it. He speaks of a very thin atmosphere, and\r\nof occasional light falls of snow. He has succeeded in persuading some\r\ncareful observers that there probably are slight changes of some kind\r\ntaking place on the moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--A MAP OF THE CHIEF PLAINS AND CRATERS OF THE\r\nMOON\r\n\r\nThe plains were originally supposed to be seas: hence the name \"Mare.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--A DIAGRAM OF A STREAM OF METEORS SHOWING THE\r\nEARTH PASSING THROUGH THEM] [Illustration: _Photo: Royal Observatory,\r\nGreenwich._\r\n\r\nFIG. 19.--COMET, September 29, 1908\r\n\r\nNotice the tendency to form a number of tails. (See photograph below.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Royal Observatory, Greenwich._\r\n\r\nFIG. 20.--COMET, October 3, 1908\r\n\r\nThe process has gone further and a number of distinct tails can now be\r\ncounted.]\r\n\r\nBut there are many things that point to absence of air on the moon. Even\r\nthe photographs we reproduce tell the same story. The edges of the\r\nshadows are all hard and black. If there had been an appreciable\r\natmosphere it would have scattered the sun's light on to the edges and\r\nproduced a gradual shading off such as we see on the earth. This\r\nrelative absence of air must give rise to some surprising effects. There\r\nwill be no sounds on the moon, because sounds are merely air waves. Even\r\na meteor shattering itself to a violent end against the surface of the\r\nmoon would make no noise. Nor would it herald its coming by glowing into\r\na \"shooting star,\" as it would on entering the earth's atmosphere. There\r\nwill be no floating dust, no scent, no twilight, no blue sky, no\r\ntwinkling of the stars. The sky will be always black and the stars will\r\nbe clearly visible by day as by night. The sun's wonderful corona, which\r\nno man on earth, even by seizing every opportunity during eclipses, can\r\nhope to see for more than two hours in all in a long lifetime, will be\r\nvisible all day. So will the great red flames of the sun. Of course,\r\nthere will be no life, and no landscape effects and scenery effects due\r\nto vegetation.\r\n\r\nThe moon takes approximately twenty-seven of our days to turn once on\r\nits axis. So for fourteen days there is continuous night, when the\r\ntemperature must sink away down towards the absolute cold of space. This\r\nwill be followed without an instant of twilight by full daylight. For\r\nanother fourteen days the sun's rays will bear straight down, with no\r\ndiffusion or absorption of their heat, or light, on the way. It does not\r\nfollow, however, that the temperature of the moon's surface must rise\r\nenormously. It may not even rise to the temperature of melting ice.\r\nSeeing there is no air there can be no check on radiation. The heat that\r\nthe moon gets will radiate away immediately. We know that amongst the\r\ncoldest places on the earth are the tops of very high mountains, the\r\npoints that have reared themselves nearest to the sun but farthest out\r\nof the sheltering blanket of the earth's atmosphere. The actual\r\ntemperature of the moon's surface by day is a moot point. It may be\r\nbelow the freezing-point or above the boiling-point of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mountains of the Moon\r\n\r\nThe lack of air is considered by many astronomers to furnish the\r\nexplanation of the enormous number of \"craters\" which pit the moon's\r\nsurface. There are about a hundred thousand of these strange rings, and\r\nit is now believed by many that they are spots where very large\r\nmeteorites, or even planetoids, splashed into the moon when its surface\r\nwas still soft. Other astronomers think that they are the remains of\r\ngigantic bubbles which were raised in the moon's \"skin,\" when the globe\r\nwas still molten, by volcanic gases from below. A few astronomers think\r\nthat they are, as is popularly supposed, the craters of extinct\r\nvolcanoes. Our craters, on the earth, are generally deep cups, whereas\r\nthese ring-formations on the moon are more like very shallow and broad\r\nsaucers. Clavius, the largest of them, is 123 miles across the interior,\r\nyet its encircling rampart is not a mile high.\r\n\r\nThe mountains on the moon (Fig. 16) rise to a great height, and are\r\nextraordinarily gaunt and rugged. They are like fountains of lava,\r\nrising in places to 26,000 and 27,000 feet. The lunar Apennines have\r\nthree thousand steep and weird peaks. Our terrestrial mountains are\r\ncontinually worn down by frost acting on moisture and by ice and water,\r\nbut there are none of these agencies operating on the moon. Its\r\nmountains are comparatively \"everlasting hills.\"\r\n\r\nThe moon is interesting to us precisely because it is a dead world. It\r\nseems to show how the earth, or any cooling metal globe, will evolve in\r\nthe remote future. We do not know if there was ever life on the moon,\r\nbut in any case it cannot have proceeded far in development. At the most\r\nwe can imagine some strange lowly forms of vegetation lingering here and\r\nthere in pools of heavy gas, expanding during the blaze of the sun's\r\nlong day, and frozen rigid during the long night.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEORS AND COMETS\r\n\r\nWe may conclude our survey of the solar system with a word about\r\n\"shooting stars,\" or meteors, and comets. There are few now who do not\r\nknow that the streak of fire which suddenly lights the sky overhead at\r\nnight means that a piece of stone or iron has entered our atmosphere\r\nfrom outer space, and has been burned up by friction. It was travelling\r\nat, perhaps, twenty or thirty miles a second. At seventy or eighty miles\r\nabove our heads it began to glow, as at that height the air is thick\r\nenough to offer serious friction and raise it to a white heat. By the\r\ntime the meteor reached about twenty miles or so from the earth's\r\nsurface it was entirely dissipated, as a rule in fiery vapour.\r\n\r\n\r\nMillions of Meteorites\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that between ten and a hundred million meteorites enter\r\nour atmosphere and are cremated, every day. Most of them weigh only an\r\nounce or two, and are invisible. Some of them weigh a ton or more, but\r\neven against these large masses the air acts as a kind of \"torpedo-net.\"\r\nThey generally burst into fragments and fall without doing damage.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that \"empty space\" is, at least within the limits of our\r\nsolar system, full of these things. They swarm like fishes in the seas.\r\nLike the fishes, moreover, they may be either solitary or gregarious.\r\nThe solitary bit of cosmic rubbish is the meteorite, which we have just\r\nexamined. A \"social\" group of meteorites is the essential part of a\r\ncomet. The nucleus, or bright central part, of the head of a comet (Fig.\r\n19) consists of a swarm, sometimes thousands of miles wide, of these\r\npieces of iron or stone. This swarm has come under the sun's\r\ngravitational influence, and is forced to travel round it. From some\r\ndark region of space it has moved slowly into our system. It is not then\r\na comet, for it has no tail. But as the crowded meteors approach the\r\nsun, the speed increases. They give off fine vapour-like matter and the\r\nfierce flood of light from the sun sweeps this vapour out in an\r\never-lengthening tail. Whatever way the comet is travelling, the tail\r\nalways points away from the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Great Comet\r\n\r\nThe vapoury tail often grows to an enormous length as the comet\r\napproaches the sun. The great comet of 1843 had a tail two hundred\r\nmillion miles long. It is, however, composed of the thinnest vapours\r\nimaginable. Twice during the nineteenth century the earth passed through\r\nthe tail of a comet, and nothing was felt. The vapours of the tail are,\r\nin fact, so attenuated that we can hardly imagine them to be white-hot.\r\nThey may be lit by some electrical force. However that may be, the comet\r\ndashes round the sun, often at three or four hundred miles a second,\r\nthen may pass gradually out of our system once more. It may be a\r\nthousand years, or it may be fifty years, before the monarch of the\r\nsystem will summon it again to make its fiery journey round his throne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Harvard College Observatory._\r\n\r\nFIG. 21.--TYPICAL SPECTRA\r\n\r\nSix main types of stellar spectra.

The sun is nothing more than a very ordinary star, perhaps\r\nan insignificant one. There are stars enormously greater than the sun.\r\nOne such, Betelgeux, has recently been measured, and its diameter is\r\nmore than 300 times that of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Evolution of Stars\r\n\r\nThe proof of the similarity between our sun and the stars has come to us\r\nthrough the spectroscope. The elements that we find by its means in the\r\nsun are also found in the same way in the stars. Matter, says the\r\nspectroscope, is essentially the same everywhere, in the earth and the\r\nsun, in the comet that visits us once in a thousand years, in the star\r\nwhose distance is incalculable, and in the great clouds of \"fire-mist\"\r\nthat we call nebulæ.\r\n\r\nIn considering the evolution of the stars let us keep two points clearly\r\nin mind. The starting-point, the nebula, is no figment of the scientific\r\nimagination. Hundreds of thousands of nebulæ, besides even vaster\r\nirregular stretches of nebulous matter, exist in the heavens. But the\r\nstages of the evolution of this stuff into stars are very largely a\r\nmatter of speculation. Possibly there is more than one line of\r\nevolution, and the various theories may be reconciled. And this applies\r\nalso to the theories of the various stages through which the stars\r\nthemselves pass on their way to extinction.\r\n\r\nThe light of about a quarter of a million stars has been analysed in the\r\nspectroscope, and it is found that they fall into about a dozen classes\r\nwhich generally correspond to stages in their evolution (Fig. 21).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Age of Stars\r\n\r\nIn its main lines the spectrum of a star corresponds to its colour, and\r\nwe may roughly group the stars into red, yellow, and white. This is also\r\nthe order of increasing temperature, the red stars being the coolest and\r\nthe white stars the hottest. We might therefore imagine that the white\r\nstars are the youngest, and that as they grow older and cooler they\r\nbecome yellowish, then red, and finally become invisible--just as a\r\ncooling white-hot iron would do. But a very interesting recent research\r\nshows that there are two kinds of red stars; some of them are amongst\r\nthe oldest stars and some are amongst the youngest. The facts appear to\r\nbe that when a star is first formed it is not very hot. It is an immense\r\nmass of diffuse gas glowing with a dull-red heat. It contracts under the\r\nmutual gravitation of its particles, and as it does so it grows hotter.\r\nIt acquires a yellowish tinge. As it continues to contract it grows\r\nhotter and hotter until its temperature reaches a maximum as a white\r\nstar. At this point the contraction process does not stop, but the\r\nheating process does. Further contraction is now accompanied by cooling,\r\nand the star goes through its colour changes again, but this time in the\r\ninverse order. It contracts and cools to yellow and finally to red. But\r\nwhen it again becomes a red star it is enormously denser and smaller\r\nthan when it began as a red star. Consequently the red stars are divided\r\ninto two classes called, appropriately, Giants and Dwarfs. This theory,\r\nwhich we owe to an American astronomer, H. N. Russell, has been\r\nsuccessful in explaining a variety of phenomena, and there is\r\nconsequently good reason to suppose it to be true. But the question as\r\nto how the red giant stars were formed has received less satisfactory\r\nand precise answers.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly accepted theory is the nebular theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEBULAR THEORY\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nNebulæ are dim luminous cloud-like patches in the heavens, more like\r\nwisps of smoke in some cases than anything else. Both photography and\r\nthe telescope show that they are very numerous, hundreds of thousands\r\nbeing already known and the number being continually added to. They are\r\nnot small. Most of them are immensely large. Actual dimensions cannot be\r\ngiven, because to estimate these we must first know definitely the\r\ndistance of the nebulæ from the earth. The distances of some nebulæ are\r\nknown approximately, and we can therefore form some idea of size in\r\nthese cases. The results are staggering. The mere visible surface of\r\nsome nebulæ is so large that the whole stretch of the solar system would\r\nbe too small to form a convenient unit for measuring it. A ray of light\r\nwould require to travel for years to cross from side to side of such a\r\nnebula. Its immensity is inconceivable to the human mind.\r\n\r\nThere appear to be two types of nebulæ, and there is evidence suggesting\r\nthat the one type is only an earlier form of the other; but this again\r\nwe do not know.\r\n\r\nThe more primitive nebulæ would seem to be composed of gas in an\r\nextremely rarified form. It is difficult to convey an adequate idea of\r\nthe rarity of nebular gases. The residual gases in a vacuum tube are\r\ndense by comparison. A cubic inch of air at ordinary pressure would\r\ncontain more matter than is contained in millions of cubic inches of the\r\ngases of nebulæ. The light of even the faintest stars does not seem to\r\nbe dimmed by passing through a gaseous nebula, although we cannot be\r\nsure on this point. The most remarkable physical fact about these gases\r\nis that they are luminous. Whence they derive their luminosity we do not\r\nknow. It hardly seems possible to believe that extremely thin gases\r\nexposed to the terrific cold of space can be so hot as to be luminous\r\nand can retain their heat and their luminosity indefinitely. A cold\r\nluminosity due to electrification, like that of the aurora borealis,\r\nwould seem to fit the case better.\r\n\r\nNow the nebular theory is that out of great \"fire-mists,\" such as we\r\nhave described, stars are born. We do not know whether gravitation is\r\nthe only or even the main force at work in a nebula, but it is supposed\r\nthat under the action of gravity the far-flung \"fire-mists\" would begin\r\nto condense round centres of greatest density, heat being evolved in the\r\nprocess. Of course the condensation would be enormously slow, although\r\nthe sudden irruption of a swarm of meteors or some solid body might\r\nhasten matters greatly by providing large, ready-made centres of\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpiral Nebulæ\r\n\r\nIt is then supposed that the contracting mass of gas would begin to\r\nrotate and to throw off gigantic streamers, which would in their turn\r\nform centres of condensation. The whole structure would thus form a\r\nspiral, having a dense region at its centre and knots or lumps of\r\ncondensed matter along its spiral arms. Besides the formless gaseous\r\nnebulæ there are hundreds of thousands of \"spiral\" nebulæ such as we\r\nhave just mentioned in the heavens. They are at all stages of\r\ndevelopment, and they are visible to us at all angles--that is to say,\r\nsome of them face directly towards us, others are edge on, and some are\r\nin intermediate positions. It appears, therefore, that we have here a\r\nstriking confirmation of the nebular hypothesis. But we must not go so\r\nfast. There is much controversy as to the nature of these spiral nebulæ.\r\nSome eminent astronomers think they are other stellar universes,\r\ncomparable in size with our own. In any case they are vast structures,\r\nand if they represent stars in process of condensation, they must be\r\ngiving birth to huge agglomerations of stars--to star clusters at least.\r\nThese vast and enigmatic objects do not throw much light on the origin\r\nof our own solar system. The nebular hypothesis, which was invented\r\nby Laplace to explain the origin of our solar system, has not yet met\r\nwith universal acceptance. The explanation offers grave difficulties,\r\nand it is best while the subject is still being closely investigated, to\r\nhold all opinions with reserve. It may be taken as probable, however,\r\nthat the universe has developed from masses of incandescent gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Yerkes Observatory._\r\n\r\nFIG. 24.--THE GREAT NEBULA IN ORION\r\n\r\nThe most impressive nebula in the heavens.

In\r\neither case we should get two streams in opposite directions within the\r\nnucleus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIRTH AND DEATH OF STARS\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nVariable, New, and Dark Stars: Dying Suns\r\n\r\nMany astronomers believe that in \"variable stars\" we have another star,\r\nfollowing that of the dullest red star, in the dying of suns. The light\r\nof these stars varies periodically in so many days, weeks, or years. It\r\nis interesting to speculate that they are slowly dying suns, in which\r\nthe molten interior periodically bursts through the shell of thick\r\nvapours that is gathering round them. What we saw about our sun seems to\r\npoint to some such stage in the future. That is, however, not the\r\nreceived opinion about variable stars. It may be that they are stars\r\nwhich periodically pass through a great swarm of meteors or a region of\r\nspace that is rich in cosmic dust of some sort, when, of course, a great\r\nillumination would take place.\r\n\r\nOne class of these variable stars, which takes its name from the star\r\nAlgol, is of special interest. Every third night Algol has its light\r\nreduced for several hours. Modern astronomy has discovered that in this\r\ncase there are really two stars, circulating round a common centre, and\r\nthat every third night the fainter of the two comes directly between us\r\nand its companion and causes an \"eclipse.\" This was until recently\r\nregarded as a most interesting case in which a dead star revealed itself\r\nto us by passing before the light of another star. But astronomers have\r\nin recent years invented something, the \"selenium-cell,\" which is even\r\nmore sensitive than the photographic plate, and on this the supposed\r\ndead star registers itself as very much alive. Algol is, however,\r\ninteresting in another way. The pair of stars which we have discovered\r\nin it are hundreds of trillions of miles away from the earth, yet we\r\nknow their masses and their distances from each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death and Birth of Stars\r\n\r\nWe have no positive knowledge of dead stars; which is not surprising\r\nwhen we reflect that a dead star means an invisible star! But when we\r\nsee so many individual stars tending toward death, when we behold a vast\r\npopulation of all conceivable ages, we presume that there are many\r\nalready dead. On the other hand, there is no reason to suppose that the\r\nuniverse as a whole is \"running down.\" Some writers have maintained\r\nthis, but their argument implies that we know a great deal more about\r\nthe universe than we actually do. The scientific man does not know\r\nwhether the universe is finite or infinite, temporal or eternal; and he\r\ndeclines to speculate where there are no facts to guide him. He knows\r\nonly that the great gaseous nebulæ promise myriads of worlds in the\r\nfuture, and he concedes the possibility that new nebulæ may be forming\r\nin the ether of space.\r\n\r\nThe last, and not the least interesting, subject we have to notice is\r\nthe birth of a \"new star.\" This is an event which astronomers now\r\nannounce every few years; and it is a far more portentous event than the\r\nreader imagines when it is reported in his daily paper. The story is\r\nmuch the same in all cases. We say that the star appeared in 1901, but\r\nyou begin to realise the magnitude of the event when you learn that the\r\ndistant \"blaze\" had really occurred about the time of the death of\r\nLuther! The light of the conflagration had been speeding toward us\r\nacross space at 186,000 miles a second, yet it has taken nearly three\r\ncenturies to reach us. To be visible at all to us at that distance the\r\nfiery outbreak must have been stupendous. If a mass of petroleum ten\r\ntimes the size of the earth were suddenly fired it would not be seen at\r\nsuch a distance. The new star had increased its light many hundredfold\r\nin a few days.\r\n\r\nThere is a considerable fascination about the speculation that in such\r\ncases we see the resurrection of a dead world, a means of renewing the\r\npopulation of the universe. What happens is that in some region of the\r\nsky where no star, or only a very faint star, had been registered on our\r\ncharts, we almost suddenly perceive a bright star. In a few days it may\r\nrise to the highest brilliancy. By the spectroscope we learn that this\r\ndistant blaze means a prodigious outpour of white-hot hydrogen at\r\nhundreds of miles a second. But the star sinks again after a few months,\r\nand we then find a nebula round it on every side. It is natural to\r\nsuppose that a dead or dying sun has somehow been reconverted in whole\r\nor in part into a nebula. A few astronomers think that it may have\r\npartially collided with another star, or approached too closely to\r\nanother, with the result we described on an earlier page. The general\r\nopinion now is that a faint or dead star had rushed into one of those\r\nregions of space in which there are immense stretches of nebulous\r\nmatter, and been (at least in part) vaporised by the friction.\r\n\r\nBut the difficulties are considerable, and some astronomers prefer to\r\nthink that the blazing star may merely have lit up a dark nebula which\r\nalready existed. It is one of those problems on which speculation is\r\nmost tempting but positive knowledge is still very incomplete. We may be\r\ncontent, even proud, that already we can take a conflagration that has\r\noccurred more than a thousand trillion miles away and analyse it\r\npositively into an outflame of glowing hydrogen gas at so many miles a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHAPE OF OUR UNIVERSE\r\n\r\n§ 4\r\n\r\nOur Universe a Spiral Nebula\r\n\r\nWhat is the shape of our universe, and what are its dimensions? This is\r\na tremendous question to ask. It is like asking an intelligent insect,\r\nliving on a single leaf in the midst of a great Brazilian forest, to say\r\nwhat is the shape and size of the forest. Yet man's ingenuity has proved\r\nequal to giving an answer even to this question, and by a method exactly\r\nsimilar to that which would be adopted by the insect. Suppose, for\r\ninstance, that the forest was shaped as an elongated oval, and the\r\ninsect lived on a tree near the centre of the oval. If the trees were\r\napproximately equally spaced from one another they would appear much\r\ndenser along the length of the oval than across its width. This is the\r\nsimple consideration that has guided astronomers in determining the\r\nshape of our stellar universe. There is one direction in the heavens\r\nalong which the stars appear denser than in the directions at right\r\nangles to it. That direction is the direction in which we look towards\r\nthe Milky Way. If we count the number of stars visible all over the\r\nheavens, we find they become more and more numerous as we approach the\r\nMilky Way. As we go farther and farther from the Milky Way the stars\r\nthin out until they reach a maximum sparseness in directions at right\r\nangles to the plane of the Milky Way. We may consider the Milky Way to\r\nform, as it were, the equator of our system, and the line at right\r\nangles to point to the north and south poles.\r\n\r\nOur system, in fact, is shaped something like a lens, and our sun is\r\nsituated near the centre of this lens. In the remoter part of this lens,\r\nnear its edge, or possibly outside it altogether, lies the great series\r\nof star clouds which make up the Milky Way. All the stars are in motion\r\nwithin this system, but the very remarkable discovery has been made that\r\nthese motions are not entirely random. The great majority of the stars\r\nwhose motions can be measured fall into two groups drifting past one\r\nanother in opposite directions. The velocity of one stream relative to\r\nthe other is about twenty-five miles per second. The stars forming these\r\ntwo groups are thoroughly well mixed; it is not a case of an inner\r\nstream going one way and an outer stream the other. But there are not\r\nquite as many stars going one way as the other. For every two stars in\r\none stream there are three in the other. Now, as we have said, some\r\neminent astronomers hold that the spiral nebulæ are universes like our\r\nown, and if we look at the two photographs (Figs. 25 and 26) we see that\r\nthese spirals present features which, in the light of what we have just\r\nsaid about our system, are very remarkable. The nebula in Coma Berenices\r\nis a spiral edge-on to us, and we see that it has precisely the\r\nlens-shaped middle and the general flattened shape that we have found in\r\nour own system. The nebula in Canes Venatici is a spiral facing towards\r\nus, and its shape irresistibly suggests motions along the spiral arms.\r\nThis motion, whether it is towards or away from the central, lens-shaped\r\nportion, would cause a double streaming motion in that central portion\r\nof the kind we have found in our own system. Again, and altogether apart\r\nfrom these considerations, there are good reasons for supposing our\r\nMilky Way to possess a double-armed spiral structure. And the great\r\npatches of dark absorbing matter which are known to exist in the Milky\r\nWay (see Fig. 22) would give very much the mottled appearance we notice\r\nin the arms (which we see edge-on) of the nebula in Coma Berenices. The\r\nhypothesis, therefore, that our universe is a spiral nebula has much to\r\nbe said for it. If it be accepted it greatly increases our estimate of\r\nthe size of the material universe. For our central, lens-shaped system\r\nis calculated to extend towards the Milky Way for more than twenty\r\nthousand times a million million miles, and about a third of this\r\ndistance towards what we have called the poles. If, as we suppose, each\r\nspiral nebula is an independent stellar universe comparable in size with\r\nour own, then, since there are hundreds of thousands of spiral nebulæ,\r\nwe see that the size of the whole material universe is indeed beyond our\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Mount Wilson Observatory._\r\n\r\nFIG. 26.--A SPIRAL NEBULA SEEN EDGE-ON\r\n\r\nNotice the lens-shaped formation of the nucleus and the arm stretching\r\nas a band across it.

Many of these\r\nquestions have not yet passed the controversial stage; out of these will\r\nemerge the astronomy of the future. But we have seen enough to convince\r\nus that, whatever advances the future holds in store, the science of the\r\nheavens constitutes one of the most important stones in the wonderful\r\nfabric of human knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nThe Telescope\r\n\r\nThe instruments used in modern astronomy are amongst the finest triumphs\r\nof mechanical skill in the world. In a great modern observatory the\r\ndifferent instruments are to be counted by the score, but there are two\r\nwhich stand out pre-eminent as the fundamental instruments of modern\r\nastronomy. These instruments are the telescope and the spectroscope, and\r\nwithout them astronomy, as we know it, could not exist.\r\n\r\nThere is still some dispute as to where and when the first telescope was\r\nconstructed; as an astronomical instrument, however, it dates from the\r\ntime of the great Italian scientist Galileo, who, with a very small and\r\nimperfect telescope of his own invention, first observed the spots on\r\nthe sun, the mountains of the moon, and the chief four satellites of\r\nJupiter. A good pair of modern binoculars is superior to this early\r\ninstrument of Galileo's, and the history of telescope construction, from\r\nthat primitive instrument to the modern giant recently erected on Mount\r\nWilson, California, is an exciting chapter in human progress. But the\r\nearly instruments have only an historic interest: the era of modern\r\ntelescopes begins in the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nDuring the last century telescope construction underwent an\r\nunprecedented development. An immense amount of interest was taken in\r\nthe construction of large telescopes, and the different countries of the\r\nworld entered on an exciting race to produce the most powerful possible\r\ninstruments. Besides this rivalry of different countries there was a\r\nrivalry of methods. The telescope developed along two different lines,\r\nand each of these two types has its partisans at the present day. These\r\ntypes are known as _refractors_ and _reflectors_, and it is necessary to\r\nmention, briefly, the principles employed in each. The _refractor_ is\r\nthe ordinary, familiar type of telescope. It consists, essentially, of a\r\nlarge lens at one end of a tube, and a small lens, called the eye-piece,\r\nat the other. The function of the large lens is to act as a sort of\r\ngigantic eye. It collects a large amount of light, an amount\r\nproportional to its size, and brings this light to a focus within the\r\ntube of the telescope. It thus produces a small but bright image, and\r\nthe eye-piece magnifies this image. In the _reflector_, instead of a\r\nlarge lens at the top of the tube, a large mirror is placed at the\r\nbottom. This mirror is so shaped as to reflect the light that falls on\r\nit to a focus, whence the light is again led to an eye-piece. Thus the\r\nrefractor and the reflector differ chiefly in their manner of gathering\r\nlight. The powerfulness of the telescope depends on the size of the\r\nlight-gatherer. A telescope with a lens four inches in diameter is four\r\ntimes as powerful as the one with a lens two inches in diameter, for the\r\namount of light gathered obviously depends on the _area_ of the lens,\r\nand the area varies as the _square_ of the diameter.\r\n\r\nThe largest telescopes at present in existence are _reflectors_. It is\r\nmuch easier to construct a very large mirror than to construct a very\r\nlarge lens; it is also cheaper. A mirror is more likely to get out of\r\norder than is a lens, however, and any irregularity in the shape of a\r\nmirror produces a greater distorting effect than in a lens. A refractor\r\nis also more convenient to handle than is a reflector. For these reasons\r\ngreat refractors are still made, but the largest of them, the great\r\nYerkes' refractor, is much smaller than the greatest reflector, the one\r\non Mount Wilson, California. The lens of the Yerkes' refractor measures\r\nthree feet four inches in diameter, whereas the Mount Wilson reflector\r\nhas a diameter of no less than eight feet four inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE YERKES 40-INCH REFRACTOR\r\n\r\n(The largest _refracting_ telescope in the world. Its big lens weighs\r\n1,000 pounds, and its mammoth tube, which is 62 feet long, weighs about\r\n12,000 pounds. The parts to be moved weigh approximately 22 tons.\r\n\r\nThe great _100-inch reflector_ of the Mount Wilson reflecting\r\ntelescope--the largest _reflecting_ instrument in the world--weighs\r\nnearly 9,000 pounds and the moving parts of the telescope weigh about\r\n100 tons.\r\n\r\nThe new _72-inch reflector_ at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory,\r\nnear Victoria, B. C., weighs nearly 4,500 pounds, and the moving parts\r\nabout 35 tons.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: H. J. Shepstone._\r\n\r\nTHE DOUBLE-SLIDE PLATE HOLDER ON YERKES 40-INCH REFRACTING TELESCOPE\r\n\r\nThe smaller telescope at the top of the picture acts as a \"finder\"; the\r\nfield of view of the large telescope is so restricted that it is\r\ndifficult to recognise, as it were, the part of the heavens being\r\nsurveyed. The smaller telescope takes in a larger area and enables the\r\nprecise object to be examined to be easily selected.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODERN DIRECT-READING SPECTROSCOPE\r\n\r\n(_By A. Hilger, Ltd._)\r\n\r\nThe light is brought through one telescope, is split up by the prism,\r\nand the resulting spectrum is observed through the other telescope.]\r\n\r\nBut there is a device whereby the power of these giant instruments,\r\ngreat as it is, can be still further heightened. That device is the\r\nsimple one of allowing the photographic plate to take the place of the\r\nhuman eye. Nowadays an astronomer seldom spends the night with his eye\r\nglued to the great telescope. He puts a photographic plate there. The\r\nphotographic plate has this advantage over the eye, that it builds up\r\nimpressions. However long we stare at an object too faint to be seen, we\r\nshall never see it. With the photographic plate, however, faint\r\nimpressions go on accumulating. As hour after hour passes, the star\r\nwhich was too faint to make a perceptible impression on the plate goes\r\non affecting it until finally it makes an impression which can be made\r\nvisible. In this way the photographic plate reveals to us phenomena in\r\nthe heavens which cannot be seen even through the most powerful\r\ntelescopes.\r\n\r\nTelescopes of the kind we have been discussing, telescopes for exploring\r\nthe heavens, are mounted _equatorially_; that is to say, they are\r\nmounted on an inclined pillar parallel to the axis of the earth so that,\r\nby rotating round this pillar, the telescope is enabled to follow the\r\napparent motion of a star due to the rotation of the earth. This motion\r\nis effected by clock-work, so that, once adjusted on a star, and the\r\nclock-work started, the telescope remains adjusted on that star for any\r\nlength of time that is desired. But a great official observatory, such\r\nas Greenwich Observatory or the Observatory at Paris, also has _transit_\r\ninstruments, or telescopes smaller than the equatorials and without the\r\nsame facility of movement, but which, by a number of exquisite\r\nrefinements, are more adapted to accurate measurements. It is these\r\ninstruments which are chiefly used in the compilation of the _Nautical\r\nAlmanac_. They do not follow the apparent motions of the stars. Stars\r\nare allowed to drift across the field of vision, and as each star\r\ncrosses a small group of parallel wires in the eye-piece its precise\r\ntime of passage is recorded. Owing to their relative fixity of position\r\nthese instruments can be constructed to record the _positions_ of stars\r\nwith much greater accuracy than is possible to the more general and\r\nflexible mounting of equatorials. The recording of transit is\r\ncomparatively dry work; the spectacular element is entirely absent;\r\nstars are treated merely as mathematical points. But these observations\r\nfurnish the very basis of modern mathematical astronomy, and without\r\nthem such publications as the _Nautical Almanac_ and the _Connaissance\r\ndu Temps_ would be robbed of the greater part of their importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nThe Spectroscope\r\n\r\nWe have already learnt something of the principles of the spectroscope,\r\nthe instrument which, by making it possible to learn the actual\r\nconstitution of the stars, has added a vast new domain to astronomy. In\r\nthe simplest form of this instrument the analysing portion consists of a\r\nsingle prism. Unless the prism is very large, however, only a small\r\ndegree of dispersion is obtained. It is obviously desirable, for\r\naccurate analytical work, that the dispersion--that is, the separation\r\nof the different parts of the spectrum--should be as great as possible.\r\nThe dispersion can be increased by using a large number of prisms, the\r\nlight emerging from the first prism, entering the second, and so on. In\r\nthis way each prism produces its own dispersive effect and, when a\r\nnumber of prisms are employed, the final dispersion is considerable. A\r\nconsiderable amount of light is absorbed in this way, however, so that\r\nunless our primary source of light is very strong, the final spectrum\r\nwill be very feeble and hard to decipher.\r\n\r\nAnother way of obtaining considerable dispersion is by using a\r\n_diffraction grating_ instead of a prism. This consists essentially of a\r\npiece of glass on which lines are ruled by a diamond point. When the\r\nlines are sufficiently close together they split up light falling on\r\nthem into its constituents and produce a spectrum. The modern\r\ndiffraction grating is a truly wonderful piece of work. It contains\r\nseveral thousands of lines to the inch, and these lines have to be\r\nspaced with the greatest accuracy. But in this instrument, again, there\r\nis a considerable loss of light.\r\n\r\nWe have said that every substance has its own distinctive spectrum, and\r\nit might be thought that, when a list of the spectra of different\r\nsubstances has been prepared, spectrum analysis would become perfectly\r\nstraightforward. In practice, however, things are not quite so simple.\r\nThe spectrum emitted by a substance is influenced by a variety of\r\nconditions. The pressure, the temperature, the state of motion of the\r\nobject we are observing, all make a difference, and one of the most\r\nlaborious tasks of the modern spectroscopist is to disentangle these\r\neffects from one another. Simple as it is in its broad outlines,\r\nspectroscopy is, in reality, one of the most intricate branches of\r\nmodern science.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n(The following list of books may be useful to readers wishing to pursue\r\nfurther the study of Astronomy.)\r\n\r\n BALL, _The Story of the Heavens_.\r\n BALL, _The Story of the Sun_.\r\n FORBES, _History of Astronomy_.\r\n HINCKS, _Astronomy_.\r\n KIPPAX, _Call of the Stars_.\r\n LOWELL, _Mars and Its Canals_.\r\n LOWELL, _Evolution of Worlds_.\r\n MCKREADY, _A Beginner's Star-Book_.\r\n NEWCOMB, _Popular Astronomy_.\r\n NEWCOMB, _The Stars: A Study of the Universe_.\r\n OLCOTT, _Field Book of the Stars_.\r\n PRICE, _Essence of Astronomy_.\r\n SERVISS, _Curiosities of the Skies_.\r\n WEBB, _Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes_.\r\n YOUNG, _Text-Book of General Astronomy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF EVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE EARTH--MAKING A HOME FOR LIFE--THE FIRST LIVING\r\nCREATURES\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nThe Evolution-idea is a master-key that opens many doors. It is a\r\nluminous interpretation of the world, throwing the light of the past\r\nupon the present. Everything is seen to be an antiquity, with a history\r\nbehind it--a _natural history_, which enables us to understand in some\r\nmeasure how it has come to be as it is. We cannot say more than\r\n\"understand in some measure,\" for while the _fact_ of evolution is\r\ncertain, we are only beginning to discern the _factors_ that have been\r\nat work.\r\n\r\nThe evolution-idea is very old, going back to some of the Greek\r\nphilosophers, but it is only in modern times that it has become an\r\nessential part of our mental equipment. It is now an everyday\r\nintellectual tool. It was applied to the origin of the solar system and\r\nto the making of the earth before it was applied to plants and animals;\r\nit was extended from these to man himself; it spread to language, to\r\nfolk-ways, to institutions. Within recent years the evolution-idea has\r\nbeen applied to the chemical elements, for it appears that uranium may\r\nchange into radium, that radium may produce helium, and that lead is the\r\nfinal stable result when the changes of uranium are complete. Perhaps\r\nall the elements may be the outcome of an inorganic evolution. Not less\r\nimportant is the extension of the evolution-idea to the world within as\r\nwell as to the world without. For alongside of the evolution of bodies\r\nand brains is the evolution of feelings and emotions, ideas and\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nOrganic evolution means that the present is the child of the past and\r\nthe parent of the future. It is not a power or a principle; it is a\r\nprocess--a process of becoming. It means that the present-day animals\r\nand plants and all the subtle inter-relations between them have arisen\r\nin a natural knowable way from a preceding state of affairs on the whole\r\nsomewhat simpler, and that again from forms and inter-relations simpler\r\nstill, and so on backwards and backwards for millions of years till we\r\nlose all clues in the thick mist that hangs over life's beginnings.\r\n\r\nOur solar system was once represented by a nebula of some sort, and we\r\nmay speak of the evolution of the sun and the planets. But since it has\r\nbeen _the same material throughout_ that has changed in its distribution\r\nand forms, it might be clearer to use some word like genesis. Similarly,\r\nour human institutions were once very different from what they are now,\r\nand we may speak of the evolution of government or of cities. But Man\r\nworks with a purpose, with ideas and ideals in some measure controlling\r\nhis actions and guiding his achievements, so that it is probably clearer\r\nto keep the good old word history for all processes of social becoming\r\nin which man has been a conscious agent. Now between the genesis of the\r\nsolar system and the history of civilisation there comes the vast\r\nprocess of organic evolution. The word development should be kept for\r\nthe becoming of the individual, the chick out of the egg, for instance.\r\n\r\nOrganic evolution is a continuous natural process of racial change, by\r\nsuccessive steps in a definite direction, whereby distinctively new\r\nindividualities arise, take root, and flourish, sometimes alongside of,\r\nand sometimes, sooner or later, in place of, the originative stock. Our\r\ndomesticated breeds of pigeons and poultry are the results of\r\nevolutionary change whose origins are still with us in the Rock Dove and\r\nthe Jungle Fowl; but in most cases in Wild Nature the ancestral stocks\r\nof present-day forms are long since extinct, and in many cases they are\r\nunknown. Evolution is a long process of coming and going, appearing and\r\ndisappearing, a long-drawn-out sublime process like a great piece of\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Rischgitz Collection._\r\n\r\nCHARLES DARWIN\r\n\r\nGreatest of naturalists, who made the idea of evolution current\r\nintellectual coin, and in his _Origin of Species_ (1859) made the whole\r\nworld new.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Rischgitz Collection._\r\n\r\nLORD KELVIN\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest physicists of the nineteenth century. He estimated\r\nthe age of the earth at 20,000,000 years. He had not at his disposal,\r\nhowever, the knowledge of recent discoveries, which have resulted in\r\nthis estimate being very greatly increased.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Lick Observatory._\r\n\r\nA GIANT SPIRAL NEBULA\r\n\r\nLaplace's famous theory was that the planets and the earth were formed\r\nfrom great whirling nebulæ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Natural History Museum._\r\n\r\nMETEORITE WHICH FELL NEAR SCARBOROUGH, AND IS NOW TO BE SEEN IN THE\r\nNATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM\r\n\r\nIt weighs about 56 lb., and is a \"stony\" meteorite, i.e., an aerolite.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nThe Beginning of the Earth\r\n\r\nWhen we speak the language of science we cannot say \"In the beginning,\"\r\nfor we do not know of and cannot think of any condition of things that\r\ndid not arise from something that went before. But we may qualify the\r\nphrase, and legitimately inquire into the beginning of the earth within\r\nthe solar system. If the result of this inquiry is to trace the sun and\r\nthe planets back to a nebula we reach only a relative beginning. The\r\nnebula has to be accounted for. And even before matter there may have\r\nbeen a pre-material world. If we say, as was said long ago, \"In the\r\nbeginning was Mind,\" we may be expressing or trying to express a great\r\ntruth, but we have gone BEYOND SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nebular Hypothesis\r\n\r\nOne of the grandest pictures that the scientific mind has ever thrown\r\nupon the screen is that of the Nebular Hypothesis. According to\r\nLaplace's famous form of this theory (1796), the solar system was once a\r\ngigantic glowing mass, spinning slowly and uniformly around its centre.\r\nAs the incandescent world-cloud of gas cooled and its speed of rotation\r\nincreased the shrinking mass gave off a separate whirling ring, which\r\nbroke up and gathered together again as the first and most distant\r\nplanet. The main mass gave off another ring and another till all the\r\nplanets, including the earth, were formed. The central mass persisted as\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nLaplace spoke of his theory, which Kant had anticipated forty-one years\r\nbefore, with scientific caution: \"conjectures which I present with all\r\nthe distrust which everything not the result of observation or of\r\ncalculation ought to inspire.\" Subsequent research justified his\r\ndistrust, for it has been shown that the original nebula need not have\r\nbeen hot and need not have been gaseous. Moreover, there are great\r\ndifficulties in Laplace's theory of the separation of successive rings\r\nfrom the main mass, and of the condensation of a whirling gaseous ring\r\ninto a planet.\r\n\r\nSo it has come about that the picture of a hot gaseous nebula revolving\r\nas a unit body has given place to other pictures. Thus Sir Norman\r\nLockyer pointed out (1890) that the earth is gathering to itself\r\nmillions of meteorites every day; this has been going on for millions of\r\nyears; in distant ages the accretion may have been vastly more rapid and\r\nvoluminous; and so the earth has grown! Now the meteoritic contributions\r\nare undoubted, but they require a centre to attract them, and the\r\ndifficulty is to account for the beginning of a collecting centre or\r\nplanetary nucleus. Moreover, meteorites are sporadic and erratic,\r\nscattered hither and thither rather than collecting into unit-bodies. As\r\nProfessor Chamberlin says, \"meteorites have rather the characteristics\r\nof the wreckage of some earlier organisation than of the parentage of\r\nour planetary system.\" Several other theories have been propounded to\r\naccount for the origin of the earth, but the one that has found most\r\nfavour in the eyes of authorities is that of Chamberlin and Moulton.\r\nAccording to this theory a great nebular mass condensed to form the sun,\r\nfrom which under the attraction of passing stars planet after planet,\r\nthe earth included, was heaved off in the form of knotted spiral nebulæ,\r\nlike many of those now observed in the heavens.\r\n\r\nOf great importance were the \"knots,\" for they served as collecting\r\ncentres drawing flying matter into their clutches. Whatever part of the\r\nprimitive bolt escaped and scattered was drawn out into independent\r\norbits round the sun, forming the \"planetesimals\" which behave like\r\nminute planets. These planetesimals formed the food on which the knots\r\nsubsequently fed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Growth of the Earth\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that the newborn earth--the \"earth-knot\" of\r\nChamberlin's theory--had a diameter of about 5,500 miles. But it grew\r\nby drawing planetesimals into itself until it had a diameter of over\r\n8,100 miles at the end of its growing period. Since then it has shrunk,\r\nby periodic shrinkages which have meant the buckling up of successive\r\nseries of mountains, and it has now a diameter of 7,918 miles. But\r\nduring the shrinking the earth became more varied.\r\n\r\nA sort of slow boiling of the internally hot earth often forced molten\r\nmatter through the cold outer crust, and there came about a gradual\r\nassortment of lighter materials nearer the surface and heavier materials\r\ndeeper down. The continents are built of the lighter materials, such as\r\ngranites, while the beds of the great oceans are made of the heavier\r\nmaterials such as basalts. In limited areas land has often become sea,\r\nand sea has often given place to land, but the probability is that the\r\ndistinction of the areas corresponding to the great continents and\r\noceans goes back to a very early stage.\r\n\r\nThe lithosphere is the more or less stable crust of the earth, which may\r\nhave been, to begin with, about fifty miles in thickness. It seems that\r\nthe young earth had no atmosphere, and that ages passed before water\r\nbegan to accumulate on its surface--before, in other words, there was\r\nany hydrosphere. The water came from the earth itself, to begin with,\r\nand it was long before there was any rain dissolving out saline matter\r\nfrom the exposed rocks and making the sea salt. The weathering of the\r\nhigh grounds of the ancient crust by air and water furnished the\r\nmaterial which formed the sandstones and mudstones and other sedimentary\r\nrocks, which are said to amount to a thickness of over fifty miles in\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nMaking a Home for Life\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to inquire how the callous, rough-and-tumble\r\nconditions of the outer world in early days were replaced by others that\r\nallowed of the germination and growth of that tender plant we call\r\nLIFE. There are very tough living creatures, but the average organism is\r\nill suited for violence. Most living creatures are adapted to mild\r\ntemperatures and gentle reactions. Hence the fundamental importance of\r\nthe early atmosphere, heavy with planetesimal dust, in blanketing the\r\nearth against intensities of radiance from without, as Chamberlin says,\r\nand inequalities of radiance from within. This was the first preparation\r\nfor life, but it was an atmosphere without free oxygen. Not less\r\nimportant was the appearance of pools and lakelets, of lakes and seas.\r\nPerhaps the early waters covered the earth. And water was the second\r\npreparation for life--water, that can dissolve a larger variety of\r\nsubstances in greater concentration than any other liquid; water, that\r\nin summer does not readily evaporate altogether from a pond, nor in\r\nwinter freeze throughout its whole extent; water, that is such a mobile\r\nvehicle and such a subtle cleaver of substances; water, that forms over\r\n80 per cent. of living matter itself.\r\n\r\nOf great significance was the abundance of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen\r\n(in the form of carbonic acid and water) in the atmosphere of the\r\ncooling earth, for these three wonderful elements have a unique\r\n_ensemble_ of properties--ready to enter into reactions and relations,\r\nmaking great diversity and complexity possible, favouring the formation\r\nof the plastic and permeable materials that build up living creatures.\r\nWe must not pursue the idea, but it is clear that the stones and mortar\r\nof the inanimate world are such that they built a friendly home for\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrigin of Living Creatures upon the Earth\r\n\r\nDuring the early chapters of the earth's history, no living creature\r\nthat we can imagine could possibly have lived there. The temperature was\r\ntoo high; there was neither atmosphere nor surface water. Therefore it\r\nfollows that at some uncertain, but inconceivably distant date, living\r\ncreatures appeared upon the earth. No one knows how, but it is\r\ninteresting to consider possibilities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Reproduced from the Smithsonian Report, 1915._\r\n\r\nA LIMESTONE CANYON\r\n\r\nMany fossils of extinct animals have been found in such rock\r\nformations.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENEALOGICAL TREE OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\nShowing in order of evolution the general relations of the chief classes\r\ninto which the world of living things is divided. This scheme represents\r\nthe present stage of our knowledge, but is admittedly provisional.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF AMOEBA\r\n\r\n(Greatly magnified.)\r\n\r\nThe amoeba is one of the simplest of all animals, and gives us a hint\r\nof the original ancestors. It looks like a tiny irregular speck of\r\ngreyish jelly, about 1/100th of an inch in diameter. It is commonly\r\nfound gliding on the mud or weeds in ponds, where it engulfs its\r\nmicroscopic food by means of out-flowing lobes (PS). The food vacuole\r\n(FV) contains ingested food. From the contractile vacuole (CV) the waste\r\nmatter is discharged. N is the nucleus, GR, granules.]\r\n\r\nFrom ancient times it has been a favourite answer that the dust of the\r\nearth may have become living in a way which is outside scientific\r\ndescription. This answer forecloses the question, and it is far too soon\r\nto do that. Science must often say \"Ignoramus\": Science should be slow\r\nto say \"Ignorabimus.\"\r\n\r\nA second position held by Helmholtz, Lord Kelvin, and others, suggests\r\nthat minute living creatures may have come to the earth from elsewhere,\r\nin the cracks of a meteorite or among cosmic dust. It must be remembered\r\nthat seeds can survive prolonged exposure to very low temperatures; that\r\nspores of bacteria can survive high temperature; that seeds of plants\r\nand germs of animals in a state of \"latent life\" can survive prolonged\r\ndrought and absence of oxygen. It is possible, according to Berthelot,\r\nthat as long as there is not molecular disintegration vital activities\r\nmay be suspended for a time, and may afterwards recommence when\r\nappropriate conditions are restored. Therefore, one should be slow to\r\nsay that a long journey through space is impossible. The obvious\r\nlimitation of Lord Kelvin's theory is that it only shifts the problem of\r\nthe origin of organisms (i.e. living creatures) from the earth to\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe third answer is that living creatures of a very simple sort may have\r\nemerged on the earth's surface from not-living material, e.g. from some\r\nsemi-fluid carbon compounds activated by ferments. The tenability of\r\nthis view is suggested by the achievements of the synthetic chemists,\r\nwho are able artificially to build up substances such as oxalic acid,\r\nindigo, salicylic acid, caffeine, and grape-sugar. We do not know,\r\nindeed, what in Nature's laboratory would take the place of the clever\r\nsynthetic chemist, but there seems to be a tendency to complexity.\r\nCorpuscles form atoms, atoms form molecules, small molecules large\r\nones.\r\n\r\nVarious concrete suggestions have been made in regard to the possible\r\norigin of living matter, which will be dealt with in a later chapter. So\r\nfar as we know of what goes on to-day, there is no evidence of\r\nspontaneous generation; organisms seem always to arise from pre-existing\r\norganisms of the same kind; where any suggestion of the contrary has\r\nbeen fancied, there have been flaws in the experimenting. But it is one\r\nthing to accept the verdict \"omne vivum e vivo\" as a fact to which\r\nexperiment has not yet discovered an exception and another thing to\r\nmaintain that this must always have been true or must always remain\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nIf the synthetic chemists should go on surpassing themselves, if\r\nsubstances like white of egg should be made artificially, and if we\r\nshould get more light on possible steps by which simple living creatures\r\nmay have arisen from not-living materials, this would not greatly affect\r\nour general outlook on life, though it would increase our appreciation\r\nof what is often libelled as \"inert\" matter. If the dust of the earth\r\ndid naturally give rise very long ago to living creatures, if they are\r\nin a real sense born of her and of the sunshine, then the whole world\r\nbecomes more continuous and more vital, and all the inorganic groaning\r\nand travailing becomes more intelligible.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4\r\n\r\nThe First Organisms upon the Earth\r\n\r\nWe cannot have more than a speculative picture of the first living\r\ncreatures upon the earth or, rather, in the waters that covered the\r\nearth. A basis for speculation is to be found, however, in the simplest\r\ncreatures living to-day, such as some of the bacteria and one-celled\r\nanimalcules, especially those called Protists, which have not taken any\r\nvery definite step towards becoming either plants or animals. No one can\r\nbe sure, but there is much to be said for the theory that the first\r\ncreatures were microscopic globules of living matter, not unlike the\r\nsimplest bacteria of to-day, but able to live on air, water, and\r\ndissolved salts. From such a source may have originated a race of\r\none-celled marine organisms which were able to manufacture chlorophyll,\r\nor something like chlorophyll, that is to say, the green pigment which\r\nmakes it possible for plants to utilise the energy of the sunlight in\r\nbreaking up carbon dioxide and in building up (photosynthesis) carbon\r\ncompounds like sugars and starch. These little units were probably\r\nencased in a cell-wall of cellulose, but their boxed-in energy expressed\r\nitself in the undulatory movement of a lash or flagellum, by means of\r\nwhich they propelled themselves energetically through the water. There\r\nare many similar organisms to-day, mostly in water, but some of\r\nthem--simple one-celled plants--paint the tree-stems and even the\r\npaving-stones green in wet weather. According to Prof. A. H. Church\r\nthere was a long chapter in the history of the earth when the sea that\r\ncovered everything teemed with these green flagellates--the originators\r\nof the Vegetable Kingdom.\r\n\r\nOn another tack, however, there probably evolved a series of simple\r\npredatory creatures, not able to build up organic matter from air,\r\nwater, and salts, but devouring their neighbours. These units were not\r\nclosed in with cellulose, but remained naked, with their living matter\r\nor protoplasm flowing out in changeful processes, such as we see in the\r\nAmoebæ in the ditch or in our own white blood corpuscles and other\r\namoeboid cells. These were the originators of the animal kingdom. Thus\r\nfrom very simple Protists the first animals and the first plants may\r\nhave arisen. All were still very minute, and it is worth remembering\r\nthat had there been any scientific spectator after our kind upon the\r\nearth during these long ages, he would have lamented the entire absence\r\nof life, although the seas were teeming. The simplest forms of life and\r\nthe protoplasm which Huxley called the physical basis of life will be\r\ndealt with in the chapter on Biology in a later section of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST GREAT STEPS IN EVOLUTION\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PLANTS--THE FIRST ANIMALS--BEGINNINGS OF BODIES--EVOLUTION OF\r\nSEX--BEGINNING OF NATURAL DEATH\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nThe Contrast between Plants and Animals\r\n\r\nHowever it may have come about, there is no doubt at all that one of the\r\nfirst great steps in Organic Evolution was the forking of the\r\ngenealogical tree into Plants and Animals--the most important parting of\r\nthe ways in the whole history of Nature.\r\n\r\nTypical plants have chlorophyll; they are able to feed at a low chemical\r\nlevel on air, water, and salts, using the energy of the sunlight in\r\ntheir photosynthesis. They have their cells boxed in by cellulose walls,\r\nso that their opportunities for motility are greatly restricted. They\r\nmanufacture much more nutritive material than they need, and live far\r\nbelow their income. They have no ready way of getting rid of any\r\nnitrogenous waste matter that they may form, and this probably helps to\r\nkeep them sluggish.\r\n\r\nAnimals, on the other hand, feed at a high chemical level, on the\r\ncarbohydrates (e.g. starch and sugar), fats, and proteins (e.g. gluten,\r\nalbumin, casein) which are manufactured by other animals, or to begin\r\nwith, by plants. Their cells have not cellulose walls, nor in most cases\r\nmuch wall of any kind, and motility in the majority is unrestricted.\r\nAnimals live much more nearly up to their income. If we could make for\r\nan animal and a plant of equal weight two fractions showing the ratio of\r\nthe upbuilding, constructive, chemical processes to the down-breaking,\r\ndisruptive, chemical processes that go on in their respective bodies,\r\nthe ratio for the plant would be much greater than the corresponding\r\nratio for the animal. In other words, animals take the munitions which\r\nplants laboriously manufacture and explode them in locomotion and\r\nwork; and the entire system of animate nature depends upon the\r\nphotosynthesis that goes on in green plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From the Smithsonian Report, 1917_\r\n\r\nA PIECE OF A REEF-BUILDING CORAL, BUILT UP BY A LARGE COLONY OF SMALL\r\nSEA-ANEMONE-LIKE POLYPS, EACH OF WHICH FORMS FROM THE SALTS OF THE SEA A\r\nSKELETON OR SHELL OF LIME\r\n\r\nThe wonderful mass of corals, which are very beautiful, are the skeleton\r\nremains of hundreds of these little creatures.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: J.

Sluggish animals like\r\nsea-squirts which have no kidneys are exceptions that prove the rule,\r\nand it need hardly be said that the statements that have been made in\r\nregard to the contrasts between plants and animals are general\r\nstatements. There is often a good deal of the plant about the animal, as\r\nin sedentary sponges, zoophytes, corals, and sea-squirts, and there is\r\noften a little of the animal about the plant, as we see in the movements\r\nof all shoots and roots and leaves, and occasionally in the parts of the\r\nflower. But the important fact is that on the early forking of the\r\ngenealogical tree, i.e. the divergence of plants and animals, there\r\ndepended and depends all the higher life of the animal kingdom, not to\r\nspeak of mankind. The continuance of civilisation, the upkeep of the\r\nhuman and animal population of the globe, and even the supply of oxygen\r\nto the air we breathe, depend on the silent laboratories of the green\r\nleaves, which are able with the help of the sunlight to use carbonic\r\nacid, water, and salts to build up the bread of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nThe Beginnings of Land Plants\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that for long ages the waters covered the earth,\r\nand that all the primeval vegetation consisted of simple Flagellates in\r\nthe universal Open Sea. But contraction of the earth's crust brought\r\nabout elevations and depressions of the sea-floor, and in places the\r\nsolid substratum was brought near enough the surface to allow the\r\nfloating plants to begin to settle down without getting out of the\r\nlight. This is how Professor Church pictures the beginning of a fixed\r\nvegetation--a very momentous step in evolution. It was perhaps among\r\nthis early vegetation that animals had their first successes. As the\r\nfloor of the sea in these shallow areas was raised higher and higher\r\nthere was a beginning of dry land. The sedentary plants already spoken\r\nof were the ancestors of the shore seaweeds, and there is no doubt that\r\nwhen we go down at the lowest tide and wade cautiously out among the\r\njungle of vegetation only exposed on such occasions we are getting a\r\nglimpse of very ancient days. _This_ is the forest primeval.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Protozoa\r\n\r\nAnimals below the level of zoophytes and sponges are called Protozoa.\r\nThe word obviously means \"First Animals,\" but all that we can say is\r\nthat the very simplest of them may give us some hint of the simplicity\r\nof the original first animals. For it is quite certain that the vast\r\nmajority of the Protozoa to-day are far too complicated to be thought of\r\nas primitive. Though most of them are microscopic, each is an animal\r\ncomplete in itself, with the same fundamental bodily attributes as are\r\nmanifested in ourselves. They differ from animals of higher degree in\r\nnot being built up of the unit areas or corpuscles called cells. They\r\nhave no cells, no tissues, no organs, in the ordinary acceptation of\r\nthese words, but many of them show a great complexity of internal\r\nstructure, far exceeding that of the ordinary cells that build up the\r\ntissues of higher animals. They are complete living creatures which have\r\nnot gone in for body-making.\r\n\r\nIn the dim and distant past there was a time when the only animals were\r\nof the nature of Protozoa, and it is safe to say that one of the great\r\nsteps in evolution was the establishment of three great types of\r\nProtozoa: (_a_) Some were very active, the Infusorians, like the slipper\r\nanimalcule, the night-light (Noctiluca), which makes the seas\r\nphosphorescent at night, and the deadly Trypanosome, which causes\r\nSleeping Sickness. (_b_) Others were very sluggish, the parasitic\r\nSporozoa, like the malaria organism which the mosquito introduces into\r\nman's body. (_c_) Others were neither very active nor very passive, the\r\nRhizopods, with out-flowing processes of living matter. This amoeboid\r\nline of evolution has been very successful; it is represented by the\r\nRhizopods, such as Amoebæ and the chalk-forming Foraminifera and the\r\nexquisitely beautiful flint-shelled Radiolarians of the open sea. They\r\nhave their counterparts in the amoeboid cells of most multicellular\r\nanimals, such as the phagocytes which migrate about in the body,\r\nengulfing and digesting intruding bacteria, serving as sappers and\r\nminers when something has to be broken down and built up again, and\r\nperforming other useful offices.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nThe Making of a Body\r\n\r\nThe great naturalist Louis Agassiz once said that the biggest gulf in\r\nOrganic Nature was that between the unicellular and the multicellular\r\nanimals (Protozoa and Metazoa). But the gulf was bridged very long ago\r\nwhen sponges, stinging animals, and simple worms were evolved, and\r\nshowed, for the first time, a \"body.\" What would one not give to be able\r\nto account for the making of a body, one of the great steps in\r\nevolution! No one knows, but the problem is not altogether obscure.\r\n\r\nWhen an ordinary Protozoon or one-celled animal divides into two or\r\nmore, which is its way of multiplying, the daughter-units thus formed\r\nfloat apart and live independent lives. But there are a few Protozoa in\r\nwhich the daughter-units are not quite separated off from one another,\r\nbut remain coherent. Thus Volvox, a beautiful green ball, found in some\r\ncanals and the like, is a colony of a thousand or even ten thousand\r\ncells. It has almost formed a body! But in this \"colony-making\"\r\nProtozoon, and in others like it, the component cells are all of one\r\nkind, whereas in true multicellular animals there are different kinds\r\nof cells, showing division of labour. There are some other Protozoa in\r\nwhich the nucleus or kernel divides into many nuclei within the cell.\r\nThis is seen in the Giant Amoeba (Pelomyxa), sometimes found in\r\nduck-ponds, or the beautiful Opalina, which always lives in the hind\r\npart of the frog's food-canal. If a portion of the living matter of\r\nthese Protozoa should gather round each of the nuclei, then _that would\r\nbe the beginning of a body_. It would be still nearer the beginning of a\r\nbody if division of labour set in, and if there was a setting apart of\r\negg-cells and sperm-cells distinct from body-cells.\r\n\r\nIt was possibly in some such way that animals and plants with a body\r\nwere first evolved. Two points should be noticed, that body-making is\r\nnot essentially a matter of size, though it made large size possible.\r\nFor the body of a many-celled Wheel Animalcule or Rotifer is no bigger\r\nthan many a Protozoon. Yet the Rotifer--we are thinking of Hydatina--has\r\nnine hundred odd cells, whereas the Protozoon has only one, except in\r\nforms like Volvox. Secondly, it is a luminous fact that _every\r\nmany-celled animal from sponge to man that multiplies in the ordinary\r\nway begins at the beginning again as a \"single cell,\"_ the fertilised\r\negg-cell. It is, of course, not an ordinary single cell that develops\r\ninto an earthworm or a butterfly, an eagle, or a man; it is a cell in\r\nwhich a rich inheritance, the fruition of ages, is somehow condensed;\r\nbut it is interesting to bear in mind the elementary fact that every\r\nmany-celled creature, reproduced in the ordinary way and not by budding\r\nor the like, starts as a fertilised egg-cell. The coherence of the\r\ndaughter-cells into which the fertilised egg-cell divides is a\r\nreminiscence, as it were, of the primeval coherence of daughter-units\r\nthat made the first body possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beginning of Sexual Reproduction\r\n\r\nA freshwater Hydra, growing on the duckweed usually multiplies by\r\nbudding. It forms daughter-buds, living images of itself; a check comes\r\nto nutrition and these daughter-buds go free. A big sea-anemone may\r\ndivide in two or more parts, which become separate animals. This is\r\nasexual reproduction, which means that the multiplication takes place by\r\ndividing into two or many portions, and not by liberating egg-cells and\r\nsperm-cells. Among animals as among plants, asexual reproduction is very\r\ncommon. But it has great disadvantages, for it is apt to be\r\nphysiologically expensive, and it is beset with difficulties when the\r\nbody shows great division of labour, and is very intimately bound into\r\nunity. Thus, no one can think of a bee or a bird multiplying by division\r\nor by budding. Moreover, if the body of the parent has suffered from\r\ninjury or deterioration, the result of this is bound to be handed on to\r\nthe next generation if asexual reproduction is the only method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photos: J.

It is one of the first\r\nanimals to suggest the beginning of a body. It is a colony of a thousand\r\nor even ten thousand cells, but they are all cells of one kind. In\r\n_multicellular_ animals the cells are of _different_ kinds with\r\ndifferent functions. Each of the ordinary cells (marked 5) has two\r\nlashes or flagella. Daughter colonies inside the Parent colony are being\r\nformed at 3, 4, and 2. The development of germ-cells is shown at 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROTEROSPONGIA\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest multicellular animals, illustrating the beginning of\r\na body. There is a setting apart of egg-cells and sperm-cells, distinct\r\nfrom body-cells; the collared lashed cells on the margin are different\r\nin kind from those farther in. Thus, as in indubitable multicellular\r\nanimals, division of labour has begun.]\r\n\r\nSplitting into two or many parts was the old-fashioned way of\r\nmultiplying, but one of the great steps in evolution was the discovery\r\nof a better method, namely, sexual reproduction. The gist of this is\r\nsimply that during the process of body-building (by the development of\r\nthe fertilised egg-cell) certain units, _the germ-cells_, do not share\r\nin forming ordinary tissues or organs, but remain apart, continuing the\r\nfull inheritance which was condensed in the fertilised egg-cell. _These\r\ncells kept by themselves are the originators of the future reproductive\r\ncells of the mature animal_; they give rise to the egg-cells and the\r\nsperm-cells.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this method are great. (1) The new generation is\r\nstarted less expensively, for it is easier to shed germ-cells into the\r\ncradle of the water than to separate off half of the body. (2) It is\r\npossible to start a great many new lives at once, and this may be of\r\nvital importance when the struggle for existence is very keen, and when\r\nparental care is impossible. (3) The germ-cells are little likely to be\r\nprejudicially affected by disadvantageous dints impressed on the body of\r\nthe parent--little likely unless the dints have peculiarly penetrating\r\nconsequences, as in the case of poisons. (4) A further advantage is\r\nimplied in the formation of two kinds of germ-cells--the ovum or\r\negg-cell, with a considerable amount of building material and often with\r\na legacy of nutritive yolk; the spermatozoon or sperm-cell, adapted to\r\nmove in fluids and to find the ovum from a distance, thus securing\r\nchange-provoking cross-fertilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4\r\n\r\nThe Evolution of Sex\r\n\r\nAnother of the great steps in organic evolution was the differentiation\r\nof two different physiological types, the male or sperm-producer and the\r\nfemale or egg-producer. It seems to be a deep-seated difference in\r\nconstitution, which leads one egg to develop into a male, and another,\r\nlying beside it in the nest, into a female. In the case of pigeons it\r\nseems almost certain, from the work of Professor Oscar Riddle, that\r\nthere are two kinds of egg, a male-producing egg and a female-producing\r\negg, which differ in their yolk-forming and other physiological\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nIn sea-urchins we often find two creatures superficially\r\nindistinguishable, but the one is a female with large ovaries and the\r\nother is a male with equally large testes. Here the physiological\r\ndifference does not affect the body as a whole, but the reproductive\r\norgans or gonads only, though more intimate physiology would doubtless\r\ndiscover differences in the blood or in the chemical routine\r\n(metabolism). In a large number of cases, however, there are marked\r\nsuperficial differences between the sexes, and everyone is familiar with\r\nsuch contrasts as peacock and peahen, stag and hind. In such cases the\r\nphysiological difference between the sperm-producer and the\r\novum-producer, for this is the essential difference, saturates through\r\nthe body and expresses itself in masculine and feminine structures and\r\nmodes of behaviour. The expression of the masculine and feminine\r\ncharacters is in some cases under the control of hormones or chemical\r\nmessengers which are carried by the blood from the reproductive organs\r\nthroughout the body, and pull the trigger which brings about the\r\ndevelopment of an antler or a wattle or a decorative plume or a capacity\r\nfor vocal and saltatory display. In some cases it is certain that the\r\nfemale carries in a latent state the masculine features, but these are\r\nkept from expressing themselves by other chemical messengers from the\r\novary. Of these chemical messengers more must be said later on.\r\n\r\nRecent research has shown that while the difference between male and\r\nfemale is very deep-rooted, corresponding to a difference in gearing, it\r\nis not always clear-cut. Thus a hen-pigeon may be very masculine, and a\r\ncock-pigeon very feminine. The difference is in degree, not in kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5\r\n\r\nWhat is the meaning of the universal or almost universal inevitableness\r\nof death? A Sequoia or \"Big Tree\" of California has been known to live\r\nfor over two thousand years, but eventually it died. A centenarian\r\ntortoise has been known, and a sea-anemone sixty years of age; but\r\neventually they die. What is the meaning of this apparently inevitable\r\nstoppage of bodily life?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beginning of Natural Death\r\n\r\nThere are three chief kinds of death, (_a_) The great majority of\r\nanimals come to a violent end, being devoured by others or killed by\r\nsudden and extreme changes in their surroundings. (_b_) When an animal\r\nenters a new habitat, or comes into new associations with other\r\norganisms, it may be invaded by a microbe or by some larger parasite to\r\nwhich it is unaccustomed and to which it can offer no resistance. With\r\nmany parasites a \"live-and-let-live\" compromise is arrived at, but new\r\nparasites are apt to be fatal, as man knows to his cost when he is\r\nbitten by a tse-tse fly which infects him with the microscopic animal (a\r\nTrypanosome) that causes Sleeping Sickness. In many animals the\r\nparasites are not troublesome as long as the host is vigorous, but if\r\nthe host is out of condition the parasites may get the upper hand, as in\r\nthe so-called \"grouse disease,\" and become fatal. (_c_) But besides\r\nviolent death and microbic (or parasitic) death, there is natural death.\r\nThis is in great part to be regarded as the price paid for a body. A\r\nbody worth having implies complexity or division of labour, and this\r\nimplies certain internal furnishings of a more or less stable kind in\r\nwhich the effects of wear and tear are apt to accumulate. It is not the\r\nliving matter itself that grows old so much as the framework in which it\r\nworks--the furnishings of the vital laboratory. There are various\r\nprocesses of rejuvenescence, e.g. rest, repair, change, reorganisation,\r\nwhich work against the inevitable processes of senescence, but sooner or\r\nlater the victory is with ageing. Another deep reason for natural death\r\nis to be found in the physiological expensiveness of reproduction, for\r\nmany animals, from worms to eels, illustrate natural death as the\r\nnemesis of starting new lives. Now it is a very striking fact that to a\r\nlarge degree the simplest animals or Protozoa are exempt from natural\r\ndeath. They are so relatively simple that they can continually\r\nrecuperate by rest and repair; they do not accumulate any bad debts.\r\nMoreover, their modes of multiplying, by dividing into two or many\r\nunits, are very inexpensive physiologically. It seems that in some\r\nmeasure this bodily immortality of the Protozoa is shared by some simple\r\nmany-celled animals like the freshwater Hydra and Planarian worms. Here\r\nis an interesting chapter in evolution, the evolution of means of\r\nevading or staving off natural death. Thus there is the well-known case\r\nof the Paloloworm of the coral-reefs where the body breaks up in\r\nliberating the germ-cells, but the head-end remains fixed in a crevice\r\nof the coral, and buds out a new body at leisure.\r\n\r\nAlong with the evolution of the ways of avoiding death should be\r\nconsidered also the gradual establishment of the length of life best\r\nsuited to the welfare of the species, and the punctuation of the\r\nlife-history to suit various conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: J.

In mammals it becomes more and more convoluted. The brain,\r\nwhich lies in one plane in fishes, becomes gradually curved on itself.\r\nIn birds it is more curved than the drawing shows.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6\r\n\r\nGreat Acquisitions\r\n\r\nIn animals like sea-anemones and jellyfishes the general symmetry of the\r\nbody is radial; that is to say, there is no right or left, and the body\r\nmight be halved along many planes. It is a kind of symmetry well suited\r\nfor sedentary or for drifting life. But worms began the profitable habit\r\nof moving with one end of the body always in front, and from worms to\r\nman the great majority of animals have bilateral symmetry. They have a\r\nright and a left side, and there is only one cut that halves the body.\r\nThis kind of symmetry is suited for a more strenuous life than radial\r\nanimals show; it is suited for pursuing food, for avoiding enemies, for\r\nchasing mates. And _with the establishment of bilateral symmetry must be\r\nassociated the establishment of head-brains_, the beginning of which is\r\nto be found in some simple worm-types.\r\n\r\nAmong the other great acquisitions gradually evolved we may notice: a\r\nwell-developed head with sense-organs, the establishment of large\r\ninternal surfaces such as the digestive and absorptive wall of the\r\nfood-canal, the origin of quickly contracting striped muscle and of\r\nmuscular appendages, the formation of blood as a distributing medium\r\nthroughout the body, from which all the parts take what they need and to\r\nwhich they also contribute.\r\n\r\nAnother very important acquisition, almost confined (so far as is known)\r\nto backboned animals, was the evolution of what are called glands of\r\ninternal secretion, such as the thyroid and the supra-renal. These\r\nmanufacture subtle chemical substances which are distributed by the\r\nblood throughout the body, and have a manifold influence in regulating\r\nand harmonising the vital processes. Some of these chemical messengers\r\nare called hormones, which stimulate organs and tissues to greater\r\nactivity; others are called chalones, which put on a brake. Some\r\nregulate growth and others rapidly alter the pressure and composition\r\nof the blood. Some of them call into active development certain parts of\r\nthe body which have been, as it were, waiting for an appropriate\r\ntrigger-pulling. Thus, at the proper time, the milk-glands of a\r\nmammalian mother are awakened from their dormancy. This very interesting\r\noutcome of evolution will be dealt with in another portion of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INCLINED PLANE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nBefore passing to a connected story of the gradual emergence of higher\r\nand higher forms of life in the course of the successive ages--the\r\nprocession of life, as it may be called--it will be useful to consider\r\nthe evolution of animal behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvolution of Mind\r\n\r\nA human being begins as a microscopic fertilised egg-cell, within which\r\nthere is condensed the long result of time--Man's inheritance. The long\r\nperiod of nine months before birth, with its intimate partnership\r\nbetween mother and offspring, is passed as it were in sleep, and no one\r\ncan make any statement in regard to the mind of the unborn child. Even\r\nafter birth the dawn of mind is as slow as it is wonderful. To begin\r\nwith, there is in the ovum and early embryo no nervous system at all,\r\nand it develops very gradually from simple beginnings. Yet as mentality\r\ncannot come in from outside, we seem bound to conclude that the\r\npotentiality of it--whatever that means--resides in the individual from\r\nthe very first. The particular kind of activity known to us as thinking,\r\nfeeling, and willing is the most intimate part of our experience, known\r\nto us directly apart from our senses, and the possibility of that must\r\nbe implicit in the germ-cell just as the genius of Newton was implicit\r\nin a very miserable specimen of an infant. Now what is true of the\r\nindividual is true also of the race--there is a gradual evolution of\r\nthat aspect of the living creature's activity which we call mind. We\r\ncannot put our finger on any point and say: Before this stage there was\r\nno mind. Indeed, many facts suggest the conclusion that wherever there\r\nis life there is some degree of mind--even in the plants. Or it might be\r\nmore accurate to put the conclusion in another way, that the activity we\r\ncall life has always in some degree an inner or mental aspect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OKAPI AND GIRAFFE\r\n\r\nThe Okapi is one of the great zoölogical discoveries. It gives a good\r\nidea of what the Giraffe's ancestors were like. The Okapi was unknown\r\nuntil discovered in 1900 by Sir Harry Johnston in Central Africa, where\r\nthese strange animals have probably lived in dense forests from time\r\nimmemorial.]\r\n\r\nIn another part of this book there is an account of the dawn of mind in\r\nbackboned animals; what we aim at here is an outline of what may be\r\ncalled the inclined plane of animal behaviour.\r\n\r\nA very simple animal accumulates a little store of potential energy, and\r\nit proceeds to expend this, like an explosive, by acting on its\r\nenvironment. It does so in a very characteristic self-preservative\r\nfashion, so that it burns without being consumed and explodes without\r\nbeing blown to bits. It is characteristic of the organism that it\r\nremains a going concern for a longer or shorter period--its length of\r\nlife. Living creatures that expended their energy ineffectively or\r\nself-destructively would be eliminated in the struggle for existence.\r\nWhen a simple one-celled organism explores a corner of the field seen\r\nunder a microscope, behaving to all appearance very like a dog scouring\r\na field seen through a telescope, it seems permissible to think of\r\nsomething corresponding to mental endeavour associated with its\r\nactivity. This impression is strengthened when an amoeba pursues\r\nanother amoeba, overtakes it, engulfs it, loses it, pursues it again,\r\nrecaptures it, and so on. What is quite certain is that the behaviour of\r\nthe animalcule is not like that of a potassium pill fizzing about in a\r\nbasin of water, nor like the lurching movements of a gun that has got\r\nloose and \"taken charge\" on board ship. Another feature is that the\r\nlocomotor activity of an animalcule often shows a distinct\r\nindividuality: it may swim, for instance, in a loose spiral.\r\n\r\nBut there is another side to vital activity besides acting upon the\r\nsurrounding world; the living creature is acted on by influences from\r\nwithout. The organism acts on its environment; that is the one side of\r\nthe shield: the environment acts upon the organism; that is the other\r\nside. If we are to see life whole we must recognise these two sides of\r\nwhat we call living, and it is missing an important part of the history\r\nof animal life if we fail to see that evolution implies becoming more\r\nadvantageously sensitive to the environment, making more of its\r\ninfluences, shutting out profitless stimuli, and opening more gateways\r\nto knowledge. The bird's world is a larger and finer world than an\r\nearthworm's; the world means more to the bird than to the worm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trial and Error Method\r\n\r\nSimple creatures act with a certain degree of spontaneity on their\r\nenvironment, and they likewise react effectively to surrounding stimuli.\r\nAnimals come to have definite \"answers back,\" sometimes several,\r\nsometimes only one, as in the case of the Slipper Animalcule, which\r\nreverses its cilia when it comes within the sphere of some disturbing\r\ninfluence, retreats, and, turning upon itself tentatively, sets off\r\nagain in the same general direction as before, but at an angle to the\r\nprevious line. If it misses the disturbing influence, well and good; if\r\nit strikes it again, the tactics are repeated until a satisfactory way\r\nout is discovered or the stimulation proves fatal.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the Slipper Animalcule has but one answer to every\r\nquestion, but there are many Protozoa which have several enregistered\r\nreactions. When there are alternative reactions which are tried one\r\nafter another, the animal is pursuing what is called the trial-and-error\r\nmethod, and a higher note is struck.\r\n\r\nThere is an endeavour after satisfaction, and a trial of answers. When\r\nthe creature profits by experience to the extent of giving the right\r\nanswer first, there is the beginning of learning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF A SIMPLE REFLEX ARC IN A BACKBONELESS ANIMAL\r\nLIKE AN EARTHWORM\r\n\r\n1.

Fabre._\r\n\r\nA SPIDER SUNNING HER EGGS\r\n\r\nA kind of spider, called Lycosa, lying head downwards at the edge of her\r\nnest, and holding her silken cocoon--the bag containing the eggs--up\r\ntowards the sun in her hindmost pair of legs. This extraordinary\r\nproceeding is believed to assist in the hatching.]\r\n\r\n\r\nReflex Actions\r\n\r\nAmong simple multicellular animals, such as sea-anemones, we find the\r\nbeginnings of reflex actions, and a considerable part of the behaviour\r\nof the lower animals is reflex. That is to say, there are laid down in\r\nthe animal in the course of its development certain pre-arrangements of\r\nnerve-cells and muscle-cells which secure that a fit and proper answer\r\nis given to a frequently recurrent stimulus. An earthworm half out of\r\nits burrow becomes aware of the light tread of a thrush's foot, and\r\njerks itself back into its hole before anyone can say \"reflex action.\"\r\nWhat is it that happens?\r\n\r\nCertain sensory nerve-cells in the earthworm's skin are stimulated by\r\nvibrations in the earth; the message travels down a sensory nerve-fibre\r\nfrom each of the stimulated cells and enters the nerve-cord. The sensory\r\nfibres come into vital connection with branches of intermediary,\r\nassociative, or communicating cells, which are likewise connected with\r\nmotor nerve-cells. To these the message is thus shunted. From the motor\r\nnerve-cells an impulse or command travels by motor nerve-fibres, one\r\nfrom each cell, to the muscles, which contract. If this took as long to\r\nhappen as it takes to describe, even in outline, it would not be of much\r\nuse to the earthworm. But the motor answer follows the sensory stimulus\r\nalmost instantaneously. The great advantage of establishing or\r\nenregistering these reflex chains is that the answers are practically\r\nready-made or inborn, not requiring to be learned. It is not necessary\r\nthat the brain should be stimulated if there is a brain; nor does the\r\nanimal will to act, though in certain cases it may by means of higher\r\ncontrolling nerve-centres keep the natural reflex response from being\r\ngiven, as happens, for instance, when we control a cough or a sneeze on\r\nsome solemn occasion. The evolutionary method, if we may use the\r\nexpression, has been to enregister ready-made responses; and as we\r\nascend the animal kingdom, we find reflex actions becoming complicated\r\nand often linked together, so that the occurrence of one pulls the\r\ntrigger of another, and so on in a chain. The behaviour of the\r\ninsectivorous plant called Venus's fly-trap when it shuts on an insect\r\nis like a reflex action in an animal, but plants have no definite\r\nnervous system.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are Called Tropisms\r\n\r\nA somewhat higher level on the inclined plane is illustrated by what are\r\ncalled \"tropisms,\" obligatory movements which the animal makes,\r\nadjusting its whole body so that physiological equilibrium results in\r\nrelation to gravity, pressure, currents, moisture, heat, light,\r\nelectricity, and surfaces of contact. A moth is flying past a candle;\r\nthe eye next the light is more illumined than the other; a physiological\r\ninequilibrium results, affecting nerve-cells and muscle-cells; the\r\noutcome is that the moth automatically adjusts its flight so that both\r\neyes become equally illumined; in doing this it often flies into the\r\ncandle.\r\n\r\nIt may seem bad business that the moth should fly into the candle, but\r\nthe flame is an utterly artificial item in its environment to which no\r\none can expect it to be adapted. These tropisms play an important rôle\r\nin animal behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nInstinctive Behaviour\r\n\r\nOn a higher level is instinctive behaviour, which reaches such\r\nremarkable perfection in ants, bees, and wasps. In its typical\r\nexpression instinctive behaviour depends on inborn capacities; it does\r\nnot require to be learned; it is independent of practice or experience,\r\nthough it may be improved by both; it is shared equally by all members\r\nof the species of the same sex (for the female's instincts are often\r\ndifferent from the male's); it refers to particular conditions of life\r\nthat are of vital importance, though they may occur only once in a\r\nlifetime. The female Yucca Moth emerges from the cocoon when the Yucca\r\nflower puts forth its bell-like blossoms. She flies to a flower,\r\ncollects some pollen from the stamens, kneads it into a pill-like ball,\r\nand stows this away under her chin. She flies to an older Yucca flower\r\nand lays her eggs in some of the ovules within the seed-box, but before\r\nshe does so she has to deposit on the stigma the ball of pollen. From\r\nthis the pollen-tubes grow down and the pollen-nucleus of a tube\r\nfertilises the egg-cell in an ovule, so that the possible seeds become\r\nreal seeds, for it is only a fraction of them that the Yucca Moth has\r\ndestroyed by using them as cradles for her eggs. Now it is plain that\r\nthe Yucca Moth has no individual experience of Yucca flowers, yet she\r\nsecures the continuance of her race by a concatenation of actions which\r\nform part of her instinctive repertory.\r\n\r\nFrom a physiological point of view instinctive behaviour is like a chain\r\nof compound reflex actions, but in some cases, at least, there is reason\r\nto believe that the behaviour is suffused with awareness and backed by\r\nendeavour. This is suggested in exceptional cases where the stereotyped\r\nroutine is departed from to meet exceptional conditions. It should also\r\nbe noted that just as ants, hive bees, and wasps exhibit in most cases\r\npurely instinctive behaviour, but move on occasion on the main line of\r\ntrial and error or of experimental initiative, so among birds and\r\nmammals the intelligent behaviour is sometimes replaced by instinctive\r\nroutine. Perhaps there is no instinctive behaviour without a spice of\r\nintelligence, and no intelligent behaviour without an instinctive\r\nelement. The old view that instinctive behaviour was originally\r\nintelligent, and that instinct is \"lapsed intelligence,\" is a tempting\r\none, and is suggested by the way in which habitual intelligent actions\r\ncease in the individual to require intelligent control, but it rests on\r\nthe unproved hypothesis that the acquisitions of the individual can be\r\nentailed on the race. It is almost certain that instinct is on a line of\r\nevolution quite different from intelligence, and that it is nearer to\r\nthe inborn inspirations of the calculating boy or the musical genius\r\nthan to the plodding methods of intelligent learning.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal Intelligence\r\n\r\nThe higher reaches of the inclined plane of behaviour show intelligence\r\nin the strict sense. They include those kinds of behaviour which cannot\r\nbe described without the suggestion that the animal makes some sort of\r\nperceptual inference, not only profiting by experience but learning by\r\nideas. Such intelligent actions show great individual variability; they\r\nare plastic and adjustable in a manner rarely hinted at in connection\r\nwith instincts where routine cannot be departed from without the\r\ncreature being nonplussed; they are not bound up with particular\r\ncircumstances as instinctive actions are, but imply an appreciative\r\nawareness of relations.\r\n\r\nWhen there is an experimenting with general ideas, when there is\r\n_conceptual_ as contrasted with _perceptual_ inference, we speak of\r\nReason, but there is no evidence of this below the level of man. It is\r\nnot, indeed, always that we can credit man with rational conduct, but he\r\nhas the possibility of it ever within his reach.\r\n\r\nAnimal instinct and intelligence will be illustrated in another part of\r\nthis work. We are here concerned simply with the general question of the\r\nevolution of behaviour. There is a main line of tentative experimental\r\nbehaviour both below and above the level of intelligence, and it has\r\nbeen part of the tactics of evolution to bring about the hereditary\r\nenregistration of capacities of effective response, the advantages being\r\nthat the answers come more rapidly and that the creature is left free,\r\nif it chooses, for higher adventures.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt as to the big fact that in the course of evolution\r\nanimals have shown an increasing complexity and masterfulness of\r\nbehaviour, that they have become at once more controlled and more\r\ndefinitely free agents, and that the inner aspect of the\r\nbehaviour--experimenting, learning, thinking, feeling, and willing--has\r\ncome to count for more and more.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nEvolution of Parental Care\r\n\r\nMammals furnish a crowning instance of a trend of evolution which\r\nexpresses itself at many levels--the tendency to bring forth the young\r\nat a well-advanced stage and to an increase of parental care associated\r\nwith a decrease in the number of offspring. There is a British starfish\r\ncalled _Luidia_ which has two hundred millions of eggs in a year, and\r\nthere are said to be several millions of eggs in conger-eels and some\r\nother fishes. These illustrate the spawning method of solving the\r\nproblem of survival. Some animals are naturally prolific, and the number\r\nof eggs which they sow broadcast in the waters allows for enormous\r\ninfantile mortality and obviates any necessity for parental care.\r\n\r\nBut some other creatures, by nature less prolific, have found an\r\nentirely different solution of the problem. They practise parental care\r\nand they secure survival with greatly economised reproduction. This is a\r\ntrend of evolution particularly characteristic of the higher animals. So\r\nmuch so that Herbert Spencer formulated the generalisation that the size\r\nand frequency of the animal family is inverse ratio to the degree of\r\nevolution to which the animal has attained.\r\n\r\nNow there are many different methods of parental care which secure the\r\nsafety of the young, and one of these is called viviparity. The young\r\nones are not liberated from the parent until they are relatively well\r\nadvanced and more or less able to look after themselves. This gives the\r\nyoung a good send-off in life, and their chances of death are greatly\r\nreduced. In other words, the animals that have varied in the direction\r\nof economised reproduction may keep their foothold in the struggle for\r\nexistence if they have varied at the same time in the direction of\r\nparental care. In other cases it may have worked the other way round.\r\n\r\nIn the interesting archaic animal called _Peripatus_, which has to face\r\na modern world too severe for it, one of the methods of meeting the\r\nenvironing difficulties is the retention of the offspring for many\r\nmonths within the mother, so that it is born a fully-formed creature.\r\nThere are only a few offspring at a time, and, although there are\r\nexceptional cases like the summer green-flies, which are very prolific\r\nthough viviparous, the general rule is that viviparity is associated\r\nwith a very small family. The case of flowering plants stands by itself,\r\nfor although they illustrate a kind of viviparity, the seed being\r\nembryos, an individual plant may have a large number of flowers and\r\ntherefore a huge family.\r\n\r\nViviparity naturally finds its best illustrations among terrestrial\r\nanimals, where the risks to the young life are many, and it finds its\r\nclimax among mammals.\r\n\r\nNow it is an interesting fact that the three lowest mammals, the\r\nDuckmole and two Spiny Ant-eaters, lay eggs, i.e. are oviparous; that\r\nthe Marsupials, on the next grade, bring forth their young, as it were,\r\nprematurely, and in most cases stow them away in an external pouch;\r\nwhile all the others--the Placentals--show a more prolonged ante-natal\r\nlife and an intimate partnership between the mother and the unborn\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4\r\n\r\nThere is another way of looking at the sublime process of evolution. It\r\nhas implied a mastery of all the possible haunts of life; it has been a\r\nprogressive conquest of the environment.\r\n\r\n1. It is highly probable that living organisms found their foothold in\r\nthe stimulating conditions of the shore of the sea--the shallow water,\r\nbrightly illumined, seaweed-growing shelf fringing the Continents. This\r\nlittoral zone was a propitious environment where sea and fresh water,\r\nearth and air all meet, where there is stimulating change, abundant\r\noxygenation and a copious supply of nutritive material in what the\r\nstreams bring down and in the rich seaweed vegetation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOATZIN INHABITS BRITISH GUIANA\r\n\r\nThe newly hatched bird has claws on its thumb and first finger and so is\r\nenabled to climb on the branches of trees with great dexterity until\r\nsuch time as the wings are strong enough to sustain it in flight.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photograph, from the British Museum (Natural History),\r\nof a drawing by Mr. E.

The open-sea or pelagic haunt includes all the brightly illumined\r\nsurface waters beyond the shallow water of the shore area.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps the easiest of all the haunts of life, for there is no\r\ncrowding, there is considerable uniformity, and an abundance of food for\r\nanimals is afforded by the inexhaustible floating \"sea-meadows\" of\r\nmicroscopic Algæ. These are reincarnated in minute animals like the\r\nopen-sea crustaceans, which again are utilised by fishes, these in turn\r\nmaking life possible for higher forms like carnivorous turtles and\r\ntoothed whales. It is quite possible that the open sea was the original\r\ncradle of life and perhaps Professor Church is right in picturing a long\r\nperiod of pelagic life before there was any sufficiently shallow water\r\nto allow the floating plants to anchor. It is rather in favour of this\r\nview that many shore animals such as crabs and starfishes, spend their\r\nyouthful stages in the relatively safe cradle of the open sea, and only\r\nreturn to the more strenuous conditions of their birthplace after they\r\nhave gained considerable strength of body. It is probably safe to say\r\nthat the honour of being the original cradle of life lies between the\r\nshore of the sea and the open sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Deeps\r\n\r\n3. A third haunt of life is the floor of the Deep Sea, the abyssal area,\r\nwhich occupies more than a half of the surface of the globe. It is a\r\nregion of extreme cold--an eternal winter; of utter darkness--an eternal\r\nnight--relieved only by the fitful gleams of \"phosphorescent\" animals;\r\nof enormous pressure--2-1/2 tons on the square inch at a depth of 2,500\r\nfathoms; of profound calm, unbroken silence, immense monotony. And as\r\nthere are no plants in the great abysses, the animals must live on one\r\nanother, and, in the long run, on the rain of moribund animalcules which\r\nsink from the surface through the miles of water. It seems a very\r\nunpromising haunt of life, but it is abundantly tenanted, and it gives\r\nus a glimpse of the insurgent nature of the living creature that the\r\ndifficulties of the Deep Sea should have been so effectively conquered.\r\nIt is probable that the colonising of the great abysses took place in\r\nrelatively recent times, for the fauna does not include many very\r\nantique types. It is practically certain that the colonisation was due\r\nto littoral animals which followed the food-débris, millennium after\r\nmillennium, further and further down the long slope from the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Freshwaters\r\n\r\n4. A fourth haunt of life is that of the freshwaters, including river\r\nand lake, pond and pool, swamp and marsh. It may have been colonised by\r\ngradual migration up estuaries and rivers, or by more direct passage\r\nfrom the seashore into the brackish swamp. Or it may have been in some\r\ncases that partially landlocked corners of ancient seas became gradually\r\nturned into freshwater basins. The animal population of the freshwaters\r\nis very representative, and is diversely adapted to meet the\r\ncharacteristic contingencies--the risk of being dried up, the risk of\r\nbeing frozen hard in winter, and the risk of being left high and dry\r\nafter floods or of being swept down to the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nConquest of the Dry Land\r\n\r\n5. The terrestrial haunt has been invaded age after age by contingents\r\nfrom the sea or from the freshwaters. We must recognise the worm\r\ninvasion, which led eventually to the making of the fertile soil, the\r\ninvasion due to air-breathing Arthropods, which led eventually to the\r\nimportant linkage between flowers and their insect visitors, and the\r\ninvasion due to air-breathing Amphibians, which led eventually to the\r\nhigher terrestrial animals and to the development of intelligence and\r\nfamily affection. Besides these three great invasions, there were minor\r\nones such as that leading to land-snails, for there has been a\r\nwidespread and persistent tendency among aquatic animals to try to\r\npossess the dry land.\r\n\r\nGetting on to dry land had a manifold significance.\r\n\r\nIt implied getting into a medium with a much larger supply of oxygen\r\nthan there is dissolved in the water. But the oxygen of the air is more\r\ndifficult to capture, especially when the skin becomes hard or well\r\nprotected, as it is almost bound to become in animals living on dry\r\nground. Thus this leads to the development of _internal surfaces_, such\r\nas those of lungs, where the oxygen taken into the body may be absorbed\r\nby the blood. In most animals the blood goes to the surface of\r\noxygen-capture; but in insects and their relatives there is a different\r\nidea--of taking the air to the blood or in greater part to the area of\r\noxygen-combustion, the living tissues. A system of branching air-tubes\r\ntakes air into every hole and corner of the insect's body, and this\r\nthorough aeration is doubtless in part the secret of the insect's\r\nintense activity. The blood never becomes impure.\r\n\r\nThe conquest of the dry land also implied a predominance of that kind of\r\nlocomotion which may be compared to punting, when the body is pushed\r\nalong by pressing a lever against a hard substratum. And it also\r\nfollowed that with few exceptions the body of the terrestrial animal\r\ntended to be compact, readily lifted off the ground by the limbs or\r\nadjusted in some other way so that there may not be too large a surface\r\ntrailing on the ground. An animal like a jellyfish, easily supported in\r\nthe water, would be impossible on land. Such apparent exceptions as\r\nearthworms, centipedes, and snakes are not difficult to explain, for the\r\nearthworm is a burrower which eats its way through the soil, the\r\ncentipede's long body is supported by numerous hard legs, and the snake\r\npushes itself along by means of the large ventral scales to which the\r\nlower ends of very numerous ribs are attached.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethods of Mastering the Difficulties of Terrestrial Life\r\n\r\nA great restriction attendant on the invasion of the dry land is that\r\nlocomotion becomes limited to one plane, namely, the surface of the\r\nearth. This is in great contrast to what is true in the water, where the\r\nanimal can move up or down, to right or to left, at any angle and in\r\nthree dimensions. It surely follows from this that the movements of land\r\nanimals must be rapid and precise, unless, indeed, safety is secured in\r\nsome other way. Hence it is easy to understand why most land animals\r\nhave very finely developed striped muscles, and why a beetle running on\r\nthe ground has far more numerous muscles than a lobster swimming in the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nLand animals were also handicapped by the risks of drought and of frost,\r\nbut these were met by defences of the most diverse description, from the\r\nhairs of woolly caterpillars to the fur of mammals, from the carapace of\r\ntortoises to the armour of armadillos. In other cases, it is hardly\r\nnecessary to say, the difficulties may be met in other ways, as frogs\r\nmeet the winter by falling into a lethargic state in some secluded\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence of getting on to dry land is that the eggs or young\r\ncan no longer be set free anyhow, as is possible when the animal is\r\nsurrounded by water, which is in itself more or less of a cradle. If the\r\neggs were laid or the young liberated on dry ground, the chances are\r\nmany that they would be dried up or devoured. So there are numerous ways\r\nin which land animals secure the safety of their young, e.g. by burying\r\nthem in the ground, or by hiding them in nests, or by carrying them\r\nabout for a prolonged period either before or after birth. This may mean\r\ngreat safety for the young, this may make it possible to have only a\r\nsmall family, and this may tend to the evolution of parental care and\r\nthe kindly emotions. Thus it may be understood that from the conquest of\r\nthe land many far-reaching consequences have followed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Rischgitz._\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY (1825-95)\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinguished of zoologists, with unsurpassed gifts as a\r\nteacher and expositor.

It may be asked, perhaps, why\r\nthe land should have been colonised at all when the risks and\r\ndifficulties are so great. The answer must be that necessity and\r\ncuriosity are the mother and father of invention. Animals left the water\r\nbecause the pools dried up, or because they were overcrowded, or because\r\nof inveterate enemies, but also because of that curiosity and spirit of\r\nadventure which, from first to last, has been one of the spurs of\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\r\nConquering the Air\r\n\r\n6. The last great haunt of life is the air, a mastery of which must be\r\nplaced to the credit of insects, Pterodactyls, birds, and bats. These\r\nhave been the successes, but it should be noted that there have been\r\nmany brilliant failures, which have not attained to much more than\r\nparachuting. These include the Flying Fishes, which take leaps from the\r\nwater and are carried for many yards and to considerable heights,\r\nholding their enlarged pectoral fins taut or with little more than a\r\nslight fluttering. There is a so-called Flying Frog (_Rhacophorus_) that\r\nskims from branch to branch, and the much more effective Flying Dragon\r\n(_Draco volans_) of the Far East, which has been mentioned already.\r\nAmong mammals there are Flying Phalangers, Flying Lemurs, and more\r\nbesides, all attaining to great skill as parachutists, and illustrating\r\nthe endeavour to master the air which man has realised in a way of his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThe power of flight brings obvious advantages. A bird feeding on the\r\nground is able to evade the stalking carnivore by suddenly rising into\r\nthe air; food and water can be followed rapidly and to great distances;\r\nthe eggs or the young can be placed in safe situations; and birds in\r\ntheir migrations have made a brilliant conquest both of time and space.\r\nMany of them know no winter in their year, and the migratory flight of\r\nthe Pacific Golden Plover from Hawaii to Alaska and back again does not\r\nstand alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROCESSION OF LIFE THROUGH THE AGES\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nThe Rock Record\r\n\r\nHow do we know when the various classes of animals and plants were\r\nestablished on the earth? How do we know the order of their appearance\r\nand the succession of their advances? The answer is: by reading the Rock\r\nRecord. In the course of time the crust of the earth has been elevated\r\ninto continents and depressed into ocean-troughs, and the surface of the\r\nland has been buckled up into mountain ranges and folded in gentler\r\nhills and valleys. The high places of the land have been weathered by\r\nair and water in many forms, and the results of the weathering have been\r\nborne away by rivers and seas, to be laid down again elsewhere as\r\ndeposits which eventually formed sandstones, mudstones, and similar\r\nsedimentary rocks. Much of the material of the original crust has thus\r\nbeen broken down and worked up again many times over, and if the total\r\nthickness of the sedimentary rocks is added up it amounts, according to\r\nsome geologists, to a total of 67 miles. In most cases, however, only a\r\nsmall part of this thickness is to be seen in one place, for the\r\ndeposits were usually formed in limited areas at any one time.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Use of Fossils\r\n\r\nWhen the sediments were accumulating age after age, it naturally came\r\nabout that remains of the plants and animals living at the time were\r\nburied, and these formed the fossils by the aid of which it is possible\r\nto read the story of the past. By careful piecing together of evidence\r\nthe geologist is able to determine the order in which the different\r\nsedimentary rocks were laid down, and thus to say, for instance, that\r\nthe Devonian period was the time of the origin of Amphibians. In other\r\ncases the geologist utilises the fossils in his attempt to work out the\r\norder of the strata when these have been much disarranged. For the\r\nsimpler fossil forms of any type must be older than those that are more\r\ncomplex. There is no vicious circle here, for the general succession of\r\nstrata is clear, and it is quite certain that there were fishes before\r\nthere were amphibians, and amphibians before there were reptiles, and\r\nreptiles before there were birds and mammals. In certain cases, e.g. of\r\nfossil horses and elephants, the actual historical succession has been\r\nclearly worked out.\r\n\r\nIf the successive strata contained good samples of all the plants and\r\nanimals living at the time when the beds were formed, then it would be\r\neasy to read the record of the rocks, but many animals were too soft to\r\nbecome satisfactory fossils, many were eaten or dissolved away, many\r\nwere destroyed by heat and pressure, so that the rock record is like a\r\nlibrary very much damaged by fire and looting and decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nThe Geological Time-table\r\n\r\nThe long history of the earth and its inhabitants is conveniently\r\ndivided into eras. Thus, just as we speak of the ancient, mediæval, and\r\nmodern history of mankind, so we may speak of Palæozoic, Mesozoic and\r\nCenozoic eras in the history of the earth as a whole.\r\n\r\nGeologists cannot tell us except in an approximate way how long the\r\nprocess of evolution has taken. One of the methods is to estimate how\r\nlong has been required for the accumulation of the salts of the sea,\r\nfor all these have been dissolved out of the rocks since rain began to\r\nfall on the earth. Dividing the total amount of saline matter by what is\r\ncontributed every year in modern times, we get about a hundred million\r\nyears as the age of the sea. But as the present rate of\r\nsalt-accumulation is probably much greater than it was during many of\r\nthe geological periods, the prodigious age just mentioned is in all\r\nlikelihood far below the mark. Another method is to calculate how long\r\nit would take to form the sedimentary rocks, like sandstones and\r\nmudstones, which have a _total_ thickness of over fifty miles, though\r\nthe _local_ thickness is rarely over a mile. As most of the materials\r\nhave come from the weathering of the earth's crust, and as the annual\r\namount of weathering now going on can be estimated, the time required\r\nfor the formation of the sedimentary rocks of the world can be\r\napproximately calculated. There are some other ways of trying to tell\r\nthe earth's age and the length of the successive periods, but no\r\ncertainty has been reached.\r\n\r\nThe eras marked on the table (page 92) as _before the Cambrian_\r\ncorrespond to about thirty-two miles of thickness of strata; and all the\r\nsubsequent eras with fossil-bearing rocks to a thickness of about\r\ntwenty-one miles--in itself an astounding fact. Perhaps thirty million\r\nyears must be allotted to the Pre-Cambrian eras, eighteen to the\r\nPalæozoic, nine to the Mesozoic, three to the Cenozoic, making a grand\r\ntotal of sixty millions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Establishment of Invertebrate Stocks\r\n\r\nIt is an astounding fact that at least half of geological time (the\r\nArchæozoic and Proterozoic eras) passed before there were living\r\ncreatures with parts sufficiently hard to form fossils. In the latter\r\npart of the Proterozoic era there are traces of one-celled marine\r\nanimals (Radiolarians) with shells of flint, and of worms that wallowed\r\nin the primal mud. It is plain that as regards the most primitive\r\ncreatures the rock record tells us little.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From Knipe's \"Nebula to Man.\"_\r\n\r\nANIMALS OF THE CAMBRIAN PERIOD e.g. Sponges, Jellyfish, Starfish,\r\nSea-lilies, Water-fleas, and Trilobites]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: J.

They were able to roll themselves up in\r\ntheir ring-armour.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: British Museum (Natural History)._\r\n\r\nTHE GAMBIAN MUD-FISH, PROTOPTERUS\r\n\r\nIt can breathe oxygen dissolved in water by its gills; it can also\r\nbreathe dry air by means of its swim-bladder, which has become a lung.\r\nIt is a _double-breather_, showing evolution in process.

Mud-nests or mud encasements with the\r\nlung-fish inside have often been brought to Britain and the fish when\r\nliberated were quite lively.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARCHÆOPTERYX\r\n\r\n(_After William Leche of Stockholm._)\r\n\r\nA good restoration of the oldest known bird, Archæopteryx (Jurassic\r\nEra). It was about the size of a crow; it had teeth on both jaws; it had\r\nclaws on the thumb and two fingers; and it had a long lizard-like tail.\r\nBut it had feathers, proving itself a true bird.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WING OF A BIRD, SHOWING THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE FEATHERS\r\n\r\nThe longest feathers or primaries (PR) are borne by the two fingers (2\r\nand 3), and their palm-bones (CMC); the second longest or secondaries\r\nare borne by the ulna bone (U) of the fore-arm; there is a separate tuft\r\n(AS) on the thumb (TH).]\r\n\r\nThe rarity of direct traces of life in the oldest rocks is partly due to\r\nthe fact that the primitive animals would be of delicate build, but it\r\nmust also be remembered that the ancient rocks have been profoundly and\r\nrepeatedly changed by pressure and heat, so that the traces which did\r\nexist would be very liable to obliteration. And if it be asked what\r\nright we have to suppose the presence of living creatures in the absence\r\nor extreme rarity of fossils, we must point to great accumulations of\r\nlimestone which indicate the existence of calcareous algæ, and to\r\ndeposits of iron which probably indicate the activity of iron-forming\r\nBacteria. Ancient beds of graphite similarly suggest that green plants\r\nflourished in these ancient days.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nThe Era of Ancient Life (Palæozoic)\r\n\r\nThe _Cambrian_ period was the time of the establishment of the chief\r\nstocks of backboneless animals such as sponges, jellyfishes, worms,\r\nsea-cucumbers, lamp-shells, trilobites, crustaceans, and molluscs. There\r\nis something very eloquent in the broad fact that the peopling of the\r\nseas had definitely begun some thirty million years ago, for Professor\r\nH. F. Osborn points out that in the Cambrian period there was already a\r\ncolonisation of the shore of the sea, the open sea, and the deep waters.\r\n\r\nThe _Ordovician_ period was marked by abundant representation of the\r\nonce very successful class of Trilobites--jointed-footed,\r\nantenna-bearing, segmented marine animals, with numerous appendages and\r\na covering of chitin. They died away entirely with the end of the\r\nPalæozoic era. Also very notable was the abundance of predatory\r\ncuttlefishes, the bullies of the ancient seas. But it was in this period\r\nthat the first backboned animals made their appearance--an epoch-making\r\nstep in evolution. In other words, true fishes were evolved--destined in\r\nthe course of ages to replace the cuttlefishes (which are mere molluscs)\r\nin dominating the seas.\r\n\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n _RECENT TIMES_                            Human civilisation.\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n                      {PLEISTOCENE OR GLACIAL TIME Last great Ice Age.\r\n _CENOZOIC ERA_       {MIOCENE AND PLIOCENE TIMES  Emergence of Man.\r\n                      {EOCENE AND OLIGOCENE TIMES  Rise of higher mammals.\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n                      {CRETACEOUS PERIOD    Rise of primitive mammals,\r\n                      {                      flowering plants,\r\n                      {                      and higher insects.\r\n _MESOZOIC ERA_       {JURASSIC PERIOD      Rise of birds and flying\r\n                      {                      reptiles.\r\n                      {TRIASSIC PERIOD      Rise of dinosaur reptiles.\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n                      {PERMIAN PERIOD       Rise of reptiles.\r\n                      {CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD Rise of insects.\r\n                      {DEVONIAN PERIOD      First amphibians.\r\n _PALÆOZOIC ERA_      {SILURIAN PERIOD      Land animals began.\r\n                      {ORDOVICIAN PERIOD    First fishes.\r\n                      {CAMBRIAN PERIOD      Peopling of the sea.\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n _PROTEROZOIC AGES_   Many of the Backboneless stocks began.\r\n _ARCHÆOZOIC AGES_    Living creatures began to be upon the earth.\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n                      {Making of continents and ocean-basins.\r\n                      {Beginnings of atmosphere and hydrosphere.\r\n _FORMATIVE TIMES_    {Cooling of the earth.\r\n                      {Establishment of the solar system.\r\n _______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nIn the _Silurian_ period in which the peopling of the seas went on\r\napace, there was the first known attempt at colonising the dry land. For\r\nin Silurian rocks there are fossil scorpions, and that implies ability\r\nto breathe dry air--by means of internal surfaces, in this case known as\r\nlungbooks. It was also towards the end of the Silurian, when a period of\r\ngreat aridity set in, that fishes appeared related to our mud-fishes or\r\ndouble-breathers (Dipnoi), which have lungs as well as gills. This,\r\nagain, meant utilising dry air, just as the present-day mud-fishes do\r\nwhen the water disappears from the pools in hot weather. The lung-fishes\r\nor mud-fishes of to-day are but three in number, one in Queensland, one\r\nin South America, and one in Africa, but they are extremely\r\ninteresting \"living fossils,\" binding the class of fishes to that of\r\namphibians. It is highly probable that the first invasion of the dry\r\nland should be put to the credit of some adventurous worms, but the\r\nsecond great invasion was certainly due to air-breathing Arthropods,\r\nlike the pioneer scorpion we mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PICTORIAL REPRESENTATION OF THE SUCCESSIVE STRATA OF THE\r\nEARTH'S CRUST, WITH SUGGESTIONS OF CHARACTERISTIC FOSSILS\r\n\r\nE.g. Fish and Trilobite in the Devonian (red), a large Amphibian in the\r\nCarboniferous (blue), Reptiles in Permian (light red), the first Mammal\r\nin the Triassic (blue), the first Bird in the Jurassic (yellow), Giant\r\nReptiles in the Cretaceous (white), then follow the Tertiary strata with\r\nprogressive mammals, and Quaternary at the top with man and mammoth.]\r\n\r\nThe _Devonian_ period, including that of the Old Red Sandstone, was one\r\nof the most significant periods in the earth's history. For it was the\r\ntime of the establishment of flowering plants upon the earth and of\r\nterrestrial backboned animals. One would like to have been the\r\ndiscoverer of the Devonian foot-print of _Thinopus_, the first known\r\nAmphibian foot-print--an eloquent vestige of the third great invasion of\r\nthe dry land. It was probably from a stock of Devonian lung-fishes that\r\nthe first Amphibians sprang, but it was not till the next period that\r\nthey came to their own. While they were still feeling their way, there\r\nwas a remarkable exuberance of shark-like and heavily armoured fishes in\r\nthe Devonian seas.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION OF LAND ANIMALS\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nGiant Amphibians and Coal-measures\r\n\r\nThe _Carboniferous_ period was marked by a mild moist climate and a\r\nluxuriant vegetation in the swampy low grounds. It was a much less\r\nstrenuous time than the Devonian period; it was like a very long summer.\r\nThere were no trees of the type we see now, but there were forests of\r\nclub-mosses and horsetails which grew to a gigantic size compared with\r\ntheir pigmy representatives of to-day. In these forests the\r\njointed-footed invaders of the dry land ran riot in the form of\r\ncentipedes, spiders, scorpions, and insects, and on these the primeval\r\nAmphibians fed. The appearance of insects made possible a new linkage of\r\nfar-reaching importance, namely, the cross-fertilisation of flowering\r\nplants by their insect visitors, and from this time onwards it may be\r\nsaid that flowers and their visitors have evolved hand in hand.\r\nCross-fertilisation is much surer by insects than by the wind, and\r\ncross-fertilisation is more advantageous than self-fertilisation because\r\nit promotes both fertility and plasticity. It was probably in this\r\nperiod that _coloured_ flowers--attractive to insect-visitors--began to\r\njustify themselves as beauty became useful, and began to relieve the\r\nmonotonous green of the horsetail and club-moss forests, which covered\r\ngreat tracts of the earth for millions of years. In the Carboniferous\r\nforests there were also land-snails, representing one of the minor\r\ninvasions of the dry land, tending on the whole to check vegetation.\r\nThey, too, were probably preyed upon by the Amphibians, some of which\r\nattained a large size. Each age has had its giants, and those of the\r\nCarboniferous were Amphibians called Labyrinthodonts, some of which were\r\nalmost as big as donkeys. It need hardly be said that it was in this\r\nperiod that most of the Coal-measures were laid down by the immense\r\naccumulation of the spores and debris of the club-moss forests. Ages\r\nafterwards, it was given to man to tap this great source of\r\nenergy--traceable back to the sunshine of millions of years ago. Even\r\nthen it was true that no plant or animal lives or dies to itself!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Acquisitions of Amphibians.\r\n\r\nAs Amphibians had their Golden Age in the Carboniferous period we may\r\nfitly use this opportunity of indicating the advances in evolution which\r\nthe emergence of Amphibians implied. (1) In the first place the passage\r\nfrom water to dry land was the beginning of a higher and more promiseful\r\nlife, taxed no doubt by increased difficulties. The natural question\r\nrises why animals should have migrated from water to dry land at all\r\nwhen great difficulties were involved in the transition. The answers\r\nmust be: (_a_) that local drying up of water-basins or elevations of the\r\nland surface often made the old haunts untenable; (_b_) that there may\r\nhave been great congestion and competition in the old quarters; and\r\n(_c_) that there has been an undeniable endeavour after well-being\r\nthroughout the history of animal life. In the same way with mankind,\r\nmigrations were prompted by the setting in of prolonged drought, by\r\nover-population, and by the spirit of adventure. (2) In Amphibians for\r\nthe first time the non-digitate paired fins of fishes were replaced by\r\nlimbs with fingers and toes. This implied an advantageous power of\r\ngrasping, of holding firm, of putting food into the mouth, of feeling\r\nthings in three dimensions. (3) We cannot be positive in regard to the\r\nsoft parts of the ancient Amphibians known only as fossils, but if they\r\nwere in a general way like the frogs and toads, newts and salamanders of\r\nthe present day, we may say that they made among other acquisitions the\r\nfollowing: true ventral lungs, a three-chambered heart, a movable\r\ntongue, a drum to the ear, and lids to the eyes. It is very interesting\r\nto find that though the tongue of the tadpole has some muscle-fibres in\r\nit, they are not strong enough to effect movement, recalling the tongue\r\nof fishes, which has not any muscles at all. Gradually, as the tadpole\r\nbecomes a frog, the muscle-fibres grow in strength, and make it possible\r\nfor the full-grown creature to shoot out its tongue upon insects. This\r\nis probably a recapitulation of what was accomplished in the course of\r\nmillennia in the history of the Amphibian race. (4) Another acquisition\r\nmade by Amphibians was a voice, due, as in ourselves, to the rapid\r\npassage of air over taut membranes (vocal cords) stretched in the\r\nlarynx. It is an interesting fact that for millions of years there was\r\nupon the earth no sound of life at all, only the noise of wind and wave,\r\nthunder and avalanche. Apart from the instrumental music of some\r\ninsects, perhaps beginning in the Carboniferous, the first vital sounds\r\nwere due to Amphibians, and theirs certainly was the first voice--surely\r\none of the great steps in organic evolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: British Museum (Natural History)._\r\n\r\nFOSSIL OF A PTERODACTYL OR EXTINCT FLYING DRAGON\r\n\r\nThe wing is made of a web of skin extended on the enormously elongated\r\noutermost finger.

But, as\r\nin many other cases, its brain was so small that it could have passed\r\ndown the spinal canal in which the spinal cord lies. Perhaps this partly\r\naccounts for the extinction of giant reptiles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: \"Daily Mail.\"_\r\n\r\nTHE DUCKMOLE OR DUCK-BILLED PLATYPUS OF AUSTRALIA\r\n\r\nThe Duckmole or Duck-billed Platypus of Australia is a survivor of the\r\nmost primitive mammals. It harks back to reptiles, e.g. in being an\r\negg-layer, in having comparatively large eggs, and in being imperfectly\r\nwarm-blooded. It swims well and feeds on small water-animals. It can\r\nalso burrow.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEvolution of the Voice\r\n\r\nThe first use of the voice was probably that indicated by our frogs and\r\ntoads--it serves as a sex-call. That is the meaning of the trumpeting\r\nwith which frogs herald the spring, and it is often only in the males\r\nthat the voice is well developed. But if we look forward, past\r\nAmphibians altogether, we find the voice becoming a maternal call\r\nhelping to secure the safety of the young--a use very obvious when young\r\nbirds squat motionless at the sound of the parent's danger-note. Later\r\non, probably, the voice became an infantile call, as when the unhatched\r\ncrocodile pipes from within the deeply buried egg, signalling to the\r\nmother that it is time to be unearthed. Higher still the voice expresses\r\nemotion, as in the song of birds, often outside the limits of the\r\nbreeding time. Later still, particular sounds become words, signifying\r\nparticular things or feelings, such as \"food,\" \"danger,\" \"home,\"\r\n\"anger,\" and \"joy.\" Finally words become a medium of social intercourse\r\nand as symbols help to make it possible for man to reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nThe Early Reptiles\r\n\r\nIn the _Permian_ period reptiles appeared, or perhaps one should say,\r\nbegan to assert themselves. That is to say, there was an emergence of\r\nbackboned animals which were free from water and relinquished the method\r\nof breathing by gills, which Amphibians retained in their young stages\r\nat least. The unhatched or unborn reptile breathes by means of a\r\nvascular hood spread underneath the egg-shell and absorbing dry air from\r\nwithout. It is an interesting point that this vascular hood, called the\r\nallantois, is represented in the Amphibians by an unimportant bladder\r\ngrowing out from the hind end of the food-canal. A great step in\r\nevolution was implied in the origin of this ante-natal hood or foetal\r\nmembrane and another one--of protective significance--called the amnion,\r\nwhich forms a water-bag over the delicate embryo. The step meant total\r\nemancipation from the water and from gill-breathing, and the two\r\nfoetal membranes, the amnion and the allantois, persist not only in\r\nall reptiles but in birds and mammals as well. These higher Vertebrates\r\nare therefore called Amniota in contrast to the Lower Vertebrates or\r\nAnamnia (the Amphibians, Fishes, and primitive types).\r\n\r\nIt is a suggestive fact that the embryos of all reptiles, birds, and\r\nmammals show gill-clefts--_a tell-tale evidence of their distant aquatic\r\nancestry_. But these embryonic gill-clefts are not used for respiration\r\nand show no trace of gills except in a few embryonic reptiles and birds\r\nwhere their dwindled vestiges have been recently discovered. As to the\r\ngill-clefts, they are of no use in higher Vertebrates except that the\r\nfirst becomes the Eustachian tube leading from the ear-passage to the\r\nback of the mouth. The reason why they persist when only one is of any\r\nuse, and that in a transformed guise, would be difficult to interpret\r\nexcept in terms of the Evolution theory. They illustrate the lingering\r\ninfluence of a long pedigree, the living hand of the past, the tendency\r\nthat individual development has to recapitulate racial evolution. In a\r\ncondensed and telescoped manner, of course, for what took the race a\r\nmillion years may be recapitulated by the individual in a week!\r\n\r\nIn the Permian period the warm moist climate of most of the\r\nCarboniferous period was replaced by severe conditions, culminating in\r\nan Ice Age which spread from the Southern Hemisphere throughout the\r\nworld. With this was associated a waning of the Carboniferous flora, and\r\nthe appearance of a new one, consisting of ferns, conifers, ginkgos, and\r\ncycads, which persisted until near the end of the Mesozoic era. The\r\nPermian Ice Age lasted for millions of years, and was most severe in the\r\nFar South. Of course, it was a very different world then, for North\r\nEurope was joined to North America, Africa to South America, and\r\nAustralia to Asia. It was probably during the Permian Ice Age that many\r\nof the insects divided their life-history into two main chapters--the\r\nfeeding, growing, moulting, immature, larval stages, e.g. caterpillars,\r\nand the more ascetic, non-growing, non-moulting, winged phase, adapted\r\nfor reproduction. Between these there intervened the quiescent,\r\nwell-protected pupa stage or chrysalis, probably adapted to begin with\r\nas a means of surviving the severe winter. For it is easier for an\r\nanimal to survive when the vital processes are more or less in abeyance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisappearance of many Ancient Types\r\n\r\nWe cannot leave the last period of the Palæozoic era and its prolonged\r\nice age without noticing that it meant the entire cessation of a large\r\nnumber of ancient types, especially among plants and backboneless\r\nanimals, which now disappear for ever. It is necessary to understand\r\nthat the animals of ancient days stand in three different relations to\r\nthose of to-day. (_a_) There are ancient types that have living\r\nrepresentatives, sometimes few and sometimes many, sometimes much\r\nchanged and sometimes but slightly changed. The lamp-shell,\r\n_Lingulella_, of the Cambrian and Ordovician period has a very near\r\nrelative in the _Lingula_ of to-day. There are a few extremely\r\nconservative animals. (_b_) There are ancient types which have no living\r\nrepresentatives, except in the guise of transformed descendants, as the\r\nKing-crab (_Limulus_) may be said to be a transformed descendant of the\r\notherwise quite extinct race to which Eurypterids or Sea-scorpions\r\nbelonged. (_c_) There are altogether extinct types--_lost races_--which\r\nhave left not a wrack behind. For there is not any representation to-day\r\nof such races as Graptolites and Trilobites.\r\n\r\nLooking backwards over the many millions of years comprised in the\r\nPalæozoic era, what may we emphasise as the most salient features? There\r\nwas in the _Cambrian_ the establishment of the chief classes of\r\nbackboneless animals; in the _Ordovician_ the first fishes and perhaps\r\nthe first terrestrial plants; in the _Silurian_ the emergence of\r\nair-breathing Invertebrates and mud-fishes; in the _Devonian_ the\r\nappearance of the first Amphibians, from which all higher land animals\r\nare descended, and the establishment of a land flora; in the\r\n_Carboniferous_ the great Club-moss forests and an exuberance of\r\nair-breathing insects and their allies; in the _Permian_ the first\r\nreptiles and a new flora.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic Era\r\n\r\nIn a broad way the Mesozoic era corresponds with the Golden Age of\r\nreptiles, and with the climax of the Conifer and Cycad flora, which was\r\nestablished in the Permian. But among the Conifers and Cycads our modern\r\nflowering plants were beginning to show face tentatively, just like\r\nbirds and mammals among the great reptiles.\r\n\r\nIn the _Triassic_ period the exuberance of reptilian life which marked\r\nthe Permian was continued. Besides Turtles which still persist, there\r\nwere Ichthyosaurs, Plesiosaurs, Dinosaurs, and Pterosaurs, none of which\r\nlasted beyond the Mesozoic era. Of great importance was the rise of the\r\nDinosaurs in the Triassic, for it is highly probable that within the\r\nlimits of this vigorous and plastic stock--some of them bipeds--we must\r\nlook for the ancestors of both birds and mammals. Both land and water\r\nwere dominated by reptiles, some of which attained to gigantic size. Had\r\nthere been any zoologist in those days, he would have been very\r\nsagacious indeed if he had suspected that reptiles did not represent the\r\nclimax of creation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flying Dragons\r\n\r\nThe _Jurassic_ period showed a continuance of the reptilian splendour.\r\nThey radiated in many directions, becoming adapted to many haunts. Thus\r\nthere were many Fish Lizards paddling in the seas, many types of\r\nterrestrial dragons stalking about on land, many swiftly gliding\r\nalligator-like forms, and the Flying Dragons which began in the Triassic\r\nattained to remarkable success and variety. Their wing was formed by the\r\nextension of a great fold of skin on the enormously elongated outermost\r\nfinger, and they varied from the size of a sparrow to a spread of over\r\nfive feet. A soldering of the dorsal vertebræ as in our Flying Birds was\r\nan adaptation to striking the air with some force, but as there is not\r\nmore than a slight keel, if any, on the breast-bone, it is unlikely that\r\nthey could fly far. For we know from our modern birds that the power of\r\nflight may be to some extent gauged from the degree of development of\r\nthe keel, which is simply a great ridge for the better insertion of the\r\nmuscles of flight. It is absent, of course, in the Running Birds, like\r\nthe ostrich, and it has degenerated in an interesting way in the\r\nburrowing parrot (_Stringops_) and a few other birds that have \"gone\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Known Bird\r\n\r\nBut the Jurassic is particularly memorable because its strata have\r\nyielded two fine specimens of the first known bird, _Archæopteryx_.\r\nThese were entombed in the deposits which formed the fine-grained\r\nlithographic stones of Bavaria, and practically every bone in the body\r\nis preserved except the breast-bone. Even the feathers have left their\r\nmarks with distinctness. This oldest known bird--too far advanced to be\r\nthe first bird--was about the size of a crow and was probably of\r\narboreal habits. Of great interest are its reptilian features, so\r\npronounced that one cannot evade the evolutionist suggestion. It had\r\nteeth in both jaws, which no modern bird has; it had a long lizard-like\r\ntail, which no modern bird has; it had claws on three fingers, and a\r\nsort of half-made wing. That is to say, it does not show, what all\r\nmodern birds show, a fusion of half the wrist-bones with the whole of\r\nthe palm-bones, the well-known carpo-metacarpus bone which forms a basis\r\nfor the longest pinions. In many reptiles, such as Crocodiles, there are\r\npeculiar bones running across the abdomen beneath the skin, the\r\nso-called \"abdominal ribs,\" and it seems an eloquent detail to find\r\nthese represented in _Archæopteryx_, the earliest known bird. No modern\r\nbird shows any trace of them. [Illustration: SKELETON OF AN EXTINCT\r\nFLIGHTLESS TOOTHED BIRD, HESPERORNIS\r\n\r\n(_After Marsh._)\r\n\r\nThe bird was five or six feet high, something like a swimming ostrich,\r\nwith a very powerful leg but only a vestige of a wing. There were sharp\r\nteeth in a groove. The modern divers come nearest to this ancient\r\ntype.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIX STAGES IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE HORSE, SHOWING GRADUAL\r\nINCREASE IN SIZE\r\n\r\n(_After Lull and Matthew._)\r\n\r\n1.

Pliocene, N. America.\r\n\r\n6. The modern horse, running on the third digit of each foot.]\r\n\r\nThere is no warrant for supposing that the flying reptiles or\r\nPterodactyls gave rise to birds, for the two groups are on different\r\nlines, and the structure of the wings is entirely different. Thus the\r\nlong-fingered Pterodactyl wing was a parachute wing, while the secret of\r\nthe bird's wing has its centre in the feathers. It is highly probable\r\nthat birds evolved from certain Dinosaurs which had become bipeds, and\r\nit is possible that they were for a time swift runners that took \"flying\r\njumps\" along the ground. Thereafter, perhaps, came a period of arboreal\r\napprenticeship during which there was much gliding from tree to tree\r\nbefore true flight was achieved. It is an interesting fact that the\r\nproblem of flight has been solved four times among animals--by insects,\r\nby Pterodactyls, by birds, and by bats; and that the four solutions are\r\non entirely different lines.\r\n\r\nIn the _Cretaceous_ period the outstanding events included the waning of\r\ngiant reptiles, the modernising of the flowering plants, and the\r\nmultiplication of small mammals. Some of the Permian reptiles, such as\r\nthe dog-toothed Cynodonts, were extraordinarily mammal-like, and it was\r\nprobably from among them that definite mammals emerged in the Triassic.\r\nComparatively little is known of the early Triassic mammals save that\r\ntheir back-teeth were marked by numerous tubercles on the crown, but\r\nthey were gaining strength in the late Triassic when small arboreal\r\ninsectivores, not very distant from the modern tree-shrews (_Tupaia_),\r\nbegan to branch out in many directions indicative of the great divisions\r\nof modern mammals, such as the clawed mammals, hoofed mammals, and the\r\nrace of monkeys or Primates. In the Upper Cretaceous there was an\r\nexuberant \"radiation\" of mammals, adaptive to the conquest of all sorts\r\nof haunts, and this was vigorously continued in Tertiary times.\r\n\r\nThere is no difficulty in the fact that the earliest remains of definite\r\nmammals in the Triassic precede the first-known bird in the Jurassic.\r\nFor although we usually rank mammals as higher than birds (being mammals\r\nourselves, how could we do otherwise?), there are many ways in which\r\nbirds are pre-eminent, e.g. in skeleton, musculature, integumentary\r\nstructures, and respiratory system. The fact is that birds and mammals\r\nare on two quite different tacks of evolution, not related to one\r\nanother, save in having a common ancestry in extinct reptiles. Moreover,\r\nthere is no reason to believe that the Jurassic _Archæopteryx_ was the\r\nfirst bird in any sense except that it is the first of which we have any\r\nrecord. In any case it is safe to say that birds came to their own\r\nbefore mammals did.\r\n\r\nLooking backwards, we may perhaps sum up what is most essential in the\r\nMesozoic era in Professor Schuchert's sentence: \"The Mesozoic is the Age\r\nof Reptiles, and yet the little mammals and the toothed birds are\r\nstoring up intelligence and strength to replace the reptiles when the\r\ncycads and conifers shall give way to the higher flowering plants.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nThe Cenozoic or Tertiary Era\r\n\r\nIn the _Eocene_ period there was a replacement of the small-brained\r\narchaic mammals by big-brained modernised types, and with this must be\r\nassociated the covering of the earth with a garment of grass and dry\r\npasture. Marshes were replaced by meadows and browsing by grazing\r\nmammals. In the spreading meadows an opportunity was also offered for a\r\nricher evolution of insects and birds.\r\n\r\nDuring the _Oligocene_ the elevation of the land continued, the climate\r\nbecame much less moist, and the grazing herds extended their range.\r\n\r\nThe _Miocene_ was the mammalian Golden Age and there were crowning\r\nexamples of what Osborn calls \"adaptive radiation.\" That is to say,\r\nmammals, like the reptiles before them, conquer every haunt of life.\r\nThere are flying bats, volplaning parachutists, climbers in trees like\r\nsloths and squirrels, quickly moving hoofed mammals, burrowers like the\r\nmoles, freshwater mammals, like duckmole and beaver, shore-frequenting\r\nseals and manatees, and open-sea cetaceans, some of which dive far more\r\nthan full fathoms five. It is important to realise the perennial\r\ntendency of animals to conquer every corner and to fill every niche of\r\nopportunity, and to notice that this has been done by successive sets of\r\nanimals in succeeding ages. _Most notably the mammals repeat all the\r\nexperiments of reptiles on a higher turn of the spiral._ Thus arises\r\nwhat is called convergence, the superficial resemblance of unrelated\r\ntypes, like whales and fishes, the resemblance being due to the fact\r\nthat the different types are similarly adapted to similar conditions of\r\nlife. Professor H. F. Osborn points out that mammals may seek any one of\r\nthe twelve different habitat-zones, and that in each of these there may\r\nbe six quite different kinds of food. Living creatures penetrate\r\neverywhere like the overflowing waters of a great river in flood.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nThe _Pliocene_ period was a more strenuous time, with less genial\r\nclimatic conditions, and with more intense competition. Old land bridges\r\nwere broken and new ones made, and the geographical distribution\r\nunderwent great changes. Professor R. S. Lull describes the _Pliocene_\r\nas \"a period of great unrest.\" \"Many migrations occurred the world over,\r\nnew competitions arose, and the weaker stocks began to show the effects\r\nof the strenuous life. One momentous event seems to have occurred in the\r\nPliocene, and that was the transformation of the precursor of humanity\r\ninto man--the culmination of the highest line of evolution.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Pleistocene_ period was a time of sifting. There was a continued\r\nelevation of the continental masses, and Ice Ages set in, relieved by\r\nless severe interglacial times when the ice-sheets retreated northwards\r\nfor a time. Many types, like the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, the\r\nsabre-toothed tiger, the cave-lion, and the cave-bear, became extinct.\r\nOthers which formerly had a wide range became restricted to the Far\r\nNorth or were left isolated here and there on the high mountains, like\r\nthe Snow Mouse, which now occurs on isolated Alpine heights above the\r\nsnow-line. Perhaps it was during this period that many birds of the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere learned to evade the winter by the sublime device of\r\nmigration.\r\n\r\nLooking backwards we may quote Professor Schuchert again:\r\n\r\n    \"The lands in the Cenozoic began to bloom with more and more\r\n    flowering plants and grand hardwood forests, the atmosphere is\r\n    scented with sweet odours, a vast crowd of new kinds of insects\r\n    appear, and the places of the once dominant reptiles of the lands\r\n    and seas are taken by the mammals. Out of these struggles there\r\n    rises a greater intelligence, seen in nearly all of the mammal\r\n    stocks, but particularly in one, the monkey-ape-man. Brute man\r\n    appears on the scene with the introduction of the last glacial\r\n    climate, a most trying time for all things endowed with life, and\r\n    finally there results the dominance of reasoning man over all his\r\n    brute associates.\"\r\n\r\nIn man and human society the story of evolution has its climax.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ascent of Man\r\n\r\nMan stands apart from animals in his power of building up general ideas\r\nand of using these in the guidance of his behaviour and the control of\r\nhis conduct. This is essentially wrapped up with his development of\r\nlanguage as an instrument of thought. Some animals have words, but man\r\nhas language (Logos). Some animals show evidence of _perceptual_\r\ninference, but man often gets beyond this to _conceptual_ inference\r\n(Reason). Many animals are affectionate and brave, self-forgetful and\r\nindustrious, but man \"thinks the ought,\" definitely guiding his conduct\r\nin the light of ideals, which in turn are wrapped up with the fact that\r\nhe is \"a social person.\"\r\n\r\nBesides his big brain, which may be three times as heavy as that of a\r\ngorilla, man has various physical peculiarities. He walks erect, he\r\nplants the sole of his foot flat on the ground, he has a chin and a good\r\nheel, a big forehead and a non-protrusive face, a relatively uniform set\r\nof teeth without conspicuous canines, and a relatively naked body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM SHOWING SEVEN STAGES IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE\r\nFORE-LIMBS AND HIND-LIMBS OF THE ANCESTORS OF THE MODERN HORSE,\r\nBEGINNING WITH THE EARLIEST KNOWN PREDECESSORS OF THE HORSE AND\r\nCULMINATING WITH THE HORSE OF TO-DAY\r\n\r\n(_After Marsh and Lull._)\r\n\r\n1 and 1A, fore-limb and hind-limb of Eohippus; 2 and 2A, Orohippus; 3\r\nand 3A, Mesohippus; 4 and 4A, Hypohippus; 5 and 5A, Merychippus; 6 and\r\n6A, Hipparion; 7 and 7A, the modern horse.

They are as different as possible, yet they show the same bones,\r\ne.g. SC, the scapula or shoulder-blade; H, the humerus or upper arm; R\r\nand U, the radius and ulna of the fore-arm; CA, the wrist; MC, the palm;\r\nand then the fingers.]\r\n\r\nBut in spite of man's undeniable apartness, there is no doubt as to his\r\nsolidarity with the rest of creation. There is an \"all-pervading\r\nsimilitude of structure,\" between man and the Anthropoid Apes, though it\r\nis certain that it is not from any living form that he took his origin.\r\nNone of the anatomical distinctions, except the heavy brain, could be\r\ncalled momentous. Man's body is a veritable museum of relics (vestigial\r\nstructures) inherited from pre-human ancestors. In his everyday bodily\r\nlife and in some of its disturbances, man's pedigree is often revealed.\r\nEven his facial expression, as Darwin showed, is not always human. Some\r\nfossil remains bring modern man nearer the anthropoid type.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult not to admit the ring of truth in the closing words of\r\nDarwin's _Descent of Man_:\r\n\r\n    \"We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man, with\r\n    all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most\r\n    debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to\r\n    the humblest living creature, with his God-like intellect which has\r\n    penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar\r\n    system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily\r\n    frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLVING SYSTEM OF NATURE\r\n\r\nThere is another side of evolution so obvious that it is often\r\noverlooked, the tendency to link lives together in vital\r\ninter-relations. Thus flowers and their insect visitors are often\r\nvitally interlinked in mutual dependence. Many birds feed on berries and\r\ndistribute the seeds. The tiny freshwater snail is the host of the\r\njuvenile stages of the liver-fluke of the sheep. The mosquito is the\r\nvehicle of malaria from man to man, and the tse-tse fly spreads sleeping\r\nsickness. The freshwater mussel cannot continue its race without the\r\nunconscious co-operation of the minnow, and the freshwater fish called\r\nthe bitterling cannot continue its race without the unconscious\r\nco-operation of the mussel. There are numerous mutually beneficial\r\npartnerships between different kinds of creatures, and other\r\ninter-relations where the benefit is one-sided, as in the case of\r\ninsects that make galls on plants. There are also among kindred animals\r\nmany forms of colonies, communities, and societies. Nutritive chains\r\nbind long series of animals together, the cod feeding on the whelk, the\r\nwhelk on the worm, the worm on the organic dust of the sea. There is a\r\nsystem of successive incarnations and matter is continually passing from\r\none embodiment to another. These instances must suffice to illustrate\r\nthe central biological idea of the web of life, the interlinked System\r\nof Animate Nature. Linnæus spoke of the Systema Naturæ, meaning the\r\norderly hierarchy of classes, orders, families, genera, and species; but\r\nwe owe to Darwin in particular some knowledge of a more dynamic Systema\r\nNaturæ, the network of vital inter-relations. This has become more and\r\nmore complex as evolution has continued, and man's web is most complex\r\nof all. It means making Animate Nature more of a unity; it means an\r\nexternal method of registering steps of progress; it means an evolving\r\nset of sieves by which new variations are sifted, and living creatures\r\nare kept from slipping down the steep ladder of evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nParasitism\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that the inter-relation established between one\r\nliving creature and another works in a retrograde direction. This is the\r\ncase with many thoroughgoing internal parasites which have sunk into an\r\neasygoing kind of life, utterly dependent on their host for food,\r\nrequiring no exertions, running no risks, and receiving no spur to\r\neffort. Thus we see that evolution is not necessarily progressive;\r\neverything depends on the conditions in reference to which the living\r\ncreatures have been evolved. When the conditions are too easygoing, the\r\nanimal may be thoroughly well adapted to them--as a tapeworm certainly\r\nis--but it slips down the rungs of the ladder of evolution.\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting minor chapter in the story of evolution--the\r\nestablishment of different kinds of parasites, casual and constant,\r\ntemporary and lifelong, external hangers-on and internal unpaying\r\nboarders, those that live in the food-canal and depend on the host's\r\nfood and those that inhabit the blood or the tissues and find their food\r\nthere. It seems clear that ichneumon grubs and the like which hatch\r\ninside a caterpillar and eat it alive are not so much parasites as\r\n\"beasts of prey\" working from within.\r\n\r\nBut there are two sides to this minor chapter: there is the evolution of\r\nthe parasite, and there is also the evolution of counteractive measures\r\non the part of the host. Thus there is the maintenance of a bodyguard of\r\nwandering amoeboid cells, which tackle the microbes invading the body\r\nand often succeed in overpowering and digesting them. Thus, again, there\r\nis the protective capacity the blood has of making antagonistic\r\nsubstances or \"anti-bodies\" which counteract poisons, including the\r\npoisons which the intruding parasites often make.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVIDENCES OF EVOLUTION--HOW IT CAME ABOUT\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nProgress in Evolution\r\n\r\nThere has often been slipping back and degeneracy in the course of\r\nevolution, but the big fact is that there has been progress. For\r\nmillions of years Life has been slowly creeping upwards, and if we\r\ncompare the highest animals--Birds and Mammals--with their predecessors,\r\nwe must admit that they are more controlled, more masters of their\r\nfate, with more mentality. Evolution is on the whole _integrative_; that\r\nis to say, it makes against instability and disorder, and towards\r\nharmony and progress. Even in the rise of Birds and Mammals we can\r\ndiscern that the evolutionary process was making towards a fuller\r\nembodiment or expression of what Man values most--control, freedom,\r\nunderstanding, and love. The advance of animal life through the ages has\r\nbeen chequered, but on the whole it has been an advance towards\r\nincreasing fullness, freedom, and fitness of life. In the study of this\r\nadvance--the central fact of Organic Evolution--there is assuredly much\r\nfor Man's instruction and much for his encouragement.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvidences of Evolution\r\n\r\nIn all this, it may be said, the fact of evolution has been taken for\r\ngranted, but what are the evidences? Perhaps it should be frankly\r\nanswered that the idea of evolution, that the present is the child of\r\nthe past and the parent of the future, cannot be _proved_ as one may\r\nprove the Law of Gravitation. All that can be done is to show that it is\r\na key--a way of looking at things--that fits the facts. There is no lock\r\nthat it does not open.\r\n\r\nBut if the facts that the evolution theory vividly interprets be called\r\nthe evidences of its validity, there is no lack of them. There is\r\n_historical_ evidence; and what is more eloquent than the general fact\r\nthat fishes emerge before amphibians, and these before reptiles, and\r\nthese before birds, and so on? There are wonderfully complete fossil\r\nseries, e.g. among cuttlefishes, in which we can almost see evolution in\r\nprocess. The pedigree of horse and elephant and crocodile is in general\r\nvery convincing, though it is to be confessed that there are other cases\r\nin regard to which we have no light. Who can tell, for instance, how\r\nVertebrates arose or from what origin?\r\n\r\nThere is _embryological_ evidence, for the individual development often\r\nreads like an abbreviated recapitulation of the presumed evolution of\r\nthe race. The mammal's visceral clefts are tell-tale evidence of remote\r\naquatic ancestors, breathing by gills. Something is known in regard to\r\nthe historical evolution of antlers in bygone ages; the Red Deer of\r\nto-day recapitulates at least the general outlines of the history. The\r\nindividual development of an asymmetrical flat-fish, like a plaice or\r\nsole, which rests and swims on one side, tells us plainly that its\r\nancestors were symmetrical fishes.\r\n\r\nThere is what might be called _physiological_ evidence, for many plants\r\nand animals are variable before our eyes, and evolution is going on\r\naround us to-day. This is familiarly seen among domesticated animals and\r\ncultivated plants, but there is abundant flux in Wild Nature. It need\r\nhardly be said that some organisms are very conservative, and that\r\nchange need not be expected when a position of stable equilibrium has\r\nbeen secured.\r\n\r\nThere is also _anatomical_ evidence of a most convincing quality. In the\r\nfore-limbs of backboned animals, say, the paddle of a turtle, the wing\r\nof a bird, the flipper of a whale, the fore-leg of a horse, and the arm\r\nof a man; the same essential bones and muscles are used to such diverse\r\nresults! What could it mean save blood relationship? And as to the two\r\nsets of teeth in whalebone whales, which never even cut the gum, is\r\nthere any alternative but to regard them as relics of useful teeth which\r\nancestral forms possessed? In short, the evolution theory is justified\r\nby the way in which it works.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nFactors in Evolution\r\n\r\nIf it be said \"So much for the _fact_ of evolution, but what of the\r\n_factors_?\" the answer is not easy. For not only is the problem the\r\ngreatest of all scientific problems, but the inquiry is still very\r\nyoung. The scientific study of evolution practically dates from the\r\npublication of _The Origin of Species_ in 1859.\r\n\r\nHeritable novelties or variations often crop up in living creatures, and\r\nthese form the raw material of evolution. These variations are the\r\noutcome of expression of changes in the germ-cells that develop into\r\norganisms. But why should there be changes in the constitution of the\r\ngerm-cells? Perhaps because the living material is very complex and\r\ninherently liable to change; perhaps because it is the vehicle of a\r\nmultitude of hereditary items among which there are very likely to be\r\nreshufflings or rearrangements; perhaps because the germ-cells have very\r\nchangeful surroundings (the blood, the body-cavity fluid, the\r\nsea-water); perhaps because deeply saturating outside influences, such\r\nas change of climate and habitat, penetrate through the body to its\r\ngerm-cells and provoke them to vary. But we must be patient with the\r\nwearisome reiteration of \"perhaps.\" Moreover, every many-celled organism\r\nreproduced in the usual way, arises from an egg-cell fertilised by a\r\nsperm-cell, and the changes involved in and preparatory to this\r\nfertilisation may make new permutations and combinations of the living\r\nitems and hereditary qualities not only possible but necessary. It is\r\nsomething like shuffling a pack of cards, but the cards are living. As\r\nto the changes wrought on the body during its lifetime by peculiarities\r\nin nurture, habits, and surroundings, these dents or modifications are\r\noften very important for the individual, but it does not follow that\r\nthey are directly important for the race, since it is not certain that\r\nthey are transmissible.\r\n\r\nGiven a crop of variations or new departures or mutations, whatever the\r\ninborn novelties may be called, we have then to inquire how these are\r\nsifted. The sifting, which means the elimination of the relatively less\r\nfit variations and the selection of the relatively more fit, effected in\r\nmany different ways in the course of the struggle for existence. The\r\norganism plays its new card in the game of life, and the consequences\r\nmay determine survival. The relatively less fit to given conditions\r\nwill tend to be eliminated, while the relatively more fit will tend to\r\nsurvive. If the variations are hereditary and reappear, perhaps\r\nincreased in amount, generation after generation, and if the process of\r\nsifting continue consistently, the result will be the evolution of the\r\nspecies. The sifting process may be helped by various forms of\r\n\"isolation\" which lessen the range of free intercrossing between members\r\nof a species, e.g. by geographical barriers. Interbreeding of similar\r\nforms tends to make a stable stock; out-breeding among dissimilars tends\r\nto promote variability. But for an outline like this it is enough to\r\nsuggest the general method of organic evolution: Throughout the ages\r\norganisms have been making tentatives--new departures of varying\r\nmagnitude--and these tentatives have been tested. The method is that of\r\ntesting all things and holding fast that which is good.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n(The following short list may be useful to readers who desire to have\r\nfurther books recommended to them.)\r\n\r\n CLODD, _Story of Creation: A Plain Account of Evolution._\r\n DARWIN, _Origin of Species, Descent of Man._\r\n DEPERET, _Transformation of the Animal World_ (Internat.

But it is necessary to return to\r\nthese haunts or homes of animals in some detail, so as to understand the\r\npeculiar circumstances of each, and to see how in the course of ages of\r\nstruggle all sorts of self-preserving and race-continuing adaptations or\r\nfitnesses have been wrought out and firmly established. Living creatures\r\nhave spread over all the earth and in the waters under the earth; some\r\nof them have conquered the underground world and others the air. It is\r\npossible, however, as has been indicated, to distinguish six great\r\nhaunts of life, each tenanted by a distinctive fauna, namely, the shore\r\nof the sea, the open sea, the depths of the sea, the freshwaters, the\r\ndry land, and the air. In the deep sea there are no plants at all; in\r\nthe air the only plants are floating bacteria, though there is a sense\r\nin which a tree is very aerial, and the orchid perched on its branches\r\nstill more so; in the other four haunts there is a flora as well as a\r\nfauna--the two working into one another's hands in interesting and often\r\nsubtle inter-relations--the subject of a separate study.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE SHORE OF THE SEA\r\n\r\nThe Seaweed Area\r\n\r\nBy the shore of the sea the zoologist means much more than the narrow\r\nzone between tide-marks; he means the whole of the relatively shallow,\r\nwell-illumined, seaweed-growing shelf around the continents and\r\ncontinental islands. Technically, this is called the littoral area, and\r\nit is divisible into zones, each with its characteristic population. It\r\nmay be noted that the green seaweeds are highest up on the shore; the\r\nbrown ones come next; the beautiful red ones are lowest. All of them\r\nhave got green chlorophyll, which enables them to utilise the sun's rays\r\nin photosynthesis (i.e. building up carbon compounds from air, water,\r\nand salts), but in the brown and red seaweeds the green pigment is\r\nmasked by others. It is maintained by some botanists that these other\r\npigments enable their possessors to make more of the scantier light in\r\nthe deeper waters. However this may be, we must always think of the\r\nshore-haunt as the seaweed-growing area. Directly and indirectly the\r\nlife of the shore animals is closely wrapped up with the seaweeds, which\r\nafford food and foothold, and temper the force of the waves. The minute\r\nfragments broken off from seaweeds and from the sea-grass (a flowering\r\nplant called Zostera) form a sort of nutritive sea-dust which is swept\r\nslowly down the slope from the shore, to form a very useful deposit in\r\nthe quietness of deepish water. It is often found in the stomachs of\r\nmarine animals living a long way offshore.\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions of Shore Life\r\n\r\nThe littoral area as defined is not a large haunt of life; it occupies\r\nonly about 9 million square miles, a small fraction of the 197,000,000\r\nof the whole earth's surface. But it is a very long haunt, some 150,000\r\nmiles, winding in and out by bay and fiord, estuary and creek. Where\r\ndeep water comes close to cliffs there may be no shore at all; in other\r\nplaces the relatively shallow water, with seaweeds growing over the\r\nbottom, may extend outwards for miles. The nature of the shore varies\r\ngreatly according to the nature of the rocks, according to what the\r\nstreams bring down from inland, and according to the jetsam that is\r\nbrought in by the tides. The shore is a changeful place; there is, in\r\nthe upper reaches, a striking difference between \"tide in\" and \"tide\r\nout\"; there are vicissitudes due to storms, to freshwater floods, to\r\nwind-blown sand, and to slow changes of level, up and down. The shore is\r\na very crowded haunt, for it is comparatively narrow, and every niche\r\namong the rocks may be precious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EIGHT-ARMED CUTTLEFISH OR OCTOPUS ATTACKING A SMALL\r\nCRAB\r\n\r\nThese molluscs are particularly fond of crustaceans, which they crunch\r\nwith their parrot's beak-like jaws. Their salivary juice has a\r\nparalysing effect on their prey. To one side, below the eye, may be seen\r\nthe funnel through which water is very forcibly ejected in the process\r\nof locomotion.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COMMON STARFISH, WHICH HAS LOST THREE ARMS AND IS\r\nREGROWING THEM\r\n\r\nThe lowest arm is being regrown double.\r\n\r\n(_After Professor W. C. McIntosh._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PHOTOGRAPH SHOWING A STARFISH (_Asterias Forreri_)\r\nWHICH HAS CAPTURED A LARGE FISH\r\n\r\nThe suctorial tube-feet are seen gripping the fish firmly. (After an\r\nobservation on the Californian coast.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: J. J. Ward, F.E.S._\r\n\r\nTHE PAPER NAUTILUS (ARGONAUTA), AN ANIMAL OF THE OPEN SEA\r\n\r\nThe delicate shell is made by the female only, and is used as a shelter\r\nfor the eggs and young ones. It is secreted by two of the arms, not by\r\nthe mantle as other mollusc shells are. It is a single-chambered shell,\r\nvery different from that of the Pearly Nautilus.]\r\n\r\n\r\nKeen Struggle for Existence\r\n\r\nIt follows that the shore must be the scene of a keen struggle for\r\nexistence--which includes all the answers-back that living creatures\r\nmake to environing difficulties and limitations. There is struggle for\r\nfood, accentuated by the fact that small items tend to be swept away by\r\nthe outgoing tide or to sink down the slope to deep water. Apart from\r\ndirect competition, e.g. between hungry hermit-crabs, it often involves\r\nhard work to get a meal. This is true even of apparently sluggish\r\ncreatures. Thus the Crumb-of-Bread Sponge, or any other seashore sponge,\r\nhas to lash large quantities of water through the intricate canal system\r\nof its body before it can get a sufficient supply of the microscopic\r\norganisms and organic particles on which it feeds. An index of the\r\nintensity of the struggle for food is afforded by the nutritive chains\r\nwhich bind animals together. The shore is almost noisy with the\r\nconjugation of the verb to eat in its many tenses. One pound of rock-cod\r\nrequires for its formation ten pounds of whelk; one pound of whelk\r\nrequires ten pounds of sea-worms; and one pound of worms requires ten\r\npounds of sea-dust. Such is the circulation of matter, ever passing from\r\none embodiment or incarnation to another.\r\n\r\nBesides struggle for food there is struggle for foothold and for fresh\r\nair, struggle against the scouring tide and against the pounding\r\nbreakers. The risk of dislodgment is often great and the fracture of\r\nlimbs is a common accident. Of kinds of armour--the sea-urchin's\r\nhedgehog-like test, the crab's shard, the limpet's shell--there is great\r\nvariety, surpassed only by that of weapons--the sea-anemone's\r\nstinging-cells, the sea-urchin's snapping-blades, the hermit-crab's\r\nforceps, the grappling tentacles and parrot's-beak jaws of the octopus.\r\n\r\n\r\nShifts for a Living\r\n\r\nWe get another glimpse of the intensity of the seashore struggle for\r\nexistence in the frequency of \"shifts for a living,\" adaptations of\r\nstructure or of behaviour which meet frequently recurrent vicissitudes.\r\nThe starfish is often in the dilemma of losing a limb or its life; by a\r\nreflex action it jettisons the captured arm and escapes. And what is\r\nlost is gradually regrown. The crab gets its leg broken past all\r\nmending; it casts off the leg across a weak breakage plane near the\r\nbase, and within a preformed bandage which prevents bleeding a new leg\r\nis formed in miniature. Such is the adaptive device--more reflex than\r\nreflective--which is called self-mutilation or autotomy.\r\n\r\nIn another part of this book there is a discussion of camouflaging and\r\nprotective resemblance; how abundantly these are illustrated on the\r\nshore! But there are other \"shifts for a living.\" Some of the\r\nsand-hoppers and their relatives illustrate the puzzling phenomenon of\r\n\"feigning death,\" becoming suddenly so motionless that they escape the\r\neyes of their enemies. Cuttlefishes, by discharging sepia from their\r\nink-bags, are able to throw dust in the eyes of their enemies. Some\r\nundisguised shore-animals, e.g. crabs, are adepts in a hide-and-seek\r\ngame; some fishes, like the butterfish or gunnel, escape between stones\r\nwhere there seemed no opening and are almost uncatchable in their\r\nslipperiness. Subtlest of all, perhaps, is the habit some hermit-crabs\r\nhave of entering into mutually beneficial partnership (commensalism)\r\nwith sea-anemones, which mask their bearers and also serve as mounted\r\nbatteries, getting transport as their reward and likewise crumbs from\r\nthe frequently spread table. But enough has been said to show that the\r\nshore-haunt exhibits an extraordinary variety of shifts for a living.\r\n\r\n\r\nParental Care on the Shore\r\n\r\nAccording to Darwin, the struggle for existence, as a big fact in the\r\neconomy of Animate Nature, includes not only competition but all the\r\nendeavours which secure the welfare of the offspring, and give them a\r\ngood send-off in life. So it is without a jolt that we pass from\r\nstruggle for food and foothold to parental care. The marine leech called\r\nPontobdella, an interesting greenish warty creature fond of fixing\r\nitself to skate, places its egg-cocoons in the empty shell of a bivalve\r\nmollusc, and guards them for weeks, removing any mud that might injure\r\ntheir development. We have seen a British starfish with its fully-formed\r\nyoung ones creeping about on its body, though the usual mode of\r\ndevelopment for shore starfishes is that the young ones pass through a\r\nfree-swimming larval period in the open water. The father sea-spider\r\ncarries about the eggs attached to two of his limbs; the father\r\nsea-horse puts his mate's eggs into his breast pocket and carries them\r\nthere in safety until they are hatched; the father stickleback of the\r\nshore-pools makes a seaweed nest and guards the eggs which his wives are\r\ninduced to lay there; the father lumpsucker mounts guard over the bunch\r\nof pinkish eggs which his mate has laid in a nook of a rocky shore-pool,\r\nand drives off intruders with zest. He also aerates the developing eggs\r\nby frequent paddling with his pectoral fins and tail, as the Scots name\r\nCock-paidle probably suggests. It is interesting that the salient\r\nexamples of parental care in the shore-haunt are mostly on the male\r\nparent's side. But there is maternal virtue as well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEN-ARMED CUTTLEFISH OR SQUID IN THE ACT OF CAPTURING A\r\nFISH\r\n\r\nThe arms bear numerous prehensile suckers, which grip the prey. In the\r\nmouth there are strong jaws shaped like a parrot's beak. The\r\ncuttlefishes are molluscs and may be regarded as the highest of the\r\nbackboneless or Invertebrate animals. Many occur near shore, others in\r\nthe open sea, and others in the great depths.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREENLAND WHALE\r\n\r\nShowing the double blowhole or nostrils on the top of the head and the\r\nwhalebone plates hanging down from the roof of the mouth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINUTE TRANSPARENT EARLY STAGE OF A SEA-CUCUMBER\r\n\r\nIt swims in the open sea by means of girdles of microscopic cilia shown\r\nin the figure. After a period of free swimming and a remarkable\r\nmetamorphosis, the animal settles down on the floor of the sea in\r\nrelatively shallow water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: British Museum (Natural History)_\r\n\r\nAN INTRICATE COLONY OF OPEN-SEA ANIMALS (_Physophora Hydrostatica_)\r\nRELATED TO THE PORTUGUESE MAN-OF-WAR\r\n\r\nThere is great division of labor in the colony. At the top are floating\r\nand swimming \"persons\"; the long ones below are offensive \"persons\"\r\nbearing batteries of stinging cells; in the middle zone there are\r\nnutritive, reproductive, and other \"persons.\" The color of the colony is\r\na fine translucent blue. Swimmers and bathers are often badly stung by\r\nthis strange animal and its relatives.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SCENE IN THE GREAT DEPTHS\r\n\r\nShowing a deep-sea fish of large gape, two feather-stars on the end of\r\nlong stalks, a \"sea-spider\" (or Pycnogon) walking on lanky legs on the\r\ntreacherous ooze, likewise a brittle-star, and some deep-sea corals.]\r\n\r\nThe fauna of the shore is remarkably _representative_--from unicellular\r\nProtozoa to birds like the oyster-catcher and mammals like the seals.\r\nAlmost all the great groups of animals have apparently served an\r\napprenticeship in the shore-haunt, and since lessons learned for\r\nmillions of years sink in and become organically enregistered, it is\r\njustifiable to look to the shore as a great school in which were gained\r\nracial qualities of endurance, patience, and alertness.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE OPEN SEA\r\n\r\nIn great contrast to the narrow, crowded, difficult conditions of the\r\nshore-haunt (littoral area) are the spacious, bountiful, and relatively\r\neasygoing conditions of the open sea (pelagic area), which means the\r\nwell-lighted surface waters quite away from land. Many small organisms\r\nhave their maximum abundance at about fifty fathoms, so that the word\r\n\"surface\" is to be taken generously. The light becomes very dim at 250\r\nfathoms, and the open sea, as a zoological haunt, stops with the light.\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the pelagic plants are more abundant\r\nnear the surface, and that below a certain depth the population consists\r\nalmost exclusively of animals. Not a few of the animals sink and rise in\r\nthe water periodically; there are some that come near the surface by\r\nday, and others that come near the surface by night. Of great interest\r\nis the habit of the extremely delicate Ctenophores or\r\n\"sea-gooseberries,\" which the splash of a wave would tear into shreds.\r\nWhenever there is any hint of a storm they sink beyond its reach, and\r\nthe ocean's surface must have remained flat as a mirror for many hours\r\nbefore they can be lured upwards from the calm of their deep retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Floating Sea-meadows\r\n\r\nTo understand the vital economy of the open sea, we must recognise the\r\nincalculable abundance of minute unicellular plants, for they form the\r\nfundamental food-supply. Along with these must also be included numerous\r\nmicroscopic animals which have got possession of chlorophyll, or have\r\nentered into internal partnership with unicellular Algæ (symbiosis).\r\nThese green or greenish plants and animals are the _producers_, using\r\nthe energy of the sunlight to help them in building up carbon compounds\r\nout of air, water, and salts. The animals which feed on the producers,\r\nor on other animals, are the _consumers_. Between the two come those\r\nopen-sea bacteria that convert nitrogenous material, e.g. from dead\r\nplants or animals that other bacteria have rotted, into forms, e.g.\r\nnitrates, which plants can re-utilise. The importance of these\r\n_middlemen_ is great in keeping \"the circulation of matter\" agoing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. SEA-HORSE IN SARGASSO WEED. In its frond-like tags of\r\nskin and in its colouring this kind of sea-horse is well concealed among\r\nthe floating seaweed of the so-called Sargasso Sea.\r\n\r\n2.

DEEP-SEA FISHES. Two of them--_Melanocetus murrayi_ and _Melanocetus\r\nindicus_--are related to the Angler of British coasts, but adapted to\r\nlife in the great abysses. They are very dark in colour, and delicately\r\nbuilt; they possess well-developed luminous organs. The third form is\r\ncalled Chauliodus, a predatory animal with large gape and formidable\r\nteeth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLINTY SKELETON OF VENUS FLOWER BASKET (EUPLECTELLA), A\r\nJAPANESE DEEP-SEA SPONGE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGG DEPOSITORY OF _Semotilus Atromaculatus_\r\n\r\nIn the building of this egg depository, the male fish takes stones from\r\nthe bottom of the stream, gripping them in his mouth, and heaps them up\r\ninto the dam.

The arrow shows\r\nthe direction of the stream. Upper fish, male; lower, female.]\r\n\r\nThe \"floating sea-meadows,\" as Sir John Murray called them, are always\r\nreceiving contributions from inshore waters, where the conditions are\r\nfavourable for the prolific multiplication of unicellular Algæ, and\r\nthere is also a certain amount of non-living sea-dust always being swept\r\nout from the seaweed and sea-grass area.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwimmers and Drifters\r\n\r\nThe animals of the open sea are conveniently divided into the active\r\nswimmers (Nekton) and the more passive drifters (Plankton). The swimmers\r\ninclude whales great and small, such birds as the storm petrel, the\r\nfish-eating turtles and sea-snakes, such fishes as mackerel and herring,\r\nthe winged snails or sea-butterflies on which whalebone whales largely\r\nfeed, some of the active cuttles or squids, various open-sea prawns and\r\ntheir relatives, some worms like the transparent arrow-worm, and such\r\nactive Protozoa as Noctiluca, whose luminescence makes the waves sparkle\r\nin the short summer darkness. Very striking as an instance of the\r\ninsurgence of life are the sea-skimmers (Halobatidæ), wingless insects\r\nrelated to the water-measurers in the ditch. They are found hundreds of\r\nmiles from land, skimming on the surface of the open sea, and diving in\r\nstormy weather. They feed on floating dead animals.\r\n\r\nThe drifters or easygoing swimmers--for there is no hard and fast\r\nline--are represented, for instance, by the flinty-shelled Radiolarians\r\nand certain of the chalk-forming animals (Globigerinid Foraminifera); by\r\njellyfishes, swimming-bells, and Portuguese men-of-war; by the\r\ncomb-bearers or Ctenophores; by legions of minute Crustaceans; by\r\nstrange animals called Salps, related to the sedentary sea-squirts; and\r\nby some sluggish fishes like globe-fishes, which often float idly on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nOpen-sea animals tend to be delicately built, with a specific gravity\r\nnear that of the sea-water, with adaptations, such as projecting\r\nfilaments, which help flotation, and with capacities of rising and\r\nsinking according to the surrounding conditions. Many of them are\r\nluminescent, and many of them are very inconspicuous in the water owing\r\nto their transparency or their bluish colour. In both cases the\r\nsignificance is obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nHunger and Love\r\n\r\nHunger is often very much in evidence in the open sea, especially in\r\nareas where the Plankton is poor. For there is great diversity in this\r\nrespect, most of the Mediterranean, for instance, having a scanty\r\nPlankton as compared with the North Sea. In the South Pacific, west of\r\nPatagonia, there is said to be an immense \"sea desert\" where there is\r\nlittle Plankton, and therefore little in the way of fishes. The success\r\nof fisheries in the North, e.g. on the Atlantic cod-banks, is due to the\r\nrichness of the floating sea-meadows and the abundance of the smaller\r\nconstituents of the animal Plankton.\r\n\r\nHunger is plain enough when the Baleen Whale rushes through the water\r\nwith open jaws, engulfing in the huge cavern of its mouth, where the\r\npendent whalebone plates form a huge sieve, incalculable millions of\r\nsmall fry.\r\n\r\nBut there is love as well as hunger in the open sea. The maternal care\r\nexhibited by the whale reaches a very high level, and the delicate shell\r\nof the female Paper Nautilus or Argonaut, in which the eggs and the\r\nyoung ones are sheltered, may well be described as \"the most beautiful\r\ncradle in the world.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the permanent inhabitants of the open sea, there are the larval\r\nstages of many shore-animals which are there only for a short time. For\r\nthere is an interesting give and take between the shore-haunt and the\r\nopen sea. From the shore come nutritive contributions and minute\r\norganisms which multiply quickly in the open waters. But not less\r\nimportant is the fact that the open waters afford a safe cradle or\r\nnursery for many a delicate larva, e.g. of crab and starfish,\r\nacorn-shell and sea-urchin, which could not survive for a day in the\r\nrough-and-tumble conditions of the shore and the shallow water. After\r\nundergoing radical changes and gaining strength, the young creatures\r\nreturn to the shore in various ways.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE DEEP SEA\r\n\r\nVery different from all the other haunts are the depths of the sea,\r\nincluding the floor of the abysses and the zones of water near the\r\nbottom. This haunt, forever unseen, occupies more than a third of the\r\nearth's surface, and it is thickly peopled. It came into emphatic notice\r\nin connection with the mending of telegraph cables, but the results of\r\nthe _Challenger_ expedition (1873-6) gave the first impressive picture\r\nof what was practically a new world.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysical Conditions\r\n\r\nThe average depth of the ocean is about two and a half miles; therefore,\r\nsince many parts are relatively shallow, there must be enormous depths.\r\nA few of these, technically called \"deeps,\" are about six miles deep, in\r\nwhich Mount Everest would be engulfed. There is enormous pressure in\r\nsuch depths; even at 2,500 fathoms it is two and a half tons on the\r\nsquare inch. The temperature is on and off the freezing-point of fresh\r\nwater (28°-34° Fahr.), due to the continual sinking down of cold water\r\nfrom the Poles, especially from the South. Apart from the fitful gleams\r\nof luminescent animals, there is utter darkness in the deep waters. The\r\nrays of sunlight are practically extinguished at 250 fathoms, though\r\nvery sensitive bromogelatine plates exposed at 500 fathoms have shown\r\nfaint indications even at that depth. It is a world of absolute calm and\r\nsilence, and there is no scenery on the floor. A deep, cold, dark,\r\nsilent, monotonous world!\r\n\r\n\r\nBiological Conditions\r\n\r\nWhile some parts of the floor of the abysses are more thickly peopled\r\nthan others, there is no depth limit to the distribution of life.\r\nWherever the long arm of the dredge has reached, animals have been\r\nfound, e.g. Protozoa, sponges, corals, worms, starfishes, sea-urchins,\r\nsea-lilies, crustaceans, lamp-shells, molluscs, ascidians, and fishes--a\r\nvery representative fauna. In the absence of light there can be no\r\nchlorophyll-possessing plants, and as the animals cannot all be eating\r\none another there must be an extraneous source of food-supply. This is\r\nfound in the sinking down of minute organisms which are killed on the\r\nsurface by changes of temperature and other causes. What is left of\r\nthem, before or after being swallowed, and of sea-dust and mineral\r\nparticles of various kinds forms the diversified \"ooze\" of the\r\nsea-floor, a soft muddy precipitate, which is said to have in places the\r\nconsistence of butter in summer weather.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no bacteria in the abysses, so there can be no\r\nrotting. Everything that sinks down, even the huge carcase of a whale,\r\nmust be nibbled away by hungry animals and digested, or else, in the\r\ncase of most bones, slowly dissolved away. Of the whale there are left\r\nonly the ear-bones, of the shark his teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdaptations to Deep-sea Life\r\n\r\nIn adaptation to the great pressure the bodies of deep-sea animals are\r\nusually very permeable, so that the water gets through and through them,\r\nas in the case of Venus' Flower Basket, a flinty sponge which a child's\r\nfinger would shiver. But when the pressure inside is the same as that\r\noutside nothing happens. In adaptation to the treacherous ooze, so apt\r\nto smother, many of the active deep-sea animals have very long,\r\nstilt-like legs, and many of the sedentary types are lifted into safety\r\non the end of long stalks which have their bases embedded in the mud. In\r\nadaptation to the darkness, in which there is only luminescence that\r\neyes could use, there is a great development of tactility. The\r\ninteresting problem of luminescence will be discussed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of the deep-sea fauna, there seems no doubt that it\r\nhas arisen by many contributions from the various shore-haunts.\r\nFollowing the down-drifting food, many shore-animals have in the course\r\nof many generations reached the world of eternal night and winter, and\r\nbecome adapted to its strange conditions. For the animals of the\r\ndeep-sea are as fit, beautiful, and vigorous as those elsewhere. There\r\nare no slums in Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BITTERLING (_Rhodeus Amarus_)\r\n\r\nA Continental fish which lays its eggs by means of a long ovipositor\r\ninside the freshwater mussel. The eggs develop inside the mollusc's\r\ngill-plates.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: W. S.

It is the smallest web-footed bird, about four inches\r\nlong. The legs are long and often touch the water as the bird flies. The\r\nstorm petrel is at home in the Atlantic, and often nests on islands off\r\nthe west coast of Britain.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE FRESH WATERS\r\n\r\nOf the whole earth's surface the freshwaters form a very small fraction,\r\nabout a hundredth, but they make up for their smallness by their\r\nvariety. We think of deep lake and shallow pond, of the great river and\r\nthe purling brook, of lagoon and swamp, and more besides. There is a\r\nstriking resemblance in the animal population of widely separated\r\nfreshwater basins: and this is partly because birds carry many small\r\ncreatures on their muddy feet from one water-shed to another; partly\r\nbecause some of the freshwater animals are descended from types which\r\nmake their way from the sea and the seashore through estuaries and\r\nmarshes, and only certain kinds of constitution could survive the\r\nmigration; and partly because some lakes are landlocked dwindling relics\r\nof ancient seas, and similar forms again would survive the change.\r\n\r\nA typical assemblage of freshwater animals would include many Protozoa,\r\nlike Amoebæ and the Bell-Animalcules, a representative of one family\r\nof sponges (Spongillidæ), the common Hydra, many unsegmented worms\r\n(notably Planarians and Nematodes), many Annelids related to the\r\nearthworms, many crustaceans, insects, and mites, many bivalves and\r\nsnails, various fishes, a newt or two, perhaps a little mud-turtle or in\r\nwarm countries a huge Crocodilian, various interesting birds like the\r\nwater-ouzel or dipper, and mammals like the water-vole and the\r\nwater-shrew.\r\n\r\nFreshwater animals have to face certain difficulties, the greatest of\r\nwhich are drought, frost, and being washed away in times of flood.\r\nThere is no more interesting study in the world than an inquiry into the\r\nadaptations by which freshwater animals overcome the difficulties of the\r\nsituation. We cannot give more than a few illustrations.\r\n\r\n(1) Drought is circumvented by the capacity that many freshwater animals\r\nhave of lying low and saying nothing. Thus the African mudfish may spend\r\nhalf the year encased in the mud, and many minute crustaceans can\r\nsurvive being dried up for years. (2) Escape from the danger of being\r\nfrozen hard in the pool is largely due to the almost unique property of\r\nwater that it expands as it approaches the freezing-point. Thus the\r\ncolder water rises to the surface and forms or adds to the protecting\r\nblanket of ice. The warmer water remains unfrozen at the bottom, and the\r\nanimals live on. (3) The risk of being washed away, e.g. to the sea, is\r\nlessened by all sorts of gripping, grappling, and anchoring structures,\r\nand by shortening the juvenile stages when the risks are greatest.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE DRY LAND\r\n\r\nOver and over again in the history of animal life there have been\r\nattempts to get out of the water on to terra firma, and many of these\r\nhave been successful, notably those made (1) by worms, (2) by\r\nair-breathing Arthropods, and (3) by amphibians.\r\n\r\nIn thinking of the conquest of the dry land by animals, we must\r\nrecognise the indispensable rôle of plants in preparing the way. The dry\r\nground would have proved too inhospitable had not terrestrial plants\r\nbegun to establish themselves, affording food, shelter, and humidity.\r\nThere had to be plants before there could be earthworms, which feed on\r\ndecaying leaves and the like, but how soon was the debt repaid when the\r\nearthworms began their worldwide task of forming vegetable mould,\r\nopening up the earth with their burrows, circulating the soil by means\r\nof their castings, and bruising the particles in their\r\ngizzard--certainly the most important mill in the world.\r\n\r\nAnother important idea is that littoral haunts, both on the seashore and\r\nin the freshwaters, afforded the necessary apprenticeship and\r\ntransitional experience for the more strenuous life on dry land. Much\r\nthat was perfected on land had its beginnings on the shore. Let us\r\ninquire, however, what the passage from water to dry land actually\r\nimplied. This has been briefly discussed in a previous article (on\r\nEvolution), but the subject is one of great interest and importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifficulties and Results of the Transition from Water to Land\r\n\r\nLeaving the water for dry land implied a loss in freedom of movement,\r\nfor the terrestrial animal is primarily restricted to the surface of the\r\nearth. Thus it became essential that movements should be very rapid and\r\nvery precise, needs with which we may associate the acquisition of fine\r\ncross-striped, quickly contracting muscles, and also, in time, their\r\nmultiplication into very numerous separate engines. We exercise\r\nfifty-four muscles in the half-second that elapses between raising the\r\nheel of our foot in walking and planting it firmly on the ground again.\r\nMoreover, the need for rapid precisely controlled movements implied an\r\nimproved nervous system, for the brain was a movement-controlling organ\r\nfor ages before it did much in the way of thinking. The transition to\r\nterra firma also involved a greater compactness of body, so that there\r\nshould not be too great friction on the surface. An animal like the\r\njellyfish is unthinkable on land, and the elongated bodies of some land\r\nanimals like centipedes and snakes are specially adapted so that they do\r\nnot \"sprawl.\" They are exceptions that prove the rule.\r\n\r\nGetting on to dry land meant entering a kingdom where the differences\r\nbetween day and night, between summer and winter are more felt than in\r\nthe sea. This made it advantageous to have protections against\r\nevaporation and loss of heat and other such dangers. Hence a variety of\r\nways in which the surface of the body acquired a thickened skin, or a\r\ndead cuticle, or a shell, or a growth of hair, and so forth. In many\r\ncases there is an increase of the protection before the winter sets in,\r\ne.g. by growing thicker fur or by accumulating a layer of fat below the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nBut the thickening or protection of the skin involved a partial or total\r\nloss of the skin as a respiratory surface. There is more oxygen\r\navailable on dry land than in the water, but it is not so readily\r\ncaptured. Thus we see the importance of moist internal surfaces for\r\ncapturing the oxygen which has been drawn into the interior of the body\r\ninto some sort of lung. A unique solution was offered by Tracheate\r\nArthropods, such as Peripatus, Centipedes, Millipedes, and Insects,\r\nwhere the air is carried to every hole and corner of the body by a\r\nramifying system of air-tubes or tracheæ. In most animals the blood goes\r\nto the air, in insects the air goes to the blood. In the Robber-Crab,\r\nwhich has migrated from the shore inland, the dry air is absorbed by\r\nvascular tufts growing under the shelter of the gill-cover.\r\n\r\nThe problem of disposing of eggs or young ones is obviously much more\r\ndifficult on land than in the water. For the water offers an immediate\r\ncradle, whereas on the dry land there were many dangers, e.g. of\r\ndrought, extremes of temperature, and hungry sharp-eyed enemies, which\r\nhad to be circumvented. So we find all manner of ways in which land\r\nanimals hide their eggs or their young ones in holes and nests, on herbs\r\nand on trees. Some carry their young ones about after they are born,\r\nlike the Surinam toad and the kangaroo, while others have prolonged the\r\nperiod of ante-natal life during which the young ones develop in safety\r\nwithin their mother, and in very intimate partnership with her in the\r\ncase of the placental mammals. It is very interesting to find that the\r\npioneer animal called Peripatus, which bridges the gap between worms and\r\ninsects, carries its young for almost a year before birth.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that the successive conquests of the dry\r\nland had great evolutionary results. It is hardly too much to say that\r\nthe invasion which the Amphibians led was the beginning of better\r\nbrains, more controlled activities, and higher expressions of family\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALBATROSS: A CHARACTERISTIC PELAGIC BIRD OF THE SOUTHERN\r\nSEA\r\n\r\nIt may have a spread of wing of over 11 feet from tip to tip. It is\r\nfamous for its extraordinary power of \"sailing\" round the ship without\r\nany apparent strokes of its wings.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE AIR\r\n\r\nThere are no animals thoroughly aerial, but many insects spend much of\r\ntheir adult life in the free air, and the swift hardly pauses in its\r\nflight from dawn to dusk of the long summer day, alighting only for\r\nbrief moments at the nest to deliver insects to the young. All the\r\nactive life of bats certainly deserves to be called aerial.\r\n\r\nThe air was the last haunt of life to be conquered, and it is\r\ninteresting to inquire what the conquest implied. (1) It meant\r\ntranscending the radical difficulty of terrestrial life which confines\r\nthe creatures of the dry land to moving on one plane, the surface of the\r\nearth. But the power of flight brought its possessors back to the\r\nuniversal freedom of movement which water animals enjoy. When we watch a\r\nsparrow rise into the air just as the cat has completed her stealthy\r\nstalking, we see that flight implies an enormous increase of safety. (2)\r\nThe power of flight also opened up new possibilities of following the\r\nprey, of exploring new territories, of prospecting for water. (3) Of\r\ngreat importance too was the practicability of placing the eggs and the\r\nyoung, perhaps in a nest, in some place inaccessible to most enemies.\r\nWhen one thinks of it, the rooks' nests swaying on the tree-tops express\r\nthe climax of a brilliant experiment. (4) The crowning advantage was the\r\npossibility of migrating, of conquering time (by circumventing the arid\r\nsummer and the severe winter) and of conquering space (by passing\r\nquickly from one country to another and sometimes almost girdling the\r\nglobe). There are not many acquisitions that have meant more to their\r\npossessors than the power of flight. It was a key opening the doors of a\r\nnew freedom.\r\n\r\nThe problem of flight, as has been said in a previous chapter, has been\r\nsolved four times, and the solution has been different in each case. The\r\nfour solutions are those offered by insects, extinct Pterodactyls,\r\nbirds, and bats. Moreover, as has been pointed out, there have been\r\nnumerous attempts at flight which remain glorious failures, notably the\r\nflying fishes, which take a great leap and hold their pectoral fins\r\ntaut; the Flying Tree-Toad, whose webbed fingers and toes form a\r\nparachute; the Flying Lizard (_Draco volans_), which has its skin pushed\r\nout on five or six greatly elongated mobile ribs; and various \"flying\"\r\nmammals, e.g. Flying Phalangers and Flying Squirrels, which take great\r\nswooping leaps from tree to tree.\r\n\r\nThe wings of an insect are hollow flattened sacs which grow out from the\r\nupper parts of the sides of the second and third rings of the region\r\ncalled the thorax. They are worked by powerful muscles, and are\r\nsupported, like a fan, by ribs of chitin, which may be accompanied by\r\nair-tubes, blood-channels, and nerves. The insect's body is lightly\r\nbuilt and very perfectly aerated, and the principle of the insect's\r\nflight is the extremely rapid striking of the air by means of the\r\nlightly built elastic wings. Many an insect has over two hundred strokes\r\nof its wings in one _second_. Hence, in many cases, the familiar hum,\r\ncomparable on a small scale to that produced by the rapidly revolving\r\nblades of an aeroplane's propeller. For a short distance a bee can\r\noutfly a pigeon, but few insects can fly far, and they are easily blown\r\naway or blown back by the wind. Dragon-flies and bees may be cited as\r\nexamples of insects that often fly for two or three miles. But this is\r\nexceptional, and the usual shortness of insect flight is an important\r\nfact for man since it limits the range of insects like house-flies and\r\nmosquitoes which are vehicles of typhoid fever and malaria respectively.\r\nThe most primitive insects (spring-tails and bristle-tails) show no\r\ntrace of wings, while fleas and lice have become secondarily wingless.\r\nIt is interesting to notice that some insects only fly once in their\r\nlifetime, namely, in connection with mating. The evolution of the\r\ninsect's wing remains quite obscure, but it is probable that insects\r\ncould run, leap, and parachute before they could actually fly.\r\n\r\nThe extinct Flying Dragons or Pterodactyls had their golden age in the\r\nCretaceous era, after which they disappeared, leaving no descendants. A\r\nfold of skin was spread out from the sides of the body by the enormously\r\nelongated outermost finger (usually regarded as corresponding to our\r\nlittle finger); it was continued to the hind-legs and thence to the\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nIt is unlikely that the Pterodactyls could fly far, for they have at\r\nmost a weak keel on their breast-bone; on the other hand, some of them\r\nshow a marked fusion of dorsal vertebræ, which, as in flying birds, must\r\nhave served as a firm fulcrum for the stroke of the wings. The quaint\r\ncreatures varied from the size of a sparrow up to a magnificent spread\r\nof 15-20 feet from tip to tip of the wings. They were the largest of all\r\nflying creatures.\r\n\r\nThe bird's solution of the problem of flight, which will be discussed\r\nseparately, is centred in the feather, which forms a coherent vane for\r\nstriking the air. In Pterodactyl and bat the wing is a web-wing or\r\npatagium, and a small web is to be seen on the front side of the bird's\r\nwing. But the bird's patagium is unimportant, and the bird's wing is on\r\nan evolutionary tack of its own--a fore-limb transformed for bearing the\r\nfeathers of flight. Feathers are in a general way comparable to the\r\nscales of reptiles, but only in a general way, and no transition stage\r\nis known between the two. Birds evolved from a bipedal Dinosaur stock,\r\nas has been noticed already, and it is highly probable that they began\r\ntheir ascent by taking running leaps along the ground, flapping their\r\nscaly fore-limbs, and balancing themselves in kangaroo-like fashion with\r\nan extended tail. A second chapter was probably an arboreal\r\napprenticeship, during which they made a fine art of parachuting--a\r\npersistence of which is to be seen in the pigeon \"gliding\" from the\r\ndovecot to the ground. It is in birds that the mastery of the air\r\nreaches its climax, and the mysterious \"sailing\" of the albatross and\r\nthe vulture is surely the most remarkable locomotor triumph that has\r\never been achieved. Without any apparent stroke of the wings, the bird\r\nsails for half an hour at a time with the wind and against the wind,\r\naround the ship and in majestic spirals in the sky, probably taking\r\nadvantage of currents of air of different velocities, and continually\r\nchanging energy of position into energy of motion as it sinks, and\r\nenergy of motion into energy of position as it rises. It is interesting\r\nto know that some dragon-flies are also able to \"sail.\"\r\n\r\nThe web-wing of bats involves much more than the fore-arm. The double\r\nfold of skin begins on the side of the neck, passes along the front of\r\nthe arm, skips the thumb, and is continued over the elongated palm-bones\r\nand fingers to the sides of the body again, and to the hind-legs, and to\r\nthe tail if there is a tail. It is interesting to find that the bones of\r\nthe bat's skeleton tend to be lightly built as in birds, that the\r\nbreast-bone has likewise a keel for the better insertion of the pectoral\r\nmuscles, and that there is a solidifying of the vertebræ of the back,\r\naffording as in birds a firm basis for the wing action. Such similar\r\nadaptations to similar needs, occurring in animals not nearly related to\r\none another, are called \"convergences,\" and form a very interesting\r\nstudy. In addition to adaptations which the bat shares with the flying\r\nbird, it has many of its own. There are so many nerve-endings on the\r\nwing, and often also on special skin-leaves about the ears and nose,\r\nthat the bat flying in the dusk does not knock against branches or other\r\nobstacles. Some say that it is helped by the echoes of its high-pitched\r\nvoice, but there is no doubt as to its exquisite tactility. That it\r\nusually produces only a single young one at a time is a clear adaptation\r\nto flight, and similarly the sharp, mountain-top-like cusps on the back\r\nteeth are adapted in insectivorous bats for crunching insects.\r\n\r\nWhether we think of the triumphant flight of birds, reaching a climax in\r\nmigration, or of the marvel that a creature of the earth--as a mammal\r\nessentially is--should evolve such a mastery of the air as we see in\r\nbats, or even of the repeated but splendid failures which parachuting\r\nanimals illustrate, we gain an impression of the insurgence of living\r\ncreatures in their characteristic endeavour after fuller well-being.\r\n\r\nWe have said enough to show how well adapted many animals are to meet\r\nthe particular difficulties of the haunt which they tenant. But\r\ndifficulties and limitations are ever arising afresh, and so one fitness\r\nfollows on another. It is natural, therefore, to pass to the frequent\r\noccurrence of protective resemblance, camouflage, and mimicry--the\r\nsubject of the next article.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n ELMHIRST, R., _Animals of the Shore_.\r\n FLATTELY AND WALTON, _The Biology of the Shore_ (1921).\r\n FURNEAUX, _Life of Ponds and Streams_.\r\n HICKSON, S.

This is partly because many animals burrow in the ground or\r\nget in underneath things and into dark corners, being what is called\r\ncryptozoic or elusive. But it is partly because many animals put on\r\ndisguise or have in some way acquired a garment of invisibility. This is\r\nvery common among animals, and it occurs in many forms and degrees. The\r\nreason why it is so common is because the struggle for existence is\r\noften very keen, and the reasons why the struggle for existence is keen\r\nare four. First, there is the tendency to over-population in many\r\nanimals, especially those of low degree. Second, there is the fact that\r\nthe scheme of nature involves nutritive chains or successive\r\nincarnations, one animal depending upon another for food, and all in the\r\nlong run on plants; thirdly, every vigorous animal is a bit of a\r\nhustler, given to insurgence and sticking out his elbows. There is a\r\nfourth great reason for the struggle for existence, namely, the frequent\r\nchangefulness of the physical environment, which forces animals to\r\nanswer back or die; but the first three reasons have most to do with the\r\nvery common assumption of some sort of disguise. Even when an animal is\r\nin no sense a weakling, it may be very advantageous for it to be\r\ninconspicuous when it is resting or when it is taking care of its young.\r\nOur problem is the evolution of elusiveness, so far at least as that\r\ndepends on likeness to surroundings, on protective resemblance to other\r\nobjects, and in its highest reaches on true mimicry.\r\n\r\n\r\nColour Permanently Like That of Surroundings\r\n\r\nMany animals living on sandy places have a light-brown colour, as is\r\nseen in some lizards and snakes. The green lizard is like the grass and\r\nthe green tree-snake is inconspicuous among the branches. The spotted\r\nleopard is suited to the interrupted light of the forest, and it is\r\nsometimes hard to tell where the jungle ends and the striped tiger\r\nbegins. There is no better case than the hare or the partridge sitting a\r\nfew yards off on the ploughed field. Even a donkey grazing in the dusk\r\nis much more readily heard than seen.\r\n\r\nThe experiment has been made of tethering the green variety of Praying\r\nMantis on green herbage, fastening them with silk threads. They escape\r\nthe notice of birds. The same is true when the brown variety is tethered\r\non withered herbage. But if the green ones are put on brown plants, or\r\nthe brown ones on green plants, the birds pick them off. Similarly, out\r\nof 300 chickens in a field, 240 white or black and therefore\r\nconspicuous, 60 spotted and inconspicuous, 24 were soon picked off by\r\ncrows, but only one of these was spotted. This was not the proportion\r\nthat there should have been if the mortality had been fortuitous. There\r\nis no doubt that it often pays an animal to be like its habitual\r\nsurroundings, like a little piece of scenery if the animal is not\r\nmoving. It is safe to say that in process of time wide departures from\r\nthe safest coloration will be wiped out in the course of Nature's\r\nceaseless sifting.\r\n\r\nBut we must not be credulous, and there are three cautions to be borne\r\nin mind. (1) An animal may be very like its surroundings without there\r\nbeing any protection implied. The arrow-worms in the sea are as clear as\r\nglass, and so are many open-sea animals. But this is because their\r\ntissues are so watery, with a specific gravity near that of the salt\r\nwater. And the invisibility does not save them, always or often, from\r\nbeing swallowed by larger animals that gather the harvest of the sea.\r\n(2) Among the cleverer animals it looks as if the creature sometimes\r\nsought out a spot where it was most inconspicuous. A spider may place\r\nitself in the middle of a little patch of lichen, where its\r\nself-effacement is complete. Perhaps it is more comfortable as well as\r\nsafer to rest in surroundings the general colour of which is like that\r\nof the animal's body. (3) The fishes that live among the coral-reefs are\r\nstartling in their brilliant coloration, and there are many different\r\npatterns. To explain this it has been suggested that these fishes are so\r\nsafe among the mazy passages and endless nooks of the reefs, that they\r\ncan well afford to wear any colour that suits their constitution. In\r\nsome cases this may be true, but naturalists who have put on a diving\r\nsuit and walked about among the coral have told us that each kind of\r\nfish is particularly suited to some particular place, and that some are\r\nsuited for midday work and others for evening work. Sometimes there is a\r\nsort of Box and Cox arrangement by which two different fishes utilise\r\nthe same corner at different times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRAYING MANTIS (_Mantis Religiosa_)\r\n\r\nA very voracious insect with a quiet, unobtrusive appearance. It holds\r\nits formidable forelegs as if in the attitude of prayer; its movements\r\nare very slow and stealthy; and there is a suggestion of a leaf in the\r\nforewing. But there is no reason to credit the creature with conscious\r\nguile!]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROTECTIVE COLORATION: A WINTER SCENE IN NORTH\r\nSCANDINAVIA\r\n\r\nShowing Variable Hare, Willow Grouse, and Arctic Fox, all white in\r\nwinter and inconspicuous against the snow. But the white dress is also\r\nthe dress that is physiologically best, for it loses least of the animal\r\nheat.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VARIABLE MONITOR (_Varanus_)\r\n\r\nThe monitors are the largest of existing lizards, the Australian species\r\nrepresented in the photograph attaining a length of four feet. It has a\r\nbrown colour with yellow spots, and in spite of its size it is not\r\nconspicuous against certain backgrounds, such as the bark of a tree.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nGradual Change of Colour\r\n\r\nThe common shore-crab shows many different colours and mottlings,\r\nespecially when it is young. It may be green or grey, red or brown, and\r\nso forth, and it is often in admirable adjustment to the colour of the\r\nrock-pool where it is living. Experiments, which require extension, have\r\nshown that when the crab has moulted, which it has to do very often when\r\nit is young, the colour of the new shell tends to harmonise with the\r\ngeneral colour of the rocks and seaweed. How this is brought about, we\r\ndo not know. The colour does not seem to change till the next moult, and\r\nnot then unless there is some reason for it. A full-grown shore-crab is\r\nwell able to look after itself, and it is of interest to notice,\r\ntherefore, that the variety of coloration is mainly among the small\r\nindividuals, who have, of course, a much less secure position. It is\r\npossible, moreover, that the resemblance to the surroundings admits of\r\nmore successful hunting, enabling the small crab to take its victim\r\nunawares.\r\n\r\nProfessor Poulton's experiments with the caterpillars of the small\r\ntortoise-shell butterfly showed that in black surroundings the pupæ tend\r\nto be darker, in white surroundings lighter, in gilded boxes golden; and\r\nthe same is true in other cases. It appears that the surrounding colour\r\naffects the caterpillars through the skin during a sensitive period--the\r\ntwenty hours immediately preceding the last twelve hours of the larval\r\nstate. The result will tend to make the quiescent pupæ less conspicuous\r\nduring the critical time of metamorphosis. The physiology of this\r\nsympathetic colouring remains obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeasonal Change of Colouring\r\n\r\nThe ptarmigan moults three times in the year. Its summer plumage is\r\nrather grouselike above, with a good deal of rufous brown; the back\r\nbecomes much more grey in autumn; almost all the feathers of the winter\r\nplumage are white. That is to say, they develop without any pigment and\r\nwith numerous gas-bubbles in their cells. Now there can be no doubt that\r\nthis white winter plumage makes the ptarmigan very inconspicuous amidst\r\nthe snow. Sometimes one comes within a few feet of the crouching bird\r\nwithout seeing it, and this garment of invisibility may save it from the\r\nhungry eyes of golden eagles.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the brown stoat becomes the white ermine, mainly by the\r\ngrowth, of a new suit of white fur, and the same is true of the mountain\r\nhare. The ermine is all white except the black tip of its tail; the\r\nmountain hare in its winter dress is all white save the black tips of\r\nits ears. In some cases, especially in the mountain hare, it seems that\r\nindividual hairs may turn white, by a loss of pigment, as may occur in\r\nman. According to Metchnikoff, the wandering amoeboid cells of the\r\nbody, called phagocytes, may creep up into the hairs and come back again\r\nwith microscopic burdens of pigment. The place of the pigment is taken\r\nby gas-bubbles, and that is what causes the whiteness. In no animals is\r\nthere any white _pigment_; the white _colour_ is like that of snow or\r\nfoam, it is due to the complete reflection of the light from innumerable\r\nminute surfaces of crystals or bubbles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: W. S. Berridge, F.Z.S._\r\n\r\nBANDED KRAIT: A VERY POISONOUS SNAKE WITH ALTERNATING YELLOW AND DARK\r\nBANDS\r\n\r\nIt is very conspicuous and may serve as an illustration of warning\r\ncoloration. Perhaps, that is to say, its striking coloration serves as\r\nan advertisement, impressing other creatures with the fact that the\r\nBanded Krait should be left alone. It is very unprofitable for a snake\r\nto waste its venom on creatures it does not want.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photos: W. S. Berridge, F.Z.S._\r\n\r\nTHE WARTY CHAMELEON\r\n\r\nThe upper photograph shows the Warty Chameleon inflated and conspicuous.\r\nAt another time, however, with compressed body and adjusted coloration,\r\nthe animal is very inconspicuous. The lower photograph shows the sudden\r\nprotrusion of the very long tongue on a fly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEASONAL COLOUR-CHANGE: A SUMMER SCENE IN NORTH\r\nSCANDINAVIA\r\n\r\nShowing a brown Variable Hare, Willow Grouse, and Arctic Fox, all\r\ninconspicuous in their coloration when seen in their natural\r\nsurroundings.]\r\n\r\nThe mountain hare may escape the fox the more readily because its\r\nwhiteness makes it so inconspicuous against a background of snow; and\r\nyet, at other times, we have seen the creature standing out like a\r\ntarget on the dark moorland. So it cuts both ways. The ermine has almost\r\nno enemies except the gamekeeper, but its winter whiteness may help it\r\nto sneak upon its victims, such as grouse or rabbit, when there is snow\r\nupon the ground. In both cases, however, the probability is that the\r\nconstitutional rhythm which leads to white hair in winter has been\r\nfostered and fixed for a reason quite apart from protection. The fact is\r\nthat for a warm-blooded creature, whether bird or mammal, the\r\nphysiologically best dress is a white one, for there is less radiation\r\nof the precious animal heat from white plumage or white pelage than from\r\nany other colour. The quality of warm-bloodedness is a prerogative of\r\nbirds and mammals, and it means that the body keeps an almost constant\r\ntemperature, day and night, year in and year out. This is effected by\r\nautomatic internal adjustments which regulate the supply of heat,\r\nchiefly from the muscles, to the loss of heat, chiefly through the skin\r\nand from the lungs. The chief importance of this internal heat is that\r\nit facilitates the smooth continuance of the chemical processes on which\r\nlife depends. If the temperature falls, as in hibernating mammals (whose\r\nwarm-bloodedness is imperfect), the rate of the vital process is slowed\r\ndown--sometimes dangerously. Thus we see how the white coat helps the\r\nlife of the creature.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nRapid Colour-change\r\n\r\nBony flat-fishes, like plaice and sole, have a remarkable power of\r\nadjusting their hue and pattern to the surrounding gravel and sand, so\r\nthat it is difficult to find them even when we know that they are there.\r\nIt must be admitted that they are also very quick to get a sprinkling\r\nof sand over their upturned side, so that only the eyes are left\r\nshowing. But there is no doubt as to the exactness with which they often\r\nadjust themselves to be like a little piece of the substratum on which\r\nthey lie; they will do this within limits in experimental conditions\r\nwhen they are placed on a quite artificial floor. As these fishes are\r\nvery palatable and are much sought after by such enemies as cormorants\r\nand otters, it is highly probably that their power of self-effacement\r\noften saves their life. And it may be effected within a few minutes, in\r\nsome cases within a minute.\r\n\r\nIn these self-effacing flat-fishes we know with some precision what\r\nhappens. The adjustment of colour and pattern is due to changes in the\r\nsize, shape, and position of mobile pigment-cells (chromatophores) and\r\nthe skin. But what makes the pigment-cells change? The fact that a blind\r\nflat-fish does not change its colour gives us the first part of the\r\nanswer. The colour and the pattern of the surroundings must affect the\r\neye. The message travels by the optic nerve to the brain; from the\r\nbrain, instead of passing down the spinal cord, the message travels down\r\nthe chain of sympathetic ganglia. From these it passes along the nerves\r\nwhich comes out of the spinal cord and control the skin. Thus the\r\nmessage reaches the colour-cells in the skin, and before you have\r\ncarefully read these lines the flat-fish has slipped on its Gyges ring\r\nand become invisible.\r\n\r\nThe same power of rapid colour-change is seen in cuttlefishes, where it\r\nis often an expression of nervous excitement, though it sometimes helps\r\nto conceal. It occurs with much subtlety in the Æsop prawn, Hippolyte,\r\nwhich may be brown on a brown seaweed, green on sea-lettuce or\r\nsea-grass, red on red seaweed, and so on through an extensive repertory.\r\n\r\n    According to the nature of the background, [Professor Gamble writes]\r\n    so is the mixture of the pigments compounded so as to form a close\r\n    reproduction both of its colour and its pattern. A sweep of the\r\n    shrimp net detaches a battalion of these sleeping prawns, and if\r\n    we turn the motley into a dish and give a choice of seaweed, each\r\n    variety after its kind will select the one with which it agrees in\r\n    colour, and vanish. Both when young and when full-grown, the Æsop\r\n    prawn takes on the colour of its immediate surroundings. At\r\n    nightfall Hippolyte, of whatever colour, changes to a transparent\r\n    azure blue: its stolidity gives place to a nervous restlessness; at\r\n    the least tremor it leaps violently, and often swims actively from\r\n    one food-plant to another. This blue fit lasts till daybreak, and is\r\n    then succeeded by the prawn's diurnal tint.\r\n\r\nThus, Professor Gamble continues, the colour of an animal may express a\r\nnervous rhythm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: J.

These quaint\r\ncreatures are characteristic of Africa; but they occur also in\r\nAndalusia, Arabia, Ceylon, and Southern India. They are adapted for life\r\non trees, where they hunt insects with great deliberateness and success.\r\nThe protrusible tongue, ending in a sticky club, can be shot out for\r\nabout seven inches in the common chameleon. Their hands and feet are\r\nsplit so that they grip the branches firmly, and the prehensile tail\r\nrivals a monkey's. When they wish they can make themselves very slim,\r\ncontracting the body from side to side, so that they are not very\r\nreadily seen. In other circumstances, however, they do not practise\r\nself-effacement, but the very reverse. They inflate their bodies, having\r\nnot only large lungs, but air-sacs in connection with them. The throat\r\nbulges; the body sways from side to side; and the creature expresses its\r\nsentiments in a hiss. The power of colour-change is very remarkable, and\r\ndepends partly on the contraction and expansion of the colour-cells\r\n(chromatophores) in the under-skin (or dermis) and partly on\r\nclose-packed refractive granules and crystals of a waste-product called\r\nguanin. The repertory of possible colours in the common chameleon is\r\ngreater than in any other animal except the Æsop prawn. There is a\r\nlegend of a chameleon which was brown in a brown box, green in a green\r\nbox, and blue in a blue box, and died when put into one lined with\r\ntartan; and there is no doubt that one and the same animal has a wide\r\nrange of colours. The so-called \"chameleon\" (_Anolis_) of North America\r\nis so sensitive that a passing cloud makes it change its emerald hue.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that a chameleon may make itself more inconspicuous by\r\nchanging its colour, being affected by the play of light on its eyes. A\r\nbright-green hue is often seen on those that are sitting among strongly\r\nillumined green leaves. But the colour also changes with the time of day\r\nand with the animal's moods. A sudden irritation may bring about a rapid\r\nchange; in other cases the transformation comes about very gradually.\r\nWhen the colour-change expresses the chameleon's feelings it might be\r\ncompared to blushing, but that is due to an expansion of the arteries of\r\nthe face, allowing more blood to get into the capillaries of the\r\nunder-skin. The case of the chameleon is peculiarly interesting because\r\nthe animal has two kinds of tactics--self-effacement on the one hand and\r\nbluffing on the other. There can be little doubt that the power of\r\ncolour-change sometimes justifies itself by driving off intruders. Dr.\r\nCyril Crossland observed that a chameleon attacked by a fox-terrier\r\n\"turned round and opened its great pink mouth in the face of the\r\nadvancing dog, at the same time rapidly changing colour, becoming almost\r\nblack. This ruse succeeded every time, the dog turning off at once.\" In\r\nnatural leafy surroundings the startling effect would be much greater--a\r\nsudden throwing off of the mantle of invisibility and the exposure of a\r\nconspicuous black body with a large red mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4\r\n\r\nLikeness to Other Things\r\n\r\nDr. H. O. Forbes tells of a flat spider which presents a striking\r\nresemblance to a bird's dropping on a leaf. Years after he first\r\nfound it he was watching in a forest in the Far East when his eye fell\r\non a leaf before him which had been blotched by a bird. He wondered idly\r\nwhy he had not seen for so long another specimen of the bird-dropping\r\nspider (_Ornithoscatoides decipiens_), and drew the leaf towards him.\r\nInstantaneously he got a characteristic sharp nip; it was the spider\r\nafter all! Here the colour-resemblance was enhanced by a\r\nform-resemblance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. PROTECTIVE COLORATION OR CAMOUFLAGING, GIVING ANIMALS\r\nA GARMENT OF INVISIBILITY\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the plate is a Nightjar, with plumage like bark and\r\nwithering leaves; to the right, resting on a branch, is shown a\r\nChameleon in a green phase amid green surroundings; the insects on the\r\nreeds are Locusts; while a green Frog, merged into its surroundings,\r\nrests on a leaf near the centre at the top of the picture.\r\n\r\nB. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PROTECTIVE COLORATION OR CAMOUFLAGE\r\n\r\nA shore scene showing Trout in the pool almost invisible against their\r\nbackground. The Stone Curlews, both adult and young, are very\r\ninconspicuous among the stones on the beach.]\r\n\r\nBut why should it profit a spider to be like a bird-dropping? Perhaps\r\nbecause it thereby escapes attention; but there is another possibility.\r\nIt seems that some butterflies, allied to our Blues, are often attracted\r\nto excrementitious material, and the spider Dr. Forbes observed had\r\nactually caught its victim. This is borne out by a recent observation by\r\nDr. D. G. H. Carpenter, who found a Uganda bug closely resembling a\r\nbird-dropping on sand. The bug actually settled down on a bird-dropping\r\non sand, and caught a blue butterfly which came to feed there!\r\n\r\nSome of the walking-stick insects, belonging to the order of crickets\r\nand grasshoppers (Orthoptera), have their body elongated and narrow,\r\nlike a thin dry branch, and they have a way of sticking out their limbs\r\nat abrupt and diverse angles, which makes the resemblance to twigs very\r\nclose indeed. Some of these quaint insects rest through the day and have\r\nthe remarkable habit of putting themselves into a sort of kataleptic\r\nstate. Many creatures turn stiff when they get a shock, or pass suddenly\r\ninto new surroundings, like some of the sand-hoppers when we lay them on\r\nthe palm of our hand; but these twig-insects put themselves into this\r\nstrange state. The body is rocked from side to side for a short time,\r\nand then it stiffens. An advantage may be that even if they were\r\nsurprised by a bird or a lizard, they will not be able to betray\r\nthemselves by even a tremor. Disguise is perfected by a remarkable\r\nhabit, a habit which leads us to think of a whole series of different\r\nways of lying low and saying nothing which are often of life-preserving\r\nvalue. The top end of the series is seen when a fox plays 'possum.\r\n\r\nThe leaf-butterfly _Kallima_, conspicuously coloured on its upper\r\nsurface, is like a withered leaf when it settles down and shows the\r\nunder side of its wings. Here, again, there is precise form-resemblance,\r\nfor the nervures on the wings are like the mid-rib and side veins on a\r\nleaf, and the touch of perfection is given in the presence of whitish\r\nspots which look exactly like the discolorations produced by lichens on\r\nleaves. An old entomologist, Mr. Jenner Weir, confessed that he\r\nrepeatedly pruned off a caterpillar on a bush in mistake for a\r\nsuperfluous twig, for many brownish caterpillars fasten themselves by\r\ntheir posterior claspers and by an invisible thread of silk from their\r\nmouth, and project from the branch at a twig-like angle. An insect may\r\nbe the very image of a sharp prickle or a piece of soft moss; a spider\r\nmay look precisely like a tiny knob on a branch or a fragment of lichen;\r\none of the sea-horses (_Phyllopteryx_) has frond-like tassels on various\r\nparts of its body, so that it looks extraordinarily like the seaweeds\r\namong which it lives. In a few cases, e.g. among spiders, it has been\r\nshown that animals with a special protective resemblance to something\r\nelse seek out a position where this resemblance tells, and there is\r\nurgent need for observations bearing on this selection of environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5\r\n\r\nMimicry in the True Sense\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that in one and the same place there are two groups\r\nof animals not very nearly related which are \"doubles\" of one another.\r\nInvestigation shows that the members of the one group, _always in the\r\nmajority_, are in some way specially protected, e.g. by being\r\nunpalatable. They are the \"mimicked.\" The members of the other group,\r\n_always in the minority_, have not got the special protection possessed\r\nby the others. They are the \"mimickers,\" though the resemblance is not,\r\nof course, associated with any conscious imitation. The theory is that\r\nthe mimickers live on the reputation of the mimicked. If the mimicked\r\nare left alone by birds because they have a reputation for\r\nunpalatability, or because they are able to sting, the mimickers\r\nsurvive--although they are palatable and stingless. They succeed, not\r\nthrough any virtue of their own, but because of their resemblance to the\r\nmimicked, for whom they are mistaken. There are many cases of mimetic\r\nresemblance so striking and so subtle that it seems impossible to doubt\r\nthat the thing works; there are other cases which are rather\r\nfar-fetched, and may be somewhat of the nature of coincidences. Thus\r\nalthough Mr. Bates tells us that he repeatedly shot humming-bird moths\r\nin mistake for humming-birds, we cannot think that this is a good\r\nillustration of mimicry. What is needed for many cases is what is\r\nforthcoming for some, namely, experimental evidence, e.g. that the\r\nunpalatable mimicked butterflies are left in relative peace while\r\nsimilar palatable butterflies are persecuted. It is also necessary to\r\nshow that the mimickers do actually consort with the mimicked. Some\r\nbeetles and moths are curiously wasplike, which may be a great\r\nadvantage; the common drone-fly is superficially like a small bee; some\r\nharmless snakes are very like poisonous species; and Mr. Wallace\r\nmaintained that the powerful \"friar-birds\" of the Far East are mimicked\r\nby the weak and timid orioles. When the model is unpalatable or\r\nrepulsive or dangerous, and the mimic the reverse, the mimicry is called\r\n\"Batesian\" (after Mr. Bates), but there is another kind of mimicry\r\ncalled Müllerian (after Fritz Müller) where the mimic is also\r\nunpalatable. The theory in this case is that the mimicry serves as\r\nmutual assurance, the members of the ring getting on better by\r\nconsistently presenting the same appearance, which has come to mean to\r\npossible enemies a signal, _Noli me tangere_ (\"Leave me alone\"). There\r\nis nothing out of the question in this theory, but it requires to be\r\ntaken in a critical spirit. It leads us to think of \"warning colours,\"\r\nwhich are the very opposite of the disguises which we are now studying.\r\nSome creatures like skunks, magpies, coral-snakes, cobras, brightly\r\ncoloured tree-frogs are obtrusive rather than elusive, and the theory\r\nof Alfred Russel Wallace was that the flaunting conspicuousness serves\r\nas a useful advertisement, impressing itself on the memories of\r\ninexperienced enemies, who soon learn to leave creatures with \"warning\r\ncolours\" alone. In any case it is plain that an animal which is as safe\r\nas a wasp or a coral-snake can afford to wear any suit of clothes it\r\nlikes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEAD-LEAF BUTTERFLY (_Kallima Inachis_) FROM INDIA\r\n\r\nIt is conspicuous on its upper surface, but when it settles down on a\r\ntwig and shows the underside of its wings it is practically invisible.\r\nThe colouring of the under surface of the wings is like that of the\r\nwithering leaf; there are spots like fungas spots; and the venation of\r\nthe wings suggests the mid-rib and veins of the leaf.

It will be noted that the spider has four pairs of legs and\r\nno feelers, whereas the ant has three pairs of legs and a pair of\r\nfeelers.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: J. J.

As for the sea-anemones, they are carried about by\r\nthe hermit-crab and they get crumbs from its table. This kind of\r\nmutually beneficial external partnership is called commensalism, i.e.\r\neating at the same table.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: G. P.

After sojourning for a time in\r\nthe cuckoo-spit, the frog-hopper becomes a winged insect.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMasking\r\n\r\nThe episode in Scottish history called \"The Walking Wood of Birnam,\"\r\nwhen the advancing troop masked their approach by cutting down branches\r\nof the trees, has had its counterpart in many countries. But it is also\r\nenacted on the seashore. There are many kinds of crabs that put on\r\ndisguise with what looks like deliberateness. The sand-crab takes a\r\npiece of seaweed, nibbles at the end of it, and then rubs it on the back\r\nof the carapace or on the legs so that it fixes to the bristles. As the\r\nseaweed continues to live, the crab soon has a little garden on its back\r\nwhich masks the crab's real nature. It is most effective camouflaging,\r\nbut if the crab continues to grow it has to moult, and that means losing\r\nthe disguise. It is then necessary to make a new one. The crab must have\r\non the shore something corresponding to a reputation; that is to say,\r\nother animals are clearly or dimly aware that the crab is a voracious\r\nand combative creature. How useful to the crab, then, to have its\r\nappearance cloaked by a growth of innocent seaweed, or sponge, or\r\nzoophyte. It will enable the creature to sneak upon its victims or to\r\nescape the attention of its own enemies.\r\n\r\nIf a narrow-beaked crab is cleaned artificially it will proceed to\r\nclothe itself again, the habit has become instinctive; and it must be\r\nadmitted that while a particular crab prefers a particular kind of\r\nseaweed for its dress, it will cover itself with unsuitable and even\r\nconspicuous material, such as pieces of coloured cloth, if nothing\r\nbetter is available. The disguise differs greatly, for one crab is\r\nmasked by a brightly coloured and unpalatable sponge densely packed\r\nwith flinty needles; another cuts off the tunic of a sea-squirt and\r\nthrows it over its shoulders; another trundles about a bivalve shell.\r\nThe facts recall the familiar case of the hermit-crab, which protects\r\nits soft tail by tucking it into the empty shell of a periwinkle or a\r\nwhelk or some other sea-snail, and that case leads on to the elaboration\r\nknown as commensalism, where the hermit-crab fixes sea-anemones on the\r\nback of its borrowed house. The advantage here is beyond that of\r\nmasking, for the sea-anemone can sting, which is a useful quality in a\r\npartner. That this second advantage may become the main one is evident\r\nin several cases where the sea-anemone is borne, just like a weapon, on\r\neach of the crustacean's great claws. Moreover, as the term commensalism\r\n(eating at the same table) suggests, the partnership is _mutually_\r\nbeneficial. For the sea-anemone is carried about by the hermit-crab, and\r\nit doubtless gets its share of crumbs from its partner's frequent meals.\r\nThere is a very interesting sidelight on the mutual benefit in the case\r\nof a dislodged sea-anemone which sulked for a while and then waited in a\r\nstate of preparedness until a hermit-crab passed by and touched it.\r\nWhereupon the sea-anemone gripped and slowly worked itself up on to the\r\nback of the shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6\r\n\r\nOther Kinds of Elusiveness\r\n\r\nThere are various kinds of disguise which are not readily classified. A\r\ntroop of cuttlefish swimming in the sea is a beautiful sight. They keep\r\ntime with one another in their movements and they show the same change\r\nof colour almost at the same moment. They are suddenly attacked,\r\nhowever, by a small shark, and then comes a simultaneous discharge of\r\nsepia from their ink-bags. There are clouds of ink in the clear water,\r\nfor, as Professor Hickson puts it, the cuttlefishes have thrown dust in\r\nthe eyes of their enemies. One can see a newborn cuttlefish do this a\r\nminute after it escapes from the egg.\r\n\r\nVery beautiful is the way in which many birds, like our common\r\nchaffinch, disguise the outside of their nest with moss and lichen and\r\nother trifles felted together, so that the cradle is as inconspicuous as\r\npossible. There seems to be a touch of art in fastening pieces of\r\nspider's web on the outside of a nest!\r\n\r\nHow curious is the case of the tree-sloth of South American forests,\r\nthat walks slowly, back downwards, along the undersides of the branches,\r\nhanging on by its long, curved fingers and toes. It is a nocturnal\r\nanimal, and therefore not in special danger, but when resting during the\r\nday it is almost invisible because its shaggy hair is so like certain\r\nlichens and other growths on the branches. But the protective\r\nresemblance is enhanced by the presence of a green alga, which actually\r\nlives on the surface of the sloth's hairs--an alga like the one that\r\nmakes tree-stems and gate-posts green in damp weather.\r\n\r\nThere is no commoner sight in the early summer than the cuckoo-spit on\r\nthe grasses and herbage by the wayside. It is conspicuous and yet it is\r\nsaid to be left severely alone by almost all creatures. In some way it\r\nmust be a disguise. It is a sort of soap made by the activity of small\r\nfrog-hoppers while they are still in the wingless larval stage, before\r\nthey begin to hop. The insect pierces with its sharp mouth-parts the\r\nskin of the plant and sucks in sweet sap which by and by overflows over\r\nits body. It works its body up and down many times, whipping in air,\r\nwhich mixes with the sugary sap, reminding one of how \"whipped egg\" is\r\nmade. But along with the sugary sap and the air, there is a little\r\nferment from the food-canal and a little wax from glands on the skin,\r\nand the four things mixed together make a kind of soap which lasts\r\nthrough the heat of the day.\r\n\r\nThere are many other modes of disguise besides those which we have been\r\nable to illustrate. Indeed, the biggest fact is that there are so many,\r\nfor it brings us back to the idea that life is not an easy business. It\r\nis true, as Walt Whitman says, that animals do not sweat and whine about\r\ntheir condition; perhaps it is true, as he says, that not one is\r\nunhappy over the whole earth. But there is another truth, that this\r\nworld is not a place for the unlit lamp and the ungirt loin, and that\r\nwhen a creature has not armour or weapons or cleverness it must find\r\nsome path of safety or go back. One of these paths of safety is\r\ndisguise, and we have illustrated its evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE ASCENT OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASCENT OF MAN\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nNo one thinks less of Sir Isaac Newton because he was born as a very\r\npuny infant, and no one should think less of the human race because it\r\nsprang from a stock of arboreal mammals. There is no doubt as to man's\r\napartness from the rest of creation when he is seen at his best--\"a\r\nlittle lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honour.\" \"What a\r\npiece of work is a man! How noble in reason! How infinite in faculty! in\r\nform and moving how express and admirable! in action how like an angel!\r\nin apprehension so like a God.\" Nevertheless, all the facts point to his\r\naffiliation to the stock to which monkeys and apes also belong. Not,\r\nindeed, that man is descended from any living ape or monkey; it is\r\nrather that he and they have sprung from a common ancestry--are branches\r\nof the same stem. This conclusion is so momentous that the reasons for\r\naccepting it must be carefully considered. They were expounded with\r\nmasterly skill in Darwin's _Descent of Man_ in 1871--a book which was\r\nbut an expansion of a chapter in _The Origin of Species_ (1859).\r\n\r\n\r\nAnatomical Proof of Man's Relationship with a Simian Stock\r\n\r\nThe anatomical structure of man is closely similar to that of the\r\nanthropoid apes--the gorilla, the orang, the chimpanzee, and the gibbon.\r\nBone for bone, muscle for muscle, blood-vessel for blood-vessel, nerve\r\nfor nerve, man and ape agree. As the conservative anatomist, Sir\r\nRichard Owen, said, there is between them \"an all-pervading similitude\r\nof structure.\" Differences, of course, there are, but they are not\r\nmomentous except man's big brain, which may be three times as heavy as\r\nthat of a gorilla. The average human brain weighs about 48 ounces; the\r\ngorilla brain does not exceed 20 ounces at its best. The capacity of the\r\nhuman skull is never less than 55 cubic inches; in the orang and the\r\nchimpanzee the figures are 26 and 27-1/2 respectively. We are not\r\nsuggesting that the most distinctive features of man are such as can be\r\nmeasured and weighed, but it is important to notice that the main seat\r\nof his mental powers is physically far ahead of that of the highest of\r\nthe anthropoid apes.\r\n\r\nMan alone is thoroughly erect after his infancy is past; his head\r\nweighted with the heavy brain does not droop forward as the ape's does;\r\nwith his erect attitude there is perhaps to be associated his more\r\nhighly developed vocal organs. Compared with an anthropoid ape, man has\r\na bigger and more upright forehead, a less protrusive face region,\r\nsmaller cheek-bones and eyebrow ridges, and more uniform teeth. He is\r\nalmost unique in having a chin. Man plants the sole of his foot flat on\r\nthe ground, his big toe is usually in a line with the other toes, and he\r\nhas a better heel than any monkey has. The change in the shape of the\r\nhead is to be thought of in connection with the enlargement of the\r\nbrain, and also in connection with the natural reduction of the muzzle\r\nregion when the hand was freed from being an organ of support and became\r\nsuited for grasping the food and conveying it to the mouth.\r\n\r\nEveryone is familiar in man's clothing with traces of the past\r\npersisting in the present, though their use has long since disappeared.\r\nThere are buttons on the back of the waist of the morning coat to which\r\nthe tails of the coat used to be fastened up, and there are buttons,\r\noccasionally with buttonholes, at the wrist which were once useful in\r\nturning up the sleeve. The same is true of man's body, which is a\r\nveritable museum of relics. Some anatomists have made out a list of\r\nover a hundred of these _vestigial_ structures, and though this number\r\nis perhaps too high, there is no doubt that the list is long. In the\r\ninner upper corner of the eye there is a minute tag--but larger in some\r\nraces than in others--which is the last dwindling relic of the third\r\neyelid, used in cleaning the front of the eye, which most mammals\r\npossess in a large and well-developed form. It can be easily seen, for\r\ninstance, in ox and rabbit. In man and in monkeys it has become a\r\nuseless vestige, and the dwindling must be associated with the fact that\r\nthe upper eyelid is much more mobile in man and monkeys than in the\r\nother mammals. The vestigial third eyelid in man is enough of itself to\r\nprove his relationship with the mammals, but it is only one example out\r\nof many. Some of these are discussed in the article dealing with the\r\nhuman body, but we may mention the vestigial muscles going to the\r\near-trumpet, man's dwindling counterpart of the skin-twitching muscle\r\nwhich we see a horse use when he jerks a fly off his flanks, and the\r\nshort tail which in the seven-weeks-old human embryo is actually longer\r\nthan the leg. Without committing ourselves to a belief in the entire\r\nuselessness of the vermiform appendix, which grows out as a blind alley\r\nat the junction of the small intestine with the large, we are safe in\r\nsaying that it is a dwindling structure--the remains of a blind gut\r\nwhich must have been capacious and useful in ancestral forms. In some\r\nmammals, like the rabbit, the blind gut is the bulkiest structure in the\r\nbody, and bears the vermiform appendix at its far end. In man the\r\nappendix alone is left, and it tells its tale. It is interesting to\r\nnotice that it is usually longer in the orang than in man, and that it\r\nis very variable, as dwindling structures tend to be. One of the\r\nunpleasant expressions of this variability is the liability to go wrong:\r\nhence appendicitis. Now these vestigial structures are, as Darwin said,\r\nlike the unsounded, i.e. functionless, letters in words, such as the _o_\r\nin \"leopard,\" the _b_ in \"doubt,\" the _g_ in \"reign.\" They are of no\r\nuse, but they tell us something of the history of the words. So do man's\r\nvestigial structures reveal his pedigree. They must have an historical\r\nor evolutionary significance. No other interpretation is possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: New York Zoological Park._\r\n\r\nCHIMPANZEE, SITTING\r\n\r\nThe head shows certain facial characteristics, e.g. the beetling eyebrow\r\nridges, which were marked in the Neanderthal race of men.

The multiplication of\r\nfinger joints in the whale is a striking feature.]\r\n\r\nSome men, oftener than women, show on the inturned margin of the\r\near-trumpet or pinna, a little conical projection of great interest. It\r\nis a vestige of the tip of the pointed ear of lower mammals, and it is\r\nwell named _Darwin's point_. It was he who described it as a \"surviving\r\nsymbol of the stirring times and dangerous days of man's animal youth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nPhysiological Proof of Man's Relationship with a Simian Stock\r\n\r\nThe everyday functions of the human body are practically the same as\r\nthose of the anthropoid ape, and similar disorders are common to both.\r\nMonkeys may be infected with certain microbes to which man is peculiarly\r\nliable, such as the bacillus of tuberculosis. Darwin showed that various\r\nhuman gestures and facial expressions have their counterparts in\r\nmonkeys. The sneering curl of the upper lip, which tends to expose the\r\ncanine tooth, is a case in point, though it may be seen in many other\r\nmammals besides monkeys--in dogs, for instance, which are at some\r\nconsiderable distance from the simian branch to which man's ancestors\r\nbelonged.\r\n\r\nWhen human blood is transfused into a dog or even a monkey, it behaves\r\nin a hostile way to the other blood, bringing about a destruction of the\r\nred blood corpuscles. But when it is transfused into a chimpanzee there\r\nis an harmonious mingling of the two. This is a very literal\r\ndemonstration of man's blood-relationship with the higher apes. But\r\nthere is a finer form of the same experiment. When the blood-fluid (or\r\nserum) of a rabbit, which has had human blood injected into it, is\r\nmingled with human blood, it forms a cloudy precipitate. It forms almost\r\nas marked a precipitate when it is mingled with the blood of an\r\nanthropoid ape. But when it is mingled with the blood of an American\r\nmonkey there is only a slight clouding after a considerable time and\r\nno actual precipitate. When it is added to the blood of one of the\r\ndistantly related \"half-monkeys\" or lemurs there is no reaction or only\r\na very weak one. With the blood of mammals off the simian line\r\naltogether there is no reaction at all. Thus, as a distinguished\r\nanthropologist, Professor Schwalbe, has said: \"We have in this not only\r\na proof of the literal blood-relationship between man and apes, but the\r\ndegree of relationship with the different main groups of apes can be\r\ndetermined beyond possibility of mistake.\" We can imagine how this\r\nmodern line of experiment would have delighted Darwin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GORILLA, INHABITING THE FOREST TRACT OF THE GABOON IN\r\nAFRICA\r\n\r\nA full-grown individual stands about 5 feet high. The gait is shuffling,\r\nthe strength enormous, the diet mainly vegetarian, the temper rather\r\nferocious.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbryological Proof of Man's Relationship with a Simian Stock\r\n\r\nIn his individual development, man does in some measure climb up his own\r\ngenealogical tree. Stages in the development of the body during its nine\r\nmonths of ante-natal life are closely similar to stages in the\r\ndevelopment of the anthropoid embryo. Babies born in times of famine or\r\nsiege are sometimes, as it were, imperfectly finished, and sometimes\r\nhave what may be described as monkeyish features and ways. A visit to an\r\ninstitution for the care of children who show arrested, defective, or\r\ndisturbed development leaves one sadly impressed with the risk of\r\nslipping down the rungs of the steep ladder of evolution; and even in\r\nadults the occurrence of serious nervous disturbance, such as\r\n\"shell-shock,\" is sometimes marked by relapses to animal ways. It is a\r\nfamiliar fact that a normal baby reveals the past in its surprising\r\npower of grip, and the careful experiments of Dr. Louis Robinson showed\r\nthat an infant three weeks old could support its own weight for over two\r\nminutes, holding on to a horizontal bar. \"In many cases no sign of\r\ndistress is evinced and no cry uttered, until the grasp begins to give\r\nway.\" This persistent grasp probably points back to the time when the\r\nbaby had to cling to its arboreal mother. The human tail is represented\r\nin the adult by a fusion of four or five vertebræ forming the \"coccyx\"\r\nat the end of the backbone, and is normally concealed beneath the\r\nflesh, but in the embryo the tail projects freely and is movable. Up to\r\nthe sixth month of the ante-natal sleep the body is covered, all but the\r\npalms and soles, with longish hair (the lanugo), which usually\r\ndisappears before birth. This is a stage in the normal development,\r\nwhich is reasonably interpreted as a recapitulation of a stage in the\r\nracial evolution. We draw this inference when we find that the unborn\r\noffspring of an almost hairless whale has an abundant representation of\r\nhairs; we must draw a similar inference in the case of man.\r\n\r\nIt must be noticed that there are two serious errors in the careless\r\nstatement often made that man in his development is at one time like a\r\nlittle fish, at a later stage like a little reptile, at a later stage\r\nlike a little primitive mammal, and eventually like a little monkey. The\r\nfirst error here is that the comparison should be made with\r\n_embryo_-fish, _embryo_-reptile, _embryo_-mammal, and so on. It is in\r\nthe making of the embryos that the great resemblance lies. When the\r\nhuman embryo shows the laying down of the essential vertebrate\r\ncharacters, such as brain and spinal cord, then it is closely comparable\r\nto the embryo of a lower vertebrate at a similar stage. When, at a\r\nsubsequent stage, its heart, for instance, is about to become a\r\nfour-chambered mammalian heart, it is closely comparable to the heart\r\nof, let us say, a turtle, which never becomes more than three-chambered.\r\nThe point is that in the making of the organs of the body, say brain and\r\nkidneys, the embryo of man pursues a path closely corresponding to the\r\npath followed by the embryos of other backboned animals lower in the\r\nscale, but at successive stages it parts company with these, with the\r\nlowest first and so on in succession. A human embryo is never like a\r\nlittle reptile, but the developing organs pass through stages which very\r\nclosely resemble the corresponding stages in lower types which are in a\r\ngeneral way ancestral.\r\n\r\nThe second error is that every kind of animal, man included, has from\r\nthe first a certain individuality, with peculiar characteristics which\r\nare all its own. This is expressed by the somewhat difficult word\r\n_specificity_, which just means that every species is itself and no\r\nother. So in the development of the human embryo, while there are close\r\nresemblances to the embryos of apes, monkeys, other mammals, and even,\r\nat earlier stages still, to the embryos of reptile and fish, it has to\r\nbe admitted that we are dealing from first to last with a human embryo\r\nwith peculiarities of its own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"DARWIN'S POINT\" ON HUMAN EAR (MARKED D.P.)\r\n\r\nIt corresponds to the tip (T) of the ear of an ordinary mammal, as shown\r\nin the hare's ear below.

One of the foremost living anthropologists and a\r\nleading authority on the antiquity of man.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _After T. H.

For in this living\r\nmicrocosm, only a small fraction (1/125) of an inch in diameter, there\r\nis condensed--who can imagine how?--all the natural inheritance of man,\r\nall the legacy of his parentage, of his ancestry, of his long pre-human\r\npedigree. Darwin called the pinhead brain of the ant the most marvellous\r\natom of matter in the world, but the human ovum is more marvellous\r\nstill. It has more possibilities in it than any other thing, yet without\r\nfertilisation it will die. The fertilised ovum divides and redivides;\r\nthere results a ball of cells and a sack of cells; gradually division of\r\nlabour becomes the rule; there is a laying down of nervous system and\r\nfood-canal, muscular system and skeleton, and so proceeds what is\r\nlearnedly called differentiation. Out of the apparently simple there\r\nemerges the obviously complex. As Aristotle observed more than two\r\nthousand years ago, in the developing egg of the hen there soon appears\r\nthe beating heart! There is nothing like this in the non-living world.\r\nBut to return to the developing human embryo, there is formed from and\r\nabove the embryonic food-canal a skeletal rod, which is called the\r\nnotochord. It thrills the imagination to learn that this is the only\r\nsupporting axis that the lower orders of the backboned race possess. The\r\ncurious thing is that it does not become the backbone, which is\r\ncertainly one of the essential features of the vertebrate race. The\r\nnotochord is the supporting axis of the pioneer backboned animals,\r\nnamely the Lancelets and the Round-mouths (Cyclostomes), such as the\r\nLamprey. They have no backbone in the strict sense, but they have this\r\nnotochord. It can easily be dissected out in the lamprey--a long gristly\r\nrod. It is surrounded by a sheath which becomes the backbone of most\r\nfishes and of all higher animals. The interesting point is that although\r\nthe notochord is only a vestige in the adults of these types, it is\r\nnever absent from the embryo. It occurs even in man, a short-lived relic\r\nof the primeval supporting axis of the body. It comes and then it goes,\r\nleaving only minute traces in the adult. We cannot say that it is of any\r\nuse, unless it serves as a stimulus to the development of its\r\nsubstitute, the backbone. It is only a piece of preliminary scaffolding,\r\nbut there is no more eloquent instance of the living hand of the past.\r\n\r\nOne other instance must suffice of what Professor Lull calls the\r\nwonderful changes wrought in the dark of the ante-natal period, which\r\nrecapitulate in rapid abbreviation the great evolutionary steps which\r\nwere taken by man's ancestors \"during the long night of the geological\r\npast.\" On the sides of the neck of the human embryo there are four pairs\r\nof slits, the \"visceral clefts,\" openings from the beginning of the\r\nfood-canals to the surface. There is no doubt as to their significance.\r\nThey correspond to the gill-slits of fishes and tadpoles. Yet in\r\nreptiles, birds, and mammals they have no connection with breathing,\r\nwhich is their function in fishes and amphibians. Indeed, they are not\r\nof any use at all, except that the first becomes the Eustachian tube\r\nbringing the ear-passage into connection with the back of the mouth, and\r\nthat the second and third have to do with the development of a curious\r\norgan called the thymus gland. Persistent, nevertheless, these\r\ngill-slits are, recalling even in man an aquatic ancestry of many\r\nmillions of years ago.\r\n\r\nWhen all these lines of evidence are considered, they are seen to\r\nconverge in the conclusion that man is derived from a simian stock of\r\nmammals. He is solidary with the rest of creation. To quote the closing\r\nwords of Darwin's _Descent of Man_:\r\n\r\n    We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man with all\r\n    his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased,\r\n    with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the\r\n    humblest living creature, with his God-like intellect, which has\r\n    penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar\r\n    system--with all these exalted powers--man still bears in his bodily\r\n    frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.\r\n\r\nWe should be clear that this view does not say more than that man sprang\r\nfrom a stock common to him and to the higher apes. Those who are\r\nrepelled by the idea of man's derivation from a simian type should\r\nremember that the theory implies rather more than this, namely, that man\r\nis the outcome of a genealogy which has implied many millions of years\r\nof experimenting and sifting--the groaning and travailing of a whole\r\ncreation. Speaking of man's mental qualities, Sir Ray Lankester says:\r\n\"They justify the view that man forms a new departure in the gradual\r\nunfolding of Nature's predestined plan.\" In any case, we have to try to\r\nsquare our views with the facts, not the facts with our views, and while\r\none of the facts is that man stands unique and apart, the other is that\r\nman is a scion of a progressive simian stock. Naturalists have exposed\r\nthe pit whence man has been digged and the rock whence he has been hewn,\r\nbut it is surely a heartening encouragement to know that it is an\r\nascent, not a descent, that we have behind us. There is wisdom in\r\nPascal's maxim:\r\n\r\n    It is dangerous to show man too plainly how like he is to the\r\n    animals, without, at the same time, reminding him of his greatness.\r\n    It is equally unwise to impress him with his greatness and not with\r\n    his lowliness. It is worse to leave him in ignorance of both. But it\r\n    is very profitable to recognise the two facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nMan's Pedigree\r\n\r\nThe facts of anatomy, physiology, and embryology, of which we have given\r\nillustrations, all point to man's affiliation with the order of monkeys\r\nand apes. To this order is given the name Primates, and our first and\r\nsecond question must be when and whence the Primates began. The rock\r\nrecord answers the first question: the Primates emerged about the dawn\r\nof the Eocene era, when grass was beginning to cover the earth with a\r\ngarment. Their ancestral home was in the north in both hemispheres, and\r\nthen they migrated to Africa, India, Malay, and South America. In North\r\nAmerica the Primates soon became extinct, and the same thing happened\r\nlater on in Europe. In this case, however, there was a repeopling from\r\nthe South (in the Lower Miocene) and then a second extinction (in the\r\nUpper Pliocene) before man appeared. There is considerable evidence in\r\nsupport of Professor R. S. Lull's conclusion, that in Southern Asia,\r\nAfrica, and South America the evolution of Primates was continuous since\r\nthe first great southward migration, and there is, of course, an\r\nabundant modern representation of Primates in these regions to-day.\r\n\r\nAs to the second question: Whence the Primates sprang, the answer must\r\nbe more conjectural. But it is a reasonable view that Carnivores and\r\nPrimates sprang from a common Insectivore stock, the one order diverging\r\ntowards flesh-eating and hunting on the ground, the other order\r\ndiverging towards fruit-eating and arboreal habits. There is no doubt\r\nthat the Insectivores (including shrews, tree-shrews, hedgehog, mole,\r\nand the like) were very plastic and progressive mammals.\r\n\r\nWhat followed in the course of ages was the divergence of branch after\r\nbranch from the main Primate stem. First there diverged the South\r\nAmerican monkeys on a line of their own, and then the Old World monkeys,\r\nsuch as the macaques and baboons. Ages passed and the main stems gave\r\noff (in the Oligocene period) the branch now represented by the small\r\nanthropoid apes--the gibbon and the siamang. Distinctly later there\r\ndiverged the branch of the large anthropoid apes--the gorilla, the\r\nchimpanzee, and the orang. That left a generalised humanoid stock\r\nseparated off from all monkeys and apes, and including the immediate\r\nprecursors of man. When this sifting out of a generalised humanoid stock\r\ntook place remains very uncertain, some authorities referring it to the\r\nMiocene, others to the early Pliocene. Some would estimate its date at\r\nhalf a million years ago, others at two millions! The fact is that\r\nquestions of chronology do not as yet admit of scientific statement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE-VIEW OF SKULL OF MAN (M) AND GORILLA (G)\r\n\r\nNotice in the gorilla's skull the protrusive face region, the big\r\neyebrow ridges, the much less domed cranial cavity, the massive lower\r\njaw, the big canine teeth.

Professor Lull points out that Asia is nearest to the\r\noldest known human remains (in Java), and that Asia was the seat of the\r\nmost ancient civilisations and the original home of many domesticated\r\nanimals and cultivated plants. The probability is that the cradle of the\r\nhuman race was in Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan's Arboreal Apprenticeship\r\n\r\nAt this point it will be useful to consider man's arboreal\r\napprenticeship and how he became a terrestrial journeyman. Professor\r\nWood Jones has worked out very convincingly the thesis that man had no\r\ndirect four-footed ancestry, but that the Primate stock to which he\r\nbelongs was from its first divergence arboreal. He maintains that the\r\nleading peculiarities of the immediate precursors of man were wrought\r\nout during a long arboreal apprenticeship. The first great gain of\r\narboreal life on bipedal erect lines (not after the quadrupedal fashion\r\nof tree-sloths, for instance) was the emancipation of the hand. The\r\nfoot became the supporting and branch-gripping member, and the hand was\r\nset free to reach upward, to hang on by, to seize the fruit, to lift it\r\nand hold it to the mouth, and to hug the young one close to the breast.\r\nThe hand thus set free has remained plastic--a generalised, not a\r\nspecialised member. Much has followed from man's \"handiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe arboreal life had many other consequences. It led to an increased\r\nfreedom of movement of the thigh on the hip joint, to muscular\r\narrangements for balancing the body on the leg, to making the backbone a\r\nsupple yet stable curved pillar, to a strongly developed collar-bone\r\nwhich is only found well-formed when the fore-limb is used for more than\r\nsupport, and to a power of \"opposing\" the thumb and the big toe to the\r\nother digits of the hand and foot--an obvious advantage for\r\nbranch-gripping. But the evolution of a free hand made it possible to\r\ndispense with protrusive lips and gripping teeth. Thus began the\r\nrecession of the snout region, the associated enlargement of the\r\nbrain-box, and the bringing of the eyes to the front. The overcrowding\r\nof the teeth that followed the shortening of the snout was one of the\r\ntaxes on progress of which modern man is often reminded in his dental\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nAnother acquisition associated with arboreal life was a greatly\r\nincreased power of turning the head from side to side--a mobility very\r\nimportant in locating sounds and in exploring with the eyes.\r\nFurthermore, there came about a flattening of the chest and of the back,\r\nand the movements of the midriff (or diaphragm) came to count for more\r\nin respiration than the movements of the ribs. The sense of touch came\r\nto be of more importance and the sense of smell of less; the part of the\r\nbrain receiving tidings from hand and eye and ear came to predominate\r\nover the part for receiving olfactory messages. Finally, the need for\r\ncarrying the infant about among the branches must surely have implied an\r\nintensification of family relations, and favoured the evolution of\r\ngentleness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: New York Zoological Park._\r\n\r\nTHE GIBBON IS LOWER THAN THE OTHER APES AS REGARDS ITS SKULL AND\r\nDENTITION, BUT IT IS HIGHLY SPECIALIZED IN THE ADAPTATION OF ITS LIMBS\r\nTO ARBOREAL LIFE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: New York Zoological Park._\r\n\r\nTHE ORANG HAS A HIGH ROUNDED SKULL AND A LONG FACE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: British Museum (Natural History)._\r\n\r\nCOMPARISONS OF THE SKELETONS OF HORSE AND MAN\r\n\r\nBone for bone, the two skeletons are like one another, though man is a\r\nbiped and the horse a quadruped. The backbone in man is mainly vertical;\r\nthe backbone in the horse is horizontal except in the neck and the tail.\r\nMan's skull is mainly in a line with the backbone; the horse's at an\r\nangle to it. Both man and horse have seven neck vertebræ. Man has five\r\ndigits on each limb; the horse has only one digit well developed on each\r\nlimb.]\r\n\r\nIt may be urged that we are attaching too much importance to the\r\narboreal apprenticeship, since many tree-loving animals remain to-day\r\nvery innocent creatures. To this reasonable objection there are two\r\nanswers, first that in its many acquisitions the arboreal evolution of\r\nthe _humanoid_ precursors of man prepared the way for the survival of a\r\n_human_ type marked by a great step in brain-development; and second\r\nthat the passage from the humanoid to the human was probably associated\r\nwith _a return to mother earth_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Professor Lull, to whose fine textbook, _Organic Evolution_\r\n(1917), we are much indebted, \"climatic conditions in Asia in the\r\nMiocene or early Pliocene were such as to compel the descent of the\r\npre-human ancestor from the trees, a step which was absolutely essential\r\nto further human development.\" Continental elevation and consequent\r\naridity led to a dwindling of the forests, and forced the ape-man to\r\ncome to earth. \"And at the last arose the man.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Lull, the descent from the trees was associated with the\r\nassumption of a more erect posture, with increased liberation and\r\nplasticity of the hand, with becoming a hunter, with experiments towards\r\nclothing and shelter, with an exploring habit, and with the beginning of\r\ncommunal life.\r\n\r\nIt is a plausible view that the transition from the humanoid to the\r\nhuman was effected by a discontinuous variation of considerable\r\nmagnitude, what is nowadays called a _mutation_, and that it had mainly\r\nto do with the brain and the vocal organs. But given the gains of the\r\narboreal apprenticeship, the stimulus of an enforced descent to terra\r\nfirma, and an evolving brain and voice, we can recognise accessory\r\nfactors which helped success to succeed. Perhaps the absence of great\r\nphysical strength prompted reliance on wits; the prolongation of infancy\r\nwould help to educate the parents in gentleness; the strengthening of\r\nthe feeling of kinship would favour the evolution of family and social\r\nlife--of which there are many anticipations at lower levels. There is\r\nmuch truth in the saying: \"Man did not make society, society made man.\"\r\n\r\nA continuation of the story will deal with the emergence of the\r\nprimitive types of man and the gradual ascent of the modern species.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4\r\n\r\nTentative Men\r\n\r\nSo far the story has been that of the sifting out of a humanoid stock\r\nand of the transition to human kind, from the ancestors of apes and men\r\nto the man-ape, and from the man-ape to man. It looks as if the\r\nsifting-out process had proceeded further, for there were several human\r\nbranches that did not lead on to the modern type of man.\r\n\r\n1. The first of these is represented by the scanty fossil remains known\r\nas _Pithecanthropus erectus_, found in Java in fossiliferous beds which\r\ndate from the end of the Pliocene or the beginning of the Pleistocene\r\nera. Perhaps this means half a million years ago, and the remains\r\noccurred along with those of some mammals which are now extinct.\r\nUnfortunately the remains of Pithecanthropus the Erect consisted only of\r\na skull-cap, a thigh-bone, and two back teeth, so it is not surprising\r\nthat experts should differ considerably in their interpretation of what\r\nwas found. Some have regarded the remains as those of a large gibbon,\r\nothers as those of a pre-human ape-man, and others as those of a\r\nprimitive man off the main line of ascent. According to Sir Arthur\r\nKeith, Pithecanthropus was \"a being human in stature, human in gait,\r\nhuman in all its parts, save its brain.\" The thigh-bone indicates a\r\nheight of about 5 feet 7 inches, one inch less than the average height\r\nof the men of to-day. The skull-cap indicates a low, flat forehead,\r\nbeetling brows, and a capacity about two-thirds of the modern size. The\r\nremains were found by Dubois, in 1894, in Trinil in Central Java.\r\n\r\n2. The next offshoot is represented by the Heidelberg man (_Homo\r\nheidelbergensis_), discovered near Heidelberg in 1907 by Dr.\r\nSchoetensack. But the remains consisted only of a lower jaw and its\r\nteeth. Along with this relic were bones of various mammals, including\r\nsome long since extinct in Europe, such as elephant, rhinoceros, bison,\r\nand lion. The circumstances indicate an age of perhaps 300,000 years\r\nago. There were also very crude flint implements (or eoliths). But the\r\nteeth are human teeth, and the jaw seems transitional between that of an\r\nanthropoid ape and that of man. Thus there was no chin. According to\r\nmost authorities the lower jaw from the Heidelberg sand-pit must be\r\nregarded as a relic of a primitive type off the main line of human\r\nascent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE JAVA MAN\r\n\r\n(_Pithecanthropus erectus._)]\r\n\r\n3. It was in all probability in the Pliocene that there took origin the\r\nNeanderthal species of man, _Homo neanderthalensis_, first known from\r\nremains found in 1856 in the Neanderthal ravine near Düsseldorf.\r\nAccording to some authorities Neanderthal man was living in Europe a\r\nquarter of a million years ago. Other specimens were afterwards found\r\nelsewhere, e.g. in Belgium (\"the men of Spy\"), in France, in Croatia,\r\nand at Gibraltar, so that a good deal is known of Neanderthal man. He\r\nwas a loose-limbed fellow, short of stature and of slouching gait, but a\r\nskilful artificer, fashioning beautifully worked flints with a\r\ncharacteristic style. He used fire; he buried his dead reverently and\r\nfurnished them with an outfit for a long journey; and he had a big\r\nbrain. But he had great beetling, ape-like eyebrow ridges and massive\r\njaws, and he showed \"simian characters swarming in the details of his\r\nstructure.\" In most of the points in which he differs from modern man he\r\napproaches the anthropoid apes, and he must be regarded as a low type of\r\nman off the main line. Huxley regarded the Neanderthal man as a low form\r\nof the modern type, but expert opinion seems to agree rather with the\r\nview maintained in 1864 by Professor William King of Galway, that the\r\nNeanderthal man represents a distinct species off the main line of\r\nascent. He disappeared with apparent suddenness (like some aboriginal\r\nraces to-day) about the end of the Fourth Great Ice Age; but there is\r\nevidence that before he ceased to be there had emerged a successor\r\nrather than a descendant--the modern man.\r\n\r\n4. Another offshoot from the main line is probably represented by the\r\nPiltdown man, found in Sussex in 1912. The remains consisted of the\r\nwalls of the skull, which indicate a large brain, and a high forehead\r\nwithout the beetling eyebrows of the Neanderthal man and\r\nPithecanthropus. The \"find\" included a tooth and part of a lower jaw,\r\nbut these perhaps belong to some ape, for they are very discrepant. The\r\nPiltdown skull represents the most ancient human remains as yet found in\r\nBritain, and Dr. Smith Woodward's establishment of a separate genus\r\nEoanthropus expresses his conviction that the Piltdown man was off the\r\nline of the evolution of the modern type. If the tooth and piece of\r\nlower jaw belong to the Piltdown skull, then there was a remarkable\r\ncombination of ape-like and human characters. As regards the brain,\r\n_inferred_ from the skull-walls, Sir Arthur Keith says:\r\n\r\n    All the essential features of the brain of modern man are to be seen\r\n    in the brain cast. There are some which must be regarded as\r\n    primitive. There can be no doubt that it is built on exactly the\r\n    same lines as our modern brains. A few minor alterations would make\r\n    it in all respects a modern brain.... Although our knowledge of the\r\n    human brain is limited--there are large areas to which we can assign\r\n    no definite function--we may rest assured that a brain which was\r\n    shaped in a mould so similar to our own was one which responded to\r\n    the outside world as ours does. Piltdown man saw, heard, felt,\r\n    thought, and dreamt much as we do still.\r\n\r\nAnd this was 150,000 years ago at a modern estimate, and some would say\r\nhalf a million.\r\n\r\nThere is neither agreement nor certainty as to the antiquity of man,\r\nexcept that the modern type was distinguishable from its collaterals\r\nhundreds of thousands of years ago. The general impression left is very\r\ngrand. In remote antiquity the Primate stem diverged from the other\r\norders of mammals; it sent forth its tentative branches, and the result\r\nwas a tangle of monkeys; ages passed and the monkeys were left behind,\r\nwhile the main stem, still probing its way, gave off the Anthropoid\r\napes, both small and large. But they too were left behind, and the main\r\nline gave off other experiments--indications of which we know in Java,\r\nat Heidelberg, in the Neanderthal, and at Piltdown. None of these lasted\r\nor was made perfect. They represent _tentative_ men who had their day\r\nand ceased to be, our predecessors rather than our ancestors. Still, the\r\nmain stem goes on evolving, and who will be bold enough to say what\r\nfruit it has yet to bear!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _After a model by J. H.

They were true men at last--that is to say, like ourselves!\r\nThe spirited pictures they made on the walls of caves in France and\r\nSpain show artistic sense and skill. Well-finished statuettes\r\nrepresenting nude female figures are also known. The elaborate burial\r\ncustoms point to a belief in life after death. They made stone\r\nimplements--knives, scrapers, gravers, and the like, of the type known\r\nas Palæolithic, and these show interesting gradations of skill and\r\npeculiarities of style. The \"Cave-men\" lived between the third and\r\nfourth Ice Ages, along with cave-bear, cave-lion, cave-hyæna, mammoth,\r\nwoolly rhinoceros, Irish elk, and other mammals now extinct--taking us\r\nback to 30,000-50,000 years ago, and many would say much more. Some of\r\nthe big-brained skulls of these Palæolithic cave-men show not a single\r\nfeature that could be called primitive. They show teeth which in size\r\nand form are exactly the same as those of a thousand generations\r\nafterwards--and suffering from gumboil too! There seems little doubt\r\nthat these vigorous Palæolithic Cave-men of Europe were living for a\r\nwhile contemporaneously with the men of Neanderthal, and it is possible\r\nthat they directly or indirectly hastened the disappearance of their\r\nmore primitive collaterals. Curiously enough, however, they had not\r\nthemselves adequate lasting power in Europe, for they seem for the most\r\npart to have dwindled away, leaving perhaps stray present-day survivors\r\nin isolated districts. The probability is that after their decline\r\nEurope was repeopled by immigrants from Asia. It cannot be said that\r\nthere is any inherent biological necessity for the decline of a vigorous\r\nrace--many animal races go back for millions of years--but in mankind\r\nthe historical fact is that a period of great racial vigour and success\r\nis often followed by a period of decline, sometimes leading to practical\r\ndisappearance as a definite race. The causes of this waning remain very\r\nobscure--sometimes environmental, sometimes constitutional, sometimes\r\ncompetitive. Sometimes the introduction of a new parasite, like the\r\nmalaria organism, may have been to blame.\r\n\r\nAfter the Ice Ages had passed, perhaps 25,000 years ago, the Palæolithic\r\nculture gave place to the Neolithic. The men who made rudely dressed but\r\noften beautiful stone implements were succeeded or replaced by men who\r\nmade polished stone implements. The earliest inhabitants of Scotland\r\nwere of this Neolithic culture, migrating from the Continent when the\r\nice-fields of the Great Glaciation had disappeared. Their remains are\r\noften associated with the \"Fifty-foot Beach\" which, though now high and\r\ndry, was the seashore in early Neolithic days. Much is known about these\r\nmen of the polished stones. They were hunters, fowlers, and fishermen;\r\nwithout domesticated animals or agriculture; short folk, two or three\r\ninches below the present standard; living an active strenuous life.\r\nSimilarly, for the south, Sir Arthur Keith pictures for us a Neolithic\r\ncommunity at Coldrum in Kent, dating from about 4,000 years ago--a few\r\nticks of the geological clock. It consisted, in this case, of\r\nagricultural pioneers, men with large heads and big brains, about two\r\ninches shorter in stature than the modern British average (5 ft. 8 in.),\r\nwith better teeth and broader palates than men have in these days of\r\nsoft food, with beliefs concerning life and death similar to those that\r\nswayed their contemporaries in Western and Southern Europe. Very\r\ninteresting is the manipulative skill they showed on a large scale in\r\nerecting standing stones (probably connected with calendar-keeping and\r\nwith worship), and on a small scale in making daring operations on the\r\nskull. Four thousand years ago is given as a probable date for that\r\nearly community in Kent, but evidences of Neolithic man occur in\r\nsituations which demand a much greater antiquity--perhaps 30,000 years.\r\nAnd man was not young then!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAINTINGS ON THE ROOF OF THE ALTAMIRA CAVE IN NORTHERN\r\nSPAIN, SHOWING A BISON ABOVE AND A GALLOPING BOAR BELOW\r\n\r\nThe artistic drawings, over 2 feet in length, were made by the Reindeer\r\nMen or \"Cromagnards\" in the time of the Upper or Post-Glacial\r\nPleistocene, before the appearance of the Neolithic men.]\r\n\r\nWe must open one more chapter in the thrilling story of the Ascent of\r\nMan--the Metal Ages, which are in a sense still continuing. Metals began\r\nto be used in the late Polished Stone (Neolithic) times, for there were\r\nalways overlappings. Copper came first, Bronze second, and Iron last.\r\nThe working of copper in the East has been traced back to the fourth\r\nmillennium B.C., and there was also a very ancient Copper Age in the New\r\nWorld. It need hardly be said that where copper is scarce, as in\r\nBritain, we cannot expect to find much trace of a Copper Age.\r\n\r\nThe ores of different metals seem to have been smelted together in an\r\nexperimental way by many prehistoric metallurgists, and bronze was the\r\nalloy that rewarded the combination of tin with copper. There is\r\nevidence of a more or less definite Bronze Age in Egypt and Babylonia,\r\nGreece and Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear why iron should not have been the earliest metal to be\r\nused by man, but the Iron Age dates from about the middle of the second\r\nmillennium B.C. From Egypt the usage spread through the Mediterranean\r\nregion to North Europe, or it may have been that discoveries made in\r\nCentral Europe, so rich in iron-mines, saturated southwards, following\r\nfor instance, the route of the amber trade from the Baltic. Compared\r\nwith stone, the metals afforded much greater possibilities of\r\nimplements, instruments, and weapons, and their discovery and usage had\r\nundoubtedly great influence on the Ascent of Man. Occasionally, however,\r\non his descent.\r\n\r\n\r\nRetrospect\r\n\r\nLooking backwards, we discern the following stages: (1) The setting\r\napart of a Primate stock, marked off from other mammals by a tendency to\r\nbig brains, a free hand, gregariousness, and good-humoured\r\ntalkativeness. (2) The divergence of marmosets and New World monkeys and\r\nOld World monkeys, leaving a stock--an anthropoid stock--common to the\r\npresent-day and extinct apes and to mankind. (3) From this common stock\r\nthe Anthropoid apes diverged, far from ignoble creatures, and a humanoid\r\nstock was set apart. (4) From the latter (we follow Sir Arthur Keith and\r\nother authorities) there arose what may be called, without\r\ndisparagement, tentative or experimental men, indicated by\r\nPithecanthropus \"the Erect,\" the Heidelberg man, the Neanderthalers,\r\nand, best of all, the early men of the Sussex Weald--hinted at by the\r\nPiltdown skull. It matters little whether particular items are\r\ncorroborated or disproved--e.g. whether the Heidelberg man came before\r\nor after the Neanderthalers--the general trend of evolution remains\r\nclear. (5) In any case, the result was the evolution of _Homo sapiens,\r\nthe man we are_--a quite different fellow from the Neanderthaler. (6)\r\nThen arose various stocks of primitive men, proving everything and\r\nholding fast to that which is good. There were the Palæolithic peoples,\r\nwith rude stone implements, a strong vigorous race, but probably, in\r\nmost cases, supplanted by fresh experiments. These may have arisen as\r\nshoots from the growing point of the old race, or as a fresh offshoot\r\nfrom more generalised members at a lower level. This is the eternal\r\npossible victory alike of aristocracy and democracy. (7) Palæolithic men\r\nwere involved in the succession of four Great Ice Ages or\r\nGlaciations, and it may be that the human race owes much to the\r\nalternation of hard times and easy times--glacial and interglacial. When\r\nthe ice-fields cleared off Neolithic man had his innings. (8) And we\r\nhave closed the story, in the meantime, with the Metal Ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _After the restoration modelled by J. H.

They disappeared somewhat suddenly, being\r\nreplaced by the Modern Man type, such as the Cromagnards. Many regard\r\nthe Neanderthal Men as a distinct species.]\r\n\r\nIt seems not unfitting that we should at this point sound another\r\nnote--that of the man of feeling. It is clear in William James's words:\r\n\r\n    Bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, are these half-brutish\r\n    prehistoric brothers. Girdled about with the immense darkness of\r\n    this mysterious universe even as we are, they were born and died,\r\n    suffered and struggled. Given over to fearful crime and passion,\r\n    plunged in the blackest ignorance, preyed upon by hideous and\r\n    grotesque delusions, yet steadfastly serving the profoundest of\r\n    ideals in their fixed faith that existence in any form is better\r\n    than non-existence, they ever rescued triumphantly from the jaws of\r\n    ever imminent destruction the torch of life which, thanks to them,\r\n    now lights the world for us.\r\n\r\n\r\nRaces of Mankind\r\n\r\nGiven a variable stock spreading over diverse territory, we expect to\r\nfind it splitting up into varieties which may become steadied into races\r\nor incipient species. Thus we have races of hive-bees, \"Italians,\"\r\n\"Punics,\" and so forth; and thus there arose races of men. Certain types\r\nsuited certain areas, and periods of in-breeding tended to make the\r\ndistinctive peculiarities of each incipient race well-defined and\r\nstable. When the original peculiarities, say, of negro and Mongol,\r\nAustralian and Caucasian, arose as brusque variations or \"mutations,\"\r\nthen they would have great staying power from generation to generation.\r\nThey would not be readily swamped by intercrossing or averaged off.\r\nPeculiarities and changes of climate and surroundings, not to speak of\r\nother change-producing factors, would provoke new departures from age to\r\nage, and so fresh racial ventures were made. Moreover, the occurrence\r\nof out-breeding when two races met, in peace or in war, would certainly\r\nserve to induce fresh starts. Very important in the evolution of human\r\nraces must have been the alternating occurrence of periods of\r\nin-breeding (endogamy), tending to stability and sameness, and periods\r\nof out-breeding (exogamy), tending to changefulness and diversity.\r\n\r\nThus we may distinguish several more or less clearly defined primitive\r\nraces of mankind--notably the African, the Australian, the Mongolian,\r\nand the Caucasian. The woolly-haired African race includes the negroes\r\nand the very primitive bushmen. The wavy-to curly-haired Australian race\r\nincludes the Jungle Tribes of the Deccan, the Vedda of Ceylon, the\r\nJungle Folk or Semang, and the natives of unsettled parts of\r\nAustralia--all sometimes slumped together as \"Pre-Dravidians.\" The\r\nstraight-haired Mongols include those of Tibet, Indo-China, China, and\r\nFormosa, those of many oceanic islands, and of the north from Japan to\r\nLapland. The Caucasians include Mediterraneans, Semites, Nordics,\r\nAfghans, Alpines, and many more.\r\n\r\nThere are very few corners of knowledge more difficult than that of the\r\nRaces of Men, the chief reason being that there has been so much\r\nmovement and migration in the course of the ages. One physical type has\r\nmingled with another, inducing strange amalgams and novelties. If we\r\nstart with what might be called \"zoological\" races or strains differing,\r\nfor instance, in their hair (woolly-haired Africans, straight-haired\r\nMongols, curly-or wavy-haired Pre-Dravidians and Caucasians), we find\r\nthese replaced by _peoples_ who are mixtures of various races, \"brethren\r\nby civilisation more than by blood.\" As Professor Flinders Petrie has\r\nsaid, the only meaning the term \"race\" now can have is that of a group\r\nof human beings whose type has been unified by their rate of\r\nassimilation exceeding the rate of change produced by the infiltration\r\nof foreign elements. It is probable, however, that the progress of\r\nprecise anthropology will make it possible to distinguish the various\r\nracial \"strains\" that make up any people. For the human sense of race\r\nis so strong that it convinces us of reality even when scientific\r\ndefinition is impossible. It was this the British sailor expressed in\r\nhis answer to the question \"What is a Dago?\" \"Dagoes,\" he replied, \"is\r\nanything wot isn't our sort of chaps.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESTORATION BY A. FORESTIER OF THE RHODESIAN MAN WHOSE\r\nSKULL WAS DISCOVERED IN 1921\r\n\r\nAttention may be drawn to the beetling eyebrow ridges, the projecting\r\nupper lip, the large eye-sockets, the well-poised head, the strong\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nThe squatting figure is crushing seeds with a stone, and a crusher is\r\nlying on the rock to his right.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESTORATION BY A.

This new Rhodesian cave-man may be regarded as a southern\r\nrepresentative of a Neanderthal race, or as an extinct type intermediate\r\nbetween the Neanderthal Men and the Modern Man type.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps in Human Evolution\r\n\r\nReal men arose, we believe, by variational uplifts of considerable\r\nmagnitude which led to big and complex brains and to the power of\r\nreasoned discourse. In some other lines of mammalian evolution there\r\nwere from time to time great advances in the size and complexity of the\r\nbrain, as is clear, for instance, in the case of horses and elephants.\r\nThe same is true of birds as compared with reptiles, and everyone\r\nrecognises the high level of excellence that has been attained by their\r\nvocal powers. How these great cerebral advances came about we do not\r\nknow, but it has been one of the main trends of animal evolution to\r\nimprove the nervous system. Two suggestions may be made. First, the\r\nprolongation of the period of ante-natal life, in intimate physiological\r\npartnership with the mother, may have made it practicable to start the\r\nhigher mammal with a much better brain than in the lower orders, like\r\nInsectivores and Rodents, and still more Marsupials, where the period\r\nbefore birth (gestation) is short. Second, we know that the individual\r\ndevelopment of the brain is profoundly influenced by the internal\r\nsecretions of certain ductless glands notably the thyroid. When this\r\norgan is not functioning properly the child's brain development is\r\narrested. It may be that increased production of certain\r\nhormones--itself, of course, to be accounted for--may have stimulated\r\nbrain development in man's remote ancestors.\r\n\r\nGiven variability along the line of better brains and given a process of\r\ndiscriminate sifting which would consistently offer rewards to alertness\r\nand foresight, to kin-sympathy and parental care, there seems no great\r\ndifficulty in imagining how Man would evolve. We must not think of an\r\nAristotle or a Newton except as fine results which justify all the\r\ngroaning and travailing; we must think of average men, of primitive\r\npeoples to-day, and of our forbears long ago. We must remember how much\r\nof man's advance is dependent on the external registration of the social\r\nheritage, not on the slowly changing natural inheritance.\r\n\r\nLooking backwards it is impossible, we think, to fail to recognise\r\nprogress. There is a ring of truth in the fine description Æschylus gave\r\nof primitive men that--\r\n\r\n    first, beholding they beheld in vain, and, hearing, heard not, but,\r\n    like shapes in dreams, mixed all things wildly down the tedious\r\n    time, nor knew to build a house against the sun with wicketed sides,\r\n    nor any woodwork knew, but lived like silly ants, beneath the\r\n    ground, in hollow caves unsunned. There came to them no steadfast\r\n    sign of winter, nor of spring flower-perfumed, nor of summer full of\r\n    fruit, but blindly and lawlessly they did all things.\r\n\r\nContrast this picture with the position of man to-day. He has mastered\r\nthe forces of Nature and is learning to use their resources more and\r\nmore economically; he has harnessed electricity to his chariot and he\r\nhas made the ether carry his messages. He tapped supplies of material\r\nwhich seemed for centuries unavailable, having learned, for instance,\r\nhow to capture and utilise the free nitrogen of the air. With his\r\ntelegraph and \"wireless\" he has annihilated distance, and he has added\r\nto his navigable kingdom the depths of the sea and the heights of the\r\nair. He has conquered one disease after another, and the young science\r\nof heredity is showing him how to control in his domesticated animals\r\nand cultivated plants the nature of the generations yet unborn. With all\r\nhis faults he has his ethical face set in the right direction. The main\r\nline of movement is towards the fuller embodiment of the true, the\r\nbeautiful, and the good in healthy lives which are increasingly a\r\nsatisfaction in themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: British Museum (Natural History)._\r\n\r\nSIDE-VIEW OF A PREHISTORIC HUMAN SKULL DISCOVERED IN 1921 IN BROKEN HILL\r\nCAVE, NORTHERN RHODESIA\r\n\r\nVery striking are the prominent eyebrow ridges and the broad massive\r\nface.

Firelight must have\r\nbeen used in making these cave drawings and engravings.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFactors in Human Progress\r\n\r\nMany, we believe, were the gains that rewarded the arboreal\r\napprenticeship of man's ancestors. Many, likewise, were the results of\r\nleaving the trees and coming down to the solid earth--a transition which\r\nmarked the emergence of more than tentative men. What great steps\r\nfollowed?\r\n\r\nSome of the greatest were--the working out of a spoken language and of\r\nexternal methods of registration; the invention of tools; the discovery\r\nof the use of fire; the utilisation of iron and other metals; the taming\r\nof wild animals such as dog and sheep, horses and cattle; the\r\ncultivation of wild plants such as wheat and rice; and the irrigation of\r\nfields. All through the ages necessity has been the mother of invention\r\nand curiosity its father; but perhaps we miss the heart of the matter if\r\nwe forget the importance of some leisure time--wherein to observe and\r\nthink. If our earth had been so clouded that the stars were hidden from\r\nmen's eyes the whole history of our race would have been different. For\r\nit was through his leisure-time observations of the stars that early man\r\ndiscovered the regularity of the year and got his fundamental\r\nimpressions of the order of Nature--on which all his science is founded.\r\n\r\nIf we are to think clearly of the factors of human progress we must\r\nrecall the three great biological ideas--the living organism, its\r\nenvironment, and its functioning. For man these mean (1) the living\r\ncreature, the outcome of parents and ancestors, a fresh expression of a\r\nbodily and mental inheritance; (2) the surroundings, including climate\r\nand soil, the plants and animals these allow; and (3) the activities of\r\nall sorts, occupations and habits, all the actions and reactions between\r\nman and his milieu. In short, we have to deal with FOLK, PLACE, WORK;\r\nthe _Famille_, _Lieu_, _Travail_ of the LePlay school.\r\n\r\nAs to FOLK, human progress depends on intrinsic racial\r\nqualities--notably health and vigour of body, clearness and alertness of\r\nmind, and an indispensable sociality. The most powerful factors in the\r\nworld are clear ideas in the minds of energetic men of good will. The\r\ndifferences in bodily and mental health which mark races, and stocks\r\nwithin a people, just as they mark individuals, are themselves traceable\r\nback to germinal variations or mutations, and to the kind of sifting to\r\nwhich the race or stock has been subjected. Easygoing conditions are not\r\nonly without stimulus to new departures, they are without the sifting\r\nwhich progress demands.\r\n\r\nAs to PLACE, it is plain that different areas differ greatly in their\r\nmaterial resources and in the availability of these. Moreover, even when\r\nabundant material resources are present, they will not make for much\r\nprogress unless the climate is such that they can be readily utilised.\r\nIndeed, climate has been one of the great factors in civilisation, here\r\nstimulating and there depressing energy, in one place favouring certain\r\nplants and animals important to man, in another place preventing their\r\npresence. Moreover, climate has slowly changed from age to age.\r\n\r\nAs to WORK, the form of a civilisation is in some measure dependent on\r\nthe primary occupations, whether hunting or fishing, farming or\r\nshepherding; and on the industries of later ages which have a profound\r\nmoulding effect on the individual at least. We cannot, however, say more\r\nthan that the factors of human progress have always had these three\r\naspects, Folk, Place, Work, and that if progress is to continue on\r\nstable lines it must always recognise the essential correlation of\r\nfitter folk in body and mind: improved habits and functions, alike in\r\nwork and leisure; and bettered surroundings in the widest and deepest\r\nsense.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n DARWIN, CHARLES, _Descent of Man_.\r\n HADDON, A.

It means the ceaseless process of Becoming, linking\r\ngeneration to generation of living creatures. The Doctrine of Evolution\r\nstates the fact that the present is the child of the past and the parent\r\nof the future. It comes to this, that the living plants and animals we\r\nknow are descended from ancestors on the whole simpler, and these from\r\nothers likewise simpler, and so on, back and back--till we reach the\r\nfirst living creatures, of which, unfortunately, we know nothing.\r\nEvolution is a process of racial change in a definite direction, whereby\r\nnew forms arise, take root, and flourish, alongside of or in the place\r\nof their ancestors, which were in most cases rather simpler in structure\r\nand behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe rock-record, which cannot be wrong, though we may read it wrongly,\r\nshows clearly that there was once a time in the history of the Earth\r\nwhen the only backboned animals were Fishes. Ages passed, and there\r\nevolved Amphibians, with fingers and toes, scrambling on to dry land.\r\nAges passed, and there evolved Reptiles, in bewildering profusion. There\r\nwere fish-lizards and sea-serpents, terrestrial dragons and flying\r\ndragons, a prolific and varied stock. From the terrestrial Dinosaurs it\r\nseems that Birds and Mammals arose. In succeeding ages there evolved all\r\nthe variety of Birds and all the variety of Mammals. Until at last arose\r\nthe Man. The question is whether similar processes of evolution are\r\nstill going on.\r\n\r\nWe are so keenly aware of rapid changes in mankind, though these\r\nconcern the social heritage much more than the flesh-and-blood natural\r\ninheritance, that we find no difficulty in the idea that evolution is\r\ngoing on in mankind. We know the contrast between modern man and\r\nprimitive man, and we are convinced that in the past, at least, progress\r\nhas been a reality. That degeneration may set in is an awful\r\npossibility--involution rather than evolution--but even if going back\r\nbecame for a time the rule, we cannot give up the hope that the race\r\nwould recover itself and begin afresh to go forward. For although there\r\nhave been retrogressions in the history of life, continued through\r\nunthinkably long ages, and although great races, the Flying Dragons for\r\ninstance, have become utterly extinct, leaving no successors whatsoever,\r\nwe feel sure that there has been on the whole a progress towards nobler,\r\nmore masterful, more emancipated, more intelligent, and _better_ forms\r\nof life--a progress towards what mankind at its best has always regarded\r\nas best, i.e. affording most enduring satisfaction. So we think of\r\nevolution going on in mankind, evolution chequered by involution, but on\r\nthe whole _progressive evolution_.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvolutionary Prospect for Man\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that man's body will admit of _great_ change, but there\r\nis room for some improvement, e.g. in the superfluous length of the\r\nfood-canal and the overcrowding of the teeth. It is likely, however,\r\nthat there will be constitutional changes, e.g. of prolonged\r\nyouthfulness, a higher standard of healthfulness, and a greater\r\nresistance to disease. It is justifiable to look forward to great\r\nimprovements in intelligence and in control. The potentialities of the\r\nhuman brain, as it is, are far from being utilised to the full, and new\r\ndepartures of promise are of continual occurrence. What is of great\r\nimportance is that the new departures or variations which emerge in fine\r\nchildren should be fostered, not nipped in the bud, by the social\r\nenvironment, education included. The evolutionary prospect for man is\r\npromising.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPH OF A MEDIAN SECTION THROUGH THE SHELL OF THE\r\nPEARLY NAUTILUS\r\n\r\nIt is only the large terminal chamber that is occupied by the animal.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHOTOGRAPH OF THE ENTIRE SHELL OF THE PEARLY NAUTILUS\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the Nautilus are in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.\r\nThey sometimes swim at the surface of the sea, but they usually creep\r\nslowly about on the floor of comparatively shallow water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NAUTILUS\r\n\r\nA section through the Pearly Nautilus, _Nautilus pompilius_, common from\r\nMalay to Fiji. The shell is often about 9 inches long. The animal lives\r\nin the last chamber only, but a tube (S) runs through the empty\r\nchambers, perforating the partitions (SE). The bulk of the animal is\r\nmarked VM; the eye is shown at E; a hood is marked H; round the mouth\r\nthere are numerous lobes (L) bearing protrusible tentacles, some of\r\nwhich are shown. When the animal is swimming near the surface the\r\ntentacles radiate out in all directions, and it has been described as \"a\r\nshell with something like a cauliflower sticking out of it.\" The Pearly\r\nNautilus is a good example of a conservative type, for it began in the\r\nTriassic Era. But the family of Nautiloids to which it belongs\r\nillustrates very vividly what is meant by a dwindling race. The\r\nNautiloids began in the Cambrian, reached their golden age in the\r\nSilurian, and began to decline markedly in the Carboniferous. There are\r\n2,500 extinct or fossil species of Nautiloids, and only 4 living\r\nto-day.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: W. S. Berridge._\r\n\r\nSHOEBILL\r\n\r\nA bird of a savage nature, never mixing with other marsh birds.\r\nAccording to Dr. Chalmers Mitchell, it shows affinities to herons,\r\nstorks, pelicans, and gannets, and is a representative of a type equal\r\nto both herons and storks and falling between the two.]\r\n\r\nBut it is very important to realise that among plant and animals\r\nlikewise, _Evolution is going on_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fountain of Change: Variability\r\n\r\nOn an ordinary big clock we do not readily see that even the minute hand\r\nis moving, and if the clock struck only once in a hundred years we can\r\nconceive of people arguing whether the hands did really move at all. So\r\nit often is with the changes that go on from generation to generation in\r\nliving creatures. The flux is so slow, like the flowing of a glacier,\r\nthat some people fail to be convinced of its reality. And it must, of\r\ncourse, be admitted that some kinds of living creatures, like the\r\nLamp-shell _Ligula_ or the Pearly Nautilus, hardly change from age to\r\nage, whereas others, like some of the birds and butterflies, are always\r\ngiving rise to something new. The Evening Primrose among plants, and the\r\nFruit-fly, Drosophila, among animals, are well-known examples of\r\norganisms which are at present in a sporting or mutating mood.\r\n\r\nCertain dark varieties of moth, e.g. of the Peppered Moth, are taking\r\nthe place of the paler type in some parts of England, and the same is\r\ntrue of some dark forms of Sugar-bird in the West Indian islands. Very\r\nimportant is the piece of statistics worked out by Professor R. C.\r\nPunnett, that \"if a population contains .001 per cent of a new variety,\r\nand if that variety has even a 5 per cent selection advantage over the\r\noriginal form, the latter will almost completely disappear in less than\r\na hundred generations.\" This sort of thing has been going on all over\r\nthe world for untold ages, and the face of animate nature has\r\nconsequently changed.\r\n\r\nWe are impressed by striking novelties that crop up--a clever dwarf, a\r\nmusical genius, a calculating boy, a cock with a 10 ft. tail, a\r\n\"wonder-horse\" with a mane reaching to the ground, a tailless cat, a\r\nwhite blackbird, a copper beech, a Greater Celandine with much cut up\r\nleaves; but this sort of mutation is common, and smaller, less brusque\r\nvariations are commoner still. _They form the raw materials of possible\r\nevolution._ We are actually standing before an apparently inexhaustible\r\nfountain of change. This is evolution going on.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sporting Jellyfish\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to consider a common animal like the jellyfish\r\nAurelia. It is admirably suited for a leisurely life in the open sea,\r\nwhere it swims about by contracting its saucer-shaped body, thus driving\r\nwater out from its concavity. By means of millions of stinging cells on\r\nits four frilled lips and on its marginal tentacles it is able to\r\nparalyse and lasso minute crustaceans and the like, which it then wafts\r\ninto its mouth. It has a very eventful life-history, for it has in its\r\nearly youth to pass through a fixed stage, fastened to rock or seaweed,\r\nbut it is a successful animal, well suited for its habitat, and\r\npractically cosmopolitan in its distribution. It is certainly an\r\nold-established creature. Yet it is very variable in colour and in size,\r\nand even in internal structure. Very often it is the size of a saucer or\r\na soup-plate, but giants over two feet in diameter are well known. Much\r\nmore important, however, than variation in colour and size are the\r\ninborn changes in structure. Normally a jellyfish has its parts in four\r\nor multiples of four. Thus it has four frilled lips, four tufts of\r\ndigestive filaments in its stomach, and four brightly coloured\r\nreproductive organs. It has eight sense-organs round the margin of its\r\ndisc, eight branched and eight unbranched radial canals running from the\r\ncentral stomach to a canal round the circumference. The point of giving\r\nthese details is just this, that every now and then we find a jellyfish\r\nwith its parts in sixes, fives, or threes, and with a multitude of minor\r\nidiosyncrasies. _Even in the well-established jellyfish there is a\r\nfountain of change._\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nEvolution of Plants\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to look at the various kinds of cabbages, such as\r\ncauliflower and Brussels sprouts, kale and curly greens, and remember\r\nthat they are all scions of the not very promising wild cabbage found on\r\nour shores. And are not all the aristocrat apple-trees of our orchards\r\ndescended from the plebeian crab-apple of the roadside? We know far too\r\nlittle about the precise origin of our cultivated plants, but there is\r\nno doubt that after man got a hold of them he took advantage of their\r\nvariability to establish race after race, say, of rose and\r\nchrysanthemum, of potato and cereal. The evolution of cultivated plants\r\nis continuing before our eyes, and the creations of Mr. Luther Burbank,\r\nsuch as the stoneless plum and the primus berry, the spineless cactus\r\nand the Shasta daisy, are merely striking instances of what is always\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the domestic dog has risen three times,\r\nfrom three distinct ancestors--a wolf, a jackal, and a coyote. So a\r\nmultiple pedigree must be allowed for in the case of the dog, and the\r\nsame is true in regard to some other domesticated animals. But the big\r\nfact is the great variety of breeds that man has been able to fix, after\r\nhe once got started with a domesticated type. There are over 200\r\nwell-marked breeds of domestic pigeons, and there is very strong\r\nevidence that all are descended from the wild rock-dove, just as the\r\nnumerous kinds of poultry are descended from the jungle-fowl of some\r\nparts of India and the Malay Islands. Even more familiar is the way in\r\nwhich man has, so to speak, unpacked the complex fur of the wild rabbit,\r\nand established all the numerous colour-varieties which we see among\r\ndomestic rabbits. And apart from colour-varieties there are long-haired\r\nAngoras and quaint lop-eared forms, and many more besides. All this\r\npoints to evolution going on.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Romance of the Wheat\r\n\r\nIt is well-known that Neolithic man grew wheat, and some authorities\r\nhave put the date of the first wheat harvest at between fifteen thousand\r\nand ten thousand years ago. The ancient civilisations of Babylonia,\r\nEgypt, Crete, Greece, and Rome were largely based on wheat, and it is\r\nhighly probable that the first great wheatfields were in the fertile\r\nland between the Tigris and the Euphrates. The oldest Egyptian tombs\r\nthat contain wheat, which, by the way, never germinates after its\r\nmillennia of rest, belong to the First Dynasty, and are about six\r\nthousand years old. But there must have been a long history of wheat\r\nbefore that.\r\n\r\nNow it is a very interesting fact that the almost certain ancestor of\r\nthe cultivated wheat is at present living on the arid and rocky slopes\r\nof Mount Hermon. It is called _Triticum hermonis_, and it is varying\r\nnotably to-day, as it did long ago when it gave rise to the emmer, which\r\nwas cultivated in the Neolithic Age and is the ancestor of all our\r\nordinary wheats. We must think of Neolithic man noticing the big seeds\r\nof this Hermon grass, gathering some of the heads, breaking the brittle\r\nspikelet-bearing axis in his fingers, knocking off the rough awns or\r\nbruising the spikelets in his hand till the glumes or chaff separated\r\noff and could be blown away, chewing a mouthful of the seeds--and\r\nresolving to sow and sow again.\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of a long story, in the course of which man took\r\nadvantage of the numerous variations that cropped up in this sporting\r\nstock and established one successful race after another on his fields.\r\nVirgil refers in the \"Georgics\" to the gathering of the largest and\r\nfullest ears of wheat in order to get good seed for another sowing, but\r\nit was not till the first quarter of the nineteenth century that the\r\ngreat step was taken, by men like Patrick Sheriff of Haddington, of\r\ndeliberately selecting individual ears of great excellence and\r\nsegregating their progeny from mingling with mediocre stock. This is the\r\nmethod which has been followed with remarkable success in modern times.\r\n\r\nOne of the factors that assisted the Allies in overcoming the food\r\ncrisis in the darkest period of the war was the virtue of Marquis Wheat,\r\na very prolific, early ripening, hard red spring wheat with excellent\r\nmilling and baking qualities. It is now the dominant spring wheat in\r\nCanada and the United States, and it has enormously increased the real\r\nwealth of the world in the last ten years (1921). Now our point is\r\nsimply that this Marquis Wheat is a fine example of evolution going on.\r\nIn 1917 upwards of 250,000,000 bushels of this wheat were raised in\r\nNorth America, and in 1918 upwards of 300,000,000 bushels; yet the whole\r\noriginated from a single grain planted in an experimental plot at Ottawa\r\nby Dr. Charles E. Saunders so recently as the spring of 1903.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WALKING-FISH OR MUD-SKIPPER (PERIOPHTHALMUS), COMMON\r\nAT THE MOUTHS OF RIVERS IN TROPICAL AFRICA, ASIA, AND NORTH-WEST\r\nAUSTRALIA\r\n\r\nIt skips about by means of its strong pectoral fins on the mud-flats; it\r\njumps from stone to stone hunting small shore-animals; it climbs up the\r\nroots of the mangrove-trees.

The tail seems to help in respiration.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: \"The Times.\"_\r\n\r\nTHE AUSTRALIAN MORE-PORK OR PODARGUS\r\n\r\nA bird with a frog-like mouth, allied to the British Nightjar.

We wish, however, following\r\nProfessor Buller's _Essays on Wheat_ (1919), to explain the method by\r\nwhich this good seed was discovered. From one we may learn all. The\r\nparent of Marquis Wheat on the male side was the mid-Europe Red Fife--a\r\nfirst-class cereal. The parent on the female side was less promising, a\r\nrather nondescript, not pure-bred wheat, called Red Calcutta, which was\r\nimported from India into Canada about thirty years ago. The father was\r\npart of a cargo that came from the Baltic to Glasgow, and was happily\r\nincluded in a sample sent on to David Fife in Ontario about 1842. From\r\none kernel of this sample David Fife started his stock of Red Fife,\r\nwhich was crossed by Dr. Saunders with Hard Red Calcutta. The result of\r\nthe cross was a medley of types, nearly a hundred varieties altogether,\r\nand it was in scrutinising these that Dr. Saunders hit upon Marquis. He\r\nworked steadily through the material, studying head after head of what\r\nresulted from sowing, and selecting out those that gave most promise.\r\nEach of the heads selected was propagated; most of the results were\r\nrejected; the elect were sifted again and yet again, and finally Marquis\r\nWheat emerged, rich in constructive possibilities, probably the most\r\nvaluable food-plant in the world. It is like a romance to read that \"the\r\nfirst crop of the wheat that was destined within a dozen years to\r\novertax the mightiest elevators in the land was stored away in the\r\nwinter of 1904-5 in a paper packet no larger than an envelope.\"\r\n\r\nThus from the Wild Wheat of Mount Hermon there evolved one of the most\r\nimportant food-plants of the world. This surely is _Evolution going on_.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nChanges in the Animal Life of a Country\r\n\r\nNothing gives us a more convincing impression of evolution in being than\r\na succession of pictures of the animal life of a country in different\r\nages. Dr. James Ritchie, a naturalist of distinction, has written a\r\nmasterly book, _The Influence of Man on Animal Life in Scotland_ (1920),\r\nin which we get this succession of pictures. \"Within itself,\" he says,\r\n\"a fauna is in a constant state of uneasy restlessness, an assemblage of\r\ncreatures which in its parts ebbs and flows as one local influence or\r\nanother plays upon it.\" There are temporary and local changes, endless\r\ndisturbances and readjustments of the \"balance of nature.\" One year\r\nthere is a plague of field-voles, perhaps next year \"grouse disease\" is\r\nrife; in one place there is huge increase of starlings, in another place\r\nof rabbits; here cockchafers are in the ascendant, and there the moles\r\nare spoiling the pasture. \"But while the parts fluctuate, the fauna as a\r\nwhole follows a path of its own. As well as internal tides which swing\r\nto and fro about an average level, there is a drift which carries the\r\nfauna bodily along an 'irretraceable course.'\" This is partly due to\r\nconsiderable changes of climate, for climate calls the tune to which\r\nliving creatures dance, but it is also due to new departures among the\r\nanimals themselves. We need not go back to the extinct animals and lost\r\nfaunas of past ages--for Britain has plenty of relics of these--which\r\n\"illustrate the reality of the faunal drift,\" but it may be very useful,\r\nin illustration of evolution in being, to notice what has happened in\r\nScotland since the end of the Great Ice Age.\r\n\r\nSome nine thousand years ago or more, certain long-headed,\r\nsquare-jawed, short-limbed, but agile hunters and fishermen, whom we\r\ncall Neolithic Man, established themselves in Scotland. What was the\r\nstate of the country then?\r\n\r\n    It was a country of swamps, low forests of birch, alder, and willow,\r\n    fertile meadows, and snow-capped mountains. Its estuaries penetrated\r\n    further inland than they now do, and the sea stood at the level of\r\n    the Fifty-Foot Beach. On its plains and in its forests roamed many\r\n    creatures which are strange to the fauna of to-day--the Elk and the\r\n    Reindeer, Wild Cattle, the Wild Boar and perhaps Wild Horses, a\r\n    fauna of large animals which paid toll to the European Lynx, the\r\n    Brown Bear and the Wolf. In all likelihood, the marshes resounded to\r\n    the boom of the Bittern and the plains to the breeding calls of the\r\n    Crane and the Great Bustard.\r\n\r\nSuch is Dr. Ritchie's initial picture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIFE-HISTORY OF A FROG\r\n\r\n1, Before hatching; 2, newly hatched larvæ hanging on to water-weed; 3,\r\nwith external gills; 4, external gills are covered over and are\r\nabsorbed; 5, limbless larva about a month old with internal gills; 6,\r\ntadpole with hind-legs, about two months old; 7, with the fore-limbs\r\nemerging; 8, with all four legs free; 9, a young frog, about three\r\nmonths old, showing the almost complete absorption of the tail and the\r\nchange of the tadpole mouth into a frog mouth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: J.

The closing of the \"fan,\" like the\r\n\"feathering\" of an oar, reduces friction when the leg is being moved\r\nforwards for the next stroke.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BIG ROBBER-CRAB (_Birgus Latro_), THAT CLIMBS THE\r\nCOCO-NUT PALM AND BREAKS OFF THE NUTS\r\n\r\nIt occurs on islands in the Indian Ocean and Pacific, and is often found\r\nfar above sea-level. It is able to breathe dry air. One is seen emerging\r\nfrom its burrow, which is often lined with coco-nut fibre. The empty\r\ncoco-nut shell is sometimes used by the Robber-Crab for the protection\r\nof its tail.]\r\n\r\nNow what happened in this kingdom of Caledonia which Neolithic Man had\r\nfound? He began to introduce domesticated animals, and that meant a\r\nthinning of the ranks of predacious creatures. \"Safety first\" was the\r\ndangerous motto in obedience to which man exterminated the lynx, the\r\nbrown bear, and the wolf. Other creatures, such as the great auk, were\r\ndestroyed for food, and others like the marten for their furs. Small\r\npests were destroyed to protect the beginnings of agriculture; larger\r\nanimals like the boar were hunted out of existence; others, like the\r\npearl-bearing river-mussels, yielded to subtler demands. No doubt there\r\nwas protection also--protection for sport, for utility, for æsthetic\r\nreasons, and because of humane sentiments; even wholesome superstitions\r\nhave safeguarded the robin redbreast and the wren. There were\r\nintroductions too--the rabbit for utility, the pheasant for sport, and\r\nthe peacock for amenity. And every introduction, every protection, every\r\nkilling out had its far-reaching influences.\r\n\r\nBut if we are to picture the evolution going on, we must think also of\r\nman's indirect interference with animal life. He destroyed the forests,\r\nhe cultivated the wild, he made bridges, he allowed aliens, like rats\r\nand cockroaches, to get in unawares. Of course, he often did good, as\r\nwhen he drained swamps and got rid of the mosquitoes which once made\r\nmalaria rife in Scotland.\r\n\r\nWhat has been the net result? Not, as one might think for a moment, a\r\nreduction in the _number_ of different kinds of animals. Fourteen or so\r\nspecies of birds and beasts have been banished from Scotland since man\r\ninterfered, but as far as numbers go they have been more than replaced\r\nby deliberate introductions like fallow deer, rabbit, squirrel, and\r\npheasant, and by accidental introductions like rats and cockroaches. But\r\nthe change is rather in _quality_ than in quantity; the smaller have\r\ntaken the place of the larger, rather paltry pigmies of noble giants.\r\nThus we get a vivid idea that evolution, especially when man interferes,\r\nis not necessarily progressive. That depends on the nature of the sieves\r\nwith which the living materials are sifted. As Dr. Ritchie well says,\r\nthe standard of the wild fauna as regards size has fallen and is\r\nfalling, and it is not in size only that there is loss, there is a\r\ndeterioration of quality. \"For how can the increase of Rabbits and\r\nSparrows and Earthworms and Caterpillars, and the addition of millions\r\nof Rats and Cochroaches and Crickets and Bugs, ever take the place of\r\nthose fine creatures round the memories of which the glamour of\r\nScotland's past still plays--the Reindeer and the Elk, the Wolf, the\r\nBrown Bear, the Lynx, and the Beaver, the Bustard, the Crane, the\r\nBumbling Bittern, and many another, lost or disappearing.\" Thus we see\r\nagain that evolution is going on.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nThe Adventurers\r\n\r\nAll through the millions of years during which animals have tenanted the\r\nearth and the waters under the earth, there has been a search for new\r\nkingdoms to conquer, for new corners in which to make a home. And this\r\nstill goes on. _It has been and is one of the methods of evolution to\r\nfill every niche of opportunity._ There is a spider that lives inside a\r\npitcher-plant, catching some of the inquisitive insects which slip down\r\nthe treacherous internal surface of the trap. There is another that\r\nmakes its home in crevices among the rocks on the shore of the\r\nMediterranean, or even in empty tubular shells, keeping the water out,\r\nmore or less successfully, by spinning threads of silk across the\r\nentrance to its retreat. The beautiful brine-shrimp, _Artemia salina_,\r\nthat used to occur in British salterns has found a home in the dense\r\nwaters of the Great Salt Lake of Utah. Several kinds of earthworms have\r\nbeen found up trees, and there is a fish, Arges, that climbs on the\r\nstones of steep mountain torrents of the Andes. The intrepid explorers\r\nof the _Scotia_ voyage found quite a number of Arctic terns spending our\r\nwinter within the summer of the Antarctic Circle--which means girdling\r\nthe globe from pole to pole; and every now and then there are incursions\r\nof rare birds, like Pallas's Sand-grouse, into Britain, just as if they\r\nwere prospecting in search of a promised land. Twice or thrice the\r\ndistinctively North American Killdeer Plover has been found in Britain,\r\nhaving somehow or other got across the Atlantic. We miss part of the\r\nmeaning of evolution if we do not catch this note of insurgence and\r\nadventure, which some animal or other never ceases to sound, though many\r\nestablish themselves in a security not easily disturbed, and though a\r\nsmall minority give up the struggle against the stream and are content\r\nto acquiesce, as parasites or rottenness eaters, in a drifting life of\r\nease.\r\n\r\nMore important than very peculiar cases is the broad fact that over and\r\nover again in different groups of animals there have been attempts to\r\nmaster different kinds of haunts--such as the underground world, the\r\ntrees, the freshwaters, and the air. There are burrowing amphibians,\r\nburrowing reptiles, burrowing birds, and burrowing mammals; there are\r\ntree-toads, tree-snakes, tree-lizards, tree-kangaroos, tree-sloths,\r\ntree-shrews, tree-mice, tree-porcupines, and so on; enough of a list to\r\nshow, without mentioning birds, how many different kinds of animals\r\nhave entered upon an arboreal apprenticeship--an apprenticeship often\r\nwith far-reaching consequences. What the freeing of the hand from being\r\nan organ of terrestrial support has meant in the evolution of monkeys is\r\na question that gives a spur to our imagination.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Case of the Robber Crab\r\n\r\nOn some of the coral islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans there\r\nlives a land-crab, Birgus, which has learned to breathe on land. It\r\nbreathes dry air by means of curious blood-containing tufts in the upper\r\npart of its gill-cavity, and it has also rudimentary gills. It is often\r\nabout a foot long, and it has very heavy great claws, especially on the\r\nleft-hand side. With this great claw it hammers on the \"eye-hole\" of a\r\ncoconut, from which it has torn off the fibrous husk. It hammers until a\r\nhole is made by which it can get at the pulp. Part of the shell is\r\nsometimes used as a protection for the soft abdomen--for the\r\nrobber-crab, as it is called, is an offshoot from the hermit-crab stock.\r\nEvery year this quaint explorer, which may go far up the hills and climb\r\nthe coco-palms, has to go back to the sea to spawn. The young ones are\r\nhatched in the same state as in our common shore-crab. That is to say,\r\nthey are free-swimming larvæ which pass through an open-water period\r\nbefore they settle down on the shore, and eventually creep up on to dry\r\nland. Just as open-water turtles lay their eggs on sandy shores, going\r\nback to their old terrestrial haunt, so the robber-crab, which has\r\nalmost conquered the dry land, has to return to the seashore to breed.\r\nThere is a peculiar interest in the association of the robber-crab with\r\nthe coco-palm, for that tree is not a native of these coral islands, but\r\nhas been introduced, perhaps from Mexico, by the Polynesian mariners\r\nbefore the discovery of America by Columbus. So the learning to deal\r\nwith coconuts is a recent achievement, and we are face to face with a\r\nvery good example of evolution going on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EARLY LIFE-HISTORY OF THE SALMON\r\n\r\n1. The fertilised egg, shed in the gravelly bed of the river.\r\n\r\n2. The embryo within the egg, just before hatching.

The fry become parr,\r\nwhich go to the sea as smolts, and return as grilse.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the small figures to the right indicate the natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SALMON LEAPING AT THE FALL IS A MOST FASCINATING\r\nSPECTACLE\r\n\r\nAgain and again we see them jumping out of the seething foam beneath the\r\nfall, casting themselves into the curtain of the down-rushing water,\r\nonly to be carried back by it into the depths whence they have risen.\r\nOne here and another there makes its effort good, touches the upper lip\r\nof the cataract, gives a swift stroke of its tail, and rushes on towards\r\nthose upper reaches which are the immemorial spawning beds of its\r\nrace.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Story of the Salmon\r\n\r\nIn late autumn or in winter the salmon spawn in the rivers. The female\r\nmakes a shallow trough in the gravel by moving her tail from side to\r\nside, and therein lays many eggs. The male, who is in attendance,\r\nfertilises these with the milt, and then the female covers them deeply\r\nwith gravel. The process is repeated over and over again for a week or\r\nmore till all the eggs are shed. For three to four months the eggs\r\ndevelop, and eventually there emerge the larvæ or _alevins_, which lurk\r\namong the pebbles. They cannot swim much, for they are encumbered by a\r\nbig legacy of yolk. In a few weeks, perhaps eight, the protruding bag of\r\nyolk has disappeared and the _fry_, about an inch long, begin to move\r\nabout more actively and to fend for themselves. By the end of the year\r\nthey have grown to be rather trout-like _parr_, about four inches long.\r\nIn two years these are double that length. Usually in the second year,\r\nbut it may be earlier or later, the parr become silvery _smolts_, which\r\ngo out to sea, usually about the month of May. They feed on young\r\nherring and the like and grow large and strong. When they are about\r\nthree and a half years old they come up the rivers as _grilse_ and may\r\nspawn. Or they may pass through the whole grilse stage in the sea and\r\ncome up the rivers with all the characters of the full-grown fish. In\r\nmany cases the salmon spawn only once, and some (they are called _kelts_\r\nafter spawning) are so much exhausted by starting a new generation that\r\nthey die or fall a victim to otters and other enemies. In the case of\r\nthe salmon of the North Pacific (in the genus _Oncorhynchus_, not\r\n_Salmo_) all the individuals die after spawning, none being able to\r\nreturn to the sea. It must be remembered that full-grown salmon do not\r\nas a rule feed in fresh water, though they may be unable to resist\r\nsnapping at the angler's strange creations. A very interesting fact is\r\nthat the salmon keeps as it were a diary of its movements, which vary a\r\ngood deal in different rivers. This diary is written in the scales, and\r\na careful reading of the concentric lines on the scales shows the age of\r\nthe fish, and when it went out to sea, and whether it has spawned or\r\nnot, and more besides.\r\n\r\n\r\nInterpretation of the Salmon's Story\r\n\r\nWhen an animal frequents two different haunts, in one of which it\r\nbreeds, it is very often safe to say that the breeding-place represents\r\nthe original home. The flounder is quite comfortable far up the rivers,\r\nbut it has to go to the shore-waters to spawn, and there is no doubt\r\nthat the flounder is a marine fish which has recently learned to\r\ncolonise the fresh waters. Its relatives, like plaice and sole, are\r\nstrictly marine. But it is impossible to make a dogma of the rule that\r\nthe breeding-place corresponds to the original home. Thus some kinds of\r\nbass, which belong to the marine family of sea-perches, live in the sea\r\nor in estuaries, while two have become permanent residents in fresh\r\nwater. Or, again, the members of the herring family are very\r\ndistinctively marine, but the shad, which belong to this family, spawn\r\nin rivers and may spend their lives there.\r\n\r\nSo there are two different ways of interpreting the life-history of the\r\nsalmon. Some authorities regard the salmon as a marine fish which is\r\nestablishing itself in fresh water. But others read the story the other\r\nway and regard the salmon as a member of a freshwater race, that has\r\ntaken to the sea for feeding purposes. In regard to trout, we know that\r\nthe ranks of those in rivers and lakes are continually being reinforced\r\nby migrants from the sea, and that some trout go down to the sea while\r\nothers remain in the freshwater. We know also in regard to a related\r\nfish, the char, that while the great majority of kinds are now permanent\r\nresidents in cold and deep, isolated northern lakes, there are Arctic\r\nforms which live in the sea but enter the rivers to spawn. These facts\r\nfavour the view that the salmon was originally a marine fish. But there\r\nare arguments on both sides, and, for our present purpose, the important\r\nfact is that the salmon is conquering _two_ haunts. Its evolution is\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Romance of the Eel\r\n\r\nEarly in summer, at dates varying with the distance of the rivers from\r\nthe open Atlantic, crowds of young eels or elvers come up-stream.\r\nSometimes the procession or eel-fare includes thousands of individuals,\r\neach about the length of our first finger, and as thick as a stout\r\nknitting needle. They obey an inborn impulse to swim against the stream,\r\nseeking automatically to have both sides of their body equally\r\nstimulated by the current. So they go straight ahead. The obligation\r\nworks only during the day, for when the sun goes down behind the hills\r\nthe elvers snuggle under stones or beneath the bank and rest till dawn.\r\nIn the course of time they reach the quiet upper reaches of the river or\r\ngo up rivulets and drainpipes to the isolated ponds. Their impulse to go\r\non must be very imperious, for they may wriggle up the wet moss by the\r\nside of a waterfall or even make a short excursion in a damp meadow.\r\n\r\nIn the quiet-flowing stretches of the river or in the ponds they feed\r\nand grow for years and years. They account for a good many young fishes.\r\nEventually, after five or six years in the case of the males, six to\r\neight years in the case of the females, the well-grown fishes, perhaps a\r\nfoot and a half to two feet long, are seized by a novel restlessness.\r\nThey are beginning to be mature. They put on a silvery jacket and become\r\nlarge of eye, and they return to the sea. In getting away from the pond\r\nit may be necessary to wriggle through the damp meadow-grass before\r\nreaching the river. They travel by night and rather excitedly. The\r\nArctic Ocean is too cold for them and the North Sea too shallow. They\r\nmust go far out to sea, to where the old margin of the once larger\r\ncontinent of Europe slopes down to the great abysses, from the Hebrides\r\nsouthwards. Eels seem to spawn in the deep dark water; but the just\r\nliberated eggs have not yet been found. The young fry rises to near the\r\nsurface and becomes a knife-blade-like larva, transparent all but its\r\neye. It lives for many months in this state, growing to be about three\r\ninches long, rising and sinking in the water, and swimming gently.\r\nThese open-sea young eels are known as Leptocephali, a name given to\r\nthem before their real nature was proved. They gradually become shorter,\r\nand the shape changes from knife-blade-like to cylindrical. During this\r\nchange they fast, and the weight of their delicate body decreases. They\r\nturn into glass-eels, about 2-1/2 inches long, like a knitting-needle in\r\ngirth. They begin to move towards the distant shores and rivers, and\r\nthey may be a year and a half old before they reach their destination\r\nand go up-stream as elvers. Those that ascend the rivers of the Eastern\r\nBaltic must have journeyed three thousand miles. It is certain that no\r\neel ever matures or spawns in fresh water. It is practically certain\r\nthat all the young eels ascending the rivers of North Europe have come\r\nin from the Atlantic, some of them perhaps from the Azores or further\r\nout still. It is interesting to inquire how the young eels circumvent\r\nthe Falls of the Rhine and get into Lake Constance, or how their kindred\r\non the other side of the Atlantic overcome the obstacle of Niagara; but\r\nit is more important to lay emphasis on the variety of habitats which\r\nthis fish is trying--the deep waters, the open sea, the shore, the\r\nriver, the pond, and even, it may be, a little taste of solid earth. It\r\nseems highly probable that the common eel is a deep-water marine fish\r\nwhich has learned to colonise the freshwaters. It has been adventurous\r\nand it has succeeded. The only shadow on the story of achievement is\r\nthat there seems to be no return from the spawning. There is little\r\ndoubt that death is the nemesis of their reproduction. In any case, no\r\nadult eel ever comes back from the deep sea. We are minded of Goethe's\r\nhard saying: \"Death is Nature's expert advice to get plenty of life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4\r\n\r\nForming New Habits\r\n\r\nThere is a well-known mudfish of Australia, Neoceratodus by name, which\r\nhas turned its swim-bladder into a lung and comes to the surface to\r\nspout. It expels vitiated air with considerable force and takes fresh\r\ngulps. At the same time, like an ordinary fish, it has gills which allow\r\nthe usual interchange of gases between the blood and the water. Now this\r\nAustralian mudfish or double-breather (Dipnoan), which may be a long way\r\nover a yard in length, is a direct and little-changed descendant of an\r\nancient extinct fish, Ceratodus, which lived in Mesozoic times, as far\r\nback as the Jurassic, which probably means over five millions of years\r\nago. The Queensland mudfish is an antiquity, and there has not been much\r\nchange in its lineage for millions of years. We might take it as an\r\nillustration of the inertia of evolution. And yet, though its structure\r\nhas changed but little, the fish probably illustrates evolution in\r\nprocess, for it is a fish that is learning to breathe dry air. It cannot\r\nleave the water; but it can live comfortably in pools which are foul\r\nwith decomposing animal and vegetable matter. In partially dried-up and\r\nfoul waterholes, full of dead fishes of various kinds, Neoceratodus has\r\nbeen found vigorous and lively. Unless we take the view, which is\r\n_possible_, that the swim-bladder of fishes was originally a lung, the\r\nmud-fishes are learning to breathe dry air. They illustrate evolution\r\nagoing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF THE LIFE HISTORY OF THE COMMON EEL (_Anguilla\r\nVulgalis_)\r\n\r\n1.

It is flightless and entirely\r\ndependent on its short powerful legs to carry it out of danger.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Gambier Bolton._\r\n\r\nTHE KIWI, ANOTHER FLIGHTLESS BIRD, OF REMARKABLE APPEARANCE, HABITS, AND\r\nSTRUCTURE]\r\n\r\nThe herring-gull is by nature a fish-eater; but of recent years, in some\r\nparts of Britain, it has been becoming in the summer months more and\r\nmore of a vegetarian, scooping out the turnips, devouring potatoes,\r\nsettling on the sheaves in the harvest field and gorging itself with\r\ngrain. Similar experiments, usually less striking, are known in many\r\nbirds; but the most signal illustration is that of the kea or Nestor\r\nparrot of New Zealand, which has taken to lighting on the loins of the\r\nsheep, tearing away the fleece, cutting at the skin, and gouging out\r\nfat. Now the parrot belongs to a vegetarian or frugivorous stock, and\r\nthis change of diet in the relatively short time since sheep-ranches\r\nwere established in New Zealand is very striking. Here, since we know\r\nthe dates, we may speak of evolution going on under our eyes. It must be\r\nremembered that variations in habit may give an animal a new\r\nopportunity to test variations in structure which arise mysteriously\r\nfrom within, as expressions of germinal changefulness rather than as\r\nimprints from without. For of the transmissibility of the latter there\r\nis little secure evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments in Locomotion\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to think of the numerous types of locomotion\r\nwhich animals have discovered--pulling and punting, sculling and rowing,\r\nand of the changes that are rung on these four main methods. How\r\nstriking is the case of the frilled lizard (Chlamydosaurus) of\r\nAustralia, which at the present time is, as it were, experimenting in\r\nbipedal progression--always a rather eventful thing to do. It gets up on\r\nits hind-legs and runs totteringly for a few feet, just like a baby\r\nlearning to walk.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful is the adventure which has led our dipper or\r\nwater-ouzel--a bird allied to the wrens--to try walking and flying under\r\nwater! How admirable is the volplaning of numerous parachutists--\"flying\r\nfish,\" \"flying frog,\" \"flying dragon,\" \"flying phalanger,\" \"flying\r\nsquirrel,\" and more besides, which take great leaps through the air. For\r\nare these not the splendid failures that might have succeeded in\r\nstarting new modes of flight?\r\n\r\nMost daring of all, perhaps, are the aerial journeys undertaken by many\r\nsmall spiders. On a breezy morning, especially in the autumn, they mount\r\non gate-posts and palings and herbage, and, standing with their head to\r\nthe wind, pay out three or four long threads of silk. When the wind tugs\r\nat these threads, the spinners let go, and are borne, usually back\r\ndownwards, on the wings of the wind from one parish to another. It is\r\nsaid that if the wind falls they can unfurl more sail, or furl if it\r\nrises. In any case, these wingless creatures make aerial journeys. When\r\ntens of thousands of the used threads sink to earth, there is a \"shower\r\nof gossamer.\" On his _Beagle_ voyage Darwin observed that vast numbers\r\nof small gossamer spiders were borne on to the ship when it was sixty\r\nmiles distant from the land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AUSTRALIAN FRILLED LIZARD, WHICH IS AT PRESENT TRYING\r\nTO BECOME A BIPED\r\n\r\nWhen it gets up on its hind-legs and runs for a short distance it folds\r\nits big collar round its neck.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CARPET OF GOSSAMER\r\n\r\nThe silken threads used by thousands of gossamer spiders in their\r\nmigrations are here seen entangled in the grass, forming what is called\r\na shower of gossamer.

J. Ward, F.E.S._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Devices\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, we must admit, to fix dates, except in a few cases,\r\nrelatively recent; but there is a smack of modernity in some striking\r\ndevices which we can observe in operation to-day. Thus no one will\r\ndispute the statement that spiders are thoroughly terrestrial animals\r\nbreathing dry air, but we have the fact of the water-spider conquering\r\nthe under-water world. There are a few spiders about the seashore, and a\r\nfew that can survive douching with freshwater, but the particular case\r\nof the true water-spider, _Argyroneta natans_, stands by itself because\r\nthe creature, as regards the female at least, has _conquered_ the\r\nsub-aquatic environment. A flattish web is woven, somehow, underneath\r\nthe water, and pegged down by threads of silk. Along a special vertical\r\nline the mother spider ascends to the surface and descends again, having\r\nentangled air in the hairs of her body. She brushes off this air\r\nunderneath her web, which is thereby buoyed up into a sort of dome. She\r\ndoes this over and over again, never getting wet all the time, until the\r\ndomed web has become like a diving-bell, full of dry air. In this\r\neloquent anticipation of man's rational device, this creature--far from\r\nbeing endowed with reason--lays her eggs and looks after her young. The\r\ngeneral significance of the facts is that when competition is keen, a\r\nnew area of exploitation is a promised land. Thus spiders have spread\r\nover all the earth except the polar areas. But here is a spider with\r\nsome spirit of adventure, which has endeavoured, instead of trekking, to\r\nfind a new corner near at home. It has tackled a problem surely\r\ndifficult for a terrestrial animal, the problem of living in great part\r\nunder water, and it has solved it in a manner at once effective and\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe have given but a few representative illustrations of a great theme.\r\nWhen we consider the changefulness of living creatures, the\r\ntransformations of cultivated plants and domesticated animals, the\r\ngradual alterations in the fauna of a country, the search after new\r\nhaunts, the forming of new habits, and the discovery of many inventions,\r\nare we not convinced that Evolution is going on? And why should it\r\nstop?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE DAWN OF MIND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAWN OF MIND\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the story of evolution there is no chapter more interesting than the\r\nemergence of mind in the animal kingdom. But it is a difficult chapter\r\nto read, partly because \"mind\" cannot be seen or measured, only\r\n_inferred_ from the outward behaviour of the creature, and partly\r\nbecause it is almost impossible to avoid reading ourselves into the much\r\nsimpler animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nTwo Extremes to be Avoided\r\n\r\nThe one extreme is that of uncritical generosity which credits every\r\nanimal, like Brer Rabbit--who, by the way, was the hare--with human\r\nqualities. The other extreme is that of thinking of the animal as if it\r\nwere an automatic machine, in the working of which there is no place or\r\nuse for mind. Both these extremes are to be avoided.\r\n\r\nWhen Professor Whitman took the eggs of the Passenger Pigeon (which\r\nbecame extinct not long ago with startling rapidity) and placed them a\r\nfew inches to one side of the nest, the bird looked a little uneasy and\r\nput her beak under her body as if to feel for something that was not\r\nthere. But she did not try to retrieve her eggs, close at hand as they\r\nwere. In a short time she flew away altogether. This shows that the mind\r\nof the pigeon is in some respects very different from the mind of man.\r\nOn the other hand, when a certain clever dog, carrying a basket of eggs,\r\nwith the handle in his mouth, came to a stile which had to be\r\nnegotiated, he laid the basket on the ground, pushed it gently through a\r\nlow gap to the other side, and then took a running leap over. We dare\r\nnot talk of this dog as an automatic machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Caution in Regard to Instinct\r\n\r\nIn studying the behaviour of animals, which is the only way of getting\r\nat their mind, for it is only of our own mind that we have direct\r\nknowledge, it is essential to give prominence to the fact that there has\r\nbeen throughout the evolution of living creatures a strong tendency to\r\nenregister or engrain capacities of doing things effectively. Thus\r\ncertain abilities come to be inborn; they are parts of the inheritance,\r\nwhich will express themselves whenever the appropriate trigger is\r\npulled. The newly born child does not require to learn its breathing\r\nmovements, as it afterwards requires to learn its walking movements. The\r\nability to go through the breathing movements is inborn, engrained,\r\nenregistered.\r\n\r\nIn other words, there are hereditary pre-arrangements of nerve-cells and\r\nmuscle-cells which come into activity almost as easily as the beating of\r\nthe heart. In a minute or two the newborn pigling creeps close to its\r\nmother and sucks milk. It has not to learn how to do this any more than\r\nwe have to learn to cough or sneeze. Thus animals have many useful\r\nready-made, or almost ready-made, capacities of doing apparently clever\r\nthings. In simple cases of these inborn pre-arrangements we speak of\r\nreflex actions; in more complicated cases, of instinctive behaviour. Now\r\nthe caution is this, that while these inborn capacities usually work\r\nwell in natural conditions, they sometimes work badly when the ordinary\r\nroutine is disturbed. We see this when a pigeon continues sitting for\r\nmany days on an empty nest, or when it fails to retrieve its eggs only\r\ntwo inches away. But it would be a mistake to call the pigeon, because\r\nof this, an unutterably stupid bird. We have only to think of the\r\nachievements of homing pigeons to know that this cannot be true. We must\r\nnot judge animals in regard to those kinds of behaviour which have been\r\nhanded over to instinct, and go badly agee when the normal routine is\r\ndisturbed. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the enregistered\r\ninstinctive capacities work well, and the advantage of their becoming\r\nstereotyped was to leave the animal more free for adventures at a higher\r\nlevel. Being \"a slave of instinct\" may give the animal a security that\r\nenables it to discover some new home or new food or new joy. Somewhat in\r\nthe same way, a man of methodical habits, which he has himself\r\nestablished, may gain leisure to make some new departure of racial\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: O. J.

Many have no pouch and carry their numerous young ones on\r\ntheir back, the tail of the young twined round that of the mother. The\r\nopossums are agile, clever creatures, and famous for \"playing 'possum,\"\r\nlying inert just as if they were dead.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MALE OF THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK, MAKING A NEST OF\r\nWATER-WEED, GLUED TOGETHER BY VISCID THREADS SECRETED FROM THE KIDNEYS\r\nAT THE BREEDING SEASON]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FEMALE STICKLEBACK ENTERS THE NEST WHICH THE MALE HAS\r\nMADE, LAYS THE EGGS INSIDE, AND THEN DEPARTS\r\n\r\nIn many cases two or three females use the same nest, the stickleback\r\nbeing polygamous. Above the nest the male, who mounts guard, is seen\r\ndriving away an intruder.]\r\n\r\nWhen we draw back our finger from something very hot, or shut our eye to\r\navoid a blow from a rebounding branch, we do not will the action; and\r\nthis is more or less the case, probably, when a young mammal sucks its\r\nmother for the first time. Some Mound-birds of Celebes lay their eggs in\r\nwarm volcanic ash by the shore of the sea, others in a great mass of\r\nfermenting vegetation; it is inborn in the newly hatched bird to\r\nstruggle out as quickly as it can from such a strange nest, else it will\r\nsuffocate. If it stops struggling too soon, it perishes, for it seems\r\nthat the trigger of the instinct cannot be pulled twice. Similarly, when\r\nthe eggs of the turtle, that have been laid in the sand of the shore,\r\nhatch out, the young ones make _instinctively_ for the sea. Some of the\r\ncrocodiles bury their eggs two feet or so below the surface among sand\r\nand decaying vegetation--an awkward situation for a birthplace. When the\r\nyoung crocodile is ready to break out of the egg-shell, just as a chick\r\ndoes at the end of the three weeks of brooding, it utters\r\n_instinctively_ a piping cry. On hearing this, the watchful mother digs\r\naway the heavy blankets, otherwise the young crocodile would be buried\r\nalive at birth. Now there is no warrant for believing that the young\r\nMound-birds, young crocodiles, and young turtles have an intelligent\r\nappreciation of what they do when they are hatched. They act\r\ninstinctively, \"as to the manner born.\" But this is not to say that\r\ntheir activity is not backed by endeavour or even suffused with a\r\ncertain amount of awareness. Of course, it is necessarily difficult for\r\nman, who is so much a creature of intelligence, to get even an inkling\r\nof the mental side of instinctive behaviour.\r\n\r\nIn many of the higher reaches of animal instinct, as in courtship or\r\nnest-building, in hunting or preparing the food, it looks as if the\r\nstarting of the routine activity also \"rang up\" the higher centres of\r\nthe brain and put the intelligence on the _qui vive_, ready to interpose\r\nwhen needed. So the twofold caution is this: (1) We must not depreciate\r\nthe creature too much if, in unusual circumstances, it acts in an\r\nineffective way along lines of behaviour which are normally handed over\r\nto instinct; and (2) we must leave open the possibility that even\r\nroutine instinctive behaviour may be suffused with awareness and backed\r\nby endeavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nA Useful Law\r\n\r\nBut how are we to know when to credit the animal with intelligence and\r\nwhen with something less spontaneous? Above all, how are we to know when\r\nthe effective action, like opening the mouth the very instant it is\r\ntouched by food in the mother's beak, is just a physiological action\r\nlike coughing or sneezing, and when there is behind it--a mind at work?\r\nThe answer to this question is no doubt that given by Prof. Lloyd\r\nMorgan, who may be called the founder of comparative psychology, that we\r\nmust describe the piece of behaviour very carefully, just as it\r\noccurred, without reading anything into it, and that we must not ascribe\r\nit to a higher faculty if it can be satisfactorily accounted for in\r\nterms of a lower one. In following this principle we may be sometimes\r\nniggardly, for the behaviour may have a mental subtlety that we have\r\nmissed; but in nine cases out of ten our conclusions are likely to be\r\nsound. It is the critical, scientific way.\r\n\r\nBearing this law in mind, let us take a survey of the emergence of mind\r\namong backboned animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nSenses of Fishes\r\n\r\nFishes cannot shut their eyes, having no true lids; but the eyes\r\nthemselves are very well developed and the vision is acute, especially\r\nfor moving objects. Except in gristly fishes, the external opening to\r\nthe ear has been lost, so that sound-waves and coarser vibrations must\r\ninfluence the inner ear, which is well developed, through the\r\nsurrounding flesh and bones. It seems that the main use of the ear in\r\nfishes is in connection with balancing, not with hearing. In many cases,\r\nhowever, the sense of hearing has been demonstrated; thus fishes will\r\ncome to the side of a pond to be fed when a bell is rung or when a\r\nwhistle is blown by someone not visible from the water. The fact that\r\nmany fishes pay no attention at all to loud noises does not prove that\r\nthey are deaf, for an animal may hear a sound and yet remain quite\r\nindifferent or irresponsive. This merely means that the sound has no\r\nvital interest for the animal. Some fishes, such as bullhead and\r\ndogfish, have a true sense of smell, detecting by their nostrils very\r\ndilute substances permeating the water from a distance. Others, such as\r\nmembers of the cod family, perceive their food in part at least by the\r\nsense of taste, which is susceptible to substances near at hand and\r\npresent in considerable quantity. This sense of taste may be located on\r\nthe fins as well as about the mouth. At this low level the senses of\r\nsmell and taste do not seem to be very readily separated. The chief use\r\nof the sensitive line or lateral line seen on each side of a bony fish\r\nis to make the animal aware of slow vibrations and changes of pressure\r\nin the water. The skin responds to pressures, the ear to vibrations of\r\nhigh frequency; the lateral line is between the two in its function.\r\n\r\n\r\nInteresting Ways of Fishes\r\n\r\nThe brain of the ordinary bony fish is at a very low level. Thus the\r\ncerebral hemispheres, destined to become more and more the seat of\r\nintelligence, are poorly developed. In gristly fishes, like skates and\r\nsharks, the brain is much more promising. But although the state of the\r\nbrain does not lead one to expect very much from a bony fish like trout\r\nor eel, haddock or herring, illustrations are not wanting of what might\r\nbe called pretty pieces of behaviour. Let us select a few cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stickleback's Nest\r\n\r\nThe three-spined and two-spined sticklebacks live equally well in fresh\r\nor salt water; the larger fifteen-spined stickleback is entirely marine.\r\nIn all three species the male fish makes a nest, in fresh or brackish\r\nwater in the first two cases, in shore-pools in the third case. The\r\nlittle species use the leaves and stems of water-plants; the larger\r\nspecies use seaweed and zoophyte. The leaves or fronds are entangled\r\ntogether and fastened by glue-like threads, secreted, strange to say, by\r\nthe kidneys. It is just as if a temporary diseased condition had been\r\nregularised and turned to good purpose. Going through the nest several\r\ntimes, the male makes a little room in the middle. Partly by coercion\r\nand partly by coaxing he induces a female--first one and then\r\nanother--to pass through the nest with two doors, depositing eggs during\r\nher short sojourn. The females go their way, and the male mounts guard\r\nover the nest. He drives off intruding fishes much bigger than himself.\r\nWhen the young are hatched, the male has for a time much to do, keeping\r\nhis charges within bounds until they are able to move about with\r\nagility. It seems that sticklebacks are short-lived fishes, probably\r\nbreeding only once; and it is reasonable to suppose that their success\r\nas a race depends to some extent on the paternal care. Now if we could\r\nbelieve that the nesting behaviour had appeared suddenly in its present\r\nform, we should be inclined to credit the fish with considerable mental\r\nability. But we are less likely to be so generous if we reflect that the\r\nroutine has been in all likelihood the outcome of a long racial process\r\nof slight improvements and critical testings. The secretion of the glue\r\nprobably came about as a pathological variation; its utilisation was\r\nperhaps discovered by accident; the types that had wit enough to take\r\nadvantage of this were most successful; the routine became enregistered\r\nhereditarily. The stickleback is not so clever as it looks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Imperial War Museum._\r\n\r\nHOMING PIGEON\r\n\r\nA blue chequer hen, which during the War (in September of 1918) flew 22\r\nmiles in as many minutes, saving the crew of an aeroplane in\r\ndifficulties.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Imperial War Museum._\r\n\r\nCARRIER PIGEON\r\n\r\nCarrier pigeons were much used in the War to carry messages.

The penguins come back over hundreds of miles of\r\ntrackless waste to their birthplace, where they breed. When they reach\r\nthe Antarctic shore they walk with determination to a suitable site,\r\noften at the top of a steep cliff. Some species waddle 130 steps per\r\nminute, 6 inches per step, two-thirds of a mile per hour.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mind of a Minnow\r\n\r\nTo find solid ground on which to base an appreciation of the behaviour\r\nof fishes, it is necessary to experiment, and we may refer to Miss\r\nGertrude White's interesting work on American minnows and sticklebacks.\r\nAfter the fishes had become quite at home in their artificial\r\nsurroundings, their lessons began. Cloth packets, one of which contained\r\nmeat and the other cotton, were suspended at opposite ends of the\r\naquarium. The mud-minnows did not show that they perceived either\r\npacket, though they swam close by them; the sticklebacks were intrigued\r\nat once. Those that went towards the packet containing meat darted\r\nfuriously upon it and pulled at it with great excitement. Those that\r\nwent towards the cotton packet turned sharply away when they were within\r\nabout two inches off. They then perceived what those at the other end\r\nwere after and joined them--a common habit amongst fishes. Although the\r\nminnows were not interested in the tiny \"bags of mystery,\" they were\r\neven more alert than the sticklebacks in perceiving moving objects in or\r\non the water, and there is no doubt that both these shallow-water\r\nspecies discover their food largely by sense of sight.\r\n\r\nThe next set of lessons had to do with colour-associations. The fishes\r\nwere fed on minced snail, chopped earthworm, fragments of liver, and the\r\nlike, and the food was given to them from the end of forceps held above\r\nthe surface of the water, so that the fishes could not be influenced by\r\nsmell. They had to leap out of the water to take the food from the\r\nforceps. Discs of coloured cardboard were slipped over the end of the\r\nforceps, so that what the fishes saw was a morsel of food in the centre\r\nof a coloured disc. After a week or so of preliminary training, they\r\nwere so well accustomed to the coloured discs that the presentation of\r\none served as a signal for the fishes to dart to the surface and spring\r\nout of the water. When baits of paper were substituted for the food, the\r\nfishes continued to jump at the discs. When, however, a blue disc was\r\npersistently used for the paper bait and a red disc for the real food,\r\nor _vice versa_, some of the minnows learned to discriminate infallibly\r\nbetween shadow and substance, both when these were presented alternately\r\nand when they were presented simultaneously. This is not far from the\r\ndawn of mind.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few lessons, both minnows and sticklebacks learned to\r\nassociate particular colours with food, and other associations were also\r\nformed. A kind of larva that a minnow could make nothing of after\r\nrepeated trials was subsequently ignored. The approach of the\r\nexperimenter or anyone else soon began to serve as a food-signal. There\r\ncan be no doubt that in the ordinary life of fishes there is a process\r\nof forming useful associations and suppressing useless responses. Given\r\nan inborn repertory of profitable movements that require no training,\r\ngiven the power of forming associations such as those we have\r\nillustrated, and given a considerable degree of sensory alertness along\r\ncertain lines, fishes do not require much more. And in truth they have\r\nnot got it. Moving with great freedom in three dimensions in a medium\r\nthat supports them and is very uniform and constant, able in most cases\r\nto get plenty of food without fatiguing exertions and to dispense with\r\nit for considerable periods if it is scarce, multiplying usually in\r\ngreat abundance so that the huge infantile mortality hardly counts,\r\nrarely dying a natural death but usually coming with their strength\r\nunabated to a violent end, fishes hold their own in the struggle for\r\nexistence without much in the way of mental endowment. Their brain has\r\nmore to do with motion than with mentality, and they have remained at a\r\nlow psychical level.\r\n\r\nYet just as we should greatly misjudge our own race if we confined our\r\nattention to everyday routine, so in our total, as distinguished from\r\nour average, estimate of fishes, we must remember the salmon surmounting\r\nthe falls, the wary trout eluding the angler's skill, the common\r\nmud-skipper (Periophthalmus) of many tropical shores which climbs on the\r\nrocks and the roots of the mangrove-trees, or actively hunts small\r\nshore-animals. We must remember the adventurous life-history of the eel\r\nand the quaint ways in which some fishes, males especially, look after\r\ntheir family. The male sea-horse puts the eggs in his breast-pocket; the\r\nmale Kurtus carries them on the top of his head; the cock-paidle or\r\nlumpsucker guards them and aerates them in a corner of a shore-pool.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nThe Mind of Amphibians\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the age of the Old Red Sandstone or Devonian, a great\r\nstep in evolution was taken--the emergence of Amphibians. The earliest\r\nrepresentatives had fish-like characters even more marked than those\r\nwhich may be discerned in the tadpoles of our frogs and toads, and there\r\nis no doubt that amphibians sprang from a fish stock. But they made\r\ngreat strides, associated in part with their attempts to get out of the\r\nwater on to dry land. From fossil forms we cannot say much in regard to\r\nsoft parts; but if we consider the living representatives of the class,\r\nwe may credit amphibians with such important acquisitions as fingers and\r\ntoes, a three-chambered heart, true ventral lungs, a drum to the ear, a\r\nmobile tongue, and vocal cords. When animals began to be able to grasp\r\nan object and when they began to be able to utter sufficient sounds, two\r\nnew doors were opened. Apart from insects, whose instrumental music had\r\nprobably begun before the end of the Devonian age, amphibians were the\r\nfirst animals to have a voice. The primary meaning of this voice was\r\ndoubtless, as it is to-day in our frogs, a sex-call; but it was the\r\nbeginning of what was destined to play a very important part in the\r\nevolution of the mind. In the course of ages the significance of the\r\nvoice broadened out; it became a parental call; it became an infant's\r\ncry. Broadening still, it became a very useful means of recognition\r\namong kindred, especially in the dark and in the intricacies of the\r\nforest. Ages passed, and the voice rose on another turn of the\r\nevolutionary spiral to be expressive of particular emotions beyond the\r\nimmediate circle of sex--emotions of joy and of fear, of jealousy and of\r\ncontentment. Finally, we judge, the animal--perhaps the bird was\r\nfirst--began to give utterance to particular \"words,\" indicative not\r\nmerely of emotions, but of particular things with an emotional halo,\r\nsuch as \"food,\" \"enemy,\" \"home.\" Long afterwards, words became _in man_\r\nthe medium of reasoned discourse. Sentences were made and judgments\r\nexpressed. But was not the beginning in the croaking of Amphibia?\r\n\r\n\r\nSenses of Amphibians\r\n\r\nFrogs have good eyes, and the toad's eyes are \"jewels.\" There is\r\nevidence of precise vision in the neat way in which a frog catches a\r\nfly, flicking out its tongue, which is fixed in front and loose behind.\r\nThere is also experimental proof that a frog discriminates between red\r\nand blue, or between red and white, and an interesting point is that\r\nwhile our skin is sensitive to heat rays but not to light, the skin of\r\nthe frog answers back to light rays as well. Professor Yerkes\r\nexperimented with a frog which had to go through a simple labyrinth if\r\nit wished to reach a tank of water. At the first alternative between two\r\npaths, a red card was placed on the wrong side and a white one on the\r\nother. When the frog had learned to take the correct path, marked by the\r\nwhite card, Prof. Yerkes changed the cards. The confusion of the frog\r\nshowed how thoroughly it had learned its lesson.\r\n\r\nWe know very little in regard to sense of smell or taste in amphibians;\r\nbut the sense of hearing is well developed, more developed than might be\r\ninferred from the indifference that frogs show to almost all sounds\r\nexcept the croaking of their kindred and splashes in the water.\r\n\r\nThe toad looks almost sagacious when it is climbing up a bank, and some\r\nof the tree-frogs are very alert; but there is very little that we dare\r\nsay about the amphibian mind. We have mentioned that frogs may learn the\r\nsecret of a simple maze, and toads sometimes make for a particular\r\nspawning-pond from a considerable distance. But an examination of their\r\nbrains, occupying a relatively small part of the broad, flat skull,\r\nwarns us not to expect much intelligence. On the other hand, when we\r\ntake frogs along a line that is very vital to them, namely, the\r\ndiscrimination of palatable and unpalatable insects, we find, by\r\nexperiment, that they are quick to learn and that they remember their\r\nlessons for many days. Frogs sometimes deposit their eggs in very\r\nunsuitable pools of water; but perhaps that is not quite so stupid as it\r\nlooks. The egg-laying is a matter that has been, as it were, handed over\r\nto instinctive registration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: W. S.

The original hole, in which this woodpecker\r\ninserted nuts for the purposes of cracking the shell and extracting the\r\nkernel, is seen towards the top of the tree. But the taker of the\r\nphotograph tied on a hollowed-out cotton-reel as a receptacle for a nut,\r\nand it was promptly discovered and used by the bird.]\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments in Parental Care\r\n\r\nIt must be put to the credit of amphibians that they have made many\r\nexperiments in methods of parental care, as if they were feeling their\r\nway to new devices. A common frog lays her clumps of eggs in the cradle\r\nof the water, sometimes far over a thousand together; the toad winds two\r\nlong strings round and between water-weeds; and in both cases that is\r\nall. There is no parental care, and the prolific multiplication covers\r\nthe enormous infantile mortality. This is the spawning solution of the\r\nproblem of securing the continuance of the race. But there is another\r\nsolution, that of parental care associated with an economical reduction\r\nof the number of eggs. Thus the male of the Nurse-Frog (Alytes), not\r\nuncommon on the Continent, fixes a string of twenty to fifty eggs to the\r\nupper part of his hind-legs, and retires to his hole, only coming out at\r\nnight to get some food and to keep up the moisture about the eggs. In\r\nthree weeks, when the tadpoles are ready to come out, he plunges into\r\nthe pond and is freed from his living burden and his family cares. In\r\nthe case of the thoroughly aquatic Surinam Toad (Pipa), the male helps\r\nto press the eggs, perhaps a hundred in number, on to the back of the\r\nfemale, where each sinks into a pocket of skin with a little lid. By and\r\nby fully formed young toads jump out of the pockets.\r\n\r\nIn the South American tree-frogs called Nototrema there is a pouch on\r\nthe back of the female in which the eggs develop, and it is interesting\r\nto find that in some species what come out are ordinary tadpoles, while\r\nin other species the young emerge as miniatures of their parents.\r\nStrangest of all, perhaps, is the case of Darwin's Frog (Rhinoderma of\r\nChili), where the young, about ten to fifteen in number, develop in the\r\nmale's croaking-sacs, which become in consequence enormously distended.\r\nEventually the strange spectacle is seen of miniature frogs jumping out\r\nof their father's mouth. Needless to say we are not citing these methods\r\nof parental care as examples of intelligence; but perhaps they correct\r\nthe impression of amphibians as a rather humdrum race. Whatever be the\r\nmental aspect of the facts, there has certainly been some kind of\r\nexperimenting, and the increase of parental care, so marked in many\r\namphibians, with associated reduction of the number of offspring is a\r\nfinger-post on the path of progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4\r\n\r\nThe Reptilian Mind\r\n\r\nWe speak of the wisdom of the serpent; but it is not very easy to\r\njustify the phrase. Among all the multitude of reptiles--snakes,\r\nlizards, turtles, and crocodiles, a motley crowd--we cannot see much\r\nmore than occasional traces of intelligence. The inner life remains a\r\ntiny rill.\r\n\r\nNo doubt many reptiles are very effective; but it is an instinctive\r\nrather than an intelligent efficiency. The well-known \"soft-shell\"\r\ntortoise of the United States swims with powerful strokes and runs so\r\nquickly that it can hardly be overtaken. It hunts vigorously for\r\ncrayfish and insect larvæ in the rivers. It buries itself in the mud\r\nwhen cold weather comes. It may lie on a floating log ready to slip into\r\nthe water at a moment's notice; it may bask on a sunny bank or in the\r\nwarm shallows. Great wariness is shown in choosing times and places for\r\negg-laying. The mother tramps the earth down upon the buried eggs. All\r\nis effective. Similar statements might be made in regard to scores of\r\nother reptiles; but what we see is almost wholly of the nature of\r\ninstinctive routine, and we get little glimpse of more than efficiency\r\nand endeavour.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases there is proof of reptiles finding their way back to\r\ntheir homes from a considerable distance, and recognition of persons is\r\nindubitable. Gilbert White remarks of his tortoise: \"Whenever the good\r\nold lady came in sight who had waited on it for more than thirty years,\r\nit always hobbled with awkward alacrity towards its benefactress, while\r\nto strangers it was altogether inattentive.\" Of definite learning there\r\nare a few records. Thus Professor Yerkes studied a sluggish turtle of\r\nretiring disposition, taking advantage of its strong desire to efface\r\nitself. On the path of the darkened nest of damp grass he interposed a\r\nsimple maze in the form of a partitioned box. After wandering about\r\nconstantly for thirty-five minutes the turtle found its way through the\r\nmaze by chance. Two hours afterwards it reached the nest in fifteen\r\nminutes; and after another interval of two hours it only required five\r\nminutes. After the third trial, the routes became more direct, there was\r\nless aimless wandering. The time of the twentieth trial was forty-five\r\nseconds; that of the thirtieth, forty seconds. In the thirtieth case,\r\nthe path followed was quite direct, and so it was on the fiftieth trip,\r\nwhich only required thirty-five seconds. Of course, the whole thing did\r\nnot amount to very much; but there was a definite learning, _a learning\r\nfrom experience_, which has played an important part in the evolution of\r\nanimal behaviour.\r\n\r\nComparing reptiles with amphibians, we may recognise an increased\r\nmasterliness of behaviour and a hint of greater plasticity. The records\r\nof observers who have made pets of reptiles suggest that the life of\r\nfeeling or emotion is growing stronger, and so do stories, if they can\r\nbe accepted, which suggest the beginning of conjugal affection.\r\n\r\nThe error must be guarded against of interpreting in terms of\r\nintelligence what is merely the outcome of long-continued structure\r\nadaptation. When the limbless lizard called the Slow-worm is suddenly\r\nseized by the tail, it escapes by surrendering the appendage, which\r\nbreaks across a preformed weak plane. But this is a reflex action, not a\r\nreflective one. It is comparable to our sudden withdrawal of our finger\r\nfrom a very hot cinder. The Egg-eating African snake Dasypeltis gets the\r\negg of a bird into its gullet unbroken, and cuts the shell against\r\ndownward-projecting sharp points of the vertebræ. None of the precious\r\ncontents is lost and the broken \"empties\" are returned. It is admirable,\r\nindeed unsurpassable; but it is not intelligent.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5\r\n\r\nMind in Birds\r\n\r\nSight and hearing are highly developed in birds, and the senses, besides\r\npulling the triggers of inborn efficiencies, supply the raw materials\r\nfor intelligence. There is some truth, though not the whole truth, in\r\nthe old philosophical dictum, that there is nothing in the intellect\r\nwhich was not previously in the senses. Many people have admired the\r\ncertainty and alacrity with which gulls pick up a fragment of biscuit\r\nfrom the white wake of a steamer, and the incident is characteristic. In\r\ntheir power of rapidly altering the focus of the eye, birds are\r\nunsurpassed.\r\n\r\nTo the sense of sight in birds, the sense of hearing comes a good\r\nsecond. A twig breaks under our feet, and out sounds the danger-call of\r\nthe bird we were trying to watch. Many young birds, like partridges,\r\nrespond when two or three hours old to the anxious warning note of the\r\nparents, and squat motionless on the ground, though other sounds, such\r\nas the excited clucking of a foster-mother hen, leave them indifferent.\r\nThey do not know what they are doing when they squat; they are obeying\r\nthe living hand of the past which is within them. Their behaviour is\r\ninstinctive. But the present point is the discriminating quality of the\r\nsense of hearing; and that is corroborated by the singing of birds.\r\nIt is emotional art, expressing feelings in the medium of sound. On the\r\npart of the females, who are supposed to listen, it betokens a\r\ncultivated ear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEAVER\r\n\r\nThe beaver will gnaw through trees a foot in diameter; to save itself\r\nmore trouble than is necessary, it will stop when it has gnawed the\r\ntrunk till there is only a narrow core left, having the wit to know that\r\nthe autumn gales will do the rest.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: F. R. Hinkins & Son._\r\n\r\nTHE THRUSH AT ITS ANVIL\r\n\r\nThe song-thrush takes the snail's shell in its bill, and knocks it\r\nagainst a stone until it breaks, making the palatable flesh available.\r\n\r\nMany broken shells are often found around the anvil.]\r\n\r\nAs to the other senses, touch is not highly developed except about the\r\nbill, where it reaches a climax in birds like the wood-cock, which probe\r\nfor unseen earthworms in the soft soil. Taste seems to be poorly\r\ndeveloped, for most birds bolt their food, but there is sometimes an\r\nemphatic rejection of unpalatable things, like toads and caterpillars.\r\nOf smell in birds little is known, but it has been proved to be present\r\nin certain cases, e.g. in some nocturnal birds of prey. It seems certain\r\nthat it is by sight, not by smell, that the eagles gather to the\r\ncarcass; but perhaps there is more smell in birds than they are usually\r\ncredited with. One would like to experiment with the oil from the preen\r\ngland of birds to see whether the scent of this does not help in the\r\nrecognition of kin by kin at night or amid the darkness of the forest.\r\nThere may be other senses in birds, such as a sense of temperature and a\r\nsense of balance; but no success has attended the attempts made to\r\ndemonstrate a magnetic sense, which has been impatiently postulated by\r\nstudents of bird migration in order to \"explain\" how the birds find\r\ntheir way. The big fact is that in birds there are two widely open\r\ngateways of knowledge, the sense of sight and the sense of hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstinctive Aptitudes\r\n\r\nMany a young water-bird, such as a coot, swims right away when it is\r\ntumbled into water for the first time. So chicks peck without any\r\nlearning or teaching, very young ducklings catch small moths that flit\r\nby, and young plovers lie low when the danger-signal sounds. But birds\r\nseem strangely limited as regards many of these instinctive\r\ncapacities--limited when compared with the \"little-brained\" ants and\r\nbees, which have from the first such a rich repertory of ready-made\r\ncleverness. The limitation in birds is of great interest, for it means\r\nthat intelligence is coming to its own and is going to take up the\r\nreins at many corners of the daily round. Professor Lloyd Morgan\r\nobserved that his chickens incubated in the laboratory had no\r\ninstinctive awareness of the significance of their mother's cluck when\r\nshe was brought outside the door. Although thirsty and willing to drink\r\nfrom a moistened finger-tip, they did not instinctively recognize water,\r\neven when they walked through a saucerful. Only when they happened to\r\npeck their toes as they stood in the water did they appreciate water as\r\nthe stuff they wanted, and raise their bills up to the sky. Once or\r\ntwice they actually stuffed their crops with \"worms\" of red worsted!\r\n\r\nInstinctive aptitudes, then, the young birds have, but these are more\r\nlimited than in ants, bees, and wasps; and the reason is to be found in\r\nthe fact that the brain is now evolving on the tack of what Sir Ray\r\nLankester has called \"educability.\" Young birds _learn_ with prodigious\r\nrapidity; the emancipation of the mind from the tyranny of hereditary\r\nobligations has begun. Young birds make mistakes, like the red worsted\r\nmistake, but they do not make the same mistakes often. They are able to\r\nprofit by experience in a very rapid way. We do not mean that creatures\r\nof the little-brain type, like ants, bees, and wasps, are unable to\r\nprofit by experience or are without intelligence. There are no such\r\nhard-and-fast lines. We mean that in the ordinary life of insects the\r\nenregistered instinctive capacities are on the whole sufficient for the\r\noccasion, and that intelligent educability is very slightly developed.\r\nNor do we mean that birds are quite emancipated from the tyranny of\r\nengrained instinctive obligations, and can always \"ring up\" intelligence\r\nin a way that is impossible for the stereotyped bee. The sight of a\r\npigeon brooding on an empty nest, while her two eggs lie disregarded\r\nonly a couple of inches away, is enough to show that along certain lines\r\nbirds may find it impossible to get free from the trammels of instinct.\r\nThe peculiar interest of birds is that they have many instincts and yet\r\na notable power of learning intelligently.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntelligence co-operating with Instinct\r\n\r\nProfessor Lloyd Morgan was foster-parent to two moorhens which grew up\r\nin isolation from their kindred. They swam instinctively, but they would\r\nnot dive, neither in a large bath nor in a current. But it happened one\r\nday when one of these moorhens was swimming in a pool on a Yorkshire\r\nstream, that a puppy came barking down the bank and made an awkward\r\nfeint towards the young bird. In a moment the moorhen dived, disappeared\r\nfrom view, and soon partially reappeared, his head just peeping above\r\nthe water beneath the overhanging bank. This was the first time the bird\r\nhad dived, and the performance was absolutely true to type.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt as to the meaning of this observation. The\r\nmoorhen has an hereditary or instinctive capacity for swimming and\r\ndiving, but the latter is not so easily called into activity as the\r\nformer. The particular moorhen in question had enjoyed about two months\r\nof swimming experience, which probably counted for something, but in the\r\ncourse of that experience nothing had pulled the trigger of the diving\r\ncapacity. On an eventful day the young moorhen saw and heard the dog; it\r\nwas emotionally excited; it probably did to some extent intelligently\r\nappreciate a novel and meaningful situation. Intelligence cooperated\r\nwith instinct, and the bird dived appropriately.\r\n\r\nBirds have inborn predispositions to certain effective ways of pecking,\r\nscratching, swimming, diving, flying, crouching, lying low,\r\nnest-building, and so on; but they are marked off from the much more\r\npurely instinctive ants and bees by the extent to which individual\r\n\"nurture\" seems to mingle with the inherited \"nature.\" The two together\r\nresult in the fine product which we call the bird's behaviour. After\r\nLloyd Morgan's chicks had tried a few conspicuous and unpalatable\r\ncaterpillars, they had no use for any more. They learned in their early\r\ndays with prodigious rapidity, illustrating the deep difference between\r\nthe \"big-brain\" type, relatively poor in its endowment of instinctive\r\ncapacities, but eminently \"educable,\" and the \"little-brain\" type, say,\r\nof ants and bees, richly endowed with instinctive capacities, but very\r\nfar from being quick or glad to learn. We owe it to Sir Ray Lankester to\r\nhave made it clear that these two types of brain are, as it were, on\r\ndifferent tacks of evolution, and should not be directly pitted against\r\none another. The \"little-brain\" type makes for a climax in the ant,\r\nwhere instinctive behaviour reaches a high degree of perfection; the\r\n\"big-brain\" type reaches its climax in horse and dog, in elephant and\r\nmonkey. The particular interest that attaches to the behaviour of birds\r\nis in the combination of a good deal of instinct with a great deal of\r\nintelligent learning. This is well illustrated when birds make a nest\r\nout of new materials or in some quite novel situation. It is clearly\r\nseen when birds turn to some new kind of food, like the Kea parrot,\r\nwhich attacks the sheep in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nSome young woodpeckers are quite clever in opening fir cones to get at\r\nthe seeds, and this might be hastily referred to a well-defined\r\nhereditary capacity. But the facts are that the parents bring their\r\nyoung ones first the seeds themselves, then partly opened cones, and\r\nthen intact ones. There is an educative process, and so it is in scores\r\nof cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing their Wits\r\n\r\nWhen the Greek eagle lifts the Greek tortoise in its talons, and lets it\r\nfall from a height so that the strong carapace is broken and the flesh\r\nexposed, it is making intelligent use of an expedient. Whether it\r\ndiscovered the expedient by experimenting, as is possible, or by chance,\r\nas is more likely, it uses it intelligently. In the same way\r\nherring-gulls lift sea-urchins and clams in their bills, and let them\r\nfall on the rocks so that the shells are broken. In the same way rooks\r\ndeal with freshwater mussels.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thrush's Anvil\r\n\r\nA very instructive case is the behaviour of the song-thrush when it\r\ntakes a wood-snail in its beak and hammers it against a stone, its\r\nso-called anvil. To a young thrush, which she had brought up by hand,\r\nMiss Frances Pitt offered some wood-snails, but it took no interest in\r\nthem until one put out its head and began to move about. The bird then\r\npecked at the snail's horns, but was evidently puzzled when the creature\r\nretreated within the shelter of the shell. This happened over and over\r\nagain, the thrush's inquisitive interest increasing day by day. It\r\npecked at the shell and even picked it up by the lip, but no real\r\nprogress was made till the sixth day, when the thrush seized the snail\r\nand beat it on the ground as it would a big worm. On the same day it\r\npicked up a shell and knocked it repeatedly against a stone, trying\r\nfirst one snail and then another. After fifteen minutes' hard work, the\r\nthrush managed to break one, and after that it was all easy. A certain\r\npredisposition to beat things on the ground was doubtless present, but\r\nthe experiment showed that the use of an anvil could be arrived at by an\r\nuntutored bird. After prolonged trying it found out how to deal with a\r\ndifficult situation. It may be said that in more natural conditions this\r\nmight be picked up by imitation, but while this is quite possible, it is\r\nuseful to notice that experiments with animals lead us to doubt whether\r\nimitation counts for nearly so much as used to be believed.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6\r\n\r\nThe Mind of the Mammal\r\n\r\nWhen we watch a collie at a sheep-driving competition, or an elephant\r\nhelping the forester, or a horse shunting waggons at a railway siding,\r\nwe are apt to be too generous to the mammal mind. For in the cases we\r\nhave just mentioned, part of man's mind has, so to speak, got into the\r\nanimal's. On the other hand, when we study rabbits and guinea-pigs, we\r\nare apt to be too stingy, for these rodents are under the average of\r\nmammals, and those that live in domestication illustrate the stupefying\r\neffect of a too sheltered life. The same applies to domesticated sheep\r\ncontrasted with wild sheep, or even with their own lambs. If we are to\r\nform a sound judgment on the intelligence of mammals we must not attend\r\ntoo much to those that have profited by man's training, nor to those\r\nwhose mental life has been dulled by domestication.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstinctive Aptitudes\r\n\r\nWhat is to be said of the behaviour of beavers who gnaw the base of a\r\ntree with their chisel-edged teeth till only a narrow core is left--to\r\nsnap in the first gale, bringing the useful branches down to the ground?\r\nWhat is to be said of the harvest-mouse constructing its nest, or of the\r\nsquirrel making cache after cache of nuts? These and many similar pieces\r\nof behaviour are fundamentally instinctive, due to inborn\r\npredispositions of nerve-cells and muscle-cells. But in mammals they\r\nseem to be often attended by a certain amount of intelligent attention,\r\nsaving the creature from the tyranny of routine so marked in the ways of\r\nants and bees.\r\n\r\n\r\nSheer Dexterity\r\n\r\nBesides instinctive aptitudes, which are exhibited in almost equal\r\nperfection by all the members of the same species, there are acquired\r\ndexterities which depend on individual opportunities. They are also\r\nmarked by being outside and beyond ordinary routine--not that any\r\nrigorous boundary line can be drawn. We read that at Mathura on the\r\nJumna doles of food are provided by the piety of pilgrims for the sacred\r\nriver-tortoises, which are so crowded when there is food going that\r\ntheir smooth carapaces form a more or less continuous raft across the\r\nriver. On that unsteady slippery bridge the Langur monkeys\r\n(_Semnopithecus entellus_) venture out and in spite of vicious snaps\r\nsecure a share of the booty. This picture of the monkeys securing a\r\nfooting on the moving mass of turtle-backs is almost a diagram of sheer\r\ndexterity. It illustrates the spirit of adventure, the will to\r\nexperiment, which is, we believe, the main motive-force in new\r\ndepartures in behaviour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Lafayette_\r\n\r\nALSATIAN WOLF-DOG\r\n\r\nAn animal of acute senses and great intelligence. It was of great\r\nservice in the war.\r\n\r\n(The dog shown, Arno von Indetal, is a trained police dog and did\r\nservice abroad during the war.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: W. S.

The food consists chiefly of seals. The sexes wander separately. A\r\nhole is often dug as a winter retreat, but there is no hibernation. A\r\npolar bear in captivity has been seen making a current with its paw in\r\nthe water of its pool in order to secure floating buns without\r\ntrouble--an instance of sheer intelligence.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From the Smithsonian Report_, 1914\r\n\r\nAN ALLIGATOR \"YAWNING\" IN EXPECTATION OF FOOD\r\n\r\nNote the large number of sharp conical teeth fixed in sockets along the\r\njaws.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPower of Association\r\n\r\nA bull-terrier called Jasper, studied by Prof. J. B. Watson, showed\r\ngreat power of associating certain words with certain actions. From a\r\nposition invisible to the dog the owner would give certain commands,\r\nsuch as \"Go into the next room and bring me a paper lying on the floor.\"\r\nJasper did this at once, and a score of similar things.\r\n\r\nLord Avebury's dog Van was accustomed to go to a box containing a small\r\nnumber of printed cards and select the card TEA or OUT, as the occasion\r\nsuggested. It had established an association between certain black marks\r\non a white background and the gratification of certain desires. It is\r\nprobable that some of the extraordinary things horses and dogs have been\r\nknown to do in the way of stamping a certain number of times in supposed\r\nindication of an answer to an arithmetical question (in the case of\r\nhorses), or of the name of an object drawn (in the case of dogs), are\r\ndependent on clever associations established by the teacher between\r\nminute signs and a number of stampings. What is certain is that mammals\r\nhave in varying degrees a strong power of establishing associations.\r\nThere is often some delicacy in the association established. Everyone\r\nknows of cases where a dog, a cat, or a horse will remain quite\r\nuninterested, to all appearance, in its owner's movements until some\r\nlittle detail, such as taking a key from its peg, pulls the trigger. Now\r\nthe importance of this in the wild life of the fox or the hare, the\r\notter or the squirrel, is obviously that the young animals learn to\r\nassociate certain sounds in their environment with definite\r\npossibilities. They have to learn an alphabet of woodcraft, the letters\r\nof which are chiefly sounds and scents.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dancing Mouse as a Pupil\r\n\r\nThe dancing or waltzing mouse is a Japanese variety with many\r\npeculiarities, such as having only one of the three semicircular canals\r\nof the ear well developed. It has a strong tendency to waltz round and\r\nround in circles without sufficient cause and to trip sideways towards\r\nits dormitory instead of proceeding in the orthodox head-on fashion. But\r\nthis freak is a very educable creature, as Professor Yerkes has shown.\r\nIn a careful way he confronted his mouse-pupil with alternative pathways\r\nmarked by different degrees of illumination, or by different colours. If\r\nthe mouse chose compartment A, it found a clear passage direct to its\r\nnest; if it chose compartment B, it was punished by a mild electric\r\nshock and it had to take a roundabout road home. Needless to say, the A\r\ncompartment was sometimes to the right hand, sometimes to the left, else\r\nmere position would have been a guide. The experiments showed that the\r\ndancing mice learn to discriminate the right path from the wrong, and\r\nsimilar results have been got from other mammals, such as rats and\r\nsquirrels. There is no proof of learning by ideas, but there is proof of\r\nlearning by experience. And the same must be true in wild life.\r\n\r\nMany mammals, such as cats and rats, learn how to manipulate\r\npuzzle-boxes and how to get at the treasure at the heart of a Hampton\r\nCourt maze. Some of the puzzle-boxes, with a reward of food inside, are\r\nquite difficult, for the various bolts and bars have to be dealt with in\r\na particular order, and yet many mammals master the problem. What is\r\nplain is that they gradually eliminate useless movements, that they make\r\nfewer and fewer mistakes, that they eventually succeed, and that they\r\nregister the solution within themselves so that it remains with them for\r\na time. It looks a little like the behaviour of a man who learns a game\r\nof skill without thinking. It is a learning by experience, not by ideas\r\nor reflection. Thus it is very difficult to suppose that a rat or a cat\r\ncould form any idea or even picture of the Hampton Court maze--which\r\nthey nevertheless master.\r\n\r\n\r\nLearning Tricks\r\n\r\nGiven sufficient inducement many of the cleverer mammals will learn to\r\ndo very sensible things, and no one is wise enough to say that they\r\nnever understand what they are doing. Yet it is certain that trained\r\nanimals often exhibit pieces of behaviour which are not nearly so clever\r\nas they look. The elephant at the Belle Vue Gardens in Manchester used\r\nto collect pennies from benevolent visitors. When it got a penny in its\r\ntrunk it put it in the slot of an automatic machine which delivered up a\r\nbiscuit. When a visitor gave the elephant a halfpenny it used to throw\r\nit back with disgust. At first sight this seemed almost wise, and there\r\nwas no doubt some intelligent appreciation of the situation. But it was\r\nlargely a matter of habituation, the outcome of careful and prolonged\r\ntraining. The elephant was laboriously taught to put the penny in the\r\nslot and to discriminate between the useful pennies and the useless\r\nhalfpennies. It was not nearly so clever as it looked.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing their Wits\r\n\r\nIn the beautiful Zoological Park in Edinburgh the Polar Bear was wont to\r\nsit on a rocky peninsula of a water-filled quarry. The visitors threw in\r\nbuns, some of which floated on the surface. It was often easy for the\r\nPolar Bear to collect half a dozen by plunging into the pool. But it had\r\ndiscovered a more interesting way. At the edge of the peninsula it\r\nscooped the water gently with its huge paw and made a current which\r\nbrought the buns ashore. This was a simple piece of behaviour, but it\r\nhas the smack of intelligence--of putting two and two together in a\r\nnovel way. It suggests the power of making what is called a \"perceptual\r\ninference.\"\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a great flood in a meadow it was observed that a\r\nnumber of mares brought their foals to the top of a knoll, and stood\r\nround about them protecting them against the rising water. A dog has\r\nbeen known to show what was at any rate a plastic appreciation of a\r\nvarying situation in swimming across a tidal river. It changed its\r\nstarting-point, they say, according to the flow or ebb of the tide.\r\nArctic foxes and some other wild mammals show great cleverness in\r\ndealing with traps, and the manipulative intelligence of elephants is\r\nworthy of all our admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7\r\n\r\nWhy is there not more Intelligence?\r\n\r\nWhen we allow for dexterity and power of association, when we recognise\r\na certain amount of instinctive capacity and a capacity for profiting by\r\nexperience in an intelligent way, we must admit a certain degree of\r\ndisappointment when we take a survey of the behaviour of mammals,\r\nespecially of those with very fine brains, from which we should\r\nnaturally expect great things. Why is there not more frequent exhibition\r\nof intelligence in the stricter sense?\r\n\r\nThe answer is that most mammals have become in the course of time very\r\nwell adapted to the ordinary conditions of their life, and tend to leave\r\nwell alone. They have got their repertory of efficient answers to the\r\nordinary questions of everyday life, and why should they experiment? In\r\nthe course of the struggle for existence what has been established is\r\nefficiency in normal circumstances, and therefore even the higher\r\nanimals tend to be no cleverer than is necessary. So while many mammals\r\nare extraordinarily efficient, they tend to be a little dull. Their\r\nmental equipment is adequate for the everyday conditions of their life,\r\nbut it is not on sufficiently generous lines to admit of, let us say, an\r\ninterest in Nature or adventurous experiment. Mammals always tend to\r\n\"play for safety.\"\r\n\r\nWe hasten, however, to insert here some very interesting saving clauses.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperimentation in Play\r\n\r\nA glimpse of what mammals are capable of, were it necessary, may be\r\nobtained by watching those that are playful, such as lambs and kids,\r\nfoals and calves, young foxes and others. For these young creatures let\r\nthemselves go irresponsibly, they are still unstereotyped, they test\r\nwhat they and their fellows can do. The experimental character of much\r\nof animal play is very marked.\r\n\r\nIt is now recognised by biologists that play among animals is the young\r\nform of work, and that the playing period, often so conspicuous, is\r\nvitally important as an apprenticeship to the serious business of life\r\nand as an opportunity for learning the alphabet of Nature. But the\r\nplaying period is much more; it is one of the few opportunities animals\r\nhave of making experiments without too serious responsibilities. Play is\r\nNature's device for allowing elbow-room for new departures\r\n(behaviour-variations) which may form part of the raw materials of\r\nprogress. Play, we repeat, gives us a glimpse of the possibilities of\r\nthe mammal mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Glimpses of Intelligence\r\n\r\nA squirrel is just as clever as it needs to be and no more; and of some\r\nvanishing mammals, like the beaver, not even this can be said. Humdrum\r\nnon-plastic efficiency is apt to mean stagnation. Now we have just seen\r\nthat in the play of young mammals there is an indication of unexhausted\r\npossibilities, and we get the same impression when we think of three\r\nother facts. (_a_) In those mammals, like dog and horse, which have\r\nentered into active cooperative relations with man, we see that the mind\r\nof the mammal is capable of much more than the average would lead us to\r\nthink. When man's sheltering is too complete and the domesticated\r\ncreature is passive in his grip, the intelligence deteriorates. (_b_)\r\nWhen we study mammals, like the otter, which live a versatile life in a\r\nvery complex and difficult environment, we get an inspiriting picture of\r\nthe play of wits. (_c_) Thirdly, when we pass to monkeys, where the\r\nfore-limb has become a free hand, where the brain shows a relatively\r\ngreat improvement, where \"words\" are much used, we cannot fail to\r\nrecognise the emergence of something new--a restless inquisitiveness, a\r\ndesire to investigate the world, an unsatisfied tendency to experiment.\r\nWe are approaching the Dawn of Reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIND OF MONKEYS\r\n\r\n§ 8\r\n\r\nThere is a long gamut between the bushy-tailed, almost squirrel-like\r\nmarmosets and the big-brained chimpanzee. There is great variety of\r\nattainment at different levels in the Simian tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeen Senses\r\n\r\nTo begin at the beginning, it is certain that monkeys have a first-class\r\nsensory equipment, especially as regards sight, hearing, and touch. The\r\naxes of the two eyes are directed forwards as in man, and a large\r\nsection of the field of vision is common to both eyes. In other words,\r\nmonkeys have a more complete stereoscopic vision than the rest of the\r\nmammals enjoy. They look more and smell less. They can distinguish\r\ndifferent colours, apart from different degrees of brightness in the\r\ncoloured objects. They are quick to discriminate differences in the\r\nshapes of things, e.g. boxes similar in size but different in shape, for\r\nif the prize is always put in a box of the same shape they soon learn\r\n(by association) to select the profitable one. They learn to\r\ndiscriminate cards with short words or with signs printed on them,\r\ncoming down when the \"Yes\" card is shown, remaining on their perch when\r\nthe card says \"No.\" Bred to a forest life where alertness is a\r\nlife-or-death quality, they are quick to respond to a sudden movement or\r\nto pick out some new feature in their surroundings. And what is true of\r\nvision holds also for hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\nPower of Manipulation\r\n\r\nAnother quality which separates monkeys very markedly from ordinary\r\nmammals is their manipulative expertness, the co-ordination of hand\r\nand eye. This great gift follows from the fact that among monkeys the\r\nfore-leg has been emancipated. It has ceased to be indispensable as an\r\norgan of support; it has become a climbing, grasping, lifting, handling\r\norgan. The fore-limb has become a free hand, and everyone who knows\r\nmonkeys at all is aware of the zest with which they use their tool. They\r\nenjoy pulling things to pieces--a kind of dissection--or screwing the\r\nhandle off a brush and screwing it on again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: W. P.

ORANG-UTAN\r\n\r\n4. BABY CHIMPANZEES\r\n\r\n_Photos: James's Press Agency._\r\n\r\nIn his famous book on _The Expression of the Emotions in Man and\r\nAnimals_ (1872) Charles Darwin showed that many forms of facial\r\nexpression familiar in man have their counterparts in apes and other\r\nmammals. He also showed how important the movements of expression are as\r\nmeans of communication between mother and offspring, mate and mate, kith\r\nand kin.\r\n\r\nThe anthropoid apes show notable differences of temperament as the\r\nphotographs show. The chimpanzee is lively, cheerful, and educable. The\r\norang is also mild of temper, but often and naturally appears melancholy\r\nin captivity. This is not suggested, however, by our photograph of the\r\nadult. Both chimpanzee and orang are markedly contrasted with the fierce\r\nand gloomy gorilla.]\r\n\r\n\r\nActivity for Activity's Sake\r\n\r\nProfessor Thorndike hits the nail on the head when he lays stress on the\r\nintensity of activity in monkeys--activity both of body and mind. They\r\nare pent-up reservoirs of energy, which almost any influence will tap.\r\nWatch a cat or a dog, Professor Thorndike says; it does comparatively\r\nfew things and is content for long periods to do nothing. It will be\r\nsplendidly active in response to some stimulus such as food or a friend\r\nor a fight, but if nothing appeals to its special make-up, which is very\r\nutilitarian in its interests, it will do nothing. \"Watch a monkey and\r\nyou cannot enumerate the things he does, cannot discover the stimuli to\r\nwhich he reacts, cannot conceive the _raison d'etre_ of his pursuits.\r\nEverything appeals to him. He likes to be active for the sake of\r\nactivity.\"\r\n\r\nThis applies to mental activity as well, and the quality is one of\r\nextraordinary interest, for it shows the experimenting mood at a higher\r\nturn of the spiral than in any other creature, save man. It points\r\nforward to the scientific spirit. We cannot, indeed, believe in the\r\nsudden beginning of any quality, and we recall the experimenting of\r\nplaying mammals, such as kids and kittens, or of inquisitive adults like\r\nKipling's mongoose, Riki-Tiki-Tavi, which made it his business in life\r\nto find out about things. But in monkeys the habit of restless\r\nexperimenting rises to a higher pitch. They appear to be curious about\r\nthe world. The psychologist whom we have quoted tells of a monkey which\r\nhappened to hit a projecting wire so as to make it vibrate. He went on\r\nrepeating the performance hundreds of times during the next few days. Of\r\ncourse, he got nothing out of it, save fun, but it was grist to his\r\nmental mill. \"The fact of mental life is to monkeys it own reward.\" The\r\nmonkey's brain is \"tender all over, functioning throughout, set off in\r\naction by anything and everything.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSheer Quickness\r\n\r\nCorrelated with the quality of restless inquisitiveness and delight in\r\nactivity for its own sake there is the quality of quickness. We mean not\r\nmerely the locomotor agility that marks most monkeys, but quickness of\r\nperception and plan. It is the sort of quality that life among the\r\nbranches will engender, where it is so often a case of neck or nothing.\r\nIt is the quality which we describe as being on the spot, though the\r\nphrase has slipped from its original moorings. Speaking of his Bonnet\r\nMonkey, an Indian macaque, second cousin to the kind that lives on the\r\nRock of Gibraltar, Professor S. J. Holmes writes: \"For keenness of\r\nperception, rapidity of action, facility in forming good practical\r\njudgments about ways and means of escaping pursuit and of attaining\r\nvarious other ends, Lizzie had few rivals in the animal world.... Her\r\nperceptions and decisions were so much more rapid than my own that she\r\nwould frequently transfer her attention, decide upon a line of action,\r\nand carry it into effect before I was aware of what she was about. Until\r\nI came to guard against her nimble and unexpected manoeuvres, she\r\nsucceeded in getting possession of many apples and peanuts which I had\r\nnot intended to give her except upon the successful performance of some\r\ntask.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick to Learn\r\n\r\nQuite fundamental to any understanding of animal behaviour is the\r\ndistinction so clearly drawn by Sir Ray Lankester between the\r\n\"little-brain\" type, rich in inborn or instinctive capacities, but\r\nrelatively slow to learn, and the \"big-brain\" type, with a relatively\r\npoor endowment of specialised instincts, but with great educability. The\r\n\"little-brain\" type finds its climax in ants and bees; the \"big-brain\"\r\ntype in horses and dogs, elephants and monkeys. And of all animals\r\nmonkeys are the quickest to learn, if we use the word \"learn\" to mean\r\nthe formation of useful associations between this and that, between a\r\ngiven sense-presentation and a particular piece of behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Case of Sally\r\n\r\nSome of us remember Sally, the chimpanzee at the \"Zoo\" with which Dr.\r\nRomanes used to experiment. She was taught to give her teacher the\r\nnumber of straws he asked for, and she soon learned to do so up to five.\r\nIf she handed a number not asked for, her offer was refused; if she gave\r\nthe proper number, she got a piece of fruit. If she was asked for five\r\nstraws, she picked them up individually and placed them in her mouth,\r\nand when she had gathered five she presented them together in her hand.\r\nAttempts to teach her to give six to ten straws were not very\r\nsuccessful. For Sally \"above six\" meant \"many,\" and besides, her limits\r\nof patience were probably less than her range of computation. This was\r\nhinted at by the highly interesting circumstance that when dealing with\r\nnumbers above five she very frequently doubled over a straw so as to\r\nmake it present two ends and thus appear as two straws. The doubling of\r\nthe straw looked like an intelligent device to save time, and it was\r\npersistently resorted to in spite of the fact that her teacher always\r\nrefused to accept a doubled straw as equivalent to two straws. Here we\r\nget a glimpse of something beyond the mere association of a\r\nsound--\"Five\"--and that number of straws.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Case of Lizzie\r\n\r\nThe front of the cage in which Professor Holmes kept Lizzie was made of\r\nvertical bars which allowed her to reach out with her arm. On a board\r\nwith an upright nail as handle, there was placed an apple--out of\r\nLizzie's reach. She reached immediately for the nail, pulled the board\r\nin and got the apple. \"There was no employment of the method of trial\r\nand error; there was direct appropriate action following the perception\r\nof her relation to board, nail, and apple.\" Of course her ancestors may\r\nhave been adepts at drawing a fruit-laden branch within their reach, but\r\nthe simple experiment was very instructive. All the more instructive\r\nbecause in many other cases the experiments indicate a gradual sifting\r\nout of useless movements and an eventful retention of the one that pays.\r\nWhen Lizzie was given a vaseline bottle containing a peanut and closed\r\nwith a cork, she at once pulled the cork out with her teeth, obeying the\r\ninstinct to bite at new objects, but she never learned to turn the\r\nbottle upside down and let the nut drop out. She often got the nut, and\r\nafter some education she got it more quickly than she did at first, but\r\nthere was no indication that she ever perceived the fit and proper way\r\nof getting what she wanted. \"In the course of her intent efforts her\r\nmind seemed so absorbed with the object of desire that it was never\r\nfocussed on the means of attaining that object. There was no\r\ndeliberation, and no discrimination between the important and the\r\nunimportant elements in her behaviour. The gradually increasing facility\r\nof her performances depended on the apparently unconscious elimination\r\nof useless movements.\" This may be called learning, but it is learning\r\nat a very low level; it is far from learning by ideas; it is hardly even\r\nlearning by experiment; it is not more than learning by experience, it\r\nis not more than fumbling at learning!\r\n\r\n\r\nTrial and Error\r\n\r\nA higher note is struck in the behaviour of some more highly endowed\r\nmonkeys. In many experiments, chiefly in the way of getting into boxes\r\ndifficult to open, there is evidence (1) of attentive persistent\r\nexperiment (2) of the rapid elimination of ineffective movements, and\r\n(3) of remembering the solution when it was discovered. Kinnaman taught\r\ntwo macaques the Hampton Court Maze, a feat which probably means a\r\nmemory of movements, and we get an interesting glimpse in his\r\nobservation that they began to smack their lips audibly when they\r\nreached the latter part of their course, and began to feel, dare one\r\nsay, \"We are right this time.\"\r\n\r\nIn getting into \"puzzle-boxes\" and into \"combination-boxes\" (where the\r\nbarriers must be overcome in a definite order), monkeys learn by the\r\ntrial and error method much more quickly than cats and dogs do, and a\r\nvery suggestive fact emphasized by Professor Thorndike is \"a process of\r\nsudden acquisition by a rapid, often apparently instantaneous\r\nabandonment of the unsuccessful movements and selection of the\r\nappropriate one, which rivals in suddenness the selections made by human\r\nbeings in similar performances.\" A higher note still was sounded by one\r\nof Thorndike's monkeys which opened a puzzle-box at once, eight months\r\nafter his previous experience with it. For here was some sort of\r\nregistration of a solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nImitation\r\n\r\nTwo chimpanzees in the Dublin Zoo were often to be seen washing the two\r\nshelves of their cupboard and \"wringing\" the wet cloth in the approved\r\nfashion. It was like a caricature of a washerwoman, and someone said,\r\n\"What mimics they are!\" Now we do not know whether that was or was not\r\nthe case with the chimpanzees, but the majority of the experiments that\r\nhave been made do not lead us to attach to imitation so much importance\r\nas is usually given to it by the popular interpreter. There are\r\ninstances where a monkey that had given up a puzzle in despair returned\r\nto it when it had seen its neighbour succeed, but most of the\r\nexperiments suggested that the creature has to find out for itself. Even\r\nwith such a simple problem as drawing food near with a stick, it often\r\nseems of little use to show the monkey how it is done. Placing a bit of\r\nfood outside his monkey's cage, Professor Holmes \"poked it about with\r\nthe stick so as to give her a suggestion of how the stick might be\r\nemployed to move the food within reach, but although the act was\r\nrepeated many times Lizzie never showed the least inclination to use the\r\nstick to her advantage.\" Perhaps the idea of a \"tool\" is beyond the\r\nBonnet Monkey, yet here again we must be cautious, for Professor L. T.\r\nHobhouse had a monkey of the same macaque genus which learned in the\r\ncourse of time to use a crooked stick with great effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Case of Peter\r\n\r\nPerhaps the cleverest monkey as yet studied was a performing chimpanzee\r\ncalled Peter, which has been generally described by Dr. Lightner Witmer.\r\nPeter could skate and cycle, thread needles and untie knots, smoke a\r\ncigarette and string beads, screw in nails and unlock locks. But what\r\nPeter was thinking about all the time it was hard to guess, and there is\r\nvery little evidence to suggest that his rapid power of putting two and\r\ntwo together ever rose above a sort of concrete mental experimenting,\r\nwhich Dr. Romanes used to call perceptual inference. Without supposing\r\nthat there are hard-and-fast boundary lines, we cannot avoid the general\r\nconclusion that, while monkeys are often intelligent, they seldom, if\r\never, show even hints of reason, i.e. of working or playing with general\r\nideas. That remains Man's prerogative.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bustle of the Mind\r\n\r\nIn mammals like otters, foxes, stoats, hares, and elephants, what a\r\ncomplex of tides and currents there must be in the brain-mind! We may\r\nthink of a stream with currents at different levels. Lowest there are\r\nthe _basal appetites_ of hunger and sex, often with eddies rising to the\r\nsurface. Then there are the _primary emotions_, such as fear of\r\nhereditary enemies and maternal affection for offspring. Above these are\r\n_instinctive aptitudes_, inborn powers of doing clever things without\r\nhaving to learn how. But in mammals these are often expressed along\r\nwith, or as it were through, the controlled life of _intelligent\r\nactivity_, where there is more clear-cut perceptual influence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: W.

Reid._\r\n\r\nCOMMON OTTER\r\n\r\nOne of the most resourceful of animals and the \"most playsomest crittur\r\non God's earth.\" It neither stores nor hibernates, but survives in\r\nvirtue of its wits and because of the careful education of the young.\r\nThe otter is a roving animal, often with more than one resting-place; it\r\nhas been known to travel fifteen miles in a night.]\r\n\r\nHigher still are the records or memories of individual experience and\r\nthe registration of individual habits, while on the surface is the\r\ninstreaming multitude of messages from the outside world, like raindrops\r\nand hailstones on the stream, some of them penetrating deeply, being, as\r\nwe say, full of meaning. The mind of the higher animal is in some\r\nrespects like a child's mind, in having little in the way of clear-cut\r\nideas, in showing no reason in the strict sense, and in its\r\nextraordinary educability, but it differs from the child's mind entirely\r\nin the sure effectiveness of a certain repertory of responses. It is\r\nefficient to a degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Until at last arose the Man.\"\r\n\r\nMan's brain is more complicated than that of the higher apes--gorilla,\r\norang, and chimpanzee--and it is relatively larger. But the improvements\r\nin structure do not seem in themselves sufficient to account for man's\r\ngreat advance in intelligence. The rill of inner life has become a swift\r\nstream, sometimes a rushing torrent. Besides perceptual inference or\r\n_Intelligence_--a sort of picture-logic, which some animals likewise\r\nhave--there is conceptual inference--or _Reason_--an internal\r\nexperimenting with general ideas. Even the cleverest animals, it would\r\nseem, do not get much beyond playing with \"particulars\"; man plays an\r\ninternal game of chess with \"universals.\" Intelligent behaviour may go a\r\nlong way with mental images; rational conduct demands general ideas. It\r\nmay be, however, that \"percepts\" and \"concepts\" differ rather in degree\r\nthan in kind, and that the passage from one to the other meant a higher\r\npower of forming associations. A clever dog has probably a generalised\r\npercept of man, as distinguished from a memory-image of the particular\r\nmen it has known, but man alone has the concept Man, or Mankind, or\r\nHumanity. Experimenting with concepts or general ideas is what we call\r\nReason.\r\n\r\nHere, of course, we get into deep waters, and perhaps it is wisest not\r\nto attempt too much. So we shall content ourselves here with pointing\r\nout that Man's advance in intelligence and from intelligence to reason\r\nis closely wrapped up with his power of speech. What animals began--a\r\nsmall vocabulary--he has carried to high perfection. But what is\r\ndistinctive is not the vocabulary so much as the habit of making\r\nsentences, of expressing judgments in a way which admitted of\r\ncommunication between mind and mind. The multiplication of words meant\r\nmuch, the use of words as symbols of general ideas meant even more, for\r\nit meant the possibility of playing the internal game of thinking; but\r\nperhaps the most important advance of all was the means of comparing\r\nnotes with neighbours, of corroborating individual experience by social\r\nintercourse. With words, also, it became easier to enregister outside\r\nhimself the gains of the past. It is not without significance that the\r\nGreek Logos, which may be translated \"the word,\" may also be translated\r\nMind.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9\r\n\r\nLooking Backwards\r\n\r\nWhen we take a survey of animal behaviour we see a long inclined plane.\r\nThe outer world provokes simple creatures to answer back; simple\r\ncreatures act experimentally on their surroundings. From the beginning\r\nthis twofold process has been going on, receiving stimuli from the\r\nenvironment and acting upon the environment, and according to the\r\nefficiency of the reactions and actions living creatures have been\r\nsifted for millions of years. One main line of advance has been opening\r\nnew gateways of knowledge--the senses, which are far more than five in\r\nnumber. The other main line of advance has been in most general terms,\r\nexperimenting or testing, probing and proving, trying one key after\r\nanother till a door is unlocked. There is progress in multiplying the\r\ngateways of knowledge and making them more discriminating, and there is\r\nprogress in making the modes of experimenting more wide-awake, more\r\ncontrolled, and more resolute. But behind both of these is the\r\ncharacteristically vital power of enregistering within the organism the\r\nlessons of the past. In the life of the individual these enregistrations\r\nare illustrated by memories and habituations and habits; in the life of\r\nthe race they are illustrated by reflex actions and instinctive\r\ncapacities.\r\n\r\n\r\nBody and Mind\r\n\r\nWe must not shirk the very difficult question of the relation between\r\nthe bodily and the mental side of behaviour.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Some great thinkers have taught that the mind is a reality by\r\nitself which plays upon the instrument of the brain and body. As the\r\ninstrument gets worn and dusty the playing is not so good as it once\r\nwas, but the player is still himself. This theory of the essential\r\nindependence of the mind is a very beautiful one, but those who like it\r\nwhen applied to themselves are not always so fond of it when it is\r\napplied to other intelligent creatures like rooks and elephants. It may\r\nbe, however, that there is a gradual emancipation of the mind which has\r\ngone furthest in Man and is still progressing.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Some other thinkers have taught that the inner life of thought and\r\nfeeling is only, as it were, an echo of the really important\r\nactivity--that of the body and brain. Ideas are just foam-bells on the\r\nhurrying streams and circling eddies of matter and energy that make up\r\nour physiological life. To most of us this theory is impossible, because\r\nwe are quite sure that ideas and feelings and purposes, which cannot be\r\ntranslated into matter and motion, are the clearest realities in our\r\nexperience, and that they count for good and ill all through our life.\r\nThey are more than the tickings of the clock; they make the wheels go\r\nround.\r\n\r\n(_c_) There are others who think that the most scientific position is\r\nsimply to recognise both the bodily and the mental activities as equally\r\nimportant, and so closely interwoven that they cannot be separated.\r\nPerhaps they are just the outer and the inner aspects of one\r\nreality--the life of the creature. Perhaps they are like the concave and\r\nconvex curves of a dome, like the two sides of a shield. Perhaps the\r\nlife of the organism is always a unity, at one time appearing more\r\nconspicuously as Mind-body, at another time as Body-mind. The most\r\nimportant fact is that neither aspect can be left out. By no jugglery\r\nwith words can we get Mind out of Matter and Motion. And since we are in\r\nourselves quite sure of our Mind, we are probably safe in saying that in\r\nthe beginning was Mind. This is in accordance with Aristotle's saying\r\nthat there is nothing in the end which was not also in kind present in\r\nthe beginning--whatever we mean by beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion\r\n\r\nWhat has led to the truly wonderful result which we admire in a creature\r\nlike a dog or an otter, a horse or a hare? In general, we may say, just\r\ntwo main processes--(1) testing all things, and (2) holding fast that\r\nwhich is good. New departures occur and these are tested for what they\r\nare worth. Idiosyncrasies crop up and they are sifted. New cards come\r\nmysteriously from within into the creature's hand, and they are\r\nplayed--for better or for worse. So by new variations and their sifting,\r\nby experimenting and enregistering the results, the mind has gradually\r\nevolved and will continue to evolve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nFOUNDATIONS OF THE UNIVERSE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD OF ATOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people have heard of the oriental race which puzzled over the\r\nfoundations of the universe, and decided that it must be supported on\r\nthe back of a giant elephant. But the elephant? They put it on the back\r\nof a monstrous tortoise, and there they let the matter end. If every\r\nanimal in nature had been called upon, they would have been no nearer a\r\nfoundation. Most ancient peoples, indeed, made no effort to find a\r\nfoundation. The universe was a very compact little structure, mainly\r\ncomposed of the earth and the great canopy over the earth which they\r\ncalled the sky. They left it, as a whole, floating in nothing. And in\r\nthis the ancients were wiser than they knew. Things do not fall down\r\nunless they are pulled down by that mysterious force which we call\r\ngravitation. The earth, it is true, is pulled by the sun, and would fall\r\ninto it; but the earth escapes this fiery fate by circulating at great\r\nspeed round the sun. The stars pull each other; but it has already been\r\nexplained that they meet this by travelling rapidly in gigantic orbits.\r\nYet we do, in a new sense of the word, need foundations of the universe.\r\nOur mind craves for some explanation of the matter out of which the\r\nuniverse is made. For this explanation we turn to modern Physics and\r\nChemistry. Both these sciences study, under different aspects, matter\r\nand energy; and between them they have put together a conception of the\r\nfundamental nature of things which marks an epoch in the history of\r\nhuman thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1\r\n\r\nThe Bricks of the Cosmos\r\n\r\nMore than two thousand years ago the first men of science, the Greeks of\r\nthe cities of Asia Minor, speculated on the nature of matter. You can\r\ngrind a piece of stone into dust. You can divide a spoonful of water\r\ninto as many drops as you like. Apparently you can go on dividing as\r\nlong as you have got apparatus fine enough for the work. But there must\r\nbe a limit, these Greeks said, and so they supposed that all matter was\r\nultimately composed of minute particles which were indivisible. That is\r\nthe meaning of the Greek word \"atom.\"\r\n\r\nLike so many other ideas of these brilliant early Greek thinkers, the\r\natom was a sound conception. We know to-day that matter is composed of\r\natoms. But science was then so young that the way in which the Greeks\r\napplied the idea was not very profound. A liquid or a gas, they said,\r\nconsisted of round, smooth atoms, which would not cling together. Then\r\nthere were atoms with rough surfaces, \"hooky\" surfaces, and these stuck\r\ntogether and formed solids. The atoms of iron or marble, for instance,\r\nwere so very hooky that, once they got together, a strong man could not\r\ntear them apart. The Greeks thought that the explanation of the universe\r\nwas that an infinite number of these atoms had been moving and mixing in\r\nan infinite space during an infinite time, and had at last hit by chance\r\non the particular combination which is our universe.\r\n\r\nThis was too simple and superficial. The idea of atoms was cast aside,\r\nonly to be advanced again in various ways. It was the famous Manchester\r\nchemist, John Dalton, who restored it in the early years of the\r\nnineteenth century. He first definitely formulated the atomic theory as\r\na scientific hypothesis. The whole physical and chemical science of that\r\ncentury was now based upon the atom, and it is quite a mistake to\r\nsuppose that recent discoveries have discredited \"atomism.\" An atom is\r\nthe smallest particle of a chemical element. No one has ever seen an\r\natom. Even the wonderful new microscope which has just been invented\r\ncannot possibly show us particles of matter which are a million times\r\nsmaller than the breadth of a hair; for that is the size of atoms. We\r\ncan weigh them and measure them, though they are invisible, and we know\r\nthat all matter is composed of them. It is a new discovery that atoms\r\nare not indivisible. They consist themselves of still smaller particles,\r\nas we shall see. But the atoms exist all the same, and we may still say\r\nthat they are the bricks of which the material universe is built.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Elliott & Fry._\r\n\r\nSIR ERNEST RUTHERFORD\r\n\r\nOne of our most eminent physicists who has succeeded Sir J. J. Thomson\r\nas Cavendish Professor of Physics at the University of Cambridge.

Mills._\r\n\r\nSIR WILLIAM CROOKES\r\n\r\nSir William Crookes experimented on the electric discharge in vacuum\r\ntubes and described the phenomena as a \"fourth state of matter.\" He was\r\nactually observing the flight of electrons, but he did not fully\r\nappreciate the nature of his experiments.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Photo Press_\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR SIR W. H. BRAGG\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinguished physicists of the present day.]\r\n\r\nBut if we had some magical glass by means of which we could see into the\r\nstructure of material things, we should not see the atoms put evenly\r\ntogether as bricks are in a wall. As a rule, two or more atoms first\r\ncome together to form a larger particle, which we call a \"molecule.\"\r\nSingle atoms do not, as a rule, exist apart from other atoms; if a\r\nmolecule is broken up, the individual atoms seek to unite with other\r\natoms of another kind or amongst themselves. For example, three atoms of\r\noxygen form what we call ozone; two atoms of hydrogen uniting with one\r\natom of oxygen form water. It is molecules that form the mass of matter;\r\na molecule, as it has been expressed, is a little building of which\r\natoms are the bricks.\r\n\r\nIn this way we get a useful first view of the material things we handle.\r\nIn a liquid the molecules of the liquid cling together loosely. They\r\nremain together as a body, but they roll over and away from each other.\r\nThere is \"cohesion\" between them, but it is less powerful than in a\r\nsolid. Put some water in a kettle over the lighted gas, and presently\r\nthe tiny molecules of water will rush through the spout in a cloud of\r\nsteam and scatter over the kitchen. The heat has broken their bond of\r\nassociation and turned the water into something like a gas; though we\r\nknow that the particles will come together again, as they cool, and form\r\nonce more drops of water.\r\n\r\nIn a gas the molecules have full individual liberty. They are in a\r\nstate of violent movement, and they form no union with each other. If we\r\nwant to force them to enter into the loose sort of association which\r\nmolecules have in a liquid, we have to slow down their individual\r\nmovements by applying severe cold. That is how a modern man of science\r\nliquefies gases. No power that we have will liquefy air at its ordinary\r\ntemperature. In _very_ severe cold, on the other hand, the air will\r\nspontaneously become liquid. Some day, when the fires of the sun have\r\nsunk very low, the temperature of the earth will be less than -200° C.:\r\nthat is to say, more than two hundred degrees Centigrade below\r\nfreezing-point. It will sink to the temperature of the moon. Our\r\natmosphere will then be an ocean of liquid air, 35 feet deep, lying upon\r\nthe solidly frozen masses of our water-oceans.\r\n\r\nIn a solid the molecules cling firmly to each other. We need a force\r\nequal to twenty-five tons to tear asunder the molecules in a bar of iron\r\nan inch thick. Yet the structure is not \"solid\" in the popular sense of\r\nthe word. If you put a piece of solid gold in a little pool of mercury,\r\nthe gold will take in the mercury _between_ its molecules, as if it were\r\nporous like a sponge. The hardest solid is more like a lattice-work than\r\nwhat we usually mean by \"solid\"; though the molecules are not fixed,\r\nlike the bars of a lattice-work, but are in violent motion; they vibrate\r\nabout equilibrium positions. If we could see right into the heart of a\r\nbit of the hardest steel, we should see billions of separate molecules,\r\nat some distance from each other, all moving rapidly to and fro.\r\n\r\nThis molecular movement can, in a measure, be made visible. It was\r\nnoticed by a microscopist named Brown that, in a solution containing\r\nvery fine suspended particles, the particles were in constant movement.\r\nUnder a powerful microscope these particles are seen to be violently\r\nagitated; they are each independently darting hither and thither\r\nsomewhat like a lot of billiard balls on a billiard table, colliding and\r\nbounding about in all directions. Thousands of times a second these\r\nencounters occur, and this lively commotion is always going on, this\r\nincessant colliding of one molecule with another is the normal\r\ncondition of affairs; not one of them is at rest. The reason for this\r\nhas been worked out, and it is now known that these particles move about\r\nbecause they are being incessantly bombarded by the molecules of the\r\nliquid. The molecules cannot, of course, be seen, but the fact of their\r\nincessant movement is revealed to the eye by the behaviour of the\r\nvisible suspended particles. This incessant movement in the world of\r\nmolecules is called the Brownian movement, and is a striking proof of\r\nthe reality of molecular motions.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2\r\n\r\nThe Wonder-World of Atoms\r\n\r\nThe exploration of this wonder-world of atoms and molecules by the\r\nphysicists and chemists of to-day is one of the most impressive triumphs\r\nof modern science. Quite apart from radium and electrons and other\r\nsensational discoveries of recent years, the study of ordinary matter is\r\nhardly inferior, either in interest or audacity, to the work of the\r\nastronomer. And there is the same foundation in both cases--marvellous\r\napparatus, and trains of mathematical reasoning that would have\r\nastonished Euclid or Archimedes. Extraordinary, therefore, as are some\r\nof the facts and figures we are now going to give in connection with the\r\nminuteness of atoms and molecules, let us bear in mind that we owe them\r\nto the most solid and severe processes of human thought.\r\n\r\nYet the principle can in most cases be made so clear that the reader\r\nwill not be asked to take much on trust. It is, for instance, a matter\r\nof common knowledge that gold is soft enough to be beaten into gold\r\nleaf. It is a matter of common sense, one hopes, that if you beat a\r\nmeasured cube of gold into a leaf six inches square, the mathematician\r\ncan tell the thickness of that leaf without measuring it. As a matter of\r\nfact, a single grain of gold has been beaten into a leaf seventy-five\r\ninches square. Now the mathematician can easily find that when a single\r\ngrain of gold is beaten out to that size, the leaf must be 1/367,000 of\r\nan inch thick, or about a thousand times thinner than the paper on\r\nwhich these words are printed; yet the leaf must be several molecules\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nThe finest gold leaf is, in fact, too thick for our purpose, and we turn\r\nwith a new interest to that toy of our boyhood the soap-bubble. If you\r\ncarefully examine one of these delicate films of soapy water, you notice\r\ncertain dark spots or patches on them. These are their thinnest parts,\r\nand by two quite independent methods--one using electricity and the\r\nother light--we have found that at these spots the bubble is less than\r\nthe three-millionth of an inch thick! But the molecules in the film\r\ncling together so firmly that they must be at least twenty or thirty\r\ndeep in the thinnest part. A molecule, therefore, must be far less than\r\nthe three-millionth of an inch thick.\r\n\r\nWe found next that a film of oil on the surface of water may be even\r\nthinner than a soap-bubble. Professor Perrin, the great French authority\r\non atoms, got films of oil down to the fifty-millionth of an inch in\r\nthickness! He poured a measured drop of oil upon water. Then he found\r\nthe exact limits of the area of the oil-sheet by blowing upon the water\r\na fine powder which spread to the edge of the film and clearly outlined\r\nit. The rest is safe and simple calculation, as in the case of the\r\nbeaten grain of gold. Now this film of oil must have been at least two\r\nmolecules deep, so a single molecule of oil is considerably less than a\r\nhundred-millionth of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nInnumerable methods have been tried, and the result is always the same.\r\nA single grain of indigo, for instance, will colour a ton of water. This\r\nobviously means that the grain contains billions of molecules which\r\nspread through the water. A grain of musk will scent a room--pour\r\nmolecules into every part of it--for several years, yet not lose\r\none-millionth of its mass in a year. There are a hundred ways of showing\r\nthe minuteness of the ultimate particles of matter, and some of these\r\nenable us to give definite figures. On a careful comparison of the best\r\nmethods we can say that the average molecule of matter is less than\r\nthe 1/125,000,000 of an inch in diameter. In a single cubic centimetre\r\nof air--a globule about the size of a small marble--there are thirty\r\nmillion trillion molecules. And since the molecule is, as we saw, a\r\ngroup or cluster of atoms, the atom itself is smaller. Atoms, for\r\nreasons which we shall see later, differ very greatly from each other in\r\nsize and weight. It is enough to say that some of them are so small that\r\nit would take 400,000,000 of them, in a line, to cover an inch of space;\r\nand that it takes at least a quintillion atoms of gold to weigh a single\r\ngramme. Five million atoms of helium could be placed in a line across\r\nthe diameter of a full stop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An atom is the smallest particle of a chemical element.\r\nTwo or more atoms come together to form a molecule: thus molecules form\r\nthe mass of matter. A molecule of water is made up of two atoms of\r\nhydrogen and one atom of oxygen. Molecules of different substances,\r\ntherefore, are of different sizes according to the number and kind of\r\nthe particular atoms of which they are composed. A starch molecule\r\ncontains no less than 25,000 atoms.\r\n\r\nMolecules, of course, are invisible. The above diagram illustrates the\r\n_comparative_ sizes of molecules.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INCONCEIVABLE NUMBERS AND INCONCEIVABLY SMALL PARTICLES\r\n\r\nThe molecules, which are inconceivably small, are, on the other hand, so\r\nnumerous that if one was able to place, end to end, all those contained\r\nin, for example, a cubic centimetre of gas (less than a fifteenth of a\r\ncubic inch), one would obtain a line capable of passing two hundred\r\ntimes round the earth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHAT IS A MILLION?\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the infinitely small, it is difficult to apprehend the\r\nvast figures with which scientists confront us. A million is one\r\nthousand thousand. We may realise what this implies if we consider that\r\na clock, beating seconds, takes approximately 278 hours (i.e. one week\r\nfour days fourteen hours) to tick one million times. A billion is one\r\nmillion million. To tick a billion the clock would tick for over 31,735\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n(In France and America a thousand millions is called a billion.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BROWNIAN MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nA diagram, constructed from actual observations, showing the erratic\r\npaths pursued by very fine particles suspended in a liquid, when\r\nbombarded by the molecules of the liquid. This movement is called the\r\nBrownian movement, and it furnishes a striking illustration of the truth\r\nof the theory that the molecules of a body are in a state of continual\r\nmotion.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Energy of Atoms\r\n\r\nAnd this is only the beginning of the wonders that were done with\r\n\"ordinary matter,\" quite apart from radium and its revelations, to which\r\nwe will come presently. Most people have heard of \"atomic energy,\" and\r\nthe extraordinary things that might be accomplished if we could harness\r\nthis energy and turn it to human use. A deeper and more wonderful source\r\nof this energy has been discovered in the last twenty years, but it is\r\nwell to realise that the atoms themselves have stupendous energy. The\r\natoms of matter are vibrating or gyrating with extraordinary vigour. The\r\npiece of cold iron you hold in your hand, the bit of brick you pick up,\r\nor the penny you take from your pocket is a colossal reservoir of\r\nenergy, since it consists of trillions of moving atoms. To realise the\r\ntotal energy, of course, we should have to witness a transformation such\r\nas we do in atoms of radio-active elements, about which we shall have\r\nsomething to say presently.\r\n\r\nIf we put a grain of indigo in a glass of water, or a grain of musk in a\r\nperfectly still room, we soon realise that molecules travel. Similarly,\r\nthe fact that gases spread until they fill every \"empty\" available space\r\nshows definitely that they consist of small particles travelling at\r\ngreat speed. The physicist brings his refined methods to bear on these\r\nthings, and he measures the energy and velocity of these infinitely\r\nminute molecules. He tells us that molecules of oxygen, at the\r\ntemperature of melting ice, travel at the rate of about 500 yards a\r\nsecond--more than a quarter of a mile a second. Molecules of hydrogen\r\ntravel at four times that speed, or three times the speed with which a\r\nbullet leaves a rifle. Each molecule of the air, which seems so still in\r\nthe house on a summer's day, is really travelling faster than a rifle\r\nbullet does at the beginning of its journey. It collides with another\r\nmolecule every twenty-thousandth of an inch of its journey. It is turned\r\nfrom its course 5,000,000,000 times in every second by collisions. If we\r\ncould stop the molecules of hydrogen gas, and utilise their energy, as\r\nwe utilise the energy of steam or the energy of the water at Niagara, we\r\nshould find enough in every gramme of gas (about two-thousandths of a\r\npound) to raise a third of a ton to a height of forty inches.\r\n\r\nI have used for comparison the speed of a rifle bullet, and in an\r\nearlier generation people would have thought it impossible even to\r\nestimate this. It is, of course, easy. We put two screens in the path of\r\nthe bullet, one near the rifle and the other some distance away. We\r\nconnect them electrically and use a fine time-recording machine, and the\r\nbullet itself registers the time it takes to travel from the first to\r\nthe second screen.\r\n\r\nNow this is very simple and superficial work in comparison with the\r\nsystem of exact and minute measurements which the physicist and chemist\r\nuse. In one of his interesting works Mr. Charles R. Gibson gives a\r\nphotograph of two exactly equal pieces of paper in the opposite pans of\r\na fine balance. A single word has been written in pencil on one of these\r\npapers, and that little scraping of lead has been enough to bring down\r\nthe scale! The spectroscope will detect a quantity of matter four\r\nmillion times smaller even than this; and the electroscope is a million\r\ntimes still more sensitive than the spectroscope. We have a\r\nheat-measuring instrument, the bolometer, which makes the best\r\nthermometer seem Early Victorian. It records the millionth of a degree\r\nof temperature. It is such instruments, multiplied by the score,\r\nwhich enable us to do the fine work recorded in these pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Reproduced from \"The Forces of Nature\" (Messrs.\r\nMacmillan)._\r\n\r\nA SOAP BUBBLE\r\n\r\nThe iridescent colours sometimes seen on a soap bubble, as in the\r\nillustration, may also be seen in very fine sections of crystals, in\r\nglass blown into extremely fine bulbs, on the wings of dragon-flies and\r\nthe surface of oily water. The different colours correspond to different\r\nthicknesses of the surface. Part of the light which strikes these thin\r\ncoatings is reflected from the upper surface, but another part of the\r\nlight penetrates the transparent coating and is reflected from the lower\r\nsurface. It is the mixture of these two reflected rays, their\r\n\"interference\" as it is called, which produces the colours observed. The\r\n\"black spots\" on a soap bubble are the places where the soapy film is\r\nthinnest. At the black spots the thickness of the bubble is about the\r\nthree-millionth part of an inch. If the whole bubble were as thin as\r\nthis it would be completely invisible.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF X-RAYS AND RADIUM\r\n\r\nThe Discovery of Sir Wm. Crookes\r\n\r\nBut these wonders of the atom are only a prelude to the more romantic\r\nand far-reaching discoveries of the new physics--the wonders of the\r\nelectron. Another and the most important phase of our exploration of the\r\nmaterial universe opened with the discovery of radium in 1898.\r\n\r\nIn the discovery of radio-active elements, a new property of matter was\r\ndiscovered. What followed on the discovery of radium and of the X-rays\r\nwe shall see.\r\n\r\nAs Sir Ernest Rutherford, one of our greatest authorities, recently\r\nsaid, the new physics has dissipated the last doubt about the reality of\r\natoms and molecules. The closer examination of matter which we have been\r\nable to make shows positively that it is composed of atoms. But we must\r\nnot take the word now in its original Greek meaning (an \"indivisible\"\r\nthing). The atoms are not indivisible. They can be broken up. They are\r\ncomposed of still smaller particles.\r\n\r\nThe discovery that the atom was composed of smaller particles was the\r\nwelcome realisation of a dream that had haunted the imagination of the\r\nnineteenth century. Chemists said that there were about eighty different\r\nkinds of atoms--different kinds of matter--but no one was satisfied with\r\nthe multiplicity. Science is always aiming at simplicity and unity. It\r\nmay be that science has now taken a long step in the direction of\r\nexplaining the fundamental unity of all the matter. The chemist was\r\nunable to break up these \"elements\" into something simpler, so he called\r\ntheir atoms \"indivisible\" in that sense. But one man of science after\r\nanother expressed the hope that we would yet discover some fundamental\r\nmatter of which the various atoms were composed--_one primordial\r\nsubstance from which all the varying forms of matter have been evolved\r\nor built up_. Prout suggested this at the very beginning of the century,\r\nwhen atoms were rediscovered by Dalton. Father Secchi, the famous Jesuit\r\nastronomer said that all the atoms were probably evolved from ether; and\r\nthis was a very favoured speculation. Sir William Crookes talked of\r\n\"prothyl\" as the fundamental substance. Others thought hydrogen was the\r\nstuff out of which all the other atoms were composed.\r\n\r\nThe work which finally resulted in the discovery of radium began with\r\nsome beautiful experiments of Professor (later Sir William) Crookes in\r\nthe eighties.\r\n\r\nIt had been noticed in 1869 that a strange colouring was caused when an\r\nelectric charge was sent through a vacuum tube--the walls of the glass\r\ntube began to glow with a greenish phosphorescence. A vacuum tube is one\r\nfrom which nearly all the air has been pumped, although we can never\r\ncompletely empty the tube. Crookes used such ingenious methods that he\r\nreduced the gas in his tubes until it was twenty million times thinner\r\nthan the atmosphere. He then sent an electric discharge through, and got\r\nvery remarkable results. The negative pole of the electric current (the\r\n\"cathode\") _gave off rays which faintly lit the molecules of the thin\r\ngas in the tube_, and caused a pretty fluorescence on the glass walls of\r\nthe tube. What were these Rays? Crookes at first thought they\r\ncorresponded to a \"new or fourth state of matter.\" Hitherto we had only\r\nbeen familiar with matter in the three conditions of solid, liquid, and\r\ngaseous.\r\n\r\nNow Crookes really had the great secret under his eyes. But about twenty\r\nyears elapsed before the true nature of these rays was finally and\r\nindependently established by various experiments. The experiments proved\r\n\"that the rays consisted of a stream of negatively charged particles\r\ntravelling with enormous velocities from 10,000 to 100,000 miles a\r\nsecond. In addition, it was found that the mass of each particle was\r\nexceedingly small, about 1/1800 of the mass of a hydrogen atom, the\r\nlightest atom known to science.\" _These particles or electrons, as they\r\nare now called, were being liberated from the atom._ The atoms of matter\r\nwere breaking down in Crookes tubes. At that time, however, it was\r\npremature to think of such a thing, and Crookes preferred to say that\r\nthe particles of the gas were electrified and hurled against the walls\r\nof the tube. He said that it was ordinary matter in a new\r\nstate--\"radiant matter.\" Another distinguished man of science, Lenard,\r\nfound that, when he fitted a little plate of aluminum in the glass wall\r\nof the tube, the mysterious rays passed through this as if it were a\r\nwindow. They must be waves in the ether, he said.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From \"Scientific Ideas of To-day_.\"\r\n\r\nDETECTING A SMALL QUANTITY OF MATTER\r\n\r\nIn the left-hand photograph the two pieces of paper exactly balance. The\r\nbalance used is very sensitive, and when the single word \"atoms\" has\r\nbeen written with a lead pencil upon one of the papers the additional\r\nweight is sufficient to depress one of the pans as shown in the second\r\nphotograph. The spectroscope will detect less than one-millionth of the\r\nmatter contained in the word pencilled above.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Reproduced by permission of X-Rays Ltd._\r\n\r\nTHIS X-RAY PHOTOGRAPH IS THAT OF A HAND OF A SOLDIER WOUNDED IN THE\r\nGREAT WAR\r\n\r\nNote the pieces of shrapnel which are revealed.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: National Physical Laboratory._\r\n\r\nAN X-RAY PHOTOGRAPH OF A GOLF BALL, REVEALING AN IMPERFECT CORE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Reproduced by permission of X-Rays Ltd._\r\n\r\nA WONDERFUL X-RAY PHOTOGRAPH\r\n\r\nNote the fine details revealed, down to the metal tags of the bootlace\r\nand the nails in the heel of the boot.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4\r\n\r\nThe Discovery of X-rays\r\n\r\nSo the story went on from year to year. We shall see in a moment to what\r\nit led. Meanwhile the next great step was when, in 1895, Röntgen\r\ndiscovered the X-rays, which are now known to everybody. He was\r\nfollowing up the work of Lenard, and he one day covered a \"Crookes tube\"\r\nwith some black stuff. To his astonishment a prepared chemical screen\r\nwhich was near the tube began to glow. _The rays had gone through the\r\nblack stuff; and on further experiment he found that they would go\r\nthrough stone, living flesh, and all sorts of \"opaque\" substances._ In a\r\nshort time the world was astonished to learn that we could photograph\r\nthe skeleton in a living man's body, locate a penny in the interior of a\r\nchild that had swallowed one, or take an impression of a coin through a\r\nslab of stone.\r\n\r\nAnd what are these X-rays? They are not a form of matter; they are not\r\nmaterial particles. X-rays were found to be a new variety of _light_\r\nwith a remarkable power of penetration. We have seen what the\r\nspectroscope reveals about the varying nature of light wave-lengths.\r\nLight-waves are set up by vibrations in ether,[2] and, as we shall see,\r\nthese ether disturbances are all of the same kind; they only differ as\r\nregards wave-lengths. The X-rays which Röntgen discovered, then, are\r\nlight, but a variety of light previously unknown to us; they are ether\r\nwaves of very short length. X-rays have proved of great value in many\r\ndirections, as all the world knows, but that we need not discuss at this\r\npoint. Let us see what followed Röntgen's discovery.\r\n\r\n    [2] We refer throughout to the \"ether\" because, although modern\r\n    theories dispense largely with this conception, the theories of\r\n    physics are so inextricably interwoven with it that it is necessary,\r\n    in an elementary exposition, to assume its existence. The modern\r\n    view will be explained later in the article on Einstein's Theory.\r\n\r\nWhile the world wondered at these marvels, the men of science were\r\neagerly following up the new clue to the mystery of matter which was\r\nexercising the mind of Crookes and other investigators. In 1896\r\nBecquerel brought us to the threshold of the great discovery.\r\n\r\nCertain substances are phosphorescent--they become luminous after they\r\nhave been exposed to sunlight for some time, and Becquerel was trying to\r\nfind if any of these substances give rise to X-rays. One day he chose a\r\nsalt of the metal uranium. He was going to see if, after exposing it to\r\nsunlight, he could photograph a cross with it through an opaque\r\nsubstance. He wrapped it up and laid it aside, to wait for the sun, but\r\nhe found the uranium salt did not wait for the sun. Some strong\r\nradiation from it went through the opaque covering and made an\r\nimpression of the cross upon the plate underneath. Light or darkness was\r\nimmaterial. The mysterious rays streamed night and day from the salt.\r\nThis was something new. Here was a substance which appeared to be\r\nproducing X-rays; the rays emitted by uranium would penetrate the same\r\nopaque substances as the X-rays discovered by Röntgen.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscovery of Radium\r\n\r\nNow, at the same time as many other investigators, Professor Curie and\r\nhis Polish wife took up the search. They decided to find out whether\r\nthe emission came from the uranium itself or _from something associated\r\nwith it_, and for this purpose they made a chemical analysis of great\r\nquantities of minerals. They found a certain kind of pitchblende which\r\nwas very active, and they analysed tons of it, concentrating always on\r\nthe radiant element in it. After a time, as they successively worked out\r\nthe non-radiant matter, the stuff began to glow. In the end they\r\nextracted from eight tons of pitchblende about half a teaspoonful of\r\nsomething _that was a million times more radiant than uranium_. There\r\nwas only one name for it--Radium.\r\n\r\nThat was the starting-point of the new development of physics and\r\nchemistry. From every laboratory in the world came a cry for radium\r\nsalts (as pure radium was too precious), and hundreds of brilliant\r\nworkers fastened on the new element. The inquiry was broadened, and, as\r\nyear followed year, one substance after another was found to possess the\r\npower of emitting rays, that is, to be radio-active. We know to-day that\r\nnearly every form of matter can be stimulated to radio-activity; which,\r\nas we shall see, means that _its atoms break up into smaller and\r\nwonderfully energetic particles which we call \"electrons.\"_ This\r\ndiscovery of electrons has brought about a complete change in our ideas\r\nin many directions.\r\n\r\nSo, instead of atoms being indivisible, they are actually dividing\r\nthemselves, spontaneously, and giving off throughout the universe tiny\r\nfragments of their substance. We shall explain presently what was later\r\ndiscovered about the electron; meanwhile we can say that every glowing\r\nmetal is pouring out a stream of these electrons. Every arc-lamp is\r\ndischarging them. Every clap of thunder means a shower of them. Every\r\nstar is flooding space with them. We are witnessing the spontaneous\r\nbreaking up of atoms, atoms which had been thought to be indivisible.\r\nThe sun not only pours out streams of electrons from its own atoms, but\r\nthe ultra-violet light which it sends to the earth is one of the most\r\npowerful agencies for releasing electrons from the surface-atoms of\r\nmatter on the earth. It is fortunate for us that our atmosphere absorbs\r\nmost of this ultra-violet or invisible light of the sun--a kind of light\r\nwhich will be explained presently. It has been suggested that, if we\r\nreceived the full flood of it from the sun, our metals would\r\ndisintegrate under its influence and this \"steel civilisation\" of ours\r\nwould be impossible!\r\n\r\nBut we are here anticipating, we are going beyond radium to the\r\nwonderful discoveries which were made by the chemists and physicists of\r\nthe world who concentrated upon it. The work of Professor and Mme. Curie\r\nwas merely the final clue to guide the great search. How it was followed\r\nup, how we penetrated into the very heart of the minute atom and\r\ndiscovered new and portentous mines of energy, and how we were able to\r\nunderstand, not only matter, but electricity and light, will be told in\r\nthe next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF THE ELECTRON AND HOW IT EFFECTED A REVOLUTION IN IDEAS\r\n\r\nWhat the discovery of radium implied was only gradually realised. Radium\r\ncaptivated the imagination of the world; it was a boon to medicine, but\r\nto the man of science it was at first a most puzzling and most\r\nattractive phenomenon. It was felt that some great secret of nature was\r\ndimly unveiled in its wonderful manifestations, and there now\r\nconcentrated upon it as gifted a body of men--conspicuous amongst them\r\nSir J. J. Thomson, Sir Ernest Rutherford, Sir W. Ramsay, and Professor\r\nSoddy--as any age could boast, with an apparatus of research as far\r\nbeyond that of any other age as the _Aquitania_ is beyond a Roman\r\ngalley. Within five years the secret was fairly mastered. Not only were\r\nall kinds of matter reduced to a common basis, but the forces of the\r\nuniverse were brought into a unity and understood as they had never been\r\nunderstood before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRIC DISCHARGE IN A VACUUM TUBE\r\n\r\nThe two ends, marked + and -, of a tube from which nearly all air has\r\nbeen exhausted are connected to electric terminals, thus producing an\r\nelectric discharge in the vacuum tube. This discharge travels straight\r\nalong the tube, as in the upper diagram. When a magnetic field is\r\napplied, however, the rays are deflected, as shown in the lower diagram.\r\nThe similarity of the behaviour of the electric discharge with the\r\nradium rays (see diagram of deflection of radium rays, _post_) shows\r\nthat the two phenomena may be identified. It was by this means that the\r\ncharacteristics of electrons were first discovered.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RELATIVE SIZES OF ATOMS AND ELECTRONS\r\n\r\nAn atom is far too small to be seen. In a bubble of hydrogen gas no\r\nlarger than the letter \"O\" there are billions of atoms, whilst an\r\nelectron is more than a thousand times smaller than the smallest atom.\r\nHow their size is ascertained is described in the text. In this diagram\r\na bubble of gas is magnified to the size of the world. Adopting this\r\nscale, _each atom_ in the bubble would then be as large as a tennis\r\nball.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IF AN ATOM WERE MAGNIFIED TO THE SIZE OF ST. PAUL'S\r\nCATHEDRAL, EACH ELECTRON IN THE ATOM (AS REPRESENTED BY THE CATHEDRAL)\r\nWOULD THEN BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL BULLET]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRONS STREAMING FROM THE SUN TO THE EARTH\r\n\r\nThere are strong reasons for supposing that sun-spots are huge\r\nelectronic cyclones. The sun is constantly pouring out vast streams of\r\nelectrons into space. Many of these streams encounter the earth, giving\r\nrise to various electrical phenomena.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5\r\n\r\nThe Discovery of the Electron\r\n\r\nPhysicists did not take long to discover that the radiation from radium\r\nwas very like the radiation in a \"Crookes tube.\" It was quickly\r\nrecognised, moreover, that both in the tube and in radium (and other\r\nmetals) the atoms of matter were somehow breaking down.\r\n\r\nHowever, the first step was to recognise that there were three distinct\r\nand different rays that were given off by such metals as radium and\r\nuranium. Sir Ernest Rutherford christened them, after the first three\r\nletters of the Greek alphabet, the Alpha, the Beta, and Gamma rays. We\r\nare concerned chiefly with the second group and purpose here to deal\r\nwith that group only.[3]\r\n\r\n    [3] The \"Alpha rays\" were presently recognised as atoms of helium\r\n    gas, shot out at the rate of 12,000 miles a second.\r\n\r\nThe \"Gamma rays\" are _waves_, like the X-rays, not material particles.\r\nThey appear to be a type of X-rays. They possess the remarkable power of\r\npenetrating opaque substances; they will pass through a foot of solid\r\niron, for example.\r\n\r\nThe \"Beta rays,\" as they were at first called, have proved to be one of\r\nthe most interesting discoveries that science ever made. They proved\r\nwhat Crookes had surmised about the radiations he discovered in his\r\nvacuum tube. But it was _not_ a fourth state of matter that had been\r\nfound, but a new _property_ of matter, a property common to all atoms of\r\nmatter. The Beta rays were later christened Electrons. They are\r\nparticles of disembodied electricity, here spontaneously liberated from\r\nthe atoms of matter: only when the electron was isolated from the atom\r\nwas it recognised for the first time as a separate entity. Electrons,\r\ntherefore, are a constituent of the atoms of matter, and we have\r\ndiscovered that they can be released from the atom by a variety of\r\nagencies. Electrons are to be found everywhere, forming part of every\r\natom.\r\n\r\n\"An electron,\" Sir William Bragg says, \"can only maintain a separate\r\nexistence if it is travelling at an immense rate, from one\r\nthree-hundredth of the velocity of light upwards, that is to say, at\r\nleast 600 _miles a second, or thereabouts_. Otherwise the electron\r\nsticks to the first atom it meets.\" These amazing particles may travel\r\nwith the enormous velocity of from 10,000 to more than 100,000 miles a\r\nsecond. It was first learned that they are of an electrical nature,\r\nbecause they are bent out of their normal path if a magnet is brought\r\nnear them. And this fact led to a further discovery: to one of those\r\nsensational estimates which the general public is apt to believe to be\r\nfounded on the most abstruse speculations. The physicist set up a little\r\nchemical screen for the \"Beta rays\" to hit, and he so arranged his tube\r\nthat only a narrow sheaf of the rays poured on to the screen. He then\r\ndrew this sheaf of rays out of its course with a magnet, and he\r\naccurately measured the shift of the luminous spot on the screen where\r\nthe rays impinged on it. But when he knows the exact intensity of his\r\nmagnetic field--which he can control as he likes--and the amount of\r\ndeviation it causes, and the mass of the moving particles, he can tell\r\nthe speed of the moving particles which he thus diverts. These particles\r\nwere being hurled out of the atoms of radium, or from the negative pole\r\nin a vacuum tube, at a speed which, in good conditions, reached nearly\r\nthe velocity of light, i.e. nearly 186,000 miles a second.\r\n\r\nTheir speed has, of course, been confirmed by numbers of experiments;\r\nand another series of experiments enabled physicists to determine the\r\nsize of the particles. Only one of these need be described, to give the\r\nreader an idea how men of science arrived at their more startling\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nFog, as most people know, is thick in our great cities because the\r\nwater-vapour gathers on the particles of dust and smoke that are in the\r\natmosphere. This fact was used as the basis of some beautiful\r\nexperiments. Artificial fogs were created in little glass tubes, by\r\nintroducing dust, in various proportions, for supersaturated vapour to\r\ngather on. In the end it was possible to cause tiny drops of rain, each\r\nwith a particle of dust at its core, to fall upon a silver mirror and be\r\ncounted. It was a method of counting the quite invisible particles of\r\ndust in the tube; and the method was now successfully applied to the new\r\nrays. Yet another method was to direct a slender stream of the particles\r\nupon a chemical screen. The screen glowed under the cannonade of\r\nparticles, and a powerful lens resolved the glow into distinct sparks,\r\nwhich could be counted.\r\n\r\nIn short, a series of the most remarkable and beautiful experiments,\r\nchecked in all the great laboratories of the world, settled the nature\r\nof these so-called rays. They were streams of particles more than a\r\nthousand times smaller than the smallest known atom. The mass of each\r\nparticle is, according to the latest and finest measurements 1/1845 of\r\nthat of an atom of hydrogen. The physicist has not been able to find any\r\ncharacter except electricity in them, and the name \"electrons\" has been\r\ngenerally adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Key to many Mysteries\r\n\r\nThe Electron is an atom, of disembodied electricity; it occupies an\r\nexceedingly small volume, and its \"mass\" is entirely electrical. These\r\nelectrons are the key to half the mysteries of matter. Electrons in\r\nrapid motion, as we shall see, explain what we mean by an \"electric\r\ncurrent,\" not so long ago regarded as one of the most mysterious\r\nmanifestations in nature.\r\n\r\n\"What a wonder, then, have we here!\" says Professor R. K. Duncan. \"An\r\ninnocent-looking little pinch of salt and yet possessed of special\r\nproperties utterly beyond even the fanciful imaginings of men of past\r\ntime; for nowhere do we find in the records of thought even the hint of\r\nthe possibility of things which we now regard as established fact. This\r\npinch of salt projects from its surface bodies [i.e. electrons]\r\npossessing the inconceivable velocity of over 100,000 miles a second, a\r\nvelocity sufficient to carry them, if unimpeded, five times around the\r\nearth in a second, and possessing with this velocity, masses a thousand\r\ntimes smaller than the smallest atom known to science. Furthermore,\r\nthey are charged with negative electricity; they pass straight through\r\nbodies considered opaque with a sublime indifference to the properties\r\nof the body, with the exception of its mere density; they cause bodies\r\nwhich they strike to shine out in the dark; they affect a photographic\r\nplate; they render the air a conductor of electricity; they cause clouds\r\nin moist air; they cause chemical action and have a peculiar\r\nphysiological action. Who, to-day, shall predict the ultimate service to\r\nhumanity of the beta-rays from radium!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRON THEORY, OR THE NEW VIEW OF MATTER\r\n\r\nThe Structure of the Atom\r\n\r\nThere is general agreement amongst all chemists, physicists, and\r\nmathematicians upon the conclusions which we have so far given. We know\r\nthat the atoms of matter are constantly--either spontaneously or under\r\nstimulation--giving off electrons, or breaking up into electrons; and\r\nthey therefore contain electrons. Thus we have now complete proof of the\r\nindependent existence of atoms and also of electrons.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the man of science tries to tell us _how_ electrons\r\ncompose atoms, he passes from facts to speculation, and very difficult\r\nspeculation. Take the letter \"o\" as it is printed on this page. In a\r\nlittle bubble of hydrogen gas no larger than that letter there are\r\n_trillions_ of atoms; and they are not packed together, but are\r\ncirculating as freely as dancers in a ball-room. We are asking the\r\nphysicist to take one of these minute atoms and tell us how the still\r\nsmaller electrons are arranged in it. Naturally he can only make mental\r\npictures, guesses or hypotheses, which he tries to fit to the facts, and\r\ndiscards when they will _not_ fit.\r\n\r\nAt present, after nearly twenty years of critical discussion, there are\r\ntwo chief theories of the structure of the atom. At first Sir J. J.\r\nThomson imagined the electrons circulating in shells (like the layers of\r\nan onion) round the nucleus of the atom. This did not suit, and Sir E.\r\nRutherford and others worked out a theory that the electrons circulated\r\nround a nucleus rather like the planets of our solar system revolving\r\nround the central sun. Is there a nucleus, then, round which the\r\nelectrons revolve? The electron, as we saw, is a disembodied atom of\r\nelectricity; we should say, of \"negative\" electricity. Let us picture\r\nthese electrons all moving round in orbits with great velocity. Now it\r\nis suggested that there is a nucleus of \"positive\" electricity\r\nattracting or pulling the revolving electrons to it, and so forming an\r\nequilibrium, otherwise the electrons would fly off in all directions.\r\nThis nucleus has been recently named the proton. We have thus two\r\nelectricities in the atom: the positive = the nucleus; the negative =\r\nthe electron. Of recent years Dr. Langmuir has put out a theory that the\r\nelectrons do not _revolve round_ the nucleus, but remain in a state of\r\nviolent agitation of some sort at fixed distances from the nucleus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROFESSOR SIR J. J. THOMSON\r\n\r\nExperimental discoverer of the electronic constitution of matter, in the\r\nCavendish Physical Laboratory, Cambridge.

When a magnetic field is applied the rays are seen to be\r\ndeflected, as in the diagram. This can only happen if the rays carry an\r\nelectric charge, and it was by experiments of this kind that we obtained\r\nour knowledge respecting the electric charges carried by radium rays.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Reproduced by permission of \"Scientific American.\"_\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR R. A. MILLIKAN'S APPARATUS FOR COUNTING ELECTRONS]\r\n\r\nBut we will confine ourselves here to the facts, and leave the\r\ncontending theories to scientific men. It is now pretty generally\r\naccepted that an atom of matter consists of a number of electrons, or\r\ncharges of negative electricity, held together by a charge of positive\r\nelectricity. It is not disputed that these electrons are in a state of\r\nviolent motion or strain, and that therefore a vast energy is locked up\r\nin the atoms of matter. To that we will return later. Here, rather, we\r\nwill notice another remarkable discovery which helps us to understand\r\nthe nature of matter.\r\n\r\nA brilliant young man of science who was killed in the war, Mr. Moseley,\r\nsome years ago showed that, when the atoms of different substances are\r\narranged in order of their weight, _they are also arranged in the order\r\nof increasing complexity of structure_. That is to say, the heavier the\r\natom, the more electrons it contains. There is a gradual building up of\r\natoms containing more and more electrons from the lightest atom to the\r\nheaviest. Here it is enough to say that as he took element after\r\nelement, from the lightest (hydrogen) to the heaviest (uranium) he found\r\na strangely regular relation between them. If hydrogen were represented\r\nby the figure one, helium by two, lithium three, and so on up to\r\nuranium, then uranium should have the figure ninety-two. This makes it\r\nprobable that there are in nature ninety-two elements--we have found\r\neighty-seven--and that the number Mr. Moseley found is the number of\r\nelectrons in the atom of each element; that is to say, the number is\r\narranged in order of the atomic numbers of the various elements.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7\r\n\r\nThe New View of Matter\r\n\r\nUp to the point we have reached, then, we see what the new view of\r\nMatter is. Every atom of matter, of whatever kind throughout the whole\r\nuniverse, is built up of electrons in conjunction with a nucleus. From\r\nthe smallest atom of all--the atom of hydrogen--which consists of one\r\nelectron, rotating round a positively charged nucleus, to a heavy\r\ncomplicated atom, such as the atom of gold, constituted of many\r\nelectrons and a complex nucleus, _we have only to do with positive and\r\nnegative units of electricity_. The electron and its nucleus are\r\nparticles of electricity. All Matter, therefore, is nothing but a\r\nmanifestation of electricity. The atoms of matter, as we saw, combine\r\nand form molecules. Atoms and molecules are the bricks out of which\r\nnature has built up everything; ourselves, the earth, the stars, the\r\nwhole universe.\r\n\r\nBut more than bricks are required to build a house. There are other\r\nfundamental existences, such as the various forms of energy, which give\r\nrise to several complex problems. And we have also to remember, that\r\nthere are more than eighty distinct elements, each with its own definite\r\ntype of atom. We shall deal with energy later. Meanwhile it remains to\r\nbe said that, although we have discovered a great deal about the\r\nelectron and the constitution of matter, and that while the physicists\r\nof our own day seem to see a possibility of explaining positive and\r\nnegative electricity, the nature of them both is unknown. There exists\r\nthe theory that the particles of positive and negative electricity,\r\nwhich make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of disturbances\r\nof some kind in a universal ether, and that all the various forms of\r\nenergy are, in some fundamental way, aspects of the same primary entity\r\nwhich constitutes matter itself.\r\n\r\nBut the discovery of the property of radio-activity has raised many\r\nother interesting questions, besides that which we have just dealt with.\r\nIn radio-active elements, such as uranium for example, the element is\r\nbreaking down; in what we call radio-activity we have a manifestation of\r\nthe spontaneous change of elements. What is really taking place is a\r\ntransmutation of one element into another, from a heavier to a lighter.\r\nThe element uranium spontaneously becomes radium, and radium passes\r\nthrough a number of other stages until it, in turn, becomes lead. Each\r\ndescending element is of lighter atomic weight than its predecessor. The\r\nchanging process, of course, is a very slow one. It may be that all\r\nmatter is radio-active, or can be made so. This raises the question\r\nwhether all the matter in the universe may not undergo disintegration.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another side of the question, which the discovery of\r\nradio-activity has brought to light, and which has effected a revolution\r\nin our views. We have seen that in radio-active substances the elements\r\nare breaking down. Is there a process of building up at work? If the\r\nmore complicated atoms are breaking down into simpler forms, may there\r\nnot be a converse process--a building up from simpler elements to more\r\ncomplicated elements? It is probably the case that both processes are at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThere are some eighty-odd chemical elements on the earth to-day: are\r\nthey all the outcome of an inorganic evolution, element giving rise to\r\nelement, going back and back to some primeval stuff from which they\r\nwere all originally derived infinitely long ago? Is there an evolution\r\nin the inorganic world which may be going on, parallel to that of the\r\nevolution of living things; or is organic evolution a continuation of\r\ninorganic evolution? We have seen what evidence there is of this\r\ninorganic evolution in the case of the stars. We cannot go deeply into\r\nthe matter here, nor has the time come for any direct statement that can\r\nbe based on the findings of modern investigation. Taking it altogether\r\nthe evidence is steadily accumulating, and there are authorities who\r\nmaintain that already the evidence of inorganic evolution is convincing\r\nenough. The heavier atoms would appear to behave as though they were\r\nevolved from the lighter. The more complex forms, it is supposed, have\r\n_evolved_ from the simpler forms. Moseley's discovery, to which\r\nreference has been made, points to the conclusion that the elements are\r\nbuilt up one from another.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8\r\n\r\nOther New Views\r\n\r\nWe may here refer to another new conception to which the discovery of\r\nradio-activity has given rise. Lord Kelvin, who estimated the age of the\r\nearth at twenty million years, reached this estimate by considering the\r\nearth as a body which is gradually cooling down, \"losing its primitive\r\nheat, like a loaf taken from the oven, at a rate which could be\r\ncalculated, and that the heat radiated by the sun was due to\r\ncontraction.\" Uranium and radio-activity were not known to Kelvin, and\r\ntheir discovery has upset both his arguments. Radio-active substances,\r\nwhich are perpetually giving out heat, introduce an entirely new factor.\r\nWe cannot now assume that the earth is necessarily cooling down; it may\r\neven, for all we know, be getting hotter. At the 1921 meeting of the\r\nBritish Association, Professor Rayleigh stated that further knowledge\r\nhad extended the probable period during which there had been life on\r\nthis globe to about one thousand million years, and the total age of\r\nthe earth to some small multiple of that. The earth, he considers, is\r\nnot cooling, but \"contains an internal source of heat from the\r\ndisintegration of uranium in the outer crust.\" On the whole the estimate\r\nobtained would seem to be in agreement with the geological estimates.\r\nThe question, of course, cannot, in the present state of our knowledge,\r\nbe settled within fixed limits that meet with general agreement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKING THE INVISIBLE VISIBLE\r\n\r\nRadium, as explained in the text, emits rays--the \"Alpha,\" the \"Beta\"\r\n(electrons), and \"Gamma\" rays. The above illustration indicates the\r\nmethod by which these invisible rays are made visible, and enables the\r\nnature of the rays to be investigated. To the right of the diagram is\r\nthe instrument used, the Spinthariscope, making the impact of radium\r\nrays visible on a screen.\r\n\r\nThe radium rays shoot out in all directions; those that fall on the\r\nscreen make it glow with points of light. These points of light are\r\nobserved by the magnifying lens.\r\n\r\nA. Magnifying lens. B. A zinc sulphite screen. C. A needle on whose\r\npoint is placed a speck of radium.\r\n\r\nThe lower picture shows the screen and needle magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THEORY OF ELECTRONS\r\n\r\nAn atom of matter is composed of electrons. We picture an atom as a sort\r\nof miniature solar system, the electrons (particles of negative\r\nelectricity) rotating round a central nucleus of positive electricity,\r\nas described in the text. In the above pictorial representation of an\r\natom the whirling electrons are indicated in the outer ring. Electrons\r\nmove with incredible speed as they pass from one atom to another.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARRANGEMENTS OF ATOMS IN A DIAMOND\r\n\r\nThe above is a model (seen from two points of view) of the arrangement\r\nof the atoms in a diamond. The arrangement is found by studying the\r\nX-ray spectra of the diamond.]\r\n\r\nAs we have said, there are other fundamental existences which give rise\r\nto more complex problems. The three great fundamental entities in the\r\nphysical universe are matter, ether, and energy; so far as we know,\r\noutside these there is nothing. We have dealt with matter, there remain\r\nether and energy. We shall see that just as no particle of matter,\r\nhowever small, may be created or destroyed, and just as there is no such\r\nthing as empty space--ether pervades everything--so there is no such\r\nthing as _rest_. Every particle that goes to make up our solid earth is\r\nin a state of perpetual unremitting vibration; energy \"is the universal\r\ncommodity on which all life depends.\" Separate and distinct as these\r\nthree fundamental entities--matter, ether, and energy--may appear, it\r\nmay be that, after all, they are only different and mysterious phases of\r\nan essential \"oneness\" of the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9\r\n\r\nThe Future\r\n\r\nLet us, in concluding this chapter, give just one illustration of the\r\nway in which all this new knowledge may prove to be as valuable\r\npractically as it is wonderful intellectually. We saw that electrons are\r\nshot out of atoms at a speed that may approach 160,000 miles a second.\r\nSir Oliver Lodge has written recently that a seventieth of a grain of\r\nradium discharges, at a speed a thousand times that of a rifle bullet,\r\nthirty million electrons a second. Professor Le Bon has calculated that\r\nit would take 1,340,000 barrels of powder to give a bullet the speed of\r\none of these electrons. He shows that the smallest French copper\r\ncoin--smaller than a farthing--contains an energy equal to eighty\r\nmillion horsepower. A few pounds of matter contain more energy than we\r\ncould extract from millions of tons of coal. Even in the atoms of\r\nhydrogen at a temperature which we could produce in an electric furnace\r\nthe electrons spin round at a rate of nearly a hundred trillion\r\nrevolutions a second!\r\n\r\nEvery man asks at once: \"Will science ever tap this energy?\" If it does,\r\nno more smoke, no mining, no transit, no bulky fuel. The energy of an\r\natom is of course only liberated when an atom passes from one state to\r\nanother. The stored up energy is fortunately fast bound by the electrons\r\nbeing held together as has been described. If it were not so \"the earth\r\nwould explode and become a gaseous nebula\"! It is believed that some day\r\nwe shall be able to release, harness, and utilise atomic energy. \"I am\r\nof opinion,\" says Sir William Bragg, \"that atom energy will supply our\r\nfuture need. A thousand years may pass before we can harness the atom,\r\nor to-morrow might see us with the reins in our hands. That is the\r\npeculiarity of Physics--research and 'accidental' discovery go hand in\r\nhand.\" Half a brick contains as much energy as a small coal-field. The\r\ndifficulties are tremendous, but, as Sir Oliver Lodge reminds us, there\r\nwas just as much scepticism at one time about the utilisation of steam\r\nor electricity. \"Is it to be supposed,\" he asks, \"that there can be no\r\nfresh invention, that all the discoveries have been made?\" More than one\r\nman of science encourages us to hope. Here are some remarkable words\r\nwritten by Professor Soddy, one of the highest authorities on\r\nradio-active matter, in our chief scientific weekly (_Nature_, November\r\n6, 1919):\r\n\r\n    The prospects of the successful accomplishment of artificial\r\n    transmutation brighten almost daily. The ancients seem to have had\r\n    something more than an inkling that the accomplishment of\r\n    transmutation would confer upon men powers hitherto the prerogative\r\n    of the gods. But now we know definitely that the material aspect of\r\n    transmutation would be of small importance in comparison with the\r\n    control over the inexhaustible stores of internal atomic energy to\r\n    which its successful accomplishment would inevitably lead. It has\r\n    become a problem, no longer redolent of the evil associations of the\r\n    age of alchemy, but one big with the promise of a veritable physical\r\n    renaissance of the whole world.\r\n\r\nIf that \"promise\" is ever realised, the economic and social face of the\r\nworld will be transformed.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the consideration of ether, light, and energy, let\r\nus see what new light the discovery of the electron has thrown on the\r\nnature and manipulation of electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS ELECTRICITY?\r\n\r\nThe Nature of Electricity\r\n\r\nThere is at least one manifestation in nature, and so late as twenty\r\nyears ago it seemed to be one of the most mysterious manifestations of\r\nall, which has been in great measure explained by the new discoveries.\r\nAlready, at the beginning of this century, we spoke of our \"age of\r\nelectricity,\" yet there were few things in nature about which we knew\r\nless. The \"electric current\" rang our bells, drove our trains, lit our\r\nrooms, but none knew what the current was. There was a vague idea that\r\nit was a sort of fluid that flowed along copper wires as water flows in\r\na pipe. We now suppose that it is _a rapid movement of electrons from\r\natom to atom_ in the wire or wherever the current is.\r\n\r\nLet us try to grasp the principle of the new view of electricity and see\r\nhow it applies to all the varied electrical phenomena in the world about\r\nus. As we saw, the nucleus of an atom of matter consists of positive\r\nelectricity which holds together a number of electrons, or charges of\r\nnegative electricity.[4] This certainly tells us to some extent what\r\nelectricity is, and how it is related to matter, but it leaves us with\r\nthe usual difficulty about fundamental realities. But we now know that\r\nelectricity, like matter, is atomic in structure; a charge of\r\nelectricity is made up of a number of small units or charges of a\r\ndefinite, constant amount. It has been suggested that the two kinds of\r\nelectricity, i.e. positive and negative, are right-handed and\r\nleft-handed vortices or whirlpools in ether, or rings in ether, but\r\nthere are very serious difficulties, and we leave this to the future.\r\n\r\n    [4] The words \"positive\" and \"negative\" electricity belong to the\r\n    days when it was regarded as a fluid. A body overcharged with the\r\n    fluid was called positive; an undercharged body was called negative.\r\n    A positively-electrified body is now one whose atoms have lost some\r\n    of their outlying electrons, so that the positive charge of\r\n    electricity predominates. The negatively-electrified body is one\r\n    with more than the normal number of electrons.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10\r\n\r\nWhat an Electric Current is\r\n\r\nThe discovery of these two kinds of electricity has, however, enabled us\r\nto understand very fairly what goes on in electrical phenomena. The\r\noutlying electrons, as we saw, may pass from atom to atom, and this, on\r\na large scale, is the meaning of the electric current. In other words,\r\nwe believe an electric current to be a flow of electrons. Let us take,\r\nto begin with, a simple electrical \"cell,\" in which a feeble current is\r\ngenerated: such a cell as there is in every house to serve its electric\r\nbells.\r\n\r\nIn the original form this simple sort of \"battery\" consisted of a plate\r\nof zinc and a plate of copper immersed in a chemical. Long before\r\nanything was known about electrons it was known that, if you put zinc\r\nand copper together, you produce a mild current of electricity. We know\r\nnow what this means. Zinc is a metal the atoms of which are particularly\r\ndisposed to part with some of their outlying electrons. Why, we do not\r\nknow; but the fact is the basis of these small batteries. Electrons from\r\nthe atoms of zinc pass to the atoms of copper, and their passage is a\r\n\"current.\" Each atom gives up an electron to its neighbour. It was\r\nfurther found long ago that if the zinc and copper were immersed in\r\ncertain chemicals, which slowly dissolve the zinc, and the two metals\r\nwere connected by a copper wire, the current was stronger. In modern\r\nlanguage, there is a brisker flow of electrons. The reason is that\r\nthe atoms of zinc which are stolen by the chemical leave their\r\ndetachable electrons behind them, and the zinc has therefore more\r\nelectrons to pass on to the copper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISINTEGRATION OF ATOMS\r\n\r\nAn atom of Uranium, by ejecting an Alpha particle, becomes Uranium X.\r\nThis substance, by ejecting Beta and Gamma rays, becomes Radium. Radium\r\npasses through a number of further changes, as shown in the diagram, and\r\nfinally becomes lead. Some radio-active substances disintegrate much\r\nfaster than others. Thus Uranium changes very slowly, taking\r\n5,000,000,000 years to reach the same stage of disintegration that\r\nRadium A reaches in 3 minutes. As the disintegration proceeds, the\r\nsubstances become of lighter and lighter atomic weights. Thus Uranium\r\nhas an atomic weight of 238, whereas lead has an atomic weight of only\r\n206. The breaking down of atoms is fully explained in the text.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Reproduced by permission from \"The Interpretation of\r\nRadium\" (John Murray)._\r\n\r\nSILK TASSEL ELECTRIFIED\r\n\r\nThe separate threads of the tassel, being each electrified with the same\r\nkind of electricity, repel one another, and thus the tassel branches out\r\nas in the photograph.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILK TASSEL DISCHARGED BY THE RAYS FROM RADIUM\r\n\r\nWhen the radium rays, carrying an opposite electric charge to that on\r\nthe tassel, strikes the threads, the threads are neutralised, and hence\r\nfall together again.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HUGE ELECTRIC SPARK\r\n\r\nThis is an actual photograph of an electric spark. It is leaping a\r\ndistance of about 10 feet, and is the discharge of a million volts. It\r\nis a graphic illustration of the tremendous energy of electrons.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From \"Scientific Ideas of To-day_.\"\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL ATTRACTION BETWEEN COMMON OBJECTS\r\n\r\nTake an ordinary flower-vase well dried and energetically rub it with a\r\nsilk handkerchief. The vase which thus becomes electrified will attract\r\nany light body, such as a feather, as shown in the above illustration.]\r\n\r\nSuch cells are now made of zinc and carbon, immersed in sal-ammoniac,\r\nbut the principle is the same. The flow of electricity is a flow of\r\nelectrons; though we ought to repeat that they do not flow in a body, as\r\nmolecules of water do. You may have seen boys place a row of bricks,\r\neach standing on one end, in such order that the first, if it is pushed,\r\nwill knock over the second, the second the third, and so on to the last.\r\nThere is a flow of _movement_ all along the line, but each brick moves\r\nonly a short distance. So an electron merely passes to the next atom,\r\nwhich sends on an electron to a third atom, and so on. In this case,\r\nhowever, the movement from atom to atom is so rapid that the ripple of\r\nmovement, if we may call it so, may pass along at an enormous speed. We\r\nhave seen how swiftly electrons travel.\r\n\r\nBut how is this turned into power enough even to ring a bell? The actual\r\nmechanical apparatus by which the energy of the electron current is\r\nturned into sound, or heat, or light will be described in a technical\r\nsection later in this work. We are concerned here only with the\r\nprinciple, which is clear. While zinc is very apt to part with\r\nelectrons, copper is just as obliging in facilitating their passage\r\nonward. Electrons will travel in this way in most metals, but copper is\r\none of the best \"conductors.\" So we lengthen the copper wire between the\r\nzinc and the carbon until it goes as far as the front door and the bell,\r\nwhich are included in the circuit. When you press the button at the\r\ndoor, two wires are brought together, and the current of electrons\r\nrushes round the circuit; and at the bell its energy is diverted into\r\nthe mechanical apparatus which rings the bell.\r\n\r\nCopper is a good conductor--six times as good as iron--and is therefore\r\nso common in electrical industries. Some other substances are just as\r\nstubborn as copper is yielding, and we call them \"insulators,\" because\r\nthey resist the current instead of letting it flow. Their atoms do not\r\neasily part with electrons. Glass, vulcanite, and porcelain are very\r\ngood insulators for this reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the Dynamo does\r\n\r\nBut even several cells together do not produce the currents needed in\r\nmodern industry, and the flow is produced in a different manner. As the\r\ninvisible electrons pass along a wire they produce what we call a\r\nmagnetic field around the wire, they produce a disturbance in the\r\nsurrounding ether. To be exact, it is through the ether surrounding the\r\nwire that the energy originated by the electrons is transmitted. To set\r\nelectrons moving on a large scale we use a \"dynamo.\" By means of the\r\ndynamo it is possible to transform mechanical energy into electrical\r\nenergy. The modern dynamo, as Professor Soddy puts it, may be looked\r\nupon as an electron pump. We cannot go into the subject deeply here, we\r\nwould only say that a large coil of copper wire is caused to turn round\r\nrapidly between the poles of a powerful magnet. That is the essential\r\nconstruction of the \"dynamo,\" which is used for generating strong\r\ncurrents. We shall see in a moment how magnetism differs from\r\nelectricity, and will say here only that round the poles of a large\r\nmagnet there is a field of intense disturbance which will start a flow\r\nof electrons in any copper that is introduced into it. On account of the\r\nspeed given to the coil of wire its atoms enter suddenly this magnetic\r\nfield, and they give off crowds of electrons in a flash.\r\n\r\nIt is found that a similar disturbance is caused, though the flow is in\r\nthe _opposite_ direction, when the coil of wire leaves the magnetic\r\nfield. And as the coil is revolving very rapidly we get a powerful\r\ncurrent of electricity that runs in alternate directions--an\r\n\"alternating\" current. Electricians have apparatus for converting it\r\ninto a continuous current where this is necessary.\r\n\r\nA current, therefore, means a steady flow of the electrons from atom to\r\natom. Sometimes, however, a number of electrons rush violently and\r\nexplosively from one body to another, as in the electric spark or the\r\noccasional flash from an electric tram or train. The grandest and most\r\nspectacular display of this phenomenon is the thunderstorm. As we saw\r\nearlier, a portentous furnace like the sun is constantly pouring floods\r\nof electrons from its atoms into space. The earth intercepts great\r\nnumbers of these electrons. In the upper regions of the air the stream\r\nof solar electrons has the effect of separating positively-electrified\r\natoms from negatively-electrified ones, and the water-vapour, which is\r\nconstantly rising from the surface of the sea, gathers more freely round\r\nthe positively-electrified atoms, and brings them down, as rain, to the\r\nearth. Thus the upper air loses a proportion of positive electricity, or\r\nbecomes \"negatively electrified.\" In the thunderstorm we get both kinds\r\nof clouds--some with large excesses of electrons, and some deficient in\r\nelectrons--and the tension grows until at last it is relieved by a\r\nsudden and violent discharge of electrons from one cloud to another or\r\nto the earth--an electric spark on a prodigious scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11\r\n\r\nMagnetism\r\n\r\nWe have seen that an electric current is really a flow of electrons. Now\r\nan electric current exhibits a magnetic effect. The surrounding space is\r\nendowed with energy which we call electro-magnetic energy. A piece of\r\nmagnetised iron attracting other pieces of iron to it is the popular\r\nidea of a magnet. If we arrange a wire to pass vertically through a\r\npiece of cardboard and then sprinkle iron filings on the cardboard we\r\nshall find that, on passing an electric current through the wire, the\r\niron filings arrange themselves in circles round it. The magnetic force,\r\ndue to the electric current, seems to exist in circles round the wire,\r\nan ether disturbance being set up. Even a single electron, when in\r\nmovement, creates a magnetic \"field,\" as it is called, round its path.\r\nThere is no movement of electrons without this attendant field of\r\nenergy, and their motion is not stopped until that field of energy\r\ndisappears from the ether. The modern theory of magnetism supposes that\r\nall magnetism is produced in this way. All magnetism is supposed to\r\narise from the small whirling motions of the electrons contained in the\r\nultimate atoms of matter. We cannot here go into the details of the\r\ntheory nor explain why, for instance, iron behaves so differently from\r\nother substances, but it is sufficient to say that here, also, the\r\nelectron theory provides the key. This theory is not yet definitely\r\n_proved_, but it furnishes a sufficient theoretical basis for future\r\nresearch. The earth itself is a gigantic magnet, a fact which makes the\r\ncompass possible, and it is well known that the earth's magnetism is\r\naffected by those great outbreaks on the sun called sun-spots. Now it\r\nhas been recently shown that a sun-spot is a vast whirlpool of electrons\r\nand that it exerts a strong magnetic action. There is doubtless a\r\nconnection between these outbreaks of electronic activity and the\r\nconsequent changes in the earth's magnetism. The precise mechanism of\r\nthe connection, however, is still a matter that is being investigated.\r\n\r\n\r\nETHER AND WAVES\r\n\r\nEther and Waves\r\n\r\nThe whole material universe is supposed to be embedded in a vast medium\r\ncalled the ether. It is true that the notion of the ether has been\r\nabandoned by some modern physicists, but, whether or not it is\r\nultimately dispensed with, the conception of the ether has entered so\r\ndeeply into the scientific mind that the science of physics cannot be\r\nunderstood unless we know something about the properties attributed to\r\nthe ether. The ether was invented to explain the phenomena of light, and\r\nto account for the flow of energy across empty space. Light takes time\r\nto travel. We see the sun at any moment by the light that left it 8\r\nminutes before. It has taken that 8 minutes for the light from the\r\nsun to travel that 93,000,000 miles odd which separates it from our\r\nearth. Besides the fact that light takes time to travel, it can be shown\r\nthat light travels in the form of waves. We know that sound travels in\r\nwaves; sound consists of waves in the air, or water or wood or whatever\r\nmedium we hear it through. If an electric bell be put in a glass jar and\r\nthe air be pumped out of the jar, the sound of the bell becomes feebler\r\nand feebler until, when enough air has been taken out, we do not hear\r\nthe bell at all. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum. We continue to _see_\r\nthe bell, however, so that evidently light can travel in a vacuum. The\r\ninvisible medium through which the waves of light travel is the ether,\r\nand this ether permeates all space _and all matter_. Between us and the\r\nstars stretch vast regions empty of all matter. But we see the stars;\r\ntheir light reaches us, even though it may take centuries to do so. We\r\nconceive, then, that it is the universal ether which conveys that light.\r\nAll the energy which has reached the earth from the sun and which,\r\nstored for ages in our coal-fields, is now used to propel our trains and\r\nsteamships, to heat and light our cities, to perform all the\r\nmultifarious tasks of modern life, was conveyed by the ether. Without\r\nthat universal carrier of energy we should have nothing but a stagnant,\r\nlifeless world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Leadbeater._\r\n\r\nAN ELECTRIC SPARK\r\n\r\nAn electric spark consists of a rush of electrons across the space\r\nbetween the two terminals. A state of tension is established in the\r\nether by the electric charges, and when this tension passes a certain\r\nlimit the discharge takes place.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From \"Scientific Ideas of To-day.\"_\r\n\r\nAN ETHER DISTURBANCE AROUND AN ELECTRON CURRENT\r\n\r\nIn the left-hand photograph an electric current is passing through the\r\ncoil, thus producing a magnetic field and transforming the poker into a\r\nmagnet. The poker is then able to support a pair of scissors. As soon as\r\nthe electric current is broken off, as in the second photograph, the\r\nether disturbance ceases. The poker loses its magnetism, and the\r\nscissors fall.]\r\n\r\nWe have said that light consists of waves. The ether may be considered\r\nas resembling, in some respects, a jelly. It can transmit vibrations.\r\nThe waves of light are really excessively small ripples, measuring from\r\ncrest to crest. The distance from crest to crest of the ripples in a\r\npond is sometimes no more than an inch or two. This distance is\r\nenormously great compared to the longest of the wave-lengths that\r\nconstitute light. We say the longest, for the waves of light differ in\r\nlength; the colour depends upon the length of the light. Red light has\r\nthe longest waves and violet the shortest. The longest waves, the waves\r\nof deep-red light, are seven two hundred and fifty thousandths of an\r\ninch in length (7/250,000 inch). This is nearly twice the length of\r\ndeep-violet light-waves, which are 1/67,000 inch. But light-waves, the\r\nwaves that affect the eye, are not the only waves carried by the ether.\r\nWaves too short to affect the eye can affect the photographic plate, and\r\nwe can discover in this way the existence of waves only half the length\r\nof the deep-violet waves. Still shorter waves can be discovered, until\r\nwe come to those excessively minute rays, the X-rays.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow the Limits of Visibility\r\n\r\nBut we can extend our investigations in the other direction; we find\r\nthat the ether carries many waves longer than light-waves. Special\r\nphotographic emulsions can reveal the existence of waves five times\r\nlonger than violet-light waves. Extending below the limits of visibility\r\nare waves we detect as heat-waves. Radiant heat, like the heat from a\r\nfire, is also a form of wave-motion in the ether, but the waves our\r\nsenses recognise as heat are longer than light-waves. There are longer\r\nwaves still, but our senses do not recognise them. But we can detect\r\nthem by our instruments. These are the waves used in wireless\r\ntelegraphy, and their length may be, in some cases, measured in miles.\r\nThese waves are the so-called electro-magnetic waves. Light, radiant\r\nheat, and electro-magnetic waves are all of the same nature; they differ\r\nonly as regards their wave-lengths.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT--VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE\r\n\r\nIf Light, then, consists of waves transmitted through the ether, what\r\ngives rise to the waves? Whatever sets up such wonderfully rapid series\r\nof waves must be something with an enormous vibration. We come back to\r\nthe electron: all atoms of matter, as we have seen, are made up of\r\nelectrons revolving in a regular orbit round a nucleus. These electrons\r\nmay be affected by out-side influences, they may be agitated and their\r\nspeed or vibration increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectrons and Light\r\n\r\nThe particles even of a piece of cold iron are in a state of vibration.\r\nNo nerves of ours are able to feel and register the waves they emit, but\r\nyour cold poker is really radiating, or sending out a series of\r\nwave-movements, on every side. After what we saw about the nature of\r\nmatter, this will surprise none. Put your poker in the fire for a time.\r\nThe particles of the glowing coal, which are violently agitated,\r\ncommunicate some of their energy to the particles of iron in the poker.\r\nThey move to and fro more rapidly, and the waves which they create are\r\nnow able to affect your nerves and cause a sensation of heat. Put the\r\npoker again in the fire, until its temperature rises to 500° C. It\r\nbegins to glow with a dull red. Its particles are now moving very\r\nviolently, and the waves they send out are so short and rapid that they\r\ncan be picked up by the eye--we have _visible_ light. They would still\r\nnot affect a photographic plate. Heat the iron further, and the crowds\r\nof electrons now send out waves of various lengths which blend into\r\nwhite light. What is happening is the agitated electrons flying round in\r\ntheir orbits at a speed of trillions of times a second. Make the iron\r\n\"blue hot,\" and it pours out, in addition to light, the _invisible_\r\nwaves which alter the film on the photographic plate. And beyond these\r\nthere is a long range of still shorter waves, culminating in the X-rays,\r\nwhich will pass between the atoms of flesh or stone.\r\n\r\nNearly two hundred and fifty years ago it was proved that light\r\ntravelled at least 600,000 times faster than sound. Jupiter, as we saw,\r\nhas moons, which circle round it. They pass behind the body of the\r\nplanet, and reappear at the other side. But it was noticed that, when\r\nJupiter is at its greatest distance from us, the reappearance of the\r\nmoon from behind it is 16 minutes and 36 seconds later than when the\r\nplanet is nearest to us. Plainly this was because light took so long to\r\ncover the additional distance. The distance was then imperfectly known,\r\nand the speed of light was underrated. We now know the distance, and we\r\neasily get the velocity of light.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it seems far more wonderful to discover this within the walls\r\nof a laboratory, but it was done as long ago as 1850. A cogged wheel is\r\nso mounted that a ray of light passes between two of the teeth and is\r\nreflected back from a mirror. Now, slight as is the fraction of a second\r\nwhich light takes to travel that distance, it is possible to give such\r\nspeed to the wheel that the next tooth catches the ray of light on its\r\nreturn and cuts it off. The speed is increased still further until the\r\nray of light returns to the eye of the observer through the notch _next_\r\nto the one by which it had passed to the mirror! The speed of the wheel\r\nwas known, and it was thus possible again to gather the velocity of\r\nlight. If the shortest waves are 1/67,000 of an inch in length, and\r\nlight travels at 186,000 miles a second, any person can work out that\r\nabout 800 trillion waves enter the eye in a second when we see \"violet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSorting out Light-waves\r\n\r\nThe waves sent out on every side by the energetic electrons become\r\nfaintly visible to us when they reach about 1/35,000 of an inch. As they\r\nbecome shorter and more rapid, as the electrons increase their speed, we\r\nget, in succession, the colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue,\r\nindigo, and violet. Each distinct sensation of colour means a wave of\r\ndifferent length. When they are all mingled together, as in the light of\r\nthe sun, we get white light. When this white light passes through glass,\r\nthe speed of the waves is lessened; and, if the ray of light falls\r\nobliquely on a triangular piece of glass, the waves of different lengths\r\npart company as they travel through it, and the light is spread out in a\r\nband of rainbow-colour. The waves are sorted out according to their\r\nlengths in the \"obstacle race\" through the glass. Anyone may see this\r\nfor himself by holding up a wedge-shaped piece of crystal between the\r\nsunlight and the eye; the prism separates the sunlight into its\r\nconstituent colours, and these various colours will be seen quite\r\nreadily. Or the thing may be realised in another way. If the seven\r\ncolours are painted on a wheel as shown opposite page 280 (in the\r\nproportion shown), and the wheel rapidly revolved on a pivot, the wheel\r\nwill appear a dull white, the several colours will not be seen. But\r\n_omit_ one of the colours, then the wheel, when revolved, will not\r\nappear white, but will give the impression of one colour, corresponding\r\nto what the union of six colours gives. Another experiment will show\r\nthat some bodies held up between the eye and a white light will not\r\npermit all the rays to pass through, but will intercept some; a body\r\nthat intercepts all the seven rays except red will give the impression\r\nof red, or if all the rays except violet, then violet will be the colour\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: H. J. Shepstone._\r\n\r\nLIGHTNING\r\n\r\nIn a thunderstorm we have the most spectacular display in lightning of a\r\nviolent and explosive rush of electrons (electricity) from one body to\r\nanother, from cloud to cloud, or to the earth. In this wonderful\r\nphotograph of an electrical storm note the long branched and undulating\r\nflashes of lightning. Each flash lasts no longer than the one\r\nhundred-thousandth part of a second of time.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIGHT WAVES\r\n\r\nLight consists of waves transmitted through the ether. Waves of light\r\ndiffer in length. The colour of the light depends on the wave-length.\r\nDeep-red waves (the longest) are 7/250000 inch and deep-violet waves\r\n1/67000 inch. The diagram shows two wave-motions of different\r\nwave-lengths. From crest to crest, or from trough to trough, is the\r\nlength of the wave.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAGNETIC CIRCUIT OF AN ELECTRIC CURRENT\r\n\r\nThe electric current passing in the direction of the arrow round the\r\nelectric circuit generates in the surrounding space circular magnetic\r\ncircuits as shown in the diagram. It is this property which lies at the\r\nbase of the electro-magnet and of the electric dynamo.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MAGNET\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows the lines of force between two magnets. The lines\r\nof force proceed from the north pole of one magnet to the south pole of\r\nthe other. They also proceed from the north to the south poles of the\r\nsame magnet. These facts are shown clearly in the diagram. The north\r\npole of a magnet is that end of it which turns to the north when the\r\nmagnet is freely suspended.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fate of the World\r\n\r\nProfessor Soddy has given an interesting picture of what might happen\r\nwhen the sun's light and heat is no longer what it is. The human eye\r\n\"has adapted itself through the ages to the peculiarities of the sun's\r\nlight, so as to make the most of that wave-length of which there is\r\nmost.... Let us indulge for a moment in these gloomy prognostications,\r\nas to the consequences to this earth of the cooling of the sun with the\r\nlapse of ages, which used to be in vogue, but which radio-activity has\r\nso rudely shaken. Picture the fate of the world when the sun has become\r\na dull red-hot ball, or even when it has cooled so far that it would no\r\nlonger emit light to us. That does not all mean that the world would be\r\nin inky darkness, and that the sun would not emit light to the people\r\nthen inhabiting this world, if any had survived and could keep\r\nthemselves from freezing. To such, if the eye continued to adapt itself\r\nto the changing conditions, our blues and violets would be ultra-violet\r\nand invisible, but our dark heat would be light and hot bodies would be\r\nluminous to them which would be dark to us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 12\r\n\r\nWhat the Blue \"Sky\" means\r\n\r\nWe saw in a previous chapter how the spectroscope splits up light-waves\r\ninto their colours. But nature is constantly splitting the light into\r\nits different-lengthed waves, its colours. The rainbow, where dense\r\nmoisture in the air acts as a spectroscope, is the most familiar\r\nexample. A piece of mother-of-pearl, or even a film of oil on the street\r\nor on water, has the same effect, owing to the fine inequalities in its\r\nsurface. The atmosphere all day long is sorting out the waves. The blue\r\n\"sky\" overhead means that the fine particles in the upper atmosphere\r\ncatch the shorter waves, the blue waves, and scatter them. We can make a\r\ntubeful of blue sky in the laboratory at any time. The beautiful\r\npink-flush on the Alps at sunrise, the red glory that lingers in the\r\nwest at sunset, mean that, as the sun's rays must struggle through\r\ndenser masses of air when it is low on the horizon, the long red waves\r\nare sifted out from the other shafts.\r\n\r\nThen there is the varied face of nature which, by absorbing some waves\r\nand reflecting others, weaves its own beautiful robe of colour. Here and\r\nthere is a black patch, which _absorbs_ all the light. White surfaces\r\n_reflect_ the whole of it. What is reflected depends on the period of\r\nvibration of the electrons in the particular kind of matter. Generally,\r\nas the electrons receive the flood of trillions of waves, they absorb\r\neither the long or the medium or the short, and they give us the\r\nwonderful colour-scheme of nature. In some cases the electrons continue\r\nto radiate long after the sunlight has ceased to fall upon them. We get\r\nfrom them \"black\" or invisible light, and we can take photographs by it.\r\nOther bodies, like glass, vibrate in unison with the period of the\r\nlight-waves and let them stream through.\r\n\r\n\r\nLight without Heat\r\n\r\nThere are substances--\"phosphorescent\" things we call them--which give\r\nout a mysterious cold light of their own. It is one of the problems\r\nof science, and one of profound practical interest. If we could produce\r\nlight without heat our \"gas bill\" would shrink amazingly. So much energy\r\nis wasted in the production of heat-waves and ultra-violet waves which\r\nwe do not want, that 90 per cent. or more of the power used in\r\nillumination is wasted. Would that the glow-worm, or even the dead\r\nherring, would yield us its secret! Phosphorus is the one thing we know\r\nas yet that suits the purpose, and--it smells! Indeed, our artificial\r\nlight is not only extravagant in cost, but often poor in colour. The\r\nunwary person often buys a garment by artificial light, and is disgusted\r\nnext morning to find in it a colour which is not wanted. The colour\r\ndisclosed by the sun was not in the waves of the artificial light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROTATING DISC OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON FOR MIXING COLOURS\r\n\r\nThe Spectroscope sorts out the above seven colours from sunlight (which\r\nis compounded of these seven colours). If painted in proper proportions\r\non a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel be\r\nturned rapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be\r\nperceived. If one colour be omitted, the result will be one colour--the\r\nresult of the union of the remaining six.]\r\n\r\nBeyond the waves of violet light are the still shorter and more rapid\r\nwaves--the \"ultra-violet\" waves--which are precious to the photographer.\r\nAs every amateur knows, his plate may safely be exposed to light that\r\ncomes through a red or an orange screen. Such a screen means \"no\r\nthoroughfare\" for the blue and \"beyond-blue\" waves, and it is these\r\nwhich arrange the little grains of silver on the plate. It is the same\r\nwaves which supply the energy to the little green grains of matter\r\n(chlorophyll) in the plant, preparing our food and timber for us, as\r\nwill be seen later. The tree struggles upward and spreads out its leaves\r\nfanwise to the blue sky to receive them. In our coal-measures, the\r\nmighty dead forests of long ago, are vast stores of sunlight which we\r\nare prodigally using up.\r\n\r\nThe X-rays are the extreme end, the highest octave, of the series of\r\nwaves. Their power of penetration implies that they are excessively\r\nminute, but even these have not held their secret from the modern\r\nphysicist. From a series of beautiful experiments, in which they were\r\nmade to pass amongst the atoms of a crystal, we learned their length. It\r\nis about the ten-millionth of a millimetre, and a millimetre is about\r\nthe 1/25 of an inch!\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent discoveries, made during a recent eclipse of the\r\nsun, is that light is subject to gravitation. A ray of light from a star\r\nis bent out of its straight path when it passes near the mass of the\r\nsun. Professor Eddington tells us that we have as much right to speak of\r\na pound of light as of a pound of sugar. Professor Eddington even\r\ncalculates that the earth receives 160 tons of light from the sun every\r\nyear!\r\n\r\n\r\nENERGY: HOW ALL LIFE DEPENDS ON IT\r\n\r\nAs we have seen in an earlier chapter, one of the fundamental entities\r\nof the universe is matter. A second, not less important, is called\r\nenergy. Energy is indispensable if the world is to continue to exist,\r\nsince all phenomena, including life, depend on it. Just as it is humanly\r\nimpossible to create or to destroy a particle of matter, so is it\r\nimpossible to create or to destroy energy. This statement will be more\r\nreadily understood when we have considered what energy is.\r\n\r\nEnergy, like matter, is indestructible, and just as matter exists in\r\nvarious forms so does energy. And we may add, just as we are ignorant of\r\nwhat the negative and positive particles of electricity which constitute\r\nmatter really are, so we are ignorant of the true nature of energy. At\r\nthe same time, energy is not so completely mysterious as it once was. It\r\nis another of nature's mysteries which the advance of modern science has\r\nin some measure unveiled. It was only during the nineteenth century that\r\nenergy came to be known as something as distinct and permanent as matter\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\nForms of Energy\r\n\r\nThe existence of various forms of energy had been known, of course, for\r\nages; there was the energy of a falling stone, the energy produced by\r\nburning wood or coal or any other substance, but the essential\r\n_identity_ of all these forms of energy had not been suspected. The\r\nconception of energy as something which, like matter, was constant in\r\namount, which could not be created nor destroyed, was one of the great\r\nscientific acquisitions of the past century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAVE SHAPES\r\n\r\nWave-motions are often complex. The above illustration shows some fairly\r\ncomplicated wave shapes. All such wave-motions can be produced by\r\nsuperposing a number of simple wave forms.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POWER OF A MAGNET\r\n\r\nThe illustration is that of a \"Phoenix\" electric magnet lifting scrap\r\nfrom railway trucks. The magnet is 52 inches in diameter and lifts a\r\nweight of 26 tons. The same type of magnet, 62 inches in diameter, lifts\r\na weight of 40 tons.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: The Locomotive Publishing Co., Ltd._\r\n\r\nTHE SPEED OF LIGHT\r\n\r\nA train travelling at the rate of sixty miles per hour would take rather\r\nmore than seventeen and a quarter days to go round the earth at the\r\nequator, i.e. a distance of 25,000 miles. Light, which travels at the\r\nrate of 186,000 miles per second, would take between one-seventh and\r\none-eighth of a second to go the same distance.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROTATING DISC OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON FOR MIXING COLOURS\r\n\r\nThe Spectroscope sorts out the above seven colours from sunlight (which\r\nis compounded of these seven colours). If painted in proper proportions\r\non a wheel, as shown in the coloured illustration, and the wheel turned\r\nrapidly on a pivot through its centre, only a dull white will be\r\nperceived. If one colour be omitted, the result will be one colour--the\r\nresult of the union of the remaining six.]\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to enter deeply into this subject here. It is\r\nsufficient if we briefly outline its salient aspects. Energy is\r\nrecognised in two forms, kinetic and potential. The form of energy which\r\nis most apparent to us is the _energy of motion_; for example, a rolling\r\nstone, running water, a falling body, and so on. We call the energy of\r\nmotion _kinetic energy_. Potential energy is the energy a body has in\r\nvirtue of its position--it is its capacity, in other words, to acquire\r\nkinetic energy, as in the case of a stone resting on the edge of a\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\nEnergy may assume different forms; one kind of energy may be converted\r\ndirectly or indirectly into some other form. The energy of burning coal,\r\nfor example, is converted into heat, and from heat energy we have\r\nmechanical energy, such as that manifested by the steam-engine. In this\r\nway we can transfer energy from one body to another. There is the energy\r\nof the great waterfalls of Niagara, for instance, which are used to\r\nsupply the energy of huge electric power stations.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Heat is\r\n\r\nAn important fact about energy is, that all energy _tends to take the\r\nform of heat energy_. The impact of a falling stone generates heat; a\r\nwaterfall is hotter at the bottom than at the top--the falling particles\r\nof water, on striking the ground, generate heat; and most chemical\r\nchanges are attended by heat changes. Energy may remain latent\r\nindefinitely in a lump of wood, but in combustion it is liberated, and\r\nwe have heat as a result. The atom of radium or of any other\r\nradio-active substance, as it disintegrates, generates heat. \"Every hour\r\nradium generates sufficient heat to raise the temperature of its own\r\nweight of water, from the freezing point to the boiling point.\" And what\r\nis heat? _Heat is molecular motion._ The molecules of every substance,\r\nas we have seen on a previous page, are in a state of continual motion,\r\nand the more vigorous the motion the hotter the body. As wood or coal\r\nburns, the invisible molecules of these substances are violently\r\nagitated, and give rise to ether waves which our senses interpret as\r\nlight and heat. In this constant movement of the molecules, then, we\r\nhave a manifestation of the energy of motion and of heat.\r\n\r\nThat energy which disappears in one form reappears in another has been\r\nfound to be universally true. It was Joule who, by churning water, first\r\nshowed that a measurable quantity of mechanical energy could be\r\ntransformed into a measurable quantity of heat energy. By causing an\r\napparatus to stir water vigorously, that apparatus being driven by\r\nfalling weights or a rotating flywheel or by any other mechanical means,\r\nthe water became heated. A certain amount of mechanical energy had been\r\nused up and a certain amount of heat had appeared. The relation between\r\nthese two things was found to be invariable. Every physical change in\r\nnature involves a transformation of energy, but the total quantity of\r\nenergy in the universe remains unaltered. This is the great doctrine of\r\nthe Conservation of Energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 13\r\n\r\nSubstitutes for Coal\r\n\r\nConsider the source of nearly all the energy which is used in modern\r\ncivilisation--coal. The great forests of the Carboniferous epoch now\r\nexists as beds of coal. By the burning of coal--a chemical\r\ntransformation--the heat energy is produced on which at present our\r\nwhole civilisation depends. Whence is the energy locked up in the coal\r\nderived? From the sun. For millions of years the energy of the sun's\r\nrays had gone to form the vast vegetation of the Carboniferous era and\r\nhad been transformed, by various subtle processes, into the potential\r\nenergy that slumbers in those immense fossilized forests.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustion of our coal deposits would mean, so far as our knowledge\r\nextends at present, the end of the world's civilisation. There are other\r\nknown sources of energy, it is true. There is the energy of falling\r\nwater; the great falls of Niagara are used to supply the energy of huge\r\nelectric power stations. Perhaps, also, something could be done to\r\nutilise the energy of the tides--another instance of the energy of\r\nmoving water. And attempts have been made to utilise directly the energy\r\nof the sun's rays. But all these sources of energy are small compared\r\nwith the energy of coal. A suggestion was made at a recent British\r\nAssociation meeting that deep borings might be sunk in order to utilise\r\nthe internal heat of the earth, but this is not, perhaps, a very\r\npractical proposal. By far the most effective substitutes for coal would\r\nbe found in the interior energy of the atom, a source of energy which,\r\nas we have seen, is practically illimitable. If the immense electrical\r\nenergy in the interior of the atom can ever be liberated and controlled,\r\nthen our steadily decreasing coal supply will no longer be the bugbear\r\nit now is to all thoughtful men.\r\n\r\nThe stored-up energy of the great coal-fields can be used up, but we\r\ncannot replace it or create fresh supplies. As we have seen, energy\r\ncannot be destroyed, but it can become _unavailable_. Let us consider\r\nwhat this important fact means.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 14\r\n\r\nDissipation of Energy\r\n\r\nEnergy may become dissipated. Where does it go? since if it is\r\nindestructible it must still exist. It is easier to ask the question\r\nthan to give a final answer, and it is not possible in this OUTLINE,\r\nwhere an advanced knowledge of physics is not assumed on the part of the\r\nreader, to go fully into the somewhat difficult theories put forward by\r\nphysicists and chemists. We may raise the temperature, say, of iron,\r\nuntil it is white-hot. If we stop the process the temperature of the\r\niron will gradually settle down to the temperature of surrounding\r\nbodies. As it does so, where does its previous energy go? In some\r\nmeasure it may pass to other bodies in contact with the piece of iron,\r\nbut ultimately the heat becomes radiated away in space where we cannot\r\nfollow it. It has been added to the vast reservoir of _unavailable_ heat\r\nenergy of uniform temperature. It is sufficient here to say that if all\r\nbodies had a uniform temperature we should experience no such thing as\r\nheat, because heat only travels from one body to another, having the\r\neffect of cooling the one and warming the other. In time the two bodies\r\nacquire the same temperature. The sum-total of the heat in any body is\r\nmeasured in terms of the kinetic energy of its moving molecules.\r\n\r\nThere must come a time, so far as we can see at present, when, even if\r\nall the heat energy of the universe is not radiated away into empty\r\ninfinite space, yet a uniform temperature will prevail. If one body is\r\nhotter than another it radiates heat to that body until both are at the\r\nsame temperature. Each body may still possess a considerable quantity of\r\nheat energy, which it has absorbed, but that energy, so far as reactions\r\nbetween those two bodies are concerned, _is now unavailable_. The same\r\nprinciple applies whatever number of bodies we consider. Before heat\r\nenergy can be utilised we must have bodies with different temperature.\r\nIf the whole universe were at some uniform temperature, then, although\r\nit might possess an enormous amount of heat energy, this energy would be\r\nunavailable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a Uniform Temperature would mean\r\n\r\nAnd what does this imply? It implies a great deal: for if all the energy\r\nin the world became unavailable, the universe, as it now is, would cease\r\nto be. It is possible that, by the constant interchange of heat\r\nradiations, the whole universe is tending to some uniform temperature,\r\nin which case, although all molecular motion would not have ceased, it\r\nwould have become unavailable. In this sense it may be said that the\r\nuniverse is running down.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NIAGARA FALLS\r\n\r\nThe energy of this falling water is prodigious. It is used to generate\r\nthousands of horse-power in great electrical installations. The power is\r\nused to drive electric trams in cities 150 to 250 miles away.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Stephen Cribb._\r\n\r\nTRANSFORMATION OF ENERGY\r\n\r\nAn illustration of Energy. The chemical energy brought into existence by\r\nfiring the explosive manifesting itself as mechanical energy, sufficient\r\nto impart violent motion to tons of water.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: Underwood & Underwood._\r\n\r\n\"BOILING\" A KETTLE ON ICE\r\n\r\nWhen a kettle containing liquid air is placed on ice it \"boils\" because\r\nthe ice is intensely hot _when compared with the very low temperature of\r\nthe liquid air_.]\r\n\r\nIf all the molecules of a substance were brought to a standstill, that\r\nsubstance would be at the absolute zero of temperature. There could be\r\nnothing colder. The temperature at which all molecular motions would\r\ncease is known: it is -273° C. No body could possibly attain a lower\r\ntemperature than this: a lower temperature could not exist. Unless there\r\nexists in nature some process, of which we know nothing at present,\r\nwhereby energy is renewed, our solar system must one day sink to this\r\nabsolute zero of temperature. The sun, the earth, and every other body\r\nin the universe is steadily radiating heat, and this radiation cannot go\r\non for ever, because heat continually tends to diffuse and to equalise\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\nBut we can see, theoretically, that there is a way of evading this law.\r\nIf the chaotic molecular motions which constitute heat could be\r\n_regulated_, then the heat energy of a body could be utilised directly.\r\nSome authorities think that some of the processes which go on in the\r\nliving body do not involve any waste energy, that the chemical energy of\r\nfood is transformed directly into work without any of it being\r\ndissipated as useless heat energy. It may be, therefore, that man will\r\nfinally discover some way of escape from the natural law that, while\r\nenergy cannot be destroyed, it has a tendency to become unavailable.\r\n\r\nThe primary reservoir of energy is the atom; it is the energy of the\r\natom, the atom of elements in the sun, the stars, the earth, from which\r\nnature draws for all her supply of energy. Shall we ever discover how we\r\ncan replenish the dwindling resources of energy, or find out how we can\r\ncall into being the at present unavailable energy which is stored up in\r\nuniform temperature?\r\n\r\n    It looks as if our successors would witness an interesting race,\r\n    between the progress of science on the one hand and the depletion of\r\n    natural resources upon the other. The natural rate of flow of energy\r\n    from its primary atomic reservoirs to the sea of waste heat energy\r\n    of uniform temperature, allows life to proceed at a complete pace\r\n    sternly regulated by the inexorable laws of supply and demand,\r\n    which the biologists have recognised in their field as the struggle\r\n    for existence.[5]\r\n\r\n    [5] _Matter and Energy_, by Professor Soddy.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that energy is an actual entity just as much as matter,\r\nand that it cannot be created or destroyed. Matter and ether are\r\nreceptacles or vehicles of energy. As we have said, what these entities\r\nreally are in themselves we do not know. It may be that all forms of\r\nenergy are in some fundamental way aspects of the same primary entity\r\nwhich constitutes matter: how all matter is constituted of particles of\r\nelectricity we have already seen. The question to which we await an\r\nanswer is: What is electricity?\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 15\r\n\r\nMATTER, ETHER, AND EINSTEIN\r\n\r\nThe supreme synthesis, the crown of all this progressive conquest of\r\nnature, would be to discover that the particles of positive and negative\r\nelectricity, which make up the atoms of matter, are points or centres of\r\ndisturbances of some kind in a universal ether, and that all our\r\n\"energies\" (light, magnetism, gravitation, etc.) are waves or strains of\r\nsome kind set up in the ether by these clusters of electrons.\r\n\r\nIt is a fascinating, tantalising dream. Larmor suggested in 1900 that\r\nthe electron is a tiny whirlpool, or \"vortex,\" in ether; and, as such a\r\nvortex may turn in either of two opposite ways, we seem to see a\r\npossibility of explaining positive and negative electricity. But the\r\ndifficulties have proved very serious, and the nature of the electron is\r\nunknown. A recent view is that it is \"a ring of negative electricity\r\nrotating about its axis at a high speed,\" though that does not carry us\r\nvery far. The unit of positive electricity is even less known. We must\r\nbe content to know the general lines on which thought is moving toward\r\nthe final unification.\r\n\r\nWe say \"unification,\" but it would be a grave error to think that ether\r\nis the only possible basis for such unity, or to make it an essential\r\npart of one's philosophy of the universe. Ether was never more than an\r\nimagined entity to which we ascribed the most extraordinary properties,\r\nand which seemed then to promise considerable aid. It was conceived as\r\nan elastic solid of very great density, stretching from end to end of\r\nthe universe, transmitting waves from star to star at the rate of\r\n186,000 miles a second; yet it was believed that the most solid matter\r\npassed through it as if it did not exist.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a delicate experiment was tried for the purpose of\r\ndetecting the ether. Since the earth, in travelling round the sun, must\r\nmove through the ether if the ether exists, there ought to be a stream\r\nof ether flowing through every laboratory; just as the motion of a ship\r\nthrough a still atmosphere will make \"a wind.\" In 1887 Michelson and\r\nMorley tried to detect this. Theoretically, a ray of light in the\r\ndirection of the stream ought to travel at a different rate from a ray\r\nof light against the stream or across it. They found no difference, and\r\nscores of other experiments have failed. This does not prove that there\r\nis no ether, as there is reason to suppose that our instruments would\r\nappear to shrink in precisely the same proportion as the alteration of\r\nthe light; but the fact remains that we have no proof of the existence\r\nof ether. J. H. Jeans says that \"nature acts as if no such thing\r\nexisted.\" Even the phenomena of light and magnetism, he says, do not\r\nimply ether; and he thinks that the hypothesis may be abandoned. The\r\nprimary reason, of course, for giving up the notion of the ether is\r\nthat, as Einstein has shown, there is no way of detecting its existence.\r\nIf there is an ether, then, since the earth is moving through it, there\r\nshould be some way of detecting this motion. The experiment has been\r\ntried, as we have said, but, although the method used was very\r\nsensitive, no motion was discovered. It is Einstein who, by\r\nrevolutionising our conceptions of space and time, showed that no such\r\nmotion ever could be discovered, whatever means were employed, and that\r\nthe usual notion of the ether must be abandoned. We shall explain this\r\ntheory more fully in a later section.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE TIDES: ORIGIN OF THE MOON: THE EARTH SLOWING DOWN\r\n\r\n§ 16\r\n\r\nUntil comparatively recent times, until, in fact, the full dawn of\r\nmodern science, the tides ranked amongst the greatest of nature's\r\nmysteries. And, indeed, what agency could be invoked to explain this\r\nmysteriously regular flux and reflux of the waters of the ocean? It is\r\nnot surprising that that steady, rhythmical rise and fall suggested to\r\nsome imaginative minds the breathing of a mighty animal. And even when\r\nman first became aware of the fact that this regular movement was\r\nsomehow associated with the moon, was he much nearer an explanation?\r\nWhat bond could exist between the movements of that distant world and\r\nthe diurnal variation of the waters of the earth? It is reported that an\r\nancient astronomer, despairing of ever resolving the mystery, drowned\r\nhimself in the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Earth Pulled by the Moon\r\n\r\nBut it was part of the merit of Newton's mighty theory of gravitation\r\nthat it furnished an explanation even of this age-old mystery. We can\r\nsee, in broad outlines at any rate, that the theory of universal\r\nattraction can be applied to this case. For the moon, Newton taught us,\r\npulls every particle of matter throughout the earth. If we imagine that\r\npart of the earth's surface which comprises the Pacific Ocean, for\r\ninstance, to be turned towards the moon, we see that the moon's pull,\r\n_acting on the loose and mobile water_, would tend to heap it up into a\r\nsort of mound. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the water\r\nis more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth, although small\r\ntides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. It can be shown also\r\nthat a corresponding hump would tend to be produced on the other side of\r\nthe earth, owing, in this case, to the tendency of the water, being more\r\nloosely connected, to lag behind the solid earth. If the earth's surface\r\nwere entirely fluid the rotation of the earth would give the impression\r\nthat these two humps were continually travelling round the world, once\r\nevery day. At any given part of the earth's surface, therefore, there\r\nwould be two humps daily, i.e. two periods of high water. Such is the\r\nsimplest possible outline of the gravitational theory of the tides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CAUSE OF TIDES\r\n\r\nThe tides of the sea are due to the pull of the moon, and, in lesser\r\ndegree, of the sun. The whole earth is pulled by the moon, but the loose\r\nand mobile water is more free to obey this pull than is the solid earth,\r\nalthough small tides are also caused in the earth's solid crust. The\r\neffect which the tides have on slowing down the rotation of the earth is\r\nexplained in the text.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: G. Brocklehurst._\r\n\r\nTHE AEGIR ON THE TRENT\r\n\r\nAn exceptionally smooth formation due to perfect weather conditions. The\r\nwall-like formation of these tidal waves (see next page also) will be\r\nnoticed. The reason for this is that the downward current in the river\r\nheads the sea-water back, and thus helps to exaggerate the advancing\r\nslope of the wave. The exceptional spring tides are caused by the\r\ncombined operation of the moon and the sun, as is explained in the\r\ntext.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo: G. Brocklehurst._\r\n\r\nA BIG SPRING TIDE, THE AEGIR ON THE TRENT]\r\n\r\nThe actually observed phenomena are vastly more complicated, and the\r\ncomplete theory bears very little resemblance to the simple form we have\r\njust outlined. Everyone who lives in the neighbourhood of a port knows,\r\nfor instance, that high water seldom coincides with the time when the\r\nmoon crosses the meridian. It may be several hours early or late. High\r\nwater at London Bridge, for instance, occurs about one and a half hours\r\nafter the moon has passed the meridian, while at Dublin high water\r\noccurs about one and a half hours before the moon crosses the meridian.\r\nThe actually observed phenomena, then, are far from simple; they have,\r\nnevertheless, been very completely worked out, and the times of high\r\nwater for every port in the world can now be prophesied for a\r\nconsiderable time ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Action of Sun and Moon\r\n\r\nIt would be beyond our scope to attempt to explain the complete theory,\r\nbut we may mention one obvious factor which must be taken into account.\r\nSince the moon, by its gravitational attraction, produces tides, we\r\nshould expect that the sun, whose gravitational attraction is so much\r\nstronger, should also produce tides and, we would suppose at first\r\nsight, more powerful tides than the moon. But while it is true that the\r\nsun produces tides, it is not true that they are more powerful than\r\nthose produced by the moon. The sun's tide-producing power is, as a\r\nmatter of fact, less than half that of the moon. The reason of this is\r\nthat _distance_ plays an enormous rôle in the production of tides. The\r\nmass of the sun is 26,000,000 times that of the moon; on the other hand\r\nit is 386 times as far off as the moon. This greater distance more than\r\ncounterbalances its greater mass, and the result, as we have said, is\r\nthat the moon is more than twice as powerful. Sometimes the sun and moon\r\nact together, and we have what are called spring tides; sometimes they\r\nact against one another, and we have neap tides. These effects are\r\nfurther complicated by a number of other factors, and the tides, at\r\nvarious places, vary enormously. Thus at St. Helena the sea rises and\r\nfalls about three feet, whereas in the Bay of Fundy it rises and falls\r\nmore than fifty feet. But here, again, the reasons are complicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 17\r\n\r\nOrigin of the Moon\r\n\r\nBut there is another aspect of the tides which is of vastly greater\r\ninterest and importance than the theory we have just been discussing. In\r\nthe hands of Sir George H. Darwin, the son of Charles Darwin, the tides\r\nhad been made to throw light on the evolution of our solar system. In\r\nparticular, they have illustrated the origin and development of the\r\nsystem formed by our earth and moon. It is quite certain that, long ages\r\nago, the earth was rotating immensely faster than it is now, and that\r\nthe moon was so near as to be actually in contact with the earth. In\r\nthat remote age the moon was just on the point of separating from the\r\nearth, of being thrown off by the earth. Earth and moon were once one\r\nbody, but the high rate of rotation caused this body to split up into\r\ntwo pieces; one piece became the earth we now know, and the other became\r\nthe moon. Such is the conclusion to which we are led by an examination\r\nof the tides. In the first place let us consider the energy produced by\r\nthe tides. We see evidences of this energy all round the word's\r\ncoastlines. Estuaries are scooped out, great rocks are gradually reduced\r\nto rubble, innumerable tons of matter are continually being set in\r\nmovement. Whence is this energy derived? Energy, like matter, cannot be\r\ncreated from nothing; what, then, is the source which makes this\r\ncolossal expenditure possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Earth Slowing down\r\n\r\nThe answer is simple, but startling. _The source of tidal energy is the\r\nrotation of the earth._ The massive bulk of the earth, turning every\r\ntwenty-four hours on its axis, is like a gigantic flywheel. In virtue of\r\nits rotation it possesses an enormous store of energy. But even the\r\nheaviest and swiftest flywheel, if it is doing work, or even if it is\r\nonly working against the friction of its bearings, cannot dispense\r\nenergy for ever. It must, gradually, slow down. There is no escape from\r\nthis reasoning. It is the rotation of the earth which supplies the\r\nenergy of the tides, and, as a consequence, the tides must be slowing\r\ndown the earth. The tides act as a kind of brake on the earth's\r\nrotation. These masses of water, _held back by the moon_, exert a kind\r\nof dragging effect on the rotating earth. Doubtless this effect,\r\nmeasured by our ordinary standards, is very small; it is, however,\r\ncontinuous, and in the course of the millions of years dealt with in\r\nastronomy, this small but constant effect may produce very considerable\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nBut there is another effect which can be shown to be a necessary\r\nmathematical consequence of tidal action. It is the moon's action on the\r\nearth which produces the tides, but they also react on the moon. The\r\ntides are slowing down the earth, and they are also driving the moon\r\nfarther and farther away. This result, strange as it may seem, does not\r\npermit of doubt, for it is the result of an indubitable dynamical\r\nprinciple, which cannot be made clear without a mathematical discussion.\r\nSome interesting consequences follow.\r\n\r\nSince the earth is slowing down, it follows that it was once rotating\r\nfaster. There was a period, a long time ago, when the day comprised only\r\ntwenty hours. Going farther back still we come to a day of ten hours,\r\nuntil, inconceivable ages ago, the earth must have been rotating on its\r\naxis in a period of from three to four hours.\r\n\r\nAt this point let us stop and inquire what was happening to the moon. We\r\nhave seen that at present the moon is getting farther and farther away.\r\nIt follows, therefore, that when the day was shorter the moon was\r\nnearer. As we go farther back in time we find the moon nearer and nearer\r\nto an earth rotating faster and faster. When we reach the period we have\r\nalready mentioned, the period when the earth completed a revolution in\r\nthree or four hours, we find that the moon was so near as to be almost\r\ngrazing the earth. This fact is very remarkable. Everybody knows that\r\nthere is a _critical velocity_ for a rotating flywheel, a velocity\r\nbeyond which the flywheel would fly into pieces because the centrifugal\r\nforce developed is so great as to overcome the cohesion of the molecules\r\nof the flywheel. We have already likened our earth to a flywheel, and we\r\nhave traced its history back to the point where it was rotating with\r\nimmense velocity. We have also seen that, at that moment, the moon was\r\nbarely separated from the earth. The conclusion is irresistible. In an\r\nage more remote the earth _did_ fly in pieces, and one of those pieces\r\nis the moon. Such, in brief outline, is the tidal theory of the origin\r\nof the earth-moon system.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Day Becoming Longer\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, when the moon split off from the earth, it obviously\r\nmust have shared the earth's rotation. It flew round the earth in the\r\nsame time that the earth rotated, that is to say, the month and the day\r\nwere of equal length. As the moon began to get farther from the earth,\r\nthe month, because the moon took longer to rotate round the earth, began\r\nto get correspondingly longer. The day also became longer, because the\r\nearth was slowing down, taking longer to rotate on its axis, but the\r\nmonth increased at a greater rate than the day. Presently the month\r\nbecame equal to two days, then to three, and so on. It has been\r\ncalculated that this process went on until there were twenty-nine days\r\nin the month. After that the number of days in the month began to\r\ndecrease until it reached its present value or magnitude, and will\r\ncontinue to decrease until once more the month and the day are equal. In\r\nthat age the earth will be rotating very slowly. The braking action of\r\nthe tides will cause the earth always to keep the same face to the moon;\r\nit will rotate on its axis in the same time that the moon turns round\r\nthe earth. If nothing but the earth and moon were involved this state of\r\naffairs would be final. But there is also the effect of the solar tides\r\nto be considered. The moon makes the day equal to the month, but the sun\r\nhas a tendency, by still further slowing down the earth's rotation on\r\nits axis, to make the day equal to the year. It would do this, of\r\ncourse, by making the earth take as long to turn on its axis as to go\r\nround the sun. It cannot succeed in this, owing to the action of the\r\nmoon, but it can succeed in making the day rather longer than the month.\r\n\r\nSurprising as it may seem, we already have an illustration of this\r\npossibility in the satellites of Mars. The Martian day is about one\r\nhalf-hour longer than ours, but when the two minute satellites of Mars\r\nwere discovered it was noticed that the inner one of the two revolved\r\nround Mars in about seven hours forty minutes. In one Martian day,\r\ntherefore, one of the moons of Mars makes more than three complete\r\nrevolutions round that planet, so that, to an inhabitant of Mars, there\r\nwould be more than three months in a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n ARRHENIUS, SVANTE, _Worlds in the Making_.\r\n CLERK-MAXWELL, JAMES, _Matter and Motion_.\r\n DANIELL, ALFRED, _A Text-Book of the Principles of Physics_.\r\n DARWIN, SIR G.
