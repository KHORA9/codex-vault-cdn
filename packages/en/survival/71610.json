And if the telling of\r\nit take more than one paper, be not surprised, for after an hundred and\r\nthirty years of the Republic—and a thousand of progress—this man stands\r\none in the great trilogy—Washington, Jackson and Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe others have been mostly figureheads with the usual sprinkling of\r\nfools.\r\n\r\nTo know a man we must first know the dirt he digs into. To grasp his\r\ncharacter, the secret influences of his life, we must see the trees that\r\ngrew above him, the flowers at his feet, the pictures God made for him,\r\nin hill and river, in the storm cloud, in the thunder shaking his fields\r\nat night, in the grass and grain which came, the fruit of his hand.\r\n\r\nFor these go into the man.\r\n\r\nWhen we shall have seen the Hermitage and the breadth of its fields and\r\nhills we shall begin to understand the broadness of the man, for a man’s\r\nhome is the effect of the cause of that which is in him.\r\n\r\nWhen we shall have seen this country he lived and died in, so bountifully\r\nendowed, lying between the Cumberland and the Stone, fit for a king to\r\nfight for, we shall understand why Jackson loved it, fought for it—why\r\npatriotism burned as a religion in his soul.\r\n\r\nTo him it was the Union—of the home he killed Dickinson for, that he\r\nmight live there untouched by slander; of the country he killed the\r\nBritish for, that it might be the great republic of all ages. And so,\r\nwhen John C. Calhoun shouted nullification he might as well have nailed a\r\nred flag to the horn of the bull of the valley.\r\n\r\nWhen we shall have seen the simplicity of his home, the rugged, brave\r\npurity of his mind, as shown in everything around him, from the wall\r\npaper in his halls, telling the story of Ulysses and Telemachus, to the\r\nfew really great books he owned and loved, we can form some idea of the\r\nman who, in an age of strong speech and strong passions and free whiskey\r\nand free fights, loved only one woman, was pure in a day of impurity,\r\nwas brave in a day of bluster, was far-sighted in a wilderness, and a\r\ngentleman of his word always and all the time.\r\n\r\nSeeing it all here and knowing it, we may understand the very religion\r\nof holiness in the eye that could take such deliberate aim down the\r\npistol barrel that put out of business the head of the set of political\r\nopponents, who, for a chance to kill him, ruthlessly touched the only raw\r\nspot Fate’s finger had blistered in the mould of his life.\r\n\r\nAnd he killed them—those who would destroy his home—as religiously as he\r\ndid those who would destroy his country—that long, red, quadruple-massed\r\nline of British bullies, foul-mouthed and flame-touched, marching on the\r\nSouth shouting: “Beauty and booty.”\r\n\r\nNo life story of this man has been truly told, because the Thackerays do\r\nnot write biographies; and the men who write the hard things of history,\r\nby a strange rule of their craft’s ethics, seem to think it womanly to\r\nwrite of the sweeter things of the soul. And so the lives of Jackson have\r\nall been, more or less, partisan political histories of his times. As if\r\nwe did not have enough of it in our own day, that we must wince under\r\nthe brutal, bruising things Jackson had to cut through in fighting the\r\nbattles of the common people.\r\n\r\nHe did It and did it well. It was a thing placed on him by Fate and he\r\nshirked not. But I love to look at the other and that greater side of\r\nthe man—the home side, the husband side, the man side, the farmer and\r\nhorseman and friend and neighbor—a picture which should live when his\r\npolitics are forgotten. For the story of the politician is ever like the\r\nhigh tide that comes with its wave of splutters in the bay of Fundy and\r\nthen goes back again to oblivion and with much noise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entrance to the Hermitage as it is to-day.\r\n\r\n(Photo March, 1906, by E. E. Sweetland.)]\r\n\r\nBut the Man is the sea into which it has flown, and in their great depths\r\nhave become silent and been forgotten.\r\n\r\nAnd so the picture which clings to me always of Jackson is this told by\r\nSenator Benton of him many years ago:\r\n\r\nIt was a cold, raw March day, and Jackson, the Fighter and Doer of Great\r\nDeeds, was old and tired. The woman he worshiped had died and his heart\r\nwas broken. His children and the friends of his youth had gone too. And\r\nso this neighbor saw the picture I want some great master to paint for\r\nthe coming ages—the most beautiful, soul-telling picture that could be\r\npainted for the world. The old warrior sitting by the big hickory fire of\r\nthe Hermitage. He loved little children and a little child, an adopted\r\ngrandchild, had climbed up on his knee. But the little fellow had found\r\na half-frozen, motherless lamb in the meadow and he would not “be good”\r\nunless the old fighter took his playmate, the lamb, too. And there he sat\r\nwith both of them in his arms and up against his big, great, game, kind\r\nheart, that loved so the fields and the farm and the sweet, quiet things\r\nof life, but whom God had sent to fight the bullets and the bullies of\r\nhis day and generation.\r\n\r\nFor Greatness is a hermit that must suffer and be sacrificed. And the\r\nburden placed on it to do, is not the thing it would love to do.\r\n\r\nLet us look now at Jackson’s land. Let us see it as it was to a raw boy\r\nwhen he came over the mountains of North Carolina to make his home here.\r\n\r\nAeons and ages ago, when the earth was young, there burst upon the banks\r\nof the Cumberland one of the many thousands of sulphur springs which an\r\nAll-wise Physician said would be good for the health of beings, both\r\nbeast and human, who should, through countless ages, inhabit the land.\r\n\r\nThe pioneers called it “The Great Salt Lick,” the “French Lick,” because\r\nbefore ever the American hunter and trapper had arrived the French had\r\nbeen there.\r\n\r\nThey all called it a lick because all wild animals licked it. Pioneers\r\nhave a quick way of naming things and a way that went to the heart of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nCountless herds of bison and deer had claimed the lick as theirs long\r\nbefore ever the sound of a human voice had been heard in the great\r\nforests which towered above it, or echoed from the canoe on the beautiful\r\nriver that flowed by it. For animals were on the earth before man;\r\nand untold generations of buffalo, elk and deer told it, in their own\r\nway, to untold generations which came after them, of the health-giving\r\nsalty-sulphurous water which bubbled from the low bottom, amid the cane\r\nand beneath the big, cool trees on the river banks.\r\n\r\nAnd it became history and tradition to them.\r\n\r\nIt flows to-day in the same low bottom, in the heart of a city man has\r\nmade out of half-baked bricks and called Nashville. And it is no longer\r\nthe Great Salt Lick for the hunter and the hunted have passed and both\r\nhave become dust upon the surface of things. To-day men call it the\r\nSulphur Spring, and true to the laws of the land men have walled it in\r\nand piped it up and shut out all other animals, both of his kind and the\r\nothers; and that which the Great Physician made to be free for all the\r\ncountless sweet animals of the earth, man and woman and the chubby child,\r\nlinks which make life worth the living, and the beautiful deer, kine,\r\nelk and caribou, this greedy little tribe of animals called men, of whom\r\nyou and I are one, not satisfied with having killed off all the other\r\nbeautiful, sweet animals for their hides and tallow, and not satisfied in\r\nhaving felled all the cool, sweet trees which grew on the river, that the\r\nland might parch and burn, and unborn men might forever have to buy more\r\nwater as the land grew more barren and more thirsty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Pike at the Hermitage, going toward Nashville.\r\n\r\n(Photo March, 1906, by E. E. Sweetland.)]\r\n\r\nThe greatest tragedy of the centuries is not the killing of the Innocents\r\nor the massacre of St. Bartholomew or the disasters of war or flame or\r\nfamine, but it is the butchery by man of the trees of the earth—those\r\nstately messengers between the clouds and the land, the felling of which\r\nbreaks the covenant of great laws invisible and blight the earth as with\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nIt is that and the accursed Spirit, which, for a few dollars given,\r\nclaims the right to monopolize the things God made for all men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen one drives down the first dozen miles of the Lebanon pike one has a\r\nquiet, reverent feeling if he has a spark of patriotism in him. It is a\r\ntypical road of Middle Tennessee—for all of Middle Tennessee is a rich\r\nloam lying on limestone. The rocks have been beaten into pikes and the\r\ngray-white roads pencil the distant slope or fade away into the gentle\r\nvalleys. Around, everywhere, is the typical Southern home, the Southern\r\nfarm of the grain and stock raising kind.\r\n\r\nThis sketch is not a story of the life of Andrew Jackson. That were\r\nimpossible in a short article. We have books and books on his life\r\nand character. Every school boy knows his history, the poverty of its\r\nbeginning, the honor of its end. This is merely intended to be a quick\r\npicture of the man and his home as it was then—as it is to-day.\r\n\r\nHome in the South means more than it does anywhere else in the world, for\r\nthe entire law and religion of the South is based on the idea of local\r\nself government—the home idea. Throughout Jackson’s life every plantation\r\nwas a self-governing institution, a little government in itself. And in\r\nthis home the woman was the queen and the real ruler. In no other country\r\nin the world has this idea been so clearly cultivated. It is all through\r\nthe South to-day. Ask any child in the South: “Who lives yonder?” and it\r\nwill always answer with the woman’s name. A visitor to the South to-day\r\nwould think it was widowed.\r\n\r\nAnd so I am going out of the usual line in this story, and to tell the\r\nreal story of Andrew Jackson and his home, I am going to tell the story\r\nof his wife and the great influence which she had on all his life. For\r\nwhen it is studied and sifted everything that Jackson did is closely\r\nbound with the twine of this woman’s love and influence.\r\n\r\nMiddle Tennessee was so rich and fertile and so full of game the\r\nIndians would not permit any one tribe to own it. It was their common\r\nhunting ground. One may imagine how they would regard its occupancy\r\nby the whites. Mr. Charlville, a French trapper, stopped at the Big\r\nLick and lived in the old deserted Shawnee fort on the bluff in 1714.\r\nLater, Boone and other hunters passed, but not until 1779, during the\r\nwar with England, did James Robertson and his company of nine from the\r\nold settlement of Jonesboro, in North Carolina, come to stay, building\r\ntheir fort and log cabins on the bluff near the Big Lick. When he left\r\nthe settlement it had been agreed that his friend and neighbor, Colonel\r\nJohn Donelson, would follow, bringing a number of others, among them the\r\nfamily of James Robertson. This Donelson did, in boats, over a route that\r\nwould stagger a sane man of to-day, down the Holston to the Tennessee,\r\ndown the Tennessee to the Ohio, up the Ohio to the Cumberland, up the\r\nCumberland to the Big Lick two thousand miles by water, and the route\r\ninfested with hostile savages. The story of this four months’ journey\r\nreads as nothing else does in early American pioneer history. “Among\r\nthose who shared the dangers of this voyage,” writes the biographer\r\nParton, “was Rachel Donelson, the leader’s daughter, a black-eyed,\r\nblack-haired brunette, as gay, bold and handsome a lass as ever danced\r\non the deck of a flatboat or took the helm while her father took a shot\r\nat the Indians.” They reached their destination April 24, 1780. Later,\r\nRachel married Lewis Robards, a Kentuckian and was living there when\r\nher brave old pioneer father, John Donelson, was killed in a field near\r\nNashville by Indians several years afterwards.\r\n\r\nJackson came to the settlement a young lawyer from Salisbury, N. C., in\r\n1788. Of his early life every one knows—his poverty, his patriotism, his\r\ngrit, his wildness. I have studied that wildness. It was the wildness of\r\nnervous energy that must do something. It was the same thing that put\r\nTheodore Roosevelt to living the cowboy and hunting grizzlies. For there\r\nis much in common in the characters of these two remarkable men.\r\n\r\nJackson arrived in Nashville in 1788 with scarcely more than a horse\r\n(there never was a time when it seems he did not own a horse!) and his\r\nsaddlebags. In ten years he was a rich man and had laid the foundation\r\nfor his large estate including the land around the Hermitage. He was\r\na fighter and a worker by nature. He jumped at once into a large law\r\npractice, “and in those days a lawyer’s fee for conducting a suit of no\r\ngreat importance,” says an old historian, “might be a square mile of land\r\nor, in Western phrase, a six-forty.” Jackson appears frequently in the\r\nrecords as the purchaser of wild lands. He bought the 640 acres which\r\nafterwards formed the nucleus of the Hermitage for $800, a high price for\r\nthose days. In 1797 he sold more than $6,000 worth of land to a gentleman\r\nin Philadelphia and had several thousand acres left. The secret of his\r\nwealth is that he bought large tracts of land when they could be bought\r\nfor a horse or a cow bell and held them until the torrent of immigration\r\nmade them valuable.\r\n\r\nSurely in this there is more than a hint for the Southerner of\r\nto-day. When we consider the richness and cheapness of our soil, the\r\nsalubriousness of our climate and the fact that immigration has not\r\nreally yet started toward the South, the man who has the forethought now\r\nto invest in Southern land will lay the foundation of a future fortune\r\nmore surely than in any other way.\r\n\r\nHe hated debt, yet his notes would raise money in Boston when nothing\r\nelse in Tennessee would. In 1804, when he lived at Hunter’s Hill,\r\nthirteen miles from Nashville and two miles beyond the present Hermitage\r\nand came so nearly being ruined financially by the failure of David\r\nAllison, of Philadelphia, who had passed Jackson his notes for land and\r\nwhich Jackson had endorsed and exchanged for goods, he sold 25,000 acres\r\nof land in one body, paid all his debts and moved to the log cabin at\r\nthe Hermitage reproduced in this issue.\r\n\r\nHe made money on his horses and no living man knew a horse better than\r\nJackson. We have told before in Trotwood’s of his races at Clover Bottom.\r\nHe rode to Virginia and back to find a Truxton. He imported horse after\r\nhorse to beat Haynie’s Maria, and never did it. When he was President he\r\ndrove to his carriage in Washington two beautiful iron-grays, descendants\r\nof Truxton. “General,” said a lady who journeyed from the far East to see\r\nhim in his old age at the Hermitage, “you ought to be the happiest of\r\nliving men. Every honor in life has been given you. You have accomplished\r\nevery thing you have ever undertaken.”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, madam, my life has been a dismal failure,” he replied.\r\n“The one great object I have worked for has never been accomplished. I\r\nwas never able to beat Haynie’s Maria,” and he smiled at her astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy, as well as the sweetness of Jackson’s life lies around his\r\nlove for Rachel Donelson.\r\n\r\nThis paper will tell of the tragedy.\r\n\r\nBefore she was twenty Rachel Donelson first married Lewis Robards and\r\nwent with him, as stated, to live in pioneer Kentucky. He was a jealous,\r\ndrinking, ill-tempered fool. Horsemen have a term which fits him better\r\nthan any thing elegant I can think of—sour-headed. Robards soon became\r\njealous of his wife and made her life unhappy. Finally he wrote to\r\nRachel’s mother, the widow Donelson, then living near Nashville, that\r\nhe would send her daughter back to her. This he did, but soon afterward\r\nrepented and on the promise of better behavior was reunited to his wife\r\nby the intervention of Judge Overton and went to live with her near\r\nNashville. Jackson and Judge Overton, both were lawyers, boarded in the\r\nsame home, the widow Donelson’s, with Robards and his wife, and in a\r\nlengthy article written 1827, when Jackson was a candidate for President,\r\nJudge Overton tells pointedly and graphically of the affair. He says\r\nthat after Robards sent his wife back to Tennessee he became unhappy\r\nand induced Overton, who was then boarding at old Mrs. Robards’ near\r\nNashville, to beg his wife to let him come back to her, agreeing to live\r\nin Tennessee and to treat her better. This Overton did, and Robards and\r\nhis wife were reunited. In the meanwhile Jackson, a young lawyer, came to\r\nboard in the house, and in a few months Robards began to treat his wife\r\nill again, even accusing her of liking Jackson. Jackson left the house,\r\nto avoid any unpleasantness, but Robards finally left his wife, went\r\nto Virginia and applied to the legislature in the winter of 1790 for a\r\ndivorce. This the legislature granted and Jackson married Mrs. Robards\r\nin the summer of 1791, believing the marriage between her and Robards\r\nwas annulled. But it seems under the Virginia law a final decree of the\r\ncourt was necessary, which Robards did not apply for until 1793. Jackson,\r\nlearning this, was remarried to his wife in 1794.\r\n\r\n“It was a happy marriage,” says Parton, the biographer, “a very happy\r\nmarriage—one of the very happiest ever contracted. They loved one another\r\ndearly. They held each other in the highest respect. They testified\r\nthe love and respect they entertained for one another by those polite\r\nattentions which lovers cannot but exchange before marriage and after\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n“Their love grew as their age increased and became warmer as their blood\r\nbecame colder.\r\n\r\n“No one ever heard either address to the other a disrespectful, an\r\nirritating or unsympathizing word. They were not as familiar as is now\r\nthe fashion. He remained ‘Mr. Jackson’ to her always never ‘General,’\r\nstill less ‘Andrew.’ And he never called her ‘Rachel,’ but ‘Mrs.\r\nJackson,’ or ‘wife.’ The reader shall become better acquainted with their\r\ndomestic life by and by. Meanwhile, let it be understood that our hero\r\nhas now a Home where lives a Friend, true and fond, to welcome his return\r\nfrom ‘wilderness courts,’ to cheer his stay, to lament his departure, yet\r\ngive him a motive for going forth; a home wherein—whatever manner of man\r\nhe might be elsewhere—he was always gentle, kind and patient.\r\n\r\n“He was most prompt to defend his wife’s good name. The peculiar\r\ncircumstances attending his marriage made him touchy on this point. His\r\ntemper, with regard to other causes of offense, was tinder; with respect\r\nto this it was gunpowder. His worst quarrels arose from this cause or\r\nwere greatly aggravated by it. He became sore on the subject, so that at\r\nlast I think he could scarcely hate anyone very heartily without fancying\r\nthat the obnoxious person had said something or caused something to\r\nbe said which reflected on the character of Mrs. Jackson. For the man\r\nwho dared breathe her name except in honor he kept pistols in perfect\r\ncondition for thirty-seven years.”\r\n\r\nThere is a fool and a meddler in every tragedy between men. For a fool is\r\nnaturally a meddler.\r\n\r\n“T. Swann, Esq., lately of Virginia,” filled the role above mentioned\r\nand brought on the duel between Jackson and Charles Dickinson. T.\r\nSwann, Esq., was a young lawyer who came from Virginia to the Western\r\nsettlement. He was a quarter horse with wheels in his head who entered\r\nhimself with the Four-milers. He strutted and would be a man. He wore\r\nfine clothes and volunteered to loan money he never possessed. He used\r\nstrange oaths and professed knowledge of horses. He posed as a fighting\r\ngentleman and carried tales. He butted in and backed out, of course.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1805 General Jackson matched his horse, Truxton, against\r\nCaptain Joseph Ervin’s Plowboy, for $2,000, payable in notes on the day\r\nof the race, the notes to be then due. If either party failed to race he\r\nwas to pay a forfeit of $800. Six persons were interested in the race for\r\nTruxton: General Jackson, Maj. W. P. Anderson, Major Verrell and Captain\r\nPryor. For Plowboy: Captain W. P. Ervin and Charles Dickinson, his\r\nson-in-law. Before the day of the race arrived Dickinson and Ervin found\r\nthat Plowboy was not fit, withdrew him and paid forfeit. It was done to\r\nthe satisfaction of all, amicably done and settled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The famous Clover Bottom race track, the scene of early\r\nhorse racing in Tennessee, and where Jackson’s horses ran so many races.\r\nScene of the triumph of Haynie’s Maria and her great rider, “Monkey\r\nSimon,” a pair which Jackson could never defeat.\r\n\r\n(Photo March, 1906, by E. E. Sweetland.)]\r\n\r\nCharles Dickinson was a young lawyer of talent and fine connections.\r\nHe would drink at times and was then wild and reckless, but he was not\r\nunamiable and was a gentleman when sober, but when excited by drink he\r\nswore violently and was loose in his talk. Soon after paying forfeit in\r\nthe Truxton-Plowboy race he “got in his cups” and spoke disparagingly of\r\nMrs. Jackson. In fact all of Jackson’s enemies, even from John Sevier\r\ndown (whom Jackson once came very near killing for the same cause), used\r\nthe unfortunate haste of Jackson’s marriage whenever they wished to\r\noffend him most deeply. Jackson called on Dickinson and quickly took him\r\nto task. Dickinson apologized, said if he had used the words he was drunk\r\nand was sorry, and they separated in a friendly manner.\r\n\r\nBut Dickinson soon got into his cups again, and in the Nashville Inn used\r\nmost offensive words concerning Mrs. Jackson. Jackson was always most\r\ncool and thoughtful in the closest places. This time he went to Captain\r\nErvin and advised him to use his influence with his son-in-law to control\r\nhis tongue, and added: “I wish no quarrel with him; he is being used by\r\nmy enemies to pick a quarrel with me. Advise him to stop in time.”\r\n\r\nHere it would have ended but for “T. Swann, Esq., late of Virginia,”\r\nand as so many foolish reports of the famous duel have been published I\r\nshall go into details to tell how it was really fought. Every year it\r\nis published—how Dickinson at the famous race said in the presence of\r\nJackson that “Truxton ran away from Plowboy like Jackson ran away with\r\nanother man’s wife,” and so on. All of which is untrue. The Impartial\r\nReview and Cumberland Repository, edited by Thomas Eastin, of January,\r\n1806, and now in the library of the Tennessee Historical Society, is full\r\nof all the letters and communications leading up to the tragedy, and\r\nwithout going into lengthy details, the main facts of which are these:\r\n\r\n1. Mr. T. Swann, one night, was loafing in the store of George and Robert\r\nBell and says he heard Patton Anderson say that the notes offered by\r\nCaptain Joseph Ervin at the time he paid the forfeit were different from\r\nthose General Jackson agreed to receive. Charles Dickinson heard of this\r\nand called on T. Swann, Esq., to know if it was true, and Swann said it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\n2. T. Swann then loafed over into General Jackson’s store, the old Indian\r\nblock-house, which stood for many years on the Clover Bottom track, and\r\nasked General Jackson if Captain Ervin or Dickinson offered him notes\r\ndifferent from those they had agreed to take. General Jackson answered\r\nthat Dickinson’s were the same, but Ervin’s were a little different, not\r\nbeing due on demand, as agreed.\r\n\r\n3. Mr. T. Swann later rode from Clover Bottom to Nashville with Captain\r\nErvin and told him what General Jackson had said.\r\n\r\n4. Meeting between General Jackson Ervin and Dickinson in Nashville.\r\nMutual explanations, in which General Jackson said what he thought of T.\r\nSwann Esq., in terms forceful but not elegant.\r\n\r\n5. A letter from T. Swann, Esq., to General Jackson, calculated to make\r\nthe latter challenge him to mortal combat, the presumptuous, windy letter\r\nof a foolish boy.\r\n\r\n6. A hot reply from General Jackson, an elegant letter and a model in the\r\nKing’s English. This letter alone would refute any idea that Jackson’s\r\nintellect was not of the highest or his English half-baked. In it he\r\nsays: “There are certain traits that always accompany the gentleman and\r\nman of truth. The moment he hears harsh expressions applied to a friend\r\nhe will immediately communicate it, that explanations may take place;\r\nwhen the base poltroon and cowardly tale-bearer will always act in the\r\nbackground. You can apply the latter to Mr. Dickinson and see which fits\r\nhim best. I write it for his eye, and the latter I emphatically intend\r\nfor him. When the conversation dropped between Mr. Dickinson and myself\r\nI thought it was at an end. As he wishes to blow the coal, I am ready to\r\nlight it to an end.”\r\n\r\nAll of which shows that Jackson had decided to strike over the head of T.\r\nSwann to the real power behind him—the man who had twice publicly abused\r\nMrs. Jackson.\r\n\r\n7. T. Swann cannot keep away from the General, but hunts him up as soon\r\nas he comes to town and demands an explanation. He meets abuse and\r\nthreats of caning, in which the General says he would not want a better\r\nbreakfast than to eat fifty such as T. Swann, Esq.\r\n\r\n8. T. Swann challenges the General to mortal combat. Read the\r\ngrandiloquent challenge:\r\n\r\n    “General Andrew Jackson: Think not that I am to be intimidated\r\n    by your threats. No power terrestrial shall prevent the settled\r\n    purpose of my soul. The statement I have made in respect to the\r\n    notes is substantially correct. The torrent of abusive language\r\n    with which you have assailed me is such as every gentleman\r\n    should blush to hear. Your menaces I set at defiance, and now\r\n    demand of you that reparation which one gentleman is entitled\r\n    to receive of another. My friend, the bearer of this, is\r\n    authorized to make complete arrangements in the field of honor.”\r\n\r\n                                                       THOMAS SWANN.\r\n\r\n    “Nashville, Jany. 12th, 1806.”\r\n\r\n9. Jackson comes to town, meets Mr. T. Swann and breaks a cane over his\r\nhead. T. Swann is game, if he is a fool, and though the cane, to use\r\nhis own language, becomes “a large bludgeon and a brace of pistols,” he\r\nchallenges the General again and induces Mr. N. A. McNairy to act for him.\r\n\r\n10. Charles Dickinson takes matters up, writes an offensive letter to\r\nJackson, closing with:\r\n\r\n    “As to the word ‘coward,’ I think it is as applicable to\r\n    yourself as to any one I know, and I shall be very glad when\r\n    an opportunity serves to know in what manner you give your\r\n    medicines, and I hope you will take in payment one of my most\r\n    moderate cathartics.\r\n\r\n                           “Yours at command,\r\n\r\n                                                 “CHARLES DICKINSON.\r\n\r\n    “Jany 10, 1806.”\r\n\r\nDickinson wrote this and took a flatboat for New Orleans, spending the\r\ntime to and fro practicing with a pistol.\r\n\r\n11. Jackson publishes a communication in the town paper, supported by\r\naffidavits of John Hutchings and John Coffee, concerning the whole\r\nmatter, stating that T. Swann brought it all on himself, was an\r\nintermeddler and not a gentleman, and raps Mr. McNairy for being in\r\nthe same class. Bluff old John Coffee writes a page or two telling how\r\nJackson had to cane T. Swann to keep from killing him, and that Mr.\r\nMcNairy, T. Swann’s friend, told him one thing and did another. The\r\nhidden humor of all this preparation for blood-letting is the fact that\r\nGeneral Jackson did not consider T. Swann a gentleman, and therefore\r\nnot entitled to satisfaction with pistols. In proof of it he prints the\r\naffidavit of Robert Hays, who solemnly swears and asserts that the said\r\nT. Swann volunteered once to loan Sam Jackson $200 but when the said Sam\r\nwent to get it, T. Swann had loaned it to another man! Several others\r\nswear to the same thing, to wit, that T. Swann was no gentleman, because\r\nhe failed to respond to the touch of the said Samuel.\r\n\r\nUnder the code of honor T. Swann may not have been a gentleman, but in\r\nfull cognizance of the record of S. Jackson, Esq., for borrowing, we are\r\nin honor bound to reverse our former assertion as to the said T. Swann\r\nbeing a fool!\r\n\r\n12. Nathaniel A. McNairy, knight of high renown, now comes into the arena\r\nof newspaper controversy and publishes a most abusive and sarcastic\r\nletter about General Jackson, saying among other things—they used many\r\nitalics in those days—that “the brave General is much more pleased in\r\nshedding bushels of ink than one ounce of blood, provided there is an\r\nequal chance that that one ounce should be extracted from his own dear\r\ncarcass. But give him an advantage and he is as brave as Julius Caesar,\r\nsuch as this: Give him a large brace of rifled-barreled pistols and he\r\nwill race a superannuated Governor in the road as he travels (this refers\r\nto Jackson’s quarrel with John Sevier), or he will meet Mr. Swann in some\r\nsequestered spot, that the alert General may obtain some dishonorable\r\nadvantage when no eye can see him; or let him have a pistol and he will\r\nshoot at a man who has none and drive him off to Kentucky, God knows for\r\nwhat offense!” etc.\r\n\r\nHere was a fight for Jackson, but as he was booked for Dickinson, John\r\nCoffee took the job off his hands and fought the duel with McNairy, and\r\nthey fought to kill in those days. Witness the graphic account of this\r\nduel in the Impartial Review, written by Maj. Robert Purdy, the second of\r\nJohn Coffee.\r\n\r\n13. In the duel it was agreed that if either man fired before word had\r\nbeen given, the second of the other was to shoot him. One, two, three,\r\nfire! was the rule, but McNairy fired at two, wounding John Coffee in\r\nthe hip. Purdy came near killing McNairy for this, but he begged off,\r\nclaiming it was an accident.\r\n\r\n14. Dickinson returns from New Orleans and, on May 24, publishes a bitter\r\nattack in the Impartial Review, on General Jackson, saying among other\r\nthings “notwithstanding he is a Major General of the militia of Mero\r\nDistrict, I declare him to be a worthless scoundrel, a poltroon and a\r\ncoward.”\r\n\r\nThe editor of the paper showed this to Thomas Overton before it was\r\npublished and that gentleman rode to the Hermitage. “General Jackson,” he\r\nsaid, “it is a thing you cannot pass over. You must fight him.”\r\n\r\n“General Overton,” said his friend “this is an affair of life and death.\r\nI will take the responsibility myself. I will ride to town and see the\r\npiece and form my own judgment of it.”\r\n\r\n15. He did and this is Jackson’s famous challenge to Dickinson.\r\n\r\n    “Charles Dickinson.—Sir: Your conduct and expressions relative\r\n    to me of late have been of such a nature and so insulting that\r\n    it requires and shall have my notice.\r\n\r\n    “Insult may be given by men, and of such a kind that they\r\n    must be noticed and treated with the respect due a gentleman,\r\n    although (in the present instance), you do not merit it.\r\n\r\n    “You have, to disturb my quiet, industriously excited Thomas\r\n    Swann to quarrel with me, which involved the peace and harmony\r\n    of society for a while.\r\n\r\n    “You, on the 10th of January, wrote me a very insulting letter,\r\n    left this country, caused this letter to be delivered after\r\n    you had been gone some days, and viewing yourself in safety\r\n    from the contempt I held you, have now in the press a piece\r\n    more replete with blackguard abuse than any other of your\r\n    productions. You are pleased to state that you would have\r\n    noticed me in a different way, but my cowardice would have\r\n    found a pretext to evade that satisfaction if it had been\r\n    called for, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n    “I hope, sir, your courage will be an ample security to me that\r\n    I will obtain speedily that satisfaction due me for the insults\r\n    offered, and in the way my friend who hands you this will point\r\n    out. He waits upon you for that purpose, and with your friend\r\n    will enter into immediate arrangements for this purpose.\r\n\r\n    “I am, etc.,\r\n\r\n                                                   “ANDREW JACKSON.”\r\n\r\n16. T. Swann still butts in. He comes out in a card, in which he says: “I\r\nshall now conclude this address to the public by assuring General Andrew\r\nJackson (to use a favorite expression of his own) ‘that I shall at all\r\ntimes hold myself answerable for any of my conduct.’”\r\n\r\nThat was May 20, 1806, nearly a century ago. T. Swann, perhaps, is dead\r\nby now. But we will faithfully endeavor to secure a picture of his grave\r\nas it looks to-day, that he may still appropriately appear in the tragedy\r\nhis gunpowder head and hair-trigger mouth brought on. Jackson brushed\r\nhim aside as a bull would a fly and went after the man he had picked out\r\nto fight all the time—Dickinson, the best shot in the West, the man who\r\nafter one warning had dared to impugn the character of Rachel Donelson\r\nJackson.\r\n\r\nAnd so was brought on the great duel, one of the most famous of all times\r\nand which cast its shadow over Jackson’s life, even to the portals of\r\ndeath. For the almost fatal wound Dickinson gave him broke out afresh now\r\nand then during all his remaining days and helped to carry him off at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n17. The Duel. A great man always has his bitterest enemies at his own\r\nhome. The nearer they get to him—friends and enemies—the more they love\r\nor hate him. It is the weakness of poor, fighting humanity that they are\r\nkind to strangers out of their way, but will fight the neighbor who gets\r\nin their way. And when a man becomes so much greater than his neighbors\r\nthat the world knows him but knows them not, there may he expect to find\r\nthe essence of all narrowness.\r\n\r\nJackson always had his bitter enemies. Many people of his own town fought\r\nhim most bitterly, even when he was saving their lives from Indians and\r\ntheir land from the foreigner. He could stand it himself and suffer,\r\nbut when they took it out by slandering his wife, then it was that his\r\npistols were ever ready.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pike near the Clover Bottom race track.\r\n\r\n(Photo March, 1906, by E. E. Sweetland.)]\r\n\r\nA political enemy of Jackson living at Nashville published during his\r\nPresidential campaign a pamphlet containing a list of “nearly one hundred\r\nfights or violent or abusive quarrels.” But Jackson lived seventy-eight\r\nyears, in an age when personal fights were the law of the land. He always\r\nmade his friends’ quarrels his own, and for the first fifteen years of\r\nhis life, as District Attorney, Judge and lawyer he was brought into\r\ncollision with the tough element and rascals of the State.\r\n\r\nThe challenge was sent May 22, and Dickinson promptly accepted it\r\nthrough his second, Dr. Catlett, and named the day of meeting at seven\r\no’clock Friday morning, May 30, 1806, at Harrison Mills, on Red River,\r\nin Logan County, Ky. Jackson objected strenuously to postponing it a\r\nweek. He wanted to fight the next day and sent Overton, his second, to\r\nsee Catlett and have the date changed. Catlett said Dickinson did not\r\nhave his pistols ready. Jackson offered to give him his choice of his\r\nown, and added: “For God’s sake, let this business be brought to an issue\r\nimmediately, as I cannot see after publication why Mr. Dickinson should\r\nwish to put it off until Friday.”\r\n\r\nBut Dickinson would not yield, and for a week the impetuous Jackson could\r\nonly chafe and wait.\r\n\r\nFrom Nashville to Harrison Mills, in Logan County, Ky., is fully fifty\r\nmiles across country. Horseback was the only mode of travel through the\r\nnew country then, but a ride of fifty miles a day, used to horseback as\r\nthey were, and riding such horses as he rode, was no unusual thing for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Sulphur Spring—“The Great French Lick,” as it appears\r\nto-day on Cherry Street, Nashville. Quere: What would the buffalo and\r\nhunters of old have thought of that thing in their day, with a negro in\r\nthe tower?\r\n\r\n(Photo March, 1906, by E. E. Sweetland.)]\r\n\r\nDickinson arose Thursday morning before day. His young wife was sleeping\r\nby his side and knew nothing of it. He dressed then awakened her and\r\nkissed her with more than usual tenderness: “Good-bye, darling. I shall\r\nbe sure to be home to-morrow night.”\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” she asked, surprised. “Oh, just over into Kentucky\r\non a little matter of business. I will be back to-morrow night.”\r\n\r\nHe started out, but she called him back and kissed him again. He laughed\r\nboyishly, recklessly at the look of doubt and fear that had crept into\r\nher eyes for she had heard rumors only of what the whole town knew, but\r\nit never occurred to her that the tragedy was so near.\r\n\r\nIt was a gay, rollicking crowd of a half-dozen young men who joined\r\nDickinson for his ride across two counties to Kentucky. Never was a more\r\nhilarious party. They took short cuts. They galloped across dangerous\r\nplaces, displaying horsemanship and nerve. They drank and made the woods\r\necho with their shouts. Before he left Nashville, Dickinson had bet $500\r\nthat he would kill his man—that he would put his ball within a half-inch\r\nof the coat button over Jackson’s heart. When they stopped for dinner,\r\nhe amused the crowd with his wonderful marksmanship. He tied a string\r\nbetween two trees and three times he cut it in twain with his pistol\r\nball. At twenty-four feet he put four bullets in a spot no larger than a\r\nsilver dollar. “When General Jackson comes along here,” he said to the\r\nlandlord of the little eating house, “show him these.”\r\n\r\nHe thought to weaken Jackson’s nerve, but little did he realize the real\r\nnerve of the man who was afterwards to send to death and defeat the\r\ntroops that conquered Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nThere is no record of Jackson’s home-leaving, except that he started\r\nearly and went quietly along, those two soldiers of the Revolution and\r\nof Indian warfare. If his wife knew it, she was not the woman to try to\r\nstop him. She had much of the stubborn, solemn, predestined Scotch-Irish\r\nnature of her husband. She was used to his fights, for he had many of\r\nthem, and to her he was always right. She would not stop him if she\r\ncould, and that no one ever stopped him she knew. There was the dignity\r\nof great love and respect between the two. They never questioned each\r\nother’s motives. The one never trespassed on the other’s world. She was\r\nintensely religious—of the Presbyterian predestined kind. If she kissed\r\nhim good-bye, not an eyelash quivered, not a tremor of doubt or fear, and\r\nif she said anything, doubtless it was:\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Mr. Jackson. Of course you will kill him. God is on our side!”\r\n\r\nIf Dickinson and his crowd rode along with shouts and songs, and wild,\r\nreckless fun, very different was Jackson’s and Thomas Overton’s journey.\r\nThey knew Jackson’s chances for death were five to one. He was an\r\nindifferent shot—all high-strung, nervous men are. He had but one chance,\r\nand he and Overton thought it out as calmly as ever generals planned a\r\nbattle. For it was a battle—a battle of life and death, with the chances\r\nall against Jackson. It reminds me of the night before Hastings which\r\nHarold, the Saxon king’s, army spent in drink and song and cheer and wild\r\nhilarity. But down on the sandy beach William the Conqueror’s men spent\r\ntheirs in solemn thought and silent sleep and prayer.\r\n\r\nLittle things count most in the crises of life and it was Dickinson’s\r\ntalk at last that gave Jackson the plan of his fight.\r\n\r\n“General,” said Thomas Overton, as they rode along, “I have been thinking\r\nof the only chance we have got. It’s a bitter pill, but it’s our only\r\nchance with a man who shoots as quick and true as Dickinson.”\r\n\r\nJackson was silent. He knew his second; that no gamer, truer man lived;\r\nthat he was not only a soldier himself, but had been in many affairs of\r\nhonor before; that he would let no chance escape him.\r\n\r\n“You see, it is this way,” went on the second; “we have agreed on the\r\nmode of fighting, as you know. The distance is twenty-four feet. We will\r\ntoss up for position. There will be no counting. Each man is to hold his\r\npistol down by his side until the word fire is given, then each is to\r\nfire as he pleases.”\r\n\r\nJackson was still silent. He knew this was not to his advantage. But as\r\nthe challenged party Dickinson’s second had the choice of weapons and\r\nconditions. He knew that Dickinson, expert shot that he was, needed no\r\ntime to aim and fire, but that he himself did. Dickinson shot instantly,\r\nas a boy shoots a marble; no aim, but that true action of the hand and\r\neye which come together by practice and long instinct. There is no aim\r\nthat equals it—it is natural, it is the mark of the expert.\r\n\r\n“Now I have thought it out. There is no chance for me to get the first\r\nshot. Dickinson can shoot quicker than you and with more chance of\r\nsuccess. All you can do is to wait till he shoots and take your chance.\r\nIf he wounds you or misses you take your time and kill him. If you try to\r\nshoot first, you will miss him and he will kill you. It’s hard, but it’s\r\nall we can do.”\r\n\r\nJackson agreed and went to the field, a six foot three inch target at\r\ntwenty-four feet, for a man who could put four balls in four shots into\r\na space not half the size of Jackson’s heart! It took a heart of steel\r\nto know that, as he traveled wearily along the rough road, and when the\r\nlandlord pointed to a sparrow’s head Dickinson had shot off, he smiled\r\ngrimly and said:\r\n\r\n“Never mind, my dear sir, he will come this way day after to-morrow in a\r\nbox. Be sure of that.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Spring and Dairy at the Hermitage, where Jackson used\r\nto indulge in cool buttermilk.\r\n\r\n(Photo March, 1906, by E. E. Sweetland.)]\r\n\r\nJackson never would talk in after years of the fight. In fact he never\r\ntalked of any of them could he help it. Only twice did he ever mention\r\nit. Once when he was President and he was fighting for his political life\r\nand they were using Dickinson’s death, among other things, to defeat\r\nhim. “As for Dickinson,” he said, “I would have killed him if he had shot\r\nme through the brain.” In his later years he regretted it more and more,\r\nand once said: “I never would have killed him if he had missed me. When I\r\nkilled him I was as sure as I lived that he had mortally wounded me.”\r\n\r\nA little tavern kept by David Miller stood on the banks of the Red River\r\nin those days, one hundred years ago. Other friends joined Jackson en\r\nroute, and they reached the tavern, a small party of horsemen, about\r\nsunset Thursday afternoon, May 29, and obtained lodgings for the night.\r\nDickinson’s party went to a house two miles lower down the river, kept by\r\nWilliam Harrison.\r\n\r\nJackson ate heartily and sat out under the stars after supper smoking his\r\npipe as usual, and chatting with his friends. Jacob Smith, the landlord,\r\nsoon fell under the magnetic charm of the man and used to love to state\r\nhow he talked with his guest and how, as he bade him good night, he\r\nwished him good luck on the morrow.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning an overseer who worked Jacob Smith’s negroes on a\r\nnear-by farm, saw a cavalcade of horsemen ride to the river’s banks. He\r\nknew what was up, and he wished greatly to see it. There was no ferryman\r\nat the river, and after waiting and calling, Jackson spurred his horse\r\ninto the stream and dashed across into the forest beyond followed by his\r\nfriends. It was a level beautiful spot in the shade of large towering\r\npoplars. The trees rose tall and stately, already showering upon the\r\ngrass beneath their wax-like, blood-flecked blossoms, emblems of the\r\nflecks of deeper carmine so soon to crimson the earth.\r\n\r\nThe cavalcade dismounted and hitched their horses. Dickinson and party\r\nwere already there. It was not yet seven. Jackson walked between his\r\nsurgeon and his second.\r\n\r\n“How do you feel about it now, General?” asked the surgeon.\r\n\r\n“All right, sir; all right. I will wing him, never fear.”\r\n\r\nBut Overton was still thinking, his head down, silently and deeply. He\r\nhad just heard of Dickinson’s boast that he would shoot within an inch\r\nof the button over Jackson’s heart. Jackson was slender and wore a coat\r\nalways buttoned tightly around his erect, thin, military form.\r\n\r\n“General,” he said quietly, as they walked along, “unbutton your coat to\r\nthe top button. Let it hang loose.”\r\n\r\nAnd this it was that saved Jackson’s life and gave to his country one of\r\nher greatest generals and one of her greatest Presidents.\r\n\r\nDickinson’s second drew the choice for position. He promptly stationed\r\nDickinson with his back to the rising sun. The glare would be in\r\nJackson’s face. But Overton drew the word and his quiet face lighted with\r\npleasure, for he had even thought that out, how he would give it. Nothing\r\nescaped Thomas Overton when his friend’s life was at stake.\r\n\r\nThere were peculiar words in use in the old Revolutionary manual of arms.\r\n“Poise fl’ok!” would mean to-day: “Present arms.” The change is obvious:\r\n“fl’ok—” “firelock.”\r\n\r\n“Ready, aim, fere!” and they dwelt long on f-e-r-e, for it meant fire.\r\nAnd when it came from Overton’s mouth he brought it out with a shriek and\r\nvolume, quick and sharp, so unexpected that it took calmness and nerve to\r\nthink more of the shooting than the word.\r\n\r\nDickinson was younger than Jackson and far handsomer. He stood at his\r\nmark smilingly, confidently. Jackson stood, his thin, determined face\r\ndrawn with the intensity of that earnestness and calmness which it ever\r\nwore in critical moments. It is said that he had a bullet in his mouth\r\nto clench his teeth upon, a thing he often did in the agony of the great\r\nphysical pain which, from one cause and another, was his inheritance all\r\nthrough life.\r\n\r\nThe two men were as unlike as nature could make them. Dickinson, who came\r\nfrom Maryland was a well-bred cavalier. Jackson had no breeding at all.\r\nHe was born a day or two after they buried his father in a pauper’s grave\r\nand all his mother ever told him was that they had left Ireland to escape\r\nBritish persecution and that his grandfather was hanged for leading in an\r\nIrish rebellion. Dickinson was gay, brave, cool and the best shot with a\r\npistol living.\r\n\r\nJackson was earnest, terribly earnest; cool, but gunpowdery. He stood for\r\nsomething. He was a man of destiny—felt it, knew it. Dickinson was a man\r\nof chance. Jackson felt he was destined for great things. He did not see\r\nhow, but he knew he would kill Dickinson.\r\n\r\n“Are you ready, gentlemen?” asked Overton.\r\n\r\n“I am ready, sir,” said Dickinson.\r\n\r\n“Ready!” snapped Jackson from his thin, drawn lips.\r\n\r\n“Then f-e-r-e!” shouted Overton, almost before the word had left\r\nJackson’s lips.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange word to Dickinson, strangely, fiercely, excitingly said.\r\nUp went his pistol—he never took aim—and when it reached the button over\r\nJackson’s heart the quiet sweetness of the virgin poplars canopying the\r\ncool, grassy plot echoed to the thunder of his big pistol, hurling at\r\nJackson’s heart the terrible two-ounce cone of lead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scene on Stone River just back of the Clover Bottom race\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\n(Photo March, 1906, by E. E. Sweetland.)]\r\n\r\nOverton’s eyes were glued with fear on Jackson. He saw the dust fly out\r\nfrom the button over his heart. He saw Jackson half wince, his face\r\nflash with grim anger, half brace himself and throw his left arm across\r\nhis breast as if to hold his heart in till he could fire. It was done\r\nnaturally, easily, and Overton’s face lighted with joy as he saw Jackson\r\ncalmly, coolly raise his own pistol.\r\n\r\nBut Dickinson—Overton drew his own pistol and turned on him\r\nfiercely—Dickinson, pale, astounded, had involuntarily stepped back from\r\nhis own line, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n“My God! Have I missed him?”\r\n\r\n“Back to your mark!” shouted Overton, “or I will shoot you in your\r\ntracks!”\r\n\r\nDickinson flushed and stepped up to the mark, his eyes down, his smoking\r\npistol in his hand.\r\n\r\nJackson took deliberate aim and touched the hair trigger.\r\n\r\nSnap!\r\n\r\nIt stopped on the half-cock. Never before had it done that, for a truer,\r\nbetter weapon no man ever had. Why this accident, this chance, one in ten\r\nthousand? We know not the unseen of life. Who sent it to give Dickinson\r\nthis chance for his life—to save Jackson from a shadow that would darken\r\nall of his?\r\n\r\nCoolly, grimly Jackson recocked his pistol. Reeling with pain and loss\r\nof blood, but bracing himself to kill, he took deliberate aim, not at\r\nDickinson’s brain, not at his heart, for his chances were small there,\r\nbut at the middle of his body where he knew he could hit and where death\r\nwould be sure and lingering.\r\n\r\nDickinson collapsed at the fire and went down, pale, frantic. Jackson\r\nstood stoically, reeling, nausea-stricken, but no man knew it. The\r\nsurgeon and friends rushed to Dickinson and opened his clothes. The blood\r\npoured in a rush from near his hip. The surgeon’s face lit up. That did\r\nnot mean death. But look, the hole was above the center of his abdomen\r\nwhere the large bowel crossed the smaller ones. One glance was enough.\r\n“No chance,” he whispered to the second; “that is death.”\r\n\r\nJackson walked off erectly—not a waver, not a limp, between his second\r\nand his surgeon. Dickinson’s eyes followed him, and the agony of his\r\nfailure entered with the agony of his fate.\r\n\r\n“Are you wounded, General?” asked the surgeon.\r\n\r\n“O, he pinked me a little,” said Jackson, walking rapidly on to his horse\r\nas he felt the blood rising in his boot leg. “But don’t let them know;\r\ndon’t let them know,” he added fiercely.\r\n\r\nOverton had walked back to Dickinson and now came up. He said quietly:\r\n\r\n“We can retire now, General. He will not trouble you any more.”\r\n\r\nThey rode back to the Inn. A negro woman was churning in the yard\r\nbeneath the cool trees. Loss of blood made Jackson thirsty.\r\n\r\n“Can you give me a dipper of buttermilk?” he asked her.\r\n\r\nShe pushed back with her dasher the forming globules of butter and dipped\r\nfor the milk. For the first time Jackson unbuttoned his top button and\r\nlooked at his shirt. It was crimson. The woman glanced up.\r\n\r\n“My God, marster, are you hurt?”\r\n\r\nJackson smiled and drank the milk at a quaff. Then he walked into his\r\nroom with his surgeon.\r\n\r\nHe was badly wounded. The great ball had been put accurately, but his\r\nloose coat had saved his life. The bullet struck his breast bone an inch\r\ntoo far to the left, shattered it, two ribs, ploughed around his ribs and\r\ncame out at his back. His boot was nearly filled with blood.\r\n\r\nLater, he sent his own surgeon with a bottle of wine to Dickinson with\r\ninstructions to do all he could for him. But Dickinson was past help.\r\nHe lingered all the afternoon in agony, cursing his fate, the ball that\r\nkilled him and begging for his wife to come. About nine o’clock he\r\nsuddenly raised up in bed and exclaimed: “Why—why—have—you—put—out—the\r\nlights?”\r\n\r\nBut the lights were not out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photo by Julie Royster, Raleigh, N.

Father had sent\r\nit to her “enduring of the War.”\r\n\r\nI suppose almost every soldier of the war, Confederate or Federal, who\r\nhad any sentiment sent his sweetheart a copy of this famous song.\r\n\r\nHow full of pathos are the several verses:\r\n\r\n    “The years creep slowly by, Lorena;\r\n    The snow is on the grass again,\r\n    The sun’s low down the sky, Lorena,\r\n    The frost is where the flowers have been.\r\n    But the heart throbs on as warmly now\r\n    As when the summer days were nigh;\r\n    Oh, the sun can never dip so low\r\n    Adown affection’s cloudless sky.\r\n\r\n    A hundred months have passed, Lorena,\r\n    Since last I held thy hand in mine,\r\n    And felt the pulse beat fast, Lorena,\r\n    Though mine beat faster far than thine;\r\n    A hundred months—’twas flowery May,\r\n    When up that hilly slope we climbed\r\n    To watch the dying of the day,\r\n    And hear the distant church bells chimed.\r\n\r\n    We loved each other then, Lorena,\r\n    More than we ever cared to tell;\r\n    And what we might have been, Lorena,\r\n    Had our lovings prospered well.\r\n    But then ’tis passed; the years are gone;\r\n    I’ll not call up their shadowy forms;\r\n    I’ll say to them: Lost years, sleep on;\r\n    Sleep on, nor heed life’s pelting storms.\r\n\r\n    The story of the past, Lorena,\r\n    Alas! I care not to repeat;\r\n    The hopes that could not last, Lorena,\r\n    They lived, but only lived to cheat.\r\n    I would not cause e’en one regret\r\n    To rankle in your bosom now,\r\n    For “if we try, we may forget”\r\n    Were words of thine long years ago.\r\n\r\n    Yes, these were words of thine, Lorena,\r\n    They burn within my memory yet;\r\n    They touched some tender chord, Lorena,\r\n    That thrills and trembles with regret.\r\n    ’Twas not thy woman’s heart that spoke—\r\n    Thy heart was always true to me;\r\n    A duty, stern and pressing, broke\r\n    The tie that linked my soul to thee.\r\n\r\n    It matters little now, Lorena,\r\n    The past is in the eternal past;\r\n    Our heads will soon lie low, Lorena,\r\n    Life’s tide is ebbing out so fast.\r\n    There is a future! Oh, thank God!\r\n    Of life this is so small a part!\r\n    ’Tis dust to dust beneath the sod,\r\n    But there—up there, ’tis ‘heart to heart.’”\r\n\r\nThese words were written by Rev. H. D. L. Webster, born in Stamford,\r\nConn., August 29, 1824; was educated in Columbus, Ohio, and preached at\r\nZanesville, Ohio for some years, leaving there in 1848. The music was\r\ncomposed by J. P. Webster, but no relation.\r\n\r\nOhio claims the writer and the song, but it is known and regarded as a\r\nSouthern song, having been so extensively sung below Mason and Dixon’s\r\nline.\r\n\r\n“Lorena” was Miss Ella Blocksom, of Zanesville, Ohio. She was a member of\r\nMr. Webster’s church—the Universalist—also a leading member of the choir,\r\nwith a beautiful and highly cultivated voice. She was as lovely in face\r\nand person as her voice was sweet and touching; and it was but natural\r\nthat the fine-looking, intelligent young divine should be attracted to\r\nthat face that was each Sunday opposite him and listened so interestedly\r\nto his preaching.\r\n\r\nOne describes her as “nineteen,” short in stature and petite, with blue\r\neyes and light brown hair and features that took hold upon “the poetry of\r\nheaven.”\r\n\r\nShe was the sister-in-law of one of the “pillars of the church,” a\r\nsuccessful manufacturer, and of course the preacher found he often must\r\nconsult this brother about ecclesiastical matters and see his pretty,\r\ncharming sister-in-law.\r\n\r\nWhat real love affair ever ran smoothly? This one did not, for Lorena’s\r\nsister had better “game” for her to bring down than a poor, though\r\nhandsome, intellectual preacher; so, like many another worldly-wise elder\r\nsister, she, after repeated efforts, made “Lorena” see that she and “Paul\r\nVane,” as Mr. Webster called himself in one of his songs, must part.\r\n\r\nOn a certain cloudless Sabbath in May these two lovers walked after the\r\nmorning service, to Hamline Hill and lingered until twilight was closing\r\nher wind in the west, and “Lorena” told “Paul Vane” farewell.\r\n\r\nThe next day she wrote him a letter, in which she said, “if we try, we\r\nmay forget,” and he knew “’twas not thy woman’s heart that spoke,” but\r\nher sister’s through her.\r\n\r\nFinding that this world was a blank world to him without “Lorena’s”\r\nloving look and smile, he resigned his charge, where, as a minister, he\r\nhad been so successful and, as a lover, such a failure, and left for\r\nparts unknown.\r\n\r\nTime went by and he was heard of in the West. He developed the “poetic\r\nfire,” and, in 1860, his song “Lorena,” appeared—one hundred months after\r\nhis farewell to Ella Blocksom.\r\n\r\nThe song was almost famous before she realized it was a tribute to her\r\nfrom her old and loyal lover. She is accused of having no sentiment, or\r\nof being a “namby-pamby,” as she never wrote him one line of thanks for\r\nthe song, or for his constancy to her, as he had a right to expect. Three\r\nyears later, he wrote “Paul Vane”—the answer one would think a “Lorena”\r\nwould have made:\r\n\r\n    “The years are creeping slowly by, dear Paul,\r\n    The winters come and go;\r\n    The wind sweeps past with mournful cry, dear Paul,\r\n    And pelt my face with snow.\r\n    But there’s no snow upon the heart, dear Paul.\r\n    ’Tis summer always there;\r\n    Those early loves throw sunshine over all,\r\n    And sweeten memories dear.\r\n    I’ve kept you ever in my heart, dear Paul.\r\n    Through years of good and ill;\r\n    Our souls could not be torn apart, dear Paul,\r\n    They’re bound together still.\r\n    I never knew how dear you were to me\r\n    ’Til’ I was left alone;\r\n    I thought my poor, poor heart would break the day\r\n    They told me you were gone.”\r\n\r\n“Lorena” married a young lawyer of Ironton, Ohio, who later on became a\r\nSupreme Judge. He died, full of honors, March 2, 1887.\r\n\r\n“In the city of Zanesville, surrounded by the scenes of her girlhood\r\ndays, still lives Lorena in her widowed age. The hill she climbed in that\r\nflowery May of long ago is now hidden from sight by the intrusive growth\r\nof the flourishing city. She alone remains of her little family.” Her sun\r\nis slowly declining toward the horizon and she will soon meet her two\r\nlovers, “Paul Vane” and her husband.\r\n\r\nThe Muskingum, turbid and historic, flows on as in the days when “Lorena”\r\nand her lover “when up that hilly slope.” Through the changing panorama\r\nof its banks a steamer comes and goes, often filled with merry-makers,\r\nlaughter and song, and this vessel wears proudly a name ever linked with\r\nthe River—“Lorena.”\r\n\r\nRev. H. D. L. Webster married February 14, 1850, Sarah L. Wilmot. They\r\nhad two children, both of whom are living. After the death of his first\r\nwife, he married at Racine, Wis., December 31, 1867, Mary M. Skinner. The\r\ntwo children of this union are still living.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster commenced preaching when twenty-two years of age and was\r\ngreatly beloved, as he was devoted to his work. He organized the first\r\nUniversalist society, at Tarpon Springs, Fla., and preached there without\r\npay until his health began to fail. He died in Chicago, November 4, 1896.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to my friend, Capt. Nelson W. Evans, of Portsmouth, Ohio,\r\nfor the data of this story, he being a personal friend of “Lorena” and\r\nher husband—was a pall-bearer at the Judge’s funeral.\r\n\r\nFranklin, Tenn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Poem That Will Live\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are poems not written in verse, and this one, the dying request of\r\nEx-Governor Hogg, of Texas, is the greatest poem that has been written\r\nthis century:\r\n\r\n“I want no monument of stone, but let my children plant at the head of my\r\ngrave a pecan tree and at the foot of my grave a walnut tree, and when\r\nthese trees shall bear, let the pecans and walnuts be given out among the\r\nplain people of Texas, so that they may plant them and make Texas a land\r\nof trees.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgriculture the Basis of All Wealth\r\n\r\nBY WILLIAM DENNISON, FARGO, N. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgriculture is the basis of all wealth. It is the foundation upon which\r\nrests all the vast wealth which has been acquired in this country to-day.\r\nIt is also the buttress which protects, supports and defends all this\r\nacquired wealth. Without agriculture all this wealth would crumble\r\naway. Yet, is it not sad to contemplate that, while the tillers of the\r\nsoil have been building such a gigantic structure that they have not\r\nreceived a fair share of the spoils? They have been sowing while others\r\nreaped the reward. Presumably the farmers were to blame themselves for\r\nthe unequal division of the profits. It is a well-known fact, that\r\ncannot be controverted, that ever since the Pilgrim Fathers and the\r\nScotch-Irish landed on these shores they have been exploiting the land,\r\ntaking all they could get out of it and putting nothing back in return.\r\nThey surely could not expect that such conditions could last forever,\r\nbut that there would come a reckoning day sooner or later. That period\r\nof an accounting is long past due with the original settlers and is\r\npast due with more recent ones. That is, if we take into consideration\r\nthe great amount of knowledge which has been acquired agriculturally\r\nduring the last half of the nineteenth century, and with all the aids\r\nof fifty or more agricultural colleges scattered all over this great\r\ncountry. Yet nine-tenths of the tillers of the soil are still going on\r\nexploiting their land, and when failure comes they wonder why their land\r\ndoes not yield like it used to when they first broke it up and started\r\nto cultivate it. These agricultural colleges are grand institutions, and\r\ntheir object and aim is a noble one, that of helping the farmer, and\r\ncannot be too highly praised for their efforts. However, I am afraid that\r\na great majority of our farmers have received little or no benefit from\r\nthem. They are too scientific and technical for the average farmer to\r\nunderstand and derive any benefit therefrom. The average farmer wants it\r\nin simple language, in primary lessons, so that he can grasp it and then\r\nput it to the test. They know nothing about the chemical nomenclature\r\nwhich they use in expounding things. It is all Latin to them. What the\r\ntillers of the soil want is information on these subjects, in plain\r\nAnglo-Saxon, and as plain as possible even then.\r\n\r\nIt would be well for them to know what constitutes fertility, generally\r\nspeaking. There are three constituent elements of fertility, namely:\r\nnitrogen, phosphate and potash. The first element, nitrogen, is what\r\nmay be termed the motive power in the growing of the crops. There are\r\ninexhaustible supplies of this element in the atmosphere, and it only\r\nneeds to be brought down. It costs you nothing. Help yourself. But it\r\nis a very costly element if you have to purchase it as a commercial\r\ncommodity. Nitrogen, like the air we breathe, we can only use as we need\r\nit. It is a substance that cannot be cornered or there would have been\r\ntrusts formed in the country, making every farmer in the land pay tribute\r\nto them. The second member is a mineral element, phosphate. The first\r\ncondition necessary for the activity of a living organism is food. The\r\nfood of plants and animals, in some respects, is different, but both\r\nare alike in requiring a supply of certain mineral substances for their\r\nnourishment. One of the most essential constituents of this mineral\r\nfood is phosphoric acid. Without phosphates there can be neither growth\r\nnor life. This is why phosphates are so essential to worn-out land,\r\nespecially where wheat has been grown continuously.\r\n\r\nThe third is also a mineral element, which completes the trine in\r\nfertility. Such crops as the cereals draw mostly on the phosphates within\r\nthe soil; but a crop of potatoes draws mostly on the potash contained\r\nin the soil. You cannot go on indefinitely raising potatoes on the same\r\nland without furnishing potash. If you do, the tubers produced will\r\nbe entirely lacking in starchy matter and altogether too much gluten.\r\nWhen these three constituent elements of fertility are in the land\r\nand rightly balanced, then your land is in the highest condition of\r\nfertility. But if one of these elements is taken out by poor methods\r\nof farming, then your land, to use a horseman’s phrase, is said to be\r\nout of fettle. But in the next twenty-five years, when the farmers of\r\nthis country get down to hardpan, when the yield of their crops has\r\ndeteriorated to such a degree not only in the quantity of the product,\r\nbut also in the quality of the product, which is more important than\r\nquantity, in other words, when necessity compels them, then I look\r\nfor the fruits of the labors of the agricultural experiment colleges.\r\nRenewing the soil is analogous to the redemption of the soul of man.\r\nWe have the Word for it, and the promises are sure and steadfast; yet\r\nwe may have all the knowledge on the subject, but that will not obtain\r\neternal life. The Lord cannot save us unless we co-operate with him and\r\ndo our part. While I am, and always have been, an earnest advocate of the\r\ngreater use of legumes in restoring the fertility of our land, I am fully\r\nalive to the importance of putting back all the manure from the farmyard\r\nonto the land. I was raised on an extensive truck garden, and there is no\r\nreason to doubt the capacity of the soil to yield a product to which no\r\none can yet forecast the limit. As an instance of the possibilities of\r\nthe land under intensive culture, the Long Island market gardeners apply\r\nfrom seventy to eighty tons of stable manure to their early cabbages\r\nper acre, and as the plants are much closer and are much more sure to\r\nhead universally, a yield of fifty tons to the acre is not an excessive\r\nestimate. The above will show what can be done with a liberal supply of\r\nstable manure.\r\n\r\nBut why waste our time on what can be done with manure? Why, nine-tenths\r\nof the farmers in the United States don’t make any manure. Their stock,\r\nwhat they have, are all out on the run all, or nearly, the whole of the\r\nyear. I have come to the conclusion that to advocate intensive farming\r\nunder existing circumstances is not practical at the present time, when\r\nwe take into consideration the vastness of this country and likewise the\r\nremoteness of the great majority of the farmers from a home market. A\r\ngood home market is a great desideratum for our American farmer. Andrew\r\nCarnegie saw the paramount importance of a good home market when he was\r\nmaking his millions. But this idea alone does not show fully the sagacity\r\nof Andrew. It was when he discovered how he could perpetuate this good\r\nhome market when he overproduced his product, which was the case all\r\nof the time. He shipped his surplus product to foreign markets and\r\nsold it for about half what he was charging us at home. By this clever\r\nstroke he was enabled to make of non-effect the great law of supply and\r\ndemand. But in order to accomplish this Andrew had a high tariff on his\r\nproduct, and presumably he was smart enough to get rebates from the\r\nrailroad companies. But the farmers haven’t any tariff on the product\r\nthey raise and when they ship their products by railroads they have to\r\npay schedule rates and pay the entire freight to destination, no matter\r\nwhere the destination may be. But in the near future, when the population\r\nis largely increased and more evenly distributed, when the exodus will\r\nbe from the cities to the country, and not, as it is now, from the farm\r\nto the cities; when the smaller towns in every State have become towns\r\nand cities teeming with thousands of inhabitants, making a home market\r\nfor the farmers where they can sell, not only the cereals they raise,\r\nbut also milk, cattle, sheep, hogs, horses, hides, eggs and vegetables,\r\nthen will be the time to begin intensive farming and also the proper\r\nobservance of the rotation of their crops.\r\n\r\nBut it is the intervening time between now and then that we want to\r\nbridge over; but this period is going to be the crucial time for our\r\nfarmers. However, it is not going to be a situation without hope if the\r\ntillers of the soil do their part, but they have got to do that if their\r\nenvironment compels them to still keep on raising cereals. Now that the\r\nUnited States has taken the lead as a wheat raising country, I regret to\r\nstate that I can see no better way out of it than for them to still keep\r\non raising this cereal. But what we want to consider is how that can be\r\ndone and maintain the fertility of the land for some years to come.\r\n\r\nThis, I believe, is possible to every one who is willing to avail\r\nhimself of the means at hand. The experiments carried on at Rothamsteed\r\nshow conclusively that “continuous wheat-growing is, from a natural\r\npoint of view, an extravagant mode of farming, only justifiable, like\r\nother extravagances, under the pressure of a more or less artificial\r\nenvironment, for the wheat crop has completed its growth and is harvested\r\nlong before nitrification has ceased in the soil, and there is no crop\r\nto take up the balance formed after the active growth of the wheat is\r\nover, and these nitrates pass away in sub-soil drainage in mild, genial\r\nclimates, during the winter.” Under these circumstances, as soon as the\r\nwheat is harvested, then should we put in a catch crop, a legume suitable\r\nto the latitude, which would not only take up the balance of nitrates\r\nunused by the wheat crop, but would put a new supply of nitrogen into the\r\nsoil for the succeeding crop. The above applies to the latitudes where\r\nthey have long seasons and a moist, mild climate. This would not apply to\r\nthose latitudes where the seasons are short and exposed to long winter\r\nfrosts. To the wheat growers of the Northwest, where their seasons are\r\nshort, there is no time for a catch crop for them. I would advise to\r\nfallow their land as soon as the wheat crop is harvested. This would stop\r\nthe loss of nitrates and exterminate the great crop of weeds which takes\r\npossession after the wheat crop is harvested.\r\n\r\nFinally, to all, in whatever latitude you are situated, I would suggest\r\nthat you start in and treat your wheat land to an application of one\r\nthousand pounds of raw ground phosphate rock per acre. (It is cheap—it\r\nonly costs about four dollars per ton f. o. b. cars at the mine.) After\r\nspreading the phosphate on the land, plow and prepare your seed bed.\r\nIn the North sow your wheat and your red clover. The application of\r\nphosphates will give the legume a good start, and the following year a\r\nluxuriant growth of the legume may be expected, which will exterminate\r\nall weeds. Then, in the following spring break up your legume land,\r\nthe soil of which will be full of fiber, and receive the reward of\r\nthree continuous crops of wheat, greatly enhanced, both in quantity and\r\nquality. Then, on the fourth year another application of raw ground\r\nrock phosphate and a legume crop with it, followed by three years of\r\ncontinuous wheat again. During this time if you will add all the manure\r\nyou can, either a stable manure or ammonium salts, then I think you can\r\ngo on indefinitely raising wheat.\r\n\r\nFor confirmation of the merits of ground phosphate rock for worn-out\r\nwheat lands, consult Prof. Cyril G. Hopkins, director of the Illinois\r\nExperimental Station, Urbana, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wooing of Bessy\r\n\r\nBY L. M. MONTGOMERY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Lawrence Eastman began going to see Bessy Houghton the Lynnfield\r\npeople shrugged their shoulders and said he might have picked out\r\nsomebody a little younger and prettier—and then, of course, Bessy was\r\nwell off. A two hundred acre farm and a substantial bank account were\r\nworth going in for. Trust an Eastman for knowing upon which side his\r\nbread was buttered.\r\n\r\nLawrence was only twenty, and looked even younger, owing to his smooth,\r\nboyish face, curly hair, and half-girlish bloom. Bessy Houghton was in\r\nreality no more than twenty-five, but Lynnfield people had the impression\r\nthat she was past thirty. She had always been older than her years—a\r\nquiet, reserved girl who dressed plainly and never went about with other\r\nyoung people. Her mother had died when Bessy was very young, and she had\r\nalways kept house for her father. The responsibility made her grave and\r\nmature. When she was twenty her father died and Bessy was his sole heir.\r\nShe kept the farm and took the reins of government in her own capable\r\nhands. She made a success of it, too, which was more than many a man in\r\nLynnfield had done.\r\n\r\nBessy had never had a lover. She had never seemed like other girls, and\r\npassed for an old maid when her contemporaries were in the flush of\r\nsocial success and bloom.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eastman, Lawrence’s mother, was a widow with two sons. George, the\r\nolder, was the mother’s favorite, and the property had been willed to him\r\nby his father. To Lawrence had been left the few hundreds in the bank. He\r\nstayed at home and hired himself to George, thereby adding slowly to his\r\nsmall hoard. He had his eye on a farm in Lynnfield, but he was as yet a\r\nmere boy, and his plans for the future were very vague until he fell in\r\nlove with Bessy Houghton.\r\n\r\nIn reality nobody was more surprised over this than Lawrence himself.\r\nIt had certainly been the last thing in his thoughts on the dark, damp\r\nnight when he had overtaken Bessy walking home alone from prayer meeting\r\nand had offered to drive her the rest of the way.\r\n\r\nBessy assented and got into his buggy. At first she was very silent,\r\nand Lawrence, who was a bashful lad at the best of times, felt\r\ntongue-tied and uncomfortable. But presently Bessy, pitying his evident\r\nembarrassment, began to talk to him. She could talk well, and Lawrence\r\nfound himself entering easily into the spirit of her piquant speeches. He\r\nhad an odd feeling that he had never known Bessy Houghton before; he had\r\ncertainly never guessed that she could be such good company. She was very\r\ndifferent from the other girls he knew, but he decided that he liked the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\n“Are you going to the party at Bailey’s to-morrow night?” he asked, as he\r\nhelped her to alight at her door.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” she answered. “I’m invited—but I’m all alone—and parties\r\nhave never been very much in my line.”\r\n\r\nThere was a wistful note in her voice, and Lawrence, detecting it, said,\r\nhurriedly, not giving himself time to get frightened: “Oh, you’d better\r\ngo to this one. And if you like I’ll call around and take you.”\r\n\r\nHe wondered if she would think him very presumptuous. He thought her\r\nvoice sounded colder as she said: “I am afraid that it would be too much\r\ntrouble for you.”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t be any trouble at all,” he stammered. “I’ll be very pleased\r\nto take you.”\r\n\r\nIn the end Bessy had consented to go, and the next evening Lawrence\r\ncalled for her in the rose-red autumn dusk.\r\n\r\nBessy was ready and waiting. She was dressed in what was for her unusual\r\nelegance, and Lawrence wondered why people called Bessy Houghton so\r\nplain. Her figure was strikingly symmetrical and softly curved. Her\r\nabundant, dark-brown hair, instead of being parted plainly and drawn\r\nback into a prim coil, as usual, was dressed high on her head, and a\r\ncreamy rose nestled amid the becoming puffs and waves. She wore black, as\r\nshe always did, but it was a lustrous black silk, simply and fashionably\r\nmade, with frost-like frills of lace at her firm round throat and dainty\r\nwrists. Her cheeks were delicately flushed, and her wood-brown eyes were\r\nsparkling under her long lashes.\r\n\r\nShe offered him a half-opened bud for his coat and pinned it on for him.\r\nAs he looked down at her he noticed what a sweet mouth she had—full and\r\nred, with a half child-like curve.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Lawrence Eastman took Bessy Houghton to the Bailey’s party\r\nmade quite a sensation at that festal scene. People nodded and winked\r\nand wondered. “An old maid and her money,” said Milly Fiske spitefully.\r\nMilly, as was well known, had a liking for Lawrence herself.\r\n\r\nLawrence began to “go with” Bessy Houghton regularly after that. In his\r\nsingle-mindedness he never feared that Bessy would misjudge his motives\r\nor imagine him to be prompted by mercenary designs. He never thought of\r\nher riches himself, and it never occurred to him that she would suppose\r\nhe did.\r\n\r\nHe soon realized that he loved her, and he ventured to hope timidly\r\nthat she loved him in return. She was always rather reserved, but the\r\nfew favors that meant nothing from other girls meant a great deal from\r\nBessy. The evenings he spent with her in her pretty sitting room, their\r\nmoonlight drives over long, satin-smooth stretches of snowy roads, and\r\ntheir walks home from church and prayer meeting under the winter stars,\r\nwere all so many moments of supreme happiness to Lawrence.\r\n\r\nMatters had gone thus far before Mrs. Eastman got her eyes opened. At\r\nMrs. Tom Bailey’s quilting party an officious gossip took care to inform\r\nher that Lawrence was supposed to be crazy over Bessy Houghton, who was,\r\nof course, encouraging him simply for the sake of having some one to beau\r\nher round, and who would certainly throw him over in the end, since she\r\nknew perfectly well that it was her money he was after.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eastman was a proud woman and a determined one. She had always\r\ndisliked Bessy Houghton, and she went home from the quilting resolved to\r\nput an instant stop to “all such nonsense” on her son’s part.\r\n\r\n“Where is Lawrie?” she asked abruptly, as she entered the small kitchen\r\nwhere George Eastman was lounging by the fire.\r\n\r\n“Out in the stable grooming up Lady Gray,” responded her older son,\r\nsulkily. “I suppose he’s gadding off to see Bessy Houghton again, the\r\nyoung fool that he is! Why don’t you put a stop to it?”\r\n\r\n“I am going to put a stop to it,” said Mrs. Eastman grimly. “I’d have\r\ndone it before if I’d known. You should have told me of it if you knew.\r\nI’m going out to see Lawrence right now.”\r\n\r\nGeorge Eastman muttered something inaudible as the door closed behind\r\nher. He was a short, thick-set man, not in the least like Lawrence, who\r\nwas ten years his junior. Two years previously he had made a furtive\r\nattempt to pay court to Bessy Houghton for the sake of her wealth, and\r\nher decided repulse of his advances was a remembrance that made him grit\r\nhis teeth yet. He had hated her bitterly ever since.\r\n\r\nLawrence was brushing his pet mare’s coat until it shone like satin, and\r\nwhistling “Annie Laurie” until the rafters rang. Bessy had sung it for\r\nhim the night before. He could see her plainly still as she had looked\r\nthen, in her gown of vivid red—a color peculiarly becoming to her—with\r\nher favorite laces at wrist and throat and a white rose in her hair,\r\nwhich was dressed in the high, becoming knot she had always worn since\r\nthe night he had shyly told her he liked it so.\r\n\r\nShe had played and sung many of the sweet old Scotch ballads for him, and\r\nwhen she had gone to the door with him he had taken both her hands in his\r\nand, emboldened by the look in her brown eyes, he had stooped and kissed\r\nher. Then he had stepped back, filled with dismay at his own audacity.\r\nBut Bessy had said no word of rebuke, and only blushed hotly crimson.\r\nShe must care for him, he thought happily, or else she would have been\r\nangry.\r\n\r\nWhen his mother came in at the stable door her face was hard and\r\nuncompromising.\r\n\r\n“Lawrie,” she said sharply, “where are you going again to-night? You were\r\nout last night.”\r\n\r\n“Well, mother, I promise you I wasn’t in any bad company. Come now, don’t\r\nquiz a fellow too close.”\r\n\r\n“You are going to dangle after Bessy Houghton again. It’s time you were\r\ntold what a fool you were making of yourself. She’s old enough to be your\r\nmother. The whole settlement is laughing at you.”\r\n\r\nLawrence looked as if his mother had struck him a blow in the face. A\r\ndull, purplish flush crept over his brow.\r\n\r\n“This is some of George’s work,” he broke out fiercely. “He’s been\r\nsetting you on me, has he? Yes, he’s jealous—he wanted Bessy himself, but\r\nshe would not look at him. He thinks nobody knows it, but I do. Bessy\r\nmarry him? It’s very likely!”\r\n\r\n“Lawrie Eastman, you are daft. George hasn’t said anything to me. You\r\nsurely don’t imagine Bessy Houghton would marry you. And if she would,\r\nshe is too old for you. Now, don’t you hang around her any longer.”\r\n\r\n“I will,” said Lawrence flatly. “I don’t care what anybody says. You\r\nneedn’t worry over me. I can take care of myself.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Eastman looked blankly at her son. He had never defied or disobeyed\r\nher in his life before. She had supposed her word would be law. Rebellion\r\nwas something she had not dreamed of. Her lips tightened ominously and\r\nher eyes narrowed.\r\n\r\n“You’re a bigger fool than I took you for,” she said in a voice that\r\ntrembled with anger. “Bessy Houghton laughs at you everywhere. She knows\r\nyou’re just after her money, and she makes fun”—\r\n\r\n“Prove it,” interrupted Lawrence undauntedly. “I’m not going to put any\r\nfaith in Lynnfield gossip. Prove it if you can.”\r\n\r\n“I can prove it. Maggie Hatfield told me what Bessy Houghton said to her\r\nabout you. She said you were a lovesick fool, and she only went with you\r\nfor a little amusement; and that if you thought you had nothing to do but\r\nmarry her and hang up your hat there you’d find yourself vastly mistaken.”\r\n\r\nPossibly in her calmer moments Mrs. Eastman might have shrunk from such a\r\ndeliberate falsehood, although it was said of her in Lynnfield that she\r\nwas not one to stick at a lie when the truth would not serve her purpose.\r\nMoreover, she felt quite sure that Lawrence would never ask Maggie\r\nHatfield anything about it.\r\n\r\nLawrence turned white to the lips. “Is that true, mother?” he asked,\r\nhuskily.\r\n\r\n“I’ve warned you,” replied his mother, not choosing to repeat her\r\nstatement. “If you go after Bessy any more you can take the consequences.”\r\n\r\nShe drew her shawl About her pale, malicious face and left him with a\r\nparting glance of contempt.\r\n\r\n“I guess that’ll settle him,” she thought grimly. “Bessy Houghton turned\r\nup her nose at George, but she shan’t make a fool of Lawrence, too.”\r\n\r\nAlone in the stable Lawrence stood staring out at the dull red ball of\r\nthe winter sun with unseeing eyes. He had implicit faith in his mother,\r\nand the stab had gone straight to his heart. Bessy Houghton listened in\r\nvain that night for his well-known footfall on the veranda.\r\n\r\nThe next night Lawrence went home with Milly Fiske from prayer meeting,\r\ntaking her out from a crowd of other girls under Bessy Houghton’s very\r\neyes as she came down the steps of the little church.\r\n\r\nBessy walked home alone. The light burned low in her sitting room, and in\r\nthe mirror over the mantel she saw her own pale face, with its tragic,\r\npain-stricken eyes. Annie Hillis, her “help,” was out. She was alone in\r\nthe big house with her misery and despair.\r\n\r\nShe went dizzily upstairs to her own room and flung herself on the bed in\r\nthe chill moonlight.\r\n\r\n“It is all over,” she said, dully. All night she lay there, fighting with\r\nher pain. In the wan, gray morning she looked at her mirrored self with\r\npitying scorn—at the pallid face, the lifeless features, the dispirited\r\neyes with their bluish circles.\r\n\r\n“What a fool I have been to imagine he could care for me!” she said,\r\nbitterly. “He has only been amusing himself with my folly. And to think\r\nthat I let him kiss me the other night!”\r\n\r\nShe thought of that kiss with a pitiful shame. She hated herself for\r\nthe weakness that could not check her tears. Her lonely life had been\r\nbrightened by the companionship of her young lover. The youth and\r\ngirlhood of which fate had cheated her had come to her with love; the\r\nfuture had looked rosy with promise; now it had darkened with dourness\r\nand grayness.\r\n\r\nMaggie Hatfield came that day to sew. Bessy had intended to have a\r\ndark-blue silk made up and an evening waist of pale pink cashmere. She\r\nhad expected to wear the latter at a party which was to come off a\r\nfortnight later, and she had got it to please Lawrence, because he had\r\ntold her that pink was his favorite color. She would have neither it nor\r\nthe silk made up now. She put them both away and instead brought out an\r\nugly pattern of snuff-brown stuff, bought years before and never used.\r\n\r\n“But where is your lovely pink, Bessy?” asked the dressmaker. “Aren’t you\r\ngoing to have it for the party?”\r\n\r\n“No, I’m not going to have it made up at all,” said Bessy, listlessly.\r\n“It’s too gay for me. I was foolish to think it would ever suit me. This\r\nbrown will do for a spring suit. It doesn’t make much difference what I\r\nwear.”\r\n\r\nMaggie Hatfield, who had not been at prayer meeting the night before, and\r\nknew nothing of what had occurred, looked at her curiously, wondering\r\nwhat Lawrence Eastman could see in her to be as crazy about her as some\r\npeople said he was. Bessy was looking her oldest and plainest just then,\r\nwith her hair combed severely back from her pale, dispirited face.\r\n\r\n“It must be her money he is after,” thought the dressmaker. “She looks\r\nover thirty, and she can’t pretend to be pretty. I believe she thinks a\r\nlot of him, though.”\r\n\r\nFor the most part, Lynnfield people believed that Bessy had thrown\r\nLawrence over. This opinion was borne out by his woe-begone appearance.\r\nHe was thin and pale; his face had lost its youthful curves and looked\r\nhard and mature. He was moody and taciturn and his speech and manner were\r\nmarked by a new cynicism.\r\n\r\nIn April a well-to-do storekeeper from an adjacent village began to court\r\nBessy Houghton. He was over fifty, and had never been a handsome man in\r\nhis best days, but Lynnfield oracles opined that Bessy would take him.\r\nShe couldn’t expect to do any better, they said, and she was looking\r\nterribly old and dowdy all at once.\r\n\r\nIn June Maggie Hatfield went to the Eastman’s to sew. The first bit of\r\nnews she imparted to Mrs. Eastman was that Bessy Houghton had refused\r\nJabez Lea—at least, he didn’t come to see her any more.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eastman twitched her thread viciously. “Bessy Houghton was born an\r\nold maid,” she said sharply. “She thinks nobody is good enough for her,\r\nthat is what’s the matter. Lawrence got some silly boy-notion into his\r\nhead last winter, but I soon put a stop to that.”\r\n\r\n“I always had an idea that Bessy thought a good deal of Lawrence,” said\r\nMaggie. “She has never been the same since he left off going with her. I\r\nwas up there the morning after that prayer meeting night people talked\r\nso much of, and she looked positively dreadful, as if she hadn’t slept a\r\nwink the whole night.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!!” said Mrs. Eastman decisively. “She would never think of\r\ntaking a boy like him when she’d turned up her nose at better men. And\r\nI didn’t want her for a daughter-in-law, anyhow. I can’t bear her. So\r\nI put my foot down in time. Lawrence sulked for a spell, of course—boy\r\nfashion—and he’s been as fractious as a spoiled baby ever since.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I dare say you’re right,” assented the dressmaker. “But I must\r\nsay I had always imagined that Bessy had a great notion of Lawrence. Of\r\ncourse, she’s so quiet it is hard to tell. She never says a word about\r\nherself.”\r\n\r\nThere was an unsuspected listener to this conversation. Lawrence had\r\ncome in from the field for a drink, and was standing in the open kitchen\r\ndoorway, within easy earshot of the women’s shrill tones.\r\n\r\nHe had never doubted his mother’s word at any time in his life, but\r\nnow he knew beyond doubt that there had been crooked work somewhere.\r\nHe shrank from believing his mother untrue, yet where else could the\r\ncrookedness come in?\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Eastman had gone to the kitchen to prepare dinner Maggie\r\nHatfield was startled by the appearance of Lawrence at the low, open\r\nwindow of the sitting room.\r\n\r\n“Mercy me, how you scared me!” she exclaimed nervously.\r\n\r\n“Maggie,” said Lawrence seriously, “I want to ask you a question. Did\r\nBessy Houghton ever say anything to you about me or did you ever say that\r\nshe did? Give me a straight answer.”\r\n\r\nThe dressmaker peered at him curiously.\r\n\r\n“No. Bessy never so much as mentioned your name to me,” she said, “and I\r\nnever heard that she did to any one else. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Thank you. That was all I wanted to know,” said Lawrence, ignoring her\r\nquestion, and disappearing as suddenly as he had come.\r\n\r\nThat evening at moonrise he passed through the kitchen dressed in his\r\nSunday best. His mother met him at the door.\r\n\r\n“Where are you going?” she asked querulously.\r\n\r\nLawrence looked her squarely in the face with accusing eyes, before which\r\nher own quailed.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to see Bessy Houghton, mother,” he said sternly, “and to ask\r\nher pardon for believing the lie that has kept us apart so long.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Eastman flushed crimson and opened her lips to speak. But something\r\nin Lawrence’s grave, white face silenced her. She turned away without a\r\nword, knowing in her secret soul that her youngest born was lost to her\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nLawrence found Bessy in the orchard under apple trees that were pyramids\r\nof pearly bloom. She looked at him through the twilight with reproach and\r\naloofness in her eyes. But he put out his hands and caught her reluctant\r\nones in a masterful grasp.\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, Bessy. Don’t condemn me before you’ve heard me. I’ve\r\nbeen to blame for believing falsehoods about you, but I believe them no\r\nlonger, and I’ve come to ask you to forgive me.”\r\n\r\nHe told his story simply and straightforwardly. In strict justice he\r\ncould not keep his mother’s name out of it, but he merely said she had\r\nbeen mistaken. Perhaps Bessy understood none the less. She knew what Mrs.\r\nEastman’s reputation in Lynnfield was.\r\n\r\n“You might have had a little more faith in me,” she cried reproachfully.\r\n\r\n“I know—I know. But I was beside myself with pain and wretchedness. Oh,\r\nBessy, won’t you forgive me? I love you so! If you send me away I’ll go\r\nto the dogs. Forgive me, Bessy.”\r\n\r\nAnd she, being a woman, did forgive him.\r\n\r\n“I’ve loved you from the first, Lawrence,” she said, yielding to his\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_I am the product of the centuries. I am the child of the aeons which\r\nwere. I have always been and I shall always be. To make me it has taken\r\nfire, water, star-dust, the Spirit of God, the lives of a million people\r\nand the lights of a million suns. I have grown from heat and star-dust\r\nto the Thing Which Thinks. What has happened to me has been good: what\r\nshall happen will be better, for I am Evolution, and Evolution goes ever\r\nupward. Life has been good, Death will be better, for I am the Cause of\r\nall the Past, making toward one great Effect. My debt to the Past is\r\ngreat. Let me in part repay it by doing the best I can, following the\r\nlight within me. And the clearest light is Kindness._\r\n\r\n                                                      JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe History of the Hals\r\n\r\nTHE FATHER OF THE TURF IN TENNESSEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nBy JOHN TROTWOOD MOORE\r\n\r\nThe other day I inquired of Uncle Berry how he thought Maria would\r\ncompare with the best horses of the present day. In reply he said: “If\r\nI were forty and Maria four years of age, I would not want a greater\r\nfortune than I could win with her at Fordham and Saratago.”\r\n\r\nHe thinks the improvement in training and the condition of race tracks\r\naccounts for the difference in time of this and former days. He thinks if\r\nthe horses of the present day were galloped, in sweats, sixteen or twenty\r\nmiles under eight or ten Mackinaw blankets, and every morning and evening\r\ngalloped four miles and repeat under two or three blankets and ran their\r\nraces on deep, heavy tracks, as formerly, they would make slow time, and\r\nvery few of them would be seen on the turf at the age of nine years, and\r\nI agree with him.\r\n\r\nIn old times, in cases of severe fevers, doctors excluded the fresh air\r\nand wrapped their patients in blankets, and gave them warm water to\r\ndrink. The first cargo of Yankee ice brought to New Orleans was thrown\r\ninto the Mississippi by an order of the Mayor, under advice from the\r\nmedical board.\r\n\r\nI believe that it is conceded that Flying Childers and O’Kelly’s\r\nEclipse were the fastest horses the world has ever produced, or, in the\r\nexpressive language of John Randolph, “they were the swiftest quadrupeds\r\nthat ever appeared upon the earth.” Childers was the son of Darley’s\r\nArabian, and Eclipse was his great-great-grandson, and the dam of Eclipse\r\nwas by Regulus, the best son of Godolphin’s Arabian. These two Arabians\r\nwere the “diamonds of the desert”—the pure fountains with which we are\r\ndelighted to connect our thoroughbreds by the unbroken links of an\r\nextended chain. The third dam of her sire, imported Diomed, was by Flying\r\nChilders and he by Darley’s Arabian (1). The seventh dam of Diomed\r\nwas by Spanker, he by Young Marsque, he by Marsque (sire of O’Kelly’s\r\nEclipse), he by Squint, he by Bartlett’s Childers (own brother to Flying\r\nChilders) and he by Darley’s Arabian. (2) Diomed was by Florizel, whose\r\nthird dam was by Flying Childers. (3) Florizel was by King Herod, whose\r\nfourth dam was by Darley’s Arabian. (4) The dam of Herod was by Blaze,\r\nand he by Flying Childers. (5) The dam of Diomed was by Spectator, whose\r\nthird dam was by Darley’s Arabian. (6) The second dam of Diomed was\r\nby Blank, whose dam was by Bartlett’s Childers, own brother to Flying\r\nChilders (7), making seven courses of Darley’s Arabian through Diomed,\r\nthree of which are through Flying Childers and two through his own\r\nbrother, Bartlett’s Childers.\r\n\r\nThe dam of Maria was by Taylor’s Bel-Air (the best son of Imported\r\nMedley). Medley’s fourth dam was by Bartlett’s Childers (1). Medley was\r\nby Gimcrack and he by Cripple, whose second dam was by Flying Childers\r\n(2). Medley’s second dam was by Snap, he by Snip, and he by Flying\r\nChilders (3), making three courses of Darley’s Arabian through her dam,\r\ntwo of which are by Flying Childers and one through Bartlett’s Childers,\r\nmaking in all ten crosses of Darley’s Arabian in Maria’s pedigree,\r\nfive of which are through Flying Childers and three through Bartlett’s\r\nChilders. Maria has the following crosses of the Godolphin Arabian: The\r\nsecond dam of Diomed was by Blank and he by the Godolphin (1). Bel-Air\r\nwas by imported Medley, he by Gim Crack, he by Cripple and he by the\r\nGodolphin (2). The second dam of Bel-Air was by Black Selima, by imported\r\nFearnought and he by Regulus, the best son of Godolphin (3). The third\r\ndam of Bel-Air was imported Selima by the Godolphin (4). If the imported\r\nmare to which Maria traces could be identified she would probably add\r\nseveral additional crosses of these famous Arabs.\r\n\r\nFor the performances of Maria I have relied mainly upon her memoir\r\npublished in the sixth volume of the American Turf Register, which was\r\nwritten by Judge Thos. Barry, of Gallatin, who obtained the facts from\r\nCaptain Haney in his lifetime, which are corroborated substantially by\r\nUncle Berry.\r\n\r\nIn my last communication, in referring to the race of Blucher and\r\nWalk-in-the-Water at Natchez, I made a mistake as the time when the\r\nJockey Club changed the rule taking twenty-one pounds off of Blucher. It\r\nwas not done the night before the race, as stated, but it occurred some\r\ntime before. It was the evening before the race that Col. A. L. Bingaman,\r\na member of the Club, moved to have the rule rescinded so as to make\r\ntheir weight equal, but his motion was voted down, and Blucher carried\r\none hundred pounds and Walk-in-the-Water one hundred and twenty-one\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nB. C. Oscar, foaled in spring of 1814, bred by the Rev. Hubbard Saunders,\r\nof Sumner County, Tennessee, stood without a rival on the Tennessee turf\r\nin his day. He never paid a forfeit or lost a heat, nor did he ever meet\r\na competitor able to put him to his top speed. His pedigree is not only\r\npure, but rich and choice. He was got by Wilkes’ Wonder (he by Imported\r\nDiomed out of Mary Gray by Tippoo Saib, the dam of Pacolet).\r\n\r\nFirst dam—Rosey Clack, by Imp. Saltram.\r\n\r\nSecond dam—Camilla, by Symmes’ Wildair, the best son of Imp. Fearnought.\r\n\r\nThird dam—Minerva, by Imp. Obscurity.\r\n\r\nFourth dam—Diana, by Clodius.\r\n\r\nFifth dam—Sally Painter, by Imp. Sterling.\r\n\r\nSixth dam—Imp Silver, by Belsize Arabian.\r\n\r\nSeventh dam—By Croft’s Partner.\r\n\r\nEighth dam—Sister to Roxana, by Bald Galloway.\r\n\r\nNinth dam—By Akaster Turk.\r\n\r\nTenth dam—By Leeds’ Arabian.\r\n\r\nEleventh dam—By Spanker.\r\n\r\nThis pedigree, in the language of my late friend, the Rev. Hardy M.\r\nCryer, “is pure as the icicle which hung at the north corner of Diana’s\r\nTemple.”\r\n\r\nOscar was a dark bay, of uniform color, with black points, full fifteen\r\nhands three inches high, owned and run by that high-toned gentleman, Dr.\r\nRoger B. Sappington, of Nashville. He was a horse of commanding presence,\r\npossessing great power, especially in the shoulders and chest, in which\r\nhe resembled the lion, high, oblique withers, short back, prominent hips,\r\nhindquarters rather light, when contrasted with his shoulders and chest,\r\nstifles and hocks excellent and limbs superior, hind feet well under him,\r\nwith a head, eye and windpipe which could not be surpassed. He reminded\r\nme of Uncle Berry’s answer to my questions about the head, limbs and\r\naction of Ball’s Florizel. He said: “His head was all mouth and nostrils,\r\nand he could stand with all his feet in a washtub.” Oscar won his first\r\nrace, a sweepstake, in October, 1817, over the Nashville course, two\r\nmile heats, one hundred dollars entrance, which he won with the greatest\r\nease, beating Mr. James Jackson’s McDhane (by imported Eagle, out of his\r\nimported mare, Virginia, by imported Daredevil) and Dr. Butler’s splendid\r\nfilly, by Pacolet. The next day he walked over the course for the club\r\npurse.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1818, he won over the same course a jockey club purse, four\r\nmile heats, beating with ease General Jackson’s Gun Boat, by Pacolet.\r\nGun Boat was withdrawn after the first heat. In October, 1818, over the\r\nsame course, he won the jockey club purse, four-mile heats, beating with\r\nease at two heats, Mr. Morton’s horse, by Potomac, and Colonel Elliott’s\r\n(Uncle Berry’s) horse, by imported Whip. This Whip colt belonged to Uncle\r\nBerry, whose history is as follows: Uncle Berry volunteered in Capt.\r\nJohn W. Byrns’ light-horse company early in the Creek War and served out\r\nhis term under Gen. Jackson, for which he now is and has been for about\r\ntwelve months in the receipt of a pension of ninety-six dollars per\r\nannum, payable quarterly. He commenced to receive this pension under the\r\nlate Act of Congress, in the ninety-fifth year of his age. He said to me\r\nthe other day: “I am sorry the government don’t pay it all at once, for\r\ntwenty-four dollars won’t buy anything, and it is always gone before the\r\nnext payment arrives.” When his term of service expired he was about to\r\nre-volunteer, but Colonel Elliott, who was then in command of a regiment\r\nin the army, persuaded him to return home and look after the women and\r\nchildren and blood stock, which he reluctantly consented to do. After\r\nspending some time in Tennessee, he visited a friend, Colonel Faulkner,\r\nof Garrard County, Ky., who invited him to examine a lot of two-year-old\r\ncolts, some of which he contemplated entering in a sweepstake, to come\r\noff the ensuing fall. On returning to the house, Mrs. Faulkner inquired\r\nof Uncle Berry what he thought of her colt, to which he replied: “I\r\nconsider him, Madam, the best of the lot,” at which she was very much\r\ngratified and begged that he would enter, train and run the colt in the\r\nstake, to which he consented, and won the race with ease. He purchased\r\nthis colt of Mrs. Faulkner, brought him to Tennessee, where he won\r\nseveral races, and was entered by Colonel Elliott in the four-mile race\r\nagainst Oscar, as above stated.\r\n\r\nIt was about the time of Oscar’s appearance on the turf that the first\r\nJockey Club was established at Nashville, by the most distinguished men\r\nof Tennessee, among them General Jackson, Colonel Ed. Ward, General\r\nCarroll, James Jackson, Dr. Sappington, Dr. Shelby, Dr. McNairy, Dr.\r\nButler, William Williams, Colonel Elliott, Newton Cannon and other\r\nleading citizens of the State.\r\n\r\nDuring the absence of Colonel Elliott and Uncle Berry, Dr. Sappington\r\nemployed Monkey Simon to ride for him, and when the race last above\r\nmentioned came off, Simon rode Oscar against Whip, the latter owned and\r\nrun by his old friends and favorites, Col. Elliott and Uncle Berry. Some\r\nuneasiness was manifested by the friends of Oscar, who was high-strung\r\nand difficult to control, lest Simon should suffer himself to exhaust\r\nhimself early and thereby lose the race. This suspicion was altogether\r\ngroundless, for Simon always rode to win, if possible, and if he had a\r\nweakness it was in being too eager for success in a close contest. At the\r\ntap of the drum Oscar went off under a tremendous head of steam, and, in\r\nspite of all Simon’s exertions to restrain him, was soon fifty or sixty\r\nyards ahead, which served to increase the doubts of Simon’s fidelity. Dr.\r\nShelby dashed across the field and ordered Simon in a most peremptory\r\ntone to hold his horse, to which Simon replied, in his characteristic\r\nstyle: “You d—d fool, don’t you see his mouth is wide open?” And Simon\r\nwould have made the same reply to General Jackson under the same\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe General said to Simon on one occasion, just before the horses started\r\nin a very important race: “Now, Simon, when my horse comes up and is\r\nabout to pass you, don’t spit your tobacco juice in his eyes and the\r\neyes of his rider, as you sometimes do;” to which Simon replied: “Well,\r\nGineral, I’ve rode a good deal agin your horses, but (with an oath) none\r\nwere ever near enough to catch my spit.” On another occasion, after Maria\r\nhad beaten the General’s favorite, Pacolet, and when no friend dared\r\nto take a liberty with him, Simon, meeting him in a large crowd, said:\r\n“Gineral, you were always ugly, but now you’re a show. I could make a\r\nfortune by showing you as you now look if I had you in a cage where you\r\ncould not hurt the people who come to look at you.”\r\n\r\nMany years ago I was riding on horseback with Colonel Elliott to the\r\nNashville races, and when we reached a point about one mile from the\r\nferry at Nashville, on the Gallatin road, he observed: “Here is the place\r\nwhere negroes were annually hired in old times, and where I have often\r\nhired Simon, who, on account of his deformity and dissipated habits,\r\nusually cost me from twelve to fifteen dollars per annum. On one occasion\r\nCol. Robert C. Foster, guardian of the minor children to whom Simon\r\nbelonged, conceiving it to be his duty, bid against me and ran Simon up\r\nto thirty-odd dollars, the then price of a good field hand. I concluded\r\nto drop Simon on the Colonel’s hands and take the chance of hiring him\r\nprivately. Simon watched the bidding with the deepest interest, as he was\r\nmost anxious to remain in the stable and enjoy the fame and emoluments of\r\nriding Haney’s Maria and other distinguished winners. When I indicated\r\nthat I would bid no more, Simon turned to the Colonel and said, in his\r\npeculiarly sarcastic manner, with his head laid back and one eye closed:\r\n‘Colonel Foster, by G—, I am not a sellin’ but hirin’ for only one year.’\r\nThe Colonel, who was a man of high spirit and great dignity, replied,\r\nshaking his cane at Simon: ‘You impudent scoundrel, do you know who you\r\nare talking to?’ Simon, with the most aggravating coolness, replied: ‘I\r\nthink I do, and if I am not mistaken, you are the same gentleman who made\r\na small ’speriment for governor once,’ alluding to a race the Colonel had\r\nmade for governor, under very unfavorable circumstances, in which he was\r\nbadly beaten. The witticism of Simon created much mirth, amidst which\r\nColonel Elliott got him at the next bid.”\r\n\r\nThe purses at that period were unworthy of the attention of so superior a\r\nhorse, and Dr. Sappington had neither the means nor disposition to travel\r\nor run him for heavy matches; Oscar was, therefore, when sound in all\r\nrespects and in the prime of his racing career, withdrawn from the turf\r\nand died at eleven years old, the property of General R. Desha and Mr.\r\nIsaac Bledsoe, of Sumner County, where he left some fine running stock,\r\nalthough he never served more than two or three thoroughbred mares.\r\n\r\nThe above ends Bailie Peyton’s interesting reminiscences of early horses\r\nand horsemen. Mr. Peyton passed away many years ago, but his name will\r\nlive in the political and horse history of the State. He was a remarkable\r\nman, a gentleman of the old school, a lawyer and a politician who ranked\r\nwith the great men of his day, while his knowledge on the subject quoted\r\nabove is authority.\r\n\r\nHis interesting account of the early historical horse reminds me of\r\nanother incident, with which I shall close this chapter, being in line\r\nwith the account of Mr. Peyton, the story of a pair of horses that\r\nhelped make American history.\r\n\r\nHorses have figured so often in the affairs of our country—they\r\nhave helped us out of so many close places, so to speak—that a most\r\ninteresting book could be written about the historical horses of America.\r\nThere was Washington’s famous war horse, Paul Revere’s sprinter,\r\nSheridan’s charger, General Lee’s Traveler, Stonewall Jackson’s old\r\nsorrel, Gen. John Adams’ old Charley, who died on the breastworks of\r\nFranklin—in fact, as I said, a most readable book could be written of the\r\nhistorical horses of America.\r\n\r\nTo-day I shall write about a pair of horses which played a most important\r\npart in a most critical moment of our history. We have single horses in\r\nplenty which have gone hand in hand with man in making history and fame,\r\nbut this is the only instance in our history that I can find where a pair\r\nof horses accomplished the purpose. It is a part of the unwritten history\r\nof the West, but every word of it is true, as I have been able to gather\r\nit from old letters of pioneers, and old histories long since gone out of\r\nprint.\r\n\r\nThe most critical period of American history was that right after the\r\nRevolutionary war, when the States were debating on the question of the\r\nnew constitution and the West—Kentucky, Tennessee and Ohio—were uncertain\r\nwhether they had any rights which anybody else was bound to respect.\r\n\r\nFor the first ten years after the Revolutionary war the most dangerous\r\nfoe the young Republic had was the great, but waning empire of Spain. At\r\nthat time the States were a narrow strip on the Atlantic stretching from\r\nMaine to Florida, and practically bounded by the Appalachian Mountains.\r\nEngland had large claims on the Great Lakes and extending down nearly\r\nto the Ohio, and Spain owned nearly everything else, holding all the\r\nterritory bordering on the Gulf from Florida to Mexico, extending up\r\ninto the present States of Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. In this\r\ninstance Louisiana meant really all that vast domain which lay west of\r\nthe Mississippi, stretching clear up to the present State of Oregon.\r\nThe great Mississippi river flowed for a long way through Spanish\r\npossessions, and Spain, foolhardy and narrow then as to-day, and wishing\r\nto do the young Republic all the harm she could, closed the river to\r\nAmerican commerce, an act which meant stagnation and ruin to the young\r\nterritories of the West. For these border settlers were altogether an\r\nagricultural people and a great wilderness infested by hostile Indians\r\nlay between them and the older States. What they raised for sale had to\r\npass down the Mississippi river.\r\n\r\nAnd they increased rapidly in Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky, and,\r\nmoreover, they were of that stock of people who would not be fooled with.\r\nThey looked upon the great river as God-given and they did not understand\r\nhow an arrogant nation living across the ocean, could deprive them of\r\ntheir natural rights. But that was not all. Spain was then as now cruel\r\nand vindictive, and while professing friendship for these people she\r\nsecretly armed the savages and encouraged them to kill all the settlers\r\nwest of the Alleghanies. And that they came near doing this the early\r\nrecords of Tennessee and Kentucky attest. The Indians murdered them day\r\nand night. But for a few heroic men and Indian fighters like Sevier,\r\nRobertson and Shelby, they had been entirely exterminated. But they\r\nincreased in spite of everything, and naturally accumulating both in\r\nnumbers and products, they wanted a market for their stuff. They asked\r\naid of Congress, but Congress seemed to have troubles of her own just\r\nthen and paid no attention to them, except to send John Jay over to treat\r\nwith Spain about it. But Jay could do nothing, and it seems fell into the\r\nSpanish idea, for he sent in a report to Congress recommending a treaty\r\nwith Spain which should close the Mississippi to commerce for twenty-five\r\nyears. Jay explained that the right to use the river could only be\r\nacquired by a war with Spain, for which the United States was unprepared;\r\nthat the matter was not important now, and that in twenty-five years\r\nthe country would be strong enough to do as they wished. New York, New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania and New England voted for this resolution, but the\r\nSouthern States opposed it, and it failed to pass by only two votes.\r\n\r\nThe Western people became indignant. Public meetings were held everywhere\r\nfrom the Watauga settlement, in East Tennessee, to Kentucky, and\r\nthe remoter West. “To inclose us in a Chinese wall, to prohibit the\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi, to sell us and make us vassals to the\r\nmerciless Spaniards, is a grievance not to be borne,” they said. So great\r\nwas their discontent that strong talk was indulged in, and it began to be\r\nfeared that they would have to organize a government of their own, since\r\ntheir own Congress would give them no assistance. The attorney-general\r\nof Kentucky wrote to the President of Congress: “I am decidedly of the\r\nopinion that this Western country will, in a few years, act for itself\r\nand erect an independent government; for under the present system we\r\ncannot exert our strength, neither does Congress seem disposed to help\r\nus.” In fact, things soon came to such a pass that one of two things\r\nwould happen: the West would form a government of their own or the\r\nMississippi must be opened for them. I shall show how a smart, brainy\r\nrascal and a pair of Kentucky geldings accomplished the opening of the\r\nriver and saved the West to the Union.\r\n\r\nJames Wilkerson was his name, and a smoother, brainier, more ambitious\r\nand more unscrupulous scamp never figured but once before in American\r\nhistory—and that was his prototype, Aaron Burr. I have no space for his\r\nhistory. Suffice to say that he was one of the cabal who rose to some\r\nprominence in the war and who tried to oust Washington and put Gates\r\nin command of the army. Later events proved him to be an unscrupulous\r\npolitician, and he moved to Kentucky. Kentucky must have had great horses\r\neven in those days, for Wilkerson got rich trading. He had a fine eye for\r\ngood horses, and in his trafficking he got hold of a pair of beautiful\r\ngeldings. Pork in the West was only a dollar and a half per hundred,\r\ncorn ten cents a bushel and tobacco rotting in the fields, all owing to\r\nthe great river being closed to American commerce. Wilkerson conceived a\r\nbrilliant idea. He could get fabulous prices for all these articles in\r\nthe Spanish city of New Orleans. He loaded an immense flat boat—several\r\nof them—with these articles and set them afloat on the great river. He\r\nhimself got up a handsome retinue, took a pair of beautiful geldings and\r\nwent overland to the first Spanish fort at Natchez. It was a big risk he\r\nran, for it had been tried before, and every time the Spanish garrison\r\nhad stopped the boats with their guns, called them in and confiscated\r\nthe cargoes. Wilkerson went right to the Spanish commander, Don Gayoso\r\nde Lamos, at Natchez, who was a scamp after Wilkerson’s own heart, and\r\nthere he began his game. He fascinated Lamos with his talk, his elegance,\r\nhis wit and his learning. He convinced Lamos that he was the greatest and\r\nmost influential man in the West, and could command an army of twenty\r\nthousand Westerners. He got Lamos drunk—no difficult task—and finally,\r\nas the flat boats neared, he began to talk horse to him. Mr. Lamos loved\r\na good one, too—in fact he could talk on that subject all night, and so\r\nhe and Wilkerson played cards and drank wine and talked horse until they\r\nbecame boon chums and companions. But all the time Wilkerson was holding\r\nback his trump card for the last. He kept the beautiful pair of Kentucky\r\ngeldings safely in the background, well groomed and on their mettle.\r\nThen his men reported that his boats were coming—that they would be\r\nunder the guns of Natchez the next day. Early that day Wilkerson brought\r\nout his beautiful geldings and called on the charming Mr. Don Gayoso de\r\nLamos. Would Mr. Don walk with him to the grass plat on the bluff? Would\r\nhe accept a trifling little gift, a token of his great admiration and\r\neverlasting friendship for the mighty Mr. Don? Certainly he would. No one\r\never heard of a Don refusing anything. When the blankets were taken off\r\nthe Don could not contain his admiration. What beauties they were! How\r\ntheir coats shone! He hugged Wilkerson and then he hugged the horses. He\r\ntalked fast and his eyes glittered and he was immensely merry. Then a gun\r\nboomed from the fort.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked the Don.\r\n\r\n“It was some flat boats loaded with produce,” so said the officer, “and\r\nmust he sink them or call them in?”\r\n\r\nThen Wilkerson explained carelessly that they were his, going to New\r\nOrleans, and that he had on them some trifling things like butter and\r\neggs and tobacco for his Majesty’s people there, and he hoped they might\r\nbe allowed to pass on.\r\n\r\nThe Don looked at the boats and he looked at the officer and then he\r\nlooked long and lovingly at the horses—and they won, by a neck. He waved\r\nhis hand to the officer and said:\r\n\r\n“Let them pass. Let them report to Miro, at New Orleans.”\r\n\r\nAnd so Wilkerson and his horses won, and for the first time an American\r\ncargo went down the great river unmolested.\r\n\r\nAt New Orleans Wilkerson played a different game. He tried to wheedle\r\nand frighten the Spanish commander by turns. He told him he could bring\r\nenough riflemen there to wipe out Spain’s troops, but that in reality the\r\nWesterners were tired of the Republic and would go under the protection\r\nof Spain if the latter showed them any favors, such as opening up the\r\nriver to their trade, and thus playing on Spain’s fear, credulity, vanity\r\nand ambitions, he accomplished his purpose, finally ending in Spain\r\nopening up the river, and later, from fear, selling out the last remnant\r\nof her once mighty empire of virgin land in the North American country.\r\n\r\nBut it was Wilkerson and his Kentucky geldings that did it, after John\r\nJay and Congress had failed.\r\n\r\n                               (Continued.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A New Industry in the South—Tea Raising in Texas.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContent\r\n\r\n\r\n    Shall I complain because on me is laid\r\n      The common burden of this world of pain?\r\n      No more my heart shall throb to joy’s sweet strain;\r\n    The path leads on through sorrow’s darkest shade.\r\n    Yet midst the gloom I venture, unafraid;\r\n      The power that gave me love will still sustain.\r\n      That which is mine forever shall remain,\r\n    Whatever powers against me are arrayed.\r\n\r\n    My shining ones!

HOBART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Economic Value of Birds\r\n\r\nBy JOHN H. WALLACE, JR., OF HUNTSVILLE, ALA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time has come when the people must call a halt on the reckless and\r\nwanton slaughter of the small remnant of the game birds and game mammals,\r\nor in a few years not a vestige will remain.\r\n\r\nThis can be done only by the enactment and enforcement of a law that will\r\nin reality protect the game.\r\n\r\nWe have game laws, but there is no popular demand, or public sentiment,\r\nthat calls for their enforcement. All readily agree that infractors of\r\nthe existing statutes should be prosecuted, yet no one seems to be called\r\nupon to instigate prosecutions.\r\n\r\nThe game law is violated, in most instances, because the offenders know\r\nthat they will not be indicted.\r\n\r\nWe need a uniform law, a game warden who has the authority to appoint\r\ndeputies in each county and precinct in the State, whose duty it is to\r\nenforce the game law and bring the breakers thereof to justice.\r\n\r\nLet every sportsman and lover of bird life in the country take up the\r\nfight for such a law, and wage a vigorous and determined campaign for its\r\nspeedy enactment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGame birds, to some extent, by virtue of their already deplorable\r\nscarcity, have elicited protective legislation. The mind of man\r\nimperatively demands recreation. Unless diversion can be found in\r\na legitimate vein he, in his great unrest, seeks that which is not\r\nwholesome.\r\n\r\nHunting has ever been the sport of kings, peasants and savages alike, and\r\nthe chase will always hold for man an incomparable infatuation.\r\n\r\nWhen America was first discovered, here abounded an idealistic\r\nsportsman’s paradise. Buffalo, deer, moose, elk, bear, and panther roamed\r\nthe forests. Geese, duck, brant, swan and wild pigeons flew overhead in\r\ncountless millions. Practically all have been slaughtered, and the great\r\nsport once enjoyed by primeval Nimrods lingers only in a tradition.\r\n\r\nThe few remaining species of game birds should be vigilantly protected\r\nagainst annihilation, and so propagated that gentlemen will consider the\r\npursuit of the elusive denizens of the brush infinitely preferable to\r\nBacchanal hilarity and that riotous revelry that emasculates all that is\r\nnoble, pure and godlike in man’s architecture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great question of the cause of the prevalence of plant maladies and\r\nthe problem of the weed control each year grows more harassing to the\r\nfarmers. The reason for this is simple. Our most beneficial birds, among\r\nthem doves, robins, field larks and bullbats, have been so ruthlessly\r\ndestroyed that in less than a generation their numbers have decreased 80\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nWhen the fact is recalled that the crop of one dove, recently killed in\r\nTennessee, contained over 7,000 weed seeds, and when it is understood\r\nthat a healthy dove will destroy each feeding day at least 5,000\r\nprospective weeds, more than two negroes, working at $1.50 per day each,\r\ncould uproot in double the time, it is easy to see, from the tons upon\r\ntons of weed seed (besides insects) that this bird would destroy each\r\nyear, that our cheapest, most efficient hoe hand proves in the end to be\r\nthe Alabama dove.\r\n\r\nAs an insect devourer, the bullbat is equally serviceable. Its stomach\r\nis elastic and will hold more than that of a pigeon, and its voracity\r\nis simply phenomenal, yet its diminutive frame is smaller than that of\r\na “killdee.” The part borne by the bullbat in mosquito destruction,\r\nespecially in the extermination of the “anopheles,” or malaria-spreading\r\nspecies, transcends the combined work of a case of quinine and a tank of\r\nkerosene oil. As a fever germ abater in a malarial district, a flock of\r\nbullbats would be worth a grove of quinine trees.\r\n\r\nBesides the robin and field lark, already mentioned, both being insect\r\nand weed destroyers, there are many other birds that do invaluable work\r\nfor the farmer without. The ravages made by the dreaded Mexican boll\r\nweevil, that devastates cotton fields like a withering simoon, cannot be\r\nchecked in a surer way than by being obliterated by our insectivorous\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nIf our people could fully appreciate the value of preserving the existing\r\nremnant of our birds, without considering its future increase, the halls\r\nof our State capitol would resound with an emphatic and peremptory demand\r\nfor adequate legislation, for the preservation of our birds means little\r\nless than the preservation of our agriculture itself. Their extinction\r\nwould amount practically to wiping out the entire farming interests of\r\nour splendid commonwealth.\r\n\r\nStatistics incontestably demonstrate the fact that rainfall not only\r\nregulates the yield of our plantation, but that it directs and controls\r\nthe fate of our national politics. When rainfall is light, the people\r\nraise poor crops, and are therefore unhappy and discontented. It is then\r\nthey desire to make a change in the administration of the governmental\r\naffairs, and therefore the party in power is deposed. When there is\r\nan excess of rainfall abundant crops result and the party in power is\r\nretained. Thus it is that, unless speedy legislation is had in order that\r\nthe insectivorous birds remaining may be retained to do valiant service\r\nfor their farmer friends, discord will perennially blight the heart of\r\nthe happy husbandman, and political chaos and turbulence will reign\r\nthroughout the nation, and the anthems of contentment and cadences of\r\nprosperity will not longer pervade the hearts of the honest sons of toil,\r\nbut will be hushed and swallowed up by the sighs and groans of the imp of\r\ninsatiate despair.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSong birds, aside from their brilliant plumage, so pleasing to the\r\nobserver, and their sweet music, redolent with liquid melody, have\r\na civic value of inestimable intrinsic worth that, if truly known\r\nand practically comprehended, would win millions of friends for the\r\nthrilling choristers of the fields and forests, who would indignantly\r\nhalt the crusade of relentless extermination strenuously waged that\r\ngives excellent promise of ultimately depopulating all creation of man’s\r\nvaliant army of feathered coadjutors.\r\n\r\nDid you ever hear an inspiring strain of music that failed to thrill the\r\nsoul with lofty ideals and more exalted aspirations?\r\n\r\nAll those who dwell in an atmosphere of intellectual refinement yearn for\r\nbrilliant things in flowers, birds, sunsets, and in their fellow mortals.\r\nA heartless boy who recklessly slaughters birds will inevitably develop\r\ninto a relentless man. If taught to hold the law in high esteem when\r\nyoung in years, he becomes a patriotic man, with a profound reverence for\r\nthe statutes of his State. The most courageous men, bravest warriors, and\r\nthe most aggressive leaders are those of gentle natures and of tender\r\nhearts. Instill these precepts into the souls of boys, and, existing\r\nin such noble environment, it will mold characters that will ornament\r\nsociety and serve to lift mankind from the miasmic swamps of degeneracy\r\nto the mountain tops where radiates the splendor of moral grandeur.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo help prevent the spread of the boll weevil, pass stringent laws for\r\nthe protection of birds! Then let the planters insist that the bird laws\r\nbe strictly enforced.\r\n\r\nNote the following stupendous agricultural interests which are at stake:\r\n\r\n                                  Value of farms\r\n                      Acres         excluding\r\n                     in farms.      buildings.\r\n\r\n    North Carolina  22,749,356     $141,955,840\r\n    South Carolina  13,985,014       99,805,860\r\n    Georgia         26,392,057      138,616,430\r\n    Florida          4,363,891       31,823,016\r\n    Alabama         20,685,427      100,165,571\r\n    Mississippi     18,240,736      114,956,660\r\n    Louisiana       11,059,127      107,730,210\r\n                   -----------     ------------\r\n      Total        117,475,608     $733,852,587\r\n\r\nProtect the birds—the farmers’ best helpers!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Digging Sweet Potatoes in Texas—a Plenteous Yield.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLuther Burbank\r\n\r\n(After reading the poem by John Trotwood Moore, October Trotwood’s\r\nMonthly.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    They say you touched the desert\r\n      And turned its thorns to fruit;\r\n    That you nodded to the Daisy,\r\n      And raised the Lily mute;\r\n    That flowers ran to meet you,\r\n      The kind whose souls had died;\r\n    That they begged to touch your garment,\r\n      And they all stood glorified.\r\n    You’re a Poet, Preacher, Painter,\r\n      And a Master, all in one,\r\n    And I do congratulate you\r\n      On the good that you have done.\r\n    For your weddings have been “Fruitful,”\r\n      As the nuptial knot you tied\r\n    (With a Cabbage for a bridegroom\r\n      And an Onion for a bride).\r\n    And while you hang sweet pictures\r\n      On the boughs in gold and red,\r\n    There is one thing that you can’t do—\r\n      GROW SOME HAIR ON MY BALD HEAD.\r\n\r\n                           E.

SWEETLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Cornelia’s Spinet\r\n\r\nBy MARY POLK WYNN.\r\n\r\n(A true story, and beautifully told, of an early pioneer incident.—Ed.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLong stretches of white turnpike, with fields of ripening grain on either\r\nside, and in the distance hills that fade into the blue horizon.\r\n\r\nThis is Middle Tennessee at the present time. Even so far back as 1790\r\nthere were a few good roads and houses built by workmen from the “Mother\r\nState,” built in Colonial style, with white Corinthian pillars and\r\npolished oaken floors.\r\n\r\nBefore the door of one of these houses, built of stone in the year 1793,\r\na carriage stopped. This carriage, lately built in a Boston workshop, was\r\nthe first seen in Tennessee, and had been followed, on the latter part\r\nof its journey, by a large and motley company, constantly reinforced by\r\nrecruits, all anxious to see this wonderful structure on wheels, with\r\npostillions, and drawn by four horses, reach its destination.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriage stopped there was a general halt. A black footman,\r\ndescending from a seat on the box, solemnly opened the door, and Sir\r\nPeyton Skipwith, the owner of the “Rock House,” and the thousand acres\r\nsurrounding it, descended from the carriage and assisted a young and\r\nelegant woman to alight. This was unexpected, and a slight cheer went up\r\nfrom the curious onlookers. To this the new land proprietor and his fair\r\ncompanion gravely responded with a bow, and with a lingering glance at\r\nthe setting sun and the broad acres of their new domain, they entered the\r\nhouse, and the happiness of Sir Peyton Skipwith and his bride was only to\r\nbe surmised by the outside world.\r\n\r\nThis outside world, a new settlement with the newspaper from the “Mother\r\nState” a month old, and languishing to hear the latest fashion in\r\nkerchief and stomacher, and the news of Mr. Washington’s re-election,\r\nnaturally took an absorbing interest in the latest acquisition to their\r\nsociety; but with the exception of an occasional courteous word from\r\nSir Peyton, and a smile and bow from Lady Cornelia’s carriage, their\r\ncuriosity concerning the newcomers received no encouragement. The young\r\ncouple were probably too much absorbed in each other to be properly\r\nbenevolent, and public interest was beginning to wane when a rumor was\r\ncirculated that excited a thrill in all.\r\n\r\nBuilt on Sir Peyton’s ground was a small church where the early\r\nsettlers met to unite in divine worship. As they passed to and fro on\r\nthese pious pilgrimages—the rumors were conflicting, but one fact was\r\nunanimously declared—each evening, when the darkness came on, wonderful\r\nand mysterious sounds were heard to issue from the brilliantly illumined\r\nwindows of the “Rock House.” The music (for such it seemed to be) was\r\nsaid to have a most disquieting effect upon those who heard it; even the\r\nreverend pastor, Dr. McGinty himself, was seen to stop on his way and\r\ntake most unseemly steps for one of his age and godly calling.\r\n\r\nSuch a state of affairs would never do! All concurred in one opinion,\r\nthat the matter should be investigated, and a committee of church members\r\nappointed to make known to the public the nature of these profane sounds\r\nthat were so disquieting to the God-fearing flock of Zion Church. It\r\nseemed most proper that an explanation should be demanded of “Mr. Peyton\r\nSkipwith and Mistress Cornelia, his wife (titles were abolished as\r\nsavoring of earthly pride and not consistent with republican teaching).”\r\nThis course having been adopted and not found satisfactory, it was\r\nagreed that on a certain evening the secret committee, composed of grave\r\nand reverend Presbyters, should conceal themselves beneath Sir Peyton\r\nSkipwith’s open windows, and I will try and describe what they saw.\r\n\r\nSeated at an instrument somewhat like our modern piano, with small\r\nspindle legs and white, shining ivory keys, sat Sir Peyton’s bride. The\r\nlight from innumerable silver candelabra fell upon the coils of her fair\r\nhair and the silk of her gown and delicate laces, while Sir Peyton, his\r\ntall form attired in full evening costume, with silk hose, knee buckles\r\nof brilliants and low dancing shoes, turned pages from which she seemed\r\nto play. Her white, jeweled fingers ran over the keys of the instrument,\r\nand brought forth sounds so delicious, so entrancing that the world\r\nseemed to be floating off in melody, and the church committee, secreted\r\nbeneath the open window, held their breath in rapt wonder, but this was\r\nnot all; for next, looking up into Sir Peyton’s eyes, she sang in a voice\r\nlike a flute:\r\n\r\n    “My ain laddie is a sodger boy;\r\n    Oh, I will cast off my gay, costly gown,\r\n    And follow him on from town to town,\r\n    And I will sell the kaims from my hair,\r\n    And follow my true love for e’er mair.”\r\n\r\nAs her voice died away a lady seated in the shadow, whom those watching\r\nhad not before noticed, dressed in a pale silk gown and lace cap and\r\nkerchief, took her seat at the instrument, and Lady Cornelia, standing\r\nup, gaily threw her silk petticoat over her arm and made a deep courtesy\r\nto Sir Peyton, who stood opposite, bowing to the ground. Then they began\r\nto dance. The music had changed now, and the church delegation began to\r\nshuffle their feet uneasily, and take quick uncertain steps until—“Tell\r\nit not in Gath,” for the oak that over-shadowed Sir Peyton’s doorway\r\nalone was the witness—these staid, silent church members began to bow and\r\ncurtsy and pirouette in the moonlight beneath Sir Peyton’s window, while\r\ninside the house, with the light from the candelabra falling on their\r\nsilk and jewels, Sir Peyton and his lady swept up and down the polished\r\nfloor in the stately figures of the minuet. As the music continued, the\r\ndancers seemed to gain fresh inspiration, but at last, like a knight\r\nof old, Sir Peyton kissed his lady’s hand, the lights went out in the\r\n“Rock House,” and the church delegation, with exhilarated but somewhat\r\nsheepish countenances, parted company and wended their ways to their\r\nrespective homes.\r\n\r\nNot many days after this occurrence the following report was submitted\r\nwith much solemnity to the pastor and presiding elders of Zion Church:\r\n\r\n    “Dr. McGinty and Reverend Sirs: Being appointed by ye reverend\r\n    gentlemen to investigate certain musick not consistent with ye\r\n    pious teachings of ye church, said committee will state that\r\n    they found this music in their own minds most conducive to deep\r\n    religious meditations, and much sobriety of thought and action.\r\n\r\n    “Howsoever, said committee advises ye congregation not to\r\n    linger in ye pathway near ye seats of ye mighty in high places,\r\n    for ye machinations of ye evil one are past ye understanding of\r\n    man.\r\n\r\n    “Respectfully submitted.\r\n\r\n                                                  “JONAS FRAME,\r\n                                                  “OBADIAH DILLWEED,\r\n                                                  “KESIAH TROTTER.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this caution to Dr. McGinty’s flock, they were still wont\r\nto linger near the “Rock House” and listen, until one night there was\r\nno light to be seen, nor sound issued from the darkened windows. Lord\r\nPeyton’s horse had returned riderless, and his lifeless body was found\r\nnear a trysting place where he and Lady Cornelia were wont to meet.\r\n\r\nThe “Rock House” was closed now, and Lady Cornelia traveled in foreign\r\nlands. Years passed, and once more sounds of music, plaintive now, were\r\nheard—but these also ceased in time, and the house passed into other\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nAnd now, nearly a hundred years after, with the generations that it has\r\nsheltered sleeping a dreamless sleep near by, this old house alone seems\r\nto preserve its pristine youth.\r\n\r\nOnce again it is occupied by a young couple, and the music that now\r\nfloats from the open windows is that of childish laughter. But on one\r\noccasion the children grow serious, when they are trying to spell the\r\nname cut in the rock on which the house is built, and as with chubby\r\nfingers they point out and spell L-a-d-y C-o-r-n-e-l-i-a S-k-i-p-w-i-t-h,\r\none older than the rest, holding up a warning finger, tells them to\r\n“Listen!” Do you not hear Lady Cornelia’s spinet? She is singing:\r\n\r\n    “My ain laddie was a sodger boy;\r\n    And I will sell the kaims from my hair.\r\n    And follow my true love for e’er mair.”\r\n\r\nAnd then they all listened, and—who can tell? We all know that the\r\nrefrain in Lady Cornelia’s song will never pass away—that love is the\r\nsecret spring of perennial youth, and will be with us until time is no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Our Writers\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Trotwood Moore, Esq.\r\n\r\n                                            Wilmar, Minn., Feb. 17, 1906.\r\n\r\nSir: Two copies of Trotwood’s Monthly have been sent me, and I greatly\r\nenjoyed the well-chosen, readable articles, and think there must surely\r\nbe a field for such a magazine.\r\n\r\nIn “Educating the Horse,” you give a much-needed warning against the\r\nabuse of the checkrein, and the following is written in the hope that\r\nso great a lover of horses as your article shows you to be may pick up\r\na real sharp-pointed pen and with black ink give somebody a well-meant,\r\ngentlemanly roasting. Like your monthly, it is dedicated to the horse.\r\n\r\nThe name of Jackson is greatly revered by the American people, and\r\ndeservedly so; for there have been distinguished soldiers, statesmen,\r\nhorsemen and whole-souled Southern gentlemen among the Jacksons, but\r\nthere was one of that name who, I think, ought to have his effigy placed\r\nin front of every judge’s stand at every racecourse of the nation. This\r\nparticular one is the Mr. Jackson who invented that rotten abomination\r\ncalled the Jackson, but now called the overdraw checkrein.\r\n\r\nI think not one sound reason can be given for its use, not even on the\r\nscore of ornament, and twenty could be given against it. It is as cruel\r\nas the “scavenger’s daughter,” which the guides will show you in the\r\ntorture chamber in the Tower of London, and works on the same principle,\r\nand is kin to the diabolical contrivance so graphically described by\r\nCharles Reade in his inimitable novel, “It Is Never Too Late to Mend,”\r\nand again works on the same principle.\r\n\r\nSome of the best horsemen, the most carelessly careful drivers, and\r\nthe best horses are to be found in the coaching clubs in large cities,\r\nparticularly in New York.\r\n\r\nDo you suppose there is money enough in all New York City to induce one\r\nof those men to use that check to drive a coach load of people down\r\nBroadway at a busy time, or up and down the Adirondacks or Catskills,\r\nwhere close driving and short, quick turning are wanted? Not much, and he\r\ndoes not like spoiling his horses’ necks and legs; besides he wants them\r\nto plunge into their collars at a word.\r\n\r\nThe only two lines that can be effectively used against it, I think, are\r\nfashion and ridicule. Make its use “bad form,” and guy it into the ground.\r\n\r\nEvery user of that check rein ought to memorize some of the sublime lines\r\nof Shakespeare. Anyhow, every time he checks a horse up he ought to\r\nrepeat that immortal speech of Dogberry.\r\n\r\n                                                         GEORGE MADDISON.\r\n\r\n[We thank Mr. Maddison and heartily agree with him.—Ed.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEditor Trotwood’s:\r\n\r\nIn your March issue, reprinting the familiar poem, “The Old Canoe,” which\r\nthe anthology-makers so persistently ascribe to the late Gen. Albert\r\nPike, you say: “Like many other good poems, it was, perhaps, the only one\r\nsome poet wrote, and, never thinking it would be immortal, or that it had\r\nany special merit, failed to sign his name to it.... Its authorship has\r\nnever before, perhaps, been publicly corrected.”\r\n\r\nBoth these statements are erroneous.\r\n\r\nNine years ago, when Miss Jennie Thornley Clarke’s “Songs of the South”\r\nwas published, it contained this poem, marked “anonymous.” As I chanced\r\nto know its real authorship, and hence knew that it lacked several\r\nhundreds of miles, geographically speaking, of being a “song of the\r\nSouth,” I sent a communication to the New York Critic, which was printed\r\nin its issue of March 13, 1897, giving the facts. I have several times\r\nsince publicly corrected the statement that General Pike was the author\r\nof the poem. The actual author was Miss Emily Rebecca Page, who was born\r\nin Bradford, Vt., in 1834, and died in Chelsea, Mass., in 1862. “The\r\nOld Canoe” was written in 1849, and appeared in the Portland Transcript\r\nin that year. It was not by any means “the only one the poet wrote.”\r\nMiss Page was a voluminous writer of both verse and prose, having been\r\na constant contributor to many New England periodicals. She was later\r\nassistant editor of “Gleason’s Pictorial” and “The Flag of Our Union,”\r\ntwo Boston literary publications which were very popular forty or fifty\r\nyears ago. She also published several volumes of poetry.\r\n\r\n                                                          R. L. C. WHITE.\r\n\r\nNashville, February 26, 1906.\r\n\r\n[We knew there must be a history for this poem, and we thank Dr. White\r\nfor his letter.—Ed.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEditor Trotwood:\r\n\r\nOld Tom’s body lies mouldering in the grave, but his spirit goes pacing\r\non. The gifted pen of the good man, Col. Frank Buford, calls attention\r\nto the fact that the sacred dust of the grandest and noblest old Roman\r\nis being disturbed. The evergreen of the old tree which marked the\r\nrevered spot has withered and gone. The Colonel’s item in Trotwood’s\r\njewel case carries us back to a great day in the history of the horse.\r\nThat the passing of old Tom Hal No. 1 marked a distinct epoch in the\r\nequine history of the world may seem a far-fetched statement, but\r\nwhere on the face of the earth is there record, in horse lore, of a\r\ngreater achievement? Bought by the gallant Capt. Thos. Gibson as a\r\nstable companion to the great John Dillard, Jr. (Gibson’s), for the\r\nsole purpose of production and betterment of the army of fine saddle\r\nhorses of the “middle basin,” in good old Tennessee, he grandly served\r\nthe purpose, for who that has had a “Hal” mount, on a typical Tennessee\r\nspring morning, for a ten-mile spin on its fine roadways, over hill\r\nand down valley, by babbling brook, has failed to thank God for life,\r\nliberty and the capture of happiness on that particular horse. He had\r\npopulated the fields with a family of superb saddlers, and made greatest\r\nachievement of the day as a sire of speed, for “Little Brown Jug,” as the\r\nfore pacer of old Tom’s coming family and fame as a sire of the greatest\r\nrace horses, set the stride, to be bettered by the immortal Hal Pointer\r\n2:04½, who hauled the grim-visaged, silent old warrior to victory in\r\nhundreds of hard-fought battles, and the other “Pointer,” blazoned on\r\nthe course “1:59¼,” a race record not to be rivaled by any other blood.\r\nAnd so, when as a progenitor of size, and beauty, and intelligence, and\r\nspeed, and stamina, and saddle, and all purpose qualities old Tom had\r\ndistanced the best hopes of his early admirers, and was gathered to his\r\nfathers, his hoofs beat a tattoo down the gold-paved streets leading\r\nto St. Peter’s beautiful stables. And the sir knight who drew his rein\r\nat the door announced to St. Peter, “Old Tom Hal, Jr., No. 16934, from\r\nTennessee!” and St. Peter looked sad as he said: “I know him not by that\r\ncognomen. Take him away. He bears the dub title given by the arch foe of\r\nhis race of pacers. Clean him of his saddle and cloth, bridle and dub;\r\ngroom him and clothe him in new purple and gold, and place on his saddle\r\nskirt his proper title, viz., ‘Old Tom Hal No. 1,’ and return and ask Ed\r\nGeers to ask ‘Old Wash’ to give him the first box stall to the right, and\r\ncare well for him. The bin of clipped golden oaks is for him, and you,\r\nfor having the temerity to bring this King here with such a dub title,\r\nwill go to outer darkness for sixty days.” And it was done.\r\n\r\nThe funeral of old Tom Hal No. 1 was celebrated at the beautiful mansion\r\nplace of the famed Bufords, near Buford’s Station, Giles County, Tenn.,\r\nand when the thousands from forty miles around, and mourners from Ohio\r\nwho came to do honor had tethered their saddle steeds in the great open\r\ntimber, one could well imagine that the brilliant legion of the immortal\r\n“Wheeler” had camped close on our trail. There were hundreds of sons,\r\ndaughters, grandsons and daughters and nephews and close kin to old\r\nTom Hal there, with moistened eyes and somber mien, as the band played\r\nthe dirge. The “silent Wheeler” of the harness brigade was there, with\r\nthe incomparable “Pointer,” 2:04½ as chief mourners, came in a special\r\ncoach, but there was not time for Pointer’s mourning compatriot to\r\ndeliver a eulogy. His was the still grief of one who mourns, but cannot\r\nweep. All the good people of Maury, Giles, Williamson and adjoining\r\ncounties were there. The woods seemed full of the cavalry of peace.\r\nCannons of war had been molded into ploughshares, and swords had been\r\nfashioned into blacksmith’s pruning knives, and after the time for music\r\nand oration, there was a time for feasting, and then the assembled\r\nmultitude witnessed, not a miracle as to loaves and fishes, but a master\r\ndemonstration of the measureless, distinctive Southern hospitality\r\n(which has to be born Southern to be operative, and seen and realized\r\nto be appreciated) of Colonel Buford, on whose estate the funeral was\r\nheld. People had heard of barbecues, but some of us had never before\r\nsniffed the enticing odors of meats thus baked, while our stomachs were\r\ncollapsed. Trenches some hundreds of feet long, and three feet wide,\r\nwere filled with live coals, embers of burning firewood, and across\r\nthese trenches, on green poles, lay wired the fresh sacrifices of lamb\r\nand shoat, burnt offerings to the god of the race course, cut in half\r\nlengthwise, and these poles (in the brawny hands of the dark-skinned,\r\nfaithful tillers, the salvation of the people in past time of peril,\r\nand the necessity of the future for the development of the wonderful\r\nSouthland’s broad acres), so frequently turned as to insure a beautiful\r\nbake. Suffice it to say the meat and bread and coffee went the whole\r\nrounds with the great multitude, and there were many more than the\r\n“twelve baskets” after all the people were fed. And while old Tom’s\r\nspirit will go pacing on, his name, and his fame briefly, should be\r\ncarved on a native granite boulder of as many tons weight as can be moved\r\nto a conspicuous place in the public square at Columbia, or some other\r\npublic center, where time or change of ownership would not interfere, as\r\nthe generations pass. I will be glad to aid such movement.\r\n\r\n                                                            E. Z. STRIDE.\r\n\r\nCleveland, O., March 1, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Cotton Gin\r\n\r\n\r\n[There have been so many requests for copies of this poem that it is\r\nreproduced. It has been adopted in all the public schools of Alabama and\r\nrecited on Alabama Day, December 14, each year.—E. E. Sweetland.]\r\n\r\n    It lies alone in the rank June corn,\r\n    A relic of days that are numbered and gone;\r\n    The June wind sings a song in its throat,\r\n    The June clouds lovingly over it float,\r\n    And through its skeleton ribs of steel\r\n    The moth-flies dance in a drowsy reel.\r\n          For its saws are rust\r\n          With canker and crust,\r\n    They hum no more from dawn to dusk—\r\n          And the lizard is ginner,\r\n            And out and in,\r\n          The spider is spinner\r\n            At the Old Cotton Gin.\r\n\r\n    Ay, many a day for the old, old South,\r\n    He spun his fleece from a fiery mouth,\r\n    And wove his woof in a fabric of gold—\r\n    As a picture is painted, a tale that is told.\r\n    And he sat in his might, this fallen thing,\r\n    A hoary monarch, an uncrowned king,\r\n          And over the land\r\n          With an iron hand,\r\n    He flung his wealth with a gesture grand,\r\n          And Might was the ginner—\r\n            Of barn and of bin\r\n          There was never a winner\r\n            Like the Old Cotton Gin.\r\n\r\n    Broad was the kingdom he ruled in his might,\r\n    Brave were the armies he rallied for fight,\r\n    Bright were the wings of his ships on the seas,\r\n    Bold were his merchantmen—kingly his ease.\r\n    True were his women in hut or in hall,\r\n    Sweet the soft sunshine that fell over all.\r\n          From banjo and bow\r\n          And the cotton’s long row,\r\n    Free-song and slave-song would mingle and flow.\r\n          And Pride was the ginner—\r\n            (Unpardonable sin!)\r\n          Was there ever a sinner\r\n            Like the Old Cotton Gin?\r\n\r\n    Alas, for his weavings—ay, tears for the day\r\n    When out from his loom came the jackets of gray,\r\n    And the locks that were plucked in despair from his head\r\n    Were woven to crimson in shrouds for his dead.\r\n    They died for the Sin the centuries had given,\r\n    And their blood is the pledge on the lintels of heaven.\r\n          By river and plain\r\n          They march not again,\r\n    And wet was his fleece with the blood of his slain—\r\n          For Death was the ginner—\r\n            And Riot and Din—\r\n          And Sorrow the spinner,\r\n            At the Old Cotton Gin.\r\n\r\n    He buried his dead, and a tenderer tone\r\n    Crept into his song, for he sang it alone;\r\n    But he wove as he sang and the pattern was bright—\r\n    The tapestry of stars that come with the night—\r\n    And he built his waste places and conquered by toil\r\n    And garnered in peace what was gathered in spoil,\r\n          And all the day long\r\n          He wove in his song\r\n    The patience of right in the pillage of wrong—\r\n          And Faith was the ginner,\r\n            The fabric to spin,\r\n          And Hope was the spinner\r\n            At the Old Cotton Gin.\r\n\r\n    With his Hope in the future, his Heart in the past,\r\n    He worked for his people and wove to the last;\r\n    And, tottering, he stood through the rift and the reel\r\n    And he died as he lived—with his hand on the wheel,\r\n    And sighing, his soul passed peacefully through,\r\n    As pure as the last lock of lint in the flue.\r\n          The Heart, whose beat\r\n          Was the Century’s feet,\r\n    Was willing to cease, but not to retreat.\r\n          And the New South was ginner,\r\n            The New Age was in,\r\n          The New Century spinner—\r\n            A New Cotton Gin.\r\n\r\n    Rear him—O sons of a generous sire—\r\n    Aloft on a monument, not on a pyre;\r\n    Base-stone of valor, column of youth,\r\n    Shaft-stone of chivalry, cap-stone of truth—\r\n    Honor him, sons of a land that is fair,\r\n    Let him not lie in the rank weeds there,\r\n          For see! from his night\r\n          He rises all bright,\r\n    He wakens!

The modern darky is no more like his ancestors, so far\r\nas individuality is concerned, than the Greek of to-day resembles those\r\nwho fought around the walls of Troy. In other words, the modern Negro has\r\n“caught on,” and there is now little difference between him, save in the\r\neternal negro that is in him, and any other class that he happens to run\r\nwith. The Negro of to-day may be divided into two great classes; he is\r\neither a “nigger” or a “coon,” a vagabond, a shiftless, worthless fellow,\r\nwho lives to-day and lets to-morrow take care of itself; or else he is a\r\nschool teacher, a preacher, a fairly good mechanic, a good farm hand and\r\na peaceable, inoffensive citizen who will bear uncomplainingly injustices\r\nunder which a white race would rush to arms. These two classes make up\r\nthe Negro race, and between them they have managed to eliminate the\r\nold-time darky we used to know and love. Out of a thousand darkies of the\r\npresent day, perhaps one old-time darky may be found; but even he may not\r\nbe found fit for character study. My observation is that it is extremely\r\nrare to find one who gives us any idea upon which to build a story or a\r\npoem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fact is, darky stories are always nine-tenths white and one-tenth\r\nNegro. They are nine-tenths art, as most good stories are, and one-tenth\r\nnature; but all so nicely blended that the art—as all real art is—is\r\nconcealed in the colors of the natural. And yet these stories are true to\r\nnature—in fact so natural that we fail to see where the natural ceases\r\nand the art begins. The darky who told about “Marse Chan” was the same\r\nwho told of “Unk Eden’ro and Meh Lady.” They are all a clever white man\r\nwho knows the darky as a mariner knows the sea, imitating the darky and\r\nmaking for him a story. Joel Chandler Harris was wiser in making one\r\ndarky—Uncle Remus—tell all of his, and they therefore sound more natural.\r\nHe was also wise in selecting the nursery yarns of “Brer Rabbit” and\r\n“Brer Fox,” for in telling them the darky is at his best. On the whole,\r\nI expect that Harris is the greater interpreter of the two, but this\r\nneed not necessarily follow, because the Virginia and the Georgia darky\r\ndiffer very much in dialect just as the Tennessee darky differs from\r\neither of the others. Especially is this true of the Middle Tennessee\r\ndarky who happened to belong to the wealthier class of white people. For\r\nevery Negro is a born imitator.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn writing Negro dialect, then, these facts must be borne in mind, for,\r\nas I said, there are provincialisms in the Negro language, as in the\r\nwhite. The cracker dialect of Georgia differs from the mountain dialect\r\nof Tennessee, and so the darky language in Georgia differs much from that\r\nin Tennessee.\r\n\r\nBut at last Negro dialect devolves itself not so much in spelling—in\r\ndialect—as in mannerism. This is the fatal mistake which many writers\r\nmake who have not been raised among Negroes and who seem to think that\r\nbad spelling and certain other forms of spelling make Negro dialect. No\r\none should attempt a Negro story who is not thoroughly familiar with\r\nhis ground, and then not unless he can tell a good story anyway. In\r\nother words, he must be an artist in that line, he must have a calling\r\nfor story-telling, he must be able to create a great deal out of very\r\nlittle. For in Negro stories, as in all others, one fact, one glimpse is\r\noften sufficient for a whole story, as often one remark, aye, one word,\r\nshows us more plainly a person’s character than if we had spent years in\r\nstudying him.\r\n\r\nIn Negro dialect, then, it is mannerism and not spelling that counts, for\r\nthe fraud is quickly detected if the article be not genuine. The present\r\ndarkies of Puck, Judge and other comic papers, and often even the stories\r\nin magazines, bear no more resemblance to the real article than dried\r\napples do to the real fruit.\r\n\r\nI know of nothing that misses the mark further, unless it be these same\r\ncomic papers’ drawings of the Negro. These really represent nothing,\r\nand the “Mister Johnsings” darky and the darky that ends everything in\r\na broad “ah” may be the product of Northern tenement houses, but his\r\nkinfolks down here would not know him if they met him in the road.\r\n\r\nBut as far as bad spelling is concerned, all dialect writers use more of\r\nit than is necessary. As a matter of fact, the Middle Tennessee darky,\r\nor he of the Black Belt of Alabama, who has been raised by educated white\r\npeople, or been thrown much in their society, speaks much more correctly\r\nthan the uneducated whites. For the Negro is nothing, as I said, if not\r\nan imitator; and of all people he loves to imitate the better class of\r\nwhites. He has, therefore, caught fairly well their pronunciation of\r\nall common words, their tone and inflection. The real fun occurs in the\r\nuse of his words and the incongruous relations he places them in. But\r\nthe poor white—the ignorant, uneducated white—is not an imitator, but a\r\ncreator, and some of the creations are enough to make us want to call out\r\nthe National Guard to save the king’s English. For instance: “I taken\r\na walk,” “I taken a drink,” “I taken my corn to mill.” This invariable\r\nuse of the past participle for the past tense by the unlettered white\r\nis never used by the darky. He will say: “I tuck a drink,” “I tuck a\r\nwalk,” which is much nearer right than the first named. “No, thank you, I\r\nwouldn’t choose any,” is the ignorant white’s way of declining a dish at\r\na meal. He loves the subjunctive mood better than the indicative, as his\r\ninvariable “Might you pass me them molasses?” shows. The darky will never\r\nmake such mistakes as these. He is an imitator, pure and simple, and he\r\nnever imitates that kind of a white man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe truth is, there is and always has been, a strong antipathy—nay,\r\npositive aversion—between the poor white and the darky. Any trouble\r\nbetween the two races in the South is always between these two classes.\r\nThe old-time Southerners of the better class, who owned the darky, or\r\nwhose fathers owned him, are his best friends and staunchest supporters.\r\nBut for them I sometimes think the poor white, with his ignorant,\r\nprejudiced ways and his natural hatred of the Negro would drive the\r\ndarky out of the country. As it is, the better classes are for him,\r\nbecause they know him and have been raised with him and know him to be\r\nfaithful and true and admirably adapted as a laborer to the country. The\r\nso-called Negro problem in the South exists more in the minds of writers\r\nof the Thomas Dixon order and in newspapers than in the land itself. And\r\nwhat there is of it will be solved forever and effectually the day the\r\ngreat tide of immigration is turned southward.\r\n\r\nAnd not any good can come to the South in the yellow novels which Thomas\r\nDixon is writing. That they are not literature goes without argument; but\r\na novel may not be literature and yet may sell, just as oleomargarine may\r\nbe colored deep saffron and passed for butter. As literature, then, they\r\nwill deceive no one except, perhaps, the young who read them and know no\r\nbetter. And this is to be regretted, because there is danger always of\r\nthe young growing up with false ideas of literature as well as of life,\r\nand they may imitate him. There are Dixons in every age of literature.\r\nThey run from Smollett to the House of Mirth. They take advantage of the\r\nsores under the collar of the Galled Jade of Things to put money in their\r\npurse. They die and their stuff dies with them. They live as long as they\r\ndo because the world has many people who would rather look at a sore than\r\na star.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the older people of the South, who really knew what the Ku Klux was\r\nbefore he fell under the magnifying glass of national politics and\r\nbecame the distorted Behemoth upon which to make political capital,\r\nthe lime-lighted melodramas of Mr. Dixon bring only smiles. The thing\r\noriginated in the fun-loving plethora of the surcharged idleness of a\r\nsummer afternoon among a healthy lot of grown-up boys out for a lark and\r\nto frighten newly-freed Negroes. Silence and a mystery appals any Negro.\r\nIt was a mystery and it rode in sheeted silence. It proved more effective\r\nthan a shotgun to send prowling Negroes to bed. It meant “ghostes” and if\r\na Negro has any religion in his bones it is the religion of ghostes. It\r\nwas so effective that it grew and was used as an admirable and effective\r\nmeans of a superior race under the bayonet of their conquerors, to\r\nmaintain the racial integrity against the flood of freed and elevated\r\nslaves. It owes its magnified proportions entirely to the red paint of\r\npolitics. Then, as with lynchings now, the busy and better people of the\r\nSouth gave it neither their salvos nor their sanction. They were too\r\nintent upon planting cotton, developing their great mines and rebuilding\r\ntheir country. It was a half-mystic, half-lawless, much-talked-of lodge\r\nof half-necessary lawlessness, whose stock in trade was blood-and-thunder\r\nmystery and whose purchaser was ignorant, black Superstition.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the thousand and one means a superior intelligence will\r\nalways find to control inferior ignorance without butchering him in\r\nblocks or pens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut in its rollicking and rankest days it was never as bad nor had\r\nit ever as strong a hold as lynching and homicide have to-day in all\r\nsections of the Republic. And it never saw the day when it was half as\r\ncruel or killed and flogged together in a month as many black Negroes\r\nas Southern cotton mills kill of the white poor children of the South\r\nin a day. Compared to the voiceless, swift-moving Juggernaut of the\r\nchild-killing cotton mill, Ku Klux was the painted, grinning clown of\r\na country show throwing rotten apples at a coon’s head stuck through a\r\nsheet!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd as to child-labor—hear this metaphor:\r\n\r\nDeep in the hills lies the little stream which is the beginning of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nIt is concealed in the ground that it may be protected, for so small is\r\nits beginning that a too-rough footstep might destroy it, a ruthless\r\ntrack might change it from the destiny of its way to the sea.\r\n\r\nGrowing, it creeps forth, but under leaf and mold, under the hanging\r\nvines and protecting shrubs and only when it is strong enough to resist\r\nall efforts to change its course does it flow out into the open and run\r\nthe race of its life.\r\n\r\nHow careful is nature to protect all things which are young.\r\n\r\n“Youth is not for work,” she says, and she writes it from the stars of\r\nthe daisy field to the stars of heaven.\r\n\r\nThere is no flower which does not shelter its unblossomed buds, if\r\nnecessary, even with thorns. The wild doe hides her fawn in the bush; the\r\nking of beasts hides his in the desert caverns.\r\n\r\nOnly man has decreed in his selfishness that his children must lose their\r\nchildhood to the greed of gold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs for the negro himself, here are some plain, never-lying,\r\nphysiological, bred-in-the-bone truths about him which the sooner the\r\nworld recognizes, the easier will the problem of his being be. The Negro\r\nis first and always an imitator. He cannot originate. He cannot go\r\nupward, save as he copies from the whites, and if that prop be removed,\r\nhe will quickly go back into barbarism. There is something wanting in the\r\nNegro character—in the very fibre of his being—that says as plainly as\r\nGod can say it of a race: “Thus far shalt thou go and no further.” And\r\nleft to himself for centuries on the most fertile continent of the globe,\r\nhe has remained to-day where he was at creation’s dawn. Egypt, Assyria,\r\nGreece, Rome, the Saxon—all these civilizations have been added to the\r\nworld, and still the Negro remains as God made him.\r\n\r\nThere are some people who think they can improve on the Almighty’s plan.\r\nThe Maker of All did not intend that the Negro should be a white man in\r\na black skin, as some who are solving the Negro problem would think. If\r\nHe had, He would have made him like the white man and given him that\r\nindefinable, inexplicable quality that makes the white man a doer of\r\ndeeds, a fighter, an advancer, a dreamer, a conqueror. The Negro is none\r\nof these. He is merely a good natured, inferior man, a non-combative\r\nrace, made for some purpose of labor, to be directed always by a superior\r\nmind, and in his highest development an imitator.\r\n\r\nThere has been so much said on the Negro problem lately that I have\r\ninadvertently, as it were, thrown out this. It is good for one to be set\r\nstraight now and then, on first principles. It is easy for man to get all\r\nwrong if he starts out on a wrong hypothesis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a letter from a correspondent in Medicine Lodge, Kans., the other\r\nday, appears a sentence we have been looking for all our lives.\r\n“Facts, ideals and a thrill,” he says, “is a terse definition of every\r\ngreat story,” and he is kind enough to say that Trotwood’s fills the\r\ndefinition. “Facts, ideals and a thrill”—I should love to know just who\r\noriginated that boiled-down recipe for real literature. If I might advise\r\nall of my writers (and I am called on daily by letters to help advise\r\nmany of them), I would say adopt that motto and go write your story. As\r\nfor us hereafter, we will nail it to our masthead and try to build up to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother well-wisher suggests that we change the words on the title page\r\nfrom Farm, Horse and Home to The Southland—her land and her life. That is\r\nnot bad, either. We publish this to let you know that we appreciate all\r\nsuch suggestions. We feel that you would not do it if you did not like\r\nus. And that is what we are here for—to get you to like us.\r\n\r\nAnd here let us say that the next issue of Trotwood’s will inaugurate\r\na long-cherished idea of its editor. Under the heading of “Trotwood’s\r\nTravels through the South,” in a special advertising departure we will\r\nvisit various sections of our great Southland and tell what we saw. We\r\nwish to show to the world just what we have here in the newly awakened\r\nSouth, with all its natural wealth and its old ideals. Nor will we\r\ntake this space from the body of Trotwood’s—it will be additional. Our\r\nfirst visit will be to the beautiful valley of the Tennessee, at the\r\ngrowing little city of Florence, Ala., the head of the Mussel Shoals.\r\nLast week the President signed a bill permitting a five million dollar\r\ncompany to harness the waste waters of the great shoals, giving power\r\nto the towns and cities within a radius of two hundred miles of it. We\r\nwill show what that means and what chances there are in Florence, with\r\nall her resources. For the June number the cantaloupe-raising industry\r\nof Lawrenceburg, in Lawrence County, Tenn., has been selected—Lawrence\r\nCounty, where one hundred dollars and more per acre were cleared last\r\nyear in her newly discovered improvement in the Rocky Ford cantaloupe,\r\nand lands are trebling in value. From issue to issue we will take\r\ndifferent sections of the South, from Georgia to Texas. And as we go we\r\npropose to tell the history and the romance of it too. For what is a land\r\nwithout its romance? A woman without a love affair is more interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBusiness Department\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a day but we receive from one to half a dozen letters\r\nfrom our subscribers telling us how they appreciate Trotwood’s Monthly\r\nand Trotwood. His stories seem to please the people, and they are all\r\nloud in their praise, but we do not recall having received anything of a\r\ncomplimentary nature regarding his writing—with a pen. We often have to\r\ntranslate some of his letters for people who fall down when they try to\r\nread them, but the following letter written to Mr. Sterling C. Brewer,\r\nprincipal of the Link School, Thomasville, Tenn., seems to hold the\r\nrecord:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe above is a facsimile of the letter written by Trotwood.\r\n\r\nMr. Brewer writes as follows.\r\n\r\n“When I received Trotwood’s letter I saw at once that it was a rather\r\na tough proposition, and I turned it over to one of my pupils for\r\ntranslation. She called her chum and they studied it very diligently for\r\nawhile, and to make sure that none of it escaped, wrote it down, and it\r\ncame to me in a small vertical hand as plain as print:\r\n\r\n    “‘Dr. M. Braver:\r\n\r\n    “‘I struck pie 10 inches. Pretty if clean and well done of a\r\n    jay man. I’d like to charge it some after meat. It would make\r\n    a snake sweat trying to propel hayseed.

The letter is plain enough, and reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Mr. Brewer:\r\n\r\n    “I thank you so much. The story is clean and well done for a\r\n    young man.
