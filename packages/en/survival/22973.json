M.\r\n\r\n  _Bramo assai, poco, spero nulla chieggio._\r\n\r\n_LONDON:_ Printed by _T. S._ for _Iohn Browne_, and are to be sould at\r\nhis shop in Saint _Dunstanes_ Church-yard.\r\n\r\n1613.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO THE RIGHT\r\n  HONOVRABLE,\r\n  and his singular good Lord,\r\n  the Lord _Clifton_, Baron of\r\n  Layton.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a custome (right Honorable, and my most singular good Lord) both\r\namongst the auntient _Romans_, and also amongst the wise\r\n_Lacedemonians_, that euery idle person should giue an account of the\r\nexpence of his howers: Now I that am most idle, and least imployed in\r\nyour Familie, present here vnto your Lordships hands an account of the\r\nexpence of my idle time, which how well, or ill, it is, your Noble\r\nwisedome must both iudge and correct; onely this I am acertain'd, that\r\nfor the generall rules and Maximes of the whole worke, they are most\r\ninfallibly true, and perfectly agreeing with our English climate. Now if\r\nyour Lordship shall doubt of the true tast of the liquor because it\r\nproceedeth from such a vessell as my selfe, whom you may imagine vtterly\r\nvnseasoned vvith any of these knowledges, beleeue it (my most best Lord)\r\nthat for diuers yeeres, wherein I liued most happily, I liued a\r\nHusbandman, amongst Husbandmen of most excellent knowledge; during all\r\nwhich time I let no obseruation ouer-slip me: for I haue euer from my\r\nCradle beene naturally giuen to obserue, and albe I haue not that oylie\r\ntongue of ostentation which loueth euer to be babling all, and somewhat\r\nmore then it knoweth, drawing from ignorance admiration, and from\r\nwisedome laughter, filling meale-times with much vnprofitable noyse; yet\r\nI thanke my maker I haue a breast which containeth contentment inough\r\nfor my selfe, and I hope much benefit for the whole Kingdome; how euer\r\nor whatsoeuer it is, it is all your Lordships, vnder the couert of whose\r\nfauourable protection if it may finde grace it is the vttermost aime\r\nwhereunto my wishes aspire, nor shall I feare the malignitie of the\r\ncurious, for it is not to them but the honest plaine English Husbandman,\r\nI intend my labours, vvhose defender you haue euer beene, and for whose\r\nHonorable prosperitie both they and I will continually pray.\r\n\r\n  _Your honours in all\r\n  seruiceable humblenesse_,\r\n\r\n  G. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epistle to the generall and gentle Reader.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough (generall reader) the nature of this worst part of this last\r\nage hath conuerted all things to such vildnesse that whatsoeuer is\r\ntruely good is now esteemed most vitious, learning being derided,\r\nfortitude drawne into so many definitions that it consisteth in meere\r\nwords onely, and although nothing is happy or prosperous, but meere\r\nfashion & ostentation, a tedious fustian-tale at a great mans table,\r\nstuft with bigge words, with out sence, or a mimicke Iester, that can\r\nplay three parts in one; the Foole, the Pandar and the Parasit, yet\r\nnotwithstanding in this apostate age I haue aduentured to thrust into\r\nthe world this booke, which nothing at all belongeth to the silken\r\nscorner, but to the plaine russet honest Husbandman, for whose\r\nparticular benefit, and the kingdomes generall profit, I haue with much\r\npaine, care, and industry, passed through the same. Now for the motiues\r\nwhich first drew me to vndertake the worke, they were diuers: as first,\r\nwhen I saw one man translate and paraphrase most excellently vpon\r\n_Virgils Georgickes_, a worke onely belonging to the Italian climbe, &\r\nnothing agreeable with ours another translates _Libault & Steuens_, a\r\nworke of infinit excellency, yet onely proper and naturall to the\r\nFrench, and not to vs: and another takes collections from _Zenophon_, and\r\nothers; all forrainers and vtterly vnacquainted with our climbes: when\r\nthis I beheld, and saw with what good liking they were entertained of\r\nall men; and that euery man was dumbe to speake any thing of the\r\n_Husbandry_ of our owne kingdome, I could not but imagine it a worke most\r\nacceptable to men, and most profitable to the kingdome, to set downe the\r\ntrue manner and nature of our right English _Husbandry_, our soyle being\r\nas delicate, apt, and fit for increase as any forraine soyle whatsoeuer,\r\nand as farre out-going other kingdomes in some commoditie, as they vs in\r\nother some. Hence, and from these considerations, I began this worke, of\r\nwhich I haue here sent thee but a small tast, which if I finde accepted,\r\naccording to mine intent, I will not cease (God permitting mee life) to\r\npasse through all manner of English _Husbandry_ and _Huswifery_ whatsoeuer,\r\nwithout omission of the least scruple that can any way belong to either\r\nof their knowledges. Now gentle reader whereas you may be driuen to some\r\namazement, at two titles which insue in the booke, namely, a former part\r\nbefore the first, and the first part, you shall vnderstand that those\r\nfirst sheetes were detained both from the Stationer and me, till the\r\nbooke was almost all printed; and my selfe by extreame sicknesse kept\r\nfrom ouer-viewing the same, wherefore I must intreate your fauour in\r\nthis impression and the rather in as much as there wanteth neither any\r\nof the words or matter whatsoeuer: _Farewell_.\r\n\r\n  Thine\r\n  _G. M._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n  FORMER PART,\r\n  before the first Part: Being an absolute perfect Introduction into\r\n  all the Rules of true Husbandry; and must first of all be read, or\r\n  the Readers labour will be frustrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n_The Proem of the Author. What a Husbandman is: His Vtilitie and\r\nNecessitie._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a common Adage in our English speech, that a man generally seene\r\nin all things can bee particularly perfect or compleate in none: Which\r\nProuerbe there is no question will both by the curious and enuious be\r\nheauily imposed vpon my backe, because in this, and other workes, I haue\r\ndelt with many things of much importance, and such as any one of them\r\nwould require a whole liues experience, whereas neither my Birth, my\r\nEducation, nor the generall course of my life can promise no\r\nsingularitie in any part of those Artes they treate of: but for\r\nsuggestions (the liberty whereof the wisedome of Kings could neuer\r\nbridle) let them poison themselues with their owne gall, they shall not\r\nso much as make me looke ouer my shoulder from my labour: onely to the\r\ncurteous and well meaning I giue this satisfaction, I am but onely a\r\npublique Notary, who record the most true and infallible experience of\r\nthe best knowing Husbands in this land.\r\n\r\nBesides, I am not altogether vnseene in these misteries I write of: for\r\nit is well knowne I followed the profession of a Husbandman so long my\r\nselfe, as well might make mee worthy to be a graduate in the vocation:\r\nwherein my simplicitie was not such but I both obserued well those which\r\nwere esteemed famous in the profession, and preserued to my selfe those\r\nrules which I found infallible by experience. _Virgill_ was an excellent\r\nPoet, and a seruant, of trusty account, to _Augustus_, whose court and\r\nstudy-imployments would haue said he should haue little knowledge in\r\nrurall businesse, yet who hath set downe more excellently the manner of\r\nItalian Husbandry then himselfe, being a perfect lanthorne, from whose\r\nlight both Italie and other countries haue seene to trace into the true\r\npath of profit and frugallitie? _Steuens_ and _Libault_, two famous\r\nPhisitions, a profession that neuer medleth with the Plough, yet who\r\nhath done more rarely! nay, their workes are vtterly vncontrolable\r\ntouching all manner of french Husbandry whatsoeuer; so my selfe although\r\nby profession I am onely a horse-man, it being the predominant outward\r\nvertue I can boast of, yet why may not I, hauing the sence of man, by\r\nthe ayde of obseruation and relation, set downe all the rules and\r\nprinciples of our English Husbandry in as good and as perfect order as\r\nany of the former? there is no doubt but I may and this I dare bouldly\r\nassure vnto all Readers that there is not any rule prescribed through\r\nthis whole worke, but hath his authoritie from as good and well\r\nexperienced men, in the Art of which the rule treateth, as any this\r\nkingdome can produce: neither haue I beene so hasty, or willing, to\r\npublish this part as men may imagining, for it is well knowne it hath\r\nlaine at rest this many yeeres, and onely now at the Instigation of\r\nmany of my friends is bolted into the world, to try the censure of wits,\r\nand to giue aide to the ignorant Husbandman. Wherefore to leaue off any\r\nfurther digression, I will fall to mine intended purpose: and because\r\nthe whole scope of my labour hath all his aime and reuerence to the\r\nEnglish Husbandman, I will first shew you what a Husbandman is.\r\n\r\n{SN: The definition of a Husbandman.}\r\nA Husbandman is he which with discretion and good order tilleth the\r\nground in his due seasons, making it fruitfull to bring forth Corne, and\r\nplants, meete for the sustenance of man. This Husbandman is he to whom\r\nGod in the scriptures giueth many blessings, for his labours of all\r\nother are most excellent, and therefore to be a Husbandman is to be a\r\ngood man; whence the auntients did baptise, and wee euen to this day doe\r\nseriously obserue to call euery Husbandman, both in our ordinary\r\nconference and euery particular salutation, goodman such a one, a title\r\n(if wee rightly obserue it) of more honour and vertuous note, then many\r\nwhich precede it at feasts and in gaudy places.\r\n\r\n{SN: The Vtillitie of the Husbandman.}\r\nA Husbandman is the Maister of the earth, turning sterillitie and\r\nbarrainenesse, into fruitfulnesse and increase, whereby all common\r\nwealths are maintained and upheld, it is his labour which giueth bread\r\nto all men and maketh vs forsake the societie of beasts drinking vpon\r\nthe water springs, feeding vs with a much more nourishing liquor. The\r\nlabour of the Husbandman giueth liberty to all vocations, Arts,\r\nmisteries and trades, to follow their seuerall functions, with peace and\r\nindustry, for the filling and emptying of his barnes is the increase and\r\nprosperitie of all their labours. To conclude, what can we say in this\r\nworld is profitable where Husbandry is wanting, it being the great Nerue\r\nand Sinew which houldeth together all the ioynts of a Monarchie?\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the necessitie of a Husbandman.}\r\nNow for the necessitie, the profit inferreth it without any larger\r\namplification: for if of all things it be most profitable, then of all\r\nthings it must needs be most necessary, sith next vnto heauenly things,\r\nprofit is the whole aime of our liues in this world: besides it is most\r\nnecessary for keeping the earth in order, which else would grow wilde,\r\nand like a wildernesse, brambles and weeds choaking vp better Plants,\r\nand nothing remayning but a Chaos of confusednesse. And thus much of the\r\nHusbandman his vtillity and necessitie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n_Of the situation of the Husbandmans house; the necessaries there to\r\nbelonging, together with the modell thereof._\r\n\r\n\r\nSince couerture is the most necessariest thing belonging vnto mans life,\r\nand that it was the first thing that euer man inuented, I thinke it not\r\namisse first to beginne, before I enter into any other part of\r\nHusbandry, with the Husbandmans house, without which no Husbandry can be\r\nmaintained or preserued. And albeit the generall Husbandman must take\r\nsuch a house as hee can conueniently get, and according to the custome\r\nand abillitie of the soyle wherein he liueth, for many countries are\r\nvery much vnprouided of generall matter for well building: some wanting\r\ntimber, some stone, some lime, some one thing, some another: yet to that\r\nHusbandman whom God hath enabled with power both of riches and euery\r\nother necessary fit to haue all things in a comely conuenientnesse about\r\nhim, if he desire to plant himselfe decently and profitable, I would\r\nthen aduise him to chuse for his situation no high hill, or great\r\npromontary (the seate of Princes Courts) where hee may be gazed vpon by\r\nthe eye of euery traueller, but some pretty hard knole of constant and\r\nfirme earth, rather assending then descending, free from the danger of\r\nwater, and being inuironed either with some pretty groues, of tall\r\nyoung spiers, or else with rowes of greater timber, which besids the\r\npleasure and profit thereof (hauing wode so neare a mans dore) the\r\nshelter will be most excellent to keepe off the bleaknesse of the sharpe\r\nstormes and tempests in winter, and be an excellent wormestall for\r\ncattell in the summer. This house would be planted, if possible, neare\r\nto some riuer, or fresh running brooke, but by no meanes vpon the verge\r\nof the riuer, nor within the danger of the ouerflow thereof: for the one\r\nis subiect to too much coldnesse and moisture, the other to danger. You\r\nshall plant the face, or forefront, of your house vpon the rising of the\r\nSunne, that the vigor of his warmth may at no time depart from some part\r\nthereof, but that as he riseth on the oneside so he may set on the\r\nother. You shall place the vpper or best end of your house, as namely,\r\nwhere your dining Parlor and cheifest roomes are, which euer would haue\r\ntheir prospect into your garden, to the South, that your buttery,\r\nkitching and other inferiour offices may stand to the North, coldnesse\r\nbringing vnto them a manifold benefit. Now touching the forme, fashion,\r\nor modell of the house, it is impossible almost for any man to prescribe\r\na certaine forme, the world is so plentifull in inuention and euery mans\r\nminde so much adicted to nouelty and curiouity, yet for as much as it is\r\nmost commended by the generall consent of all the auntients, and that\r\nfrom the modell of that proportion may be contracted and drawne the most\r\ncurious formes that are almost at this day extant, I will commend vnto\r\nyou that modell which beareth the proportion of the Roman _H._ which as\r\nit is most plaine of all other, and most easie for conuaiance, so if a\r\nman vpon that plaine song, (hauing a great purse) will make descant,\r\nthere is no proportion in which he may with best ease show more\r\ncuriositie, and therefore for the plaine Husbandmans better\r\nvnderstanding I will here shew him a _facsimile_ (for to adde a scale\r\nwere needlesse in this generall worke, all men not being desirous to\r\nbuild of one bignesse) & this it is:\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nHere you behould the modell of a plaine country mans house, without\r\nplaster or imbosture, because it is to be intended that it is as well to\r\nbe built of studde and plaster, as of lime and stone, or if timber be\r\nnot plentifull it may be built of courser woode, and couered with lime\r\nand haire, yet if a man would bestow cost in this modell, the foure\r\ninward corners of the hall would be conuenient for foure turrets, and\r\nthe foure gauell ends, being thrust out with bay windowes might be\r\nformed in any curious manner: and where I place a gate and a plaine\r\npale, might be either a tarrisse, or a gatehouse: of any fashion\r\nwhatsoeuer, besides all those windowes which I make plaine might be made\r\nbay windowes, either with battlements, or without, but the scope of my\r\nbooke tendeth onely to the vse of the honest Husbandman, and not to\r\ninstruct men of dignitie, who in Architecture are able wonderfully to\r\ncontrole me; therefore that the Husbandman may know the vse of this\r\n_facsimile_, he shall vnderstand it by this which followeth.\r\n\r\n_A._ Signifieth the great hall.\r\n\r\n_B._ The dining Parlor for entertainment of strangers.\r\n\r\n_C._ An inward closset within the Parlor for the Mistrisses vse, for\r\nnecessaries.\r\n\r\n_D._ A strangers lodging within the Parlor.\r\n\r\n_E._ A staire-case into the roomes ouer the Parlor.\r\n\r\n_F._ A staire-case into the Good-mans roomes ouer the Kitchin and\r\nButtery.\r\n\r\n_G._ The Skreene in the hall.\r\n\r\n_H._ An inward cellar within the buttery, which may serue for a Larder.\r\n\r\n_I._ The Buttery.\r\n\r\n_K._ The Kitchin, in whose range may be placed a bruing lead, and\r\nconuenient Ouens, the bruing vessels adioyning.\r\n\r\n_L._ The Dairy house for necessary businesse.\r\n\r\n_M._ The Milke house.\r\n\r\n_N._ A faire sawne pale before the formost court.\r\n\r\n_O._ The great gate to ride in at to the hall dore.\r\n\r\n_P._ A place where a Pumpe would be placed to serue the offices of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: This figure signifieth the dores of the house.}\r\n\r\n{Illustration: This figure signifieth the windowes of the house.}\r\n\r\n{Illustration: This figure signifieth the Chimnies of the house.}\r\n\r\nNow you shall further vnderstand that on the South side of your house,\r\nyou shall plant your Garden and Orchard, as wel for the prospect thereof\r\nto al your best roomes, as also because your house will be a defence\r\nagainst the Northerne coldnesse, whereby your fruits will much better\r\nprosper. You shall on the West side of your house, within your inward\r\ndairy and kitchin court, fence in a large base court, in the midst\r\nwhereof would be a faire large Pond, well ston'd and grauelled in the\r\nbottome, in which your Cattell may drinke, and horses when necessitie\r\nshall vrge be washt: for I doe by no meanes alow washing of horses after\r\ninstant labour. Neere to this Pond you shall build your Doue-coate, for\r\nPigions delight much in the water: and you shall by no meanes make your\r\nDoue-house too high, for Pigions cannot endure a high mount, but you\r\nshall build it moderately, cleane, neate, and close, with water\r\npentisses to keepe away vermine. On the North side of your base-court\r\nyou shall build your Stables, Oxe-house, Cow-house, and Swine-coates,\r\nthe dores and windowes opening all to the South. On the South side of\r\nthe base-court, you shall builde your Hay-barnes, Corne-barnes,\r\npullen-houses for Hennes, Capons, Duckes, and Geese, your french Kilne,\r\nand Malting flowres, with such like necessaries: and ouer crosse betwixt\r\nboth these sides, you shall build your bound houels, to cary your Pease,\r\nof good and sufficient timber, vnder which you shall place when they are\r\nout of vse your Cartes, Waynes, Tumbrels, Ploughs, Harrowes, and such\r\nlike, together with Plough timber, and axletrees: all which would very\r\ncarefully be kept from wet, which of all things doth soonest rot and\r\nconsume them. And thus much of the Husbandmans house, and the\r\nnecessaries there to belonging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_Of the seuerall parts and members of an ordinarie Plough, and of the\r\nioyning of them together._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a workeman of any trade, or mistery, cannot giue directions how, and\r\nin what manner, the tooles where with he worketh should be made or\r\nfashioned, doubtlesse hee shall neuer worke well with them, nor know\r\nwhen they are in temper and when out. And so it fareth with the\r\nHusbandman, for if hee know not how his Plough should be made, nor the\r\nseuerall members of which it consisteth, with the vertue and vse of\r\neuery member, it is impossible that euer hee should make a good furrow,\r\nor turne ouer his ground in Husbandly manner: Therefore that euery\r\nHusbandman may know how a well shaped Plough is made, he shall\r\nvnderstand that the first member thereof, as being the strongest and\r\nmost principallest peece of timber belonging to the same, is called the\r\nPlough-beame, being a large long peece of timber much bending, according\r\nto the forme of this figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThis beame hath no certaine length nor thicknesse, but is proportioned\r\naccording to the ground, for if it be for a clay ground the length is\r\nalmost seauen foote, if for any other mixt or lighter earth, then fiue\r\nor sixe foote is long inough.\r\n\r\nThe second member or part of the Plough, is called the skeath, and is a\r\npeece of woode of two foote and a halfe in length, and of eight inches\r\nin breadth, and two inches in thicknesse: it is driuen extreamly hard\r\ninto the Plough-beame, slopewise, so that ioyned they present this\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThe third part is called the Ploughes principall hale, and doth belong\r\nto the left hand being a long bent peece of woode, some what strong in\r\nthe midst, and so slender at the vpper end that a man may easily gripe\r\nit, which being fixed with the rest presenteth this figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThe fourth part is the Plough head, which must be fixed with the sheath\r\n& the head all at one instant in two seuerall mortisse holes: it is a\r\nflat peece of timber, almost three foote in length if it be for clay\r\nground, otherwise shorter, of breadth seauen inches, and of thicknesse\r\ntoo inches and a halfe, which being ioyned to the rest presenteth this\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThe fift part is the Plough spindels, which are two small round pieces\r\nof woode, which coupleth together the hales, as in this figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThe sixt part is the right hand hale, through which the other end of the\r\nspindels runne, and is much slenderer then the left hand hale, for it is\r\nput to no force, but is onely a stay and aide to the Plough houlder when\r\nhee cometh to heauy, stiffe, and strong worke, and being ioyned with the\r\nrest presenteth this figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThe seauenth part is the Plough-rest, which is a small peece of woode,\r\nwhich is fixt at one end in the further nicke of the Plough head, and\r\nthe other end to the Ploughs right-hand hale, as you may see by this\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThe eight part is called the shelboard, and is a broad board of more\r\nthen an inche thicknesse, which couereth all the right side of the\r\nPlough, and is fastned with two strong pinnes of woode through the\r\nsheath, and the right-hand hale, according to this figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThe ninth part is the coulture, which is a long peece of Iron, made\r\nsharpe at the neather end, and also sharpe on one side and being for a\r\nstiffe clay it must be straight without bending, which passeth by a\r\nmortisse-hole through the beame, and to this coulture belongeth an Iron\r\nring, which windeth about the beame and keepeth it in strength from\r\nbreaking as may appeare by this figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThe tenth part of a compleate Plough, is the share; which is fixed to\r\nthe Plough head, and is that which cutteth and turneth vp the earth: if\r\nit be for a mixt earth then it is made without a wing, or with a very\r\nsmall one, but if it be for a deepe, or stiffe clay, then it is made\r\nwith a large wing, or an outward point, like the figure following.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThe eleuenth part of a perfect Plough is called the Plough foote, and is\r\nthrough a mortisse-hole fastned at the farre end of all the beame with a\r\nwedge or two, so as the Husbandman may at his discretion set it higher\r\nor lower, at his pleasure: the vse of it is to giue the Plough earth, or\r\nput it from the earth, as you please, for the more you driue it\r\ndowneward, the more it raiseth the beame from the ground, and maketh the\r\nIrons forsake the earth, and the more you driue it vpward the more it\r\nletteth downe the beame, and so maketh the Irons bite the sorer; the\r\nfigure whereof is this.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThus haue you all the parts and members of a Plough, and how they be\r\nknit and ioyned together, wherein I would wish you to obserue to make\r\nyour Plough-wright euer rather giue your Plough land then put her from\r\nthe land, that is, rather leaning towards the earth and biting sore,\r\nthen euer slipping out of the ground: for if it haue two much earth the\r\nHusbandman may help it in the houlding, but if it haue too little, then\r\nof necessitie it must make foule worke: but for as much as the error and\r\namends lye both in the office of the Plough-wright, I will not trouble\r\nthe Husbandman with the reformation thereof.\r\n\r\nNow you shall vnderstand that there is one other thing belonging to the\r\nPlough, which albe it be no member thereof, yet is it so necessary that\r\nthe Husbandman which liueth in durty and stiffe clayes can neuer goe to\r\nPlough without it, and it is called the Aker-staffe, being a pretty\r\nbigge cudgell, of about a yarde in length, with an Iron spud at the end,\r\naccording to this figure:\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThis Akerstaffe the Husbandman is euer to carry within his Plough, and\r\nwhen at any time the Irons, shelboard, or Plough, are choaked with durt,\r\nclay, or filth, which will cling about the ould stubble, then with this\r\nAkerstaffe you shall put the same off (your Plough still going) and so\r\nkeepe her cleane and smooth that your worke may lye the handsomer; and\r\nthis you must euer doe with your right hand: for the Plough choaketh\r\neuer on the shelboard side, and betweene the Irons. And thus much\r\ntouching the perfect Plough, and the members thereof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IIII.\r\n\r\n_How the Husbandman shall temper his Plough, and make her fit for his\r\nworke._\r\n\r\n\r\nA Plough is to a Husbandman like an Instrument in the hand of a\r\nMusition, which if it be out of tune can neuer make good Musicke, and so\r\nif the Plough, being out of order, if the Husbandman haue not the\r\ncunning to temper it and set it in the right way, it is impossible that\r\neuer his labour should come to good end.\r\n\r\nIt is very necessary then that euery good Husbandman know that a Plough\r\nbeing perfectly well made, the good order or disorder thereof consisteth\r\nin the placing of the Plough-Irons and the Plough-foote. Know then, that\r\nfor the placing of the Irons, the share would be set to looke a little\r\ninto the ground: and because you shall not bruise, or turne, the point\r\nthereof, you shall knocke it fast vpon the head, either with a crooked\r\nRams-horne, or else with some piece of soft Ash woode: and you shall\r\nobserue that it stand plaine, flat, and leuell, without wrying or\r\nturning either vpward or downeward: for if it runne not euen vpon the\r\nearth it will neuer make a good furrow, onely as before I said, the\r\npoint must looke a little downeward.\r\n\r\nNow, for the coulture, you must place it slopewise through the beame, so\r\nas the point of it and the point of the share may as it were touch the\r\nground at one instant, yet if the coulture point be a little thought the\r\nlonger it shall not be amisse: yet for a more certaine direction and to\r\ntry whether your Irons stand true I or no, you shall take a string, and\r\nmeasure from the mortisse-hole through which the coulture passeth, to\r\nthe point of the coulture, and so keeping your vpper hand constant lay\r\nthe same length to the of point your share, and if one measure serue\r\nthem both right, there being no difference betweene them, then the Irons\r\nstand true for their length, otherwise they stand false.\r\n\r\nNow your coulture albe it stand true for the length, yet it may stand\r\neither too much to the land, or too much from the land, either of which\r\nis a great errour, and will keepe the Plough from going true: your\r\ncoulture therefore shall haue certaine wedges of ould dry Ash woode,\r\nthat is to say, one before the coulture on the vpper side the beame, and\r\nanother on the land side, or left side, the coulture on the vpper side\r\nthe beame also; then you shall haue another wedge behinde the coulture\r\nvnderneath the beame, and one on the furrow side, or right side, the\r\nbeame vnderneath also. Now, if your coulture haue too much land, then\r\nyou shall driue in your vpper side wedge and ease the contrary: if it\r\nhaue too little land, then you shall contrarily driue in your right side\r\nvnder wedge and ease the other: If your coulture stand too forward, then\r\nyou shall driue in your vpper wedge which standeth before the coulture;\r\nand if it stand too backward and too neere your share, then you shall\r\ndriue in your vnder wedge which standeth behinde the coulture: if your\r\ncoulture standeth awry any way, then are either your side wedges too\r\nsmall, or else not euen and plaine cut, which faults you must amend, and\r\nthen all will be perfect. Now, when your Irons are iust and truely\r\nplaced, then you shall driue in euery wedge hard and firme, that no\r\nshaking or other straine may loosen them: as for the Plough foote it\r\nalso must haue a wedge or two, which when your Plough goeth right and to\r\nyour contentment (for the foote will keepe it from sinking or rising)\r\nthen you shall also driue them in hard, that the foote may not stirre\r\nfrom the true place where you did set it. And that these things when a\r\nman commeth into the field may not be to seeke, it is the office of\r\neuery good Husbandman neuer to goe forth with his Plough but to haue his\r\nHatchet in a socket, fixt to his Plough beame, and a good piece of hard\r\nwedge woode, in case any of your wedges should shake out and be lost.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of holding the Plough.}\r\nWhen your Plough is thus ordered and tempered in good manner, and made\r\nfit for her worke, it then resteth that you know the skill and\r\naduantages in holding thereof, which indeed are rules of much\r\ndiuersitie, for if it be a stiffe, blacke clay which you Plow, then can\r\nyou not Plow too deepe, nor make your furrowes too bigge: if it be a\r\nrich hassell ground, and not much binding, then reasonable furrowes,\r\nlaid closse, are the best: but if it be any binding, stony, or sandy\r\nground, then you cannot make your furrowes too small. As touching the\r\ngouerning of your Plough, if you see shee taketh too much land, then you\r\nshall writh your left hand a little to the left side and raise your\r\nPlough rest somewhat from the ground: if shee taketh too little earth,\r\nthen you shall raise vp your left hand, and carry your Plough as in a\r\ndirect line: If your Plough-Irons forbeare and will not bite on the\r\nearth at all, then it is a signe that you hang too heauy on the Plough\r\nhales, raising the head of the Plough from the ground, which errour you\r\nmust amend, and of the two rather raise it vp behind then before, but to\r\ndoe neither is best, for the Plough hale is a thing for the hand to\r\ngouerne, and not to make a leaning stocke of: And thus much touching the\r\ntempring of the Plough and making her fit for worke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_The manner of Plowing the rich, stiffe, blacke Clay, his Earings,\r\nPlough, and other Instruments._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all soyles in this our kingdome there is none so rich and fruitfull,\r\nif it be well handled and Husbanded, as is that which we call the\r\nstiffe, blacke, Clay, and indeed is more blacker to looke on then any\r\nother soyle, yet some times it will turne vp very blewish, with many\r\nwhite vaines in it, which is a very speciall note to know his\r\nfruitfulnesse; for that blewish earth mixt with white is nothing else\r\nbut very rich Marle, an earth that in Cheshire, Lanckashire, and many\r\nother countries, serueth to Manure and make fat their barrainest land in\r\nsuch sort that it will beare Corne seauen yeeres together. This blacke\r\nclay as it is the best soyle, well Husbanded, so it is of all soyles the\r\nworst if it be ill Husbanded: for if it loose but one ardor, or\r\nseasenable Plowing, it will not be recouered in foure yeeres after, but\r\nwill naturally of it selfe put forth wilde Oates, Thistels, and all\r\nmanner of offensiue weedes, as Cockle, Darnell, and such like: his\r\nlabour is strong, heauy, and sore, vnto the cattell that tilleth it, but\r\nto the Husbandman is more easie then any other soyle, for this asketh\r\nbut foure times Plowing ouer at the most, where diuers other soyles aske\r\nfiue times, and sixe times, as shalbe shewed hereafter. But to come to\r\nthe Plowing of this soyle, I hold it meete to beginne with the beginning\r\nof the yeere, which with Husbandmen is at Plow-day, being euer the first\r\nMunday after the Twelft-day, at which time you shall goe forth with your\r\ndraught, & begin to plow your Pease-earth, that is, the earth where you\r\nmeane to sow your Pease, or Beanes: for I must giue you to vnderstand,\r\nthat these Clayes are euer more naturall for Beanes then Pease, not but\r\nthat they will beare both alike, only the Husbandman imployeth them more\r\nfor Beanes, because pease & fitches wil grow vpon euery soyle, but\r\nBeanes wil grow no where but on the clayes onely. This Pease-earth is\r\neuer where barley grew the yeere before, & hath the stubble yet\r\nremayning thereon. You shal plow this Pease-earth euer vpward, that is,\r\nyou shall beginne on the ridge of the land, & turne all your furrowes\r\nvp, one against another, except your lands lye too high (which seldome\r\ncan be seene) and then you shall begin at the furrow, & cast downe your\r\nland.\r\n\r\nNow, when you haue plowed all your Pease-ground, you shall let it so\r\nlye, till it haue receiued diuers Frosts, some Raine, and then a fayre\r\nseason, which betwixt plow-day and Saint _Valentines_ day you shalbe\r\nsure to inioy: and this is called, _The letting of Land lye to baite_:\r\nfor without this rest, and these seasons, it is impossible to make these\r\nClayes harrow, or yeelde any good mould at all. After your Land hath\r\nreceiued his kindely baite, then you shall cast in your seede, of\r\nBeanes, or Pease: but in my conceit, an equall mixture of them is the\r\nbest seede of all, for if the one faile, the other will be sure to hit:\r\nand when your land is sowne you shall harrow it with a harrow that hath\r\nwoodden teeth.\r\n\r\nThe next Ardor after this, is the sowing of your Barley in your fallow\r\nfield: the next is the fallowing of your ground for Barley the next\r\nyeere: the next Ardor is the Summer-stirring of that which you fallowed:\r\nthe next is the foyling of that which you Summer-stirde: and the last is\r\nthe Winter rigging of that which you foil'd: of all which Ardors, and\r\nthe manner of Plowing them, with their seasons, I haue written\r\nsufficiently in the first Chapter of the next part; where I speake of\r\nsimple earths vncompounded.\r\n\r\nNow whereas I told you before that these clayes were heauy worke for\r\nyour Cattell, it is necessary that I shew you how to ease them, and\r\nwhich way they may draw to their most aduantage, which onely is by\r\ndrawing in beare-geares, an inuention the skilfull Husbandman hath found\r\nout, wherein foure horses shall draw as much as sixe, and sixe as eight,\r\nbeing geard in any other contrary fashion. Now because the name onely\r\nbettereth not your knowledge, you shall heare behould the figure and\r\nmanner thereof.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nNow you shall vnderstand the vse of this Figure by the figures therein\r\ncontayned, that is to say, the figure\r\n\r\n(1) presenteth the plough-cleuisse, which being ioyned to the\r\nplough-beame, extendeth, with a chaine, vnto the first Toastree: and\r\ntouching this Cleuisse, you shall vnderstand, that it must be made with\r\nthree nickes in the midst thereof, that if the Plough haue too much land\r\ngiuen it in the making, that is, if it turne vp too much land, then the\r\nchaine shall be put in the outwardmost nicke to the land side, that is,\r\nthe nicke towards your right hand: but if it take too little land, then\r\nit shall be put in the nicke next the furrow, that is, towards the right\r\nhand: but if it goe euen and well, then you shall keepe it in the middle\r\nnicke, which is the iust guide of true proportion. And thus this\r\nCleuisse is a helpe for the euill making or going of a plough.\r\n\r\n(2) Is the hind-most Toastree, that is, a broad piece of Ash woode,\r\nthree inches broad, which going crosse the chaine, hath the Swingletrees\r\nfastned vnto it, by which the horses draw. Now you shall vnderstand that\r\nin this Toastree is great helpe and aduantage: for if the two horses\r\nwhich draw one against the other, be not of equall strength, but that\r\nthe one doth ouer-draw the other, then you shall cause that end of the\r\nToastree by which the weaker horse drawes, to be longer from the chaine\r\nthen the other, by at least halfe a foote, and that shall giue the\r\nweaker horse such an aduantage, that his strength shall counterpoyse\r\nwith the stronger horse. Now there be some especiall Husbandmen that\r\nfinding this disaduantage in the Toastree, and that by the vncertaine\r\nshortening, and lenthening of the Toastree, they haue sometimes more\r\ndisaduantaged the strong horse, then giuen helpe to the weake, therefore\r\nthey haue inuented another Toastree, with a double chaine, and a round\r\nring, which is of that excellent perfection in draught, that if a Foale\r\ndraw against an olde horse, yet the Foale shall draw no more then the\r\nabilitie of his owne strength, each taking his worke by himselfe, as if\r\nthey drew by single chaines. Now because this Toastree is such a notable\r\nImplement both in Plough, Cart, or Waine, and so worthy to be imitated\r\nof all good husbands, I thinke it not amisse to shew you the figure\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The Toastree with double chaines.}\r\n\r\n(3) The Swingletrees, being pieces of Ash wood cut in proportion\r\nafore-shewed, to which the Treates, by which the horses draw, are\r\nfastned with strong loopes.\r\n\r\n(4) The Treates by which the horses draw, being strong cords made of the\r\nbest Hempe.\r\n\r\n(5) The place betweene the Treats, where the horses must stand.\r\n\r\n(6) The Hames, which girt the Collers about, to which the other end of\r\nthe Treats are fastned, being compassed pieces of wood, eyther cleane\r\nAsh, or cleane Oake.\r\n\r\n(7) The round Withes of wood, or broad thongs of leather, to put about\r\nthe horses necke, to beare the maine chayne from the ground, that it\r\ntrouble not the horses in their going.\r\n\r\n(8) The Single-linckes of Iron, which ioyne the Swingle-trees vnto the\r\nToastrees.\r\n\r\n(9) The Belly-bands, which passe vnder the belly of the horse, and are\r\nmade fast to both sides of the Treates, keeping them downe, that when\r\nthe horse drawes, his coller may not choake him: being made of good\r\nsmall line or coard.\r\n\r\n(10) The Backe-bands, which going ouer the horses backe, and being made\r\nfast to both sides of the Treates, doe hold them, so as when the horses\r\nturne, the Treates doe not fall vnder their feete.\r\n\r\n{SN: How many beasts in a plough.}\r\nThus I haue giuen you the perfect portraiture of a well yoakt Plough,\r\ntogether with his Implements, and the vse of them, being the best which\r\nhath yet beene found out by any of our skilfullest English Husbandmen,\r\nwhose practise hath beene vpon these deepe, stiffe, blacke clayes. Now\r\nyou shall vnderstand, that for the number of Cattell to be vsed in these\r\nploughes, that in fallowing your land, and plowing your Pease-earth,\r\neight good Cattell are the best number, as being the strongest, and\r\nwithin the compasse of gouernment, whereas more were but troublesome,\r\nand in all your other Ardors, sixe good beasts are sufficient, yet if it\r\nbe so, that eyther want of abilitie, or other necessity vrge, you shall\r\nknow that sixe beasts will suffice eyther to fallow, or to plow\r\nPease-earth, and foure beasts for euery other Ardor or earing: and lesse\r\nthen this number is most insufficient, as appeares by daily experience,\r\nwhen poore men kill their Cattell onely by putting them to ouer-much\r\nlabour. And thus much touching the plowing of the blacke clay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n_The manner of plowing the white or gray Clay, his Earings, Plough, and\r\nInstruments._\r\n\r\n\r\nNow as touching the white or gray clay, you shall vnderstand that it is\r\nof diuers and sundry natures, altering according to his tempers of wet\r\nor drynesse: the wet being more tough, and the dry more brittle: his\r\nmixture and other characters I haue shewed in a former Chapter,\r\nwherefore for his manner of plowing (obseruing my first methode, which\r\nis to beginne with the beginning of the yeere, I meane at Christmas) it\r\nis thus:\r\n\r\n{SN: Of sowing of Pease and Beanes.}\r\nIf you finde that any of this white or gray clay, lying wet, haue lesse\r\nmixture of stone or chaulke in it, and so consequently be more tough, as\r\nit doth many times fall out, and that vpon such land, that yeere, you\r\nare to sow your Pease and Beanes: for as in the former blacke clay, so\r\nin this gray clay you shall begin with your Pease-earth euer: then\r\nimmediately after Plow-day, you shall plow vp such ground as you finde\r\nso tough, in the selfe-same manner as you did plow the blacke clay, and\r\nso let it lye to baite till the frost haue seasoned it, and then sow it\r\naccordingly. But if you haue no such tough land, but that it holdes it\r\nowne proper nature, being so mixt with small stones and chaulke, that it\r\nwill breake in reasonable manner, then you shall stay till the latter\r\nend of Ianuary, at what time, if the weather be seasonable, and\r\ninclining to drynesse, you shall beginne to plow your Pease-earth, in\r\nthis manner: First, you shall cause your seedes-man to sow the land with\r\nsingle casts, as was shewed vpon the blacke clay, with this caution,\r\nthat the greater your seede is, (that is, the more Beanes you sow) the\r\ngreater must be your quantitie: and being sowne, you shall bring your\r\nplough, and beginning at the furrow of the land, you shall plow euery\r\nfurrow downeward vpon the Pease and Beanes: which is called sowing of\r\nPease vnder furrow: and in this manner you shall sow all your Pease and\r\nBeanes, which is cleane contrary to your blacke clay. Besides, whereas\r\nvpon the stiffe clay it is conuenient to take as large furrowes as you\r\nplease, vpon this kinde of gray clay you shall take as small furrowes as\r\nis possible. Now the reason for this manner of plowing your Pease-earth,\r\nis, because it is a light kinde of breaking earth, so that should it be\r\nsowne according to the stiffe blacke clay, it would neuer couer your\r\nPease, but leaue them bare, both to be destroyed by the Fowles of the\r\nayre, and the bitternesse of the weather. As soone as your Pease and\r\nBeanes are risen a fingers length aboue the earth, then if you finde\r\nthat any of your lands doe lye very rough, and that the clods be great,\r\nit shall not be amisse, to take a payre of woodden Harrowes, and harrow\r\nouer all your rough lands, the benefit whereof is this, that it will\r\nboth breake the hard clots, and so giue those Pease leaue to sprout\r\nthrough the earth, which before lay bound in and drowned, and also lay\r\nyour lands smooth and cleane, that the Mowers when they come to mowe\r\nyour Pease and Beanes, shall haue better worke, and mowe them with more\r\nease, and much better to the owners profit. For you must vnderstand that\r\nwhere you sow Beanes, there it is euer more profit to mowe them with\r\nSythes, then to reape them with Hookes, and much sooner, and with lesse\r\ncharge performed. The limitation of time for this Ardor of earing, is\r\nfrom the latter end of Ianuary vntill the beginning of March, not\r\nforgetting this rule, that to sow your Pease and Beanes in a shower, so\r\nit be no beating raine is most profitable: because they, as Wheat, take\r\ndelight in a fresh and a moyst mould.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of sowing of Barley.}\r\nAfter the beginning of March, you shall beginne to sow your Barley vpon\r\nthat ground which the yeere before did lye fallow, and is commonly\r\ncalled your tilth, or fallow field: and if any part of it consist of\r\nstiffe and tough ground, then you shall, vpon such ground, sow your\r\nBarley vnder furrow, in such manner and fashion as I described vnto you\r\nfor the sowing of your stiffe blacke clay: but if it be (as for the most\r\npart these gray and white clayes are) of a much lighter, and as it were,\r\nfussie temper, then you shall first plow your land vpward, cleane and\r\nwell, without baukes or stiches: and hauing so plowed it, you shall then\r\nsow it with Barley, that is to say, with double casts, I meane,\r\nbestowing twise so many casts of Barley, as you would doe if you were to\r\nsow it with Pease. And as soone as you haue sowne your Barley, you shall\r\ntake a payre of woodden Harrowes, and harrow it as small as is possible:\r\nand this is called sowing aboue furrow.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of sowing Oates.}\r\nNow if you haue any land, which eyther through the badnesse of the\r\nsoyle, or for want of manure, is more barrayne, and hard to bring forth\r\nthen generally the rest of your land is, then you shall not bestow\r\nBarley thereupon, but sow it with Oates, in such manner and fashion as\r\nis appointed for the sowing of Pease, that is to say, if it be stiffe\r\nground you shall sow it aboue furrow, if it be light ground, then you\r\nshall sow it vnder furrow, knowing this for a rule, that the barraynest\r\nground will euer beare indifferent Oates, but if the ground haue any\r\nsmall hart, then it will beare Oates in great abundance: neither neede\r\nyou to be very precise for the oft plowing of your ground before you sow\r\nyour Oates, because Oates will grow very well if they be sowne vpon\r\nreasonable ground, at the first plowing: whence it comes to passe that\r\nmany Husbandmen doe oft sow their Oates where they should sow their\r\nPease, and in the same manner as they doe sow their Pease, and it is\r\nheld for a rule of good husbandry also: because if the ground be held\r\nany thing casuall for Pease, it is better to haue good Oates then\r\nnaughty Pease: besides, your Oates are both a necessary graine in the\r\nhouse, as for Oate-meale, for the pot, for Puddings, and such like, and\r\nalso for the stable, for Prouender, and the feeding of all manner of\r\nPoultry. The time for sowing of your Barley and Oates, is from from the\r\nfirst of March till the first of Aprill, obseruing euer to sow your\r\nOates first, and your Barley after, for it being onely a Summer graine,\r\nwould participate as little as may be with any part of the Winter.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Fallowing.}\r\n{SN: Of sleighting Barley.}\r\nAbout the middest of Aprill you shall beginne to fallow that part of\r\nyour ground, which you entend shall take rest that yeere, and so become\r\nyour fallow or tilth-field. And in fallowing this gray or white clay,\r\nyou shall obserue all those rules and ceremonies, which are formerly\r\ndescribed for the fallowing of the stiffe blacke clay, knowing that\r\nthere is in this worke no difference betweene the blacke clay, and the\r\ngray clay, but both to be plowed after one manner, that is to say, to\r\nhaue all the furrowes cast downeward, and the ridges of the lands laid\r\nlargely open, and of a good depth, onely the furrowes which you turne\r\nvpon this gray clay must be much smaller and lesse then those which you\r\nturne vpon your stiffe blacke clay, because this earth is more naturally\r\ninclined to binde and cleaue together then that of the blacke clay. The\r\ntime for fallowing of this ground, is from the middest of Aprill vntill\r\nthe middest of May: at what time you shall perceiue your Barley to\r\nappeare aboue the ground, so that then you shall beginne to sleight and\r\nsmooth it: but not with backe Harrowes, as was described for the blacke\r\nclay, because this gray clay being not so fat and rich, but more\r\ninclined to fastnesse and hardnesse, therefore it will not sunder and\r\nbreake so easily as the other: wherefore when you will smooth or sleight\r\nthis ground, you shall take a round piece of wood, being in compasse\r\nabout at least thirty inches, and in length sixe foote, hauing at each\r\nend a strong pinne of Iron, to which making fast two small poales, by\r\nwhich the horse shall draw, yet in such sort that the round piece of\r\nwood may roule and turne about as the horse drawes it: and with this you\r\nshall roule ouer all your Barley, and by the waight of the round piece\r\nof wood bruise and breake all the hard clots asunder. This is called\r\namongst Husbandmen a Rouler, and is for this purpose of sleighting and\r\nsmoothing of grounds of great vse and profit. Now you shall vnderstand\r\nthat you must not at any time sleight or smooth your Corne, but after a\r\nshower of Raine, for if the mould be not a little moistned the rouler\r\nwill not haue power to breake it.\r\n\r\nNow for as much as this rouler is of so good vse and yet not generally\r\nvsed in this kingdome, I thinke it not amisse to shew you the figure\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The great Rouler.}\r\n\r\nAs soone as you haue roulled ouer your Barley, & laid it so smooth as\r\nyou can with your rouler, if then you perceiue any hard clots, such as\r\nthe rouler cannot breake, then you shal send forth your seruants with\r\nlong clotting beetels, made broad and flat, and with them you shall\r\nbreake asunder all those hard clots, and so lay your Barley as smooth\r\nand cleane as is possible: the profit whereof you shall both finde in\r\nthe multiplying of your Corne and also in the sauing of your sithes\r\nfrom breaking, at such time as you shall come to mowe your Corne, and\r\ngather in your Haruest.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Summer-stirring.}\r\n{SN: Of weeding.}\r\n{SN: Of stone gathering.}\r\nYour Barley being thus laide smooth, you shall then follow your other\r\nnecessary businesses, as preparing of your fewell, and other needements\r\nfor houshould, vntill the beginning of Iune, at which time you shall\r\nbeginne to Summer-stirre your fallow field, which shalbe done in all\r\npoints after the same manner as you did Summer-stirre your blacke Clay,\r\nthat is to say, you shall beginne in the ridge of the land, and as when\r\nyou fallowed your land you turned your furrowes downeward, so now in\r\nSummer-stirring, you shall turne your furrowes vpward and close the\r\nridge of you land againe. As soone as this Ardor is finished, or when\r\nthe vnseasonablenesse of the weather, as either too much wet, or too\r\nmuch drynesse shall hinder you from Plowing, you shall then looke into\r\nyour Cornefields, that is to say: first into your Wheate and Rye field,\r\nand if there you shall finde any store of weedes, as Thistell, Darnell,\r\nTare-Cockle, or such like, you shall with weede-hookes, or nippers of\r\nwoode, cut, or plucke them vp by the rootes; and also if you finde any\r\nannoyance of stones, which hinders the growth of your Corne, as\r\ngenerally it happens in this soyle, you shall then cause some Boyes and\r\nGirles, or other waste persons, to gather them vp and lay them in heapes\r\nat the lands ends, to be imployed either about the mending of high wayes\r\nor other occasions, and for this purpose their is a generall custome in\r\nmost Villages, that euery houshoulder is bound to send out one seruant\r\nto be imployed about this businesse: whence it comes to passe, that it\r\nis called common worke, as being done at the generall charge of the\r\nwhole Parish. After you haue weeded your Wheate and Rye, you shall then\r\nweede your Barley also, which being finished about the midst of Iuly,\r\nyou shall then beginne to looke into your medowes and to the preparing\r\nof your Hay haruest.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of foyling.}\r\nNow at such time as either the vnseasonablenesse of the weather, or the\r\ngrowth of your grasse shall hinder you from following that businesse of\r\nHaruest, you shall then looke into your fallow or tilth field againe,\r\nand whereas before at your Summer-stirring you Plowed your land vpward,\r\nnow you shall beginne to foile, that is to say, you shall cast your land\r\ndowne againe, and open the ridge: and this Ardor of all other Ardors you\r\nmust by no meanes neglect vpon the gray, white clay, because it being\r\nmost subiect vnto weede, and the hardest to bring to a fine mould, this\r\nArdor of all others, doth both consume the one and makes perfect the\r\nother, and the drier season you doe foile your land in, the better it\r\nis, and the more it doth breake and sunder the clots in pieces: for as\r\nin Summer-stirring the greater clots you raise vp, and the rougher your\r\nland lies the better it is, because it is a token of great store of\r\nmould, so when you foile, the more you breake the clots in pieces the\r\nbetter season will your land take, and the richer it wilbe when the\r\nseede is sowne into it: And the season for the foiling of this soile is\r\nfrom the midst of Iuly till the midst of September.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Manuring.}\r\nNow albe I haue omitted the Manuring of this land in his due place, as\r\nnamely, from the midst of Aprill, till the end of May, yet you shall\r\nvnderstand that of all other things it is not in any wise to be\r\nneglected by the carefull Husbandman, both because the soyle being not\r\nso rich as the blacke Clay, will very hardly bring forth his seede\r\nwithout Manure, and also because it is for the most part subiect vnto\r\nmuch wet, and stones, both which are signes of cold and barrainenesse.\r\nNow for those Manures, which are best and most proper for this soile,\r\nyou shall vnderstand that all those which I formerlie described for the\r\nblacke Claies, as namely, Oxe or Cowes dung, Horse dung and Sheepes\r\ndung, are also very good for this soile, and to be vsed in the same\r\nmanner as is specified in the former Chapter: but if you haue not such\r\nstore of this Manure as will serue to compasse your whole land, you\r\nshall then vnderstand, that the blacke mud, or durt which lies in the\r\nbottome of olde ponds, or else standing lakes, is also a very good\r\nmanure for this soile, or else straw which is spread in high-wayes, and\r\nso rotted by the great concourse or vse of much trauelling, and after in\r\nthe Spring-time shouelled vp in great heapes, is a good manure for this\r\nearth: but if you finde this soile to be subiect to extraordinary wet\r\nand coldnesse, you shall then know that the ashes eyther of wood, coale,\r\nor straw, is a very good manure for it. But aboue all other, and then\r\nwhich there is no manure more excellent for cold barraine clayes of this\r\nnature, the Pigions dung, or the dung of houshold Pullen, as Capons,\r\nHennes, Chickens, Turkies, and such like, so there be no Goose-dung\r\namongst it, is the best of all other: but not to be vsed in such sort as\r\nthe other manures, that is to say, to be laid in great heapes vpon the\r\nland, or to be spread from the Cart vpon the land, for neyther is there\r\nsuch abundance of such manure to be gotten, nor if there were, it would\r\nnot be held for good husbandrie to make lauish hauocke of a thing so\r\nprecious.\r\n\r\n{SN: The vse of Pigion or Pullen-dung.}\r\nYou shall then know that for the vse of Pigion or Pullen-dung, it is\r\nthus: you shall first with your hand breake it as small as may be, and\r\nthen put it into the Hopper, in such sort as you put your corne when you\r\nsow it: and then looke how you sow your corne, in such sort you shall\r\nsow your Pigion or Pullen-dung: which done, you shall immediately put\r\nyour Barley into the same Hopper, and so sow it after the Pigions or\r\nPullen-dung: by which you are to vnderstand that this kinde of manuring\r\nis to be vsed onely in Seede-time, and at no other season. This manure\r\nis of the same nature that sheepes manure is, and doth last but onely\r\nfor one yeere, onely it is much hotter, as being in the greatest\r\nextremitie of heate. Now if it happen that you cannot get any of this\r\nPigions or Pullen-dung, because it is scarce, and not in euery mans\r\npower, if then you take Lime and sow it vpon your land in such sort as\r\nis before said of the Pigions-dung, and then sow your corne after it,\r\nyou shall finde great profit to come thereon, especially in colde wet\r\nsoiles, such as for the most part, these gray white clayes are.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of sowing Wheate.}\r\nAfter your land is foild, which worke would be finished by the middest\r\nof September, then you shall beginne to sow your Wheate, Rye, and\r\nMaslin, which in all things must be done as is before set downe for the\r\nblacke clay, the choice of seede, and euery obseruation being all one:\r\nfor Wheate not taking delight in a very rich ground, doth prosper best\r\nvpon this indifferent soile. Whence it comes that in these gray white\r\nclayes, you shall for the most part, see more Wheate sowne then any\r\nother Graine whatsoeuer. But as touching your Rye and Maslin, that euer\r\ndesires a rich ground and a fine mould, and therefore you shall make\r\nchoise of your better earth for that Seede, and also obserue to helpe it\r\nwith manure, or else sheepes folding, in such manner as is described in\r\nthe former Chapter, where I spake of the sowing of Wheate, Rye, and\r\nMaslin.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of winter-ridging.}\r\nAs soone as you haue sowne your Wheate, Rye, and Maslin, you shall then\r\nabout the latter end of October, beginne to Winter ridge, or set vp your\r\nland for the whole yeere: which you shall doe in all points, as you doe\r\nvpon the blacke clay, without any change or alteration. And the\r\nlimitation for this Ardor is, from the latter end of October vntill the\r\nbeginning of December, wherein your yeeres worke is made perfect and\r\ncompleate.\r\n\r\n{SN: Obseruations.}\r\nNow you shall vnderstand, that although I haue in this generall sort\r\npassed ouer the Ardors and seuerall Earings of this white or gray clay,\r\nany of which are in no wise to be neglected: yet there are sundry other\r\nobseruations to be held of the carefull Husbandman, especially in the\r\nlaying of his land: as thus, if the soile be of good temper, fruitfull,\r\ndrie, and of a well mixed mould, not being subiect to any naturall\r\nspring or casting forth of moisture, but rather through the natiue\r\nwarmth drying vp all kinde of fluxes or colde moistures, neyther binding\r\nor strangling the Seede, nor yet holding it in such loosenesse, that it\r\nloose his force of increasing, in this case it is best to lay your\r\nlands flat and leuell, without ridges or furrowes, as is done in many\r\nparts of Cambridge-shire, some parts of Essex, and some parts of\r\nHartford-shire: but if the clay be fruitfull and of good temper, yet\r\neither by the bordering of great hils, the ouer-flow of small brookes,\r\nor some other casuall meanes it is subiect to much wet or drowning, in\r\nthis case you shall lay your lands large and high, with high ridges and\r\ndeepe furrowes, as generally you see in Lincolne-shire,\r\nNottingham-shire, Huntington-shire, and most of the middle Shires in\r\nEngland. But if the land be barraine, colde, wet, subiect to much\r\nbinding, and doth bring forth great store of weedes, then you shall lay\r\nyour land in little stiches, that is to say, not aboue three or foure\r\nfurrowes at the most together, as is generally seene in Middlesex,\r\nHartford-shire, Kent and Surrey: for by that meanes neither shall the\r\nland binde and choake the Corne, nor shall the weede so ouer-runne it,\r\nbut that the Husbandman may with good ease helpe to strengthen and\r\nclense it, the many furrowes both giuing him many passages, whereby he\r\nmay correct those enormities, and also in such sort conuaying away the\r\nwater and other moistures, that there cannot be made any land more\r\nfruitfull.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the Plough.}\r\nNow to speake of the Plough which is best and most proper for this gray\r\nor white clay, of which we now speake, you shall vnderstand that it\r\ndiffereth exceeding much from that of which we spake concerning the\r\nblacke clay: I, and in such sort, that there is but small alliance or\r\naffinitie betweene them: as thus for example:\r\n\r\nFirst, it is not so large and great as that for the blacke clay: for the\r\nhead thereof is not aboue twentie inches in length, and not aboue one\r\ninch and a halfe in thicknesse, the maine beame thereof is not aboue\r\nfiue foot long, & the rest is broader by an inch and more then that for\r\nthe blacke clay: this Plough also hath but one hale, & that is onely the\r\nleft hand Hale: for the Plough-staffe, or Aker-staffe serueth euer in\r\nstead of the right hand Hale, so that the Rough-staues are fixed, the\r\nvpper vnto the shelboard, and the neather vnto the Plough-rest, as for\r\nyour better vnderstanding you may perceiue by this figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The Plough with one Hale.}\r\n\r\nNow you shall vnderstand that the especiall care which is to be held in\r\nthe making of this Plough, is, that it be wide and open in the hinder\r\npart, that it may turne and lay the furrowes one vpon another: whereas\r\nif it should be any thing straitned in the hinder part, considering that\r\nthis clay naturally is somewhat brittle of it selfe, and that the\r\nfurrowes which you plow must of necessitie be very narrow and little, it\r\nwere not possible so to lay them, but that they would fall downe backe\r\nagaine, and inforce the Plow-man to lose his labour. Also you shall\r\nvnderstand that whereas in the former plough, which is for the blacke\r\nclay, you may turne the shelboard, that is, when the one end is worne,\r\nyou may eftsoones turne the other, and make it serue the like season: in\r\nthis Plough you must neuer turne the shelboard, because the rising wing\r\nof the Share will so defend it, that it will euer last as long as the\r\nPlough-head, without change or turning.\r\n\r\nNow for the Irons belonging vnto this Plough, which is the Share and\r\nCoulture, there is more difference in them then in the Plough: for to\r\nspeake first of the Share, whereas the former Share for the blacke clay,\r\nwas made broad, plaine, and with a large wing, this Share must be made\r\nnarrow, sharpe, and small, with no wing at all, hauing from the vpper\r\npart thereof, close by the shelboard, a certaine rising wing, or broad\r\npiece of Iron, which comming vp and arming that part of the shelboard\r\nwhich turnes ouer the land, defends the wood from the sharpe mould,\r\nwhich hauing the mixture of pible stone in it, would otherwise in lesse\r\nthen one dayes worke consume the shelboard vnto nothing, forcing the\r\nPlow-man to much trouble and double cost. The fashion of the Share is\r\npresented in this Figure following.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The Share.}\r\n\r\nThis Share is onely made that it may take a small furrow, and so by\r\nbreaking the earth oftner then any other Share, causeth the land to\r\nyeeld a good and plentifull mould, and also keepe it from binding or\r\nchoaking the seede when it is cast into it.\r\n\r\nNow for the Coulture, it differeth from the former Coulture both in\r\nbreadth and thicknesse, but especially in compasse: for whereas the\r\nformer Coulture for the blacke clay, was made straight, narrow, and\r\nthicke, this must be compassed like an halfe bent bow: it must be\r\nbroader then three fingers, and thinner then halfe an inche, according\r\nto this Figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The Coulture.}\r\n\r\nNow when these Irons, the Shelboard, and other implements are fixed vnto\r\nthe Plough, you shall perceiue that the Plough will carry the proportion\r\nof this Figure following.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The Plough for the gray Clay.}\r\n\r\nHauing thus shewed you the substance, difference, and contraries of\r\nthese two Ploughs, which belong to these two seuerall clayes, the blacke\r\nand gray, you shall vnderstand that there is no clay-ground whatsoeuer,\r\nwhich is without other mixture, but one of these Ploughs will\r\nsufficiently serue to eare and order it: for all clayes are of one of\r\nthese tempers.\r\n\r\n{SN: The vse and handling.}\r\nNow for the vse and manner of handling or holding this Plough, it\r\ndiffereth nothing in particular obseruation from the vse and handling\r\nof the Plough formerly described, more then in the largenesse and\r\nsmalnesse of the furrowes: for as before I said, whereas the blacke clay\r\nmust be raised with a great furrow, and a broad stitch, this gray clay\r\nmust be raised with a small furrow, and a narrow stitch: and although\r\nthis plough haue nothing but a left hand Hale, yet considering the\r\nPlough-staffe, vpon which the Plow-man resteth his right hand, it is all\r\none as if he had a right. And indeede, to make your knowledge the more\r\nperfect, you shall know that these gray clayes are generally in their\r\nowne natures so wet, tough, and slimy, and doe so clogge, cleaue, and\r\nchoake vp the Plough, that hee which holds it shall haue enough to doe\r\nwith his right hand onely to clense and keepe the Plough from choaking,\r\ninsomuch that if there were another Hale, yet the Plow-man should haue\r\nno leasure to hold it.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the draught or Teame.}\r\nNow for the Draught or Teame which should draw this Plough, they ought\r\nin all points, as well in strength as tryuing to be the same with those\r\nbefore shewed for the vse of the blacke clay: as namely, eyther Oxen or\r\nHorse, or Horse and Oxen mixt together, according to the custome of the\r\nsoile wherein the Plow-man liues, or his abilitie in prouision,\r\nobseruing euer to keepe his number of beasts for his Plough certaine,\r\nthat is to say, for fallowing, and Pease-earth, neuer vnder sixe, and\r\nfor all other Ardors foure at the least. And thus much for the plowing\r\nof this gray or white clay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n_The manner of plowing the red-Sand, his Earings, Plough, and Implements._\r\n\r\n\r\nNext vnto these Clayes, which are soiles simple and vncompound, as being\r\nperfect in their owne natures, without the helpe of other mixtures, I\r\nplace the Sand soiles, as being of like qualitie, not borrowing any\r\nthing but from their owne natures, nor breeding any defects more then\r\ntheir owne naturall imperfections: and of Sands, sith the red Sand is\r\nthe best and most fruitfull, therefore it is fit that it take prioritie\r\nof place, and be here first spoken of.\r\n\r\nYou shall then vnderstand that this red Sand, albeit it is the best of\r\nSands, yet it is the worst of many soiles, as being of it selfe of such\r\na hot and drie nature, that it scorcheth the seede, and dryeth vp that\r\nnutriment and fatnesse which should occasion increase: whereby it comes\r\nto passe, that the Barley which growes vpon this red Sand is euer more\r\nyealow, leane and withered, then that which growes vpon the clayes or\r\nother mixt earths. This Sand especially taketh delight in Rye, because\r\nit is a Graine which loues warmth aboue all other, and yet\r\nnotwithstanding, if it be well ordered, manured and plowed, it will\r\nbring forth good store of Barley, albeit the Barley be not so good as\r\nClay-Barley, either for the colour, or for the yeeld, whether it be in\r\nmeale or in Malt.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Fallowing.}\r\nNow for the manner of Earing or plowing this redde Sand, it differeth\r\nmuch from both the former soyles, insomuch that for your better\r\nvnderstanding, I must in many places alter my former methode, yet so\r\nlittle as may be, because I am loath to alter or clogge the memory of\r\nthe Reader: wherefore to pursue my purpose. As soone as Christmas is\r\nended, that is to say, about the middest of Ianuary, you shall goe with\r\nyour Plough into that field where the Haruest before did grow your Rye,\r\nand there you shall in your plowing cast your lands downe-ward, and open\r\nthe ridges well, for this yeere it must be your fallow field: for as in\r\nthe former soiles, wee did diuide the fields either into three parts,\r\nthat is, one for Barley and Wheate, another for Pease, and the third\r\nfallow, which is the best diuision: or into foure parts, that is, one\r\nfor Wheate and Rye, another for Barley, a third for Pease, and a fourth\r\nfallow, which is the worst diuision and most toilesome, so in this red\r\nSand soile, we must euer diuide it into three parts, that is, one for\r\nBarley, another for Rye, and a third fallow. For this Sand-soile being\r\nhot, drie, and light, will neither bring forth good Beanes nor good\r\nPease, and therefore that Ardor is in this place but onely to be spoke\r\nof by way of discourse in vrgent necessitie.\r\n\r\nWherefore (as before I said) about the middest of Ianuary you shall\r\nbeginne to lay fallow that field, where formerly did grow your Rye, the\r\nmanner of plowing whereof differeth nothing from the manner of plowing\r\nthe clayes before written of, onely that the discretion of the Plow-man\r\nmust thus farre forth gouerne him, that in as much as this soile is\r\nlighter, dryer, and of a more loose temper, by so much the more he must\r\nbe carefull to make his furrowes lesse, and to lay them the closer\r\ntogether: & also in as much as this soile, through his naturall warmth\r\nand temperate moisture, is exceeding apt to bring forth much weede,\r\nespecially Brakes, Ling, Brambles, and such like, therefore the Plow-man\r\nshall be very carefull to plow all his furrowes very cleane, without\r\nbaukes or other impediments by which may be ingendred any of these\r\ninconueniences.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Spring-foyling.}\r\nAfter you haue thus broke vp and fallowed your fallow or tilth-field,\r\nthe limitation of which time is from the middest of Ianuary vntill the\r\nmiddest of February, you shall then at the middest of February, when the\r\nclay-men begin to sow their Beanes and Pease, goe with your plough into\r\nyour other fallow-field, which all the yeere before hath laine fallow\r\nand already receiued at your hands at least foure seuerall Ardors; as\r\nFallowing, Summer-stirring, Foyling, and Winter-rigging; and there you\r\nshall plow all that field ouer the fift time, which is called the\r\nSpring-foyling: and in this Ardor you shall plow all your lands vpward,\r\nin such sort as when you Winter-ridge it, by which meanes you shall plow\r\nvp all those weedes which haue sprung forth in the Winter season. For\r\nyou must vnderstand that in these light, hot, sandy soiles, there is a\r\ncontinuall spring (though not of good fruits) yet of weeds, quicks, and\r\nother inconueniences: for it is a rule amongst Husbandmen, that warme\r\nsoiles are neuer idle, that is, they are euer bringing forth something.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Sowing March-Rye.}\r\nNow the limitation for this Ardor is from the middest of Februarie\r\nvntill the middest of March, at which time you shall, by comparing\r\nformer experience with your present iudgement, take into your\r\nconsideration the state, goodnesse, and powerfulnesse of your land, I\r\nmeane especially of this fallow-field, which hath laine fallow the yeere\r\nbefore, and hath now receiued fiue Ardors: and if you finde any part of\r\nit, either for want of good ordoring in former times, or for want of\r\nmanure in the present yeere, to be growne so leane and out of hart, that\r\nyou feare it hath not strength enough to beare Barley, you shall then at\r\nthis time, being the middest of March, sow such land with Rye, which of\r\nHusbandmen is called the sowing of March-Rye: and this Rye is to be\r\nsowne and harrowed in such sort as you did sow it vpon the clay soiles,\r\nthat is to say, aboue furrow, and not vnder furrow, except the land be\r\nvery full of quickes, that is, of Brakes, Ling, Brambles, Dockes, or\r\nsuch like, and then you shall first with a paire of Iron harrowes, that\r\nis, with harrowes that haue Iron teeth, first of all harrow the land\r\nouer, and by that meanes teare vp by the rootes all those quickes, and\r\nso bring them from the land: which done, you shall sow the land ouer\r\nwith Rye, and then plow it downeward which is vnder furrow: & as soone\r\nas it is plowed, you shall then with a paire of Iron Harrowes harrow it\r\nall ouer so exceedingly, that the mould may be made as fine, and the\r\nland lie as smooth as is possible.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the harrow.}\r\nNow because I haue in the former Chapters spoke of Harrowes and\r\nharrowing, yet haue not deliuered vnto you the shape and proportion\r\nthereof, and because both the woodden harrow and the Iron harrow haue\r\nall one shape, and differ in nothing but the teeth onely, I thinke it\r\nnot amisse before I proceede any further to shew you in this Figure the\r\ntrue shape of a right Harrow.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The Harrow.}\r\n\r\nThe parts of this Harrow consisteth of buls, staues, and teeth: of buls,\r\nwhich are broad thicke pieces eyther of well seasoned Willow, or Sallow,\r\nbeing at least three inches euery way square, into which are fastned the\r\nteeth: of staues, which are round pieces of well seasoned Ash, being\r\nabout two inches and a halfe about, which going thorow the buls, holde\r\nthe buls firmely in equall distance one from the other: and of teeth,\r\nwhich are either long pinnes of wood or Iron, being at least fiue\r\ninches in length, which are made fast, and set slope-wise through the\r\nbuls.\r\n\r\n{SN: The diuersitie of Harrowes.}\r\nNow you shall vnderstand that Harrowes are of two kindes, that is,\r\nsingle and double: the single Harrow is called of Husbandmen the\r\nHorse-harrow, and is not aboue foure foote square: the double Harrow is\r\ncalled the Oxe-harrow, and it must be at least seauen foote square, and\r\nthe teeth must euer be of Iron. Now whereas I spake of the Horse-harrow\r\nand the Oxe-harrow, it is to be vnderstood that the single Harrow doth\r\nbelong to the Horse, because Horses drawing single, doe draw each a\r\nseuerall Harrow by himselfe, albeit in the common vse of harrowing, we\r\ncouple two horses euer together, and so make them draw two single\r\nHarrowes: but Oxen not being in good Husbandry to be separated, because\r\neuer two must draw in one yoake, therefore was the double Harrow\r\ndeuised, containing in substance and worke as much as two single\r\nHarrowes.\r\n\r\n{SN: The vse of Harrowes.}\r\nNow for the vse of Harrowes. The woodden Harrow which is the Harrow with\r\nwoodden teeth, is euer to be vsed vpon clay grounds and light grounds,\r\nwhich through drynesse doth grow loose, and fals to mould of it owne\r\nnature, as most commonly Sand grounds doe also: and the Iron Harrow\r\nwhich is the Harrow with Iron teeth, is euer to be vsed vpon binding\r\ngrounds, such as through drynesse grow so hard that they will not be\r\nsundered, and through wet turne soone to mire and loose durt. Now\r\nwhereas there be mingled earths, which neither willingly yeeld to mould,\r\nnor yet bindes so sore, but small industry breaks it, of which earth I\r\nshall speake hereafter, to such grounds the best Husbands vse a mixture,\r\nthat is to say, one woodden Harrow, and one Iron Harrow, that the\r\nwoodden Harrow turning ouer and loosening the loosest mould, the Iron\r\nHarrow comming after, may breake the stiffer clots, and so consequently\r\nturne all the earth to a fine mould. And thus much for Harrowes.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the sowing of Pulse.}\r\n{SN: Of Pease, Lentles, and Lupines.}\r\nNow to returne to my former purpose touching the tillage of this red\r\nSand: if (as before I said) you finde any part of your fallow-field too\r\nweake to beare Barley, then is your March-Rye, a graine which will take\r\nvpon a harder earth: but if the ground be too weake either for Barley or\r\nRye, (for both those Seedes desire some fatnesse of ground) then shall\r\nyou spare plowing it at all vntill this time of the yeere, which is\r\nmid-March, and then you shall plow it, and sow it with either the\r\nsmallest Pease you can get, or else with our true English Fitches, which\r\nby forraine Authors are called _Lentles_, that is, white Fitches, or\r\n_Lupines_, which are red Fitches: for all these three sorts of Pulse\r\nwill grow vpon very barraine soiles, and in their growth doe manure and\r\nmake rich the ground: yet your Pease desire some hart of ground, your\r\n_Lentles_, or white Fitches, lesse, and your _Lupines_, or red Fitches,\r\nthe least of all, as being apt to grow vpon the barrainest soile: so\r\nlikewise your Pease doe manure barraine ground well, your _Lentles_\r\nbetter and your _Lupines_ the best of all.\r\n\r\nNow for the nature and vse of these graines, the Pease as all Husbandmen\r\nknow, are both good for the vse of man in his bread, as are vsed in\r\nLeicester-shire, Lincolne-shire, Nottingham-shire, and many other\r\nCountries: and also for Horses in their Prouender, as is vsed generally\r\nouer all England: for _Lentles_, or white Fitches, or the _Lupines_\r\nwhich are redde Fitches, they are both indifferent good in bread for\r\nman, especially if the meale be well scalded before it be knodden (for\r\notherwise the sauour is exceeding rancke) or else they are a very good\r\nfoode being sodden in the manner of Leaps-Pease, especially at Sea, in\r\nlong iourneyes where fresh meate is most exceeding scarce: so that\r\nrather then your land should lye idle, and bring forth no profit, I\r\nconclude it best to sow these Pulses, which both bring forth commoditie,\r\nand also out of their owne natures doe manure and inrich your ground,\r\nmaking it more apt and fit to receiue much better Seede.\r\n\r\nFor the manner of sowing these three sorts of Pulse: you shall sow them\r\neuer vnder furrow, in such sort as is described for the sowing of Pease\r\nand Beanes vpon the white or gray clay which is of indifferent drinesse\r\nand apt to breake.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Manuring.}\r\nNow the limitation for this Ardor or seede time, is from the middest of\r\nMarch, till the middest of Aprill: then from the middest of Aprill, till\r\nthe middest of May, you shall make your especiall worke, to be onely the\r\nleading forth of your Manure to that field which you did fallow, or lay\r\ntilth that present yeere immediatelie after Christmas, and of which I\r\nfirst spake in this Chapter. And herein is to be vnderstood, that the\r\nbest and principallest Manure for this redde-sand, is the ouldest Manure\r\nof beasts which can be-gotten, which you shall know by the exceeding\r\nblacknesse and rottennesse thereof, being in the cutting both soft and\r\nsmooth, all of one substance, as if it were well compact morter, without\r\nany shew of straw or other stuffe which is vnrotted, for this dung is of\r\nall the fattest and coolest, and doth best agree with the nature of this\r\nhot sand. Next to the dung of beasts, is the dung of Horses if it be old\r\nalso, otherwise it is somewhat of the hottest, the rubbish of old\r\nhouses, or the sweepings of flowres, or the scowrings of old Fish-ponds,\r\nor other standing waters where beasts and horses are vsed to drinke, or\r\nbe washt, or wherevnto the water and moisture of dunghills haue recourse\r\nare all good Manures for this redde-sand: as for the Manure of Sheepe\r\nvpon this redde-sand, it is the best of all in such places as you meane\r\nto sow Rie, but not fully so good where you doe intend to sow your\r\nBarley: if it be a cold moist redde-sand (which is seldome found but in\r\nsome particular low countries) then it doth not amisse to Manure it most\r\nwith Sheepe, or else with Chaulke, Lime, or Ashes, of which you can get\r\nthe greatest plentie: if this soile be subiect to much weede and\r\nquickes, as generally it is, then after you haue torne vp the weedes and\r\nquickes with Harrowes, you shall with rakes, rake them together, and\r\nlaying them in heapes vpon the land, you shall burne them and then\r\nspreading the ashes they will be a very good Manure, and in short space\r\ndestroy the weedes also; likewise if your land be much ouergrowne with\r\nweedes, if when you sheare your Rie you leaue a good long stubble, and\r\nthen mowing the stubble burne it vpon the land, it is both a good Manure\r\nand also a good meanes to destroy the weedes.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of sowing Barley.}\r\nAfter your Manure is lead forth and either spread vpon the lands, or set\r\nin great heapes, so as the land may be couered ouer with Manure (for it\r\nis to be obserued that this soile must be throughly Manured) then about\r\nthe middest of May, which is the time when this worke should be\r\nfinished, you shall repaire with your Plough into the other fallow\r\nfield, which was prepared the yeere before for this yeeres Barley, &\r\nthere you shall sow it all ouer with Barley aboue furrow, that is to\r\nsay, you shall first Plough it, then sow it, and after Harrow it, making\r\nthe mould as fine and smooth as may be, which is done with easie labour,\r\nbecause this sand of it owne nature is as fine as ashes.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Summer-stirring.}\r\n{SN: Of sleighting.}\r\nNow the limitation for this seede time, is from the middest of May, till\r\nthe middest of Iune, wherein if any man demand why it should not be\r\nsowne in March and Aprill, according as it is sowne in the former\r\nsoiles, I answere, that first this redde-sand cannot be prepared, or\r\nreceiue his full season in weather, and earings, before this time of the\r\nyeere, and next that these redde-sands, by how much they are hotter and\r\ndrier then the other claies, by so much they may wel stay the longer\r\nbefore they receiue their seede, because that so much the sooner the\r\nseede doth sprout in them, & also the sooner ripen being kept warmer at\r\nthe roote then in any could soile whatsoeuer. As soone as the middest of\r\nIune approacheth, you shall then beginne to Summer-stirre your fallow\r\nfield, and to turne your Manure into your land, in such sort as you did\r\nvpon your clay soiles, for this Ardor of Summer-stirring altereth in no\r\nsoile, and this must be done from the middest of Iune, till the middest\r\nof Iuly, for as touching sleighting, clotting, or smoothing of this\r\nBarley field, it is seldome in vse, because the finenesse of the sand\r\nwill lay the land smooth inough without sleighting: yet if you finde\r\nthat any particular land lieth more rough then the rest, it shall not be\r\namisse, if with your backe Harrowes you smooth it a little within a day\r\nor two after it is sowne.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Foiling.}\r\n{SN: Of sowing Rye.}\r\nFrom the middest of Iuly vntill the middest of August, you shall foile\r\nand throw downe your fallow field againe, if your lands lie well and in\r\ngood order, but if any of your lands doe lie in the danger of water, or\r\nby vse of Plowing are growne too flat, both which are hinderances to the\r\ngrowth of Corne, then when you foile your lands you shall Plow them\r\nvpward, and so by that meanes raise the ridges one furrow higher. After\r\nyou haue foiled your land, which must be about the middest of August,\r\nthen will your Barley be ready to mowe, for these hot soiles haue euer\r\nan earely haruest, which as soone as it is mowne and carried into the\r\nBarne, forthwith you shall with all expedition carry forth such Manure\r\nas you may conueniently spare, and lay it vpon that land from whence you\r\nreceiued your Barley, which is most barraine: and if you want cart\r\nManure, you shall then lay your fould of Sheepe thereupon, and as soone\r\nas it is Manured, you shall immediately Plow both it & the rest, which\r\nArdor should be finished by the middest of September, and so suffered to\r\nrest vntill the beginning of October, at which time you shall beginne to\r\nsow all that field ouer with Rye in such sort as hath beene spoken of in\r\nformer places.\r\n\r\n{SN: Obiection.}\r\nNow in as much as the ignorant Husbandman may very easiely imagine that\r\nI reckon vp his labours too thicke, and therein leaue him no leasure for\r\nhis necessarie businesses, especially because I appoint him to foile his\r\nland from the middest of Iuly, till the middest of August, which is both\r\na busie time for his Hay haruest, and also for his Rye shearing.\r\n\r\n{SN: Answere.}\r\nTo this I make answere, that I write not according to that which poore\r\nmen are able (for it were infinit to looke into estates) but according\r\nas euery good Husband ought, presupposing that he which will liue by the\r\nPlough, ought to pursue all things belonging vnto the Plough, and then\r\nhe shall finde that there is no day in the yeere, but the Saboth, but it\r\nis necessarie that the Plough be going: yet to reconcile the poore and\r\nthe rich together, they shall vnterstand, that when I speake of Plowing\r\nin the time of Haruest, I doe not meane that they should neglect any\r\npart of that principall Worke, which is the true recompence of their\r\nlabour: but because whilst the dew is vpon the ground, or when there is\r\neither raine or mizling there is then no time for Haruest Worke, then my\r\nmeaning is that the carefull Husbandman shall take those aduantages, and\r\nrising earelier in the mornings, be sure to be at his Plough two howers\r\nbefore the dew be from the ground, knowing that the getting but of one\r\nhower in the day compasseth a great worke in a month, neither shall hee\r\nneede to feare the ouer toiling of his cattell, sith at that time of the\r\nyeere Grasse being at greatest plenty, strongest and fullest of hart,\r\nCorne scattered almost in euery corner, and the mouth of the beast not\r\nbeing muzeld in his labour, there is no question but he will indure and\r\nworke more then at any other season.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Winter ridging.}\r\nIn the beginning of Nouember, you shall beginne to Winter-ridge your\r\nfallow, or tilth-field, which in all points shalbe done according to the\r\nforme described in the former soiles: for that Ardor of all other neuer\r\naltereth, because it is as it were a defence against the latter spring,\r\nwhich else would fill the lands full of weedes, and also against the\r\nrigor of Winter, and therefore it doth lay vp the furrow close together,\r\nwhich taking the season of the frost, winde, and weather makes the mould\r\nripe, mellow, and light: and the limitation for this Ardor, is from the\r\nbeginning of Nouember, vntill the middest of December.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the Plough.}\r\n{SN: Of the coulture.}\r\nNow as touching the Plough which is best and most proper for this\r\nredde-sand, it differeth nothing in shape and composure of members from\r\nthat Plough which is described for the blacke Clay, hauing necessarily\r\ntwo hales, because the ground being loose and light, the Plough will\r\nwith great difficulty hold land, but with the least disorder be euer\r\nready to runne into the furrow, so that a right hand hale is most\r\nnecessarie for the houlding of the plough euen, onely the difference of\r\nthe two Ploughes consisteth in this, that the plough for this red-sand,\r\nmust be much lesse then the plough for the blacke Clay houlding in the\r\nsizes of the timber the due proportion of the plough for the white or\r\ngray clay, or if it be somewhat lesse it is not amisse, as the head\r\nbeing eighteene inches, the maine beame not aboue foure foote, and\r\nbetweene the hinder part of the rest, and the out-most part of the\r\nplough head in the hinder end not aboue eight inches. Now for the\r\nPlough-Irons which doe belong vnto this plough, the Coulture is to be\r\nmade circular, in such proportion as the coulture for the gray, or white\r\nclay, and in the placing, or tempering vpon the Plough it is to be set\r\nan inch at least lower then the share, that it may both make way before\r\nthe share, and also cut deeper into the land, to make the furrow haue\r\nmore easie turning.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the share.}\r\nNow for the share, it differeth in shape from both the former shares,\r\nfor it is neither so large nor out-winged, as that for the gray Clay,\r\nfor this share is onely made broad to the Plough ward, and small to the\r\npoint of the share, with onely a little peake and no wing according to\r\nthis figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The share.}\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the plough-slip.}\r\nThese Plough-irons, both coulture and share, must be well steeled and\r\nhardned at the points, because these sandy soiles being full of moisture\r\nand greete, will in short space weare and consume the Irons, to the\r\ngreat hinderance and cost of the Husbandman, if it be not preuented by\r\nsteele and hardning, which notwithstanding will waste also in these\r\nsoiles, so that you must at least twise in euery Ardor haue your Irons\r\nto the Smith, and cause him to repaire them both with Iron and steele,\r\nbesides these Irons, of coulture and share, you must also haue a long\r\npiece of Iron, which must be iust of the length of the Plough head, and\r\nas broad as the Plough head is thicke, and in thicknesse a quarter of an\r\ninch: and this piece of Iron must be nailed vpon the outside of the\r\nPlough head, next vnto the land, onely to saue the Plough head from\r\nwearing, for when the Plough is worne it can then no longer hould the\r\nland, and this piece of Iron is called of Husbandmen the Plough-slip and\r\npresenteth this figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The Plough-slip.}\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Plough clouts.}\r\nOuer and besides this Plough-slip, their are certaine other pieces of\r\nIron which are made in the fashion of broad thinne plates, and they be\r\ncalled Plough clouts, and are to be nailed vpon the shelboard, to defend\r\nit from the earth or furrow which it turneth ouer, which in very short\r\nspace would weare the woode and put the Husbandman to double charge.\r\n\r\n{SN: The houlding of the Plough.}\r\nThus hauing shewed you the parts, members, and implements, belonging to\r\nthis Plough, it rests that I proceede vnto the teame or draught: for to\r\nspeake of the vse and handling of this Plough, it is needelesse, because\r\nit is all one with those Ploughes, of which I haue spoken in the former\r\nChapters, and he which can hould and handle a Plough in stiffe clayes\r\nmust needes (except he be exceeding simple) hould a Plough in these\r\nlight sands, in as much as the worke is much more easie and the Plough a\r\ngreat deale lesse chargeable.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the draught.}\r\nNow for the Draught or Teame, they ought to be as in the former Soiles,\r\nOxen or Horses, yet the number not so great: for foure Beasts are\r\nsufficient to plow any Ardor vpon this soile, nay, three Horses if they\r\nbe of reasenable strength will doe as much as sixe vpon either of the\r\nClay-soiles: asfor their attire or Harnessing, the Beare-geares, before\r\ndescribed, are the best and most proper. And thus much concerning this\r\nred Sand, wherein you are to take this briefe obseruation with you, that\r\nthe Graines which are best to be sowne vpon it, are onely Rye, Barley,\r\nsmall Pease, _Lentles_ and _Lupines_, otherwise called Fitches, and the\r\ngraines to which it is aduerse, are Wheat, Beanes and Maslin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n_The manner of plowing the white Sand, his Earings, Plough, and\r\nImplements._\r\n\r\n\r\nNext vnto this red Sand, is the white sand, which is much more barraine\r\nthen the red Sand, yet by the industry of the Husbandman in plowing, and\r\nby the cost of Manure it is made to beare corne in reasonable plentie.\r\nNow of white Sands there be two kindes, the one a white Sand mixt with a\r\nkinde of Marle, as that in Norffolke, Suffolke, and other such like\r\nplaces butting vpon the Sea-coast: the other a white Sand with Pible, as\r\nin some parts of Surrey, about Ancaster in Lincolne shire, and about\r\nSalisbury in Wil-shire.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the white Sand with Pible.}\r\nNow for this white Sand with Pible, it is the barrainest, and least\r\nfruitfull in bringing forth, because it hath nothing but a hot dustie\r\nsubstance in it. For the manner of Earing thereof, it agreeth in all\r\npoints with the redde Sand, the Ardors being all one, the Tempers,\r\nManurings and all other appurtenances: the Seede also which it delights\r\nin is all one with the red Sand, as namely, Rye, Barley, Pease and\r\nFitches. Wherefore who so shall dwell vpon such a soile, I must referre\r\nhim to the former Chapter of the red Sand, and therein he shall finde\r\nsufficient instruction how to behaue himselfe vpon this earth:\r\nremembring that in as much as it is more barraine then the red Sand, by\r\nso much it craueth more care and cost, both in plowing and manuring\r\nthereof, which two labours onely make perfect the ill ground.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the white Sand with Marle.}\r\nNow for the white Sand which hath as it were a certaine mixture, or\r\nnature of Marle in it, you shall vnderstand that albeit vnto the eye it\r\nbe more dry and dustie then the red Sand, yet it is fully as rich as the\r\nred Sand: for albe it doe not beare Barley in as great plenty as the red\r\nSand, yet it beareth Wheate abundantly, which the red Sand seldome or\r\nvery hardly bringeth forth.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Fallowing.}\r\nWherefore to proceede to the Earings or tillage of this white Marly\r\nsand, you shall vnderstand that about the middest of Ianuary is fit time\r\nto beginne to fallow your field which shall be tilth and rest for this\r\nyeere: wherein by the way, before I proceede further, you shall take\r\nthis obseruation with you, that whereas in the former soiles I diuided\r\nthe fields into three & foure parts, this soile cannot conueniently, if\r\nit be well husbanded, be diuided into any more parts then two, that is\r\nto say, a fallow field, and a Wheat-field: in which Wheate-field if you\r\nhaue any land richer then other, you may bestow Barley vpon it, vpon the\r\nsecond you may bestow Wheat, vpon the third sort of ground Rye, and vpon\r\nthe barrainest, Pease or Fitches: and yet all these must be sowne within\r\none field, because in this white sand, Wheate and Rye will not grow\r\nafter Barley or Pease, nor Barley and Pease after Wheate or Rye. Your\r\nfields being then diuided into two parts, that is, one for corne, the\r\nother for rest, you shall as before I said, about the middest of Ianuary\r\nbeginne to fallow your Tith-field, which in all obseruations you shall\r\ndoe according as is mentioned for the red sand.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of sowing Pease.}\r\nAbout the middest of March, if you haue any barraine or wasted ground\r\nwithin your fallow field, or if you haue any occasion to breake vp any\r\nnew ground, which hath not beene formerly broake vp, in eyther of these\r\ncases you shall sow Pease or Fitches thereupon, and those Pease or\r\nFitches you shall sow vnder furrow as hath beene before described.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Spring-fallowing.}\r\nAbout the middest of Aprill you shall plow your fallow-field ouer\r\nagaine, in such manner as you plowed when you fallowed it first: and\r\nthis is called Spring-fallowing, and is of great benefit because at that\r\ntime the weedes and quickes beginning to spring, nay, to flowrish, by\r\nreason that the heate of the climbe puts them forth sooner then in other\r\nsoyles, if they should not be plowed vp before they take too strong\r\nroote, they would not onely ouer-runne, but also eate out the hart of\r\nthe Land.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of sowing Barley.}\r\nAbout the middest of May you shall beginne to sow your Barley vpon the\r\nrichest part of your old fallow-field, which at the Michaelmas before,\r\nwhen you did sow your Wheate, and Rye, and Maslin, you did reserue for\r\nthat purpose: and this Barley you shall sow in such sort as is mentioned\r\nin the former Chapter of the red Sand, in so much that this Ardor being\r\nfinished, which is the last part of your Seede-time, your whole field\r\nshall be furnished eyther with Wheate, if it hold a temperate fatnesse,\r\nor with Wheate and Barley, if it be rich and richer, or with Wheate,\r\nBarley and Pulse, if it be rich, poore or extreame barraine: and the\r\nmanner of sowing all these seuerall seedes is described in the Chapters\r\ngoing before.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Summer-stirring.}\r\nAbout the middest of Iune you shall beginne to Summer-stirre your\r\nfallow-field, in such sort as was spoken of in the former Chapters\r\nconcerning the other soiles: for in this Ardor there is no alteration of\r\nmethode, but onely in gouernment of the Plough, considering the\r\nheauinesse and lightnesse of the earth. During this Ardor you shall\r\nbusily apply your labour in leading forth your Manure, for it may at\r\ngreat ease be done both at one season, neyther the Plough hindering the\r\nCart, nor the Cart staying the Plough: for this soile being more light\r\nand easie in worke then any other soile whatsoeuer, doth euer preserue\r\nso many Cattell for other imployment that both workes may goe forward\r\ntogether, as shall be shewed when wee come to speake of the Plough, and\r\nthe Teame which drawes it.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Manuring.}\r\nNow as touching the Manures most fit for this soyle, they be all those\r\nof which we haue formerly written, ashes onely excepted, which being of\r\nan hot nature doe scald the Seede, and detaine it from all\r\nfruitfulnesse, being mixt with this hot soile, so is likewise Lyme, and\r\nthe burning of stubble: other Manures are both good and occasion much\r\nfertilitie, as being of a binding and coole nature, and holding together\r\nthat loosenesse which in his too much separation taketh all nutriment\r\nfrom the earth.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Weeding.}\r\nAfter you haue ledde forth your Manure, and Summer-stird your Land, you\r\nshall then about the beginning of Iulie looke into your Corne-field, and\r\nif you perceiue any Thistles, or any other superfluous weedes to annoy\r\nyour Corne, you shall then (as is before said) either cut, or plucke\r\nthem vp by the rootes.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Foyling.}\r\nAbout the middest of August you shall beginne to foile or cast downe\r\nyour fallow-field againe, and in that Ardor you shall be very carefull\r\nto plow cleane and leaue no weedes vncut vp: for in these hot soiles if\r\nany weedes be left with the least roote, so that they may knit and bring\r\nforth seede, the annoyance thereof will remaine for at least foure\r\nyeeres after, which is a double fallowing. And to the end that you may\r\ncut vp all such weedes cleane, although both your Share and Coulture\r\nmisse them, you shall haue the rest of your Plough in the vnder part\r\nwhich strokes alongst the earth filled all full of dragges of Iron, that\r\nis, of olde crooked nailes or great tenter-hookes, such as vpon the\r\nputting downe of your right hand when you come neere a weed shall catch\r\nhold thereof and teare it vp by the rootes, as at this day is vsed be\r\nmany particular Husbands in this kingdome, whose cares, skils, and\r\nindustries are not inferiour to the best whatsoeuer.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Sowing Wheate and Rye.}\r\n{SN: The choise of Seede.}\r\nAbout the middest of September, you shall beginne to sow your Wheate and\r\nRye vpon your fallow field, which Graine vpon this soile is to be\r\nreckoned the most principall: and you shall sow it in the same manner\r\nthat is described in the former Chapters, wherein your especiallest care\r\nis the choise of your seede: for in this soile your whole-straw Wheate,\r\nnor your great Pollard taketh any delight, neither your Organe, for all\r\nthose three must haue a firme and a strong mould: but your\r\nChilter-wheate, your Flaxen-wheate, your White-pollard, and your\r\nRed-wheate, which are the Wheates which yeeld the purest and finest\r\nmeale, (although they grow not in so great abundance) are the seedes\r\nwhich are most proper and naturall for this soile. As for Rye or Maslin,\r\naccording to the goodnesse of the ground so you shall bestow your seede:\r\nfor it is a generall rule, that wheresoeuer your Wheate growes, there\r\nwill euer Rye grow, but Rye will many times grow where Wheate will not\r\nprosper; and therefore for the sowing of your Rye, it must be according\r\nto the temper of the earth, and the necessitie of your houshold: for\r\nWheate being a richer graine then Rye, if you be assured that your\r\nground will beare Wheate well, it is small Husbandrie to sow more Rye or\r\nMaslin then for your house: but if it be too hot for Wheate, and kindly\r\nfor Rye, then it is better to haue good Rye, then ill Wheate. Now for\r\nthe sowing of your Rye or Maslin in this soile, it differeth nothing\r\nfrom the former soiles, either in plowing or any other obseruation, that\r\nis to say, it must be plowed aboue furrow: for Rye being the most tender\r\ngraine, it can neither abide the waight of earth, nor yet moisture; the\r\none, as it were, burying, and the other drowning the vigour and strength\r\nof the seede.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Winter-ridging.}\r\nAbout the beginning of Nouember you shall Winter-ridge your fallow\r\nfield, I meane that part which you doe preserue for Barley (for the\r\nother part is furnished with seede) and this Winter-ridging differeth\r\nnothing from the Winter ridging of other soiles, onely you shall a\r\nlittle more precisely obserue to set vp your lands more straight and\r\nhigh then in other soiles, both to defend them from wet, which this\r\nsoile is much subiect vnto, because commonly some great riuer is neare\r\nit, and also for the preseruing of the strength and goodnesse of the\r\nManure within the land which by lying open and vnclosed would soone be\r\nwasht forth and consumed.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the clensing of lands, or drawing of water-furrowes.}\r\nNow sith I haue here occasion to speake something of the draining of\r\nlands, and the keeping of them from the annoyance of superfluous wet,\r\nwhether it be by invndation or otherwise, you shall vnderstand that it\r\nis the especiall office and dutie of euery good Husbandman, not onely in\r\nthis soile, but in all other whatsoeuer, to haue a principall respect to\r\nthe keeping of his land dry, and to that end hee shall diligently (as\r\nsoone as he hath Winter-rigged his land) take a carefull view how his\r\nlands lie, which way the descent goes from whence annoyance or water may\r\npossibly come, and so consequently from those obseruations, with a Spade\r\nor strong Plough, of extraordinary greatnesse, draw certaine deepe\r\nfurrowes from descent vnto descent, by which meanes all the water may be\r\nconuayed from his lands, eyther into some common Sewer, Lake, Brooke, or\r\nother maine Riuer: and to this end it is both a rule in the common Lawes\r\nof our Land, and a laudable custome in the Common-wealth of euery Towne,\r\nthat for as much as many Townes haue their lands lie in common, that is\r\nto say, mixed neighbour with neighbour, few or none hauing aboue two or\r\nthree lands at the most lying together in one place, therefore euery man\r\nshall ioyne, and make their water-furrowes one from another, vntill such\r\ntime as the water be conuayed into some common issue, as well hee whose\r\nlands be without all danger, as he that is troubled with the greatest\r\nannoyance, and herein euery one shall beare his particular charge: which\r\nis an Act of great vertue and goodnesse.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the Plough.}\r\nNow for the Plough which is to plow this white sand it doth differ\r\nnothing in size, proportion, and vse of handling from the Plough\r\ndescribed for the red Sand, onely it hath one addition more, that is to\r\nsay, at the further end of the maine Beame of the Plough, where you\r\nfixe your Plough-foote, there you shall place a little paire of round\r\nwheeles, which bearing the Beame vpon a loose mouing Axletree, being\r\niust the length of two furrows and no more, doth so certainly guide the\r\nPlough in his true furrow that it can neither lose the land by swaruing\r\n(as in these light soiles euery Plough is apt to doe) nor take too much\r\nland, eyther by the greedinesse of the plough or sharpnesse of the\r\nIrons, neither can it drownd through the easie lightnesse of the earth,\r\nnor runne too shallow through the fussinesse of the mould, but the\r\nwheeles being made of a true proportion, which should not be aboue\r\ntwelue inches from the centre, the Plough with a reasonable hand of\r\ngouernment shall runne in a direct and euen furrow: the proportion of\r\nwhich Plough is contained in this Figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The Plough with Wheeles.}\r\n\r\nThis plough of all others I hold to be most ancient, and as being the\r\nmodell of the first inuention, and at this day is preserued both in\r\nFrance, Germany, & Italy, and no other proportion of Ploughes knowne,\r\nboth as we perceiue by our experience in seeing them plow, & also by\r\nreading of their writings: for neither in _Virgil_, _Columella_,\r\n_Xenophon_, nor any olde Writer: nor in _Heresbachius_, _Steuens_, nor\r\n_Libault_, being later Writers, finde wee any other Plough bequeathed\r\nvnto our memories. Yet it is most certaine, that in many of our English\r\nsoiles, this Plough is of little profit, as we finde by daily experience\r\nboth in our clayes, and many of our mixt earths: for in truth this\r\nPlough is but onely for light, sandy, or grauelly soiles, as for the\r\nmost part these forraine Countries are, especially about the sea-coast,\r\nor the borders of great Cities, from whence these Writers most generally\r\ntooke the presidents for their writings.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the plough-Irons.}\r\nNow for the parts of this Plough, it consisteth of the same members\r\nwhich the former Ploughs doe, onely that in stead of the Plough-foote it\r\nhath a paire of wheeles. It hath also but one Hale, in such sort as the\r\nPlough for the gray or white clay. The beame also of this Plough is much\r\nmore straight then the former, by which meanes the Skeath is not full so\r\nlong. The Irons belonging vnto this Plough are of the fashion of the\r\nformer Irons, onely they be somewhat lesse, that is to say, the Coulture\r\nis not so long, neyther so full bent as that for the red Sand, nor so\r\nstraight as that for the blacke clay, but as it were holding a meane\r\nbetweene both: so likewise the Share is not fully so broad as that for\r\nthe red sand, nor so narrow as that for the gray clay, but holds as it\r\nwere a middle size betweene both, somewhat leaning in proportion to the\r\nshape of that for the blacke clay. As for the Plough-slip,\r\nPlough-clouts, and other implements which are to defend the wood from\r\nthe hardnesse of the earth, they are the same, and in the same wise to\r\nbe vsed as those for the red Sand.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the draught.}\r\nNow for the Draught or Teame which drawes this Plough, they are as in\r\nall other Draughts, Oxen or Horses, but for the number thereof they\r\ndiffer much from those which are formerly written of: for you shall\r\nvnderstand that in this white sandy soile, which is of all soiles the\r\nlightest, eyther two good Horses, or two good Oxen are a number\r\nsufficient to plow any Ardor vpon this soile whatsoeuer, as by daily\r\nexperience we may see in those countries whose soile consists of this\r\nwhite light Sand, of which wee haue now written: neyther shall the\r\nPlow-man vpon this soile neede any person to driue or order his Plough\r\nmore then himselfe: for the soile being so light and easie to cut, the\r\nPlough so nimble, and the Cattell so few and so neare him, hauing euer\r\nhis right hand at libertie (because his plough hath but onely a left\r\nhand Hale) he hath liberty euer to carry a goade or whip in his right\r\nhand, to quicken and set forward his Cattell, and also a line which\r\nbeing fastned to the heads of the Beasts, hee may with it euer when hee\r\ncomes to the lands end, stop them and turne them vpon which hand he\r\npleases. And thus much for the tillage and ordering of this white Sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\n_The manner of plowing the Grauell with Pible stones, or the Grauell with\r\nFlint, their Earings, Plough, and implements._\r\n\r\n\r\nHauing in the plainest manner I can written sufficiently already of the\r\nfoure simple and vncompounded soiles, to wit, two Clayes, blacke and\r\ngray, and two Sands, red and white, it now rests that I also giue you\r\nsome perfect touch or taste of the mixt or compounded soiles, as namely,\r\nthe grauell which is a kinde of hard sand, clay and stone mixt together:\r\nand of Grauels there be two kindes, that is to say, one that is mixt\r\nwith little small Pible stones, as in many parts of Middlesex, Kent, and\r\nSurry: and the Grauell mixt with broad Flints, as in many parts of\r\nHartford-shire, Essex, and sundry such places. These Grauels are both,\r\nin generall, subiect to much barrainnesse, especially if they be\r\naccompanied with any extraordinary moisture, yet with the good labour of\r\nplowing, and with the cost of much Manure, they are brought to\r\nreasonable fruitfulnesse, where it comes to passe that the Plow-man\r\nwhich is master of such a soile, if either he liue not neare some Citie\r\nor Market-towne, where great store of Manure, by the concourse of\r\npeople, is daily bred, and so consequently is very cheape, or else haue\r\nnot in his owne store and breede, meanes to raise good store of Manure,\r\nhee shall seldome thriue and prosper thereupon. Now although in these\r\ngrauell soiles there is a diuersity of mixture, as the one mingled with\r\nsmall Pibles, which indeede is the worst mixture, the other with broad\r\nFlints, which is the better signe of fruitfulnesse: yet in their order\r\nof tillage or Earings, in their weeding and cleansing, and in all other\r\nardors and obseruations, they differ nothing at all, the beginning and\r\nending of each seuerall worke being all one.\r\n\r\nNow for the manner of worke belonging vnto these two soiles, it altereth\r\nin no respect nor obseruation eyther in Plough, plowing, manuring,\r\nweeding, or any other thing whatsoeuer, from that of the white sand, the\r\nsame times of the yeere, the same Seedes, and the same Earings being\r\neuer to be obserued, wherefore it shall be needlesse to write so amply\r\nof these soiles as of the former, because being all one with the white\r\nSand, without alteration, it were but to write one thing twice, and\r\ntherefore I referre the Reader to the former Chapter, and also the\r\nHusbandman that shall liue vpon either of these soiles, onely with these\r\nfew caueats: First, that for the laying his lands, hee shall lay them in\r\nlittle small stitches, that is, not hauing aboue foure furrowes laid\r\ntogether, as it were for one land, in such sort as you see in\r\nHartford-shire, Essex, Middlesex, Kent and Surry: for this soile being\r\nfor the most part subiect to much moisture and hardnesse, if it should\r\nbe laid in great lands, according to the manner of the North parts, it\r\nwould ouer-burden, choake and confound the seed which is throwne into\r\nit. Secondly, you shall not goe about to gather off the stones which\r\nseeme as it were to couer the lands, both because the labour is infinite\r\nand impossible, as also because those stones are of good vse, and as it\r\nwere a certaine Manuring and helpe vnto the ground: for the nature of\r\nthis Grauell being colde and moist, these stones doe in the winter time,\r\ndefend and keepe the sharpnesse of the Frosts and bleake windes from\r\nkilling the heart or roote of the seedes, and also in the Summer it\r\ndefends the scorching heate of the Sunne from parching and drying vp the\r\nSeede, which in this grauelly soile doth not lie so well couered, as in\r\nother soyles, especially if this kinde of earth be inuironed with any\r\ngreat hils (as most commonly it is) the reflection whereof makes the\r\nheate much more violent. And lastly, to obserue that there is no manure\r\nbetter or more kindly for this kinde of earth then Chaulke, white Marle,\r\nor Lyme: for all other matters whatsoeuer the former Chapter of the\r\nwhite Sand, will giue you sufficient instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\n_The manner of plowing the blacke Clay mixt with red Sand, and the white\r\nClay mixt with white Sand, their Earings, Plough and Implements._\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to these grauelly soiles, there be also two other compounded\r\nearths, as namely, the blacke Clay mixt with red Sand, and the white\r\nClay mixt with white sand, which albe they differ in composition of\r\nmould, yet they hold one nature in their Tillage and Husbandry:\r\nwherefore first to speake of the blacke Clay mixt with red Sand, which\r\n(as before I said) is called of Husbandmen an hassell earth, you shall\r\nvnderstand that it is a very rich and good soile, very fruitfull both\r\nfor Corne and Grasse: for Corne, being apt to beare any seede\r\nwhatsoeuer: and for Grasse, as naturally putting it forth very earely in\r\nthe yeere, by which your Cattell shall get reliefe sooner then in other\r\nsoiles of colder nature: for both the blacke and white claies doe\r\nseldome flowrish with any store of Grasse before Iune, which is the\r\ntime of wood-seare, and this soile will boast of some plenty about the\r\nbeginning of Aprill at the furthest: but for Grasse we shall speake in\r\nhis proper place.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of fallowing.}\r\nNow for his tillage it is thus: you shall about the middest of Ianuary,\r\nbeginne to fallow that field which you intend that yeere shall lye at\r\nrest or tilth, and you shall fallow it in such sort as is specified in\r\nthe Chapter of the blacke clay: onely you shall raise small furrowes and\r\nPlow the land cleane, being sure to open and cast the land downeward if\r\nthe land lie high and round, otherwise you shall neuer at any time cast\r\nthe land downe but ridge it vp, that is to say, when you fallow it, you\r\nshall cast the first furrow downeward, and so likewise the second, which\r\ntwo furrowes being cleane ploughed, will lay the land open inough, that\r\nis, there wilbe no part of the ridge vnploughed: which done, by changing\r\nyour hand and the gate of your Plough, you shall plough those furrowes\r\nbacke againe and lay them vpward, and so plough the whole land vpward,\r\nalso laying it round and high: the reason for this manner of plowing\r\nbeing this, that for as much as this land being mixt of clay and sand,\r\nmust needes be a sore binding land, therefore if it should be laid flat,\r\nif any great raine or wet should fall, and a present drought follow it,\r\nneither should you possibly force your Plough to enter into it and\r\nbreake it, or being broken should you get so much mould as to couer your\r\nCorne and giue the seede comfort, whereas vpon the contrary part, if it\r\nbe laid high and vpright, it must necessarily be laid hollow and light,\r\nin so much that you may both Plough it at your pleasure, and also beget\r\nso perfect a mould as any other soile whatsoeuer, both because the wet\r\nhath liberty to auoide through the hollownesse, and also because the\r\nSunne and weather hath power to enter and season it, wherefore in\r\nconclusion you shall fallow this field downeward if it lye high and\r\nvpright, otherwise you shall fallow it vpward as the meanes to bring it\r\nto the best Ardor.\r\n\r\nNow for this fallow field it must euer be made where the yeere before\r\nyou did reape your Pease, in case you haue but three fields, or where\r\nyou did reape your Wheate, Rye, and Maslin, in case you haue foure\r\nfields, according to the manner of the blacke clay.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of sowing Pease.}\r\nAbout the middest of February, which is within a day or two of Saint\r\n_Valentines_ day, if the season be any thing constant in fairenesse and\r\ndrinesse, you shall then beginne to sow your Pease, for you must\r\nvnderstand that albeit this soile will beare Beanes, yet they are\r\nnothing so naturall for it as Pease, both because they are an hungry\r\nseede and doe much impaire and wast the ground, and also because they\r\nprosper best in a fat, loose, and tough earth, which is contrary to this\r\nhard and drie soile: but especially if you haue foure fields, you shall\r\nforbeare to sow any Beanes at all, least you loose two commodities, that\r\nis, both quantitie of graine (because Beanes are not so long and\r\nfruitfull vpon this earth, as vpon the clayes) and the Manuring of your\r\nground, which Pease out of their owne natures doe, both by the\r\nsmoothering of the ground and their owne fatnesse, when your Beanes doe\r\npill and sucke the hart out of the earth.\r\n\r\nNow for the manner of sowing your Pease, you shall sow them aboue\r\nfurrow, that is, first plough the land vpward, then immediately sow your\r\nPease, and instantly after Harrow them, the Plough, the Seedes-man, and\r\nthe Harrower, by due course, following each other, and so likewise you\r\nmay sow Oates vpon this soile.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of sowing Barley.}\r\nAbout the middest of March, which is almost a fortnight before our Lady\r\nday, you shall beginne to sow your Barley, which Barley you shall sow\r\nneither vnder-furrow nor aboue, but after this order: first, you shall\r\nplow your land downeward, beginning at the furrow and so assending\r\nvpward to the ridge of the land, which as soone as you haue opened, you\r\nshall then by pulling the plough out of the earth, and laying the\r\nshelboard crosse the ridge, you shall fill the ridge in againe with the\r\nsame mould which you plowed vp: this done, your seedes-man shall bring\r\nhis Barley and sow the land aboue furrow: after the land is sowne, you\r\nshall then Harrow it as small as may be, first with a paire of woodden\r\nHarrowes, and after with a paire of Iron Harrowes, or else with a double\r\nOxe Harrow, for this earth being somewhat hard and much binding, will\r\naske great care and dilligence in breaking.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of sleighting.}\r\nAfter your Barley is sowne, you shall about the latter end of Aprill\r\nbeginne to smooth and sleight your land, both with the backe Harrowes\r\nand with the rouler, and looke what clots they faile to breake, you\r\nshall with clotting beetles beate them asunder, making your mould as\r\nfine and laying your land as smooth as is possible.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Summer-stirring.}\r\nAbout the middest of May, you shall, if any wet fall, beginne to\r\nSummer-stirre your land, or if no wet fall, you shall doe your indeauour\r\nto Summer-stirre your land, rather aduenturing to breake two ploughes,\r\nthen to loose one day in that labour, knowing this, that one land\r\nSummer-stird in a dry season, is better then three Summer-stird in a wet\r\nor moist weather, both because it giues the earth a better temper, and\r\nkils the weedes with more assurednesse, and as I speake of\r\nSummer-stirring, so I speake of all other Ardors, that the drier they\r\nare done the better they are euer done: and in this season you shall\r\nalso gather the stones from your ground.\r\n\r\n{SN: Obiection.}\r\nNow it may be obiected, that if it be best to plough in drie seasons, it\r\nis then best to fallow also in a dry season, and by that meanes not to\r\nbeginne to fallow vntill the beginning of May, as is prescribed for the\r\nblacke clay, and so to deferre the Summer-stirring till the next month\r\nafter, sith of necessitie Ianuary must either be wet or else vnkindely.\r\n\r\n{SN: Answere.}\r\nTo this I make answere, that most true it is, that the land which is\r\nlast fallowed is euer the best and most fruitfull, yet this mixt earth\r\nwhich is compound of sand and clay, is such a binding earth, that if it\r\nbe not taken and fallowed in a moist-time of the yeere, as namely, in\r\nIanuary or February, but suffered to lye till May, at which time the\r\ndrought hath so entered into him, that the greatest part of his moisture\r\nis decaied, then I say, the nature of the ground is such and so hard,\r\nthat it wilbe impossible to make any plough enter into it, so that you\r\nshall not onely aduenture the losse of that speciall Ardor, but also of\r\nall the rest which should follow after, and so consequently loose the\r\nprofit of your land: where contrary wise if you fallow it at the\r\nbeginning of the yeere, as in Ianuary, and February, albe they be wet,\r\nyet shall you lay vp your furrowes and make the earth more loose, by\r\nwhich meanes you shall compasse all the other Earings which belong to\r\nyour soile: for to speake briefely, late fallowing belongs vnto claies,\r\nwhich by drought are made loose and light, and earely fallowings vnto\r\nmixt soiles, such as these which by drinesse doe ingender and binde\r\nclose together.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of weeding.}\r\nAbout the middest of Iune, you shall beginne to weede your Corne, in\r\nsuch sort as hath beene before described in the former Chapters: and\r\nalthough this soile naturally of it selfe (if it haue receiued his whole\r\nArdor in due seasons, and haue beene Ploughed cleane, according to the\r\noffice of a good Husband) doth neither put forth Thistle or other weede,\r\nyet if it want either the one or the other, it is certaine that it puts\r\nthem forth in great abundance, for by Thistles and weedes, vpon this\r\nsoile, is euer knowne the goodnesse and dilligence of the Husbandman.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Foiling.}\r\nAbout the middest of Iuly, you shall beginne to foile your land, in such\r\nsort also as hath beene mentioned in the former Chapters, onely with\r\nthis obseruation that if any of your lands lie flat, you shall then, in\r\nyour foiling, plough those lands vpward and not downeward, holding your\r\nfirst precept that in this soile, your lands must lie high, light, and\r\nhollow, which if you see they doe, then you may if you please in your\r\nfoiling cast them downeward, because at Winter ridging you may set them\r\nvp againe.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Manuring.}\r\nNow for as much as in this Chapter I haue hitherto omitted to speake of\r\nManuring this soile, you shall vnderstand that it is not because I hold\r\nit so rich that it needeth no Manure, but because I know there is\r\nnothing more needfull vnto it then Manure, in so much that I wish not\r\nthe Husbandman of this ground to binde himselfe vnto any one particular\r\nseason of the yeere for the leading forth of his Manure, but to bestow\r\nall his leasurable houres and rest from other workes onely vpon this\r\nlabor, euen through the circuit of the whole yeere, knowing this most\r\nprecisely, that at what time of the yeere so euer you shall lay Manure\r\nvpon this earth it will returne much profit.\r\n\r\nAs for the choise of Manures vpon this soile they are all those\r\nwhatsoeuer, of which I haue formerly intreated in any of the other\r\nChapters, no Manure whatsoeuer comming amisse to this ground: prouided\r\nthat the Husbandman haue this respect to lay vpon his moystest and\r\ncoldest ground his hottest Manures, and vpon his hottest and driest\r\nearth his coolest and moistest Manures: the hot Manures being\r\nSheepes-dung, Pigions-dung, Pullen-dung, Lyme, Ashes, and such like: the\r\ncoole being Oxe-dung, Horse-dung, the scowrings of Ponds, Marle, and\r\nsuch like.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Winter-ridging.}\r\nAbout the middest of September you shall beginne to Winter-ridge your\r\nLand, which in all points you shall doe according as is mentioned in the\r\nformer Chapters of the Clayes: for in this Ardor there is neuer any\r\ndifference, onely this one small obseruation, that you may aduenture to\r\nWinter-ridge this mixt earth sooner then any other: for many of our best\r\nEnglish Husbandmen which liue vpon this soile doe hold this opinion,\r\nthat if it be Winter-ridged so earely in the yeere, that through the\r\nvertue of the latter spring it put forth a certaine greene weede like\r\nmosse, bring short and soft, that the land is so much the better\r\ntherefore, being as they imagine both fed and comforted by such a\r\nslender expression which doth not take from the land any hart, but like\r\na warme couering doth ripen and make mellow the mould, and this cannot\r\nbe effected but onely by earely Winter-ridging.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Sowing of Wheate, Rye, and Maslin.}\r\nAt the end of September you shall beginne to sow your Wheate, Rye, and\r\nMaslin, all which Graines are very naturall, good, and profitable vpon\r\nthis soile, and are to be sowne after the same manner, and with the same\r\nobseruations which are specified in the former Chapter of the blacke\r\nclay, that is to say, the Wheate vnder furrow, and vnharrowed, the Rye\r\nand Maslin aboue furrow, and well harrowed. And herein is also to be\r\nremembred all those precepts mentioned in the Chapter of the blacke\r\nClay, touching the diuision of the fields, that is to say, if you haue\r\nthree fields, you shall then sow your Wheate, Rye and Maslin in your\r\nfallow-field, and so saue both the Foyling and double manuring of so\r\nmuch earth: but if you haue foure fields, then you shall sow those\r\ngraines vpon that land from whence the same yeere you did reape your\r\nPease; your Wheate hauing no other Manure then that which came by the\r\nPease, your Rye hauing, if possible, eyther Manure from the Cart, or\r\nfrom the Folde, in such sort as hath beene shewed in the Chapter of the\r\nblacke Clay, and this of Husbandmen is called Inam-wheate or Inam-rye,\r\nthat is, white-corne sowne after white-corne, as Barley after Barley, or\r\nhard-corne after hard-corne, which is wheate after Pease.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the plough.}\r\nNow for the Plough which is most proper for this soile it is to be made\r\nof a middle size betwixt that for the blacke Clay, and that for the red\r\nSand, being not all out so bigge and vnwieldy as the first, nor so\r\nslender and nimble as the latter, but taking a middle proportion from\r\nthem both, you shall make your Plough of a competent fitnesse.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the plough-Irons.}\r\nAs for the Irons, the Share must be of the same proportion that the\r\nShare for the red Sand is, yet a little thought bigger, and the Coulture\r\nof the fashion of that Coulture, onely not full so much bent, but\r\nall-out as sharpe and as long: and these Irons must be euer well\r\nmaintained with steele, for this mixt earth is euer the hardest, and\r\nweareth both the Plough and Irons soonest, and therefore it is agreed\r\nby all Husbandmen that this Plough must not at any time want his\r\nPlough-slip, except at the first going of the Plough you shall finde\r\nthat it hath too much land, that is to say, by the crosse setting on of\r\nthe beame, that it runneth too greedily into the land, which to helpe,\r\nyou shall let your Plough goe without a plough-slip, till the\r\nplough-head be so much worne, that it take no more but an ordinary\r\nfurrow, and then you shall set on your Plough-slips and Plough clouts\r\nalso: but I write this in case there be imperfection in the Plough,\r\nwhich if it be otherwise, then this obseruation is needlesse.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the Teame.}\r\nNow for the Teame or Draught which shall draw this Plough, they are as\r\nthe former, Oxen or Horses, and their number the same that is prescribed\r\nfor the blacke Clay, as namely, eight or sixe Beasts for Pease-earth,\r\nfor Fallowing, and Summer-stirring, and sixe or foure for all other\r\nArdors: for you must vnderstand that this mixt and binding soile,\r\nthrough his hardnesse, and glutenous holding together, is as hard to\r\nplow as any clay-soile whatsoeuer, and in some speciall seasons more by\r\nmany degrees.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the white clay with white Sand.}\r\nNow for the white clay mixt with white sand, it is an earth much more\r\nbarraine, then this former mixt earth, and bringeth forth nothing\r\nwithout much care, diligence, and good order: yet, for his manner of\r\nEarings, in their true natures euery way doe differ nothing from the\r\nEarings of this blacke clay and red Sand, onely the Seede which must be\r\nsowne vpon this soile differeth from the former: for vpon this soile in\r\nstead of Barley you must sow most Oates, as a Graine which will take\r\nmuch strength from little fertilitie: and in stead of Rye you shall sow\r\nmore Wheate and more Pease, or in stead of Pease then you shall sow\r\nFitches of eyther kinde which you please, and the increase will be\r\n(though not in abundance, yet) so sufficient as shall well quit the\r\nPlow-mans labour.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Manuring.}\r\nNow for the Manuring of this ground, you shall vnderstand that Marle is\r\nthe chiefest: for neyther will any man suppose that this hard soile\r\nshould bring vp cattell sufficient to manure it, nor if it would, yet\r\nthat Manure were not so good: for a barraine clay being mixt with a most\r\nbarraine sand, it must consequently follow that the soile must be of all\r\nthe barenest, insomuch that to giue perfect strength and life vnto it,\r\nthere is nothing better then Marle, which being a fat and strong clay,\r\nonce incorporated within these weake moulds, it must needes giue them\r\nthe best nourishment, loosening the binding substance, and binding that\r\nweaknesse which occasioneth the barrainnesse: but of this Marle I shall\r\nhaue more occasion to speake hereafter in a particular Chapter, onely\r\nthus much I must let you vnderstand, that this soile, albe it be not\r\nwithin any degree of praise for the bringing forth of Corne, yet it is\r\nvery apt and fruitfull for the breeding of grasse, insomuch that it will\r\nbeare you corne for at least nine yeeres together (without the vse of\r\nany fallow or Tilth-field) if it be well marled, and immediately after\r\nit will beare you very good breeding grasse, or else reasonable Medow\r\nfor as many yeeres after, as by daily experience we see in the Countries\r\nof Lancaster and Chester. So that the consequence being considered, this\r\nground is not but to be held indifferent fruitfull: for whereas other\r\nsoiles afore shewed (which beare abundance of Graine) are bound to be\r\nmanured once in three yeeres, this soile, albe it beare neither so rich\r\ngraine, nor so much plenty, yet it needes marling not aboue once in\r\nsixteene or eighteene yeeres: and albe Marle be a Manure of the greatest\r\ncost, yet the profit by continuance is so equall that the labour is\r\nneuer spent without his reward, as shall more largely appeare hereafter.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the Plough.}\r\nAs touching the Plough, it is the same which is mentioned in the other\r\nsoile of the blacke Clay, and red Sand, altering nothing eyther in\r\nquantitie of timber, or strength of Irons: so that to make any large\r\ndescription thereof, is but to double my former discourses, and make my\r\nwritings tedious.\r\n\r\nFor to conclude briefely, these two soiles differ onely but in fatnesse\r\nand strength of nature, not in Earing, or plowing, so that the labours\r\nof tillage being equall there is not any alteration more then the true\r\ndiligence of much manuring, which will breede an affinitie or alyance\r\nbetwixt both these soiles. And thus much for this blacke Clay and red\r\nSand, or white Clay and white Sand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\n  THE\r\n  FIRST PART\r\n  OF THE ENGLISH\r\n  Husbandman:\r\n  Contayning, the manner of plowing and Manuring all sorts of Soyles,\r\n  together with the manner of planting and setting of Corne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n_Of the manner of plowing all simple Earths, which are vncompounded._\r\n\r\n\r\nThat many famous and learned men, both in Fraunce, Spaine, Italy and\r\nGermany, haue spent all their best time in shewing vnto the world the\r\nexcellencie of their experiences, in this onely renowned Arte of\r\nHusbandry, their large and learned Volumes, most excellently written, in\r\nthat kinde, are witnesses: from whence we by translations haue gotten\r\nsome contentment, though but small profit; because those forraine\r\nclymates, differing much from ours, both in nature of earth, and temper\r\nof Ayre, the rules and obseruations belonging vnto them can be little\r\nauailable to vs, more then to know what is done in such parts, a thing\r\nmore appertaining to our conference then practise. But now, that other\r\nkingdomes may see though wee write lesse yet wee know as much as\r\nbelongeth to the office of the English Husbandman, I, though the meanest\r\nof many millions, haue vndertaken to deliuer vnto the world all the true\r\nrudiments, obseruations and knowledges what soeuer, which hath any\r\naffinitie or alliance with English Husbandry. And for as much as the\r\nbest and principallest part of Husbandry consisteth in the plowing and\r\nearring of the ground (for in that onely _Adam_ began his first labours)\r\nI thinke it not vnmeete, first to treate of that subiect, proceeding so\r\nfrom braunch to braunch, till I haue giuen euery one sufficient\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nTo speake then first of the Tilling of Grounds. You shall well\r\nvnderstand, that it is the office of euery good Husbandman before he put\r\nhis plough into the earth, truly to consider the nature of his Grounds,\r\nand which is of which quallitie and temper. To proceede then to our\r\npurpose; all soyles what soeuer, in this our kingdome of England, are\r\nreduced into two kindes onely, that is to say, Simple or Compound.\r\nSimple, are those which haue no mixture with others of a contrary\r\nquallitie, as are your stiffe clayes, or your loose sands: your stiffe\r\nclayes are likewise diuers, as a blacke clay, a blew clay, and a clay\r\nlike vnto Marble. Your sands are also diuers, as a red sand, a white\r\nsand, a yellow sand, and a sand like vnto dust. Your mixt earths are\r\nwhere any of these clayes and sands are equally or vnindifferently mixed\r\ntogether, as shalbe at large declared hereafter. Now as touching the\r\ntilling of your simple clayes, it is to be noted, that the blacke clay,\r\nof all earth, is the most fruitfull, and demandeth from the Husbandman\r\nthe least toyle, yet bringeth forth his increase in the greatest\r\nabundance: it will well and sufficiently bring forth three crops, eare\r\nit desire rest: namely, the first of Barly, the second of Pease, and the\r\nthird of Wheate: It doth not desire much Manure, for it is naturally of\r\nit selfe so fat, rich, and fruitfull, that if you adde strength vnto his\r\nstrength, by heaping Manure or Compasse thereupon, you make it either\r\nblast, and mildew the Corne that growes, with the too much fatnesse of\r\nthe earth, or else through his extreame rankenesse, to bring it vp in\r\nsuch abundance that it is not able to stand vpright when it is shot vp,\r\nbut falling downe flat to the ground, and the eares of Corne smothering\r\none another, they bring forth nothing but light Corne, like an emptie\r\nhuske, without a kirnell. The best Manure or Compasse therefore that you\r\ncan giue such ground, is then to plow it in orderly and dew seasons, as\r\nthus: you shall begin to fallow, or breake vp this soyle, at the\r\nbeginning of May, at which time you shall plow it deepe, & take vp a\r\nlarge furrow, and if your Lands lye any thing flat, it shalbe meete that\r\nyou begin on the ridge of the land, and turne all your furrowes vpward,\r\nbut if your Lands lye high and vpright, then shall you begin in the\r\nfurrow and turne all your furrowes downeward, which is called of\r\nHusbandmen, the casting downe of Land. This first plowing of ground, or\r\nas Husbandmen tearme it, the first ardor, is called fallowing: the\r\nsecond ardor, which we call stirring of ground, or sommer stirring, you\r\nshall begin in Iuly, which is of great consequence, for by meanes of it\r\nyou shall kill all manner of weedes and thistells that would annoy your\r\nLand. In this ardor you must oft obserue that if when you fallowed you\r\ndid set vp your Land, then now when you stirre you must cast downe your\r\nLand, and so contrarily, if before you did cast downe, then now you must\r\nset vp: your third ardor, which is called of Husbandmen, winter\r\nridgeing, or setting vp Land for the whole yeere, you shall begin at the\r\nlatter end of September, and you must euer obserue that in this third\r\nardor you doe alwaies ridge vp your Land, that is to say, you most turne\r\neuery furrow vpward and lay them as close together as may be, for\r\nshould you doe otherwise, that is to say, either lay them flat or\r\nloosely, the winter season would so beat and bake them together, that\r\nwhen you should sow your seede you would hardly get your plough into the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nNow your fourth and last ardor, which must be when you sow your seede,\r\nyou shall begin euer about the midst of March, at least one weeke before\r\nour Ladies day, commonly called the Annunciation of _Mary_, and this\r\nardor you shall euer plow downeward, laying your ridges very well open,\r\nand you shall euer obserue in this ardor, first to sow your seede, and\r\nthen after to plow your ground, turning your seede into the earth, which\r\nis called of Husbandmen, sowing vnderfurrow: as soone as your ground is\r\nplowed you shall harrow it with an harrow whose teeth are all of wood,\r\nfor these simple earths are of easie temper and will of themselues fall\r\nto dust, then after you haue thus sowne your ground, if then there\r\nremaine any clots or lumpes of earth vnbroken, you shall let them rest\r\ntill after the next shower of raine, at which time you shall either with\r\na heauie rouler, or the backside of your harrowes, runne ouer your\r\nLands, which is called the sleighting of ground, and it will not onely\r\nbreake such clots to dust, but also lay your Land plaine and smoth,\r\nleauing no impediment to hinder the Corne from sprouting and comming\r\nforth. In this same ordor as you are appointed for this blacke clay, in\r\nthis same manner you shall ordor both your blew clay & your clay which\r\nis like vnto marble. Now as touching the plough which is fittest for\r\nthese clayes, it must be large and strong, the beame long and well\r\nbending, the head thicke and large, the skeeth broad, strong, and well\r\nsloaping, the share with a very large wing, craueing much earth, and the\r\ncoulter long, thicke and very straight.\r\n\r\nNow touching those lands which are simple and vncompounded, you shall\r\nvnderstand that euery good Husbandman must begin his first ardor (which\r\nis to fallow them) at the beginning of Ianuary, hee must sooner stirre\r\nthem, which is the second ardor, at the latter end of Aprill, he shall\r\ncast them downe againe, which is called foyling of Land, at the\r\nbeginning of Iuly, which is the third ardor, and wherein is to be noted,\r\nthat how soeuer all other ardors are plowed, yet this must euer be cast\r\ndownward: the fourth ardor, which is winter-stirring or winter-ridgeing,\r\nmust euer begin at the end of September, and the fift and last ardor\r\nmust be performed when you sow your ground, which would be at the\r\nmiddest of May, at the soonest, and if your leasure and abilitie will\r\ngiue you leaue, if you turne ouer your ground againe in Ianuary, it will\r\nbe much better, for these sands can neuer haue too much plowing, nor too\r\nmuch Manure, and therefore for them both, you shall apply them so oft as\r\nyour leasure will conueniently serue, making no spare when either the\r\nway or opportunitie will giue you leaue. Now for as much as all sands,\r\nbeing of a hot nature, are the fittest to bring foorth Rye, which is a\r\ngraine delighting in drynesse onely, you shall vnderstand, that then you\r\nshall not need to plow your ground aboue foure times ouer, that is, you\r\nshall fallow, sommer stirre, foyle, and in September sow your Corne: and\r\nas these ardors serue the red sand, so are they sufficient for your\r\nwhite sand, and your yealow sand also. As touching the ploughes fit for\r\nthese light earths, they would be little and strong, hauing a short\r\nslender beame and a crooked; a narrow and thinne head, a slender skeeth,\r\na share without a wing, a coulter thinne and very crooked, and a paire\r\nof hales much bending forward towards the man; and with this manner of\r\nplough you may plow diuers mixt and compounded earths, as the blacke\r\nclay and red sand, or the red sand and white grauell: and thus much as\r\ntouching earths that are simple and vncompounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n_Of the manner of plowing the blacke clay mixt with white sand, and the\r\nwhite clay mixt with red sand: their Earrings, Plough, and Implements._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs touching the mixture of these two seuerall soyles, that is to say,\r\nthe blacke clay with white sand, and the white clay with red sand, they\r\ndiffer not in the nature of plowing, sowing, or in Manuring, from the\r\nsoyle which is mixt of a blacke clay and red sand, of which I haue\r\nsufficiently intreated before: onely thus much you shall vnderstand,\r\nthat the blacke clay mixt with white sand is so much better and richer\r\nthen the white clay mixt with red sand, by as much as the blacke clay is\r\nbetter then the white clay: and although some Husbandmen in our Land,\r\nhould them to be both of one temper and goodnesse, reasoning thus, that\r\nby how much the blacke clay is better then the white, by so much the red\r\nsand is better then the white sand, so that what the mixture of the one\r\naddeth, the mixture of the other taketh away, and so maketh them all one\r\nin fruitfulnesse and goodnesse: but in our common experience it doth not\r\nso fall out, for wee finde that the blacke clay mixt with white sand, if\r\nit be ordered in the forme of good Husbandry, that is to say, be plowed\r\nouer at least foure times, before it come to be sowne, and that it be\r\nManured and compassed in Husbandly fashion, which is to allow at least\r\neight waine-load to an Aker, that if then vpon such Land you shall sow\r\neither Organe Wheat (in the south parts called red Wheat) or flaxen, or\r\nwhite Pollard Wheat, that such Wheat will often mildew, and turne as\r\nblacke as soote, which onely showeth too much richnesse and fatnesse in\r\nthe earth, which the white clay mixt with red sand hath neuer beene\r\nseene to doe, especially so long as it is vsed in any Husbandly\r\nfashion, neither will the white clay mixt with red sand indure to be\r\ndeuided into foure fields, that is to say, to beare three seuerall\r\ncrops, one after another, as namely, Barly, Pease, and Wheat, without\r\nrest, which the blacke clay mixt with white sand many times doth, and\r\nthereby againe showeth his better fruitfulnesse: neuerthelesse, in\r\ngeneralitie I would not wish any good Husbandman, and especially such as\r\nhaue much tillage, to deuide either of these soyles into any more then\r\nthree fields, both because hee shall ease himselfe and his Cattell of\r\nmuch toyle, shall not at any time loose the best seasons for his best\r\nworkes, and make his commodities, and fruit of his hands labours, by\r\nmany degrees more certaine.\r\n\r\nYou shall also vnderstand, that both these soyles are very much binding,\r\nespecially the white clay with red sand, both because the clay,\r\nproceeding from a chaukie and limie substance, and not hauing in it much\r\nfatnesse or fertillitie (which occasioneth seperation) being mixt with\r\nthe red sand, which is of a much more hardnesse and aptnesse to knit\r\ntogether, with such tough matter, it must necessarilie binde and cleaue\r\ntogether, and so likewise the blacke clay, from whence most naturally\r\nproceedeth your best limestone, being mixt with white sand, doth also\r\nbinde together and stifle the seede, if it be not preuented by good\r\nHusbandry.\r\n\r\nYou shall therefore in the plowing and earring of these two soyles,\r\nobserue two especiall notes; the first, that by no meanes you plow it in\r\nthe wet, that is, in any great glut of raine: for if you either lay it\r\nvp, or cast it downe, when it is more like morter then earth, if then\r\nany sunshine, or faire weather, doe immediately follow vpon it, it will\r\nso drie and bake it, that if it be sowne, neither will the seede haue\r\nstrength to sprout thorrow it, nor being in any of your other summer\r\nardors, shall you by any meanes make your plough enter into it againe,\r\nwhen the season falleth for other plowing. The second, that you haue\r\ngreat care you lay your Land high and round, that the furrowes, as it\r\nwere standing vpright one by another, or lying light and hollow, one\r\nvpon another, you may with more ease, at any time, enter in your plough,\r\nand turne your moulde which way you please, either in the heate of\r\nSommer, or any other time of the yeere whatsoeuer.\r\n\r\nNow as touching the plough, which is most best and proper for these\r\nsoyles, it would be the same in sise which is formerly directed for the\r\nred sand, onely the Irons must be altered, for the Coulter would be more\r\nlong, sharpe, and bending, and the share so narrow, sharpe, and small as\r\ncan conueniently be made, according as is formerly expressed, that not\r\nhauing power to take vp any broad furrow, the furrowes by reason of\r\nthere slendernesse may lye many, and those many both hollow, light and\r\nat any time easily to be broken.\r\n\r\nAs for the Teame which is best to worke in this soyle, they may be\r\neither Horses or Oxen, or Oxen and Horse mixt together, according to the\r\nHusbandmans abillitie, but if hee be a Lord of his owne pleasure and may\r\ncommaund, and haue euery thing which is most apt and proper, then in\r\nthese two soyles, I preferre the Teame of Horses single, rather then\r\nOxen, especially in any winter or moist ardor, because they doe not\r\ntread and foyle the ground making it mirie and durtie as the Oxe doth,\r\nbut going all in one furrow, doe keepe the Land in his constant\r\nfirmenesse.\r\n\r\nAs touching the clotting, sleighting, weeding, and dressing of these two\r\nsoyles, they differ in nothing from the former mixt earths, but desire\r\nall one manner of dilligence: and thus much for these two soyles the\r\nblacke clay mixt with white sand, and the white clay with white red\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_A comparison of all the former soyles together, and most especiall notes\r\nfor giuing the ignorant Husbandman perfect vnderstanding, of what is\r\nwritten before._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reason why I haue thus at large discoursed of euery seuerall soyle,\r\nboth simple and compounded, is to show vnto the industrious Husbandman,\r\nthe perfect and true reason of the generall alteration of our workes in\r\nHusbandry, through this our Realme of England: for if all our Land, as\r\nit is one kingdome, were likewise of one composition, mixture, and\r\ngoodnesse, it were then exceeding preposterous to see those diuersities,\r\nalterations, I, and euen contrary manners of proceedings in Husbandry,\r\nwhich are daily and hourely vsed: but euery man in his owne worke knowes\r\nthe alteration of clymates. Yet for so much as this labour of Husbandry,\r\nconsisteth not for the most part in the knowing and vnderstanding\r\nbreast, but in the rude, simple, and ignorant Clowne, who onely knoweth\r\nhow to doe his labour, but cannot giue a reason why he doth such labour,\r\nmore then the instruction of his parents, or the custome of the\r\nCountrie, where it comes to passe (and I haue many times seene the same\r\nto mine admiration) that the skillfullest Clowne which is bred in the\r\nclay soyles, when hee hath beene brought to the sandy ground, hee could\r\nneither hould the plough, temper the plough, nor tell which way in good\r\norder to driue the Cattell, the heauinesse of the one labour being so\r\ncontrary to the lightnesse of the other, that not hauing a temperance,\r\nor vnderstanding in his hands, hee hath beene put euen vnto his wittes\r\nends; therefore I thinke it conuenient, in this place, by a slight\r\ncomparison of soyles together, to giue the simplest Husbandman such\r\ndirect & plaine rules that he shall with out the study of his braines,\r\nattaine to absolute knowledge of euery seuerall mixture of earth: and\r\nalbeit hee shall not be able distinctly to say at the first that it is\r\ncompounded of such and such earths, yet hee shall be very able to\r\ndeliuer the true reason and manner how such ground (of what nature\r\nsoeuer) shall be Husbanded and tilled.\r\n\r\nTherefore to begin the Husbandman, is to vnderstand, that generally\r\nthere are but two soyles for him to regard, for in them consisteth the\r\nwhole Arte of Husbandry: as namely, the open and loose earth, and the\r\nclose and fast binding earth, and these two soyles being meare opposites\r\nand contraries, most necessarily require in the Husbandman a double\r\nvnderstanding, for there is no soyle, of what simplicitie or mixture\r\nsoeuer it be, but it is either loose or fast.\r\n\r\nNow to giue you my meaning of these two words, _loose_ and _fast_, it\r\nis, that euery soyle which vpon parching and dry weather, euen when the\r\nSunne beames scorcheth, and as it were baketh the earth, if then the\r\nground vpon such exceeding drought doe moulder and fall to dust, so that\r\nwhereas before when it did retaine moisture it was heauie, tough, and\r\nnot to be seperated, now hauing lost that glewinesse it is light, loose,\r\nand euen with a mans foote to be spurnd to ashes, all such grounds are\r\ntearmed loose and open grounds, because at no time they doe binde in or\r\nimprison the seede (the frost time onely excepted, which is by\r\naccidence, and not from the nature of the soyle:) and all such grounds\r\nas in their moisture or after the fall of any sodaine raine are soft,\r\nplyable, light, and easie to be wrought, but after when they come to\r\nloose that moistnesse and that the powerfulnesse of the Sunne hath as it\r\nwere drid vp their veynes, if then such earths become hard, firme, and\r\nnot to be seperated, then are those soyles tearmed fast and binding\r\nsoyles, for if there ardors be not taken in their due times, and their\r\nseede cast into them in perfect and due seasons, neither is it possible\r\nfor the Plowman to plow them, nor for the seede to sprout through, the\r\nearth being so fastned and as it were stone-like fixt together. Now\r\nsithence that all soyles are drawne into these two heads, fastnes, and\r\nloosenesse, and to them is annexed the diuersitie of all tillage, I will\r\nnow show the simple Husbandman which earths be loose, and which fast,\r\nand how without curiositie to know and to distinguish them.\r\n\r\nBreifely, all soyles that are simple and of themselues vncompounded, as\r\nnamely, all claies, as blacke, white, gray, or blew, and all sands, as\r\neither red, white, or blacke, are open and loose soyles: the claies\r\nbecause the body and substance of them being held together by moistnes,\r\nthat moisture being dryed vp, their strength and stifnesse decayeth, and\r\nsands by reason of their naturall lightnesse, which wanting a more moist\r\nand fixt body to be ioyned with them doe loose all strength of binding\r\nor holding together. Now all mixt or compound earths (except the\r\ncompositions of one and the same kinds, as clay with clay, or sand with\r\nsand) are euer fast and binding earths: for betwixt sand and clay, or\r\nclay & grauell, is such an affinitie, that when they be mixt together\r\nthe sand doth giue to the clay such hardnesse and drynesse, and the clay\r\nto the sand such moisture and coldnesse, that being fixt together they\r\nmake one hard body, which through the warmth of the Sunne bindeth and\r\ncleaueth together. But if it be so that the ignorance of the Husbandman\r\ncannot either through the subtiltie of his eye sight, or the\r\nobseruations gathered from his experience, distinguish of these soyles,\r\nand the rather, sith many soyles are so indifferently mixt, and the\r\ncolour so very perfect, that euen skill it selfe may be deceiued: as\r\nfirst to speake of what mixture some soyles consist, yet for as much as\r\nit is sufficient for the Husbandman to know which is loose and which is\r\nbinding, hee shall onely when he is perplext with these differences, vse\r\nthis experiment, hee shall take a good lumpe of that earth whose\r\ntemperature hee would know, and working it with water and his wet\r\nhands, like a peece of past, he shall then as it were make a cake\r\nthereof, and laying it before an hot fire, there let it lye, till all\r\nthe moisture be dried & backt out of it, then taking it into your hands\r\nand breaking it in peeces, if betweene your fingers it moulder and fall\r\ninto a small dust, then be assured it is a loose, simple, and\r\nvncompounded earth, but if it breake hard and firme, like a stone, and\r\nwhen you crumble it betweene your fingers it be rough, greetie, and\r\nshining, then be assured it is a compounded fast-binding earth, and is\r\ncompounded of clay and sand, and if in the baking it doe turne red or\r\nredish, it is compounded of a gray clay and red sand, but if it be\r\nbrowne or blewish, then it is a blacke clay & white sand, but if when\r\nyou breake it you finde therein many small pibles, then the mixture is\r\nclay and grauell. Now there be some mixt soyles, after they are thus\r\nbak't, although they be hard and binding, yet they will not be so\r\nexceeding hard and stone-like as other soyles will be, and that is where\r\nthe mixture is vnequall, as where the clay is more then the sand, or the\r\nsand more then the clay.\r\n\r\nWhen you haue by this experiment found out the nature of your earth, and\r\ncan tell whether it be simple or compounded, you shall then looke to the\r\nfruitfulnesse thereof, which generally you shall thus distinguish.\r\nFirst, that clayes, simple and of themselues vncompounded, are of all\r\nthe most fruitfull, of which, blacke is the best, that next to clayes,\r\nyour mixt earths are most fertill, and the mixture of the blacke clay\r\nand red sand, called a hasell earth, is the best, and that your sands\r\nare of all soyles most barraine, of which the red sand for profit hath\r\neuer the preheminence.\r\n\r\nNow for the generall tillage and vse of these grounds, you shall\r\nvnderstand that the simple and vncompounded grounds, being loose and\r\nopen (if they lye free from the danger of water) the Lands may be layd\r\nthe flattest and greatest, the furrowes turned vp the largest and\r\nclosest, and the plough and plough-Irons, most large and massie, onely\r\nthose for the sandy grounds must be more slender then those for the\r\nclayes and much more nimble, as hath beene showed before. Now for the\r\nmixt earths, you shall lay your Lands high, round, and little, set your\r\nfurrowes vpright, open, and so small as is possible, and make your\r\nplough and plow Irons most nimble and slender, according to the manner\r\nbefore specified: and thus I conclude, that hee which knoweth the loose\r\nearth and the binding earth, can either helpe or abate the strength of\r\nthe earth, as is needfull, and knowes how to sorte his ploughes to each\r\ntemper, knowes the ground and substance of all tillage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IIII.\r\n\r\n_Of the planting or setting of Corne, and the profit thereof._\r\n\r\n\r\nNot that I am conceited, or carried away with any nouelty or strange\r\npractise, vnusually practised in this kingdome, or that I will ascribe\r\nvnto my selfe to giue any iudiciall approbation or allowance to things\r\nmearely vnfrequented, doe I publish, within my booke, this relation of\r\nthe setting of Corne, but onely because I would not haue our English\r\nHusbandman to be ignorant of any skill or obscure faculty which is\r\neither proper to his profession, or agreeable with the fertillitie and\r\nnature of our clymates, and the rather, since some few yeeres agoe, this\r\n(as it then appeared secret) being with much admiration bruted through\r\nthe kingdome, in so much that according to our weake accustomed\r\ndispositions (which euer loues strange things best) it was held so\r\nworthy, both for generall profit and perticular ease, that very fein\r\n(except the discreet) but did not alone put it in practise, but did euen\r\nground strong beleifes to raise to themselues great common-wealthes by\r\nthe profits thereof; some not onely holding insufficient arguments, in\r\ngreat places, of the invtilitie of the plough, but euen vtterly\r\ncontemning the poore cart Iade, as a creature of no necessitie, so that\r\nPoulters and Carriers, were in good hope to buy Horse-flesh as they\r\nbought egges, at least fiue for a penie; but it hath proued otherwise,\r\nand the Husbandman as yet cannot loose the Horses seruice. But to\r\nproceede to the manner of setting or planting of Corne, it is in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of setting Wheate.}\r\nHauing chosen out an aker of good Corne ground, you shall at the\r\nbeginning of March, appoint at least sixe diggers or laborers with\r\nspades to digge vp the earth gardenwise, at least a foote and three\r\ninches deepe (which is a large spades graft) and being so digged vp, to\r\nrest till Iune, and then to digge it ouer againe, and in the digging to\r\ntrench it and Manure it, as for a garden mould, bestowing at least\r\nsixteene Waine-load of Horse or Oxe Manure vpon the aker, and the Manure\r\nto be well couered within the earth, then so to let it rest vntill the\r\nbeginning of October, which being the time for the setting, you shall\r\nthen digge it vp the third time, and with rakes and beetells breake the\r\nmoulde somewhat small, then shall you take a board of sixe foot square,\r\nwhich shalbe bored full of large wimble holes, each hole standing in\r\ngood order, iust sixe inches one from another, then laying the board\r\nvpon the new digged ground, you shall with a stick, made for the\r\npurpose, through euery hole in the board, make a hole into the ground,\r\nat least fore inches deepe, and then into euery such hole you shall drop\r\na Corne of Wheate, and so remouing the board from place to place, goe\r\nall ouer the ground that you haue digged, and so set each seuerall Corne\r\nsixe inches one from another, and then with a rake you shall rake ouer\r\nand couer all the holes with earth, in such sort that they may not be\r\ndiscerned. And herein you are to obserue by the way that a quarte of\r\nWheate will set your aker: which Wheate is not to be taken as it falles\r\nout by chance when you buy it in the market, but especially culd and\r\npickt out of the eare, being neither the vppermost Cornes which grow in\r\nthe toppes of the eares, nor the lowest, which grow at the setting on of\r\nthe stalke, both which, most commonly are light and of small substance,\r\nbut those which are in the midst, and are the greatest, fullest, and\r\nroundest.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of setting Barly, or Pease.}\r\nNow in the selfe-same sort as you dresse your ground for your Wheate, in\r\nthe selfe same manner you shall dresse your ground for Barly, onely the\r\nfirst time you digge it shalbe after the beginning of May, the second\r\ntime and the Manuring about the midst of October, wherein you shall note\r\nthat to your aker of Barly earth, you shall alow at least foure and\r\ntwentie Waine-load of Manure, and the last time of your digging and\r\nsetting shalbe at the beginning of Aprill.\r\n\r\nNow for the dressing of your earth for the setting of Pease, it is in\r\nall things answerable to that for Barly, onely you may saue the one\r\nhalfe of your Manure, because a dosen Waine-load is sufficient, and the\r\ntime for setting them, or any other pulse, is euer about the midst of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the profit of setting Corne.}\r\nNow for the profit which issueth from this practise of setting of Corne,\r\nI must needs confesse, if I shall speake simply of the thing, that is,\r\nhow many foulds it doubleth and increaseth, surely it is both great and\r\nwonderfull: and whereas ingenerall it is reputed that an aker of set\r\nCorne yeeldeth as much profit as nine akers of sowne Corne, for mine\r\nowne part I haue seene a much greater increase, if euery Corne set in an\r\naker should bring forth so much as I haue seene to proceede from some\r\nthree or foure Cornes set in a garden, but I feare me the generalitie\r\nwill neuer hould with the particular: how euer, it is most certaine that\r\nearth in this sort trimmed and inriched, and Corne in this sort set and\r\npreserued, yeeldeth at least twelue-fold more commoditie then that which\r\nby mans hand is confusedly throwne into the ground from the Hopper:\r\nwhence it hath come to passe that those which by a few Cornes in their\r\ngardens thus set, seeing the innumerable increase, haue concluded a\r\npublique profit to arise thereby to the whole kingdome, not looking to\r\nthe intricacie, trouble, and casualtie, which attends it, being such and\r\nso insupportable that almost no Husbandman is able to vndergoe it: to\r\nwhich we need no better testimony then the example of those which hauing\r\nout of meare couetousnesse and lucre of gaine, followed it with all\r\ngreedinesse, seeing the mischiefes and inconueniences which hath\r\nincountred their workes, haue euen desisted, and forgotten that euer\r\nthere was any such practise, and yet for mine owne part I will not so\r\nvtterly condemne it, that I will depriue it of all vse, but rather leaue\r\nit to the discretion of iudgement, and for my selfe, onely hould this\r\nopinion, that though it may very wel be spared from the generall vse of\r\nWheat and Barly in this kingdome, yet for hastie-Pease, French Beanes,\r\nand such like pulse, it is of necessary imployment, both in rich and\r\npoore mens gardens. And thus much for the setting of Corne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_Of the choice of seede-Corne, and which is best for which soyle._\r\n\r\n\r\nHauing thus showed vnto you the seuerall soyles and temperatures of our\r\nEnglish land, together with the order of Manuring, dressing and tillage\r\nof the same, I thinke it meete (although I haue in generall writ\r\nsomething already touching the seede belonging to euery seuerall earth)\r\nnow to proceede to a particular election and choice of seede-Corne, in\r\nwhich there is great care and diligence to be vsed: for as in Men,\r\nBeasts, Fowle, & euery mouing thing, there is great care taken for the\r\nchoice of the breeders, because the creatures bred doe so much\r\nparticipate of the parents that for the most part they are seene not\r\nonely to carry away their outward figures and semblances, but euen their\r\nnaturall conditions and inclinations, good issuing from good, and euill\r\nfrom euill: so in the choise of seede-Corne, if their be any neglect or\r\ncarelessenesse, the crop issuing of such corrupt seede must of force\r\nbring forth a more corrupt haruest, by as much as it exceedeth in the\r\nmultiplication.\r\n\r\n{SN: The choise of seede Wheate.}\r\nTo proceede therefore to the choise of seede-Corne, I will begin with\r\nWheate, of which there are diuers kindes, as your whole straw Wheate,\r\nthe great browne Pollard, the white Pollard, the Organe or red Wheate,\r\nthe flaxen Wheate, and the chilter Wheate. Your whole straw Wheate, and\r\nbrowne Pollard, are knowne, the first, by his straw, which is full of\r\npith, and hath in it no hollownesse (whence it comes that Husbandmen\r\nesteeme it so much for their thacking, allowing it to be as good and\r\ndurable as reede:) the latter is knowne by his eare, which is great,\r\nwhite, and smooth, without anes or beard vpon it: in the hand they are\r\nboth much like one to another, being of all Wheates the biggest,\r\nroundest and fullest: they be somewhat of a high colour, and haue vpon\r\nthem a very thicke huske, which making the meale somewhat browne causeth\r\nthe Baker not all together to esteeme them for his purest manchet, yet\r\nthe yeeld of flower which cometh from them is as great and greater then\r\nany other Wheate whatsoeuer. These two sortes of Wheate are to be sowne\r\nvpon the fallow field, as crauing the greatest strength and fatnesse of\r\nground, whence it comes that they are most commonly seene to grow vpon\r\nthe richest and stiffest blacke clayes, being a graine of that strength\r\nthat they will seldome or neuer mildew or turne blacke, as the other\r\nsortes of Wheate will doe, if the strength of the ground be not abated\r\nbefore they be throwne into the earth. Now for the choise of these two\r\nWheates, if you be compelled to buy them in the market, you must regard\r\nthat you buy that which is the cleanest and fairest, being vtterly\r\nwithout any weedes, as darnell, cockell, tares or any other foulnesse\r\nwhatsoeuer: you shall looke that the Wheate, as neare as may be, hould\r\nall of one bignesse and all of one colour, for to beholde it contrary,\r\nthat is to say, to see some great Cornes, some little, some high\r\ncoloured, some pale, so that in their mixture they resemble changeable\r\ntaffata, is an apparant signe that the Corne is not of one kinde but\r\nmixt or blended, as being partly whole-straw, partly Pollard, partly\r\nOrgane, and partly Chelter. For the flaxen, it is naturally so white\r\nthat it cannot be mixt but it may easily be discerned, and these mixt\r\nseedes are neuer good, either for the ground or the vse of man. Againe\r\nyou shall carefully looke that neither this kinde of Wheate, nor any\r\nother that you buy for seede be blacke at the ends, for that is a signe\r\nthat the graine comming from too rich a soyle was mildewed, and then it\r\nwill neuer be fruitfull or proue good seede, as also you shall take care\r\nthat it be not too white at the ends, showing the Corne to be as it were\r\nof two colours, for that is a signe that the Wheate was washt and dried\r\nagaine, which vtterly confoundeth the strength of the Corne and takes\r\nfrom it all abilitie of bringing forth any great encrease. Now if it be\r\nso that you haue a crop of Wheate of your owne, so that you haue no need\r\nof the market, you shall then picke out of your choisest sheafes, and\r\nvpon a cleane floare gently bat them with a flaile, and not thresh them\r\ncleane, for that Corne which is greatest, fullest, and ripest, will\r\nfirst flie out of the eare, and when you haue so batted a competent\r\nquantitie you shall then winnow it and dresse it cleane, both by the\r\nhelpe of a strong winde and open siues, and so make it fit for your\r\nseede.\r\n\r\nI haue seene some Husbands (and truely I haue accounted them both good\r\nand carefull) that haue before Wheate seede time both themselues, wiues,\r\nchildren, and seruants at times of best leasure, out of a great Wheate\r\nmow or bay, to gleane or pull out of the sheafes, eare by eare, the most\r\nprincipall eares, and knitting them vp in small bundells to bat them and\r\nmake their seede thereof, and questionlesse it is the best seede of all\r\nother: for you shall be sure that therein can be nothing but the\r\ncleanest and the best of the Corne, without any weedes or foulnesse,\r\nwhich can hardly be when a man thresheth the whole sheafe, and although\r\nsome men may thinke that this labour is great and troblesome, especially\r\nsuch as sowe great quantities of Wheate, yet let them thus farre\r\nencourage themselues, that if they doe the first yeere but gleane a\r\nbushell or two (which is nothing amongst a few persons) and sowe it vp\r\non good Land, the encrease of it will the next yeere goe farre in the\r\nsowing the whole crop: for when I doe speake of this picking of Wheate,\r\neare by eare, I doe not intend the picking of many quarters, but of so\r\nmuch as the increase thereof may amount to some quarter.\r\n\r\nNow there is also another regarde to be had (as auailable as any of the\r\nformer) in chusing of your seede Wheate, and that is to respect the\r\nsoyle from whence you take your seede, and the soyle into which you put\r\nit, as thus.\r\n\r\nIf the ground whereon you meane to sowe your Wheat be a rich, blacke,\r\nclay, stiffe and full of fertillitie, you shall then (as neare as you\r\ncan) chuse your seede from the barrainest mixt earth you can finde (so\r\nthe Wheate be whole-straw or Pollard) as from a clay and grauell, or a\r\nclay and white sand, that your seede comming from a much more barraine\r\nearth then that wherein you put it, the strength may be as it were\r\nredoubled, and the encrease consequently amount to a higher quantitie,\r\nas we finde it proueth in our daylie experience; but if these barraine\r\nsoyles doe not afforde you seede to your contentment, it shall not then\r\nbe amisse (you sowing your Wheate vpon fallow or tilth ground) if you\r\ntake your seede-Wheate either from an earth of like nature to your owne,\r\nor from any mixt earth, so that such seede come from the niams, that is,\r\nthat it hath beene sowne after Pease, as being the third crop of the\r\nLand, and not from the fallow or tilth ground, for it is a maxiome\r\namongst the best Husbands (though somewhat proposterous to common sence)\r\nbring to your rich ground seede from the barraine, and to the barraine\r\nseede from the rich, their reason (taken from their experience) being\r\nthis, that the seede (as before I said) which prospereth vpon a leane\r\nground being put into a rich, doth out of that superfluitie of warmth,\r\nstrength and fatnesse, double his increase; and the seede which commeth\r\nfrom the fat ground being put into the leane, hauing all the vigour,\r\nfulnesse and iuyce of fertilnes, doth not onely defend it selfe against\r\nthe hungrinesse of the ground but brings forth increase contrary to\r\nexpectation; whence proceedeth this generall custome of good Husbands in\r\nthis Land, that those which dwell in the barraine woode Lands, heathes\r\nand high mountaine countries of this kingdome, euer (as neere as they\r\ncan) seeke out their seede in the fruitfull low vales, and very gardens\r\nof the earth, & so likewise those in the vales take some helpes also\r\nfrom the mountaines.\r\n\r\nNow for your other sortes of Wheate, that is to say, the white Pollard\r\nand the Organe, they are graines nothing so great, full, and large, as\r\nthe whole straw, or browne Pollard, but small, bright, and very thinly\r\nhuskt: your Organe is very red, your Pollard somewhat pale: these two\r\nsorts of Wheate are best to be sowne vpon the third or fourth field,\r\nthat is to say, after your Pease, for they can by no meanes endure an\r\nouer rich ground, as being tender and apt to sprout with small moisture,\r\nbut to mildew and choake with too much fatnesse, the soyles most apt for\r\nthem are mixt earths, especially the blacke clay and red sand, or white\r\nclay and red sand, for as touching other mixtures of grounds, they are\r\nfor the most part so barraine, that they will but hardly bring forth\r\nWheate vpon their fallow field, and then much worse vpon a fourth field.\r\nNow for any other particular choise of these two seedes, they are the\r\nsame which I shewed in the whole straw, and great Pollard. As for the\r\nflaxen Wheate, and chilter Wheate, the first, is a very white Wheate\r\nboth inward and outward, the other a pale red or deepe yellow: they are\r\nthe least of all sorts of Wheate, yet of much more hardnes and\r\ntoughnesse in sprouting, then either the Organe or white Pollard, and\r\ntherefore desire somewhat a more richer soyle, and to that end they are\r\nfor the most part sowne vpon fallow fields, in mixt earths, of what\r\nnatures or barrainenesse soeuer, as is to be seene most generally ouer\r\nall the South parts of this Realme: and although vncompounded sands out\r\nof their owne natures, doe hardly bring forth any Wheate, yet vpon some\r\nof the best sands and vpon the flintie grauels, I haue seene these two\r\nWheates grow in good abundance, but being seldome it is not so much to\r\nbe respected.\r\n\r\n{SN: The choise of seede Rye.}\r\nAfter your Wheate you shall make choise of your Rie, of which there is\r\nnot diuers kindes although it carrie diuers complections, as some\r\nblackish, browne, great, full and long as that which for the most part\r\ngrowes vpon the red sand, or red clay, which is three parts red sand\r\nmixt with blacke clay, and is the best Rie: the other a pale gray Rie,\r\nshort, small, and hungry, as that which growes vpon the white sand, or\r\nwhite clay and white sand, and is the worst Rie. Now you shall\r\nvnderstand that your sand grounds are your onely naturall grounds for\r\nRie, as being indeede not principally apt for any other graine,\r\ntherefore when you chuse your Rie for seede, you shall chuse that which\r\nis brownest, full, bould, and longest, you shall haue great care that it\r\nbe free from weedes or filth, sith your sand grounds, out of their owne\r\nnaturall heat, doth put forth such store of naughtie weeds, that except\r\na man be extraordinarily carefull, both in the choise and dressing of\r\nhis Rie, he may easily be deceiued and poyson his ground with those\r\nweedes, which with great difficultie are after rooted out againe. Now\r\nfor your seedes to each soyle, it is euer best to sow your best sand-Rie\r\nvpon your best clay ground, and your best clay-Rie vpon your best sand\r\nground, obseruing euer this generall principle, not onely in Rie, but\r\neuen in Wheat, Barly, Pease and other graine of account, that is, euer\r\nonce in three yeeres, to change all your seede, which you shall finde\r\nboth to augment your encrease and to returne you double profit.\r\n\r\n{SN: The choise of seede-Barly.}\r\nNow for the choise of your seede-Barly, you shall vnderstand, that for\r\nas much as it is a graine of the greatest vse, & most tendernesse,\r\ntherefore there is the greatest diligence to be vsed in the election\r\nthereof. Know then that of Barly there be diuers sorts, as namely, that\r\nwhich wee call our common Barly, being long eares with two rankes of\r\nCorne, narrow, close, and vpright: another called spike or\r\nbatteldore-Barly, being a large eare with two rankes of Corne, broad,\r\nflat, and in fashion of a batteldore: and the third called beane-Barly,\r\nor Barly big, being a large foure-square eare, like vnto an eare of\r\nWheate.\r\n\r\nOf these three Barlyes the first is most in vse, as being most apt and\r\nproper to euery soyle, whether it be fruitfull or barraine, in this our\r\nkingdome, but they haue all one shape, colour and forme, except the\r\nsoyle alter them, onely the spike-Barly is most large and plentifull,\r\nthe common Barly hardest and aptest to grow, and the beane-Barly least,\r\npalest, & tenderest, so that with vs it is more commonly seene in\r\ngardens then in fields, although in other Countries, as in Fraunce,\r\nIreland, and such like, they sowe no other Barly at all, but with vs it\r\nis of no such generall estimation, and therefore I will neither giue it\r\nprecedencie nor speake of it, otherwise then to referre it to the\r\ndiscreation of him who takes delight in many practises: but for the\r\ncommon Barly, or spike-Barly, which our experience findes to be\r\nexcellent and of great vse, I will knit them in one, and write, my full\r\nopinion of them, for their choise in our seede. You shall know then that\r\nwhen you goe into the market to chuse Barly for your seede, you shall to\r\nyour best power elect that which is whitest, fullest, and roundest,\r\nbeing as the ploughman calles it, a full bunting Corne, like the nebbe\r\nor beake of a Bunting, you shall obserue that it be all of one Corne,\r\nand not mingled, that is, clay Barly, and sand Barly together, which you\r\nshall distinguish by these differences: the clay Barly is of a palish,\r\nwhite, yellow colour; smoth, full, large, and round, and the sand Barly\r\nis of a deepe yellow, browne at the neather end, long, slender, and as\r\nit were, withered, and in generall no sand Barly is principall good for\r\nseede: but if the Barly be somewhat of a high colour, and browne at the\r\nneather end, yet notwithstanding is very full, bould, and bigge, then it\r\nis a signe that such Barly comes not from the sand, but rather from an\r\nouer fat soyle, sith the fatnesse of the earth doth euer alter the\r\ncomplection of the Barly; for the whiter Barly euer the leaner soyle,\r\nand better seede: you shall also obserue, that there be not in it any\r\nlight Corne, which is a kinde of hungry graine without substance, which\r\nalthough it filleth the seeds-mans hand, yet it deceiueth the ground,\r\nand this light Corne will commonly be amongst the best Barly: for where\r\nthe ground is so rich that it bringeth forth the Barly too rankely,\r\nthere the Corne, wanting power to stand vpon roote, falleth to the\r\nground, and so robde of kindly ripening, bringeth forth much light and\r\ninsufficient graine. Next this, you shall take care that in your\r\nseede-Barly there be not any Oates, for although they be in this case\r\namongst Husbandmen accounted the best of weede, yet are they such a\r\ndisgrace, that euery good Husband will most diligently eschew them, and\r\nfor that cause onely will our most industrious Husbands bestow the\r\ntedious labour of gleaning their Barly, eare by eare, by which\r\ngleanings, in a yeere, or two, they will compasse their whole seede,\r\nwhich must infallibly be without either Oates or any weede whatsoeuer:\r\nand although some grounds, especially your richest blacke clayes, will\r\nout of the abundance of their fruitfulnesse (as not induring to be Idle)\r\nbring forth naturally a certaine kinde of wilde Oates, which makes some\r\nignorant Husbands lesse carefull of their seede, as supposing that those\r\nwilde ones are a poisoning to their graine, but they are infinetly\r\ndeceiued: for such wilde Oates, wheresoeuer they be, doe shake and fall\r\naway long before the Barly be ready, so that the Husbandman doth carry\r\nof them nothing into the Barne, but the straw onely. Next Oates, you\r\nmust be carefull that there be in your Barly no other foule weede: for\r\nwhatsoeuer you sow, you must looke for the increase of the like nature,\r\nand therefore as before I said in the Wheate, so in the Barly, I would\r\nwish euery good Husband to imploy some time in gleaning out of his Mow\r\nthe principall eares of Barly, which being batted, drest, and sowne, by\r\nit selfe, albeit no great quantitie at the first, yet in time it may\r\nextend to make his whole seede perfect, and then hee shall finde his\r\nprofit both in the market, where hee shall (for euery vse) sell with the\r\ndeerest, and in his owne house where he shall finde his yeeld redoubled.\r\n\r\nNow for fitting of seuerall seedes to seuerall soyles, you shall\r\nobserue, that the best seede-Barly for your clay field, is ninam Barly,\r\nsowne vpon the clay field, that is to say, Barly which is sowne where\r\nBarly last grew, or a second crop of Barly: for the ground hauing his\r\npride abated in the first croppe, the second, though it be nothing neere\r\nso much in quantitie, yet that Corne which it doth bring forth is most\r\npure, most white, most full, and the best of all seedes whatsoeuer, and\r\nas in case of this soyle, so in all other like soyles which doe hould\r\nthat strength or fruitfulnesse in them that they are either able of\r\nthemselues, or with some helpe of Manure in the latter end of the yeere,\r\nto bring forth two croppes of Barly, one after the other: but if either\r\nyour soyle deny you this strength, or the distance of place bereaue you\r\nof the commoditie thereof, then you shall vnderstand that Barly from a\r\nhasell ground is the best seede, for the clay ground, and Barly from the\r\nclay ground is the best seede, not onely for the hasell earth, but euen\r\nfor all mixt earths whatsoeuer, and the Barly which proceedes from the\r\nmixt earths is the best seede for all simple and vncompounded sands or\r\ngrauells, as wee finde, both by their increasings and dayly experience.\r\n\r\n{SN: The choise of seede-Beanes, Pease, and Pulse.}\r\nNow for the choise of seede-Beanes, Pease, or other Pulse, the scruple\r\nis nothing neere so great as of other seedes, because euery one that\r\nknowes any graine, can distinguish them when hee sees them: besides they\r\nare of that massie waight, and so well able to indure the strength of\r\nthe winde, that they are easie to be seuered from any weede or filth\r\nwhatsoeuer: it resteth therefore that I onely giue you instruction how\r\nto imploy them.\r\n\r\nYou shall vnderstand therefore, that if your soyle be a stiffe, blacke,\r\nrich, clay, that then your best seede is cleane Beanes, or at the least\r\nthree partes Beanes, and but one part Pease: if it be a gray, or white\r\nclay, then Beanes and Pease equally mixt together: if the best mixt\r\nearths, as a blacke clay and red sand, blacke clay and white sand, or\r\nwhite clay and red sand, then your seede must be cleane Pease onely: if\r\nit be white clay and white sand, blacke clay and blacke sand, then your\r\nseede must be Pease and Fitches mixt together: but if it be grauell or\r\nsand simple, or grauell and sand compounded, then your seede must be\r\neither cleane Fitches, cleane Bucke, or cleane Tares, or else Fitches,\r\nBucke and Tares mixt together.\r\n\r\n{SN: The choise of seede-Oates.}\r\nNow to conclude with the choise of your Oates. You shall vnderstand that\r\nthere be diuers kindes of them, as namely, the great long white Oate,\r\nthe great long blacke Oate, the cut Oate, and the skegge: the two first\r\nof these are knowne by their greatnesse and colours, for they are long,\r\nfull, bigge, and smooth, and are fittest to be sowne vpon the best of\r\nbarraine grounds, for sith Oates are the worst of graine, I will giue\r\nthem no other prioritie of place. The next of these, which is the cut\r\nOate, it is of a pale yealow colour, short, smooth, and thicke, the\r\nincrease of them is very great, and they are the fittest to be sowne\r\nvpon the worst of best grounds, for most commonly where you see them,\r\nyou shall also see both good Wheate, good Barly, and good Beanes and\r\nPease also. Now for the skegge Oate, it is a little, small, hungry,\r\nleane Oate, with a beard at the small end like a wilde Oate, and is good\r\nfor small vse more then Pullen onely: it is a seede meete for the\r\nbarrainest and worst earth, as fit to grow but there where nothing of\r\nbetter profit will grow. And thus much for those seedes which are apt\r\nand in vse in our English soyles: wherein if any man imagine me guiltie\r\nof errour, in that I haue omitted particularly to speake of the seede of\r\nblend-Corne, or Masline, which is Wheate and Rye mixt together, I\r\nanswere him, that sith I haue shewed him how to chuse both the best\r\nWheate and the best Rye, it is an easie matter to mixe them according to\r\nhis owne discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of the time of Haruest and the gathering in of Corne._\r\n\r\n\r\n{SN: The getting in of Masline.}\r\n{SN: The getting in of Wheate.}\r\nNext vnto plowing, it is necessary that I place Reaping, sith it is the\r\nend, hope, and perfection of the labour, and both the merit and\r\nincouragement which maketh the toyle both light and portable: then to\r\nproceede vnto the time of Haruest. You shall vnderstand that it is\r\nrequisite for euery good Husband about the latter end of Iuly, if the\r\nsoyle wherein he liueth be of any hot temper, or about the beginning of\r\nAugust, if it be of temperate warmth, with all dilligence constantly to\r\nbeholde his Rye, which of all graines is the first that ripeneth, and if\r\nhe shall perceiue that the hull of the eare beginneth to open, and that\r\nthe blacke toppes of the Corne doth appeare, he may then be assured that\r\nthe Corne is fully ripe, and ready for the Sickle, so that instantly he\r\nshall prouide his Reapers, according to the quantitie of his graine: for\r\nif hee shall neglect his Rye but one day more then is fit, it is such a\r\nhasty graine, that it will shale forth of the huske to the ground, to\r\nthe great losse of the Husbandman. When hee hath prouided his shearers,\r\nwhich he shall be carefull to haue very good, he shall then looke that\r\nneither out of their wantonnesse nor emulation, they striue which shall\r\ngoe fastest, or ridd most ground, for from thence proceedeth many errors\r\nin their worke, as namely, scattering, and leauing the Corne vncut\r\nbehind them, the cutting the heads of the Corne off so that they are not\r\npossible to be gathered, and many such like incommodities, but let them\r\ngoe soberly and constantly, and sheare the Rye at least fourteene inches\r\naboue the ground. Then he must looke that the gatherers which follow the\r\nReapers doe also gather cleane, & the binders binde the Sheafes fast\r\nfrom breaking, then if you finde that the bottomes of the Sheafes be\r\nfull of greenes, or weedes, it shall not be amisse to let the Sheafes\r\nlye one from another for a day, that those greenes may wither, but if\r\nyou feare any Raine or foule weather, which is the onely thing which\r\nmaketh Rye shale, then you shall set it vp in Shockes, each Shocke\r\ncontaining at least seauen Sheafes, in this manner: first, you shall\r\nplace foure Sheafes vpright close together, and the eares vpwards, then\r\nyou shall take other three Sheafes and opening them and turning the\r\neares downeward couer the other foure Sheafes that stoode vpwards, and\r\nso let them stand, vntill you may with good conueniencie lead them home,\r\nwhich would be done without any protraction. Next after your cleane Rye,\r\nyou shall in the selfe-same sort reape your blend-Corne, or Masline: and\r\nalbeit your Wheate will not be fully so ripe as your Rye, yet you shall\r\nnot stay your labour, being well assured that your Rye is ready, because\r\nWheate will harden of it selfe after it is shorne, with lying onely.\r\nAfter you haue got in your Rye and blend-Corne, you shall then looke\r\nvnto your cleane Wheate, and taking heare and there an eare thereof,\r\nrubbe them in your hand, and if you finde that the Corne hath all\r\nperfection saue a little hardning onely, you shall then forthwith set\r\nyour Reapers vnto it, who shall sheare it in all things as they did\r\nsheare your Rye, onely they shall not put it in Shockes for a day or\r\nmore, but let the Sheafes lye single, that the winde and Sunne may both\r\nwither the greenes, and harden the Corne: which done, you shall put the\r\nSheafes into great Shockes, that is to say, at least twelue or\r\nfoureteene Sheafes in a Shocke, the one halfe standing close together\r\nwith the eares vpward, the other halfe lying crosse ouerthwart those\r\neares, and their eares downeward, and in this sort you shall let your\r\nWheate stand for at least two dayes before you lead it.\r\n\r\nNow it is a custome in many Countries of this kingdome, not to sheare\r\ntheir Wheate, but to mow it, but in my conceit and in generall\r\nexperience, it is not so good: for it both maketh the Wheate foule, and\r\nfull of weede, and filleth vp a great place with little commoditie, as\r\nfor the vse of thacking, which is the onely reason of such disorderly\r\ncutting, there is neither the straw that is shorne, nor the stubble\r\nwhich is left behinde, but are both of sufficiencie inough for such an\r\nimployment, if it passe through the hands of a workman, as we see in\r\ndayly experience.\r\n\r\n{SN: The getting in of Barly.}\r\nNext to your Wheate, you shall haue regard to your Barly, for it\r\nsodainely ripeneth, and must be cut downe assoone as you perceiue the\r\nstraw is turned white, to the bottome, and the eares bended downe to the\r\ngroundward. Your Barly you shall not sheare, although it is a fashion in\r\nsome Country, both because it is painefull and profitlesse, but you\r\nshall Mowe it close to the ground, and although in generall it be the\r\ncustome of our kingdome, after your Barly is mowen and hath lyne a day\r\nor two in swathe, then with rackes to racke it together, and make it\r\ninto great cockes, and so to leade it to the Barne, yet I am of this\r\nopinion that if your Barly be good and cleane without thistles or\r\nweedes, that if then to euery sitheman, or Mower you alot two followers,\r\nthat is to say, a gatherer, who with a little short rake and a small\r\nhooke shall gather the Corne together, and a binder, who shall make\r\nbands and binde vp the Barly in smale Sheafes, that questionlesse you\r\nshall finde much more profit thereby: and although some thinke the\r\nlabour troublesome and great, yet for mine owne part, I haue seene very\r\ngreat croppes inned in this manner, and haue seene two women, that with\r\ngreat ease, haue followed and bound after a most principall Mower, which\r\nmade me vnderstand that the toyle was not so great as mine imagination;\r\nand the profit ten-fold greater then the labour: but if your Corne be\r\nill Husbanded, and full of thistles, weedes, and all filthinesse, then\r\nthis practise is to be spared, and the loose cocking vp of your Corne is\r\nmuch better. Assoone as you haue cleansed any Land of Barly, you shall\r\nthen immediatly cause one with a great long rake, of at least thirtie\r\nteeth, being in a sling bound bauticke-wise crosse his body, to draw it\r\nfrom one end of the Land to the other, all ouer the Land, that he may\r\nthereby gather vp all the loose Corne which is scattered, and carry it\r\nwhere your other Corne standeth, obseruing euer, as your cheifest rule,\r\nthat by no meanes you neither leade Barly, nor any other graine\r\nwhatsoeuer, when it is wet, no although it be but moistned with the dew\r\nonely: for the least dankishnesse, more then the sweate which it\r\nnaturally taketh, will soone cause it to putrifie.\r\n\r\n{SN: The getting in of Oates.}\r\nNow for the gathering in of your Oates, they be a graine of such\r\nincertaintie, ripening euer according to the weather, & not after any\r\nsetled or naturall course, that you are to looke to no constant season,\r\nbut to take them vpon the first show of ripenesse, and that with such\r\ndiligence that you must rather take them before, then after they be\r\nripe, because if they tarry but halfe a day too long, they will shed\r\nvpon the ground, & you shal loose your whole profit. The time then\r\nfittest to cut your Oates is, assoone as they be somewhat more then\r\nhalfe changed, but not altogether changed, that is, when they are more\r\nthen two parts white, and yet the greene not vtterly extinguished, the\r\nbest cutting of them is to mow them (albeit I haue seene them shorne in\r\nsome places) & being mowen to let them dry and ripen in the swathe, as\r\nnaturally they will doe, and then if you bind them vp in Sheafes, as you\r\nshould binde your Barly, it is best: for to carry them in the loose\r\ncocke, as many doe, is great losse and hindrance of profit.\r\n\r\n{SN: The getting in of Pulse.}\r\nAfter you haue got in your white Corne, you shall then looke vnto your\r\nPulse, as Beanes, Pease, Fitches, and such like, which you shall know to\r\nbe ready by the blacknesse of the straw: for it is a rule, whensoeuer\r\nthe straw turnes, the Pulse is ripe. If then it be cleane Beanes, or\r\nBeanes and Pease mixt, you shall mowe them, and being cleane Beanes rake\r\nthem into heapes, and so make them vp into cockes, but if they be mixt\r\nyou shall with hookes fould the Beanes into the Pease, and make little\r\nround reapes thereof, which after they haue beene turned and dryed, you\r\nmay put twenty reapes together, and thereof make a cocke, and so lead\r\nthem, and stacke them: but if they be cleane Pease, or Pease and\r\nFitches, then you shall not mowe them, but with long hookes cut them\r\nfrom the ground, which is called Reaping, and so foulding them together\r\ninto small reapes, as you did your Pease and Beanes, let them be turned\r\nand dryed, and so cocked, and carried either to the Barne, stacke, or\r\nhouell.\r\n\r\nNow hauing thus brought in, and finished your Haruest, you shall then\r\nimmediately mowe vp the stubble, both of your Wheate, Rye, and Masline,\r\nand with all expedition there-with thacke, and couer from Raine and\r\nweather, all such graine as for want of house-roome, you are compeld to\r\nlay abroad, either in stacke, or vpon houell: but if no such necessitie\r\nbe, and that you haue not other more necessary imployment for your\r\nstubble, it shall be no part of ill Husbandry to let the stubble rot\r\nvpon the Land, which will be a reasonable Manuring or fatting of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nNow hauing brought your Corne into the Barne, it is a lesson needlesse\r\nto giue any certaine rules how to spend or vtter it forth, sith euery\r\nman must be ruled according to his affaires, and necessitie, yet sith in\r\nmine owne experience I haue taken certaine setled rules from those who\r\nhaue made themselues great estates by a most formall and strickt course\r\nin their Husbandry, I thinke it not amisse to show you what I haue noted\r\nfrom them, touching the vtterance and expence of their graine: first,\r\nfor your expence in your house, it is meete that you haue euer so much\r\nof euery seuerall sort of graine thresht, as shall from time to time\r\nmaintaine your family: then for that which you intend shall returne to\r\nparticular profit, you shall from a fortnight before Michaelmas, till a\r\nfortnight after, thresh vp all such Wheate, Rye, & Masline, as you\r\nintend to sell for seede, which must be winnowed, fand, and drest so\r\ncleane as is possible, for at that time it will giue the greatest price;\r\nbut as soone as seede-time is past, you shall then thresh no more of\r\nthose graines till it be neare Midsummer, but begin to thresh vp all\r\nsuch Barly as you intend to conuert and make into Malt, and so from\r\nMichaelmas till Candlemas, apply nothing but Malting, for in that time\r\ngraine is euer the cheapest, because euery Barne being full, some must\r\nsell for the payment of rents, some must sell to pay seruants wages, and\r\nsome for their Christmas prouisions: in which time Corne abating and\r\ngrowing scarse, the price of necessitie must afterwards rise: at\r\nCandlemas you shall begin to thresh all those Pease which you intend to\r\nsell for seede, because the time being then, and euery man, out of\r\nnecessitie, inforced to make his prouision, it cannot be but they must\r\nneedes passe at a good price and reckoning.\r\n\r\nAfter Pease seede-time, you shall then thresh vp all that Barly which\r\nyou meane to sell for seede, which euer is at the dearest reckoning of\r\nany graine whatsoeuer, especially if it be principally good and cleane.\r\nAfter your seede-Barly is sould, you may then thresh vp all such Wheate,\r\nRye, and Masline, as you intend to sell: for it euer giueth the greatest\r\nprice from the latter end of May vntill the beginning of September. In\r\nSeptember you shall begin to sell your Malt, which being old and hauing\r\nlyne ripening the most part of the yeere, must now at the latter end of\r\nthe yeere, when all old store is spent, and the new cannot be come to\r\nany perfection, be most deare, and of the greatest estimation: and thus\r\nbeing a man of substance in the world, and able to put euery thing to\r\nthe best vse, you may by these vsuall obseruations, and the helpe of a\r\nbetter iudgement, imploy the fruits of your labours to the best profit,\r\nand sell euery thing at the highest price, except you take vpon you to\r\ngiue day and sell vpon trust, which if you doe, you may then sell at\r\nwhat vnconscionable reckoning you will, which because such vnnaturall\r\nexactions neither agree with charitie, nor humanitie, I will forbeare to\r\ngiue rules for the same, and referre euery man that is desirous of such\r\nknowledge, to the examples of the world, wherein he shall finde\r\npresidents inough for such euill customes. And thus much for the first\r\npart of this worke, which containeth the manner of Plowing and tillage\r\nonely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE SECOND PART\r\n  OF THE FIRST BOOKE OF\r\n  the English Husbandman,\r\n  Contayning the Art of Planting, Grafting and Gardening, either for\r\n  pleasure or profit; together with the vse and ordering of Woodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. I.\r\n\r\n_Of the Scyte, Modell, Squares, and Fashion of a perfect Orchard._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough many authors which I haue read, both in Italian, French, and\r\nDutch, doe make a diuersitie and distinguishment of Orchardes, as\r\nnamely, one for profit, which they fashion rudely and without forme, the\r\nother for delight, which they make comely, decent, and with all good\r\nproportion, deuiding the quarters into squares, making the alleyes of a\r\nconstant breadth, and planting the fruit-trees in arteficiall rowes: yet\r\nfor as much as the comelinesse and well contriuing of the ground, doth\r\nnothing abate, but rather increase the commoditie, I will therefore\r\nioyne them both together, and make them onely but one Orchard. Now for\r\nthe scyte and placing of this Orchard, I haue in the modell of my\r\nCountry house, or Husbandmans Farme, shewed you where if it be possible\r\nit should stand, and both what Sunne & ayre it should lye open vpon: but\r\nif the scyte or ground-plot of your house will not giue you leaue to\r\nplace your Orchard according to your wish, you shall then be content to\r\nmake a vertue of necessitie, and plant it in such a place as is most\r\nconuenient, and nearest alyed to that forme before prescribed.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nNow when you haue found out a perfect ground-plot, you shall then cast\r\nit into a great large square, which you shall fence in either with a\r\nstone or bricke wall, high, strong pale, or great ditch with a\r\nquicke-set hedge, but the wall is best and most durable, and that wall\r\nwould haue vpon the inside within twelue or fourteene foote on of\r\nanother, Iames or outshoots of stone or bricke, betweene which you may\r\nplant and plash those fruit-trees which are of greatest tendernesse, the\r\nSouth and West Sunne hauing power to shine vpon them.\r\n\r\nWhen you haue thus fenc'st in this great square, you shall then cast\r\nfoure large alleyes, at least fourteene foote broad, from the wall round\r\nabout, and so likewise two other alleyes of like breadth, directly\r\ncrosse ouerthwart the ground-plot, which will deuide the great square\r\ninto foure lesser squares, according to the figure before set downe.\r\n\r\nThe figure 1. sheweth the alleyes which both compasse about, and also\r\ncrosse ouer the ground-plot, and the figure 2. sheweth the foure\r\nquarters where the fruit-trees are to be planted.\r\n\r\nNow if either the true nature and largnesse of the ground be sufficient,\r\nor your owne abilitie of pursse so great that you may compasse your\r\ndesires in these earthly pleasures, it shall not be amisse, but a matter\r\nof great state, to make your ground-plot full as bigge againe, that is\r\nto say, to containe eight large quarters, the first foure being made of\r\nan euen leuell, the other foure being raysed at least eight foote higher\r\nthen the first, with conuenient stayres of state for ascending to the\r\nsame, to be likewise vpon another euen leuell of like forme, and if in\r\nthe center of the alleyes, being the mid-point betweene the squares,\r\nmight be placed any quaint fountaines or any other antique standard, the\r\nplatforme would be more excellent and if vpon the ascent from one leuell\r\nto another there might be built some curious and arteficiall banquetting\r\nhouse, it would giue luster to the Orchard.\r\n\r\nNow for the planting and furnishing of these quarters: you shall\r\nvnderstand that if your Orchard containe but foure quarters, then the\r\nfirst shalbe planted with Apple-trees of all sorts, the second with\r\nPeares and Wardens of all sorts, the third with Quinces & Chesnutes, the\r\nfourth with Medlars & seruices. Against the North side of your Orchard\r\nwall against which the South sunne reflects, you shall plant the\r\nAbricot, Verdochio, Peach, and Damaske-plumbe: against the East side of\r\nthe wall, the whit Muskadine Grape, the Pescod-plumbe, and the\r\nEmperiall-plumbe: against the West side the grafted Cherries, and the\r\nOliue-tree: and against the South side the Almond, & Figge tree. Round\r\nabout the skirts of euery other outward or inward alley, you shall\r\nplant, the Wheate-plumbe, both yealow & redde, the Rye-plumbe, the\r\nDamson, the Horse-clog, Bulleys of all kindes, ordinary french Cherryes,\r\nFilberts, and Nuts of all sorts, together with the Prune-plumbe, and\r\nother such like stone fruits. But if your Orchard be of state and\r\nprospect, so that it containe eight quarters or more (according to the\r\nlimitation of the earth) then you shall in euery seuerall quarter plant\r\na seuerall fruit, as Apple-trees in one quarter, Peares in another,\r\nQuinces in another, Wardens in another, and so forth of the rest. Also\r\nyou shall obserue in planting your Apples, Peares, and Plumbes, that you\r\nplant your summer or early fruit by themselues, and the Winter or long\r\nlasting fruit by themselues. Of Apples, your Ienitings, Wibourns,\r\nPomederoy, and Queene-Apples are reckoned the best earely fruits,\r\nalthough their be diuers others, and the Pippin, Peare-maine,\r\nApple-Iohn, and Russetting, your best Winter and long lasting fruit,\r\nthough there be a world of other: for the tastes of Apples are infinite,\r\naccording to there composition and mixture in grafting. Of Peares your\r\ngolden Peare, your Katherine-Peare, your Lording, and such like, are the\r\nfirst, and your stone-Peare, Warden-Peare, and choake-Peare, those which\r\nindure longest. And of Plumbes the rye-plumbe is first, your\r\nWheate-plumbe next, and all the other sorts of plumbes ripen all most\r\ntogether in one season, if they haue equall warmth, and be all of like\r\ncomfortable standing.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nNow for the orderly placing of your trees, you shall vnderstand that\r\nyour Plumbe-trees (which are as it were a fence or guard about your\r\ngreat quarters) would be placed in rowes one by one, aboue fiue foote\r\ndistance one from another, round about each skirt of euery alley: your\r\nApple-trees & other greater fruit which are to be planted in the\r\nquarters, would be placed in such arteficiall rowes that which way\r\nsoeuer a man shall cast his eyes yet hee shall see the trees euery way\r\nstand in rowes, making squares, alleyes, and deuisions, according to a\r\nmans imagination, according to the figure before, which I would haue\r\nyou suppose to be one quarter in an Orchard, and by it you may easily\r\ncompound the rest: wherein you shall vnderstand that the lesser prickes\r\ndoe figure your Plumbe-trees, & the greater prickes your Apple trees,\r\nand such other large fruit.\r\n\r\nNow you shall vnderstand that euery one of these great trees which\r\nfurnish the maine quarter, shall stand in a direct line, iust twelue\r\nfoote one from another, which is a space altogether sufficient inough\r\nfor there spreading, without waterdropping or annoying one another;\r\nprouided that the Fruiterer, according to his duty, be carefull to\r\npreserue the trees vpright and to vnderprope them when by the violence\r\nof the winde they shall swarue any way. Vpon the ascent or rising from\r\none leuell to another, you may plant the Barberry-trees, Feberries, and\r\nRaspberries, of all sorts, which being spreading, thorny and sharpe\r\ntrees, take great delight to grow thicke and close together, by which\r\nmeanes often times they make a kinde of wall, hedge, or fencing, where\r\nthey stand.\r\n\r\nHauing thus shewed you the ground-plot and proportion of your Orchard,\r\nwith the seuerall deuisions, ascents, and squares, that should be\r\ncontained therein, and the fruits which are to furnish euery such square\r\nand deuision, and their orderly placing, it now rests that you\r\nvnderstand that this Orchard-plot, so neare as you can bring it to\r\npasse, doe stand most open and plaine, vpon the South and West sunne,\r\nand most defended from the East and North windes and bitternesse, which\r\nbeing obserued your plot is then perfect and absolute.\r\n\r\nNow forasmuch as where nature, fruitfulnesse, and situation doe take\r\nfrom a man more then the halfe part of his industrie, and by a direct\r\nand easie way doth lead him to that perfection which others cannot\r\nattaine to without infinit labour and trauell: and whereas it is nothing\r\nso commendable to maintaine beautie, as to make deformitie beautifull, I\r\nwill speake something of the framing of Orchard-plots there where both\r\nnature, the situation, and barrainnesse, doe vtterly deny the enioying\r\nof any such commoditie, as where the ground is vneuen, stonie, sandy, or\r\nin his lownesse subiect to the ouerflow of waters, all being apparant\r\nenemies to these places of pleasure and delight. First, for the\r\nvneuennesse of the ground, if that be his vttermost imperfection, you\r\nshall first not onely take a note with your eye, but also place a marke\r\nvpon the best ascent of the ground to which the leuell is fittest to be\r\ndrawne, and then plowing the ground all ouer with a great common plough,\r\nby casting the furrowes downward, seeke to fill in and couer the lesser\r\nhollownesses of the ground, that their may not any thing appeare but the\r\nmaine great hollowes, which with other earth which is free from stones,\r\ngrauell, or such like euils, you shall fill vp and make leuell with that\r\npart where your marke standeth, and being so leuelled, forthwith draw\r\nthe plot of your Orchard: but if the ground be not onely vneuen but also\r\nbarraine, you shall then to euery loade of earth you carry to the\r\nleuelling adde a loade of Manure, either Oxe Manure, or Horse Manure,\r\nthe rubbish of houses, or the clensings of olde ditches, or standing\r\npooles, and the earth will soone become fertill and perfect; but if the\r\nground be stonie, that is, full of great stones, as it is in Darbishire\r\nabout the Peake or East Mores, for small pibbles or small lime-stones\r\nare not very much hurtfull, then you shall cause such stones to be digd\r\nvp, and fill vp the places where they lay either with marle, or other\r\nrich earth, which after it hath beene setled for a yeere or two you\r\nshall then plough, and leuell it, and so frame forth the plot of your\r\nOrchard. If the ground be onely a barraine sand, so that it wanteth\r\nstrength either to maintaine or bring forth, you shall then first digge\r\nthat earth into great trenches, at least foure foote deepe, and filling\r\nthem vp with Oxe Manure, mixe it with the sand, that it may change some\r\npart of the colour thereof and then leuelling it fashion out your\r\nOrchard. But lastly, and which is of all situations the worst, if you\r\nhaue no ground to plant your Orchard vpon, but such as either through\r\nthe neighbourhood of riuers, descent of Mountaines, or the earths owne\r\nnaturall quallitie in casting and vomiting out water and moysture, is\r\nsubiect to some small ouerflowes of water, by which you cannot attaine\r\nto the pleasure you seeke, because fruit-trees can neuer indure the\r\ncorruption of waters, you shall then in the dryest season of the yeere,\r\nafter you haue marked out that square or quantitie of ground which you\r\nintend for your Orchard, you shall then cast therein sundry ditches, at\r\nleast sixteene foote broad, and nine foote deepe, and not aboue twelue\r\nfoote betwixt ditch and ditch, vpon which reserued earth casting the\r\nearth that you digged vp, you shall raise the banckes at least seauen\r\nfoote high of firme earth, and keepe in the top the full breadth of\r\ntwelue foote, with in a foote or little more: and in the casting vp of\r\nthese bankes you shall cause the earth to be beaten with maules and\r\nbroad beetels that it may lye firme, fast, and leuell, and after these\r\nbankes haue rested a yeere or more, and are sufficiently setled, you may\r\nthen at the neather end of the banke, neare to the verge of the water\r\nplant store of Osyers, which will be a good defence to the banke, and\r\nvpon the top and highest part of the banke you shall plant your Orchard\r\nand fruit-trees, so that when any inundation of water shall happen, the\r\nditches shalbe able inough to receiue it; or else making a passage from\r\nyour Orchard into some other sewer, the water exceeding his limits may\r\nhaue a free current or passage: besides these ditches being neatly kept,\r\nand comforted with fresh water, may make both pleasant and commodious\r\nfish-ponds. Also you must be carefull in casting these bankes that you\r\ndoe not place them in such sort that when you are vpon one you cannot\r\ncome to the other, but rather like a maze, so that you may at pleasure\r\npasse from the one to the other round about the ground, making of diuers\r\nbankes to the eye but one banke in substance, and of diuers ponds in\r\nappearance, but one in true iudgement. And thus much for the plot or\r\nsituation of an Orchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\n_Of the Nurserie where you shall set all manner of Kernels, and Stones,\r\nfor the furnishing of the Orchard._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough great persons, out of their greatnesse and abilitie, doe buy\r\ntheir fruit trees ready grafted, and so in a moment may plant an Orchard\r\nof the greatest quantitie, yet sith the Husbandman must raise euery\r\nthing from his owne indeauours, and that I onely write for his profit, I\r\ntherefore hould it most conuenient to beginne with the nursery or\r\nstore-house of fruits, from whence the Orchard receiueth his beauty and\r\nriches.\r\n\r\nThis Nursery must be a piece of principall ground, either through Art or\r\nNature, strongly fenced, warme, and full of good shelter: for in it is\r\nonely the first infancy and tendernesse of fruit-trees, because there\r\nthey are first kernells, or stones, after sprigs, and lastly trees.\r\n\r\nNow for the manner of chusing, sowing, and planting them in this\r\nnursery, I differ some thing from the french practise, who would chuse\r\nthe kernells from the cider presse, sow them in large bedds of earth,\r\nand within a yeere after replant them in a wilde Orchard: now for mine\r\nowne part, though this course be not much faulty, yet I rather chuse\r\nthis kinde of practise, first: to chuse your kernells either of Apples,\r\nPeares, or Wardens, from the best and most principallest fruit you can\r\ntaste, for although the kernell doe bring forth no other tree but the\r\nplaine stocke vpon which the fruit was grafted, as thus, if the graft\r\nwere put into a Crab-stocke the kernell brings forth onely a Crab-tree,\r\nyet when you taste a perfect and delicate Apple, be assured both the\r\nstocke and graft were of the best choise, and so such kernells of best\r\nreckoning. When you haue then a competent quantitie of such kernells,\r\nyou shall take certaine large pots, in the fashion of milke-boules, all\r\nfull of hoales in the bottome, through which the raine and superfluous\r\nmoysture may auoyde, and either in the Months of March or Nouember (for\r\nthose are the best seasons) fill the pots three parts full of the\r\nfinest, blackest, and richest mould you can get, then lay your kernells\r\nvpon the earth, about foure fingars one from another, so many as the\r\nvessell can conueniently containe, and then with a siue sift vpon them\r\nother fine moulds almost three fingars thicke, and so let them rest,\r\nfilling so many pots or vessells as shall serue to receiue your\r\nquantitie of kernells of all sorts. Now if any man desire to know my\r\nreason why I rather desire to set my kernells rather in vessells then in\r\nbeds of earth, my answere is, that I haue often found it in mine\r\nexperience, that the kernell of Apples, Peares, Quinces, and such like,\r\nare such a tender and dainty seede that it is great oddes but the wormes\r\nwill deuoure and consume them before they sprout, who naturally delight\r\nin such seedes, which these vessels onely doe preuent: but to proceede.\r\n\r\nAfter your kernells are sprouted vp and growne to be at least seauen or\r\neight inches high, you shall then within your nursery digge vp a border\r\nabout two foote and an halfe broad, more then a foote deepe, and of such\r\nconuenient length as may receiue all your young plants, and hauing made\r\nthe mould fine and rich with Manure, you shall then with your whole hand\r\ngripe as much of the earth that is about the plant as you can\r\nconueniently hould, and so take both the plant and the mould out of the\r\nvessell, and replant it in the new drest border: and you shall thus doe\r\nplant after plant, till you haue set euery one, and made them firme and\r\nfast in the new mould: wherein you are to obserue these two principles,\r\nfirst that you place them at least fiue foote one from another, and\r\nsecondly, that such kernells as you set in your vessels in March, that\r\nyou replant them in borders of earth in Nouember following, and such as\r\nyou set in Nouember to replant in March following, and being so\r\nreplanted to suffer them to grow till they be able to beare grafts,\r\nduring which time you shall diligently obserue, that if any of them\r\nchance to put forth any superfluous branches or cyons, which may hinder\r\nthe growth of the body of the plant, that you carefully cut them away,\r\nthat thereby it may be the sooner inabled to beare a graft: for it is\r\neuer to be intended that whatsoeuer proceedeth from kernells are onely\r\nto be preserued for stockes to graft on, and for no other purpose.\r\n\r\nNow for the stones of Plumbes, & other stone fruit, you shall vnderstand\r\nthat they be of two kindes, one simple and of themselues, as the\r\nRye-plumbe, Wheate-plumbe, Damson, Prune-plumbe, Horse-clogge, Cherry,\r\nand such like, so that from the kernells of them issueth trees of like\r\nnature and goodnesse: the other compounded or grafted plumbes, as the\r\nAbricot, Pescod, Peach, Damaske, Verdochyo, Emperiall, and such like,\r\nfrom whose kernells issueth no other trees but such as the stockes were\r\nvpon which they were grafted. Now, for the manner of setting the first,\r\nwhich are simple and vncompounded, you shall digge vp a large bedde of\r\nrich and good earth a month or more before March or Nouember, and hauing\r\nmade the mould as fine as is possible, you shall flat-wise thrust euery\r\nstone, a foote one from another, more then three fingars into the mould,\r\nand then with a little small rake, made for the purpose, rake the bedde\r\nouer and close vp the holes, and so let them rest till they be of a\r\nyeeres groath, at which time you shall replant them into seuerall\r\nborders, as you did your Apple-tree plants and others.\r\n\r\nNow for the kernells of your compounded or grafted Plumbes, you shall\r\nboth set them in beddes and replant them into seuerall borders, in the\r\nsame manner as you did the other kernells of Plumbes, onely you shall\r\nfor the space of eight and forty houres before you set them steepe them\r\nin new milke, forasmuch as the stones of them are more hard, and with\r\ngreater difficulty open and sprout in the earth, then any other stone\r\nwhatsoeuer: and thus hauing furnished your Nursery of all sorts of\r\nfruits and stockes, you shall when they come to full age and bignesse\r\ngraft them in such order as shalbe hereafter declared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\n_Of the setting or planting of the Cyons or Branches of most sorts of\r\nFruit-trees._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you are to furnish your nursery with all sorts of kernells and\r\nstones, for the breeding of stockes where on to graft the daintiest\r\nfruits you can compasse, so shall you also plant therein the cyons and\r\nbranches of the best fruit trees: which cyons and branches doe bring\r\nforthe the same fruit which the trees doe from whence they are taken,\r\nand by that meanes your nursery shall euer afford you perfect trees,\r\nwherewith either to furnish your owne grounds, or to pleasure your\r\nneighbours. And herein by the way you shall vnderstand that some trees\r\nare more fit to be set then to be sowne, as namely, the Seruice-tree,\r\nthe Medler, the Filbert and such like. Now for the Seruice-tree, hee is\r\nnot at all to be grafted, but set in this wise: take of the bastard\r\ncyons such as be somewhat bigger then a mans thumbe, and cutting away\r\nthe branches thereof, set it in a fine loose moulde, at least a foote\r\ndeepe, and it will prosper exceedingly, yet the true nature of this tree\r\nis not to be remoued, and therefore it is conuenient that it be planted\r\nwhere it should euer continue: in like manner to the Seruice-tree, so\r\nyou shall plant the bastard cyons of the Medlar-tree either in March or\r\nOctober, and at the waine of the moone.\r\n\r\nNow for the Filbert, or large Hassell-nut, you shall take the smallest\r\ncyons or wands, such as are not aboue two yeeres groath, being full of\r\nshort heauie twigges, and grow from the roote of the maine tree, and set\r\nthem in a loose mould, a foote deepe, without pruning or cutting away\r\nany of the branches, and they will prosper to your contentment. Now for\r\nall sorts of Plumbe-trees, Apple-trees or other fruit-trees which are\r\nnot grafted, if you take the young cyons which grow from the rootes\r\ncleane from the rootes, and plant them either in the spring, or fall, in\r\na fresh and fine mould, they will not onely prosper, but bring forth\r\nfruit of like nature and qualitie to the trees from whence they were\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nNow for your grafted fruit, as namely, Apples, Plumbes, Cherryes,\r\nMulberries, Quinces, and such like, the cyons also and branches of them\r\nalso will take roote and bring forth fruit of the same kinde that the\r\ntrees did from whence they were taken: but those cyons or branches must\r\neuer be chosen from the vpper parts of the trees, betwixt the feast of\r\nall-Saints and Christmas, they must be bigger then a mans finger,\r\nsmooth, straight, and without twigges: you shall with a sharpe chissell\r\ncut them from the body or armes of the tree with such care, that by no\r\nmeanes you raise vp the barke, and then with a little yealow waxe couer\r\nthe place from whence you cut the cyon: then hauing digged and dunged\r\nthe earth well where you intend to plant them, and made the mould easie,\r\nyou shall with an Iron, as bigge as your plant, make a hoale a foote\r\ndeepe or better, and then put in your cyon and with it a few Oates, long\r\nsteept in water, and so fixe it firme in the mould, and if after it\r\nbeginneth to put forth you perceiue any young cyons to put forth from\r\nthe root thereof, you shall immediatly cut them off, & either cast them\r\naway or plant them in other places, for to suffer them to grow may\r\nbreede much hurt to the young trees. Now where as these cyons thus\r\nplanted are for the most part small and weake, so that the smallest\r\nbreath of winde doth shake and hurt their rootes, it shalbe good to\r\npricke strong stakes by them, to which, fastning the young plant with a\r\nsoft hay rope it may the better be defended from stormes and tempests.\r\n\r\nNext to these fruit-trees, you shall vnderstand that your bush-trees,\r\nas Barberryes, Gooseberryes, or Feberryes, Raspberryes, and such like,\r\nwill also grow vpon cyons, without rootes, being cut from their maine\r\nrootes in Nouember, & so planted in a new fresh mould. And here by the\r\nway I am to giue you this note or caueat, that if at any time you finde\r\nany of these cyons which you haue planted not to grow and flourish\r\naccording to your desire, but that you finde a certaine mislike or\r\nconsumption in the plant, you shall then immediatly with a sharpe knife\r\ncut the plant off slope-wise vpward, about three fingars from the\r\nground, and so let it rest till the next spring, at which time you shall\r\nbeholde new cyons issue from the roote, which will be without sicknesse\r\nor imperfection; and from the vertue of this experiment I imagine the\r\ngardners of antient time found out the meanes to get young cyons from\r\nolde Mulberry-trees, which they doe in this manner: first, you must take\r\nsome of the greatest armes of the Mulberry-tree about the midst of\r\nNouember, and with a sharpe sawe to sawe them into bigge truncheons,\r\nabout fiueteene inches long, and then digging a trench in principall\r\ngood earth, of such depth that you may couer the truncheons, being set\r\nvp on end, with Manure and fine mould, each truncheon being a foote one\r\nfrom another, and couerd more then foure fingars aboue the wood, not\r\nfayling to water them whensoeuer neede shall require, and to preserue\r\nthem from weeds and filthinesse, within lesse then a yeeres space you\r\nshall behold those truncheons to put forth young cyons, which as soone\r\nas they come to any groath and be twigged, then you may cut them from\r\nthe stockes, and transplant them where you please, onely the truncheons\r\nyou shall suffer to remaine still, and cherish them with fresh dunge,\r\nand they will put forth many moe cyons, both to furnish your selfe and\r\nyour friends. And thus much for the planting and setting of cyons or\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IIII.\r\n\r\n_Of the ordinary and accustomed manner of Grafting all sorts of\r\nFruit-trees._\r\n\r\n\r\n{SN: The mixing of Stockes and Grafts.}\r\nAs soone as your nursery is thus amply furnished of all sorts of\r\nstockes, proceeding from kernells and of all sorts of trees proceeding\r\nfrom cyons, branches or vndergrowings, and that through strength of\r\nyeeres they are growne to sufficient abilitie to receiue grafts, which\r\nis to be intended that they must be at the least sixe or eight inches in\r\ncompasse, for although lesse many times both doth and may receiue\r\ngrafts, yet they are full of debilitie and danger, and promise no\r\nassurance to the worke-mans labour, you shall then beginne to graft your\r\nstockes with such fruits as from art and experience are meete to be\r\nconioyned together, as thus: you shall graft Apples vpon Apples, as the\r\nPippin vpon the great Costard, the Peare-maine vpon the Ienetting, and\r\nthe Apple-Iohn or blacke annet vpon the Pomewater or Crab-tree: to\r\nconclude, any Apple-stocke, Crab-tree, or wilding, is good to graft\r\nApples vpon, but the best is best worthy. So for Peares, you shall graft\r\nthem vpon Peare stockes, Quinces vpon Quinces or Crab-trees, and not\r\naccording to the opinion of the frenchman, vpon white thorne or willow,\r\nthe Medlar vpon the Seruice-tree, and the Seruice vpon the Medlar, also\r\nCherryes vpon Cherryes, & Plumbes vpon Plumbes, as the greater Abricots\r\nvpon the lesser Abricots, the Peach, the Figge, or the Damson-tree, and\r\nto speake generally without wasting more paper, or making a long\r\ncircumstance to slender purpose, the Damson-tree is the onely principall\r\nbest stocke whereupon to graft any kinde of Plumbe or stone fruit\r\nwhatsoeuer.\r\n\r\n{SN: The choise of Grafts.}\r\nAfter you haue both your stockes ready, and know which grafts to ioyne\r\nwith which stockes, you shall then learne to cut and chuse your grafts\r\nin this manner: looke from what tree you desire to take your grafts, you\r\nshall goe vnto the very principall branches thereof, and looke vp to the\r\nvpper ends, and those which you finde to be fairest, smoothest, and\r\nfullest of sappe, hauing the little knots, budds, or eyes, standing\r\nclose and thicke together, are the best and most perfect, especially if\r\nthey grow vpon the East side of the tree, whereon the Sunne first\r\nlooketh; these you shall cut from the tree in such sort that they may\r\nhaue at least three fingars of the olde woode ioyning to the young\r\nbranch, which you shall know both by the colour of the barke, as also by\r\na little round seame which maketh as it were a distinction betwixt the\r\nseuerall growths. Now you shall euer, as neere as you can, chuse your\r\ngrafts from a young tree, and not from an olde, and from the tops of the\r\nprincipall branches, and not from the midst of the tree, or any other\r\nsuperfluous arme or cyon; now if after you haue got your grafts you haue\r\nmany dayes Iourneys to carry them, you shall fould them in a few fresh\r\nmouldes, and binde them about with hay, and hay ropes, and so carry them\r\nall day, and in the night bury them all ouer in the ground and they will\r\ncontaine their goodnesse for a long season.\r\n\r\n{SN: How to graft in the Cleft.}\r\nHauing thus prepared your grafts, you shall then beginne to graft, which\r\nworke you shall vnderstand may be done in euery month of the yeere,\r\nexcept Nouember and October, but the best is to beginne about Christmas\r\nfor all earely and forward fruit, and for the other, to stay till March:\r\nnow hauing all your implements and necessaryes about you, fit for the\r\nGrafting, you shall first take your grafts, of what sort soeuer they be,\r\nand hauing cut the neather ends of them round and smoth without raysing\r\nof the barke, you shall then with a sharp knife, made in the proportion\r\nof a great pen-knife slice downe each side of the grafts, from the seame\r\nor knot which parts the olde woode from the new, euen to the neather\r\nend, making it flat and thinne, cheifely in the lowest part, hauing\r\nonely a regardfull eye vnto the pith of the graft, which you may by no\r\nmeanes cut or touch, and when you haue thus trimmed a couple of grafts,\r\nfor moe I doe by no meanes alow vnto one stocke, although sundry other\r\nskilfull workmen in this Art alow to the least stocke two grafts, to the\r\nindifferent great three, and to the greatest of all foure, yet I affirme\r\ntwo are sufficiently inough for any stocke whatsoeuer, and albeit they\r\nare a little the longer in couering the head, yet after they haue\r\ncouered it the tree prospereth more in one yeere then that which\r\ncontayneth foure grafts shall doe in two, because they cannot haue sap\r\ninough to maintaine them, which is the reason that trees for want of\r\nprosperitie grow crooked and deformed: but to my purpose. When you haue\r\nmade your grafts ready, you shall then take a fine thinne sawe, whose\r\nteeth shalbe filed sharpe and euen, and with it (if the stocke be\r\nexceeding small) cut the stocke round off within lesse then a foote of\r\nthe ground, but if the stocke be as bigge as a mans arme, then you may\r\ncut it off two or three foote from the ground, and so consequently the\r\nbigger it is the higher you may cut it, and the lesser the nearer vnto\r\nthe earth: as soone as you haue sawne off the vpper part of the stocke,\r\nyou shall then take a fine sharpe chissell, somewhat broader then the\r\nstocke, and setting it euen vpon the midst of the head of the stocke\r\nsomewhat wide of the pith, then with a mallet of woode you shall stricke\r\nit in and cleaue the stocke, at least foure inches deepe, then putting\r\nin a fine little wedge of Iron, which may keepe open the cleft, you\r\nshall take one of your grafts and looke which side of it you intend to\r\nplace inward, and that side you shall cut much thinner then the out\r\nside, with a most heedfull circumspection that by no meanes you loosen\r\nor rayse vp the barke of the graft, cheifly on the out side, then you\r\nshall take the graft, and wetting it in your mouth place it in one side\r\nof the cleft of the stocke, and regard that the very knot or seame which\r\ngoes about the graft, parting the olde woode from the new, do rest\r\ndirectly vpon the head of the stocke, and that the out side of the\r\ngraft doe agree directly with the out side of the stocke, ioyning barke\r\nvnto barke, and sappe vnto sappe, so euen, so smooth, and so close, that\r\nno ioyners worke may be discerned to ioyne more arteficially: which\r\ndone, vpon the other side of the stocke, in the other cleft, you shall\r\nplace your other graft, with full as much care, diligence, and euery\r\nother obseruation: when both your grafts are thus orderly and\r\narteficially placed, you shall then by setting the haft of your chissell\r\nagainst the stocke, with all lenitie and gentlenesse, draw forth your\r\nwedge, in such sort that you doe not displace or alter your grafts, and\r\nwhen your wedge is forth you shall then looke vpon your grafts, and if\r\nyou perceiue that the stocke doe pinch or squize them, which you may\r\ndiscerne both by the straitnesse and bending of the outmost barke, you\r\nshall then make a little wedge of some greene sappy woode, and driuing\r\nit into the cleft, ease your grafts, cutting that wedge close to the\r\nstocke. When you haue thus made both your grafts perfect, you shall then\r\ntake the barke of either Apple-tree, Crab-tree or Willow-tree, and with\r\nthat barke couer the head of the stocke so close that no wet or other\r\nannoyance may get betwixt it and the stocke, then you shall take a\r\nconuenient quantitie of clay, which indeede would be of a binding\r\nmingled earth, and tempering it well, either with mosse or hay, lay it\r\nvpon the barke, and daube all the head of the stocke, euen as low as the\r\nbottome of the grafts, more then an inch thicke, so firme, close, and\r\nsmooth as may be, which done, couer all that clay ouer with soft mosse,\r\nand that mosse with some ragges of wollen cloath, which being gently\r\nbound about with the inward barkes of Willow, or Osyar, let the graft\r\nrest to the pleasure of the highest: and this is called grafting in the\r\ncleft.\r\n\r\n{SN: Notes.}\r\nNow there be certaine obseruations or caueats to be respected in\r\ngrafting, which I may not neglect: as first, in trimming and preparing\r\nyour grafts for the stocke: if the grafts be either of Cherry, or\r\nPlumbe, you shall not cut them so thinne as the grafts of Apples,\r\nQuinces, or Medlars, because they haue a much larger and rounder pith,\r\nwhich by no meanes must be toucht but fortefied and preserued, onely to\r\nthe neather end you may cut them as thinne as is possible, the pith\r\nonely preserued.\r\n\r\nSecondly, you shall into your greatest stockes put your greatest grafts,\r\nand into your least, the least, that there may be an equall strength and\r\nconformitie in their coniunction.\r\n\r\nThirdly, if at any time you be inforced to graft vpon an olde tree, that\r\nis great and large, then you shall not graft into the body of that tree,\r\nbecause it is impossible to keepe it from putrifaction and rotting\r\nbefore the grafts can couer the head, but you shall chuse out some of\r\nthe principall armes or branches, which are much more slender, and graft\r\nthem, as is before shewed, omitting not dayly to cut away all cyons,\r\narmes, branches, or superfluous sprigs which shall grow vnder those\r\nbranches which you haue newly grafted: but if there be no branch, small\r\nor tender inough to graft in, then you shall cut away all the maine\r\nbranches from the stocke, and couering the head with clay and mosse, let\r\nit rest, and within three or foure yeeres it will put forth new cyons,\r\nwhich will be fit to graft vpon.\r\n\r\nFourthly, if when you either sawe off the top of your stocke, or else\r\ncleaue the head, you either raise vp the barke or cleaue the stocke too\r\ndeepe, you shall then sawe the stocke againe, with a little more\r\ncarefulnesse, so much lower as your first errour had committed a fault.\r\n\r\nFiftly, you shall from time to time looke to the binding of the heads of\r\nyour stockes, in so much that if either the clay doe shrinke away or the\r\nother couerings doe losen, by which defects ayre, or wet, may get into\r\nthe incission, you shall presently with all speede amend and repaire it.\r\n\r\nLastly, if you graft in any open place where cattell doe graze, you\r\nshall not then forget as soone as you haue finisht your worke to bush or\r\nhedge in your graft, that it may be defended from any such negligent\r\nannoyance. And thus much for this ordinary manner of grafting, which\r\nalthough it be generall and publike to most men that knoweth any thing\r\nin this art, yet is it not inferiour, but the principallest and surest\r\nof all other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\n_Of diuers other wayes of grafting, their vses and purposes._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough for certainty, vse, and commodity, the manner of grafting\r\nalready prescribed is of sufficiency inough to satisfie any constant or\r\nreasonable vnderstanding, yet for nouelty sake, to which our nation is\r\ninfinitly addicted, and to satisfie the curious, who thinke their\r\niudgements disparaged if they heare any authorised traueller talke of\r\nthe things which they haue not practised, I will proceede to some other\r\nmore quaint manners of grafting, and the rather because they are not\r\naltogether vnnecessary, hauing both certainety in the worke, pleasure in\r\nthe vse, and benefit in the serious imploying of those howers which else\r\nmight challenge the title of idlenesse, besides they are very well\r\nagreeing with the soyles and fruits of this Empyre of great Brittaine\r\nand the vnderstandings of the people, for whose seruice or benefit, I\r\nonely vndergoe my trauell.\r\n\r\nYou shall vnderstand therefore, that there is another way to graft,\r\nwhich is called grafting betweene the barke and tree, and it is to be\r\nput in vse about the latter end of February, at such time as the sappe\r\nbeginnes to enter into the trees: and the stockes most fit for this\r\nmanner of grafting are those which are oldest and greatest, whose graine\r\nbeing rough and vneuen, either through shaking or twinding, it is a\r\nthing almost impossible to make it cleaue in any good fashion, so that\r\nin such a case it is meete that the grafter exercise this way of\r\ngrafting betwixt the barke and the tree, the manner whereof is thus.\r\n\r\n{SN: Grafting betweene the barke.}\r\nFirst, you shall dresse your grafts in such sort as was before discribed\r\nwhen you grafted in the cleft, onely they shall not be so long from the\r\nknot or seame downeward by an inch or more, neither so thicke, but as\r\nthinne as may be, the pith onely preserued, and at the neather end of\r\nall you shall cut away the barke on both sides, making that end smaller\r\nand narrower then it is at the ioynt or seame, then sawing off the head\r\nof the stocke, you shall with a sharpe knife pare the head round about,\r\nsmooth and plaine, making the barke so euen as may be, that the barke of\r\nyour grafts and it may ioyne like one body, then take a fine narrow\r\nchissell, not exceeding sharpe, but somewhat rebated, and thrust it hard\r\ndowne betwixt the barke and the tree, somewhat more then two inches,\r\naccording to the iust length of your graft, and then gently thrust the\r\ngraft downe into the same place, euen close vnto the ioynt, hauing great\r\ncare that the ioynt rest firme and constant vpon the head of the stocke,\r\nand thus you shall put into one stocke not aboue three grafts at the\r\nmost, how euer either other mens practise, or your owne reading doe\r\nperswade you to the contrary. After your grafts are fixt and placed, you\r\nshall then couer the head with barke, clay, and mosse, as hath beene\r\nformerly shewed: also you shall fasten about it some bushes of thorne,\r\nor sharpe whinnes, which may defend and keepe it from the annoyance of\r\nPye-annats, and such like great birds.\r\n\r\nThere is another way of grafting, which is called grafting in the\r\nscutchion, which howsoeuer it is esteemed, yet is it troublesome,\r\nincertaine, and to small purpose: the season for it is in summer, from\r\nMay till August, at what time trees are fullest of sappe and fullest of\r\nleaues, and the manner is thus: take the highest and the principallest\r\nbranches of the toppe of the tree you would haue grafted, and without\r\ncutting it from the olde woode chuse the best eye and budding place of\r\nthe cyon, then take another such like eye or budde, being great and\r\nfull, and first cut off the leafe hard by the budde, then hollow it with\r\nyour knife the length of a quarter of an inch beneath the budde, round\r\nabout the barke, close to the sappe, both aboue and below, then slit it\r\ndowne twice so much wide of the budde, and then with a small sharpe\r\nchissell raise vp the scutchion, with not onely the budde in the midst\r\nbut euen all the sappe likewise, wherein you shall first raise that side\r\nwhich is next you, and then taking the scutchion betweene your fingars,\r\nraise it gently vp without breaking or brusing, and in taking it off\r\nhould it hard vnto the woode, to the end the sappe of the budde may\r\nabide in the scutchion, for if it depart from the barke and cleaue to\r\nthe woode, your labour is lost, this done you shall take another like\r\ncyon, and hauing taken off the barke from it, place it in the others\r\nplace, and in taking off this barke you must be carfull that you cut not\r\nthe woode, but the barke onely, and this done you shall couer it all\r\nouer with redde waxe, or some such glutenous matter; as for the binding\r\nof it with hempe and such trumpery it is vtterly dissalowed of all good\r\ngrafters: this manner of grafting may be put in practise vpon all manner\r\nof cyons, from the bignesse of a mans little fingar to the bignesse of a\r\nslender arme.\r\n\r\n{SN: Grafting with the Leafe.}\r\nNot much vnlike vnto this, is the grafting with the Leafe, and of like\r\nworth, the art whereof is thus: any time betwixt midst May, vntill the\r\nmidst of September, you shall chuse, from the toppe of the sunne-side of\r\nthe tree, the most principall young cyon you can see, whose barke is\r\nsmoothest, whose leaues are greatest, and whose sappe is fullest, then\r\ncutting it from the tree note the principall leafe thereof, and cut away\r\nfrom it all the woode more then about an inch of each side of the leafe,\r\nthen cutting away the vndermost part of the barke with your knife, take\r\npeece meale from the barke all the woode and sappe, saue onely that\r\nlittle part of woode and sappe which feedeth the leafe, which in any\r\nwise must be left behind, so that the graft will carry this figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThen goe to the body, arme, or branch of that tree which you intend to\r\ngraft, which is to be presupposed must euer haue a smooth and tender\r\nbarke, and with a very sharpe knife slit the barke, two slits at least,\r\ntwo inches long a peece, and about halfe an inch or more distance\r\nbetweene the two slits: then make another slit crosse-wise ouerthwart,\r\nfrom long slit to long slit, the figure whereof will be thus:\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThen with your knife raise the barke gently from the tree, without\r\nbreaking, cracking, or brusing: then take your graft, and putting it\r\nvnder the barke lay it flat vnto the sappe of the tree, so as that\r\nlittle sappe which is left in the leafe, may without impediment cleaue\r\nto the sappe of the tree, then lay downe the barke close againe and\r\ncouer the graft, and with a little vntwound hempe, or a soft wollen\r\nlist, binde downe the barke close to the graft, and then couer all the\r\nincisions you haue made with greene waxe: by this manner of grafting you\r\nmay haue vpon one tree sundry fruits, as from one Apple-tree, both\r\nPippins, Peare-maines, Russettings and such like, nay, you may haue vpon\r\none tree, ripe fruit all summer long, as Ienettings from one branch,\r\nCislings from another, Wibourns from another, Costards and Queene-Apples\r\nfrom others, and Pippens and Russettings, from others, which bringeth\r\nboth delight to the eye, and admiration to the sence, and yet I would\r\nnot haue you imagine that this kinde of grafting doth onely worke this\r\neffect, for as before I shewed you, if you graft in the cleft (which is\r\nthe fastest way of all grafting) sundry fruits vpon sundry armes or\r\nbowes, you shall likewise haue proceeding from them sundry sorts of\r\nfruits, as either Apples, Plumbes, Peares or any other kind, according\r\nto your composition and industry; as at this day we may dayly see in\r\nmany great mens Orchards.\r\n\r\n{SN: Grafting on the toppes of trees.}\r\nThere is yet another manner of grafting, and it is of all other\r\nespecially vsed much in Italy, and yet not any thing disagreeable with\r\nour climate, and that is to graft on the small cyons which are on the\r\ntoppes of fruit trees, surely an experience that carryeth in it both\r\ndificulty and wonder, yet being put to approbation is no lesse certaine\r\nthen any of the other, the manner whereof is thus: you shall first after\r\nyou haue chosen such and so many grafts as you doe intend to graft, and\r\ntrimd them in the same manner as you haue beene taught formerly for\r\ngrafting within the cleft, you shall then mount vp into the toppe of the\r\ntree, vpon which you meane to graft, and there make choise of the\r\nhighest and most principallest cyons (being cleane barkt and round)\r\nthat you can perceiue to grow from the tree, then laying the graft, and\r\nthe cyon vpon which you are to graft, together, see that they be both of\r\none bignesse and roundnesse: then with your grafting knife cut the cyon\r\noff betweene the olde woode and the new, and cleaue it downe an inch and\r\nan halfe, or two inches at the most: then put in your graft (which graft\r\nmust not be cut thinner on one side, then on the other, but all of one\r\nthicknesse) and when it is in, see that the barke of the graft both\r\naboue and below, that is, vpon both sides, doe ioyne close, euen, and\r\nfirme with the barke of the branch or cyon, and then by foulding a\r\nlittle soft towe about it, keepe them close together, whilst with clay,\r\nmosse, and the in-most barke of Osyars you lappe them about to defend\r\nthem from ayre, winde, and tempests. And herein you shall obserue to\r\nmake your graft as short as may be, for the shortest are best, as the\r\ngraft which hath not aboue two or three knots, or buddes, and no more.\r\nYou may, if you please, with this manner of grafting graft vpon euery\r\nseuerall cyon, a seuerall fruit, and so haue from one tree many fruits,\r\nas in case of grafting with the leafe, and that with much more speede,\r\nby as much as a well-growne graft is more forward and able then a weake\r\ntender leafe. And in these seuerall wayes already declared, consisteth\r\nthe whole Art and substance of Grafting: from whence albeit many curious\r\nbraines may, from preuaricating trickes, beget showes of other fashions,\r\nyet when true iudgement shall looke vpon their workes, he shall euer\r\nfinde some one of these experiments the ground and substance of all\r\ntheir labours, without which they are able to doe nothing that shall\r\nturne to an assured commoditie.\r\n\r\n{SN: The effects of Grafting.}\r\nNow when you haue made your selfe perfect in the sowing, setting,\r\nplanting and grafting of trees, you shall then learne to know the\r\neffects, wonders, and strange issues which doe proceede from many quaint\r\nmotions and helpes in grafting, as thus: if you will haue Peaches,\r\nCherryes, Apples, Quinces, Medlars, Damsons, or any Plumbe whatsoeuer,\r\nto ripen earely, as at the least two months before the ordinary time,\r\nand to continue at least a month longer then the accustomed course, you\r\nshall then graft them vpon a Mulberry stocke: and if you will haue the\r\nfruit to tast like spice, with a certaine delicate perfume, you shall\r\nboyle Honey, the powder of Cloues and Soaxe together, and being cold\r\nannoynt the grafts there-with before you put them into the cleft, if you\r\ngraft Apples, Peares, or any fruit vpon a Figge-tree stocke, they will\r\nbeare fruit without blooming: if you take an Apple graft, & a Peare\r\ngraft, of like bignesse, and hauing clouen them, ioyne them as one body\r\nin grafting, the fruit they bring forth will be halfe Apple and halfe\r\nPeare, and so likewise of all other fruits which are of contrary tastes\r\nand natures: if you graft any fruit-tree, or other tree, vpon the Holly\r\nor vpon the Cypresse, they will be greene, and keepe their leaues the\r\nwhole yeere, albeit the winter be neuer so bitter.\r\n\r\nIf you graft either Peach, Plumbe, or any stone-fruit vpon a Willow\r\nstocke, the fruit which commeth of them will be without stones.\r\n\r\nIf you will change the colour of any fruit, you shall boare a hole\r\nslope-wise with a large auger into the body of the tree, euen vnto the\r\npith, and then if you will haue the fruit yealow you shal fill the hole\r\nwith Saferne dissolued in water: if you will haue it redde, then with\r\nSaunders, and of any other colour you please, and then stoppe the hole\r\nvp close, and couer it with red or yealow waxe: also if you mixe the\r\ncoulour with any spice or perfume, the fruit will take a rellish or tast\r\nof the same: many other such like conceits and experiments are practised\r\namongst men of this Art, but sith they more concerne the curious, then\r\nthe wise, I am not so carefull to bestow my labour in giuing more\r\nsubstantiall satisfaction, knowing curiosity loues that best which\r\nproceedes from their most paine, and am content to referre their\r\nknowledge to the searching of those bookes which haue onely strangnesse\r\nfor their subiect, resolued that this I haue written is fully sufficient\r\nfor the plaine English husbandman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\n_Of the replanting of Trees, and furnishing the Orchard._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soone as your seedes, or sets, haue brought forth plants, those\r\nplants, through time, made able, and haue receiued grafts, and those\r\ngrafts haue couered the heads of the stockes and put forth goodly\r\nbranches, you shall then take them vp, and replant them, (because the\r\nsooner it is done the better it is done) in those seuerall places of\r\nyour Orchard which before is appointed, and is intended to be prepared,\r\nboth by dungging, digging, and euery orderly labour, to receiue euery\r\nseuerall fruit. And herein you shall vnderstand, that as the best times\r\nfor grafting are euery month (except October and Nouember) and at the\r\nchange of the moone, so the best times for replanting, are Nouember and\r\nMarch onely, vnlesse the ground be cold and moist and then Ianuary, or\r\nFebruary must be the soonest all wayes, excepted that you doe not\r\nreplant in the time of frost, for that is most vnholsome.\r\n\r\n{SN: The taking vp of trees.}\r\nNow when you will take vp your trees which you intend to replant in your\r\nOrchard, you shall first with a spade bare all the maine branches of the\r\nroote, and so by degrees digge and loosen the earth from the roote, in\r\nsuch sort that you may with your owne strength raise the young tree from\r\nthe ground, which done, you shall not, according to the fashion of\r\nFraunce, dismember, or disroabe the tree of his beauties, that is to\r\nsay, to cut off all his vpper branches and armes, but you shall\r\ndiligently preserue them: for I haue seene a tree thus replanted after\r\nthe fall of the leafe to bring forth fruit in the summer following: but\r\nif the tree you replant be olde then it is good to cut off the maine\r\nbranches with in a foote of the stocke, least the sappe running vpward,\r\nand so forsaking the roote too sodainely doe kill the whole tree.\r\n\r\nWhen you haue taken your tree vp, you shall obserue how, and in what\r\nmanner, it stoode, that is, which side was vpon the South and receiued\r\nmost comfort from the sunne, and which side was from it and receiued\r\nmost shadow and bleaknesse, and in the same sort as it then stoode, so\r\nshall you replant it againe: this done you shall with a sharpe\r\ncutting-knife, cut off all the maine rootes, within halfe a foote of the\r\ntree, onely the small thriddes or twist-rootes you shall not cut at all:\r\nthen bringing the plant into your Orchard, you shall make a round hole\r\nin that place where you intend to set your tree (the rankes, manner,\r\ndistance and forme whereof hath beene all ready declared, in the first\r\nChapter:) and this hole shalbe at least foure foote ouerthwart euery\r\nway, and at least two foote deepe, then shall you fill vp the hole\r\nagaine, fifteene inches deepe, with the finest blacke mould, tempered\r\nwith Oxe dunge that you can get, so that then the hole shalbe but nine\r\ninches deepe, then you shall take your tree and place it vpon that\r\nearth, hauing care to open euery seuerall branch and thrid of the roote,\r\n& so to place them that they may all looke downe into the earth, and not\r\nany of them to looke backe and turne vpward: then shall you take of the\r\nearth from whence your tree was taken, and tempering it with a fourth\r\npart of Oxe dunge and slekt sope-asshes (for the killing of wormes)\r\ncouer all the roote of your tree firmely and strongly: then with greene\r\nsoddes, cut and ioyned arteficially together, so sodde the place that\r\nthe hole may hardly be discerned. Lastly take a strong stake, and\r\ndriuing it hard into the ground neare vnto the new planted tree, with\r\neither a soft hay rope, the broad barke of Willow, or some such like\r\nvnfretting band, tye the tree to the stake, and it will defend it from\r\nthe rage of winde and tempests, which should they but shake or trouble\r\nthe roote, being new planted, it were inough to confound and spoyle the\r\ntree for euer.\r\n\r\nNow, although I haue vnder the title and demonstration of replanting\r\none tree giuen you a generall instruction for the replanting of all\r\ntrees whatsoeuer, yet, for as much as some are not of that strength and\r\nhardnesse to indure so much as some others will, therefore you shal take\r\nthese considerations by the way, to fortefie your knowledge with.\r\n\r\nFirst, you shall vnderstand that all your dainty and tender grafted\r\nPlumbes, and fruits, as Abricots, Peaches, Damaske-Plumbes, Verdochyos,\r\nPescods, Emperialls, and diuers such like, together with Orrenges,\r\nCytrons, Almonds, Oliues, and others, which indeede are not familiar\r\nwith our soyles, as being nearer neighbours to the sunne, doe delight in\r\na warme, fat, earth, being somewhat sandy, or such a clay whose\r\ncoldnesse by Manure is corrected, and therefore here with vs in the\r\nreplanting of them you cannot bestow too much cost vpon the mould: as\r\nfor the Damson, and all our naturall english Plumbes, they loue a fat,\r\ncold, earth, so that in the replanting of them if you shall lay too much\r\ndunge vnto their roote, you shall through the aboundant heate, doe great\r\nhurt vnto the tree. The cherry delighteth in any clay, so that vpon such\r\nsoyle you may vse lesse Manure, but vpon the contrary you cannot lay too\r\nmuch. The Medlar esteemeth all earths alike, and therefore whether it be\r\nManured or no it skilles not, sunne and shadow, wet and drinesse, being\r\nall of one force or efficacy. The Peare and Apple-tree delights in a\r\nstrong mixt soyle, and therfore indureth Manure kindly, so doth also the\r\nQuince and Warden: lastly the Filbert, the Hasell, and the Chesnut, loue\r\ncold, leane, moist, and sandy earths, in so much that there is no\r\ngreater enimy vnto them then a rich soyle: so that in replanting of them\r\nyou must euer seeke rather to correct then increase fertillity.\r\n\r\nYou shall also vnderstand that all such fruit-trees as you doe plant\r\nagainst the walles of your Orchard (of which I haue spoken already &\r\ndeciphered out their places) you shall not suffer to grow as of\r\nthemselues, round, and from the wall, but at the times of pruning and\r\ndressing of them (which is euer at the beginning of the spring and\r\nimmediately after the fall) you shall as it were plash them, and spread\r\nthem against the wall, foulding the armes in loopes of leather, and\r\nnayling them vnto the wall: and to that end you shall place them of such\r\na fit distance one from another, that they may at pleasure spread and\r\nmount, without interruption: the profit whereof is at this day seene\r\nalmost in euery great mans Orchard: and although I haue but onely\r\nappointed vnto the wall the most quaint fruits of forraine nations; yet\r\nthere is no fruit of our owne, but if it be so ordered it will prosper\r\nand bring forth his fruit better and in greater abundance. And thus much\r\nfor the replanting of trees and furnishing of a well proportioned\r\nOrchard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Dressing, Dungging, Proyning, and Preseruing of Trees._\r\n\r\n\r\nSith after all the labour spent of ingendring by seede, of fortefying\r\nand inabling by planting, and of multiplying by grafting it is to little\r\nor no purpose if the trees be not maintained and preserued by dressing,\r\ndungging and proyning, I will therefore in this place shew you what\r\nbelongs to that office or duty, and first, for the dressing of trees:\r\nyou shall vnderstand that it containeth all whatsoeuer is meete for the\r\ngood estate of the tree, as first, after your tree is planted, or\r\nreplanted, if the season shall fall out hot, dry, and parching, insomuch\r\nthat the moisture of the earth is sucked out by the atraction of the\r\nSunne, and so the tree wanteth the nutriment of moisture, in this case\r\nyou shall not omit euery morning before the rising of the sunne, and\r\neuery euening after the set of the sunne, with a great watring-pot\r\nfilled with water, to water & bath the rootes of the trees, if they be\r\nyoung trees, and newly planted, or replanted, but not otherwise: for if\r\nthe trees be olde, and of long growth, then you shall saue that labour,\r\nand onely to such olde trees you shall about the midst of Nouember, with\r\na spade, digge away the earth from the vpper part of the rootes and lay\r\nthem bare vntill it be midde-March, and then mingling such earth as is\r\nmost agreeable with the fruit and Oxe-dunge and sope-ashes together, so\r\ncouer them againe, and tread the earth close about them: as for the\r\nvncouering of your trees in summer I doe not hold it good, because the\r\nreflection of the sunne is somewhat too violent and dryeth the roote,\r\nfrom whence at that time the sappe naturally is gone: you shall also\r\neuery spring and fall of the leafe clense your fruit trees from mosse,\r\nwhich proceeding from a cold and cankerous moisture, breedeth dislike,\r\nand barrainenesse in trees: this mosse you must take off with the backe\r\nof an olde knife and leaue the barke smooth, plaine, and vnraced: also\r\nif you shall dunge such trees with the dunge of Swine, it is a ready way\r\nto destroy the mosse.\r\n\r\n{SN: Proyning of Trees.}\r\nAfter you haue drest and trimmed your trees, you shall then proyne them,\r\nwhich is to cut away all those superfluous branches, armes, or cyons,\r\nwhich being either barraine, bruised or misplaced, doe like drones,\r\nsteale-away that nutriment which should maintaine the better deseruing\r\nsinewes, and you shall vnderstand that the best time for proyning of\r\ntrees, is in March and Aprill, at which time the sappe assending vpward,\r\ncauseth the trees to budde: the branches you shall cut away are all such\r\nas shall grow out of the stocke vnderneath the place grafted, or all\r\nsuch as by the shaking of tempests shall grow in a disorderly and ill\r\nfashioned crookednesse, or any other, that out of a well tempered\r\niudgement shall seeme superfluous and burdensome to the stocke from\r\nwhence it springs, also such as haue by disorder beene brooken, or\r\nmaimed, and all these you shall cut away with a hooke knife, close by\r\nthe tree, vnlesse you haue occasion by some misfortune to cut away some\r\nof the maine and great armes of the tree, and then you shall not vse\r\nyour knife for feare of tearing the barke, but taking your sawe you\r\nshall sawe off those great armes close by the tree, neither shall you\r\nsawe them off downeward but vpward, least the waight of the arme breake\r\nthe barke from the body: And herein you shall also vnderstand that for\r\nas much as the mischances which beget these dismembrings doe happen at\r\nthe latter end of Summer, in the gathering of the fruit, and that it is\r\nnot fit such maymed and broken boughes hang vpon the tree till the\r\nSpring, therefore you shall cut them off in the Winter time, but not\r\nclose to the tree by almost a foote, and so letting them rest vntill the\r\nspring, at that time cut them off close by the tree. Now if you finde\r\nthe superfluitie of branches which annoy your trees to be onely small\r\ncyons, springing from the rootes of the trees, as it often hapneth with\r\nall sorts of Plumbe-trees, Cherry-trees, Nut-trees, and such like, then\r\nyou shall in the winter, bare the rootes of those trees, and cut off\r\nthose cyons close by the roote: but if your trees be broused or eaten by\r\ntame-Deare, Goates, Sheepe, Kine, Oxen, or such like, then there is no\r\nhelp for such a misfortune but onely to cut off the whole head and graft\r\nthe stocke anew.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Barke-bound.}\r\nNext to the proyning of trees, is the preseruing, phisicking, and curing\r\nof the diseases of trees: to which they are subiect as well as our\r\nnaturall bodyes: and first of all, there is a disease called\r\nBarke-bound, which is when the barke, through a mislike and leperous\r\ndrynesse, bindeth in the tree with such straitnesse that the sappe being\r\ndenied passage the body growes into a consumption: it is in nature like\r\nvnto that disease which in beasts is called hide-bound, and the cure is\r\nthus: at the beginning of March take a sharpe knife, and from the toppe\r\nof the body of the tree, to the very roote, draw downe certaine slits,\r\nor incissions, cleane through the barke, vnto the very sappe of the\r\ntree, round about the tree, & then with the backe of your knife open\r\nthose slits and annoint them all through with Tarre, and in short space\r\nit will giue libertie vnto the tree to encrease & grow: this disease\r\ncommeth by the rubbing of cattell against the tree, especially Swine,\r\nwho are very poyson vnto all plants.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the Gall.}\r\nThere is another disease in fruit-trees, called the Gall, and it eateth\r\nand consumeth the barke quit away, and so in time kills the tree: the\r\ncure is to cut and open the barke which you see infected, and with a\r\nchissell to take away all that is foule and putrefied, and then to\r\nclappe Oxe dunge vpon the place, and it will helpe it, and this must be\r\ndone euer in winter.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the Canker.}\r\nThe Canker in fruit trees is the consumption both of the barke and the\r\nbody, & it commeth either by the dropping of trees one vpon another, or\r\nelse when some hollow places of the tree retaineth raine water in them,\r\nwhich fretting through the barke, poysoneth the tree: the cure is to cut\r\naway all such boughes as by dropping breede the euill, and if the hollow\r\nplaces cannot be smooth and made euen, then to stoppe them with clay,\r\nwaxe, and sope-ashes mixt together.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of worme-eaten barkes.}\r\nIf the barkes of your trees be eaten with wormes, which you shall\r\nperceiue by the swelling of the barke, you shall then open the barke and\r\nlay there-vpon swines dunge, sage, and lime beaten together, and bound\r\nwith a cloath fast to the tree, and it will cure it: or wash the tree\r\nwith cowes-pisse and vinegar and it will helpe it.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Pismiers and Snailes.}\r\nIf your young trees be troubled with Pismiers, or Snailes, which are\r\nvery noysome vnto them, you shall take vnsleckt lime and sope-ashes and\r\nmingling them with wine-lees, spread it all about the roote of the trees\r\nso infected, and annoint the body of the tree likewise therewith, and it\r\nwill not onely destroy them but giue comfort to the tree: the soote of a\r\nchimney or Oake sawe-dust spread about the roote will doe the same.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Caterpillers, and Earewigges.}\r\nIf Caterpillers doe annoy your young trees, who are great deuourers of\r\nthe leaues and young buddes, and spoylers of the barke, you shall, if it\r\nbe in the summer time, make a very strong brine of water and salt, and\r\neither with a garden pumpe, placed in a tubbe, or with squirts which\r\nhaue many hoales you shall euery second day water and wash your trees,\r\nand it will destroy them, because the Caterpiller naturally cannot\r\nindure moisture, but if neuerthelesse you see they doe continue still\r\nvpon your trees in Winter, then you shall when the leaues are falne away\r\ntake dankish straw and setting it on fire smeare and burne them from the\r\ntree, and you shall hardly euer be troubled with them againe vpon the\r\nsame trees: roules of hay layd on the trees will gather vp Earewigges\r\nand kill them.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the barrainenesse of Trees.}\r\nIf your trees be barraine, and albeit they flourish and spread there\r\nleaues brauely, yet bring forth no fruit at all, it is a great\r\nsicknesse, and the worst of all other: therefore you shall vnderstand it\r\nproceedeth of two causes: first, of two much fertillitie, and fatnesse\r\nof the ground, which causeth the leafe to put forth and flourish in such\r\nvnnaturall abundance, that all such sappe and nutriment as should knit\r\nand bring forth fruit, turnes onely vnto leafe, cyons, and vnprofitable\r\nbranches, which you shall perceiue both by the abundance of the leaues\r\nand by the colour also, which will be of a more blacker and deeper\r\ngreene, and of much larger proportion then those which haue but their\r\nnaturall and proper rights: and the cure thereof is to take away the\r\nearth from the roote of such trees and fill vp the place againe with\r\nother earth, which is of a much leaner substance: but if your tree haue\r\nno such infirmitie of fatnesse, but beareth his leaues and branches in\r\ngood order and of right colour and yet notwithstanding is barraine and\r\nbringeth forth little or no fruit, then that disease springeth from some\r\nnaturall defect in the tree, and the cure thereof is thus: first, you\r\nshall vnbare the roote of the tree, and then noting which is the\r\ngreatest and principallest branch of all the roote, you shall with a\r\ngreat wimble boare a hole into that roote and then driue a pinne of olde\r\ndry Ashe into the same (for Oake is not altogether so good) and then\r\ncutting the pinne off close by the roote, couer all the head of the\r\npinne with yealow waxe, and then lay the mould vpon the roote of the\r\ntree againe, and treade it hard and firmely downe, and there is no\r\ndoubte but the tree will beare the yeere following: in Fraunce they vse\r\nfor this infirmitie to boare a hoale in the body of the tree\r\nslope-wise, somewhat past the hart, and to fill vp the hoale with life\r\nhoney and Rose-water mixt together, and incorporated for at least\r\nxxiiij. howers, and then to stoppe the hole with a pinne of the one\r\nwoode: also if you wash the rootes of your trees in the drane water\r\nwhich runneth from your Barley when you steepe it for Malt, it will cure\r\nthis disease of barrainenesse.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the bitternesse of Fruit.}\r\nIf the fruit which is vpon your trees be of a bitter and sootie tast, to\r\nmake it more pleasant and sweet you shall wash your tree all ouer with\r\nSwines dunge and water mixt together, & to the rootes of the trees you\r\nshall lay earth and Swines dunge mixt together, which must be done in\r\nthe month of Ianuary and February onely, and it will make the fruit tast\r\npleasantly. And thus much for the dressing and preseruing of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\n_Of the Vine, and of his ordering._\r\n\r\n\r\nFor as much as the nature, temperature, and clymate, of our soyle is not\r\nso truely proper and agreeing with the Vine as that of Fraunce, Italy,\r\nSpaine, and such like, and sith wee haue it more for delight, pleasure,\r\nand prospect, then for any peculyar profit, I will not vndertake\r\n_Monsiuer Lybaults_ painefull labour, in discribing euery curious\r\nperfection or defect that belongs thereunto, as if it were the onely\r\niewell and commoditie of our kingdome, but onely write so much as is\r\nfitting for our knowledge touching the maintaynance, increase, and\r\npreseruation thereof, in our Orchards, Gardens, and other places of\r\nrecreation.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of planting or setting the Vine.}\r\nFirst then to speake of the planting or setting of the Vine, your\r\ngreatest diligence must be to seeke out the best plants, and if that\r\nwhich is most strange, rare, great and pleasant be the best, then is\r\nthat grape which is called the Muskadine, or Sacke grape, the best, and\r\nhaue their beginning either from Spaine, the Canary Ilands, or such like\r\nplaces: next to them is the French grape, of which there be many kindes,\r\nthe best whereof is the grape of Orleance, the next the grape of\r\nGascoynie, the next of Burdeaux, and the worst of Rochell, and not any\r\nof these but by industry will prosper in our English gardens: when\r\ntherefore you chuse your plants, you shall chuse such of the young cyons\r\nas springing from the olde woode, you may in the cutting cut at least a\r\nioynt or two of olde woode with the young: for the olde will take\r\nsoonest, and this olde woode must be at least seauen or eight inches\r\nlong, and the young cyon almost a yard, and the thicker and closer the\r\nioynts of the young cyon are, so much the better they are: and the fit\r\ntime for cutting and gathering these sets are in midde-Ianuary, then\r\nhauing prepared, digged, and dunged your earth the winter before, you\r\nshall at the latter end of Ianuary take two of these sets, or plants,\r\nplacing them according to this figure:\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nAnd lay them in the earth slope-wise, at least a foote deepe, leauing\r\nout of the earth, vncouered, not aboue foure or fiue ioynts, at the\r\nmost, and then couer them with good earth firmely, closely, and\r\nstrongly, hauing regard to raise those cyons which are without the earth\r\ndirectly vpward, obseruing after they be set, once in a month to weede\r\nthem, and keepe them as cleane as is possible: for nothing is more\r\nnoysome vnto them then the suffocating of weeds: also you shall not\r\nsuffer the mould to grow hard or bind about the rootes, but with a small\r\nspade once in a fortnight to loosen and breake the earth, because there\r\nrootes are so tender that the least straytning doth strangle and\r\nconfound them. If the season doe grow dry, you may vse to water them,\r\nbut not in such sort as you water other plants, which is to sprinckle\r\nwater round about the earth of the rootes, but you shall with a round\r\nIron made for the purpose somewhat bigger then a mans fingar, make\r\ncertaine holes into the earth, close vpon the roote of the Vine, and\r\npowre therein either water, the dregges of strong-Ale, or the lees of\r\nWine, or if you will you may mixe with the lees of Wine either\r\nGoats-milke, or Cowes-milke, and power it into the holes and it will\r\nnourish the Vine exceedingly, and not the Vine onely, but all sorts of\r\ndainty grafted Plumbes, especially Peaches.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of proyning the Vine.}\r\nNow for proyning the Vine, you shall vnderstand that it is euer to be\r\ndone after the fall of the leafe, when the sappe is desended downeward,\r\nfor if you shall proyne, or cut him, either in the spring, or when the\r\nsappe is aloft, it will bleede so exceedingly, that with great\r\ndifficulty you shall saue the body of the tree from dying: and, in\r\nproyning of the Vine you shall obserue two things, the first, that you\r\ncut away all superfluous cyons and branches, both aboue and below, which\r\neither grow disorderly aboue, or fruitlessely below, and in cutting them\r\nyou shall obserue, neither to cut the olde woode with the young cyon,\r\nnor to leaue aboue one head or leader vpon one branch: secondly, you\r\nshall in proyning, plash and spread the VINE thinnely against the wall,\r\ngiuing euery seuerall branch and cyon his place, and passage, and not\r\nsuffer it to grow loosely, rudely, or like a wilde thorne, out of all\r\ndecency and proportion: for you must vnderstand that your Grapes doe\r\ngrow euer vpon the youngest cyons, and if of them you shall preserue too\r\nmany, questionlesse for want of nourishment they will lose their vertue,\r\nand you your profit. Now if your Vine be a very olde Vine, and that his\r\nfruit doth decay, either in quantitie or proportion; if then you finde\r\nhe haue any young cyons which spring from his roote, then when you\r\nproyne him you shall cut away all the olde stocke, within lesse then an\r\nhandfull of the young cyons, and make them the leaders, who will prosper\r\nand continue in perfection a long time after, especially if you trimme\r\nthe rootes with fresh earth, and fresh dunge. Againe, if you be carefull\r\nto looke vnto your Vine, you shall perceiue close by euery bunch of\r\ngrapes certaine small thridde-like cyons, which resemble twound wyars,\r\ncurling and turning in many rings, these also take from the grapes very\r\nmuch nutriment, so that it shall be a labour very well imployd to cut\r\nthem away as you perceiue them.\r\n\r\n{SN: Experiments of the Vine.}\r\nNow from the Vine there is gathered sundry experiments, as to haue it\r\ntast more pleasant then the true nature of the grape, and to smell in\r\nthe mouth odoriferously, or as if it were perfumed, which may be done in\r\nthis sort: Take damaske-Rose-water and boyle therein the powder of\r\nCloaues, Cynamon, three graines of Amber, and one of Muske, and when it\r\nis come to be somewhat thicke, take a round goudge and make a hole in\r\nthe maine stocke of the Vine, full as deepe as the hart thereof, and\r\nthen put therein this medicine, then stopping the hole with Cypresse, or\r\nIuniper, lay greene-waxe thereupon, and binde a linnen cloath about it,\r\nand the next grapes which shall spring from that Vine will tast as if\r\nthey were preserued or perfumed.\r\n\r\nIf you will haue grapes without stones, you shall take your plants and\r\nplant the small ends downeward and be assured your desire is attained.\r\n\r\nThe Vine naturally of himselfe doth not bring forth fruit till it haue\r\nbeene three yeeres planted: but if euening and morning for the first\r\nmonth you will bath his roote with Goats-milke or Cowes-milke, it will\r\nbeare fruit the first yeere of his planting. Lastly, you may if you\r\nplease graft one Vine vpon another, as the sweet vpon the sower, as the\r\nMuskadine grape, or greeke, vpon the Rochell or Burdeaux, the Spanish,\r\nor Iland grape, on the Gascoyne, and the Orleance vpon any at all: and\r\nthese compositions are the best, and bring forth both the greatest and\r\npleasantest grapes: therefore whensoeuer you will graft one grape vpon\r\nanother, you shall doe it in the beginning of Ianuary, in this sort:\r\nfirst, after you haue chosen and trimmed your grafts, which in all sorts\r\nmust be like the grafts of other fruits, then with a sharpe knife, you\r\nshall cleaue the head of the Vine, as you doe other stockes and then put\r\nin your graft, or cyon, being made as thinne as may be and see that the\r\nbarkes and sappes ioyne euen and close together, then clay it, mosse it,\r\nand couer it, as hath beene before declared.\r\n\r\n{SN: The medicining of the Vine.}\r\nIf your Vine grow too ranke and thicke of leaues, so that the sappe doth\r\nwast it selfe in them, and you thereby lose the profit of the fruit, you\r\nshall then bare all the rootes of the Vine, and cast away the earth,\r\nfilling vp the place againe with sand & ashes mingled together: but if\r\nthe Vine be naturally of it selfe barraine, then with a goudge you shall\r\nmake a hole halfe way through the maine body of the Vine, and driue into\r\nthe hole a round pible stone, which although it goe straitly in, yet it\r\nmay not fill vp the hole, but that the sicke humour of the Vine may\r\npasse thorrow thereat: then couer the roote with rich earth, and Oxe\r\ndunge mixt together, and once a day for a month water it with olde\r\npisse, or vrine of a man, and it will make the tree fruitfull: if the\r\nVine be troubled with Wormes, Snailes, Ants, Earewigges, or such like,\r\nyou shall morning and euening sprinckle it ouer with cowes-pisse and\r\nvinegar mixt together & it will helpe it: & thus much for ordering the\r\nVine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\n_The office of the Fruiterrer, or the Gatherer, and keeper, of Fruit._\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter you haue planted euery seuerall quarter, allye, and border within\r\nyour Orchard, with euery seuerall fruit proper vnto his place, and that\r\nyou haue placed them in that orderly and comely equipage which may giue\r\nmost delight to the eye, profit to the tree, and commendations to the\r\nworkeman, (according to the forme and order prescribed in the first\r\nChapter) and that now the blessing of the highest, time, and your\r\nindeuours hath brought forth the haruest and recompence of your trauell,\r\nso that you behould the long-expected fruit hang vpon the trees, as it\r\nwere in their ripenesse, wooing you to plucke, tast, and to deliuer them\r\nfrom the wombes of their parents, it is necessary then that you learne\r\nthe true office of the Fruiterer, who is in due season and time to\r\ngather those fruits which God hath sent him: for as in the husbanding of\r\nour grayne if the Husbandman be neuer so carefull, or skilfull, in\r\nploughing, dungging, sowing, weeding and preseruing his crop, yet in the\r\ntime of haruest be negligent, neither regarding the strength or ripnesse\r\nthereof, or in the leading and mowing respects not whether it be wet or\r\ndry, doth in that moments space loose the wages of his whole yeeres\r\ntrauell, getting but durt from durt, and losse from his negligence: so\r\nin like case houlds it with all other fruits, if a man with neuer so\r\ngreat care and cost procure, yet if he be inrespectiue in the gathering,\r\nall his former businesse is vaine and to no purpose; and therefore I\r\nhould nothing more necessary then the relation of this office of the\r\nFruiterer, which is the consummation and onely hope of our cost, and\r\ndiligence, teaching vs to gather wisely what wee haue planted wearily,\r\nand to eate with contentment what we haue preserued with care.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of gathering and preseruing Cherries.}\r\nKnow then, that of all fruits (for the most part) the Cherry is the\r\nsoonest ripe, as being one of the oldest children of the summer, and\r\ntherefore first of all to be spoken of in this place, yet are not all\r\nCherries ripe at one instant, but some sooner then other some, according\r\nto the benefit of the Sunne, the warmth of the ayre, and the strength of\r\nsappe in the branch on which the Cherry hangeth: they are a fruit tender\r\nand pleasant, and therefore much subiect to be deuoured and consumed\r\nwith Byrds of the smallest kindes, as Sparrowes, Robins, Starlings, and\r\nsuch like, especially the Iay, and the Bull-finch, who deuoure them\r\nstones and all, euen so fast as they rypen: for preuention whereof; if\r\nyou haue great abundance of Cherry trees, as maine holts that be either\r\none or many akers in compasse, you shall then in diuers places of your\r\nholts, as well in the midst, as out-corners, cause to be errected vp\r\ncertaine long poales of Fyrre, or other woode, which may mount somewhat\r\naboue the toppes of the trees, and one the toppes of those poales you\r\nshall place certaine clappe-milles made of broken trenchers ioyned\r\ntogether like sayles, which being moued and carryed about with the\r\nsmallest ayre, may haue vnderneath the sayles a certaine loose little\r\nboard, against which euery sayle may clap and make a great noyse, which\r\nwill afright and scare the Byrds from your trees: these milles you shall\r\ncommonly see in Husbandmens yards placed on their stackes or houells of\r\nCorne, which doth preserue them from fowle and vermine: but for want of\r\nthese clap-milles you must haue some boy or young fellow that must euery\r\nmorning from the dawning of the day till the Sunne be more then an houre\r\nhigh, and euery euening from fiue of the clocke till nine, runne vp and\r\ndowne your ground, whooping, showtying, and making of a great noyse, or\r\nnow and then shooting of some Harquebush, or other Peece: but by no\r\nmeanes to vse slings or throwing of stones, least by the miscarriage of\r\nhis hand hee either beate downe the fruit or bruise the trees. In this\r\nsort hauing preserued your Cherries from destruction, you shall then\r\nknow there ripenesse by their colours, for euer those which are most\r\nred, are most ripe, and when you see any that are ripe, you shall take a\r\nlight ladder, made either of fyrre or sallow, and setting it carefully\r\nagainst the branches, so as you neither bruise them nor the fruit, you\r\nshall gather those you finde ripe, not taking the fruit from the stalke,\r\nbut nipping the stalke and fruit both together from the tree: also you\r\nshall be carefull in gathering to handle or touch the Cherry so little\r\nas may be, but the stalke onely, especially if your hands be hot, or\r\nsweaty, for that will change the colour of your Cherries, and make them\r\nlooke blacke: if there be any ripe Cherries which hang out of the reach\r\nof your hands, then you shall haue a fine small gathering hooke of\r\nwoode, whose bout shall be made round, and smooth, for nipping the barke\r\nof the branches, and with it you shall gently pull vnto you those\r\nbranches you cannot reach: you shall also haue a little round basket of\r\nalmost a foote deepe, made with a siue bottome, hauing a handle thwarte\r\nthe toppe, to which a small hooke being fastned, you shall with that\r\nhooke hang the basket by you on some conuenient cyon, and as you gather\r\nthe Cherries, gently lay them downe into the same, and when you haue\r\nfilled your basket you shall descend and empty it into larger great\r\nbaskets made of the same fashion, with siue bottomes, and hauing\r\nvnderneath two broad lathes or splinters, at least three fingers broad a\r\npeece, within foure inches one of the other, and going both one way\r\ncrosse ouerthwart the basket, that if either man or woman shall carry\r\nthem vpon their heads, which is the best manner of cariage, then the\r\nsplinters may defend the bottome of the basket from the head of the\r\nparty, and keepe the Cherries from hurt or bruising, and if you haue\r\noccasion to carry your Cherries farre, and that the quantitie grow\r\nbeyond the support of a man, then you shall packe them in hampers or\r\npanniers made with false bottoms like siues, and finely lyned on the\r\nout side with white straw, and so being closely trust on each side a\r\nHorses-backe, to carry them whether you please. You shall by no meanes\r\nsuffer your Cherries to lye in any great or thicke heapes one vpon\r\nanother, but vntill you sell them, or vse them, lay them as thinne as\r\nmay be, because they are apt of themselues to sweat and catch heate, and\r\nthat heate doth soone depriue them of the glory of their colour. When\r\nyou gather any Cherries to preserue, you shall gather those which are\r\nthe greatest, the ripest, you shall pull them from their stalkes one by\r\none, and vse them at furthest within xxiiij. howers after the time they\r\nare gotten.\r\n\r\n{SN: The gathering of stone Fruit.}\r\n{SN: Of gathering hard Plumbes.}\r\n{SN: Of keeping of Plumbes.}\r\nFor the gathering of Plumbes in generall, it is in the same manner as\r\nyou did gather your Cherries, both with such a like ladder, such a like\r\nhooke, and such like vessels, onely some more speciall obseruations are\r\nto be obserued in gathering your dainty grafted Plumbes, then of the\r\nothers, which are of a more hard and induring nature. You shall know\r\nthen that for gathering of Abricots, Peaches, Date-Plumbes, and such\r\nlike grafted Plumbes, you shall duely consider when they are perfectly\r\nripe, which you shall not iudge by their dropping from the tree, which\r\nis a signe of ouer-much ripnesse, tending to rottennesse, but by the\r\ntrue mixture of their colour, and perfect change from their first\r\ncomplexion: for when you shall perceiue that there is no greenenesse nor\r\nhardnesse in their out-sides, no, not so much as at the setting on of\r\nthe stalke, you may then iudge that they are ready to be gathered, and\r\nfor a perfecter tryall thereof you may if you please, take one which you\r\nthinke ripest from the tree, and opening it if you see the stone comes\r\ncleane and dry away and not any of the in-part of the fruit cleauing\r\nvnto it, then you may assure your selfe that the fruit is ready to be\r\ngathered, which you shall with great deligence and care gather, not by\r\nany meanes laying one Plumbe vpon another, but each seuerally by\r\nanother, for these dainty Plumbes are naturally so tender that the least\r\ntouch, though of themselues, doth bruise them, and occasion\r\nrottennesse. Now when you haue gathered them, if either you haue desire\r\nto send them any iourney, as in gratulation to your friends, or for\r\nother priuate commoditie, you shall take some close, smooth, boxe,\r\nanswerable to the store of fruit you are to send, and first line it\r\nwithin all ouer with white paper, then lay your Plumbes one by one all\r\nouer the bottome of the boxe, then couering them all ouer with white\r\npaper, lay as many moe vpon the toppe of them, and couer them likewise\r\nwith paper, as before, and so lay row vpon row with papers betweene\r\nthem, vntill the boxe be sufficiently filled, and then closing it vp\r\nsende it whether you please, and they will take the least hurt, whereas\r\nif you should line the boxe either with hay or straw, the very skinnes\r\nare so tender that the straw would print into them and bruise them\r\nexceedingly, and to lay any other soft thing about them, as either wooll\r\nor bumbast, is exceeding euill, because it heateth the Plumbes, and\r\nmaketh them sweat, through which they both loose their colour and rot\r\nspeedily. As touching the gathering of Plumbes when they are hard, and\r\nto ripen them afterward by laying them vpon nettles, to which consenteth\r\nthe most of our London-Fruiterrers, I am vtterly against the opinion,\r\nbecause I both know Nature to be the perfectest worke-Mistris, and where\r\nshe is abridged of her power there euer to follow disorders and\r\nimperfections, as also that when such things are done, as it were\r\nthrough an ouer-hasty constraint, there cannot proceede any thing but\r\nabortiuenesse, and a distastfull rellish: from whence I thinke it comes\r\nto passe that in London a man shall very seldome tast a delicate or well\r\nrellisht Plumbe, vnlesse it be from such as hauing fruit of their owne,\r\nmake no commoditie thereof more then their owne pleasures: yet thus much\r\nI would perswade euery one, that if they haue moe Plumbes ripe at once\r\nthen they can vse, or spend, that then after they are gathered, to\r\nspread them thinnely vpon Nettles or Vine-tree leaues, and it will\r\npreserue them sound and well coloured a long time together, but if your\r\nstore be so superabundant that in no reasonable time you can spend\r\nthem, then what you doe not preserue, or make Godiniake, or Maruulade\r\nof, the rest you shall take and sprinkling them ouer with sweet-worte,\r\nor growt, and then laying them one by one (yet so as they may not touch\r\none another) vpon hurdles or fleakes made of wands, or twigges, and put\r\nthem into an Ouen after bread or Pyes haue beene taine thereout, and so\r\nleasurely dry them, and they will not onely last, but tast pleasantly\r\nall the yeere after: and in this sort you may vse all kindes of Plumbes,\r\nor Peares, whatsoeuer. Now for the gathering of the other ordinary sorts\r\nof vngrafted Plumbes, which haue both much stronger rindes, and are\r\nlesse subiect to rotting, you shall gather them, carry, or transport\r\nthem, in the same manner that you did your Cherries, onely in these, as\r\nin all other sorts of fruit whatsoeuer, you shall not omit neuer to\r\ngather, or pull them from the tree, till the dewe be dryed cleane both\r\nfrom the grasse and from the trees, and that the day be dry, faire, and\r\nfull of sunne-shine: for the least wet or moisture doth canker and rot\r\nthe fruit.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the gathering of Peares.}\r\nAs touching the gathering of Peares, though sundry Fruiterrers obserue\r\nsundry wayes in gathering them, as some making more hast then\r\ngood-speed, as either to haue the first tast, or the first profit, some\r\nvsing more negligence, thincking their store so great it will neuer be\r\nconsumed, and some so curious that they will not gather till the Peares\r\nfall into their bosomes, all which are dispraiseable fashions, yet I for\r\nmy part would euer aduise all diligent husbands to obserue a\r\nmediocritie, and take the fittest season for the gathering of his fruit:\r\nas thus for example. If because you are vnexperienced or vnacquainted\r\nwith the fruit you doe not know the due time of his ripening, you shall\r\nobserue the colour of the Peare, and if you see it doe alter, either in\r\npart, or in all, you shall be assured the fruit is neare ripening, for\r\nPeares doe neuer change their colours, but when they doe desire to be\r\ntaken from the tree: and of all fruit the Peare may be gathered the\r\nhardest, because both his owne naturall heate and peculiar quallittie\r\nwill ripen him best with lying: yet to be more strongly fortefied in the\r\nknowledge of the ripenesse of your fruit, and because it is better to\r\nget a day too late, then an hower to earely, you shall before you gather\r\nyour Peares, whether they be Summer fruit or Winter fruit, or whether\r\nyou meane to spend them soone or preserue them long, take one of them\r\nfrom the tree, which is neither the ripest nor the greenest, but betwixt\r\nboth, and cut it through the midst with your knife, not longwise, but\r\nouerthwart, and then looke into the coare where the kirnells lye, and if\r\nit be hollow so as the kirnells lye as it were hollow therein, the\r\nneather ends thereof being turned either blacke, or blackish, albeit the\r\ncomplexion of the Peare be little, or not at all altered, yet the Peares\r\nhaue their full growth, and may very well be gathered: then laying them\r\neither vpon a bedde of ferne, or straw, one vpon another, in great\r\nthicknesse, their owne naturall heate will in short space ripen them,\r\nwhich you shall perceiue both by the speedy changing of their colour, &\r\nthe strength of their smell, which will be exceeding suffocating, which\r\nas soone as you perceiue, you shall then spread them thinner and\r\nthinner, vntill they be all ripe, and then lay them one by one, in such\r\nsort as they may not touch one another, and then they will last much the\r\nlonger, you shall also after they be ripe, neither suffer them to haue\r\nstraw nor ferne vnder them, but lay them either vpon some smooth table,\r\nboards or fleakes of wands, and they will last the longer.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of transporting, or carrying of Peares farre.}\r\nIf you be to carry or transport Peares farre, you shall then gather them\r\nso much the sooner, and not suffer any ripe one to be amongst them, and\r\nthen lyning great wicker baskets (such as will hould at least quarters a\r\npeece) finely within with white-straw, fill them vp with Peares, and\r\nthen couer them with straw, and corde them aboue, and you may either\r\ntransport them by land or Sea, whether you please, for they will ripen\r\nin their cariage: but when you come to your place of residence, then you\r\nmust needs vnpacke them and spread them thinner, or else they will rot\r\nand consume in a sodaine.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of gathering diuersly.}\r\nThere be sundry wayes of gathering Peares, or other fruit, as namely, to\r\nclimbe into the tree and to haue a basket with a line fastned thereto,\r\nand so when it is filled to let it downe, and cause it to be emptied,\r\nwhich labour though some of our southerne Fruiterers doe not much\r\ncommend, yet for mine owne part I doe not see much errour therein, but\r\nthat it is both allowable and conuenient, both because it neither\r\nbruiseth the fruit, nor putteth the gatherer to any extraordinary\r\nlabour, onely the imaginary euill is, that by climbing vp into the tree,\r\nhee that gathereth the fruit may indanger the breaking, slipping, and\r\ndisbranching of many of the young cyons, which breedeth much hurt and\r\ndamage to the tree, but iudgement, and care, which ought to be\r\napropriate to men of this quallitie, is a certaine preuenter of all such\r\nmischeifes. Now for such as in gathering of their fruit doe euery time\r\nthat the basket is full bring it downe themselues from the tree, and\r\nempty it by powring the fruit rudely, and boystrously forth, or for\r\nbeating of fruit downe with long poales, loggets, or such like, they are\r\nboth most vilde and preposterous courses, the first being full of too\r\nmuch foolish and carelesse trouble, the latter of too much disorder, &\r\ncruelty, ruyning in a moment what hath beene many yeeres in building: as\r\nfor the climbing the tree with a ladder, albeit it be a very good way\r\nfor the gathering of fruit, yet if it be neuer so little indiscreetly\r\nhandled, it as much hazardeth the breaking and bruising both of the\r\nfruit and the small cyons, as either climbing the tree, or any other way\r\nwhatsoeuer.\r\n\r\n{SN: The gathering of Apples.}\r\nNow for the gathering of your Apples: you shall vnderstand that your\r\nsummer fruit, as your Ieniting, Wibourne, and such like, are first to be\r\ngathered, whose ripenesse, you may partly know by the change of colour,\r\npartly by the pecking of Birds, but cheifely by the course formerly\r\ndiscribed for your knowledge of the ripenesse of the Peare, which is the\r\nhollownesse of coare, and liberty of the kirnell onely, and when you\r\ndoe perceiue they are ripe, you shall gather them in such wise as hath\r\nbeene declared for the gathering of your Peares, without respecting the\r\nstate of the Moone, or any such like obseruation, but when you come to\r\ngather your Winter-fruit, which is the Pippin, Peare-maine, Russetting,\r\nBlacke-annat, and such like, you shall in any wise gather them in the\r\nwane of the Moone, and, as before I said, in the dryest season that may\r\nbe, and if it be so that your store be so great that you cannot gather\r\nall in that season, yet you shall get so much of your principall fruit,\r\nthe youngest and fairest, as is possible to be gotten, and preserue it\r\nfor the last which you intend either to spend, or vtter. Now for the\r\nmanner of gathering your Apples I doe not thinke you can amend or\r\napproue a better way then that which hath beene discribed for the\r\ngathering of Peares, yet some of our late practitioners (who thinke\r\nthemselues not cunning if they be not curious) dislike that way, and\r\nwill onely haue a gathering apron, into which hauing gathered their\r\nfruit, they doe empty it into larger vessells: this gathering apron is a\r\nstrong peece of Canuas at least an ell euery way, which hauing the vpper\r\nend made fast about a mans necke, & the neather end with three loopes,\r\nthat is, one at each corner, & one in the midst, through which you shall\r\nput a string, and binde it about your waste, in so much that both the\r\nsides of your apron being open you may put your fruit therein with which\r\nhand you please: this manner of gathering Apples is not amisse, yet in\r\nmy conceit the apron is so small a defence for the Apples, that if it\r\ndoe but knocke against the boughes as you doe moue your selfe, it cannot\r\nchuse but bruise the fruit very much, which ought euer to be auoyded:\r\ntherefore still I am of this opinion, there is no better way, safer, nor\r\nmore easie, then gathering them into a small basket, with a long line\r\nthereat, as hath beene before declared in the gathering of Peares. Now\r\nyou shall carefully obserue in empting one basket into another, that you\r\ndoe it so gently as may be, least in powring them out too rudely the\r\nstalkes of the fruit doe pricke one another, which although it doe\r\nappeare little or nothing at the first, yet it is the first ground,\r\ncause, and beginning of rottennesse, and therefore you shall to your\r\nvttermost power gather your Apples with as small stalkes as may be, so\r\nthey haue any at all, which they must needes haue, because that as too\r\nbigge stalkes doth pricke and bruise the fruit, so to haue none at all\r\nmakes the fruit rot first in the place where the stalke should be: you\r\nshall also keepe your fruit cleane from leaues, for they being greene\r\nand full of moisture, when by reason of their lying close together they\r\nbeginne to wither they strike such an heate into the Apples, that they\r\nmil-dew and rot instantly.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Fallings.}\r\n{SN: Of carriage and keeping Fruit.}\r\nAs touching your Fallings, which are those Apples which fall from your\r\ntrees, either through too much ripenesse, or else through the violence\r\nof winde, or tempests, you shall by no meanes match them, or mixe them,\r\nwith your gathered fruit, for they can by no meanes last or indure so\r\nlong, for the latter which falleth by force of winde, wanting the true\r\nnourishment of the earth and the kindly ripening vpon the tree, must\r\nnecessarily shrinke wither, and grow riuelled, so that your best course\r\nis to spend them presently, with all speede possible: for the other\r\nwhich hath too much ripenesse from the earth, and the tree, though it be\r\nmuch better then the other, yet it cannot be long lasting, both because\r\nit is in the falling bruised, and also hath too much ripenesse, which is\r\nthe first steppe to rottennesse, so that they must likewise be spent\r\nwith all expedition. For the carriage of your Apples, if the place be\r\nnot farre whether you should carry them, you shall then in those large\r\nbaskets into which you last emptied them, carry them vpon cole-staues,\r\nor stangs, betwixt two men, and hauing brought them carefully into your\r\nApple-loft, power them downe gently vpon bedds of ferne or straw, and\r\nlay them in reasonable large heapes, euery sort of Apples seuerall by\r\nthemselues, without mixture, or any confusion: and for such Apples as\r\nyou would haue to ripen soone, you shall couer them all ouer with ferne\r\nalso, but for such as you would haue take all possible leasure in\r\nripening, those you shall lay neither vpon ferne, nor straw, but vpon\r\nthe bare boards, nay, if you lay them vpon a plaster floare (which is of\r\nall floares the coldest) till Saint Andrewes tide, it is not amisse, but\r\nvery profitable, and the thinner you lay them so much the better. Now if\r\nyou haue any farre iourney to carry your Apples, either by land, or by\r\nwater, then trimming and lyning the insides of your baskets with ferne,\r\nor wheat-straw wouen as it were cleane through the basket, you shall\r\npacke, couer, and cord vp your Apples, in such sort as you did your\r\nPeares, and there is no danger in the transportation of them, be it by\r\nshippe, cart, waggon, or horse-backe. If you be inforced to packe sundry\r\nsorts of Apples in one basket, see that betwixt euery sort you lay a\r\ndiuision of straw, or ferne, that when they are vnpackt, you may lay\r\nthem againe seuerally: but if when they are vnpackt, for want of roome\r\nyou are compeld to lay some sorts together, in any wise obserue to mixe\r\nthose sorts together which are nearest of taste, likest of colour, and\r\nall of one continuance in lasting: as for the packing vp of fruit in\r\nhogsheads, or shooting them vnder hatches when you transport them by\r\nSea, I like neither of the courses, for the first is too close, and\r\nnothing more then the want of ayre doth rot fruit, the other is subiect\r\nto much wet, when the breach of euery Sea indangereth the washing of the\r\nApples, and nothing doth more certainely spoyle them. The times most\r\nvnseasonable for the transporting of fruit, is either in the month of\r\nMarch, or generally in any frosty weather, for if the sharpe coldenesse\r\nof those ayres doe touch the fruit, it presently makes them looke\r\nblacke, and riuelled, so that there is no hope of their continuance.\r\n\r\nThe place where you shall lay your fruit must neither be too open, nor\r\ntoo close, yet rather close then open, it must by no meanes be low vpon\r\nthe ground, nor in any place of moistnesse: for moisture breedes\r\nfustinesse, and such naughty smells easily enter into the fruit, and\r\ntaint the rellish thereof, yet if you haue no other place but some low\r\ncellar to lay your fruit in, then you shall raise shelues round about,\r\nthe nearest not within two foote of the ground, and lay your Apples\r\nthereupon, hauing them first lyned, either with sweet Rye-straw,\r\nWheate-straw, or dry ferne: as these vndermost roomes are not the best,\r\nso are the vppermost, if they be vnseeld, the worst of all other,\r\nbecause both the sunne, winde, and weather, peircing through the tiles,\r\ndoth annoy and hurt the fruit: the best roome then is a well seeld\r\nchamber, whose windowes may be shut and made close at pleasure, euer\r\nobseruing with straw to defend the fruit from any moist stone wall, or\r\ndusty mudde wall, both which are dangerous annoyances.\r\n\r\n{SN: The seperating of Fruit.}\r\nNow for the seperating of your fruit, you shall lay those nearest hand,\r\nwhich are first to be spent, as those which will last but till\r\nAlhallontide, as the Cisling, Wibourne, and such like, by themselues:\r\nthose which will last till Christmas, as the Costard, Pome-water,\r\nQueene-Apple, and such like: those which will last till Candlemas, as\r\nthe Pome-de-roy, Goose-Apple, and such like, and those which will last\r\nall the yeere, as the Pippin, Duzin, Russetting, Peare-maine, and such\r\nlike, euery one in his seuerall place, & in such order that you may\r\npasse from bed to bed to clense or cast forth those which be rotten or\r\nputrefied at your pleasure, which with all diligence you must doe,\r\nbecause those which are tainted will soone poyson the other, and\r\ntherefore it is necessary as soone as you see any of them tainted, not\r\nonely to cull them out, but also to looke vpon all the rest, and deuide\r\nthem into three parts, laying the soundest by themselues, those which\r\nare least tainted by themselues, and those which are most tainted by\r\nthemselues, and so to vse them all to your best benefit.\r\n\r\nNow for the turning of your longest lasting fruit, you shall know that\r\nabout the latter end of December is the best time to beginne, if you\r\nhaue both got and kept them in such sort as is before sayd, and not mixt\r\nfruit of more earely ripening amongst them: the second time you shall\r\nturne them, shall be about the end of February, and so consequently once\r\neuery month, till Penticost, for as the yeere time increaseth in heate\r\nso fruit growes more apt to rot: after Whitsontide you shall turne them\r\nonce euery fortnight, alwayes in your turning making your heapes thinner\r\nand thinner; but if the weather be frosty then stirre not your fruit at\r\nall, neither when the thaw is, for then the fruit being moist may by no\r\nmeanes be touched: also in wet weather fruit will be a little dankish,\r\nso that then it must be forborne also, and therefore when any such\r\nmoistnesse hapneth, it is good to open your windowes and let the ayre\r\ndry your fruit before it be turned: you may open your windowe any time\r\nof the yeere in open weather, as long as the sunne is vpon the skye, but\r\nnot after, except in March onely, at what time the ayre and winde is so\r\nsharpe that it tainteth and riuelleth all sorts of fruits whatsoeuer.\r\n\r\n{SN: To keepe Fruit in frost.}\r\nIf the frost be very extreame, and you feare the indangering your fruit,\r\nit is good to couer them somewhat thicke with fine hay, or else to lay\r\nthem couered all ouer either in Barley-chaffe, or dry Salte: as for the\r\nlaying them in chests of Iuniper, or Cipresse, it is but a toy, and not\r\nworth the practise: if you hang Apples in nettes within the ayre of the\r\nfire it will keepe them long, but they will be dry and withered, and\r\nwill loose their best rellish.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Wardens.}\r\nNow for the gathering, keeping, ordering, and preseruing of Wardens,\r\nthey are in all sorts and in all respects to be vsed as you doe vse your\r\nPeares, onely you are to consider that they are a fruit of a much\r\nstronger constitution, haue a much thicker skinne, and will endure much\r\nharder season: neither ought you to seeke to ripen them in hast, or\r\nbefore the ordinary time of their owne nature, and therefore to them you\r\nshall vse neither straw, ferne, nor hay, but onely dry boards to lay\r\nthem vpon, and no otherwise.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Medlars and Seruices.}\r\nFor your Medlars, you shall gather them about the midst of October,\r\nafter such time as the frost hath nipt and bitten them, for before they\r\nwill not be ready, or loosen from the stalke, and then they will be\r\nnothing ripe, but as hard as stones, for they neuer ripen vpon the tree,\r\ntherefore as soone as you haue gathered them, you shall packe them into\r\nsome close vessell, and couer them all ouer, and round about, with\r\nthicke woollen cloathes, and about the cloathes good store of hay, and\r\nsome other waight of boards, or such like vpon them, all which must\r\nbring them into an extreame heate, without which they will neuer ripen\r\nkindely, because their ripenesse is indeed perfect rottennesse: and\r\nafter they haue layne thus, at least a fornight, you shall then looke\r\nvpon them, and turning them ouer, such as you finde ripe you shall take\r\naway, the rest you shall let remaine still, for they will not ripen all\r\nat once, and those which are halfe ripe you shall also remoue into a\r\nthird place, least if you should keepe them together, they should\r\nbeginne to grow mouldy before the other were ready; and in the selfe\r\nsame manner as you vse your Medlars, so you shall vse your Seruices, and\r\nthey will ripen most kindely: or if you please to sticke them betwixt\r\nlarge clouen stickes, and to sprinckle a little olde beare vpon them,\r\nand so set them in a close roome, they will ripen as kindely as any\r\nother way whatsoeuer.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Quinces.}\r\nNow for Quinces, they are a fruit which by no meanes you may place neare\r\nany other kinde of fruit, because their sent is so strong and peircing,\r\nthat it will enter into any fruit, and cleane take way his naturall\r\nrellish: the time of their gathering is euer in October, and the meetest\r\nplace to lay them in is where they may haue most ayre, so they may lye\r\ndry (for wet they can by no meanes indure,) also they must not lye\r\nclose, because the smell of them is both strong & vnwholsome: the beds\r\nwhereon they must lye must be of sweet straw, and you must both turne\r\nthem and shift them very often, or else they will rot speedily: for the\r\ntransporting or carying them any long iourney, you must vse them in all\r\nthings as you vse your Peares, & the carriage will be safe.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Nuts.}\r\nFor Nuts, of what sort soeuer they be, you shall know they are ripe as\r\nsoone as you perceiue them a little browne within the huske, or as it\r\nwere ready to fall out of the same, the skill therefore in preseruing of\r\nthem long from drynesse, is all that can be desired at the Fruiterers\r\nhands: for as touching the gathering of them, there is no scruple to be\r\nobserued, more then to gather them cleane from the tree, with the helpe\r\nof hookes and such like, for as touching the bruising of them, the shell\r\nis defence sufficient. After they be gathered, you shall shale them, and\r\ntake them cleane out of their huskes, and then for preseruing them from\r\neither Wormes or drynesse, it shall be good to lay them in some low\r\ncellar, where you may couer them with sand, being first put into great\r\nbagges or bladders: some french-men are of opinion that if you put them\r\ninto vessels made of Wal-nut-tree, and mixe Iuy-berries amongst them, it\r\nwill preserue them moist a long time: others thinke, but I haue found it\r\nvncertaine, that to preserue Nuts in Honey will keepe them all the yeere\r\nas greene, moist, and pleasant, as when they hung vpon the tree: The\r\nDutch-men vse (and it is an excellent practise) to take the crusht\r\nCrabbes (after your verdiuyce is strained out of them) and to mixe it\r\nwith their Nuts, and so to lay them in heapes, and it will preserue them\r\nlong: or otherwise if they be to be transported, to put them into\r\nbarrells and to lay one layre of crusht Crabbes, and another of Nuts,\r\nvntill the barrell be filled, and then to close them vp, and set them\r\nwhere they may stand coole. But aboue all these foresayd experiments,\r\nthe best way for the preseruing of Nuts is to put them into cleane\r\nearthen pots, and to mixe with them good store of salt and then closing\r\nthe pots close, to set them in some coole cellar, and couer them all\r\nouer with sand, and there is no doubt but they will keepe coole,\r\npleasant, and moist, vntill new come againe, which is a time fully\r\nconuenient.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Grapes.}\r\nNow to conclude, for the keeping of Grapes, you shall first vnderstand\r\nthat the best time for their gathering is in the wane of the Moone, and\r\nabout the midst of October, as for the knowledge of his ripenesse it is\r\neuer at such time as his first colour is cleane altered, for all Grapes\r\nbefore they be ripe are of a deepe, thicke, greene, colour, but after\r\nthey be ripe, they are either of a blewish redde, or of a bright shining\r\npale greene. Now for the preseruing them for our english vse, which is\r\nbut onely for a fruit-dish at our Tables, for neither our store, nor our\r\nsoyle, affords vs any for the wine-presse, some thinke it good, after\r\nthey are gotten, to lay them in fine dry sand, or to glasse them vp in\r\nclose glasses, where the ayre cannot peirce, will keepe them long, both\r\nfull, plumpe, and sweet, but in my conceit the best course is after they\r\nare gotten to hang them vpon strings bunch by bunch, in such places of\r\nyour house as they may take the ayre of the fire, and they will last\r\nlongest, and keepe the sweetest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\n_Of the making of Cyder, or Perry._\r\n\r\n\r\nCyder is a certaine liquor or drinke made of the iuyce of Apples, and\r\nPerrye the like, made of Peares, they are of great vse in France, and\r\nvery wholsome for mans body, especially at the Sea, and in hot\r\nCountries: for they are coole and purgatiue, and doe preuent burning\r\nagues: with vs here in England Cyder is most made in the West parts, as\r\nabout Deuon-shire & Cornwaile, & Perry in Worcester-shire,\r\nGlocester-shire, & such like, where indeede the greatest store of those\r\nkindes of fruits are to be found: the manner of making them is, after\r\nyour fruit is gotten, you shall take euery Apple, or Peare, by it selfe,\r\nand looking vpon them, picke them cleane from all manner of filthinesse,\r\nas bruisings, rottennesse, worme-eating, and such like, neither leaue\r\nvpon them any stalkes, or the blacke buddes which are and grow vpon the\r\ntops of the fruit, which done you shall put them in to some very cleane\r\nvessell, or trough, and with beetells, made for the purpose, bruise or\r\ncrush the Apples or Peares in peeces, & so remoue them into other cleane\r\nvessells, till all the fruit be bruised: then take a bagge of\r\nhayre-cloath, made at least a yard, or three quarters, square, and\r\nfilling it full of the crusht fruit, put it in a presse of woode, made\r\nfor the purpose, and presse out all the iuyce and moisture out of the\r\nfruit, turning and tossing the bagge vp and downe, vntill there be no\r\nmore moisture to runne forth, and so baggefull after baggefull cease not\r\nvntill you haue prest all: wherein you are especially to obserue, that\r\nyour vessells into which you straine your fruit be exceeding neate,\r\nsweet, and cleane, and there be no place of ill fauour, or annoyance\r\nneare them, for the liquour is most apt, especially Cyder, to take any\r\ninfection. As soone as your liquor is prest forth and hath stoode to\r\nsettle, about twelue houres, you shall then turne it vp into sweet\r\nhogsheads, as those which haue had in them last, either White-wine or\r\nClarret, as for the Sacke vessell it is tollerable, but not excellent:\r\nyou may also if you please make a small long bagge of fine linnen\r\ncloath, and filling it full of the powder of Cloues, Mace, Cynamon,\r\nGinger, and the dry pils of Lemons, and hang it with a string at the\r\nbung-hole into the vessell, and it will make either the Cyder, or Perry,\r\nto tast as pleasantly as if it were Renish-wine, and this being done you\r\nshall clay vp the bung-hole with clay and salt mixt together, so close\r\nas is possible. And thus much for the making of Perry or Cyder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\n_Of the Hoppe-garden, and first of the ground and situation thereof._\r\n\r\n\r\n{SN: Fit ground for Hoppes.}\r\nThat the Hoppe is of great vse and commoditie in this kingdome, both the\r\nBeare, which is the generall and perfect drinke of our Nation, and our\r\ndayly traffique, both with France, the low-Countries, and other nations,\r\nfor this commoditie, is a continuall testimony, wherefore the first\r\nthing to be considered of in this worke, is the goodnesse and aptnesse\r\nof the ground for the bringing forth of the fruit thereof, wherein I\r\nthus farre consent with Maister _Scot_, that I doe not so much respect\r\nthe writings, opinions, and demonstrations, of the Greeke, Latine, or\r\nFrench authors, who neuer were acquainted with our soyles, as I doe the\r\ndayly practise and experience which I collect, both from my owne\r\nknowledge, and the labours of others my Countrymen, best seene and\r\napproued in this Art: therefore to come to my purpose, you shal\r\nvnderstand that the light sand, whether it be redde or white, being\r\nsimple and vnmixed is most vnfit for the planting of Hoppes, because\r\nthat through the barrainenesse, it neither hath comfort for the roote,\r\nnor through his seperate lightnesse, any strong hould to maintaine and\r\nkeepe vp the poales: likewise the most fertill rich, blacke clay, which\r\nof all soyles is the best and most fruitfull, is not to be allowed for a\r\nHoppe garden, because his fatnesse and iuyce is so strong that the roote\r\nbeing as it were ouer-fedde, doth make the branches bring forth leaues\r\nin such infinite abundance that they leaue neither strength nor place\r\nfor the fruit, either to knit, or put forth his treasure, as I haue\r\nseene by experience in many places: as for the earth which is of a\r\nmorish, blacke, wet nature, and lyeth low, although I haue often times\r\nseene good Hoppes to grow thereupon, being well trencht, and the hils\r\ncast high to the best aduantage, yet it is not the principall ground of\r\nall others, because it is neuer long lasting, but apt to decay and grow\r\npast his strength of bearing. The grounds then which I haue generally\r\nseene to beare the best Hoppes, and whose natures doe the longest\r\ncontinue with such fruit, are those mixt earthes which are clayes with\r\nclayes, as blacke with white, or clayes and sands of any sorts, wherein\r\nthe soyle is so corrected as neither too much fatnesse doth suffocate,\r\nnor too much leannesse doth pine: for I had euer rather haue my\r\nHoppe-garden desire increase, then continually labour in abatement. And\r\nalthough some doe exceedingly condemne the chauke-ground for this vse,\r\nyet I haue not at any time seene better Hoppes, or in more plenty, then\r\nin such places, as at this day may be seene in many places about\r\nHartford-shire. To conclude, though your best mixt earths bring forth\r\nthe best Hoppes, yet there is no soyle, or earth, of what nature soeuer\r\nit be (if it lye free from inundation) but will bring forth good Hoppes,\r\nif it be put into the hands of an experienced workman.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the Situation.}\r\nNow, for the situation or site of your Hoppe-garden: you shall so neare\r\nas you can place it neare some couer or shelter, as either of hils,\r\nhouses, high-walles, woodes or trees, so those woodes or trees be not so\r\nneare that they may drop vpon your Hoppe hils, for that will kill them:\r\nalso the nearer it is planted to your dwelling house it is somuch the\r\nbetter, both because the vigilance of your owne eye is a good guarde\r\nthereunto, and also the labours of your work-Maister will be more\r\ncarefull and diligent. A Hop-garden as it delighteth much in the\r\npleasantnesse of the sunne, so it cannot endure by any meanes, the\r\nsharpenesse of the windes, frosts, or Winter weather, and therefore your\r\nonely care is your defence and shelter. For the bignesse of your ground,\r\nit must be ordered according to your abillitie or place of trade for\r\nthat commoditie, for if you shall haue them but for your owne vse, then\r\na roode or two roodes will be inough, albeit your house keeping match\r\nwith Nobillitie: but if you haue them for a more particuler profit,\r\nthen you may take an Aker, two or three, according to your owne\r\ndiscretion; wherein you shall euer keepe these obseruations: that one\r\nmans labour cannot attend aboue two thousand fiue hundred hils, that\r\neuery roode will beare two hundred and fiftie hils, euery hill beare at\r\nleast two pounds and an halfe of Hoppes, (which is the iust quantitie\r\nthat will serue to brew one quarter of Malt) and that euery hundred\r\nwaight of Hoppes, is at the least, in a reasonable yeere, worth\r\nfoure-nobles the hundred: so that euery roode of ground thus imployed,\r\ncannot be lesse worth, at the meanest reckoning, then sixe pounds by the\r\nyeere: for if the ground be principall good for the purpose, and well\r\nordered, the profit will be much greater, in as much as the bells of the\r\nHoppes will be much greater, full, and more waighty: And thus much for\r\nthe ground and situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\n_Of the ordering of the Garden, and placing of the Hils._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soone as you haue chosen out your platforme of ground, you shal\r\neither by ploughing, or digging, or by both, make it as flat & leuell as\r\nis possible, vnlesse it be any thing subiect vnto water, and then you\r\nshall giue it some small desent, and with little trenches conuaye the\r\nwater from annoying it: you shall also the yeere before you either make\r\nhill or plant it with Hoppe-rootes, sowe it all ouer with hempe, which\r\nwill not onely kill, and stifle all sorts of weeds, but also rot the\r\ngreene-swarth, and make the mould mellow, and apt to receiue the rootes\r\nwhen they come to be planted.\r\n\r\nNow, as soone as your ground is thus prepared, you shall then take a\r\nline, and with it measure your ground ouerthwart, and to euery hill\r\nallow at least three foote of ground euery way, and betwixt hill and\r\nhill, at the least sixe foote distance: and when you haue marked thus\r\nthe number of thirty or forty places, where your hils shall be placed,\r\nintending euer that the time of yeere for this worke must be about the\r\nbeginning of Aprill, you shall then in the center, or midde part of\r\nthese places made for the site of your hils, digge small square holes of\r\na foote square each way, and a full foote deepe, and in these holes you\r\nshall set your Hoppe-rootes, that is to say, in euery hole at least\r\nthree rootes, and these three rootes you shall ioyne together in such\r\nwise that the toppes of them may be of one equall height, and agreeing\r\nwith the face or vpper part of the earth, you shall set them straight\r\nand vpright, and not seperating them, as many doe, and setting at each\r\ncorner of the hole a roote, neither shall you twist them, and set both\r\nends vpward, nor lay them flat or crosse-wise in the earth, neither\r\nshall you make the hils first and set the rootes after, nor immediately\r\nvpon the setting cast great hils vpon them, all which are very vilde\r\nwayes for the setting of Hoppes, but, as before I sayd, hauing ioyned\r\nyour rootes together, you shall place them straight and vpright, and so\r\nholding them in one hand, with the other put the moulds close, firme,\r\nand perfectly about them, especially to each corner of the hole, which\r\ndone you shall likewise couer the sets themselues all ouer with fine\r\nmoulds, at least two fingers thicke, and in this sort you shall plant\r\nall your garden quite ouer, making the sites for your hill to stand in\r\nrowes and rankes, in such order that you may haue euery way betweene the\r\nhils small alleyes and passages, wherein you may goe at pleasure from\r\nhill to hill, without any trouble or annoyance, according to that forme\r\nwhich I haue before prescribed touching the placing of your Apple-trees\r\nin each seuerall quarter in your Orchard: and herein you are to\r\nvnderstand, that in this first yeere of planting your Hoppe-garden you\r\nshall by no meanes fashion or make any great hils, but onely raise that\r\npart of the earth where your plants are set, some two or three fingers\r\nhigher then the ordinary ground.\r\n\r\n{SN: The choise of Rootes.}\r\nNow, before I proceede any further, I thinke it not amisse to speake\r\nsome thing touching the choise, gathering and trimming of Hoppe-rootes:\r\nwherefore you shall vnderstand that about the latter end of March is the\r\nbest gathering of Hoppe-rootes, which so neare as you can you shall\r\nselect out of some garden of good reputation, which is both carefully\r\nkept, and by a man of good knowledge, for there euery thing being\r\npreserued in his best perfection, the rootes will be the greatest and\r\nmost apt to take: and in the choise of your rootes you shall euer chuse\r\nthose which are the greatest, as namely, such as are at the least three\r\nor foure inches about, & ten inches long, let euery roote containe about\r\nthree ioynts, and no more, and in any case let them be the cyons of the\r\nlast yeeres growth: if they be perfectly good they haue a great greene\r\nstalke with redde streakes, and a hard, broad, long, greene, bell; if\r\nthey be otherwise, as namely, wilde-Hoppes, then they are small and\r\nslender, like thriddes, their colour is all redde, euen when it is at\r\nleast three yards high, whereas the best Hoppe carieth his reddish\r\ncolour not three foote from the earth. Now hauing gotten such rootes as\r\nare good and fit for your purpose, if the season of the weather, or\r\nother necessitie hinder you from presently setting them, you shall then\r\neither lay them in some puddle, neare to your garden, or else bury them\r\nin the ground, vntill fit time for their planting: and of the two it is\r\nbetter to bury them then lay them in puddle, because if you so let them\r\nlye aboue xxiiij. houres, the rootes will be spoyled.\r\n\r\nNow after you haue in manner aforeshewed, planted your garden with\r\nrootes, it shall not be amisse, if the place be apt to such annoyance,\r\nto pricke vpon the site of euery hill a few sharpe Thornes to defend\r\nthem from the scratching of poultry, or such like, which euer are busie\r\nto doe mischeife: yet of all house-fowle Geese be the worst, but if your\r\nfence be as it ought, high, strong, and close, it will both preuent\r\ntheir harme and this labour.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Poales.}\r\nNext vnto this worke is the placing of Poales, of which we will first\r\nspeake of the choise thereof, wherein if I discent from the opinion of\r\nother men, yet imagine I set downe no Oracle, but referre you to the\r\nexperience or the practise, and so make your owne discreation the\r\narbiter betweene our discentions. It is the opinion of some, that\r\nAlder-poales are most proper and fit for the Hoppe-garden, both that the\r\nHoppe taketh, as they say, a certaine naturall loue to that woode, as\r\nalso that the roughnesse of the rinde is a stay & benefit to the growth\r\nof the Hoppe: to all which I doe not disagree, but that there should be\r\nfound Alder-poales of that length, as namely, xvj. or xviij. foote long,\r\nnine, or ten, inches in compasse, and with all rush-growne, straight,\r\nand fit for this vse, seemeth to mee as much as a miracle, because in my\r\nlife I haue not beheld the like, neither doe I thinke our kingdome can\r\nafford it, vnlesse in some such especiall place where they are purposely\r\nkept and maintained, more to shew the art of their maintenance, then the\r\nexcellency of their natures: in this one benefit, and doutlesse where\r\nthey are so preserued, the cost of their preseruation amounteth to more\r\nthan the goodnesse of their extraordinary quallitie, which mine author\r\ndefends to the contrary, giuing them a larger prerogatiue, in that they\r\nare cheaper to the purse, more profitable to the plant, and lesse\r\nconsumption to the common-wealth: but I greatly doubt in the\r\napprobation, and therefore mine aduise is not to rely onely vpon the\r\nAlder, and for his preheminence imagine all other poales insufficient:\r\nbut be assured that either, the Oake-poale, the Ashe, the Beeche, the\r\nAspe, or Maple, are euery way as good, as profitable, and by many\r\ndegrees much longer lasting.\r\n\r\n{SN: The proportion of the Poale.}\r\n{SN: Of cutting and erecting Poales.}\r\nNow, if it be so that you happen to liue in the champian Country, as for\r\nthe most part Northampton shire, Oxford-shire, some parts of Leycester\r\nand Rutland are, or in the wet and low Countries, as Holland, and Kesten\r\nin Lincolne-shire, or the Ile of Elye in Cambridge-shire, all which\r\nplaces are very barraine of woode, and yet excellent soyles to beare\r\nHoppes, rather then to loose the commoditie of the Hoppe-garden I wish\r\nyou to plant great store of Willowes, which will afforde you poales as\r\nsufficient as any of the other whatsoeuer, onely they are not so long\r\nlasting, and yet with carefull and dry keeping, I haue seene them last\r\nfull out seauen yeeres, a time reasonably sufficient for any young\r\nwoode, for such a vse. Thus you see the curiositie is not very great of\r\nwhat woode so euer your poale be, so it be of young and cleane growth,\r\nrush-growne, (that is to say, biggest at the neather end) eighteene\r\nfoote in length, and ten inches in compasse. These poales you shall cut\r\nand prepare betwixt the feast of Al-Saints, and Christmas, and so pile\r\nthem vp in some dry place, where they may take no wet, vntill it be\r\nmidde-Aprill, at which time (your Hoppes being shot out of the ground at\r\nleast three quarters of a yarde, so that you may discerne the principall\r\ncyons which issue from the principall rootes) you shall then bring your\r\npoales into the garden, and lay them along in the alleyes, by euery hill\r\nso many poales as shall be sufficient for the maine branches, which\r\nhappely the first yeere will not be aboue two or three poales at the\r\nmost to a hill, but in processe of time more, as foure or fiue,\r\naccording to the prosperitie of the plants, and the largenesse of the\r\nhils. After you haue thus layd your poales, you shall then beginne to\r\nset them vp in this sort: first, you shall take a gaue-locke, or crow of\r\niron, and strike it into the earth so neare vnto the roote of the Hoppe\r\nas is possible, prouided alwayes that you doe not bruise, or touch the\r\nroote, and so stroake after stroake, cease not striking till you haue\r\nmade a hoale at least two foote deepe, and make them a little slantwise\r\ninward towards the hill, that the poales in their standing may shoote\r\noutwards and hould their greatest distance in the toppes: this done you\r\nshall place the poales in those hoales, thus made with the iron crow,\r\nand with another peece of woode, made rammer-wise, that is to say, as\r\nbigge at the neather end as the biggest part of the poale, or somewhat\r\nmore, you shall ramme in the poales, and beate the earth firme and hard\r\nabout them: alwayes prouided, that you touch not any branch, or as\r\nlittle as you may beate with your rammer within betweene the poales,\r\nonely on the out-side make them so fast that the winde, or weather, may\r\nnot disorder or blow them downe: then lay to the bottome of euery poale\r\nthe branch which shall ascend it, and you shall see in a short space,\r\nhow out of their owne natures, they will imbrace and climbe about them.\r\n\r\nNow, if it happen after your Hoppes are growne vp, yet not come to their\r\nfull perfection, that any of your poales chance to breake, you shall\r\nthen take a new poale, and with some soft greene rushes, or the inmost\r\ngreene barke of an Alder-tree, tye the toppe of the Hoppe to the toppe\r\nof the new poale, then draw the broken poale out of the Hoppe (I meane\r\nthat part which being broken lyeth vpon the ground) and as you saw it\r\ndid winde about the olde poale (which is euer the same way that the\r\nsunne runnes) so you shall winde it about the new poale: then loosening\r\nthe earth a little from the neather part of the broken poale, you may\r\nwith your owne strength pull it cleane out of the earth, and place the\r\nnew poale in his roome. Now, there be some which are exceeding curious\r\nin pulling vp these olde poales, and rather then they will shake the\r\nearth, or loosen the mould, they will make a paire of large pincers, or\r\ntarriers of iron, at least fiue foote long with sharpe teeth, and a\r\nclasping hooke to hould the teeth together, when they haue taken fast\r\nhould vpon the poale so neare the earth as is possible, and then laying\r\na peice of woode vnder the tarriers, and poysing downe the other ends to\r\nrest the poale out of the earth without any disturbance, the modell or\r\nfashion of which instrument is contained in this figure:\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nThis instrument is not to be discommended, but to be held of good vse,\r\neither in binding grounds where the earth hardneth and houldeth the\r\npoale more then fast, or in the strength and heate of summer, when the\r\ndrynesse of the mould will by no meanes suffer the poale to part from\r\nit: but otherwise it is needlesse and may without danger be omitted.\r\n\r\nAs soone as you haue sufficiently set euery hill with poales, and that\r\nthere is no disorder in your worke, you shall when the Hoppes beginne to\r\nclimbe, note if their be any cyons or branches which doe forsake the\r\npoales, and rather shoote alongst the ground then looke vp to their\r\nsupporters, and all such as you shall so finde, you shall as before I\r\nsayd, either with soft greene rushes, or the greene barke of Elder, tye\r\nthem gently vnto the poales, and winde them about, in the same course\r\nthat the sunne goes, as oft as conueniently you can: and this you shall\r\ndoe euer after the dew is gone from the ground, and not before, and this\r\nmust be done with all possible speede, for that cyon which is the\r\nlongest before it take vnto the poale is euer the worst and brings forth\r\nhis fruit in the worst season.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the Hils.}\r\nNow, as touching the making of your hils, you shall vnderstand that\r\nalthough generally they are not made the first yeere, yet it is not\r\namisse if you omit that scruple, and beginne to make your hils as soone\r\nas you haue placed your poales, for if your industry be answerable to\r\nthe desert of the labour, you shall reape as good profit the first\r\nyeere, as either the second or the third. To beginne therefore to make\r\nyour hils, you shall make you an instrument like a stubbing Hoe, which\r\nis a toole wherewith labourers stubbe rootes out of decayed woode-land\r\ngrounds, onely this shall be somewhat broader and thinner, somewhat in\r\nfashion (though twice so bigge) vnto a Coopers Addes, with a shaft at\r\nleast foure foote long: some onely for this purpose vse a fine paring\r\nspade, which is euery way as good, and as profitable, the fashion of\r\nwhich is in this figure.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nWith this paring spade, or hoe, you shall pare vp the greene-swarth and\r\nvppermost earth, which is in the alleyes betweene the hils, and lay it\r\nvnto the rootes of the Hoppes, raising them vp like small Mole-hils, and\r\nso monthly increasing them all the yeere through, make them as large as\r\nthe site of your ground will suffer, which is at least foure or fiue\r\nfoote ouerthwart in the bottome, and so high as conueniently that height\r\nwill carry: you shall not by any meanes this first yeere decay any cyons\r\nor branches which spring from the hils, but maintaine them in their\r\ngrowth, and suffer them to climbe vp the poales, but after the first\r\nyeere is expired you shall not suffer aboue two or three cyons, at the\r\nmost, to rise vpon one poale. After your hils are made, which as before\r\nI sayd would be at least foure or fiue foote square in the bottome, and\r\nthree foote high, you shall then diligently euery day attend your\r\ngarden, and if you finde any branches that being risen more then halfe\r\nway vp the poales, doe then forsake them and spread outward, dangling\r\ndowne, then you shall either with the helpe of a high stoole, on which\r\nstanding you may reach the toppe of the poale, or else with a small\r\nforckt sticke, put vp the branch, and winde it about the poale: you\r\nshall also be carefull that no weeds or other filthinesse grow about the\r\nrootes of your Hoppes to choake them, but vpon the first discouery to\r\ndestroy them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIII.\r\n\r\n_Of the gathering of Hoppes, and the preseruing of the Poales._\r\n\r\n\r\nTouching the gathering of Hoppes you shall vnderstand that after Saint\r\n_Margarets_ day they beginne to blossome, if it be in hot and rich\r\nsoyles, but otherwise not till Lammas: likewise in the best soyles they\r\nbell at Lammas, in the worst at Michaelmas, and in the best earth they\r\nare full ripe at Michaelmas, in the worst at Martillmas; but to know\r\nwhen they are ripe indeede, you shall perceiue the seede to loose his\r\ngreene colour, and looke as browne as a Hares backe, wherefore then you\r\nshall with all dilligence gather them, and because they are a fruit that\r\nwill endure little or no delay, as being ready to fall as soone as they\r\nbe ripe, and because the exchange of weather may breede change in your\r\nworke, you shall vpon the first aduantage of faire weather, euen so\r\nsoone as you shall see the dewe exhaled and drawne from the earth, get\r\nall the ayde of Men, Women, and children which haue any vnderstanding,\r\nto helpe you, and then hauing some conuenient empty barne, or shedde,\r\nmade either of boards or canuas, neare to the garden, in which you shall\r\npull your Hoppes, you shall then beginne at the nearest part of the\r\ngarden, and with a sharpe garden knife cut the stalkes of the Hoppes\r\nasunder close by the toppes of the hils; and then with a straite forke\r\nof iron, made broad and sharpe, for the purpose, shere vp all the\r\nHoppes, and leaue the poales naked. Then hauing labouring persons for\r\nthe purpose, let them cary them vnto the place where they are to be\r\npuld; and in any case cut no more then presently is caryed away as fast\r\nas they are cut, least if a shower of raine should happen to fall, and\r\nthose being cut and taking wet, are in danger of spoyling. You shall\r\nprouide that those which pull your Hoppes be persons of good discretion,\r\nwho must not pull them one by one, but stripe them roundly through their\r\nhands into baskets, mixing the young budds and small leaues with them,\r\nwhich are as good as any part of the Hoppe whatsoeuer. After you haue\r\npulled all your Hoppes and carried them into such conuenient dry roomes\r\nas you haue prepared for that purpose, you shall then spread them vpon\r\ncleane floares, so thinne as may be, that the ayre may passe thorrow\r\nthem, least lying in heapes they sweat, and so mould, before you can\r\nhaue leasure to dry them. After your Hoppes are thus ordered, you shall\r\nthen cleanse your garden of all such Hoppe-straw, and other trash, as in\r\nthe gathering was scattered therein: then shall you plucke vp all your\r\nHoppe-poales, in manner before shewed, and hauing either some dry\r\nboarded house, or shed, made for the purpose, pile then one vpon\r\nanother, safe from winde or weather, which howsoeuer some that would\r\nhaue their experience, like a Collossus, seeme greater then it is, doe\r\ndisalow, yet it is the best manner of keeping of poales, and well worthy\r\nthe charge: but for want of such a house, it shall not be amisse to take\r\nfirst your Hoppe-straw, and lay it a good thicknesse vpon the ground,\r\nand with sixe strong stakes, driuen slant-wise into the earth, so as the\r\nvppermost ends may be inward one to another, lay then your Hoppe-poales\r\nbetweene the stakes, and pile them one vpon another, drawing them\r\nnarrower and narrower to the top, and then couer them all ouer with more\r\nHoppe-straw, and so let them rest till the next March, at which time\r\nyou shall haue new occasion to vse them.\r\n\r\n{SN: Winter businesse.}\r\nAs soone as you haue piled vp your Hoppe-poales, dry and close, then you\r\nshall about mid-Nouember following throw downe your hils, and lay all\r\nyour rootes bare, that the sharpenesse of the season may nip them, and\r\nkeepe them from springing too earely: you shall also then bring into the\r\ngarden olde Cow-dunge, which is at least two yeeres olde, for no new\r\ndunge is good, and this you shall lay in some great heape in some\r\nconuenient place of the garden vntill Aprill, at which time, after you\r\nhaue wound your Hoppes about your poales, you shall then bestow vpon\r\neuery hill two or three spade-full of the Manure mixt with earth, which\r\nwill comfort the plant and make it spring pleasantly.\r\n\r\nAfter your hils are puld downe, you shall with your garden spade, or\r\nyour hoe, vndermine all the earth round about the roote of the Hoppe,\r\ntill you come to the principall rootes thereof, and then taking the\r\nyoungest rootes in your hand, and shaking away the earth, you shall see\r\nhow the new rootes grow from the olde sets, then with a sharpe knife cut\r\naway all those rootes as did spring the yeere before, out of your sets,\r\nwithin an inch and an halfe of the same, but euery yeere after the first\r\nyou shall cut them close by the olde rootes. Now, if you see any rootes\r\nwhich doe grow straight downward, without ioynts, those you shall not\r\ncut at all, for they are great nourishers of the plant, but if they grow\r\noutward, or side-wayes, they are of contrary natures, and must\r\nnecessarily be cut away. If any of your Hoppes turne wilde, as oft it\r\nhappens, which you shall know by the perfect rednesse of the branch,\r\nthen you shall cut it quite vp, and plant a new roote in his place.\r\nAfter you haue cut and trimmed all your rootes, then you shall couer\r\nthem againe, in such sort as you were taught at the first planting them,\r\nand so let them abide till their due time for poaling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIIII.\r\n\r\n_Of drying, and not drying of Hoppes, and of packing them when they are\r\ndried._\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there be much curiositie in the drying of Hoppes as well in the\r\ntemperature of heate (which hauing any extremitie, as either of heate,\r\nor his contrary, breedeth disorder in the worke) as also in the framing\r\nof the Ost or furnace after many new moulds and fashions, as variable as\r\nmens wits and experiences, yet because innouations and incertainty doth\r\nrather perplexe then profit, I will shunne, as much as in me lyeth, from\r\nloading the memory of the studious Husbandman with those stratagems\r\nwhich disable his vnderstanding from the attaining of better perfection,\r\nnot disalowing any mans approued knowledge, or thinking that because\r\nsuch a man can mend smoking Chimnyes, therefore none but hee shall haue\r\nlicense to make Chimnyes, or that because some men can melt Mettall\r\nwithout winde, therefore it shall be vtterly vnlawfull to vse bellowes:\r\nthese violent opinions I all together disacknowledge, and wish euery one\r\nthe liberty of his owne thoughts, and for mine English Husband, I will\r\nshew him that way to dry his Hoppes which is most fit for his profit,\r\nsafe, easie, and without extraordinary expences.\r\n\r\nFirst then to speake of the time which is fittest for the drying of your\r\nHoppes, it is immediately as soone as they are gotten, if more vrgent\r\noccasions doe not delay the businesse, which if they happen, then you\r\nhaue a forme before prescribed how to preserue them from mouldinesse and\r\nputrifaction till you can compasse fit time to effect the worke in. The\r\nmanner of drying them is vpon a Kilne, of which there be two sorts, that\r\nis to say, an English Kilne, and a French Kilne: the English Kilne being\r\ncomposed of woode, lath, and clay, and therefore subiect to some danger\r\nof fire, the French, of bricke, lime, and sand, and therefore safe,\r\nclose, and without all perill, and to be preferred much before the\r\nother: yet because I haue hereafter more occasion to speake of the\r\nnature, fashion, and edifice of Kilnes in that part of this Volumne\r\nwhere I intreate of Malting, I will cease further to mention them then\r\nto say that vpon a Kilne is the best drying your Hoppes, after this\r\nmanner, hauing finely bedded your Kilne with Wheate-straw, you shall lay\r\non your hayre cloath, although some disallow it, but giue no reason\r\ntherefore, yet it cannot be hurtfull in any degree, for it neither\r\ndistasteth the Hoppes, nor defendeth them from the fire, making the\r\nworke longer then it would, but it preserueth both the Hoppes from\r\nfilthynesse, and their seede from losse: when your hayre-cloath is\r\nspread, you shall cause one to deliuer you vp your Hoppes in baskets,\r\nwhich you shall spread vpon the cloath, all ouer the Kilne, at the least\r\neight inches thicke, and then comming downe, and going to the hole of\r\nthe Kilne, you shall with a little dry straw kindle the fire, and then\r\nmaintaining it with more straw, you shall keepe a fire a little more\r\nferuent then for the drying of a kilne-full of Malt, being assured that\r\nthe same quantitie of fuell, heate, and time, which dryeth a kilne-full\r\nof Malt, will also dry a kilne-full of Hoppes, and if your Kilne will\r\ndry twenty strikes, or bushels of Malt at one drying, then it will dry\r\nforty of Hoppes, because being layd much thicker the quantitie can be no\r\nlesse then doubled, which is a speede all together sufficient, and may\r\nvery well serue to dry more Hoppes then any one man hath growing in this\r\nkingdome.\r\n\r\nNow, for as much as some men doe not alow to dry Hoppes with straw, but\r\nrather preferre woode, and of woode still to chuse the greenest, yet I\r\nam of a contrary opinion, for I know by experience that the smoake which\r\nproceedeth from woode, (especially if it be greene woode) being a strong\r\nand sharpe vapour, doth so taint and infect the Hoppes that when those\r\nHoppes come to be brewed with, they giue the drinke a smoakie taste,\r\neuen as if the Malt it selfe had beene woode-dryed: the vnpleasantnesse\r\nwhereof I leaue to the iudgement of them that haue trauelled in\r\nYork-shire, where, for the most part, is nothing but woode-dryed Malt\r\nonely.\r\n\r\nThat you may know when your Hoppes are dry inough, you shall take a\r\nsmall long sticke, and stirring the Hoppes too and fro with it, if the\r\nHoppes doe russell and make a light noyse, each as it were seperating\r\none from another, then they are altogether dry inough, but if in any\r\npart you finde them heauy or glewing one to another, then they haue not\r\ninough of the fire: also when they are sufficiently and moderately dryed\r\nthey are of a bright-browne colour, little or nothing altered from that\r\nthey held when they were vpon the stalke, but if they be ouer dryed,\r\nthen their colour will be redde: and if they were not well ordered\r\nbefore they were dryed, but suffered either to take wet or mould, then\r\nthey will looke blacke when they are dry.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the drying Hoppes.}\r\nThere be some which are of opinion that if you doe not dry your Hoppes\r\nat all, it shall be no losse, but it is an errour most grose, for if\r\nthey be not dryed, there is neither profit in their vse, nor safty in\r\npreseruing them.\r\n\r\nAs soone as your Hoppes are sufficiently dryed, you shall by the\r\nplucking vp of the foure corners of your hayre-cloath thrust all your\r\nHoppes together, and then putting them into baskets, carry them into\r\nsuch dry places as you haue prepared of purpose to lay them in, as\r\nnamely, either in dry-fats, or in garners, made either of plaster, or\r\nboards: and herein you shall obserue to packe them close and hard\r\ntogether, which will be a meanes that if any of them be not dry, yet the\r\nheate they shall get by such lying will dry them fully and make them fit\r\nfor seruice.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of packing Hoppes.}\r\nNow to conclude, if your store of Hoppes be so great that you shall\r\ntrade or make Marchandize of them, then either to conuay them by land or\r\nSea, it is best that you packe them into great bagges of canuas, made in\r\nfashion of those bagges which woole-men vse, and call them pockets, but\r\nnot being altogether so large: these bagges you shall open, and either\r\nhang vp betweene some crosse-beames, or else let downe into some lower\r\nfloare, and then putting in your Hoppes cause a man to goe into the\r\nbagge and tread downe the Hoppes, so hard as is possible, pressing downe\r\nbasket-full after basket-full, till the bagge be filled, euen vnto the\r\ntoppe, and then with an extraordinary packe-thriede, sowing the open end\r\nof the bagge close together, let euery hollow place be crammed with\r\nHoppes, whilst you can get one hand-full to goe in, and so hauing made\r\neuery corner strong and fast, let them lye dry till you haue occasion\r\neither to shippe or cart them. And thus much for the ordering of Hoppes,\r\nand their vses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XV.\r\n\r\n_The office of the Gardiner, and first of the Earth, Situation, and\r\nfencing of a Garden for pleasure._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is to be required at the hands of euery perfect Gardiner three\r\nespeciall vertues, that is to say, _Diligence_, _Industry_, and _Art_:\r\nthe two first, as namely, _Diligence_ (vnder which word I comprehend his\r\nloue, care, and delight in the vertue hee professeth) and _Industry_\r\n(vnder which word I conclude his labour, paine, and study, which are the\r\nonely testimonies of his perfection) hee must reape from Nature: for, if\r\nhee be not inclined, euen from the strength of his blood to this loue\r\nand labour, it is impossible he should euer proue an absolute gardiner:\r\nthe latter, which containeth his skill, habit, and vnderstanding in what\r\nhee professeth, I doubt not but hee shall gather from the abstracts or\r\nrules which shall follow hereafter in this Treatise, so that where\r\nnature, and this worke shall concurre in one subiect, there is no doubt\r\nto be made, but the professor shall in all points, be able to discharge\r\na sufficient dutie.\r\n\r\nNow, for as much as all our antient and forraine writers (for wee are\r\nvery sleightly beholding to our selues for these indeauours) are\r\nexceeding curious in the choise of earth, and situation of the plot of\r\nground which is meete for the garden: yet I, that am all English\r\nHusbandman, and know our soyles out of the worthinesse of their owne\r\nnatures doe as it were rebell against forraine imitation, thinking their\r\nowne vertues are able to propound their owne rules: and the rather when\r\nI call into my remembrance, that in all the forraine places I haue\r\nseene, there is none more worthy then our owne, and yet none ordered\r\nlike our owne, I cannot be induced to follow the rules of Italie,\r\nvnlesse I were in Italie, neither those of France, vnlesse I dwelt in\r\nFrance, nor those of Germany except in Germany I had my habitation,\r\nknowing that the too much heate of the one, or the too much coldnesse of\r\nthe other, must rather confound then help in our temperate climate:\r\nwhence it comes, that our english booke-knowledge in these cases is both\r\ndisgraced and condemned, euery one fayling in his experiments, because\r\nhe is guided by no home-bredde, but a stranger; as if to reade the\r\nenglish tongue there were none better then an Italian Pedant. This to\r\nauoide, I will neither begge ayde nor authoritie from strangers, but\r\nreuerence them as worthies and fathers of their owne Countries.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the ground.}\r\nTo speake therefore first of the ground which is fit for the garden,\r\nalbeit the best is best worthy, the labour least, and the profit most\r\ncertaine, yet it is not meete that you refuse any earth whatsoeuer, both\r\nbecause a garden is so profitable, necessary, and such an ornament and\r\ngrace to euery house and house-keeper, that the dwelling place is lame\r\nand maymed if it want that goodly limbe, and beauty. Besides, if no\r\ngardens should be planted but in the best and richest soyles, it were\r\ninfinite the losse we should sustaine in our priuate profit, and in the\r\ndue commendations, fit for many worthy workmen, who haue reduced the\r\nworst and barrainest earths to as rare perfection and profit as if they\r\nhad beene the onely soyles of this kingdome: and for mine owne part, I\r\ndoe not wonder either at the worke of Art or Nature, when I behould in a\r\ngoodly, rich, and fertill soyle, a garden adorned with all the delights\r\nand delicacies which are within mans vnderstanding, because the naturall\r\ngoodnesse of the earth (which not induring to be idle) will bring forth\r\nwhatsoeuer is cast into her: but when I behould vpon a barraine, dry,\r\nand deiected earth, such as the Peake-hils, where a man may behould Snow\r\nall summer, or on the East-mores, whose best hearbage is nothing but\r\nmosse, and iron stone, in such a place, I say, to behould a delicate,\r\nrich, and fruitfull garden, it shewes great worthinesse in the owner,\r\nand infinite Art and industry in the workeman, and makes me both admire\r\nand loue the begetters of such excellencies.\r\n\r\nBut to returne to my purpose touching the choise of your earth for a\r\ngarden, sith no house can conueniently be without one, and that our\r\nEnglish Nation is of that great popularitie, that not the worst place\r\nthereof but is abundantly inhabited, I thinke it meete that you refuse\r\nno earth whatsoeuer to plant your garden vpon, euer obseruing this rule,\r\nthat the more barraine it is, the more cost must be bestowed vpon it,\r\nboth in Manuring, digging, and in trenching, as shall be shewed\r\nhereafter, and the more rich it is, lesse cost of such labour, and more\r\ncuriositie in weeding, proyning, and trimming the earth: for, as the\r\nfirst is too slow, so the latter is too swift, both in her increase and\r\nmultiplication.\r\n\r\nNow, for the knowledge of soyles, which is good, and which is badde, I\r\nhaue spoken sufficiently already in that part which intreateth of\r\nTillage, onely this one caueat I will giue you, as soone as you haue\r\nmarkt out your garden-plot, you shall turne vp a sodde, and taking some\r\npart of the fresh mould, champe it betweene your teeth in your mouth,\r\nand if it taste sweetish then is the mould excellent good and fit to\r\nreceiue either seedes or plants, without much Manuring, but if it taste\r\nsalt or bitter, then it is a great signe of barrainenesse, and must of\r\nnecessitie be corrected with Manure: for saltnesse sheweth much\r\nwindinesse, which choaketh and stifleth the seede, and bitternesse that\r\nvnnaturall heate which blasteth it before it sprout.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the situation.}\r\nNow, for the situation of the garden-plot for pleasure, you shall\r\nvnderstand that it must euer be placed so neare vnto the dwelling house\r\nas is possible, both because the eye of the owner may be a guard and\r\nsupport from inconueniences, as also that the especiall roomes and\r\nprospects of the house may be adorned, perfumed, and inriched, with the\r\ndelicate proportions, odorifferous smells, and wholsome ayres which\r\nshall ascend and vaporate from the same, as may more amply be seene in\r\nthat former Chapter, where modelling forth the Husbandmans house, I shew\r\nyou the site and place for his Garden, onely you must diligently\r\nobserue, that neare vnto this garden doe not stand any houells, stackes\r\nof hay, or Corne, which ouer-pearing the walls, or fence, of the same,\r\nmay by reason of winde, or other occasion, annoy the same with straw,\r\nchaffe, seedes, or such like filthinesse, which doth not onely blemish\r\nthe beauty thereof, but is also naturally very hurtfull and cankerous to\r\nall plants whatsoeuer. Within this garden plot would be also either some\r\nWell, Pumpe, Conduit, Pond, or Cesterne for water, sith a garden, at\r\nmany times of the yeere, requireth much watering: & this place for water\r\nyou shall order and dispose according to your abillitie, and the nature\r\nof the soyle, as thus: if both your reputation, and your wealth be of\r\nthe lowest account, if then your garden aford you a plaine Well, comely\r\ncouered, or a plaine Pump, it shall be sufficient, or if for want of\r\nsuch springs you digge a fayre Pond in some conuenient part thereof, or\r\nelse (which is much better) erect a Cesterne of leade, into which by\r\npippes may discend all the raine-water which falls about any part of the\r\nhouse, it will serue for your purpose: but if God haue bestowed vpon you\r\na greater measure of his blessings, both in wealth & account, if then\r\ninsteade of either Well, Pumpe, Pond, or Cesterne, you erect Conduits,\r\nor continuall running Fountaines, composed of Antique workes, according\r\nto the curiositie of mans inuention, it shall be more gallant and\r\nworthy: and these Conduits or water-courses, you may bring in pippes of\r\nleade from other remote or more necessary places of water springs,\r\nstanding aboue the leuell of your garden, as euery Artist in the\r\nprofession of such workes can more amply declare vnto you, onely for mee\r\nlet it be sufficient to let you vnderstand that euery garden would be\r\naccompanied with water.\r\n\r\nAlso you shall haue great care that there adioyne not vnto your\r\ngarden-plot any common-shewers, stinking or muddy dikes, dung-hils, or\r\nsuch like, the annoyance of whose smells and euill vapors doth not onely\r\ncorrupt and breede infection in man, but also cankereth, killeth and\r\nconsumeth all manner of plants, especially those which are most\r\npleasant, fragrant, and odorifferous, as being of tenderest nature and\r\nqualitie: and for this cause diuers will not alow the moating of\r\ngarden-plots about, imagining that the ouer great moistnesse thereof,\r\nand the strong smells which doe arise from the mudde in the Summer\r\nseason, doe corrupt and putrifie the hearbes and plants within the\r\ncompasse of the same, but I am not altogether of that opinion, for if\r\nthe water be sweet, or the channell thereof sandy or grauelly, then\r\nthere is no such scruple to be taken: but if it be contrary, then it is\r\nwith all care to be auoyded, because it is euer a Maxime in this case,\r\nthat your garden-plot must euer be compassed with the pleasantest and\r\nsweetest ayre that may be.\r\n\r\nThe windes which you shall generally defend from your garden, are the\r\nEasterne windes and the Northerne, because they are sharpest, coldest,\r\nand bring with them tempers of most vnseasonablenesse, & albeit in\r\nItalie, Spaine, and such like hot Countries, they rather defend away the\r\nWesterne and Southerne winde, giuing free passage to the East and North,\r\nyet with England it may not be so, because the naturall coldenes of our\r\nClimate is sufficient without any assistance to further bitternesse,\r\nour best industry being to be imployed rather to get warmth, which may\r\nnourish and bring forth our labours, then any way to diminish or weaken\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nThis plot of ground also would lye, as neare as you can, at the foote or\r\nbottome of an hill, both that the hill may defend the windes and sharpe\r\nweather from the same, as also that you may haue certaine ascents or\r\nrisings of state, from leuell to leuell, as was in some sort before\r\nshewed in the plot for the Orchard, and shall be better declared in the\r\nnext Chapter.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of fencing the garden.}\r\nNow lastly for the fencing or making priuate the garden-plot, it is to\r\nbe done according to your abillitie, and the nature of the climate\r\nwherein you liue: as thus, if your reuenewes will reach thereunto, and\r\nmatter be to be got, for that purpose, where you liue, then you shall\r\nvnderstand that your best fence is a strong wall, either of Bricke,\r\nAshler, rough-Stone, or Earth, of which you are the best-owner, or can\r\nwith least dammage compasse: but for want either of earth to make\r\nbricke, or quarries out of which to get stone, it shall not then be\r\namisse to fence your garden with a tall strong pale of seasoned Oake,\r\nfixt to a double parris raile, being lined on the inside with a thicke\r\nquicke-set of white-Thorne, the planting whereof shall be more largely\r\nspoken of where I intreate of fencing onely. But if the place where you\r\nliue in, be so barraine of timber that you cannot get sufficient for the\r\npurpose, then you shall make a studde wall, which shall be splinted and\r\nlomed both with earth and lime, and hayre, and copt vpon the toppe (to\r\ndefend away wet) either with tile, slate, or straw, and this wall is\r\nboth beautifull, and of long continuance, as may be seene in the most\r\nparts of the South of this kingdome: but if either your pouerty or\r\nclimate doe deny you timber for this purpose, you shall then first make\r\na small trench round about your garden-plot, and set at least foure\r\nrowes of quicke-set of white-Thorne, one aboue another, and then round\r\nabout the outside, to defend the quick-set, make a tall fence of dead\r\nwoode, being either long, small, brushy poales prickt into the earth,\r\nand standing vpright, and so bound together in the wast betweene two\r\nother poales, according to the figure set downe,\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nbeing so high that not any kinde of Pullen may flie ouer the same, or\r\nelse an ordinary hedge of common woode, being beyrded vpon the toppe\r\nwith sharpe Thornes, in such wise that not any thing may dare to\r\naduenture ouer it: and this dead fence you shall repaire and maintaine\r\nas occasion shall require from time to time, till your quicke-set be\r\ngrowne vp, and, by continuall plashing and interfouldings, be made able\r\nand sufficient to fence and defend your garden, which will be within\r\nfiue or seauen yeeres at the most, and so continue with good order for\r\neuer. And thus much for the situation of gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVI.\r\n\r\n_Of the fashion of the garden-plot for pleasure, the Alleyes, Quarters,\r\nDigging and Dungging of the same._\r\n\r\n\r\n{SN: The fashion.}\r\nAfter you haue chosen out and fenced your garden-plot, according as is\r\nbefore sayd, you shall then beginne to fashion and proportion out the\r\nsame, sith in the conuayance remaineth a great part of the gardiners\r\nart. And herein you shall vnderstand that there be two formes of\r\nproportions belonging to the garden, the first, onely beautifull, as the\r\nplaine, and single square, contayning onely foure quarters, with his\r\nlarge Alleyes euery way, as was discribed before in the Orchard: the\r\nother both beautifull and stately, as when there is one, two or three\r\nleuelled squares, each mounting seauen or eight steppes one aboue\r\nanother, and euery square contayning foure seuerall Quarters with their\r\ndistinct and seuerall Alleyes of equall breadth and proportion; placing\r\nin the center of euery square, that is to say, where the foure corners of\r\nthe foure Quarters doe as it were neighbour and meete one another,\r\neither a Conduit of antique fashion, a Standard of some vnusuall deuise,\r\nor else some Dyall, or other Piramed, that may grace and beautifie the\r\ngarden. And herein I would haue you vnderstand that I would not haue you\r\nto cast euery square into one forme or fashion of Quarters or Alleyes,\r\nfor that would shew little varytie or inuention in Art, but rather to\r\ncast one in plaine Squares, another in Tryangulars, another in\r\nroundalls, & so a fourth according to the worthinesse of conceite, as in\r\nsome sort you may behould by these figures, which questionlesse when\r\nthey are adorned with their ornaments, will breed infinite delight to\r\nthe beholders.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The Plaine Square.}\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The Square Triangular or circular.}\r\n\r\n{Illustration: The Square of eight Diamonds.}\r\n\r\nFrom the modell of these Squares, Tryangles, and Rounds, any\r\nindustrious braine may with little difficulty deriue and fashion to\r\nhimselfe diuers other shapes and proportions, according to the nature\r\nand site of the earth, which may appeare more quaint and strange then\r\nthese which are in our common vse, albeit these are in the truth of\r\nworkmanship the perfect father and mother of all proportions whatsoeuer.\r\n\r\n{SN: The ordering of Alleyes.}\r\nNow, you shall vnderstand that concerning the Alleyes and walkes in this\r\ngarden of pleasure, it is very meete that your ground, being spacious\r\nand large, (which is the best beauty) that you cut through the midst of\r\neuery Alley an ample and large path or walke, the full depth of the\r\nroote of the greene-swarth, and at least the breadth of seauen or eight\r\nfoote: and in this path you shall strow either some fine redde-sand, of\r\na good binding nature, or else some fine small grauell, or for want of\r\nboth them you may take the finest of your pit-coale-dust, which will\r\nboth keepe your Alleyes dry and smooth, and also not suffer any grasse\r\nor greene thing to grow within them, which is disgracefull, if it be\r\nsuffered: the French-men doe vse, to couer their Alleyes, either with\r\nthe powder of marble, or the powder of slate-stone, or else paue them\r\neither with Pit-stone, Free-stone, or Tiles, the first of which is too\r\nhard to get, the other great cost to small purpose, the rather sith our\r\nowne grauell is in euery respect as beautifull, as dry, as strong, and\r\nas long lasting: Onely this heedfulnesse you must diligently obserue,\r\nthat if the situation of your garden-plot be low and much subiect to\r\nmoisture, that then these middle-cut paths or walkes must be heightned\r\nvp in the midst, and made in a proportionall bent or compasse: wherein\r\nyou shall obserue that the out most verdges of the walke must be leuell\r\nwith the greene-swarth which holded in each side, and the midst so truly\r\nraised vp in compasse, that the raine which falles may haue a passage to\r\neach side of the greene-swarth. Now, the lesse this compasse is made (so\r\nit auoyde the water, and remaine hard) the better it is, because by\r\nthat meanes both the eye shall be deceiued (which shewes art in the\r\nworkman) and the more leuell they are, the more ease vnto them which\r\nshall continually walke vpon them.\r\n\r\n{SN: Obiection.}\r\nNow, if any shall obiect, why I doe not rather couet to haue these\r\nAlleyes or walkes rather all greene, then thus cut and deuided, sith it\r\nis a most beautifull thing to see a pleasant greene walke, my answere is\r\nthis, that first the mixture of colours, is the onely delight of the eye\r\naboue all other: for beauty being the onely obiect in which it ioyeth,\r\nthat beautie is nothing but an excellent mixture, or consent of colours,\r\nas in the composition of a delicate woman the grace of her cheeke is the\r\nmixture of redde and white, the wonder of her eye blacke and white, and\r\nthe beauty of her hand blewe and white, any of which is not sayd to be\r\nbeautifull if it consist of single or simple colours: and so in these\r\nwalkes, or Alleyes, the all greene, nor the all yealow cannot be sayd to\r\nbe most beautifull, but the greene and yealow, (that is to say, the\r\nvntroade grasse, and the well knit grauell) being equally mixt, giue the\r\neye both luster and delight beyonde all comparison.\r\n\r\nAgaine, to keepe your walkes all greene, or grassy, you must of force\r\neither forbeare to tread vpon them, (which is the vse for which they\r\nwere onely fashioned,) or treading vpon them you shall make so many\r\npathes and ilfauored wayes as will be most vglie to the eye: besides the\r\ndewe and wet hanging vpon the grasse will so annoy you, that if you doe\r\nnot select especiall howers to walke in, you must prouide shooes or\r\nbootes of extraordinary goodnesse: which is halfe a depriuement of your\r\nliberty, whereas these things of recreation were created for a contrary\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nNow, you shall also vnderstand that as you make this sandy and smooth\r\nwalke through the midst of your Alleyes, so you shall not omit but leaue\r\nas much greene-swarth, or grasse ground of eache side the plaine path as\r\nmay fully counteruaile the breadth of the walke, as thus for example: if\r\nyour sandy walke be sixe foote broad, the grasse ground of each side\r\nit, shall be at least sixe foote also, so that the whole Alley shall be\r\nat least eighteene foote in breadth, which will be both comely and\r\nstately.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of the Quarters.}\r\nYour Alleyes being thus proportioned and set forth, your next worke\r\nshall be the ordering of your Quarters, which as I sayd before, you may\r\nframe into what proportions you please, as into Squares, Tryangles and\r\nRounds, according to the ground, or your owne inuention: and hauing\r\nmarked them out with lines, and the garden compasse, you shall then\r\nbeginne to digge them in this manner: first, with a paring spade, the\r\nfashion whereof is formerly shewed, you shall pare away all the\r\ngreene-swarth, fully so deepe as the roote of the grasse shall goe, and\r\ncast it away, then with other digging spades you shall digge vp the\r\nearth, at least two foote and a halfe, or three foote deepe, in turning\r\nvp of which earth, you shall note that as any rootes of weedes, or other\r\nquickes shall be raised or stirred vp, so presently with your hands to\r\ngather them vp, and cast them away, that your mould may (as neare as\r\nyour dilligence can performe it) be cleane from either wilde rootes,\r\nstones, or such like offences: & in this digging of your Quarters you\r\nshall not forget but raise vp the ground of your Quarters at least two\r\nfoote higher then your Alleyes, and where by meanes of such reasure, you\r\nshall want mould, there you shall supply that lacke by bringing mould\r\nand cleane earth from some other place, where most conueniently you may\r\nspare it, that your whole Quarter being digged all ouer, it may rise in\r\nall parts alike, and carry an orderly and well proportioned leuell\r\nthrough the whole worke.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Dunging.}\r\nThe best season for this first digging of your garden mould is in\r\nSeptember: and after it is so digged and roughly cast vp, you shall let\r\nit rest till the latter end of Nouember, at what time you shall digge it\r\nvp againe, in manner as afore sayd, onely with these additions, that you\r\nshall enter into the fresh mould, halfe a spade-graft deeper then\r\nbefore, and at euery two foote breadth of ground, enlarging the trench\r\nboth wide and deepe, fill it vp with the oldest and best Oxe or\r\nCow-Manure that you can possibly get, till such time that increasing\r\nfrom two foote to two foote, you haue gone ouer and Manured all your\r\nquarters, hauing a principall care that your dunge or Manure lye both\r\ndeepe and thicke, in so much that euery part of your mould may\r\nindifferently pertake and be inriched with the same Manure.\r\n\r\n{SN: Diuersitie of Manures.}\r\nNow, you shall vnderstand that although I doe particularly speake but of\r\nOxe or Cow-Manure, because it is of all the fattest and strongest,\r\nespecially being olde, yet their are diuers respects to be had in the\r\nManuring of gardens: as first, if your ground be naturally of a good,\r\nfat, blacke, and well tempered earth, or if it be of a barraine, sandy,\r\nhot, yet firme mould, that in either of these cases your Oxe, Cow, or\r\nbeast Manure is the best & most sufficient, but if it be of a colde,\r\nbarraine, or spewing mould then it shall be good to mixe your Oxe-dunge\r\nwith Horse-dunge, which shall be at least two yeeres olde, if you can\r\nget it, otherwise such as you can compasse: if your ground be good and\r\nfertill yet out of his drynesse in the summer-time it be giuen to riue\r\nand chappe as is seene in many earths; you shall then mixe your\r\nOxe-dunge well with Ashes, orts of Lime, and such like: lastly, if your\r\nearth be too much binding and colde therewithall, then mixe your\r\nOxe-dunge with chalke or marle and it is the best Manure. And thus much\r\nfor the generall vse of earths.\r\n\r\nNow, for perticular vses you shall vnderstand that for Hearbs or Flowers\r\nthe Oxe and Horse-dunge is the best, for rootes or Cabbages, mans ordure\r\nis the best, for Harty-chockes, or any such like thisly-fruit,\r\nSwines-dunge is most sufficient, and thus according to your setled\r\ndetermination you shall seuerally prouide for euery seuerall purpose,\r\nand so, God assisting, seldome faile in your profit. And this dunge you\r\nshall bring into your garden in little drumblars or wheele-barrowes,\r\nmade for the purpose, such as being in common vse in euery Husbandmans\r\nyarde it shall be needlesse here either to shew the figure or\r\nproportion thereof. And thus much for the fashion, digging, and dunging\r\nof gardens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVII.\r\n\r\n_Of the adornation and beautifying of the Garden for pleasure._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adornation and beautifying of gardens is not onely diuers but almost\r\ninfinite, the industry of mens braines hourely begetting and bringing\r\nforth such new garments and imbroadery for the earth, that it is\r\nimpossible to say this shall be singular, neither can any man say that\r\nthis or that is the best, sith as mens tastes so their fancies are\r\ncarried away with the varietie of their affections, some being pleased\r\nwith one forme, some with another: I will not therefore giue\r\npreheminence to any one beauty, but discribing the faces and glories of\r\nall the best ornaments generaly or particularly vsed in our English\r\ngardens, referre euery man to the ellection of that which shall best\r\nagree with his fancy.\r\n\r\n{SN: Of Knots and Mazes.}\r\nTo beginne therefore with that which is most antient and at this day of\r\nmost vse amongst the vulgar though least respected with great ones, who\r\nfor the most part are wholy giuen ouer to nouelties: you shall\r\nvnderstand that Knots and Mazes were the first that were receiued into\r\nadmiration, which Knots or Mazes were placed vpon the faces of each\r\nseuerall quarter, in this sort: first, about the verdge or square of the\r\nquarter was set a border of Primpe, Boxe, Lauandar, Rose-mary, or such\r\nlike, but Primpe or Boxe is the best, and it was set thicke, at least\r\neighteene inches broad at the bottome & being kept with cliping both\r\nsmooth and leuell on the toppe and on each side, those borders as they\r\nwere ornaments so were they also very profitable to the huswife for the\r\ndrying of linnen cloaths, yarne, and such like: for the nature of Boxe\r\nand Primpe being to grow like a hedge, strong and thicke, together, the\r\nGardiner, with his sheares may keepe it as broad & plaine as himselfe\r\nlisteth. Within this border shall your knot or maze be drawne, it being\r\neuer intended that before the setting of your border your quarter shall\r\nbe the third time digged, made exceeding leuell, and smooth, without\r\nclot or stone, and the mould, with your garden rake of iron, so broken\r\nthat it may lye like the finest ashes, and then with your garden mauls,\r\nwhich are broad-boards of more then two foote square set at the ends of\r\nstrong staues, the earth shall be beaten so hard and firme together that\r\nit may beare the burthen of a man without shrinking. And in the beating\r\nof the mould you shall haue all diligent care that you preserue and\r\nkeepe your leuell to a hayre, for if you faile in it, you faile in your\r\nwhole worke.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nNow for the time of this labour, it is euer best about the beginning of\r\nFebruary, and indifferent, about the midst of October, but for the\r\nsetting of your Primpe, or Boxe-border, let the beginning of Nouember be\r\nyour latest time, for so shall you be sure that it will haue taken\r\nroote, and the leafe will flourish in the spring following: at which\r\ntime your ground being thus artificially prepared, you shall begin to\r\ndraw forth your knot in this manner: first, with lines you shall draw\r\nthe forme of the figure next before set downe, and with a small\r\ninstrument of iron make it vpon the earth.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nWhich done, from the order and proportion of these lines you shall draw\r\nyour single knots or plaine knots of the least curiositie, as may\r\nappeare by this figure, being one quarter of the whole Knot: euer\r\nproportioning your Trayles and windings according to the lines there\r\ndiscribed, which will keepe your worke in iust proportion.\r\n\r\nBut if you desire to haue knots of much more curiositie being more\r\ndouble and intricate, then you shall draw your first lines after this\r\nproportion here figured, pinning downe euery line firme to the earth\r\nwith a little pinne made of woode.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nWhich done you shall draw your double and curious knots after the manner\r\nof the figure following, which is also but one quarter of the whole\r\nknot, for looke in what manner you doe one knot in like sort will the\r\nother three quarters succeede, your lines keeping you in a continuall\r\neuen proportion.\r\n\r\n{Illustration}\r\n\r\nAnd in this manner as you draw these knots, with the like helps and\r\nlines also you shall draw out your Mazes, and laborinths, of what sort\r\nor kind soeuer you please, whether they be round or square. But for as\r\nmuch, as not onely the _Country-farme_, but also diuers other translated\r\nbookes, doe at large describe the manner of casting and proportioning\r\nthese knots, I will not persist to write more curiously vpon them, but\r\nwish euery painefull gardiner which coueteth to be more satisfied\r\ntherein, to repaire to those authors, where hee shall finde more large\r\namplifications, and greater diuersities of knots, yet all tending to no\r\nmore purpose then this which I haue all ready written.\r\n\r\nNow, as soone as you haue drawne forth and figured your knot vpon the\r\nface of your quarter, you shall then set it either with Germander,\r\nIssoppe, Time or Pinke-gilly-flowers, but of all hearbes Germander is\r\nthe most principall best for this purpose: diuers doe vse in knots to\r\nset Thrift, and in time of need it may serue, but it is not so good as\r\nany of the other, because it is much subiect to be slaine with frost,\r\nand will also spread vpon the earth in such sort that, without very\r\npainefull cutting, it will put your knot out of fashion.\r\n\r\n{SN: Yeallow.}\r\n{SN: White.}\r\n{SN: Blacke.}\r\n{SN: Red.}\r\n{SN: Blew.}\r\n{SN: Greene.}\r\nNow there is another beautifying or adorning of Gardens, and it is most\r\ngenerally to be seene in the gardens of Noblemen and Gentlemen, which\r\nmay beare coate-armor, and that is, instead of the knots and mazes\r\nformerly spoken of, to draw vpon the faces of your quarters such Armes,\r\nor Ensines, as you may either beare your selfe, or will preserue for the\r\nmemory of any friend: and these armes being drawne forth in plaine\r\nlines, you shall set those plaine shadowing lines either with Germander,\r\nIssop, or such like hearbes: and then for the more ample beautie\r\nthereof, if you desire to haue them in their proper and liuely colours\r\n(without which they haue but one quarter of their luster) you shall\r\nvnderstand that your colours in Armory are thus to be made. First, for\r\nyour mettalls: you shall make your Yeallow, either of a yeallow clay,\r\nvsually to be had almost in euery place, or the yeallowest sand, or for\r\nwant of both, of your Flanders Tile, which is to be bought of euery\r\nIron-monger or Chandelor; and any of these you must beate to dust: for\r\nyour White you shall make it of the coursest chalke beaten to dust, or\r\nof well burnt plaister, or, for necessity, of lime, but that will soone\r\ndecay: your Blacke is to be made of your best and purest coale-dust,\r\nwell clensed and sifted: your Red is to be made of broken vselesse\r\nbrickes beaten to dust, and well clensed from spots: your Blew is to be\r\nmade of white-chalke, and blacke coale dust mixed together, till the\r\nblacke haue brought the white to a perfect blewnes: lastly your Greene,\r\nboth for the naturall property belonging to your Garden, as also for\r\nbetter continuance and long lasting, you shall make of Camomill, well\r\nplanted where any such colour is to be vsed, as for the rest of the\r\ncolours, you shall sift them, and strow them into their proper places,\r\nand then with a flat beating-Beetell you shall beate it, and incorporate\r\nit with the earth, and as any of the colours shall decay, you shall\r\ndiligently repaire them, and the luster will be most beautifull.\r\n\r\nThere is also another beautifying of gardens, which although it last not\r\nthe whole yeere, yet it is most quaint, rare, and best eye-pleasing, and\r\nthus it is: you shall vpon the face of your quarter draw a plaine double\r\nknot, in manner of billet-wise: for you shall vnderstand that in this\r\ncase the plainest knot is the best, and you shall let it be more then a\r\nfoote betwixt line and line (for in the largenesse consists much beauty)\r\nthis knot being scored out, you shall take Tiles, or tileshreds and fixe\r\nthem within the lines of your knot strongly within the earth, yet so as\r\nthey may stand a good distance aboue the earth and this doe till you\r\nhaue set out all your knot with Tile: then precisely note the seuerall\r\npassages of your knot, and the seuerall thrids of which it consisteth,\r\nand then betwixt your tiles, (which are but as the shadowing lines of\r\nyour knot) plant in euery seuerall third, flowers of one kinde and\r\ncolour, as thus for example: in one thrid plant your carnation\r\nGilly-flower, in another your great white Geli flower, in another your\r\nmingle-coloured Gilly-flower, and in another your blood-red\r\nGilly-flower, and so likewise if you can compasse them you may in this\r\nsort plant your seueral coloured Hyacinths, as the red, the blew, and\r\nthe yealow, or your seuerall coloured _Dulippos_, and many other Italian\r\nand french flowers: or you may, if you please, take of euery seuerall\r\nplant one, and place them as afforesaid; the grace of all which is, that\r\nso soone as these flowers shall put forth their beauties, if you stand a\r\nlittle remote from the knot, and any thing aboue it, you shall see it\r\nappeare like a knot made of diuers coloured ribans, most pleasing and\r\nmost rare.\r\n\r\nMany other adornations and beautifyings there are which belong to the\r\nsetting forth of a curious garden, but for as much as none are more\r\nrare or more esteemed then these I haue set downe, being the best\r\nornaments of the best gardens of this kingdome, I thinke them tastes\r\nsufficient for euery husbandman, or other of better quality which\r\ndelighteth in the beauty and well trimming of his ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XVIII.\r\n\r\n_How for the entertainment of any great Person, in any Parke, or other\r\nplace of pleasure, where Sommer-bowers are made, to make a compleat\r\nGarden in two or three dayes._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the honest English husbandman, or any other, of what quallity soeuer,\r\nshall entertaine any Noble personage, to whom hee would giue the delight\r\nof all strange contentment, either in his Parke, or other remote place\r\nof pleasure, neere vnto Ponds, Riuer, or other waters of cleerenesse,\r\nafter hee hath made his arbors and Summer-bowers to feast in, the\r\nfashion whereof is so common that euery labourer can make them, hee\r\nshall then marke out his garden-plot, bestowing such sleight fence\r\nthereon as hee shall thinke fit: then hee shall cast forth his alleys,\r\nand deuide them from his quarters, by paring away the greene-swarth with\r\na paring spade, finely, and euen, by a direct line (for a line must euer\r\nbe vsed in this worke) then hauing store of labourers (after the\r\nvpper-most swarth is taken away) you shall cast vp the quarters, and\r\nthen breaking the mould and leuelling it, you shall make sad the earth\r\nagaine, then vpon your quarters you shall draw forth either Knots,\r\nArmes, or any other deuise which shall be best pleasing to your fancie,\r\nas either knots with single or double trayles, or other emblemicall\r\ndeuise, as Birds, Beasts, and such like: and in your knots where you\r\nshould plant hearbes, you shall take greene-sods of the richest grasse,\r\nand cutting it proportionably to the knot, making a fine trench, you\r\nshall lay in your sod, and so ioyning sod to sod close and arteficially,\r\nyou shall set forth your whole knot, or the portrayture of your armes,\r\nor other deuise, and then taking a cleane broome that hath not formerly\r\nbeene swept withall, you shall brush all vncleanenesse from the grasse,\r\nand then you shall behold your knot as compleat, and as comely as if it\r\nhad beene set with hearbes many yeeres before. Now for the portrayture\r\nof any liuing thing, you shall cut it forth, ioyning sod vnto sod, and\r\nthen afterward place it into the earth. Now if within this plot of\r\nground which you make your garden piece there be either naturall or\r\narteficiall mounts or bankes vpon them, you may in this selfe-same\r\nmanner with greene sods set forth a flight, either at field or riuer, or\r\nthe manner of hunting of any chase, or any story, or other deuise that\r\nyou please, to the infinit admiration of all them which shall behold it:\r\nonely in working against mounts or bankes you must obserue to haue many\r\nsmall pinnes, to stay your worke and keepe your sods from slipping one\r\nfrom another, till such time as you haue made euery thing fast with\r\nearth, which you must rame very close and hard: as for Flowers, or such\r\nlike adorments, you may the morning before, remoue them with their earth\r\nfrom some other garden, and plant them at your best pleasure. And thus\r\nmuch for a garden to be made in the time of hasty necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XIX.\r\n\r\n_How to preserue Abricots, or any kinde of curious\r\noutlandish-stone-fruit, and make them beare plentifully be the Spring or\r\nbeginning of Summer neuer so bitter._\r\n\r\n\r\nI haue knowne diuers Noblemen, Gentlemen & men of vnder quallitie, that\r\nhaue beene most laborious how to preserue these tender stone-fruits from\r\nthe violence of stormes, frost and windes, and to that end haue beene at\r\ngreat cost and charges yet many times haue found much losse in their\r\nlabours, wherefore in the end, through the practise of many experiments,\r\nthis hath beene found (which I will here set downe) the most approuedst\r\nway to make them beare without all kinde of danger. After you haue\r\nplanted your Abricot, or other delicate fruit, and plasht him vp against\r\na wall in manner as hath beene before declared, you shall ouer the tops\r\nof the trees all along the wall, build a large pentisse, of at least\r\nsixe or seauen foote in length: which pentisse ouer-shaddowing the\r\ntrees, will, as experience hath found out, so defend them, that they\r\nwill euer beare in as plentifull manner as they haue done any particular\r\nyeere before. There be many that will scoffe, or at least, giue no\r\ncredit to this experiment, because it carrieth with it no more\r\ncuriositie, but I can assure thee that art the honest English\r\nHusbandman, that there is nothing more certaine and vnfallible, for I\r\nhaue seene in one of the greatest Noblemens gardens in the kingdome,\r\nwhere such a pentisse was made, that so farre as the pentisse went, so\r\nfarre the trees did prosper with all fruitfulnesse, and where the\r\npentisse ended, not one tree bare, the spring-time being most bitter and\r\nwonderfull vnseasonable.\r\n\r\nNow I haue seene some great Personages (whose pursses may buy their\r\npleasures at any rate) which haue in those pentisses fixed diuers strong\r\nhookes of Iron, and then made a canuasse of the best Poldauie, with most\r\nstrong loopes, of small corde, which being hung vpon the Iron hookes,\r\nhath reacht from the pentisse to the ground, and so laced with corde and\r\nsmall pulleys, that like the saile of a ship it might be trust vp, and\r\nlet downe at pleasure: this canuasse thus prepared is all the Spring and\r\nlatter end of Winter to be let downe at the setting of the Sunne, and to\r\nbe drawne vp at the rising of the Sunne againe. The practise of this I\r\nreferre to such as haue abillitie to buy their delight, without losse,\r\nassuring them that all reason and experience doth finde it most probable\r\nto be most excellent, yet to the plaine English Husbandman I giue\r\ncertaine assurance that the pentisse onely is sufficient enough and will\r\ndefend all stormes whatsoeuer. And thus much for the preseruation and\r\nincrease of all tender Stone-fruit, of what nature, or climbe bred,\r\nsoeuer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XX.\r\n\r\n_How to make Grapes grow as bigge, full, and as naturally, and to ripen\r\nin as due season, and be as long lasting as either in Fraunce or Spaine._\r\n\r\n\r\nDiuers of our English Gardiners, and those of the best and most\r\napproued'st iudgements, haue beene very industrious to bring Grapes, in\r\nour kingdome, to their true nature and perfection: and some great\r\npersons I know, that with infinit cost, and I hope prosperous successe,\r\nhath planted a Vineyard of many Acres, in which the hands of the best\r\nexperienced french-men hath beene imploied: but for those great workes\r\nthey are onely for great men, and not for the plaine English Husbandman,\r\nneither will such workes by any meanes prosper in many parts of our\r\nkingdome, especially in the North parts: and I that write for the\r\ngenerall vse, must treate of vniuersall Maximes: therefore if you desire\r\nto haue Grapes in their true and best kinde, most earely and longest\r\nlasting, you shall in the most conuenient part of your garden, which is\r\neuer the center or middle point thereof, build a round house, in the\r\nfashion of a round Doue-coate, but many degrees lower, the ground worke\r\nwhereof shalbe aboue the ground two or three brickes thickenesse, vpon\r\nthis ground-plot you shall place a groundsell, and thereon, fine, yet\r\nstrong studs, which may reach to the roofe: these studs shalbe placed\r\nbetter then foure foote one from another, with little square bars of\r\nwoode, such as you vse in glasse windowes, two betwixt euery two studs,\r\nthe roofe you may make in what proportion you will, for this house may\r\nserue for a delicate banqueting house, and you may either couer it with\r\nLeade, Slate or Tile, which you please. Now, from the ground to the top,\r\nbetweene the studs, you shall glase it, with very strong glasse, made in\r\nan exceeding large square pane, well leaded and cimented. This house\r\nthus made, you shall obserue that through the bricke worke there be\r\nmade, betweene euery two studs, square holes, cleane through into the\r\nhouse; then on the out-side, opposite against those holes, you shall\r\nplant the roote of your Vine, hauing beene very carefull in the election\r\nand choise thereof: which done, as your Vine groweth you shall draw it\r\nthrough those holes, and as you vse to plash a Vine against a wall, so\r\nyou shall plash this against the glasse window, on the in-side, and so\r\nsoone as it shall beginne to beare Grapes you shall be sure to turne\r\neuery bunch, so that it may lye close to the glasse, that the reflection\r\nof the Sunne heating the glasse, that heate may hasten on the ripening,\r\n& increase the groath of your Grapes: as also the house defending off\r\nall manner of euill weather, these Grapes will hang ripe, vnrotted or\r\nwithered, euen till Christmas. Thus haue I giuen you a tast of some of\r\nthe first parts of English Husbandry, which if I shall finde\r\nthankefully accepted, if it please God to grant mee life, I will in my\r\nnext Volumne, shew you the choise of all manner of Garden Hearbes and\r\nFlowers, both of this and other kingdomes, the seasons of their\r\nplantings, their florishings and orderings: I will also shew you the\r\ntrue ordering of Woodes, both high and low, as also the breeding and\r\nfeeding of all manner of Cattell, with the cure of all diseases incident\r\nvnto them, together with other parts of Husbandry, neuer before\r\npublished by any Author: this I promise, if God be pleased: to whom be\r\nonely ascribed the glory of all our actions, and whose name be praised\r\nfor euer.
