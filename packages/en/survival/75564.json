Foot-notes\r\nare appended, referring to the position in the British Museum of all\r\nthe principal antiquities, fossils, and implements mentioned in the\r\ntext; so that the specimens can easily be found by any young student\r\nwho wishes, with the book in his hand, to make himself familiar with\r\nthese records of past time. This will probably facilitate the search\r\nfor and recognition of specimens by the reader.\r\n\r\nThe additions to the text consist chiefly of a more extended account of\r\nthe deposition of chalk and other deep-sea formations, founded on the\r\nresults of the “Challenger” and “Tuscarora” expeditions, and a sketch\r\nof the earthworks of the Ohio mound-builders and the stone monuments\r\nof Easter Island. Examples of pre-historic art and lake-dwellings have\r\nbeen added to the illustrations.\r\n\r\n  A.

The difficulty of\r\ntreating the, to them, novel conclusions of geology, often founded on\r\nabstract reasoning, in language simple in form yet stating clearly the\r\ngreat principles upon which this reasoning rests, will probably be\r\napparent on every page. Breadth, rather than minuteness, has been aimed\r\nat, in the belief that a general view, not overcrowded with details,\r\nis likely to be the most impressive. Thus, in the geological part the\r\nleading features of the succession of strata have been preserved,\r\nbut no details of systematic classification entered into. Similarly,\r\nPrimeval Man is considered mainly with reference to gradual progress\r\nfrom a rude to a more civilized condition. To have been more explicit,\r\nwhere there is still much difference of opinion, would have obscured\r\nthe main facts of the evidence for man’s great antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations are typical examples of the three arbitrary but\r\nconvenient divisions of the history of life—the vegetable, the animal,\r\nand the human—such as will be most readily met with in museums.\r\nSlight as this sketch is, the liking for it shown by some intelligent\r\nchildren, who saw it in manuscript, encouraged me to believe that there\r\nare many others to whom it might prove interesting.\r\n\r\nSome acquaintance with the leading facts in science is daily becoming\r\nmore necessary to those who aspire to liberal culture, and instruction\r\nin them is a recognised feature in the curriculum of some public and\r\nleading private schools. Thus, it is hoped that the present volume\r\nmay to some extent serve as a text-book without the severity of such\r\na form. The best English and foreign authorities have been consulted,\r\nand other trustworthy sources—as papers read before scientific\r\nsocieties—drawn upon, bringing the information down to the latest time.\r\nThough these pages are designed for young persons, other readers,\r\nperhaps, who are not familiar with the subject, may find some interest\r\nin them if they are not deterred by the necessarily simple style.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to Mr. H. B. WOODWARD, of the Geological Survey\r\nof England and Wales, for some valuable suggestions made during the\r\nprogress of the work.\r\n\r\n  A.

How did it come here? What is\r\nit made of? How old is it? All of them questions not to be answered\r\nwithout a great deal of thought and study, and even then not so\r\nperfectly as we should like. It is easy to say “It is here,” and “It is\r\nmade of earth,” and “It surely must be old,” but that will not satisfy\r\nus. We want to know something more certain than this, if possible. We\r\ncan see that a clock goes with wheels, but we are not very intelligent\r\npeople if we do not want to find out what makes the clock go. One way\r\nof finding out is to pull things to pieces, but we cannot exactly do\r\nthis with the World. We must think about it, and put together all the\r\nknowledge we can gain from the outside and inside, and from the other\r\nWorlds around us, which we can see, and when we have done this we may\r\nget something like answers to our questions.\r\n\r\nHow did it come here? But this is not quite the right way of asking the\r\nquestion, because the World is never for two moments together in the\r\nsame place. It is travelling in a great circle round the Sun at the\r\nrate of more than sixty thousand miles an hour, and has been ever since\r\nit was formed. That is a wonderful arrangement by which all Worlds\r\ntravel round some other World larger than themselves, in greater or\r\nless circles, and we do not know why it is, though we are certain that\r\nit is so. The Moon travels round us once in about every month, and we\r\nand the Moon together round the Sun once in every year.\r\n\r\nThen again, other planets, with their moons, such as Jupiter, for\r\ninstance, travel round the Sun in much larger circles than our World,\r\nand take many years to do the journey, while Venus, which is nearer the\r\nSun than we are, travels in a much smaller circle, and takes less time.\r\nWe do not perceive that we are moving so fast because everything we\r\nsee is moving equally fast with us; but there is no doubt that we are\r\nspinning along at sixty thousand miles an hour.\r\n\r\nIf we ask an astronomer how our World came into existence, he will tell\r\nus that it is probably a mass separated from the Sun, that it was once\r\nred-hot, and that it slowly cooled down until animals and plants could\r\nlive upon it. He will tell us besides, that he can see mountains and\r\nvalleys in our Moon, and land and sea, snow and clouds, on the planet\r\nMars, with his great telescopes. When he thinks about the planets and\r\nour own World, then he believes them to be pieces of some much larger\r\nWorld—perhaps the Sun—which now travel round the Sun and receive their\r\nlight and heat from it. The World is made of what we call “earth,” and\r\nit is of this I mean to tell you now—how it was formed, what changes\r\nhave taken place in it, what plants and animals have lived upon it,\r\nand what reasons there are for thinking that it is an exceedingly old\r\nplace, with a long and interesting story to tell.\r\n\r\nLittle was known thirty or forty years ago by the most learned men\r\nabout the age of our World, and it was thought that the human race\r\nhad not lived here very long. It was indeed known that many large\r\nanimals, whose huge bones have been found, must have lived before man\r\ncame to inhabit the Earth, and that even far smaller creatures—such\r\nas fishes, and crabs, and insects, and shell-fish—most probably lived\r\nfor many generations, and died and left their bones and shells in the\r\nsoil long before the first man or the first tribes of men came to\r\nshare the World with them. I hope to be able to tell you something of\r\nthe strange and beautiful history of all these animals, and of man\r\nhimself, and to show you what reasons there are now for thinking that\r\nthe human race has inhabited this Earth for a very long time indeed,\r\nand how all this knowledge has been gained and put together piece by\r\npiece. It is something like the different parts of a puzzle-map, which\r\nmight be scattered all over the house, and found at one time or another\r\nin different places, and at last made up altogether. Some parts of\r\nthe puzzle have not been found yet certainly; but so many have been\r\ncollected, and they fit into one another so well, that we can begin to\r\nsee its real shape and size. It will perhaps be a very long time before\r\nsome of the missing pieces are found; but in the meantime we can go on\r\nwithout them, and put the framework together, and no doubt in time we\r\nshall see what our puzzle, the history of life on the Earth, was like.\r\n\r\nBefore telling you what its parts are, I ought to say where many of\r\nthem have been found, and how they are still being looked for. They are\r\nfound _upon_ the ground, _under_ it, in caves, in rivers, and in the\r\nsea. Since railways have been in use a great many tunnels have been\r\nmade, as well as very deep cuttings through hills, and some of these\r\nare several miles long. In this way we have come to know something\r\nof the Earth below the surface. Some of these tunnels are bored right\r\nthrough high hills and even mountains, and the cuttings are deep\r\nenough to hide high houses if they were put into them. While digging\r\nthese the workmen have found many of the parts of our puzzle, which\r\nare the bones of animals, and fishes, and shells, and even smaller\r\nthings—such as insects. These could not possibly have been put there\r\nby anyone, because they were many, many yards below the surface, and,\r\nuntil they were dug up, nobody imagined that they could be there. Many\r\nother things besides have been dug out of these places, but nearer the\r\nsurface, such as weapons and tools made of flint, and stone, and bone,\r\nand metal, and pieces of rough crockery, and various ornaments, all\r\nof which must at some time or other have been made and used by people\r\nvery like ourselves. In digging canals, too, the same kinds of things\r\nhave been found, and some caves are almost filled up with them. We have\r\nother means, too, of knowing what is under the surface of the ground\r\nwe walk upon. Many of the coal-mines are so deep that the Tower of\r\nLondon, or St. Paul’s Cathedral, or York Minster, or even the Pyramids\r\nof Egypt could be buried in them! In digging these the workmen have\r\nhad to go through a great quantity of earth, sometimes chalk, sand, or\r\ngravel, or clay or limestone, layer upon layer, placed, like a pile\r\nof books of different kinds and different thicknesses, one upon the\r\nother, until they have come to the coal. In these different layers of\r\nearth parts of the puzzle have been found, and we shall see by-and-by\r\nwhat parts have been found in the coal itself. Then again, when deep\r\nmines are made to get the metals, iron and gold and silver, these\r\nlayers of earth have to be dug through; and when the beautiful kinds\r\nof stone, like marble and limestone, are wanted, they must be dug out\r\nof the sides of the hills, and in doing this still more pieces of the\r\npuzzle come to hand. But there are other places where Nature herself\r\nseems to have shown us some of them without the trouble of searching\r\nfor them. In many parts of the World, by the sea, and on the banks of\r\nrivers, there are cliffs hundreds of feet high, like the chalk cliffs\r\nat Dover and Ramsgate, and the sandy cliffs at Folkestone and on the\r\nsouth coast of Devonshire. These cliffs have been cut into by the sea\r\nvery gradually, and a kind of wall has been left, and from the sides of\r\nthe cliffs great numbers of the pieces of the puzzle, bones, shells,\r\n&c., have been collected and taken away to museums. But the little we\r\ncan do with our mines and railway tunnels is nothing in comparison with\r\nthe work of Nature. In some of the great mountain chains—the Andes, the\r\nHimalayas, and the Alps, for instance—parts of the sides of mountains\r\nhave fallen down, and rents many miles long have been left, showing\r\nwhat had been buried there in the different kinds of soil; and where\r\nrivers have cut deep, narrow channels through the earth, like the\r\nCañons of Colorado, these natural miners have turned out more of the\r\nparts of “the puzzle of life” than we can with all our labour.\r\n\r\nIt will not be easy at first to understand all the wonders I have to\r\nshow you, but, when we get further on, you will see them one by one,\r\nand there will be very little difficulty. You know now where these\r\nthings are to be found: principally in the ground you walk upon,\r\nwithout knowing all there is beneath you. The creatures here are\r\nmuch more wonderful than any of the monsters of fairy tale or fable,\r\nbecause the works of God are greater than the imagination of men who\r\nhave invented the stories of flying dragons and griffins, and trees\r\nwhich grew up into the skies; but I cannot help thinking that this\r\nimagination shows what men thought _might_ once have been, and we shall\r\nsee that “truth is stranger than fiction.” Creatures really did live on\r\nthis Earth of such strange shapes and great size that the imaginations\r\nof those who wrote the fairy tales did not exaggerate much; and, though\r\nwe know that no flying serpents or immense birds like the Roc are\r\nliving now, and that there is no beanstalk which grows up into the sky\r\nwhile we are asleep, we shall see that there were lizards as large as\r\nwhales, and birds taller than elephants, and great sloths stronger than\r\nthe rhinoceros or hippopotamus, and ferns as high as oak trees, and\r\nmosses as large as gooseberry bushes; and that perhaps these animals\r\nand plants grew much faster than they do now, and that their dead\r\nbodies form a very large part of the earth of our World. This is not\r\nimagination, and when you go to a museum you can see all these wonders\r\nfor yourselves, just as they were taken out of the earth; but of course\r\nthe bones only of the animals are there. The flesh has long since gone\r\naway, and some of the stalks and fronds (leaves) only of the ferns\r\nremain to show us how large they must have been when they were alive\r\nand growing.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to use a few scientific names, most of which are\r\nborrowed from the Greek and Latin languages, but I will explain the\r\nmeaning of them all, so that they will be easily remembered. First of\r\nall, then, the pieces of the puzzle are called _fossils_, and the name\r\ncomes from a Latin word meaning “dug out;” because they have been dug\r\nout of the ground either by man in making railways and mines, or by\r\nNature in the many ways in which she works by cutting down cliffs and\r\nscooping out valleys. These fossils are bones of animals and fishes,\r\nthe skins, shells, and wings of insects, and the stalks and leaves\r\nof plants, some of which have lain so very long in the ground that\r\nthey have become as hard and heavy as stone. But the shape of them\r\nalways remains, and the moment you look at them you see that they once\r\nbelonged to living creatures.\r\n\r\nI shall give you pictures of some of these fossils; and no doubt you\r\nwill be able to find some like them in the chalk and sands of the\r\nseaside—beautiful shells and bones of fishes. You may pick these out\r\nof the cliffs, and then go to the pools of salt water left among the\r\nrocks by the ebbing tide, and compare your fossils with the living\r\nshell-fish, and see how nearly those inhabitants of the ancient oceans\r\nresemble the creatures we find now, sporting in the water, just as\r\nthese fossils did when the sand and chalk cliffs were under the sea.\r\nOf course all the bright colours are gone from the fossils, for the\r\ncolour of animals fades away soon after they die, and the flesh does\r\nnot last long; but the hard parts—the bones and shells—are not easily\r\ndestroyed, because they are made of the same material as rocks. And\r\nwhen we look at the fossil plants we see the same thing. The colours of\r\nthe green stems and leaves have quite faded, but the delicate shapes of\r\nthe leaves and branches, and the grain of the wood, can still be seen,\r\nand you will have no doubt that they once lived and bore flowers and\r\nfruit, and died, as plants are living and dying every day.\r\n\r\nYou have got so far now that you know what fossils are, and where they\r\nmay be found. You know that they are the small and large pieces of the\r\n“puzzle of life”—of all sorts of different shapes and sizes—and you\r\nknow that they are scattered about the Earth, deep down in coal-mines,\r\non the tops of mountains, at the bottoms of rivers, in deep caves,\r\nand under the sea. The patience and industry of clever men have been\r\nwell spent in gathering together all they can find, and arranging\r\nthem in museums for our instruction, and making a history of them\r\nwhich is more wonderful than the Arabian Nights, and more beautiful\r\nbecause it is all _true_. And, though you may think it strange that I\r\npromise to show you creatures more marvellous than those of the fairy\r\ntales, I shall keep that promise faithfully. We shall find no Genii\r\nwith wonderful lamps and magic rings, because they never really lived,\r\nthough it gave us much pleasure and amusement to read about them; but\r\nwe shall see what God, the greatest Genius of all, has done by means of\r\nHis magicians—the laws of Nature. These magicians have built up high\r\nmountains and dug out valleys, and sent mighty rivers sweeping down\r\nto the sea, and even filled up oceans with sand and chalk, and buried\r\nancient forests deep down under sea and land. They worked with fire,\r\nand air, and water; not quickly, but with such strength that nothing\r\ncould resist them, and they gradually moulded the Earth into the\r\nbeautiful thing it is, so that\r\n\r\n    In contemplation of created things,\r\n    By steps we may ascend to God.—_Milton._\r\n\r\nBut, lovely as the Earth is, we should not perhaps have thought so\r\nmuch of it if there had been nothing to discover. We see that it has\r\nbeen prepared for us an immensely long time ago; and when we know a\r\nlittle, we want to search further and find out what the whole plan of\r\nCreation is, so far as we can. You will be surprised when you know how\r\nmany signs of past life there are around you—many more than you can see\r\nwith the eye. The Earth is one great burying-place of creatures which\r\nhave passed away. You are walking over their dead and fossil bodies\r\nat almost every step. They are built into the walls of our houses,\r\nand there are millions of them in some of the commonest stones of the\r\npavement. Those round, smooth pebbles, called flint stones, which we\r\npick out of the gravel walks, were once partly such soft tender things\r\nas sponges; but time has hardened them, and they have been rolled\r\ntogether in seas and rivers by the always moving water until they have\r\nbecome quite different to look at from the rough blue flints they were\r\nwhen they were washed out of the chalk beds. When you are walking\r\nalong the sands of some seacoasts, you are treading on little specks\r\nof these small flints which have been ground down fine in that great\r\nmill, the ocean. The sponges, then, did some part in the building up of\r\nthe Earth. The very chalk you draw with is composed of the shells of\r\nsea-animals. Your slates and slate pencils were once a fine mud at the\r\nbottom of the sea, since become so hard that it is used for covering\r\nthe roofs of our houses, and in this mud lived myriads of small\r\nshell-fish which have sometimes left their frail houses in the slate\r\nbeds to tell us how they were made. That slate is the hardened mud of\r\nan old sea bottom, there is no doubt at all.\r\n\r\nThere are many other things in common use which show us the life that\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you did not know that coals are _compressed plants_, and that\r\nwe are now burning the vegetation of the past time! But these will be\r\ndescribed in their right places by-and-by, and you will see how certain\r\nit is that some of the commonest things we use were living creatures\r\nand graceful plants.\r\n\r\nHere is “the framework” of the puzzle, and I think you will agree with\r\nme that we shall have pleasure in putting it together with all the\r\nqueerly-shaped pieces we shall find in the following chapters. We have\r\nfossil plants to show us what grew upon the Earth, fossil bones to tell\r\nus what animals lived here, and thousands of different kinds of fossil\r\nshells and fishes to show us that the seas in the long past time were\r\ncrowded with life; and besides, though there are no written histories\r\nof the men whom we shall read about, they, too, have left many things\r\nwhich they used in the caves where they lived and in their graves, to\r\nmake us feel certain that they were some of the oldest people that\r\never lived. With all these things to help us, it will be strange if we\r\ncannot make out a great deal of the history of life upon our Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE GEOLOGICAL PART._\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will have learned from other books something about the size and\r\nshape of our World: for instance, that it is a great round body, or\r\nrather more like an orange, a little flatter one way than the other,\r\nand about 8,000 miles through, from one side to the other, and that\r\nit turns round once in every twenty-four hours; but I have only to\r\ntell you now what it is made of. The material is called rock, earth,\r\nor soil; and there are many kinds of it, such as granite, gravel,\r\nclay, sand, chalk, mud, and so on; and we shall see that many of these\r\ndifferent soils contain different fossils.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that a very long time passed while these were being\r\nlaid one upon another, and before many plants or animals lived here,\r\nand there are good reasons for thinking that underneath these soils\r\nthe Earth is very hot, perhaps in a melting state, because we know\r\nthat volcanoes like Vesuvius and Ætna throw out flame and smoke and\r\nlava, which is melted earth and rock; and that this lava has run down\r\nthe sides of the mountains for miles, in a great stream of liquid\r\nmaterial, and covered up and destroyed whole villages and towns. You\r\nhave heard of earthquakes, when the ground shakes and cracks, and\r\nhouses are thrown down, as they have often been in Spain, Italy, and\r\nSouth America. This convinces us that the inside of the earth must be\r\nvery different from the outside. Two or three years ago Mount Vesuvius\r\nwas boiling up, and the people of Naples feared that it would throw\r\nout some of the terrible lava and red-hot cinders, and burn up their\r\nvineyards and perhaps injure their city; and during the last two or\r\nthree years many people have been killed by earthquakes in South\r\nAmerica. These things seldom happen in the North of Europe, and when\r\nthey do they are only slightly felt, and people are not killed, neither\r\nare houses thrown down. Still, this shows that there must be some\r\ngreat force underneath us, and very much heat. We see nothing of this\r\nwhen we look upon the green fields, and we should scarcely think it\r\npossible if there were not histories about these eruptions, as they are\r\ncalled. But when I tell you that I have felt the Earth tremble, and\r\nseen fire rushing out from the top of a high mountain whose sides were\r\ncovered with snow, you will understand how real it is—though it may\r\nseem so strange.\r\n\r\nPeople at one time liked to fancy that powerful spirits lived in\r\nvolcanoes and made them their workshops: but we know better now.\r\n\r\nWell, the interior of the Earth is evidently very different from the\r\npart we live upon; and it is the outside we have to think about now,\r\nwhich would be dreadfully cold if the sun did not shine upon it, though\r\nthe inside is so hot.\r\n\r\nI have called this “the Geological Part,” and the name Geological comes\r\nfrom two Greek words meaning “a talk about the earth;” but now you know\r\nit in its English dress it will be easy to recollect it. Geology is\r\nthen the study of the many kinds of rocks and fossils which makeup our\r\nWorld, but we must know something of the way in which they are placed.\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed, if you have made many journeys to different\r\nparts of England or Wales, that the rocks or soils are very different\r\nin various places. Sometimes we find numerous chalk-pits, as in parts\r\nof Kent, or Sussex; if we go into Devonshire we may notice the very\r\nred colour of the soil and of the cliffs, especially near Sidmouth,\r\nDawlish, and Teignmouth; in North Wales we find great quarries and\r\nhills of slate; while around London we see a great deal of clay used\r\nfor making bricks, and called the London clay, as well as many pits in\r\ngravel so useful for making paths and mending roads, and in Kent and\r\nSussex chalk cliffs and hills are common.\r\n\r\nNow after studying these various rocks all over our country, we find\r\nthat there is a certain regular order in which they are found; some\r\nhave been made a long time before others, and while most kinds contain\r\nsome fossils, those found in the oldest rocks are much less like the\r\nliving plants and animals than the fossils we find in the newer rocks.\r\n\r\nBut you will want to know how it is that we can tell that one rock\r\nis older than another, when both appear at the surface of the earth.\r\nIt would take a long time to make sure of this for ourselves, but\r\nit will be enough to say that the various cliffs, quarries, and\r\nrailway-cuttings often show one kind of rock resting upon another,\r\nand these always occur in a certain order. Thus we never find the\r\nChalk resting on the London Clay, but we constantly find the London\r\nClay resting on the Chalk. And this is proved in another way, by deep\r\nwell-borings. Underneath London many wells have been carried down right\r\nthrough the London Clay, and if only continued deep enough they always\r\nreach the Chalk. In the same way, the order of the other rocks has\r\nbeen ascertained in different parts of the country, by examining all\r\nthe pits and quarries, and cliffs and cuttings, with the help of what\r\nknowledge can be obtained from deep mines and wells.\r\n\r\nYou will now begin to wonder why the older rocks should appear at the\r\nsurface. I have told you about earthquakes, and you will find that many\r\ndreadful earthquakes must in former times have ravaged our country.\r\nThe reason why the old rocks come to the surface is because they have\r\nbeen lifted up sometimes violently, but more often very slowly. And the\r\nnewer rocks which formerly rested on them have very often been quite\r\nwashed away, either by the sea or by rivers and little streams which\r\nformerly acted upon them.\r\n\r\nSuppose then we take six books, some thick and some thin, and pile\r\nthem up together on the table, the lowest being a good thick one. The\r\nlowest we will call granite, the next slate, the third sandstone, the\r\nfourth coal, the fifth chalk, and the sixth the London clay. These will\r\nrepresent some of the principal kinds of earths, and you can fancy many\r\nmore with other names coming between them; but the London clay can\r\nnever be below the granite nor the chalk below the coal, for the great\r\ncoal beds were formed long before the chalk and clay. They generally\r\ncome in much the same order as we have named them, hard rocks like\r\ngranite at the bottom, and softer earths, like sandstone, chalk and\r\nclay, a long way above them. But we do not always find all these earths\r\nin one place even if we dig ever so deeply, though the granite would\r\nalways be found at the bottom if we went deep enough.\r\n\r\nSometimes the granite and other old rocks have been pushed through\r\nthe upper layers by some great force, and have broken them and risen\r\nabove them in magnificent mountain chains, like those of the Andes in\r\nSouth, and the Rocky Mountains in North America, the Wicklow Mountains\r\nin Ireland, the Grampians in Scotland, and the Cornish mountains in\r\nEngland. We can easily suppose that the lowest of our books (the\r\ngranite book) has been pushed upwards by some great force from below,\r\nand parts of it broken through the others, and raised high above them;\r\nand this is what has actually been done with real rocks. And as this\r\nkind of upheaval has taken place at different periods of the earths\r\nhistory, we find that granites have come to the surface at different\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nWhen the layers are thus broken through they are often tilted up on end\r\nand tumbled about in confusion. But where there has been no disturbance\r\nlike this, they generally rest evenly upon one another in their proper\r\norder.\r\n\r\nGranite, and rocks of the same kind, are not in the least like chalk,\r\nor clay, or even sandstone, and when once you have seen any of these\r\nyou will not be likely to mistake it for the others. Granite is\r\nexcessively hard, and has a beautiful appearance when polished, with a\r\nnumber of brilliant white and some dark specks in it. It is used for\r\npaving the streets of towns, for which purpose it is cut into oblong\r\nblocks, and for the pillars of fine buildings. Sometimes it is dark\r\nbrown, sometimes reddish, but generally a bluish grey. This rock is\r\ncomposed of a great quantity of crystals, and for this reason it is\r\nthought it must have been melted at one time by intense heat in the\r\nearth, and afterwards slowly cooled. Chalk is very different, and\r\nsandstone, though it is also hard, not in the least like granite.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE ROCKS WERE FORMED.\r\n\r\nWhat I have just said is about all that we know of the formation of the\r\noldest and hardest granite rocks: but there is something going on now\r\nwhich confirms the belief that the materials of which they are made\r\nwere melted together by a greater heat than we can make in our furnaces\r\nfor melting iron; for I should tell you that it is easier to melt iron\r\nand copper than granite rocks. Volcanoes often throw out melted earths\r\nwhich when cooled appear to be made of much the same materials as these\r\ngranites.\r\n\r\n\r\nSANDSTONE.\r\n\r\nBut we know more of the manner of the formation of sandstone. This rock\r\nis composed of rounded grains of sand just like that we find upon the\r\nsea shore. If you take a handful of this sand and squeeze it tightly,\r\nit will keep together a little while. Now suppose a quantity of this\r\nsand was pressed by a very great weight—the weight of a large hill\r\nfor instance—after many years the grains would stick firmly together,\r\nand become a sort of stone. It is in this way the sandstones must have\r\nbeen formed, and perhaps heat helped the work, though not so great a\r\nheat as melted the granite. The sand, after it had been washed upon\r\nthe sea shore, became gradually covered with other earths hundreds of\r\nfeet thick, and the immense weight above it pressed it into stone: but\r\nyou may imagine how very long a time it took to do this. Sandstones\r\nare used for building, but they do not last very long; the frost makes\r\nlittle cracks in them and they soon crumble away to the grains of sand\r\nof which they were made. Several fossils are found in some of these\r\nsandstones, which have been formed at many different periods of the\r\nearth’s history.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHALK.\r\n\r\nYou have seen those high cliffs of chalk along the south coast of\r\nEngland, perhaps, and you have wondered what that beautiful white\r\nearth was, and how it came there. It is found in many parts of the\r\nworld, and the south and south-east of England are to a great extent\r\ncomposed of it. The material is called by chemists carbonate of lime.\r\nIt is almost entirely made up of minute shells called _foraminifera_,\r\nfrom two Latin words which mean that there are many openings or\r\nchambers in their shells, and there are many beautiful fossils called\r\n_ammonites_ imbedded in the chalk. These are shell-fish, two or three\r\ninches, and sometimes a foot across, and their shape is very like that\r\nof the young leaves of the common fern before it has opened in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nMillions of these tiny foraminifera are living now in parts of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific oceans, and when they die their shells sink to the\r\nbottom and form a greyish mud, something like chalk.\r\n\r\nWhen H.M.S. “Challenger” was sent out in the year 1873, to find out\r\nwhat was at the bottom of the deepest seas of the World, great interest\r\nwas felt in the expedition, because we were sure that we should learn\r\nsomething about the manner in which some of the rocks were formed.\r\n\r\nWe knew that the whole of the beds of the present seas must be\r\nreceiving the washings of the rivers and the bodies of many fishes and\r\nanimals, and that the rocks of the future must be forming down there\r\nby these accumulations. Long lines were let down from the ship with a\r\ndredge at the end, and thus parts of the bottom of the sea were brought\r\nup and carefully examined. It was found that the washings, stones,\r\nclay, and mud of the land were carried hundreds of miles out to sea,\r\nand laid upon the bottom. But in the deeper parts, where the Alps would\r\nbe almost covered—there was a fine grey mud composed almost entirely of\r\nthe shells of the little foraminifera, and this, no doubt, is the chalk\r\nof future times, or perhaps limestone of a harder kind. Deeper, too,\r\nthan where this grey mud is found, there is a reddish mud, exceedingly\r\nfine and soft. We cannot exactly say yet whether this is formed from\r\nthe remains of shell-fish; but it is, at all events, very like the clay\r\nof the land, and in some future time will most likely become like\r\nthat stiff mud we know so well. So that even the materials for bricks\r\nare being made now, and perhaps when all those hundreds of islands\r\nscattered about the Pacific Ocean are joined into one great Continent,\r\nthis red mud will be raised and made use of for building the houses of\r\nnew peoples and nations.\r\n\r\nWhen we see this going on now, of course it is very easy to conclude\r\nthat the chalk, a great deal of which is above the sea now, must have\r\nbeen formed in the same way at the bottom of an ancient ocean, and\r\nafterwards raised by the same kind of upward force which made the\r\ngranite break through other earths.\r\n\r\nIf we did not know that the same cause was at work now, and that the\r\nsame kinds of shell-fish were living and laying down new beds of chalk\r\nunder the sea, we should not know how to account for the quantities of\r\nchalk in the world. For innumerable ages these little creatures have\r\nthus been paving the floor of the ocean with their dead bodies, and you\r\nmay suppose that countless millions of them must have lived and died!\r\nIn some of the chalks the shells of the foraminifera can be quite\r\ndistinctly seen with a microscope, and when these are compared with the\r\nshells of living ones, they are seen to be almost exactly alike. Next\r\ntime you pass through one of the railway cuttings through the chalk\r\nin going to Brighton, or Ramsgate, or Dover, remember that those high\r\ncliffs were built up by these Liliputian giants under the sea, and you\r\nmay think of the chalk as “foraminifera earth”.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL.\r\n\r\nYou see this black shining substance almost every day, and you know it\r\nis dug up from very deep pits where the poor miners are often killed by\r\nexplosions of gas escaping from it. But it is as well to know what it\r\nis and how it comes to be so useful to us. In the language of chemistry\r\nit is called “carbon”, and a great writer has given it the poetical\r\nname of “compressed sunlight”. But you will ask how sunlight could\r\npossibly get into a deep mine, and how it could be compressed there.\r\nYou will see that the explanation is really quite simple by-and-by.\r\nThis coal was once above ground, and was a splendid forest of waving\r\npalm-trees, and ferns, and gigantic mosses, as you will see by the\r\npictures of the fossils of them.\r\n\r\nMany of the animals and plants of past times were giants compared to\r\nthose living now, of the same species or kind, and many of the plants\r\nof the present time are dwarfs to those of the same kind which formed\r\nthe coal beds. Many generations of trees must have grown and died, and\r\nothers must have sprung up, and so on, until beds of them, some ten,\r\nothers twenty, or even thirty feet thick, were formed. Here, buried in\r\nthe coal, are the stems, leaves, bark, roots, fruit, and seeds of these\r\ntrees, and we can have no doubt that almost the whole of the coal is\r\ncomposed of them. You must not expect to find the shapes of these in\r\nevery piece of coal you may happen to look at, because most of it has\r\nbeen greatly changed by the great weight and pressure upon it, and the\r\nlength of time: but it is certainly all the same substance—wood turned\r\ninto coal. The fossil plants of the coal are of course entirely black,\r\nbut there is no mistake about their having once been living plants.\r\n\r\nYou will ask perhaps how the coal came to be buried so deep. It is not\r\nso always, being sometimes at the surface. But just as the granite has\r\nbeen pushed up through the other rocks, so has the coal in some places\r\nbeen uplifted and in others has sunk down. It was often covered up by\r\nother earths to a great depth, after the trees which composed it had\r\ndied; but where it is now at the surface these newer earths have been\r\nafterwards worn away. When the sun shone upon these coal trees they\r\ntook its warmth and light into their stems and leaves, for they could\r\nnot live without, and this made them grow so fast and become so large\r\nthat it is not untrue to call coal “compressed sunlight.” Charcoal is\r\nin some respects so like coal that it would seem to you at once that\r\nthey were probably the same material. Charcoal is simply burnt wood,\r\nand when the coal forests had died down, and when these beds sank down\r\nbeneath other layers the pressure and heat together turned the wood\r\nand leaves into a hard mass like charcoal in colour, but heavier and\r\nmore solid, and just enough of the stems and leaves have been left to\r\nenable us to know with certainty that coal was once wood.\r\n\r\nWe light our fires now and drive our steam-engines with the heat of the\r\nsun which shone upon the coal forests, and has been stored up for many\r\nthousands of years in the Earth, to be brought out once more to give us\r\nlight and warmth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAY AND MUD.\r\n\r\nWhile the ancient forests were growing up to form the coal beds,\r\nand the foraminifera were slowly building up the chalk, as I have\r\nexplained, the Earth was covered with water in some places which are\r\nnow dry land, and the sea now flows over parts of the World which were\r\nonce the habitations of plants and animals. These great changes have\r\nleft their marks upon many a mountain side, and many an old river or\r\nsea bed has become filled up. A map of Europe during the chalk period\r\nwould show that the places where Paris, London, Copenhagen, and Berlin\r\nnow are were then under the ocean; but since then these places have\r\nbeen lifted up, and mud, clay, and gravel swept over the chalk in many\r\nplaces by the action of new rivers and seas. Water, you perceive, has\r\nhad a great deal to do with these changes, and indeed it is one of\r\nNature’s most powerful tools, for it can wash down rocks and cliffs and\r\ncut its way in rivers for thousands of miles over the Earth’s surface.\r\nIt carries down mud, and clay, and gravel, and this soil, which has\r\nbeen named alluvium, is one of the most interesting of all to us,\r\nbecause it contains the bones of the immense animals we shall talk\r\nabout presently, as well as those of the oldest races of men with their\r\nweapons and ornaments.\r\n\r\nThe mud age, and we are in the mud and gravel age now, belongs to what\r\nis called the Tertiary period, and we shall see that this age has\r\nlasted a very long time already, so long that though it is still going\r\non, the most extraordinary animals have lived and died, and not one of\r\nthem is now left alive. Still the same washing and cutting of water is\r\ngoing on which buried their bones in swamps, and bogs, and river caves,\r\nand may perhaps carry away some of the bones of us who are living now,\r\nto be found ages afterwards by future generations who will read our\r\nhistory in these silent witnesses, as we read the history of the tree\r\nferns and foraminifera in the coal and the chalk.\r\n\r\nThe present age of the World’s history is the Mud age, or, as we shall\r\ncall it in future, the Tertiary period, and I think you will agree with\r\nme when I come to describe it, that it contains the most interesting of\r\nall the pieces of “the puzzle of life.”\r\n\r\nThe earth of the Tertiary period is very different from a great many of\r\nthe older earths. Clay, mud, and gravel are the washings only of the\r\nolder rocks, the fine particles which have been worn off from them by\r\nfrost and water and carried down by rivers and left in large beds, and\r\nsometimes they have a good deal of decayed wood and weeds mixed with\r\nthem. Here are found the bones of the great animals which were so much\r\nlarger and stronger than those of the same kind living now, or any that\r\nlived before them.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPHEAVAL AND DEPRESSION.\r\n\r\nThese two words are so often used in books on geology that we shall\r\nnot be able to get on without knowing their meaning. We have seen\r\nthat the rocks have been formed in a certain way—some by heat, some\r\nby water, and some by dead forests—and that they lie over one another\r\nin pretty regular order. But this order has sometimes been disturbed\r\nand the layers have been tumbled about among one another very much. In\r\nsome places the older rocks, such as granite, slate, and sandstone,\r\nhave been pushed up through those above, and in others the coal has\r\nsunk down and been covered with thick layers of chalk, sand, and mud.\r\nWhen the force below pushes a layer up through the others it is called\r\n_upheaval_, and when a layer sinks down it is called _depression_,\r\nor _subsidence_. Both these actions are going on now in different\r\nparts of the Earth. A great part of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, of\r\nSpitzbergen, Siberia, and the north of America, is being slowly raised\r\nhigher above the sea, as we know by the height their old sea beaches\r\nnow are above the water; while part of the shore of America opposite\r\nto Europe and also the south of Greenland is slowly sinking down, as\r\nwe know by the remains of land animals and trees which are now covered\r\nby the tide; and at many places on the coast of India this subsidence\r\nis also going on. Nearer home, too, there is an example of it in the\r\nisland of Guernsey. All round the coast of this island, like that of\r\nJersey, are found tree trunks and other remains of old forest land\r\nbeneath the water. Old histories refer to this as dry land; and if a\r\nmap of it made in 1406 is correct, this land must have sunk about 150\r\nfeet since that time.\r\n\r\nThus we can see, even at the present time, the very same changes which\r\nhave worked upon our Earth for innumerable ages. It is now easy to\r\nunderstand how the forests which must have grown above in the air\r\nhave, after a long time, sunk down to a great depth, and been turned\r\ninto coal, and covered with the sediment, sand, gravel, and chalk from\r\nthe seas which afterwards flowed over the places where they grew.\r\n\r\nSometimes the rocks by the sea shore are cut into terraces or steps\r\nby the constant wear of the water, and when we see these water marks\r\nfar above the present level of the sea we know that the land must have\r\nbeen lifted up gradually above the sea. There are many such terraces in\r\nNorway. To prove whether this is so marks have been cut upon rocks at\r\na measured height above the sea, and after some years these marks have\r\nbeen noticed to have been raised much above the water by the “upheaval”\r\nof the earth at that place.\r\n\r\nGenerally this change of level has taken place gradually, and the\r\ngreatest work in moving the layers of earth and displacing them has\r\nbeen very slow. But in some places violent and sudden shocks have\r\nhappened, tearing up the rocks and piling them up in heaps; and now\r\nand then islands have suddenly appeared in the sea and vanished out\r\nof sight completely in a short time. Islands have thus come up in the\r\nMediterranean Sea within the memory of man. In the year 1831 the island\r\nof Julia suddenly appeared near the coast of Sicily, and since the year\r\n186 B.C. no less than three islands have started up in the bay of the\r\nisland of Santorin. In this century islands have appeared among the\r\nAzores, the Indian Archipelago, the Philippines, the Moluccas, and on\r\nthe coast of Kamtschatka and other places. Some of these have appeared\r\nsuddenly, others slowly, and they no doubt have been raised by a great\r\nforce from below.\r\n\r\nYou will see now how easy it is to account for the changes of the\r\nplaces of the layers of rock. The same thing is going on now which\r\nhas been going on throughout all time, only perhaps with more energy\r\nformerly than now, making mountains, islands, and continents, raising\r\nup a large tract of land in one place and sinking an island or a sea\r\nshore in another.\r\n\r\nThese changes have been of great use to us too. Suppose all England\r\nhad been covered with coal or slate, we should not have been able to\r\ngrow anything! As it is we have sand and gravel in one county, chalk in\r\nanother, slate or granite in another, and coal down below in several,\r\nand we can grow a great variety of plants on all these different soils.\r\nWe have to thank “upheaval” and “depression” for this. The force which\r\nis always working below us has turned up the different soils like a\r\ngigantic plough, and brought some to the top and covered others, so\r\nthat instead of having to dig down deeper than ever we have yet, we\r\nhave only to go from one county to another to find the different rocks.\r\nWe know that we could not get at the coal in Sussex without going down\r\nan unknown depth through the chalk and other earths, but we dig for it\r\nin the North of England, where we know its depth below the surface.\r\n\r\nI will try now to give you some idea of the way in which the rocks come\r\nin their order, or the succession of formations as geologists call\r\nit. If we started to walk from Wales to London the rocks we should\r\npass over would be—slate and flagstones in Wales, and going on towards\r\nLondon, limestone, old red sandstone, more limestones, coal beds, new\r\nred sandstone, oolite, greensand, chalk, and last London clay. We\r\nmight not always find each of these near the surface, but they would\r\nbe found to be the principal rocks on a line between Wales and London,\r\nthe oldest being in Wales and the newest or most recent as we get\r\nnearer London. That word “oolite” which I used comes from two Greek\r\nwords meaning “roe” and “stone,” because the rock is composed of little\r\nrounded grains of a chalky substance shaped like the hard roe of a\r\nfish, or like sago before it is cooked.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the following table you will see how the principal rocks\r\nare placed one upon the other, beginning at the lowest or oldest at the\r\nbottom and going up to the newest at the top of the table, and on the\r\nright hand side I have written the names of the principal fossils which\r\neach kind of earth contains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF THE SUCCESSION OF FORMATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERTIARY, or Upper Rocks\r\n\r\n  Peat bogs and caves          Fossil Man, with stone implements,\r\n  River-mud and brickearth,     &c., mammoth,\r\n   gravels, and                 hippopotamus, rhinoceros,\r\n   boulder clay (alluvium)      Irish stag, cave lion,\r\n                                &c.\r\n  Crag of Eastern Counties     Numerous shell-fish, mastodon\r\n  London clay, &c.

Mountains have been raised, and whole\r\ncontinents have been sunk by movements so slow that if the hands of a\r\nclock went only once round the dial in a year the hand would go faster\r\nthan these mountains have risen or the continents sunk. Almost always\r\nwhenever there has been sudden and _violent_ action it has been near\r\nvolcanoes or during earthquakes; but these things, terrible as they\r\nare to the people living near, disturb only a very small part of the\r\nsurface, and such violence neither buried the coal beds nor raised\r\nthe slate hills of Wales. Many of the small effects of the internal\r\nforce of the earth have been sudden and violent, but the greatest and\r\ngrandest have been slower than anything we can imagine.\r\n\r\nIf this had not been so, we should not find fossil shells just as they\r\nsank quietly to the bottom of ancient seas, quite undisturbed. We\r\nshould not find delicate ferns and insects with all their breakable\r\nparts perfectly preserved, and as lightly laid as if you had put\r\nthem away carefully in a cabinet upon cotton wool. Yet many of these\r\nhave sunk down hundreds of feet below the open air where they _must_\r\nhave lived. We find the ripple marks of the waves on old sandstones,\r\nand even the prints of the feet of birds and animals as they walked\r\nupon that rock when it was soft sand, and the little pits made by\r\nrain-drops on the moist earth. All this speaks of stillness, and\r\ngentle movement, no violence. So slowly and softly have these rocks\r\nsettled down, that we can read in them the history of the life that\r\nwas. But if there had been any sudden and rough movement all these\r\nfossils might have been broken up and we should have had nothing but\r\nfragments, and the “puzzle of life” could never have been put together.\r\nNature’s forces are immense, but they work slowly, irresistibly, and\r\nmajestically.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ICE AGE.\r\n\r\nWe have seen now what the principal rocks are made of and the way\r\nin which their places have been changed by upheaval and depression.\r\nWater, as we know, has been at work and has done great things in _all_\r\nages of the World’s history. I have called it “one of Nature’s most\r\npowerful tools,” and when we look at the quantity of chalk alone that\r\nthere is in the world, and remember that this was all laid down in\r\nwater, and perhaps a great part of its lime carried down by rivers to\r\nthe seas where it settled to the bottom, after the corals and small\r\nshell-fish had worked it into their bodies, we are right in thinking\r\nwater a great Magician indeed. Why, even so small a river as the Thames\r\ncarries down to the sea every year as much dissolved earth as would\r\nmake a good large hill; and what must such rivers as the Nile, the\r\nAmazon, the Mississippi, and the great Chinese rivers do! There must\r\nhave been gigantic rivers, too, in the old times, or else it would have\r\nbeen impossible that the deep sandstone and slate beds could have been\r\nformed; for these are all laid down by the washing away of earth in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIce, which is only solid water, has also been a powerful tool in\r\nshaping the surface of the Earth, but it has not been _always_ at\r\nwork as water has. Ice now covers only a comparatively small part of\r\nthe globe near the north and south poles, and mountains like those in\r\nSwitzerland; but by watching what ice is doing now in these places we\r\nare able to be certain that there has been a time when it covered\r\nScotland, Cumberland, Wales, Sweden and Norway, and nearly all North\r\nAmerica. In watching the great “rivers of ice,” called glaciers, in\r\nthe Alps, for instance, we see that they slip down from the mountains\r\nslowly, creeping on year by year, and bringing with them pieces of\r\nrock and stones. We see also where they have melted that they have\r\nbeen grinding the rocks beneath them with their great weight, and have\r\ncut grooves into, and scraped and polished the hardest granite. The\r\nstones underneath the glaciers have been pressed so heavily upon the\r\nrocks that they have left deep marks, and we find the same kinds of\r\nmarks and heaps of stones in many mountains where there are no glaciers\r\nnow. There are other things too which convince us that a great ice\r\nsheet spread over almost the whole of Great Britain. When the huge\r\nicebergs break away from the frozen shores of Greenland and North\r\nAmerica, they often have frozen into their ice large blocks of rock,\r\nsand, gravel, &c., and when they drift into the warmer seas of the\r\nsouth they melt, and of course these blocks or “boulders,” as they are\r\ncalled, sink to the bottom. Just the same kind of boulders are found\r\nin many parts of the world, where icebergs never come now, and as they\r\nare of a different rock from that on which they lie, they must have\r\nbeen brought there somehow. We naturally suppose then that they were\r\nbrought by icebergs. Sometimes boulders of granite have been found thus\r\namong clay, many miles from where there are any granite rocks on the\r\nsurface, and there can be no doubt that they were originally frozen\r\ninto an iceberg, which floated away with them and when it melted left\r\nthem so far from their native place. In many of the midland and eastern\r\ncounties once floated these icebergs, dropping the stones and boulders\r\nwhich they brought away from the Welsh, Cumberland, and Scottish\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the earth must have been fearfully cold when our country\r\nwas covered with ice, just as Greenland is now. Geologists suppose that\r\nthere must have been more than one age of ice, and that between these\r\nages the climate of the world was pretty much the same as at present,\r\nalthough it is certain that there were periods when England was much\r\nwarmer, because many of the fossil plants could not have grown in a\r\ncold climate.\r\n\r\nYou will want to know whether there were any land animals living during\r\nthe ice periods. It is impossible to be quite certain, but it is most\r\nlikely that the mammoth was living both before and during the _last_\r\nice age, because its bones have been found among the earths brought\r\ndown by the glaciers.\r\n\r\nI have said all you will be likely to remember at present about the\r\nnature of the different rocks, but it will help you to understand\r\nbetter how they have been laid one upon the other, and how they have\r\nbeen moved and broken by upheaval and subsidence, if you look at the\r\ndrawings on page 51.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENUDATION.\r\n\r\nIt has often happened that some of the harder and older rocks, like\r\ngranite and slate, have pushed themselves through those earths lying\r\nabove them, and then the sea or a great river has washed away all the\r\nearths from one side of the rock. The rain, too, falling for thousands\r\nof years, has swept them down into the valleys and mixed them together.\r\nThis is called denudation, or “laying bare” the harder rocks by washing\r\nthe softer ones away from them. Those beds of pebbles on the sea shore\r\nalso have been battering against the rocks for ages and very gradually\r\nwearing them away, as you can see if you watch the stones being driven\r\ninto and sucked out of holes and cracks by every wave. Thus, both\r\nthe loose stones and the solid rocks get polished and ground away,\r\nand Nature is always destroying and making again by turns. If this\r\ndestruction went on continually without any raising of the land to make\r\nup for it, the surface of the whole Earth would in time become level;\r\nbut old sea beds are always being slowly raised above the water and\r\nprepared for the growth of plants and the habitation of animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Upheaval._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Subsidence._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Denudation._]\r\n\r\nIf you watch the little rills of water on any rainy day, trickling\r\ndown a hill, or the springs which bubble up at the foot of cliffs on\r\nthe sea shore, you will see an example of denudation in a small way.\r\nThe earth is washed off the surface here and there, and carried down\r\nand laid up in banks in some places, and the harder ground underneath\r\nis laid bare. Little beds of stones are collected in one place, and\r\nsticks and straws and such light things in another, and this is just\r\nwhat has been done on a large scale in mountain regions, all over the\r\nworld for many centuries.\r\n\r\nIn the uppermost sketch on page 51 you will see how the granite has\r\nbeen lifted up with the layers of other earth along its sides, and\r\nafterwards even layers have been deposited above; in the second there\r\nhas been a great crack in the land, and a great mass of rock has\r\nsubsided, and the hollow has become filled up in time with clay, and\r\nmould, and rich soil, so that some one has built a house and made a\r\ngarden on it; in the third the river has cut a gorge in rocks which\r\nwere once continuous from cliff to cliff, wearing away the softer\r\nearths more easily than the harder. If the Earth was cut into in\r\ndifferent places we should find the rocks arranged in a very similar\r\nway to that in the three sketches.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOILING SPRINGS, ETC.\r\n\r\nIn several different countries there are very strange sights, but\r\nscarcely anything is more astonishing than the fountains of boiling\r\nwater which shoot up out of the ground. There are a good many of them\r\nnot far from us, in Iceland, and many hundreds in Wyoming in America,\r\nand they are called “geysers.” Steam and boiling water, and sometimes\r\nmud, are thrown up by these natural fountains to a height of 200\r\nfeet—as high as the top of the spire of a church. The water must come\r\nfrom a great depth in the ground—perhaps many thousand feet down—where\r\nthe heat is intense. This water springing up with clouds of snow-white\r\nsteam, and falling all round in showers, has a most beautiful\r\nappearance. These geysers now and then throw out very little water,\r\njust bubbling up above the ground, and then travellers boil eggs and\r\nchickens and such things in them, and have a pic-nic near them. It is\r\nimpossible to say how long they have lasted, but we know from history\r\nthat some have been spouting out water for at least 2,000 years, and\r\nhow much longer no one can tell. They may have something to do with\r\nvolcanoes, because water may have found its way to the heated interior\r\nof the earth, and being converted into steam, expands and causes an\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nNow that we have some idea of the construction of the Earth, we must\r\ngo on to the _life_ of the wonderful plants and creatures which have\r\npeopled it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE VEGETABLE PART._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAWN OF LIFE.\r\n\r\nThe first beams of the rising sun, and the first grey light of the\r\nmorning, tell us of the coming day; but we cannot even think of the\r\ndawn of that far-off day in the Earth’s history, when no voice of man\r\nor beast was heard, and no trees or grass covered it, without solemn\r\nwonder at the immense distance that day is from us. A thousand ages are\r\nin the sight of the Creator but as yesterday, and the period of man’s\r\nexistence is only a moment compared to that of the lowly creatures\r\nwhich built up this World for him. In the first seas and on the land\r\nnothing was heard but the rushing of waters and the roaring of the\r\nfires of volcanoes.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to be quite certain whether the first living things\r\nwere animals or plants; but I think it most likely that very simple\r\nplants grew first, and that very simple animals came after or with\r\nthem. Among the first of these, or perhaps the very first, were some\r\nsmall animals called _Eozöon_, which means the “life-dawn animal,” and\r\nwith them grew some simple plants. On the banks of the St. Lawrence\r\nriver in Canada there is a great bed of rock called the Laurentian\r\nrocks, made almost entirely of the tiny remains of the “life-dawn\r\nanimal,” which, when we look at them through a microscope, are found\r\nto possess nearly the same structure as some lowly organized shells\r\nliving in the seas now. These rocks are found in many parts of the\r\nworld besides—in Eastern America, Bavaria, Scotland, and Norway; and\r\nin some places their thickness has been estimated at thirty thousand\r\nfeet, or nearly six miles, or one hundred times as thick as St. Paul’s\r\nCathedral is high! These little creatures you see were at work over a\r\ngreat part of the Earth’s surface, and you may fancy how many thousands\r\nof thousands of years it took them to build up these rocks. The\r\n“life-dawn animal” is far older than the chalk-building foraminifera,\r\nand so far as we know it lived alone in its seas. There were none of\r\nthe beautiful twisted _ammonite_ shell-fish, nor the shark-like fishes\r\nof the chalk seas. The eozöon was the only kind of living creature, the\r\n“lord of creation” for the time; and though storms raged in the seas it\r\ninhabited, the water was so deep that it lived on undisturbed. When you\r\nare able to use a microscope you will be able to see the traces left by\r\nthese tiny animals in what is now hard stone.[1]\r\n\r\nLife began in a very small way: there were none of the great land\r\nanimals we have now; but these seemingly insignificant builders were at\r\nwork so long that they made the immense rocks I have told you of. But\r\nthis is not all. About this time some very simple plants grew on the\r\nland, and were carried down by the rivers and formed deep beds. After\r\na long time these became covered up with different earths and were\r\nturned into the substance called “black-lead,” which you use in drawing\r\npencils. But this is not really lead; it is almost pure carbon—in\r\nfact, the oldest kind of coal—so old that it will not now burn like\r\ncoal, and is entirely made up of fossil plants crushed out of shape, so\r\nthat we cannot now trace their forms, as we can the plants of the coal.\r\nWhen then you next take up a drawing pencil it will be easy to remember\r\nthat the black substance which marks the paper was once a living plant,\r\nnow changed by heat and pressure into almost pure carbon. As the name\r\neozöon has been given to the “life-dawn animal,” I will give this\r\nblack-lead the name of _Eodendron_, or the “dawn-plant.”[2]\r\n\r\nTwo very simple forms of life then occupied the earth and sea at the\r\nearliest time when anything at all was living, and strangely enough we\r\nuse the dead bodies of both of them. We build houses of the rocks the\r\neozöon laid down at the bottom of the sea, and the beautiful art of\r\ndrawing is carried on with the carbon from the first plant life of the\r\nworld—the eodendron.\r\n\r\nI must take you away presently to the coal, and sandstone, and chalk,\r\nand show you how plants and animals gradually increased in number and\r\nsize, and fishes began to inhabit the seas, and all living things were\r\nslowly going on to greater perfection; for as time went on there was a\r\nsteady progress from creatures like the eozöon, which had scarcely any\r\npower of moving about, to the active, quarrelsome and greedy things\r\nlike crabs and lobsters which came after them, and the gigantic ferns\r\nof the coal beds. The peaceful “life-dawn animals” drew their food from\r\nthe vegetable substances dissolved in the waters, though they perhaps\r\nalso lived on animals still smaller than themselves; but, by-and-by,\r\ncreatures, which must have been monsters to them, swarmed in the seas\r\nand devoured their smaller companions wholesale; and in time the Earth\r\nbecame very much the same as it is now, a place where the struggle for\r\nlife is always going on. It is certain that animals have fed upon one\r\nanother from the very beginning; but this is no doubt a wise law of the\r\nCreator to prevent them from increasing too fast, as they would do if\r\nall that were born lived, and none were destroyed.\r\n\r\nWe know much less about the vegetation—the plants and grasses—of the\r\nearly ages of the world than of the animals; because plants rot away\r\nfaster than bones and shells, and, besides, are less likely to be found\r\nin places where they would be preserved. A dead tree might be eaten up\r\nentirely by insects, as the white ants eat up fallen trees in a short\r\ntime in tropical countries, and what is left of them crumbles away to\r\nfine powder and mixes with the soil. Immense trees are thus devoured\r\nnow by millions of tiny insects no longer than your thumb nail, in\r\nIndia and Australia. No such thing as a whole and perfect fossil tree\r\nwith every twig and leaf has been found; but then the coal beds are\r\nreally great forests which have been buried for so long a time that\r\nthey have quite altered in appearance. Still, among these coal beds we\r\noften find the bark, fruit, stems, and branches of trees very much like\r\nfirs, and ferns, and huge club-mosses, which have the same shape they\r\nhad when living, though they are quite black, and burn exactly like\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nBut there were plants long before the coal forests lived, and many\r\nfossil sea weeds are found in the old sandstones and limestones in\r\nWales and other places.[3] The Old Red Sandstone, whose position you\r\ncan see below the coal in the table of succession of formations, page\r\n42, does not give us many fossil plants, though fishes and shells are\r\ncommon. This rock is found in Scotland, Herefordshire, Devonshire, and\r\nIreland, as well as other places, and is often more than 2,000 feet\r\nthick. It was not all formed in salt water we know, because many of the\r\nfossil fishes and shells it contains are fresh water kinds. It must\r\nall have been made of the pieces of still older rocks worn away by\r\nrivers and settled like a sediment in immense lakes, some of which were\r\nfresh water. Then, after the Old Red Sandstone, came a time when the\r\nlimestones below the coal were laid down at the bottom of a vast sea,\r\nand here the remains of land plants are of course few. Then it seems\r\nthere must have been a very long time when there were large continents\r\nall over the world raised above the seas, but not very much, and on\r\nthese the forests grew which afterwards became coal fields. Until this\r\ntime the plants had been mostly water weeds, reeds, rushes, and sea\r\nweeds, and it was not until England and Ireland became one continent,\r\nas they were once and covered with woods, that the great period of\r\nvegetation began.\r\n\r\nThe growth of plants was then most wonderful; but although coal is\r\nfound in many different parts of the world, it was not all formed at\r\none time, and though it is plentiful in England and Wales, Scotland,\r\nIreland, France, Belgium, Russia, Hungary, Australia, New Zealand,\r\nChina, and Borneo, it is older in some countries than in others. It\r\nis fortunate, however, that this useful material was made in Nature’s\r\nworkshop in so many different countries, or it would have to be carried\r\nfrom one to another. The coal forests were not the same trees as we\r\nhave now—oaks, elms, ashes, limes, and so on. Most of them had rather\r\nhollow trunks and splendid waving tops like ferns and reeds, though\r\nthere were some like our fir-trees.\r\n\r\nIf you lie down in the long grass before it is mown, and look through\r\nthe stalks and fancy yourself an inch high only, you will have some\r\nidea how the coal forest would have looked if you had lived then.\r\nBut there were no human beings on the Earth then, and I do not think\r\nthere were any large animals, at least none have been found in the\r\ncoal itself, except in Switzerland, where a few bones of the mammoth\r\n(an ancient elephant) and of the rhinoceros have been discovered in\r\nthe much newer beds of coal, and also those of a large reptile like a\r\ncrocodile in the coal beds of Ohio in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: II.\r\n\r\n_Fossil Tree Fern._\r\n\r\n_Calamites._\r\n\r\n_Lepidodendron._\r\n\r\n_Different Kinds of Plants of the Coal Forests._]\r\n\r\nIn such immense forests insects must certainly have been plentiful,\r\nand some of the fossil bodies of beetles, dragon-flies, and spiders,\r\nhave been preserved, and a few tree lizards.[4] Of course the edges of\r\nthe coal forests were washed here and there by the salt sea, and\r\nthere must have been some fresh water rivers and ponds, for we find\r\nboth fresh and salt water shells in these beds. It was almost dark in\r\nthese forests, so thickly did the plants grow together. There were\r\nenormous club-mosses close together and as high as most houses, with\r\ntheir leaves interlaced making a complete network to shut out the sun.\r\nBut the sun which shone on the forests was warm, and the air which went\r\nthrough them was soft, or they would not have grown so wonderfully.\r\nIndeed, there can be no doubt that the climate of northern regions was\r\nonce much warmer than it is now. A thick bed of coal was discovered\r\nby the Arctic Expedition in 1875-6 actually within five hundred miles\r\nof the North Pole, where the ice on the sea is now thirty or forty\r\nfeet thick![5] The forest which formed this coal could only have grown\r\nin a temperate climate, and there are no forests there now; it is so\r\nintensely cold they could not live. There must then have been a great\r\nchange in the climate of the Arctic regions since that coal was living\r\nvegetation. The few plants and mosses which can live there now are of a\r\nvery different and more hardy kind than those of the coal forests.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the engraving facing page 64, you will see a drawing of\r\none of the tree ferns with its delicate fronds which grew so abundantly\r\nin the coal forests, and there are many other plants, some like the\r\ncommon “mare’s tails,” or _calamites_, growing in shallow ponds and\r\nditches now—only the “mare’s tails” or calamites of the coal forests\r\nwere as high as poplars.[6] You can imagine what a splendid sight these\r\nforests of ferns, club-mosses, and “mare’s tails,” must have been, and\r\nwhat a multitude of beautiful insects and butterflies must have flitted\r\nabout in them; but their frail bodies have almost all perished, so that\r\nwe know very little of the animated creatures of the time.\r\n\r\nBesides several sorts of coal both soft and hard there is a substance\r\ncalled “lignite,” which is scarcely wood and scarcely coal, of a brown\r\ncolour. In fact, lignite is wood almost turned to coal, and it has\r\nhelped us to learn that coal was once living wood; but it is not nearly\r\nso old as the coal. Then again there is the beautiful substance called\r\n“jet” used for making bracelets. This is a kind of fossil gum or pitch\r\ndropped from the trees while they were growing, and, though different\r\nin colour, it is much the same in kind as amber. Amber is often found\r\nwith flies, spiders, and small leaves imbedded in it. When this fossil\r\nresin or gum was flowing out of the ancient pine-trees, and was quite\r\nsticky, flies settled upon it and became entangled in it, and as more\r\nof the gum flowed out they became quite covered. Then the gum dropped\r\nfrom the tree and hardened, and it is now found in lumps on the shores\r\nof the Baltic Sea, and in beds of sand and clay with fossil wood. It is\r\nof a beautiful bright yellow colour, and beads for necklaces and other\r\nornaments are made out of it.\r\n\r\nIf we arrange the things we have been talking about in order, the\r\noldest first, they would come thus: plumbago or black-lead—or, as I\r\nhave called it, eodendron, “the life-dawn plant”—first, then hard coal,\r\nthen soft coal, then lignite and jet, then bog oak and peat. But I\r\nmust tell you something about bog oak and peat. In many of the swamps\r\nand bogs of the World the trunks of dead trees are found, which have\r\nbecome quite black and almost like lignite, because they have been\r\nburied so long. Thus, in the bogs of Ireland oak trees are often found,\r\nand they were most likely living when the reindeer inhabited Ireland.\r\nThis old bogwood is made into beads for necklaces and other ornaments.\r\nPeat is a partly decayed vegetable substance, with beautiful little\r\nplants growing on its surface, and is really coal in its infancy. It\r\nis found all over the world more or less in wet places, and consists\r\nof the roots and stems of mosses and reeds, some of which are like\r\nthe gigantic plants of the coal period, but very small in comparison.\r\nI have no doubt that in time some of these peat bogs may be turned\r\ninto coal if they sink down and become covered with other earths, but\r\nat present they are all on the surface and so soft that they are\r\ndangerous to walk upon because one may sink in and be smothered.\r\n\r\nThis, as far as we can trace it, is a sketch of the history of\r\nvegetable life on our Earth. We will go back to the coal for a moment\r\nand see what the animal life of that time was. The seas of the time of\r\nthe coal forests were sometimes shallow, sometimes deep, and in the\r\nlimestone rocks of the oceans which separated the great continents of\r\nthat time there is a record of the inhabitants of the seas. The land\r\nplants were of more than 1,000 different kinds, and there were more\r\nthan 200 kinds of fishes in the waters, and corals, shells, and small\r\ncrab-like animals innumerable. The fishes were fellows with terrible\r\nteeth, and their bodies were covered with strong hard scales. One of\r\nthese fish was thirty feet long, and there were others of considerable\r\nsize. It is curious that the fishes of this time remind one of reptiles\r\n(lizards and crocodiles), just as the birds of a future time seem to\r\nhave something of the reptile about them, as you will see by-and-by.\r\n\r\nI dare say you have remarked while reading that all the plants and\r\nanimals of the early ages of the world seem to be made on a simple\r\nplan, and as the Earth grows older they become more perfect, and this\r\nis just what I want you to take notice of all through. The plants\r\nof the coal period, you have seen, were nothing like so perfect in\r\nconstruction, beautiful as they were, as the forest trees of the\r\npresent time, neither were the animals so perfect as those living now.\r\nThere has been _progress_, step by step, throughout the vegetable and\r\nanimal creation; and, though many of the lower forms of the early ages\r\nexist now, there are others far superior to them which did not exist\r\nthen: but all this will come in “The Animal Part.”\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the Earth’s age came the wonderful period of\r\nvegetation which gave us our coal, and after that there was a great and\r\nbusy time, when huge reptiles and reptile-like birds, and then true\r\nbirds, made their appearance. But that belongs to the next part of the\r\n“puzzle of life.”\r\n\r\nIf we look with astonishment at the coal forests, we may also well\r\nthink of them with thankfulness. Here is the sunshine of past ages\r\nstored up for our use, and we bring it out again to warm ourselves,\r\ncook our food, make all our iron things, and drive our steam-engines!\r\nCan any romance be finer than this, that we are carried across to\r\nAmerica and India and Australia in steam-boats driven by the “fossil\r\nsunlight” of ages and ages past, and whirled along at sixty miles an\r\nhour over iron rails by the same stored-up strength?\r\n\r\nIf you doubt this, think of living trees. Do they not live by the air\r\nand sunlight? Will they grow without these? They spread their branches\r\nand leaves to gather the warmth and light from the air, and when they\r\nare cut down and dried, and you put a match to the wood, all the old\r\nwarmth and light come out again; and we know that the coal is only\r\nfossil wood. Our Creator wastes nothing. Even when there were no people\r\nliving to rejoice in the sun, He thought of those people who _should_\r\ncome in time, and not one of the fiery rays of the fierce sun was lost.\r\nThese mighty forests were sent to gather it, and when they had died\r\ndown they sank below the surface and were covered from the air, that\r\nnone of their light or heat should escape.\r\n\r\nIn such forests it is strange that there were no birds, especially as\r\nthere were swarms of insects, and no doubt abundance of worms. But no\r\nbone of bird or any trace of feathered songster of these lovely groves\r\nhas yet been found. Little lizards chased flies and beetles up and down\r\nthe stems of the club-mosses and ferns, and larger reptiles lurked in\r\nthe long damp grass under the shade. The pools and ponds were filled\r\nwith curious fishes, and reefs of beautiful white coral fringed all the\r\nshores of the seas.\r\n\r\nBut the Earth was not fit for the habitation of man. The fruits of the\r\ntrees were not such as he could have eaten, and their wood was not hard\r\nenough to build houses of. Still it was being got ready for him, and\r\nnot a leaf waved uselessly in the bright, warm air, and not a tree fell\r\nto the ground, but it was to be turned into coal, and to come forth\r\nagain one day a hard black lump, without any of its former beauty, but\r\nto give back the light and heat it had gathered from the sun ages and\r\nages ago.\r\n\r\nMany periods in the Earth’s history have passed since the coal period,\r\nand in every one of these the trees have been increasing in perfection,\r\nthough there have never since been such great numbers of a few kinds\r\ngrowing. When we come to the more lately formed beds of earth we begin\r\nto find the cypress, willow, ash, oak, elm, and other forest trees\r\nwhich are living now. The trunks of these trees, blackened by age, lie\r\nburied in peat bogs and swamps all over Europe. The mighty Mississippi\r\nriver brings down immense quantities of dead trees, and as these sink\r\nto the bottom near its mouth they are forming future coal beds. Along\r\nthe coast of Norfolk and Suffolk, too, and stretching far away under\r\nthe German Ocean, is an old English forest. In some places the trunks\r\nof the buried trees may be seen standing upright just where they grew.\r\nThe nets of the fishermen are continually bringing up pieces of wood,\r\nroots, and seeds; and when the sea washes away the soft cliffs here the\r\nbones, teeth, and tusks of the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and\r\nother large animals which inhabited this forest, may be seen in great\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nDown below the waves of ocean have these woods sunk with all their once\r\nliving creatures, and though you may suppose that it must have been\r\nvery long ago that they grew, they are of the same kind as those which\r\nnow make the hills and valleys of England beautiful.\r\n\r\nSometimes a forest must sink very fast, for travellers have told us how\r\nthey have sailed on rivers and lakes over the tops of sunken trees,\r\nand, looking down into the clear water, have seen the branches waving\r\nbelow—tall trees standing upright at the bottom, and the boats sailing\r\nover their tops!\r\n\r\nWe must now pass on to the living creatures which peopled the Earth,\r\nand their story can be told with more certainty than that of the\r\nperishable plants which clothed the surface of the ground, and, while\r\nthey rendered it beautiful, also served as food and shelter for\r\ninnumerable animals, and have become so useful to us as coal, lignite,\r\nblack-lead, and other productions of ancient forests.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Specimen in Table-case 15, Room V., North Gallery British Museum.\r\n\r\n[2] The name _Eophyton_ has also been suggested for the earliest\r\nvegetable forms.\r\n\r\n[3] Divisions A and B of Case 1, Room I., North Gallery, contain some\r\nof the oldest known fossil plants.\r\n\r\n[4] Fossil insects in Table-case No. 14, Room V.\r\n\r\n[5] In 81° 44′ N. latitude.\r\n\r\n[6] Specimens of plants from the coal in Cases No. 2, 3, 4, in Room I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE ANIMAL PART._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe must now go back and collect the smaller pieces of “the puzzle”\r\nwhich make up the animal part. The great periods of vegetation ended in\r\nour country with the coal forests, and there has been no such wonderful\r\ngrowth of plants since the time when the New Red Sandstone, lying above\r\nthe coal, was formed; though no doubt trees and plants have since\r\nflourished, as they do now on the Earth, but not in such quantities as\r\nduring the coal period.\r\n\r\nWe remember that the eozöon, “the life-dawn animal,” is the oldest\r\nanimal we know of, and that it lived so long ago as when the Laurentian\r\nrocks were laid down at the bottom of the seas of that time; then in\r\nlater rocks we find the burrows of sea worms in the stone, and later\r\nstill simple shells with two valves like the common mussel, and other\r\nanimals of a simple kind, like the corals, sponges, and star-fishes\r\nwhich exist now. There must have been millions of these creatures in\r\nthe older limestone seas, for the rocks are almost entirely composed\r\nof their fossil shells and bodies. By-and-by a rather superior animal\r\ninhabited the seas of Wales, called a trilobite, of which you will see\r\na picture on the opposite page. This curious animal was of the same\r\nfamily as the shrimps and prawns, but much larger, and he must have\r\nbeen a giant among the others. None of these animals had any bones, you\r\nmust understand; but they had a hard shelly covering to support their\r\nsoft bodies inside, and no doubt the trilobites were able to swim about\r\nvery fast.[7]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: III.\r\n\r\n_Trilobite._]\r\n\r\nWhat I want you to take notice of now is the _progress_ that has been\r\ngoing on from the almost motionless eozöon to the shell-fish and\r\nstar-fish, which could crawl along the bottom of the sea and over the\r\nrocks, to this active, quick-moving trilobite, with his great paddles.\r\nThen the next step is a very great one, when we come to animals with\r\nbones. The first of these are fishes. All the other bones are joined to\r\nthe backbone, therefore all animals with bones are called _vertebrata_,\r\nwhich is a Latin word meaning having a backbone with joints. Now\r\nanimals with bones are plainly superior to those with only shells, and\r\nwhen we find fishes among the rocks of Wales and Devonshire we know\r\nthat we are beginning to pick up some important pieces of the “puzzle\r\nof life.” These fishes were most of them related to the sturgeon, and\r\ntheir bones and teeth are found in great quantities in the Old Red\r\nSandstone rocks, just below the coal.[8]\r\n\r\nIt is not until we get above the coal into the oolite or egg-stone\r\nrocks that still larger and altogether superior animals, both of sea\r\nand land, began to increase, and this is called\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF REPTILES.\r\n\r\nThis has been called the reptile age because there were such numbers\r\nof animals like crocodiles, lizards, and tortoises (which are all\r\nreptiles), and some of them were of immense size. For instance, there\r\nwas a huge creature something like a frog, but as large as a Shetland\r\npony, called the _Labyrinthodon_, with a great many curious teeth, and\r\nthis animal has left footprints in the New Red Sandstone which have\r\nbeen dried and buried, we can’t tell how long, and there are the cracks\r\nmade by the sun drying the place he walked over when that was soft\r\nearth. There is a drawing of some of these footsteps in the picture on\r\nthe next page, and there are also the footprints of a large bird, and\r\nyou can see where he walked over the soft earth and made a long line of\r\nfootmarks; and if you look at the footprints of birds on the snow or\r\nmud now you will notice marks just like these. Then there is another\r\npicture of a single footprint of a large bird, and all those round dots\r\nare where rain-drops fell and left their marks in the soft earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IV.\r\n\r\n(1) _Footprints of Labyrinthodon._\r\n\r\n(3) _Footprints of Birds_, (2) _with marks of Rain-drops_.]\r\n\r\nI dare say you will wonder how it is that these footprints have not\r\ndisappeared. Well, when the animals and birds that made them had\r\ngone the marks became filled with dry sand, no doubt blown in by the\r\nwind, and then the mud dried hard, and at last it became covered with\r\nother earths and sank slowly down, just as the coal forests had done\r\nbefore, and remained there until we dug it up with these tracks of\r\nthe birds and animals that lived then. Some of these birds must have\r\nbeen larger than any living now, because their footmarks are so long.\r\nNone of their bones have been found yet, I believe, but plenty of the\r\nteeth and some bones of the labyrinthodon have. The real footmarks, of\r\ncourse, are very large, though they are small in the picture.[9]\r\n\r\nIn the great beds of Lias there are many other strange animals, and\r\namong them are two great fish-lizards called the _Ichthyosaurus_\r\nand _Plesiosaurus_. Both of these lived in the water and perhaps\r\ncame on land sometimes, and it is certain that they must have been\r\nvery ferocious creatures, from their great size and sharp teeth. The\r\nplesiosaurus would be able to raise his long neck above the water and\r\nsnap at some of those curious birds rather like bats which lived at the\r\ntime, and of which I shall have something to say presently. Some of\r\nthese fish-lizards were as large as whales, and their bodies have been\r\nso beautifully preserved in the limestone rocks that we can actually\r\nsometimes find in their stomachs the food they lived on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: V.\r\n\r\n_Ichthyosaurus._\r\n\r\n_Plesiosaurus._\r\n\r\nFISH-REPTILES.]\r\n\r\nNow we have got to a higher order of creation still, these\r\nfish-lizards, and they remind one of the next step in progress—birds.\r\nYou know that all birds lay eggs, so do almost all reptiles, such as\r\ncrocodiles, lizards, and most snakes, so that they are alike in this.\r\nThen the plesiosaurus with his long neck reminds us of such birds as\r\nthe heron and the swan, but he is altogether more like a reptile than\r\neither a fish or a bird. There were also huge land reptiles, which\r\nlived in the forests of the time, and must have been a terror to the\r\nsmaller animals. From the bones of one of these which have been found\r\nin the oolite clays near Weymouth in Dorsetshire (the _Cetiosaurus_),\r\nwe see that it must have been nearly as large as an elephant, and\r\nthere are others called the _Megalosaurus_, _Dinosaurus_, &c. All these\r\nnames end with _saurus_, a name taken from the Greek word meaning\r\nlizard; and you will see now why the oolite, or “Jurassic”[10] age,\r\nas it is sometimes called, is well named the “reptile age,” for these\r\ncreatures swarmed on the land and in the sea. Specimens of these you\r\ncan see for yourselves in the cases on the walls of the third room in\r\nthe North Gallery of the British Museum, where all the fossils are\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nBut still more extraordinary animals than any of these lived at the\r\ntime, and we can scarcely tell whether they were birds or reptiles, as\r\nthey were something like both, but I suppose we must call them flying\r\nreptiles, and they are the nearest approach to birds that had yet\r\nexisted. These creatures are called _Pterodactyles_, from two Greek\r\nwords which mean “wing-fingered.” Suppose the little fingers of both\r\nyour hands were a yard longer than the others, and suppose a thick\r\nleathery skin was stretched from the tips of your long little fingers\r\nto each of your feet, you would have wings something like a pterodactyl\r\nand also something like the wings of a bat. But the pterodactyl had a\r\nlong neck and a long beak-like mouth, full of long sharp pointed teeth.\r\nIt could not walk much I think, but it could hang itself up by its hind\r\nlimbs to a tree or rock, head downwards like a bat, and must have been\r\nable to fly very strongly, with its huge leathery wings, but it had no\r\nfeathers. There were swarms of these curious half lizard half bird-like\r\nanimals on the land, and they were of all sizes, some no bigger than a\r\ncrow, and some as large as the albatross, measuring twelve feet across\r\ntheir outstretched wings. Their skeletons are some of the commonest\r\nfossils in the oolite rocks, all through the great reptile age.[11]\r\n\r\nNow you see we have come to a reptile that can fly, but, excepting for\r\nits wings and some of its bones, more like a crocodile than a bird. A\r\nlittle further on we find another curious animal in the oolite rocks,\r\nwhich is much more like a true bird than the pterodactyl, because it\r\nhad feathered wings. It is called the _Archæopteryx_, which means\r\n“ancient wing,” and I have given a picture of it on the same page as\r\nthe pterodactyl, so that you may compare them together. The blade-bone\r\nand “merry-thought” of this creature were exactly like those of a bird,\r\nand so were the feet and legs, which would enable it to walk easily, or\r\nperch on the branch of a tree, but the tail was long and many-jointed\r\nlike that of a lizard, with a fan of feathers growing on each side\r\nof it, and short feathered wings. Then it most likely had teeth like\r\na lizard, and there were short claws at the bend of the wings. This\r\nbird-reptile was about the size of a crow, and was the first we know of\r\nwith feathers, and the limestone rock has preserved it most beautifully\r\nthrough all the long ages which have passed since it flitted over the\r\nland of the oolite period.[12] Later still than these, there lived in\r\nAmerica, about the time the chalk was formed in England, two strange\r\nbirds called _Hesperornis_ and _Ichthyornis_, both of which had teeth\r\nin the jaws. The former was an immense fellow like the penguin, with\r\nshort wings, and the latter was about the size of a pigeon with large\r\nfeathered wings.\r\n\r\nThey are finding more of these curious creatures every now and then in\r\nAmerica. Some are without teeth, and have a horny bill like that of a\r\nreal bird, and in other ways more nearly resemble living birds; still\r\nthey have not lost the appearance of reptiles in their principal bones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VI.\r\n\r\n_Pterodactyl_ (_Wing-finger_).\r\n\r\n_Archæopteryx_ (_Ancient-wing_).]\r\n\r\nI have been particular in describing some of these fish-lizards\r\nand bird-reptiles; because they, or their near relations, were the\r\nprincipal inhabitants of land and sea from the end of the coal period\r\nto the end of the chalk, though there were of course swarms of fishes\r\nand shell-fish; but I ought to tell you that even so early as this\r\nthere was at least one animal known which suckled its young ones, and\r\nthis was a small insect-eating creature not larger than a rat, of the\r\nsame family (called _Marsupial_) as the kangaroo of Australia, which\r\ncarries its young ones in a pocket or pouch in its skin.\r\n\r\nAll this time we have been hunting for parts of “the puzzle” in those\r\nancient oolite rocks between the coal and the chalk, and those we\r\nhave found are very important. We have seen the slow progress from\r\nsimple sea shells to simple fishes, and then onwards to fish-lizards\r\nand bird-reptiles with one little marsupial animal, of a far higher\r\nkind, in between, as if to tell us beforehand what more complete and\r\nperfect animals we might expect by-and-by. After the fishes we have\r\nfound fish-lizards, then bird-reptiles with wings, but no feathers, and\r\nlater still a bird-reptile with wing and tail feathers. How different\r\nthe life of the Earth was at the end of the “reptile age” of the oolite\r\nrocks, to the far back Laurentian time when one little creature, our\r\nold friend eozöon, alone held possession of the seas!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRETACEOUS PERIOD.\r\n\r\nNow let us look into the rocks next above, and see what is to be found\r\nthere. We have arrived in the Cretaceous period, or time when the\r\nchalk was formed.[13] You remember I told you you might call this\r\n“foraminifera earth” because so much of it was made up of the shells\r\nof these tiny animals, thousands of which could be put into a thimble.\r\nWhenever you make a mark with a piece of drawing chalk you rub off a\r\nnumber of them, and you will see what pretty little creatures they\r\nwere if you look at the drawings of some of them on the next page as\r\nthey are seen under the microscope, magnified thousands of times their\r\nnatural size; but there are others of different shapes. On the same\r\npage too there is a handsome shell, called an ammonite, and of its real\r\nsize, common in chalk rocks. The seas of the time must have been very\r\ndeep as I have explained before, and the chalk contains numbers of\r\nbones of fishes everywhere, and many of the remains of the reptile-like\r\ncreatures of the time before. Corals, sea-urchins, crabs, &c.,\r\nabounded, and as you can scarcely ever see chalk without immense flint\r\nstones in it, you may suppose what millions of sponges lived on the\r\nrocks, for these flints are partly made up of their fossil bodies.[14]\r\nAnother Cretaceous period is beginning now at the bottom of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific Oceans, where it is deep enough to cover the Alps,\r\nfor these little foraminifera are living on the surface in countless\r\nmillions, and day by day their fossil shells are settling down to the\r\nbottom and forming a soft grey mud, full of the carbonate of lime like\r\nchalk. The climate of the Cretaceous age was mild and pleasant, as we\r\nknow from the kind of animals in the seas. Slowly the water began to\r\nget shallower and shallower by the upheaval of the bed, and at last the\r\nbottom of this mighty chalk ocean came up to the light and sun, to be\r\ncovered in some places with the drift and worn particles of older rocks\r\nswept over it by rivers, and to receive new plants and new animals, and\r\nin some places to remain almost bare, as it is on the downs of Brighton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VII.\r\n\r\nFOSSILS OF THE CHALK.\r\n\r\n  1 _Ammonite._\r\n  2 3 4 _Foraminifera_ (_Chalk-builders_).]\r\n\r\nNow we take one more step upwards into almost a new world—the world on\r\nwhich mighty animals lived, and which man came to share with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TERTIARY PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe reign of the reptiles is now passed. The ichthyosaurus and\r\npterodactyl no longer inhabited the seas and continents. Great changes\r\nhad taken place in the shape of the land. A river larger than the Rhine\r\nswept majestically through England from the borders of Wales right out\r\ninto the German Ocean, and its banks were covered with forests and\r\nmarshes, where the new animals which had come to take possession of\r\nthe earth lived and moved and had their being. The mountains of the\r\nPyrenees were raised above the sea, and parts of Surrey and Sussex\r\nappeared too. It was most likely in the early part of the Tertiary\r\nperiod that the stone was formed of which almost all Paris is built.\r\nFancy a great city built of the shells of dead animals! One can\r\nscarcely believe it: but the microscope lets us into this secret of\r\nNature. If we take a piece of this stone and examine it in a powerful\r\nmicroscope we see that it is made almost entirely of tiny shells, so\r\nsmall that myriads of them could be packed in a nut-shell. How long\r\nmust they have been working to make all the stone beds of which Paris\r\nis built? We cannot measure the time, we can only know it must have\r\nbeen enormous!\r\n\r\nAll kinds of animals both of sea and land increased in numbers and\r\nperfection. The ammonites were dead, but their even more beautiful\r\nrelation, the nautilus, was living as it is now. The trilobite was\r\ngone, but his next relation, the lobster and crab, appeared. Fishes\r\nabounded. Whales which suckle their young ones appeared, and the\r\nnumbers of vertebrata, or animals with backbones, were more numerous\r\nthan they had ever been before. Just as animals with bones are more\r\nperfect than those with only skins or shells, so animals which suckle\r\ntheir young ones are more perfect than those which only lay eggs.\r\nThus the whale is a more perfect animal than the shark, though both\r\ninhabit the water; and elephants and even rats and mice more perfect\r\nstill; and because there were so many of these “sucklers,” or mammalia\r\nas they are called, in the Tertiary period, we know that all living\r\ncreatures were becoming more perfect. It will interest you too to learn\r\nthat monkeys began to appear now, and that they were common in France,\r\nwhile at the present time the only part of Europe where they are to be\r\nfound is on the rock of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nBut I want particularly to tell you of the giant animals—the Mammoth,\r\nMastodon, Megatherium, Dinotherium, and others, and first let us see\r\nwhat the mammoth was like.\r\n\r\nIn former times, when people accidentally found the bones of these\r\nanimals, they actually thought they had belonged to giant _men_, and\r\nwe can scarcely wonder at that: but we know better. If only one small\r\nbone is shown to Professor Owen or Professor Huxley, he can tell at\r\nonce whether it belonged to a man or an animal, a fish or a bird, and\r\nvery often the particular animal too. Well, the bones of the mammoth\r\nwere found in the north of Russia on the banks of the river Lena in\r\n1800: but the Russians knew of them before that, and the name they\r\ngave the animal means “earth,” because they supposed it burrowed in the\r\nearth like a mole. This one is now in the Museum at St. Petersburg, and\r\nits brownish coat and long black hairs, and even the hoofs and some of\r\nthe flesh, can be distinctly seen. The drawing in the frontispiece is\r\ntaken from it. It was strange that any people could have supposed that\r\nthis huge creature, larger than an elephant and with great curved tusks\r\nten feet long and weighing 160 lbs., could have got underground of its\r\nown accord: but that was the only way in which they could account for\r\nfinding it buried in the earth on the banks of the rivers. Look at\r\nthe picture in the frontispiece; what a splendid animal he was, this\r\nold elephant; larger and stronger than any living elephants! Immense\r\nquantities of their bones are found in Siberia, and the tusks and teeth\r\nare brought in ship-loads to England, where they are sold for their\r\nivory. Their skeletons have been found in most countries of Europe, in\r\nmany parts of Asia, and in North America, and these animals must have\r\nbeen common at one time near London, for their bones have been dug up\r\nin the brick earth at Ilford in Essex and other places near the Thames.\r\nThere is a skull with tusks set up with iron supports in the British\r\nMuseum.[15]\r\n\r\nThere was besides another animal very much like this called the\r\nMastodon; but it had tusks in the lower jaws as well as the upper,\r\nfour in all, and the lower tusks dropped out when the animal grew old.\r\nThe whole skeleton of one of these is also put up in the Museum, which\r\nyou ought to go and see.[16] Mastodons’ bones have been discovered in\r\nEngland and other parts of Europe, and in North and South America and\r\nIndia, so that they were spread pretty well all over the world. They\r\nhad very curious pointed teeth rather like a lot of fir cones piled\r\ntogether, not flat grinders like those of the mammoth and all living\r\nelephants, and perhaps they fed upon fruits and nuts, and boughs, as\r\nI do not think they could have managed well to chew grass and leaves\r\nwith such pointed teeth. The teeth in their old dead jaws are still\r\nbeautifully white and look like china. Both the mammoth and the\r\nmastodon had long trunks of course, and they must have been grand\r\nlooking creatures marching about in the English forests. We should be\r\nvery much startled if we were to meet one of them now in an English\r\nwood: but there is no chance of that, they have all passed away, and\r\nthe only relations they have living are the elephants of Africa and\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nDuring this Tertiary period, or at least the early part of it, besides\r\nthe mammoth and mastodon, the hippopotamus and rhinoceros were\r\nplentiful about the Thames. Those same Ilford marshes in Essex have\r\nbeen a complete storehouse of the remains of these animals. The bones\r\nof a hundred different mammoths and eighty rhinoceroses have been dug\r\nup lately from the damp, black soil, as well as many belonging to the\r\nhippopotamus, and we can have no doubt that all the swamps along the\r\nnorth side of the river were inhabited by large herds of these huge\r\nbeasts, or so many of their skeletons could not have been collected in\r\none place. It is very likely they were overtaken in a flood of the\r\nriver and drowned, and their bodies sank down in the mud of the river\r\nbank: but anyhow, there they are to tell us that they lived and died\r\nalmost within sight of the Tower of London, if it had been built then,\r\nas of course it was not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIII.\r\n\r\n_Gigantic Irish Stag_ (_Cervus Megaceros_).]\r\n\r\nLong long ago too, before there was a single brick where London stands,\r\nand when the few human beings who were living were obliged to hide\r\nthemselves in caves, great lions might have been heard roaring at night\r\nin the forests of the Thames Valley. The bones of this lion have been\r\nfound in many different parts of England, and a terrible fellow he\r\nmust have been, for some of his canine teeth (the long sharp teeth in\r\ncats and dogs) were more than six inches long. Indeed they were like\r\nsmall swords, and this is why he has been called the “sabre-toothed”\r\nlion. There were also bears, like the great grisly bear of America, and\r\nleopards, hyenas, and wolves, and besides two kinds of ox far larger\r\nthan those we have now. But one of the handsomest animals was the great\r\nIrish stag. When standing upright the top of his horns would be as\r\nhigh as two tall men. He was indeed a fine fellow with his immense\r\nspreading antlers. The deer in our parks would look dwarfs beside him.\r\nHe inhabited both England and Ireland: but, being found more often in\r\nIreland, he has got the name of the _Irish_ stag. As many as thirty of\r\nthe skeletons of these stags have been found together under a bog in\r\nIreland, and in some of the bones the marrow is still preserved, and\r\nthey burn well. Fences have been made of these bones in Ireland, and\r\nwhen the people of a small village in the county of Antrim heard of the\r\nbattle of Waterloo they made a great bonfire of the bones and horns\r\nof the Irish stag to rejoice over the victory. I dare say these stags\r\nwere hunted by wolves, and perhaps driven on to the ice of ancient\r\nlakes, where they broke through and got drowned, for so many of their\r\nskeletons are found together. I could not pass this magnificent stag by\r\nwithout giving you a picture of him.[17] He was a much nobler looking\r\nanimal than the reindeer, which lived along with him at the time in\r\nEngland, and from his appearance I should say he was a swift runner and\r\ngreat fighter. Some antlers have been found locked together, just as\r\nthese stags died in mortal combat, and I never see Sir Edwin Landseer’s\r\nbeautiful picture of two red-deer stags fighting without thinking what\r\na grand sight it would have been to see two of these great Irish stags\r\nrushing at each other with their powerful horns.\r\n\r\nNot one of those animals is living now, and none of them is mentioned\r\nin any history or tradition whatever, and though there is no doubt that\r\nmen living in Europe saw the mammoth alive (as you will find in the\r\nnext chapter), they knew of no kind of writing in which to tell us of\r\nthem; these fossils are the only records left, but they speak plainly\r\nenough of the time when England and the whole of Europe were inhabited\r\nby these races of huge animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IX.\r\n\r\n_The Megatherium._]\r\n\r\nNow I must carry you away to South America, where there are more\r\nwonders. If I were to tell you of all the singular monsters people\r\nhave found in the beds of the rivers there it would make a book of\r\nitself. You know what large rivers there are in that country, and how\r\nthey run for thousands of miles through almost flat plains called\r\n“Pampas.” Well, these rivers have often changed their beds by cutting\r\nnew channels in the soft soil. The old dry beds of the rivers are\r\nthe burying-places of some most curious animals, but I have not room\r\nto tell you about more than one of them at present. He is called the\r\n_Megatherium_, which means “great beast.” His size and strength were\r\nenormous. The largest hippopotamus looks small by his side. His leg\r\nbones are bigger than your body. He was more like the sloth than any\r\nother living animal, but he could not climb. He stood on those huge,\r\nbroad hind feet, with his strong tail as a sort of third leg, and tore\r\ndown the branches of the trees to feed on, or even rooted them up to\r\nget at the leaves. Standing by his skeleton in the British Museum[18]\r\none feels quite a shrimp, and he looks strong enough to walk away\r\ncomfortably with an elephant on his back.\r\n\r\nAnother immense animal inhabited South America at the time, which\r\ngeologists have called _Dinotherium_, or “dreadful beast.”[19] He was a\r\nrelation of the mastodon, but his tusks were very curious. Instead of\r\nbeing in the upper jaw and turned upwards they stuck out from the lower\r\njaw and curved downwards, giving him a very odd appearance. He most\r\nprobably had a trunk like the mammoth or mastodon, but perhaps not so\r\nlong. All these of course were vegetable feeders.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary period is so remarkable for the numbers of animals more\r\nor less related to elephants and spread all over the world, that we\r\nmight almost call it the “elephant age,” as the oolite has been named\r\nthe “reptile age.” These elephantine animals abounded in Europe, Asia,\r\nand North and South America, and though none of this kind have yet been\r\nfound in Australia and Africa, I cannot help thinking they will be\r\ndiscovered in Africa at all events, for there is no doubt that Africa\r\nand Europe were once joined.\r\n\r\nAustralia you know possesses that animal so unlike all others that when\r\nwe first see it we are quite astonished—the kangaroo. The bones of a\r\nhuge fossil kangaroo have been found in Australia which must have stood\r\nfourteen or fifteen feet high I should think when on its hind legs, or\r\nmore than twice as large as any living now.[20] Then there were giant\r\nbirds in New Zealand (something like the ostrich) called _dinornis_ or\r\n“dreadful bird.” These fellows had no wings, and they must have been\r\nvery much taller than the ostrich or emu. To look at their leg bones\r\nyou would think they were the bones of oxen instead of birds, they are\r\nso immensely thick and strong. I do not think any of these are living\r\nnow, because they have been sought for carefully, and none of the\r\nnatives even can say that they have seen one. But their skeletons are\r\ncommon in the surface earth, and their bones, cracked to get the marrow\r\nout of them, are often dug out of the heaps of refuse collected about\r\nancient cooking places. So that they were used for food, and perhaps\r\nthey have not been extinct—that is to say, died out—more than a few\r\nhundred years; and this is more likely because feathers are sometimes\r\nattached to the remains, and undecayed sinews on the feet. A human\r\nskeleton has been found in a grave in New Zealand, too, with the egg\r\nof one between its arms, and little piles of pebbles are often seen\r\namong their bones, where the stomach would be, which the bird swallowed\r\nto digest its food, just as many birds do now. The natives called\r\nit the Moa, and they have some traditions about it, and, all things\r\nconsidered, it is probably one of the most recent fossil animals, and\r\nthat is the reason why I have left it to the last.[21]\r\n\r\nNow I dare say you will wish to know when the animals living now took\r\nthe place of those I have described, and which have all passed away.\r\nThis cannot be told with certainty, but you will see in the “Human\r\nPart” that Men were living when the mammoth, mastodon, and some other\r\nextinct animals, inhabited the Earth, and that the reindeer, ox, bear,\r\nwolf, hyena, &c., have survived to the present day.\r\n\r\nThroughout these immense periods of time there are gaps which we cannot\r\nyet fill up. No one can yet say, for instance, when the last of the\r\nmammoths disappeared, and the first of their near relations, the Indian\r\nand African elephants, took their place. These are the missing parts\r\nof “the puzzle of life” which you may perhaps one of these days find\r\nwhen you come to study the subject, and when you have learned all that\r\nis known at present. But you may be sure of this, that throughout all\r\ntime there has been _progress_, the lower forms of animal life have\r\nbeen followed by more perfect forms as the Earth grew older. It is true\r\nthe lower forms of life have not all died out. These imperfect animals\r\nhave run through all the ages—the chalk builder of the Cretaceous age\r\nlives in the ocean now—and there are many other simple animals which\r\nlived in Old Red Sandstone times, and are not extinct yet, but wherever\r\na superior kind of animal has passed away another more perfect has\r\ntaken its place. This will be seen at once if we compare the “Reptile\r\nAge” with the Tertiary. The great ichthyosaurus, plesiosaurus, and\r\npterodactyl are gone, but now we have the more perfect crocodiles\r\nand birds. The mammoth is gone, but we have the elephant. There are\r\nno giant mosses or towering tree ferns, but our forest trees are more\r\nperfect and more varied. The plants which formed the coal forests and\r\nonce clothed the Earth with beauty have dwindled away to the lowly\r\nforms which we must stoop to examine in swamps, and these humble plants\r\nare all the surviving relatives of their once noble family. The lordly\r\noaks and elms, stronger, and even more lovely in the sweet drapery of\r\ntheir foliage, and much better fitted for our use, have succeeded all\r\nthose soft-stemmed plants which grew so fast and were the best possible\r\nkind for forming coal.\r\n\r\nWhen you are able to study what is called comparative anatomy you will\r\nsee how wonderful the _plan_ of creation is, and how beautifully it\r\nhas been worked out by its great Designer. You will see in the bones\r\nof the reptiles of the oolite rocks a prophecy as it were of the birds\r\nand animals which were to come. What could be more prophetic of animals\r\nwith the power of perfect flight than the leather-winged pterodactyl,\r\nhalf lizard and half bird? In some of these animals you will see bones\r\nonly half formed, and useless to that creature, which were brought to\r\nperfection in later times, and became the most important part of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult for me to make all this plain to you, but if you\r\nare really interested in it you will go to a museum where the fossils\r\nare collected, and then I am very much mistaken if you do not find a\r\nnew and strange world opened to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Numerous specimens in Case No. 7, Room V.\r\n\r\n[8] Specimens of fossil fishes from various rocks in Wall-case No. 1,\r\nRoom II.\r\n\r\n[9] See examples in the large Wall-cases in Rooms I., II., and III.,\r\nNorth Gallery.\r\n\r\n[10] So called because the mountain chain of the Jura Alps was raised\r\nduring this period.\r\n\r\n[11] Several specimens in Room III., and in Table-case No. 16, Room IV.\r\n\r\n[12] Wall-case No. 11 in Room III., several specimens, imperfect.\r\n\r\n[13] From the Latin word “creta,” meaning chalk.\r\n\r\n[14] Ammonites in the Table-cases in Rooms V. and VI.

He could gather the fruits of the Earth like them, and\r\nperhaps used some of the smaller creatures as food, but he could do\r\nlittle more. He scarcely knew that he possessed the faculties which\r\nwould in time make him lord of the Earth and the creatures inhabiting\r\nit. By slow and painful experience he was to gather those stores of\r\nknowledge that were to enable him to overcome difficulties, to provide\r\nhim with shelter from the weather and protection from dangerous\r\nanimals, give increasing comfort and power, and set him so far above\r\nall other created things. He found plants and animals for his use, and\r\nthe dwellings in caves and holes ready made by Nature. He could neither\r\nbuild houses nor make weapons. The first weapon he ever used probably\r\nwas a stone, which he could throw at small animals. Then he would find\r\nout that long, sharp-pointed sticks could be thrown like spears, and\r\nhe also found that a long pliant piece of wood when bent would fly\r\nback, and in this he would see a means of throwing smaller pointed\r\nsticks like arrows, and I dare say the discovery of the way of making\r\na bow with a string of twisted animal skin was a great invention, and\r\nit certainly would be a very valuable one. Many generations must have\r\npassed away before he got even as far as this. It is very easy for us,\r\nwho see bows and arrows from our childhood, to understand their use at\r\nonce: but the first human inhabitants of the world had to find them out\r\nfor themselves. They began with _no_ knowledge at all. The beasts of\r\nthe field and the fruits of the Earth were given them, but they could\r\nMAKE nothing. They had not even the natural covering of hair, or wool,\r\nor feathers, which animals and birds have, and they must first have\r\nclothed themselves with skins of these. The wants of their daily life\r\nwere so great that they had no time to think of anything else, but\r\nwhen it became easier to satisfy these bodily wants their minds turned\r\nto other things. They must have seen that when the seeds and fruits\r\nof plants fall upon the ground they grow and produce the same kind of\r\nplant, but they did not at first think of gathering a great number of\r\nthese seeds and sowing them in one place and making a garden. They\r\ncould wander about and gather all they needed as they became ripe, for\r\nthere were few people then. Their life was like that of the lilies of\r\nthe field, they “toiled not neither did they spin,” as Christ says of\r\nthe flowers, but when they began to increase in number something more\r\nwas wanted. People began to feel something within them which we call\r\n“intellect,” and this must be satisfied. It was not enough to live as\r\nif they were no nobler than the animals. Something stirred in their\r\nminds which told them they must not stand still.\r\n\r\nThe Creator has made both us and the wood and stone and metals, and\r\nhas given to us the power to make other things out of them. Thus we\r\nare nearer to Him in power than any of the animals who cannot change\r\nthe rough materials into other forms. We admire the simple and really\r\nbeautiful nest of the bird, but we feel that our power is greater\r\nwhen we consider our splendid buildings and steam-engines, our ships,\r\nand our many conquests over difficulties. But if we did not use these\r\ngreater powers of mind and hand well, we should find them grow weaker\r\nand weaker until we might almost lose them.\r\n\r\nYou may easily suppose that there was a time when men could not write,\r\nand there were no books of any kind, nor any other means of exchanging\r\nthoughts except through spoken language. The earliest histories about\r\nthe human race always speak of men who lived before those histories\r\nwere written. We have nothing about the earliest men written by\r\n_themselves_. It is always someone else who writes of them, referring\r\nto their deeds, and to events which happened long before.\r\n\r\nThe art of writing has grown up gradually and very slowly, for when the\r\ninhabitants of the Earth became numerous they felt the need of some\r\nway of expressing themselves to those at a distance from them, and for\r\nmaking a record of things that happened and might be forgotten. Some\r\nof the earliest means of writing were by pictures, like the picture\r\nwritings of Mexico[22] found by the Spanish conquerors, and something\r\nof the same kind is even now used by the Chinese and Japanese. Their\r\nwriting is made up partly of pictures and partly of queer signs which\r\nstand for the names of things, as you know if you have ever seen\r\none of their books. One of the oldest forms of writing known is the\r\nhieroglyphic, which is said to have been first used by the Egyptians\r\nabout 2,100 years before Christ, and another is the arrow-shaped\r\nwriting of the Assyrians. These were cut on stone and metal tablets,\r\nand most of them are the histories of their kings. But there are some\r\nwritings on stone in India which are thought to be older still. The\r\nEgyptians made great progress in writing afterwards when _papyrus_\r\nwas invented.[23] This is a kind of paper made from a reed which grows\r\nabundantly in the river Nile, and many of these papyrus writings are\r\npreserved in the British Museum, as well as the writings on stone of\r\nthe Egyptians and Assyrians, and learned men have spelled out a great\r\ndeal of the history of these nations from them, though the language is\r\nquite different from any spoken or written now.\r\n\r\nPicture writing was most likely one of the earliest inventions in this\r\nway: but it was so troublesome that signs were used to express the same\r\nthings as the picture. For instance, suppose a history of a king was to\r\nbe written. The word “king” would be shown by something he always wore,\r\nsuch as his crown, and this sign would become more simple until at last\r\nit might not be anything like a crown; but it would be remembered that\r\nthe sign stood for a king all the same. The first letter of the Hebrew\r\nalphabet, _aleph_, means an ox, and the letter is something like the\r\nshape of the head of that animal with its horns; and another letter,\r\ncalled _shin_, which in Hebrew means a tooth, is actually very like a\r\ntooth with three points. In many languages these signs have become so\r\naltered that they do not now resemble the things they at first stood\r\nfor; but the first steps in the invention of written language were\r\ncertainly made by signs representing the thing of which the person\r\nwished to give an idea. But you will learn all about these ancient\r\nwritings from other books.\r\n\r\nThe men whose lives I am going to describe lived long before any of\r\nthese writings were invented. They _spoke_ a language of course, though\r\nthere is nothing left to show that they knew of any kind of writing,\r\nand they are called Pre-historic men because they lived before there\r\nwere any histories either written by themselves or about them. But they\r\ncould draw a little, as we know from the pictures of animals, birds,\r\nand fishes scratched upon pieces of slate, and bone, and stone found in\r\ntheir graves. Perhaps these pictures were memorials of their great or\r\nwise men, or showed that they were clever hunters, or fishermen.\r\n\r\nThey knew the use of fire. Half burnt bones and wood and ashes are\r\nplentiful in the caves where they lived. They had none of the means we\r\npossess for kindling fire, and there are only two ways by which they\r\ncould have got it. They might have rubbed two pieces of very dry wood\r\ntogether until the heat lighted them, as many savages do at the present\r\ntime; or they might have struck sparks from flint upon rotten wood and\r\nblown the spark into a flame. We may be sure that when once a fire was\r\nlighted they would take care it did not go out, and if they wanted to\r\ntravel they would carry with them a piece of smouldering wood to light\r\nthe fire again. I do not suppose that these pre-historic men were any\r\nmore civilized than the savages of Australia and other countries, and\r\nI have often thought when looking at these savages that they live in\r\nalmost exactly the same way as the earliest inhabitants of Europe did.\r\nThey have the same shaped weapons and tools made of stone, and these\r\nare fixed to the handles in the same way. They have the same kinds of\r\nneedles and fish-hooks made of bone, and they sew skins together with\r\nthreads made from the sinews of animals. Thus we see men living now\r\nin many parts of the world who are quite as uncivilized as the old\r\ninhabitants of Europe, who lived perhaps thousands of years before the\r\nEgyptians and Assyrians.\r\n\r\nThese very ancient men knew nothing about metals. All their tools were\r\nmade of flint, or bone, or stone, and they were of the rough shape you\r\nsee in the pictures on the next page, and it is for this reason that\r\nthis has been called the _Stone Age_. These were chipped out with great\r\ntrouble and labour, and most of them were not even polished. With these\r\nthey had to kill animals for food, to cut down trees, and fight against\r\ntheir enemies. The skeleton of a mastodon was found in the state of\r\nMissouri in America about thirty-five years ago with numbers of these\r\nflint arrow-heads underneath and near it. Perhaps it had been shot at\r\nwith arrows, and when it died the flint points fell out of its decaying\r\nflesh. But it is not likely that these pre-historic men could have\r\nkilled many such large animals, unless they caught them in pits covered\r\nover with branches of trees and earth, into which they might fall,\r\nas elephants are sometimes caught in Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: X.\r\n\r\n  1. _Flint Arrow-head._\r\n  2. _Stone Axe in handle._\r\n  3. _Flint Knife._\r\n  4. _Bone Harpoon._\r\n  5. _Bone Needles._\r\n  6. _Sceptre made of Horn._\r\n  7. _Marrow Spoon._]\r\n\r\nNothing shows us so well the immense time which must have passed since\r\nthe men of the stone age lived as that these flint weapons and tools\r\nare found nearly all over the world, in Northern Europe, including\r\nour own country, in Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Palestine, Africa,\r\nJapan, America, &c.; and yet none of the present inhabitants of these\r\ncountries have any history or tradition of the time when they were\r\nused. Metals are now used instead, and there is no record of the time\r\nwhen flint only was known. We are quite certain however that the stone\r\nage men lived at the same period as the great animals of the Tertiary\r\nage, the mammoth, the mastodon, the woolly rhinoceros, the Irish stag,\r\nthe cave bear, and others you have read of in former chapters, because\r\nflint and stone weapons are found in the same beds of earth with these\r\nanimals.[24]\r\n\r\nSuppose one of the present Indian or African elephants with his rider\r\nwere to fall into a river and they were to sink to the bottom and be\r\ncovered with mud, and suppose his rider had in his pocket some of our\r\nsovereigns. If that elephant should be accidentally dug up thousands of\r\nyears to come, when most likely all elephants will have died off the\r\nearth, people would know for certain, from the date and figure of the\r\nQueen on the money, that elephants were used by the English in this\r\nreign, even if all our books and monuments had perished, and a new\r\npeople inhabited the Earth. Something of the same kind has happened to\r\nprove to us that the stone-age men saw the mammoth alive. In one of\r\ntheir graves there is a slice of a mammoth’s great back tooth with a\r\nbeautiful picture of the animal, with his bristly hair, scratched on\r\nthe ivory, and there are also many of the flint and stone weapons which\r\nshow that the skeleton in the grave was that of a primeval man. This\r\nlittle picture tells its tale more faithfully than any history. It is\r\nall the more certain to tell it truly because it was never _meant_ to\r\ntell one. When that man was buried with this sign that he was a mighty\r\nhunter of the mammoth, or an artist, no one could imagine that he would\r\never be dug up to show us, who come so long afterwards, that he saw the\r\nmammoth roaming through the forests of the far away past. There can be\r\nno doubt that it is a very good drawing of the mammoth with its long\r\nturned-up tusks, like those in the picture at the beginning of the book.\r\n\r\nIn another place a picture of a fight between some reindeer scratched\r\nupon a piece of slate has been found. This was in a cave in France,\r\nand it, as well as the numbers of bones of these animals in the caves,\r\nshows that the reindeer, which now only inhabits the Arctic regions,\r\nmust have been common then in France. You will see drawings of both\r\nthese on page 135.\r\n\r\nThese primeval people built no houses. They lived in natural caves, and\r\nscattered the remains of their food about the floor, so that we know\r\nwhat they ate. Among the animals they used for food were the horse,\r\nthe reindeer, the ox, the cave-lion and bear, the wolf, the hyena, the\r\ngoat, the hare and several others, besides salmon and other fish. They\r\nwere very fond of the marrow of the bones, which they cracked with\r\nstone hammers, and had little spoons made of bone with which to pick it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThey had places for making flint weapons too. At Cissbury Camp, near\r\nWorthing, there is one of their old workshops. There are galleries dug\r\ninto the chalk where they got the flints, and there are thousands of\r\nchips of flint lying about, with half finished arrow-heads, and some\r\nof the tools they dug with. They had no spades or pickaxes; but they\r\nused the broad, flat, shoulder-blade bone of the ox as a spade, and the\r\nsharp brow antler of a deer’s horn for a pickaxe, to get these flints\r\nout with. It must have been very hard work for them, because bone\r\nspades and horn pickaxes would soon wear out, and would not be nearly\r\nso useful as ours made of iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XI.\r\n\r\n_Picture of Mammoth Scratched on Ivory._\r\n\r\n_Fight between Reindeer Scratched on Slate._]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to be certain how these stone-age people cooked their\r\nfood. Of course they could have roasted it, and the half-burnt bones in\r\nsome caves show that they did so; but in some caves in France there is\r\nnot a single burnt bone to be found. In these French cave dwellings,\r\ntoo, there are no pieces of earthenware, as there are in some\r\nothers; so that the people could not have boiled it, unless they had\r\nwooden pots and dropped red-hot stones into the water in them until the\r\nmeat got boiled, as some savages do now. Or they might have cooked it\r\nunder the hot ashes.\r\n\r\nThe people who used earthenware must have made more progress. It is\r\neasy to understand how they made this useful discovery. Suppose they\r\nhad lighted a fire upon a damp clay soil, the earth would get baked\r\nhard and crack off in pieces, and they would see that this soil could\r\nbe worked in the hands while soft into the shape of pans and dishes,\r\nwhich could be dried quite hard in the sun or baked in hot ashes, just\r\nas boys make clay marbles now. They could live much more comfortably\r\neven with these rough earthenware things, and cook their food more\r\nconveniently; but they still used the stone and flint tools and\r\nweapons, and iron was still unknown to them.\r\n\r\nThe people of whom I have been speaking are principally the men of the\r\nFirst Stone Age, when the art of polishing tools and weapons had not\r\nbeen found out. They simply chipped these things out of the flints and\r\nleft them very rough; but the men of the next, or Second Stone Age,\r\nmade great improvements. They ground their flint knives and axes with\r\nother stones, and rubbed them down to sharp edges and points, so that\r\nthey must have been much more useful for killing and cutting up the\r\nanimals they hunted. All their bone and horn tools are much better\r\nmade, and sometimes ornamented prettily with marks cut upon them. The\r\nSecond Stone Age men evidently wore clothing, most probably made of the\r\nskins of animals—for the long strips of bone with a hole at one end\r\nwhich you see in the picture could not have been used for any other\r\npurpose, except to draw threads through something. The threads were\r\nvery likely either the sinews of animals pulled out of the flesh, or\r\nthin strips of their skins, or perhaps the inner bark of a tree twisted\r\ninto a kind of string. In the colder parts of Europe and America these\r\nancient people would need some protection from the weather. How then\r\ndid the people of the First Stone Age manage, if they had no bone\r\nneedles, as I think they had not, with which to make clothing? They\r\nmust have wrapped themselves in the skins just as they came from the\r\nbacks of the animals.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to be always sure, when we find a cave and all these\r\nrelics of pre-historic man, whether the inhabitants belonged to the\r\nFirst or the Second Stone Age. Sometimes there are signs of polishing\r\nand grinding on the tools, and then we may suppose that men were\r\ngradually getting more skilful, until they finished off all their\r\nweapons beautifully. But there is such a very great difference in the\r\nperfection of these useful articles found in some places and those\r\nfound in others that we have no doubt men made slow progress, from the\r\nrough or First Stone Age, to the polished or Second Stone Age.\r\n\r\nIn neither the first nor second stone period had men yet learned to\r\nbuild any kind of habitations. They lived in caves simply, like wild\r\nanimals. On the banks of the river Vezère in France, which has cut\r\nits way deeply through the rock, there are some celebrated caves once\r\ninhabited by pre-historic men, and some of them are very large.\r\nThey were most likely hollowed out in the cliff by water, and many\r\ngenerations of men lived here. In one of them four human skeletons were\r\nfound, with plenty of stone and flint tools, besides the bones of the\r\nmammoth and lion, reindeer and other animals. The mammoth then as well\r\nas the reindeer lived at that time in the valley of the Vezère. There\r\nis no doubt that these caves were inhabited at separate times by people\r\nwho used only the roughest and simplest stone tools, and by others\r\nwho had made some progress and could polish their tools and make them\r\nof bone and could scratch pictures of animals upon slips of bone and\r\nslate. It is curious that all these drawings are side-view drawings,\r\nand they are only outlines, just like the drawings of children now,\r\nand the Esquimaux of the Arctic regions; because these people,\r\nalthough they were grown up, had not discovered the art of drawing in\r\nperspective and shading the figures. Still the pictures are wonderfully\r\ntrue to nature, and must have been copied from living animals. There is\r\nno earthenware in any of these caves, so that the useful art of making\r\npottery had not been discovered, neither is there any in the caves in\r\nSwitzerland, where the bones of the mammoth, lion, and rhinoceros are\r\nalso found, and the tools and weapons are much the same as those in the\r\nFrench caverns. It is impossible to say whether the cave-dwellers of\r\nFrance and Switzerland lived at the same time exactly, but they were in\r\nabout the same condition of civilization, and they must both have been\r\nquite familiar with the appearance of the mammoth and lion, and other\r\nanimals, which are not mentioned in any history, however old it may be,\r\nas inhabitants of these countries.\r\n\r\nA discovery has lately been made in France of a large cavern near\r\nBelfort, in the limestone rock, which has been covered up for ages. The\r\nquarrymen while cutting out the stone came upon a small opening leading\r\ninto a very large cave, in which there was a great quantity of human\r\nskeletons and bones and some beautifully ornamented vases, polished\r\nstone bracelets, and a mat of plaited rushes. To these people, then,\r\nthe arts of pottery and weaving were known, and this was probably one\r\nof their burying-places. They were evidently much more civilized than\r\nthe ancient people of the valley of the Vezère; but this cave must also\r\nbe of a great age, and its inhabitants have left no record of their\r\nhistory in any kind of writing.\r\n\r\nQuite lately, too, we have learned something of the early races of man\r\nin Colorado. Many of the caves in that country have been altered and\r\nmade more like regular houses, and some appear even to have been cut\r\nout of the rock entirely by human hands; and in the plains there are\r\nruins of large cities.\r\n\r\nThough still in the stone age, for all the weapons yet found among\r\nthese ruins are of stone, the Colorado people were more civilized than\r\nthe stone-age people of the Vezère caverns, because they had begun\r\nto build and knew how to make pottery. It is strange, too, that the\r\npresent natives of Colorado are not so civilized as the early people,\r\nand if they have descended from them they have not improved, but rather\r\nthe contrary. There are other caverns in various parts of the world\r\ncontaining these curious relics of races long since passed away, but\r\nsome of the principal have been mentioned, enough perhaps to interest\r\nyou and show you that men were living in Europe together with the large\r\nanimals of the Tertiary period, and that they had made very little\r\nprogress in the arts and manufactures, and had not even begun to build\r\nthe roughest houses.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the world even now there are savages nearly as\r\nuncivilized as the cave-dwellers of Europe were then. When Captain\r\nCook visited New Zealand, more than a hundred years ago, the natives\r\nthere had nothing but stone and bone tools, very like those found in\r\nthe European caverns, and the inhabitants of some of the islands in the\r\nPacific Ocean still use stone axes and hammers and bone needles.[25]\r\nCaptain Moresby, too, who made a voyage to the south-east coast of New\r\nGuinea a few years ago, tells us that the natives have beautiful stone\r\naxes, but they were so ignorant of the use of iron that they refused\r\nto give him one of their stone axes for a new iron hatchet which he\r\noffered them. No doubt the stone weapon cost a great deal of labour and\r\npatience to make, and perhaps the iron one was made by machinery in a\r\nfew minutes, and was really more useful, but the native had proved his\r\nown axe and knew nothing of the iron one, so that it is no wonder that\r\nhe refused it. But what a history these two axes tell—the stone and the\r\niron! The stone shows us man in his childhood, and the iron man in his\r\nmanhood, and what an immensely long time there is between the two. How\r\nmuch thought, and trial and failure, and patience and industry, were\r\nspent by mankind before the stone axe grew into the iron!\r\n\r\nIn Europe man has long since grown out of his childhood, but in many\r\nparts of the world he is no more civilized than the men who saw the\r\nmammoth crashing through the forests of England and France, and heard\r\nthe lion roar at night on the banks of the Thames, and watched the\r\nhippopotamus swimming across the river at Westminster. It is most\r\nlikely, then, that Europe and parts of Asia and America were inhabited\r\nlong before those places where men are even now in the stone age—such\r\nas the islands in the Pacific Ocean, New Guinea, Australia, &c.\r\n\r\nWhat a life the pre-historic men of Europe must have lived! Here\r\nthey were surrounded by huge dangerous animals, and had no means of\r\nprotecting themselves against them but with these rough stone weapons.\r\nWhere London now stands with its miles of streets and busy life there\r\nwas a mighty forest, and the mammoth and rhinoceros tramped through\r\nit by day, and the lion and hyena hunted the deer at night. When the\r\npre-historic men came down to the banks of the Thames in the day-time\r\nto spear salmon, they saw the hippopotamus plunging about in the water\r\namong the rushes, sweeping the long grass into their wide mouths, and\r\nswimming from side to side with their young ones perched upon their\r\nnecks. It must have been a grand sight, but a fearful one too, and it\r\nis no wonder that men thought the caves the only safe places to live in.\r\n\r\nSometimes in India the elephants come into the villages at night and\r\nthrow down wooden houses and kill people, and they are very much\r\nfeared, so that we can suppose how much more terrible the mammoth might\r\nhave been to the uncivilized cave-dwellers. If they shot at him with\r\nthe flint-pointed arrows they could scarcely hurt him, and it is more\r\nlikely that they got out of his way as quickly as possible whenever\r\nthey met him, and took good care never to interfere with the lion and\r\nrhinoceros.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAKE-DWELLERS.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest inhabitants of Europe, there were some who did not\r\nlive in caves; but I think they must have lived a long time after the\r\ncave-dwellers, when they built their houses out in the middle of the\r\nlakes. These houses were built in a very curious way, and the remains\r\nof them have been discovered in Ireland and Scotland, Switzerland and\r\nother countries. The people carried quantities of stones, and earth,\r\nand sticks out into the lake and let them sink to the bottom. Then\r\nwhen they had piled up enough to make an island, they laid wood across\r\nand set up their huts, and lived there surrounded by water. These were\r\nvery poor houses of course; but when men had begun to build for\r\nthemselves, they would find how much more comfortable they were than in\r\ndamp and dark caves. They must have had some kind of boats or canoes,\r\nor they could not have passed between their lake-dwellings and the land\r\nunless they swam to them; but I do not think that any of these boats\r\nhave been found. Perhaps they were made of the dried skins of animals\r\nstretched over wooden frames, as I have seen savages make boats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XII.\r\n\r\n_Lake-Dwellings._]\r\n\r\nThere was another way of building these lake-dwellings, and a better\r\nway too. Long poles were driven into the earth at the bottom of the\r\nwater, and when the builders had got enough of these together they\r\nlaid other poles across them, and built their huts on this floor above\r\nthe water. People are living now in much the same way near the Orinoco\r\nriver in South America, in New Guinea, and in Central Africa.[26]\r\nThe land all round is covered with water from the overflowing of the\r\nrivers, which are very large, and the huts are built up on these poles\r\nout of the way of it. The lake-dwellers of Europe would thus be safer\r\nin their houses from dangerous animals than if they were on land. They\r\nwere more civilized than the cave-dwellers, but still a great many of\r\ntheir tools and weapons were of stone and bone; yet we know that they\r\nhad made wonderful progress, because they had learned to make pottery,\r\nand even to weave cloths out of hemp or flax. They had most likely\r\nbegun to plant and cultivate the land, too, for corn is found about\r\nthese dwellings, and the bones of domestic animals are very numerous.\r\nThey had left the cave-dwellers a long way behind in many things, in\r\nwearing artificial clothing, in cultivating the land, and in keeping\r\ndomestic animals; but their implements—that is, their weapons and\r\ntools—were not much improved, and were very much like those of the\r\ncave-dwellers, though better finished and more polished than some of\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nBut not all the articles used by the lake people were of stone and\r\nbone. Some of those who lived in the Swiss lakes had ornaments, such\r\nas bracelets and hair-pins, made of the metal called bronze, and no\r\ndoubt they made spear-heads of the metal, because they would look to\r\nusefulness before ornament.\r\n\r\nNow you see how these people seem to have lived: first the old stone\r\nage men, then those of the newer or polished stone age, and lastly\r\nthe lake-dwellers. The people of both the first and second stone ages\r\ncertainly saw the mammoth, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, lion, and reindeer\r\nalive in France, Switzerland, and England; but when the lake-dwellings\r\nwere built, all these animals, except perhaps the reindeer, had died,\r\nand most of the animals were the same as they are now. None of these\r\npeople have left us any kind of history whatever, except that which\r\ntheir simple works tell us, their flint and bone weapons, and their\r\ndwellings. They have set up no gigantic monuments like the Egyptians or\r\nthe Druids. They thought of no men to come after them who would take an\r\ninterest in their ways; but it is fortunate that what they did make was\r\nof such lasting materials as stone and flint, or we should have known\r\nnext to nothing about their lives.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say how many thousands of years may have passed\r\nbefore the rough stone weapons were replaced by the polished stone, or\r\nthe cave was exchanged for an artificial house in a lake; but you must\r\nfeel in your minds that the time was immense, and the more we study the\r\nways and works of pre-historic man, the more certain we become that it\r\nis longer than the whole time that has passed since men first began to\r\nuse any kind of writing.\r\n\r\n\r\nKITCHEN-MIDDENS.\r\n\r\nI dare say you have seen untidy people in country places, and even in\r\ntowns, throw oyster-shells and broken dishes and dirt outside their\r\ndoors until quite a heap is formed. This is called a “midden,” and the\r\nhabit of doing this is a very old one. We learn just a little more of\r\nthe history of man from great middens made by ancient people in several\r\ncountries. They were first discovered in Denmark, and since then\r\nthey have been found in Scotland, Brazil, and New Zealand. They are\r\nsometimes very large, and must have been used by the whole village as\r\nplaces to throw the refuse of their cookery in. When these heaps have\r\nbeen dug into all sorts of things have been found in them—the shells\r\nof oysters and mussels, bones of fishes, birds, and animals, pieces\r\nof broken earthenware, little ornaments, stone axes, arrow-heads, wood\r\nashes, burnt bones, and other odds and ends. In Brazil many of these\r\nkitchen-middens are on the sea shore, and it seems as if the people\r\nwho made them came there to live on the shell-fish, for the shells\r\nare the same as those living in the sea close by now. In New Zealand\r\nthe middens contain many of the bones of the Moa, which was described\r\nin “The Animal Part,” and has now perished, and these are cracked in\r\nsuch a manner that the people evidently wanted to get at the marrow\r\nin them, and it shows too that this gigantic bird was common in New\r\nZealand then. The midden makers seemed to have lived in the open air,\r\nand wherever food was most plentiful. Perhaps they built huts of the\r\nbark and small branches of trees like the Australian savages, but such\r\nhouses would not last. We only know of the life of the midden makers\r\nfrom these heaps. Their weapons are of the same kind and pattern as\r\nthose of the Second Stone Age, but they had learned to make rough\r\nearthenware dishes and basins, and some pieces of a woven material\r\nhave been found, and pieces of wood and bone worked with a little\r\nskill. Whether they lived after or before the lake-dwellers I cannot\r\nsay, but I should think about the same time.\r\n\r\nThese pre-historic people, nevertheless, were not always thinking of\r\nmaking things which were useful. They thought too of making ornaments,\r\nmany of which are found in their dwellings and graves. Like ourselves,\r\nthey had an idea that little trinkets improved their appearance. In\r\none grave a skeleton was found with a small pile of shells under its\r\nneck, which no doubt had been strung together as a necklace, and when\r\nthe string rotted the shells parted and fell in a heap under the head,\r\nto be a memorial of that ancient man or woman’s possession of the same\r\nfeelings as our own. Various little articles, too, found about the\r\nlake-dwellings show that people liked to decorate themselves.\r\n\r\nWe shall never know what language they spoke, but they must have been\r\nable to tell their thoughts to one another. It was most likely a simple\r\nlanguage with few words as names for things and a simple grammar, like\r\nthe language of savages, because they had not so many things to talk\r\nabout as we have. The names of animals would perhaps be imitated from\r\ntheir cries and the noises they made. These cries would be among the\r\nmost familiar sounds to them, and when they wished to speak of some\r\nanimal the simplest way would be to imitate the noise it generally\r\nmakes. If we think of our own language, we shall see how very likely\r\nthis was. We have many such words. We teach our children the names of\r\nanimals by the sounds they make. The dog we call “bow-wow,” the cow\r\n“moo-moo,” the duck “quack-quack,” and many other names of the same\r\nkind which you will think of yourselves. At the present time even the\r\nname by which the Egyptians call the donkey has almost exactly the\r\nsame sound as our “hee-haw.” This trick of doubling or repeating the\r\nsound, too, is very common among savages, who are as far behind us as\r\nthe pre-historic men were. The natives of Australia give these double\r\nnames to a great many animals and things, and sometimes do the same\r\nwith English words. They call fish “ningy-ningy,” and a certain tree\r\nthe “bunya-bunya,” and their language is full of such words. But it is\r\nnot only the names of things which have been made in this way. Verbs as\r\nwell as nouns have grown up thus. When we whisper to one another, that\r\nword imitates the low sound we make.\r\n\r\nI shall leave you to trace the natural origin of the following words,\r\nand think how much of man’s spoken language is taken from common\r\nsounds. Thus we have roar, shriek, whistle, hiss, sigh, sing, ring,\r\nthump, bump, clash, clang, bang, twang, clap, smack, slap, smash,\r\nswish, swirl, gong, thong, boom, bellow, batter, chatter, clatter,\r\nsnap, snip, whip, gurgle, shiver, quiver, rumble, roll, rattle,\r\nprattle, and a hundred more. Words thus derived from familiar sounds\r\nabound in all languages, and they, no doubt, are the easy steps by\r\nwhich men climbed to a more complicated speech. The earliest men must\r\nhave been obliged to pay great attention to animals and birds, which\r\nhave voices of their own; for to hunt and catch them was the principal\r\noccupation of their lives; therefore, when speaking of them to one\r\nanother, they would naturally call them by names resembling the sounds\r\nthey made. Our verbs “to squeak” and “to squeal” are certainly taken\r\nfrom the cries of animals when in pain; but I have said enough to show\r\nyou how language grew up among pre-historic people.\r\n\r\nWe do not know for certain that they had any musical instruments, but\r\nthey would hear the sighing of the wind among the trees, and it would\r\nalmost certainly be found out that blowing down a hollow stick or reed,\r\nopen at one end and closed at the other, would make a whistle; but if\r\nthey used any of these things they would not last like the stone tools,\r\nand have decayed away; and we do know that they had begun to draw upon\r\nsuch imperishable materials as bone and slate.\r\n\r\nThere is a very interesting specimen of a human fossil in the British\r\nMuseum, which you ought to go and see, if you can; but in case you are\r\nnot able there is a drawing of it on page 159.[27] This specimen was\r\nbrought to England about the year 1814. Others like it have since been\r\nfound imbedded in the hard breccia limestone rock at the same place on\r\nthe shore of the island of Guadaloupe. The skeleton most likely was\r\nthat of a woman, from the shape of some of the bones, and most probably\r\nwas of the race of Caribs, of whom there are none living now. Perhaps\r\nthis was originally a burying place of the ancient inhabitants of the\r\nisland, and when the sea washed the small broken pieces of shells and\r\ncorals over it (all of which contain lime) they hardened into breccia\r\nrock, and the skeleton became completely imbedded in it. This must\r\nhave taken a very long time, at all events; but I do not think the\r\nGuadaloupe fossils are as old as the people who lived in the caves in\r\nFrance. Some little ornaments and articles of human workmanship are\r\nfound with these skeletons, which show that the people to whom they\r\nbelonged were still in the Stone Age. There is very little to judge\r\nfrom when we wish to get some idea of the time these fossils have been\r\nin this breccia: but at this particular place the rock is formed pretty\r\nquickly, as we can see; and it is quite likely that these skeletons\r\nwere buried there long after the mammoth, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus\r\ndied out of Europe. However, they are the most complete specimens\r\nwe have of any fossil human beings. In looking at the drawing you will\r\nsee the leg bones and hips, part of the backbone, the ribs of one side,\r\nand an arm bone; but you see no skull, because the bones of the skull\r\nare very thin, and have become crushed down into the limestone. In one\r\nof these fossils, which they have in Paris, taken from near the same\r\nplace, the bones are much more distinct, and part of the lower jaw with\r\nsome teeth in it can be seen. These fossil men no doubt lived before\r\nthe period of written human history began; but they are not considered\r\nto be at all the oldest of pre-historic men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: XIII.\r\n\r\n_The Guadaloupe Human Fossil._]\r\n\r\nTwo periods in the life of mankind followed all these long-lost and\r\nforgotten people, and they are called the Bronze Age and the Iron\r\nAge; but now _history_ comes in, and there are plenty of old records\r\nand books to tell you about these. Bronze is a mixed metal of copper\r\nand tin, and it was used by the oldest nations who have left any\r\nhistories—the Egyptians, Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans. It was better\r\nthan stone because it could be made sharper and would not chip, and\r\nswords and armour, vases, axes, hammers, needles, &c., were made of\r\nit.[28]\r\n\r\nThe Stone Age is beyond all history, the Bronze begins with it, and\r\nthe Iron Age began at some distant time before the dawn of authentic\r\nhistory. Thus we are told, in Genesis iv. 22, that Tubal Cain taught\r\npeople to make it. It was used also by the Egyptians for perhaps 2,000\r\nyears before the Christian era; but the real Iron Age is that in which\r\nwe are living now. We can, indeed, make all metals much better than any\r\nof the older nations.\r\n\r\nBut there is a wide gap between the time when people left off using\r\nstone and discovered bronze and iron; and if one of the Druids could\r\ncome to life he might help us to fill it up, because those old\r\nBritish priests had many secrets, which they told to one another from\r\ngeneration to generation.\r\n\r\nIf the Spanish conquerors had not destroyed the civilization of Mexico\r\nand Peru, we might know something of the discovery of the metals there,\r\nand the people of India and China must have used them long ago; but\r\nthe first use of metal in any country where it was found out would\r\nmost likely be before the people had begun to put their language into\r\nany kind of writing, so that the time would be forgotten among the\r\nmany scraps of lost knowledge which we have tried to collect from the\r\nremains of the industry of pre-historic man.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how much these ancient people differed from us in their\r\ncivilization, and how far they were behind us in everything; but we\r\nmust not suppose that they were very different in bodily size and\r\nshape. Some of their skulls might have belonged to a philosopher, or\r\nthey might have contained the thoughtless brains of a savage. The\r\nskulls from the Cromagnon and Engis caves are quite equal in size and\r\nshape to those of several uncivilized, and even of some civilized\r\nraces of the present time, and there are people in all large cities\r\nwhose heads are not better formed. Though the outward signs of their\r\ncivilization then were so different from ours, it is not certain that\r\ntheir mental capacity was much less.\r\n\r\nA race possessing considerable civilization may, we know, pass away,\r\nas the Assyrians and the Pyramid builders have. In one of the Pacific\r\nislands—Easter Island—a thousand miles from the nearest land, there\r\nare hundreds of carved images of stone, fifty or sixty feet high, and\r\nweighing perhaps a hundred tons each. The people who made these must\r\nhave been very numerous and must have had considerable skill. Yet they\r\nhave passed away. The arts of Nineveh and Babylon have only lately\r\nbecome known, so that, you see, the works of a race may easily become\r\nhidden from us who follow. Quite lately, too, the works of a partly\r\ncivilized people have been discovered in Ohio in America. There are\r\nthere hundreds of mounds and earth embankments forming fortified camps.\r\nSome of them are several miles round, and they could only have been\r\nmade by a very numerous and intelligent people who knew something about\r\ngeometry; for the circles, squares, and angles of these earthworks are\r\nquite as correct as we could make them. Among the multitude of things\r\nfound here are copper tools made by hammering, ornamental pottery,\r\nsilver beads, plates of mica with scrolls and designs engraved on\r\nthem, and carefully carved pieces of stone. These carvings are most\r\ncurious and excellently finished. They represent human heads and\r\nmany animals, such as the bear, otter, wolf, beaver, raccoon, frog,\r\nrattlesnake, heron, crow, &c. A people, then, who could do these things\r\nand took pleasure in doing them must have possessed great intelligence\r\nand a knowledge of things far beyond a simple state. They even had\r\nreligious ideas, such as they were, for they had places for sacrifice.\r\nAll their works are now overgrown by forests, but it is impossible to\r\nmistake them; yet the native Indians of Ohio living now have no idea\r\nthat such a people lived in their country before them, and no tradition\r\nat all about a people whose civilization was so far superior to their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nWe may come nearer to our own times, and look at the Assyrians and\r\nEgyptians. Until quite recently nothing was known about the Assyrians\r\nexcept what could be learned from the few references made to them in\r\nScripture and some ancient writers; but Mr. Layard dug up their cities,\r\nand found that they possessed the arts of building, sculpture, working\r\nin metals, and a written language. All this was buried under the sand\r\nof a desert! Then there is the great Pyramid of Egypt, built in a way\r\nthat we could not surpass, and with much knowledge of geometry and\r\nother sciences.[29] The men who designed and constructed these works\r\ncould not have lived among a half-barbarous people; and as these are\r\nthe highest works of the people, how much there must have been that\r\nwent before, of which there is no trace now, when Assyria and Egypt\r\nwere in _their_ age of stone axes and flint arrow-heads.\r\n\r\nI do not think that the Stone-Age men of Europe were nearly so\r\ncivilized. At all events, they have not left any such imperishable\r\nmonuments as the gigantic images of Easter Island, the earthworks of\r\nthe Ohio people, or the sculptures, writings, and buildings of the\r\nAssyrians and Egyptians; but they might have been more civilized than\r\nthey seem to have been from their simple weapons and tools. They might\r\nhave made many things which were perishable, and have been destroyed\r\nby time—things which would have given us a higher belief in their\r\nintelligence and civilization.\r\n\r\nThe past history of the human race may be compared to the rise and\r\nfall of the tide. Wave after wave has risen higher and higher on the\r\neverlasting shore of Time, and when the tide was at its highest it has\r\nfallen again slowly, to rise again and again in the same way through\r\nmany ages. We know that man may rise slowly from a simple condition\r\nto much civilization and power, and may again sink back almost to\r\nbarbarism, as has been the case with the people of whom we have been\r\nspeaking, and then again a new civilization may grow up. It is possible\r\nthat all now savage nations are the sinking descendants of some, in\r\ncomparison, once civilized people. Modern nations are taking up the\r\nground of savages all over the world, and soon there will be no trace\r\nof these simple people. Thus it may have been with mankind throughout\r\nall the time during which they have occupied the earth, and so it may\r\nbe perhaps again.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] A fine Mexican MS. on diapered cloth, with figures and mystical\r\nsigns, has lately been added to the MS. department of the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\n[23] Some fine examples of papyrus writings on the North-west\r\nStaircase, Upper Floor.\r\n\r\n[24] British Antiquities Room, upper floor, Middle and Upper\r\nShelf-cases, Nos. 1, 2, and 5-12, flint and stone implements.\r\nTable-case B, horn implements from French caves and Swiss\r\nlake-dwellings.\r\n\r\n[25] Examples of stone implements of New Zealanders in Ethnographical\r\nRoom, Cases No. 45-48, upper floor.\r\n\r\n[26] In Lake Mohrya. _Across Africa_, by V.

They are only lumps of rock and lifeless\r\nbones, but they seem to say to you, “We are living again now, because\r\nwe are teaching you a lesson which the great Builder of this Universe\r\nwishes you to learn from us. There is not a stone or fossil among us\r\nbut it has its tale to tell—a tale of time and tide, and long past\r\nages, and innumerable changes, and a life that was, and progress from\r\na lower to a higher existence. We have obeyed the same eternal laws\r\nof one Creator from the beginning, as all things will to the end of\r\ntime. We have opened the great Book of Nature from the first page of\r\nthe ‘life-dawn animal’ to the last, on which the hand of the Almighty\r\nhas written the name of Man—his most perfect work. We, you, and all\r\nthings which have lived and will live, have bodies made of particles\r\nwhich will be returned to the Earth, no single atom of which has been\r\ndestroyed since the first, but has been fashioned over and over again\r\ninto innumerable forms of tree and flower, of gossamer-winged insect\r\nand towering mammoth, throughout the long ages in which our Globe has\r\nknown day and night, cold and heat, summer and winter.”\r\n\r\nThere is nothing sad, if we look at it rightly, in this constant\r\nsuccession of life and death. It is\r\n\r\n                        A moulding\r\n    Of forms, and a wondrous birth,\r\n    And a growing and fair unfolding\r\n    Of life from life, and life from death.\r\n    For death, a mother benign,\r\n    Transformeth but destroyeth not,\r\n    And the new thing fair of the old is wrought.\r\n\r\n  G. F. ARMSTRONG.\r\n\r\nIs it not worth while then to listen to these stories of the Earth—to\r\nspell them out for ourselves? They are written everywhere,—in the\r\nmountains and valleys, the rivers and seas, on the hard faces of\r\ngranite cliffs, on the rounded pebbles of the sea beach, and even in\r\nthe finest dust of the roads. We have not to go far to hear them:\r\nevery foot-step on the ground covers a chapter great or small in the\r\nuniversal history, and the stone walls of our houses could speak with\r\nten thousand tongues of all they witnessed in their long life on the\r\nfloor of an ancient ocean.\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely have a more pleasant occupation and greater interest\r\nthan in searching for and putting together the pieces of this wonderful\r\nand beautiful puzzle, and in doing our utmost to “Summon from the\r\nshadowy Past the forms that once have been.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Age of bronze, 161;\r\n    of iron, 161;\r\n    of reptiles, 81\r\n\r\n  Aleph, 125\r\n\r\n  Amber, 69\r\n\r\n  Ammonites, 90, 97\r\n\r\n  Animal Part, the, 77;\r\n    animals of coal period, 71\r\n\r\n  Ants, white, 61\r\n\r\n  Arctic climate, 67;\r\n    expedition, 67\r\n\r\n  Archæopteryx, 91, 93\r\n\r\n  Australian savages, 127\r\n\r\n\r\n  Babylon and Nineveh, 164, 165\r\n\r\n  Bear, grisly, 106\r\n\r\n  Beginning of life, 58\r\n\r\n  Bird forms, earliest, 89;\r\n    reptiles, 85\r\n\r\n  Blacklead, 58\r\n\r\n  Boulders carried by ice, 48\r\n\r\n  Bogwood, 70\r\n\r\n  Boiling springs, 54\r\n\r\n  Bronze, age of, 161, 162;\r\n    implements in British Museum, 162\r\n\r\n  Brighton Downs, 99\r\n\r\n  Burning mountains, 19\r\n\r\n\r\n  Calamites, 42, 68\r\n\r\n  Cañons of Colorado, 8\r\n\r\n  Caves of Engis and Cromagnon, 163;\r\n    near Belfort and of Switzerland, 141;\r\n    of the Vezère, 139\r\n\r\n  Cetiosaurus, 86\r\n\r\n  Chalk, nature of, 26;\r\n    pits, 20;\r\n    ammonites and foraminifera in, 27;\r\n    period, 95;\r\n    under the ocean, 29, 99\r\n\r\n  “Challenger” expedition, 27\r\n\r\n  Changes have been gradual, 43\r\n\r\n  Cissbury camp, 134\r\n\r\n  Clay, London, 21, 22;\r\n    and mud, 33\r\n\r\n  Climate, Arctic, and of coal formations, 67\r\n\r\n  Club-mosses, 61\r\n\r\n  Clothing, 138\r\n\r\n  Coal beds, 31;\r\n    in Arctic regions, 67;\r\n    plants of the, 63;\r\n    is fossil wood, 73;\r\n    is sunlight compressed, 30\r\n\r\n  Colorado, the people in, 142\r\n\r\n  Compressed plants, 15\r\n\r\n  Conclusion, 168\r\n\r\n  Cookery, 137\r\n\r\n  Corals, 78\r\n\r\n  Creation, the plan of, 117\r\n\r\n  Cretaceous period, 96\r\n\r\n  Cromagnon and Engis, caves of, 163\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dawn of life, 56;\r\n    plant, 59\r\n\r\n  Denudation, 49, 50\r\n\r\n  Dinornis, specimens of, in British Museum, 116\r\n\r\n  Dinosaurus, 89\r\n\r\n  Dinotherium, 114\r\n\r\n  Drawings, pre-historic, 135\r\n\r\n  Dwellings and food of men, 137\r\n\r\n\r\n  Early histories, 123;\r\n    plant life, 59\r\n\r\n  Earth, early history of, 1, 2, 3;\r\n    interior of, 18;\r\n    intense heat of, 24;\r\n    climate of, 48;\r\n    not yet fit for man, 75;\r\n    ‘foraminifera earth’, 30\r\n\r\n  Earthquakes, 18, 19\r\n\r\n  Earthworks of Ohio, 165\r\n\r\n  Easter island monuments, 164\r\n\r\n  Egypt, monuments of, 166\r\n\r\n  Eodendron, 59\r\n\r\n  Eophyton, 59\r\n\r\n  Eozöon, 57, 77\r\n\r\n\r\n  First weapons, 121\r\n\r\n  Fish-lizards, 85\r\n\r\n  Fishes, fossil, 71\r\n\r\n  Flint, origin of, 14;\r\n    in chalk, 96;\r\n    weapons, where found, 131;\r\n    tool manufactory, 134\r\n\r\n  Foraminifera, 20;\r\n    ‘foraminifera earth’, 30;\r\n    drawings of, 97;\r\n    specimens of, in British Museum, 99\r\n\r\n  Forests under the sea, 75, 76\r\n\r\n  Fossil, derivation of, 10;\r\n    plants, 61;\r\n    sunlight, 73;\r\n    footprints, 83;\r\n    human, 157, 159\r\n\r\n  Food and dwellings, 137\r\n\r\n  Footprints, fossil, 83\r\n\r\n  Flying reptiles, 89\r\n\r\n\r\n  Geological part, 17\r\n\r\n  Geology, derivation of, 19\r\n\r\n  Geysers, 54\r\n\r\n  Gigantic animals, 101;\r\n    birds, 115\r\n\r\n  Glaciers and icebergs, 47\r\n\r\n  Granite, raised, 23;\r\n    appearance of, 24\r\n\r\n  Gravel, &c., 35\r\n\r\n  Great Irish Stag, drawing, &c., of, 108\r\n\r\n  Guadaloupe human fossil, 157\r\n\r\n\r\n  Heat of the Earth, 3, 18\r\n\r\n  Hebrew letters, 125\r\n\r\n  Hesperornis, 92\r\n\r\n  Hippopotamus in England, 105\r\n\r\n  Histories, early, 123\r\n\r\n  Human part, the, 120;\r\n    fossils, 157\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ice age, 45;\r\n    more than one, 48\r\n\r\n  Icebergs and glaciers, 47\r\n\r\n  Ichthyornis, 92\r\n\r\n  Ichthyosaurus, 85\r\n\r\n  Implements, flint and stone, in British Museum, 131;\r\n    bronze, 162\r\n\r\n  India, elephants in, 145\r\n\r\n  Insects in coal forests, 64\r\n\r\n  Irish stag, 107\r\n\r\n  Islands appear and disappear, 39\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jet, 69\r\n\r\n  Jurassic age, 89\r\n\r\n\r\n  Kangaroo, fossil, 115\r\n\r\n  Kitchen-middens, 152\r\n\r\n\r\n  Labyrinthodon, 2\r\n\r\n  Lake-dwellers, 146;\r\n    dwellings in Europe, Africa, Asia, and New Guinea, 149\r\n\r\n  Language, origin of;

In this hard\r\ntask Mr. NICOLS has succeeded admirably, without resorting to that\r\nbase subterfuge—the attempt to clothe instruction in the guise of\r\nfiction.... This is true education, for it teaches children first to\r\nobserve and then to reason.... Though the style of this delightful book\r\nis simple and childlike, it is as far as possible removed from being\r\nchildish.’\r\n\r\n  PALL MALL GAZETTE.\r\n\r\n‘The language is plain, the descriptions are lucid, the illustrations\r\napt, and the broad facts of the science are very correctly stated. The\r\nwork, too, is free from all attempts at fine writing.... We wish the\r\nbook success as at any rate an attempt to lay before the young fact\r\ninstead of fiction.’\r\n\r\n  QUARTERLY JOURNAL of SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n‘The book is a successful attempt to explain the simplest facts of\r\ngeology, and of the succession of life on the earth.’\r\n\r\n  WESTMINSTER REVIEW.\r\n\r\n‘The idea is a happy one, and will recommend itself to children; and we\r\nare bound to say that Mr. NICOLS has carried out his idea remarkably\r\nwell, and produced a work which will do much to spread sound notions\r\nupon the gradual development of our earth and its inhabitants to the\r\ncondition in which we now see them.... We can safely recommend Mr.\r\nNICOLS’ little book as one that will have a most beneficial effect in\r\nopening the minds of its young readers.’\r\n\r\n  POPULAR SCIENCE REVIEW.\r\n\r\n‘This is a good little book, cleverly written by an able geologist, and\r\nwell adapted for children. We can recommend the volume as a present to\r\nany intelligent boy or girl.’\r\n\r\n  LANCET.\r\n\r\n‘This book appears to be, in style, language, and scope, eminently\r\nadapted for its purpose, which is to awaken among the little folks an\r\ninterest “in the history of life upon the earth,” and “give them the\r\ntaste for more extended study in after years.”’\r\n\r\n  ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS.\r\n\r\n‘“Though these pages are designed for young persons,” says the Author,\r\n“other readers, perhaps, who are not familiar with the subject, may\r\nfind some interest in them, if they are not deterred by the necessarily\r\nsimple style,”—which, we venture to say, they most assuredly will\r\nnot be.... To many grown persons, therefore, as well as their\r\ndescendants, will this book be a great boon, which, if they are at all\r\nliberal-minded, they will advocate as well as appreciate.... Like the\r\nScience Primers of Professors Huxley, Roscoe, Balfour Stewart, &c., if\r\nduly read and weighed, it will tend to unravel and sweep away a deal of\r\nbaneful superstition.’\r\n\r\n  LAND and WATER.\r\n\r\n‘That Mr. NICOLS has succeeded in the object he proposed to himself\r\nmay be safely affirmed. He has done his work briefly and lucidly, and\r\nhas produced a book capable of arresting the attention, not only of\r\nchildren, but of those from whom they receive their earlier lessons.’\r\n\r\n  The COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n‘A perfect “Open Sesame” for young scientific students, and so\r\ncleverly composed as to make students of those who are not scientific:\r\nnot merely the young, but older people too. Mr. NICOLS thoroughly\r\nunderstands his work.’\r\n\r\n  NOTES and QUERIES.\r\n\r\n‘Easily and attractively written for young people.... The treatment of\r\nso wide a subject, and the condensing it into a volume of 150 pages is\r\nno light task. We can, however, congratulate Mr. NICOLS upon having\r\naccomplished it in so judicious, perhaps, better still, so suggestive\r\na manner; and we have no doubt that his little book will become a\r\nwell-worn favourite in the hands of all thoughtful and intelligent\r\nchildren who may be so fortunate as to possess it.’\r\n\r\n  ENGINEER.\r\n\r\n‘The manner in which the pieces of the puzzle—fossils—are found, put\r\ntogether, and interpreted, is related in language readily understood\r\nby children; the description of the vegetable, animal, and human parts\r\nbeing peculiarly interesting. The illustrations are the best of the\r\nkind with which we are acquainted.... We strongly recommend it.’\r\n\r\n  SCHOOLMASTER.\r\n\r\n‘It is the puzzle as to the history of life on the earth unravelled\r\nin a manner to interest and enlighten the minds, and to develop the\r\nobserving and reflecting faculties of children.... The results of\r\ncostly and laborious investigations in many different branches of\r\nscience are concentrated in these free and easy lessons or colloquial\r\nlectures to young children.... Calculated to arouse an interest in all\r\nbut the dullest and most indifferent juvenile minds.... Will be found\r\ninvaluable to teachers and a great help in the rational cultivation of\r\nthe intelligence of the rising generation.’\r\n\r\n  SCHOOL BOARD CHRONICLE.\r\n\r\n‘The statement of these facts, though made with all the sobriety due to\r\na scientific discourse, has all the interest of a story for the young;\r\nand the narrative, if we mistake not, will interest other readers than\r\nthose for whom it is primarily written. A word of commendation must be\r\ngiven to the illustrations, which are exceedingly well drawn.’\r\n\r\n  EDUCATIONAL TIMES.\r\n\r\n‘To place the “simple truths of science” in rivalry with fairy tales\r\nand merry picture-books is not so hopeless as at first sight may seem;\r\nand certainly the simple, attractive style in which the marvels of the\r\nphysical world are here set out must not only interest, but charm every\r\nbright child of eager intellect. Simplicity is observed to the utmost,\r\nbut it is the simplicity of truth, so that the child is not interested\r\nat the expense of having afterwards to unlearn what he has read or\r\nlistened to.’\r\n\r\n  LIVERPOOL WEEKLY ALBION.\r\n\r\n‘Mr. ARTHUR NICOLS has attempted a task which at first sight seems\r\nextremely difficult, but which he has successfully achieved....\r\nChildren can scarcely help understanding and being interested in the\r\nwonderful story of the earth’s crust, and of past organic life upon it,\r\nwhich he unfolds. There is nothing childish about his style, yet he\r\nwrites with perfect simplicity.... A better book to put into the hands\r\nof thoughtful children, or for use as a text-book by persons engaged in\r\nthe private tuition of the young, it would be difficult to find.’\r\n\r\n  The SCOTSMAN.\r\n\r\n‘Facts are stranger than any fancies which emanate from the writers\r\nof even fairy tales, and when they can be brought home to youthful\r\nstudents by ocular demonstrations the facts are invariably preferred to\r\nthe fancies.... The illustrations which adorn the book are well drawn,\r\nand sufficiently numerous for the purpose.... The Author is a genial\r\nand reliable guide to a solution of the puzzle of life.’\r\n\r\n  ENGLISH MECHANIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nLondon, LONGMANS & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n  pg 29 Changed: For innumerable agest hese little creatures\r\n             to: For innumerable ages these little creatures\r\n\r\n  pg 91 Changed: Footnote 1: Wall-case No. 11 in Room III., several\r\n                   specimens, mperfect\r\n             to: Footnote 1: Wall-case No. 11 in Room III., several\r\n                   specimens, imperfect\r\n\r\n  pg 131 Changed: lived as that these flin weapons and tools\r\n              to: lived as that these flint weapons and tools",
