They each have\r\n\r\nauthorized and aided in the collection of the flora and data contained\r\n\r\nin this publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Louis H. Scholl, of New Braunfels, Texas, Assistant and\r\n\r\nApiarist from 1902 until 1906, the Department is directly indebted for\r\n\r\nthe material contained herein, except as is otherwise designated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Ernest Scholl, now Assistant and Apiarist, has furnished\r\n\r\nmaterial as shown herein. He is now working on a continuation of the\r\n\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. D. C. Milam, of Uvalde, formerly Foul Brood Inspector, has also\r\n\r\ncontributed, as is shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main body of the work, however, has been accomplished through\r\n\r\nthe services of Mr. Louis H. Scholl, and much credit is due him, since\r\n\r\nhe has done more in this Department, and perhaps more than any other\r\n\r\nperson in helping to build up the Bee Industry of Texas. His data are\r\n\r\nfollowed by this mark *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis publication treats of many of the Texas honey plants in a brief\r\n\r\ntechnical manner. In addition, wherever possible, the common name is\r\n\r\nused in connection with the description.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sequence followed by Coulter in his Botany of South West Texas\r\n\r\nis herein mainly followed. In some instances quotations from Small's\r\n\r\nBotany of Texas were used, as is shown in the publication. The plants\r\n\r\nare discussed by families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only is the honey producing qualities of the plants mentioned,\r\n\r\nbut frequent mention is also made of the respective quality and yield\r\n\r\nof pollen and propolis. Data are included in many instances concerning\r\n\r\nthe weather conditions and its effects upon the yield of certain\r\n\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that this will be a great help to apiarists in selecting\r\n\r\nlocations for bees, since the value of bees depends entirely on the\r\n\r\nenvironment under which they may be placed. Again it may help in\r\n\r\nselecting certain plants to be planted that might prove to be very\r\n\r\nbeneficial to an established apiary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution is given in a general brief way, so\r\n\r\nthat one is less apt to be confused concerning the abundance in nature\r\n\r\nof certain plants. In this connection it must be remembered, however,\r\n\r\nthat on account of extended cultivation in Texas, some of the common\r\n\r\nwild plants are becoming less numerous than formerly, while cultivated\r\n\r\nvarieties are becoming more common.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo indices are contained in this bulletin. The first contains all\r\n\r\nthe common or vernacular names, and the second contains the latin or\r\n\r\ntechnical names. The latter is complete, since some plants are known\r\n\r\nonly by the technical appellation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIPLE-LEAFED BARBERRY.
