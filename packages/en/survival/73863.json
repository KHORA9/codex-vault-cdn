The best mode of cultivating this\r\nvaluable root, with the greatest prospect of success, is a subject well\r\nworth the attention of farmers in general, and to those in particular\r\nwho have _strong soils_ to cultivate, and feel the want of green food\r\nfor their cattle and sheep in the winter and spring months of the year.\r\n\r\nSince the first edition of this little work was published, the Author\r\nhas obtained many new lights upon the subject, which he has either\r\nembodied in the present edition, or published in an Appendix. The\r\ncontents show sufficiently to whom his principal obligation is due, and\r\nhe is restrained only by motives of delicacy from saying more. The\r\ncirculation of the work was intended to have been chiefly confined to a\r\nfew of the inland counties, but the encouragement the Author has\r\nreceived, and which he respectfully acknowledges, has induced him to\r\npublish a fourth edition, for more general circulation.\r\n\r\n                                         _Cheese Cross, Romford._\r\n                                                         _Jan. 1, 1815._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE FOLLOWING\r\n\r\n                          NOBLEMEN, GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\n                                  AND\r\n\r\n                                FARMERS,\r\n\r\n                   HAVE ENCOURAGED THIS PUBLICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Most Hon. the Marquis of Bath, Longleat, Wilts.\r\n\r\n  The Right Hon.

I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe garden at Cheese Cross produced a fine crop of the Improved Beet\r\nRoot. The roots, when about the size of a radish, were thinned out with\r\na turnip hoe, leaving the plants nearly 15 inches apart each way. I\r\nselected 60 square yards, 6 by 10, and found the produce to be 360\r\nroots, equal to 29,040 roots upon an acre. They weighed from 1 pound to\r\n12 pounds each, and 10 of them, taken up indiscriminately, weighed 40\r\npounds. Supposing them, therefore, to average 4 pounds each, the\r\n_weight_ upon an acre would be something more than 50 tons. One hundred\r\nweight, cut into small pieces for the cattle, measured 2 bushels. The\r\n_quantity_ per acre may therefore be estimated at 2000 bushels, 2\r\nbushels are given to each bullock daily: 196 bushels, the produce of\r\nonly about a tenth part of an acre of garden ground, planted in this\r\nway, would keep a bullock 14 weeks.\r\n\r\nIn Mason’s field, on the road from Bedfords to Havering, another fine\r\ncrop was obtained. The roots, when about the size of a radish, were\r\ntaken out of the seed bed, and planted in rows, 3 feet asunder, and the\r\nplants were about 18 inches apart in each row. I selected 60 square\r\nyards, 6 by 10, and found the produce to be 126 roots, equal to 10,164\r\nroots upon an acre. These roots weighed, on an average, 5 pounds each,\r\nso that the weight upon an acre would be something more than 22 tons.\r\nEach bullock eats 1 cwt. per day. The produce of 1 acre of ground,\r\nplanted in this way, would keep 4 bullocks feeding for 110 days.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the same field, on the road from Bedfords to\r\nHavering, the seed was dibbled in rows, 2 feet apart, and the plants\r\nwere left 12 inches apart in each row. I selected 60 square yards, 6 by\r\n10, and found the produce to be 270 roots; equal to 21,780 roots upon an\r\nacre. These roots average a little more than 5 pounds each. The weight\r\nupon an acre would therefore be something more than 48 tons. Each\r\nbullock eats 1 cwt. per day. The produce of 1 acre of land, planted in\r\nthis way, would keep 10 bullocks feeding for 97 days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the third year that Mr. Heaton has cultivated the improved Beet\r\nRoot with great success, in three different ways; namely, broadcast on\r\nground under garden culture; and, in the field, by dibbling in the seed,\r\nand transplanting the roots. The result fully justifies a preference in\r\nfavour of dibbling in rows 2 feet apart, as will be seen by the\r\nfollowing short statement of the produce obtained under each mode of\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n                                                             │ PRODUCE.\r\n Broadcast, on strong land, spade-trenched, 10 inches deep,  │ 50 tons\r\n leaving the plants after hoeing nearly 15 inches apart each │per acre.\r\n way,                                                        │\r\n\r\n Transplanted in rows 3 feet apart, and the plants about 18  │ 22 tons\r\n inches apart in each row,                                   │per acre.\r\n\r\n Dibbling the seed in rows 2 feet apart, and the plants left │ 48 tons\r\n 12 inches apart in each row,                                │per acre.\r\n\r\nA good crop may be obtained by the broadcast method upon deep, loose\r\nsoils, or upon strong soils spade-trenched, 10 or 12 inches deep; but by\r\nthat mode much seed is wasted, and much extra expence incurred in\r\nlabour, hoeing, and transplanting, before the plants are placed 5 inches\r\napart each way, which is very material to insure a good crop, under that\r\nmode of culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. III\r\n\r\n\r\nTo those who may have been in the habit of cultivating the Swedish\r\nturnip, it may be desirable to point out the advantages which the\r\nimproved Beet Root has over that turnip. Mr. Heaton had last year, in\r\nhis Havering Green field, the best crop of Swedish turnips that I have\r\never seen, upon his farm, during twelve years’ attention to the\r\nmanagement of it; and his intelligent agent and farmer, Mr. Henry\r\nGibbons, assures me, that he did not see a better crop between London\r\nand Derby, from which latter place he returned in December last.\r\n\r\nThe Swedes in this field were drilled in rows 24 inches apart, and the\r\nplants were left about 9 inches apart in each row. I selected 60 square\r\nyards, 6 by 10, and found the produce to be 252 turnips, equal to 20,356\r\nupon an acre. I weighed many of them, and found them from half a pound\r\nto 6 pounds each, averaging 2 pounds. The weight upon an acre would,\r\ntherefore, be something more than 18 tons: _less_ by 30 tons than the\r\nproduce of an acre of the improved Beet, dibbled in rows 2 feet apart,\r\nand the plants left 12 inches apart in each row.\r\n\r\nThe improved Beet has other material advantages over turnips. The crop\r\nis more certain, as the infant root is not injured by the fly; the\r\nground may be cleared in time to sow wheat upon it, and the Beet\r\nattaining perfection, as it does, before the winter sets in, much labour\r\nand all the difficulty of getting and carting turnips in bad weather are\r\nsaved to the farmer.\r\n\r\nA bushel of the sliced Beet weighs 6 pounds heavier than a bushel of\r\nSwede turnip sliced. Two bushels of it per day satisfies a bullock\r\nbetter than 2 bushels and a half of Swedes; and it is well known, that 2\r\nbushels and a half of Swedes are better than 3 bushels of common\r\nturnips. Sheep are fond of the improved Beet after Christmas; so are\r\npigs, young cattle, and cows; and, with hay or straw, it will be found\r\nexcellent food for young horses. For milch cows, the Beets have a\r\ndecided advantage over turnips. Turnips, from their rankness, spoil the\r\ncream and butter; Beet, from its peculiar sweetness, improves both.\r\n\r\nIt is strongly recommended to the farmers near London to cultivate this\r\nroot, and to the cowkeepers in London to consume it: to them it will be\r\nfound of great value.\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, the Author has been favoured with the\r\nfollowing information, from a Friend, who left his crop in the ground\r\ntill spring.\r\n\r\n“My Beet in the Old Yard has stood the late severe frost better than any\r\ncommon turnips, and perhaps equally well with the Swedes, very few\r\nindeed being injured. Some of them were covered with snow, but others\r\nwere exposed. They were rather small, having been planted so late as\r\nJune.” I. K.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Feb. 23, 1814.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAP. IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the information and guidance of those occupiers of land, who may be\r\ndesirous of cultivating the improved Beet Root upon strong land, the\r\nnext Chapter will contain a particular account of the method used in\r\ncultivating that root upon strong land at Bedfords. The method there\r\nstated, is that which has been found, on three years’ trial, to be least\r\nexpensive in the beginning, and most profitable in the end.—The\r\ncultivation of this root is earnestly recommended to the attention of\r\nall persons farming strong lands with a view to profit. It should never\r\nbe forgotten, that 48 tons, the produce of only a single acre, of this\r\nroot, will make 10 bullocks fat enough for the butcher; and that 6\r\nacres, of equal produce, will fatten 60 bullocks; that the profit on\r\neach bullock will be considerable; and that when the business of feeding\r\nis over, the yard will be full of rich dung: neither should it be\r\nforgotten, that the tenant who sells his straw, cannot partake of any of\r\nthese advantages.\r\n\r\nIn proof of this assertion, the following facts are submitted for\r\nconsideration:\r\n\r\nMr. Heaton bought two lean Welch bullocks, at Harlow Bush Fair, on the\r\n9th of September. They cost together £34. They were pastured on the\r\nRowens till the 20th of November following, when they were tied up, and\r\nfed with Beet Root and oat straw till the 9th of February following,\r\nwhen they were sold together, in Romford market, for the sum of £50;\r\nyielding in twenty-two weeks, a profit of £16, which is equal to 7s. 3d.\r\nper week, for each bullock.\r\n\r\nThese two bullocks were tied up twelve weeks each, in which time they\r\nate eight tons 2 cwt. of Beet Root, the produce of only one-sixth part\r\nof an acre of land, cultivated according to the method recommended in\r\nthe following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAP. V.\r\nTHE METHOD USED IN THE CULTIVATION OF THE IMPROVED BEET ROOT UPON STRONG\r\n                           LAND AT BEDFORDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be proper, in the first place, to state what is meant by strong\r\nland. The surface soil is loamy, and from 4 to 12 inches deep, upon a\r\nbed of strong clay mixed with gravel. It is too heavy, and generally too\r\nwet, in the winter, even for sheep to eat a crop of turnips on the\r\nground; and although good turnips are grown upon it, it is always\r\nnecessary to draw them for the sheep, stall-fed cattle, or for cattle in\r\nthe yards. The ground is prepared to receive the seed, and cleaned in\r\nthe same way as it would have been for Swedish turnips. As that part of\r\nthe business is so well known to all farmers, it is not necessary to\r\nenter into detail upon it.\r\n\r\nIn the middle, or latter end of the month of April, the furrows are set\r\nout with the plough, 2 feet apart, and double ploughed; that is, the\r\nplough returns on the furrow to the point whence it set out, forming a\r\nridge between each furrow.\r\n\r\nDouble ploughing with a common plough is preferred to single ploughing\r\nwith a double mould board plough, because it affords a greater depth of\r\nloose earth than the double mould board plough would produce.\r\n\r\nIn these furrows, the manure, which should be in a rotten state, is\r\ndeposited, after the rate of six cubic yards to an acre.\r\n\r\nThe ridges are then split by the plough going and returning the same way\r\nas before mentioned, leaving the manure immediately under the middle of\r\nthe new ridges, A light roller is then passed along the ridges, in the\r\nmiddle of which the seed is dibbled, so that the plants may receive all\r\nthe benefit which can be derived from the manure.\r\n\r\nThe seed is deposited about an inch deep whilst the moisture is fresh in\r\nthe earth, and covered by drawing a garden rake along the rows.\r\n\r\nAfter this, the light roller is again passed along the ridges, and the\r\nwork is finished.\r\n\r\nWhen the plants are about the size of a radish, they are hoed with a\r\nturnip hoe, leaving the plants in the rows about 12 inches apart. If any\r\nof the seeds fail, and there happen not to be an even crop, the roots,\r\nwhere they are too thick, are drawn out before the hoeing takes place,\r\nand transplanted, to fill up the vacant places, and insure a full crop,\r\nwhich is always certain, inasmuch as 99 plants out of 100, thrive and do\r\nwell. In transplanting, care is necessary to prevent the point of the\r\nroot from turning upwards.\r\n\r\nThe weeds, whilst the plants are young, are kept hoed, but after the\r\nhead of the plant has once spread, no weed can live underneath its\r\nshade, and the expence of hoeing afterwards is very trifling indeed.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the crop is taken up in the month of November, in dry\r\nweather. The tops are cut off _near_ the _crown_ of the plants, and the\r\nplants, when perfectly dry, are piled up in a shed, and covered with\r\nstraw sufficiently thick to preserve them from the frost. They kept last\r\nyear till the latter end of March, and they would have kept much longer.\r\n\r\nThe seed may be had of Cochran, seedsman, in Duke Street, Grosvenor\r\nSquare; of Messrs.

From 3 to 4 pounds of the seed will be\r\nsufficient for an acre of ground, prepared and dibbled according to the\r\nmethod here stated. The price last year was 7s. per pound, but it may\r\nprobably be less hereafter, as the growers of the root, so long as that\r\nhigh price continues, will of course save their own seed, and thereby\r\nlessen the demand from the seedsman.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE METHOD BEFORE DESCRIBED ELUCIDATED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Form of the ridges before manuring.\r\n\r\n                          a     a     a     a\r\n                         /    /    /    /                         /    /    /    /                          /    /    /    /                                  b     b     b\r\n\r\nThe tops of the ridges about 2 inches broad, _a._ _a._ _a._\r\n\r\nIntervals of 24 inches from one _a_ to another.\r\n\r\nDepths about 12 inches from _a_ to _b_.\r\n\r\nFurrows where the manure is deposited, _b._ _b._ _b._\r\n\r\n\r\n            Form of the ridges after splitting and rolling.\r\n\r\n                          A      A      A      A\r\n                         ---    ---    ---    ---\r\n                        /     /     /     /                           /     /     /     /                                ^      ^      ^      ^\r\n                          B      B      B      B\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tops A.

VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will not be supposed, by any intelligent farmer, that where the\r\nquantity of the Improved Beet Root given daily to a bullock is stated,\r\nit is meant that it should be given without dry food. It may, however,\r\nbe necessary to say, that the same dry food must be given with the Beet\r\nas is usually given with turnips. Mr. Heaton last year gave oat straw\r\nonly, and the bullocks did well upon that food, and were sold to profit.\r\nNo doubt they would have been ready for the butcher sooner, had good hay\r\nbeen given to them: but this fact may be relied upon, that fresh\r\nbullocks, fed upon the Beet Root and oat straw, will, in 3 months time,\r\nget fat enough for the butcher.\r\n\r\nIt may also be necessary to observe, that not a word, here stated, is\r\nintended to apply to such light turnip soils as will bear the trampling\r\nof sheep, without injury to the land. Mr. Heaton has none such upon his\r\nfarm, and I have not sufficient knowledge of the management of turnip\r\nland, of that description, to say, whether prudence would warrant any\r\ntrial of the Beet Root upon a large scale, on such soil, to be eaten on\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nWhere a field, selected for a crop of Beet, happens to be in a foul\r\nstate, the seed had better be sown in a garden, and the whole field\r\nplanted with the young Beet, when of the size of a radish. This will\r\ngive time for cleaning the ground, and fitting it for a crop; for,\r\nalthough the Beets are destroyers of weeds, it is not meant to recommend\r\nthe sowing them on foul ground, or in any way to encourage a slovenly\r\nsystem of farming.\r\n\r\nAlthough manure has been used in the cultivation of this root, it is not\r\nabsolutely necessary; and, if not in a rotten state, it does mischief.\r\nGood crops have been obtained at Bedfords _without manure_, and without\r\ninjury to the succeeding crops of corn. Beet is fed from a depth\r\nconsiderably below the reach of the plough, as generally used; so that\r\nit does not draw the surface soil in which corn is fed.\r\n\r\nThe method of cultivating the Beet Root here recommended, is the same as\r\nthat which is used in the cultivation of turnips, in Northumberland and\r\nother parts of the north, with this exception, that the rows there are\r\n27 inches apart. There may be reasons in the north for still preferring\r\nthat space, but in Essex the effect of it, in the cultivation of Beet\r\nRoot, would be, that, instead of 48 tons per acre, 43 tons only would be\r\nobtained. Experience has proved, that the roots do not get to a larger\r\nsize in rows 3 feet apart, than they do in rows 2 feet apart. It may,\r\ntherefore, fairly be presumed, that they would not be larger in rows 27\r\ninches apart; and if not larger, the weight of the crop, per acre, must\r\nbe less, because the plants decrease in number as the rows increase in\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nThe advantages that would arise from the cultivation of these roots,\r\nupon a small part of every strong-land-farm throughout the kingdom, must\r\nbe obvious. Calculations might be given that would astonish and almost\r\nexceed the belief of most readers. Such calculations, however, in\r\ngeneral, are but little attended to, and it is thought better to omit\r\nthem, hoping that enough has been said upon the subject, to fix the\r\nattention of every person interested in the cultivation of land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Fleuron]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           _Workington Hall, Cumberland,\r\n                                                       March 9, 1814._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\n          I had the pleasure of receiving your obliging favour last\r\n  night, with two copies of the publication on Mangel Wurzel. I have\r\n  cultivated that root for some years with success. From the Bishop of\r\n  Derry I learnt to apply the leaves to soiling my milch cows and pigs.\r\n  The leaves of a good crop are from 10 to 15 tons per acre. I have\r\n  steeped the seed and mixed it with sand previous to sowing, by which\r\n  means it vegetates immediately. I have had 60 tons per acre on 3 feet\r\n  stiches, 9 inches between the plants, and have kept the roots good\r\n  till the middle of May. I have given the seed to many of my cottagers,\r\n  who have grown the roots for their pigs, and they have found them to\r\n  answer well.\r\n\r\n                                                       I am, &c.\r\n                                                           J.

My object was, to make it last the longer, as the milk and\r\n  cream were evidently much improved thereby. The cows always had plenty\r\n  of hay with the Beet, and when the weather, or rather the state of the\r\n  land would admit, they were turned into a grass field adjoining my\r\n  farm yard.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Turney, of Sedgbrook, who has finished off some bullocks this\r\n  Autumn, whilst at grass, with Beet, has given it with great good\r\n  effect to his milch cows for the last two winters, and he is at this\r\n  time keeping a new-calved heifer upon it.\r\n\r\n  I may add, that I have always found the milk to be increased in\r\n  quantity, as well as improved in quality, whilst the Beet was used.\r\n\r\n  As to the weight of my crop, this year, it is much less than usual. My\r\n  land, you know, is old garden ground, and produced a crop of Beet last\r\n  year, Swedes the year before, and carrots in 1811. A tenacious loam,\r\n  on clay, difficult to work in the Spring. On this I got only 7 cwt. 2\r\n  qrs. on 6 yards by 10, which is after the rate of 30 tons per acre.\r\n\r\n                                                    I am, &c.\r\n                                                        JONATHAN KENDAL.\r\n\r\n                                                 _Stag Brewhouse,\r\n                                                     December 18, 1814._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\n          Herewith you receive my report of a small piece of land,\r\n  planted with Mangel Wurzel by Colonel Elliott. I have been as correct\r\n  as possible, and have to observe, that I think the culture of it well\r\n  worth the attention of every farmer.\r\n\r\n  The latter end of April, 1814, ten poles of land were sown with Mangel\r\n  Wurzel, 20 inches distance, in drills; the plants in the row thinned\r\n  to about 15 inches. The land poor, consisting principally of brick\r\n  rubbish and road scrapings, with a slight coat of _rotten dung_\r\n  previous to the sowing. It had two hoeings after the plants were\r\n  thinned. The plants in two of the rows, about the centre of the piece,\r\n  were set out 2 feet apart, but these were not larger than where they\r\n  were at 15 inches.\r\n\r\n  On the 8th of November the whole crop was taken up, and, after cutting\r\n  off the heads, were packed up in a loft. To prevent any incorrectness\r\n  in calculating the weight by the number of the roots, the whole crop\r\n  was weighed, which amounted to 3 tons, 1 cwt. 56 pounds, which is\r\n  according to the rate of 49 tons 4 cwt. per acre. A large portion of\r\n  the roots weighed from 7 lbs. to 12 lbs. each. When the rows were\r\n  first thinned, some other pieces were planted with the spare plants,\r\n  but these did not succeed so well: they were much less than the\r\n  others.\r\n\r\n  Hogs are remarkably fond of this root, and thrive very fast with it:\r\n  cows are also very eager after both leaves and root. Colonel Elliott\r\n  began feeding his cows with the Mangel Wurzel in July; the weather\r\n  being very dry, we were very short of grass. We began with the leaves,\r\n  and soon after with the roots of two pieces, which were transplanted.\r\n  The cows looked well and increased in their milk, and were partially\r\n  fed with the roots till the crop was taken up. The roots were then\r\n  sliced, and as much of them given to the cows (with a little hay) as\r\n  they could eat; the milk increased immediately, and the cows improved\r\n  in flesh.\r\n\r\n  My opinion is, that the Mangel Wurzel is a most valuable article of\r\n  food to the farmer; because, in a severe winter, when turnips are in\r\n  general destroyed, these roots, properly stacked in a dry place, and\r\n  covered so as to prevent severe frosts from injuring them, will be a\r\n  certain supply of nutricious and fattening food, (if cultivated in\r\n  sufficient quantity) until the spring grass is fit to turn in upon. I\r\n  should conceive, if the seed is put into the ground in the month of\r\n  May, after the manner practised in drilling turnips on ridges, that no\r\n  doubt can be entertained of obtaining a full crop. As Mangel Wurzel\r\n  exceeds all other winter food, from being preserved under cover\r\n  without injuring the quality, so it will prevent a recurrence to the\r\n  expensive food of oil cake or corn.\r\n\r\n                                                    I am, &c.\r\n                                                            G.

On this piece he caused a\r\n  quantity of soil and rotten dung intermixed therewith to be laid, and\r\n  the ground levelled, about 10 or 12 inches deep. In the month of May\r\n  he commenced dibbling the seed in rows 2 feet asunder, and 1 foot\r\n  apart in the rows; but, for want of time, only about one third part of\r\n  the crop was got in by this mode. The remainder was transplanted in\r\n  the middle of June. The whole of the land was kept perfectly clean,\r\n  and, while confined to the upper soil, the plants made rapid progress.\r\n  Had the subsoil been of a yielding nature, the crop would have been\r\n  extraordinary; but it was observable, although the tap roots were\r\n  particularly vigorous, that so soon as they had penetrated to the\r\n  unbroken clay, they invariably divided and turned off in a horizontal\r\n  direction, and afterwards threw out fibrous shoots without number. The\r\n  seed was procured from a nurseryman at Fulham, and was particularly\r\n  good. Very few of the plants ran up to seed; those that did so, were\r\n  not suffered to remain, but were taken up and given to the cows, as\r\n  were also the lower leaves, which were repeatedly stripped off in\r\n  considerable quantities. In the middle of November the whole crop was\r\n  drawn off and weighed, after being cleared of the tops and loose dirt.\r\n  The produce was 15 tons and a few pounds over, average weight of the\r\n  roots, 5¾ pounds. Correspondent produce 40 tons per acre.\r\n\r\n  Although this experiment on Mr. Laycock’s land falls short of those\r\n  stated in your Treatise, yet, when the extreme unfavourableness of its\r\n  situation is considered, that of an exhausted brickfield, the\r\n  deficiency is easily accounted for. Indeed I cannot help thinking its\r\n  result such, as to hold out considerable temptation to occupiers of\r\n  strong clay farms, whereon turnips cannot successfully be cultivated,\r\n  to make trial of a root, which, with previous winter plowing, promises\r\n  more profit than can be obtained from any other crop that I know\r\n  of[1]. The increase of live stock and radical improvements of such\r\n  farms must necessarily follow.\r\n\r\n                                                   I am, &c.\r\n                                                           PETER POTTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  This description of soil in some seasons is too wet to warrant the\r\n  removal of a crop of Mangel Wurzel in November. When grown on such\r\n  soils to be used early in the winter, the crop may be taken up in\r\n  October; if intended for use in the cold spring months it may remain,\r\n  with perfect safety, till the ground is sufficiently dry to prevent\r\n  harm being done by the wheels of carts and the trampling of\r\n  horses.—EDITOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                             _Lincroft House, Lichfield.\r\n                                                     December 13, 1814._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\n          I have for your information weighed and taken a pretty\r\n  accurate account of my small crop of Mangel Wurzel, which I have\r\n  lately gathered out of a garden belonging to my farm. The length of\r\n  the garden is 62 yards; and the breadth of the part sown 12 yards, and\r\n  the produce, according to my firm belief and best calculation, is 4\r\n  tons, 6 cwt. 40 pounds, and I am well convinced in my own mind, that\r\n  had I properly attended to the culture of this root, I might have\r\n  obtained a much greater produce, even in that space of ground; for,\r\n  you will observe, I have not strictly adhered to the plan laid down in\r\n  your little publication. In the first instance, the ground was very\r\n  foul at the time of sowing, and the plants, when growing, were about\r\n  18 inches apart one way, and nearly one yard the other; there being\r\n  only 13 rows in the space of 12 yards, and the garden too surrounded\r\n  with trees, so that I consider every thing was unfavourable. I further\r\n  beg leave to state as my opinion, that as the ground is very strong,\r\n  it is not well adapted to the growth of Beet, and as most of the roots\r\n  were transplanted, they had not a fair chance.\r\n\r\n  Transplanted roots are seldom so good as those which have not been\r\n  removed. I have given Beet Root, for two years past, both to feeding\r\n  and milch cows with good effect.\r\n\r\n                                                         I am &c.\r\n                                                             J.

The seed was partly sown in beds a yard and a half in width,\r\n  partly drilled, and partly dibbled in ridges at the distance of 28\r\n  inches, and the plants left 12 inches apart after hoeing. The rows\r\n  drilled came up much the best, and continued altogether the finest\r\n  plants. They were thinned and hoed early. The dibbled seed missed in a\r\n  great number of places[2]; the vacancies were supplied from the\r\n  drilled rows, transplanted at different ages, and at different times\r\n  of the year, (as the season suited for the purpose,) but none of them\r\n  grew in size or luxuriance[2] equal to those left standing in the\r\n  drilled rows. In the beds the plants were extremely numerous, but they\r\n  had not the same advantages of being thinned and hoed so early as the\r\n  drilled rows, and they were in general small in size.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n    Probably planted too deep.—EDITOR.\r\n\r\n  I had a most productive supply of green food to the fold yard, during\r\n  the months of September and October, from the tops, and during the\r\n  latter month many of the plants which had run to seed, were also taken\r\n  up and consumed in the same way. They were given to milch cows morning\r\n  and evening, during milking time, and to store pigs in the fold yard.\r\n\r\n  The produce on 6 yards by 10 was 206 roots in number, and 477 pounds\r\n  in weight, to which may be added about one-tenth more for plants\r\n  consumed before the crop was taken up.\r\n\r\n  I think the Beet Root affords a very material increase to the stock of\r\n  green food, of the best quality in the Autumn. months, and, when grown\r\n  near enough to the farm yard to be taken daily as wanted, without too\r\n  great an expence in labour and carriage, that mode of consuming the\r\n  leaves and some of the roots may be resorted to with great advantage,\r\n  and it may be found a resource of no small use in dry seasons.\r\n\r\n  Cattle in general eat both the root and top with eagerness. Pigs\r\n  prefer them to any other vegetable food. I have occasionally given the\r\n  roots in winter to horses, and particularly to brood mares and to\r\n  foals, with hay, and they have invariably done well.\r\n\r\n                                                          I am, &c.\r\n                                                              JOHN SHAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese and many other letters have been received by the author from\r\ngentlemen residing in different parts of the kingdom, recommending, from\r\ntheir own experience and success, the culture of the improved Beet Root,\r\nto those farmers who have yet to learn its value.
