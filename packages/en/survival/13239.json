SAVORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOXFORD\r\n\r\nBASIL BLACKWELL\r\n\r\n1920\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nAs a result of increased facilities within the last quarter of a\r\ncentury for the exploration of formerly inaccessible parts of the\r\ncountry, interest concerning our ancient villages has been largely\r\nawakened. Most of these places have some unwritten history and\r\npeculiarities worthy of attention, and an extensive literary field is\r\nthus open to residents with opportunities for observation and\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nSuch records have rarely been undertaken in the past, possibly because\r\nthose capable of doing so have not recognized that what are the\r\ntrivial features of everyday life in one generation may become\r\nexceptional in the next, and later still will have disappeared\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nGilbert White, who a hundred and thirty years ago published his\r\n_Natural History of Selborne_, was the first, and I suppose the most\r\neminent, historian of any obscure village, and it is surprising, as\r\nhis book has for so long been regarded as a classic, that so few have\r\nattempted a similar record. His great work remains an inspiring ideal\r\nwhich village historians can keep in view, not without some hope of\r\nproducing a useful description of country life as they have seen it\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge with grateful thanks the kind help of\r\nfriends and correspondents which I have received in writing this book.\r\nMr. Warde Fowler was good enough to look through the chapters while\r\nstill in manuscript, and I have also received great help from Mr.\r\nHerbert A. Evans, who has read through the proofs. The help of\r\nothers--besides those whose names I give in the text--has been less\r\ngeneral and mostly confined to some details in the historical part of\r\nthe first chapter, and to portions of the subject-matter of the last.\r\nMr. Hugh Last, Fellow of St. John's College, Oxford, most kindly gave\r\nmuch valuable time to the examination of the Roman coins and assigning\r\nthem to their respective reigns; he contributed also the notes on the\r\nEmperors, with special reference to the events in Britain which\r\noccurred during their reigns. Mr. Dudley F. Nevill of Burley helped me\r\nin a variety of ways, and Mr. C.A. Binyon of Badsey supplied some of\r\nthe historical details and information about the ancient roads.\r\n\r\nLooking back over the years I spent at Aldington, I see much more\r\nsunshine and blue sky than cloud and storm, notwithstanding the\r\ndifficulties of the times. It is a continual source of pleasure to go\r\nover the familiar fields in imagination and to recall the kindly faces\r\nof my loyal and willing labourers. I trust that what I have written of\r\nthem will make plain my grateful remembrance of their unfailing\r\nsympathy and ready help.--ARTHUR H. SAVORY.\r\n\r\nBURLEY, HANTS.\r\n\r\n_January_, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                       PAGE\r\n\r\n    I.

In addition to Celtic, Roman,\r\nand Anglo-Saxon associations, it figured before the Norman Conquest in\r\nconnection with the Monastery and Abbey of Evesham, the Manor and the\r\nmill being mentioned in the Abbey records; and they were afterwards\r\nset down in Domesday Survey.\r\n\r\nThe Vale of Evesham, in which Aldington is situated, lies at the foot\r\nof the Cotswold Hills, and when approached from them a remarkable\r\nchange in climate and appearance is at once noticeable. Descending\r\nfrom Broadway or Chipping Campden--that is, from an altitude of about\r\n1,000 feet to one of 150 or less--on a mid-April day, one exchanges,\r\nwithin a few miles, the grip of winter, grey stone walls and bare\r\ntrees, for the hopeful greenery of opening leaves and thickening\r\nhedges, and the withered grass of the Hill pastures for the luxuriance\r\nof the Vale meadows.\r\n\r\nThe earliness of the climate and the natural richness of the land is\r\nthe secret of the intensive cultivation which the Vale presents, and\r\nyear by year more and more acres pass out of the category of farming\r\ninto that of market-gardening and fruit-growing. The climate, however,\r\nthough invaluable for early vegetable crops, is a source of danger to\r\nthe fruit. After a few days of the warm, moist greenhouse temperature\r\nwhich, influenced by the Gulf Stream, comes from the south-west up the\r\nSevern and Avon valleys, between the Malverns and the Cotswolds, and\r\nwhich brings out the plum blossom on thousands of acres, a bitter\r\nfrost sometimes occurs, when the destruction of the tender bloom is a\r\ntragedy in the Vale, while the Hills escape owing to their more\r\nbackward development.\r\n\r\nThe Manor House had been added to and largely altered, but many years\r\nhad brought it into harmony with its surroundings, while Nature had\r\ndealt kindly with its colouring, so that it carried the charm of long\r\nuse and continuous human habitation. Behind the house an old walled\r\ngarden, with flower-bordered grass walks under arches of honeysuckle\r\nand roses, gave vistas of an ample mill-pond at the lower end, forming\r\none of the garden boundaries. The pond was almost surrounded by tall\r\nblack poplars which stretched protecting arms over the water, forming\r\na wide and lofty avenue extending to the faded red-brick mill itself,\r\nand whispering continuously on the stillest summer day. The mill-wheel\r\ncould be seen revolving and glittering in the sunlight, and the hum of\r\ndistant machinery inside the mill could be heard. The brook, which fed\r\nthe pond, was fringed by ancient pollard willows; it wound through\r\nluxuriant meadows with ploughed land or cornfields still farther back.\r\nThe whole formed a peaceful picture almost to the verge of drowsiness,\r\nand reminded one of the \"land in which it seemèd always afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThe space below the house and the upper part of the garden immediately\r\nbehind it was occupied by the rickyard, reaching to the mill and pond,\r\nand a long range of mossy-roofed barns divided it from the farmyard\r\nwith its stables and cattle-sheds.\r\n\r\nThe village occupied one side only of the street, as it was\r\ncalled--the street consisting of two arms at a right angle, with the\r\nManor House near its apex. The cottages were built, mostly in pairs,\r\nof old brick, and tiled, having dormer windows, and gardens in front\r\nand at the sides, well stocked with fruit-trees and fruit-bushes, and\r\nthis helped the cottagers towards the payment of their very moderate\r\nrents, which had remained the same, I believe, for the best part of\r\nhalf a century.\r\n\r\nThroughout all the available space not so occupied, on either side of\r\nthe two arms of the street, and again behind the cottages themselves,\r\nbeautiful old orchards, chiefly of apple-trees, formed an unsurpassed\r\nsetting both when the blossom was out in pink and white, or the fruit\r\nwas ripening in gold and crimson, and even in winter, when the grey\r\nlimbs and twisted trunks of the bare trees admitted the level rays of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nThe farm consisted of about 300 acres of mixed arable and grass land\r\non either side of two shallow valleys, along which wandered the main\r\nbrook and its tributary, uniting, where the valleys joined, into one\r\nlarger stream, so that all the grass land was abundantly supplied with\r\nwater for the stock. These irregular brooks, bordered throughout their\r\nwhole course with pollard willows, made a charming feature and gave\r\ngreat character to the picture.\r\n\r\nIn the records of Evesham Abbey we find the Manor, including the lands\r\ncomprised therein, among the earliest property granted for its\r\nendowment. The erection of the Abbey commenced about 701, and William\r\nof Malmesbury, writing of the loneliness of the spot, tells us that a\r\nsmall church, probably built by the Britons, had from an early date\r\nexisted there. In 709 sixty-five manses were given by Kenred, King of\r\nMercia, leagued with Offa, King of the East Angles, including one in\r\nAldinton _(sic)_, and Domesday Survey mentions one hide of land\r\n(varying from 80 to 120 acres in different counties) in Aldintone\r\n_(sic)_ as among the Abbey possessions at the time of the Norman\r\nConquest.\r\n\r\nAbbot Randulf, who died in 1229, built a grange at Aldington, and\r\nbought Aldington mill, in the reign of Henry III., when the hamlet was\r\na _berewic_ or corn farm held by the Abbey; and at the time of the\r\nDissolution it was granted to Sir Philip Hoby, who appears to have\r\nbeen an intimate of Henry VIII., together with the Abbey buildings\r\nthemselves and much of its other landed property. The Manor remained\r\nin the hands of the Hoby family for many years, and was one of Sir\r\nPhilip's principal seats. Freestone from the Abbey ruins seems to have\r\nbeen largely used for additions probably made in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, for in some alterations I made about 1888, I found many\r\ncarved and moulded stones, built into the walls, evidently the remains\r\nof arches from an ecclesiastical building, and Sir Philip Hoby is\r\nknown to have treated the Abbey ruins as if they were nothing better\r\nthan a stone quarry.\r\n\r\nLeland, who by command of Henry VIII. visited Evesham very soon after\r\nthe Dissolution, says that there was \"noe towene\" at Evesham before\r\nthe foundation of the Abbey, and the earliest mention of a bridge\r\nthere is recorded in monastic chronicles in 1159.\r\n\r\nThere is a notice of a Mr. Richard Hoby, youngest brother of Sir\r\nPhilip, as churchwarden in 1602, and a monument, much dilapidated, is\r\nto be seen in the chancel of Badsey Church, erected to the memory of\r\nhis wife and that of her first husband by Margaret Newman, their\r\ndaughter, who married Richard Delabere of Southam, Warwickshire, in\r\n1608. Aldington afterwards became the property of Sir Peter Courtene,\r\nwho was created a baronet in 1622.\r\n\r\nAnother explanation of the origin of the carved and moulded stones\r\nmentioned above may be found in the former existence of a chapel at\r\nAldington, for there is evidence that a chapel existed there\r\nimmediately before the Dissolution. In an article in Badsey Parish\r\nMagazine by Mr. E.A.B. Barnard, F.S.A., brought to my notice by the\r\neditor, the Rev. W.C. Allsebrook, Vicar, details are given of the will\r\nof Richard Yardley of Awnton (Aldington), dated January 22, 1531, in\r\nwhich the following bequests are made:\r\n\r\n     To the Mother Church of Evesham, 2s.\r\n     To the Church of Badsey, a strike of wheat.\r\n     To the Church of Wykamford, one strike of barley.\r\n     To the Chappell at Awnton, one hog, one strike of wheat, and\r\n       one strike of barley.\r\n\r\nThe chapel, however, disappeared, and seems to have been superseded by\r\nthe assignment of the transept of Badsey Church as the Aldington\r\nChapel, and in 1561-62 the first churchwarden for Aldington was\r\nelected at Badsey. The assignment may, however, have been only a\r\nreturn to a much earlier similar arrangement when the transept was\r\nadded to Badsey Church about the end of the thirteenth century,\r\npossibly expressly as a chapel for Aldington.\r\n\r\nThat it was an addition is proved by the remains of the arch over a\r\nsmall Norman window in the north wall of the nave, which had to be cut\r\ninto to allow of the opening into the new transept. A shelf or ledge\r\nis still to be seen in the east wall of the transept, probably the\r\nremains of a super-altar, and, to the right of it, a piscina on the\r\nnorth side of the chancel arch, and therefore inside the transept.\r\n\r\nA large square pew and a smaller one behind it in the transept were\r\nfor centuries the recognized seats of the Aldington Manor family and\r\ntheir servants, and so remained until the restoration of the church in\r\n1885, when the pews were taken down and a row of chairs as near as\r\npossible to the old position was allotted for the use of the same\r\noccupants.\r\n\r\nIn 1685 the Jarrett monument was placed immediately over the larger\r\npew in the east wall of the transept, bearing the following\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n     Near this place lies interred in hope\r\n     of a joyful Resurrection the bodies of\r\n\r\n     WILLIAM JARRETT\r\n\r\n     of Aldington in this Parish Gent, aged 73\r\n     years, who died Anno Domini 1681\r\n     and of Jane his wife the daughter of William\r\n     Wattson of Bengeworth Gent, who died\r\n     Anno Domini 1683, aged 73 years,\r\n     by whom he had Issue three Sons\r\n     and two Daughters. Thomas Augustin and\r\n     Jane ley buried here with them and\r\n     Mary the youngest Daughter Married\r\n     Humphrey Mayo of hope in the County\r\n     of Herreford Gent, and William\r\n     the Eldest Son Marchant in London\r\n     set this Monument in a dutiful\r\n     and affectionate memory of them 1685.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to think of William, the eldest son, \"marchant,\"\r\nreturning in his prosperity to the quiet old village, braving the\r\ndangers and inconveniences of unenclosed and miry roads, and riding\r\nthe 100 odd miles on horseback, to revisit the scenes of his\r\nchildhood, in order to do honour to the memories of his father and\r\nmother. What a contrast to the crowded streets of London the old place\r\nmust have presented, and one has an idea that perhaps he regretted, in\r\nspite of his success in commerce, that he had not elected in his\r\nyounger days to pursue the simple life.\r\n\r\nThe monument is a somewhat elaborate white marble tablet with a plump\r\ncherub on guard, and with many of the scrolls and convolutions typical\r\nof the Carolean and later Jacobean taste. This monument was removed to\r\nthe north wall of the nave two centuries later, in 1885, when the\r\nchurch was restored, to allow of access to the new vestry then added.\r\n\r\nWilliam Jarrett, senr., and his wife lived through the very stirring\r\ntimes of the Civil War in the reign of Charles I., about twenty miles\r\nonly from Edgehill, where, in 1642, twelve hundred men are reported to\r\nhave fallen. It is said that on the night of the anniversary of the\r\nbattle, October 23, in each succeeding year the uneasy ghosts of the\r\ncombatants resume the unfinished struggle, and that the clash of arms\r\nis still to be heard rising and falling between hill and vale. The\r\nworthy couple must have almost heard the echoes of the Battle of\r\nWorcester in 1651, only eighteen miles distant, and have been well\r\nacquainted with the details of the flight of Charles II., who, after\r\nhe left Boscobel, passed very near Aldington on his way to the old\r\nhouse at Long Marston, where he spent a night, and, to complete his\r\ndisguise, turned the kitchen spit. This old house is still standing,\r\nand is regarded with reverence.\r\n\r\nThe cherub on the Jarrett tablet bears a strong resemblance to two\r\nsimilar cherubs which support a royal crown carved on the back of an\r\nold walnut chair which I bought in the village in a cottage near the\r\nManor House. The design is well known as commemorating the restoration\r\nof Charles II. in 1660, and I like to think that in bringing it back I\r\nrestored it to its old home, and that William Jarrett, senr., who was\r\ndoubtless a Royalist, enjoyed a peaceful pipe on many a winter's night\r\ntherein enthroned. I noticed, lately, in a description of a similar\r\nchair in the _Connoisseur_, that the cherubs are spoken of as\r\n_amorini_; I have always understood that they are angelic beings\r\nsupporting or guarding the sacred crown of the martyred King, though\r\npossibly the appellation is not unsuitable if they are to be regarded\r\nin connection with Charles II. alone.\r\n\r\nThere is a story of a hosiery factory established by refugee Huguenots\r\nat the date of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, 1685, and the\r\nJacobean building adjoining the east end of the Manor House is\r\nprobably the place referred to. Later it became a malthouse, and later\r\nstill was converted into hop-kilns by me. Being of Huguenot descent\r\nmyself, I take a special interest in this tradition.\r\n\r\nIn 1715 Aldington took its part in preparing to resist the Jacobites,\r\nand the following record is copied from an old manuscript:\r\n\r\n  A BILL FOR Y^e CONSTABLE OF ANTON DUN BY ME WM.

There is a tradition that the Manor\r\nHouse was a small but beautiful old building, with a high-pitched\r\nstone-slate roof and three gables in line at the front; but these\r\ndisappeared, the pitch of the roof was reduced, and about 1850 the\r\nmodern part of the house was added at the southern extremity of the\r\nold structure.\r\n\r\nAs the neighbouring parish of Wickhamford is referred to in connection\r\nwith Badsey and Aldington several times in these pages, it may not be\r\nout of place to give the following inscription on the tombstone of a\r\nmember of the Washington family. It is particularly of interest at the\r\npresent time, more especially to Americans, and it has not, as far as\r\nI am aware, previously appeared in any other book.\r\n\r\n                       INSCRIPTION\r\n\r\n            ON THE TOMBSTONE LYING ON THE NORTH\r\n          SIDE OF THE ALTAR, IN THE PARISH CHURCH\r\n           OF WICKHAMFORD, NEAR EVESHAM, IN THE\r\n                COUNTY OF WORCESTER, ENGLAND.\r\n                                    M.S.\r\n\r\n                         _PENELOPES_\r\n\r\n     Filiæ perillustris & militari virtute clarissimi\r\n              Henrici Washington, collonelli,\r\n     Gulielmo Washington ex agro Northampton\r\n                     Milite prognati;\r\n        ob res bellicosas tam Angl: quam Hiberniâ\r\n               fortiter, & feliciter gestas,\r\n        Illustrissimis Principib: & Regum optimis\r\n            Carolo primo et secundo charissimi:\r\n       Qui duxit uxorem Elizabetham ex antiquâ, et\r\n           Generosâ prosapiâ Packingtoniensium\r\n                       De Westwood;\r\n         Familiâ intemeratae fidei in principes,\r\n                   et amoris in patriam.\r\n     Ex praeclaris hisce natalibus Penelope oriunda,\r\n            Divini Numinis summâ cum religione\r\n                     Cultrix assidua;\r\n          Genetricis (parentum solæ superstitis)\r\n                     Ingens Solatium;\r\n       Aegrotantib. et egentib. mirâ promptitudine\r\n                  Liberalis et benefica;\r\n         Humilis & casta, et soli Christo nupta;\r\n         Ex hac vitâ caducâ ad sponsum migravit\r\n                  Febr. 27 An.

He was\r\n             descended from Sir William Washington,\r\n           Knight, of the county of Northampton, who\r\n         was highly esteemed by those most illustrious\r\n          Princes and best of Kings, Charles the First\r\n        and Second, for his valiant and successful warlike\r\n              deeds both in England and in Ireland:\r\n            he married ELIZABETH, of the ancient and\r\n          noble stock of the _Packingtons_ of Westwood,\r\n         a family of untarnished fidelity to its Prince\r\n            and love to its country. Sprung from such\r\n          illustrious ancestry, PENELOPE was a diligent\r\n           and pious worshipper of her Heavenly Father.\r\n            She was the consolation of her mother, her\r\n            only surviving parent; a prompt and liberal\r\n           benefactress of the sick and poor; humble and\r\n            pure in spirit, and wedded to Christ alone.\r\n\r\n                From this fleeting life she migrated\r\n                          to her Spouse,\r\n                 _February 27, Anno Domini. 1697_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FARM BAILIFF.\r\n\r\n\"If a job _has_ to be done you may as well do it first as last.\"\r\n                                                    --WILLIAM BELL.\r\n\r\nThe labourers born and bred in the Vale of Evesham are mostly tall and\r\npowerful men, and mine were no exception; where the land is good the\r\nmen compare favourably in size and strength with those in less\r\nfavoured localities, and the same applies to the horses, cattle, and\r\nsheep; but the Vale, with its moist climate, does not produce such\r\nruddy complexions as the clear air of the Hills, and even the apples\r\ntell the same story in their less brilliant colouring, except after an\r\nunusually sunny summer. In the days of the Whitsuntide gatherings for\r\ngames of various kinds, sports, and contests of strength, the Vale men\r\nexcelled, and certain parishes, famous for the growth of the best\r\nwheat, are still remembered as conspicuously successful.\r\n\r\nMy men, though grown up before education became compulsory, could all\r\nread and write, and they were in no way inferior to the young men of\r\nthe present day. They were highly skilled in all the more difficult\r\nagricultural operations, and it was easy to find among them good\r\nthatchers, drainers, hedgers, ploughmen, and stockmen; they were,\r\nmostly, married, with families of young children, and they lived close\r\nto their work in the cottages that went with the farm. They exhibited\r\nthe variations, usual in all communities, of character and\r\ndisposition, and though somewhat prejudiced and wedded to old methods\r\nand customs they were open to reason, loyal, and anxious to see the\r\nland better farmed and restored to the condition in which the late\r\ntenant found it, when entering upon his occupation seven years\r\npreviously.\r\n\r\nThe late tenant, my predecessor, though a gentleman and a pleasant man\r\nto deal with, was no farmer for such strong and heavy land as the farm\r\npresented; it was no fault of his, for the farmer, like the poet, is\r\nborn, not made, and, as I was often told, he was \"nobody's enemy but\r\nhis own.\" His wife came of a good old stock of shorthorn breeders\r\nwhose name is known and honoured, not only at home, but throughout the\r\nUnited States of America, our Dominions, and wherever the shorthorn\r\nhas established a reputation; and my men were satisfied that she was\r\nthe better farmer of the two.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely bargained for the foul condition of the stubbles,\r\ndisclosed when the corn was harvested shortly before I took possession\r\nat Michaelmas; they were overrun with couch grass--locally called\r\n\"squitch\"--and the following summer I had 40 acres of bare-fallow,\r\nrepeatedly ploughed, harrowed, and cultivated throughout the whole\r\nseason, which, of course, produced nothing by way of return. My\r\npredecessor had found that his arable land was approaching a condition\r\nin which it was difficult to continue the usual course of cropping,\r\nand had expressed his wish to one of the men that all the arable was\r\ngrass. He was answered, I was told:\r\n\r\n     \"If you goes on as you be a-going it very soon will be!\" I\r\n     heard, moreover, that a farming relative of his, on\r\n     inspecting the farm, shortly before he gave it up, had\r\n     pronounced his opinion that it was \"all going to the devil\r\n     in a gale of wind!\"\r\n\r\nI soon recognized that I had a splendid staff of workers, and, under\r\nadvice from the late tenant, I selected one to be foreman or bailiff.\r\nBlue-eyed, dark-haired, tall, lean, and muscular, he was the picture\r\nof energy, in the prime of life. Straightforward, unselfish, a natural\r\nleader of men, courageous and untiring, he immediately became devoted\r\nto me, and remained my right hand, my dear friend, and adviser in the\r\npractical working of the farm, throughout the twenty years that\r\nfollowed. Like many of the agricultural labourers, his remote\r\nancestors belonged to a class higher in the social scale, and there\r\nwere traditions of a property in the county and a family vault in\r\nPershore Abbey Church. However this might be, William Bell was one of\r\nNature's gentlemen, and it was apparent in a variety of ways in his\r\ndaily life.\r\n\r\nShortly before my coming to Aldington he had received a legacy of\r\n£150, which, without any legal necessity or outside suggestion, he had\r\nin fairness, as he considered it, divided equally between his brother,\r\nhis sister and himself--each--and his share was on deposit at a bank.\r\nSeeing that I was young--I was then twenty-two--and imagining that\r\nsome additional capital would be useful after all my outlay in\r\nstocking the farm and furnishing the house, he, greatly to my surprise\r\nand delight, offered in a little speech of much delicacy to lend me\r\nhis £50. I was immensely touched at such a practical mark of sympathy\r\nand confidence, but was able to assure him gratefully that, for the\r\npresent at any rate, I could manage without it. On another occasion,\r\nafter a bad season, he voluntarily asked me to reduce his wages, to\r\nwhich of course I did not see my way to agree.\r\n\r\nBell was always ready with a smart reply to anyone inclined to rally\r\nhim, or whom he thought inclined to do so; but his method was\r\ninoffensive, though from most men it would have appeared impertinent.\r\nIn the very earliest days of my occupation the weather was so dry for\r\nthe time of year--October and November--that fallowing operations,\r\ngenerally only possible in summer, could be successfully carried on, a\r\nvery unusual circumstance on such wet and heavy land. Meeting the\r\nVicar, a genial soul with a pleasant word for everyone, the latter\r\nremarked that it was \"rare weather for the new farmers.\" Bell, highly\r\nsensitive, fancied he scented a quizzing reference to himself and to\r\nme, and knowing that the Vicar's own land--he was then farming the\r\nglebe with a somewhat unskilful bailiff--was getting out of hand,\r\nreplied: \"Yes, sir; and not so bad for some of the old uns.\" Bell\r\nhappened to pass one day when I was talking to the Vicar at my gate.\r\n\"Hullo! Bell,\" said he, \"hard at work as usual; nothing like hard\r\nwork, is there?\" \"No, sir,\" said Bell; \"I suppose that's why you chose\r\nthe one-day-a-week job!\"\r\n\r\nLabourers have great contempt for the work of parsons, lawyers, and\r\nindoor workers generally; a farmer who spends much time indoors over\r\ncorrespondence and comes round his land late in the day is regarded as\r\nan \"afternoon\" or \"armchair\" farmer, and a tradesman who runs a small\r\nfarm in addition to his other business is an \"apron-string\" farmer.\r\nWith some hours daily employed on letter-writing, accounts and labour\r\nrecords, which a farm and the employment of many hands entails, and\r\nwith frequent calls from buyers and sellers, I was sometimes unable to\r\nvisit men working on distant fields until twelve o'clock or after, and\r\nI was told that it had been said of me by some new hands, \"why don't\r\n'e come out and do some on it?\"\r\n\r\nIt was remarked of the late tenant, \"I reckon there was a good parson\r\nspoiled when 'e was made a farmer.\" And of a lawyer, who combined\r\nlegal practice with the hobby of a small farm, that there was no doubt\r\nthat \"Lawyer G----s kept farmer G----s.\"\r\n\r\nBell's favourite saying was, \"If a job _has_ to be done you may as\r\nwell do it first as last,\" and it was so strongly impressed upon me by\r\nhis example that I think I have been under its influence, more or\r\nless, all my life. He was certain to be to the fore in any emergency\r\nwhen promptitude, courage, and resource were called for; he it was who\r\ndashed into the pool below the mill and rescued a child, and when I\r\nasked if he had no sense of the danger simply said that he never\r\nthought about it. It was Bell who tackled a savage bull which, by a\r\nmistaken order, was loose in the yard, and which, in the exuberance of\r\nunwonted liberty, had smashed up two cow-cribs, and was beginning the\r\ndestruction of a pair of new barn doors, left open, and offering\r\ntemptation for further activity. The bull, secured under Bell's\r\nleadership and manacled with a cart-rope, was induced to return to its\r\nhome in peace. When felling a tall poplar overhanging the mill-pond,\r\nit was necessary to secure the tree with a rope fixed high up the\r\ntrunk and with a stout stake driven into the meadow, to prevent the\r\ntree falling into the pond. Bell was the volunteer who climbed the\r\ntree with one end of the rope tied round his body and fixed it in\r\nposition. He was always ready to undertake any specially difficult,\r\ndirty, or hazardous duty, and in giving orders it was never \"Go and do\r\nit,\" but \"Come on, let's do it.\" An example of this sort was not lost\r\nupon the men; they could never say they were set to work that nobody\r\nelse would do, and their willing service acknowledged his tact.\r\n\r\nOne day a widow tenant asked me to read the will at the funeral of an\r\nold woman lying dead at the cottage next her own. I consented, and\r\nreached the cottage at the appointed time. It was the custom among the\r\nvillagers, when there was a will, to read it before, not after, the\r\nceremony, as, I believe, is the usual course. I found the coffin in\r\nthe living-room and the funeral party assembled, and the will, on a\r\nsheet of notepaper, signed and witnessed in legal form, was put into\r\nmy hands. Looking it through, I could see that there would be trouble,\r\nas all the money and effects were left to one person to the exclusion\r\nof the other members of the family, all of whom were present. It was\r\nquite simply expressed, and, after reading it slowly, I inquired if\r\nthey all understood its provisions. \"Oh yes,\" they understood it \"well\r\nenough.\" I could see that the tone of the reply suggested some kind of\r\nreservation; I asked if I could do anything more for them. The reply\r\nwas, \"No,\" with their grateful thanks for my attendance; so, not being\r\nexpected to accompany the funeral, I retired. I was no sooner gone\r\nthan the trouble I had anticipated began, and the disappointed\r\nrelatives expressed their disapproval of the terms of the will, some\r\ngoing so far as to decline to remain for the ceremony. Bell was not\r\namong the guests or the bearers, but, hearing raised voices at the\r\ncottage and guessing the cause, he boldly went to the spot, and in a\r\nfew moments had, with the approval of the sole legatee, arranged an\r\nequal division of the money and goods; whereupon the whole party\r\nproceeded in procession to the church. I think no one else in the\r\nvillage could so easily have persuaded the favoured individual to\r\nforgo the legal claim; but Bell was no ordinary man, and his simple\r\nsincerity of purpose was so apparent, that his influence was not to be\r\nresisted. Later in the evening a plain, but very useful, old oak chest\r\nwas sent to me, when the division of the furniture was arranged, as an\r\nacknowledgment of my services and in recognition of the saving of a\r\nlawyer's attendance and fee, with the thanks of the persons concerned.\r\nI was loath to accept it, but it was of course impossible to refuse\r\nsuch a delicate attention.\r\n\r\nBell's cheerfulness and his habit of making light of difficulties were\r\nvery contagious. I had early recognized the seriousness of the problem\r\npresented by the foul condition of the land, but, as we gradually\r\nbegan to reduce it to better order, I remarked that the prospect was\r\nnot so alarming after all. His reply was that when once the land was\r\nclean, and in regular cropping, \"a man might farm it with all the\r\nplaysure in life.\"\r\n\r\nThough no \"scholard,\" his wonderful memory stood him in good stead,\r\nand was most valuable to me. He came in for a talk every evening, to\r\nreport the events of the day and arrange the work for the morrow.\r\nAfter a long day spent with one of the carters delivering such things\r\nas faggots--locally \"kids\"--of wood, he would recall the names of the\r\nrecipients, and the exact quantities delivered at each house without\r\nthe slightest effort. His only memoranda for approximate land\r\nmeasurements would be produced on a stick with a notch denoting each\r\nscore yards or paces. This primitive method is particularly\r\ninteresting, the numeral a _score_ being derived from the Anglo-Saxon\r\n_sciran_, to divide. Similar words are plough _share, shire, shears_,\r\nand _shard_. He could keep the daily labour record when I was away\r\nfrom home; but though I could always decipher his writing, he found it\r\ndifficult to read himself. A letter was a sore trial, and he often\r\ntold me that he would sooner walk to \"Broddy\" (Broadway) and back, ten\r\nor eleven miles, than write to the veterinary surgeon there, whose\r\nservices we sometimes required.\r\n\r\nWe had a simple method of disposing of small pigs; it was an\r\nunderstood thing that no pig was to be sold for less than a pound. I\r\nhad a good breed, always in demand by the cottagers, who never failed\r\nto apply, sometimes, perhaps, before the pound size was quite reached,\r\nas it was a case of first come first served, and there was the danger\r\nthat the best would be snapped up before an intending buyer could have\r\nhis choice. Bell's face was wreathed in smiles when he came in and\r\nunloaded a pocketful of sovereigns on my study table, saying, when\r\ntrade was brisk, \"I could sell myself if I was little pigs!\"\r\n\r\nMany and anxious were the deliberations we held in the early days of\r\nmy farming; the whole system of the late tenant was condemned by my\r\ntheoretical and Bell's practical knowledge, but they did not\r\ninvariably coincide, and, after a long discussion on some particular\r\npoint, he would yield, though I could see that he was not convinced,\r\nwith, \"Well, I allows you to know best.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, a few years later, I introduced hop-growing as a complete\r\nnovelty on the farm, he regarded it at first as an extravagant and\r\nunprofitable hobby, akin to the hunters my predecessor kept. He\r\n\"reckoned,\" he said, that my hop-gardens were my \"hunting horse,\" and\r\nI heard that my neighbours quoted the old saw about \"a fool and his\r\nmoney.\" Bell was not so enlightened as to be quite proof against local\r\nsuperstitions; I had to consult his almanac and find out when the\r\n\"moon southed,\" and when certain planets were in favourable\r\nconjunction, before he would undertake some quite ordinary farm\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nHe was a clever and courageous bee-master, and \"took\" all my\r\nneighbours' swarms as well as my own, my gardener not being _persona\r\ngrata_ to bees. The job is not a popular one, and he would, when\r\naccompanied by the owner, always ask, \"Will you hold the ladder or\r\nhive 'em?\" The invariable answer was, \"Hold the ladder.\" He firmly\r\nbelieved in the necessity of telling the bees in cases where the owner\r\nhad died, the superstition being that unless the hive was tapped after\r\ndark, when all were at home, and a set form of announcement repeated,\r\nthe bees would desert their quarters. I had an alarming experience\r\nonce with bees when cycling between Ringwood and Burley in the New\r\nForest, my present home. As I passed a house close to the road, a\r\nswarm crossed my path, rising from their hive just as I reached the\r\nhedge before the garden. There was a mighty humming, and I felt the\r\nbees, with which I was colliding, striking my hands and face with some\r\nviolence. I expected a sting each moment, but my greatest fear was\r\nlest the queen should have settled on my coat amongst the bees it had\r\ncollected, and that presently I should have the whole swarm in\r\npossession. It was dangerous to stop, so I raced on some distance,\r\ndismounted, discarded my coat, shaking off my unwelcome\r\nfellow-travellers, and I was much surprised to find that none of them\r\nretaliated.\r\n\r\nBell was an excellent brewer, and with good malt and some of our own\r\nhops could produce a nice light bitter beer at a very moderate cost.\r\nIn years when cider was scarce we supplemented the men's short\r\nallowance with beer, 4 bushels of malt to 100 gallons; and for years\r\nhe brewed a superior drink for the household, which, consumed in much\r\nsmaller quantities and requiring to be kept longer, was double the\r\nstrength. His methods were not scientific, and he scorned the use of a\r\n\"theometer,\" his rule being that the hot water was cool enough for the\r\naddition of the malt when the steam was sufficiently gone off to allow\r\nhim \"to see his face\" on the surface.\r\n\r\nOwing to his having lived so long in such a quiet place, and the\r\nlimited outlook which his surroundings had so far afforded, Bell was\r\nsomewhat wanting in the sense of proportion, and when I had a field of\r\n10 acres planted with potatoes, he told me quite seriously that he\r\ndoubted if the crop could ever be sold, as he didn't think there were\r\nenough people in the country to eat them! I remember a parallel\r\nincident at the first auction sale of stock ever held at Chipping\r\nCampden, a lovely old town and, for centuries now long past, a leading\r\ncentre of the Cotswold wool trade. The pens, in the wide spaces\r\nbetween the road and the footways, were, as I stood watching, rapidly\r\nfilling with fat sheep, and, I suppose, the scene being so novel and\r\nso animated, the interest of the inhabitants was greatly excited, as\r\nthey stood in little groups at the house doors looking on. I heard an\r\nancient dame marvelling at the numbers of sheep collected--probably\r\nonly 1,000 or 1,200 all told--and expressing her certainty of the\r\nimpossibility of rinding mouths enough to consume such a mass of\r\nmutton. As a matter of fact, there were, I suppose, four or five large\r\ndealers present, any one of whom would have bought every sheep, could\r\nhe have seen a fair chance of a possible profit of threepence a head;\r\nto say nothing of innumerable smaller dealers and retail butchers,\r\ngood for a score or two apiece. What I may call the parochial horizon\r\nis well illustrated, too, by the announcement of a domestic economist:\r\n\"Farmer Jones lost two calves last week; I reckon we shall have beef a\r\nlot dearer.\" And again by the recommendation of a shrewd and ancient\r\nhusbandman of my acquaintance that it was desirable for any young\r\nfarmer to get away from home and visit the county town sometimes, at\r\nany rate on market days, and attend the \"ordinary\" dinner, even if it\r\ncost him a few shillings--\"for there,\" he added, \"you med stick and\r\nstick and stick at home until you knows nothin' at all.\" Shakespeare\r\nputs the matter more tersely, if less forcibly, \"Home-keeping youth\r\nhave ever homely wits.\" I cannot forbear, too, the temptation to\r\nrecall _Punch's_ picture at the time of King George's coronation. The\r\nscene depicted two rustics gossiping at the parish pump, as to the\r\nforthcoming village festivities, and the squire's carriage with the\r\nsquire and his family, followed by the luggage cart, on their way to\r\nthe railway station:\r\n\r\n_First Rustic_. Where be them folks a-goin' to; I wonder?\r\n\r\n_Second Rustic_. Off to Lunnon, I reckon, but they'll be back for the\r\nCor-o-nation.\r\n\r\nSoon after the reopening of the church I overtook Bell as we were\r\nreturning from Sunday morning service. It was a dark day, and the\r\npulpit, having been moved from the south to the north side of the\r\nnave--farther from the windows--the clerk lighted the desk candles\r\nbefore the Vicar began his sermon. I asked Bell how he liked the\r\nservice, referring to the new choir and music; he hesitated, not\r\nwanting, as I was the Vicar's churchwarden, to appear critical, but\r\nbeing too conscientious to disguise his feelings. I could see that he\r\nwas troubled, and asked what was the matter. Then it came out; it was\r\n\"them candles!\" which he took to be part of the ritual, and he added,\r\n\"But you ain't a-goin' to make a Papist of me!\"\r\n\r\nBell was proof against attempted bribery, and often came chuckling to\r\nme over his refusals of dishonest proposals. A man from whom I used to\r\nbuy large quantities of hop-poles required some withy \"bonds\" for\r\ntying faggots; they are sold at a price per bundle of 100, and the\r\napplicant suggested that 120 should be placed in each bundle. Bell was\r\nto receive a recognition for his complicity in the fraud, and he\r\nagreed on condition that in my next deal for hop-poles 100 should be\r\nrepresented by 120 in like manner. The bargain did not materialize.\r\n\r\nI found Bell a very amusing companion in walks and excursions we took\r\nto fairs and sales for the purchase of stock. He knew the histories\r\nand peculiarities of all the farmers and country people whose land or\r\nhouses we passed, and his stories made the miles very short. I often\r\nhelped with driving sheep and cattle home, and their persistence in\r\ntaking all the wrong turnings or in doubling back was surprising; but\r\ntwo drovers are much more efficient than one, and we got to know\r\nexactly where they would need circumventing. When we visited a town I\r\nalways took him to an inn or restaurant and gave him a good dinner.\r\nVisiting what was then a much-frequented dining-place--Mountford's, at\r\nWorcester, near the cathedral--we sat next to a well-known hon. and\r\nrev. scholar of eccentric habits. He would read abstractedly,\r\nforgetting his food for several minutes, then suddenly would make a\r\nnoisy dash for knife and fork, resuming the meal with great energy for\r\na while, and as suddenly relinquish the implements and return to his\r\nreading, and so on continuously. I noticed Bell watching with great\r\nsurprise, much shocked at such unusual table manners, and presently he\r\ncould not forbear very gently nudging my elbow to draw my attention to\r\nthe performance.\r\n\r\nMountford's was celebrated for succulent veal cutlets with fried bacon\r\nand tomato sauce, also for Severn salmon and lamperns; visitors to the\r\ncathedral and china works generally refreshed themselves there, and it\r\nwas amusing to watch their exhausted and grim looks when entering and\r\nwaiting, in comparison with their beaming smiles when confessing their\r\nindulgences on leaving; for no bills were rendered, and guests were\r\ntrusted to remember the details consumed. You will always find the\r\nbest eating-houses near the cathedrals; vergers' recitals are apt to\r\nbe long-winded, and visitors require speedy refreshment after a\r\ncomplete round.\r\n\r\nIt was a popular village belief that bad luck follows if a woman was\r\nthe first to enter a house on Christmas morning, and Bell always made\r\na point of being the first over my threshold, shouting loudly his\r\ngreetings up the staircase.\r\n\r\nBell's wife survived him, living on in the same cottage in which he\r\nwas born and had passed his life. She was a hard-working woman, and\r\ncame over to my house once a week for some years to bake the bread,\r\nmade from my own wheat ground at the village mill. It was somewhat\r\ndark in colour, owing to the most nutritious parts of the grain being\r\nretained in the flour, but it was deliciously sweet and kept fresh for\r\nthe whole week. I only wish everyone could enjoy the same sort; the\r\nmodern bread is poor stuff by comparison, and its lack of nutritive\r\nvalue is undoubtedly the cause of much of the poor physique of our\r\nrural and urban population at the present time.\r\n\r\nI had a very human dog, Viper, partly fox-terrier; though not very\r\n\"well bred,\" his manners were unexceptionable and his cleverness\r\nextraordinary. One summer afternoon Mrs. Bell was greatly surprised by\r\nViper coming to her house much distressed and trying to tell her the\r\nreason; he was not to be put off or comforted, and, seizing her\r\nskirts, he dragged her to the door and outside. She guessed at once\r\nthat her two boys were in some danger, and she followed the dog. He\r\nkept turning round to make sure that she was close behind, and led her\r\ndown a lane, for perhaps 300 yards, to a gate leading into a 12-acre\r\npasture. They pursued the footpath across the field, through another\r\ngate and over the bridge which spanned the brook, into a meadow\r\nbeyond. There she found the children in fear of their lives from the\r\nantics of two mischievous colts which were capering round them with\r\nmany snorts and much upturning of heels. It was really only play, but\r\nthe boys were alarmed, and Viper, who had accompanied them, had\r\nevidently concluded that they were in danger.\r\n\r\nBefore the days of the safety bicycle an excellent tricycle, called\r\nthe \"omnicycle,\" was put on the market; and the villagers were greatly\r\nexcited over one I purchased, of course only for road work, expecting\r\nme to use it on my farming rounds; and Mrs. Bell was heard to say, \"I\r\nknows I shall laugh when I sees the master a-coming round the farm on\r\nthat thing.\"\r\n\r\nBell always spoke of her as \"my 'ooman,\" and, referring to the\r\ndepletion of their exchequer on her returns from marketing in Evesham,\r\noften said, \"I don't care who robs my 'ooman this side of the elm\"--a\r\nnotable tree about halfway between the town and the village--knowing\r\nthat she would then have very little change left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOP FOREMAN AND THE HOP DRIER.\r\n\r\n     \"Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield,\r\n\r\n       *      *      *       *      *\r\n\r\n     How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke.\"\r\n                                                     --GRAY'S _Elegy_.\r\n\r\n\r\nJarge was one of the most prominent characters among my men. He was\r\nnot a native of the Vale, coming from the Lynches, a hilly district to\r\nthe north of Evesham. He was a sturdy and very excellent workman. He\r\ndid with his might whatsoever his hand found to do, and everything he\r\nundertook was a success. The beautifully trimmed hedge in front of his\r\ncottage-garden proclaimed his method and love of order at a glance.\r\nJarge was a wag; he was the man who, like Shakespeare's clowns,\r\nstepped on to the stage at the critical moment and saved a serious\r\nsituation with a quaint or epigrammatic expression.\r\n\r\nHe was very scornful of the condition of the farm when I came, and it\r\nwas he, whose reply to the late tenant that his arable land would soon\r\nbe all grass, I have already quoted. In speaking to me, at almost our\r\nfirst interview, he could not refrain from an allusion to the foulness\r\nof the land; some peewits were circling over those neglected fields,\r\nand it was far from reassuring to be told--though he did not intend to\r\ndiscourage me--that \"folks say, when you sees them things on the land,\r\nthe farm's broke!\"\r\n\r\nFrom the natural history point of view he was perfectly correct, as\r\npeewits generally frequent wild and uncultivated places where the\r\nploughman and the labourer are rarely seen.\r\n\r\nOwing to the somewhat unconvincing fact of his wife's brother being a\r\ngamekeeper on the Marquis's estate near Jarge's native village, he had\r\nacquired, and retained through all the years of my farming, a sporting\r\nreputation; he was always the man selected for trapping any evil beast\r\nor bird that might be worrying us; and when the cherries were\r\nbeginning to show ruddy complexions in the sunshine, and the starlings\r\nand blackbirds were becoming troublesome, armed with an old\r\nmuzzle-loader of mine, he made incessant warfare against them, and his\r\ngun could be heard as early as five o'clock in the morning, while the\r\nshots would often come pattering down harmlessly on my greenhouse.\r\nThere came a time when some thieving carrion crows were robbing my\r\nhalf-tame wild duck's nests of their eggs, and Jarge was, of course,\r\ndetailed to tackle them. Weeks elapsed without any result; the\r\ndepredations continued, and the men began to chaff him; finally Bell\r\n\"put the lid on,\" as people say nowadays, by the following sally: \"Ah,\r\nJarge, if ever thee catches a craw 'twill be one as was hatched from\r\nan addled egg!\"\r\n\r\nFor weeks before harvest Jarge patrolled my wheatfields, crowds of\r\nsparrows rising and dispersing for a time after every shot, only, I\r\nfear, to foregather again very soon on another field, perhaps half a\r\nmile distant. No doubt he sent some to my neighbours in return for\r\nthose which they sent to me.\r\n\r\nJarge was an instance of superior descent; his surname was that of an\r\nancient and prominent county family in former days; he carried himself\r\nwith dignity and was generally respected; he possessed the power of\r\nvery minute observation, and was of all others the man to find coins\r\nor other small leavings of Roman and former occupiers of my land. His\r\neldest daughter was a charming girl, and, when Jarge became a widower,\r\nshe made a most efficient mistress of his household. She showed, too,\r\nquite unmistakably her descent from distinguished ancestry. Tall,\r\nclear-complexioned, graceful, dignified, and rather serious, but with\r\na sweet smile, she was a daughter of whom any man might have been\r\nproud. To my thinking, she was the belle of the village, and she made\r\na very pretty picture in her sun-bonnet, among the green and golden\r\ntracery of the hop-bine in the hopping season accompanied by the\r\nsmaller members of the family. At the \"crib\" into which the hops are\r\npicked, many bushels proved their industry, and there were no leaves\r\nor rubbish to call for rebuke at the midday and evening measurings.\r\n\r\nI selected Jarge for foreman of the hop-picking as a most responsible\r\nand trustworthy man; it was then that his sense of humour was most\r\nconspicuous, a very important and valuable trait when 300 women and\r\nchildren, and the men who supplied them with hops on the poles, have\r\nto be kept cheerful and good-tempered every day and all day for three\r\nweeks or a month, sometimes under trying conditions. For though\r\nhop-picking is a fascinating occupation when the sun shines and the\r\nsky is blue, it is otherwise when the mornings are damp or the hops\r\ndripping with dew, and when heavy thunder-rains have left the ground\r\nwet and cold.\r\n\r\nHe had a cheery word for all who were working steadily, and a\r\nsemi-sarcastic remark for the careless and unmethodical; a keen eye\r\nfor hops wasted and trodden into the ground, or for poles of\r\nundersized hops, unwelcome to the pickers and hidden beneath those\r\nfrom which the hops had been picked. He acted as buffer between\r\ncapital and labour, smoothing troubles over, telling me of the\r\npickers' difficulties, and explaining my side to the pickers when the\r\nquality was poor and prices discouraging, so that the work went with a\r\nswing and with happy faces and good-humoured chaff.\r\n\r\nI was always pleased to hear the pickers singing, for I knew then that\r\nall was well. Sometimes, after a trying day, when Jarge had been\r\ncalled upon to expostulate, or \"to talk\" more than usual, the corners\r\nof his mouth would take a downward turn, and he complained, perhaps,\r\nof gipsies or tramps whom I was obliged to employ when the crop was\r\nheavy, though they were kept in a gang apart from the villagers; but\r\nhe always came up happy again next morning, the mouth corners tending\r\nupwards, and his broad and beaming smile with a radiance like the\r\nrising sun on a midsummer morning.\r\n\r\nJarge was a man of discrimination. When we were forced to inaugurate a\r\nSchool Board on account of the growing difficulty, owing to the bad\r\ntimes, of collecting voluntary subscriptions, all the old school\r\nmanagers, including my second Vicar--I served under three Vicars as\r\nchurch-warden--refused to join the Board. Jarge, who was much\r\nexercised in his mind as to the possibility of future bad management,\r\ncame to me, and referring to a proposal to place working-men on the\r\nBoard, said: \"We wants men like you, sir, for members; what's the good\r\nof sending we dunderyeads there?\"\r\n\r\nGoing round the farm on his daughter's wedding-day, I was surprised to\r\nfind him at work; and when I asked him why he was not at the ceremony,\r\n\"Well,\" he replied, \"I don't think much of weddings--the fittel\r\n(victuals) ain't good enough; give me a jolly good fu-ner-ral!\"\r\n\r\nJarge wore a brown velveteen coat on high-days and holidays by virtue\r\nof his sporting reputation, and looked exceedingly smart with special\r\ncorduroy breeches and gaiters and a wide-awake felt hat. He was much\r\nannoyed in Birmingham, whither I had sent all the men to an\r\nagricultural show, at hearing a man say to a companion, \"There's\r\nanother of them Country Johnnies.\" When I told him what a swell he\r\nlooked, he replied somewhat ruefully, \"No! that's what I never could\r\nbe,\" as though he felt that his appearance was disappointingly rustic.\r\n\r\nThough a most industrious man, he had dreams of the enjoyment of\r\ncomplete leisure; he told me that if ever he possessed as much as\r\nfifty pounds he would never do another day's work as long as he lived.\r\nI answered that when that ideal was reached he would postpone his\r\nprojected ease until he had made it a hundred, and so on ad infinitum;\r\nand this proved a correct forecast, for in time, by the aid of a\r\nwell-managed allotment and regular wages, he saved a good bit of\r\nmoney. When I sold my fruit crops by auction, on the trees, for the\r\nbuyers to pick, just before I gave up my land, as I should not be\r\npresent to harvest the late apples and cider fruit after Michaelmas,\r\nhe came forward with a bid of one hundred pounds for one of the\r\norchards, though it was sold eventually for a higher price.\r\n\r\nHe was not well versed in finance, however, for when the owner of his\r\ncottage offered, at his request, to build a new pigsty if he would pay\r\na rent of 5 per cent, annually on the cost--a very fair\r\nproposal--Jarge declined with scorn, being, I think, under the\r\nimpression that the owner was demanding the complete sum of five\r\npounds annually, and I found it impossible to disabuse his mind of the\r\nidea. He felt aggrieved also by the fact that, having paid rent for\r\ntwenty-five or thirty years, he was no nearer ownership of his cottage\r\nthan when he began. His argument was that, as he had paid more than\r\nthe value of the cottage, it should be his property; the details of\r\ninterest on capital and all rates and repairs paid by the owner did\r\nnot appeal to him.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a concert at Malvern, which my wife and her sister\r\norganized for the benefit of our church restoration fund, I gave all\r\nmy men a holiday, and sent them off by train at an early hour; they\r\nwere to climb the Worcestershire Beacon--the highest point of the\r\nMalvern range--in the morning, and attend the concert in the\r\nafternoon. It was a lovely day, and the programme was duly carried\r\nout. Next morning I found Jarge and another man, who had been detailed\r\nfor the day's work to sow nitrate of soda on a distant wheat-field,\r\nsitting peacefully under the hedge; they told me that the excitement\r\nand the climb had completely tired them out, but that they would stop\r\nand complete the job, no matter how late at night that might be. It\r\nwas the hill-climbing, I think, that had brought into play muscles not\r\ngenerally used in our flat country. I sympathized, and left them\r\nresting, but the work was honourably concluded before they left the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nWhen there was illness in Jarge's house and somebody told him that the\r\ndoctor had been seen leaving, he answered that he \"Would sooner see\r\nthe butcher there any day\"--not, perhaps, a very happy expression in\r\nthe circumstances, but intended to convey that a butcher's bill, for\r\ngood meat supplied, was more satisfactory than a doctor's account,\r\nwhich represented nothing in the way of commissariat.\r\n\r\nAmong the annual trips to which I treated my men, I sent them for a\r\nlong summer day to London, and one of my pupils kindly volunteered to\r\nact as conductor to the sights. They had a very successful day, and\r\nthe principal streets and shows were visited; among the latter the\r\nGreat Wheel, then very popular, was the one that seemed to interest\r\nthem most.\r\n\r\nNext morning some of the travellers were hoeing beans in one of my\r\nfields; I interviewed them on my round, and inquired what they thought\r\nof London. They had much enjoyed the day, and were greatly struck by\r\nthe fact that the barmaid, at the place where they had eaten the lunch\r\nthey took with them, had recognized them as \"Oostershire men\"; they\r\nhad demanded their beer in three or four quart jugs, which could be\r\nhanded round so that each man could take a pull in turn, instead of\r\nthe usual fashion of separate glasses, and it appeared that this\r\nindicated the locality from whence they came. Probably she had noticed\r\ntheir accent, and, being a native of Worcestershire, remembered their\r\nintimate drinking custom as a county peculiarity. The men proceeded to\r\ndescribe the sights of London, and one of them added that there was\r\none thing they could not find there, stopping suddenly in some\r\nconfusion. I pressed him to explain. He still hesitated, and, turning\r\nto the others, said: \"_You_ tell the master, Bill.\" Bill was not so\r\ndiffident. \"Well,\" he said, \"we couldn't see a good-looking 'ooman in\r\nLunnon; for Jarge here, 'e was judge over 'em for a bit, and then Tom\r\n'e took it, nor 'e couldn't see one neither!\"\r\n\r\nJarge was somewhat of a _bon vivant_, and much appreciated my annual\r\npresent of a piece of Christmas beef. When thanking me and descanting\r\nupon its tenderness and acceptability, on one occasion, he continued,\r\n\"It ain't like the sort of biff we folks has to put up with, that\r\ntough you has to set in the middle of the room at dinner, for fear you\r\nmight daish your brains out agen the wall a-tuggin' at it with your\r\nteeth!\"\r\n\r\nJarge had one song and only one that I ever heard, and he was always\r\ncalled upon for it at harvest suppers and other jollifications; it was\r\nnot a classic, but he rendered it with characteristic drollery, and\r\nalways brought down the house. I conclude my sketch of him by\r\nmentioning it because it is almost my last impression of his vivid\r\npersonality, trotted out with great energy at my farewell supper, a\r\nday or two before I left Aldington.\r\n\r\nAmong the men who were bequeathed to me, so to speak, by my\r\npredecessor, Tom was one of whom I always had a high opinion. Tall,\r\nvigorous, and well made, one recognized at once his possibilities as a\r\nvaluable man. He was somewhat cautious, taciturn, very sensitive and\r\nreserved, but would open out in conversation when alone with me. As\r\nquite a young man he had worked at the building of the branch line\r\nfrom Oxford to Wolverhampton, via Worcester, the \"O.W. and W.,\" or\r\n\"Old Wusser and Wusser,\" as it was called, until taken over by the\r\nGreat Western Railway. The latter, extending from London to Oxford,\r\nwas, I believe, one of Brunell's masterly conceptions, being without a\r\ntunnel the whole way. But the new line had to pierce the Cotswolds\r\nbefore reaching the Vale of Evesham, and Tom had many yarns about the\r\nconstruction of the long Mickleton tunnel. Among them was a tradition\r\nof the cost, so great that guineas laid edgeways throughout its length\r\nwould not pay for it.\r\n\r\nIn my time there was a splendid service of express trains running from\r\nLondon to Worcester without a stop, and coming downhill into the Vale,\r\nthrough the tunnel and towards Evesham, the speed approximated to a\r\nmile a minute. I was talking to one of my men, a hedger, working near\r\nthe line which bounded a portion of my land, when one of the express\r\ntrains came dashing along and passed us with a roar in a few seconds.\r\n\"My word,\" said he, \"I reckon that's a co-rider.\" I was puzzled, but\r\npresently it came to me that he meant \"corridor\"; he had probably seen\r\nthe word in the local paper without having heard it pronounced.\r\n\r\nIt was a treat to watch Tom's magnificent physique when felling a big\r\ntree, stripped to his shirt, with sleeves rolled up, and his gleaming\r\naxe slowly raised and poised for a second above him before it fell\r\nwith the gathered impetus of its own weight and his powerful stress.\r\nBiting time after time into the exact place aimed at, and at the most\r\neffective angle possible, the clean chips would fly in all directions\r\nuntil the necessary notch was cut and the basal outgrowths, close to\r\nthe ground around the sturdy column, were reduced, so that the\r\ncross-cut saw could complete its downfall with a mighty crash. There\r\nis always something sad about the felling of an ancient tree; one\r\nfeels it is a venerable creature that has passed long years of\r\nunchallenged dominion on the spot occupied, and one can scarcely avoid\r\nan idea of its intelligence and its silent record of passing\r\ngenerations, who have welcomed its shade at blazing summer noontides,\r\nor crept close to its warm touch for shelter from the winter's\r\nchilling blast and the hissing hail.\r\n\r\nTom was always the leader of my team of mowers when the grass was cut,\r\nfor, with the large staff I employed on purpose for the all-important\r\nhop-gardens, I never wanted, till towards the end of my time, to make\r\nuse of a machine. The steady swing of his scythe, with scarcely an\r\napparent effort, the swish, as the swathe fell beneath its keen edge,\r\nand the final lift of the severed grasses at the end of the stroke,\r\nall in regular rhythmic action, were very fascinating to watch. At\r\nintervals came a halt for \"whetting\" the blade, and the musical sound\r\nof rubber (sharpening stone) against steel, equally adroitly\r\naccomplished, proved the artist at his work, with a delicacy of touch\r\nwhich, perhaps in different circumstances, might have produced the\r\nthrills with which Pachmann's velvet caress or Paderewski's refined\r\nexpression enchant a vast and rapturous audience.\r\n\r\nAs a land-drainer, too, I loved to watch him standing in the slippery\r\ntrench, with not an inch more soil moved than was necessary, lifting\r\nout the decreasing \"draws,\" and leaving a bottom nicely rounded\r\nexactly to fit the pipes, and finally the methodical adjustment of\r\neach pipe, with the concluding tap to bring it close to the last one\r\nlaid. Draining is an art which taxes the ability of the best of men,\r\nfor it must be remembered that, like the links of a chain, its\r\nefficiency is no greater than that of its weakest part.\r\n\r\nWhen I had to arrange for the harvesting of my first hop crop, it was\r\nnecessary to find a man who could be entrusted with the critical work\r\nof drying the hops, and Tom was the man I chose. I had my kiln ready,\r\nconstructed in an old malthouse, on the latest principles, and in time\r\nfor the first crop. The kiln consisted of a space about 20 feet\r\nsquare, walled off at one end of the old building, but with entrances\r\non the ground and first floors. Beneath, in the lower compartment, was\r\nthe fireplace, a yard square, and 16 feet above was the floor on which\r\nthe hops were dried. Anthracite coal was used for fuel, the fire being\r\nmaintained day and night throughout the picking--the morning's picking\r\ndrying between 1 p.m. and 12 midnight, and the afternoon's picking\r\nbetween 1 a.m. and 12 o'clock noon. Tom was therefore on duty for the\r\nwhole twenty-four hours, with what snatches of sleep he could catch in\r\nthe initial stage of each drying and at odd moments.\r\n\r\nThe process requires great skill and attention; at first he and I,\r\nwith what little knowledge I had, puzzled it out together, he having\r\nhad no previous experience, and night after night I sat up with him\r\ntill the load came off the kiln at midnight. A slight excess of heat,\r\nor an irregular application of it, will spoil the hops, the principle\r\nbeing to raise the temperature, very gradually at first, to 30 or 40\r\ndegrees higher at the finish. Hops should be _blown_ dry by a blast of\r\nhot air, not baked by heat alone. The drier, of course, has to keep a\r\nwatchful eye on the thermometer on the upper floor among the hops--Tom\r\nalways called it the \"theometer\"--regulating his fire accordingly and\r\nthe admission of cold air through adjustable ventilators on the\r\noutside walls. This regulation varies according to the weather, the\r\nmoisture of the air, and the condition of the hops, and calls for\r\ncritical judgment and accuracy. Often, tired out with the previous\r\nordinary day's work, we had much ado to keep awake at night, and it\r\nwas fatal to arrange a too comfortable position with the warmth of the\r\nglowing fire and the soporific scent of the hops. Then Tom would\r\nannounce that it was \"time to get them little props out,\" which, in\r\nimagination, were to support our wearied eyelids.\r\n\r\nWhen we decided that the hops were ready to be cooled down, to prevent\r\nbreaking when being taken off the drying floor, all doors, windows,\r\nand ventilators were thrown open and the fire banked up, and, while\r\nthey were cooling, he went to neighbouring cottages to rouse the men\r\nwho came nightly to unload and reload the kiln, and then I could\r\nretire to bed.\r\n\r\nTom was devoted to duty, and was so successful as a hop-drier that he\r\nsoon became capable of managing two more kilns in the same building,\r\nwhich I enlarged as I gradually increased my acreage. In a good season\r\nhe would often have £100 worth of hops through his hands in the\r\ntwenty-four hours, sometimes more. He was the only man I ever employed\r\nat this particular work, and throughout those years he turned out hops\r\nto the value of nearly £30,000 without a single mishap or spoiled\r\nkiln-load--a better proof of his devotion to duty than anything else I\r\ncould say.\r\n\r\nHe was a very picturesque figure when, \"crowned with the sickle and\r\nthe wheaten sheaf, Autumn comes jovial on,\" and he was cutting wheat,\r\nhis head covered with a coloured handkerchief, knotted at the corners,\r\nto protect the back of his neck from the sun, which must have been\r\nmuch cooler than the felt hat--a kind of \"billycock\" with a flat\r\ntop--which he habitually wore. I have noticed that the labourer's\r\nstyle of hat is a matter of great conservatism, probably due to the\r\nfancy that he would \"look odd\" in any other, and would be liable to\r\nchaff from his fellow-workers.\r\n\r\nTom had a tremendous reach, and got through a big day's work in the\r\nharvest-field, but nearly always knocked himself up after two or three\r\ndays in the broiling sun, developing what he called, \"Tantiddy's fire\r\n\" in one forearm; this is the local equivalent of St. Anthony's fire,\r\nan ailment termed professionally erysipelas, but I have never heard\r\nhow it is connected with the saint.\r\n\r\nHarvesters often work in pairs, and they are then \"butties\"\r\n(partners), but not infrequently a harvester will be accompanied by\r\nhis wife or daughter to tie up the sheaves; and their active figures\r\namong the golden corn, backed by a horizon of blue sky, make a\r\ncharming picture. The mind goes back to the old Scripture references\r\nto the time of harvest, and the idea impresses itself that one is\r\nlooking at almost exactly the same scene as it appeared to the old\r\nwriters, and which they described in all the dignity of their stately\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nTom was not much given to the epigrammatic expression of his thoughts,\r\nlike some of the other men, but he had a vein of humour. A relative of\r\nhis used to come over from Evesham to sing in our church choir, and I\r\nremember a special occasion when the choir was somewhat _piano_ until\r\nthis singer's part came in; he had a strong and not very melodious\r\nvoice, and the effort and the effect alike were startling. Tom was in\r\nchurch at the time, and had evidently been watching expectantly for\r\nthe _fortissimo_ climax; he told me afterwards that \"when S. opened\r\nhis mouth I knew it was sure to come.\" It did!\r\n\r\nI have mentioned Tom's cautiousness; he had a way of assenting to a\r\nstatement without committing himself to definite agreement. I once\r\nasked him who the leaders had been in a disorderly incident, being\r\naware that he knew; I suggested the names, but the nearest approach to\r\nassent which I could extract was, \"If you spakes again you'll be\r\nwrong.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEAD CARTER--THE CARPENTER.\r\n\r\n     \"There's a right way and a wrong way to do everything, and folks\r\n       most in general chooses the wrong un.\"\r\n                                              --TOM G.\r\n\r\nJim was my first head carter, and he dearly loved a horse. He had, as\r\nthe saying is, forgotten more about horses than most men ever knew,\r\nand what he didn't know wasn't worth knowing.\r\n\r\nHe was a cheery man, and when I went to Aldington was about to be\r\nmarried. Not being much of a \"scholard,\" his first request was that I\r\nwould write out his name and that of his intended, for the publication\r\nof the banns. A group of men was standing round at the time, and I\r\nasked him how his somewhat unusual name was spelt. Seeing that he was\r\npuzzled, I hazarded a guess myself, repeating the six letters in order\r\nslowly. He was greatly surprised and pleased to recognize that my\r\nattempt was correct, and, turning to the bystanders, remarked with the\r\nutmost sincerity, \"There ain't many as could have done that, mind\r\nyou!\" I felt that my reputation for scholarship was established.\r\n\r\nJim was a fisherman, and was no representative of \"a worm at one end\r\nand a fool at the other.\" I gave him leave to fish in my brooks; he\r\nwas wily, patient, and successful, and one day brought me a nice\r\nsalmon-trout, by no means common in these streams. In thanking him, I\r\nmade him a standing offer of a shilling a pound for any more he could\r\ncatch, but he never got another. Writing of fishing, I cannot forbear\r\nquoting Thomson's lines on the subject, under \"Spring,\" the most vivid\r\ndescription of the sport I have ever read:\r\n\r\n     \"When with his lively ray the potent sun\r\n     Has pierced the streams, and roused the finny race,\r\n     Then, issuing cheerful, to thy sport repair;\r\n     Chief should the western breezes curling play,\r\n     And light o'er ether bear the shadowy clouds.\r\n     High to their fount, this day, amid the hills,\r\n     And woodlands warbling round, trace up the brooks;\r\n     The next, pursue their rocky-channel'd maze,\r\n     Down to the river, in whose ample wave\r\n     Their little naiads love to sport at large.\r\n     Just in the dubious point, where with the pool\r\n     Is mix'd the trembling stream, or where it boils\r\n     Around the stone, or from the hollow'd bank\r\n     Reverted plays in undulating flow,\r\n     There throw, nice-judging, the delusive fly;\r\n     And as you lead it round in artful curve,\r\n     With eye attentive mark the springing games\r\n     Straight as above the surface of the flood\r\n     They wanton rise, or urged by hunger leap,\r\n     Then fix, with gentle twitch, the barbed hook:\r\n     Some lightly tossing to the grassy bank,\r\n     And to the shelving shore slow-dragging some,\r\n     With various hand proportion'd to their force.\r\n     If yet too young, and easily deceived,\r\n     A worthless prey scarce bends your pliant rod,\r\n     Him, piteous of his youth and the short space\r\n     He has enjoy'd the vital light of heaven,\r\n     Soft disengage, and back into the stream\r\n     The speckled captive throw. But should you lure\r\n     From his dark haunt, beneath the tangled roots\r\n     Of pendant trees, the monarch of the brook,\r\n     Behoves you then to ply your finest art.\r\n     Long time he following cautious, scans the fly;\r\n     And oft attempts to seize it, but as oft\r\n     The dimpled water speaks his jealous fear.\r\n     At last, while haply yet the shaded sun\r\n     Passes a cloud, he desperate takes the death,\r\n     With sullen plunge. At once he darts along,\r\n     Deep-struck, and runs out all the lengthen'd line;\r\n     Then seeks the furthest ooze, the sheltering weed,\r\n     The cavern'd bank, his old secure abode;\r\n     And flies aloft, and flounces round the pool,\r\n     Indignant of the guile. With yielding hand,\r\n     That feels him still, yet to his furious course\r\n     Gives way, you, now retiring, following now\r\n     Across the stream, exhaust his idle rage:\r\n     Till floating broad upon his breathless side,\r\n     And to his fate abandon'd, to the shore\r\n     You gaily drag your unresisting prize.\"\r\n\r\nHorses were scarce and dear when I went to Aldington, and many French\r\nanimals were being imported. I got an old acquaintance in the South of\r\nEngland to send me four or five; they were all greys, useful workers,\r\nbut wanting the spirit and stamina of the English horse; and they\r\nwould always wait for the Englishman to start a heavy standing load\r\nbefore throwing their weight into the collar. Jim told me that they\r\nwere \"desperate ongain\" (very awkward), and, as foreigners, well they\r\nmight be, for I myself had some difficulty in understanding the local\r\nwords of command, more especially in ploughing, when, with a team of\r\nfour, he shouted his orders, addressing the new horses by names with\r\nwhich they were quite unfamiliar.\r\n\r\nI admired Jim's loyalty to his late master, if not his veracity, at\r\nthe valuation of the stock, which I took over as it stood. Being aware\r\nthat there was a lame one or two among the horses, I warned my valuer\r\nbeforehand. We entered the stable, and my valuer, thinking to catch\r\nJim off his guard, asked casually which they were. Jim was quite ready\r\nfor him, and answered without a moment's hesitation, \"Nerrun, sir\"\r\n(never a one). They were, however, easily detected when trotted out on\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nJim was a capital hand at \"getting up\" a horse for sale; an extra sack\r\nor two of corn, constant grooming, and rest in the stable, with the\r\naid of some mysterious powders, which, I think, contained arsenic,\r\nsoon brought out the \"dapples,\" which he called \"crown-pieces,\" on\r\ntheir coats, and in a couple of months' time one scarcely recognized\r\nthe somewhat angular beast upon which his labours had wrought a\r\nmiracle, and put a ten-pound note at least on the value. We had an\r\nancient and otherwise doubtful mare, \"Bonny,\" ready for Pershore Fair,\r\nand the previous day Jim wanted to know if I intended to be present. I\r\ntold him, \"No! I should have to tell too many lies.\" \"Oh!\" said he,\r\n\"I'll do all that, sir!\" He sold the mare to a big dealer for all she\r\nwas worth, I think, though not a large figure. Soon afterwards I had\r\nto expostulate with him about some fault. He explained the\r\ncircumstances from his point of view, adding, \"And that's the truth,\r\nsir, and the truth _is_ the truth, and\"--triumphantly--\"that's what'll\r\ncarry a man through the world!\" I could say no more, but could not\r\nhelp remembering his willingness to testify to Sonny's doubtful merits\r\nat Pershore Fair.\r\n\r\nJim became a widower, but eventually married again; a good woman, who\r\nmade a capital wife. Shortly before the wedding, when he came to see\r\nme on some business, my wife happened to be present; she was very\r\nanxious to find out the date in order that we might attend. Jim was\r\nshy, not wishing it to be generally known, and nothing could be got\r\nout of him. On leaving, however, he repented and, looking back over\r\nhis shoulder, made the announcement, \"Our job comes off next\r\nThursday,\" then closing the door quickly, he was gone.\r\n\r\nHe got my permission to visit his mother and son, both ailing in\r\nBirmingham, and on his return I made inquiries. The boy was better,\r\nbut about his mother he said, \"I don't take so much notice of she, for\r\nher be regular weared out\"--not unkindly or undutifully intended, but\r\njust a plain statement of fact, simply put; for she was a very old\r\nwoman, and could not in the course of nature be expected to live much\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nThat Jim had a tender heart I know, for when we lost a very favourite\r\nhorse, one which \"you could not put at the wrong job,\" I found him\r\nweeping and much distressed. Later he said, \"When you lose a horse I\r\nreckon it's a double loss, for you haven't got the horse or the\r\nmoney.\" My mind being dominated by the unanswerable accuracy of the\r\nlatter part of the statement, I did not, for a moment, see that the\r\nfirst part was fallacious, because, of course, one could not have both\r\nat one and the same time.\r\n\r\nHe was an excellent ploughman, and considerable skill is demanded to\r\nmanage the long wood plough, locally made, and still the best\r\nimplement of the sort on the adhesive land of the Vale of Evesham. It\r\nhas no wheels, like the ordinary iron plough has, to regulate the\r\ndepth and width of the furrow-slice, because in wet weather, if tried\r\non this almost stoneless land, the wheels become so clogged with mud\r\nand refuse, such as stubble from the previous crop, that they will not\r\nrevolve, sliding helplessly involved along the ground. Even the\r\nmould-board is wood, generally pear-tree, to which the mud does not\r\nadhere, as happens with iron. As an old neighbour explained to me,\r\n\"You can cut the newest bread with a wooden knife, whereas the doughy\r\ncrumb of the bread would stick to a steel one.\" Pear-tree wood is used\r\nbecause it wears \"slick\" (smooth), and does not splinter like wood\r\nwhich is longer in the grain.\r\n\r\nWith these long wood ploughs the ploughman himself regulates the depth\r\nand width of the furrow-slice--_i.e.,_ each strip that is severed and\r\nturned over--by holding the handles firmly in the correct position as\r\nthe plough travels along, for it cannot be left for a moment to its\r\nown inclination. This entails strict attention and much muscular\r\neffort, and, of course, the latter comes into play also in turning at\r\neach end of the field. The result is very effective; the flat\r\nmould-board offers the least possible resistance to the inversion of\r\nthe soil, whereas the iron plough, with a curling mould-board, presses\r\nthe crest of the furrow-slice into regularity of form, and gives a\r\nmore finished appearance at the expense of much extra friction and\r\nlabour for the horses.\r\n\r\nA carter-boy accompanies each team, as driver, to keep the horses up\r\nto their work and turn them at the ends. A farmer I knew in Hampshire\r\nwould not, if possible, employ a boy unless he could whistle--of\r\ncourse the ability and degree of excellence is a guide to character,\r\nand indicates to some extent a harmonious disposition; he always said,\r\n\"Now whistle,\" when engaging a new boy.\r\n\r\nThere are few more pleasant agricultural operations to watch and to\r\nfollow than a lusty team, a skilful ploughman, and a whistling boy at\r\nwork, on a glowing autumn day, when the stubble is covered with\r\ngossamers gleaming with iridescent colours in the sunshine. The\r\nupturned earth is fragrant, the fresh soil looks rich and full of\r\npromise, there is the feeling that old mistakes and disappointments\r\nare being buried out of sight, and the hope and anticipation of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nOn a Lincolnshire farm where I was a pupil, an incident occurred\r\nillustrating the anxiety of a carter for the welfare of his horses, in\r\ncombination with no small cunning. The owner, in the stable one Sunday\r\nmorning, noticed an open Bible in the manger; having doubts as to the\r\nreliability of the carter, he regarded the Bible, so prominently\r\ndisplayed, with some suspicion. Looking carefully all round he could\r\nsee nothing to find fault with, until he glanced upward at the floor\r\nover the manger, where he discovered a protruding cork. He remembered\r\nthat a heap of oats was stored in the loft, from which the bailiff\r\ngave out the rations for their teams to each man weekly. Getting the\r\nkey of the loft, he found that the cork was nicely adjusted to a hole\r\nbeneath the oats, so that the carter in question could exceed the\r\nrecognized ration whenever inclined. The fault was, of course, more\r\none of disobedience than of robbery, as the corn was consumed by his\r\nmaster's horses, and the prominence of the Bible was perhaps the worst\r\nfeature, evidently a deceptive device to arrest suspicion, though it\r\nproved to have exactly the opposite effect.\r\n\r\nVery few of my men suffered from rheumatism, but Jim was an exception.\r\nI think he applied horse embrocation to himself; he would extol its\r\nefficacy, and would tell how, when the pain attacked his shoulder, the\r\nremedy \"druv it\" to his back; applied to the latter, \"it druv it\" to\r\nhis legs; and so on indefinitely.\r\n\r\nI kept about a dozen working horses besides colts; the latter are\r\nbroken at two years old, but only very lightly worked, and, when quiet\r\nand handy, they are turned out again till a year older. Our method of\r\nmaintaining the full capacity of horse-power on the farm was to breed,\r\nor buy at six months old, two colts, and sell off two of the oldest\r\nhorses every year. As two colts could be bought for forty or fifty\r\npounds at that age, and the two old horses sold for a hundred and\r\ntwenty pounds or thereabouts, a good balance was left on the\r\ntransaction, while the full strength of the teams was maintained.\r\n\r\nJim had sufficient foresight to view with alarm the gradual dispersion\r\nof most of the oldest and best farmers in the neighbourhood, and the\r\nconversion to grass of the arable land, owing to the unfair and\r\ndangerous competition of American wheat. When we discussed the subject\r\nand foretold the straits to which the country would be reduced in the\r\nevent of war with a great European Power, he concluded these\r\nforebodings with the habitual remark, \"Well, what I says is, them as\r\nlives longest will see the most.\" A truism, no doubt, but, as time has\r\nproved, by no means an incorrect view.\r\n\r\nThere was always plenty of employment for an estate carpenter on my\r\nfarms, as I had a vast number of buildings, including four separate\r\nsets of barn, stable, sheds, and yard, away from the village, as well\r\nas those near the Manor House, and many repairs were necessary. There\r\nwere, too, very many gates, repairs to fences, hurdle-making, and odd\r\njobs, to keep a man employed for months at a time. The building of\r\nthree hop-kilns, with the necessary storerooms for green and dried\r\nhops, as the hop acreage increased, the preparation of hop-poles, and\r\nthe erection of wire-work on larger poles, which gradually superseded\r\nthe ordinary pole system, all demanded a great deal of regular work.\r\n\r\nI was most fortunate in obtaining the services of a man living in a\r\nneighbouring village, not only as estate carpenter, but as a skilled\r\njoiner, and possessing all the knowledge and efficiency of an\r\nexperienced builder. When I first met him, or very soon afterwards,\r\nTom G. was a teetotaller, and I have always had immense admiration for\r\nthe strength of will which enabled him to conquer completely the drink\r\nhabit, for he freely admitted that he was entirely mastered by it in\r\nhis younger days. He told me, and it proves what a kindly word will\r\nsometimes do, that the Squire of his village, who also employed him\r\nlargely, said to him, after praising some of his work, \"There's only\r\none thing the matter with you, Tom, and that's the drink.\" \"I went\r\nhome,\" said Tom, \"and I thought to myself, if the drink is all that's\r\nwrong with me, what a fool I must be to continue it. Next day I went\r\nto Evesham and signed the pledge, and I've never touched a drop since,\r\nthough the smell and the sight of a public-house have been so sore a\r\ntemptation that many a time after a long day's work, and with money in\r\nmy pocket, I've gone a mile or two out of my way in order not to pass\r\na place of the sort.\"\r\n\r\nHis training as a carpenter had induced habits of great accuracy,\r\nexact method, and lucid thought, and a chat with him, and watching his\r\nquick and clever workmanship, was an educational opportunity. I have\r\nalways been fascinated by such work, and one of my earliest\r\nrecollections is of being taken by my father to interview a carpenter\r\nabout some small household job. His name was Snewin--I am not sure of\r\nthe spelling, for I was only about eight years old at the time--and we\r\nfound him in his workshop vigorously using a long plane on some red\r\ndeal boards, his feet buried in beautifully curled shavings, and the\r\nwhole place redolent of the delicious scent of turpentine. Every time\r\nhis plane travelled along the edge, to my childish fancy, the board\r\nsaid in plaintive tones of remonstrance, _in crescendo_, his name,\r\n\"Snewin, _Snewin_,\" and again, \"SNEWIN,\" and even now the scent and\r\naction of planing a deal board always brings back the scene clearly to\r\nmy mind.\r\n\r\nI suppose, therefore, it was partly old associations that induced the\r\nfascination of watching Tom G. at his work, but there were other\r\nreasons. With his axe, the edge beautifully ground and sharpened to a\r\nrazor-like finish, he could trim a piece of wood, or shape it, so\r\nneatly that it presented almost the appearance of having been planed;\r\nhis saw, with no apparent effort, raced from end to end of a board or\r\nacross the grain of a piece of \"quartering,\" and his chisels and plane\r\nirons were ground to the correct concave bevel that relieves the\r\nparting of a chip or shaving, and gives what he called \"sweetness\" to\r\nthe cutting action. He was a strong Conservative, good at an argument,\r\nand had many heated discussions with some of my men whose tendencies\r\nleaned to the opposite side; but his sound logic and common sense were\r\nobservable in all his ideas, and I think he generally came off best as\r\na shrewd and clear-headed debater, for from his employment in various\r\nplaces his horizon was wider than that of the ordinary farm labourers.\r\n\r\nTom G. had considerable knowledge of the Bible, which he sometimes\r\nemployed in conversation; alluding to the work that was nearly always\r\nwaiting for him at Aldington, he told a friend of mine that there was\r\n\"earn (corn) in Egypt\"; and when he had a written contract with me for\r\na special piece of work, and wished to suggest that as time went on we\r\nmight think of some improvement, and that there was no necessity to\r\nadhere to the original specifications, he announced that \"we bean't\r\nMades, nor we bean't Piersians\" (we're not Medes, nor are we\r\nPersians).\r\n\r\nNo necessary measurement was ever guessed at, his \"rule\" was always\r\nhandy in a special pocket, but in cases where a rough guess was\r\nsufficient he would hazard it by what he called \"scowl of brow\"\r\n(intently regarding it). The agricultural labourer is inclined, both\r\nwith weights and measures, to be inaccurate, \"reckoning it's near\r\nenough.\" I found soon after I came to Aldington that the weighing\r\nmachine which had been in use throughout the whole of my predecessor's\r\ntime, and had weighed up hundreds of pounds of wool at 2s. and 2s. 6d.\r\na pound, cheese at 8d., and thousands of sacks of wheat, barley, and\r\nbeans, was about a pound in each hundredweight _against the seller_,\r\nso that he must have lost a considerable sum in giving overweight.\r\n\r\nTom G. was scornful about weather signs, and summed up his doubts in\r\nsuch matters with sarcasm: \"I reckon that the indications for rain are\r\nvery similar to the indications for fine weather!\" But the best\r\nepigram I ever heard from him was, \"There's a right way and a wrong\r\nway to do everything, and folks most in general chooses the wrong un!\"\r\nI should like to see those words of wisdom on the title-page of every\r\nschool book, and blazoned up in letters of gold on the wall of every\r\nclassroom in every school in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nI have referred to the hop-kilns I built. Throughout the work of\r\nerecting them, and it was no small one, Tom G. was the leading spirit;\r\nit gave scope for his abilities, I think, on a larger scale than any\r\nbuilding he had previously undertaken. We began with a kiln sufficient\r\nfor the first 6 acres planted; it was necessary, with the gradual\r\nextinction of British corn-growing, to find something to supersede it,\r\nand to compensate for the falling off in farm receipts. I had seen\r\nsomething of hops as a pupil on a large farm near Alton, Hampshire,\r\nwhere they occupied an area of over a hundred acres, but at that time\r\nI had no intention of growing them myself, and had not been infected\r\nwith the glamour, formerly attaching to hops beyond any other crop,\r\nthat came to me later.\r\n\r\nI visited the old Alton farm, and obtained all particulars of the\r\nlatest kind of hop-kiln in the neighbourhood from the inventor, and\r\ninstructed him to prepare plans and specifications for the conversion\r\nof an old malthouse close to the Manor. I contracted with Tom G. for\r\nall the carpenter's work, and with an excellent stonemason or\r\nbricklayer for that belonging to his department. They both entered\r\nwith enthusiasm upon the job, and we had many interesting discussions\r\nas to improvement, as it proceeded. Tom G. was a man of great\r\nresource, and could always find a way out of every difficulty; he told\r\nme, before we began, that he could see the completed building as if\r\nactually finished, just as a great sculptor once said how easy it was\r\nto produce a statue from a block of marble, for all he had to do was\r\nto cut away the superfluous material!\r\n\r\nThe alterations entailed a new roof from end to end of the old\r\nbuilding, and a new floor for the upper part, the length being about\r\n70 and the width about 20 feet. The old roof was covered mostly with\r\nstone-slates--flakes of limestone from the Cotswolds--very uneven in\r\nsize and rough as to surface, and in part with ordinary blue slates.\r\nThe latter lie much more closely on the laths, the stone slates\r\nallowing the passage of more air between them, and it was interesting\r\nto find that while the ancient laths under the stone slates were\r\nfairly well preserved, those beneath the blue slates were much\r\ndecayed, evidently from the fact of the damp in an unheated building\r\nremaining longer where the air was excluded, though one would have\r\nexpected the close-lying blue slates to be the better protection of\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\nMuch expense was saved by Tom G.'s economical use of materials;\r\nwherever the old oak beams could be used again they were incorporated\r\nwith the new work. He never cut sound old or new pieces of timber to\r\nwaste; almost every scrap came in somewhere, for he worked with his\r\nhead as well as his hands.\r\n\r\nThe difference in this respect is very noticeable in different men; an\r\nold plumber once told me that he had been employed upon a pump on a\r\nneighbouring farm, where the slot in which the handle works was so\r\nworn on one side that the bolt which carries the handle had given way,\r\nowing to the man, who had used it for years, not keeping it running\r\ntruly in the centre. He called the man's attention to the cause of the\r\ndamage, and, being a sententious old fellow, asked him why he didn't\r\nthink what he was doing. The answer was, \"I'm not paid to think.\"\r\n\r\nThe hop-kiln was a great success, and later, with the same workmen, I\r\nadded two more, as my hopyards extended, on exactly the same lines.\r\nThey would probably have been annually in use in the picking season up\r\nto the present time had it not been that the low prices ruling\r\nlatterly have rendered a crop which requires so much labour,\r\nknowledge, and supervision, not worth growing.\r\n\r\nI hear, however, with much satisfaction, that these old hop-kilns and\r\nstorerooms have been of great service during the war for drying\r\nmedicinal herbs, chiefly belladonna and henbane, and that in 1917 the\r\nturnover exceeded £6,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN OLD FASHIONED SHEPHERD--OLD TRICKER--A GARDENER--MY SECOND HEAD\r\nCARTER--A LABOURER.\r\n\r\n     \"Along the cool sequester'd vale of life\r\n     They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.\"\r\n                                                 --GRAY'S _Elegy_.\r\n\r\nI had experiences of various shepherds, and the man I remember best\r\nwas John C. Short, sturdy, strong, and willing, he was somewhat\r\nprejudiced and old-fashioned, with many traditions and inherited\r\nconvictions as to remedies and the treatment of sheep. John had a\r\nknowing expression; his nose projected and his forehead and chin\r\nretreated, so that his profile was angular. He wore the old-fashioned\r\nlong smock-frock--not the modern short linen jacket which goes by the\r\nname of smock, but a garment that reached to his knees, with a\r\nbeautifully worked front over the chest. It is a pity that these old\r\nsmock-frocks are no longer in vogue: I never see one now; they were\r\nmost picturesque, and afforded great protection from the rough weather\r\nwhich a shepherd has constantly to face. His hat was of soft felt,\r\nplaced well towards the back of his head, and, behind it, he wore a\r\nwealth of curls overlapping the collar of his smock. John was very\r\nproud of his curls; he told a group of men, who were sheep-dipping\r\nwith him, that the parasites of the sheep, which are formidable in\r\nappearance, never troubled him until they reached his head. \"Into them\r\ncurls, I suppose, John?\" said a flippant bystander. John was pleased\r\nthat his most attractive feature should receive even this recognition.\r\n\r\nAltogether he presented a notable figure, and one quite typical of his\r\nprofession, especially when armed with his staff of office, his crook.\r\nHe was inclined to superstitious beliefs, and told me when I noticed\r\nthe matted condition of the manes of some colts domiciled in a distant\r\nset of buildings that he reckoned \"Old P. G.\"--an ancient dame in a\r\nneighbouring cottage with a reputation for witchcraft--\"had been\r\na-ridin' of 'em on moonlight nights.\" This matted appearance of colts'\r\nmanes, which is only the natural result of their not being groomed or\r\ncombed when young and unbroken, was known in many country places as\r\n\"hag-ridden.\" Such superstitions are now nearly, if not quite,\r\nextinct, but still linger in old place-names, for it was usual in\r\nformer times to attribute any uncommon or surprising physical\r\nappearance to supernatural agency. Thus we have such names as \"Devil's\r\nDyke,\" \"Devil's Punchbowl,\" \"Puck Pits,\" \"Pokes-down\" (Puck's Down),\r\nand many others.\r\n\r\nThe fairy rings, too, which puzzled our ancestors, are explicable by a\r\nnatural process. The starting-point is a fungus, _Marasmius oreades_,\r\nwhich in due course sheds its spores in a tiny circle around it; the\r\ndecay of the fungus supplies nitrogen to the grass, and renders it\r\ndark green in colour. The circle expands, always outwards, more and\r\nmore fungi appearing every year; it does not return inwards because\r\nthe mineral constituents of the soil are exhausted by the growth of\r\nthe fungus and of the grass, under the stimulus of the abundant\r\nnitrogen left by the former, so that the dark ring of grass extends\r\nits diameter year by year.\r\n\r\nIn the _Tempest_ Shakespeare refers to the fairies:\r\n\r\n                                         \"... That\r\n     By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\r\n     Whereof the ewe not bites.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn carried a magic bottle of caustic liniment for application to the\r\nfeet of sheep affected with the complaint called \"foot-rot.\" The cause\r\nof this troublesome disease is excessive development of the walls of\r\nthe hoof, owing to the animals grazing exclusively on wet pasture, the\r\nsurface of which is too soft to keep them worn down; the walls\r\ngradually double over and collect wet mud, which causes inflammation.\r\nIt never occurred on my arable land, either among ewes or younger\r\nsheep, but whenever I bought sheep from the flint stones of Hampshire\r\nand grazed them on soft pasture, it soon made its appearance. The\r\nremedy is timely and constant paring of the hoof before any tendency\r\nto lameness is observed, and when this is properly attended to no\r\ncaustic application is necessary. Lame sheep indicate an inefficient\r\nshepherd, and the disorder has been well called \"Shepherd's Neglect.\"\r\n\r\nAn eminent breeder of prize Hampshire Down sheep told me that, when\r\ncontemplating the exhibition of sheep, the first necessity is to get a\r\n\"prize shepherd,\" a man with a presence, and a reputation which he\r\nwould not risk in the show-ring without something worth exhibiting. I\r\nstarted a flock of pedigree Shropshires, but my land was too good and\r\ngrew them too big and coarse for showing, and I soon found that it was\r\nuseless to try, though I succeeded in taking a prize at the\r\nWarwickshire county show. It so happened that when my shepherd (not\r\nJohn) returned in great triumph from the show, he found his first-born\r\nson, who had arrived in his absence, awaiting him. \"Well done,\r\nshupperd,\" said a neighbour, \"got him a son and a prize the same day!\"\r\n\r\nJohn was jealous of any interference in his remedial measures for\r\nailing sheep, but my wife, who doctored the village generally, was\r\nanxious to try her hand, having little faith in his skill; so we\r\narranged that the next time he had what he considered a hopeless case\r\nit was to be given over to her exclusively. The opportunity soon\r\noccurred; a ewe was found caught by the fleece in some rough briars in\r\nan old hedge, where it had been some hours in great distress, and,\r\nwith much struggling to free itself, it was quite exhausted. Pneumonia\r\nsupervened, and when John thought it impossible to save its life he\r\nhanded the case over to my wife. She succeeded, chiefly, I think, by\r\ncareful nursing, in pulling it through, much to John's surprise;\r\ndoubtless he thought its recovery a lucky fluke. John was given to\r\noccasional alcoholic lapses; on one occasion I found him aimlessly\r\ndriving sheep across a field of growing mangolds! I could see that he\r\nwas muddled, and on reaching home later I sought an interview. He was\r\nnot to be found, but at his cottage his wife told me that John was not\r\nvery well. I postponed my reckoning till the following day, when, with\r\ngreat readiness, he explained how it happened. \"The day before,\" he\r\nsaid, \"I frained my fittle (refrained from my victuals) all day, and\r\nwhen I got up yesterday I didn't feel justly righteous (quite right)\r\nov my inside; so I gets a bit of 'bacca, just about as much as _you_\r\nmed put in your pipe (this, apparently, to incriminate me), and I\r\nputts it at the bottom of a tay-cup, with a drop ov rum; then I fills\r\nit up with hot tay and drinks it off, and very soon I felt it a coming\r\nover (overcoming) mer (me).\"\r\n\r\nSheep-breeding was not one of the most important branches of farming\r\nin my part of Worcestershire: the land is too stiff and wet, they\r\nthrive much better on the Cotswolds or the chalk downs of Hampshire.\r\nAt one time I visited the latter county every summer, attending the\r\nbig fairs like Overton or Alresford, for the purpose of buying 100\r\ndraft (\"full-mouthed\") ewes from one of the best flocks. It was very\r\ninteresting in the early morning, reaching Overton by rail from\r\nBasingstoke, where I had passed the night at the Red Lion with £300 in\r\nbank-notes under my pillow, to see the gipsies in the village asleep\r\non the ground under their vans, the girls sometimes awake, combing\r\ntheir hair, and beautifying themselves in readiness for the pleasure\r\nfair where they were to appear in charge of the shooting-galleries and\r\ncompetitions. A short walk, with only time for a passing glance at the\r\nspeckled trout near the bridge over the Itchen, which I never omitted,\r\ntook me to the sheep-pens on the hill-top where the fair is held. One\r\ncould see the flocks, with their shepherds always _in front_ and the\r\ndogs behind, winding along the narrow lanes, which, from all\r\ndirections, lead to the hill, in a cloud of chalky dust, flock after\r\nflock with only a few dividing yards between them. It is advisable to\r\nreach the fairground thus early, to see the sheep before they are\r\npenned; they can be much better inspected in the open than when packed\r\nclose together, and a more reliable opinion of their condition can be\r\nformed. From the aesthetic point of view the grand old shepherds\r\ninterested me most, dignified, patriarchal men, with a reserve of\r\nstrength of character evident in their rugged features, and the\r\npatience and hardihood that takes little heed of exposure to every\r\nvariety of weather.\r\n\r\nThe sheep were sold by auction, and when I had bought a pen of 100,\r\ngenerally from Lord Ashburton's flock, paid the auctioneer's clerk as\r\nsoon as possible and received a ticket permitting the release of the\r\nsheep, as the roads in all directions are soon crowded, I induced the\r\nshepherd to help in driving them to the railway-station. He was always\r\na dear old fellow, and full of interesting information. On reaching\r\nthe station we packed the sheep into three open trucks, so close that\r\nthey could not jump out, and despatched them to Worcestershire,\r\nwhither they would arrive about noon the following day. We never had a\r\nmishap with them on the journey, but they were terribly thirsty on\r\nreaching Aldington, and made straight for water immediately.\r\n\r\nOld Tricker came to Worcestershire originally with a farmer who\r\nmigrated from Suffolk, which proves him to have been a valuable man.\r\nBut he was worn out even when he first came to work for me, though as\r\nwilling and industrious as ever. My bailiff often praised him--for his\r\nwork was excellent, if somewhat slow on account of his age--and used\r\nto tell him that \"All as be the matter with you, Tricker, is that you\r\nwas born too soon,\" which was only too true, for he must have been the\r\noldest man on the farm by at least twenty years. He was a steady\r\nworker, and was often so absorbed in his job, such as hoeing, that,\r\nbeing, moreover, somewhat deaf, he was not aware of my approach until\r\nI was quite close. On such occasions, with a violent start, he always\r\nsaid: \"My word, how you did frighten I, to be sure! Shows I don't look\r\nabout me much, however, don't it?\"\r\n\r\nHe was fond of fairs, wakes, and \"mops\"--no doubt they were\r\nreminiscent of old days, for he lived in the past--and he would often\r\nbeg a day off for such outings; he was a subject for the chaff of the\r\nother men for his gaiety when these jaunts took place. They pretended\r\nthat, as a widower for many years, it was time for him to think of\r\nanother courtship. On a festive occasion, when we were giving a dinner\r\nto all the men and their wives, great amusement was caused by\r\ncrackers, which the guests, I think, had never seen before, containing\r\npaper caps and imitation jewellery; and it was a merry scene when all\r\naround the tables were decorated in the most incongruous fashion. Old\r\nTricker happened to become possessed of a plain gilt wedding-ring, and\r\nof course chaff was levelled at him from all sides: \"Ah, Tricker; sly\r\ndog, sly dog!\" and so on. He was greatly pleased, accepting\r\ngood-naturedly the part of pantaloon of the piece; and I am sure, from\r\nhis beaming smiles, he felt, for a time at least, dozens of years\r\nyounger.\r\n\r\nYears before, when still able to do a good day's work, he walked to\r\nIpswich to revisit his old home, a distance of about 160 miles, which\r\nhe accomplished in four days, and returned in the same time. He had\r\nbeen specially struck by the building of a new post-office there--this\r\nmust have been at least thirty years before the time of which I am\r\nwriting. One of my brothers who lived near Ipswich was visiting me,\r\nand I introduced him to the old man, knowing that they would have\r\ncommon interests. No sooner did Tricker hear that my brother had just\r\ncome from Ipswich than he inquired anxiously if the new post-office\r\nwas finished. \"Oh yes, and pulled down some years ago, and a new one\r\nbuilt!\" Tricker was astonished; the years had evidently slipped by him\r\nunnoticed, and no record of dates remained in his memory.\r\n\r\nTricker often got a little mixed in the names of novelties or in\r\nunusual words. I chanced to pass him one day along the road, on my\r\nomnicycle, and next time I saw him he referred to it, adding: \"I\r\ndidn't know as you'd got a phlorsopher (velocipede and philosopher)\"!\r\nSome of my land had been occupied by the Romans in very distant days,\r\nand coins and pottery were frequently found. Tricker, having heard of\r\nthe Romans, also of Roman Catholics, jumbled them together, and\r\n\"reckoned\" that the former inhabitants of these fields were \"some of\r\nthose old Romans or Cartholics.\"\r\n\r\nThis mixture of words, generally bearing some relation to each other,\r\nwas not infrequently carried still further by making one word of two.\r\nWith some of the villagers \"conservatory\" stood for conservative and\r\ntory, and \"containment\" for concert and entertainment. A messenger who\r\nwas asked to bring _Daniel Deronda_ from the Evesham library returned\r\nwith the announcement that \"Dannel Deronomy\" was not available; this\r\nappeared to be a confusion between the books of Daniel and\r\nDeuteronomy. A cook (not a Worcestershire person) was asked if the\r\npapers had come. \"Yes; the _Standard_ has arrived, but not the Condy's\r\nfluid _(Connoisseur)_ \"! The regatta at Evesham was always \"the\r\nregretta.\" An old sexton working in a churchyard, from whom I inquired\r\nif there was a bridge over the river, replied: \"Only a temperance\r\nbridge (temporary bridge).\"\r\n\r\nTricker, as a very typical representative of the agricultural labourer\r\nin old age, was engaged as model for a figure in a picture by Mr.\r\nChevalier Taylor, then staying in Badsey. He sat in this capacity when\r\nwork was not very pressing, and day by day used to repair to the\r\nartist's lodgings with his tools on his shoulder. His remuneration was\r\nhalf a crown a day--ordinary day wages for an able-bodied man--but he\r\ntold me that the inaction was very trying, and that a day as model was\r\nmuch more exacting than a day's work on the farm.\r\n\r\nWhen the old man could no longer complete even a short day's work, and\r\nsuffered from the cold in winter, he decided to go to the workhouse\r\nfor a time, but he was out again before the cuckoo was singing, and we\r\nfound him light jobs \"by the piece,\" so that he could work for as long\r\nor as short a time as suited him. He was most grateful for any\r\nassistance, and told me that \"A little help is worth a deal of\r\nsympathy.\" Eventually he became a permanent inmate of the workhouse,\r\nmuch to my grief; but it is, of course, impossible to run a farm on\r\nwhich heavy poor-rate has to be paid, as a philanthropic institution.\r\nThe difficulty with aged and infirm persons is not so much food and\r\nmaintenance as the necessity for nursing and supervision, which are\r\nexpensive and difficult to arrange. Tricker told me that he could live\r\non sixpence a day, and if it had been a question of food only, and our\r\nvillage could have cut itself adrift from the Union and the rates it\r\nentailed, we could easily have more than kept the poor old man to the\r\nend of his days in comfort. For years he was the only parishioner\r\nreceiving any help from the immense sum the parish annually paid in\r\nrates. I have heard it said that out of every shilling of the\r\nratepayer's contributions the poor people only get twopence or its\r\nequivalent, the officials and administration expenses absorbing the\r\nremaining tenpence.\r\n\r\nMy first gardener had been employed at the Manor, when I came, for\r\nvery many years, and at the end of ten more he was obliged to resign\r\nthrough old age. He had planted the poplars round the mill-pond in his\r\nearliest days, and, among other trees, the beautiful weeping wych-elm\r\non the lawn behind the house. The weeping effect he produced by\r\nbeheading the tree when quite small and grafting it with a slip of the\r\nweeping variety, and the junction was still plainly visible. It was a\r\nsymmetrical and, especially when in bloom, a lovely tree, but as the\r\nblossoms died and scattered themselves all over the grass, they\r\nworried the methodical old man, and every spring he wished it had\r\nnever been planted. It had flourished amazingly, and we could\r\ncomfortably find sitting room at tea for sixty or seventy people at a\r\ngarden-party in its shade.\r\n\r\nHe was an excellent gardener, but did not care about novelties in\r\nflowers, though at one time he made a hobby of raising new kinds of\r\npotatoes. His greatest success was the original Ashleaf variety, the\r\nstock of which he sold to Mr. Myatt for a guinea, and which was\r\nafterwards introduced to the public as \"Myatt's Early Ashleaf.\" It was\r\none of the best potatoes ever grown, very early, and splendid in\r\nquality, and it was unfortunate that he parted with it so cheaply,\r\nthough, of course, the purchaser of the first few tubers had no idea\r\nof its immense potential value, and possibly, like so many novelties,\r\nit might have proved a failure. It is still in cultivation, though its\r\nconstitution is impaired, like that of all potatoes of long standing.\r\nLater on I shall have more to say about this unfortunate tendency to\r\ndeterioration.\r\n\r\nJ.E. was one of my most reliable men, working for me, first as\r\nunder-carter and afterwards as head carter, for, I think, altogether\r\ntwenty-six years; he was well educated and a great reader, quiet and\r\nsomewhat reserved, and though his humour did not lie on the surface,\r\nhe could appreciate a joke. My recollections of him, after his\r\nsteadiness and reliability, are chiefly of his personal mishaps, for\r\nhe was an unlucky man in this particular.\r\n\r\nI was on my round one morning when I met a breathless carter-boy\r\nmaking for the village. Asked where he was off to, \"Please, sir,\" he\r\nreplied, \"I be to fetch Master E. another pair of trowsers!\"\r\n\"Trousers,\" said I; \"what on earth for?\" \"Please, sir, the bull ha'\r\nripped 'em!\" I hurried on, and soon saw that it was no laughing\r\nmatter, for I found poor E. in a terrible plight of rags and tatters,\r\nsitting in a cart-shed in some outlying buildings, on a roller. The\r\ncowman was standing by holding a Jersey bull. The story was soon told.\r\nThe cowman, having to go into the yard, had asked E. to hold the bull\r\na minute. Unfortunately, the animal had only a halter on him, the\r\ncowman having omitted to bring the stick, with hook and swivel, to\r\nattach to the bull's nose-ring. No sooner was the cowman out of sight\r\nthan the bull began to fret, and, turning upon E., knocked him down\r\nbetween a mangoldbury and the outside wall of the yard. In this\r\nposition he was unable to get a direct attack upon the man, but he\r\nmanaged to gore him badly and tear his clothes to pieces. The cowman,\r\nhearing E. calling, came back and rescued him, the bull becoming quite\r\ndocile with his regular attendant. Poor E. was black and blue when he\r\ngot home in the pony-cart, and was laid up for many weeks afterwards.\r\nHe undoubtedly had a very narrow escape. It is curious that, though\r\nthe Jersey cows are the most docile of any kind, the bulls are the\r\nmost uncertain and, when annoyed, savage; I had trouble with two or\r\nthree, and one became so dangerous that he had to be killed in his\r\nstall.\r\n\r\nE.'s bad luck overtook him again when returning from Evesham with,\r\nfortunately, an empty waggon and team; one of the horses was startled,\r\nand E. ran forwards to catch the reins. By some means he fell, and the\r\nwaggon-wheels passed over him; had it been full, as it was on the\r\noutward journey, with a heavy load of beans, it would have been a\r\nserious matter, but nevertheless he suffered a great deal for some\r\ntime afterwards.\r\n\r\nJ.E. must have walked many hundreds of miles among my hops with the\r\nhorses drawing \"the mistifier,\" a syringing machine which pumped a\r\nmist-like spray of soft soap and quassia solution upon the under-side\r\nof the hop-leaves, when attacked by the aphis blight; and he must have\r\ndestroyed many millions of aphides, for the blight was an annual\r\noccurrence at Aldington, and taxed our energies to the utmost at one\r\nof the busiest times of year.\r\n\r\nMrs. J.E. was, and is, one of those kind persons always ready to do a\r\ngood turn to a neighbour. She and her husband brought up a large\r\nfamily, all of whom have done well, and a son in the Grenadier Guards\r\nespecially distinguished himself in the war. She has a remarkable\r\nmemory for dates of birthdays, weddings, and such-like events, and\r\noften writes us one of her interesting letters, full of information of\r\nthe old village.\r\n\r\nI had many experiences of the honesty of the agricultural labourer,\r\nbut one especially remains in my mind. I.P., a man living some two\r\nmiles from Aldington, regularly walked the four miles there and back\r\nfor many years, in addition to his day's work. He was an excellent\r\ndrainer, and a most useful all-round man, exceedingly strong and\r\nwilling, bright and cheerful in conversation, and I had a very high\r\nopinion of him. I had just reached the end of a long pay when he\r\nreappeared--having taken his wages earlier in the proceedings--and\r\nasked if I had made a mistake in his money; a sovereign was missing,\r\nand he could not remember actually taking it from the table with the\r\nrest of the cash. I at once balanced my payments and receipts for the\r\nevening, but they corresponded exactly. It was a serious matter, as a\r\nhalf-year's rent was due to the owner of his cottage that day, and\r\nI.P. was one of those men who take a pride in paying up with\r\npunctuality. I could see, as he realized that the sovereign was lost,\r\nhow disappointed and worried he felt, and being glad of an opportunity\r\nto do him a good turn, I gave him another, and sent him away very\r\ngrateful. Later still he returned again, placed a sovereign on my\r\ntable, and said that he had nearly reached home when he felt something\r\nhard against his knee, inside his corduroys, where he found the\r\nmissing coin; there was a hole in his pocket, but the encircling\r\nstring which labourers tie below the knee had prevented its escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS OF AGRICULTURAL LABOURERS AND VILLAGERS.\r\n\r\n     \"My crown is in my heart, not on my head:\r\n     Not deck'd with diamonds and Indian stones,\"\r\n                                               --_3 Henry VI_.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural labourer, and the countryman generally, does not\r\nrecognize any form of property beyond land, houses, buildings, farm\r\nstock, and visible chattels. A groom whom I questioned concerning a\r\nnew-comer, a wealthy man, in the neighbourhood, summed him up thus:\r\n\"Oh, not much account--only one hoss and a brougham!\" A railway may\r\nrun through the parish, worth millions of invested capital, but the\r\nlabourer does not recognize it as such, and a farmer, employing a few\r\nmen and with two or three thousand pounds in farm stock, is a bigger\r\nman in his eyes than a rich man whose capital is invisible.\r\n\r\nThe labourer in the days of which I am writing was inclined to be\r\nsuspicious of savings banks and deposit accounts at a banker's; his\r\nsavings represented a vast amount of hard work and self-denial; and he\r\nlooked askance at security other than an old stocking or a teapot. He\r\nhad heard of banks breaking, and felt uncomfortable about them. A\r\nstory was current in my neighbourhood of a Warwickshire bank in\r\ndifficulties, where a run was in progress. A van appeared, from which\r\nmany heavy sacks were carried into the bank, in the presence of the\r\ncrowd waiting outside to draw out their money. Some of the sacks were\r\nseen to be open, and apparently full of sovereigns; confidence was\r\nrestored, and the run ceased. Later, when all danger was over, it\r\ntranspired that these supposed resources were fictitious, for the open\r\nsacks contained only corn with a thin layer of gold on the top.\r\n\r\nFormerly it was said of a certain street in Evesham, chiefly inhabited\r\nby market-gardeners and their labourers, that the houses contained\r\nmore gold than both the banks in the town, and I have no doubt that,\r\neven at the present day, there is an immense amount of hoarded money\r\nin country places. Only a short while ago, long after the commencement\r\nof the Great War, the sale of a small property took place in my\r\nneighbourhood, when the purchaser paid down in gold a sum of £600, the\r\nbulk of which had earned no interest during the years of collection.\r\nNo doubt people, as a rule, in these days of war bonds and\r\ncertificates, have a better idea of investment, but probably a vast\r\nsum in possible loans has been lost to the Government through want of\r\nprevious information on the subject. It should have been a simple\r\nmatter, during the last fifty years of compulsory education, to teach\r\nthe rudiments of finance in the elementary schools, and I commend the\r\nmatter as worth the consideration of educational enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nThe labourer's attitude, as I have said, is suspicious towards\r\nlawyers. I was chatting with a man, specially taken on for harvest,\r\nwho expressed doubts of them; he continued, \"If anybody were to leave\r\nme a matter of fifty pounds or so, I'd freely give it 'em,\" meaning\r\nthat by the time all charges were paid he would not expect more than a\r\ntrifle, because he supposed stamps and duties to be a part of the\r\nlawyer's remuneration, and that very little would be left when all was\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nI was once discussing farming matters with a labourer when prospects\r\nwere looking very black, and ended by saying that I expected soon to\r\nbe in the workhouse. \"Ah, sir,\" said he, \"I wish I were no nearer the\r\nworkhouse nor you be!\" It should not be forgotten that the\r\nagricultural labourer's financial horizon does not extend much beyond\r\nthe next pay night, and were it not for the generosity of his\r\nneighbours--for the poor are exceedingly good to each other in times\r\nof stress--a few weeks' illness or unemployment, especially where the\r\nchildren are too young to earn anything, may find him at the end of\r\nhis resources.\r\n\r\nAlmost the first time I went to Evesham, in passing Chipping Norton\r\nJunction--now Kingham--three or four men on the platform, in charge of\r\nthe police, attracted my attention. I was told that they were rioters,\r\nguilty of a breach of the peace in connection with the National\r\nAgricultural Labourers' Union, then under the leadership of Joseph\r\nArch. Being so close to my new neighbourhood, where I was just\r\nbeginning farming, the incident was somewhat of a shock. Arch\r\nundoubtedly was the chief instrument in raising the agricultural\r\nlabourer's wages to the extent of two or three shillings a week, and\r\nthe increase was justified, as every necessity was dear at the time,\r\nowing to the great activity of trade towards the end of the sixties.\r\nThe farmers resisted the rise only because, already in the early\r\nseventies, the flood of American competition in corn-growing was\r\nreducing values of our own produce; and as all manufactured goods\r\nwhich the farmer required had largely increased in price, he did not\r\nsee his way to incur a higher labour bill.\r\n\r\nArch sent a messenger to me a few years later, to ask permission to\r\nhold a meeting in Aldington in one of my meadows. I saw at once that\r\nopposition would only stimulate antagonism, and consented. The meeting\r\nwas held, but only a few labourers attended, and no farmers, and\r\nagitation, so far as we were concerned, died down. One or two of my\r\nmen were, I think, members of the Union, but having already obtained\r\nthe increased wages there was nothing more to be gained for themselves\r\nby so continuing, and they soon dropped out of the list. Eventually\r\nthe organization collapsed. Arch was a labourer himself, and\r\nexceedingly clever at \"laying\" hedges, or \"pleaching,\" as it is still\r\ncalled, and was called by Shakespeare in _Much Ado About Nothing_:\r\n\r\n       \"Bid her steal into the pleached bower,\r\n     Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,\r\n     Forbid the sun to enter.\"\r\n\r\nPleaching is a method of reducing and renovating an overgrown hedge by\r\nwhich all old and exhausted wood is cut out, leaving live vertical\r\nstakes at intervals, and winding the young stuff in and out of them in\r\nbasket-making fashion, after notching it at the base to allow of\r\nbending it down without breakage. Arch was a native of Warwickshire,\r\nthe home of this art; it takes a skilled man to ensure a good result,\r\nbut when well done an excellent hedge is produced after two or three\r\nyears' growth. The quickset or whitethorn (May) makes the strongest\r\nand most impervious hedge, and it flourishes amazingly on the stiff\r\nclay soils of the Lias formation in that county and its neighbour\r\nWorcestershire.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered at, and admired, the labourer's resignation and\r\nfortitude in adversity; a discontented or surly face is rarely seen\r\namong them; they have, like most people, to live lives of\r\nself-sacrifice, frugality, and industry, which doubtless bring their\r\nown compensation, for the exercise and habit of these very virtues\r\ntend to the cheerfulness and courage which never give up. Possibly,\r\ntoo, the open-air life, the vitalizing sunshine, the sound sleep, and\r\nthe regularity of the routine, endows them with an enviable power of\r\nenjoyment of what some would consider trifles. After a long day out of\r\ndoors in the natural beauty of the country, who shall say that the\r\nlabourer's appetite for his evening meal, his pipe of tobacco beside\r\nhis bright fireside, and his detachment from the outside world, do not\r\nafford him as great or greater enjoyment than the elaborate luxury of\r\nthe millionaire, with his innumerable distractions and\r\nresponsibilities?\r\n\r\nThe labourer has, as I have said, little appreciation of the invisible\r\nor what does not appeal strongly to his senses; he cannot understand,\r\nfor instance, that a small bag of chemical fertilizer, in the form of\r\na grey, inoffensive powder, can contain as great a potentiality for\r\nthe nutrition of crops as a cartload of evil-smelling material from\r\nthe farmyard; nor is he aware that, in the case of the latter, he has\r\nto load and unload 90 pounds or thereabouts of worthless water in\r\nevery 100 pounds with which he deals. Possibly, however, his\r\npreference for the natural fertilizer is not wholly misplaced, for\r\nthere is, no doubt, much still to be learned concerning the relative\r\nvalues of natural and artificial compounds with special reference to\r\nthe bacterial inoculation of the soil and its influence on vegetable\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHe is not without some aesthetic feeling for the glories of Nature\r\ndaily before him, and though like Peter Bell, of whom we are told that\r\n\r\n     \"A primrose by a river's brim\r\n     A yellow primrose was to him,\r\n     And it was nothing more,\"\r\n\r\nand putting aside the metaphysical analogy and the moral teaching\r\nwhich are presented by every tree and plant, he enjoys, I know, the\r\nsimple beauty of the flower itself, the exhilarating freshness of the\r\nbright spring morning, the prodigality of the summer foliage, the ripe\r\nautumnal glow of the harvest-field, and the sparkling frost of a\r\nwinter's day. But he very rarely expresses his enthusiasm in\r\nsuperlatives: \"a usefulish lot,\" and \"a smartish few,\" meaning in\r\nWorcestershire \"a very good lot,\" and \"a great many,\" is about the\r\nlimit to which he will commit himself. His natural reticence in\r\nserious situations and calamity, and his reserve in the outlet of\r\nfeeling by vocal expression, give a wrong impression of its real\r\ndepth, and may even convey the impression of callousness to anyone not\r\nconversant with the working of his mind.\r\n\r\nTo a nephew of mine who was surprised to see his gardener's little son\r\nleaving the garden, the man explained: \"That little fellow be come to\r\ntell I a middlinish bit of news; 'e come to say as his little sister\r\nbe dead.\" Notice the \"middlinish bit of news,\" where a much stronger\r\nexpression would have been justified, and note the restraint as to his\r\nloss, suggesting an unfeeling mind, though in reality very far from\r\nthe grief he was shy of expressing.\r\n\r\nAn old woman in a parish adjoining mine, having lost a child, received\r\nthe condolences of a visitor with, \"Yes, mum; we seems to be regular\r\nunlucky, for only a few weeks ago we lost a pig.\"\r\n\r\nA lady well known to me, the daughter of the Vicar of a Cumberland\r\nparish, was calling on a woman whose husband had died a few days\r\npreviously, and expressing her sympathy with the widow in her\r\naffliction, spoke of the sadness of the circumstances. The widow\r\nthanked her visitor, and added: \"You know, miss, we was to have killed\r\na pig that week, but there, we couldn't 'ave 'em both about at the\r\nsame time\"!\r\n\r\nAll these incidents suggest callousness, but in reality they were\r\nplain statements of fact from persons with a limited vocabulary and\r\nunskilled in the niceties of polished language.\r\n\r\nAnother incident will illustrate how faulty expression may give an\r\nunintended impression. A lady, calling at a cottage, exclaimed with\r\nappreciation at the fragrant odour of frying bacon which greeted her.\r\nThe cottager was busy with it at the fire. \"Yes, miss,\" she said, \"it\r\n_is_ nice to 'ave a bit of bacon as you've waited on yourself\"--of\r\ncourse, referring to the fact that she knew the animal was always fed\r\non really good food, an important and reassuring condition, though a\r\ntender heart might have regretted the sacrifice of an intimate\r\ncreature which some would have regarded almost as a pet.\r\n\r\nThe cottager does not look upon his pig in that light; it is fed well\r\nand comfortably housed with a definite object, and very little love is\r\nlost between the pig and his master. Children in some places in\r\nWorcestershire were formerly kept at home in order to be present on\r\nthe great occasion of the pig's obsequies. A woman, asked why her\r\nchildren were absent from school, replied: \"Well, sir, you see, we\r\nkilled our pig that day, and I kept the children at home for a treat;\r\nthere's no harm in that, sir, I'm sure, for pigs allus dies without\r\nmalice!\"\r\n\r\nVillagers accept the novel significations which time or fashion\r\ngradually confer upon old words very unreadily. I could see, at first,\r\nthat they were puzzled by my use of the word \"awful,\" now long adopted\r\ngenerally to strengthen a statement, very much as they themselves make\r\nuse of \"terrible,\" \"desp'rate,\" or \"de-adly.\" They connect the word\r\n\"friend\" with the signification \"benefactor\" only; a man, speaking of\r\nsomeone born with a little inherited fortune, said that \"his friends\r\nlived before him.\" I told an old labourer that my little daughter\r\nconsidered him a great friend of hers. He looked puzzled, and replied:\r\n\"Well, I don't know as I ever gave her anything.\" They still\r\ndistinguish between two words now carrying the same meaning. I told a\r\nman that I was afraid some work he had for me would give him a lot of\r\ntrouble. He corrected me: \"'Twill be no _trouble_, master, only\r\n_labour_.\"\r\n\r\nThe labourer does not appreciate a sudden order or an unreasonable\r\nchange in work once commenced; he does not like being taken by\r\nsurprise in such matters: the necessary tool--for farm labourers find\r\ntheir own hand implements--may not be readily available, may be out of\r\norder, require grinding, or a visit to the blacksmith's for repair or\r\nreadjustment. The wise master introduces the subject, whenever\r\npossible, gradually beforehand. \"We shall have to think about\r\nwheat-hoeing, mowing, potato-digging, next week,\" prepares the man for\r\nthe occasion, so that when the time comes he has his hoe, axe, scythe,\r\nor bill-hook, as the case may be, ready. The job, too, may demand some\r\nspecial clothing--hedging gloves, gaiters, new shoes, and so forth.\r\n\r\nHe is often suspicious of new arrangements or alteration of hours, and\r\nis inclined to attribute an ulterior motive to the proposer of any\r\nchange in the unwritten but long-accustomed laws which govern his\r\nhabits; he lives in a groove into which by degrees abuses may have\r\ncrept, and some alteration may have become imperative.\r\n\r\nWhen we introduced a coal club for the villagers, with the idea of\r\nbuying several trucks at lowest cash price, collecting their\r\ncontributions week by week during the previous summer, when good wages\r\nwere being earned, and delivering the coal gratis in my carts shortly\r\nbefore winter, they seemed very doubtful as to the advantage of\r\njoining. Some saw the advantage at once, knowing the high prices of\r\nsingle half-tons or hundredweights delivered in coal-merchants' carts;\r\nothers would \"let us know in a day or two,\" wanted time to consider\r\nthe matter, being taken \"unawares\"; others, assured that nobody would\r\nundertake such a troublesome business without an eye to personal\r\nprofit, but anxious not to offend my daughter, who was visiting each\r\ncottage, replied: \"Oh yes, miss, if 'tis to do _you_ any good\"!\r\nEventually, however, they were all satisfied and very grateful,\r\nappreciating the fact that the cartage was not charged for, and that\r\nthey were getting much better coal than before at a lower price.\r\n\r\nVillage people, I am afraid, are rather fond of horrors; the newspaper\r\naccounts of events which come under that description, such as murders,\r\nsuicides, and sensational trials, afford, apparently, much interest. A\r\nman was working for me on some repairs close to my door; as he was a\r\nstranger, I tried, as usual, to induce him to talk whenever I passed.\r\nI had no success and could not get a word out of him, until, one\r\nmorning, I chanced to see a sensational headline in a local paper\r\nabout a suicide in a neighbouring town. On passing my workman, he\r\nimmediately broke out in great excitement, \"Did you read in the paper\r\nabout that bloke who went to his father's house at W----, sat down on\r\nthe doorstep, and cut his throat?\" The account had evidently seized\r\nupon his imagination, and had thoroughly roused him out of himself,\r\nbut the following day he was as silent as before.\r\n\r\nBirths, marriages, and deaths are interesting topics in the village,\r\nand perhaps with reason, for, after all, they are the most important\r\nevents in our lives, and in the villages most of the cottagers are\r\nmore or less related. All the inhabitants were much excited when a\r\npoor old widow, living very near my house, sitting on a low circular\r\nstone parapet round her well, lost her balance in some way, fell in,\r\nand was drowned. I was foreman of the jury at the inquest, and after\r\nhearing the evidence, which amounted to no more than the finding of\r\nthe body soon after the event, the coroner expressed his opinion that\r\nit was a case of accidental death, with which I at once concurred.\r\nWith some reluctance, the other jurymen agreed; they had, I imagine,\r\nas usual, made up their minds for a more sensational verdict, but\r\nscarcely liked to suggest it, and a verdict of accidental death was\r\naccordingly returned. Afterwards I heard that the villagers were\r\nsaying that it was very kind of me to bring in such an indulgent\r\nverdict, but they \"knowed very well it was suicide.\"\r\n\r\nI was invited to the wedding feast of my bailiff's daughter, and\r\nbeing, I suppose, regarded as the principal guest, was, according to\r\ncustom, requested to carve the excellent leg of mutton which formed\r\nthe _pièce de résistance_. The parish clerk, considerably over eighty\r\nat the time, was one of the most sprightly members of the company; he\r\nkept us interested with historical recollections going back to the\r\nBattle of Waterloo, and spoke of Wellington and Napoleon almost as\r\nfamiliarly as we now speak of Earl Haig and the Kaiser. He had a\r\nstrong sense of humour, and, after a very hearty meal, announced that\r\nhe didn't know how it was, but he'd \"sort of lost his appetite,\"\r\npretending to regard the fact as an injury, premeditated by the\r\nhospitality of our host and hostess.\r\n\r\nThe labourer dearly loves a grievance, not exactly for its own sake,\r\nbut because it affords an interesting topic of conversation. One\r\nautumn, returning from a holiday in the Isle of Wight, I found the\r\nwhole village agog with the first County Council election. A\r\nmagistrate candidate, in the neighbouring village of Broadway, was to\r\nbe opposed by an Aldington man. I found a local committee holding\r\nexcited partisan meetings on behalf of the latter, active canvassing\r\ngoing on, a villager appointed as secretary (always called\r\n\"seckert_ar_y\" in these parts), and the election the sole topic of\r\nconversation. The village people, always delighted in the possession\r\nof a common enemy and a common cause, were making the election a\r\nvillage affair, as opposed to the village of the other candidate;\r\npopular feeling was running very high, Badsey, of course, joining up\r\nwith Aldington as strong allies. Some young men had lately been before\r\nthe magistrates at Evesham, and fined for obstructing the footpath,\r\nand the magistrate candidate was selected as the scapegoat for the\r\naffront to our united villages. At the election the Aldington man was\r\nreturned, and his supporters started with him on a triumphal progress\r\nthrough the constituency. Of course, they visited Broadway, to crow\r\nover the conquered village, but the wind was somewhat taken out of\r\ntheir sails when the defeated candidate at once came forward, shook\r\nhands with his opponent, and congratulated him upon his success! The\r\nreturn journey was not so hilarious; one of the men of Broadway,\r\nnoticing a string of carts in the procession, conveying sympathizers\r\nwith the victor, in addition to the owners of the vehicles--thus\r\nrendering the latter liable to the carriage duty of 15s. each--and\r\nstrongly resenting the spirit which brought the victorious party to\r\nBroadway, sent a telegram to the Superintendent of Police at Evesham,\r\nwho met the returning procession and took down their names, with the\r\nultimate result of a substantial haul in fines for the excise!\r\n\r\nDuring the Boer War the common foe was, of course, \"Old Kruger\" (with\r\na soft _g_), and we hoisted the Union Jack in front of the Manor\r\nwhenever our side scored a substantial success. The news of Lord\r\nRoberts's victory at Paardeburg reached Badsey in the morning, after\r\nthe papers, and, returning by road from my farm round, I heard great\r\nrejoicings and cheering from the direction of the village. Meeting a\r\nboy, I learned that \"Old Cronje\" was defeated and a prisoner, with\r\n\"'leven thousand men!\"--a report which proved to be correct with the\r\ntrifling discount of 9,000 of the latter! The same spirit of union for\r\na common cause was almost as evident at that time as in the far more\r\nstrenuous struggle of 1914-1918, and so long as England to herself\r\nremains but true, doubtless our enemies will fulfil the part assigned\r\nto them by the greatest of English poets.\r\n\r\nA love of the marvellous is a common characteristic of country village\r\nfolks, and I have already referred to such beliefs in the supernatural\r\namong my men. We had our own \"white lady\" on the highroad where it\r\nturns off to Aldington, though I never met anyone who had seen her;\r\nthere were, too, signs and wonders before approaching deaths, and a\r\nthrilling story of a headless calf in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nAn old house at Badsey, once a _hospitium_ or sanatorium for sick\r\nmonks from Evesham Abbey in pre-Reformation days, was reported to be\r\nhaunted, and people told tales of \"the old fellows rattling about\r\nagain\" of a night. Probably these beliefs had been encouraged in\r\nformer times by the monks themselves, to prevent the villagers prying\r\ntoo closely into their occupations; and no doubt the scattered\r\nindividuals of the same body originated the popular theory that the\r\nAbbey lands of which they were dispossessed would never, owing to a\r\ncurse, pass by inheritance in the direct line from father to eldest\r\nson--an event that in the course of nature often fails, though by no\r\nmeans invariably.\r\n\r\nIn recent years a startling story has been told, and even appeared in\r\na local paper, of a ghostly adventure near the Aldington turning. A\r\nyoung lady (not a native), riding her bicycle to Evesham from Badsey,\r\npassed, machine and all, right through an apparition which suddenly\r\ncrossed her path, without any resulting fall.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the monk's _hospitium_ I lately made an interesting\r\ndiscovery as to the origin of a curious name of one of my fields,\r\nwhich had always puzzled me. The field adjoined the _hospitium_, and\r\nwas always known as \"the Signhurst.\" Field-names are a very\r\ninteresting study, they usually bear some significance to a\r\npeculiarity in the field itself, or its position with reference to its\r\nsurroundings, and it has always been a hobby of mine to trace their\r\nderivations. The word \"Signhurst\" presented no clue to its origin\r\nexcept the Anglo-Saxon \"burst,\" signifying a wood, but there was no\r\nappearance or tradition of any wood having ever occupied the spot, and\r\nthe land was so good, and so well situated as to aspect, that it was\r\nunlikely to have been such a site, even in Anglo-Saxon days. I\r\nstumbled upon a passage in May's _History of Evesham_ which mentioned\r\nthe \"Seyne House,\" meaning \"Sane House,\" the equivalent of the modern\r\nword \"sanatorium,\" and I saw at once the origin of the corrupted word\r\n\"Signhurst\"--the field near the Seyne House.\r\n\r\nWages are, of course, the crowning reward of the working-man's week;\r\nthroughout the whole of my time 15s. a week was the recognized pay for\r\nsix full summer days--\"a very little to receive, but a good deal to\r\npay away,\" as a neighbour once said. During harvest, and at piecework,\r\nmore money was earned, and it always pleased me that I could pay much\r\nbetter prices for piece-work among the hops than for piece-work at\r\nwheat-hoeing or on similar unremunerative crops. The reason is\r\nobvious: the hoeing of an acre of wheat, a crop which might possibly\r\nreturn a matter of £10 per acre, takes no more manual effort than the\r\nhoeing of an acre of hops, where a gross return of £70 or £80 per acre\r\nis not unusual, and is sometimes considerably exceeded.\r\n\r\nAs wages must eventually always depend upon prices of produce raised\r\nby the labour for which such wages are expended, when the agricultural\r\nlabourer buys his bread he is only buying back his own labour in a\r\nconcrete form plus the other relative expenses on the farm, and the\r\ncost of milling, baking, and distribution, so that when he gets a high\r\nprice for his labour he must expect to pay a high price for his food;\r\nand when the price of food is reduced the price of his labour also\r\nfalls. Here, again, the rudiments of economics, taught in the schools,\r\nwould conduce to his understanding the position, and the eradication\r\nof discontent.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, economically speaking, to defend the system of equal\r\nwages to the most capable and industrious men on the one hand and to\r\ninefficient slackers on the other; and as a graduated scale of\r\npayment, according to results, is not practicable without arousing\r\nill-feeling and jealousy, the farmer's only remedy is to get rid of\r\nthe slackers. Inefficiency and slacking are often due to a man's\r\nenfeebled mental and physical condition, owing to neglect in his\r\nbringing up as a child, or to insufficient or unwholesome food\r\nprovided by an improvident wife in his home.\r\n\r\nI was fortunate in meeting with very few of these degenerates, but I\r\nremember one tall, delicate-looking man who seemed unable to apply\r\neither his strength or his attention to his work. He was denounced by\r\nthe foreman under whom he worked as not only useless, but \"the\r\nstarvenest wretch as ever I see,\" intended to convey the impression,\r\nand confirming my own conclusion, that cold and hunger were really the\r\ncause of his inability to render a fair day's work.\r\n\r\nI remember, too, when some elderly women, with a younger one, were\r\nhay-making, one of the old ladies, dragging the big \"heel-rake\" behind\r\nthe waggon in course of loading--always rather a tough job--tried to\r\ninduce the younger woman to take her place with, \"Here, Sally, thee\r\ntake a turn at it; thee be a better 'ooman nor I be.\" My bailiff,\r\noverhearing, at once interposed: \"Be she a better 'ooman than thee,\r\nBetsy, ov a Saturday night [pay-night]?\"\r\n\r\nHard-and-fast laws and fixed prices for agricultural labour will be\r\nfound very difficult to maintain as to piecework; no wage board can\r\nfix just prices, because conditions are so variable. Of two men\r\ncutting corn on separate plots in the same field, the one at 12s. an\r\nacre may really earn more money _per diem_ than another man at 15s. an\r\nacre on the other side of the field, owing to the difference in the\r\nweight of the crop or its condition, it being, perhaps, erect in the\r\nfirst case, and laid by heavy storms in the second.\r\n\r\nThere is, too, a vast difference in the value of boys' work and\r\nusefulness; one may easily be worth double another, yet no difference\r\nis allowable by the new law; or one may demoralize another, so that\r\ntwo are less effective than one. A good old saying puts the matter\r\nvery plainly: \"One boy's a boy, two boys are half a boy, and three\r\nboys are no boy at all!\"\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, ridiculous for townspeople, lawyers, and manufacturers\r\nto legislate for the labour of the farm; they do not understand that\r\nindoor labour in the workshop or factory, under regular conditions and\r\nwith unvarying materials, is totally different from labour out of\r\ndoors, in constantly changing conditions of season, weather, and the\r\nresulting crops dealt with. An old maxim of the Worcestershire\r\nlabourer who, without a fixed place, took on piece-work at specially\r\nbusy times, will confirm this: \"Go to a good farmer for wheat-hoeing,\r\nand to a bad one for harvesting.\" I may explain that the fields of the\r\ngood farmer are clean and nearly free from weeds, so that hoeing is a\r\ncomparatively light job; but the same, or nearly the same, price per\r\nacre is paid by the bad farmer, whose corn is overrun with weeds,\r\nentailing much more time and harder work. On the other hand, the good\r\nfarmer's wheat crop is much heavier than that of the bad, and, the\r\nprices for cutting being again very similar, more money _per diem_ can\r\nbe earned at harvest on the farm of the latter.\r\n\r\nIt is a sound old Worcestershire saying that \"the time to hoe is when\r\nthere are no weeds\"--apparently a paradox, but the meaning is simple:\r\nwhen no weeds are to be seen above ground there are always millions of\r\ntiny seedlings just below the surface ready to increase and multiply\r\nwonderfully with a shower of rain; if attacked at the seedling stage,\r\nthese can be slaughtered in battalions, with far greater ease and\r\nefficacy than when they become deep-rooted and established, and\r\ndominate the crop.\r\n\r\nI have heard of farmers to whom pay-night was a sore trial; one such\r\nwas frequently known to mount his horse and gallop away just before\r\nhis men appeared: how he settled eventually I do not know. Some\r\nfarmers will pay out of doors on their rounds, having a rooted\r\nobjection to business of any kind under a roof; and one small farmer,\r\nI was told, always passed the cash to his men behind his back so that\r\nhe might not have the agony of parting actually before his eyes.\r\n\r\nA labourer is supposed to come to work in his master's time and go\r\nhome in his own, thus sharing the necessary loss, and, as a rule, they\r\nare fairly punctual; but one defaulter in this particular will waste\r\nmany moments of a whole gang working together, as it seems to be\r\netiquette not to begin till they are all present. I have often heard,\r\ntoo, sarcastic comparisons made between the day-man and \"the\r\nany-time-of-day man.\"\r\n\r\nThe cottagers have their feuds, and the use of joint wash-houses or\r\nbaking-ovens between two or more adjoining cottages is a frequent\r\nsource. I have had excited wives of tenants coming to me at\r\nunseasonable hours to settle these differences, and I found it a very\r\ndifficult business to reconcile the disputants. I could only visit the\r\n_locus in quo_ and arrange fixed and separate days and regulations;\r\nbut though the wisdom of Solomon may administer justice in a dispute,\r\nit is impossible to ensure a really peaceful solution that will\r\nendure.\r\n\r\nSometimes feuds, originating in such or similar causes, were\r\nmaintained for years by neighbours living with only a 9-inch party\r\nwall between them, and daily meetings outside, to the extent of not\r\neven \"passing the time of day.\" At last, however, in a day of distress\r\nto one, the heart of the unafflicted other would melt, and after an\r\noffer of help, or actual assistance, kind relations would be once more\r\nestablished. Or a peace offering, in the shape of a dish of good\r\npig-meat, sent over with a kind message, would restore more genial\r\nconditions, and they would return to happy and neighbourly\r\nfamiliarity.\r\n\r\nI once employed an old Dorset labourer, a tall, slim, aristocratic\r\nfigure, with an elegant, refined nose to match; he bore the well-known\r\nname of an ancient and distinguished Dorset family, and I have no\r\ndoubt was well descended. He was decidedly a canny, not to say crafty,\r\nman. I gave him a holiday at Whitsuntide to visit his old home, but he\r\noverran the time agreed upon and returned some days late. Before I\r\ncould begin the rebuke I proposed to administer, he produced a\r\ncharming photograph of a ruined abbey near his old locality, and\r\nhanded it to me as a present. \"I thought upon you, master, while I was\r\naway, and knowing as you was fond of ancient things I've brought you\r\nthis picture.\" I was completely disarmed, and the rebuke had to be\r\npostponed _sine die_.\r\n\r\nAs I was talking one day to my bailiff--one of the men who lived a\r\nmile away standing near--he said: \"Tom, here, is always the first man\r\nto arrive in the morning; I have never known him to be late.\" I\r\ncongratulated Tom, and asked what time he went to bed: \"Oh, about\r\nseven o'clock!\" He was, in fact, a lonely old bachelor, and, being \"no\r\nscholard,\" it saved lights and firing to be early to bed.\r\n\r\nThis man, like many villagers, had very vague ideas of geography. To\r\nsave the trouble of cooking, he lived largely on American tinned beef,\r\nand got chaffed about it by his fellow-workers. \"How be you getting on\r\nwith the 'Merican biff?\" Tom was asked. \"Oh,\" said he, \"never no more\r\n'Merican biff for me.\" \"How's that, Tom?\" \"Why, the other day I found\r\na trouser-button in it!\" The point of this story lies in the fact that\r\nthe Russo-Turkish war was proceeding at the time. _Tempora mutantur_,\r\nwe were then encouraging Turkey against Russia, though the latter had\r\ndeclared war to avenge the atrocities in Bulgaria of which the Turks\r\nwere guilty, while in the recent struggle the position was almost\r\nexactly reversed.\r\n\r\nThere was then a violent militant feeling here in Britain, and excited\r\ncrowds were singing:\r\n\r\n\"We don't want to fight but, by Jingo, if we do, We've got the ships,\r\nwe've got the men, We've got the money too.\"\r\n\r\nHence the expression \"Jingoism,\" which we often hear to-day, though,\r\nperhaps, the origin is now almost forgotten.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual to see villagers, as married couples, complete\r\ncontrasts to each other in appearance and character--one fat and\r\njolly, the other thin and miserable; one happy and contented, the\r\nother grumbling and morose; one open-hearted and generous, the other\r\nclose and parsimonious. In matrimony people are said to choose their\r\nopposites, and possibly, as time goes on, the difference in their\r\nappearance and dispositions becomes still more definitely developed.\r\n\r\nThe labourer understands sarcasm and makes use of it himself, but\r\nirony is often lost upon him. Passing an old man on a pouring wet day,\r\nI greeted him, adding, \"Nice morning, isn't it?\" He stared, hesitated,\r\nand then, \"Well, it would be if it wasn't for the rain!\" I only\r\nremember one surly man--not one of my workers or tenants. He was\r\nscraping a very muddy road, and I remarked, for something to say,\r\n\"Makes it look better, doesn't it?\" All I got in reply was, \"I\r\nshouldn't do it if it didn't!\"\r\n\r\nIt is important, in managing a mixed lot of farm labourers, to find\r\nout each man's special gift, making him the responsible person when\r\nthe time or opportunity arrives for its application. There are men,\r\nexcellent with horses, who have no love of steam-driven machinery, and\r\n_vice versa_; and there are men who are capable at small details, yet\r\nunable to take comprehensive views.\r\n\r\nResponsibility is the life-blood of efficiency, and men can always be\r\nfound upon whom responsibility will act like a charm, producing\r\nquickened perception, interest, foresight, economy, resource,\r\nindustry, and all the characteristics that responsibility demands. Put\r\nthe square peg in the square hole, the round peg in the round hole;\r\nshow the man you have confidence in him, teach him to act on his own\r\ninitiative in all the lesser matters that concern his job, coming only\r\nto the master in those larger considerations to which the latter are\r\nsubordinate, and my experience is that your confidence will not be\r\nbetrayed, and that he will save you an immense amount of tiresome\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult man to deal with is the over-confident \"know-all\";\r\nhe is always ready to oppose experience--often dearly bought--with his\r\nsuperior knowledge, he can suggest a quicker or a cheaper way of doing\r\neverything, and in his last place he \"never saw\" your system followed.\r\nHe is the penny-wise and pound-foolish individual, and his methods are\r\n\"near enough.\" It has been said that at twenty a man knows everything,\r\nat forty he is not quite so sure, and at sixty he is certain that he\r\nknows nothing at all; but there are exceptions even to this rule, who\r\ncontinue all their lives thinking more and more of their own opinions,\r\nand completely satisfied with their own methods. On the other hand,\r\nthe master will always find, among the more experienced, men from whom\r\nmuch is to be learnt; they are generally diffident and not too ready\r\nto hazard an opinion, but when consulted they can give very valuable\r\nhelp. I willingly acknowledge my indebtedness to my old hands, their\r\nwell-founded convictions that were the fruit of long years of\r\npractical experience, and their readiness to impart them in times of\r\ndoubt and difficulty.\r\n\r\nJust as bad-tempered grooms make nervous, bad-tempered horses; rough\r\nand noisy cattle-men, fidgety cows; ill-trained dogs and savage\r\nshepherds, sheep wild and difficult to approach; so does the\r\nbad-tempered, impatient, or slovenly master make men with the same bad\r\nqualities, when a smile or a kind word will bring out all that is good\r\nin a man and produce the best results in his work.\r\n\r\nI began my farming with four dear old women, working on the land, when\r\nwanted for light jobs; the youngest must have been fifty at least.\r\nThey received the time-honoured wage of tenpence a day, and worked, or\r\ntalked, about eight hours. They loved to work near the main road,\r\ndiscussing the natural history of the occupants of passing carts or\r\ncarriages. They knew something comic, tragic, or compromising about\r\neverybody, and expressed themselves with epigrammatic force. A farmer\r\noccupant of a neighbouring farm in long-past days, was a favourite\r\nsubject of such recollections. After relating how \"he were a random\r\nduke,\" and recalling his habits, one old lady would conclude the\r\nrecital with an account of his last days, adding, as if everything was\r\nthereby finally condoned:\r\n\r\n     \"But there, 'e was just as nice a carpse as ever I see, and\r\n     I was a'most minded to put his paddle [thistle-spud] beside\r\n     him in his coffin, for he was always a-diggin' and a-delvin'\r\n     about with it.\"\r\n\r\nOne member of this quartet, when ill, had a dish of minced mutton sent\r\nher in the hopes of tempting her appetite. She eyed the gift with\r\ndisfavour, and announced with scorn that \"she preferred to chew her\r\nmeat herself!\"\r\n\r\nIn due course these old ladies retired from active service and younger\r\nwomen took their places; women were especially necessary in the\r\nhop-yards for the important operation of tying the selected bines to\r\nthe poles with rushes and pulling out those which were superfluous. It\r\nwas difficult, at first, to accustom them to the fact that the hop\r\nalways twines the way of the sun, whilst the kidney bean takes the\r\nopposite course. And there was a problem which greatly exercised their\r\nminds: How were they to reach the hops at the tops of the poles--14\r\nfeet from the ground--when the time came? It did not occur to them\r\nthat it was possible to cut the bine and pull up the pole. They soon\r\nbecame very quick and expert at the tying, and their well-worn\r\nwedding-rings, telling of a busy life, would flash brightly in the\r\nsunshine as they tenderly coaxed the brittle bines round the base of\r\nthe poles, securing them with the rush tied in a special slip-knot, so\r\nthat it easily expanded as the bine enlarged.\r\n\r\nWomen are splendid at all kinds of light farm work whenever deftness\r\nand gentle touch are required, such as hop-tying and picking, or\r\ngathering small fruit like currants, raspberries, and strawberries;\r\nbut I do not consider them in the least capable of taking the place of\r\nmen in outdoor work which demands muscular strength and endurance and\r\nthe ability to withstand severe heat or bitter cold or wet ground\r\nunder foot, through all the varying seasons. Village women have, too,\r\ntheir home duties to attend to, and it is most important that their\r\nmen-folk should be suitably fed and their houses kept clean and\r\nattractive.\r\n\r\nOn the farm of my son-in-law, in Warwickshire, I have seen something\r\nof the work of land girls, to the number of seventy or more, for whom\r\nhe provided a well-organized camp with a competent lady Captain; and I\r\nknow how useful they proved in the emergency caused by the War, but I\r\nstill adhere to my former conclusion as to the more strenuous forms of\r\nfarm labour, without in the least detracting from my admiration for\r\nthe courage and patriotism that brought them forward.\r\n\r\nI know one woman, however, who quite successfully undertakes very\r\nstrenuous garden work, including digging, having been inured to it at\r\na very early age. If she could be spared from her own work to take the\r\nposition of instructress for young girls determined to make the land\r\ntheir chief employment, they would be saved a vast amount of\r\nunnecessary fatigue and labour by learning the art of using spades,\r\nforks, hoes, and rakes in the way that experience teaches, relying\r\nmore upon the weight and designed capabilities of the tool to do the\r\nwork than upon their own untrained muscles.\r\n\r\nWe could always get a supply of excellent maids for house-work from\r\namong the village families; they began very young, coming in for a few\r\nhours daily to help the regular staff, and, as these left or got\r\nmarried, they were ready trained to take their places. These girls\r\nwere quite free from the self-importance of the present-day domestic,\r\nbut I remember one nice village girl about whom we inquired as a\r\nlikely maid who, it then appeared, was engaged to marry a thriving\r\nsmall tradesman. The girl's mother, being over-elated at her\r\ndaughter's apparently brilliant prospects of independence, rejected\r\nthe proposal with some hauteur, adding that her daughter \"would soon\r\nbe keeping her own maid.\" I fear, however, that she was disappointed,\r\nas the course of true love did not run smooth.\r\n\r\nWe preferred a married man as shepherd, because, when I had only a few\r\ncows, he combined his duties with those of cowman; and, bringing in\r\nthe milk and doing the churning, he was much about the back premises.\r\nOn one occasion, however, I engaged a young bachelor, partly because\r\nhe replied, with a knowing smile, to a question as to whether he was\r\nmarried, that he dared say he could be if he liked--which I\r\noptimistically took to amount to an announcement of his engagement.\r\n\r\nTime went on and he remained a single man, but it was observable that\r\nhe lingered on his milky way, and was more in evidence in the dairy\r\nthan his duties appeared to warrant. We concluded that he was\r\nattracted by the cook. One day my wife said to another maid: \"I can't\r\nthink why the shepherd spends so much time in the house. I suppose\r\ncook is the attraction?\" The girl blushed, hesitated, and looked down,\r\nbut finally courageously murmured: \"Please, mum, it's me, mum!\" They\r\nwere married in due course, and we lost an excellent servant.\r\n\r\nSome of the village women and girls filled up spare moments with\r\n\"gloving\"; the large kid-glove manufacturers in Worcester supplied the\r\nmaterial, cut into shape, and a stand, with a kind of vice divided\r\ninto spaces the exact size of each stitch, which held the work firmly\r\nwhile the stitching was done by hand; they grew very quick at this\r\nwork, and turned out the gloves with beautifully even stitches, but I\r\ndon't think they could earn much at it in a day, and it must have been\r\nrather monotonous.\r\n\r\nI was interested to read in Mr. Warde Fowler's _Kingham Old and New_\r\nan account of a peculiar ceremony--called \"Skimmington,\" by Mr. Hardy,\r\nin his _Mayor of Casterbridge_--which took place in Kingham village. I\r\nhave known of two similar cases, one in Surrey and one at Aldington,\r\nunder the name of \"rough music.\" The Kingham case was quite parallel\r\nwith that at Aldington, being a demonstration of popular disapproval\r\nof the conduct of a woman resident, in matters arising out of\r\nmatrimonial differences.\r\n\r\nThe outraged neighbours collect near the dwelling of the delinquent,\r\nhaving provided themselves with old trays, pots and pans, and anything\r\nby means of which a horrible din can be raised, and proceed to\r\nserenade the offender. To be the subject of such a demonstration is\r\nregarded as a signal disgrace and a most emphatic mark of popular\r\nodium. Mr. Warde Fowler tells me, on the authority of a German book on\r\nmarriage, etc., that \"the same sort of din is made at marriage in some\r\nparts of Europe to drive evil spirits away from the newly married\r\npair.\" Possibly, therefore, the custom among our own villagers may\r\nhave originated with the same idea, and they may formerly have taken\r\nthe charitable view that evil spirits were responsible for evil deeds,\r\nand that their exorcism was a neighbourly duty.\r\n\r\nThe holiday outings I gave my men were a _quid pro quo_ for some hours\r\nof overtime in the hay-making, and included a day's wages, all\r\nexpenses, and a supply of food. They generally went to a large town\r\nwhere an agricultural show was in progress, but I think the sea trips\r\nto Ilfracombe and Weston-super-Mare were the most popular, offering as\r\nthey did much greater novelty. I have a vivid recollection of the\r\npreparation of the rations on the previous night: a vast joint of beef\r\nnicely roasted and got cold before operations commenced, my wife and\r\ndaughter making the sandwiches, while I cut up the beef in the\r\nkitchen, sometimes in my shirt-sleeves on a hot summer night;\r\nmountains of loaves of bread, great slices of cake, and pounds of\r\ncheese, completed the provisions. The rations were wrapped in separate\r\npapers and placed in a hipbath, covered with a cloth, and finally kept\r\nin a cool building, whence each man took his portion at early dawn.\r\nFor the sea trips the train took the party to Gloucester and\r\nSharpness, where they embarked upon the steamer.\r\n\r\nMany and thrilling were the tales I heard next day; the sea was fairly\r\nsmooth until they reached the Bristol Channel, but then, if they met a\r\nsouth-west wind, the vessel began to roll, and jovial faces looked\r\nthoughtful. I must not dwell upon the delightful horrors of the voyage\r\non such occasions; they were accepted with good-humour and regarded as\r\npart of the show, but it was curious that not one of the narrators\r\nhimself suffered the fate that he so graphically described as the\r\nportion of the others. Arrived at their destination, they inspected\r\nthe town, watched the people on the piers and parades, and the\r\nchildren playing on the sands. The latter created the greatest\r\ninterest, busy with their spades and buckets, or, as one man expressed\r\nit, \"little jobs o' draining and summat!\"\r\n\r\nAt Christmas the village children always came in small gangs to sing,\r\nor rather chant, a peculiar and very ancient seasonable greeting:\r\n\r\n     \"I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year,\r\n     A pocket full of money and a cellar full of beer,\r\n     A good fat pig to last you all the year.\r\n     May God bless all friends near!\r\n     A merry, merry Christmas and a happy New Year.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACHINERY--VILLAGE POLITICS--ASPARAGUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Last week came one to the county town\r\n     To preach our poor little army down.\"\r\n                                          --_Maud_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough machinery has lightened the labour of manual workers to some\r\nextent, it entails much more trouble upon masters and foremen, for\r\nbreakages are frequent and always occur at the busiest time. What with\r\nmowers, reapers, thrashing machines, chaff-cutters, root-pulpers, and\r\ngrain-mills run by steam-power or in connection with horse-gears;\r\nhop-washers, separators, and other delicately adjusted novelties, the\r\nmaster must of necessity be something of a mechanic himself. I doubt\r\nif machinery is really quite the advantage claimed by theorists and\r\nreconstructionists at the present day. Even the thrashing machine,\r\nuniversally adopted, presents disadvantages in comparison with the\r\nancient flail, generally regarded as obsolete, though still to be\r\nfound in occasional use by the smallholder or allotment occupier. In\r\nformer times the farmer reserved his thrashing by hand, for the most\r\npart, for winter work during severe frost or wet weather, when nothing\r\ncould be done outside. The immense barns, which still exist, were\r\nfilled almost to the roof at harvest; thatching was not necessary, and\r\nevery sheaf was absolutely safe from rain as soon as it was under\r\ncover. Continuous winter work was provided for the men, and a daily\r\nsupply of fresh straw for chaff-cutting and bedding, besides fresh\r\nchaff and rowens or cavings for stock throughout the winter. With the\r\nthrashing machine in use for ricks, thatching is a necessity, and is\r\noften difficult to arrange in the stress of harvest; the machine and\r\nengine demand a day's work for two teams of horses to fetch them, and\r\nthe cartage and expense of much coal, now so dear. On a small farm\r\nextra hands have to be engaged, the straw has to be stacked or carried\r\nto the barns, and the same applies to the chaff and rowens. If the\r\nweather is damp, straw, chaff, and rowens get stale, mouldy, and\r\nunpalatable to the stock, a heavy charge is made for the hire of the\r\nmachine and the machine men, and the latter require food and drink or\r\npayment instead. The machine breaks and bruises many grains of corn,\r\nwhich are thereby damaged for seed or malting, whereas the less urgent\r\nflail leaves them intact.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the thrashing machine gives an impression to outsiders of\r\nbrisk and remunerative work, but it is cheerful to the farmer only\r\nwhen high prices are ruling. Far otherwise was it for many years\r\nbefore the War, when corn-growers heard only its moaning, despondent\r\nnote, telling anything but a flattering tale, only varied by an\r\noccasional angry growl, when irregular feeding choked its satiated\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nFrom the aesthetic standpoint uncouth and noisy machines, such as\r\nmowers and reapers, cannot be compared to a lusty team of men with\r\nscythes, in their white shirts, backed by the flowering meadows; or a\r\nsunny field of busy harvesters facing a golden wall of corn, and\r\nleaving behind them the fresh-shorn stubble dotted with sheaves and\r\nnicely balanced shocks. The rattle of the machines, too, is discordant\r\nand out of harmony with the peaceful countryside.\r\n\r\nIt is related of Ruskin that, hearing the insistent rattle of a mowing\r\nmachine in a meadow adjoining his home by the beautiful Coniston\r\nWater, and his sense of the fitting being outraged, he interviewed the\r\nowner, and, by an offer to pay the trifling difference between machine\r\nand hand labour, induced him to discontinue the annoyance.\r\n\r\nAs to the relative cost of machine and hand wheat-cutting, quite early\r\nin my farming I obtained the opinion of a distinguished farmer, then\r\nwell known on the Council of the Royal Agricultural Society, Mr.\r\nCharles Randell, of Chadbury, near Evesham, on the subject: \"If you\r\ncan get a good crop,\" he said, \"cut, tied, and stocked by hand at\r\nanything like 15s. an acre, don't use a machine. If the corn is ripe\r\nit knocks out and wastes quite a bushel of wheat per acre\" (worth at\r\nthat time about 5s., now nearer 9s. or 10s.). \"I always bring out my\r\nmachines, and have them oiled and made ready, _but I don't want to use\r\nthem_.\"\r\n\r\nIn a wet harvest the machine is unworkable on sticky clay soil, and\r\nafter a wet summer, when the corn is badly laid and twisted, it makes\r\nvery poor work, cutting off the ears and scattering them, and leaving\r\na quantity of uncut and untidy straw on the ground.\r\n\r\nIn my own case my equanimity was never disturbed by a reaping machine,\r\nwith its unwieldy tossing arms, on my land, for I had to find\r\nemployment for my full staff of regular hands, specially required for\r\nthe much more important hop-picking a little later, and it pleased me\r\nthat they should get the extra pay for harvest work as well.\r\n\r\nThe cream separator, I admit, is a wonderful invention, and its hum is\r\nnot unmusical; it provides fresh skim milk for the calves and pigs\r\nmorning and night, which, as well as the cream, is thoroughly cleansed\r\nin the process. The aeration of the skim milk leaves it a most\r\nwholesome and nourishing article of diet for the villagers if they\r\ncould be made to understand its value, and that the removal of the\r\ncream takes away only the fat (heating material), leaving the bone and\r\nmuscle making constituents in the milk. I could never induce my\r\nvillage folk to accept this rudimentary proposition; they fancied that\r\nall the goodness was gone with the cream, and though I offered the\r\nskim milk at the nominal price of one halfpenny a quart, very few\r\nwould send their children to fetch it, though they mostly lived within\r\na hundred yards of the dairy.\r\n\r\nThe hay or straw elevator is one of the greatest helps, saving much\r\nheavy overhand labour in rick-building. An old labourer, pointing to\r\none, with great appreciation, on a farm I was visiting, said:\r\n\"_That's_ a machine as will be always kept in the dry and took care\r\non.\" He spoke from experience of the arduous work of unloading and the\r\npassing of heavy weights, sometimes from the bed of the waggon to the\r\nsummit of the rick; for, as my bailiff often said, \"Nobody knows so\r\nwell where the shoe pinches as the man who has to wear it.\"\r\n\r\nSteam has not done all that was expected of it as an agricultural\r\nslave. The steam plough is not a success on heavy land where the\r\nridges are high and irregular in width, and even the steam cultivator\r\nhas to be used with caution lest the soil should be carried from the\r\nridges to the furrows, and the \"squitch\" (couch) buried to a depth at\r\nwhich it is difficult to eradicate. The great convenience of steam\r\ncultivation is that full advantage can be taken of a short spell of\r\nhot, dry weather for fallowing operations, and the soil is left so\r\nhollow that it soon bakes and kills the weeds. I fully sympathize with\r\nTennyson's, _Northern Farmer, Old Style:_\r\n\r\n     \"But summon 'ull come ater meä mayhap wi' 'is kittle o' steäm\r\n     Huzzin' an' maäzin' the blessed feälds wi' the Devil's oän teäm\";\r\n\r\nfor, except on a large farm with immense fields, the ponderous and\r\nungainly steam, tackle gives one a sensation of intrusion. Such a\r\nfield can be found on a farm between Evesham and Alcester; it contains\r\n300 acres. The occupier, speaking of it, mentioned that it was all\r\nwheat that year except one corner. To a question as to the size of the\r\ncorner, it transpired that it was 50 acres, and growing peas. For\r\ncomparison there is a story of a Devonshire farmer who said he had\r\nbeen very busy one winter making four fields into one. \"Then you've\r\ngot a big field,\" said a friend. \"Yes,\" was the reply; \"it's just four\r\nacres.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the farm labourer was enfranchised in 1885 he became an important\r\nmember of the electorate. Candidates and canvassers alike had a much\r\nmore strenuous time than ever before, the former were constrained to\r\nhold meetings in every village, and the latter were obliged to visit\r\nnearly every cottage. The late Sir Richard Temple after a\r\ndistinguished career in India, became Conservative candidate for our\r\ndivision. The doctrine of \"three acres and a cow,\" in opposition to\r\nevery tenet of rural economy, as well as the division of the land\r\namong the labourers, were at the time paraded by theorists and paid\r\nagitators, as bribes to purchase the votes of the new electors, and as\r\nensuring the salvation of the rural population, which was then\r\nbeginning to suffer from unemployment, resulting from the destruction\r\nof corn-growing by foreign competition.\r\n\r\nThe more credulous of the labourers were excited and unsettled by the\r\nalluring prospect of independence thus held out to them, and it was\r\nreported that some went so far as to survey the fields around their\r\nvillages and select the plots they proposed to cultivate, and that\r\nothers took baskets to the poll in which to bring home the\r\nall-powerful magic of the mysterious vote! Among the new voters in a\r\nneighbouring village, a man of very decided views found it puzzling to\r\ndecide by which candidate they were most nearly represented, and,\r\ndetermined to make no mistake at the poll, he consulted a\r\nfellow-labourer, inquiring: \"Which way be the big uns a-going, because\r\nI be agin they?\"\r\n\r\nThe Squire of an adjoining parish met an old villager with whom he had\r\nalways been on good terms; after mutual greetings, the man\r\nsympathised: \"I _be_ sorry for you, Squire.\" \"Why?\" was the rejoinder.\r\n\"Yes, I be regular sorry for you, Squire, that I be..\" \"What's the\r\nmatter?\" asked the Squire. \"Ay! about this here land; 'tis to be\r\ndivided amongst we working men.\" \"Indeed,\" said the Squire; \"but look\r\nhere, after a bit, some of you won't want to cultivate it any longer,\r\nand some, with improvident habits, will sell their plots to others, so\r\nthat soon it will be all back again into the hands of a few; what will\r\nyou do then?\" The man looked puzzled, scratched his head, and\r\ncogitated deeply, until a simple solution presented itself: \"Then,\r\nSquire,\" said he, \"we shall divide again!\"\r\n\r\nSir Richard Temple was undoubtedly an able man, but he was a complete\r\nstranger to the local conditions of the constituency. The villagers of\r\nBadsey especially, as well as of other adjoining parishes, were just\r\nbeginning to retrieve their position, threatened by the collapse of\r\ncorn-growing and consequent unemployment, by the adoption of\r\nmarket-gardening and fruit-growing. The land, run down and full of\r\nweeds and rubbish, had been cut up into allotments and offered to them\r\nas tenants, their only choice lying between years of hard work in\r\nredeeming its condition or emigration. Many young men chose the\r\nlatter, and did well in the States of America; but where there was a\r\nwife and young children that course was scarcely possible, and the man\r\nbecame an allotment tenant. Passing one of these on a plot full of\r\n\"squitch,\" which he was laboriously breaking up with a fork to expose\r\nit in big clods to a baking sun, I asked if he had taken it. \"Well,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I don't know whether I've taken _it_ or it's taken _me_!\"\r\n\r\nThese men, by unceasing labour and self-denial, were just beginning to\r\nturn the corner; they had cleaned the land, ameliorated its mechanical\r\ncondition by application of soot and by deep digging with their\r\nbeloved forks, and, having discovered how wonderfully asparagus\r\nnourished on this deep, rich soil, had planted large areas, as well as\r\nplum-trees and other market-garden crops, and the well-merited return\r\nwas coming in increasingly year by year.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Temple did not understand the difference between the small\r\nholder, growing corn and ordinary crops in less favoured parts of the\r\ncountrymen the one hand, and market-gardeners in the Vale of Evesham,\r\nwith its early climate, splendid soil, and railway connection with\r\nhuge artisan populations, delivering the produce with punctuality and\r\ndespatch, on the other. He considered that small holders could not\r\nmake an economic success where the farmers had failed, and had made\r\nhis views well known in the constituency, but he did not distinguish\r\nbetween the small holder and the market-gardener.\r\n\r\nThe men of Badsey felt aggrieved, they knew better, and at a meeting\r\nhe held in the village they gave him a rather noisy hearing, with\r\ninterruptions such as, \"Keep off them steel farks,\" \"Mind them steel\r\nfarks, Sir Richard,\" and so on.\r\n\r\nSir Richard came to ask for my support and assistance in our village,\r\nand, as I was not at home, my wife entertained him in my absence, with\r\ntea and wedding-cake. She innocently asked if he had come to canvass\r\nme; her straightforward query surprised him, but, after a moment's\r\nhesitation, he replied cautiously: \"Well, something of that sort.\"\r\n\r\nHe was eventually returned, and the men of Badsey continued to\r\nflourish on asparagus-growing in spite of his warnings; new houses\r\nsprang up in every direction, and available labour grew scarcer and\r\nscarcer. Those splendid asparagus \"sticks\" or \"buds,\" as they are\r\ncalled, tied with osier or withy twigs, which may be seen in Covent\r\nGarden Market and the large fruiterers' shops in Regent Street, are\r\ngrown in and around the parishes of Badsey and Aldington. They command\r\nhigh prices, up to 15s. and 20s. a hundred for special stuff, and this\r\nyear (1919) I see that £21 was realized for the champion hundred at\r\nthe Badsey Asparagus Show. That, of course, must be regarded as quite\r\nexceptional, and possibly there were special considerations which made\r\nit worth the money to the purchaser.\r\n\r\nLater came difficulties; after successive dry summers the asparagus\r\nwas attacked by a fungoid complaint, called by the growers \"rust.\"\r\nInstead of growing vigorously after the crop had been gathered--which\r\nis the time when the buds for next year's crop are developing on the\r\ncrowns of the plants--and finally dying off naturally in beautiful\r\nfeathery plumes of green and gold, it presented a dingy and rusty\r\nappearance, eventually turning black. Asparagus cannot stand\r\nlong-continued summer and autumn drought; it likes plenty of moisture,\r\nin free circulation but not stagnant. The crops that followed the\r\nappearance I have described were very deficient, proving that the\r\ngrowing season of one year's foliage is the time when next year's crop\r\nis decided.\r\n\r\nThe growth of asparagus is still a very important part of the\r\nmarket-gardener's business in the parishes referred to, but it does\r\nnot continue to produce the best results indefinitely and continuously\r\non the same land, and the growers have been obliged to extend their\r\nacreages and take fresh plots. I have little doubt that with the\r\nscientific application of artificial fertilizers the yield would\r\ncontinue satisfactory for a much longer period. Plant disease of any\r\nkind is nearly always due to starvation for want of the chemical\r\nconstituents upon which the crop feeds, though sometimes caused by\r\nunhealthy sap, the result of late spring frosts or unsuitable weather.\r\n\r\nThe asparagus-growers relied too much upon soot as a fertilizer; it\r\nhas a marvellous effect upon the mechanical condition of heavy land;\r\nits particles intervene between the particles of the almost impalpable\r\npowder of which clay is composed, and the soil approximates to a\r\nwell-tilled garden plot after a few applications and careful\r\nincorporation, and in the local phraseology, it becomes \"all of a\r\nmyrtle.\" But as plant food soot contains nitrogen only, a great plant\r\nstimulant, which quickly exhausts the soil of the other necessary\r\nconstituents. If the growers would make use of basic slag,\r\nsuperphosphate, or bone dust to replace the phosphate of lime removed\r\nby the crop, and of potash in one of its available forms, they would\r\nsoon experience a great improvement in the power of their asparagus to\r\nresist disease and deterioration.\r\n\r\nI am aware that some of the smaller growers regard all kinds of\r\nartificial fertilizers with suspicion, but they may be interested,\r\nshould they ever read these pages, in the following story. When\r\nPeruvian guano was first introduced into this country, the farmers\r\ncould not be persuaded that it merited any reliance as a manure. The\r\nimporters, in despair, caused some of the despised stuff to be sown in\r\nthe form of huge letters spelling the word \"FOOLS\" upon a bare\r\nhillside, visible from a great distance. The following spring, with\r\nthe beginning of growth, and throughout the summer, the word stared\r\nthe farmers in the face whenever they chanced to look that way, in\r\ndark green outstanding characters upon the yellow background; after\r\nthis practical demonstration there was no difficulty in finding\r\npurchasers.\r\n\r\nSir Richard Temple was opposed by Mr. Arthur Chamberlain, one at least\r\nof whose canvassers was not above stretching a point to obtain the\r\nvotes of the labourers. My men told me that they had been promised\r\nroast beef and plum pudding every day of their lives should the\r\nLiberal party be returned. These tactics were again resorted to in the\r\nelection of 1906, when walls were placarded with pictures of the\r\nChinese employed in the gold-mines of the Transvaal, driven in chains\r\nby cruel overseers, presumably representing the Conservative\r\nGovernment which had sanctioned their employment. I know from what I\r\nheard in my new home, for I was no longer at Aldington, that this\r\nmisrepresentation decided the votes of many of the more ignorant\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY THREE VICARS--CHURCH RESTORATION--CHURCHWARDEN EXPERIENCES--\r\nCLERICAL AND OTHER STORIES.\r\n\r\n     \"Where many a generation's prayer,\r\n     Hath perfumed and hath blessed the air.\"\r\n                                             --GLADSTONE.\r\n\r\nI saw a good deal of my three successive Vicars, for I was Vicar's\r\nchurchwarden for a period of nearly twenty years, and was treasurer of\r\nthe fund for the restoration and enlargement of Badsey Church. My\r\nfirst Vicar had held the living for over thirty years when we decided\r\nupon this important undertaking; and not wishing to be burdened with\r\nthe correspondence which the work would entail, he invited me to act\r\nfor him. I was pleased, because I have always been interested in the\r\narchitecture of old buildings, especially churches, and readily\r\nundertook the post. I had the constant and intimate co-operation of my\r\nco-warden, Mr. Julius Sladden, of Badsey, and I may say that no two\r\npeople ever worked together with greater harmony.\r\n\r\nThe restoration had been debated for many years; the ancient church\r\nwas sadly dilapidated, and disfigured by an ugly gallery at the west\r\nend of the nave, which obscured the finest arch in the building,\r\nleading into the tower; and the incident which brought the matter\r\nwithin the range of possibility was romantic. The Vicar succeeded\r\nquite unexpectedly to a large inheritance; the news reached him and\r\nhis wife, who was away from home at the time, simultaneously. The\r\nletters they wrote to each other on their good fortune crossed in the\r\npost, and characteristically each wrote \"Badsey Church must now be\r\nrestored.\" Soon afterwards the Vicar came to my house and, sitting\r\ndown at my table, wrote me a cheque for £500 to start the fund.\r\n\r\nOn the advice of the patrons of the living--the Dean and Chapter of\r\nChrist Church, Oxford--we invited Mr. Thomas Graham Jackson, now Sir\r\nThomas Graham Jackson, R.A., to undertake the duties of architect. His\r\nwork was well known at Oxford at the time, as the beautiful New\r\nSchools had just been completed from his designs; we were also most\r\nfortunate in obtaining the services of Mr. Thomas Collins, of\r\nTewkesbury, as builder. Mr. Collins was devoted to church\r\narchitecture, and the financial consideration of such work was to him\r\nquite secondary to the pleasure he experienced as a connoisseur in\r\nrestoring to the dignity and beauty of the past any ecclesiastical\r\nbuilding of distinguished interest. The first estimate was, I think,\r\n£1,500, exclusive of architect's fees, but when the work was completed\r\nwe had expended in all a sum of over £2,130. We did not finally clear\r\noff the debt until 1894, nine years after the reopening of the church,\r\nand since then a considerable further sum has been expended in\r\nrehanging the old bells and adding two new ones to make up the full\r\npeal of eight.\r\n\r\nIt was delightful to experience the willingness of everybody to help;\r\nsubscriptions, large and small, came in readily at the very outset,\r\nand this part of the work never became arduous until the last few\r\nhundreds had to be raised. Most of us experienced the truth of the\r\nproverb _Bis dat qui cito dat_, but in a different sense from that\r\nwhich usually commends it, for many who gave quickly not only\r\nliterally gave twice, but three times or more. Bazaars, concerts, and\r\nentertainments of all kinds were undertaken by the parishioners, a sum\r\nof £376 being raised by these means. Among them a bazaar at Badsey\r\nrealized £130; another, later, at Aldington in one of my old barns,\r\n£80; and two concerts--afternoon and evening--at Malvern, organized by\r\nmy wife and her sister, Miss Poulton, £100.\r\n\r\nThe Vicar received a notable letter from the late Lord Salisbury, the\r\nPremier; they had been at Eton and Christ Church together, and Lord\r\nSalisbury was godfather to the Vicar's eldest son. The Vicar had\r\nwritten of the fortune he had inherited, and spoke of some rooks as\r\nhaving brought the luck by building, for the first time, in an\r\nelm-tree in the vicarage grounds. Lord Salisbury, in sending a\r\ndonation of £25 to the restoration fund, added: \"I see a great many\r\nrooks building near my house\" (Hatfield), \"but the luck has not come\r\nto me yet.\" The Vicar's comment to me was: \"If the luck has not yet\r\ncome to Lord Salisbury, I don't see how anyone can hope for it!\"\r\n\r\nThe Malvern concert was a strenuous undertaking; Badsey being a long\r\nway from Malvern, it was necessary to interest the inhabitants and to\r\nsome extent to plead _in forma pauperis_, for we were really a poor\r\nparish without any large resident landowners. The first thing was to\r\nget a good list of influential local patrons; and as soon as Lady\r\nEmily Foley consented, the promoters felt that the work was half done.\r\nLady Emily Foley was supreme at Malvern, a very distinguished old lady\r\nand most popular, but perhaps a little alarming.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the two concerts I was detailed with a troop of young\r\nmen, relatives of the patrons, to conduct the people to their seats,\r\nand an elaborate plan of the large Assembly Room was given me, with\r\nminute particulars of the lettered rows and numbered seats, presenting\r\nthe appearance, somewhat, of a labyrinth. I was studying it at the\r\ndoors, and arranging with the young stewards as to their individual\r\nfunctions, when I heard an alarmed exclamation from one of them: \"Look\r\nout! here comes Lady Emily Foley!\" In an instant the whole crowd took\r\nto their heels and disappeared down the corridor. With some little\r\ndifficulty I succeeded in finding the seats of Lady Emily Foley's\r\nparty, but I could see that she regarded me as a rather feeble\r\ncicerone.\r\n\r\nShe was, however, exceedingly gracious after my wife's first solo,\r\nwhich pleased her so much that we had to make an exception in this\r\ncase, and allow an encore by her special request, though it had been\r\narranged, owing to the length of the programme, that no encores were\r\nto be given. Lady Alwyne Compton, wife of the Dean of Worcester, very\r\nkindly assisted as a performer, my wife having frequently sung at\r\ncharity concerts and entertainments for her in Worcester and the\r\nneighbourhood, among them a recital by Mr. Brandram of _A\r\nMidsummer-Night's Dream_, when she undertook the soprano solos\r\noccurring in the play, at the Worcester Guildhall. Lady Alwyne Compton\r\nwas very musical, and rehearsals were held in the stone-vaulted crypt\r\nbeneath the Deanery, a place of splendid acoustic properties, which\r\nintensified the sound without coarsening it, and brought the voice\r\nback to the singer in a way unknown on the usual platform, decorated\r\nwith screens, curtains, and flags, and obstructed by floral\r\nimpedimenta.\r\n\r\nAmong the performers at the Malvern concerts some professionals had\r\nbeen engaged from London, including Miss Margaret Wild, a well-known\r\npianist. I had given my men a holiday for the occasion and was anxious\r\nto hear their opinion of the performances. They considered the music\r\nrather too high class for them, but they thoroughly appreciated the\r\nnimble fingers of Miss Margaret Wild; one of them adding\r\nenthusiastically: \"My word, her did make 'im (the piano) rottle!\" Our\r\nold parish clerk too, at the time over eighty years of age, who walked\r\nthree miles to Evesham Station in the morning, ascended the\r\nWorcestershire Beacon--nearly 1,500 feet--and finally walked back from\r\nEvesham to Badsey at night, was much struck by the recitations of Miss\r\nIsabel Bateman at the concert. The dear old man was somewhat deaf, and\r\ntold me that, sitting towards the back of the room, \"I couldn't hear\r\nnothing, but I could see as the gesters [gestures] was all right.\"\r\n\r\nThis old clerk was prominently devout in the church responses, and had\r\nsome original pronunciations of unusual words; in the Nicene Creed he\r\ngenerally followed a few bars, so to speak, behind the Vicar, but one\r\nnever failed to catch the words \"apost'lick church\" towards the end.\r\nHe was very scornful of ghosts, and told me that he had been about the\r\nchurchyard very often at night for fifty years without seeing anything\r\nlike an apparition. But the whole village was alarmed, including the\r\nclerk, one Sunday when, about midnight, the tenor bell was heard\r\nsolemnly tolling. The clerk, with some supporters and a lantern,\r\nunlocked the door, and found the village idiot--silly C.--in the tower\r\nringing the bell. It appeared that, after service, the clerk had\r\nextinguished the lights and locked up for the night about eight\r\no'clock. C., who had gone to sleep in the gallery with his head upon\r\nhis arms before him on the desk, slumbered on until he woke in alarm\r\nsome four hours later, to find himself alone and the church in total\r\ndarkness, but he was intelligent enough to remember the bell and get\r\nhis release.\r\n\r\nC. had a hand-to-hand fight in the church tower with Aldington's\r\nspecial imbecile. After service the clerk invited me to the scene of\r\nthe battle, pointing out some crimson traces on the stone pavement. I\r\ncalled upon our imbecile's parents on my way home, and the old father\r\nwas greatly shocked. \"Here he be, sir,\" he said; \"I hope you'll give\r\nhim a jolly good hiding.\" I told him I could hardly undertake the rôle\r\nof executioner on a Sunday, in cold blood, and contented myself with a\r\nsevere reprimand.\r\n\r\nI was handing the collecting-bag one morning after service, and\r\nfinding it did not return from the end of the row of chairs as quickly\r\nas usual, I discovered this same individual with his hand _in the\r\nbag_. I signed to him impatiently to pass it back. After service he\r\ncame to the vestry and said that he had contributed a florin in\r\nmistake for a penny, and was trying to retrieve it. I could generally\r\nestimate pretty accurately the amount of the collection, as I handed\r\nthe bag, knowing the extent of each person's usual gift, and sure\r\nenough, there was an extra florin among the coins, with which I sent\r\nhim away happy.\r\n\r\nThe parish must have been an uncivilized place in former times; there\r\nwas an accusing record beneath the west window of the tower, in the\r\nshape of a blocked up entrance. I was told that the ringers, not\r\nwishing to enter or leave the tower through the church door during\r\nservice, and also to facilitate the smuggling in of unlimited cider\r\nhad, after strenuous efforts, cut an opening through the ancient wall\r\nand base some feet in thickness, and that the achievement was\r\nannounced to the village by uproarious cheering when at last they\r\nsucceeded. A door was afterwards fitted to the aperture, but the\r\nentrance was abolished later by a more reverent Vicar.\r\n\r\nThe belfry was decorated with various bones of legs of mutton and of\r\njoints of beef, hung up to commemorate notable weddings of prominent\r\nparishioners--perhaps, too, as a hint to future aspirants to the state\r\nof matrimony--when the ringers had enjoyed a substantial meal and\r\ngallons of cider at the expense of the bridegroom. There seems to have\r\nbeen a traditional connection between church bell-ringing and thirst,\r\nfor Gilbert White relates that when the bells of Selborne Church were\r\nrecast and a new one presented in 1735, \"The day of the arrival of\r\nthis tuneable peal was observed as an high festival by the village,\r\nand rendered more joyous by an order from the donor that the treble\r\nbell should be fixed bottom upward in the ground and filled with\r\npunch, of which all present were permitted to partake.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vicar of Badsey told me that at the neighbouring church of\r\nWickhamford, then also in his jurisdiction, that when he first came,\r\nin the early fifties, it was customary, as the men entered the church\r\nby the chancel door, to pitch their hats in a heap on the altar. Also\r\nthat on his home-coming with his bride, he was, the same evening,\r\nrequisitioned to put a stop to a fight between two drunken reprobates\r\noutside the vicarage gate. Badsey people can in these modern times\r\npoint with pride to a much higher standard of civilization, and they\r\nfully recognize that \"'Eave 'alf a brick at his 'ead; Bill,\" is a\r\nmethod of welcome to a stranger not considered precisely etiquette at\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nThere was no vestry before the restoration of Badsey Church; the\r\nVicar's surplice might be seen hanging over the side of one of the\r\nsquare pews which obstructed the chancel, and when the Vicar appeared\r\nhe was followed by the clerk, who assisted at the public ceremony of\r\nrobing. Church decorations at Christmas consisted at that time of\r\nsprigs of holly stuck upright in holes bored along the tops of the pew\r\npartitions at regular intervals, and at the harvest thanksgiving an\r\nhistoric miniature rick of corn annually made its appearance on the\r\naltar. In those days, however, flowers, which are scarcely suitable\r\nfor a festival where the decorations should proclaim the abundance of\r\nthe matured season of growth, by corn and fruit, were not included. I\r\nhave seen too many of these, to the exclusion of corn, in modern town\r\nchurches, and even wild oats, which, though very pretty, are not\r\nexactly typical of thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how much damage may be done to valuable old woodwork\r\nby an enthusiastic band of decorators, assisted by an indiscriminating\r\ncurate, and how inharmonious may be the general effect of individual\r\nlabours--though charming taken separately--where a comprehensive\r\nscheme is neglected. I have counted fourteen differing reds--not tones\r\nor shades of the same colour--including the hood of the officiating\r\nclergyman, in one chancel at the same time, bewildering to the eye and\r\ndistracting to the mind. And I once saw a beautiful and priceless old\r\nElizabethan table in a vestry, covered with a mouldy piece of purple\r\nvelvet secured with tin-tacks driven into the tortured oak. There are,\r\nor were, two lovely old Chippendale chairs with the characteristic\r\nbacks and legs inside the altar-rails of Badsey Church; they are\r\nvaluable and no doubt duly appreciated, not only for their own sake,\r\nbut because they were the gift of dear old Barnard, the clerk, who\r\nspent fifty years of his life in the service of the church.\r\n\r\nI once heard a curate preaching to an agricultural congregation at a\r\nharvest thanksgiving after a disastrous season, when the earth had not\r\nyielded much by way of increase, remarking that in such a time of\r\nscarcity we might be thankful that plenty of foreign corn would be\r\navailable; good theology, perhaps, but scarcely expedient under the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nWe found Sir Thomas Graham Jackson a purist in the matter of church\r\nrestoration, and in my capacity as churchwarden and treasurer, I was\r\nfortunate in having to confer with a man of such pre-eminent good\r\ntaste. He would not allow some new oak panels, with which we had to\r\nsupplement the old linen-pattern panels of the pulpit, to be coloured\r\nto match the old work. \"Time,\" he said, \"will bring them all\r\ntogether.\" Possibly the lapse of two hundred years may do so, but I\r\nsaw at once that he was right in the principle that no sham should be\r\ntolerated in honest work, more especially in a sacred building. We\r\nobjected also to a new chimney which surmounted the junction of the\r\nnave and choir exteriorly: it seemed to smack of domestic detail; but\r\nhere again he satisfied us by saying that, as heating the building was\r\na modern necessity, there was no reason to be ashamed of such an\r\nindispensable addition. As a matter of fact, this chimney long ago\r\nbecame nicely toned down by its native soot, and is practically\r\nunnoticeable.\r\n\r\nThere is much American oak, I believe, now used in new churches and\r\npublic buildings; it appears to resemble chestnut much more than\r\nEnglish oak, and I doubt whether it will ever acquire the beautiful\r\ntone which time confers upon the latter. It should, however, be\r\nrecognized that much of the depth of colour of old oak panelling is\r\nreally nothing but dirt, though the true dark brown tint of old age\r\ncan be found underneath, and right to the centre of each piece.\r\nSpring-cleaning of the past consisted very much in polishing with\r\nbeeswax and turpentine, without removing the dirt produced by smoky\r\nfires and constant handling, so that extraneous matter became coated\r\nwith the polish and preserved beneath it. I have had occasion, when\r\nrestoring old woodwork, to wash off this outside accretion, and when\r\nremoved, the tone of the wood remained still dark, though lighter than\r\nbefore it lost its black and somewhat sticky appearance.\r\n\r\nThe fakers of sham old furniture produce the intense darkness by\r\nstains of various kinds. I once found myself at an inn in Devonshire\r\nwhich contained a quantity of \"delft\" and \"antique oak\" furniture for\r\nsale. While the attendant was bringing me some refreshment, I tested\r\nthe genuineness of the oak by a small chip with my pocket-knife, and,\r\nas I anticipated, found perfectly white wood under the surface, and, I\r\nbelieve, American oak. The irony of the transaction is striking; here\r\nwas a piece of wood imported from the States only a few months before,\r\nconverted in this country into Elizabethan, Jacobean, and Stuart\r\nfurniture, and then, it may be, bought by American visitors and taken\r\nback to their own country.\r\n\r\nSome years before the church restoration could be taken in hand, a\r\npiece of land, bordering the west side of the churchyard, and between\r\nit and the highroad, and another similar piece on the east side of the\r\nchurchyard, were offered for sale by auction. They belonged to the old\r\nBadsey Manor property and of course occupied important positions lying\r\nin each case just between the churchyard and the adjoining roads. An\r\nindividual who had fallen out with the Vicar announced his intention\r\nof purchasing these pieces and building cottages and a public-house\r\nupon them, presumably \"to spite the parson.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vicar at once saw the absolute necessity of acquiring the land for\r\nthe church and enclosing it with suitable walls, as an addition to the\r\nchurchyard. It would have been a terrible eyesore from the village\r\nstreet if ugly brick and blue-slated buildings were erected in front\r\nof the beautiful old grey church, and the idea of an inn in such a\r\nplace was intolerable. He consulted the patrons of the living, who\r\nagreed to help, and simultaneously a good old aunt gave him leave to\r\nbid up to a certain sum on her behalf as a gift to the parish.\r\n\r\nThe patrons sent a representative to the sale with an undisclosed\r\nprice, at which he was empowered to make the purchase. Absolute\r\nsecrecy was preserved, and, except the Vicar, no one knew the man or\r\nwhom he represented; he was to leave the train from Oxford at\r\nHoneybourne Station so as not even to come through Evesham to Badsey.\r\nThe Vicar had arranged that the patrons' representative should also\r\nbid on behalf of the aunt, but did not disclose the limit. The man was\r\nnot to bid until the Vicar himself stopped, and he was to go on\r\nbidding until the Vicar removed a rose from his button-hole, which\r\nwould signify that the aunt's limit was reached. Whether the patrons'\r\nrepresentative could go any further or not, the Vicar did not know.\r\n\r\nBefore the auction the two did not meet, and they sat apart during the\r\nproceedings. The village malcontent was in great form, making certain\r\nof success, and was delighted when the Vicar apparently gave up\r\nbidding as if beaten. The rose was still in his button-hole, but\r\nbefore long the aunt's limit was reached, and it had to be removed; he\r\nwas however relieved to find that the patrons' representative\r\ncontinued to bid. His opponent was getting very fidgety as the price\r\nrose, hesitating for some moments every time the bidding was against\r\nhim. Just as the hammer was about to fall he would arrest it with,\r\n\"Try 'im again,\" but the stranger instantly capped his reluctant bid,\r\nalways leaving him to consider a further advance in great discomfort.\r\nAt last in despair but quite certain that the Vicar at any rate was\r\nknocked out he gave up, exclaiming, \"'E med 'ave it, 'e med 'ave it\";\r\nand the hammer fell. All eyes were fixed upon the unknown bidder, and\r\nthe auctioneer demanded \"the name of the buyer\"; very quietly came the\r\nannouncement, \"The Dean and Chapter of Christ Church.\" Horribly\r\ndisgusted the malcontent fired a parting shot as he reached the door:\r\n\"If I'd a-knowed the pairson was a goin' to 'ave it, I'd a made 'im\r\npay a pretty penny more nor that.\"\r\n\r\nThis Vicar was a very impressive reader, especially of dramatic\r\nstories from the Old Testament. As he read the account of the\r\ndiscomfiture of the priests of Baal by the Prophet Elijah one could\r\nvisualize the scene. Elijah's dripping sacrifice blazing to the skies,\r\nthe priests of Baal, mutilated by their own knives and lancets, in\r\nvain imploring their god to send the fire to vindicate himself. The\r\nheavens were black, and one could hear the rush of Ahab's chariot, the\r\nroar of the thunder and the hissing torrent of rain, and see the\r\nprophet running swiftly before him. The Vicar, however, was not an\r\nactor like a clergyman I was told of, who got so excited over Agag and\r\nhis delicate approach to Samuel that he could not resist an\r\nillustration to intensify the action by taking a mincing step or two\r\naside from the lectern.\r\n\r\nNo village is complete without its curmudgeon or self-appointed\r\ngrumbler, just as every village has its special imbecile. The\r\ncurmudgeon originates in a class above the idiot; very often he is an\r\nex-churchwarden, guardian, way-warden, or other official, who has\r\nresigned in dudgeon or been ousted from his post for some neglect or\r\nfailure. He is a man with whom the world has gone wrong, a sufferer,\r\nperhaps, from some disaster which has become an obsession. He views\r\neverything with distorted eyesight; nothing pleases him, and he wants\r\nto put everybody right. He cherishes a perpetual grievance against\r\nsome individual or clique for a fancied slight, and goes about trying\r\nto stir up ill-feeling among the ignorant by malicious insinuations.\r\nIn former times he was an adept at \"parson-baiting\" at the annual\r\nEaster vestry meeting, when he would air his grievance against the\r\nVicar of the parish or any person in authority.\r\n\r\nAt these vestries the Vicar is wise if he declares the curmudgeon to\r\nbe \"out of order,\" and declines to hear him, for, legally, the\r\nbusiness does not include any matter which does not appear upon the\r\nnotice convening the meeting, signed by the Vicar and churchwardens.\r\nThis usually announces that churchwardens will be elected and the\r\naccounts produced; the latter, since church rates were abolished, is\r\nnot obligatory, and only subscribers have a right to question them.\r\nThe proceedings are not legal unless three _full_ days have elapsed\r\nsince the publication of the notice on a Sunday before morning\r\nservice, the following Thursday being thus the earliest day on which\r\nthe meeting can take place. It is important to remember that no\r\nchurchwarden has a legal status before he has been formally admitted\r\nby the Archdeacon.\r\n\r\nIn former times, before the creation of Parish, District and County\r\nCouncils, the curmudgeon, after the reaction of the winter months,\r\nbecame very prominent towards the time of the Easter vestry, when he\r\nwould appear, having enlisted a small band of supporters, with a\r\nnumber of grievances relating to rates, parish officials, rights of\r\nway, footpaths, and such-like debatable subjects. Of course, he should\r\nhave been promptly squashed by the chairman, but too often an\r\nindulgent Vicar would allow him to have his fling.\r\n\r\nNow, however, the curmudgeon can easily get himself elected upon one\r\nof the numerous councils; having mismanaged his own affairs until he\r\nhas none left to manage, he appears to regard himself as a fit and\r\nproper person to mismanage the business of other people, and the brief\r\nauthority which his position confers gives him a welcome opportunity\r\nof letting off superfluous steam.\r\n\r\nParishioners sometimes combined and elected an unpopular person to a\r\ntroublesome post which nobody wanted. Such was the office of\r\nway-warden, under whose jurisdiction came the management and repair of\r\nparish roads, superintending and paying the roadmen, and keeping the\r\nnecessary records and accounts. A market-gardener, a canny Scot, who\r\nhad fallen into disfavour, had this office thrust upon him much\r\nagainst his will. Once elected, the victim had no choice in the\r\nmatter, and, being a very busy man, he was thoroughly annoyed. He soon\r\ndiscovered a weapon wherewith to avenge the wrong--one which his\r\nopponents had put into his hands themselves; during his year of office\r\nhe restricted the road repairs to a lane adjoining his own land,\r\nleading to the railway-station, which his carts traversed many times\r\ndaily. He gave it a thorough good coat of stones, and all the\r\navailable labour, as well as the cash chargeable on the rates of the\r\nparish, was in this way expended, chiefly for his own benefit, though\r\nthe parish shared to the extent of the use they made of this\r\nparticular piece of road. Great was the outcry, but nothing could be\r\ndone till the year of office expired, and, naturally, he was never\r\nelected again.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of the land adjoining the churchyard had a remarkable\r\nsequel; it was conveyed to the Vicar and churchwardens for the time\r\nbeing, these original churchwardens having been long out of the office\r\nbefore my appointment. After the restoration of the church my\r\nco-warden and I, with the Vicar's consent, levelled the rough places\r\nin the neglected churchyard, sowed it with grass seeds, and planted\r\nvarious ornamental shrubs; we had the untidy southern boundary\r\ncarefully dug over, and set a man to plant a yew-hedge. He was thus\r\nemployed when a parishioner appeared in some excitement, and objected\r\nto the planting of yew on account of possible damage to sheep grazing\r\nin the churchyard, claiming the right--which, as a matter of fact,\r\nbelonged to the Vicar alone, though never exercised--to such grazing,\r\njointly with the Vicar. He proceeded to pull up some of the young yews\r\nas a protest, and threw them uprooted on the ground. The man employed\r\nreported the matter to my co-warden, living near, who was very soon at\r\nmy house.\r\n\r\nWe decided to prosecute the offender, and obtained the Vicar's\r\nconsent, he being the legal prosecutor. The case was heard by a bench\r\nof magistrates composed entirely of clergy and churchwarden squires,\r\nwho naturally sympathized with us, and, quite logically, convicted the\r\ndefendant in a fine, I think, of about 25s. and costs, or a term in\r\nWorcester Gaol in default. The defendant refused to pay a farthing and\r\nwas removed in custody; but later our dear old Vicar, very generously,\r\ncame forward and paid the amount himself.\r\n\r\nShortly before the church restoration I had a notice to attend an\r\narchidiaconal visitation, and duly appeared at the church at the time\r\narranged. The Archdeacon made a careful inspection of the fabric and\r\nproperty of the church, not too well pleased with its dilapidated\r\nappearance. Nothing much was said till we reached the\r\nfourteenth-century font, showing signs of long use. The Archdeacon\r\nmotioned to the clerk to remove the oak cover, and the old man, with\r\nthe air of an officious waiter, lifted it with a flourish, disclosing,\r\ninside the cracked font, a white pudding-basin, inside which, again,\r\nreposed a species of beetle known as a \"devil's coach-horse.\" The\r\nArchdeacon, peering in and evidently recognizing the insect and its\r\npopular designation, and looking much shocked, exclaimed with some\r\nwarmth: \"Dear me! I should scarcely have expected to find _that_ thing\r\nin a font!\"\r\n\r\nThis story reminds me of a similar visitation depicted in _Punch_. The\r\nArchdeacon was seen at the lych-gate of a country church in company\r\nwith a churchwarden farmer, the Vicar being unable to attend. The\r\ncontrast was well delineated--the Archdeacon tall, thin, and ascetic,\r\nin a long black coat and archidiaconal hat; and the farmer of the John\r\nBull type, in ample breeches and gaiters. The churchyard presented a\r\nmagnificent crop of exuberant wheat:\r\n\r\n_Archdeacon_. I don't like this at all; I shall really have to speak\r\nto the Vicar about it.\r\n\r\n_Churchwarden (thinking of the rotation of crops)_. Just what I told\r\nun, sir--just what I told 'un. \"You keeps on a-wheating of it and\r\na-wheating of it,\" I says; \"why don't you tater it?\" says I.\r\n\r\nAt Badsey objections were soon heard to the innovation of the\r\nsurpliced choir and improved music in the restored church; one old\r\nvillager, living close by, expressed himself as follows concerning the\r\nentry of the Vicar and choir, in procession, from the new vestry:\r\n\r\n     \"They come in with them boys all dressed up like a lot of\r\n     little parsons, and the parson behind 'em just like the old\r\n     Pope hisself. But there ain't no call for me to go to church\r\n     now, for I can set at home and hear 'em a baarlin' [noise\r\n     like a calf] and a harmenin [amening] in me own house.\"\r\n\r\nOn a similar occasion, in another parish where more elaborate music\r\nhad been introduced, an old coachman, given to much devotional musical\r\nenergy, told me as a sore grievance: \"You know, sir, I'd used to like\r\nsingin' a bit myself, but now, as soon as I've worked myself up to a\r\ntidy old pitch, all of a sudden _they_ leaves off, and I be left a\r\nbawlin'!\"\r\n\r\nAmong various special weekday services I remember a Confirmation when\r\nan elderly Aldington parishioner had courageously decided to\r\nparticipate in the rite. She was missing from the ceremony, and told\r\nmy wife afterwards, in answer to inquiries, that a bad headache had\r\nprevented her from attending, adding: \"But there, you can't stand agin\r\nyour 'ead!\"\r\n\r\nI was at the house of a neighbouring Vicar where the Bishop of the\r\ndiocese had been lunching shortly before, when there was a dish of\r\nvery fine oranges on the table and another of Blenheim orange apples.\r\nThe Bishop was offered a Blenheim orange by the Vicar, who remarked\r\nthat they came from his own garden. The Bishop had probably never\r\nheard of a Blenheim orange, and the latter word directed his attention\r\nto the dish of oranges. He examined them with great surprise, and\r\nexclaimed: \"Dear me! I had no idea that oranges would come to such\r\nperfection out of doors in this climate.\"\r\n\r\nA capital story was told by a Bishop of Worcester, in connection with\r\nthe efforts of the Church in that part of the country to alleviate the\r\nlot of the hop-pickers, who flock into Worcestershire in September by\r\nthe thousand. One of the mission workers, who had gone down to the\r\nhopyards, met a dilapidated individual in a country lane, who said he\r\nwas \"a picker.\" Pressed for further particulars, the man responded:\r\n\r\n     \"In the summer I picks peas and fruit; when autumn comes I\r\n     picks hops; in the winter I picks pockets; and when I'm\r\n     caught I picks oakum. I'm kept nice and warm during the cold\r\n     months, and when the fine days come round once more I starts\r\n     pea-picking again.\"\r\n\r\nMy second Vicar was a scholar, an excellent preacher of very condensed\r\nsermons; he conducted the services with great dignity, but his manner\r\nto the villagers was a little alarming. He found the old clerk\r\nsomewhat officious, I think. One evening, after service, when some\r\nstrangers from Evesham attended--for Badsey was a pleasant walk on a\r\nsummer evening--the clerk announced to the Vicar, with great\r\njubilation, that \"the gentleman with the party from Evesham expressed\r\nhimself as very well satisfied with the service.\" No doubt the clerk\r\nhad received a practical proof of the satisfaction. The clerk\r\nimagined, I believe, that he was as much responsible for the conduct\r\nof the services as the Vicar, and thought the latter would be equally\r\npleased with the stranger's commendation. He was disappointed, I fear,\r\nfor the Vicar did not seem in the least impressed, showing, too, some\r\nannoyance at what doubtless appeared to him great presumption.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the Boer War, followed by the Boxers' revolt in China\r\nand the Siege of Peking, when telegrams were exhibited in the\r\npost-office every Sunday morning, I saw one day, on my way to church,\r\nthat Peking had been relieved. The Vicar--my third--preached on the\r\nsubject of the terrors of the siege--his sermon having been written on\r\nthe previous day--and drew a harrowing picture of the fate of the\r\ndefenders. After service I asked if he had not seen the telegram, and\r\ntold him the good news. \"Good gracious!\" said he; \"I _am_ glad I\r\ndidn't know that before the service; what _should_ I have done about\r\nmy sermon?\" I was a little surprised that the delivery of a sermon\r\nwhich was no longer to the point should appear more important than the\r\nannouncement of the happy event; but perhaps the position would have\r\nbeen somewhat undignified had he been obliged to explain, and dismiss\r\nthe congregation with apologies.\r\n\r\nAn elderly Vicar, in a parish in the adjoining county,\r\nGloucestershire, found the morning service with a sermon very\r\nfatiguing, and the patron, the Squire, suggested that the\r\nante-Communion service would be less tiring in place of the latter. He\r\nwas not a very interesting preacher, and the Squire was quite as well\r\npleased as the Vicar when he agreed. There was never a sermon at the\r\nmorning service thereafter.\r\n\r\nOther denominations besides the Church, of course, existed in the\r\nparish and neighbourhood; we did not hear much about them, but the\r\nfollowing story was related as occurring in a neighbouring village. To\r\nsee the point it is necessary to introduce the actors; they consisted\r\nof Daniel S. and Jim H., rival hedgers in the art of \"pleaching,\" of\r\nwhich Joseph Arch was such a notable exponent. Daniel had lately been\r\nemployed upon a job of this kind for a farmer, Mr. (locally Master) R.\r\nThe scene was the room that did duty for a chapel in the village.\r\n\r\nDaniel S. advanced to the reading-desk, and, turning over the leaves\r\nof the Bible to find the Book of Daniel, announced sententiously:\r\n\"Let's see what Dannel done in his dai (day).\" Up jumped Jim H. at the\r\nback of the room: \"Oh, I can tell tha (thee) what Dannel done in his\r\ndai--cut a yedge (hedge) for Master R., and took whome all the best of\r\nthe 'ood (wood)!\"\r\n\r\nA story was current too--nearer home this time--of a grand fete given\r\nto the children. They marched in procession from one village to\r\nanother, in which the tea was to take place, under the leadership of\r\nan ancient parishioner. Of this person it was said that he had\r\nviolated every article of the Decalogue, and that had the number been\r\ntwenty instead of ten he would have treated them with equal\r\nindifference! As the children entered the second village with beaming\r\nfaces and banners waving, as he gave the word of command, they sang in\r\nsweet trebles and in perfect innocence, \"See the mighty host\r\nadvancing, Satan leading on!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHOOL BOARD--RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION--SCHOOL INSPECTIONS--DEAN\r\nFARRAR--COMPULSORY EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n     \"Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much;\r\n     Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.\"\r\n                                             --COWPER.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to Aldington I found that by the energy of the Vicar an\r\nelementary school had been built and equipped, and was working well\r\nunder the voluntary system. I accepted the post of treasurer at his\r\ninvitation, but as time went on financial difficulties arose, as the\r\nEducation Department increased their requirements. The large farmers\r\nwere being gradually ruined by foreign competition, and the small\r\nmarket-gardeners, in occupation of the land as it fell vacant, could\r\nnot be induced to subscribe, although their own children were the sole\r\nbeneficiaries. A voluntary rate was suggested, but met with no general\r\nresponse, one old parishioner announcing that she didn't intend \"to\r\npay no voluntary rate until she was obliged\"!\r\n\r\nMatters were getting desperate when Vicar No. 2 arrived, and it soon\r\nbecame evident that the voluntary system had completely broken down. A\r\nSchool Board was the only alternative, and, as all the old managers\r\nrefused to become members and no one else would undertake the\r\nresponsibility, a deadlock ensued. We were threatened by the Education\r\nDepartment that, failing a Board of parishioners, they would appoint\r\nfor the post any outsiders, non-ratepayers, who could be induced to\r\nvolunteer. The prospect was not a pleasant one, and on the invitation\r\nof a deputation of working men, I agreed to stand (chiefly, perhaps,\r\nin my own interests, as the largest ratepayer in the parish, with the\r\nexception of the Great Western Railway Company), and others eventually\r\ncame forward.\r\n\r\nThe Board was constituted, and we were rather a three-cornered lot: my\r\nco-warden; a boot and shoemaker in Evesham, with land in Badsey; a\r\ncarpenter and small builder; three small market-gardeners and myself.\r\nI was elected chairman, and we obtained the services of an excellent\r\nclerk, who held the same office for the Evesham Board of Guardians--a\r\ncapable man, and well up in the forms and idiosyncrasies of the Board\r\nof Education. Our designation was \"the United District School Board of\r\nBadsey, Aldington, and Wickhamford.\" It was not easy to discover the\r\nqualifications of all the members from an educational point of view;\r\nsome at least represented the village malcontent section, now getting\r\nrather nervous as to School Board rates. And there was a talkative\r\nsection who illustrated the truth of the old proverb, \"It is not the\r\nloudest cackling hen that lays the biggest egg,\" and of, perhaps, the\r\nstill more expressive, \"It's the worst wheel of the waggon that makes\r\nthe most noise.\" One, at any rate, was definitely qualified--\"He\r\nknowed summat about draining!\" The majority were conspicuous as\r\neconomists in the matter of probable school expenditure, and it\r\nappeared later that two, if not three, of the members were unable to\r\nwrite their own names, so that sometimes we could not get the\r\nnecessary number of signatures to the cheques, when some of the more\r\nefficient members happened to be absent.\r\n\r\nEarly in our existence as a United Board, one of the economists made a\r\nlittle speech in which he propounded the theory that \"our first duty\r\nis to the ratepayers\"; but I could not help suggesting that, as a\r\nlegally appointed body, we were bound to obey the law beyond all other\r\nconsiderations, and corrected his dictum, with all respect, by\r\nsubstituting that \"our first duty is to the children.\" I must do him\r\nthe justice to say that he accepted my suggestion in a complimentary\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that it is not always desirable to belong to a\r\nparish grouped with others under a United District School Board.\r\nAldington possessed the largest rateable value with the lowest\r\npopulation, which was about equal to Wickhamford with the lowest\r\nrateable value; and Badsey, with by far the largest population, came\r\nbetween Aldington and Wickhamford as to rateable value--the obvious\r\nresult being that Aldington was called upon to pay an excessive and\r\nunfair share of the cost of educating Badsey's children. We did not,\r\nhowever, want a school in our quiet village; it is something to get\r\nrid of children when inclined to be noisy, so we did not grumble at a\r\nlittle extra expense.\r\n\r\nWe carried on the school at first in the old building, but very soon\r\nthe Department began to press for a larger and better-equipped\r\nestablishment. Many of their requirements we considered unnecessary in\r\na country village, and put off the evil day as long as possible, with\r\nsuch phrases as, \"The matter is under consideration,\" or, \"Will\r\nshortly be brought to the notice of the Board.\" Like \"retribution,\"\r\nhowever, the Education Department, \"though leaden-footed, comes\r\niron-handed,\" and when all other methods failed they always put\r\nforward as a final inducement to comply with their demands the threat\r\nof withholding the Government grant; so that, in spite of the\r\nshoemaker's encomium, that \"Our chairman has plenty of\r\ncom_bat_iveness,\" we had eventually to give way.\r\n\r\nAt the outset it was decided to admit the Press; our meetings were\r\ngenerally expected to afford some spicy copy for readers of the local\r\npapers, but I am pleased to think that both reporters and readers were\r\ndisappointed. Some of our neighbours had given us specially lively\r\nspecimens of the personalities indulged in at the meetings of their\r\nlocal bodies, Boards of Guardians, and Councils--notably, at that\r\ntime, those of Winchcombe and Stow-on-the-Wold, where these\r\nexhibitions appeared to form a favourite diversion. It is a mistake\r\nfor such a Board as ours to admit reporters; the noisy members are apt\r\nto monopolize the speaking, to the exclusion of the more useful and\r\nmore thoughtful; the former play to the gallery to the extent of\r\nvisibly addressing themselves to the reporters instead of to the\r\nchairman, as is proper.\r\n\r\nThe first point we had to consider was the acquisition of a suitable\r\nsite for the new buildings, the old site not affording space to\r\nenlarge the premises or for the addition of a master's house. We were\r\nlucky to get the offer of an excellent position, allowing not only\r\nspace for all the buildings in contemplation, but ample room for\r\nfuture enlargements, which it was evident would be needed before many\r\nmore years. I was requested, with another member, to interview the\r\nvendor's solicitors, and we were empowered to make the best bargain we\r\ncould arrange for the site.\r\n\r\nWe concluded the purchase, and congratulated ourselves upon the\r\nacquisition of a central and in every way desirable site, with a long\r\nroad frontage, for the very moderate sum of, I think, £90. On\r\nreporting to the Board at our next meeting, the sum appeared large to\r\nsome of the more simple members, and they were inclined to be\r\ndissatisfied, until I told them that I was prepared to appropriate the\r\nbargain myself, and they could find another for the school. This\r\nsettled the matter, and, I suppose, at the present time the site would\r\nfetch two or three times what it cost us.\r\n\r\nPlans and specifications were now necessary, and from inquiries I had\r\nmade I was able to suggest an architect with much experience in school\r\nbuildings. He appeared before the Board later, and was subjected to\r\nmany questions from the members, of which I only remember one that\r\nappealed to me as original: \"Do you pose before this Board as an\r\neconomical architect?\" We soon had the work in train, but, of course,\r\nbefore any active steps were taken, all our proposals were submitted\r\nto, and approved by the Education Department.\r\n\r\nThe question of religious instruction became urgent, and I was pleased\r\nand surprised at carrying a unanimous resolution through the\r\nBoard--although it included some Nonconformists--that the Vicar (No.\r\n2), who had declined to be nominated as a candidate for election,\r\nshould be invited to undertake the religious instruction of the\r\nschool. The Vicar consented, and the arrangement worked smoothly for\r\nsome years. One day, later, a member rose, and inquired if the\r\nchildren were receiving religious instruction. \"Yes,\" I said. \"Are the\r\nchildren taught science?\" \"Yes,\" again. \"Well,\" said he, \"how do you\r\nreconcile the fact, when religion and science are not in agreement?\"\r\nFortunately, I had been lately taking a course of Darwin, and I was\r\nable to refer him to the concluding lines of the _Origin of Species_.\r\nWe debated the matter with some energy, but having made his protest,\r\nthe member was satisfied to let the matter drop.\r\n\r\nAll went well thereafter until we were settled in the new building,\r\nand Vicar No. 3 was in possession of the living. He was young and\r\ninexperienced in the conduct of a parish, and was imbued with ideas of\r\nwhat he considered a more ornate and elaborate form of worship.\r\nInnovations followed--lighted candles over the altar and the\r\nappointment of a Server at the Communion Service. Almost immediately I\r\nheard objections from the villagers; they could not understand the\r\nnecessity for a couple of dim candles in a church on a summer day,\r\nwhen the whole world outside was ablaze with the glory of the sun.\r\n\r\nA member arose at a Board meeting, and began: \"Mr. Chairman, I wish to\r\ndraw the attention of the Board to the question of religious\r\ninstruction in the school, for I reckon that our children are being\r\ntaught a lot of Popery.\" I could see that he had been in consultation\r\nwith other members of the Board, and that he had a majority behind\r\nhim. I tried hard to smooth matters over, but they had made up their\r\nminds, and he carried his resolution that, in future, the new Vicar\r\nshould be authorized to enter the school for the purpose of religious\r\ninstruction only one day a week! I think this small indulgence was\r\naccorded only as a result of my efforts in his favour, though I was by\r\nno means pleased with the innovations myself.\r\n\r\nI put the matter before the Vicar, asking him if he thought his\r\nnovelties were worth while in the face of the opposition of the\r\nvillage and the loss of his religious influence with the children. He\r\nwould not go back from what, he said, he regarded as a matter of\r\nprinciple, and could not see that he was throwing away a unique\r\nopportunity, but he agreed to withdraw the unwelcome Server.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that every detail of the new school building had\r\nbeen submitted to, and approved by, the Education Department, trouble\r\nbegan with an officious inspector, who on his first visit complained\r\nof the ventilation. An elementary school is never exactly a bed of\r\nroses, but we had a lofty building and classrooms, with plenty of\r\nwindows, which could be adjusted to admit as much or as little fresh\r\nair as was requisite. We protested without result, and we had\r\neventually to pull the new walls about and spend £20 on what we\r\nconsidered an uncalled-for alteration.\r\n\r\nOur inspectors of schools varied greatly: some were quiet with the\r\nchildren and considerate with the teachers; others vindicated their\r\nauthority by unnecessary fault-finding, upsetting the teachers and\r\nalarming the children. In the days of our voluntary school I have seen\r\na room full of children in a state of nervous tension, and the\r\nmistress and pupil-teachers in tears, as the result of inconsiderate\r\nreprimands and irritable speech. My sympathies have been strongly\r\naroused on such occasions with a child's terror of being made an\r\nexhibition before the others. As a boy at Harrow, in the form of the\r\nRev. F.W. Farrar, afterwards Dean of Canterbury, I had an unpleasant\r\nexperience, though it was no fault of his and quite unintentional. The\r\nRussian Government had sent a deputation of two learned professors to\r\nEngland, to inquire into the educational system of the Public Schools,\r\nwith the view of sending a member of the Royal family for education in\r\nthis country. Among other schools, they visited Harrow, and Mr.\r\nFarrar's form was one of those selected for inspection. It was the\r\nevening of a winter's day, when, at the four o'clock school, we found\r\ntwo very formidable-looking old gentlemen in spectacles and many furs\r\nseated near the master's desk. Great was the consternation, but Mr.\r\nFarrar was careful not to call upon any boy who would be likely to\r\nexhibit himself as a failure. I was seated near Mr. Farrar, at one end\r\nof a bench. He had a habit, when wanting to change his position, of\r\nmoving quite unconsciously across the intervening space between his\r\ndesk and this bench, and placing one foot on the bench close to the\r\nnearest boy, he would, with one hand, play with the boy's hair, while\r\nhe held his book in the other. With horror, I found him approaching,\r\nand shortly his hand was on my head, rubbing my hair round and round,\r\nand ruffling it in a fashion very trying to any boy who was neat and\r\ncareful of his personal appearance. I could see the Russians staring\r\nthrough their spectacles at these proceedings; possibly they thought\r\nit a form of punishment unknown in Russia, and my feelings of\r\nhumiliation can be imagined. Finally he gave me a smack on the cheek\r\nand retired to his desk, leaving my hair in a state of chaos, though\r\nhe had not the least idea of having done anything which might appear\r\nunusual to the foreigners.\r\n\r\nDear \"old Farrar\"!--as we irreverently called him--it was an education\r\nin itself to be in his form. I had the uncommon privilege of moving\r\nupwards in the School at very much the same rate as he did as a\r\nmaster, though I fear for my school reputation none too quickly. He\r\nfirst kindled my admiration for the classic giants of English\r\nliterature, more especially the poets, taught me to appreciate the\r\nrolling periods of Homer, and even the beauty of the characters of the\r\nGreek alphabet. He was a voluminous student of the best in every form\r\nof ancient and modern literature. He always kept a copy of Milton, his\r\nfavourite poet I think, on his desk, and, whenever a passage in the\r\nGreek or Latin classics occurred, for which he could produce a\r\nparallel, quoted pages without reference to the book.\r\n\r\nI recall my delight and pride when I was sent on two occasions to the\r\nheadmaster, Dr. Butler, the late Master of Trinity, with copies of\r\noriginal verses; and the honour I felt it to inscribe them, at Mr.\r\nFarrar's request, in a MS. book he kept for the purpose of collecting\r\napproved original efforts in the author's own writing. For it was his\r\nhabit once a week to give us subjects for verses or composition. A\r\nunique effort of the Captain of the School cricket eleven, C.F.\r\nBuller, comes back to me as I write; it did not however appear in the\r\nMS. book. The School Chapel was the subject, full of interest and\r\nstirring to the imagination, if only for the aisle to the memory of\r\nHarrow officers who fell in the Crimea. Buller's flight of imagination\r\nwas as absurd as it was impertinent:\r\n\r\n     \"The things in the Chapel nonsense are,\r\n     Don't you think so dear Fa_rrar_!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Farrar, however, never took offence at such sallies. I remember,\r\nwhen he was denouncing the old \"yellow back\" novels, murmurs becoming\r\naudible, which were intended to reach him, of \"Eric! Eric!\"--the title\r\nof his early school-boy story--he only smiled in acknowledgment. And\r\non an April 1st several boys who had plotted beforehand gazed\r\nsimultaneously and persistently at a spot on the ceiling, until his\r\neyes followed theirs unthinkingly in the same direction, when it\r\noccurred to him, as nothing unusual was visible, that it was All\r\nFools' Day. He was very playful and indulgent; he kept a \"squash\"\r\nracquet ball on his desk, and could throw it with accurate aim if he\r\nnoticed a boy dreaming or inattentive. He would never when scoring the\r\nmarks enter a 0, even after an abject failure, always saying, \"Give\r\nhim a charity 1!\"\r\n\r\nBoys are quick judges of sermons: if interested, they listen without\r\nan effort; if not interested, they _cannot_ listen. Whenever Mr.\r\nFarrar's turn came as preacher in the School Chapel there was a subtle\r\nstir and whisper of appreciation, \"It's Farrar to-day.\" He was a\r\nnatural orator. I can still hear his magnificent voice swelling in\r\ntones of passionate denunciation decreasing to gentle appeal, and\r\ndying away in tender pathos. This was education in the true sense of\r\nthe word, and though I have wandered a long way from my immediate\r\nsubject, I feel that the digression is not irrelevant in contrast with\r\nthe mechanical instruction that goes by the name of education in the\r\nBoard Schools. I cannot help recalling too that in the ancient IVth\r\nForm Room at Harrow, the roughest of old benches were, and I believe\r\nstill are, considered good enough for future bishops, judges, and\r\nstatesmen; while in the Board Schools expensive polished desks and\r\nseats have to be provided at the cost of the ratepayers to be shortly\r\nkicked to pieces by hobnailed shoes.\r\n\r\nI was present at some amusing incidents in examinations at our village\r\nschool. A small boy was commanded by an inspector to read aloud, and\r\nbegan in the usual child's high-keyed, expressionless, and\r\nunpunctuated monotone:\r\n\"I-have-six-little-pigs-two-of-them-are-white-two-of-them-are-black-an\r\nd-two-of-them-are-spotted.\" \"That's not the way to read,\" interposed\r\nthe inspector. \"Give me the book.\" He stood up, striking an attitude,\r\nhead thrown well back, and reading with great deliberation and\r\nemphasis: \"I have _six_ LITTLE PIGS; two of them are _white_! Two of\r\nthem are _black_! and (confidentially) two of them are spot_tered_!\"\r\n\r\nI once picked up an elementary reading book in the school, and read as\r\nfollows: \"Tom said to Jack, 'There is a hayrick down in the meadow;\r\nshall we go and set it on fire?'\" And so on, with an account of the\r\nconflagration, highly coloured. So much for town ideas of the\r\neducation of country children; the suggestion was enough to bring\r\nabout the catastrophe, given the opportunity and a box of matches.\r\n\r\nSome of the inspectors were very agreeable men; they occasionally came\r\nto luncheon at my house, and I once asked where the best-managed\r\nschools were to be found. The reply was, \"In parishes where the\r\nvoluntary schools still exist, and the feudal system is mildly\r\nadministered.\"\r\n\r\nOur villagers, reading of the large sums that we were obliged to\r\nexpend in response to the requirements of the Education Department,\r\nand finding the consequent rates a burden, began to think of economy\r\nand nothing but economy, so that though I had expected them to be only\r\ntoo anxious to provide the very best possible education for their own\r\nchildren, it came as a surprise that this was quite a subordinate aim\r\nto that of keeping down the cost. And this was the more unexpected, as\r\nthe main cost fell upon the large ratepayers, like myself and the\r\nrailway company and the owners of land and cottages rented rate-free.\r\nAt the next election several of these economists became candidates,\r\nwith the result that many of the original members including myself\r\nwere not returned, in spite of the fact that our well-planned and\r\nwell-built schools were erected at a lower cost per child than any in\r\nthe neighbourhood. I was not sorry to escape from the monotony of\r\nlistening to interminable debates as to whether a necessary broom or\r\nsuch-like trifle should be bought at one shilling or one and\r\nthreepence. For this was the kind of subject that the Board could\r\nunderstand and liked to enlarge upon, while really important proposals\r\nwere carried with little consideration. As a matter of fact, members\r\nof a School Board are no more than dummies in the hands of an\r\ninflexible Department, and are appointed to carry out orders and\r\nregulations without the power of modification, even when quite\r\nunsuitable for a country village school.\r\n\r\nThere was some little excitement at the election; one of the members\r\nof the old Board had been called \"an ignoramus,\" in the stress of\r\nbattle, and being much concerned and mystified asked a neighbour what\r\nthe term signified, adding, no doubt thinking of a hippopotamus, that\r\nhe believed it was some kind of animal! His knowledge of zoology was\r\nprobably as limited as that disclosed by the following story:\r\n\r\n     A menagerie was on view at Evesham, to the great joy of many\r\n     juveniles as well as older people, for such exhibitions were\r\n     not very common in the town. Very early next morning, a\r\n     farmer, living about two miles from Aldington, was awakened\r\n     by a shower of small stones on his bedroom window. Looking\r\n     out he saw his shepherd in much excitement and alarm. \"Oh\r\n     master, master, there's a beast with two tails, one in front\r\n     and one behind, a-pullin' up the mangolds, and a-eatin' of\r\n     'em!\" The farmer hurried to the spot and saw an African\r\n     elephant which had escaped during the night; he was\r\n     wondering how to proceed when two keepers appeared and the\r\n     strange beast was led quietly back to the town.\r\n\r\nAs chairman of our School Board I early recognized among the members\r\ndiscoverers of mare's-nests, who lost no opportunity of exhibiting\r\ntheir own importance by intruding such matters into the already\r\noverflowing _agenda_, and my method of dealing with them was so\r\nsuccessful, though I believe not original, that it may be found useful\r\nby those called upon to preside over any of the multitudinous councils\r\nnow in existence. Whenever the member produced his cherished\r\ndiscovery--generally very shadowy as to detail--I proposed the\r\nappointment of a subcommittee, consisting of him and his sympathizers,\r\nto inquire into the matter, and report at the next Board meeting. In\r\nthis way I shunted the bother of the investigation of usually some\r\ntrifle or unsubstantiated opinion on to his own shoulders, so that,\r\nwhen he realized the time and trouble involved, he became much less\r\ninterested, and we heard very little more of the subject.\r\n\r\nI suppose that everybody living in a country parish, who can look back\r\nover the period of fifty years of compulsory education, would agree\r\nthat the results are insignificant in comparison with the effort, and\r\none cannot help wondering whether, after all, they justify the\r\ngigantic cost. We appear to have tried to build too quickly on an\r\ninsecure foundation. Nature produces no permanent work in a hurry, and\r\nArt is a blind leader unless she submits to Nature's laws. The pace\r\nhas been too great, and the fabric which we have reared is already\r\nshowing the defects in its construction.\r\n\r\nHow otherwise can we account for the littleness of the men\r\nrepresenting \"the people,\" who have been rushed into the big\r\npositions, and for the vulgarity of the present age? Vulgarity in\r\npublic worship; vulgarity in the manners, the speeches, and the ideals\r\nof the House of Commons; vulgarity in \"literature,\" on the stage, in\r\nmusic, in the studio, and in a section of the Press; vulgarity in\r\nbuilding and the desecration of beautiful places; vulgarity in form\r\nand colour of dress and decoration. We are far behind the design and\r\nconstruction of the domestic furniture of 150 years ago, and we have\r\nnever equalled the architecture of the earliest periods, for stability\r\nand stateliness.\r\n\r\nThe skim milk seems to have come to the top and the cream has gone to\r\nthe bottom, as the result of the contravention of the laws of\r\nevolution, and the failure to perceive the analogy between the\r\nsimplest methods of agriculture, and the cultivation of mentality. We\r\nhave expected fruit and flowers from waste and untilled soil; we sowed\r\nthe seed of instruction without even ploughing the land, or\r\neradicating the prominent weeds, and we are reaping a crop of thistles\r\nwhere we looked for figs, and thorns where we looked for grapes. The\r\nseed scattered so lavishly by the wayside was devoured by the fowls of\r\nthe air; that which was sown upon the stony places, where there was\r\nnot much earth, could not withstand the heat of summer; and that which\r\nfell among thorns was choked by the unconquered possessors of the\r\nfield. A little, a very little, which \"fell into good ground brought\r\nforth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold\";\r\nand therein lies our only consolation.\r\n\r\nThe educational enthusiasts of 1870 forgot that the material they had\r\nto work upon did not come from inherited refinement and intelligence;\r\nthat it was evolved from a parentage content with a vocabulary of some\r\n500 words; that there was little nobility of home influence to assist\r\nin the process of development; they crammed it with matter which it\r\ncould not assimilate, they took it from the open country air and the\r\nsunshine, confined it in close and crowded school-rooms, and produced\r\nwhat we see everywhere at the present time, at the cost of physical\r\ndeterioration--a diseased and unsettled mentality.\r\n\r\nI am aware that there are those who decline to admit any influence of\r\nmental heredity, and argue that environment is the only factor to be\r\nconsidered. In a clever and well-reasoned work on the subject I lately\r\nread, this proposition was substantiated by instances observable\r\nespecially among birds brought up in unnatural conditions. The writer,\r\nhowever, entirely forgot the most conclusive piece of evidence in\r\nfavour of mental heredity which it is possible to adduce--namely, that\r\nof the brood of ducklings, who, in spite of the unmistakable\r\nmanifestations of alarm on the part of a frantic foster-mother hen,\r\ntake to the water and enjoy it on the very first opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVILLAGE INSTITUTIONS: CRICKET--FOOTBALL--FLOWERSHOW--BAND--POSTMAN--\r\nCONCERTS.\r\n\r\n     \"There is sweet music here that softer falls\r\n     Than petals from blown roses on the grass.\"\r\n                                                _The Lotus-Eaters_.\r\n\r\nAmong village institutions a cricket club was started soon after I\r\nfirst came, and I was able to lend a meadow in which the members could\r\nplay. I held the sinecure office of President. The members met,\r\ndiscussed ways and means, drew up regulations, and instituted fines\r\nfor various delinquencies. Swearing was expensive at threepence each\r\ntime, but there was no definition of what were to be considered \"swear\r\nwords.\" Locally, a usual expletive is, \"daazz it,\" or, \"I'll be\r\ndaazzed,\" and it was not long before a member making use of this\r\neuphemism was accused of swearing. He protested that it was not\r\nrecognized by philological authorities as coming under the category,\r\nbut he had to pay up.\r\n\r\nA village cricket match was regarded more as a contest than a pastime;\r\neach side feared the censure of his parish, if conquered, so nothing\r\nhad to be given away likely to prove an advantage to an opposing team.\r\nI once saw a member snatch a bat belonging to his own club from one of\r\nthe other side who was about to appropriate it for his innings with,\r\n\"No you don't.\" How different is the feeling, and how ready to help, a\r\nmember of a really sporting team would have been in similar\r\ncircumstances! Referring to help or advice in cricket matters, a story\r\nis told of the late Dr. W.G. Grace. The incident happened in an\r\nadjoining county to Worcestershire. The great batsman, crossing\r\nClifton Down, came upon some boys at cricket. Three sticks represented\r\nthe wickets, arranged so wide apart that the ball could pass through\r\nwithout disturbing them. Ever ready to help, Dr. Grace pointed out the\r\nfault and readjusted the sticks; as he turned away he heard, \"What\r\ndoes 'e know about it, I wonder!\"\r\n\r\nThis carries me to a parallel happening at Stratford-on-Avon. The late\r\nSir Henry Irving and a friend fell in with a native on the outskirts\r\nof the town, and being anxious to test the local reputation of the\r\npoet asked the man if he had heard of a person named Shakespeare. The\r\nman assented and volunteered the information that he was a writer. Did\r\nhe \"know what Shakespeare had written?\" Their informant could not say,\r\nbut, a moment after they had parted, he called back that he believed\r\nhe had written \"part of the Bible.\"\r\n\r\nAn ancient villager, who was secretary of our Club and always acted as\r\numpire, gave me \"out,\" incorrectly, for accidentally touching the\r\nwicket when the ball was \"dead.\" I retired without contesting his\r\ndecision, as I had been taught. Next time we met he apologized, having\r\ndiscovered his mistake, but he was greatly impressed by my practical\r\nexample of \"playing the game.\"\r\n\r\nCricket, though popular in my first years at Aldington, gradually\r\nbecame difficult to arrange. As the market-garden industry superseded\r\nfarming, the young men found full employment for the long summer\r\nevenings on their allotments and those of their parents. In the\r\nwinter, when horticultural work is not so pressing, they had plenty of\r\ntime on their hands, and a football club was formed. It flourished\r\nexceedingly, and Badsey became almost invincible among the\r\nneighbouring villages and even against the towns. They distinguished\r\nthemselves in the local League matches, and on one occasion, something\r\nlike two thousand spectators assembled to witness a final which Badsey\r\nwon, in the meadow I lent them; and I had the honour of presiding at a\r\ngrand dinner to celebrate the event. I notice in the local papers that\r\nin spite of the interruption of the war they are now again thriving\r\nand earning new laurels.\r\n\r\nOur most important fête day was that upon which the Badsey, Aldington,\r\nand Wickhamford Flower Show was held. The credit, for the original\r\ninception and organization of this popular festival, is almost\r\nentirely due, I think, to the public spirit and determination of my\r\nold friend and co-churchwarden, Mr. Julius Sladden, of Badsey, and it\r\ngives me much pleasure to record the debt of gratitude which the three\r\nvillages still owe him.\r\n\r\nThe Show is held as nearly as possible on the day of the ancient\r\nBadsey wake, in most parishes still celebrated on the day of the\r\npatron saint. In the case of Badsey the anniversary of the wake is the\r\n25th of July (St. James's day). As a wake Badsey's observance is a\r\nthing of the past; it was formerly a time of much cider-drinking, a\r\nmeeting-day for friends and relations, and for various trials of\r\nstrength and skill, though I believe the carousals outlasted the\r\nsports by many years.\r\n\r\nNothing happier, in the way of a revival, and more civilized\r\nenjoyment, could have been devised than a flower show, and it is now\r\none of the most popular fixtures of the neighbourhood with exceedingly\r\nkeen competition. Besides fruit, flowers, and vegetables, the exhibits\r\ninclude such produce as butter and eggs, and my wife was very\r\nsuccessful with these, but on one occasion was rather disappointed to\r\nfind a beautiful dish of Langshan eggs, almost preternaturally brown\r\nand rich-looking, disqualified. The judges were not acquainted with\r\nthe peculiarities of the breed--then a new one--and the reason for\r\ndisqualification, as we afterwards discovered, was \"artificially\r\ncoloured.\" I believe exhibitors have been known to use coffee for this\r\npurpose, and the judges, who had not the exhibitors' names before\r\nthem, fancied this to be an instance.\r\n\r\nThe children's exhibits of wild flower bouquets I always considered at\r\nthis and similar shows far the most interesting and beautiful among\r\nthe flowers; but, unfortunately, they very soon droop in a hot tent\r\nand look rather unhappy.\r\n\r\nAldington Band was the outcome of a desire for musical expression on\r\nthe part of a few parishioners with some skill and experience in such\r\nmatters; it included performers on wind instruments and a big drum.\r\nThe Band was unfortunate at first in purchasing instruments of\r\ndiffering pitch, as was discovered by my wife on attending a practice\r\nat the request of the members. She pointed out the fault, and found an\r\ninstructor from Evesham to give them a course of lessons, so that with\r\na new set of instruments they soon improved. It was difficult, at\r\nfirst, to find a suitable place for practice. A neighbour, a little\r\ndoubtful as to their attainments, suggested the railway arch in one of\r\nmy meadows as a nice airy spot under cover, but later expressed doubts\r\nas to the safety of the trains running overhead on account of the\r\nviolence of the commotion beneath! This, of course, was mere chaff,\r\nfor they soon became so efficient that a large room was found for them\r\nin the village, and eventually they were annually engaged to perform\r\nthe musical programme at the Badsey, Aldington, and Wickhamford Flower\r\nShow. My gardener was the leading spirit of the Band, a great optimist\r\nand the most willing man of any who ever reigned in my garden. There\r\nwas nothing he would not cheerfully undertake, and when we had a\r\ndifficulty in finding a sweep as required, he volunteered for the work\r\nand became quite an adept, with the set of rods and brushes I bought\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nOur postman, though not a villager, was quite an institution; he\r\nwalked a matter of ten miles a day from Evesham to Bretforton, taking\r\nAldington and Badsey on the way, and back at night. He filled up the\r\ninterval between the incoming and outgoing posts at Bretforton,\r\nworking at his trade as tailor. Entering our village each evening, he\r\nannounced his arrival by three blasts on his tin horn; he was very shy\r\nof being observed in this performance, and the people had to catch him\r\nas he passed and hand him their letters. He must have walked nearly\r\n100,000 miles in the many years he was our postman, and he told me\r\nbefore I left that more letters were addressed to the Manor when I\r\nfirst came, than to all the rest of the houses in the village\r\ntogether. When correspondence became more general a pillar-box was\r\nerected, but I always regretted the loss of the familiar notes of the\r\ntin horn.\r\n\r\nAmong Aldington's amusements no account would be complete without a\r\nreference to the numerous concerts and entertainments for charitable\r\nobjects which my wife organized, and in which her musical talent\r\nenabled her to take a prominent part; and although I feel some\r\nhesitation in dealing with so personal a matter, I am certain that\r\nmany of those who co-operated with her in the organization and the\r\nperformance of these affairs will be pleased to have their\r\nrecollections of her own part in them revived.\r\n\r\nShe possessed a natural soprano voice of great sweetness and\r\nflexibility, in combination with the sympathetic ability and clear\r\nenunciation which add so much to the charm of vocal expression. She\r\nwas not allowed to begin singing, in earnest, before she was nineteen,\r\nfor fear of straining so delicate a voice, and she then had the\r\nadvantage of the tuition of Signor Caravoglia, one of the most\r\ncelebrated teachers of the time.\r\n\r\nHis method included deliberation in taking breath, thorough opening of\r\nthe mouth, practice before a mirror to produce a pleasing effect, and\r\nto avoid facial contortion; he would not allow any visible effort, the\r\naim being to sing as naturally and spontaneously as a bird. His wife\r\nplayed the accompaniments, so that the master could give his whole\r\nattention to the attitude, production, and facial expression of the\r\npupil.\r\n\r\nSigner Caravoglia only consented to teach her on the express condition\r\nthat she would not sing in choruses, on account of the danger of\r\nstrain and overexertion. She practised regularly, chiefly exercises,\r\ntwo hours a day in separate half hours. Her talent was soon recognized\r\nat Malvern, where she lived before her marriage, and her assistance\r\nwas in great demand for amateur charity concerts.\r\n\r\nI have a book full of newspaper reports of my wife's performances,\r\ncontaining notices of concerts at Malvern repeatedly, Kidderminster,\r\nWorcester, at Birmingham under the auspices of the Musical Section of\r\nthe Midland Institute--a very great honour before a highly critical\r\naudience--Alcester, Pershore, Moreton-in-the-Marsh, Evesham, Broadway,\r\nBadsey, Wallingford, and a great many villages in the Evesham\r\ndistrict. At Moreton she sang for the local Choral Society, taking the\r\nsoprano solos in the first part of Haydn's _Spring_, and the local\r\npaper reported that her \"birdlike voice added much to the beauty of\r\nthe cantata.\" In the second part of the concert she gave _The Bird\r\nthat came in Spring_, by Sterndale Bennett. I was always a little\r\nnervous during this song in anticipation of the upper C towards the\r\nfinale, but it never failed to come true and brilliant. As we were\r\nleaving by train the following morning we met a dear old musician who\r\nhad taken part in the chorus of the cantata. He begged to be\r\nintroduced to her, and said in his hearty congratulations on her\r\nperformance, that never before had such a note been heard in Moreton.\r\n\r\nAt one of the Broadway concerts my wife had the pleasure of meeting\r\nMiss Maude Valerie White, who was playing the accompaniments for\r\nperformers of her own compositions, including _The Devout Lover_,\r\nwhich, she told Miss White, she considered one of the best songs in\r\nthe English language, at the same time asking for her autograph. Miss\r\nWhite was kind enough to write her signature with the MS. music of the\r\nfirst phrase--notes and words--of the song in a book which my wife\r\nkept for the autographs of distinguished musicians and celebrated\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWhile at Malvern my wife once heard Jenny Lind in public, and she\r\ndescribes it as a most memorable occasion.\r\n\r\nJenny Lind had for some years retired from public performance, but\r\nconsented to reappear at the request of a deputation of railway\r\nemployees anxious to arrange a concert in aid of the widows and\r\norphans of officials killed in a recent railway accident. She\r\nstipulated that she should sing in two duets only, choosing the other\r\nvoice herself, and she selected Miss Hilda Wilson, the well-known\r\ncontralto of that time.\r\n\r\nThey sang two duets by Rubinstein, one being _The Song of the Summer\r\nBirds_, full of elaborate execution. Her voice was so true, sweet and\r\nflexible, trilling and warbling like a bird, and taking the A flat as\r\na climax of delight at the conclusion with the greatest ease, that\r\nwith closed eyes it might have been taken for the effort of a young\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nJenny Lind was over seventy at the time; she was erect, tall, and\r\ngraceful; she wore a black dress with a good deal of white lace, and a\r\nwhite lace cap. She was then Madame Otto Goldschmidt, living at the\r\nWynd's Point on the Herefordshire Beacon of the Malvern Range, and had\r\nlong been known as the \"Swedish Nightingale.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEALERS--LUCK MONEY--FAIRS--SALES--EFFECT OF CLIMATE ON CATTLE AND\r\nSHEEP--AGRICULTURAL SHOWS.\r\n\r\n       \"I'll give thrice so much land\r\n     To any well-deserving friend;\r\n     But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,\r\n     I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.\"\r\n                                            --_1 Henry IV_.\r\n\r\nDealers of all kinds were much more frequent callers at farm-houses in\r\nthe early days of my farming, than latterly when auction sales, to\r\nsome extent, superseded private negotiations, but the horse-dealer\r\nremained constant, because comparatively few horses were offered by\r\nauction. The horse-dealers appeared to conform to an understanding\r\nthat it was a breach of etiquette to exceed certain well-marked\r\nboundaries in their search for purchases, or to interfere in each\r\nother's business. This principle was carried so far as to prevent\r\ndealers from one of these \"countries\" purchasing a horse at a fair\r\ncoming from another dealer's \"country,\" and the understanding of\r\ncourse minimized competition likely to raise the price. The dealers\r\nhowever I think, gave fair values, governed for the most part by the\r\nprices obtainable by them in the large towns.\r\n\r\nMost of my horses, when for sale, were bought by a man in a\r\nconsiderable way of business, a well-known breeder, too, of shire\r\nhorses, taking many prizes at the leading shows. A handsome man with a\r\npresence, and an excellent judge, shrewd but straight. He would ask\r\nthe price after examining the animal, and make an offer which he would\r\nvery seldom exceed if refused at first; but he would spend some time\r\nin conversation, apparently quite irrelevant and very amusing, though\r\nalways returning to the point at intervals with arguments in favour of\r\nthe acceptance of his bid. He was so genial and pleasant and such good\r\ncompany, for no man was ever better acquainted with the ways of the\r\nworld, that he very rarely, I think, left the premises without a deal,\r\nthough sometimes he was in his gig before the final bargain was\r\nstruck. It is a custom of the trade for the seller to give something\r\nback to the buyer by way of \"luck money,\" and the last time I did\r\nbusiness with him I refused to give more than one shilling each on two\r\nhorses, as I never received more than that sum when a buyer myself. He\r\naccepted cheerfully, telling me that a shilling each was quite worth\r\ntaking, as he had a thousand horses through his hands in the course of\r\nevery twelve months, and that a thousand shillings meant £50 a year.\r\n\r\nThe best piece of horse-dealing I ever did, was the purchase of a six\r\nmonths old colt for £26, winning £20 in prizes with him as a\r\ntwo-year-old, working him regularly at three and four on the farm, and\r\nselling him at five for eighty guineas to a large brewery firm. Eighty\r\nguineas in those days was a big price for a cart horse, though, of\r\ncourse, in modern times, owing to the war, much higher prices can be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nI remember another dealer, who, a notable figure in a white top hat\r\nwith a deep black band, and large coloured spectacles, was to be seen\r\nat all the fairs and principal sales. He, too, had an ingratiating\r\nmanner, and would accost a young farmer with a hearty, \"Good-morning,\r\nSquire,\" or some such flattering introduction. A wise dealer always\r\nknows how to keep up amicable relations with a possible seller or\r\nbuyer, and never descends to abuse, or the assumption of a personal\r\ninjury if he cannot persuade a seller to accept his price, as is the\r\ncase with some dealers with less _savoir faire_.\r\n\r\nA successful cattle dealer I knew had similar tactics of fraternity,\r\nalways addressing his sellers as \"Governor,\" with marked respect. But\r\nthe best instance of this diplomatic spirit occurred in the case of a\r\ndeal between an old Hampshire friend of mine and a well-known and\r\nhistoric sheep dealer from the same county. My friend had lately\r\nbecome the happy father of twins, the fact being widely known in the\r\nneighbourhood, for he was a very prominent man. He had 100 sheep for\r\nsale, and the dealer was inspecting them, in a pen near the house. As\r\nthe bargain proceeded, the front door opened, and a nurse-maid\r\nappeared with the twins in their perambulator. The dealer noticed them\r\nimmediately, and was not slow to turn the incident to his advantage.\r\n\"There they be, there they be, the little darlings,\" he called out, \"a\r\nsovereign apiece nurse, a sovereign apiece.\" Diving into a capacious\r\npocket, he pulled out a handful of gold and silver, and selecting two\r\nsovereigns he handed them to the nurse for the children. \"After that,\"\r\nmy friend said, \"what could I do but sell him the sheep, though he got\r\nthem at two shillings a head less than I ought to have made.\" Now two\r\nshillings a head, on one hundred sheep, represents ten pounds, leaving\r\neight pounds which the dealer earned by his keen insight into human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThis dealer carried on business with a brother, and they were to be\r\nseen for very many years at all the large Hampshire summer sheep\r\nfairs, where indeed, sometimes, when prices were rising, they owned\r\nnearly all the sheep offered for sale, having bought them up\r\nbeforehand. As in a favourable summer when there was plenty of keep\r\nand a good prospect of abundant roots prices would rise as much as\r\n10s. a head during the months of the big fairs, and as at a single\r\nfair as many as 30,000 sheep would be for sale, the chances of profit\r\noffered to the courageous dealer with capital are manifest.\r\n\r\nThough risen from small beginnings, these brothers amassed\r\nconsiderable fortunes, all of which, it was said, they invested in\r\nreal estate, so that they were known at one time to be worth at least\r\n£100,000; and, as they continued in business for some years after the\r\ntime of which I am writing, they must have exceeded that sum\r\nconsiderably as a total, though the values of land began to fall away\r\ntowards the end of their active existence.\r\n\r\nThe more energetic of the two used very original phrases, in which he\r\nextolled the physical virtues of flocks he had to sell; referring to\r\ntheir size, he would say, \"Just look at their backs! look at their\r\nbacks! they be as long as a wet Sunday!\" Watching him, you could see\r\nthat while giving full attention to his customer, and keeping him in a\r\ngood humour with pleasant chat, while a bargain was proceeding, his\r\nglance perpetually wandered to the moving crowd around the pens, and\r\nthat he had not only eyes, but ears, open to catch any impression\r\nbearing on the progress of the general trade. He knew everybody, and\r\nintuition told him upon what business they were present.\r\n\r\nThese two dealers combined money-lending with sheep-dealing; if a\r\nbuyer had not the ready cash they would give credit for the purchase\r\nprice, the sheep forming the security; it being understood that when\r\nthey were again for sale the lenders should have the selling of them\r\non commission.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of horse-dealers I referred to the custom of giving \"luck\r\nmoney,\" otherwise called \"chap money.\" The word \"chap\" takes its\r\nderivation from the Anglo-Saxon _ceap_ price or bargain, and\r\n_ceapean_, to bargain, whence come the words \"chop,\" to exchange;\r\n\"cheap,\" \"Cheapside,\" \"Mealcheapen Street\" in Worcester, \"cheapjack,\"\r\netc. Also, the prefix in the names of market towns, such as Chipping\r\nCampden, Chipping Norton, etc. There is a curious place-name here in\r\nBurley, New Forest, where I am now living, spelt \"Shappen,\" which\r\npuzzled me until I chanced to meet with an ancient print of a village\r\nmerry-making, with dancing and a May-pole and found that the name\r\nShappen applied especially to the spot, and that not far away the\r\nForest ponies and cattle were formerly penned for sale at an annual\r\nfair in a lane, still called Pound Lane \"Pound\" is from the\r\nAnglo-Saxon _pund_, a fold or inclosure. Shappen is evidently,\r\ntherefore, derived from _ceap_ (and possibly _pund_) as a place in\r\nwhich bargains were struck, and the name testifies to the extreme\r\nantiquity of the New Forest pony and cattle fair formerly held there.\r\n\r\nThere are several notable horse fairs still held near Evesham. Besides\r\nthe one at Pershore, already mentioned, the most important fairs are\r\nheld at Stow-on-the-Wold and Shipston-on-Stour, both very\r\nout-of-the-way places; and many stories of the wiles of horse-copers\r\nwere related in connection therewith. I remember the following told as\r\noccurring at Stow-on-the-Wold. A man approached a simple-looking young\r\nfarmer, and getting into conversation with him, pointed out a horse\r\nnot far off, telling him that he had quarrelled with the owner who\r\nrefused in consequence to sell him the horse which he wished to buy.\r\nHe promised the farmer £2 if he would undertake the negotiation, and\r\ncould buy the horse for £10. The farmer agreed, and after some\r\napparent difficulty succeeded in effecting the purchase at the sum\r\nnamed, paid the money and returned with the horse to the place where\r\nhe had left his acquaintance. The latter, however, had disappeared,\r\nand after searching the fair from one end to the other, the farmer\r\ntook back the horse, to repudiate the bargain. The owner had also\r\nvanished, and the farmer found himself with an ancient screw, which\r\neventually he was glad to get rid of at a pound a leg, losing £6 on\r\nthe deal.\r\n\r\nThere are small pig-dealers, in almost every village, on the lookout\r\nfor bargains, and very cute men they generally are. One of these\r\nwell-known at Aldington, though nearly blind, could tell the points\r\nand value of any pig in a marvellous way almost by intuition; it was\r\nsaid of him that, \"though blind, he was a better judge of a pig than\r\nmost folks with their eyes open.\"\r\n\r\nAt farm and other auction sales there are always anxious buyers who\r\nmake a practice of trying to depreciate (\"crabbing,\" as it is called)\r\nany article or property they particularly wish to purchase, by making\r\ndamaging statements or insinuations to anybody whom, they fear, is\r\nalso a probable buyer. At a sale of cottage property adjoining a\r\npublic-house, in a village not far from Aldington, a keen purchaser\r\nremarked that there was no water on the premises. The auctioneer,\r\nhowever, knowing that water was not his man's strong point,\r\nimmediately replied, \"Oh, never mind the water, sir, there's plenty of\r\nwhisky to be had next door.\" At another property sale, the tenant of\r\nthe house on offer, gratuitously informed me that the roof was in a\r\nvery bad state; knowing my man, I was not surprised when the house was\r\nknocked down to him, but I never saw any repairs to the roof in\r\nprogress afterwards.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine had a caretaker in an empty house, and, finding that\r\nno applications to view ever got beyond that stage, called at the\r\nhouse with his wife, ostensibly as intending tenants. He was not\r\npersonally known to the caretaker, and on making the usual inquiries,\r\nfound the man by no means enthusiastic as to the amenities of the\r\nplace, and particularly doubtful as to the drainage, so much so as to\r\nmake it plain that any otherwise likely tenant would be repelled.\r\nKnowing that all the sanitary arrangements were in perfect order, he\r\ndisclosed his identity, much to the dismay of the caretaker who, of\r\ncourse, was dismissed.\r\n\r\nThe person who asks damaging questions of the auctioneer or solicitor\r\nat a property sale, though perhaps not declared the buyer on the fall\r\nof the hammer, not infrequently proves later to have been so, having\r\nemployed an agent to bid for him.\r\n\r\nAt a sale of farm stock and implements I was examining a waggon\r\npractically new, though with no intention of buying, when I was\r\nsurprised by a cousin of the vendor volunteering the statement that,\r\nhaving lately borrowed the waggon, he noticed one of the wheels giving\r\nout a suspicious noise when in use, as if something were wrong. This\r\nwas a particularly bad case of \"crabbing,\" as the man eventually\r\nbecame the purchaser at a high price.\r\n\r\nIt is an alarming sensation to see one's name on a waggon for the\r\nfirst time, especially when the vehicle has been wholly repainted in\r\nblue or yellow to represent the owner's supposed political tendencies,\r\nfor such was the custom in Worcestershire; but perhaps one's name,\r\naddress, and crest on a hop-pocket is more alarming still, when we\r\nremember that twenty or more of these pockets, all marked alike, will\r\nform each of several loads to be carted from a London railway station\r\nto the Borough, the seat of the hop-trade, on the way to the factor's\r\nwarehouses, for all beholders to \"read, mark, learn, and inwardly\r\ndigest.\"\r\n\r\nIn the delightful and now somewhat rare book _Talpa; or, The\r\nChronicles of a Clay Farm_, by Chandos Wren Hoskins, one of the few\r\nagricultural works ever written by a scholar, he refers to his first\r\nexperience of this sort, when speaking of his difficulty in making up\r\nhis mind as to whether he should let the property into which he had\r\njust come by inheritance, or occupy it himself, as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"What was to be done? Apostatize from all the promises and\r\n     vows made from my youth up, and take it _in hand_--that is,\r\n     in a bailiff's hand, which certain foregone experiences had\r\n     led me to conceive was of all things the most _out of hand_\r\n     (if that may be called so, which empties the hand and the\r\n     pocket too). Such seemed the only alternative! At first it\r\n     was an impossibility--then an improbability--and then, as\r\n     the ear of bearded corn wins its forbidden way up the\r\n     schoolboy's sleeve, and gains a point in advance by every\r\n     effort to stop or expel it, so did every determination,\r\n     every reflection counteract the very purpose it was summoned\r\n     to oppose, and, in short, one fine morning I almost jumped a\r\n     yard backward at seeing--my own name on a waggon!\"\r\n\r\nThe reference to a bailiff reminds me of my father's illustration, one\r\nevening at dessert, of the difference between a farmer selling his\r\nproduce personally, or doing so through the medium of a bailiff.\r\nTaking three wine-glasses--No. 1 representing the farmer, No. 2 the\r\nbailiff, and No. 3 the purchaser--he filled No. 1 with port and poured\r\nthe contents into No. 3; what few drops were left in No. 1 remained\r\nthe property of the farmer. But if the wine were poured into No. 2,\r\nand from thence into No. 3, however much the complete transference was\r\nattempted, some small portion always remained for the benefit of the\r\nintermediary.\r\n\r\nI always conducted my sales personally, except in small matters, and\r\nmy experience in the latter proved an exception to the above rule, as\r\nI have previously related (pp. 17 and 20).\r\n\r\nI commend _Talpa_, with George Cruikshank's clever illustrations, to\r\nthe attention of all readers of the curiosities of agriculture, as\r\nwell as to practical men; it is one of those uncommon books which\r\nenters into the humorous side of farming under disadvantages--as, for\r\ninstance, prejudiced labourers who have long been employed upon such\r\nwork as draining. The author found one of the men, after instructions\r\nto lay the pipes at a depth of three feet, cutting a drain about\r\neighteen inches deep, _laying in the tiles, one by one, and filling\r\nthe earth in over them as he went_. \"I've been a-draining this forty\r\nyear and more--I ought to know summat about it.\" The author adds,\r\n\"Need I tell you who said this? or give you the whole of the colloquy\r\nto which it furnished the epilogue?\" _Talpa_ was published sixty-seven\r\nyears ago, but it contains much that might well be taken to heart by\r\nour post-war amateur agricultural reconstructionists.\r\n\r\nThe tactics of a combination of buyers at a sale of household goods,\r\nwith an arrangement for one man to buy everything they want, so as to\r\navoid competition, is well known as \"the knock out.\" I saw a most\r\nflagrant case at a sale of valuable books at an old Cotswold Manor\r\nHouse. The books were tied up, quite promiscuously, in parcels of half\r\na dozen or more, and although the room was crowded with dealers who\r\nhad been examining them with interest beforehand, practically only one\r\nbidder appeared, and nearly every lot was sold to him for a few\r\nshillings. I noticed several men taking notes of the prices made, and,\r\nimmediately the book sale was finished, they removed them to the lawn,\r\nwhere they were resold by one of the gang at greatly enhanced prices.\r\nThey would, of course, eventually deduct the original cost from the\r\namount now realized and divide the difference amongst the buyers at\r\nthe second sale, _pro rata_, according to the amount of each man's\r\ntotal purchases.\r\n\r\nCattle-dealers, with a reputation as judges of fat stock at auctions,\r\nhave to be very careful not to let inexperienced butchers see them\r\nbidding, because the latter will bid on the strength of the dealer's\r\nestimate of value, arguing that the animal must be worth more to\r\nhimself as a butcher, than to the dealer who has to sell again. I have\r\noften watched the crafty ways of such dealers not to give themselves\r\naway in this manner, and their methods of concealing their bids. One I\r\nparticularly noticed, whose habit was to stand just below the\r\nauctioneer's rostrum, facing the animal in the ring, with his back to\r\nthe auctioneer. When he wished to bid he raised his head very\r\nslightly, making a nod backwards to the auctioneer, who, knowing his\r\nman, was looking out for this method of attracting his attention.\r\n\r\nThough the ordinary farm sale is by far the most amusing and\r\npicturesque, the sale of pedigree stock is much more sensational. When\r\nthe shorthorn mania was at its height, and the merits of Bates and\r\nBooth blood were hotly debated, when such phrases as \"the sea-otter\r\ntouch,\" referring to the mossy coat of the red, white, or roan\r\nshorthorn, were heard, and the Americans were competing with our own\r\nbreeders in purchasing the best stock they could find--prices were\r\nhoisted to an extravagant height. There is no forming a \"knock-out\" at\r\na pedigree sale; sturdy competition is the only recognized method of\r\npurchase, and the sporting spirit is a strong incentive, especially\r\nwhen the vendor is known as a courageous buyer at the sales of the\r\nleading breeders.\r\n\r\nI attended the dispersal of a herd where the owner had been for years\r\none of these sporting buyers; he had, however, gone more for catalogue\r\nblue-blood than perceptible excellence, and the stock were brought\r\ninto the ring scarcely up to the exhibition form which a pedigree sale\r\ndemands. The American buyers were well represented, and the popularity\r\nof the vendor brought a great crowd of home buyers, so that the sale\r\nwent off with spirit. I chanced to sit next to the veterinary surgeon\r\nwho attended my own stock as well as the herd on offer, and it was\r\namusing to hear his confidential communications as the animals were\r\nsold at huge prices. He knew their faults and weaknesses\r\nprofessionally, and it was no breach of confidence, when a cow had\r\npassed through the ring and extracted a big figure from an American\r\nbuyer, to whisper them in my ear. I noticed that the Americans, no\r\ndoubt with commissions to buy a particular strain of pedigree,\r\nappeared to pay more attention to the catalogue than to the cattle\r\nthemselves, and I saw some sold at fancy prices, which I should really\r\nhave been sorry to see in my own non-pedigree herd. The sale was a\r\ngreat success, from the vendor's point of view at any rate, and I\r\nthink the average exceeded seventy guineas all round, including calves\r\nonly a few months old.\r\n\r\nSome years later I visited Shipston-on-Stour with two friends to\r\nattend a shorthorn sale in that neighbourhood. Mr. Thornton, the\r\nwell-known pedigree salesman, was the auctioneer. He waited about for\r\na long time after the hour fixed for the sale, until it became evident\r\nthat something had gone wrong. It appeared that the sheriff's\r\nrepresentative had served a writ on the vendor restraining the sale,\r\nand although it was stated that Thornton had offered a personal\r\nguarantee that the proceeds should be handed over to the sheriff, the\r\nrepresentative could not exceed his instructions, and the sale was\r\nabandoned. A large company, including many foreign buyers, had\r\nassembled; it was difficult to get these together at a postponement,\r\nand when the sale was proceeded with some weeks later, I fear the\r\nresult could scarcely have proved so satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe Vale of Evesham is particularly suitable for pedigree shorthorn\r\nbreeding, as the soil and climate are very favourable for their\r\nproduction according to exhibition type. It is otherwise with the\r\nJersey, for they quickly adapt themselves to the difference in their\r\nenvironment as compared with the conditions in their native Channel\r\nIsland. When I exchanged my shorthorns for Jerseys, owing to the\r\nforeign competition in the production of beef, which at sevenpence a\r\npound compared unfavourably with butter at fifteenpence, I imported my\r\ncows direct from the Island, and afterwards bred from their\r\ndescendants, selling the bull calves, and occasionally buying a young\r\nbull from Jersey. The blood was therefore kept absolutely pure, and,\r\nas I was a member of the English Jersey Society, all my stock were\r\nentered in the Herd Book.\r\n\r\nAs time went on my cattle presented a noticeable change from the\r\noriginal type; they were larger, developing much more hair and bone,\r\nand though they gained in strength of constitution, and were handsome\r\nand profitable, they gradually lost the dainty deer-like appearance of\r\nthe imported stock; and though quite as valuable for the purposes of\r\nthe dairy, they would have been regarded in the show ring by\r\nconnoisseurs as having a tendency to coarseness. I was, at first,\r\nsuccessful at the shows, but as the character of my cattle altered I\r\nrecognized that they would stand no chance against Jerseys bred on\r\nlighter land, and in a climate more nearly approximating to that of\r\ntheir native country.\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same thing happened with my pedigree Shropshire sheep;\r\nenvironment altered their character and produced a different\r\ntype--bone, wool, and size all increased. The wool was coarser and\r\ndarker in colour; they were good, useful, hardy stock, but could not\r\ncompete in quality with the pedigree sheep bred in their own county.\r\nNo pedigree Shropshire breeder will, as a rule, buy rams bred outside\r\nhis own district, for fear of introducing coarseness and an alteration\r\nof the established exhibition type.\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident happened at Mr. Graham's sale at Yardley near\r\nBirmingham, at which I was present. Mr. Graham had a reputation as a\r\nShropshire sheep-breeder; though not actually farming in the county,\r\nhis land was not unsuitable, and, on one occasion, I believe, he won\r\nthe first prize for a shearling ram at the show of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society of England.\r\n\r\nI noticed a very non-agricultural individual in a top hat, who tried\r\nto get into conversation with me and who succeeded in getting a\r\nluncheon ticket gratis. These sale luncheons were at the time very\r\nbountiful spreads, including plenty of champagne, and the man under my\r\nobservation made a very hearty meal. Short speeches and toasts always\r\nfollow, but an adjournment is quickly made to the sale tent, before\r\nthe evaporation of the effects of the hospitality. It is the custom\r\nfor a glove to be passed round to collect subscriptions for the\r\nshepherd, during the progress of the sale, and on this occasion two\r\nyoung fellows undertook the duty of collectors. The man, who had done\r\nhimself so well at Mr. Graham's expense, was evidently not buying or\r\neven making bids, and to each of the collectors he said he had already\r\ncontributed to the other. Being suspicious they compared notes, and\r\nfound that he had made the same excuse to both. Such meanness after\r\nthe hospitality he had received was intolerable; shouting, \"He's a\r\nWelsher,\" they lifted him bodily, protesting and struggling, rushed\r\nhim out of the tent into a neighbouring field, and cast him into a\r\ndirty pond covered with green and slimy duckweed! A miserable object\r\nhe scrambled out, for the pond was shallow, and took his dishevelled\r\nand bedraggled presence away as fast as he could limp along, amid the\r\nlaughter and jeers of the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe Hampshire Down ram sales in the palmy days of farming were\r\norganized upon the same scale of liberality, and while the sale was\r\nproceeding steam was kept up by handing round boxes of sixpenny\r\ncigars, and brandy and water in buckets. It is, of course, good policy\r\nto keep a company of buyers in good humour, but I think it has long\r\nsince been recognized that hospitality was carried a little too far in\r\nthose times of prosperity, and, in these degenerate if more\r\nbusiness-like days, extravagance is much less evident, though there is\r\na hearty welcome and abundance for all.\r\n\r\nAgricultural shows under favourable weather conditions are always\r\npopular and well-attended. The large exhibitions of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society of England, the Bath and West of England, and the\r\nRoyal Counties, especially attract immense crowds; much business in\r\nnovel implements, machinery, seeds, and artificial fertilizers, was\r\ndone when times were good, and the towns in which the shows are held\r\nbenefit by a large increase in general trade. The weather, however, is\r\nthe arbiter as to the attendance, upon which the financial result of\r\nthe show depends.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, the last of the miserable decade that ruined thousands of\r\nfarmers all over the country with almost continuous wet seasons, poor\r\ncrops, and wretched prices, the Royal Agricultural Society held its\r\nshow at Kilburn. The ground had been carefully prepared and adapted\r\nfor the great show with the usual liberal outlay; the work for next\r\nyear's show always commencing as soon as the show of the current year\r\nis over; but the site was situated on the stiff London clay, and,\r\nafter weeks of summer rains and the traffic caused by collecting the\r\nheavy engines and machinery and the materials used in the construction\r\nof the sheds and buildings, the ground was churned into a quagmire of\r\nclay and water, so that in places it was impassable, and some of the\r\nexhibits were isolated. Thousands of wattled hurdles were purchased in\r\nHampshire, and laid flat on the mud along the main routes to the tents\r\nand sheds, but they were quickly trodden in out of sight. Many\r\nponderous engines were bogged on their way to their appointed places;\r\nnothing could move them, and they remained looking like derelict\r\nwrecks, plastered with mud, sunk unevenly above the axles of their\r\nwheels.\r\n\r\nI attended the show and shall never forget the scene of disaster. One\r\nafternoon the Prince of Wales--the late King Edward--and a Royal party\r\nmade a gallant attempt, in carriages, to see the principal exhibits,\r\nand succeeded, by following a carefully selected and guarded route.\r\nThe crowd was dense by the side of the track, and people were making a\r\nharvest by letting out chairs to stand on, so as to get a view of the\r\nprocession, with cries of, \"'Ere you are, sir; 'ere you are, warranted\r\nnot to sink in more than a mile!\" Outside the show-yard, too, the\r\nstreets were lined with long rows of nondescripts, scraping the\r\nadhesive clay off the shoes of the people leaving the show.\r\n\r\nI had a pocket of my hops on exhibition entered in the Worcester\r\nclass, and had great difficulty in getting near it. I found the shed\r\nat last, deserted and surrounded by water, with a pool below the\r\nbenches on which the hops were staged. My pocket was sold straight\r\nfrom the show-yard, and when my factor sent in the account, I found\r\nthat the pocket had gained no less than seventeen pounds from the damp\r\nto which it had been subjected since it left my premises, about ten\r\ndays previously; hops, at that time, were worth about 1s. a pound, so\r\nthat the increased value more than balanced all expenses.\r\n\r\nA story is told of Tennyson at the Royal Counties show at Guildford.\r\nAccompanied by a lady and child he was walking round the exhibits,\r\nclosely followed by an ardent admirer, anxious to catch any nights of\r\nfancy that might fall from his lips. Time passed, and the poet showed\r\nno signs of inspiration until the party approached a refreshment tent;\r\nthen, to the lady he said, to the astonishment of the follower, \"Just\r\nlook after this child a minute while I go and get a glass of beer!\" I\r\ncannot vouch for the truth of this story, but I tell the tale as 'twas\r\ntold to me.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how long farm implements will last if kept in the dry\r\nand repaired when necessary. I remember a waggon at Alton in the\r\nseventies, which bore the name of the original owner and the date\r\n1795; it was still in use. When I decided to give up farming, or\r\nrather, when farming had given up me, I disposed of my stock and\r\nimplements by the usual auction sale. The attraction of a pedigree\r\nherd of Jerseys, and a useful lot of horses and implements, brought a\r\nlarge company together, and Aldington was a lively place that day. I\r\nwas talking to my son-in-law some time afterwards, and spoke with\r\namusement about the price an old iron Cambridge roller had made, not\r\nin the least knowing who was the purchaser, until he said, \"And _I was\r\nthe mug_ who bought it!\" I believe, however, that a year or two later\r\nit fully maintained its price when valued to the next owner, and\r\nprobably to-day it must be worth at least three times the money. I can\r\ntrace its history for a period of fifty-three years, and I don't think\r\nit was new at the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM SPECIALISTS.\r\n\r\n     \"And who that knew him could forget\r\n     The busy wrinkles round his eyes.\"\r\n                                       --_The Miller's Daughter_.\r\n\r\nMany specialists, in distinct professions, visited the farm in the\r\ncourse of every twelve months, and each appeared at the season when\r\nhis particular services were likely to be required. Among these an\r\nancient grafter was one of the most important, and April was the month\r\nwhich brought him to Aldington. In January we had usually beheaded\r\nsome trees that we considered not worth leaving as they were: these\r\nwould be trees producing inferior and nondescript cider apples, or\r\nperry pears. And we had already cut, and laid in a shady place, half\r\ncovered with soil, the young shoots of profitable sorts to furnish the\r\ngrafts for converting the beheaded trees into valuable producers.\r\n\r\nThe old man's function was to prepare the grafts, and unite them in\r\ndeftly-cut notches with their new parents. His was a rosy-cheeked and\r\nmany-wrinkled face, reminding one of an apple stored all the winter,\r\nand, in his brown velveteen coat, with immense pockets, he made a\r\nnotable figure. He loved a chat and was always happy and\r\ncommunicative, and his arrival seemed as much a herald of spring as\r\nthat of the welcome cuckoo. He was paid \"by the piece,\"\r\n\"three-halfpence a graft and cider,\" quantity not specified, but an\r\nimportant part of the bargain because of a superstition that grafts\r\n\"unwetted\" would not thrive! Some of these large trees would have ten\r\nor more limbs requiring separate grafting, and therefore they earned\r\nhim a considerable sum, but it is surprising how soon they make a new\r\nhead, come into bearing, and repay with interest the cost of the work.\r\n\r\nHe was a thoughtful old man and a moralist. I can see him now,\r\nstanding with his snuff-box open ready in his hand, and saying very\r\nsolemnly, \"I often thinks as an apple-tree is very similar to a child,\r\nfor you know, sir, we're told to train up a child in the way he shall\r\ngo, and when he is old he will not depart therefrom.\" He then\r\nrefreshed himself with a mighty pinch of snuff, closing his box with a\r\nsnap that emphasized his air of complete conviction.\r\n\r\nI think the sheep-dipper was one of the early arrivals. He brings with\r\nhim an apparatus which provides a bath, and a kind of gangway, rising\r\nat an angle from it, upon which the sheep can stand after immersion,\r\nto allow the superfluous liquid to find its way back into the bath;\r\neach sheep is lifted by two men into the bath containing insecticide,\r\nand has an interval for dripping before it rejoins the flock. In the\r\ndays when Viper was young, he was introduced to the process and given\r\na dip himself, much to his disgust; but that was the only time, for\r\never afterwards no sooner did the sheep-dipper and his weird-looking\r\napparatus appear at night, in readiness for the performance on the\r\nmorrow, than Viper remembered his undignified experience, and, before\r\neven the overture of the play commenced, vanished for the day. Nobody\r\nsaw him go, or knew where he went, but it was useless to call or\r\nwhistle, he was nowhere to be found.\r\n\r\nI believe the active ingredient of the dip was a preparation of\r\narsenic, and upon one occasion I lost several sheep after the dipping,\r\npresumably from arsenical poisoning absorbed through the skin. I met\r\nthe dipper a few days later, and he said with a beaming face that he\r\nhad \"given 'em summat,\" meaning the parasites. His smiles disappeared\r\nwhen I told him the result, and that the remedy had proved more fatal\r\nthan the disease. After this experience I used a more scientific dip\r\nwhich was quite as effective and without the element of danger to the\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nEntries are to be found in the old parish records of sums paid and\r\nchargeable to the parish for killing \"woonts\" (moles), but later\r\nprivate enterprise was alone responsible. A mole-catcher had been\r\nemployed throughout the whole of my predecessor's time at Aldington,\r\nwith a yearly remuneration of 12s. On my arrival he called and asked\r\nme to forward the account for the last year to his employer; it ran as\r\nfollows: \"To dastroyin thay woonts, 12s.\" The man hoped that I should\r\ncontinue the arrangement, but, as I had not seen a mole or a mole-hill\r\non the farm, I told him I would wait, and would send for him if I\r\nfound them troublesome. As a matter of fact I never saw a mole, or\r\nheard of one on my land, throughout the twenty-eight years of my\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nRat-catchers are necessary when rats are very numerous, but rats\r\nappear to be very capricious, abounding in some seasons and scarce in\r\nothers. My particular rat-catcher was not a very highly evolved\r\nspecimen of humanity; he was thin and hungry-looking with an angular\r\nface, bearing a strong resemblance to the creatures against whom he\r\nwaged warfare; he had a wandering, restless and furtive expression,\r\nand appeared to be perpetually on the lookout for his prey, or for\r\nmanifestations of their cunning and other evil characteristics in the\r\nhumanity with which he came in contact. His terms were, \"no cure, no\r\npay,\" which impressed one with his confidence in his own remedies; but\r\nthese were profound secrets, and I had to be content with the\r\nassurance that he used nothing harmful to man or domestic animals. He\r\nwas certainly successful, and effectually cleared the ricks and\r\nbuildings at one of my outlying places previously badly infested; no\r\ndead rats were ever found, but all disappeared very soon after I\r\nengaged him.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that rats will unexpectedly desert quarters which\r\nthey have occupied for a long time, and travel in large bodies to a\r\nnew locality. An old man told me that, in walking by the brook-side\r\nfootpath from Aldington to Badsey, he once encountered one of these\r\narmies; they looked so threatening and were in such numbers, that he\r\nhad to turn aside to allow them to pass, as they showed no signs of\r\ngiving way for him.\r\n\r\nOne morning my bailiff came in to say that a bean-rick had suddenly\r\nbeen taken possession of by an immense number of rats, where shortly\r\nbefore not one could have been found. A man going to the rick-yard\r\nquite early had seen the roof of the rick black with them; they were\r\napparently drinking the dew hanging in drops on the straws of the\r\nthatch. They were so close together, \"so thick,\" as he expressed it,\r\nthat one was killed by a stone thrown \"into the brown\" of them. We\r\nsent for the thrashing machine a day or two later, and killed over\r\nseventy, and many escaped. Every dead rat was plastered with mud\r\nunderneath, especially on their tails, and it was evident that they\r\nhad only just arrived when first seen, and had travelled some\r\ndistance, probably the evening before, along the clayey overhanging\r\nbank of the brook.\r\n\r\nWe always had great numbers of water-rats about brook; they are no\r\nrelation of the land-rat, having blunter, noses, shorter tails, and\r\nvery soft fur. They have not the loathsome appearance of the land-rat,\r\nand live, almost entirely, on water-weeds, rushes, and other vegetable\r\nmatter. It is pretty to see them swimming across a stream; they dive\r\nwhen alarmed, and remain out of sight a long time; they never leave\r\nthe water or the bank, and are quite innocent of depredations on corn.\r\n\r\nIn some counties, but not so far as I am aware in Worcestershire, one\r\nof the harmless snappers up of unconsidered trifles is the\r\ntruffle-hunter. At Alton, in Hampshire, one of these men appeared in\r\nsummer; he carried an implement like a short-handled thistle spud, but\r\nwith a much longer blade, similar to that of a small spade but\r\nnarrower; he was accompanied by a frisky little Frenchified dog,\r\nunlike any dog one commonly sees, and very alert. The hunting ground\r\nwas beneath the overhanging branches of beech-trees, growing on a\r\nchalky soil; the man encouraged the dog by voice to hunt the surface\r\nof the land regularly over; when the dog scented the truffles\r\nunderneath, he began to scratch, whereupon the implement came into\r\nuse, and they were soon secured. I have since been sorry that I did\r\nnot interview this truffle-hunter as to his methods and as to his dog,\r\nfor I believe he is no longer to be seen in his old haunts. But I did\r\nget a pound or two to try, and was disappointed by the absence of\r\nflavour. I have since read that the English truffle is considered very\r\ninferior to the French, which is used in making _pâté de foie gras_.\r\n\r\nThe wool-stapler makes his rounds as soon as shearing is completed;\r\nhis first call is to examine the fleeces, and if a deal results a\r\nsecond visit follows for weighing and packing. He is of course well up\r\nin market values, probably receiving a telegram every morning, when\r\ntrade is active, from the great wool-trade centre, Bradford. He is not\r\nunwilling to give a special price for quality, but will sometimes\r\nstipulate for secrecy as to the sum, because farmers, naturally,\r\ncompare notes, and everyone thinks himself entitled to the top price\r\nno matter how inferior or badly washed his wool may be. The Bradford\r\nstapler has the northern method of speech, which sounds unfamiliar in\r\nthe midland and southern counties, but it is not so cryptic as that of\r\nthe Scottish wool trade. The following colloquy is reported as having\r\npassed between two Scots over a deal in woollen cloth.\r\n\r\n_Buyer_. \"'Oo?\"\r\n\r\n_Seller_. \"Ay, 'oo.\"\r\n\r\n_Buyer_. \"A' 'oo?\"\r\n\r\n_Seller_. \"Ay, a' 'oo.\"\r\n\r\n_Buyer_. \"A' _a_ 'oo?\"\r\n\r\n_Seller_. \"Ay, a' _a_ 'oo.\"\r\n\r\nWhich, being interpreted, is: \"Wool?\"--\"Yes, wool.\" \"All wool?\"--\"Yes,\r\nall wool.\" \"All one wool?\"--\"Yes, all one wool.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the stapler arrives for the weighing he brings his steelyards and\r\nsheets; the wool is trod into the sheets, sewn up, and each sheet\r\nweighed separately, an allowance being made for \"tare\" (the weight of\r\nthe sheet), and for \"draught\" (1/2 a pound in each tod, or 28 pounds).\r\nThis last is a survival of the old method of weighing wool, when only\r\nenough fleeces were weighed at a time on the farmer's small machine to\r\ncome to a tod as nearly as possible. Buyers did not recognize anything\r\nbut level pounds (no quarters or halves), and consequently they got on\r\nthe average half a pound over the tod at each separate weighing,\r\ngratis.\r\n\r\nOwing to the immense importations of Australian wool, the price of\r\nEnglish, which at one time was half-a-crown a pound, fell to the\r\nmiserable figure of sevenpence or thereabouts. When I was in\r\nLincolnshire, the tenant of the farm where I was a pupil clipped 14\r\npounds each from 200 \"hoggs\" (yearling sheep), which at 2s. 6d. per\r\npound produced 35s. per sheep, equal to £350, so the fall of\r\nthree-quarters of the value was a serious loss.\r\n\r\nA story is told of a cunning wool buyer in the dim past weighing up\r\nwool on an upper floor of some farm premises. As the fleeces passed\r\nthe machine they were thrown down an opening to the floor beneath in\r\nreadiness for packing. The pile of wool upstairs had been there some\r\ntime, and was full of rats. As the fleeces were moved a rat would\r\nsometimes rush out trying to escape. No farm labourer can resist a rat\r\nhunt, so the buyer being left alone beside the still unmoved fleeces,\r\nwhenever a rat appeared, and the men scattered in every direction in\r\npursuit, he took the opportunity to kick a few fleeces unweighed down\r\nthe opening. When the owner came to reckon the quantity the buyer\r\nshould have had, and compared it with the weight, the fraud was\r\ndiscovered, and the deficiency had to be made good.\r\n\r\nI heard of a Hampshire farmer whose wife was anxious for a\r\ndrawing-room to be added to an inadequate farmhouse, and the tenant\r\nwith some difficulty persuaded the landlord to make the alteration.\r\nWhen the work was complete the farmer expressed the great satisfaction\r\nof his wife and himself with the addition, and the landlord was\r\nanxious to see the new room. Every time he suggested a day, the farmer\r\nobjected that it would be inconvenient to his wife, or that he himself\r\nwould be away from home. Time went on, and the landlord, finding it\r\nimpossible to arrange a day that was not objected to, made a surprise\r\nvisit, when shooting over the farm. The farmer protested as to the\r\ninconvenience, but the owner insisted, and was conducted to the new\r\ndrawing-room. The door was thrown open, and the room was seen to be\r\nstacked from floor to ceiling with wool, without a stick of furniture\r\nin the place!\r\n\r\nThe veterinary surgeon is a necessary, but not very welcome visitor,\r\nfor, of course, his attendance means disease or accident to the stock.\r\nHe is not often mistaken in his diagnosis, though his patient cannot\r\ndetail his symptoms, or point to the position of the trouble. But the\r\nvet is a man to be dispensed with as long as possible when epidemics,\r\nlike swine fever or foot and mouth disease, are raging in the\r\nneighbourhood, because he may be a Government Inspector at such times,\r\nand there is great danger to healthy stock if he has been officially\r\nemployed shortly before on an inspection. We had very little disease\r\nat Aldington, being off the highroad, but we had one bad attack of\r\nfoot and mouth disease which I always thought was brought by a\r\nveterinary surgeon. The complaint went all through my dairy cows and\r\nfattening bullocks, and soon reduced them to lean beasts, but it was\r\nsurprising how quickly they picked up again in flesh and resumed their\r\nnormal appearance. It was curious to notice that, with the cows\r\nstanding side by side in the sheds, the disease would attack one and\r\nmiss the next two perhaps, then attack two and miss one, and so on;\r\ndoubtless it was a matter of predisposition on the part of those\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nThe veterinary lecturer at Cirencester College told me that during the\r\ncattle plague in the sixties he had a coat well worth £50 to any\r\nveterinary surgeon, so impregnated was it with the infection. This man\r\nwas fond of scoring off the students, and had a habit at the\r\ncommencement of each lecture of holding a short _vivâ voce_\r\nexamination on the subject of the last. I remember when the tables\r\nwere turned upon him by a ready-witted student. The lecturer, who was\r\na superior veterinary surgeon, detailed a whole catalogue of\r\nexaggerated symptoms exhibited by an imaginary horse, and selecting\r\nhis victim added, with a chuckle, \"Now, Mr. K., perhaps you will\r\nkindly tell us what treatment you would adopt under these\r\ncircumstances?\" K. was not a very diligent student, and the lecturer\r\nexpected a display of ignorance, but his anticipated triumph was cut\r\nshort by the reply: \"Well, if I had a horse as bad as all that _I_\r\nshould send for the vet.\" The lecturer expostulated, but could get\r\nnothing further out of K., and was forced to recognize that the\r\ngeneral laugh which followed was against himself.\r\n\r\nAt a _post-mortem_, however, he was more successful in his choice of a\r\nbutt. A dead horse with organs exposed was the object before the\r\nclass, and the lecturer was asking questions as to their\r\nidentification. \"Now, Mr. Jones, perhaps you will show us where his\r\nlungs are?\" Jones made an unsuccessful search. \"Well, can we see where\r\nhis heart is?\" and so on--all failures. Finally and scornfully, \"Well,\r\nperhaps you can show the gentlemen where his tail is!\"\r\n\r\nThe village thatcher, Obadiah B., was an ancient, but efficient\r\nworkman when engaged upon cottages or farm buildings, for ricks\r\nrequire only a comparatively temporary treatment. He was paid by the\r\n\"square\" of 100 feet, and, although he was \"no scholard,\" and never\r\nused a tape, he was quite capable of checking by some method I could\r\nnever fathom my own measurements with it. The finishing touches to his\r\nwork were adjusted with the skill of an artist and the accuracy of a\r\nmathematician; and a beautiful bordering of \"buckles\" in an elaborate\r\npattern of angles and crosses--\"Fantykes\" (Van Dycks), his\r\nhard-working daughter Sally called them--completed the job. He\r\n\"reckoned\" that each thatching would last at least twenty years, and\r\nbeing well stricken in years, or \"getting-up-along\" as they say in\r\nHampshire, he would add gloomily, \"_I_ shall never do it no more.\" He\r\nwas a true prophet, for on every building he thatched for me the work\r\noutlived him, and even after the lapse of thirty years is not\r\ncompletely worn out.\r\n\r\nPassing him and his son in the village street, outside his house, when\r\nhe was packing fruit for market, I heard him, his voice raised for my\r\nbenefit, thus admonishing his son who was casually using some of the\r\nnewer hampers: \"Allus wear out the old, fust.\" But I must not\r\nattribute to his son the unfilial retort which another youth made\r\nunder similar circumstances, when told to fetch some more hampers from\r\na shed some distance away: \"No, father, _you_ fetch them, allus wear\r\nout the old fust, you know.\"\r\n\r\nOccasional visitors come with goods for sale in quest of orders, and\r\nsome are very persistent and difficult to get rid of. A man professing\r\nto sell some artificial fertilizer called upon me with a small tin\r\nsample box, containing a mixture which emitted a most villainous\r\nodour. He sniffed with appreciation at the compound, probably\r\nconsisting of some nitrogenous material such as wool treated with\r\nsulphuric or hydrochloric acid, and began his address. He had not gone\r\nfar before I remembered a story of a similar person in Hampshire. This\r\nman had called upon the leading farmers, and offered them a bargain,\r\nexplaining that some trucks of artificial manure that he had consigned\r\nto Walton Station had been sent by mistake to Alton. He sold many tons\r\nin this way without any guarantee as to the analysis, but the buyers\r\nfound on using it that it was worthless. The seller tried his game on\r\nagain the following year, without success. One farmer whom he followed\r\nfrom the farm-house to a turnip-field went so far as to show him his\r\nhunting-crop, and pointing to the field gate at the same time,\r\nintimated that if he did not with all speed place himself outside the\r\nlatter, he would make unpleasant acquaintance with the former. So now\r\nwhen my caller mentioned a truck of the manure which had come by\r\nmistake to Evesham Station, though consigned to Evershot in Somerset,\r\nmy suspicions were confirmed, and when I innocently remarked, \"I think\r\nI remember that truck, didn't it go to Alton once in mistake for\r\nWalton?\" his countenance fell, and he wished me \"good-morning\" in a\r\nhurry.\r\n\r\nHurdles in Worcestershire are generally made of \"withy\" (willow), and\r\nit is interesting to watch the hurdle-maker at work. The poles have\r\nfirst to be peeled, which can be done by unskilled labour, the pole\r\nbeing fixed in an improvised upright vice made from the same material.\r\nThen comes the skilled man, who cuts the poles into suitable lengths,\r\nand splits the pieces into the correct widths. Next with an axe he\r\ntrims off the rough edges, shapes the ends of the rails, and pierces\r\nthe uprights with a centre-bit. Then he completes the mortise in a\r\nmoment with a chisel, the rails being laid in position as guides to\r\nthe size of the apertures. The rails are then driven home into the\r\nmortise holes, and he skips backwards and forwards, over the hurdle\r\nflat on the ground, as he nails the rails to the heads; two pieces, in\r\nthe form of a V reversed, connect the rails and keep them in place.\r\n\r\nIn counties where hazel is grown in the coppices, a wattled or \"flake\"\r\nhurdle is the favourite, and they afford much more shelter to sheep in\r\nthe fold than the open withy hurdle, but, being more lightly made,\r\nthey require stakes and \"shackles\" to keep them in position. The hazel\r\nhurdle-maker may be seen in the coppice surrounded by his material and\r\nthe clean fresh stacks of the work completed. The process of\r\nmanufacture differs from that of the open-railed hurdle: he has an\r\nupright framework fixed to the ground with holes bored at the exact\r\nplaces for the vertical pieces, and indicating the correct length of\r\nthe hurdle, when finished. The horizontal pieces or rods are\r\ncomparatively slender and easily twisted, and so can be bent back\r\nwhere they reach the outside uprights, and they are interlaced with\r\nthe others in basket-making fashion. At this stage the hurdle presents\r\nan unfinished appearance, with the ends of the horizontal rods\r\nprotruding from the face of the hurdle. Then the maker with a special\r\nnarrow and exceedingly sharp hatchet chops off at one blow each of the\r\nprojecting ends, with admirable accuracy, never missing his aim or\r\nexceeding the exact degree of strength necessary to sever the\r\nsuperfluous bit without injuring the hurdle itself. The hurdle-maker\r\nis paid at a price per dozen, and he earns and deserves \"good money.\"\r\n\r\nThe art of making wattled hurdles is passed on and carried down from\r\nfather to son for generations; the hurdle-maker is usually a cheery\r\nman and receives a gracious welcome from the missus and the maids when\r\nhe calls at the farm-house, often emphasized by a pint of home-brewed.\r\nHe combines the accuracy of the draughtsman with the delicate touch of\r\nthe accomplished lawn-tennis player. His exits and his entrances from\r\nand to the scene of his labours are made in the remote mysterious\r\nsurroundings of the seldom-trodden woods; overhead is the brilliant\r\nblue of the clear spring sky; the sunshine lights up the quiet hazel\r\ntones of his simple materials, his highly finished work, and his heaps\r\nof clean fresh chips; and his stage is the newly cut coppice, carpeted\r\nwith primroses and wild hyacinths. I have never seen a representation\r\nof this charming scene, and I commend the subject to the\r\ncountry-loving artist as full of interest and colour, and as a theme\r\nof natural beauty.\r\n\r\nOur blacksmith came twice a week to the village when work was still\r\nplentiful in the early days of my farming, and I was not yet the only\r\npractical farmer in the place. I need not describe the forge: it has\r\nbeen sung by Longfellow, made music of by Handel, and painted by\r\nMorland; everybody knows its gleaming red-hot iron, its cascades of\r\nsparks, and the melodious clank of the heavy hammer as it falls upon\r\nthe impressionable metal. In all pursuits which entail the use of an\r\nopen fire at night, its fascination attracts both busy and idle\r\nvillagers, and more especially in winter it becomes a centre for local\r\ngossip. At that season the time-honoured gossip corner, close to the\r\nManor gate, was deserted for the warmth and action of the forge.\r\nBlacksmiths, like other specialists, vary, and the difference may be\r\nexpressed as that between the man who fits the shoe to the hoof, and\r\nthe man who fits the hoof to the shoe--in other words, the workman and\r\nthe sloven. Doubtless many a slum-housed artisan in the big town,\r\ndriven from his country home by the flood of unfair foreign\r\ncompetition, looks back with longing to the bright old cottage garden\r\nof his youth and in his dreams hears the music of the forge, sees the\r\nblazing fire, and sniffs the pungency of scorching hoof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAIRY--CATTLE--SHEEP--LAMBS--PIGS--POULTRY.\r\n\r\n     \"And brushing ankle-deep in flowers,\r\n        We heard behind the woodbine veil\r\n       The milk that bubbled in the pail,\r\n     And buzzings of the honied hours.\"\r\n                                      --_In Memoriam_.\r\n\r\nMy farm had the reputation of being a good cheese farm, but a bad\r\nbutter farm; in spite, however, of this tradition I determined to\r\nestablish a pedigree Jersey herd for butter-making. For early in my\r\noccupation I had abandoned the cheese manufacture of my predecessor\r\nand later the production of unprofitable beef. My wife attended\r\nvarious lectures and demonstrations and was soon able to prove that\r\nthe bad character of the farm for this purpose was not justified.\r\nWithin a few years she covered one wall of the dairy with prize cards\r\nwon at all the leading shows, and found a ready market for the\r\nproduce, chiefly by parcel post to friends. The butter, although it\r\ncommanded rather a better price than ordinary quality, was considered\r\nnot only by them but by the villagers more economical, as owing to its\r\nsolidity and freedom from butter milk, it would keep good\r\nindefinitely, and \"went much further.\"\r\n\r\nThe cream from my Jerseys was so thick that the cream crock could be\r\nlifted up by the wooden spoon used for stirring, by merely plunging it\r\ninto the crock full of cream and raising it, without touching the\r\ncrock in any other way. With fifteen cows and heifers in milk on an\r\naverage, the Jerseys brought me in quite £300 a year in butter and\r\ncream, without considering the value of the calves, and of the\r\nskim-milk for the pigs, and they were worth a good deal besides from\r\nthe æsthetic point of view. I think that the word \"dainty\" describes\r\nthe Jersey better than any other adjective; their beautiful lines and\r\ncolouring in all shades of fawn and silver grey make them a continual\r\ndelight to behold. After all, however, the shorthorn is a magnificent\r\ncreature; they, too, have their aesthetic side; the outline is more\r\nrobust, their colouring more pronounced, and I think that \"stately\" is\r\nthe best description to apply to their distinguished bearing.\r\n\r\nAt Worcester, on market days, a great deal of butter is brought in by\r\nthe country people and retailed in the Market Hall, and many of these\r\nfarmers' wives and daughters have regular customers, who come each\r\nweek for their supply. On one occasion when the inspector of weights\r\nand measures was making a surprise visit, and testing the weights of\r\nthe goods on offer, a man, standing near a stall where only one pound\r\nof butter was left unsold, noticed that as soon as the owner became\r\naware of the inspector's entrance, she slipped two half-crowns into\r\nthe pat, obliterating the marks where they had been inserted. She was\r\nevidently aware that the butter was not full weight, but with the\r\naddition it satisfied the inspector's test, the two half-crowns just\r\nbalancing the one ounce short. No sooner was he gone than the\r\nspectator came forward to buy the butter. She guessed that he had seen\r\nthe trick, and dared not refuse to sell, although she tried hard to\r\navoid doing so; so the cunning buyer walked off with fifteen ounces of\r\nbutter worth 1s. 2d., and 5s. in silver for his outlay of 1s. 3d.\r\n\r\nIn farm-houses where old-fashioned ways of butter-making are still\r\nfollowed, and the thermometer is ignored, it happens sometimes that\r\nafter some hours' churning the butter does not \"come.\" The traditional\r\nremedy is then tried of introducing one or two half-crowns into the\r\nchurn, partly, I think, as a kind of charm, and partly with the idea\r\nof what is called \"cutting the curd.\" The remedy is certainly\r\nsometimes successful, probably the coins set up a new movement in the\r\nrotating cream, which causes an almost immediate appearance of the\r\nbutter. On the outside of the framework of the windows in some of\r\nthese old places, the word \"dairy\" or \"cheese-room\" may still be seen,\r\npainted or incised. This is a survival from the days of the window\r\ntax, and was necessary to claim the exemption which these rooms as\r\nplaces of business enjoyed by law.\r\n\r\nMy former tutor, the late vicar of Old Basing in Hampshire, decided to\r\nkeep a cow on his glebe, and consulted the old parish clerk as to the\r\nkind of cow he would recommend. The old man was the oracle of the\r\nvillage on all matters secular as well as those connected with his\r\ncalling. \"Well,\" he said, \"what you wants is a nice pretty little cow,\r\nnot a great big beast as'll stand a-looking and a-staring at you all\r\nday long.\" The vicar followed his advice, avoided the stony regard of\r\nan unintelligent animal, and purchased a charming little tender-eyed\r\nBrittany, which was quite an ornament to his meadow.\r\n\r\nPeople were very shy of American beef when first imported but, being\r\nlower in price than English it was bought by those who were willing to\r\nsacrifice quality to cheapness. It was said that the most inferior\r\nEnglish was sold under the name of American, the best of the American\r\ndoing duty for medium quality English. I remember seeing a very\r\nancient and poverty-stricken cow knocked down to a Birmingham dealer,\r\nwho exclaimed exultingly as the hammer fell, \"I'll make 'em some\r\n'Merican biff in Brummagem this week.\"\r\n\r\nThe neglected and overgrown hedges, now so often seen on what was\r\nformerly good wheat-growing land, have a useful side as shelter when\r\nsurrounding pasture. In the bitter winds which often occur in May,\r\nwhen the cattle are first turned out after a winter in the yards well\r\nlittered with clean straw, they can be seen on the southern side\r\nprotected from the blast. Referring to the May blossom of the\r\nwhite-thorn, an old proverb says, with a faulty rhyme:\r\n\r\n     \"May come early or May come late\r\n     'Tis sure to make the old cow quake.\"\r\n\r\nMay Day has always been the customary date for turning out cattle to\r\ngrass, but people forget that old May Day was nearly a fortnight\r\nlater, which makes a great difference as to warmth and keep at that\r\ntime of year.\r\n\r\nWith changes of dates and times old customs and sayings lose their\r\nforce. Under the \"daylight saving\" arrangement we should alter, \"Rain\r\nbefore seven, fine before eleven,\" to \"Rain before eight, fine before\r\ntwelve,\" which spoils the rhyme. And \"Between one and two, you'll see\r\nwhat the day means to do,\" into, \"Between two and three, you'll see\r\nwhat the day means to be.\"\r\n\r\nA few years ago, when _Antony and Cleopatra_ was reproduced at a\r\nLondon theatre by an eminent actor-manager, it was reported that his\r\nmind was much exercised over the lines referring to the flight of\r\nPompey's galley:\r\n\r\n     \"The breese upon her, like a cow in June,\r\n     Hoists sails and flies.\"\r\n\r\nIt was suggested that for \"cow,\" the correct reading should be \"crow,\"\r\nwho might very well spread her wings to the breeze and fly. The\r\ndifficulty was caused by the word \"breese\" (the gad-fly)--no doubt\r\npresumed to be an archaic spelling of \"breeze.\" Shakespeare knew all\r\nabout farming, as about nearly everything else, and a year on a farm\r\nwould illustrate many of his allusions which the ordinary reader finds\r\nsomewhat cryptic; anyone who has seen the terrified stampede of cattle\r\nwith their tails erect when attacked by the gad-fly, will recognize\r\nthe force of the simile. The gad-fly pierces the skin of the animal,\r\nlaying its eggs beneath, just as the ichneumon makes use of a\r\ncaterpillar to provide a host for its progeny. No doubt the operation\r\nis a painful one, but the caterpillar may survive, even into its\r\nchrysalis stage, and the cow in due time is relieved, after an\r\nuncomfortable experience, by the exit of the maggot or fly.\r\n\r\nA branch of the Roman road, Ryknield Street, commonly called Buckle\r\nStreet, leaving the former near Bidford-on-Avon and running over the\r\nCotswolds via Weston Subedge, was known in former times as Buggilde or\r\nBuggeld Street, derived possibly from the Latin _buculus_, a young\r\nbullock. No doubt vast herds of cattle traversed the road from the\r\nvale to the hills, or vice versa, according to the abundance of keep\r\nand the time of year. Similar roads in Dorset and Wiltshire are still\r\nknown as \"ox droves,\" and in the former county, at least, both young\r\nheifers and bullocks are known as \"bullicks.\"\r\n\r\nCattle are subject to all manner of disorders which, though puzzling\r\nto the owner to diagnose, are not as a rule beyond the skill of a good\r\nveterinary surgeon to alleviate; but there are also accidents which\r\nare much more annoying, being impossible to foresee. I had occasional\r\nlosses from the latter causes: once in the night when a cow was thrown\r\non her back into a deep brick manger; and once when a small piece of\r\nsacking, part of a decorticated cotton-cake bag, was somehow mixed in\r\nwith the food, and induced internal inflammation.\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult matter for a farmer when selling fat cattle direct\r\nto the butcher, to compete with him in a correct estimate of the\r\nweight, and it is therefore advisable to sell at a price per pound of\r\nthe dead weight when dressed; this, however, is not always feasible,\r\nand a very close estimate can be arrived at by measurement of the\r\ngirth and length of the live animal, following rules laid down in the\r\nhandbooks on the subject of fat stock. It is a mistake to suppose that\r\nthe fattening of stock is a profitable undertaking _per se_. On all\r\narable farms there is a certain amount of food, hay, straw, chaff,\r\nroots, etc., which must be consumed on the premises for the sake of\r\nkeeping up the fertility of the land, but I believe that only under\r\nvery exceptional circumstances can a shilling's-worth of food and\r\nattendance be converted into a shilling's-worth of meat, so that if in\r\nthe future the price of corn is to fall back into anything approaching\r\npre-war values, the corn crops, as well as the intermediate green\r\ncrops, which are only a means for producing corn, must be\r\ndiscontinued, and the land will again become inferior pasture.\r\nOld-fashioned farmers recognized the absence of direct profit in the\r\nwinter of fattening cattle especially on the produce of arable land,\r\nand the saying is well known that, \"the man who fattens many bullocks\r\nnever wants much paper on which to make his will.\"\r\n\r\nThere are few pleasanter sights about farm premises than to see, as\r\nthe short winter day is drawing to an end, and the twilight is\r\nstealing around the ricks and buildings, a nicely sheltered yard full\r\nof contented cattle deeply bedded down in clean bright wheat straw,\r\nand settling themselves comfortably for the night; and, when one pulls\r\nthe bed-clothes up to one's ears, one can go to sleep thinking happily\r\nthat they too are enjoying a refreshing sleep. Cattle and sheep can\r\nstand severe cold, if they are sheltered from bitter winds and have\r\ndry quarters in which to lie; even lambs are none the worse for coming\r\ninto the world in a snow-covered pasture; and an opened stable window\r\nwithout a draught will often cure a horse of a long-standing chronic\r\ncough. It was pitiful in the early days of the war to see the Indian\r\ntroops with their mountain batteries at Ashurst, near Lyndhurst, in\r\nthe New Forest, the mules up to their knees and hocks in black mud,\r\nowing to the unfortunate selection of an unsound site for the camp.\r\n\r\nA \"deadly man for ship\"--one of those expressions not uncommon in\r\nWorcestershire, on the _lucus a non lucendo_ principle--signifies a\r\ncelebrated sheep breeder; the word \"deadly,\" in this sense, is akin to\r\nthe Hampshire and Dorset \"terrible,\" or, \"turrble,\" as a term of\r\nadmiration or the appreciation of excellence; but there are occasions\r\neven in the most carefully tended flocks where accidents cannot be\r\nanticipated. Such an event occurred to a Cotswold ram, which after\r\nwashing was placed in an orchard near my house to dry before shearing.\r\nThe ram had an immense fleece on him, nineteen pounds as it afterwards\r\nproved, and the wool round the neck was somewhat ragged. As he lay\r\nasleep with his head turned round and muzzle pointing backwards, some\r\nlittle movement caused his head to become entangled in the loose wool,\r\nand he was found hanged in his own fleece.\r\n\r\nI was watching, with my bailiff, a splendid lot of lambs fat and ready\r\nfor the butcher; two of them were having a game--walking backwards\r\nfrom each other, and suddenly rushing together like two knights in a\r\nmedieval tournament, their heads meeting with a concussion and a\r\nresounding smack--when one instantly fell to the ground with a broken\r\nneck. Had no one been present the meat would have been worthless, but\r\nmy man was equal to the occasion, and, borrowing my pocket knife,\r\nproduced the flow of blood necessary to render the meat fit for human\r\nfood. My villagers had a feast that week, and my own table was graced\r\nby an excellent joint of real English lamb. Of course we never\r\nattempted to consume any of the meat from animals which had been\r\nkilled when suffering from a doubtful complaint, though some people\r\nare by no means particular in this matter.\r\n\r\nA doctor told me that when attending a case at a farmhouse he was\r\ninvited to join the family at their midday meal, and was surprised to\r\nsee a nice fore-quarter of lamb on the table. His host gave him an\r\nample helping, and he had just made a beginning with it and the mint\r\nsauce, green peas, and new potatoes, when the founder of the feast\r\nannounced by way of excusing the indulgence in such a luxury: \"This\r\nun, you know was a bit casualty, so we thought it better to make sure\r\nof un.\" My informant told me that then and there his appetite\r\ncompletely failed, and, to the dismay of his host he had to relinquish\r\nhis knife and fork.\r\n\r\nIt is always policy to kill a sheep to save its life, as the saying\r\nis, and the way to make the most of it is to send any fat animal,\r\nwhich is off its feed and looking somewhat thoughtful, to the butcher\r\nat once. He knows quite well whether the sheep is fit for food, and if\r\nhe decides against it, all one expects is the value of the skin. But\r\npeople are very shy of buying meat about which they have any\r\nmisgiving, and my butcher once told me not to send him an \"emergency\r\nsheep\" _in one of my own carts_, but to ask him to fetch it himself:\r\n\"It's like this,\" he explained, \"when a customer comes in for a nice\r\njoint of mutton, if he is a near neighbour, he will perhaps add, 'I\r\nwould rather not have a bit of the sheep that came in a day or two ago\r\nin one of Mr. S.'s carts'!\"\r\n\r\nIt was always cheering in February, \"fill dyke, be it black or be it\r\nwhite,\" on a dark morning, to hear the young lambs and their mothers\r\ncalling to each other in the orchards, where there is some grass all\r\nthe year round under the shelter of the apple trees; or when a\r\nspringlike morning appears, about the time of St. Valentine's Day, and\r\nthe thrushes are singing love-songs to their mates, and the first\r\nbrimstone butterfly has dared to leave his winter seclusion for the\r\nfickle sunshine, to realize that Spring is coming, and the active work\r\nof the farm is about to recommence. There is a superstition that when\r\nthe master sees the firstling of the flock, if its head is turned\r\ntowards him, good luck for the year will follow, but it is most\r\nunlucky if its head is turned away.\r\n\r\nAfter the disastrous wet season of 1879 immense losses ensued from the\r\nprevalence of the fatal liver rot; many thousands of sheep were sold\r\nat the auctions for 3s. or 4s. apiece, and sound mutton was\r\nexceedingly scarce and dear. It was represented to a very August\r\npersonage, that if the people could be induced to forgo the\r\nconsumption of lamb, these in due course would grow into sheep, and\r\nthe price of mutton would be reduced. Accordingly an order was issued\r\nforbidding the appearance of lamb on the Court tables. It had not\r\noccurred to the proposer of this scheme that a scarcity of food for\r\nthe developing lambs would result, nor was it understood that the\r\nproducers of fat lambs make special cropping arrangements for their\r\nkeep, with the object of clearing out their stock about Easter, in\r\ntime to plough the ground, and follow the roots where the ewes and\r\nlambs have been feeding, with barley. The \"classes\" copied the example\r\nof the Court, as in duty bound, and the demand fell to zero. But the\r\nlambs had to be sold for the reasons mentioned, and, in the absence of\r\nthe usual demand, the unfortunate producers offered them at almost any\r\nprice. The miners and the pottery workers in Staffordshire were not so\r\nloyal as the \"classes\"; they welcomed the unusual opportunity of\r\nbuying early lamb at 9d. a pound, and trains composed entirely of\r\ntrucks full of lambs from the south of England to the Midlands\r\nsupplied them abundantly.\r\n\r\nThe edict, when its effect was apparent, was therefore revoked, but it\r\nwas too late, the lambs were gone, and as everybody was hungry for his\r\nusual Easter lamb, the demand was immense, and the price rose in\r\nproportion. I had thirty or forty lambs intended for the Easter\r\nmarkets, and had, with great difficulty and the sacrifice of grass\r\nwhich should have stood for hay, managed to keep them on, scarcely\r\nknowing what to do with them. But the sudden demand arose just in\r\ntime, and I sent them to the Alcester auction sale, where buyers from\r\nBirmingham and the neighbourhood attend in large numbers. A capital\r\nsale resulted, the price going as high as 60s., in those days a big\r\nfigure for lambs about four months old. I was so pleased with the\r\nresult and my deliverance from the dilemma, that, passing through the\r\ntown on my way home, and spying an old Worcester china cup and saucer,\r\nand a bowl o£ the same, all with the rare square mark, I invested some\r\nof my plunder in what time has proved an excellent speculation, and my\r\ncabinet is still decorated with these mementoes, which I never see\r\nwithout calling to mind the story of the lamb edict and its result.\r\n\r\nDuring the Great War some controlling wiseacre evolved precisely the\r\nsame scheme for bringing about an imaginary increase in the supply of\r\nmutton, by prohibiting the slaughter of any lambs until June. The\r\nDorset breeders, who buy in ewes at high prices for the special\r\nproduction of early lamb--the lambs of this breed are born in October\r\nand November--were more particularly affected, and the absurdity of\r\nthe prohibition having been later represented to the authorities, the\r\norder was withdrawn, though not before great loss and difficulty were\r\ninflicted upon the unfortunate producers. It goes to prove the\r\nnecessity of the administration of such matters by competent men, and\r\nhow easily apparently sound theory in inexperienced hands may conflict\r\nwith economical practice.\r\n\r\nOf late years the competition of the importations of New Zealand lamb\r\nhas reduced the price of English lamb to an unremunerative level. This\r\nthin dry stuff bears about the same resemblance to real fat home-grown\r\nlamb, as do the proverbial chalk and cheese to each other; but it is\r\ngood enough for the restaurants and eating-houses; and the consumer\r\nwho lacks the critical faculty of the connoisseur in such matters,\r\ndevours his \"Canterbury\" lamb, well disguised with mint sauce, in\r\nsublime ignorance, and, apparently, without missing the succulence of\r\nthe real article--convinced as he is that it was produced in the\r\nneighbourhood of the cathedral city of the same name, and unaware of\r\nthe existence of such a place as Canterbury in New Zealand, or that\r\nthe name, if not exactly a fraud, is calculated to mislead. Doubtless\r\nit is the mint sauce that satisfies the uncritical palate. Just as the\r\nboy who, when asked after a treat of oysters how he liked them, said\r\nwith gusto, \"The oysters was good, but the vinegar and pepper was\r\n_de_licious!\"\r\n\r\nIt is well known that there is a tendency among men in charge of\r\nspecial kinds of domestic animals gradually to approximate to them in\r\nappearance, and we are told that men sometimes gradually acquire a\r\nresemblance to men they admire. I knew a pedigree-pig herdsman, very\r\nsuccessful in the show-ring, who was curiously like his charges, and I\r\nhad at least two shepherds whose profiles were extraordinarily\r\nsheepish--though not in the ordinary acceptation of the term. Such an\r\nappearance confers a singularly simple expression. It must have been a\r\nman whose character justified such a facial peculiarity, who, having\r\nto bring the flock of one of my neighbours over a railway crossing\r\nbetween two of his fields, neglected to open the further gate first,\r\ndrove the sheep on to the rails, and proceeded to do so, only to find\r\nthe sheep, in the meantime, had wandered down the line. Before he\r\ncould collect them a train dashed into them, and many were killed and\r\nothers injured. The railway company not only repudiated all liability,\r\nbut sent in a counterclaim for damage to their engine!\r\n\r\nBut the tables were turned morally, if not actually, by a friend of\r\nmine, who certainly scored off a railway company. My friend's waggon,\r\nwith two horses and a load of hay, was passing over a level crossing\r\non his land, when the London express came into view slinging downhill\r\nin all the majesty of triumphant speed, but far enough away to be\r\nbrought up in time, ignominiously and abruptly. The railway company\r\nwrote my friend a letter of remonstrance suggestive of pains and\r\npenalties, and telling him that his waggoner should have made sure of\r\nthe safety of crossing before attempting it--not an easy thing to do\r\nat this particular place. My friend replied that his right of way\r\nexisted centuries before the railway was dreamed of, that the crossing\r\nwas a concession for the company's convenience, it had saved the\r\nexpense of a bridge, and that his hay was an urgent matter in view of\r\nthe weather; and that uninterrupted harvesting was of more importance\r\nthan the punctuality of their passengers.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes passed through a remote village on a Sunday where the\r\nobsequies of a pig were to be seen in full view from the road; these\r\nwere usually places where the church was in an adjoining\r\nmother-parish, and of course there are times when, for reasons of\r\nhealth or perhaps more correctly ill-health, it is impossible to defer\r\nthe ceremony. As a rule, I should imagine that greater privacy is\r\nsought, at any rate so far as the public point of view is concerned.\r\nOne remembers the story of the man doing some Sunday carpentering; his\r\nwife expostulated with him as a Sabbath breaker; he replied that in\r\ndriving in the nails he could not help making some noise; \"then why,\"\r\nsaid she, \"don't you use screws?\"\r\n\r\nAn old Dorset labourer who helped with the removal of the pig-wash,\r\nand did other small jobs for successive tenants of mine at a furnished\r\ncottage on my land in Hampshire, invariably estimated the social\r\nstatus and resources of each new tenant by the consistency of the\r\nwash. When some rather extravagant occupiers were in possession, he\r\nreported them as, \"Quite the right sort; their wash is real good,\r\nthick stuff.\" The villagers at Aldington did not smoke their bacon,\r\nbut, as it usually hung in the kitchen not far from the big open\r\nhearth, and as the place was often full of fragrant wood smoke, the\r\nbacon acquired a pleasant suggestion of the smoked article of the\r\nsouthern counties. The cottagers rarely complained of the smoky state\r\nof their kitchens, consoling themselves with the saying, \"'Tis better\r\nto be smoke-dried nor starred [starved with the cold] to death.\" Bacon\r\nnaturally suggests eggs; many of the villagers kept a few fowls which\r\nsometimes strayed into my orchards; as a rule, I made no objection,\r\nbut it was not pleasing, when the apples were over-ripe and dropping\r\nfrom the trees, to notice the destructive marks of their beaks on some\r\nextra fine Blenheim oranges.\r\n\r\nMy wife determined to take over our fowls into her own jurisdiction;\r\nhitherto they had been under my bailiff's care, and he rather resented\r\nthe change as an implication on his management, until it was explained\r\nthat she was anxious to undertake the poultry as a hobby. One of the\r\ncarter boys was detailed to collect the eggs, as some of the\r\nhen-houses were in out-of-the-way corners of the yards and difficult\r\nto approach. My wife thought the middleman was appropriating most of\r\nthe profit; she was determined to get as directly to the consumer as\r\npossible and, among others, she arranged with the head of a large\r\nschool for a weekly supply of dairy and poultry produce. All went well\r\nfor a time until one day the boy, anxious to produce as many eggs as\r\npossible, as he received a royalty per dozen for collecting,\r\ndiscovered some nests which my man had set for hatching before he\r\nretired from the post. The boy, not recognizing this important fact,\r\ncame in greatly pleased with an unusually large quantity, and it so\r\nhappened that the school received the eggs from this special lot. Next\r\nmorning forty eggs appeared at the boys' breakfast table, and forty\r\nboys simultaneously suffered a terrible shock on the discovery of\r\nforty incomplete chickens. The head wrote an aggrieved letter of\r\ncomplaint, and though my wife was by that time able to explain the\r\nmatter, and regret her own loss too of forty chickens, he removed his\r\ncustom to a more reliable source.\r\n\r\nThis schoolmaster was a collector of antique furniture and china, and,\r\nknowing that I was interested, he asked me to come and see some\r\nChippendale chairs he had just acquired. It happened that some months\r\nbefore I had declined to buy four or five chairs that were offered at\r\n10s. apiece. I had not then fully developed the taste for the antique,\r\nwhich once acquired forbids the connoisseur to refuse anything good,\r\nwhether really wanted or not, and at that time there was much more\r\nchoice in such matters than at the present day. The chairs were very\r\ndilapidated and I did not recognize their possibilities, but I noticed\r\nthe arms of the elbow chairs were particularly good, being carved at\r\nthe junction of the horizontal and vertical pieces with eagles' heads.\r\nDeciding that I did not want them I sent a dealer to the house and\r\nforgot all about the matter. The schoolmaster took me into his\r\ndrawing-room, and I instantly recognized the set I had refused; they\r\nwere quite transformed, nicely cleaned, lightly polished, and the\r\nseats newly covered. I duly admired them, and on inquiry found that he\r\nhad purchased them in Worcester from the dealer I had sent to look at\r\nthem; they cost him £5 each, and I suppose at the present time they\r\nwould be worth £20 apiece at least.\r\n\r\nI have previously mentioned old Viper as a family friend, but like all\r\ndogs he had his faults. He acquired a liking for new laid eggs and\r\nhunted the rickyard for nests in the straw. My bailiff determined to\r\ncure him; he carefully blew an egg, and filled it with a mixture of\r\nwhich mustard was the chief component. Viper was tempted to sample the\r\negg, which he accepted with a great show of innocence; the effect when\r\nhe had broken the shell was electrical; he fled with downcast tail and\r\ncomplete dejection, and nothing would ever induce him to touch an egg\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe whirligig of time has indeed brought its revenge in the matter of\r\nthe market value of eggs. In Worcestershire we have had to give them\r\naway at eighteen or twenty for a shilling; last (1918-1919) winter we\r\nsold some at 7s. a dozen, and many more at 5s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORCHARDS--APPLES--CIDER--PERRY.\r\n\r\n     \"Lo! sweetened with the summer light,\r\n     The full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow\r\n     Drops in a silent autumn night.\"\r\n                                     --_The Lotus-Eaters_.\r\n\r\nA curious old punning Latin line, illustrating various meanings of the\r\nword _malus_, an apple, seems appropriate, as a commencement, to\r\nwriting about apples; it is I think very little known, and too good to\r\nbe forgotten. _Malo, malo, malo, malo_; it is translated thus:\r\n\r\n     \"_Malo_, I would rather be,\r\n      _Malo_, in an apple-tree,\r\n      _Malo_, than a bad boy,\r\n      _Malo_, in adversity.\"\r\n\r\nThe fruit was an important item on the Aldington Manor Farm, and when\r\nlater I bought an adjoining farm of seventy acres with orcharding, and\r\nhad planted nine acres of plum trees, my total fruit area amounted to\r\nabout thirty acres. There was a saying in the neighbourhood which\r\npleased me greatly, that \"it was always harvest at Aldington\"; it was\r\nnot so much intended to signify that there was always something coming\r\nin, as to convey an impression of the constant activity and employment\r\nof labour that continued throughout the seasons without intermission,\r\nthough it was true that with the diversity of my crops and stock,\r\nthere was a more or less continuous return. I had a shock when an old\r\nfriend in a neighbouring village spoke of me as a \"pomologist,\" the\r\ntitle seemed much too distinguished, and personally I have never\r\nclaimed the right to anything better than the rather pretty old title\r\nof \"orchardist.\"\r\n\r\nThe position of an orchard is of the utmost importance; shelter is\r\nnecessary, but it must be above the ordinary spring frost level of the\r\ndistrict. I should say that no orchard should be less than 150 feet\r\nabove sea-level, to be fairly safe, and 200 feet would in nearly any\r\nordinary spring be quite secure against frost. The climate has a\r\nremarkable effect upon the colour of apples, and colour is one of the\r\nmost valuable of market properties, for the ordinary town buyer is a\r\npoor judge of the merits of apples and prefers colour and size to most\r\nother considerations. Here in the south of England seven miles from\r\nthe sea, in a dry and sunny climate, all apples develop a much more\r\nbrilliant colour than in the moist climate of the Vale of Evesham.\r\n\r\nI fear that very few planters of fruit trees think of following the\r\nroutine which Virgil describes in his second _Georgic_, as practised\r\nby the careful orchardist, when transplanting. Dryden's translation is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Some peasants, not t' omit the nicest care,\r\n     Of the same soil their nursery prepare\r\n     With that of their plantation; lest the tree,\r\n     Translated should not with the soil agree.\r\n     Beside, to plant it as it was, they mark\r\n     The heav'ns four quarters on the tender bark,\r\n     And to the north or south restore the side,\r\n     Which at their birth did heat or cold abide:\r\n     So strong is custom; such effects can use\r\n     In tender souls of pliant plants produce.\"\r\n\r\nVirgil was born in the year 70 B.C., and died, age 51, in 19 B.C., so\r\nthat over nineteen centuries have elapsed since these words were\r\nwritten; as he was an excellent farmer, he would not have mentioned\r\nthe practice unless he considered the advice sound. It is quite\r\npossible that the vertical cracking of the bark on one side of a young\r\ntransplanted tree may be due to a change from the cool north aspect to\r\nthe heat of the south. At any rate the experiment is well worth\r\ntrying, and nurserymen would not find it much trouble to run a chalk\r\nline down the south side of each tree, when lifting them, as a guide\r\nfor the purchaser.\r\n\r\nAs showing how conservative is the popular demand for apples, Cox's\r\nOrange Pippin, which is absolutely unapproached for flavour, and is\r\nperfectly sound and eatable from early in November till Easter if\r\ncarefully picked at the right moment and properly stored, was\r\ncultivated thirty or forty years before the British public discovered\r\nits extraordinary qualities! I find it described as one of the best\r\ndessert apples in Dr. Hogg's _Fruit Manual_, and my copy is the third\r\nedition published in 1866, so it must have been well known to him some\r\nyears previously, though we never heard much about it until after the\r\ntwentieth century came in. Though the colour, when well grown, is\r\nhighly attractive to the connoisseur, the ordinary buyer did not\r\nreadily take to it as it is rather small. In 1917 Cox's Orange Pippin,\r\nhowever, really came into its own; I myself, here in the New Forest,\r\ngrew over 3,000 pounds on about 120 trees planted in 1906, each branch\r\npruned as a _cordon_, and very thinly dispersed, and the trees\r\nrestricted to a height of about 14 feet. The apples were mostly sold\r\nin Covent Garden at 6d. a pound, clear of railway carriage and\r\nsalesmen's commission. In 1918, a year of great scarcity, these apples\r\nwere selling in the London shops up to 3s. 6d. apiece! Now that its\r\nreputation is fully established, it is likely to be many years before\r\nit becomes relatively low in price, as the foreign apples of this kind\r\ncannot compare in flavour with those grown in our own orchards. I\r\nappreciate the man whose attention was wholly given to some\r\nparticularly dainty dish, and, being bored at the table by a\r\npersistent talker, gently said, \"Hush! and let me _listen_ to the\r\nflavour.\"\r\n\r\nAs an early market apple there is none more popular than the Worcester\r\nPearmain, first grown in the early eighties by Messrs. R. Smith and\r\nCo., of Worcester, and said to be a cross between King of the Pippins\r\nand the old Quarrenden (nearly always called Quarantine). It is a most\r\nattractive fruit--brilliant in colour, medium size, with pleasant\r\nbrisk flavour--and is an early and regular bearer. I recognized its\r\npossibilities as soon as I saw it, and getting all the grafts I could\r\ncollect, and they were very scarce at the time, I had the branches of\r\nsome of my old worthless trees cut off, and set my old grafter to\r\nconvert them into Worcester Pearmains; they soon came into bearing and\r\nproduced abundant and profitable crops.\r\n\r\nThis apple is not much use for keeping beyond a month or so, as it\r\nsoon loses its crisp texture and distinctive flavour, and it is its\r\nearliness and colour that makes it so popular in its season. Its\r\nregularity as a bearer is due to its early maturity; it can be picked\r\nin August, which allows plenty of time, in favourable weather, for\r\nnext year's fruit buds to develop before winter; whereas with the late\r\nsorts these buds have very little chance to mature while the current\r\nyear's fruit is ripening, with the result that a blank season nearly\r\nalways follows an abundant yield. The Worcester Pearmain is so highly\r\ndecorative, with its large pale pink and white blossoms in spring and\r\nits glowing red fruit in autumn, that it would be worth growing for\r\nthese qualities alone in the amateur's garden, and in any case it is\r\nan apple that nobody should be without.\r\n\r\nAn old apple, not sufficiently known, is the Rosemary Russet; it has\r\nthe distinctive russet-bronze colouring, always indicative of flavour,\r\nwith a rosy flush on the sunny side, and Dr. Hogg describes it further\r\nas, \"flesh yellow, crisp, tender, very juicy, sugary and highly\r\naromatic--a first-rate dessert apple, in use from December to\r\nFebruary.\" In my opinion it comes next, though _longo intervallo_, to\r\nCox's Orange Pippin, but it wants good land to make the best of it. It\r\nmay with confidence be produced as a rarity across the walnuts and the\r\nwine to the connossieur in apples.\r\n\r\nIn Covent Garden Market King Pippins are known as \"Kings\"; Cox's\r\nOrange Pippins as \"C.O.P.'s\"; Cellinis as \"Selinas\"; Kerry pippins as\r\n\"Careys\"; _Court pendu plat_ as \"Corpendus\"; and the pear, _Joséphine\r\nde Malines_ as \"Joseph on the palings\"! The Wellington is sold as\r\n\"Wellington,\" but in the markets of the large northern towns it is\r\nknown as \"Normanton Wonder.\"\r\n\r\nIn Worcestershire St. Swithin's Day, July 15, is called\r\n\"apple-christening day,\" when a good rain often gives a great impetus\r\nto their growth, and a little later great quantities of small apples\r\nmay be seen under the trees; this is Nature's method of limiting the\r\ncrop to reasonable proportions, the weak ones falling off and the\r\nfittest surviving. The inexperienced grower may be somewhat alarmed by\r\nthis apparent destruction of his prospects, but the older hand knows\r\nbetter, and my bailiff always said: \"When I sees plenty of apples\r\nunder the trees about midsummer, I knows there'll be plenty to pick\r\ntowards Michaelmas.\"\r\n\r\nThe Blenheim Orange was the leading apple at Aldington; some kind\r\nperson had, sixty or seventy years before my time, planted a number of\r\ntrees which had thrived wonderfully on that rich land. The Blenheim is\r\na nice dessert apple and a splendid \"cooker\"; the trees take many\r\nyears to come into bearing, and then they make up for lost time.\r\nNature is never in a hurry to produce her best results. As a market\r\napple the Blenheim has a great reputation; if an Evesham fruit dealer\r\nwas asked if he could do with any apples, his first question was\r\nalways: \"Be 'em Blemmins?\"\r\n\r\n\"September blow soft till the fruit's in the loft,\" is the prayer of\r\nall apple growers; it is pitiful to see, after a roaring gale, the\r\nground strewn with beautiful fruit, bruised and broken, useless to\r\nkeep, and only suitable for carting away to the all-devouring\r\ncider-mill, though, even for that purpose, the sweet Blenheim does not\r\nproduce nearly so good a drink as sourer accredited cider varieties.\r\n\r\nMany of the gardening papers will name apples if sent by readers for\r\nidentification; I was told of an enquirer who sent twelve apples from\r\nthe same tree, and received eleven different names and one \"unknown\"!\r\nApples off the same tree do differ wonderfully, but I can scarcely\r\ncredit this story.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom formerly at Aldington to sell the fruit on the trees\r\nby auction for the buyer to pick and market, growers as a rule being\r\ntoo busy with corn-harvest to attend to the gathering. A considerable\r\nsum was thereby often sacrificed, as the buyer allows an ample margin\r\nfor risks, and is not willing to give more than about half of what he\r\nexpects to receive ultimately. I discontinued the auction sales early\r\nin my farming, preferring to take the risks myself, and having plenty\r\nof labour available. It is instructive too to know how individual\r\ntrees are bearing, and the sorts which produce the best returns.\r\n\r\nExcept for the choicest fruit, I consider London the worst market, and\r\nI could do better, as a rule, by sending my consignments to\r\nManchester, Liverpool, Sheffield, and Glasgow; the latter especially\r\nfor large coarse stuff. London is more critical, pays well for the\r\nvery best, but requires apples to be carefully graded, and the grades\r\nseparately packed; London is, moreover, naturally well supplied by the\r\nsouthern counties.\r\n\r\nAt the auctions the competition was generally keen, there being much\r\nrivalry between the buyers; and it was good for the sellers when\r\npolitical parties were opposed to each other, for in those days\r\nEvesham was inclined to be rather violent in such matters. I remember\r\na lively contest between Conservatives and Radicals, when my largest\r\norchard--about six acres--was sold to the champion of the former for\r\n£210, and the Radical exclaimed, as the lot was knocked down, for\r\neverybody to hear: \"He offered me £10 before the sale to stand out,\r\nnow that £10 is in Mr. S.'s pocket!\"\r\n\r\nA few strong gales in the winter are supposed to benefit apple-trees,\r\nacting as a kind of root pruning; but sometimes, when they are getting\r\nold, they come down bodily with a crash, partly uprooted, though even\r\nthen they may be resuscitated for a time. We had a powerful set of\r\npulley tackle by which, when made fast to a neighbouring tree, they\r\ncould be restored to the perpendicular, after enlarging the hole left\r\nby the roots, making the ground firm again round the tree, and placing\r\na strong sloping prop to take the weight on the weak side; good yields\r\nwould then often continue for some years.\r\n\r\nWhen the pickers had gathered the crop, by an ancient custom all the\r\nvillage children were allowed to invade the orchards for the purpose\r\nof getting for themselves any apples overlooked. This practice is\r\ncalled \"scragging,\" but it is a custom that would perhaps be better\r\nhonoured in the breach than in the observance, for hob nails do not\r\nagree with the tender bark of young trees. Like gleaning, or\r\n\"leasing,\" as it is called, it is nevertheless a pleasant old custom,\r\nand seems to give the children huge delight.\r\n\r\nMistletoe did not find my apple-trees congenial, there was only one\r\npiece on all my fruit land, and it was regarded as something of a\r\ncuriosity. But in other parts of the neighbourhood it flourished\r\nabundantly, though I noticed that it was most frequent where the land\r\nwas poorer and the trees not so luxuriant. It was also to be seen on\r\ntall black poplars, and I have a piece--planted purposely--on a\r\nhawthorn in my garden here. It grows in parts of the Forest,\r\nespecially on the white-beams in Sloden, in curiously small detached\r\npieces like lichen. The white-beam was a favourite tree of the Romans\r\nfor the wood-work of agricultural implements, being tough and strong.\r\n\r\nMistletoe is quite easy to propagate by rubbing the glutinous berries\r\nand their seeds on the under side of a small branch at the angle where\r\nit joins a limb. There it will often flourish unless snapped up by a\r\nwandering missel-thrush. It is very slow in growth, but, when it\r\nattains a fair size, is strikingly pretty in winter when the tree is\r\notherwise bare, for its peculiar shade of faded green, with its white\r\nand glistening berries, makes an unusual effect--quite different from\r\nthat of any other green thing. It is rare on the oak, and, possibly\r\nfor that reason, the Druids regarded the oak upon which it grew as\r\nsacred.\r\n\r\nThe transition from apples to cider is a natural one, and cider is a\r\ngreat institution in Worcestershire. On all the larger farms, and in\r\nevery village, an ancient cider-mill can be found. It consists of a\r\ncircular block of masonry, perhaps ten feet in diameter, the outer\r\ncircumference of which is a continuous stone trough, about 18 inches\r\nacross, and 15 inches deep, called \"the chase,\" in which a huge\r\ngrindstone, weighing about 15 cwt., revolves slowly, actuated by a\r\nhorse walking round the chase in an unending circle. The apples are\r\nintroduced in small quantities into the chase, and crushed into pulp\r\nby the grindstone. The pulp is then removed and placed between hair\r\ncloths, piled upon each other, until a stack is erected beneath a\r\npowerful press, worked by a lever, on the principle of a capstan. As\r\nthe pressure increases, the liquor runs into a vessel below, from\r\nwhence it is carried in buckets, and poured into barrels in the\r\ncellar. Fermentation begins almost immediately, by which the sugar is\r\nconverted in carbonic acid gas and alcohol; the gas escapes and the\r\nspirit remains in the liquor.\r\n\r\nSuch is the simplest method of cider-making, and it produces a drink\r\nthoroughly appreciated by the men, for we made annually 1,500 to 2,000\r\ngallons, and there was very little left when next year's cider-making\r\nbegan. Where cider is made for sale, much greater care is necessary;\r\nonly the soundest fruit is used, and the vinous fermentation is\r\nallowed to begin in open vessels before the pulp is pressed. When the\r\nextracted liquor is placed in the barrels every effort is made to\r\nprevent the acetic fermentation, which produces vinegar, and spoils\r\nthe cider for discriminating palates. The stone mill has been\r\nsuperseded to some extent by the steam \"scratter\"; but the cider is\r\nnot considered so good, as the kernels are left uncrushed, an\r\nimportant omission, as they add largely to the flavour of the finished\r\nproduct. After a hot dry summer, cider is unusually strong, because\r\nthe sugar in the apples is much more fully developed. It is recognized\r\nthat these hot summers produce what are known as vintage years for\r\ncider, just as, on the Continent, they produce vintage wines.\r\n\r\nJarge, of whom I have written, was the presiding genius in the\r\ncider-mill, and his duties began as soon as hop-picking was over. All\r\ntraces of the downward inclination of the corners of his mouth, caused\r\nby the delinquencies of recalcitrant hoppers, quite disappeared as\r\nsoon as his new duties commenced, and it was a pleasure to see his\r\njovial face beaming over a job which seemed to have no drawbacks. A\r\nreally Bacchanalian presence is the only one that should be tolerated\r\nin a cider-maker; the lean and hungry character is quite out of place\r\namidst the fragrance of the crushed apples, and the generous liquor\r\nrunning from the press.\r\n\r\nThe cider-maker is always allowed a liberal quantity of last year's\r\nproduce, on the principle of \"thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he\r\ntreadeth out the corn\"--a principle that should always be recognized\r\nin the labourer's hire, and one which is too often forgotten by the\r\npublic in its estimate of the necessities of the farmer himself. It is\r\nusual for the man in possession, so to speak, of the cider-mill, to\r\nmix, for his own consumption, some of the new unfermented liquor with\r\nthe old cider, which, after twelve months, is apt to be excessively\r\nsour; but the quantity of the former must not be in too large a\r\nproportion, as it has a powerful medicinal effect.\r\n\r\n     \"Wouldst thou thy vats with generous juice should froth?\r\n     Respect thy orchats: think not that the trees\r\n     Spontaneous will produce a wholesome draught,\r\n     Let art correct thy breed.\"\r\n\r\nSo sang Philips in his _Cyder_ in the distant days of 1706, but the\r\nadvice is as sound as ever, for good cider can only be produced from\r\nthe right kinds of apples. The names of new sorts are legion, but some\r\nof the old varieties are still considered to be very valuable. Among\r\nthese, the Foxwhelp has been a favourite for 200 years, and others in\r\ngreat esteem are Skyrme's Kernal, Forest Styre, Hagloe Crab, Dymock\r\nRed, Bromley, Cowarne Red, and Styre Wilding. It requires about twenty\r\n\"pots\" (a local measure each weighing 64 pounds) to make a hogshead of\r\ncider; a hogshead is roughly 100 gallons, and in Worcestershire is\r\nhardly recognizable under the name of \"oxsheard\"--I have never seen\r\nthe word in print, but the local pronunciation is faithfully\r\nrepresented by my spelling. Another local appellation which puzzled me\r\nfor some years was \"crab varges,\" which I eventually discovered to\r\nmean \"verjuice,\" a terribly sour liquid, made in the same way as cider\r\nfrom crab apples. It was considered a wonderfully stimulating specific\r\nfor sprains and strains, holding the same pre-eminent position as an\r\nembrocation, as did \"goose-grace\" (goose-grease) as an ointment or\r\nemollient. This substance is the melted fat of a goose, and was said\r\nto be so powerful that, if applied to the back of the hand, it could\r\nshortly be recognized on the palm!\r\n\r\nThe value of alcohol as a food is generally denied in these days by\r\nsedentary people, but very few who have seen its judicious use in\r\nagricultural work will be inclined to agree; it is possible that\r\nthough it may be a carbo-hydrate very quickly consumed in the body, it\r\nacts as an aid to digestion, and produces more nourishment from a\r\ngiven quantity of food, than would be assimilated in its absence. The\r\ngiving out of the men's allowances is, however, a troublesome matter\r\nand demands a firm and masterful bailiff or foreman, for \"much\" is\r\ninclined to want \"more,\" and the line should, of course, be drawn far\r\nshort of excess. It was related of an old lady farmer in the\r\nneighbourhood, who always distributed her men's cider with her own\r\nhands, that in her anxiety to be on the safe side after a season when\r\nthe cider was unusually strong, she mixed a proportion of water with\r\nthe beverage, before the arrival of the recipients. One of the men,\r\nhowever, having discovered the dilution, arrived after the first day\r\nwith two jars. Asked the reason for the second jar, he answered that\r\nhe should prefer to have his cider and the water _separate_.\r\n\r\nMy bailiff always said that sixpennyworth of cider would do more work\r\nthan a shilling in cash. He was undoubtedly correct, and, moreover,\r\nthe quantity worth sixpence in the farm cider store would cost a\r\nshilling or more at the public-house, to supply an equivalent in\r\nalcohol, and valuable time would be lost in fetching it. It is the\r\nalcohol that commends it to the agricultural labourer more than any\r\nconsideration of thirst, and no one can see its effect without the\r\nconviction that the men find it not only stimulating, but supporting.\r\nA friend of mine, however, found so much satisfaction in a deep\r\ndraught of cider when he felt really \"dry,\" that he said he would give\r\n\"a crown\" any day for a \"good thirst!\"\r\n\r\nExcess in drink was rare at Aldington, and it was very exceptional for\r\na man to be seen in what were called his \"crooked stockings.\"\r\nFortunately, we had no public-house in the village, and if the men had\r\na moderate allowance during a hard day's work, there was not much\r\ntemptation to tramp a mile and back at night to the nearest licensed\r\npremises in order to sit and swill in the tap-room. I had one man who\r\nlived near a place of the sort, and he occasionally took what my\r\nbailiff called, \"Saints' days,\" and did not appear for work. I notice\r\nthat this sort of day is now called by the more suitable name of\r\n\"alcoholiday.\"\r\n\r\nWell-fermented cider contains from 5 to 10 gallons of alcohol, and\r\nperry about 7 gallons, to every 100 gallons of the liquor, which\r\ncompares with claret 13 to 17, sherry 15 to 20, and port 24 to 26 per\r\ncent, of alcohol. I found the truth of the proverb _in vino veritas_;\r\nafter a quite small allowance of cider on the farm the open-hearted\r\nman would become lively, the reserved man taciturn, the crabbed man\r\nargumentative; but the work went with a will and a spirit that were\r\nnot so noticeable when no \"tots\" were going round.\r\n\r\nAn old gentleman in the neighbourhood used to tell with much enjoyment\r\nthe following story of his younger days. \"I found myself,\" he said,\r\n\"gradually increasing my allowance of whisky and water, as I sat alone\r\nof an evening, and I said to myself: 'Now look here, H.W., you began\r\nwith one glass, very soon you got on to two, and now you're taking\r\nthree. I'll tell you what it is, H.W., you shan't have another drop of\r\nwhisky for a month';\" \"and,\" he added, \"H.W. did it, too!\"\r\n\r\nShortly before I came to Aldington the men were suddenly seized with\r\nwhat seemed an unaccountable epidemic; their symptoms were all\r\nsimilar, and a doctor soon diagnosed the complaint as lead-poisoning.\r\nNobody could suggest its origin until the cider was suspected, and, on\r\nenquiry, it was elicited that the previous year the stones of the\r\ncider-mill chase, which had become loosened by long use, were repaired\r\nwith melted lead poured in between the joints. The malic acid of the\r\napples had dissolved the lead, and it remained in solution in the\r\ncider. To the disgust of the men, the doctor advised removing the\r\nbungs from the barrels and letting the cider run off into the drains,\r\nbut nobody had the heart to comply, for there was the whole year's\r\nstock, and it meant a wait of twelve months before it could be\r\nreplaced. After some months the men got impatient, and told the master\r\nthey were prepared to take the risk. They began with great caution,\r\nand finding no bad result, they gradually increased the dose, still\r\nwithout harm, until the normal allowance was safely reached. It is\r\nprobable that the barrel which caused the symptoms was the first made\r\nafter the repairs, and contained an extra quantity of the lead, and\r\nalthough the remainder was more or less contaminated, the poison was\r\nin such small amount as to be harmless.\r\n\r\nThere were many old apple-trees about the hedges and in odd corners,\r\nwhich went by the name of \"the roundabouts,\" and the fruit was\r\nannually collected and brought to the cider-mill. Some of these were\r\nimmense trees, and not very desirable round arable land, owing to\r\ntheir shade, but they were lovely when in bloom, for standing\r\nseparately, they seemed to develop richer colours than when close\r\ntogether in an orchard.\r\n\r\nThe story of Shakespeare's carouse, and his night passed under a\r\ncrab-tree near Bidford, about six miles from Aldington, is well known.\r\nIt is stated, but not without contradiction, that he excused himself\r\nby explaining that he had been drinking with:\r\n\r\n     Piping Pebworth, dancing Marston,\r\n     Haunted Hillborough, hungry Grafton,\r\n     Dudging Exhall, papist Wixford,\r\n     Beggarly Broom, and drunken Bidford.\r\n\r\nA carousal at all these places would have been a heavy day's work, and\r\nI have often thought that if the lines can really be attributed to\r\nhim, he might have meant that he had met people from all the villages\r\nat one of the Whitsuntide merry-makings annually held in the\r\nneighbourhood, and passed a jovial time in their company.\r\n\r\nPerry is made in much the same way as cider, and when due care has\r\nbeen taken in its manufacture, it is a most delicious and wholesome\r\ndrink. When bottled and kept to mature it pours out with a beautiful\r\ncreaming head, and is far superior to ordinary champagne. Both cider\r\nand perry should be drunk out of a china or earthenware mug, whence\r\nthey taste much richer than from glass; but my men always used in the\r\nfield a small horn cup or \"tot,\" holding about quarter of a pint. I\r\nhave a very interesting old cider cup, of Fulham or Lambeth\r\nearthenware I think, holding about a quart, with three handles, each\r\nof which is a greyhound with body bent to form the loop for the hand.\r\nIt was intended for the use of three persons sitting together at a\r\nsmall three-cornered oak table, specimens of which are still, though\r\nrarely, met with at furniture sales in farm-houses or cottages; the\r\ncup was placed in the middle, and each person could take a pull by\r\nusing his particular handle with the adjacent place for his lips,\r\nwithout passing the cup round or using the same drinking space as\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous kinds of perry pears, but certain sorts have a\r\ngreat reputation, such as Moorcroft, Barland, Malvern Hills, Longdon,\r\nRed Horse, Mother Huff Cap, and Chate Boy (cheat boy), a particularly\r\nastringent pear; these are all small, and require quickly grinding\r\nwhen gathered. In the New Forest there is a perry pear similar to the\r\nChate Boy, called Choke Dog, which in its natural state, is quite as\r\nrough on the palate as the former, but it differs in colour and is not\r\nthe same sort. I had a splendid specimen of the Chate Boy pear-tree at\r\nan outlying set of buildings, said to be the father of all the trees\r\nof that kind in the neighbourhood, and it was a landmark for miles, as\r\nit stood on high ground. It was fitted with a ladder reaching to the\r\nmiddle of the tree, where seats were arranged on a platform for eight\r\nor nine people; but it was unfortunately blown down on the night of\r\nthe great gale of October 14, 1877, when twelve other trees on the\r\nfarm were likewise overthrown.\r\n\r\nCider and perry drinkers were said to be more or less immune from many\r\nhuman ailments, including rheumatic affections, though one would\r\nexpect the acetic acid they contain, unless very carefully made, would\r\nhave an opposite effect. Certainly my men suffered neither from gout\r\nnor rheumatism, and there was a tradition that in 1832, when the\r\ncholera was rife in the country, the plague was stayed as soon as the\r\ncider districts were approached.\r\n\r\nThese noble old pear-trees are a great feature of the Vale of Evesham,\r\nespecially in the more calcareous parts where the lias limestone is\r\nnot far from the surface; they are exquisite in spring in clouds of\r\npure white blossoms long before the apples are in bloom; in the autumn\r\nthe foliage presents every tint of crimson, green and gold all softly\r\nsubdued, and in winter, when the framework of the tree can be seen, it\r\nis noticeable how far the massive limbs extend, carrying their girth\r\nalmost to the summit, in a way that not even the oak can excel. The\r\ntimber is short in the grain, and wears smooth in the long wood\r\nploughs, and is very suitable for carving quite small and elaborate\r\npatterns for such articles as picture frames; but it is somewhat\r\nliable to the attack of the woodworm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLUMS--CHERRIES.\r\n\r\n     \"A right down hearty one he be as'll make some of our maids look\r\n       alive.\r\n     And the worst time of year for such work too, when the May-Dukes\r\n       is in,\r\n     and the Hearts a-colouring!\"\r\n                                 --Crusty John in _Alice Lorraine_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vale of Evesham has the credit of being the birthplace of two most\r\nvaluable plums--the Damascene, and the Pershore, or Egg plum. These\r\nboth grow on their own stocks, so require no grafting, and can readily\r\nbe propagated by severing the suckers which spring up around them from\r\nthe roots of the tree. The Damascene, as its name implies, is a\r\nspecies of Damson, but coarser than the real Damson or the Prune\r\nDamson. They are not so popular on the London market as in the markets\r\nof the north, especially in Manchester, where they command prices\r\nlittle inferior to the better sorts, as they yield a brilliant red dye\r\nsuitable for dying printed cotton goods. When really ripe they are\r\nexcellent for cooking, and are not to be despised, even raw, on a\r\nthirsty autumn day. In years of scarcity these have fetched 30s. and\r\nover per \"pot\" of 72 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe Pershore is a very different plum, green when unripe, and\r\nattaining a golden colour later; they are immense bearers and very\r\nhardy, frequently saving the situation for the plum-growers when all\r\nother kinds are destroyed by spring frosts. They are specially\r\nvaluable for bottling, and it is rumoured that in the hands of skilful\r\nmanufacturers they become \"apricots\" under certain conditions. As\r\n\"cookers,\" too, they are perhaps the most useful of plums, for they\r\ncan be used in a very green and hard state. It is a wonderful sight to\r\nsee them being despatched by tram at the Evesham stations, loaded\r\nsometimes loose like coals in the trucks for the big preserving firms\r\nin the north. The trees grow very irregularly and are difficult to\r\nkeep in shape by pruning, as they send forth suckers from all parts\r\nwhen an attempt is made to keep them symmetrical. The only purpose for\r\nwhich the fruit is of little use is for eating raw, they are not\r\nunpleasant when just ripe, but that stage is soon passed and they\r\nbecome woody and unpalatable.\r\n\r\nI planted a thousand of these trees in a new orchard, and took great\r\npains with the pruning myself, for it was curious that in that land of\r\nfruit at the time no professional pruner could be found. I sought the\r\nadvice of a market-gardener and plum-grower, who, in the early stage\r\nof their growth, gave me an object-lesson, cutting back the young\r\nshoots rather hard to induce them to throw out more at the point of\r\nincision, so as to produce eventually a fuller head; while he\r\nreiterated the instruction, \"It is no use being afraid of 'em.\"\r\n\r\nThis young orchard adjoined the Great Western Railway, and one day\r\nwhen pruning there I saw a remarkable sight, and I have never found\r\nany one with a similar experience. The telegraph wires were magnified\r\ninto stout ropes by a coating of white rime, and I could see a\r\ndistinct series of waves approximating to the dots and dashes of the\r\nMorse code running along them. The movement would run for a time up\r\ntowards London, cease for a moment, and then run downwards towards\r\nEvesham, and so on almost continuously. I thought it might be caused\r\nby the passage of electricity, but I cannot get a satisfactory\r\nexplanation. No trains were passing, there was no wind, the rime was\r\nnot thawing or falling off, and apparently there was nothing to\r\nagitate either poles or wires.\r\n\r\nThis orchard was not a lucky one; it was too low, having only one flat\r\nmeadow between it and the brook, and therefore very liable to spring\r\nfrosts. I have seen the trees well past the blossoming stage, with\r\nyoung plums as large as peas, which after two nights' sharp frost\r\nturned black and fell off to such an extent that there was scarcely a\r\nplum left; but I had a few very good crops which gave employment to a\r\nnumber of additional hands besides my regular people.\r\n\r\nA season came when the plum-trees in my new orchard were badly\r\nattacked by the caterpillars of the winter-moth, but the cuckoos soon\r\nfound them out, and I could see half a dozen at once enjoying a\r\nbountiful feast. When better plums are abundant the Pershore falls to\r\nvery low prices; I have sold quantities at 1s. or 1s. 3d. per pot of\r\n72 pounds, at which of course there was a loss; but it is needless to\r\nsay that at such times the consumer never gets the benefit, 2d. a\r\npound being about the lowest figure at which they are ever seen on\r\noffer in the shops.\r\n\r\nThe Victoria is a very superior plum to the Pershore, and a local plum\r\ncalled Jimmy Moore is also a favourite. I believe this plum is very\r\nsimilar to, if not identical with, one sold as Emperor; both it and\r\nthe Victoria nearly always made good prices and bore well. The\r\nVictoria, especially, was so prolific that in some seasons, if not\r\ncarefully propped, every branch would be broken off by, the weight of\r\nfruit, and the tree left a wreck. Not discouraged, however, it would\r\nshoot out again and in a few years bear as well as ever.\r\n\r\nMy best plum was the greengage, rather a shy bearer but always in\r\ndemand. Living in a land of Goshen, like the Vale of Evesham, one gets\r\nquite hypercritical (or \"picksome,\" as the local expression is), and\r\nscarcely cares to taste a fruit from a tree in passing; but I used to\r\nvisit my greengages at times when the pickers had done with them, for\r\nthey have to be gathered somewhat unripe to ensure travelling\r\nundamaged. I often found, on the south side of the tree, a few that\r\nhad been overlooked which were fully ripe, beautifully mottled, full\r\nof sunshine, and perfect in melting texture and ambrosial flavour.\r\n\r\nFor restocking old worn-out apple orchards, in Worcestershire at any\r\nrate, there is nothing to equal plum-trees; they flourished amazingly\r\nat Aldington, and soon made up for the lost apples; they appeared to\r\nfollow the principle that dictates the rotation of ordinary crops,\r\njust as the leguminous plants alternate satisfactorily with the\r\ngraminaceous, or, as I have read that in Norway, where a fir forest\r\nhas been cut, birch will spring up automatically and take its place.\r\n\r\nMy predecessor always sold his plums on the trees for the buyer to\r\nharvest, and I heard that when the former turned a flock of Dorset\r\newes into one of these orchards, the buyer complained--the lower\r\nbranches being heavily laden, and within a few feet of the\r\nground--that he had watched, \"Them old yows holding down bunches of\r\nplums with their harns for t'others to eat.\" This I imagine was in the\r\nnature of hyperbole, and not intended to be taken literally.\r\n\r\nI had about forty cherry trees in one of my orchards, and among them a\r\nvery early kind of black cherry, as well as Black Bigarreaus, White\r\nHeart and Elton Heart. The early ones made particularly good prices,\r\nbut when the French cherries began to be imported, being on the market\r\na week or two before ours they \"took the keen edge off the demand,\"\r\nthough wretched-looking things in comparison. The cherries from my\r\nforty trees made £80 one year when the crop was good, but they are\r\nexpensive to pick as there is much shifting of heavy ladders, and the\r\nwork was done by men. In Kent, I believe, women are employed at\r\ncherry-picking, ascending forty-round ladders in a gale of wind\r\nwithout a sign of nervousness, but with a man in attendance to pack\r\nthe fruit and shift the ladders when required. I found Liverpool the\r\nbest market for cherries, where they were bought by the large\r\nsteamship companies for the Transatlantic liners, and where they were\r\nin demand for the seaside and holiday places in North Wales and\r\nLancashire. Like the pear-trees, the cherry-trees are very beautiful\r\nin spring, and again in autumn, and as mine could be seen from the\r\nhouse and garden, they added a great charm to the place.\r\n\r\nI must put in a word here for the bullfinch, which is unreasonably\r\npersecuted for its supposed destruction of the cherry crop when in\r\nbloom; it undoubtedly picks many blossoms to pieces, but probably no\r\nultimate loss of weight follows; very few comparatively of the blooms\r\never become fruits in any case, and even if some are thus nipped in\r\nthe bud, it is probable that the remainder mature into larger and\r\nfiner cherries in consequence. The advantage of thinning is recognized\r\nin the case of all our fruits, and is indeed, the reason for pruning.\r\nThe vine-grower knows well the truth of the saying that, \"You should\r\nget your enemy to thin your grapes,\" and I would sacrifice many\r\ncherries for a few of these beautiful birds in my garden, for man does\r\nnot live by bread alone.\r\n\r\nOne of the old couplets, of which our forefathers were so fond, runs:\r\n\r\n     \"A cherry year is a merry year,\r\n     And a plum year is a dumb year.\"\r\n\r\nI have seen the explanation suggested that cherries being particularly\r\nwholesome contributed to the happiness of mankind, but that the less\r\nsalubrious plum tended to depression of health and spirits. There is,\r\nhowever, a small black cherry still grown in this and other parts of\r\nHampshire and Surrey called the \"Merry,\" from the French _merise_, and\r\nit was natural that when cherries were abundant the merry would also\r\nbe plentiful. The word \"dumb\" is an archaic synonym for \"damson,\" and\r\nthe same rule would apply between it and the plum, as with the cherry\r\nand the merry. My own small place here, in the New Forest, has been\r\nknown for centuries as \"the Merry Gardens,\" and no doubt they were\r\nonce grown here, as at other places in the south of England, called\r\nMerry Hills, Merry Fields, and Merry Orchards. Even now as I write, on\r\nMay Day, the buds on the wild cherries in my hedges are showing the\r\nwhite bloom just ready to appear, and in a few days, these trees will\r\nbe spangled with their little bright stars. I imagine that they are no\r\nvery distant relation of the old merry-trees that once flourished\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREES: ELM--OAK--BEECH--WILLOW--SCOTS-FIR.\r\n\r\n     \"O flourish, hidden deep in fern,\r\n     Old oak, I love thee well;\r\n     A thousand thanks for what I learn\r\n     And what remains to tell.\"\r\n                               --_The Talking Oak_.\r\n\r\nKeats tells us that\r\n\r\n                          \"The trees\r\n     That whisper round a temple become soon\r\n     Dear as the temple's self,\"\r\n\r\nand had he included the trees around a dwelling-house, the epigram\r\nwould have been equally applicable. Sometimes, of course, it becomes\r\nabsolutely necessary to cut down an ancient tree that from its\r\nproximity to one's home has become a part of the home itself, but it\r\nis a matter for the gravest consideration, for one cannot foresee the\r\nresult, and to a person who has lived long with a noble tree as a near\r\nneighbour, the place never again seems the same.\r\n\r\nThe Elm is said to be the Worcestershire weed, as the oak is in\r\nHerefordshire; the former attains a great size, but it is not very\r\ndeeply rooted, and a heavy gale will sometimes cause many unwelcome\r\ngaps in a stately avenue. Big branches, too, have a way of falling\r\nwithout the least notice, and on the whole it is safer not to have\r\nelms near houses or cottages. One of the finest avenues of elms I\r\nknow, is to be seen at the Palace of the Bishop of Winchester at\r\nFarnham in Surrey, but the land is quite exceptionally good, and in\r\nthe palmy days of hop-growing, the adjoining fields commanded a rent\r\nof £20 an acre for what is known as the \"Heart land of Farnham,\" where\r\nhops of the most superlative quality were grown. When the dappled deer\r\nare grouped under this noble avenue, in the light and shade beneath\r\nthe elms, they form an old English picture of country life not to be\r\nsurpassed.\r\n\r\nThe elm is a sure sign of rich land, it is never seen on thin poor\r\nsoils. An intending purchaser, or tenant, of a farm should always\r\nregard its presence as a certain indication of a likely venture. It is\r\na terrible robber, and therefore a nuisance round arable land, causing\r\na spreading shade, under which the corn will be found thin,\r\n\"scrawley,\" and \"broken-kneed,\" with poor, shrivelled ears; and the\r\nalternating green crops will also suffer in their way. In an orchard\r\nit is still worse; I had several at one time surrounded by Blenheim\r\napples, which were always small, scanty, and colourless. Eventually, I\r\ncut the elms down, the biggest, carrying perhaps 100 cubic feet of\r\ntimber at 9d. a foot at the time, was only worth 75s., though it must\r\nhave destroyed scores of pounds worth of fruit during its many years\r\nof growth. The elm seems particularly liable to be struck by\r\nlightning, possibly owing to its height, and several suffered in this\r\nway during my time at Aldington.\r\n\r\nFrom the scarcity of oak in the Vale of Evesham elm was often used for\r\nmaking the coffers or chests we generally see made from the former\r\nwood. I have one of these, nicely carved with the scrolls and bold\r\ndevices of the Jacobean period, and it is so dark in colour as to pass\r\nat first sight for old oak. The timber is not much used in building,\r\nexcept for rough farm sheds; as boards it is liable to twist and\r\nbecome what is called \"cross-winding.\" The land in the New Forest is\r\nmostly too poor for the elm, and this should warn the theorists, who\r\nduring the war have advocated reclaiming the open heaths and moors for\r\nagricultural purposes, against such an ignorant proposition. I suppose\r\nit would cost at least £100 an acre to clear, drain, fence, level,\r\nmake roads, and erect the necessary farm buildings, houses and\r\ncottages, with the result that it would command less than £1 per acre\r\nas annual rent; and I should be sorry to be compelled to farm it at\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nOaks are somewhat scarce in Worcestershire, and are rarely found in\r\nthe Vale of Evesham. I had one remarkably fine specimen in a meadow on\r\nClaybrook, the farm I owned, adjoining the Aldington land. It covered\r\nan area measuring 22 yards by 22 yards = 484 square yards, the tenth\r\npart of an acre. The trunk measured 12 feet in circumference, about 7\r\nfeet from the ground. The rule for estimating the age of growing\r\noak-trees is to calculate 15 years to each inch of radius = 540 years\r\nto a yard, therefore a tree 6 feet in diameter, and about 20 feet\r\nround, including bark and knots, would be just that age. According to\r\nthis rule my tree would be not less than 330 years old, which of\r\ncourse is young for an oak.\r\n\r\nThe life of this oak was saved in a peculiar way by \"a pint of drink,\"\r\nand the story was told me by the agent of an old lady, the previous\r\nowner. It had been decided to fell the tree, and two professional\r\nsawyers, who were also \"tree-fallers\" (fellers), arrived one morning\r\nfor the purpose with their axes and cross-cut saw. They surveyed the\r\nprospect and agreeing that it presented a tough job, an adjournment\r\nwas arranged to the neighbouring \"Royal Oak\" for a pint of drink\r\nbefore commencing operations. Coming back, half an hour later, they\r\nhad just stripped and rolled up their shirt sleeves, when the agent\r\nappeared on the road not far off. \"Hullo,\" he shouted, \"have you made\r\na start?\" \"Just about to begin,\" replied the head man. \"Well then,\r\ndon't,\" said the agent, \"the old lady died last night, and I must wait\r\ntill the new owners have considered the matter.\" So the tree was\r\nsaved, and curiously enough by its namesake the \"Royal Oak.\" The new\r\nowner spared it, and later when it became my property I did likewise,\r\nfor I should have considered it sacrilege to destroy the finest oak in\r\nthe neighbourhood. Some years after I had sold the farm I heard that\r\nthe tree was blown down in a gale, its enormous head and widespread\r\nbranches must have offered immense resistance to the wind, and the\r\nfall of it must have been great.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated, if not the biggest oak in the New Forest is the\r\nKnightwood oak, not far from Lyndhurst; it is 17 feet in\r\ncircumference, which would make it not less than 450 years old by the\r\nabove rule. It is strange to think that it may have been an acorn in\r\nthe year 1469, in the reign of Henry VI., and that 200 years later it\r\ncould easily have peeped over the heads of its neighbours in 1669, to\r\nsee Charles II., who probably went riding along the main Christchurch\r\nroad from Lyndhurst with a team of courtiers and court beauties, in\r\nall the pomp of royalty. We know that in that year with reference to\r\nthe waste of timber in the Forest during his father's reign he was\r\nespecially interested in the planting of young oaks, and enclosed a\r\nnursery of 300 acres for their growth. It is also recorded that he did\r\nnot forget the maids of honour of his court, upon whom he bestowed the\r\nyoung woods of Brockenhurst.\r\n\r\n     \"Oak before ash--only a splash,\r\n     Ash before oak--a regular soak,\"\r\n\r\nis a very ancient proverb referring to the relative times of the\r\nleaves of these trees appearing in the spring, and is supposed to be\r\nprophetic of the weather during the ensuing summer. I have, however,\r\nnoticed for many years that the oak is invariably first, so that like\r\nsome other prognostications, it seems to be unreliable.\r\n\r\nThe attitudes of oak trees are a very interesting study. There is the\r\noak which, bending forwards and stretching out a kindly hand, appears\r\nto offer a hearty welcome; the oak that starts backward in\r\nastonishment at any familiarity advanced by a passing stranger. The\r\noak that assumes an attitude of pride and self-importance; the oak\r\nthat approaches a superior neighbour with an air of humility and\r\nabasement, listening subserviently to his commands. The shrinking oak\r\nin dread of an enemy, and the oak prepared to offer a stout\r\nresistance. The hopeful oak in the prime of life, and the oak that\r\ntotters in desolate and crabbed old age. The oak that enjoys in middle\r\nage the good things of life, with well-fed and rounded symmetry; and\r\nthe oak that suggests decrepitude, with rough exterior, and a\r\nlife-experience of hardship; the sturdy oak, the ambitious oak, the\r\nself-contained oak, and so on, through every phase of character. No\r\nother tree is so human or so expressive, and no other tree bespeaks\r\nsuch fortitude and endurance. To say that a well-grown oak typifies\r\nthe reserve and strength of the true-born Briton, is perhaps to sum up\r\nits individuality in a word.\r\n\r\nThere is one old fellow who throws back his head and roars with\r\nlaughter when I go by; what can be the joke? I must stop some day and\r\nlook to see if the sides of his rather tight jacket of Lincoln green\r\nmoss are really splitting, and perhaps, if I can catch the pitch of\r\nhis voice, I shall hear him whisper:\r\n\r\n     \"A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest.\"\r\n\r\nI like to think that these old personalities are transmigrations, and\r\nthat each is now at leisure to correct some special mistake in a\r\nprevious existence. Perhaps, out there in the moonlight, they tell\r\ntheir stories to each other, and to the owls I hear at midnight\r\nperforming an appropriately weird overture.\r\n\r\nThese talking oaks can only be found where they have grown from acorns\r\nnaturally, and where they have survived the struggle of life against\r\ntheir enemies, including the interference of man, the attacks of\r\ngrazing animals, the blasts of winter and the heavy burden of its\r\nsnows. The natural woods, as distinct from the plantations of the New\r\nForest, offer many examples of these varying trees and the lessons\r\nthey convey. Such a piece of old natural forest almost surrounds my\r\npresent home, and every time I pass through it I bless the memory of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror. Randolph Caldecott, that prince of illustrators\r\nof rural life, evidently noticed the characteristic attitudes of\r\ntrees; look at the sympathetic dejection displayed by the two old\r\npollard willows in his sketch of the maiden all forlorn, in _The House\r\nthat Jack Built_. The maiden has her handkerchief to her eyes, and in\r\na few masterly strokes one of the trees is depicted with a falling\r\ntear, and the other bent double is hobbling along with a crutch\r\nsupporting its withered and tottering frame.\r\n\r\nFar otherwise is it with the plantations where the oaks are\r\nartificially cultivated for timber. These are planted close together\r\non purpose to draw each other upwards in the struggle for air and\r\nsunlight, which prevents their branching so near the ground as the\r\nnatural trees, the object being to produce an extended length of\r\nstraight trunk that will eventually afford a long and regular cut of\r\ntimber, free from the knots caused by the branches. All round the\r\nplantations Scots-firs are planted as \"nurses,\" to keep off the rough\r\nwinds and prevent breakage; these also help to lengthen the trunks by\r\ninducing upward development. As the trees get nearer together they are\r\nrepeatedly thinned out, and, eventually, only those left which are\r\nintended to come to maturity. Under this artificial, though necessary\r\nsystem, the trees lose all individuality, and they never regain it\r\nbecause they are all more or less controlled when growing, and so\r\nbecome uninteresting copies of each other.\r\n\r\nThe motto of the natural oak is _festina lente_, mindful of the\r\nproverb, \"early maturity means early decay.\" It is well known that\r\noak, slowly and naturally grown on poor soil, is far more durable than\r\nthat which is run up artificially or produced on rich land. The\r\nbranches of oaks rarely cross or damage each other by friction, like\r\nthose of the beech, they are obstinate and will sooner break in a\r\ngale, than give way. Where an oak and a beech grow side by side, close\r\ntogether, the oak suffers more than the beech, from the dense shade of\r\nthe latter; and if they are so near as to touch and rub together in\r\nthe wind, the oak will throw out a plaster or protection of bark, to\r\nact as a styptic to the wound in the first place, and eventually as a\r\nsolid barrier against further aggression.\r\n\r\nPaintings of landscape in which trees occur are rarely satisfactory;\r\nif you look at children playing beneath timber trees, or passers-by,\r\nthe first thing that strikes you is the majesty and the height of the\r\ntree, as compared with the human figure. In paintings this is not as a\r\nrule expressed; the trees are too insignificant, and the figures too\r\nimportant, so that the range and wealth of tree-life is lost.\r\nGainsborough's _Market Cart_ is a notable exception, but the cart is a\r\nclumsy affair, and the shafts are much too low both on it and the\r\nhorse. Constable's _Valley Farm_, _The Haywain_, _The Cornfield_, and\r\n_Dedham Mill_ are all striking examples of his sense of tree\r\nproportion, lending no little to the nobility of his pictures, and\r\nspeaking eloquently of the reverence man should feel in the presence\r\nof Nature, untainted by his own fancied importance.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as \"heart of oak\" in Worcestershire is called\r\n\"spine-oak\" in the New Forest, and the latter is perhaps the better\r\nname of the two as expressive of greater durability. The outer part of\r\nthe trunk is called \"the sap,\" and whilst the heart or spine is almost\r\nindestructible, the sap-wood quickly decays, and is rejected in using\r\nthe timber for any important purpose. Pieces of the sap adhering to\r\nthe heart-wood of which the old oak coffers were made, may often be\r\nfound riddled with worm holes and almost gone to dust, while the\r\nremainder of the chest is as sound as the day it was made two or three\r\nhundred years ago.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting, too, to notice marks of charring on the edge of the\r\nlids of these coffers; it is said that they were caused by placing the\r\nrushlight in that position, the flame just overhanging the edge, to\r\ngive time to jump into bed by its light leaving it to be automatically\r\nextinguished on reaching the wood; and that the charring occurred when\r\nsometimes the flame continued to burn a little longer than expected.\r\n\r\nOak is usually felled in the spring when the sap is rising, to allow\r\nof the easier removal of the bark for tanning. It is a pretty sight to\r\nsee, amidst the greenery of the standing trees, the stripped and\r\ngleaming trunks and larger limbs stretched upon the ground, with the\r\nneatly piled stacks of bark arranged for the air to draw through and\r\ndry them before removal. This is called \"rining\" in the New Forest,\r\nand good wages are earned at it by the men employed.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps the only timber, with the exception of sweet chestnut,\r\nthat is worthy to be used for the roofs of ecclesiastical buildings.\r\nAt Badsey, when we removed the roof of the church prior to\r\nrestoration, we found the oak timbers on the north side as sound as\r\nwhen placed there many years further back than living memory could\r\nrecall, and of which no record or tradition existed. These timbers\r\nwere all used again in the new roof, but those from the south side had\r\nto be discarded, having been much more exposed to driving rain and\r\ndaily changes of temperature.\r\n\r\nI had a number of oak field-gates made, but as the timber was barely\r\nseasoned, we were afraid shrinkage might take place in the mortises\r\nand tenons, and it was an agreeable surprise to find in a year or two\r\nthat nothing of the kind had happened. The mortise hole had apparently\r\ngot smaller, and still fitted the shrunken tenon to perfection. Oak\r\ngates will last, if kept occasionally painted, sixty or seventy years\r\nin farm use, and there were gates on my land fully that age and still\r\nquite serviceable.\r\n\r\nThe acorns from oaks in pastures are a trouble, as cattle are very\r\nfond of them and sometimes gorge themselves to such an extent as to\r\nprove fatal, if allowed unrestricted access to them when really\r\nhungry; but in the New Forest they are welcomed by the commoners\r\n(occupiers of private lands), some of whom possess the right of\r\n\"pannage\" (turning out pigs on the Crown property).\r\n\r\nIn old days the oak timbers of which our battleships were constructed\r\nwere supplied from the New Forest; and the saw-pit in which the\r\ntimbers of the _Victory_ were sawn by hand is still to be seen in\r\nBurley New Plantation. But Government methods appear to have been\r\ngenerally conducted in later times somewhat on the independent lines\r\nwhich distinguished them in the Great War. Some years ago it was said\r\nthat a department requiring oak timber advertised for tenders in a\r\nnewspaper, in which also appeared an advertisement of another\r\ndepartment offering oak for sale. A dealer who obtained an option to\r\npurchase from the latter, submitted a tender to the former, succeeded\r\nin obtaining the business, and cleared a large profit.\r\n\r\nThe oak has figured repeatedly in English history and occupies a\r\nunique place in our national tradition, commencing with its Druidical\r\nworship as a sacred tree. It was from an oak that the arrow of Walter\r\nTyrrel which struck down William Rufus is said to have glanced, and\r\nMagna Charta was signed beneath an oak by the unwilling hand of King\r\nJohn. It is associated in all ages with preachings, political\r\nmeetings, and with parish and county boundaries. These boundary oaks\r\nwere called Gospel-trees, it is said, because the gospel for the day\r\nwas read beneath them by the parochial priest during the annual\r\nperambulation of the parish boundaries by the leading inhabitants in\r\nRogation week. Herrick alludes to the practice in the lines addressed\r\nto Anthea in _Hesperides_:\r\n\r\n         \"Dearest, bury me\r\n     Under that Holy-oke or Gospel-tree,\r\n     Where (though thou see'st not) thou may'st think upon\r\n     Me, when thou yeerly go'st Procession.\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the oak that appeals most to the lively imagination\r\nvenerating old tales of merry England, and with whose story generous\r\nhearts are most in sympathy, is that\r\n\r\n     \"Wherein the younger Charles abode\r\n       Till all the paths were dim,\r\n     And far below the Roundhead rode,\r\n       And hummed a surly hymn.\"\r\n\r\nThe beech is not a common tree in the Vale of Evesham, preferring the\r\ndryer soils of the Cotswold Hills. It is said to have been introduced\r\nby the Romans, and is familiar as the tree mentioned by Virgil in the\r\nopening line of his first Pastoral:\r\n\r\n     \"_Tityre tu patulæ recubans sub tegmine fagi_;\"\r\n\r\nthe metre, and the words of which, apart from their signification,\r\nsuggest so accurately the pattering of the leaves of the tree in a\r\ngentle breeze. This device like alliteration is a method of\r\nintensifying the expression of a passage, and is frequently adopted by\r\nthe poets.\r\n\r\nIn another famous onomatopoeic line--\r\n\r\n     \"_Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum_\"\r\n\r\n--Virgil imitates the sound of a galloping horse, and the shaking of\r\nthe ground beneath its hoofs.\r\n\r\nTennyson renders very naturally the action of the northern farmer's\r\nnag and the sound of its movement, by--\r\n\r\n     \"Proputty, proputty sticks an' proputty, proputty graws.\"\r\n\r\nAnd an excellent example of the effect of well-chosen words, to\r\nexpress the sound produced by the subject referred to, occurs in the\r\n_Morte d'Arthur_:\r\n\r\n                 \"The many-knotted waterflags,\r\n     That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.\"\r\n\r\nBlackmore's passage in _Lorna Doone_, describing the superlative ease\r\nand speed of Tom Faggus's mare, when John Ridd as a boy was allowed to\r\nride her--after a rough experience at the beginning of the\r\nventure--is, though printed as prose, perhaps better poetry than most\r\nsimilar efforts. To emphasize its full force it may be allowable to\r\ndivide the phrases as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"I never had dreamed of such delicate motion,\r\n       Fluent, and graceful, and ambient,\r\n     Soft as the breeze flitting over the flowers,\r\n       But swift as the summer lightning.\r\n     I sat up again, but my strength was all spent,\r\n       And no time left to recover it,\r\n     And though she rose at our gate like a bird,\r\n       I tumbled off into the mixen.\"\r\n\r\nThe last line is a delightful bathos, adding immensely to the\r\ncompleteness of the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nIn spring the beech is the most beautiful of forest trees, putting\r\nforth individual horizontal sprays of tender green from the lower\r\nbranches about the end of April as heralds of the later full glory of\r\nthe tree. These increase day by day upwards in verdant clouds, until\r\nthe whole unites into a complete bower of dense greenery. The beech is\r\nknown as the \"groaning tree,\" because the branches often cross each\r\nother, and where the tree is exposed to the wind sometimes groan as\r\nthey rub together. The rubbing often causes a wound where one of the\r\nbranches will eventually break off, or occasionally automatic grafting\r\ntakes place, and they unite. In the Verderer's Hall at Lyndhurst\r\nspecimens are to be seen which have crossed and joined a second time,\r\nso that a complete hollow oval, or irregular circle of the wood could\r\nbe cut out of the branch.\r\n\r\nEstates where extensive beech woods existed have been bought by\r\nspeculative timber dealers, who shortly installed a gang of wood\r\ncutters and a steam saw, on which the timber was sawn into suitable\r\npieces, to be afterwards turned on a lathe into chair legs and other\r\ndomestic furniture, and very often finally dyed to represent mahogany.\r\nThere are beeches in the New Forest which vie with the oak for premier\r\nplace, measuring over 20 feet in circumference, and the mast together\r\nwith the acorns affords abundant harvest, or \"ovest,\" as it is called,\r\nfor the commoners' pigs.\r\n\r\nThere was a curious saying in use by persons on the road to Pershore,\r\nwhen asked their destination. In a good plum year the reply was,\r\n\"Pershore, where d'ye think?\" And in a year of scarcity, \"Pershore,\r\nGod help us!\" The same expressions were formerly current regarding\r\nBurley in the New Forest referring to the abundance or scarcity of\r\nbeech-mast and acorns, called collectively \"akermast.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the nation had presented the Duke of Wellington, after the Battle\r\nof Waterloo, with Strathfieldsaye, an estate between Basingstoke and\r\nReading, the Duke wishing to commemorate the event planted a number of\r\nbeech trees as a lasting memorial, which were known as \"the Waterloo\r\nbeeches.\" Some years later, the eminent arboricultural author, John\r\nLoudon, writing on the subject of the relative ages and sizes of\r\ntrees, wrote to the Duke for permission to view his Waterloo beeches.\r\nThe Duke had never heard of Loudon, and his writing being somewhat\r\nillegible he deciphered the signature \"J. Loudon\" as \"J. London\" (the\r\nBishop of London), and the word \"beeches\" as \"breeches.\" \"For what on\r\nearth can the Bishop want to see the breeches I wore at Waterloo?\"\r\nsaid the Duke; but taking a charitable view of the matter he decided\r\nthat the poor old Bishop must be getting irresponsible and replied\r\nthat he was giving his valet instructions to show the Bishop the\r\ngarments in question, whenever it suited him to inspect them. The\r\nBishop was equally amazed, but took exactly the same view about the\r\nDuke as the latter had decided upon concerning the Bishop. No doubt\r\nthe mystery was eventually cleared up, and Bishop and Duke must have\r\nboth enjoyed the joke.\r\n\r\nThe shade of the beech is so dense that grass will not grow beneath\r\nit; it gradually kills even holly, which is comparatively flourishing\r\nunder the oak. The beech woods in the Forest are thus quite free from\r\nundergrowth, and the noble trees with their smooth ash-coloured stems\r\ncan be seen in perfection, giving a cathedral aisle effect, which is\r\nerroneously said to have suggested the massive columns and groined\r\nroofs of Gothic architecture.\r\n\r\n     \"Where thro' the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault,\r\n     The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, too, an unearthly effect at times to be seen beneath them,\r\nso exaggerated as to remind one of the stage setting of a pastoral\r\nplay, with all the enhancing artificial contrivance of light and\r\nshade. It is to be seen only on a brilliantly sunny day, where the\r\ncontour of the space around the stem and below the branches takes the\r\nform of an arched cavern, flooded by a single shaft of sunlight,\r\npiercing the foliage at one particular spot, lighting up the floor\r\ncarpeted with last year's red-brown leaves, and emphasizing the gloom\r\nof the walls and roof. Imagination instantly supplies the players, for\r\na more perfect setting for Rosalind and Celia, Orlando and the\r\nmelancholy Jaques, it would be impossible to conceive. It is said that\r\nthe ancient Greeks could see with their ears and hear with their eyes,\r\na privilege doubtless granted to the nature lover in all ages. In the\r\nForest some of the most ancient and remarkable trees have borne for\r\ngenerations descriptive names such as the King and Queen oaks at\r\nBoldrewood, and the Eagle oak in Knightwood. The communion between\r\nhuman and tree life is well illustrated by a passage from Thoreau's\r\n_Walden_: \"I frequently tramped eight or ten miles through the deepest\r\nsnow to keep an appointment with a beech tree, or a yellow birch, or\r\nan old acquaintance among the pines.\"\r\n\r\nAt Aldington a most valuable tree was the willow, or \"withy,\" as it is\r\ncalled in Worcestershire, though in Hampshire the latter name is given\r\nto the Goat willow, or sallow (\"sally,\" in Worcestershire), bearing\r\nthe pretty blossoms known as palms, which in former times were worn by\r\nmen and boys in country places on Palm Sunday. My brooks were bordered\r\non both sides by pollard withies, the whole being divided into seven\r\nparts or annual cuts, so that, as they are lopped every seven years a\r\ncut came in for lopping each year. They were then well furnished with\r\nlong and heavy poles, which were severed close to the head of the\r\npollard with a sharp axe. When on the ground, the brushwood was cut\r\noff and tied into \"kids\" (faggots) for fire-lighting, the poles being\r\nmade into hurdles or sold to the crate-makers in the potteries for\r\ncrates in which to pack earthenware goods of all descriptions. The men\r\nemployed at the lopping had to stand on the heads of the pollards, and\r\nit was sometimes quite an acrobatic feat to maintain their balance on\r\na small swaying tree, or on one which overhung the water.\r\n\r\nThere was a local saying that \"the withy tree would buy the horse,\r\nwhile the oak would only buy the halter,\" and I believe it to be\r\nperfectly true; for the uses of the withy are innumerable, and\r\nthroughout its seven years' growth from one lopping to another there\r\nis always something useful to be had from it, with its final harvest\r\nof full-grown poles. One year after lopping the superfluous shoots are\r\ncut out and used or sold for \"bonds\" for tying up \"kids\" or the mouths\r\nof corn sacks. As the shoots grow stronger more can be taken--with\r\nultimate benefit to the development of the full-grown poles--for use\r\nas rick pegs and \"buckles\" in thatching. The buckles are the wooden\r\npins made of a small strip of withy, twisted at the centre so that it\r\ncan be doubled in half like a hairpin, and used to fix the rods which\r\nsecure the thatch by pressing the buckles firmly into it. In Hampshire\r\nthese are called \"spars,\" and they are sold in bundles containing a\r\nfixed number.\r\n\r\nI heard an amusing story about these spars. A certain thatcher, we may\r\ncall him Joe, was engaged upon the roof of a cottage, when the parson\r\nof the parish chanced to pass that way. Joe had of late neglected his\r\nattendance at church, and the vicar saw his way to a word of advice.\r\nAfter \"passing the time of day\" he took Joe to task for his neglected\r\nattendance and waxing warm expressed his fears that Joe had forgotten\r\nall his Sunday-school lessons; he was doubtful even, he said, if Joe\r\ncould tell him the number of the Commandments. Joe confessed his\r\nignorance. \"Dear me,\" said the vicar, \"to think that in this\r\nnineteenth century any man could be found so ignorant as not to know\r\nthe number of the Commandments!\" Joe bided his time until the vicar's\r\nattention had been called to the spars, when Joe asked him how many a\r\nbundle contained. It was a problem that the vicar could not solve.\r\n\"Dear me,\" said Joe, \"to think that in this 'ere nineteenth century\r\nany man could be found so ignorant as not to know the number of spars\r\nin a bundle!\" Joe always added when telling the story, \"But there,\" I\r\nsays, \"every beggar,\" I says, \"to his trade,\" I says.\r\n\r\nSometimes a picturesque gipsy would come to the Manor House with\r\nclothes-pegs for sale, and she generally negotiated a deal, for\r\neverybody has a sneaking regard for the gipsies and their romantic\r\nlife _sub Jove_. Walking round the farm shortly afterwards I would\r\ncome upon the remains of their fire and deserted camp by the roadside\r\nclose to the brook, the ground strewn with the peel and refuse from\r\nthe materials with which they had supplied themselves gratis, and I\r\nrecognized that we had been buying goods made from my own withies.\r\nEven so we did not complain, for no real harm was done to the trees.\r\n\r\nThe heads of these old pollards are favourite places for birds'-nests,\r\nand all kinds of plants and bushes take root in their decaying fibre,\r\nthe seeds having been carried by the birds; so that ivy, brambles,\r\nwild gooseberries, currants, raspberries, nut bushes and elders, can\r\nbe seen growing there. Whenever the foxhounds ran a fox to Aldington\r\nhe was always lost near the brookside, and it was said that the\r\ncunning beast eluded the hounds by mounting a pollard and jumping from\r\none to another, until the scent was dissipated. It was also a\r\ntradition that when hunting began on the Cotswolds the experienced\r\nfoxes left for the Vale, leaving the less crafty to fight it out with\r\nthe hounds; for the Evesham district was seldom visited by the hunt,\r\nowing to possible damage to the highly cultivated winter crops of the\r\nmarket-gardeners.\r\n\r\nJarge had a very narrow escape when grubbing out an old willow\r\noverhanging a pool. He had been at work some hours, and had a deep\r\ntrench dug out all round the tree, to attack the roots with a\r\nstock-axe. He had cut them all through except the tough tap-root, when\r\nI reached him, and he was standing in the trench at work upon it. He\r\nwas certain that it would be some time before the tree fell, the\r\ntap-root being very large; but, as I stood watching on the ground\r\nabove, I thought I saw a suspicious tremor pass over the tree, and an\r\ninstant later I was certain it was coming down. I shouted to him to\r\nget out of the trench. It took a second or two to get clear, as the\r\ntrench was deep, and he was not a tall man, so he was scarcely out\r\nwhen the tree fell with a crash on the exact spot where he had been at\r\nwork. Had I not been present it must have fallen upon him, for not\r\nexpecting the end was so near he had not been watching the signs.\r\nThough not a tall tree, it was a very stout and heavy trunk, and the\r\ntap-root on inspection proved to be partly rotten.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \"Forth into the fields I went,\r\n     And Nature's living motion lent\r\n     The pulse of hope to discontent.\r\n\r\n     \"I wonder'd at the bounteous hours,\r\n     The slow result of winter showers:\r\n     You scarce could see the grass for flowers.\r\n\r\n     \"I wonder'd, while I paced along:\r\n     The woods were fill'd so full with song,\r\n     There seemed no room for sense of wrong.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is Tennyson's description of a spring day in the fields and\r\nwoods, and nothing more beautiful could be written. And so it was with\r\njoy that my men and carter boys with waggons and teams started early\r\non the spring mornings to bring home the newly purchased hop-poles\r\nfrom the distant woods. These poles are sold by auction in stacks\r\nwhere they are cut, and the buyer has to cart them home. Usually,\r\nafter a successful hop year they were in great demand; prices would\r\nrise in proportion, and the early seller did well, but when the later\r\nsales came sometimes, the demand being satisfied, there would be a\r\nheavy fall in values, and as a cunning buyer expressed it, \"The poles\r\nlasted longer than the money.\"\r\n\r\nThe dainty catkins of the hazel are the first sign of awakening life\r\nin the woods; they are well out by the end of January or early in\r\nFebruary, and as they ripen, clouds of pollen are disseminated by the\r\nwind. Tennyson speaks of \"Native hazels tassel-hung.\" The female\r\nbloom, which is the immediate precursor of the nut itself, is a pretty\r\nlittle pink star, which can be found on the same branch as the catkin\r\nbut is much less conspicuous; and both are a very welcome sight, as\r\nalmost the earliest hint of spring. The hazel bloom is shortly\r\nfollowed by the green leaves of the woodbine, which climbs so\r\nexultingly to the tops of the highest trees and breathes its fragrance\r\non a summer evening. In the New Forest the green hellebore is early\r\nand noticeable from its peculiar green blossoms, but I have not seen\r\nit in Worcestershire.\r\n\r\nMy men and teams were generally off to the hills, Blockley, Broadway,\r\nWinchcombe, Farmcote, and suchlike out-of-the-way places, when the wet\r\n\"rides\" in the woods were drying up. The boys especially revelled in\r\nthe flowers--primroses and wild hyacinths--and came home with huge\r\nbunches; they enjoyed the novelty of the woods and the wild\r\nhill-country, which is such a contrast to the flat and highly\r\ncultivated Vale.\r\n\r\nWhen unloaded at home the poles have to be trimmed, cut to the proper\r\nlength, 12 to 14 feet, \"sharped,\" \"shaved\" at the butt 2 or 3 feet\r\nupwards, and finally boiled so far for twenty-four hours, standing\r\nupright in creosote, which doubles the lasting period of their\r\nexistence. They were chiefly ash, larch, maple, wych elm, and sallow,\r\nand the rough butts, when sawn off before the sharping, supplied the\r\nfiring for the boiling. Green ash is splendid for burning: \"The ash\r\nwhen green is fuel for a Queen.\" Later, when I adopted a Kentish\r\nsystem of hop-growing on coco-nut yarn supported by steel wire on\r\nheavy larch poles, our visits to the woods were less frequent, and\r\nmuch wear and tear of horses and waggons was saved. Some of our\r\njourneys, in the earlier days, took us to the estate of the Duc\r\nd'Aumale, on the Worcester side of Evesham, where some excellent ash\r\npoles were grown. In one lot of some thousands I bought, every pole\r\nhad a crook in it (\"like a dog's hind leg,\" my men said), about 2 or 3\r\nfeet from the ground, which was caused by the Duc having given orders\r\nsome years previously, on the occasion of a visit from the Prince of\r\nWales (the late King Edward), to have a large area of young coppice\r\ncut off at that height, to make a specially convenient piece of\r\nwalking and pheasant shooting for the Prince.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion many people went to Evesham Station to see the\r\narrival of the Prince and retinue, and their departure for Wood Norton\r\nin the Duc's carriages. Our old vicar was returning full of loyalty,\r\nand passing an ancient Badsey radical inquired if he had been to see\r\nthe Prince. \"Noa, sir,\" was the reply, \"I been a-working hard to get\r\nsome money to keep 'e with.\" In some of the Wood Norton woods there\r\nare large numbers of fir trees, planted, it was said, as roosting\r\nplaces for the pheasants, so that they might not be visible to the\r\nnight poacher; but it was found that the birds preferred the leafless\r\ntrees, where they offer an easy pot shot in the moonlight or in the\r\ngrey of the dawn.\r\n\r\nThe Scots-fir is an interloper in the New Forest, and always looks out\r\nof place; it was introduced as an experiment I believe, less than 150\r\nyears ago, and has been found useful as I have explained for\r\nsheltering young plantations of oaks. It grows rapidly, and has been\r\nplanted by itself on land too poor for more valuable timber, chiefly\r\nfor pit-props. During the war immense numbers of Canadians and\r\nPortuguese have been employed in felling these trees and cutting them\r\nup into stakes for wire entanglements, trench timbers, and sleepers\r\nfor light railways. Huge temporary villages have grown up for the\r\naccommodation of the men employed, equipped with steam sawing-tackle,\r\ncanteens, offices and quarters, and with light railways running far\r\naway into the plantations where the trees are cut. It was a wonderful\r\nsight to see these busy centres alive with men and machinery, in\r\nplaces where before there was nothing but the silence of the woods.\r\nAnd it is curious that, as in the old days the New Forest provided the\r\noak timber for the battleships that fought upon the sea in Nelson's\r\ntime, so now, in the fighting on land, we have been able to export\r\nfrom the same place hundreds of thousands of tons of fir for the use\r\nof our troops in France and Belgium.\r\n\r\nOld railway sleepers are exceedingly useful for many purposes on\r\nfarms, and as they are soaked in creosote, they last many years, for\r\nlight bridges and rough shelters, after they are worn out for railway\r\npurposes. The railway company adjoining my land discarded a quantity\r\nof these partly defective sleepers, and left them, for a time, lying\r\nbeside the hedge which separated the line from my fields. I applied to\r\nthe Company for some, and suggested that they need only be put over\r\nthe hedge, and I would cart them away. But that is not the routine of\r\nthe working of such matters; though it appeals to the simple rustic\r\nmind, it would be considered \"irregular.\" They had to be loaded on\r\ntrucks sent specially on the railway, taken to Worcester sixteen miles\r\nby train, unloaded, sorted, loaded again, sent back to my station,\r\nunloaded, loaded again on to my waggons, and carted a mile and a half\r\non the waggons which had been sent empty the same distance to the\r\nstation!\r\n\r\nOvergrown old hedges are exceedingly pretty in autumn when hung with\r\nclusters of \"haws,\" the brilliant berries of the hawthorn, and the\r\n\"hips\" of the wild rose. There is, too, the peculiar pink-hued berry\r\nof the spindle wood, and, in chalky and limestone districts, the \"old\r\nman's beard\" of the wild clematis, bright fresh hazel nuts, and golden\r\nwreaths of wild hops. It is said that\r\n\r\n     \"Hops, reformation, bays and beer\r\n     Came into England all in a year.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is certain that the wild hops at any rate must have been\r\nindigenous, for one finds them in neighbourhoods far from districts\r\nwhere hops are cultivated, and the couplet probably refers to the\r\nFlemish variety, which would be the sort imported in the days of Henry\r\nVIII., though at the present time our best varieties are far superior.\r\n\r\nThe holly is only seen as garden hedges in the more sandy parishes of\r\nWorcestershire, but here in the Forest it is a splendid feature,\r\ngrowing to a great size and height. In winter its bright shining\r\nleaves reflecting the sunlight enliven the woods, so that we never get\r\nthe bare and cheerless look of places where the elm and the whitethorn\r\nhedge dominate the landscape. In spring its small white blossoms are\r\nthickly distributed, and at Christmas its scarlet berries are ever\r\nwelcome. Its prickles protect it from browsing cattle and Forest\r\nponies, but it is interesting to notice that many of the leaves on the\r\ntopmost branches being out of reach of the animals are devoid of this\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN--WHEAT--RIDGE AND FURROW--BARLEY--FARMERS NEWSTYLE AND OLDSTYLE.\r\n\r\n     \"He led me thro' the short sweet-smelling lanes\r\n     Of his wheat-suburb, babbling as he went.\"\r\n                                             --_The Brook_.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to enter upon the ordinary details of arable farming,\r\nas not of very general interest, except for those actually engaged\r\nthereon. I am aiming especially at the more unusual crops, and what I\r\nmay call the curiosities of agriculture. It is most interesting to\r\nturn to Virgil's _Georgics_ and see how they apply after the lapse of\r\nnearly twenty centuries to the farm-work of the present day. Horace,\r\ntoo, was a farmer, though perhaps more of an amateur; he exclaims at\r\nthe busy scene presented when men and horses are engaged in active\r\nfield work:\r\n\r\n     \"_Heu heu! quantus equis quantus adest viris Sudor!_\"\r\n\r\nwhich, by the way, was rendered with Victorian propriety by a\r\nwell-known Oxford professor, \"What a quantity of perspiration!\" etc.\r\nProbably Horace had been watching the sowing of barley or oats on a\r\nfine March morning, \"the peck of March dust,\" which we know is \"worth\r\na King's ransom,\" flying behind the harrows. George Cruikshank gives a\r\nvery spirited and comic realization of Horace's lines, in Hoskin's\r\n_Talpa_, where ploughing, sowing, harrowing, reaping, harvesting,\r\nthrashing, grinding and carting away the finished product, are all\r\nactively proceeding in the same field.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the word \"field,\" still locally pronounced \"feld,\" as in\r\n\"Badsey Feld,\" near Evesham, takes us back to primeval times when the\r\ncountry was mostly forest, of which certain parts had been \"felled,\"\r\nand were thus distinguished as opposed to the untouched portions. We\r\nmay be sure that the best pieces of land were the first to be brought\r\nunder cultivation, and it is thus that the best land in most old\r\nparishes, at the present day, is to be found close to the village, and\r\nis generally a portion of the manor property. Later, where glebe was\r\nallotted for the parson's benefit, the poorer parts were apparently\r\nconsidered good enough for the purpose, so that we generally expect to\r\nfind the glebe on somewhat inferior land.\r\n\r\nWheat-growing at Aldington and on most heavy soils was practically\r\nkilled by the vast importations from the United States, rendered\r\npossible by the extraction of the natural fertility of her virgin\r\nsoils, and by the development of steam traction and transport,\r\nresulting in the food crisis at home during the war. The loss of\r\narable land converted to inferior grass amounted, in the forty years\r\nfrom 1874 to 1914, to no less than four million acres. I made such\r\nchanges in my own cropping that, where I formerly grew 100 acres of\r\nwheat annually, I reduced the area to ten or twenty acres, mainly for\r\nthe sake of the straw for litter and thatching purposes.\r\n\r\nWheat can be planted in what would be considered a very unsuitable\r\ntilth for barley. We had often to follow the drills--where they had\r\ncut into the clayey soil, leaving the seed uncovered, and where the\r\nground was so sticky and \"unkind\" that harrowing had very little\r\neffect--with forks, turning the clods over the exposed seed, and\r\ntreading them down. Wheat seems to like as firm a seed-bed as\r\npossible, for the best crop was always on the headland, where the\r\nturning of the horses and implements had reduced the soil to the\r\ncondition of mortar. The seed would lie in the cold ground for many\r\nweeks before the blade made its appearance, but the men always said,\r\n\"'Twill be heavy in the head when it lies long abed.\" It is cheering\r\nin late autumn and early winter when no other young growth is to be\r\nseen on the farm, suddenly to find the field covered with the fresh\r\nshoots of the wheat in regular lines, and to notice how, after its\r\nfirst appearance, it makes little further upright growth for a time,\r\nbut spreads laterally over the ground as the roots extend downwards.\r\n\r\nNothing in the way of weather will kill wheat, except continuous heavy\r\nrain in winter, where the land is undrained, and stagnant water\r\ncollects. I have seen it in May lying flat on the ground after a\r\nsevere spring frost, but in a day or two it would pick up again as if\r\nnothing had happened. And I have seen beans, 2 feet high, cut down and\r\ndoubled up, revive and rear up their heads quite happily, though at\r\nharvest the exact spot in every stalk could be seen where the wound\r\nhad taken place.\r\n\r\nIn May, if the weather is cold and ungenial, wheat turns yellow; this\r\nis the weaning time of the young plants, which have then exhausted the\r\nnourishment contained in the seed, and in the absence of growing\r\nweather they do not take kindly to the food in the land, upon which\r\nthey now become dependent.\r\n\r\n     \"The farmer came to his wheat in May,\r\n     And right sorrowfully went away,\r\n     The farmer came to his wheat in June,\r\n     And went away whistling a merry tune.\"\r\n\r\nHis wheat was what is called \"May-sick\" the first time, but had\r\nrecovered on the second visit, for another old saw tells us that, \"A\r\ndripping June puts all in tune.\"\r\n\r\nMay is said \"Never to go out without a wheat-ear,\" but I do not think\r\nthis is invariably true, though by splitting open a young wheat stem\r\nit is easy to find the embryo ear, only about half an inch long. I\r\nhave heard people exclaiming at the beautiful effect of the breezes\r\npassing over a luxuriant field of growing wheat, giving the appearance\r\nof waves on a lake; but when the wheat is in bloom, it is doubtful if\r\nthis is a reason for congratulation, as the blooms are rubbed off in\r\nthe process, which may be the cause of thin-chested ears at harvest,\r\nwhen, instead of being set in full rows of four or five grains\r\nabreast, only two or three can be found, reducing the total number in\r\nan ear from a maximum of about seventy to fifty or less.\r\n\r\n\"God makes the grass to grow greener while the farmer's at his\r\ndinner,\" is a proverb which may be applied to almost any enterprise,\r\nfor optimism is largely a physical matter, and \"it is ill talking with\r\na hungry man.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose that no man, even with the dullest imagination, can fail to\r\nwalk across a wheat field at harvest without being reminded of some of\r\nthe innumerable stories and allusions to corn fields in the Bible. He\r\nwill remember how, when the famine was sore in the land of Canaan,\r\nJacob sent his ten sons to Egypt to buy corn, and how Joseph knew his\r\nbrethren, but they knew him not; with the touching details of his\r\nemotion, until he could no longer refrain himself, and, weeping, made\r\nhimself known. How he bade them return, and bring their aged father,\r\ntheir little ones, and their flocks and herds, to dwell in the land of\r\nGoshen.\r\n\r\nHis mind, too, will revert to the commandment given to Moses, \"When ye\r\nreap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners\r\nof thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest\";\r\nso that he will meet the villagers with a word of welcome, when they\r\ninvade his fields for the same time-honoured purpose.\r\n\r\nHe will remember the story of Ruth and Boaz, told in the exquisite\r\npoetry of the Bible diction, than which nothing in the whole range of\r\nliterature can compare in noble simplicity. And the corn fields of the\r\nNew Testament, where the disciples plucked the ears of corn, and were\r\nencouraged, and the accusing Pharisees rebuked; with the conclusive\r\ndeclaration that the Sabbath was made for man and not man for the\r\nSabbath. And, finally, the familiar chapter in the burial service,\r\nwhich has brought comfort to thousands of mourners, and will so\r\ncontinue till the last harvest, which is the end of the world, when\r\nthe angels will be the reapers.\r\n\r\nThe word \"gleaning\" is never heard in Worcestershire for collecting\r\nthe scattered wheat stems and ears; it is invariably \"leasing\" from\r\nthe Old English, _lesan_, to gather or collect anything. When wheat\r\nwas fairly high in price the village women and children were in the\r\nfield as soon as it was cleared of sheaves, and they made a pretty\r\npicture scattered about the golden stubble, and returning through the\r\nmeadows and lanes at twilight with their ample gatherings.\r\n\r\nThe \"leasings\" would be thrashed by husband or brother with the old\r\nflail, in one of my barns, to be then ground at the village mill, and\r\nlastly baked into fragrant loaves of home-made bread--the \"dusky\r\nloaf,\" as Tennyson says, \"that smelt of home.\" One good old soul\r\nbrought me every week, while the \"leased corn\" lasted, a small loaf\r\ncalled \"a batch cake,\" and continued the gift later, made from wheat\r\ngrown on the family allotment; her loaves were some of the best and\r\nthe sweetest bread I have ever tasted.\r\n\r\n\"The man who makes two blades of grass grow where one grew before\" is\r\nsaid to be a national benefactor, and, I suppose, the same adage\r\napplies _a fortiori_ to wheat, but I have never seen a monument raised\r\nto his memory or even the circulation of the national hat for his\r\nbenefit. Too often the only proof of his neighbour's recognition of\r\nhis improved crops is the notification of an increased assessment of\r\nthe amount of his liability to contribute to what is, still quite\r\nunsuitably, called the poor rate.\r\n\r\nWheat rejoices in a tropical summer, and it never succeeds better than\r\nwhen stiff land like mine splits into deep cracks, locally called\r\n\"chawns.\" You can see the root-fibres crossing these cracks which go\r\nso far into the earth that a walking-stick can be inserted to touch\r\nthe drain pipes in the furrows at a depth of 2-1/2 or 3 feet.\r\nApparently this cracking acts as a kind of root-pruning, and lets in\r\nthe heat of the sun to the lower roots of the corn, with the result\r\nof, what is called, a great \"cast\" (yield) to the acre.\r\n\r\nIn building wheat ricks the most important point is to arrange the\r\nsheaves with the butts sloping outwards, so that should rain fall\r\nbefore thatching, the water will run away from the centre. I remember\r\nat Alton, where the rick-builder was an old and experienced man, he\r\nneglected this precaution; some weeks of heavy rain followed, but in\r\ntime the thatching was completed, and nobody dreamed of any harm. When\r\nthe thrashing machine arrived, and the ricks were uncovered, the wheat\r\nwas found so damp that, in places, the ears had grown into solid mats,\r\nand the sheaves could only be parted by cutting with a hay-knife. The\r\nold man was so discomfited that the tears rolled down his cheeks, and\r\nthe master's loss amounted to something like £300. There was not a\r\nsack of dry wheat on that particular farm that winter, though some was\r\nsaleable at a reduced price. He told me that it was a costly business\r\nfor him, but worth any money as a lesson to me. I took it to heart,\r\nand we never left a rick uncovered at Aldington; as fast as one was\r\ncompleted, and the builder descended the ladder, the thatcher took his\r\nplace, and temporarily \"hung\" it with straw, secured by partially\r\ndriven-in rick pegs until we could find time to attend to the regular\r\nthatching.\r\n\r\nThe high ridges and deep furrows, to be seen on the heavy arable lands\r\nof the Vale of Evesham, are a source of wonderment to people who come\r\nfrom light land districts, and who do not recognize how impervious is\r\nthe subsoil to the penetration of water. The origin of these highly\r\nbanked ridges dates from far-away days before land drain pipes were\r\nobtainable, and it was the only possible arrangement to prevent the\r\nperishing of crops from standing water in the winter. The rain quickly\r\nfound its way into the furrows from the ridges, and, as they always\r\nsloped in the direction of the lowest part of the field, the\r\nsuperfluous water soon disappeared. Even now, when drain pipes are\r\nlaid in the furrows, it is not advisable to level the ridges, because\r\nthe water would take much longer to find the drains, and the growing\r\ncrop would be endangered. It is not safe to drain this land deeper\r\nthan about 2-1/2 feet, and many thousands of pounds have been\r\nmisapplied where draining has been done on money borrowed from\r\ncompanies who insist upon 3 feet as the minimum depth for any portion\r\nof the drain, which would mean much more than that where the drain\r\noccasionally passes through a stretch of rising ground. As proving my\r\nstatement that 2-1/2 feet is quite deep enough, I have seen great\r\npools of water after a heavy rain standing exactly over the drain in\r\nthe furrows, and we had sometimes to pierce the soil to the depth of\r\nthe pipes, with an iron rod made for the purpose, before the water\r\ncould get away.\r\n\r\nOn light land, the subsoil of which is often full of water, the case\r\nis quite different, and the pipes must be laid much deeper to relieve\r\nits water-logged condition; but on our stiff clay the subsoil was\r\ncomparatively dry, and we had to provide only for the discharge of the\r\nsurface water as quickly as possible, where the solid clay beneath\r\nprevented its sinking into the lower layers.\r\n\r\nIn the subsoil of the lias clay there are large numbers of a fossil\r\nshell, _Gryphea incurva_, known locally as \"devils claws\"; they\r\ncertainly have a demoniac claw-like appearance, and worry the drainers\r\nby catching on the blade of the draining tool, and preventing its\r\npenetration into the clay.\r\n\r\nI have heard the suggestion that our highly banked ridges were\r\nintended to increase the surface of the land available for the crops,\r\njust as it takes more cloth to cover a hump back than a normal one,\r\nbut of course the rounded ridge does not provide any more _vertical\r\nposition_ for the crop, and the theory cannot be maintained. Some of\r\nthese ridges, \"lands\" as they are called, are so wide and so elevated\r\nthat it was said that two teams could pass each other in the furrows,\r\non either side of a single \"land,\" so hidden by the high ridge that\r\nthey could not see one another; and I myself have noticed them on\r\nabandoned arable land that has been in grass from time immemorial, so\r\nhigh as nearly to answer the description. Though the blue clay in the\r\nVale of Evesham is so tenacious, it works beautifully after a few\r\nsharp frosts, splitting up into laminations that form a splendidly\r\nmouldy seed bed, so that frost has been eloquently called \"God's\r\nplough.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a very curious fact that many of these old \"lands\" take the form\r\nof a greatly elongated [Illustration: (S backwards)], though not so\r\npronounced as that figure, for the curves are only visible towards the\r\nends, and these curves always turn to the left of anyone walking\r\ntowards the end. Various explanations have been given, and one by Lord\r\nAvebury is the nearest approach to a correct solution which I have\r\nseen, though not, I think, quite accurate. My own idea is that, as the\r\nplough turns each furrow-slice only to the right, the beginning of the\r\nridge would be accomplished by two furrows thrown together on the top\r\nof each other, and the remainder would be gathered around them by\r\ncontinuing the process, until the \"land\" was formed with an open\r\nfurrow on each side. The eight oxen would be harnessed in pairs, or\r\nthe four horses tandem fashion. When they reached the end of each\r\nfurrow-slice, the plough-boy, walking on the near side, would have to\r\nturn the long team on the narrow headland, and in order to get room to\r\nreach a position for starting the next furrow-slice, he would have to\r\nbear to the left before commencing the actual turn. In the meantime\r\nthe horse next the plough would be completing the furrow-slice alone,\r\nand would, naturally, try to follow the other three horses towards the\r\nleft, so that the furrow-slice at its end would slightly deviate from\r\nthe straight line. When the horses were all turned, the second\r\nfurrow-slice would follow the error in the first, and the same\r\ndeviation would occur at each end of the ploughing, gradually becoming\r\nmore and more pronounced, until the curved form of each ridge became\r\napparent. Lord Avebury says that when the driver, walking on the near\r\nside, reached the end of each furrow, he found it easier to turn the\r\nteam by pulling them round than by pushing them, thus accounting for\r\nthe slight curvature.\r\n\r\nThe saying,\r\n\r\n     \"He that by the plough would thrive\r\n     Himself must either hold or drive,\"\r\n\r\nis largely true, but only the small farmer can comply with it. The man\r\nof many acres cannot restrict his presence to one field, and must\r\nadopt for his motto the equally true proverb, \"The master's eye does\r\nmore than both his hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe thrashing-machine is the ultimate test of the yield or cast of the\r\nwheat crop, and it seems to have something itself to say about it. For\r\nwhen the straw is short the cast is generally good, and _vice versa_.\r\nIn the first case the machine runs evenly, and gives out a contented\r\nand cheerful hum, but in the second it remonstrates with intermittent\r\ngrunts and groans. Even when the yield is pretty good, the voice of\r\nthe machine is not nearly so encouraging to the imaginative farmer,\r\nwhen prices are low, as when prices are up.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of my farming the gloomy note of the machine was\r\nthat which predominated, but in the spring of 1877, on the prospect of\r\ncomplications with Russia, when wheat rose to I think nearly 70s. a\r\nquarter, it was again a cheerful sound, for I had several ricks of the\r\nprevious year's crop on hand. I do not remember that bread rose to\r\nanything like the extent that occurred in the Great War. Forty years\r\nhas marvellously widened the gap between the raw material and the\r\nfinished product--that is, between producer and consumer; immense\r\nincreases have taken place in the cost of labour employed by miller\r\nand baker, and rates and other expenses are much higher.\r\n\r\nFarmers do not lose much in \"bad debts\"; they have to lay out their\r\ncapital in cash payments so long before the return that they are not\r\nexpected to give extended credit when sales take place, and for corn\r\npayment is made fourteen days after the sale is effected. I had one\r\nrather narrow escape. I had sold 150 sacks of wheat to a miller, and\r\nit had been delivered to the mill, but one evening I had a note from\r\nhim to say that his credit was in question on the local markets. \"A\r\nnod,\" I thought, \"was as good as a wink to a blind horse\"; so next\r\nmorning I sent all my teams and waggons, and by night had carted all\r\nthe wheat away, except twenty sacks, which had already been ground.\r\nThe miller paid eventually 10s. in the £, so my loss was only a matter\r\nof about £10.\r\n\r\nA similar \"chap money,\" or return of a trifle in cash from seller to\r\nbuyer, as that in vogue in horse-dealing, still exists in selling\r\ncorn; it goes by the indefinite name of \"custom,\" and in\r\nWorcestershire it was a fixed sum of 1s. in every sixty bushels of\r\nwheat, and 1s. in every eighty bushels of barley; each of these\r\nquantities formed the ancient load. I think the payment of \"custom\"\r\narose when tarpaulin sheets were first used instead of straw to cover\r\nthe waggon loads. The straw never returned; it was the miller's\r\nperquisite, and its value paid for the beer to which the carters were\r\ntreated at the mill; but the tarpaulin comes back each time, so the\r\nmiller gets his _quid pro quo_ in the \"custom.\"\r\n\r\nBarley was not an important crop at Aldington, the land was too stiff,\r\nbut I had some fields which contained limestone, where good crops\r\ncould be grown. Even there it was inclined to coarseness, but in dry\r\nseasons sometimes proved a very nice bright and thin-skinned sample.\r\nBefore the repeal of the malt tax, which was accompanied by\r\nlegislation that permitted the brewers to use sugar, raw grain and\r\nalmost anything, including, as people said, \"old boots and shoes\"\r\ninstead of barley malt, good prices, up to 42s. a quarter and over,\r\ncould be made; but under the new conditions, the maltsters complained\r\nthat my barley was too good for them, and they could buy foreign stuff\r\nat about 22s. or 24s., which, with the help of sugar, produced a class\r\nof beer quite good enough for the Black Country and Pottery consumers.\r\n\r\nI heard an amusing story about barley in Lincolnshire, some years\r\nbefore the repeal of the malt tax, which, I think, is worth recording.\r\nA farmer, after a very hot summer and dry harvest, had a good piece of\r\nbarley which he offered by sample in Lincoln market. He could not make\r\nhis price, the buyers complaining that it was too hard and flinty. He\r\nwent home in disgust, but, after much pondering, thought he could see\r\nhis way to meet the difficulty. He had the sacks of barley \"shut\" on\r\nhis barn floor, in a heap, and several buckets of water poured over\r\nit. The heap was turned daily for a time, until the grain had absorbed\r\nall the water, and there was no sign of external moisture. The\r\nappearance of the barley was completely changed: the hard flinty look\r\nhad vanished, and the grain presented a new plumpness and mellowness.\r\nHe took a fresh sample to Lincoln next market day, and made 2s. or 3s.\r\na quarter more than he had asked for it in its original condition.\r\n\r\nThe following lines, which have never been published except in a local\r\nnewspaper, though written many years ago, apply quite well in these\r\ndays of the hoped-for revival of agriculture.

and will be much bitten with\r\na little black flye, who, also, will not do harme unto good hoppes,\r\nwho if she leave the leaf as full of holes as a nettle, yet she\r\nseldome proceedeth to the utter destruction of the Hoppe; where the\r\ngarden standeth bleake, the heat of summer will reform this matter.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Tusser, who lived 1515 to 1580, in his _Five Hundred Points of\r\nGood Husbandry_, included many seasonable verses on Hop-growing, among\r\nwhich the following are worth quoting:\r\n\r\n                         MAY.\r\n\r\n     Get into thy hop-yard for now it is time\r\n       To teach Robin Hop on his pole how to climb,\r\n     To follow the sun, as his property is,\r\n       And weed him and trim him if aught go amiss.\r\n\r\n                        JUNE.\r\n\r\n     Whom fancy perswadeth among other crops,\r\n       To have for his spending sufficient of hops:\r\n     Must willingly follow of choices to chuse\r\n       Such lessons approved, as skilfull do use.\r\n\r\n     Ground gravelly, sandy, and mixed with clay,\r\n       Is naughty for hops, any manner of way;\r\n     Or if it be mingled with rubbish and stone,\r\n       For dryness and barrenness let it alone.\r\n\r\n     Chuse soil for the hop of the rottenest mould,\r\n       Well dunged and wrought as a garden plot should:\r\n     Not far from the water (but not overflown),\r\n       This lesson well noted is meet to be known.\r\n\r\n     The sun in the south, or else southly and west,\r\n       Is joy to the hop, as welcomed ghest:\r\n     But wind in the north, or else northerly east,\r\n       To hop is as ill, as a fray in a feast.\r\n\r\n     Meet plot for a hop-yard, once found as is told,\r\n       Make thereof account, as of jewell of gold:\r\n     Now dig it and leave it the sun for to burn,\r\n       And afterward fence it to serve for that turn.\r\n\r\n     The hop for his profit, I thus do exalt,\r\n       It strengtheneth drink and it favoureth malt,\r\n     And being well brewed, long kept it will last,\r\n       And drawing abide, if ye draw not too fast.\r\n\r\nIn Worcestershire and Herefordshire hop-gardens are always called\r\nhop-yards, which seems to be only a local and more ancient form of the\r\nsame word, and from the same root. The termination occurs also in\r\n\"orchard\"--from the Anglo-Saxon _ortgeard_ (a wort-yard)\r\n--\"olive-yard,\" and \"vineyard.\"\r\n\r\nThe quotation from the _Perfitie Platforme of a Hoppe Garden_ refers\r\nto \"a little black flye,\" now called \"the flea\" (Worcestershire plural\r\n\"flen\"), really a beetle like the \"turnip fly,\" and it is the first\r\npest that attacks the hop every year.\r\n\r\n     \"First the flea, then the fly,\r\n     Then the lice, and then they die,\"\r\n\r\nis a couplet repeated in all the hop districts to-day, but the damage\r\ndone by the flea is not to be compared to that caused by the next\r\npest, the fly. The latter is one of the numerous species of aphis\r\nwhich begins its attack in the winged state, and after producing\r\nwingless green lice in abundance--which further increase by the\r\nprocess known as \"gemmation\"--reappears with wings in the final\r\ngeneration of the lice, and hibernates in readiness for its visitation\r\nin the spring next year.\r\n\r\nSo long as the hop plant maintains its health the aphis is\r\ncomparatively harmless, for the plant is then able to elaborate to the\r\nfull the bitter principle which is its natural protection. On a really\r\nhot day in July it is sometimes possible to detect the distinctive\r\nscent of the hop quite plainly in walking through the plantation, long\r\nbefore any hops appear, and when this is noticeable very little of the\r\naphis blight can be found. There is however nearly always a small\r\nsprinkling lying in wait, and a few days of unsuitable weather will\r\nreduce the vitality of the plant so that the blight immediately begins\r\nto increase.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that all the distinctive principles of plants or\r\ntrees have been evolved, and are in perfect health elaborated, as a\r\nprotection from their most destructive insect or fungoid enemies; just\r\nas physical protective equipment, such as thorns, prickles, and\r\nstinging apparatus, is produced by other plants or trees as safeguards\r\nagainst more powerful foes. If it were not so, plants that are even\r\nnow seriously damaged and kept in check by such pests would long ago\r\nhave become extinct.\r\n\r\nPursuing this theory it seems likely that the solanin of the potato is\r\nits natural protection against the disease caused by the fungus\r\n_Phytophthora infestans_. The idea is suggested by the invariably\r\nincreasing liability to the potato disease experienced as new sorts\r\nbecome old. The new kinds of potatoes are produced from the seed--not\r\nthe tubers--of the old varieties, and the seed, when fully vitalized\r\nand capable of germination, may be assumed to contain the maximum\r\npotentiality for transmission of the active principle to the tubers\r\nimmediately descended from it. During the early years of their\r\nexistence these revitalized tubers contain so much solanin that they\r\nare not only injurious, but more or less poisonous, to man, and it is\r\nonly after they have been cultivated, and have produced further\r\ngenerations of tubers _from_ tubers, that they become eatable, showing\r\nthat in the tuber condition the plant gradually loses its efficient\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the hop the most effective remedy is a solution of\r\nquassia and soft soap. The caustic potash in the soap neutralizes the\r\noily integument of the lice and dries them up, but the quassia\r\nsupplies a bitter principle not unlike that of the hop, though without\r\nits grateful aroma, which acts as a protection in the absence of the\r\nbitter of the hop itself. So closely does the hop bitter resemble that\r\nof quassia, that in seasons of hop failure it is said to be employed\r\nas a substitute in brewing, and at one time its use for that purpose\r\nwas prohibited by law.\r\n\r\nAs a further proof that the bitter principle of the hop is distasteful\r\nto the aphis, it is noticeable that when the fly first arrives it\r\nalways attacks the topmost shoots of the bine where the leaves have\r\nnot developed, and where the active principle is likely to be weakest.\r\nThe same position is selected by the aphis of the rose, the bean, and\r\nevery plant or tree subject to aphis attack--it is the undeveloped and\r\ntherefore unprotected part which is chosen.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that when a destructive blight is\r\nproceeding--generally in a wet and cold time--and a sudden change\r\noccurs to really hot dry weather, the hop plant often recovers its\r\ntone automatically, shakes off the disease, and the blight dies away,\r\na fact which strengthens the assumption that in normal weather the\r\nplant can protect itself. Again, the blight is always most persistent\r\nunder the shade of trees or tall hedges, or where the bine is over\r\nluxuriant, when owing to the exclusion of light and air the plant is\r\nunable to elaborate its natural safeguard.\r\n\r\nFertilizers not well balanced as to their constituents, and containing\r\nan excess of nitrogen, act as stimulants without supplying the\r\nminerals necessary for perfect health. The effect is the same as that\r\nproduced in man by an excess of alcohol and a deficiency of nourishing\r\nfood, the health of the subject suffers in both cases, leaving a\r\npredisposition to disease.\r\n\r\nReasoning by analogy, these causes affecting the success or failure of\r\nplants give us the clue to the remedies for bacterial disease in man.\r\nDisease is the consequence and penalty of life under unnatural or\r\nunfavourable conditions, which should first receive attention and\r\nimprovement. When in spite of improved conditions disease persists,\r\nspecifics must be sought. The conditions which produce disease in the\r\nvegetable world are fought by the active principle of each plant, and\r\ninasmuch as the germ diseases of man are probably, though distantly,\r\nrelated to those which affect vegetable life, the specific protections\r\nof plants should be exploited for the treatment of human complaints.\r\nThis, of course, has for long been a practice, but possibly more\r\nsuccess might be achieved by careful research to identify each\r\ndistinct bacterial disease in man with its co-related distinct disease\r\nin plants, so as to utilize as a remedy for the former the natural\r\nprotection which the latter indicates.\r\n\r\nOur artificially evolved domesticated plants are more subject to\r\ndisease than their wild prototypes, because they are not natural\r\nsurvivals of the fittest. They are survivals only by virtue of the art\r\nof man, inducing special properties pleasing to man's senses, and\r\ntherefore profitable for sale; but in the development of some such\r\nspecial excellence, ability to elaborate protective defence is\r\ngenerally neglected, and the special excellence produced may possibly\r\nbe antagonistic to the really sound constitution of the plant. It is\r\nthus that cultivated plants are more in need of watchful care and\r\nattention than their wild relations, and that, in the development of\r\nquality, a sacrifice of quantity may be involved.\r\n\r\nThe observant hop grower notices constant changes in the appearance of\r\nhis plants from day to day under varying weather influences and other\r\nconditions: a retarded and unhappy expression in a cold, wet and rough\r\ntime; an eager and hopeful expansiveness under genial conditions; a\r\ndark, plethoric and rampant growth where too much nitrogen is\r\navailable, and a brilliant and healthily-restrained normality when\r\nproperly balanced nourishment is provided.\r\n\r\nThere should be sympathy between the grower and his plants, such as is\r\ndescribed by Blackmore in his _Christowell_; though in the following\r\npassage with consummate art he puts the words into the mouth of the\r\nsympathetic daughter of the amateur vine-grower, and gives the plant\r\nthe credit of the first advance:\r\n\r\n\"'For people to talk about \"sensitive plants,\"' she says, 'does seem\r\nsuch sad nonsense, when every plant that lives is sensitive. Just look\r\nat this holly-leafed baby vine, with every point cut like a prickle,\r\nyet much too tender and good to prick me. It follows every motion of\r\nmy hand; it crisps its little veinings up whenever I come near it; and\r\nit feels in every fibre that I am looking at it.'\"\r\n\r\nBlackmore was much more than a writer of fiction; I think he had a\r\ndeeper insight into the spirit of Nature and country character than\r\nperhaps any writer of modern times; he combined the accuracy of the\r\nscholar with the practical knowledge of the farmer and gardener; the\r\nlogic of the philosopher with the fancy and expression of the poet. I\r\nregard the appreciation of his _Lorna Doone_--a book in which one can\r\nsmell the violets--as the test of a real country lover; I mean a\r\ncountry lover who, besides the gift of acute observation, has the\r\ndeeper gift of imaginative perception. If only the book could have\r\nbeen illustrated by the pencil of Randolph Caldecott, such a union of\r\nsympathy between author and artist would have produced a work\r\nunparalleled in rural literature.\r\n\r\nLike all insects the aphis has its special insect enemies, among which\r\nthe lady-bird (\"lady-cow\" in Worcestershire) is the most important. It\r\nlays its eggs in clusters on the hop-leaf, and in a few days the larvæ\r\n(called \"niggers\") are hatched, aggressive-looking creatures with\r\ninsatiable appetites. It is amusing to watch them hunting over the\r\nlower side of the leaf like a sporting dog in a turnip field, and\r\ndevouring the lice in quantities. I knew an old hop grower in\r\nHampshire who had a standing offer of a guinea a quart for lady-birds,\r\nbut it is scarcely necessary to add that the reward was never claimed.\r\n\r\nThe hop is dioecious (producing male and female blossoms on separate\r\nplants), but very rarely both can be found on the same stem--the plant\r\nthus becoming monoecious. In 1893, a very hot dry year, several\r\nspecimens were found, including one in Kent, one in Surrey, one in\r\nHerefordshire, and one in my own hopyards at Aldington. It is curious\r\nthat the same unusual season should have produced the same abnormality\r\nin places so far apart, practically representing all the hop districts\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n     \"Till James's Day be past and gone,\r\n     You might grow hops or you might grow none.\"\r\n\r\nSt. James's Day is July 25, and so uncertain was the crop in the days\r\nbefore insecticides were in use, that the saying fairly represents the\r\nspecially speculative nature of the crop in former times. As an\r\ninstance of the effects of varying years I had the uncommon experience\r\nof picking two crops in twelve months: the first in a very late season\r\nwhen the picking did not commence till after Worcester hop-fair day,\r\nSeptember 19th, and the second the following year when picking was\r\nunusually early, and was completed before the fair day. At Farnham,\r\nwhere many of the tradespeople indulged in a little annual flutter as\r\nsmall hop growers, in addition to a more regular source of income from\r\ntheir respective trades, it was said that the first question on\r\nmeeting each other was not, \"How are you?\" but \"How are _they_?\"\r\n\r\nHop-picking is always somewhat reminiscent of the Saturnalia; with\r\nhundreds of strangers from distant villages and a few gipsies and\r\ntramps, it is not possible to enforce strict discipline, for it is\r\nvery necessary to keep the people in good-humour. On the final day of\r\nthe picking they expect to be allowed to indulge in a good deal of\r\nhorse-play, the great joke being suddenly to upset an unpopular\r\nindividual into a crib among the hops. Shrieks of laughter greet the\r\ndisappearance of the unlucky one, of whom nothing is to be seen except\r\na struggling leg protruding from the crib.\r\n\r\nThe last operation in the hop garden is stacking the poles, and\r\nburning the bine, a most inflammable material which makes a prodigious\r\nblaze. As the men watch the leaping flames the same remark is made\r\nyear after year--\"fire is a good servant, but a bad master.\" These\r\nfires seem a great waste of good fibrous matter, as in former times\r\nthe bine was utilized for making coarse sacking and brown paper.\r\nDuring the war I suggested to the National Salvage Council that, owing\r\nto the scarcity of both these articles, it might be worth while to\r\nattempt the resuscitation of the manufacture. The suggestion was\r\nfollowed by experiments which produced quite a useful brown paper of\r\nwhich I received a sample, but the cost of treatment was unfortunately\r\nprohibitive from the commercial point of view.\r\n\r\nWorcester hop fair is the start of the trade, and the market is held\r\nbehind the Hop-Pole Hotel, where there are spacious stores and offices\r\nfor the merchants. When the crop is bountiful the stores are filled to\r\noverflowing, and the ancient Guildhall built in 1721 has to be\r\nrequisitioned. On either side of the doorway stand the statues of\r\nCarolus I. and Carolus II., who must have watched the entrance and the\r\nexit of innumerable pockets. Worcester is distinguished as the\r\nFaithful City, for like the County it had small use for Cromwell and\r\nhis Roundheads; and to this day, on the date of the restoration of\r\nCharles II.--\"the twenty-ninth of May, oak apple day\"--a spray of oak\r\nor an oak-apple is in some villages worn as a badge of loyalty, the\r\npenalty for non-observance being a stroke on the hands with a\r\nstinging-nettle.\r\n\r\nIt was a great relief to get away from my 300 pickers and ride the\r\neighteen miles to Worcester on my bicycle, through the lovely river\r\nscenery of the Vale of Evesham, the hedges drooping beneath the weight\r\nof brilliant berries, the orchards loaded with apples, the clean\r\nbright stubbles, and the cattle in the lush aftermath; then, after a\r\nvisit to the busy hop-market and a stroll among the curio shops in New\r\nStreet, to return by a different road as the shadows were lengthening\r\nbeside the copses and the hedgerow timber trees.\r\n\r\nIn former times the October fair at Weyhill, near Andover, was the\r\nmarket for the Hampshire and Farnham hops; it was the custom for the\r\ngrowers to send them by road, and load back with cheese brought to the\r\nfair by the Wiltshire farmers. I heard of a Hampshire grower, who in a\r\nyear of great scarcity had spent some time trying to sell several\r\npockets to an anxious but reluctant buyer, unwilling to give the price\r\nasked--£20 a hundredweight. They continued the deal in the evening at\r\nthe inn at Andover, where both were staying, and said \"Good-night\"\r\nwithout having concluded the bargain. The grower was in bed and almost\r\nasleep when he heard a knock at his door, and a voice, \"Give you £18,\"\r\nwhich he refused. Next morning trade was dull and the buyer would not\r\nrepeat his offer, and at the end of the week the grower sent his hops\r\nhome again. Prices continued to fall, until two years later he sold\r\nthe same lot at 5s. a hundredweight to a cunning speculator, who took\r\nthem out to sea, after claiming a return of the duty (about £1 a\r\nhundredweight originally paid by the grower), which the Excise\r\nrefunded on _exported_ hops. The hops went overboard of course, and\r\nthe buyer netted the difference between the price he paid and the\r\namount received for the refunded duty.\r\n\r\nAt these old fairs the showmen and gipsies take large sums in the\r\n\"pleasure\" departments for admission to their exhibitions--swings,\r\nroundabouts, shooting-galleries, and coco-nut shies. In Evesham\r\nPost-Office a gipsy woman once asked me to write a letter; she handed\r\nme an order for £10, and instructed me to send it to a London firm for\r\n£5 worth of best coco-nuts and £5 worth of seconds. They were for use\r\non the shies; it struck me as a large supply, and the economical\r\ndivision of the qualities as ingenious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETEOROLOGY--ETON AND HARROW AT LORD'S--\"RUS IN URBE.\"\r\n\r\n     \"But if I praised the busy town,\r\n        He loved to rail against it still,\r\n        For 'ground in yonder social mill\r\n      We rub each other's angles down,\r\n\r\n     \"'And merge,' he said, 'in form and gloss\r\n        The picturesque of man and man.'\"\r\n                                       --_In Memoriam_.\r\n\r\nDuring the terribly wet summer of 1879 the following lines were\r\nwritten--it was said by the then Bishop of Wakefield--in the visitors'\r\nbook at the White Lion Hotel at Bala, in Wales:\r\n\r\n     \"The weather depends on the moon, as a rule,\r\n       And I've found that the saying is true;\r\n     For at Bala it rains when the moon's at the full,\r\n       And it rains when the moon's at the new.\r\n\r\n     \"When the moon's at the quarter, then down comes the rain;\r\n       At the half it's no better I ween;\r\n     When the moon's at three-quarters it's at it again,\r\n       And it rains besides mostly between.\"\r\n\r\nRather hard on Bala, for the summer was so abnormally wet that these\r\nlines would have been true of any part of England. I suppose everybody\r\nis more or less interested in the weather, but the custom of alluding\r\nto the obvious, as an opening to conversation, is probably a survival\r\nfrom the time when everyone was directly interested in its effect upon\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nNothing proves how completely town interests now dominate those of the\r\ncountry so much as the innovation called \"summer time.\" During the war\r\nit was no doubt a boon to allotment holders, and of course it gives a\r\nlonger evening to those employed all day indoors; but it inflicts\r\ndirect loss on the farmer, who is practically forced to adopt it in\r\norder to supply the towns with produce in time for their altered\r\nhabits. The farmer exchanges the last hour of the normal day, one of\r\nthe most valuable in the old working time, for the first hour of the\r\nnew day, one of the most useless, for owing to the dew which the sun\r\nhas not had time to dry up, many agricultural operations cannot be\r\nproperly performed or even commenced--hay-making and corn-hoeing for\r\ninstance are impossible. We may be sure that the former times of\r\nbeginning and ending farm-work, which I suppose had been customary for\r\nat least 2,000 years in England, did not receive the sanction of such\r\na period without good reason, and it seems to me, that so far as\r\noutdoor work is concerned the new arrangement savours of \"teaching our\r\ngrandmothers to suck eggs.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a saving of lighting requirements, no doubt, but in such a\r\nsix weeks of winterly mornings as we had, following the commencement\r\nof \"summer time\" this first year of peace, there is a considerable\r\nincrease in the consumption of fuel. Wherever possible, I suppose,\r\nmost houses are built to face the south, and the breakfast-room would\r\nbe generally on that side, so that by 9 o'clock, old time, the sun had\r\nwarmed the room, but at 9 o'clock, new time, the sun has scarcely\r\nlooked in at the window; a fire is probably lighted and to save\r\ntrouble kept up all day. If the new arrangement is continued, and I\r\nunderstand that it was tried more than 100 years ago and abandoned as\r\na mistake, it would be much better to begin it at least a month later.\r\nOur present May Day is nearly a fortnight earlier than before the New\r\nStyle was introduced, which is the reason why old traditions of May\r\nDay merry-makings appear unseasonable; and probably the promoters of\r\nsummer time have not heard of \"blackthorn winter\" and \"whitethorn\r\nwinter,\" which, in the country, we experience regularly every year in\r\nApril and May.\r\n\r\n     \"When the grass grows in Janiveer\r\n     It grows the worse for it all the year,\"\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n     \"If Candlemas-Day be fine and fair\r\n     The half of winter's to come and mair;\r\n     If Candlemas-Day be wet and foul\r\n     The half of winter was gone at Yule,\"\r\n\r\nare both rhymes suggesting the probability of wintry weather to\r\nfollow, if the early weeks of the year are mild and unseasonable, and\r\nthey may be considered as generally correct prognostications. A\r\nneighbouring village had the distinction of possessing a weather\r\nprophet, with the reputation also of an astrologer; he could be seen\r\nwhen the stars were gleaming brightly, late at night, gazing upwards\r\nand making his deductions, though, in reality, I fancy, his\r\ninspiration came from the study of almanacs which profess to foretell\r\nthe future. He was quiet and reserved, with a spare figure, dark\r\ncomplexion, and an abstracted expression. Occasionally I could induce\r\nhim to talk, but he did not like to be \"drawn.\" He told me, as one of\r\nhis original conceptions, that he thought the good people were\r\naccommodated in the after-life within the limits of the stars of good\r\ninfluence, and that the wicked had to be content with those of an\r\nopposite character.\r\n\r\nThe proverb about March dust, and \"A dry March and a dry May for old\r\nEngland,\" are both apposite, for they are busy months on the land, and\r\na wet March amounts to a national disaster; but everyone forgives\r\nApril when showery, for we all know that \"April showers bring forth\r\nMay flowers.\" Shakespeare, too, says:\r\n\r\n     \"When daffodils begin to peer,\r\n        With heigh! the doxy over the dale,\r\n     Why, then comes in the sweet of the year.\"\r\n\r\nA charming sentiment and charmingly rendered, but possibly more\r\naccurate when the Old Style was in vogue, and the seasons were nearly\r\na fortnight later than now. The modern \"daffys\" too, no doubt, \"begin\r\nto peer\" somewhat earlier than those of the reign of Queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nDuring a very hot summer I suggested to the Board of Agriculture that\r\nit might be worth while to experiment with explosions of artillery,\r\nwith a view of inducing the clouds to discharge the rain they\r\nevidently contain when they keep passing day after day without\r\nbursting. I had seen it stated that many great battles had ended in\r\ntremendous downpours, and that it was believed that the rain was\r\ncaused by concussion from the explosions. The Board replied, however,\r\nthat experiments had been conducted in America for the purpose,\r\nwithout in any way substantiating the theory; and the experiences of\r\nthe Great War have since conclusively proved that it has no\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nAs to weather signs, I have already quoted the original pronouncement\r\nof my carpenter, T.G., that \"the indications for rain are very similar\r\nto the indications for fine weather,\" and there is a good deal in his\r\nwords. My own conclusion, after fifty years of out-door life on the\r\nfarm, in the woods, in the garden, at out-door games, and on the\r\nroads, is that fine weather brings fine weather, and wet weather\r\nbrings wet weather, in other words, it never rains but it pours, in an\r\nextended sense.\r\n\r\nMy impression is that when the ground is dry there is a minimum of\r\ncapillary attraction between it and the clouds, and though the sky may\r\nlook threatening they do not easily break into rain. On the other\r\nhand, when the ground is thoroughly wet and evaporation is active,\r\ncapillary attraction tends to unite earth and clouds, and rain\r\nresults. We all know that hill-tops receive showers which frequently\r\npass over the vales without falling, probably because of the greater\r\nproximity of the hills. In a long drought a violent thunderstorm,\r\nwhich soaks the ground, will often be followed by a complete change of\r\nweather, as the result of contact established between the earth and\r\nthe clouds.\r\n\r\nThe best description I know of a really hot and cloudless day is that\r\nby Coleridge in the _Ancient Mariner_:\r\n\r\n     \"The sun came up upon the left,\r\n     Out of the sea came he;\r\n     And he shone bright, and on the right\r\n     Went down into the sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe succession of monosyllables expresses most forcibly the monotony\r\nof a day of blazing sunshine, unruffled by a cloud; and the absence of\r\nincident illustrates the remorseless march of the dominant sun across\r\nthe heavens.\r\n\r\nVery little of my time has been spent in London or any other town, and\r\nmy early recollections of passing through London on my way to or from\r\nschool after or before the holidays are of very depressing weather\r\nconditions--fog, greasy streets and pavements, or a sun veiled in a\r\nhaze of smoky vapour. Even when I went to Lord's annually in July to\r\nsee the Eton and Harrow match my recollection of the weather is of\r\ndull, sultry heat and oppression of spirits. Cricket never seemed the\r\nsame game as I knew and loved at Harrow, or in my own home in Surrey;\r\nthere was an unreality about it, and a black coat and top hat were\r\ninsufferably uncongenial.\r\n\r\nI am able, as an eye-witness on one of these occasions, to write of an\r\nincident which, I think, has been almost forgotten. It was within a\r\nyear of the marriage of King Edward, then Prince of Wales, and Queen\r\nAlexandra. A ball had been hit almost to the boundary, but was stopped\r\nby a spectator close to the ropes, thrown in to the fielder, and\r\nsmartly returned to the wicket-keeper. The batsmen took it for granted\r\nthat it was a boundary hit, and were changing ends when, one man being\r\nout of his ground, the wicket was put down, the wicket-keeper not\r\nrecognizing that the ball was \"dead.\" The umpire gave the man \"out.\"\r\nThe man demurred, and immediately shouts arose on all sides: \"Out!\"\r\n\"Not out!\" \"Out!\" \"Not out!\" \"Out!\" \"Not out!\" rising _in crescendo_\r\nto a pitch of intense excitement. The boys watching the match, and the\r\nother spectators, some agreeing with, and some disputing the verdict,\r\nrushed into the centre of the ground, and completely blocked the open\r\nspace still shouting vociferously. When the turmoil was at its height\r\nthe carriage of the Prince and Princess was driven on to the ground;\r\none of the players rushed up excitedly, and asked the Prince to decide\r\nthe matter. The Prince had not seen the incident, and of course\r\ndeclined, as no doubt he would have done under any circumstances, to\r\ngive an opinion. It was impossible to clear the ground and continue\r\nthe play that evening, and stumps were drawn for the day. Next morning\r\nthe fielding side offered the disgusted batsman to continue his\r\ninnings, but he decided to play the game and abide by the umpire's\r\ndecision. I forget whether Eton or Harrow was in the field at the\r\ntime, and after this lapse of years it does not matter. The headmaster\r\nalways sent a notice round, just before the match, to be read to every\r\nform, that the boys were desired not to indulge in any \"ironical\r\ncheering\" at Lord's; this was his euphemism for what we called\r\n\"chaff,\" and I fear that on this occasion the warning was disregarded\r\neven more completely than usual.\r\n\r\nAs a child, I generally paid a visit to London with my brothers and\r\nsisters during the Christmas holidays to see a pantomime, and I\r\nremember an occasion when returning from Covent Garden Theatre after a\r\nmatinee we all--nine of us--walked over Waterloo Bridge and paid nine\r\nhalfpennies toll--a circumstance that had never happened before, and\r\nnever happened again.\r\n\r\nIn the days before the railway was made between Alton and Farnham the\r\nold bailiff on the Will Hall Farm at Alton, who, though quite an\r\nelderly man, had never visited London, expressed a wish to visit it\r\nfor once in his life. His master gave him a holiday and paid his\r\nexpenses, and the old man drove the ten miles to Farnham Station.\r\nArrived in London he started to walk over Waterloo Bridge, but the\r\nfurther he got the more astonished he became at the traffic, and began\r\nto wonder what \"fair\" all the people could be going to. Feeling very\r\nmuch out of his element he reached the Strand, and looking up and down\r\nhe saw still greater crowds of passengers and the unending procession\r\nof 'buses, cabs, and vans. He became so confused and alarmed that he\r\nturned round, went straight back to Waterloo Station, and left by the\r\nfirst available train. He came home disgusted with London, and in an\r\naccount of the traffic and the people, ended by saying, \"I never saw\r\nsuch a place in my life; I couldn't even get a bit of anything to eat\r\nuntil I got back to Farnham.\" This old man was called \"the Great\r\nWestern\": I suppose his bulk and commanding figure were reminiscent of\r\nthe power and energy of one of the locomotives on that line. He wore a\r\nvery wide-brimmed straw hat, and a vast expanse of waistcoat with\r\nsleeves, without a coat over it, and he had a very determined and\r\nmasterful habit of speech. Caldecott's sketch of Ready-Money Jack in\r\n_Bracebridge Hall_ always recalls him to my mind. He must have been\r\nborn before the opening of the nineteenth century, for he could\r\nremember the stirring events of its early years. Any remark about\r\nunusual weather made in his hearing was at once put out of court by\r\nhis recollections of \"eiteen-eiteen\" (1818), which seems to have been\r\na very remarkable year for maxima and minima of meteorology. He could\r\nremember the high price of wheat during the war which ended at\r\nWaterloo, and how his old master, the grandfather of the tenant of the\r\nfarm in my time, would stand by the men in the barn as they measured\r\nup the wheat, bushel by bushel, to fill the sacks, and exclaim as each\r\nbushel was poured in, \"There goes another guinea, boys!\" This would\r\nmake the price 168s. a quarter; I find the average recorded for 1812\r\nwas 126s. 6d., so that it is quite possible that for a time in that\r\nyear in places 168s. was realized; which leaves us little to grumble\r\nat in the price of 80s. during the greatest war in history.\r\n\r\nHis horizon must have been considerably widened by his brief visit to\r\nLondon; previous to that event it might have been nearly as extensive\r\nas that of the hero of a recent story of Pwllheli. Meeting a crony in\r\nthe town, he remarked that the streets of London would be pretty\r\ncrowded that day. \"How's that?\" said his friend. \"Why, there's a trip\r\ntrain gone up to-day with fourteen people from Pwllheli!\"\r\n\r\nBredon Hill, in the Vale of Evesham, is the direction in which many\r\npeople look for hints of coming changes of weather.\r\n\r\n     \"When Bredon Hill puts on his cap\r\n     Ye men of the vale beware of that\"\r\n\r\nis a well-known proverb referring to the dark curtain of rain clouds\r\nobscuring the top, which is generally followed by heavy rain and\r\nfloods in the Avon meadows and those of all the little streams which\r\njoin that river. The same purple curtain can be seen on the Cotswolds\r\nabove Broadway, and is likewise the forerunner of floods in the Vale:\r\n\r\n     \"When you see the rain on the hills\r\n     You'll shortly find it down by the mills.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, too, the beautiful blue hazy distance one sees in very fine\r\nweather, which gives a feeling of mystery and remoteness and\r\nunexplored possibilities. I lately read somewhere of a man who had\r\npassed his life without leaving his native village, though he had\r\noften looked far away into the blue distance, and longed to start upon\r\na journey of discovery; for its invitation seemed an assurance that in\r\nsuch beauty there must be something better than he had ever\r\nexperienced in his own home. There came a day when the appeal was so\r\ninsistent that he braced himself to the effort, and after many weary\r\nmiles reached the place of his dreams, only to find that the blue\r\ndistance had disappeared. Meeting a passer-by he told him of his\r\njourney and its object, and of his disappointment, \"Look behind you,\"\r\nwas the reply. He looked, and behold! over the very spot he had left\r\nin the morning--over his own home--the blue haze hung, as a veil of\r\nbeauty, with its exquisite promise. There is a moral and there is\r\ncomfort in this tale for him who fancies that he is the victim of\r\ncircumstances and surroundings. That is the man who, as my bailiff\r\nused to say in harvest, has always got a heavier cut of wheat than his\r\nneighbour in the same field, and is always finding himself \"at the\r\nwrong job.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGING COURSE OF STREAMS--DEWPONDS--A WET HARVEST--WEATHER\r\nPHENOMENA--WILL-O'-THE-WISP--VARIOUS.\r\n\r\n     \"There rolls the deep where grew the tree.\r\n     O Earth, what changes hast thou seen!\"\r\n                                          --_In Memoriam_.\r\n\r\n     \"With many a curve my banks I fret\r\n        By many a field and fallow,\r\n     And many a fairy foreland set\r\n        With willow-weed and mallow.\r\n\r\n     \"I chatter, chatter, as I flow\r\n        To join the brimming river,\r\n     For men may come and men may go,\r\n       But I go on for ever.\"\r\n                               _The Brook_.\r\n\r\nLiving so many years in one place I had unusual opportunities, as my\r\nrounds nearly always took me beside my brooks, of watching their\r\nslowly changing courses. The roots of the pollard willows helped to\r\nkeep them to their regular path by holding up the banks, but sometimes\r\nwhen an old tree fell into the water it had an opposite result. A\r\nfallen tree, reaching partly across the stream, has the immediate\r\neffect of damming the flow of the water on the side of its growth and\r\ndiverting the current towards the opposite bank in a narrowed but more\r\npowerful advance, so that the bank is worn away and the beginning of a\r\nbend is formed. As the breach increases, the water, momentarily\r\nretarded there by the new concavity, rushes forward again in the\r\ndirection of the bank from which the tree fell. So that a second\r\nconcavity is produced on that side some little way below the tree,\r\nresulting in the slow formation of an extended S-like figure, or hook\r\nwith a double bend. The collection of rubbish and sediment retained by\r\nthe fallen tree helps to form a new bank on that side, extending\r\nfurther into the stream than the bank on which the tree originally\r\nstood.\r\n\r\nAs this process continues it is easy to see that a straight stretch of\r\nstream will in time assume a winding course, and the stream will be\r\ncontinually altering its path, so that large areas of flat meadows\r\nwill be formed, every part of which has at times been the stream's\r\ncourse. How many ages, then, must it have taken to produce the level\r\nmeadows we see extending for immense distances on either side of our\r\nbig rivers, and even those adjoining quite small streams? The level\r\nsurface thus created by the river or brook's course perpetually\r\ndeflected and reflected, is finally completed by the floods bringing\r\ndown a deposit of soil in solution, which is precipitated and settles\r\ninto any surface irregularities left by the wanderings of the stream.\r\nA faint conception of an absolutely illimitable cycle of years, during\r\nwhich the whole extent of visible flat meadow has been again and again\r\neroded and restored, is thus conveyed.\r\n\r\nConfirmation of this alteration of their courses by streams is\r\nafforded when we cut a main drain through one of these meadows, to\r\ncarry the water from the connected furrow drains of adjoining arable\r\nland. The alluvial soil can be found as deep as the depth of the\r\npresent brook, free from the stones found in the arable land, and\r\ncontaining, to the same depth as the brook, fresh water shells similar\r\nto those in the brook to-day. There was a bend in course of formation\r\nin one of my brooks, where the stump of a tree, whose fall was the\r\nstarting-point, could be seen standing in the newly-formed ground, a\r\nyard or more from the stream when I left, though I can remember when\r\nit was so near as almost to touch the water.\r\n\r\nIf we form an S from a piece of wire, and pinch it together from top\r\nto bottom, the loops become so flattened, [S], that one of them may\r\nalmost unite with the central curve. The same thing often happens in\r\nthe loops of a brook, and, in time, the stream will complete the\r\njunction, forming a short circuit.[2] Thus an island may be formed; or\r\nwhen the old loop opposite the short circuit gets filled up with\r\ndeposit or falling banks--the water preferring the short circuit--a\r\npiece of land may be cut off from one of the former sides of the brook\r\nand transferred to the other, so that where the brook is a boundary\r\nbetween two owners or parishes one owner or parish may be robbed and\r\nthe other owner or parish becomes a receiver of stolen goods. There\r\nwas an instance of this on the farm I owned and occupied adjoining the\r\nAldington Manor property, and the owner and the tenant of the piece\r\ntransferred to my side could not reach it without walking through the\r\nbrook. In this case, however, the tenant had wisely planted the ground\r\nwith withies, which he managed to get at for lopping when its turn\r\ncame round every seven years. Thus we have an example of the necessity\r\nof the ancient practice of beating the bounds, which, at least before\r\nthe days of ordnance surveys, was not merely an opportunity for a\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\nAnother proof of the creation of new land by the meanderings of a\r\nstream is found in the ancient \"carrs\" of North Lincolnshire, near\r\nBrigg, where the hollowed-out logs of black bog oak, which formed the\r\ncanoes of the ancient inhabitants, are sometimes discovered many feet\r\nbelow the surface, and long distances from the present course of the\r\nAncholme. These having sunk to the bottom of the river in past ages,\r\nand gradually become covered with alluvium, were left behind as the\r\nriver changed its course. In some cases however these canoes may have\r\nsunk to the bottom of the water when it formed a lake, and the lake\r\nhaving gradually silted up, the river receded to something like its\r\npresent width.\r\n\r\nThe floods in the Vale of Evesham from the Avon and even from my\r\nbrooks, often converted the adjoining flat meadows into lakes, and\r\nthey rose so suddenly after heavy rains or the melting of deep\r\nsnowfalls on the hills, that they were attended with danger to the\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1879 one of these sudden floods occurred, and people\r\nstanding on Evesham bridge, saw fallen trees and hay-cocks floating\r\ndown the stream. A pollard willow was noticed with a crew of about\r\ntwenty land rats, which had found refuge there until the tree itself\r\nwas lifted by the rising water and carried down the stream; and a\r\nfloating hay-cock supported a man's jacket, his jar of cider, and his\r\n\"shuppick.\" The local word \"shuppick,\" a corruption of \"sheaf-pike,\"\r\nmeans a pike used for loading the sheaves of wheat in the harvest\r\nfield on to the waggon, and is the \"fork\" in general use at\r\nhay-making. During another summer flood the whole of the pleasure\r\nground at Evesham, beside the Avon, was under water several feet deep;\r\nthe water poured in at the lower windows of the adjoining hotel, and\r\nthe proprietor's casks of beer and cider in the cellars, ready for the\r\nregatta, were lifted from their stands and bumped against walls and\r\nceilings.\r\n\r\nEvery parish has its Council in these days, and in country places\r\nalmost every other person one meets is a councillor of some sort, and\r\ninclined to be proud of the distinction. These Councils are excellent\r\nsafety-valves for parochial malcontents who thus harmlessly let off\r\nsuperfluous steam which might otherwise ruffle the abiding calm of\r\npeaceful inhabitants, but their powers are really very limited. In a\r\nvillage in Worcestershire where an approach road crossed a brook by a\r\nford, during floods the current was sometimes so strong as to\r\nconstitute a danger to horses and carts. The village pundits\r\ntherefore, in council duly assembled, considered the matter, and after\r\nan extended debate the following resolution was carried unanimously,\r\n\"That a notice board be erected on the spot bearing the inscription:\r\nWhen this board _is covered with water_ it is dangerous to attempt to\r\ncross the ford.\"\r\n\r\nThe numerous brooks in the Vale of Evesham supply ample water for the\r\nstock, but in more elevated parts, especially on the chalk Downs of\r\nSussex, Hants, Wilts, and Dorset, provision is made for an artificial\r\nwater supply by what are called \"dewponds.\" A shallow saucer-shaped\r\ndepression is dug out on the open Down, the bottom being made\r\nwater-tight by puddling with a well-rammed layer of impervious clay.\r\nThe first heavy rainfall fills the pond, and, the water being colder\r\nthan the air, the dew or mist condenses on its surface sufficiently,\r\nin ordinary weather, to maintain the supply. In a dry time the sheep\r\ncan always reach the water, the pond having no banks, by the shelving\r\nformation of the bottom. Sometimes a few trees are allowed to grow\r\nround it; they also act as condensers, and their drip helps to fill\r\nthe pond. It is only in an abnormal drought that these dewponds really\r\nfail, and a thunderstorm, followed by ordinary weather, will soon\r\nrefill them. Gilbert White, in _The Natural History of Selborne_,\r\nrefers to these ponds in a very interesting letter on the subject,\r\nincluding details of condensation by trees, in which he gives an\r\ninstance of a particular pond, high up on the Down, 300 feet above his\r\nhouse, and situated in such a position that it was impossible for it\r\nto receive any water from springs or drainage, which \"though never\r\nabove three feet deep in the middle, and not more than thirty feet in\r\ndiameter, and containing, perhaps, not more than two or three hundred\r\nhogsheads of water, yet never is known to fail, though it affords\r\ndrink for three hundred or four hundred sheep, and for at least twenty\r\nhead of large cattle besides.\"\r\n\r\nThe natural well-water in the Vale of Evesham is exceedingly hard, and\r\nin the town and some villages was formerly much contaminated. After\r\ngreat opposition from obstructive ratepayers, a splendid supply was\r\nobtained from the Cotswolds above Broadway, about six miles away, of\r\nmuch softer and really pure spring water. It comes in pipes by\r\ngravitation, so there is no expense of pumping; but it was difficult\r\nto get recalcitrant ratepayers to lay the water on from the mains to\r\ntheir houses, as that part of the cost had to be borne by them\r\nindividually; and, before compulsion could be resorted to, the Council\r\nhad to prove contamination of the wells and close them. To get the\r\nevidence samples were submitted to a London analyst, and they were\r\ninvariably condemned. One of the Councillors suggested sending, with a\r\nnumber of well samples, a sample of the new supply \"for a fad.\" The\r\nsamples were numbered, but had no other distinguishing mark, and in\r\ndue course the usual condemnations were received, including that of\r\nthe new town supply!\r\n\r\nDuring the wet harvest of 1879, when what was called by townspeople\r\nthe agricultural depression, was becoming acute, it was impossible to\r\nget a whole day on which wheat could be carried. The position was\r\nserious, because the grain was sprouting in the sheaves in the field,\r\nand time after time a fairly dry Saturday would have allowed carrying\r\nthe following day, though Monday was always as wet as ever. At last at\r\nAldington we faced the situation and decided to proceed with the work\r\nwhenever possible, Sunday or no Sunday. A fine drying Saturday\r\noccurred, and my bailiff told the men what we proposed, adding that we\r\ndid not wish anyone to help who had scruples as to the day. They all\r\nappeared on Sunday morning, a brilliant day, except one \"conscientious\r\nobjector,\" who, as I heard later, spent most of the day at the\r\npublic-house. We got up two ricks from about ten acres, which\r\neventually proved to be some of the driest wheat we had that year, and\r\nwhich I was able to sell for seed at a good price, to go into\r\ndistricts where no dry seed wheat could be found.\r\n\r\nMy old vicar was somewhat scandalized at this Sunday work, and some of\r\nmy neighbours fancied themselves shocked, but a day or two later I\r\nhappened to meet another clergyman friend, who farmed a little\r\nhimself. \"I was _so_ pleased,\" he said, \"to hear that you were\r\ncarrying wheat last Sunday; when I was preaching I was strongly\r\ndisposed to conclude by telling my people--'Now you have been to\r\nchurch, go home to your dinners, and then off with your jackets and\r\ncarry wheat for the rest of the day.'\" Next Sunday all my neighbours\r\nwere busy with their wheat, but I had managed to complete my harvest\r\nduring the previous week, on the 8th of October, quite a month or six\r\nweeks later than usual, and an extraordinary contrast to the very dry\r\nyear 1868, when all the corn on the farm, I was told, was carried\r\nbefore the last day of July.\r\n\r\nI attended a neighbour's sale that autumn; the wet seasons and the low\r\nprices had been too much for him, and he was leaving for the United\r\nStates; his rick-yard was empty, all the corn sold, and nothing but\r\nstraw left. I heard him remark, \"Folks are saying that I'm very\r\nbackward with my payments, but I'm very forward with my thrashing,\r\nanyway!\" Before the following spring nearly all the rick-yards were\r\nempty, and wheat-ricks, it was said, were as scarce as churches--one\r\nin each parish. The situation was summed up later in a phrase which\r\npassed into a proverb: \"In 1879 farmers lived on faith, in 1880 they\r\nare living on hope, and in 1881 they will have to live on charity.\"\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the towns was one of apathy and indifference, like\r\nthat of the General in _Bracebridge Hall_, which, published in 1822,\r\nproves how history repeats itself in agricultural as in other matters:\r\n\r\n\"He is amazingly well-contented with the present state of things, and\r\napt to get a little impatient at any talk about national ruin and\r\nagricultural distress. 'They talk of public distress,' said the\r\nGeneral this day to me at dinner, as he smacked a glass of rich\r\nburgundy and cast his eyes about the ample board: 'They talk of public\r\ndistress, but where do we find it, sir? I see none; I see no reason\r\nanyone has to complain. Take my word for it, sir, this talk about\r\npublic distress is all humbug!'\"\r\n\r\nAt Evesham, long before the depression grew into a debacle, the\r\nshadows of coming events could easily be detected. There was the\r\ndisappearance of the long rows of farmers' conveyances at the inns in\r\nthe town on market-days; there was the eclipse of shops--for other\r\nthan necessities--such as a little fish shop, opposite the corner at\r\nthe cross roads; a corner where much business was formerly transacted\r\nin the open street, and where I myself have sold by sample some\r\nthousands of sacks of wheat. A tempting little shop it used to be,\r\ndisplaying shining Severn salmon; and it was here that the farmers,\r\nafter the market, obtained the supplies commanded by the missus at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAnd there was the abandonment of the Corn Market proper, for the class\r\nof farmers who survived hated to transact their business indoors. The\r\nattendance of millers and dealers, except of those who had cargoes of\r\nforeign corn at Gloucester or Bristol to dispose of, became irregular.\r\nSales of farm stock and implements took place in every village on\r\nfarms which had passed from father to son for generations, coupled\r\nwith the sacrifice of valuable implements and machinery for want of\r\nbuyers. There followed the stage when landowners who could find no\r\ntenants, and had heavily mortgaged estates, essayed to make the best\r\nof them by laying away the arable land to pasture, undertaking the\r\nmanagement themselves with, perhaps, an old broken-down tenant as\r\nbailiff. The politicians and the general public did not apprehend the\r\ndanger of the situation, in spite of innumerable warnings, until the\r\nGerman submarines were sending our foreign food supplies to the bottom\r\nof the sea; and now that the immediate danger of starvation has\r\npassed, they appear already to have lapsed again into an attitude of\r\napathy.\r\n\r\nWe hear the blessed word \"reconstruction\" on every side, but the only\r\nofficial propositions for the permanent establishment of agricultural\r\nprosperity that I have heard are utterly inadequate. It is ridiculous\r\nto suppose that a few thousand acres of special crops, like tobacco,\r\nfor instance, only possible in favoured spots, can in any way\r\ncompensate for the loss of millions of acres of arable land under\r\nrotations of corn and green crops. Under present conditions nothing is\r\nmore certain than the abandonment of arable land as such; and it is\r\nfolly to talk of novel systems of transport for a dwindling output, or\r\nof building labourers' cottages at an unjustifiable cost, which are\r\nnever likely to be wanted by a dying industry.\r\n\r\nAmong my experiences of abnormal weather, I have a note of a\r\nremarkable summer flood on July 21, 1875, when my hay was lying in the\r\nmeadows beside the brooks, and had to be removed to higher ground in\r\npouring rain to prevent its disappearance with the current. On the\r\nfollowing day, July 22, the highest flood since 1845 occurred at\r\nEvesham.\r\n\r\nOctober 14, 1877, was memorable for the most terrific south-west gale\r\nthat happened in all the years I passed at Aldington; thirteen trees,\r\nmostly old apple trees and elms, were blown down, including the\r\nsplendid veteran \"Chate boy\" pear tree at Blackminster, an exceedingly\r\nsad and irreparable loss. The gale blew hardest in special tracks, the\r\ncourse of which could be followed by the destruction of trees and\r\nbranches in distinct lanes, cut through woods and plantations.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1880-1881 was very severe, the mean temperature of\r\nJanuary, 1881, being 27.8 degrees F., the coldest January since 1820.\r\nTen years later, 1890-1891, another very prolonged winter occurred:\r\nthe frost began on the 6th of December, and, with scarcely a break,\r\ncontinued till well into February. The feature of this frost was the\r\nfine settled weather, and the warmth of the midday sun in the\r\nbrilliant air, when skaters could sit on the river banks and enjoy\r\ntheir rest and lunch in its rays. I took my elder daughter back to\r\nschool at Richmond at the end of January, and in London we saw the\r\nThames choked by huge hummocks of ice, on which people were crossing\r\nthe river. An ox was roasted whole on the Avon at Evesham, and, when\r\nthe frost broke up, the ice on our millpond was 17 inches thick.\r\n\r\nAnother great frost happened in 1894-1895, beginning late in December,\r\nand lasting till the end of February, with a single intervening week\r\nof thaw; and in March the ground, in places, was too hard to plough.\r\nIt was the only time that I was completely at a loss to find work for\r\nmy men; all the carting was finished in the early days of the frost,\r\nand all the thrashing possible followed; ploughing and all working of\r\nthe land, or draining, were impracticable. The men, seeing that there\r\nwould be no employment for them until the frost broke up, told me that\r\nif they might get what wood they could from fallen trees in the brook,\r\nand if I would lend them horses and carts to get it home, they would\r\nbe glad to work in that way for themselves for a time. Just as they\r\nhad cleared both brooks from end to end of the farm which occupied\r\nthem about ten days, the thaw came and I was able to find them plenty\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nWe suffered very little from droughts at Aldington, the land was\r\nnaturally so retentive of moisture, but 1893 was a dry year, not\r\neasily forgotten; no rain fell from early in March to July 13; the hay\r\ncrop was the lightest in remembrance, and straw was so short and\r\nscarce that the hay-ricks of the following year, 1894, had to go\r\nunthatched until the harvest of that year provided the necessary\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1895 was remarkable for a plague of the caterpillars of\r\nthe winter-moth, due to the destruction of insect-eating birds by the\r\ngreat frost; the caterpillars devoured the young leaves of the\r\nplum-trees, so that whole orchards were completely stripped. The\r\nbalance between insectivorous birds and caterpillar life was destroyed\r\nfor a time, and the caterpillars conquered the plum-trees. In 1917,\r\nduring the persistent north-east blasts of February, March, and part\r\nof April, the destruction of birds was terrible; all the tit tribe\r\nsuffered greatly, and the charming little golden-crested wren, which\r\nhere in the Forest was quite common, has scarcely been seen since.\r\nCaterpillars again were a plague in my apple trees that spring, but\r\nwere not really destructive, and in the autumn the apples escaped\r\ntheir usual punishment from the birds and wasps. Tits are often very\r\ntroublesome; they peck holes in the fruit, apparently in search of the\r\nlarvae of the codlin moth, leaving an opening for wasps and flies. I\r\nfind the berries of the laurel, which is a species of cherry, very\r\nattractive to blackbirds, and as long as there are any left they seem\r\nto prefer them to the apples. In 1895 cuckoos came to the rescue of my\r\nyoung plum orchard; there were dozens of them at work on the nine\r\nacres at once, and they must have cleared away an immense number of\r\nthe grubs.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable season we have had since I left Aldington was the\r\ngreat drought of 1911. There was no rain here worth mention from June\r\n22, the Coronation of King George V., until August 30, and the\r\npastures on this thin land were burnt up. On August 30 we had some\r\nfriends for tennis, and we had not been playing long before a mighty\r\ncloud-burst occurred; the rain fell in torrents. \"It didn't stop to\r\nrain, it tumbled down,\" as my men used to say, and in about half an\r\nhour the lawn was a sheet of water, the ground being so hard, that it\r\ncould not soak away. It was all over in an hour, and a neighbour with\r\na rain-gauge registered 0.66 of an inch of rain, equal to 66 tons on\r\nan acre, or 330 tons on my five acres.\r\n\r\nOne of my ambitions has always been to see a Will-o'-the-wisp, and I\r\nam still hoping; but that hot summer, had I known it at the time, they\r\nwere quite common within an easy walk of my house in the New Forest.\r\nThere was some correspondence on the subject in _The Observer_, and\r\nthe following is extracted from one of the letters:\r\n\r\n\"As none of your correspondents seem to be aware of a comparatively\r\nrecent instance, I write to say that there were enough indubitable\r\nWill-o'-the-wisps to convince the most incredulous during the\r\nextremely hot weather of July, 1911.\r\n\r\n\"From July 18 to 22 I was at Thorney Hill in the New Forest, some\r\nseven miles behind Christchurch. Owing to the abnormal drought the\r\nbogs and bog-streams at the foot of the hill westward were all but\r\ndry; a dense mist, however, sometimes rose from them at night. On July\r\n19, and the three following nights, the Will-o'-the-wisps were in\r\ngreat form over the bog. They were like small balls of bluish fire,\r\nwhich projected themselves with hops and jerks across the most\r\ninaccessible parts of the bog, starting always, so far as could be\r\ntold, from where a little stagnant moisture still remained. They moved\r\nwith an erratic velocity, so to speak, appearing and reappearing at\r\ndistances of several hundred yards. There wasn't the slightest doubt\r\nof their authenticity.\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants of Thorney Hill, I believe, regarded these\r\nappearances with alarm, as being, though not exactly novelties,\r\nharbingers of much misfortune. But the drought was quite bad enough,\r\nwithout having the Jack-o'-lanterns to accentuate it!\"\r\n\r\nThis instance was the more remarkable as I have never succeeded in\r\nfinding anyone, even among people who are constantly on duty in the\r\nForest, who could testify to having seen a Will-o'-the-wisp.\r\n\r\nWaterspouts are, I believe, more frequently seen at sea than on land,\r\nbut I have an account from my brother, Mr. F.E. Savory, of one he saw\r\nmany years ago in Wiltshire. He writes:\r\n\r\n\"When I was at Manningford Bruce in 1873 or 1874, I saw a dense black\r\ncloud travelling towards the southeast, the lower part of which became\r\npointed like a funnel in shape, waving about as it descended until, I\r\nsuppose, the attraction of the earth overcame the cohesion of the\r\ncloud's vapour, and it discharged itself. I could see it looking\r\nlighter and lighter, from the middle outwards, until it was entirely\r\ndispersed. I heard that the water fell on the side of the Down near\r\nCollingbourne, about five miles off, and washed some of the soil away,\r\nbut I did not see that. The weather was stormy, but I do not remember\r\nthe time of year or any other particulars.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem that a waterspout is caused by a whirlwind entering a\r\ncloud and gathering vapour together by its rotary action into such a\r\nheavy mass that it descends in the funnel shape described. We are all\r\nfamiliar with the small whirlwinds that travel across a road in\r\nsummer, carrying the dust round and round with them; these are called\r\n\"whirly-curlies\" in Worcestershire, and are regarded as a sign of fine\r\nweather. I have sometimes seen quite a strong one crossing rows of hay\r\njust ready to carry, cutting a clean track through each row, and\r\nleaving the ground bare where it passed. The hay is often carried to a\r\ngreat height, and sometimes dropped in an adjoining field.\r\n\r\nOn a bright morning in summer one often sees, a little distance away,\r\na tremulous or flickering movement in the air, not far from the\r\nground, which Tennyson refers to in _In Memoriam_, as, \"The landscape\r\nwinking thro' the heat\"; and again in _The Princess_:\r\n\r\n                     \"All the rich to come\r\n     Reels, as the golden Autumn woodland reels\r\n     Athwart the smoke of burning weeds.\"\r\n\r\nI am told that this appearance is \"due to layers of air of different\r\ndegrees of refracting power, in motion, relative to one another. Air\r\nat different temperatures will refract light differently.\" In\r\nHampshire this phenomenon is known by the pretty name of \"the summer\r\ndance.\"\r\n\r\nSince I came to the Forest I have seen two very curious and, I think,\r\nunusual natural appearances. As I was cycling one rather dull\r\nafternoon from Wimborne to Ringwood, I noticed a colourless rainbow,\r\nor perhaps I should say, \"mist-bow,\" for there was no rain, and the\r\nsun was partially obscured. The sun was about south-west, and the bow\r\nwas north-east; it was merely a series of well-defined but colourless\r\nsegments of circles, close to each other but shaded so as to make them\r\ndistinguishable, arranged exactly like a rainbow but without a trace\r\nof colour beyond a grey uniformity. It was on my left for several\r\nmiles, perhaps half of the total distance of nine miles between the\r\ntwo towns.\r\n\r\nCycling another day between Lyndhurst and Burley, I reached the east\r\nentrance of Burley Lodge, which is on higher ground than the farm\r\nspread out to the right in the valley. The whole valley was filled\r\nwith thick white mist, as level as a lake, so that nothing could be\r\nseen of the fields. The setting sun was low down at the further\r\nextremity of the valley, and the surface of the mist-lake reflected\r\nits rays in a rosy sheen, with a track of brighter light in the\r\nmiddle, stretching from the far end of the lake in a broad path almost\r\nto where I was standing; just as we see the track of sunlight or\r\nmoonlight, sometimes, on the sea, from the shore. This phenomenon is\r\nnot uncommon when one is looking down from the top of a hill in the\r\nsunshine, upon a valley full of mist, but I have never seen it before\r\nfrom comparatively low ground, as on this occasion.\r\n\r\nMy summers at Aldington were nearly always too busy to allow me to\r\ntake a holiday, except for a very few days, but when the urgent work\r\nof the year was over, the harvest completed, and the hops and the\r\nfruit picked, we always had a clear month away from home, about the\r\nmiddle of October to the middle of November; and, as we found the\r\nautumn much less advanced in the south than in the midlands, we often\r\nspent the time on the south coast or in the Isle of Wight, and we were\r\nnearly always favoured by fine weather. On one of these occasions,\r\nwhen we were exploring the whole island on bicycles, I never once\r\nfound it necessary to carry a waterproof cape, though in the course of\r\nthis visit we rode over 600 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NOTE. THE CHANGING COURSE OF STREAMS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS: PEACOCKS--A WHITE PHEASANT--ROOKS' ARITHMETIC.\r\n\r\n     \"Hail to thee, blithe spirit!\r\n       Bird thou never wert,\r\n     That from heaven or near it,\r\n       Pourest thy full heart.\"\r\n                               --SHELLEY: _To a Skylark_.\r\n\r\nWe read of the peacocks which Solomon's navy of Tarshish brought once\r\nin three years with other rare and precious commodities to contribute\r\nto the splendour of his court; and doubtless their magnificence added\r\na distinct feature even where so much that was beautiful was to be\r\nseen; but, to show itself off to the best advantage, one cannot\r\nimagine a better place for a peacock than a grey old English home,\r\nround whose mellow stone walls time is lingering lovingly. The touch\r\nof brilliant life beside the appeal of the venerable past adds\r\nperfection to the picture. I have always had an immense admiration for\r\npeacocks, and soon after I came to Aldington I bought a pair. The cock\r\nwe named Gabriel Junks, after the famous bird in one of Scrutator's\r\nbooks; he was a grand presence, and loved to display the huge fan of\r\nhis gorgeously-eyed tail, quivering his rattling quills in all the\r\nglory of its greens and blues, and cinnamon-coloured wing feathers, on\r\nthe little piece of lawn under the chestnut trees in front of the\r\nManor.\r\n\r\nHe learned to come to the window every morning at breakfast-time for a\r\npiece of bread-and-butter, and if the window was closed he would rap\r\nimpatiently upon it with his beak. He roosted in the orchard just\r\nacross the road on the trunk of an ancient leaning apple-tree. One\r\nnight Bell heard a terrible fluttering, and looking out saw a fox\r\nmaking off with the peacock; he shouted and the fox dropped the\r\npeacock and bolted. Gabriel was not hurt, but sadly ruffled inwardly\r\nand outwardly, though, next day, he was quite happy and apparently\r\nunconscious of his narrow escape. But alas! some months later Reynard\r\npaid another visit, and poor Gabriel was never seen again. Some years\r\nafter we bought another pair, not nearly so tame as the first, and\r\nsometimes flying on to the cottage roofs and scraping holes in the\r\nthatch in which to bask in the sun. The villagers complained that the\r\nbirds sat under their black currant bushes, and devoured the currants\r\nas fast as they ripened! We could not keep them within bounds, and\r\nlater sold them to St. John's College, Oxford, where we saw them soon\r\nafterwards in good plumage, and exactly in keeping with their\r\nbeautiful surroundings.\r\n\r\nOne of my neighbours appeared to find these birds a special\r\ninfliction, and complained of the invasion of his premises by \"them\r\npaycocks.\" The word \"pea\" is always rendered \"pay\" in Worcestershire,\r\nand, like \"tay\" for \"tea,\" is probably the old correct pronunciation.\r\nI lately saw a notice on some tumble-down premises near Southampton,\r\n\"Pay and bane stiks for sale.\" Another notice, not too happily\r\ncomposed, is to be seen at a Forest village; after the owner's name,\r\n\"Carpenter, builder and undertaker--_repairs neatly executed_.\"\r\n\r\nThe neighbour referred to was exercised in his mind as to my position\r\nin various unwelcome parochial offices, but I was completely mystified\r\nwhen he told me that he had read in history of a King Alfred, but had\r\nnever heard of a King Arthur. I did not grasp the force of his remark,\r\npossibly because King Arthur was a familiar character to me, until I\r\nwas nearly at my own door, when it dawned upon me to my intense\r\nenjoyment. If the reader fails, like me, to see the point, let him\r\nturn to the title-page of this book, and read the name of the writer.\r\n\r\nThe only real objection to peacocks, under ordinary conditions, is the\r\ndiscordance of their cries, especially in thundery weather, when they\r\nscream in answer to every thunder-clap. Cock pheasants, relatives of\r\nthe peacock, crow loudly at any unusual noise; and I have known them\r\nexpostulate at the report of a gun; they took flight, after running to\r\na safe distance, and their crow appeared to be in the nature of a\r\nchallenge or defiance, just as a barn-door cock will exult if you give\r\nhim the idea that he has driven you away.\r\n\r\nWhen the vessel which carried the coffin of Queen Victoria was\r\ncrossing the Solent, in 1901, some very heavy salutes were fired from\r\nthe battleships, and, the day being still and the air clear, the\r\ndetonations carried to an immense distance. They were distinctly heard\r\nat Moreton-in-the-Marsh, only fourteen miles from Aldington and a\r\ndistance of nearly one hundred miles from the guns, in a direct line.\r\nThe reports were so loud at Woodstock, near Oxford, that the pheasants\r\nbegan crowing in the Blenheim preserves.\r\n\r\nAt Alton there were some extensive woods and coppices on the farm,\r\nwhich were favourite breeding-places for pheasants, being dry and\r\nsunny. Some months before October 1, when pheasant shooting begins, a\r\nwhite pheasant was seen, and although he disappeared for a time, he\r\nfell eventually to the gun of the tenant. He was a beautiful bird, and\r\nwas considered worth stuffing as a rarity. Albinism is not uncommon in\r\nthe blackbird; I have seen two partial instances lately; one was\r\nconstantly visible in my garden and meadows, with head nearly all\r\nwhite, and the other I saw in the public garden at Bournemouth, with\r\nthe peculiarity still more developed. A white martin, or swallow, came\r\ninto the house of a friend near Aldington, and was regarded as an\r\nunfavourable omen. Melanism, the opposite of albinism, is rarer, and\r\nthe only instance I have seen was that of a black bullfinch at\r\nAldington; it had evidently been mobbed as a stranger by other birds\r\nof its kind, as it was injured and nearly dead when captured. I had\r\nthe specimen stuffed as a curiosity, though I am not fond of stuffed\r\nbirds. It is said that hemp-seed, if given in undue quantities to cage\r\nbullfinches, will produce the black colour, even upon a bird of quite\r\nnatural plumage originally, and a case of the kind is mentioned by\r\nGilbert White.\r\n\r\nAldington, with its quiet apple orchards and the \"island\" and\r\nshrubberies below my garden, was a happy refuge for birds of all\r\nkinds, and the old pollard-willow heads a favourite nesting-place.\r\nWorcestershire people have some very curious names for birds, and some\r\nof these are also heard in Hampshire and Dorset. The green woodpecker\r\nis the \"stock-eagle,\" \"ekal,\" or \"hickle,\" both in Worcestershire and\r\nHampshire, and the word survives too in \"Hickle Brook\" in the Forest,\r\nand in \"Hickle Street,\" a part of Buckle Street in Worcestershire. As\r\na boy I once marked a green woodpecker into one of the round holes we\r\nsee quite newly cut by the bird in an oak; getting a butterfly net I\r\nclapped it over the hole, caught the bird, took it home and placed it\r\nin a wicker cage. Then, returning to the tree with a chisel and\r\nmallet, I cut a hole about a foot below the entrance to the nest, only\r\nto find young birds instead of the eggs for which I had hoped. I went\r\nhome to see how my captive was getting on; she was gone, and her\r\nmethod of escape was plain, one or two of the wicker bars being neatly\r\ncut through. I had forgotten the power of \"stocking\" of a\r\n\"stock-eagle,\" for that is the meaning of the prefix in the name.\r\n\r\nThe laughing cry of the green woodpecker, or \"yaffle,\" as the bird is\r\nby onomatopoeia called in some parts, is regarded as a sign of rain. I\r\ndoubt whether it should be always so interpreted, for I know it is\r\nsometimes a sign of distress or call for help, having heard it from\r\none in full flight from a pursuing hawk. Other curious local names of\r\nbirds in Worcestershire are \"Blue Isaac\" for hedge sparrow,\r\n\"mumruffin\" for long-tailed tit, \"maggot\" for magpie, and the heron is\r\nalways called \"bittern\" (really quite a distinct bird). There are\r\ninnumerable rhymes as to the signification of numbers where magpies\r\nare concerned, but the most complete I have heard runs thus:\r\n\r\n     \"One's joy, two's grief,\r\n     Three's marriage, four's death,\r\n     Five's heaven, six is hell,\r\n     Seven's the devil his own sel'.\"\r\n\r\nOther rhymes make \"one\" an unlucky number, and there are many people\r\nin Worcestershire who never see a solitary magpie without touching\r\ntheir hats to avert the omen, and convert it to one of good-luck; as a\r\nman once said to me, \"It is as well not to lose a chance.\"\r\n\r\nThe kingfisher, I suppose the most beautiful of British birds, was,\r\nwith all my brooks, a common bird at Aldington. Its steady flight,\r\nfollowing the course of a stream, and its brilliant colouring make it\r\nvery conspicuous, its turquoise blue varying to dark green, and its\r\norange breast flashing in the sun. I found a nest in a water-rat's old\r\nhole, with six very transparent white eggs, deriving a rosy tint from\r\nthe yolk, almost visible, within the shell. The hole had an entrance\r\nabove the bank, descended vertically, turned at a right angle where\r\nthe nest, merely a layer of small fish-bones, was placed, and ended\r\nhorizontally on the side of the bank. I once saw six young kingfishers\r\nsitting side by side on a dead branch, close together, evidently just\r\nout of the nest. And I was fortunate in seeing a kingfisher dart upon\r\nthe water, hover for an instant like a hawk-moth over honeysuckle,\r\nand, having caught a small gudgeon, fly away with it in its beak.\r\nThey, like the martin, always perch on leafless wood, so that the\r\nleaves shall not impede their flight when pouncing upon a fish, and no\r\ndoubt this is the reason they sometimes perch on the top joint of the\r\nrod of a hidden fisherman.\r\n\r\nThe nuthatch, called here the \"mud-dauber,\" from its habit of\r\nnarrowing the hole of a starling's old nest, with mud, for its own use\r\nas a nesting-place, is a more common bird in the Forest than in\r\nWorcestershire. It is a provident bird, firmly wedging hazel nuts in\r\nthe autumn into crevices of the Scots-fir, for a winter store, Bewick\r\nmentions that it uses these crevices as vices, to hold the nut\r\nsecurely, while it cracks it; but he does not recognize the fact that\r\nthey have been stored long previously. I have seen a great number of\r\nnuts so stored and quite sound.\r\n\r\nBewick, by the way, who wrote his _History of British Birds_ in 1797,\r\npresents in one of his inimitable \"tailpiece\" wood-cuts a prevision of\r\nthe aeroplane. The picture shows the airman seated in a winged car,\r\nguiding with reins thirteen harnessed herons as the motive power, and\r\nmounting upwards, apparently very near the moon. If he can see the\r\nmodern interpretation of his dream he must be pleasantly surprised.\r\nBewick's woodcock is one of the most beautiful portraits in the book:\r\nthe accurate detail of the feather markings of the wings and back and\r\nthe softer tone of the breast are as nearly perfection as possible. A\r\nwoodcock visited Aldington in one of the very severe winters but\r\nmanaged to elude all pursuers. It has been said, and also\r\ncontradicted, that the woodcock when rising from the ground uses its\r\nlong bill as a lever to assist its starting, just as an oarsman pushes\r\noff from the bank with a boat-hook or oar; I myself have seen one\r\nrising from a bare and marshy place, and the position of its bill\r\ncertainly gave me the impression that the idea was well founded.\r\n\r\nThe woodcock often breeds in the south of England, but is usually a\r\nmigrating bird, arriving during the first moon in November; it is not\r\ndifficult to shoot when it first rises, but when steam is really up\r\nand it is zig-zagging between the branches of an oak, it takes a good\r\nshot to make sure of it. I shall never forget the first woodcock I\r\nshot as a boy; it was a thick misty day in November, I fired, and\r\nthough I felt certain I had not missed, the smoke hung and the air was\r\ntoo thick to see, and, after a long search, I left the wood and was\r\ngoing home when our old spaniel, Flush, turned his head to examine\r\nsomething in a deep cart rut. Following the direction of his eyes, I\r\nsaw my woodcock; it must have flown 100 yards or more after I fired. I\r\nwas still more pleased with the last shot I fired in our old Surrey\r\ncovers at a woodcock going like an express train--and faster, for they\r\nare said to fly at the rate of 150 miles an hour--with all his tricks,\r\nthrough thick branches in the adjoining cover, where he fell at least\r\n65 yards from where I stood. A friend of mine had the good-fortune to\r\nsee an old woodcock, which had evidently bred in his woods, flying,\r\nfollowed by five or six young ones; he said it was one of the\r\nprettiest bits of natural history he had ever seen.\r\n\r\n     \"If a woodcock had a partridge's breast\r\n     He'd be the best bird that ever was dressed;\r\n     If a partridge had a woodcock's thigh\r\n     He'd be the best bird that ever did fly.\"\r\n\r\nis a very old description, and fairly divides the honours between the\r\ntwo birds.\r\n\r\nThe hawfinch is very easily recognized by its distinct and beautiful\r\ncolouring; it is a shy bird, and though it bred regularly at\r\nAldington, we rarely saw it. It is commoner here, and is sometimes\r\nvery destructive, its powerful beak making havoc with the\r\n\"marrowfats\"; but, though I am partial to green peas of this\r\ndescription, I would sooner suffer some damage than have the\r\nhawfinches shot.\r\n\r\nIn 1918 the cuckoos were exceedingly numerous here, and round my house\r\nthey were calling all day long. Owing to the terrible winter and early\r\nspring months of the previous year, so many of the insectivorous birds\r\nhad been destroyed, that the caterpillars had escaped, and were more\r\nnumerous than ever in the following spring. The oaks in places were\r\ncompletely stripped of their foliage by the larvae of _Tortrix\r\nviridana_, almost as soon as the leaves were out. The cuckoos\r\ndiscovered them, but were not in sufficient numbers to keep them down,\r\nand it was midsummer before the trees recovered. I have referred to\r\nthe damage in my plum orchard at Aldington from the attack of the\r\nlarvae of the winter-moth; the damage is not confined to the actual\r\nyear of its occurrence, the crop suffers the following year owing to\r\nthe previous defoliation of the tree, which is weakened and is unable\r\nto mature healthy fruit buds. At Aldington, in a hot summer, the\r\ncuckoos used to call nearly all night, and I have heard them when it\r\nwas quite dark.\r\n\r\nFor some years, until 1918, goldfinches were quite common in Hampshire\r\nand Dorsetshire. I have seen a flock of over forty together. I had\r\nseven nests on my premises here one summer; they go on breeding very\r\nlate, and I have found their nests with young birds half-fledged while\r\nsummer-pruning apple trees in August. They come into my garden close\r\nto the windows in May, after the ripening seeds of the myosotis\r\n(forget-me-not) in the spring-bedding. I never remember seeing a\r\ngoldfinch at Aldington, which should show that the thistles were well\r\nunder control, for the seed is a great attraction. One often hears the\r\npractice of allowing thistles to run to seed condemned as criminal,\r\nfor everybody knows that each thistle-down, carried by the wind,\r\ncontains a seed, and that the attachment of a light structure of\r\nplumes is one of Nature's methods of ensuring dissemination. But, in\r\nWorcestershire, it is always asserted that thistle seed will not\r\ngerminate--I am referring to _Cnicus arvensis_--and it is said that a\r\nprize of £50 offered for a seedling thistle remains unclaimed to this\r\nday. I failed, myself, in trying to obtain young plants from seeds\r\nsown in a flower-pot, and I have never seen a seedling in all the\r\nthousands of miles I must have walked over young cornfields when my\r\nmen were hoeing.\r\n\r\nI have heard an interesting story about rooks which were causing a\r\nfarmer much damage in a field newly sown with peas. He erected a small\r\nshelter of hurdles, from which to shoot them, and for a time the\r\nshelter was sufficient to scare them, until they got used to it; but,\r\nwhen he entered it with his gun, they would not come near. Thinking to\r\ndeceive their sentinel, watching from a tree, he took a companion to\r\nthe shelter, who remained for a time and then left, but still no rooks\r\ncame near. The farmer then took two companions, and presently sent\r\nthem both away. The arithmetic was too much for the rooks, and the\r\nscheme succeeded. He concluded that their powers of enumeration were\r\nlimited to counting \"two,\" and that \"three\" was beyond them.\r\n\r\nNightingales are scarce in the Forest; they do not like the solitude\r\nof the great woods, apparently preferring to inhabit roadsides and\r\nplaces where people and traffic are constantly passing. They are\r\nspecially abundant at the foot of the Cotswolds, and it is a treat to\r\ncycle steadily along the road between Broadway and Weston Subedge on a\r\nsummer evening, where you no sooner lose the liquid notes of one, than\r\nyou enter the territory of another, so continuous is the song for\r\nmiles together.\r\n\r\nIn severe winters wood-pigeons did much damage at Aldington to young\r\nclover a few inches high; they roosted in \"the island\" adjoining my\r\ngarden. When they first descended they alighted in the wide-spreading\r\nbranches of the leafless black poplars, where they could see all\r\nround, and reconnoitre the position; then, if all was quiet, in about\r\nten minutes they took to the shelter of the fir trees for the night\r\nwith much fluttering and beating of wings against the thick branches.\r\nThey devour the acorns in the Forest very greedily in the autumn, and\r\nI have seen one with crop so full that on my approach it could only\r\nwith difficulty fly away to a short distance. I found it near a small\r\npond where, apparently, it had been drinking, and the acorns had\r\nexpanded to an inconvenient extent.\r\n\r\nThe golden-crested wren was a common bird here before the severe\r\nwinter of 1916-1917, but it has since become comparatively rare; it is\r\nthe smallest of British birds, and could often be seen in the hedges\r\nexploring every twig and crevice for insects, and it was a great\r\npleasure to watch the nimble movements of such a sweet little fairy.\r\nIts first cousin, the fire-crest, which is almost its exact\r\ncounterpart, except for the flame-coloured crest, is much rarer; and I\r\nonly remember seeing one specimen, to which with great circumspection\r\nI managed to approach quite closely, in the wood near my house.\r\n\r\nOne morning, at Aldington, the gardener came in to say there was a\r\nhawk in the greenhouse near the rickyard; we found a pane of glass\r\nbroken, where it had unintentionally entered in pursuit of a sparrow;\r\nthe hawk was uninjured, and flew away quite unconcernedly on the\r\nopening of the door. Another hawk, here in Burley, was found dead near\r\nmy drawing-room bow-window. It had dashed itself against a pane of\r\nthick plate-glass while in pursuit of a starling, I think; seeing the\r\nlight through the bow, it had not recognized the glass, and must have\r\ncollided with it in the act of swooping. I have several times seen\r\nhawks descend like a flash from a tree, and select an unlucky starling\r\nfrom a flock; one blow on the head settled the victim before I could\r\nreach the spot, but sometimes the hawk had to leave its prize behind\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI was watching a number of young chicks feeding outside the coops\r\ncontaining the mother hens, when there suddenly arose a great\r\ndisturbance, and a hawk, which had pounced upon a chick, was seen\r\nflying away with it in its talons. Its flight was impeded by the\r\nweight of the chicken, and we gave chase shouting. Flying very low it\r\ncarried its prey to the further side of the meadow, but, seeing that\r\nit could not get quickly through the trees there, it dropped the\r\nchicken and escaped; we picked up the poor frightened infant, which\r\nwas not injured, and restored it to a perturbed but joyful mother. \"As\r\nyaller as a kite's claw,\" is a simile one hears in the country, and it\r\nis common to both Hampshire and Worcestershire.\r\n\r\nI never saw the wheatear in Worcestershire, but here I notice several\r\npairs on the moors in summer. They were once very plentiful on the\r\nSussex Downs and seaside cliffs, and as a boy walking from my first\r\nschool at Rottingdean to visit my people at Brighton, from Saturday to\r\nSunday night, I have passed hundreds of traps consisting of\r\nrectangular holes cut in the turf, having horsehair nooses inside, set\r\nby the shepherds who took thousands of wheatears to the poulterers'\r\nshops in the town. They were then considered a great delicacy. Other\r\nprofessional bird-catchers operated with large clap-nets, and a string\r\nattached in the hands of the catcher some distance away. When they\r\nwere after larks a revolving mirror, flashing in the sun, was\r\nconsidered very attractive; I suppose the birds approached from\r\nmotives of curiosity.[3] Many thousands were caught for the London and\r\nBrighton markets for lark pies and puddings, a wicked bathos, when we\r\nremember Wordsworth's lines:\r\n\r\n     \"There is madness about thee, and joy divine\r\n       In that song of thine.\"\r\n\r\nOne severe winter an immense flock of golden plovers haunted my land\r\nand neighbouring farms for some weeks, but they were exceedingly shy,\r\nand being perfect strangers, they were difficult to identify, until I\r\nbrought one down by a very long shot, and we could see what a\r\nbeautiful bird it was. We could always tell when really severe winter\r\nweather was coming, by the flocks of wild geese that passed overhead\r\nin V-shaped formation. They were said to be leaving the mouth of the\r\nHumber and the East Coast for the warmer shores of the Bristol\r\nChannel, evidently quite aware that the latter, within the influence\r\nof the Gulf Stream, were more desirable as winter-quarters. Evesham is\r\nin the direct line between the two places, and we often heard them\r\ncalling at night as they passed. In the early spring when the severe\r\nweather was-over they returned by the same route.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nPETS: SUSIE--COCKY--TRUMP--CHIPS--WENDY--TAFFY.\r\n\r\n     \"The heart is hard in nature and unfit\r\n     For human fellowship, as being void\r\n     Of sympathy, and therefore dead alike\r\n     To love and friendship both, that is not pleased\r\n     With sight of animals enjoying life,\r\n     Nor feels their happiness augment his own.\"\r\n                                                --COWPER.\r\n\r\nThere are many stories of the affection of the domestic goose for man,\r\nand I knew of one which was very fond of a friend of mine. The goose\r\nfollowed him like a dog, and would come with him on to the lawn where\r\nwe were playing tennis, and sitting close beside him on a garden seat\r\nwith great dignity would apparently watch the game with interest. My\r\nfriend was fond of unusual pets; he had a tame hedgehog, for whom he\r\nmade a most comfortable house with living-room downstairs and sleeping\r\napartment on the first floor. His pet's name was Jacob, suggested I\r\nthink by the ladder which night and morning he used for ascending to\r\nor descending from his bedroom. Hedgehogs have a bad character as\r\nrobbers of partridges' nests, and in our old parish accounts, under\r\nthe name of \"urchins,\" we find entries of payments for their\r\ndestruction at the rate of 4d. apiece.\r\n\r\nMy younger daughter had a tame duck, Susie by name, who gravely\r\nwaddled behind her round the garden. In summer at tea-time Susie would\r\nmuch enjoy the company under the wych-elm on the lawn, and took her\r\n\"dish of tea\" out of the saucer in the antique and orthodox manner.\r\nAnother amusing pet was a jackdaw who had an outdoor residence, though\r\noften allowed to be loose. He acquired an exact imitation of my old\r\ngardener's chronic cough, and enjoyed the exhibition of his\r\nachievement when the old man was working near the cage, somewhat to\r\nthe man's annoyance. He was full of mischief, and was not allowed in\r\nthe house; but he once got in at my study window, picked out every\r\nsheet of notepaper from my stationery case, and scattered them in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nA still more accomplished mimic, a lemon-crested cockatoo, reproduced\r\nthe voices of little hungry pigs. He lived indoors on a stand over a\r\ntray, with a chain round one leg, and was very clever at mounting and\r\ndescending by the combined use of beak and claws, without complicating\r\nhimself with his chain. He got loose one day, and ascended one of the\r\nchestnut trees, and a volunteer went up after him by a ladder. Cocky\r\nresented his interference, flew at him and bit his finger to the bone.\r\nHis beak was a very powerful weapon, and, until I made him a new tray\r\nwith a zinc-covered ledge, he demolished any unprotected wood or even\r\nfurniture within reach.\r\n\r\nThis spring we had a blackbird's nest in some ivy near the house, and\r\nmany times each day the cock bird came to watch over his household,\r\nand discourse sweet music from a neighbouring tree. A pair of jays\r\nhowever appeared, and seemed too much interested in the nest for the\r\nparents' comfort, approaching so near one morning that first the cock\r\nblackbird, and then the hen attacked them; and though they returned\r\nagain during the day, evidently bent on mischief, the courageous\r\nparents eventually drove them from the field, and they were seen no\r\nmore. Owing to the cutting of great fir woods in the Forest for timber\r\nsupplies for the war, jays have become much more common here than\r\nformerly, and seem to have migrated from their former haunts and taken\r\nto the beeches and oaks in the undisturbed woods.\r\n\r\nBirds as a rule are not well represented in books, though the drawing\r\nis more correct than the colouring. Examine Randolph Caldecott's _Sing\r\na Song for Sixpence_ for a really clever sketch of the four and twenty\r\nblackbirds, every one a characteristic likeness, and a different\r\nattitude; and look at his rookery in _Bracebridge Hall_, where, in\r\nthree sketches he shows some equally exact rooks.\r\n\r\nI always walked when on my farming rounds, for one of the first\r\nlessons I learned at Alton was that for that purpose \"one walk is\r\nbetter than three rides.\" My predecessor being a hunting man and fond\r\nof horses, generally rode, but for careful observation, especially in\r\nthe matter of plant diseases, one wants to \"potter about\" with a\r\nmagnifying glass sometimes, and of course in entomology and\r\nornithology there is no room for a horse. One of the remarks made by\r\nmy men about me on my arrival was, \"His mother larned him to walk,\"\r\nwith quite a note of admiration to emphasize it. It is really\r\nremarkable how farmers and country people scorn the idea of walking\r\neither for pleasure or business, if \"a lift\" can be had. I was at\r\nCheltenham with a brother, and finding we had done our business in\r\ngood time, we decided to walk to the next station--Cleeve--instead of\r\nwaiting for the train at Cheltenham. We asked a native the way, who\r\nreplied with great contempt, \"Cleeve station? Oh, I wouldn't walk to\r\nCleeve to save tuppence!\"\r\n\r\nOne of our ventures in the way of pets was a well-bred poodle; he was\r\nvery amiable, handsome, and clever, but exceedingly mischievous. He\r\nthought it great fun to pull up neatly written and carefully disposed\r\ngarden labels and carry them away to the lawn, for which, though a\r\nnuisance, he was forgiven; but his next achievement was a more serious\r\nmatter. Finding his way about the village he would take advantage of\r\nan open door to explore the cottage larders and when a chance offered,\r\nwould make off with half a pound of butter or a cherished piece of\r\nmeat and bring his plunder to my house in triumph. He was succeeded by\r\n\"Trump,\" a Dandie Dinmont, a very charming dog with a delightful\r\ndisposition, and perfectly honest until my elder daughter acquired a\r\nfox terrier, \"Chips,\" well-bred but highly nervous. Chips was a born\r\nsportsman and most useful so long as he confined his activities to\r\nrats and was busy when the thrashing-machine was at work, but when he\r\ntook to corrupting Trump's morals he required watching. Trump would be\r\nlying quietly in the house or garden as good as possible, when the\r\ninsinuating tempter would find him, whisper a few words in his ear,\r\nand off they went together. It was plainly an invitation, and later a\r\ndead duckling or chicken would show where they had spent their time.\r\nTrump became as bad as Chips and had to be given away. Chips was very\r\nsensitive to discordant sounds, he must have had a musical ear; his\r\nchief aversion was the sound of a gong, the beater for which was too\r\nhard and, unless very carefully manipulated, produced a jangle. My\r\nhall was paved with hexagonal stone sections called \"quarries,\" which\r\nappeared to intensify the discordance. Chips felt it keenly, and would\r\nstand quite rigid for some minutes until the last reverberation and\r\nits effect had passed off. He was uncertain in temper and disliked\r\nsome of the villagers. An old man complained that he had been bitten,\r\nand told me with great feeling, \"Folks say that if ever the dog goes\r\nmad, I shall go mad too.\" I had much difficulty in appeasing him and\r\nassuring him that there was no truth in the statement.\r\n\r\nHow shall I do justice to the infinite variety of \"Wendy,\" the dainty\r\nlittle Chinese princess who now rules my household? There are people\r\nwho cannot see in an old Worcester tea-cup and saucer the\r\neighteenth-century beauty, fastidiously sipping, what she called in\r\nthe same language as the Aldington cottager of to-day, her dish of\r\n\"tay.\" There are people who regard with indifference an ancient chair,\r\nexcept as an object to be sat upon, and who fail to realize its\r\nhistorical charm, or even the credit due to the maker of a piece of\r\nfurniture that has survived two hundred and fifty spring cleanings.\r\n\r\nAnd there are people who can see nothing in the Pekingese, nothing of\r\nthe distinction and \"the claims of long descent,\" nothing of the\r\npossibilities of transmigration, or of present ever-changing and human\r\nmoods. Such are the people who suppose that the \"dulness of the\r\ncountry,\" and the attraction of the shams and inanities of the picture\r\npalace induced the starving agricultural labourer willingly to\r\nexchange the blue vault of heaven for the leaden pall of London fogs,\r\ncool green pastures for the scorching pavement, and the fragrant\r\nshelter of the hedgerow blossoms for the stifling slum and the crowded\r\nfactory.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of the democrat about Wendy; watch her elevate an\r\nalready tip-tilted nose at displeasing food, or a tainted dish, and\r\nnotice her look of abject contempt for the giver as she turns away in\r\ndisgust. No lover of the Pekingese should be without a charming little\r\nbook _Some Pekingese Pets_ by M.N. Daniel, with delightful sketches by\r\nthe author, in which we are told that, \"Until the year, 1860, so far\r\nas is known, no 'Foreign Devil' had ever seen one of these Imperial\r\nLion Dogs. In that year, however, the sacking of the Imperial Palace\r\nat Pekin took place, and amongst the treasures looted and brought to\r\nEngland were five little Lion or Sun Dogs.\"\r\n\r\nThe author also says: \"It is certain that the same type of Lion Dog as\r\nour Western Pekingese must have existed in China for at least a\r\nthousand years: that they were regarded as sacred or semi-sacred is\r\nproved by the Idols and Kylons (many of them known to be at least a\r\nthousand years old) representing the same type of Lion Dog.\" I have an\r\nold Nankin blue teapot, the lid of which is surmounted by one of these\r\nKylons.\r\n\r\nI can only describe Wendy's moods and characteristics by giving a bare\r\ncatalogue: she is mirthful, hopeful, playful, despairing, bored,\r\ndefiant, roguish, cunning, penitent, sensitive, aggressive, offended,\r\nreproachful, angry, pleased, trustful, loving, disobedient,\r\ndetermined, puzzled, faithful, naughty, dignified, impudent, proud,\r\nluxurious, fearless, disappointed, docile, fierce, independent,\r\nmischievous; and she often illustrates the rhyme:\r\n\r\n     \"The dog will come when he's called,\r\n        And the cat will stay away,\r\n     But the Pekingese will do as he please\r\n        Whatever you do or say.\"\r\n\r\nWendy is cat-like in some of her habits, prefers fish to meat, sleeps\r\nall day in wet weather but is lively towards night, is very particular\r\nabout her toilet and washes her face with moistened paws passed over\r\nher ears. She is very sensitive to the weather, loves the sun, lying\r\nstretched at full length on the hot gravel so that she can enjoy the\r\ncomforting warmth to her little body. She is wretched in a\r\nthunderstorm, shivering and taking refuge beneath a table or sofa;\r\nthen she comes to me for sympathy, and lies on my knee, covered with a\r\nrug or a newspaper, but after a bad storm she is not herself for many\r\nhours. Anyone who does not know her may think the moods I have\r\ndetailed an impossible category, but there is not one which we have\r\nnot personally witnessed again and again, and no one can see her\r\nloving caresses of my wife without being assured of the soul that\r\nanimates her mind and body.\r\n\r\nWendy is never allowed to \"sit in damp clothes,\" or even with feet wet\r\nwith rain or dew, and looks very reproachful if not attended to at\r\nonce with a rough towel on coming indoors. \"Why _don't_ you dry me?\"\r\nis exactly the expression her looks convey. She has a lined basket, on\r\nfour short legs to keep her from draughts when sleeping, but she is\r\noften uneasy alone at night, evidently \"seeing things,\" and, in\r\nWorcestershire language, finding it \"unked,\" so she is now always\r\nallowed a night-light.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the dog's habit of turning round several times before\r\nsettling to sleep is a survival from remote ages when they made\r\nthemselves a comfortable bed by smoothing down the grass around them,\r\nbut I am quite sure that Wendy does the same thing to get her coat\r\nunruffled, and in the best condition to protect her from draughts. She\r\nlikes to lie curled up into a circle, so that her hind paws may come\r\nunder her chin for warmth, and support her head, as her neck is so\r\nshort that without a pillow of some sort she could not rest in\r\ncomfort; as an alternative, she will sometimes arrange the rug in her\r\nsleeping basket to act in the same way.\r\n\r\nWe had various cobs and ponies from time to time; quite a good pony\r\ncould be bought at six months old for about £12, and one of the best\r\nwe had was Taffy, from a drove of Welsh. Returning from Evesham\r\nStation with my man we passed a labourer with something in a hamper on\r\nhis shoulder that rattled, just as we reached the Aldington turning;\r\nTaffy started, swerved across the road in the narrowest part, and\r\njumped through the hedge, taking cart and all; we found ourselves in a\r\nwheat-field, but were not overturned, and reached a gate in safety\r\nnone the worse.\r\n\r\nOn an old May Day (May 12) I was at Bretforton Manor playing tennis\r\nand shooting rooks. About 10.30 p.m. the cart and Taffy were brought\r\nround; I had all my things in and was about to mount when, the pony\r\nfidgeting to be off, my friend's groom caught at the rein, but he had\r\nomitted to buckle it on one side of the bit. In an instant pony and\r\ntrap had disappeared, and the man was lying in the drive with a broken\r\nleg. We had to carry him home on a door, and then went in search of\r\nthe pony, expecting every moment to find it and the trap in a ditch;\r\nabout half a mile from Aldington we met my own man who had come in\r\nsearch of my remains. He told us that the pony and trap were quite\r\nsafe and uninjured. The clever animal had trotted the whole distance,\r\nover two miles, with the reins dragging behind him, taken the turning\r\nfrom the highroad, and again at my gate, and pulled up in front of the\r\nhouse, where someone passing saw him and brought my man out to the\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUTTERFLIES--MOTHS--WASPS.\r\n\r\n     \"How like a rainbow, sparkling as a dewdrop,\r\n     Glittering as gold, and lively as a swallow,\r\n     Each left his grave-shroud and in rapture winged him\r\n         Up to the heavens.\"\r\n                              --ANON.\r\n\r\nI have always been fascinated by the beauty of butterflies and moths,\r\nand I think I began collecting when I was about eleven, as I remember\r\nhaving a net when I was at school at Rottingdean. My first exciting\r\ncapture was a small tortoiseshell, and I was much disappointed when I\r\ndiscovered that it was quite a common insect. In 1917 some nettles\r\nhere were black with the larvæ of this species, but I think they must\r\nhave been nearly all visited by the ichneumons, which pierce the skin,\r\nlaying their eggs in the living body of the larva, as the butterflies\r\nwere not specially common later. I was, however, fortunate in\r\nidentifying a specimen of the curious variety figured in Newman's\r\n_British Butterflies_, variety 2, from one in Mr. Bond's collection;\r\nit has a dark band crossing the middle of the upper wings, but, though\r\ninteresting, it is not so handsome as the type. I did not catch this\r\nspecimen, as I do not like killing butterflies now, but I had ample\r\nleisure to observe it quite closely on the haulm of potatoes. It was\r\ndecidedly smaller than the type.\r\n\r\nThe old garden at Aldington in the repose of a June evening was a\r\nplace of fragrant joy from honeysuckle on poles and arches, and just\r\nas the light was fading the huge privet hawk-moths, with quivering\r\nwings and extended probosces, used to sip the honey from the long\r\nblossoms. I could catch them in a net, but these specimens were nearly\r\nall damaged from their energetic flight among the flowers, and perfect\r\nones are easy to rear from the larvæ, feeding in autumn on privet in\r\nthe hedges.\r\n\r\nLater in the summer the Ghost Swift appeared about twilight, the white\r\ncolour of the male making it very conspicuous. Twilight at Aldington\r\nis called \"owl light,\" and moths of all kinds are \"bob-owlets,\" from\r\ntheir uneven flight when trying to evade the owls in pursuit. We often\r\nsee these birds \"hawking\" at nightfall in my meadows round the edge of\r\nthe Forest after moths.\r\n\r\nThe martagon lily flourished in the Aldington garden, and when they\r\nwere blooming the overpowering scent was particularly attractive to\r\nmoths of the _Plusia_ genus, including the Burnished Brass, the Golden\r\nY, and the Beautiful Golden Y, all exhibiting very distinctive\r\nmarkings of burnished gold; and other _Noctuæ_ in great variety. The\r\nlatter are best taken by \"sugaring\"--painting patches of mixed beer\r\nand sugar on a series of tree trunks, and making several rounds at\r\ntwilight with a lantern and a cyanide bottle. We had a sugaring range\r\nof about seventy pollard withies by the brook side, and being well\r\nsheltered, it was such a favourite place for moths, that it was often\r\ndifficult to select from each patch, swarming with sixty or seventy\r\nspecimens, those really worth taking. At sugaring moths are found in a\r\nlocality where they are never seen at other times, and rarities occur\r\nquite unexpectedly. I took some specimens of _Cymatophora ocularis_\r\n(figure of 80). Newman says: \"It is always esteemed a rarity,\" and\r\nmentions Worcester as a locality. _Mamestra abjecta_ was quite a\r\ncommon catch, of which Newman writes:\r\n\r\n     \"It seems to be very local, and so imperfectly known that\r\n     the recorded habitats must be received with great doubt; it\r\n     is certainly abundant on the banks of the Thames, near\r\n     Gravesend, and also on the Irish coast, near Waterford.\"\r\n\r\nThe marks of sugaring remain on tree trunks for many years. I lately\r\nsaw the faint remains on about sixty trees in Set Thorns plantation,\r\nin the Forest, which a friend and I painted on nearly forty years ago.\r\nThis friend was fortunate in capturing the black variety of the White\r\nAdmiral, in which the white markings are entirely absent on the upper\r\nside; and, thirty years later, his son took another near Burley. The\r\nson also caught a Camberwell Beauty on one of his sugared patches in\r\nthe day-time. I believe this to be the only recorded instance of the\r\noccurrence of this rare and beautiful insect in the Forest.\r\n\r\nThe Hornet Clearwing (_Sesia Apiformis_) is a very interesting moth,\r\nand it was common at Aldington; the larva feeds on the wood of the\r\nblack poplar. The colouring of the moth so resembles the hornet, that\r\nat first sight it is easily mistaken for the latter. It is an\r\nexcellent example of \"mimicry,\" whereby a harmless insect acquires the\r\ndistinctive appearance of a harmful one, and so secures immunity from\r\nthe attacks of its natural enemies.\r\n\r\nThe larva of the Death's Head was not uncommon at Aldington and Badsey\r\non potatoes; I had a standing offer of threepence each for any that\r\nthe village children could bring me. These large caterpillars require\r\nvery careful handling, and I fear the children were not gentle enough\r\nwith them, as I only had one perfect specimen moth from all the larvae\r\nthey brought.\r\n\r\nOne of my hop-pickers captured and presented me with a very fine\r\nspecimen of the Convolvulus Hawk-moth at Aldington; they were\r\ngenerally comparatively common that year (1901) and a collector took\r\nno less than seventeen in a few days in the public garden at\r\nBournemouth.\r\n\r\nThe Clouded Yellow butterfly, whose appearance is very capricious,\r\noccurred one summer in Worcestershire in considerable numbers; it is\r\nstrong on the wing and could easily reach the Midlands in fine weather\r\nfrom the south of England, where it is more often seen. Those I saw\r\nwere flying high over clover fields, apparently in a hurry to get\r\nfurther north-west.\r\n\r\nThe Marbled White is a somewhat local butterfly; there was a spot\r\nalong the Terrace on Cleeve Hill, near North Littleton and Cleeve\r\nPrior, where, at the proper time, this insect was plentiful, but I\r\nnever saw it anywhere else in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nOne of the entomological prizes of the New Forest is the Purple\r\nEmperor; it is impossible to do justice to the wonderful sheen of its\r\npowerful wings. It inhabits the tops of lofty oaks, but does not\r\ndisdain to come down for a drink of water, sometimes from a muddy\r\npool, or even to feast on dead vermin which the keepers have\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe Comma, so called from the C-mark on the under side of the hind\r\nwings, is fairly plentiful in Worcestershire and Herefordshire in the\r\nhop-districts, for the hop is its food plant; but it is curious that,\r\nwith the abundance of hops in Kent, Sussex, and Hants, it is quite a\r\nrare insect in the south of England. The ragged edge of its hind wings\r\nis probably an arrangement to baffle birds in pursuit, offering more\r\ndifficulty to securing a sure hold than is afforded by the even margin\r\nof the hind wings of most butterflies.\r\n\r\nIn some years wasps were exceedingly troublesome at Aldington, and\r\nfruit picking became a hazardous business. One of my men ploughed up a\r\nnest in an open field, and was badly stung, though the horses, being\r\nfurther from the nest when turned up, escaped. It is quite necessary\r\nto destroy any nests on or near land where fruit is grown, as the\r\ninsects increase in numbers at a surprising rate, and they travel\r\ngreat distances after food for the grubs. I had an instructive walk\r\nover the fruit farm of my son-in-law, Mr. C.S. Martin, of Dunnington\r\nHeath, near Alcester, with his cousin, Mr. William Martin, who is\r\nextraordinarily clever at locating the nests. He quickly recognizes a\r\nline of flight in which numbers of wasps can be seen going backwards\r\nand forwards, in a well-defined cross-country track, follows it up and\r\nlocates the nest a long distance from where he first perceived the\r\nline. In this way during our walk he found a dozen or more nests. In\r\nthe evening, when the inmates were at home, they were treated with a\r\nstrong solution of cyanide of potassium to destroy the winged insects;\r\nand the next day the nests were dug out and the grubs destroyed, which\r\notherwise would become perfect wasps.\r\n\r\nLately it has become a custom to pay a half-penny each for all queen\r\nwasps in the spring, but Mr. C.S. Martin, who had many years'\r\nexperience on the fruit plantations of the Toddington Orchard Company,\r\nextending to about 700 acres, as well as on his own plantations at\r\nDunnington, writes to me as follows on the subject:\r\n\r\n     \"To catch the queens in the spring is to my mind a waste of\r\n     time, and I discontinued paying for their capture, as the\r\n     number visible in the spring appeared to bear no relation to\r\n     the resulting summer nests. In the first place, the number\r\n     of queens in spring is always greatly in excess of the\r\n     numbers of nests, and to attempt to catch all the queens is\r\n     a hopeless job. As a rule, I don't think one per cent, ever\r\n     gets as far as a nest unless the weather conditions are very\r\n     favourable. Heavy rain, when the broods begin, may easily\r\n     wipe out 99 per cent., and only those on a dry bank will\r\n     survive. To pay a halfpenny per queen may be equivalent to\r\n     the payment of four and twopence per nest!\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the payment of school-children for the destruction of\r\nwhite butterflies he writes:\r\n\r\n     \"The white butterfly is extraordinarily prolific, and to\r\n     catch a few in the garden is a complete waste of time.\r\n     Again, weather conditions are largely responsible for the\r\n     occurrence of a bad attack, and the only possible time to\r\n     reduce the plague is in the caterpillar stage, with\r\n     hellebore powder, or one of the proprietary remedies,\r\n     applied to the young plants. Scientists recommend the\r\n     catching of queen wasps, and also butterflies, but I regard\r\n     this as a case where science is not strictly practical.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, the danger, too, that children will not recognize\r\nthe difference between the female of the Orange Tip butterfly, which\r\nis practically colourless, and the cabbage whites, and it would be\r\nworse than a crime to destroy so joyous and welcome a creature, whose\r\nadvent is one of the pleasantest signs that summer is nigh at hand. I\r\nhave watched these fairy sprites dancing along the hedge sides at\r\nAldington year by year, and in May they were extraordinarily abundant\r\nhere, happily coursing round and round my meadow, and chasing each\r\nother in the sunshine. The Orange Tip is quite innocent of designs\r\nupon the homely cabbage, the food-plant of the caterpillar being\r\n_Cardamine pratensis_ (the cuckoo flower), which Shakespeare speaks of\r\nso prettily in the lines:\r\n\r\n     \"When daisies pied and violets blue,\r\n     And lady-smocks all silver-white.\"\r\n\r\nPossibly Hood was thinking of the Orange Tip when he wrote the lines\r\nthat seem so well suited to them:\r\n\r\n     \"These be the pretty genii of the flowers\r\n     Daintily fed with honey and pure dew.\"\r\n\r\nA story is told of an undergraduate who united the hind wings of a\r\nbutterfly to the body and fore wings of one of a different species,\r\nand, thinking to puzzle Professor Westwood, then the entomological\r\nauthority at Oxford, asked if the Professor could tell him \"what kind\r\nof a bug\" it was. \"Yes,\" was the immediate reply--\"a humbug!\"\r\n\r\nOne of my schoolfellows, a boy about eleven, at Rottingdean school,\r\nand quite a novice at butterfly collecting, met a professional\r\n\"naturalist\" on the Warren at Folkestone, who inquired what he had\r\ntaken. \"Only a few whites,\" said the boy. The man looked at them and,\r\neventually, they negotiated an exchange, the boy accepting three or\r\nfour others for an equal number of the whites. On reaching home he\r\nfound that he had parted with specimens of the rare Bath White,\r\n_Pieris daplidice_, for some quite common butterflies. The Bath White\r\nis not recognized as a British species, Newman supposing the specimens\r\ntaken in this country to have been blown over or migrated from the\r\nnorthern coast of France, as they have been rarely met with away from\r\nthe shores of Kent and Sussex.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to find so many people who seem unable to exercise\r\ntheir powers of observation to the extent of noticing the butterflies\r\nthey daily pass in the garden, or along the roads. One would expect\r\nthat the marvellous colouring of even our common butterflies would\r\narrest attention, and that interest in the names and life-history\r\nwould follow.\r\n\r\nIn June in the Forest the rather alarming stag-beetle is to be seen on\r\nthe wing on a warm evening; though really harmless, its size and habit\r\nof buzzing round frightens people who are not acquainted with its\r\nways. They are called locally, \"pinch-bucks,\" as their horns resemble\r\nthe antlers of a buck, and they can nip quite hard by pressing them\r\ntogether. I once saw a fight between a stag-beetle and a toad, it had\r\nevidently been proceeding for some time as both combatants were\r\nexhausted, but neither had gained any special advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCYCLING--PAGEANTS OF THE ROADS--ROADSIDE CREATURES--HARMONIOUS\r\nBUILDING--COLLECTING OLD FURNITURE AND CHINA.\r\n\r\n     \"I may soberly confess that sometimes, walking abroad after\r\n     my studies, I have been almost mad with pleasure--the effect\r\n     of nature upon my soul having been inexpressibly ravishing\r\n     and beyond what I can convey to you.\"\r\n                                           --JOHN INGLESANT.\r\n\r\nI suppose that the bicycle has given, and gives, as much pleasure to\r\nfairly active people as any machine ever invented. I must have been\r\none of the first cyclists in England, as my experience dates from the\r\ndays when bicycles were first imported from France. The high bicycle\r\nappeared later, but the earlier machines were about the height of the\r\npresent safety, with light wooden wheels and iron tyres. The safety,\r\nwith pneumatic tyres, did not arrive till nearly thirty years later,\r\nand it was the latter invention that brought about the popularity of\r\ncycling.\r\n\r\nThe difference between cycling and walking has been stated thus:\r\n\r\n     \"When a man walks a mile he takes on an average 2,263 steps,\r\n     lifting the weight of his body with each step. When he rides\r\n     a bicycle of the average gear he covers a mile with the\r\n     equivalent of 627 steps, bears no burden, and covers the\r\n     same distance in less than one third of the time.\"\r\n\r\nPeople constantly tell me that cycling is all very well for getting\r\nfrom place to place, but otherwise they don't care about it, which I\r\ncan only account for by supposing that they find it a labour more or\r\nless irksome, or that they have never developed their perceptive\r\nfaculties, and have no real sympathy with the life of woods and fields\r\nor the spirit of the ancient farms and villages.\r\n\r\nCycling to me is a very easy and pleasant exercise, but it is far more\r\nthan that; it is like passing through an endless picture-gallery\r\nfilled with masterpieces of form and colour. The roads of England not\r\nonly present these delights to the physical sense, but they stir the\r\nimagination with historic visions from the earliest times. There are\r\nthe ancient camps, now silent and deserted, which become at the\r\nbidding of fancy peopled with the unkempt and savage British, and\r\nlater with their well-disciplined and well-equipped Roman conquerers:\r\narchers and men in armour appear; pilgrims' processions such as we\r\nread of in Chaucer; knights and ladies on their stately steeds. There\r\nare the ghosts of royal progresses, kings and queens, and wonderful\r\npageantry gorgeous in array; decorously ambling cardinals and abbots\r\nwith their trains of servitors; hawking parties with hawks and\r\nattendants; soldiers after Sedgemoor in pursuit of Monmouth's\r\nill-fated followers; George IV. and his gay courtiers on the Brighton\r\nroad; beaux and beauties in their well-appointed carriages bound for\r\nTunbridge Wells, Cheltenham, or Bath; splendid teams with crowded\r\ncoaches, and great covered waggons laden with merchandise; the\r\nhighwayman at dusk in quest of belated travellers, and companies of\r\nfarmers and cattle-dealers riding home from market together for\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nI often see a vision here in the ancient Forest tracks of a gang of\r\nwild and armed smugglers, and among them still more savage-looking\r\nforeign sailors. They have two or three Forest trucks, made especially\r\nto fit the ruts in the little-used tracks, laden with casks of spirits\r\nand drawn by rough Forest ponies. I can hear the shouts of the drivers\r\nas they urge them forward, and I can see the steaming sides of the\r\nponies in the misty moonlight of a winter night. The spirits were\r\nlanded at Poole or Christchurch, and they are on their way to Burley\r\nwhere, under the old house I bought with my land, there is still the\r\ncellar, then cleverly concealed, where the casks were stored in safety\r\nfrom the watchful eyes of the Excise; a quaint old place built of the\r\nlocal rock.\r\n\r\nThere is one vision of the roads in the Forest which nobody who saw it\r\ncan ever forget: the companies of infantry, the serious officers, the\r\nruddy-faced men, and the then untried guns of the glorious Seventh\r\nDivision, on their route marches, with fife and drum to cheer the way\r\nwith the now classic strains of \"It's a long, long way to Tipperary.\"\r\nThere are spots where I met them in the autumn of 1914 that I never\r\npass without feeling that for all time these places are sacred to the\r\nmemory of heroes.\r\n\r\nBesides the fancied pageantry of the roads there are the natural\r\nobjects of the woods, the lanes, and the fields; the blossoming\r\nhawthorn and the wild roses trailing from the hedges, the hares and\r\nrabbits, the birds, the butterflies, and the flowers; sturdy teams\r\nwith the time-honoured ploughs and harrows, the sowing of the seed,\r\nthe young gleaming corn, the scented hayfields or the golden harvest;\r\nevery man at his honourable labour, happy children dashing out of\r\nschool; noble timber, hazel coppices, grey old villages; cattle in the\r\npastures, or enjoying the cool waters of shallow pools or brooks;\r\nsheep in the field or the fold, the shepherd and his dog; apple\r\nblossom, or the ripe and ruddy fruit, bowery hop-gardens, mellow old\r\ncottages, country-folk going to market, fat beasts, cows and calves,\r\ncarriers' carts full of gossips.\r\n\r\nPictures, real pictures, everywhere, endless in variety. Steady! go\r\nsteady past these woods; see the blue haze of wild hyacinths, the cool\r\ncarpet of primroses. Look at the cowslips yellowing that meadow; do\r\nyou see the heron standing patiently in the marsh? Look overhead,\r\nwatch the hovering hawk; hark! there is the nightingale. Stop a moment\r\nat the bridge; can you see the speckled beauties with their heads\r\nupstream? Thank God for the blue, blue sky! thank God for the glory of\r\nthe sun, for the lights and shadows beneath the trees! Thank God for\r\nthe live air, the growth, the life of plant and tree, the fragrance\r\nand the beauty! Thank God for rural England!\r\n\r\nOne can tell the most ancient, apart from the scientifically made\r\nRoman roads, by the way they were worn down from the original level,\r\nespecially on hillsides, by the constant and heavy traffic. Every\r\npassing wheel abraded a portion of the surface, and the next rain\r\ncarried the _débris_ down the hill, forming in time a deep depression,\r\nbetween banks at the sides, often many feet deep, and giving the\r\nimpression of the track having been purposely dug out to lessen the\r\ngradient. In places where the road became impassable from long use and\r\nwet, deviations on either side were made, so that ten or a dozen\r\ndisused tracks can be seen side by side, often extending laterally\r\nquite a long distance from the existing road in unenclosed\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nA great charm of the bicycle is its noiselessness which, with its\r\nspeed, affords peeps of wild creatures under natural conditions.\r\nCycling on the Cotswolds I came upon two hares at a boxing match; they\r\nwere so absorbed that I was able to get quite close, and it was\r\namusing to watch them standing upright on their hind legs, and\r\nsparring with their little fists like professionals. I have often seen\r\nthe pursuit of a rabbit by a persistent stoat; the rabbit has little\r\nchance of escape, as the stoat can follow it underground as well as\r\nover; finally the rabbit appears to be paralyzed with fright, lies\r\ndown and makes no further effort. Weasels, which probably make up for\r\ndepredations of game by their destruction of rats, often cross the\r\nroad, and sometimes whole families may be seen playing by the\r\nroadside. I was shooting in Surrey when I once had an excellent view\r\nof an ermine--the stoat in its winter dress. I did not recognize it\r\nuntil it was out of sight, but I should not have shot it in any case,\r\nfor the ermine is a very rare occurrence in the south of England. I\r\nbelieve that further north it is not unusual, as is natural where the\r\nlight colour would protect it from observation in snow, but as far\r\nsouth as Surrey this would be a danger, and I should scarcely have\r\nnoticed it in the thick undergrowth had it been normal in colour.\r\n\r\nWe had a squirrel's nest, or \"drey,\" as it is called, near my house\r\nlast year, and the squirrels have been about my lawn and the Forest\r\ntrees ever since. It was charming, in the summer, to watch them\r\nnibbling the fleshy galls produced on the young oaks by a gall-fly\r\n_(Cynips)_. They chattered to each other all the time, holding the\r\ngalls between their fore feet, fragments dropping to the ground\r\nbeneath the trees. Squirrels are fond of animal food, and I wondered,\r\nas there was so much apparent waste, whether they were not really\r\nsearching for the grubs in the galls. Of late years squirrels have\r\nbeen scarce here; they were formerly abundant, but their numbers were\r\nmuch reduced by an epidemic. They seem to be increasing again,\r\npossibly the felling of so many Scots-firs has driven them from their\r\nformer haunts into adjoining oak and beech woods, such as those which\r\nalmost surround my land.\r\n\r\nDuring lunch in a meadow by the roadside, on a cycling ride, we found\r\na snake with a toad almost down its throat; the snake disgorged the\r\ntoad and escaped, but before we had finished lunch it returned and\r\nrepeated the process. This time I carried the toad, none the worse for\r\nthe adventure, some distance away, where I hope it was safe. Hedgehogs\r\nare said to eat toads, frogs, beetles, and snakes, as well as the eggs\r\nof game, to which I have already referred (p. 264); it is curious that\r\nthe old name \"urchin\" has been superseded in some places by\r\n\"hedgehog,\" but still survives in the \"sea-urchin,\" and is also used\r\nfor a troublesome boy.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting, when cycling, to notice the changes in passing\r\nfrom one geological formation to another, and in railway travelling,\r\nwith a geological map, one can quickly observe the transition; the\r\ncuttings give an immediate clue, and the contours of the surface and\r\nthe agriculture are further guides. The alteration in the flora is\r\nparticularly marked in passing from the Bagshot Sands, for instance,\r\nto the Chalk, or from the Lias Clay to the Lias Limestone or the\r\nOolite; the lime-loving plants appear on the Chalk and Limestone, and\r\ndisappear on the Sands and Clays.\r\n\r\nThe sunken appearance of the old roads is one of the best proofs of\r\ntheir antiquity, and one is inclined to wonder at their windings, but\r\nin following the tracks across the Forest moors one gets an insight\r\ninto the way roads originated. The ancients simply adopted the line of\r\nleast resistance by avoiding hills, boggy places, and the deep parts\r\nof streams, choosing the shallow fordable spots for crossing. The\r\nwinding road is, of course, much more interesting and beautiful than\r\nthe later straight roads of the Romans, though no doubt many of the\r\nformer were improved by the invaders for their more important traffic.\r\nIt is to be regretted that the formal lines of telegraph and telephone\r\npoles and wires have vulgarized so many of our beautiful roads, and\r\ndestroyed their retired and venerable expression; more especially as\r\nin many places these were erected against the will of the inhabitants,\r\nand under the mistaken idea that the farmer's business is retail, and\r\nthat he is prepared to deal in and deliver small quantities of goods\r\ndaily, receiving urgent orders and enquiries by telephone.\r\n\r\nThe villages in the Vale of Evesham and the Cotswolds afford an\r\nexcellent illustration of building in harmony with surroundings, and\r\nthe suitability of making use of local materials. Thus, in the Vale we\r\nfind mellow old brick, has limestone, half timber and thatch; while on\r\nthe Cotswolds, oolite freestone and \"stone slates\" of the same\r\nfreestone seem the only suitable material. Where the ugly pink bricks\r\nand blue slates have of late years been introduced, they appear out of\r\nplace and contemptible. There is an immense charm about these old\r\nvillages of hill and vale, and it is curious to think that Aldington\r\nwas an established community with, probably, as many inhabitants as at\r\nthe present day, when London and Westminster were divided by green\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nA story is told of the time before the line to Oxford from\r\nWolverhampton and Worcester was built, when persons visiting Oxford\r\nfrom the Vale of Evesham had to travel by road. An old yeoman family,\r\nhaving decided upon the Church as the vocation for one of the sons,\r\nsent him, in the year 1818, on an old pony, under the protection of an\r\nancient retainer for his matriculation examination. On their return,\r\nin reply to the question, \"Well, did you get the young master\r\nthrough?\" \"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"and we could have got the old pony\r\npassed too, if we'd only had enough money!\"\r\n\r\nPartly as an excuse for a bicycle ride I used often to visit distant\r\nvillages where auction sales at farm-houses were proceeding, and\r\nsometimes I came home with old china and other treasures. Wherever\r\nthere are old villages with manor houses and long occupied rich land,\r\nwealth formerly accumulated and evidenced itself in well-designed and\r\nwell-made furniture, upon which time has had comparatively little\r\ndestructive effect. As old fashions were superseded, as oak gave way\r\nto walnut, and walnut to Spanish mahogany, the out-of-date furniture\r\nfound its way to the smaller farm-houses and cottages, in which it\r\ndescended from generation to generation. Now that the cottages have\r\nbeen ransacked by dealers and collectors, the treasures have not only\r\nbeen absorbed by wealthy townspeople, but are finding their way with\r\nthose of impoverished landowners and occupiers to the millionaire\r\nmansions on the other side of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThere is no limit to the temptation to collect when once the\r\nfascination of such old things has made itself felt--furniture, china,\r\nearthenware, glass, paintings, brass and pewter become an obsession.\r\nIf I had only filled my barns with Jacobean and Stuart oak and walnut,\r\nWilliam and Mary, and Queen Ann marquetry, and Chippendale, Sheraton\r\nand Hepplewhite mahogany, instead of wheat for an unsympathetic\r\nBritish public, and at the end of my time at Aldington offered a few\r\nof the least interesting specimens for sale by auction, I might still\r\nhave carried away a houseful of treasures which would have cost me\r\nless than nothing.\r\n\r\nAn old friend of mine, who had been collecting for many years, and in\r\ncomparison with whom I was a novice, though my enthusiasm long\r\npreceded the fashion of the last twenty-five years, told me that he\r\nonce discovered a warehouse in a Cotswold village crammed with\r\nChippendale, and that the owner, having no sale for it, was glad to\r\nexchange a waggon-load for the same quantity of hay and straw chaff.\r\n\r\nAmong the more interesting articles which my cycling excursions and\r\nprevious pilgrimages on foot produced, I have a charming blue and\r\nwhite carnation pattern, Worcester china cider mug with the crescent\r\nmark. These mugs are said to have been specially made for the\r\nShakespeare Jubilee of 1769 at Stratford-on-Avon when Garrick was\r\npresent. The date corresponds with the time when the mark was in use,\r\nand establishes the age of the mug as 150 years. The china in my old\r\nneighbourhood was naturally Worcester, Bristol and Salopian, of which\r\nI have many specimens--of the Worcester more especially--ranging from\r\nthe earliest days of unmarked pieces through the Dr. Wall period,\r\nBarr, Flight and Barr, down to the later Chamberlain.\r\n\r\nAn old pair of bellows is a favourite of mine; it is made of pear-tree\r\nwood, decorated with an incised pattern of thistles and foliage,\r\nreferring possibly to the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, or as\r\na Jacobite emblem of a few years later. The carving is surrounded by\r\nthe motto:\r\n\r\n     \"WITH MEE MY FREND MAY STILL BE FREE YET VSE MEE\r\n      NOT TILL COLD YOV BEE.\"\r\n\r\nThese old bellows show unmistakable signs of their more than 200 years\r\nof honourable service, and they have literally breathed their last\r\nthough still surviving; but it would be sacrilege to renew the\r\nleather, and might disturb the ghosts of generations of old ladies who\r\nblew the dying embers into a ruddy glow when awaiting, in the twilight\r\nof a winter's evening, their good-men's return from the field or the\r\nchase.\r\n\r\nOne of my greatest finds was a pair of Chippendale chairs at a sale at\r\nMickleton at the foot of the Cotswolds; they belong to the early part\r\nof the Chippendale period, before the Chinese style was abandoned.\r\nThat influence appears in incised fretted designs on the legs, and the\r\nfrieze below the seats. The seats are covered with the original\r\ntapestry, adding much to the interest, and the backs present examples\r\nof the most spirited carving of the maker. At the sale, when I went to\r\nhave a second look, I found two dealers sitting on them and chatting\r\nquite casually; the intention was evidently to prevent possible\r\npurchasers from noticing them, and more especially to hide the\r\ntapestry coverings. The value of the chairs immediately rose in my\r\nestimation, and I increased the limit which I had given to a bidder on\r\nmy behalf, so that I made sure of buying them. The old chairs looked\r\nvery shabby when they came out into the light of day, and they fell to\r\nmy representative's bid amid roars of laughter from the rustic crowd.\r\nWhat a price for \"them two old cheers\"! they \"never heard talk of such\r\na job!\" It would surprise them to know that I have been offered five\r\ntimes what they then cost.\r\n\r\nMy wife has had to do with many parochial committees from time to\r\ntime, and I have often trembled for my Chippendale chairs when these\r\nmeetings, accompanied by tea, have been held at my house, for it is\r\nnot everybody who regards them with the reverence due to their\r\nexternal beauty and true inwardness, or who recognizes in them the\r\n\r\n     \"Tea-cup times of hood and hoop,\r\n     Or while the patch was worn.\"\r\n\r\nA very successful afternoon was one I spent at a sale at North\r\nLittleton. I remember the beautiful spring day, and the old\r\nweather-worn grey house in an orchard of immense pear-trees covered\r\nwith sheets of snowy blossom. I secured a Jacobean elm chest with\r\nwell-carved panels, a Jacobean oak chest of drawers on a curious\r\nstand, a complete tea set of Staffordshire ware, including twelve cups\r\nand saucers, teapot, and other pieces, with Chinese decoration; four\r\nNankin blue handleless tea-cups, a Delft plate, and a Battersea enamel\r\npatch-box. My bill was a very moderate one, but the executor who had\r\nthe matter of the sale in hand was well pleased that these old family\r\nrelics had passed into the possession of someone who would value them,\r\nand not to careless and indifferent neighbours, and was more than\r\nsatisfied with the amount realized. Next morning, as a token of his\r\nsatisfaction, he brought me a charming old brass Dutch tobacco box,\r\nwith an oil painting inside the lid, of a smoker enjoying a pipe.\r\n\r\nI have seen some amusing incidents at sales of household goods in\r\nremote places; incredulous smiles as to the possibility of the\r\nusefulness of anything in the shape of a bath generally greeted the\r\nappearance of such an article, and on one of these occasions an\r\nancient, with great gravity, and as an apology for its existence,\r\nremarked that it was \"A very good thing for an invalid!\" I am reminded\r\nthereby of an old-fashioned hunting man in Surrey, who was astonished\r\nto hear from a friend of mine that he enjoyed a cold bath every\r\nmorning. He \"didn't think,\" he said, \"that cold water was at all a\r\ngood thing--_next to the skin_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIALECT--LOCAL PHRASEOLOGY IN SHAKESPEARE--NAMES--STUPID PLACES.\r\n\r\n     \"Our echoes roll from soul to soul.\"\r\n                                        --_The Princess_.\r\n\r\nCompulsory education has eliminated many of the old words and phrases\r\nformerly in general use in Worcestershire, and is still striving to\r\nsubstitute a more \"genteel,\" but not always more correct, and a much\r\nless picturesque, form of speech. When I first went to Aldington I\r\nfound it difficult to understand the dialect, but I soon got\r\naccustomed to it, and used it myself in speaking to the villagers.\r\nFarrar used to tell us at school, in one of the resounding phrases of\r\nwhich he was rather fond, that \"All phonetic corruption is due to\r\nmuscular effeminacy,\" which accounts for some of the words in use, but\r\ndoes not alter the fact that many so-called corrupt words are more\r\ncorrect than the modern accepted form.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey the peculiar intonation of the\r\nWorcestershire villager's voice, and the _ipsissima verba_ I have\r\ngiven in my anecdotes lose a good deal in reading by anyone\r\nunacquainted with their method. Each sentence is uttered in a rising\r\nscale with a drop on the last few words, forming, as a whole, a not\r\nunmusical rhythmical drawl. As instances of \"muscular effeminacy,\" two\r\nfields of mine, where flax was formerly grown, went by the name of\r\n\"Pax grounds\"; the words \"rivet\" and \"vine,\" were rendered \"ribet\" and\r\n\"bine.\" \"March,\" a boundary, became \"Marsh,\" so that\r\nMoreton-on-the-March became, most unjustly, \"Moreton-in-the-Marsh.\"\r\n\"Do out,\" was \"dout\"; \"pound,\" was \"pun\"; \"starved,\" starred. The\r\nSaxon plural is still in use: \"housen\" for houses, \"flen\" for fleas;\r\nand I noticed, with pleasure, that a school inspector did not correct\r\nthe children for using the ancient form. Gilbert White, who died in\r\n1793, writes in the section of his book devoted to the Antiquities of\r\nSelborne, that \"Within the author's memory the Saxon plurals, _housen_\r\nand _peason_,\" were in common use. So that Selborne more than a\r\nhundred years ago had, in that particular at any rate, advanced to a\r\nstage of dialect which in Worcestershire is still not fully\r\nestablished. Certain words beginning with \"h\" seem a difficulty; a \"y\"\r\nis sometimes prefixed, and the \"h\" omitted. Thus height becomes\r\n\"yacth,\" as nearly as I can spell it, and herring is \"yerring.\" \"N\" is\r\nan ill-treated letter sometimes, when it begins a word; nettles are\r\nalways \"ettles,\" but when not wanted, and two consecutive words run\r\neasier, it is added, as in \"osier nait\" for osier ait.\r\n\r\nThe word \"charm,\" from the Anglo-Saxon _cyrm_, is used both in\r\nWorcestershire and Hampshire for a continuous noise, such as the\r\ncawing of nesting rooks, or the hum of swarming bees. Similarly, a\r\nwitch's incantation--probably in monotone--is a charm, and then comes\r\nto mean the object given by a witch to an applicant. \"Charming\" and\r\n\"bewitching\" thus both proclaim their origins, but have now acquired a\r\ntotally different signification.\r\n\r\nThere are an immense number of curious words and phrases in everyday\r\nuse, and they were collected by Mr. A. Porson, M.A., who published a\r\nvery interesting list with explanatory notes in 1875, under the title\r\nof _Notes of Quaint Words and Sayings in the Dialect of South\r\nWorcestershire_. I append a list of the local archaic words and\r\nphrases which can also be found in Shakespeare's Plays. This list was\r\ncompiled by me some years ago, and appeared in the \"Notes and Queries\"\r\ncolumn of the _Evesham Journal_; I think all are still to be heard in\r\nEvesham and the villages in that corner of Worcestershire.\r\n\r\nSHIP--sheep; cf.

In cycling, it is\r\none of the many interests to unravel these derivations; merely as an\r\ninstance, I may mention that in Dorset and Wilts the name of\r\nWinterbourne, with a prefix or suffix, often occurs; of course,\r\n\"bourne\" means a stream, but until one knows that a \"winterbourne\" is\r\na stream that appears in winter only, and does not exist in summer,\r\nthe name carries no special signification.\r\n\r\nOne hears some curious personal names in the Worcestershire villages;\r\nscriptural names are quite common, and seem very suitable for the\r\nolder labourers engaged upon their honourable employment on the land.\r\nWe had a maid named Vashti, and she was quite shy about mentioning it\r\nat her first interview with my wife. In all country neighbourhoods\r\nthere is a special place with the unenviable reputation of stupidity;\r\nsuch was \"Yabberton\" (Ebrington, on the Cotswolds), and Vashti was\r\nsomewhat reluctant to admit that it was her \"natif,\" as a birthplace\r\nis called in the district. Among the traditions of Yabberton it is\r\nrelated that the farmers, being anxious to prolong the summer, erected\r\nhurdles to wall in the cuckoo, and that they manured the church tower,\r\nexpecting it to sprout into an imposing steeple! There is a place in\r\nSurrey, Send, with a similar reputation, where the inhabitants had to\r\nvisit a pond before they could tell that rain was falling!\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the best story of the kind is told in the New Forest,\r\nwhere the Isle of Wight is regarded as the acme of stupidity. When the\r\nIsle of Wight people first began to walk erect, instead of on all\r\nfours, they are said to have waggled their arms and hands helplessly\r\nbefore them, saying, \"And what be we to do with these-um?\"\r\n\r\nClassical names are very uncommon among villagers, but in my old\r\nSurrey parish there was one which was the cause of much speculation.\r\nThe name was Hercules; it originated in a disagreement between the\r\nparents, before the child was christened. The mother wanted his name\r\nto be John, but the father insisted, that as an older son was Noah,\r\nthe only possible name for the new baby was \"Hark\" (Ark). They had a\r\nlengthy argument, and there was no definite understanding before\r\nreaching the church. The mother, when asked to \"name this child,\"\r\nbeing flustered, hesitated, but finally stammered out, \"Hark, please.\"\r\nThe vicar was puzzled, and repeated the question with the same result;\r\na third attempt was equally unsuccessful, and the vicar, in despair,\r\nfalling back upon his classical knowledge, christened the child\r\nHercules. A few days later the vicar called at the cottage, and the\r\nmother explained the matter, relating how indignant she was with her\r\nhusband, and how on the way home, \"Hark, I says to him, ain't the name\r\nof a Christian, it's the name of a barge!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIS ALDINGTON (FORMER SITE) THE ROMAN ANTONA?\r\n\r\n     \"Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,\r\n     Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:\r\n     O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe\r\n     Should patch a wall to expel the winter's flaw!\"\r\n                                                   --_Hamlet_.\r\n\r\nOne of my fields--about five acres--called Blackbanks from its\r\nextraordinarily black soil, over a yard deep in places, and the more\r\nremarkable because the soil of the surrounding fields is stiff\r\nyellowish clay, showed other indications of long and very ancient\r\nhabitation. Among the relics found was a stone quern, measuring about\r\n21 inches by 12 by 7-3/4, and having, on each of two opposite sides, a\r\nbasin-shaped depression about 6 inches in diameter at the top, and\r\n2-3/4 inches in depth; also a small stone ring, 1-1/4 inches in\r\ndiameter, and 3/8ths in thickness, with a hole in the centre 1/4 inch\r\nacross; the edges are rounded, and it is similar to those I have seen\r\nin museums, called spindle whorls. The quern and the ring I imagine to\r\nbe British. This field and the fields adjacent on the north side of\r\nthe stream formed, I think, primarily a British settlement and area of\r\ncultivation, afterwards appropriated by the Romans in the earliest\r\ndays of the Roman occupation of Britain, and inhabited by them as a\r\nmilitary station until they left the country.\r\n\r\nAmong other relics found in Blackbanks and in the fields to the north,\r\ncalled Blackminster, between Blackbanks and the present line of the\r\nGreat Western Railway, aggregating about a hundred acres, there were\r\nfound large quantities of fragments of pottery of several kinds,\r\nincluding black, grey, and red, and among the latter the smoothly\r\nglazed Samian. Many pieces are ornamented with patterns, some very\r\nprimitive, others geometrical; others are in texture like Wedgwood\r\nbasalt ware, and similar in colour and decoration. The Samian is\r\nmostly plain, but a few pieces have patterns and representations of\r\nhuman figures.\r\n\r\nThe fields, but especially Blackbanks, contained quantities of bones,\r\nthe horns of sheep or goats, pieces of stags, horns, iron spear and\r\narrow-heads, horses' molar teeth, and flint pebbles worn flat on one\r\nside by the passage of innumerable feet for many years. A millstone\r\nshowing marks of rotation on the surface, a bronze clasp or brooch\r\nwith fragments of enamel inlay, the ornamental bronze handle of an\r\nimportant key, a glass lacrymatory (tear-bottle), numerous\r\ncoins--referred to below--and other objects in bronze and iron, were\r\nalso found.\r\n\r\nOnly centuries of habitation and cultivation could have changed the\r\nthree feet of surface soil in Blackbanks from a stiff unworkable clay\r\nto a black friable garden mould, and it is probable that the British\r\noccupation had lasted for a very long period before the Romans took\r\npossession. The settlement must have been a place of importance,\r\nbecause it was approached from the north by a track, still existing\r\nthough practically disused, probably British, from a ford over the\r\nAvon, near the present Fish and Anchor Inn. This track passes to the\r\nwest of South Littleton, on through the middle of the Blackminster\r\nland, and immediately to the east of Blackbanks, joining what I\r\nbelieve to be the Ryknield Street at the bridge over the stream on the\r\nSouth Littleton road. Near the present Royal Oak Inn it formerly\r\ncrossed the present Evesham-Bretforton road, and became what is still\r\ncalled Salter Street. It appears to have given access to two more\r\nsites on which Roman coins and relics are found--Foxhill about 9-1/2\r\nacres, and Blackground about 4 acres--and passing east of the present\r\nBadsey church, proceeded through Wickhamford, and by a well-defined\r\ntrack to Hinton-on-the-Green, and on to Tewkesbury and Gloucester.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of the name Salter Street gives a clue to one of the\r\noriginal uses of the road, at any rate in Roman times, for salt was an\r\nabsolute necessity in those days, as may be gathered from a passage in\r\n_The Natural History of Selborne_, written in 1778:\r\n\r\n     \"Three or four centuries ago, before there were any\r\n     enclosures, sown grasses, field turnips, or field carrots,\r\n     or hay, all the cattle which had grown fat in summer, and\r\n     were not killed for winter use, were turned out soon after\r\n     Michaelmas to shift as they could through the dead months;\r\n     so that no fresh meat could be had in winter or spring.\r\n     Hence the vast stores of salted flesh found in the larder of\r\n     the elder Spencer in the days of Edward II., even so late in\r\n     the spring as the 3rd of May.\" A note adds that the store\r\n     consisted of \"Six hundred bacons, eighty carcasses of beef\r\n     and six hundred muttons.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to trace the route over which the salt was carried\r\nfrom Droitwich. Starting thence the track can be approximately\r\nidentified by the names of places in which the root, _sal_ (salt),\r\noccurs, and we find Sale Way, Salding, Sale Green, and, further south,\r\nSalford. Crossing the Worcester-Alcelster road at Radford, and\r\nproceeding through Rouse Lench and Church Lench, we reach Harvington,\r\nfrom whence the track takes us across the low-lying meadows to the\r\nferry and ford over the Avon, near the Fish and Anchor Inn mentioned\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nIn recent times it has been assumed that the road from Bidford to\r\nWeston Subedge, known as Buckle Street, is identical with Ryknield\r\nStreet, but I should prefer to call Buckle Street a branch of the\r\nlatter only, for the purpose of joining Ryknield Street and the Foss\r\nWay near Burton-on-the-Water. I consider the real course of Ryknield\r\nStreet to be as described in Leland's _Itinerary_ (inserted by\r\nHearne), Edition III., 1768, in which he quotes, from R. Gale's _Essay\r\nconcerning the Four Great Roman Ways_, that \"from Bitford on the\r\nsouthern edge of Warwickshire it (Ryknield Street) runs into\r\nWorcestershire, and taking its course thro' South Littleton goes on a\r\nlittle to the east of Evesham, and then by Hinton and west of\r\nSedgebarrow into Gloucestershire, near Aston-under-Hill, and so by\r\nBekford, Ashchurch, and a little east of Tewksbury, thro' Norton to\r\nGloucester.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a course for Ryknield Street would make it the connection between\r\nthe north, running through the Roman Alauna (Alcester) to Glevum\r\n(Gloucester). It must be remembered that there was, in Roman times,\r\nnothing at Evesham to take the road there, for Evesham did not exist\r\nas a town until long after the Romans left. Leland says that there was\r\n\"noe towene at Eovesham before the foundation of the Abbey,\" which\r\ntook place about A.D. 701, about 250 years later, and there was no\r\nroad from Alcester to Gloucester except the one we are following.\r\n\r\nAnother important road passed the northern extremity of Blackminster\r\nand crossed the road just referred to so that the Blackminster area\r\nwas situated at the junction. This was the old road from Worcester,\r\npassing the present site of Evesham a mile or more to the north,\r\ncrossing the Avon at Twyford, and the Ryknield Street at Blackminster,\r\nand going onwards through Chipping Campden towards London.\r\n\r\nThe following passage in the _Annals_ of Tacitus, Book XII., chapter\r\nxxxi., _Ille (Ostorius) ... detrahere arma suspectis, cinctosque\r\ncastris Antonam et Sabrinam fluvios cohibere parat_, which refers to\r\nthe fortification of the Antona and Severn rivers by the Roman general\r\nP. Ostorius Scapula, has been the subject of various readings and\r\ncontroversy about the word _Antona_, no river of that name having been\r\nidentified. The reading given above may not be good Latin, but the\r\nnames of the rivers are quite plain. Another reading substitutes\r\n_Avonam_ for _Antonam_; but probably Tacitus avoided the use of the\r\nword Avon because it was then a Celtic term for rivers in general, and\r\nconfusion would arise between the Avon which joins the Severn at\r\nTewkesbury and the Avon a little further south which runs into the\r\nSevern estuary at Bristol. To make his meaning quite clear he did\r\nexactly what we do now in speaking of the Stratford Avon (_i.e._,\r\nriver) and the Bristol Avon(_i.e._, river) when he prefixed _Antonam_\r\n(_et Sabrinam_) to the word _fluvios_.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we can find a place of importance with the name of\r\nAntona, or a name that may fairly represent it, having regard to\r\nsubsequent corruptions, existing also in Roman times on or near the\r\nAvon branch of the Severn, we shall be justified in assuming that this\r\nparticular Avon was the river he had in his mind. Such a place is the\r\narea I have described as full of traces of long Roman and pre-Roman\r\noccupation, situated at the junction of two ancient roads, very\r\nimportant from the military point of view, and within a mile of the\r\nAvon.\r\n\r\nOn the supposition that Antona and Aldington may be identical, the\r\npresent site of the latter is perhaps a quarter of a mile from the\r\nRoman area which I have described, but the original Aldington Mill,\r\ntraces of the foundations of which are still to be seen, was actually\r\non the Roman area. A better position for it was found later, away from\r\nthe difficulties of approach caused by floods, and it was moved to the\r\nsite occupied by the present mill just below the Manor House, probably\r\nin Anglo-Saxon times. Although the name of the village became, in\r\nAnglo-Saxon, Aldington, or something similar, the old name of Anton or\r\nAunton was evidently in common local use, as appears in the following\r\nlist of names which the present village has borne at different times.\r\nIt is specially interesting to notice that the more elaborate\r\n\"Aldington\" and its variants appear in the more scholarly records,\r\nsuch as those of Evesham Abbey and Domesday Survey, written by people\r\nnot living in the village; while the parish churchwardens 1527-1571,\r\nthe will of Richard Yardley 1531, the village constable 1715, and the\r\nvillagers at the present day, all living in the place itself, carry on\r\nthe old tradition in the names they use which approximate very closely\r\nto the Roman Antona, and are indeed identical in their manuscripts, if\r\nthe Latin terminal _a_ is omitted.\r\n\r\n                                                         _Date_\r\n     Aldintone, Charter of the Kings Kenred and Offa,\r\n       possessions of Evesham Abbey                        709\r\n\r\n     Aldingtone }\r\n     Aldintun   }  Domesday Survey                _circ._ 1086\r\n     Aldintona  }\r\n\r\n     Aldringtona, An Adjudication; Evesham Abbey          1176\r\n\r\n     Aldetone, Institutes of Abbot Randulf, died          1229\r\n\r\n     Awnton, Will of Richard Yardley of Awnton            1531\r\n\r\n     Aunton, Churchwardens accounts               1527 to 1571\r\n\r\n     Anton, Old MS. \"A Bill for ye Constable\"             1715\r\n\r\n     Alne or Auln, Villagers                       present day\r\n\r\nAs parallels of the local persistence of old names, the neighbouring\r\nvillage of Wickhamford (present-day name) is still called Wicwon by\r\nthe villagers, the same name under which it appears in the Charter of\r\nthe Abbey possessions in 709. And the Celtic London still persists in\r\nspite of the Roman attempt to confer upon it the grander name of\r\nAugusta.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of anything in the shape of foundations of former\r\nbuildings is accounted for by the fact that the whole area was\r\nquarried many years ago for the building stone and limestone beneath,\r\nand any surface stone would have been removed at the same time. One of\r\nthe fields still bears the name of the \"Quar Ground,\" and the remains\r\nof lime-kilns can be found in several places.\r\n\r\nIt is right to add that Blackbanks as the site of Antona was suggested\r\nto me many years ago by the late Canon Winnington Ingram, Rector of\r\nHarvington; in discussing the matter, however, we got no further than\r\nthe bare suggestion derived from the appearance of long habitation and\r\nthe occurrence of Roman coins and pottery in Blackbanks only, and\r\nwithout reference to the much larger area of Blackminster. Canon\r\nWinnington Ingram was not familiar with the place, and I had not\r\napprehended the importance of the track from the \"Fish and Anchor\" as\r\na salt way starting from Droitwich, nor was I aware of Salter Street,\r\nits continuation after passing Blackbanks. Neither had I distinguished\r\nbetween Buckle Street as the junction between Ryknield Street and the\r\nFoss Way, and Ryknield Street itself as the direct road from the north\r\nthrough Birmingham, Alcester, Bidford, Antona(?) Hinton, and\r\nGloucester.\r\n\r\nVirgil, in his first _Georgic_, refers to the possible future\r\ndiscovery of Roman remains, and Dryden translates the passage thus:\r\n\r\n     \"Then after lapse of time, the lab'ring swains,\r\n     Who turn the turfs of these unhappy plains,\r\n     Shall rusty piles from the plough'd furrows take,\r\n     And over empty helmets pass the rake.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is almost prophetic of my Roman site to-day; little did Virgil\r\nimagine that his lines would apply so nearly in Britain two thousand\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\n\r\nA LIST OF THE COINS FOUND AND NAMES OF THE EMPERORS TO WHOSE REIGNS\r\nTHEY BELONG, WITH SHORT NOTES ON THE LEADING INCIDENTS IN CONNECTION\r\nWITH BRITAIN WHICH OCCURRED IN THEIR REIGNS:\r\n\r\n      1. A Denarius, 88 B.C.\r\n\r\n      2. A Denarius, 88 B.C. plated. As consular denarii passed\r\n         out of circulation soon after A.D. 70, these two coins\r\n         suggest that the site was under Roman influence by that date\r\n         at the latest.\r\n\r\n      3. Claudius, Emperor (A.D. 41-54).\r\n\r\n      4. Nerva, Emperor (96-98).\r\n\r\n      5. Antoninus Pius, Emperor (138-161).\r\n\r\n      6. Marcus Aurelius, Emperor (161-180).\r\n\r\n      7. Severus Alexander, Emperor (222-235).\r\n\r\n      8. The Thirty Tyrants (211-284). Several coins of this\r\n         period, badly defaced.\r\n\r\n      9. Etruscilla, wife of Traianus Decius (249-251).\r\n\r\n     10. Gallienus, Emperor (253-268).\r\n\r\n     11. Postumus, Gallic Emperor (258-268)\r\n\r\n     12. Claudius Gothicus, Emperor (268-270)\r\n\r\n     13. Tetricus, Gallic Emperor (270-273).\r\n\r\n     14. Tacitus, Emperor (275-276)\r\n\r\n     15. Diocletianus, Emperor (284-305).\r\n\r\n     16. Carausius, Emperor in Britain (286-294).\r\n\r\n     17. Allectus, Emperor in Britain (294-296).\r\n\r\n     18. Theodora, second wife of Constantius I. (Chlorus, Cæsar,\r\n         293-305; Augustus, 305-6).\r\n\r\n     19. Licinius, Emperor (307-324).\r\n\r\n     20. Constantinus Emperor (306-337); (Constantine the Great).\r\n\r\n     21. Coin with head of Constantinopolis (City Deity)(_circ._ 330).\r\n\r\n     22. Constantinus II., Emperor (337-340).\r\n\r\n     23. Constantius II., Emperor (337-361).\r\n\r\n     24. Gratianus, Emperor (367-383).\r\n\r\nBRITISH COIN.\r\n\r\n     25. Antedrigus, British Prince (_circ._ 50).\r\n\r\nThe figures in brackets in the following notes refer to the coins as\r\nnumbered in the above list:\r\n\r\n(3) The Claudian invasion of Britain was begun in A.D. 43 by an army\r\nunder the command of Aulus Plautius Silvanus. He led his army from the\r\ncoast of Kent, where he probably landed, to the Thames, and waited for\r\nClaudius himself, in whose presence the advance to Camulodunum\r\n(Colchester) was made during the latter part of 43. Claudius\r\napparently left Rome in July, and was absent for six months, but his\r\nstay in Britain is said to have lasted only sixteen days.\r\n\r\nIn the pacification which occupied the next three years there are two\r\npoints of interest to notice. The first is a series of minor campaigns\r\nconducted by Vespasian--Emperor 69-79--who subdued the Isle of Wight\r\nand penetrated from Hampshire, perhaps, to the Mendip Hills. The\r\nsecond is the submission of Prasutagus, the British philo-Roman prince\r\nof the Iceni.\r\n\r\nIt is conjectured that his policy led a certain number of patriots\r\nunder a rival prince, Antedrigus, to migrate towards the unoccupied\r\nwest. A coin (25) of Antedrigus, with an extremely barbarous head in\r\nprofile on the obverse and a horse on the reverse, was found on the\r\nRoman area at Aldington. The types of this coin are ultimately derived\r\nfrom those on the gold staters struck by Philip of Makedon, father of\r\nAlexander the Great. The original had a young male head (? of Apollo)\r\non obverse and a two-horse chariot as reverse type. The influence came\r\nto Britain from Gaul, where the coins of Makedon may have arrived by\r\nthe valleys of Danube and Rhine; but it is not improbable that the\r\ntypes reached Gaul through Massilia (Marseilles).\r\n\r\nIn 47 Plautius was succeeded by P. Ostorius Scapula, who pressed\r\nwestwards and fought a great battle with the nationalist army of\r\nCaratacus in 51. Camulodunum became a colonia in 50, and the military\r\norganization of Britain then began to take shape by the establishment\r\nof four legionary headquarters--Isca Silurum (Caerleon-on-Usk),\r\nViroconium (Wroxeter), Deva (Chester) and Lindum (Lincoln). This\r\ndisposition, which faced north and west, came near to breaking down in\r\n61, when the east rose under Boudicca (Boadicea), queen of the Iceni,\r\npartly in protest against the usury of Seneca, the philosopher and\r\ntutor of Nero.\r\n\r\n(4) It was in the year 97, during the principate of Nerva, that\r\nTacitus the historian was consul. By this time the IXth Hispana legion\r\nhad been transferred from Lindum to Eburacum (York).\r\n\r\n(5) Under Antoninus Pius a revolt of the Brigantes (between Humber and\r\nMersey) was put down by A. Lollius Urbicus in A.D. 140. Lollius also\r\ncompleted the northern defences, begun by Hadrian, with a new wall\r\nfurther north between the Firth and the Clyde.\r\n\r\n(6) While Marcus Aurelius was emperor, according to a tradition\r\npreserved by Bede, the British Church came into close connection with\r\nRome and received what he calls a mission--more probably a band of\r\nfugitives from persecution. Though the tale is doubtful in details, it\r\nis evidence to show that Christianity was strong in the island by this\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n(9) Decius, husband of Etruscilla, was responsible for the great\r\npersecution of Christians in 250-51; the occasion was the 1,000th\r\nanniversary of Rome's foundation.\r\n\r\n(10) Gallienus, son of Valerian, was entrusted with the west on his\r\nfather's accession in 253 and defended the Rhine frontier until he was\r\nleft sole Emperor in 258, when Valerian was captured by Shapur of\r\nPersia. Various usurpations compelled Gallienus to enter Italy, and he\r\nleft the Rhine defences in charge of a general--M. Cassianius Latinius\r\nPostumus.\r\n\r\n(11) Postumus at once had to face a great invasion of Franks. He\r\ngained some successes and was therefore proclaimed emperor by the\r\narmies of Gaul and Britain. Before long dissensions broke out in the\r\nGallic empire and several commanders rose and fell in rapid\r\nsuccession. It is conceivable that some of these are represented in\r\nthe coins found in Blackbanks, but these specimens are too badly\r\nweathered for certain identification to be possible.\r\n\r\n(12) On March 4, 268, Gallienus was assassinated. His successor was M.\r\nAurelius Claudius, afterwards surnamed Gothicus, a skilful general who\r\ndid the empire great service by his victories over invaders from\r\nSwitzerland and the Tyrol by the shores of the Lago di Garda, and over\r\nthe Goths at Naissus (Nish).\r\n\r\n(13) Tetricus is of interest only because his surrender to Aurelian in\r\n273 marks the collapse of the Gallic empire.\r\n\r\n(15-18) Diocletian became Augustus in 284, and co-opted Maximian as\r\nhis colleague two years later. About the same time Carausius,\r\ncommander of the Channel fleet, crossed to Britain and had himself\r\nproclaimed independent emperor. In 290 he was acknowledged as third\r\ncolleague by the Augusti, but no place was found for him when in 293\r\nthe government of the Roman world was divided between Diocletian,\r\nMaximian, and two newly chosen Cæsars--Galerius and Flavius Valerius\r\nConstantius, later called Chlorus. By this arrangement the recovery of\r\nBritain from Allectus--who had murdered Carausius about 294--fell to\r\nConstantius, and he accomplished this by a sudden attack in 296.\r\nConstantius was twice married. His first wife, Helena, bore him a son,\r\nConstantine the Great; his second was a step-daughter of Maximian,\r\nnamed Theodora, to whom coin 18 belongs.\r\n\r\nBritain was now divided into four Diocletian provinces, to which a\r\nfifth--Valentia--was later added when the country north of Hadrian's\r\nwall was re-occupied. The only other event of Diocletian's reign to be\r\nnoticed is the persecution of Christians in which, according to\r\ntradition, St. Alban lost his life at Verulam about 303.\r\n\r\n(19-20) On May 1, 305, Diocletian and Maximian abdicated. Constantius\r\nand Galerius now became Augusti. Trouble arose over the two vacant\r\nCæsarships. It was the aim of Galerius to exclude Constantine, but the\r\nlatter escaped to his father's camp at York, a few weeks before\r\nConstantius died on July 25, 306, after a victory over the Picts and\r\nScots. Constantine was in power under various titles in Gaul and\r\nBritain for five years until, in 311, when Galerius died, he began his\r\nmarch on Rome, during which he is said to have had his vision of the\r\ncross with the words [Greek: en toutô nika]. In 314 the bishops of\r\nYork, London, and some other uncertain British see attended the\r\nCouncil of Arles which sat to deal with the Donatist schism. The\r\nBritish Church was also represented at the Council of Nicæa, called by\r\nConstantine in 325 to consider the Arian heresy, when the Nicene Creed\r\nin its original form was authorized; the British vote was orthodox. It\r\nwas Constantine who in 321 first made Sunday a holiday, but whether\r\nChristianity or Mithraism prompted him to this is doubtful.\r\n\r\n(22-23) When Constantine the Great died in 337 the empire was divided\r\nbetween his sons. Constantius II. received the east; Constans, Africa,\r\nItaly, and the Danuvian region; Constantine II., Gaul and Spain. In\r\n340 Constantine II. attacked Constans and was killed. Constans then\r\nruled the united west; it seems that Constans and Constantius II.\r\nvisited Britain in 343. Constans was assassinated in 350; this left\r\nConstantius II. alone. His policy of toleration towards the Arians led\r\nto a great Church Council in 359. The eastern bishops met at Seleucia,\r\nthe western at Ariminum, where Britain was represented. By a certain\r\namount of coercion Constantius forced his views on the Western\r\nCouncil. At this time the prosperity of Britain was great and corn was\r\nexported in large quantities.\r\n\r\n(24) In 367 Valentinian I. made his son Gratian, Augustus. Gratian was\r\nlater married to Constantia, daughter of Constantius II. Roman power\r\nwas now asserted once more against the Picts and Scots, and also\r\nagainst the Saxon raiders by Theodosius, whose son became Augustus in\r\n379. Gratian himself was occupied on the Continent. In 383 Magnus\r\nMaximus was proclaimed emperor in Britain, and Gratian was murdered on\r\nAugust 25.\r\n\r\nThe coins were not a hoard; they were found all over the Roman area I\r\nhave described, but especially in Blackbanks, and they became visible\r\ngenerally when the surface was fallow and had broken down into fine\r\nmould from the action of the weather. Their scattered occurrence, and\r\nthe period they cover, suggest continuous habitation throughout the\r\nmost important part of the Roman occupation of Britain, and, with\r\ntheir related history, they occupy a distinguished place in a record\r\nof the harvest of Grain and Chaff from an English Manor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1: Celebrated breeders of the respective sorts.]\r\n\r\n[2: Fig. 1 shows the flattened _S_ formed by the stream.\r\nFig. 2 shows the short circuit formed later at _A_ and the island _B_\r\nWhen the old bed of the stream round _B_ gets filled up, the island\r\n_B_ disappears, and its area and that part of the old bed formerly on\r\nthe west side of the stream is transferred to the east side.]\r\n\r\n[3: Mr. H.A. Evans sends me a very interesting note on this subject.\r\nHe refers me to Shakespeare, _Henry VIII., III., II., 282_, where\r\nSurrey, alluding to Wolsey, says:\r\n\r\n                            \"If we live thus tamely,\r\n     To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,\r\n     Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,\r\n     And dare us with his cap like larks.\"\r\n\r\nThe verb _dare_ here used is quite a distinct word from _dare_ = to\r\nventure to do. It means to daze or render helpless with the sight of\r\nsomething. To dare larks is to fascinate or daze them in order to\r\ncatch them. The \"dare\" is made of small bits of looking-glass fastened\r\non scarlet cloth. Shakespeare's use of the word in the passage quoted\r\nis evidently an allusion to the scarlet biretta of the cardinal. In\r\nHogarth's \"Distressed Poet\" a \"dare\" is suspended above the\r\nchimney-piece.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\"AKERMAST,\" 197.\r\n.\r\nAlbinism, 255.\r\n\r\n\"Alcoholiday,\" 177.\r\n\r\nAldington, 1;\r\n  band, 122;\r\n  chapel, 5;\r\n  concerts, 123;\r\n  constable, 8;\r\n  derivation, 1;\r\n  farm, 3;\r\n  hosiery factory, 7;\r\n  manor, 2;\r\n  prepares to resist Jacobites, 7;\r\n  variants, 5, 8, 298, 299;\r\n  village, 3.\r\n\r\nAllsebrook, Rev.
